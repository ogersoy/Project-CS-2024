# 4 General
## 4.1 Overview
A 5G system consists of a 5G Access Network (AN), and a 5G Core Network (5GC).
Network slicing is one of the key 5G features.
The management aspects of a Network Slice Instance (NSI) are described by the
four phases shown in Figure 4.3.1.1 of TS 28.530 [4].
The provisioning of network slicing includes the four phases which are
preparation, commissioning, operation and decommissioning:
\- In the preparation phase the NSI does not exist. The preparation phase
includes network slice design, on-boarding, evaluation of the network slice
requirements, preparing the network environment and other necessary
preparations required to be done before the creation of an NSI.
\- During the NSI lifecycle stage which include commissioning phase, operation
phase and decommissioning phase, the NSI provisioning operations include:
\- Create an NSI;
\- Activate an NSI;
\- Deactivate an NSI;
\- Modify an NSI;
\- Terminate an NSI.
The operations of the provisioning of an NSI occurs during different phases of
a NSI:
a) During the commissioning phase:
\- Create an NSI.
> During NSI creation all resources to the NSI have been created and
> configured to satisfy the network slice requirements. NSI creation may
> trigger NSSI(s) creation or using existing NSSI(s) and setting up the
> corresponding associations.
b) During the operation phase:
\- Activate an NSI;
\- Modify an NSI;
\- Deactivate an NSI.
NSI activation includes any actions that make the NSI active to provide
communication services. NSI activation may trigger NSSI activation.
NSI modification in operation phase could map to several workflows, e.g.
changes of NSI capacity, changes of NSI topology, NSI reconfiguration. NSI
modification can be triggered by receiving new network slice related
requirements, new communication service requirements, or the result of NSI
supervision automatically. NSI modification may trigger NSSI modification.
The NSI deactivation operation may be needed before NSI modification operation
and the NSI activation operation may be needed after the NSI modification
operation. NSI deactivation includes any actions that make the NSI inactive
and not providing any communication services. NSI deactivation trigger NSSI
deactivation to deactivate constituent NSSI(s) which is not used by other
NSI(s). Operator may decide to keep the NSI without termination after
deactivation and reactivate it when receives new communication service
request.
c) During the decommissioning phase:
\- Terminate an NSI.
> NSI termination step includes any action that make the NSI does not exist
> anymore and release resources that are not used by other NSI(s). NSI
> termination may trigger NSSI termination to terminate constituent NSSI(s)
> which is not used by other NSI(s).
Similarly, provisioning for network slice subnet instance includes the
following operations:
\- Create an NSSI;
\- Activate an NSSI and associate it with certain NSI to be used by the NSI;
\- Disassociate the NSSI with certain NSI and deactivate the NSSI if it's not
associated with any NSI;
\- Modify an NSSI;
\- Terminate an NSSI.
## 4.2 Configuration information for the constituents of an NSI
To use network slice to support communication service or deliver a network
slice as a service, the 3GPP defined constituents of the NSI should be
configured by 3GPP management system according to the types and requirements
of the network slice so that the NSI can be operated and maintained.
The configuration information of these components may include:
_\- Information on the requirements to be applied to every NSI constituent to
satisfy the requirements of multiple NSIs_ if the constituent is shared by
multiple NSIs;
_\- Network function selection information:_ Information on the selection of
the NFs (e.g., AMF) according to the requirements of this NSI;
_\- Connection information_ : _The information of the logical links to carry
the NSI's CP and UP data between the component and other NFs and NSSIs
belonging to the NSI._
NOTE 1: The list of information above is not exhaustive.
NOTE 2: The list of information above is not all necessary for an NSI.
## 4.3 General information for network slice instance
The general information used to describe a network slice instance may include:
\- Resource model information, which describes the static parameters and
functional components of network slice, includes service profile, network
slice type (e.g. eMBB), additional system feature (e.g. multicast, Edge
Computing), priority.
\- Management model information, which describes the information model that is
used for network slice lifecycle management, includes configuration profile
(e.g. application configuration parameters).
\- Capability model information, which describes the capability including
supported communication service characteristic information (e.g. service type,
UE mobility level, density of users, traffic density), QoS attributes (e.g.
bandwidth, latency, throughput and so on) and capacity (e.g. maximum number of
UEs), can be exposed to CSC .
## 4.4 General information for network slice subnet instance
The general information used to describe a network slice subnet instance may
include:
\- Resource model information, which describes the static parameters and
functional component of network slice subnet, includes slice profile, network
slice subnet type (e.g. RAN eMBB, CN eMBB), additional system feature (e.g.
multicast, Edge Computing), priority, QoS attributes (e.g. bandwidth, latency,
number of subscribers and so on), NSD ID.
\- Management model information, which describes the information model that is
used for network slice subnet lifecycle management, includes configuration
profile (e.g. application configuration parameters).
\- Capability model information, which describes the capability including
supported communication service characteristic information (e.g. service type,
UE mobility level, density of users, traffic density), QoS attributes (e.g.
bandwidth, latency, throughput and so on) and capacity (e.g. maximum number of
UEs).

**Goal** To deallocate a network slice instance.
**Actors and Roles** A network slice provisioning management service consumer.
**Telecom resources** Network slice instance\  
Network slice subnet instances\  
A network slice provisioning management service provider.\  
A network slice subnet provisioning management service provider.
**Assumptions** N/A
**Pre-conditions** N/A
**Begins when** The network slice provisioning management service provider
receives the request indicating that an existing NSI is no longer needed to
support a particular service (identified by service profile Id). The NSI
identification is included in the request.
**Step 1 (M)** Based on the request, the network slice provisioning management
service provider deletes the corresponding slice profile and checks if there
are other services to be supported by the NSI. If there are none the network
slice provisioning management service provider may decide to terminate the
NSI; then proceed to Step 2.\ NSI modification use case Otherwise, the network
slice provisioning management service provider may decide to trigger to modify
the NSI or to do nothing.\  
The use case is completed; go to step 5.
**Step 2 (M)** If the NSI to be terminated is active, the network slice
provisioning management service provider de-activates the NSI. Then, the NSI
to be terminated is inactive. NSI de-activation use case
**Step 3 (M)** The network slice provisioning management service provider
identifies the network slice subnet instances used by the NSI, and for every
such NSSI sends the request to the corresponding network slice subnet
provisioning management service provider (s) indicating that the NSSI(s) are
longer needed for the NSI. The network slice subnet provisioning management
service provider (s) may decide to terminate or modify the NSSI(s) based on
the request and disassociates them with the NSI.
**Step 4 (M)** The network slice provisioning management service provider
receives the response from the network slice subnet provisioning management
service provider (s) and terminates the NSI.
**Step 5 (M)** The network slice provisioning management service provider
notifies its consumer of the deallocation.

* * *
Use case stage Evolution/Specification \>\ Related use
**Goal** To check the feasibility of provisioning a network slice subnet to
determine whether network slice subnet requirements can be satisfied at a
particular point of time (e.g., in terms of resources)
**Actors and Roles** Network slice subnet management service consumer. For
example, when a network slice subnet instance is to be provided as a
constituent of a network slice instance.
**Telecom resources** Network slice subnet instance\  
Network slice management service provider. For example, a management function
that plays the role of network slice management service provider.
**Assumptions** Network slice subnet management service consumer has decided
to check the feasibility of provisioning a network slice subnet based on, for
example, internal decision or to facilitate an external service requests.
**Pre-conditions** Network slice subnet requirements have been derived or
received by network slice subnet management service consumer.
**Begins when** Network slice subnet management service provider receives the
request to evaluate the feasibility of provisioning a network slice subnet
according to the network slice requirements at a particular point in time.
**Step 1 (M)** Network slice subnet management service provider identifies the
network slice subnets constituents according to the requirements, e.g.,
network services to be requested from MANO.
**Step 2 (O)** For the purpose of checking the feasibility of provisioning a
network slice subnet(s) of the network slice instance, network slice subnet
management service provider(s) may obtain information from the network (e.g.,
current or predicted load level information, current or predicted resource
usage information from management data analytics services).
**Step 3 (M)** Network slice subnet management service provider sends
enquiries with reservation requests to other management providers (e.g., MANO)
to determine availability of network constituents, e.g., network services,
network functions. If some of the responses are negative, network slice subnet
management service provider may send enquiries to different management
providers.
**Ends when** Feasibility check results have been provided to network slice
subnet management service consumer.
**Exceptions** One of the mandatory steps fails.
**Post-conditions** N/A

# 7 Provisioning procedures of networks and network slicing
## 7.1 General
The procedures of provisioning of 5G networks are listed in this following
subclauses.
## 7.2 Procedure of Network Slice Instance Allocation
The Figure 7.2-1 illustrates the procedure of creating a new NSI or using an
existing NSI to satisfy the required network slice related requirements.
{width="5.767361111111111in" height="5.999305555555556in"}
Figure 7.2-1: Network Slice Instance Allocation Request procedure
1) Network Slice Management Service Provider (NSMS_Provider) receives an
AllocateNsi request (see AllocateNsi operation defined in clause 6.5.1) from
Network Slice Management Service Consumer (NSMS_Consumer) with network slice
related requirements (the network slice related requirements are defined as
the attributes in the ServiceProfile see clause 6.3.3 in TS 28.541 [6]).
2) Based on the network slice related requiremen and the knowledge of the
capabilities of existing deployed network slices, the NSMS_Provider
compare/match _the provided requirements against all the candidate_
NetworkSlice _instances, and_ then decides whether to use an existing NSI or
create a new NSI. If the network slice related requirements allow the
requested NSI to be shared and if an existing suitable NSI can be reused, the
NSMS_Provider may decide to use the existing NSI.
3a) If using an existing NSI and the existing NSI needs to be modified to
satisfy the network slice related requirements, the NSMS_Provider invokes the
procedure to modify the existing NSI as described in clause 7.6.
3b-1) If creating a new NSI, the NSMS_Provider derives the network slice
subnet related requirements from the received network slice related
requirements. Before NSMS_Provider derives the network slice subnet related
requirements, NSMS_Provider may invoke corresponding network slice subnet
capability information querying procedure as described in clause 7.8.
3b-2) The NSMS_Provider invokes the NSSI allocation procedure as described in
clause 7.3.Before NSMS_Provider invokes the NSSI allocation procedure,
NSMS_Provider may invoke corresponding network slice subnet feasibility check
procedure as described in clause 7.14.
3b-3) The NSMS_Provider creates the MOI for NetworkSlice and configures the
MOI with the DN of MOI for the NetworkSliceSubnet, other configuration
information may be configured for the created MOI.
Note: The detailed configuration information is described in network slice NRM
(see NetworkSlice IOC defined in clause 6.3.1 in TS 28.541 [6]).
4) The NSMS_Provider sends NSI allocation result (see AllocateNsi operation
defined in clause 6.5.1) to the NSMS_Consumer. If an existing NSI is modified
or a new NSI is created successfully to satisfy the network slice related
requirements, the result includes the relevant network slice instance
information (see NetworkSlice IOC defined in clause 6.3.1 in TS 28.541 [6]):
\- DN of the NetworkSlice.
Otherwise the result may include the reason of failure, for example, the
required latency or user number cannot be satisfied, or the physical resource
is not enough.
## 7.3 Procedure of Network Slice Subnet Instance Allocation
The Figure 7.3-1 illustrates the procedure of creating a new network slice
subnet instance or using an existing network slice subnet instance to satisfy
the required network slice subnet related requirements.
{width="5.770833333333333in" height="8.49375in"}
Figure 7.3-1: Network Slice Subnet Instance Allocation Request procedure
1) Network Slice Subnet Management Service Provider (NSSMS_P) receives an
AllocateNssi request (see AllocateNssi operation defined in clause 6.5.2) from
Network Slice Subnet Management Service Consumer (NSSMS_C) with network slice
subnet related requirements (network slice subnet related requirements defined
in SliceProfile see clause 6.3.4 in TS 28.541 [6]).
2) NSSMS_P check the feasibility of network slice subnet related requirements.
If the network slice subnet related requirements can be satisfied, the
following step 3) are needed, else go to step 5).
3) Based on the network slice subnet related requirements and the existing
NSSI capabilities, NSSMS_P decides whether to use an existing NSSI or create a
new NSSI. If the network slice subnet related requirements allow the requested
NSSI to be shared and if an existing suitable NSSI can be reused, the NSSMS_P
decides to use the existing NSSI.
4.1a) If using an existing NSSI and the existing NSSI needs to be modified to
satisfy the network slice subnet related requirements, the NSSMS_P invokes the
procedure to modify the existing NSSI as described in clause 7.7.
4.1b.1) If creating a new NSSI, the NSSMS_P creates the NetworkSliceSubnet
MOI. NSSMS_P derives the corresponding network slice subnet constituent (i.e.
NF, constituent NSS) related requirements and transport network related
requirements (e.g. 3GPP endpoint information, latency requirements, bandwidth
requirements and isolation requirements) from the received network slice
subnet related requirements. Part of these requirements may be referenced by
attribute \"epTransportRef\" as defined in clause 6.3.2.2 in TS 28.541[6].
Before NSSMS_Provider derives the constituent network slice subnet related
requirements, NSMS_Provider may invoke corresponding network slice subnet
capability information querying procedure as described in clause 7.8.2.
4.1b.2) If the NSSI to be created contains virtualisation part (i.e. VNF or
VL), NSSMS_P derives the NS instance instantiation information (the NS
instance instantiation information is described in clause 7.3.2.2 and clause
7.3.3.2 [3]) based on network slice subnet related requirements. NSSMS_P
determines new VNF instance(s) that need to be deployed and the existing VNF
instance(s) that need to be reused according to the necessary network
function(s) and then derives the profile of virtual link(s) according to the
connection requirements between the network functions. NSSMS_P chooses a
proper NSD deployment flavour and creates data concerning the SAPs of the NS
instance. NSSMS_P invokes the NS instantiation procedures to create a NS
instance. NSSMS_P configures the NSS MOI with the NS instance identifier.
Note: NS instantiation procedure is described in TS 28.526 [7].
4.1b.3) For each required NSSI constituent, the following step 4.1b.3a) and
4.1b.3b) are needed:
4.1b.3a) If the required NSSI constituent is constituent NSSI, NSSMS_P invokes
NSSI Allocation Procedure.
4.1b.3b) If the required NSSI constituent is NF instance, NSSMS_P invokes NF
Creation Procedure as described in clause 7.10 or NF Modification Procedure as
described in clause 7.11.
4.1b.4) NSSMS_P configures the NetworkSliceSubnet MOI with the DN of the MOI
for NSSI constituent (i.e. ManagedFunction MOI, NetworkSliceSubnet MOI).
4.1b.5) For each required transport network related requirements, NSSMS_P
invokes corresponding procedure of coordination with relevant TN Manager to
handle the TN part as described in clause 7.9.
5) The NSSMS_P sends the NSSI allocation result (see AllocateNssi operation
defined in clause 6.5.2) to the NSSMS_C. If the NSSI is created successfully,
the result includes the relevant constituent network slice subnet instance
information (see NetworkSliceSubnet IOC defined in clause 6.3.2 in TS 28.541
[6]):
\- DN of the NetworkSliceSubnet MOI.
\- NS instance Info (e.g. NSinstanceId)
Otherwise the result may include the reason of failure, for example, the
required latency or user Number cannot be satisfied, or the physical resource
is not enough.

The message flow for allocation is as follows:
1\. The MnS consumer sends a HTTP POST request to the MnS producer.
\- The target URI is equal to the concatenation of URI of the parent resource
of resource to be created, and the resource (in this case SliceProfile) to be
created.
\- The message body shall carry the complete representation of the resource to
be created. The resource identifier shall be absent or carry null semantics.
2\. The MnS producer sends a HTTP POST response to the MnS consumer.
\- On success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The Location header shall
carry the URI of the new resource (in this case SliceProfile) and the message
body shall contain the complete complete representation of the SliceProfile
and networkSliceSubnetDN identifying the NetworkSliceSubnet MOI created.
> \- On failure, an appropriate error code shall be returned. The response
> message body may provide additional error information.

###### ## Annex A (informative): A network slice journey example
The Generic Slice Template (GST) ([9]) provides a standardized list of
attributes that can be used to characterise different types of network slice.
GST is generic and is not tied to any:
\- Type of network slice
\- Agreement between a Network Slice Customer (NSC) and a Network Slice
Provider (NSP).
A Network Slice Type (NEST) is a GST filled with (ranges of) values. There may
be two kinds of NESTs:
\- Standardized NESTs (S-NEST), i.e. NESTs which character attributes are
assigned (ranges of) values by SDOs, working groups, foras, etc. such as e.g.
3GPP, GSMA, 5GAA, 5G-ACIA, etc.;
\- Private NESTs (P-NEST), i.e. NESTs which character attributes are assigned
(ranges of) values by the Network Slice Providers, which are different from
those assigned in S-NESTs.
Network Slice Providers can build their network slice product offering based
on S-NESTs and/or their P-NESTs. For example, a Standardized Network Slice
Type (S-NEST) NST-A, for which the attribute 'Packet delay budget' (see [x] --
clause 3.4.26) value range is between 1 ms and 100 ms, is specified by 3GPP.
Netwok Slice Provider Y may offer e.g. 3 products based on NST-A:
\- Platinum NST-A based network slice product, where the attribute 'Packet
delay budget' (see [x] -- clause 3.4.26) value range is between 1 ms and 10
ms;
\- Gold NST-A based network slice product, where the attribute 'Packet delay
budget' (see [x] -- clause 3.4.26) value range is between 11 ms and 50 ms;
\- Silver NST-A based network slice product, where the attribute 'Packet delay
budget' (see [x] -- clause 3.4.26) value range is between 51 ms and 100 ms.
NSP Y's customers can then order network slice instances from Y's product
catalog, as depicted by Figure A.1.

Figure A.1: From GST to S-(/P-)NEST based product ordering
1) A Network Slice Customer orders network slice instance to a Network Slice
Provider, based on NSP's product offering, by sending a request to NSP' BSS
2) NSP's BSS receives the request from NSC and translates NSC requirements
into NSP technical parameter values
3) NSP's BSS sends a request to NSP's OSS to provide a network slice instance
which fits NSC's requirements (see Table 6.1-1)
4) NSP's Network Slice Provisioning MnS either creates a new network slice
instance or assigns an already existing network slice instance to NSC's
request
5) NSP's Network Slice Provisioning MnS may have to request the Network Slice
Subnet Provisioning MnS to provide a network slice subnet instance
corresponding to the network slice instance (see Table 6.2-1)
6) NSP's Network Slice Subnet Provisioning MnS may have to create one or more
inner network slice subnet instances
7) NSP's Network Function Provisioning MnS configures VNFs and/or PNFs (see
Table 6.3-1).

Figure A.2: Network Slice journey (NSaaS model) -- high-level call flow
Depending on NSP's product offering, NSC can order network slice instances
spanning one or more network domains, e.g.:
\- network slice instances composed of a RAN-only network slice subnet
instance
{width="3.7416666666666667in" height="2.075in"}

\- network slice instances composed of a CN-only network slice subnet instance
\- network slice instances composed of a RAN network slice subnet instance +
Transport network slice subnet + CN network slice subnet instance
{width="5.788194444444445in" height="2.55in"}
Figure A.4: RAN+TN+CN network slice subnets exposed as network slice
\- network slice instances composed of a RAN network slice subnet instance +
CN network slice subnet instance + IMS network slice subnet instance
\- or more, as shown below..

###### ## Annex B (informative): General information for network slice related
identifiers
The following network slice related identifiers serve different purposes:
* * *
Identifier Description Identifiers for network slice management purpose  
NetworkSlice identifier To identify a NetworkSlice instance defined in TS
28.530 (see [4]), it is DN of a managed object instance of NetworkSlice IOC,
see TS 28.541 [6] NetworkSliceSubnet identifier To identify a
NetworkSliceSubnet instance defined in TS 28.530 (see [4]), it is DN of a
managed object instance of NetworkSliceSubnet IOC, see TS 28.541 [6]
**Identifiers for network slice signaling purpose**  
NSI ID NSI ID is only for 5GC signaling use, i.e. to identify Core Network
part of a Network Slice instance when multiple Network Slice instances of the
same Network Slice are deployed, and there is a need to differentiate between
them in the 5GC, see clause 3.1 of TS 23.501 [10]. The NRM attribute
cNSIIdList of NRFFunction and NSSFFunction, see TS 28.541 [6], is a list for
NSI ID(s). S-NSSAI To identify Network Slice defined in TS 23.501. Referred to
TS 23.501 [10] and TS 38.300 [11]. NRM attribute sNSSAIList defines the
S-NSSAI(s) supported by the corresponding managed object, see TS 28.541 [6].
PLMN ID Represent PLMN identifier.
* * *
The NSI ID and S-NSSAI are configuration parameters of the management system.
