# 4 Concepts and overview
## 4.1 Overview
The 5G networks and network slicing are designed to support eMBB, URLLC and
mIoT services. Some services have ultra-low latency, high data capacity, and
strict reliability requirements, as any faults or performance issues in the
networks can cause service failure which may result in property damage and
body injury. Therefore, it is necessary to collect real-time performance data
that can be used by analytic applications (e.g., network optimization, SON,
etc.) to detect the potential issues in advance, and take appropriate actions
to prevent or mitigate the issues. Also, the performance data shall be able to
be consumed by multiple analytic applications with specific purposes.
## 4.2 Management data analytics
The raw performance data of NFs of the mobile network can be analysed,
together with other management data (e.g., alarm information, configuration
data),and formed into one or more management analytical data for NFs, sub-
networks, NSSIs or NSIs. The management analytical data can be used to
diagnose ongoing issues impacting the performance of the mobile network and
predict any potential issues (e.g., potential failure and/or performance
degradation). For example, the analysis of NSI/NSSI resource usage can form a
management analytical data indicating whether a certain resource is
deteriorating. The analysis and correlation of the overall performance data of
mobile network may indicate overload situation and potential failure(s).
SON Capacity and Coverage Optimization (CCO) is one typical case that may
consume the management analytical data. CCO provides optimal coverage and
capacity for the E-UTRAN, see clause 4.5 of TS 28.628 [13], which may also be
applicable for 5G radio networks. The management analytical data related to
coverage and capacity help the SON CCO to realise the situation of coverage
and capacity or interference, and to trigger corresponding optimization if
needed.
Note: Details of the management analytical data including e.g. format,
categorisation and method/algorithm of calculations are to be defined.
## 4.3 PM services
The PM for 5G networks and network slicing is comprised of the management
services listed in the table 4.3-1 below:
Table 4.3-1: PM services for 5G networks and network slicing
* * *
Management service Description Measurement job control service for NF The
management service for creating, terminating and querying the measurement
job(s) for the NF(s). Performance data file reporting service for NF The
management service for reporting the NF performance data file. Performance
data streaming service for NF The management service for reporting the NF
performance data steam. Measurement job control service for NSSI The
management service for creating, terminating and querying the measurement
job(s) for the NSSI(s). Performance data file reporting service for NSSI The
management service for reporting the NSSI performance data file. Performance
data streaming service for NSSI The management service for reporting the NSSI
performance data stream. Measurement job control service for NSI The
management service for creating, terminating and querying the measurement
job(s) for the NSI(s). Performance data file reporting service for NSI The
management service for reporting the NSI performance data file. Performance
data streaming service for NSI The management service for reporting the NSI
performance data stream. Measurement job control service for network/sub-
network The management service for creating, terminating and querying the
measurement job(s) for the network(s)/subnetwork(s). The measurement job for
the network(s)/subnetwork(s) is to collect the network/subnetwork performance
data that are not specific to network slicing. Performance data file reporting
service for network/sub-network The management service for reporting the file
of the network/subnetwork performance data that is not specific to network
slicing. Performance data streaming service for network/sub-network The
management service for reporting the stream of the network/subnetwork
performance data that is not specific to network slicing. MnS responsible for
KPI job control The management service for creating, terminating and querying
the KPI job(s)
* * *
## 4.4 PM services for multiple tenant support
The MnS consumer, acting on behalf of a tenant, may get the performance
measurements of a network slice.. Performance measurements specified in TS
28.552 [1] can be split into sub-counters per S-NSSAI. 3GPP management system
can use these sub-counters to distinguish performance measurements for
different tenants, which might be required when performance measurements are
exposed as part of Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS) specified in TS 28.530
[23].

# 6\. Performance assurance specific operations and notifications
## 6.1 Measurement job control related operations
### 6.1.1 Operation createMeasurementJob (M)
#### 6.1.1.1 Definition
This operation supports the authorized consumer to request the procedure of
measurement job control related MnS or KPI job control related MnS to create a
measurement job.
One measurement job can collect the value of one or multiple measurement types
which are the performance measurements and assurance data defined in TS 28.552
[2], or collect the value of one or multiple KPIs defined in TS 28.554 [21].
When a measurement type or KPI is collected by one measurement job for a given
instance (e.g., an NF instance or a subnetwork instance), another measurement
job creation request which wants to collect the same measurement type or KPI
for the same instance with different granularity period may be rejected. This
behaviour shall be consistent for a given implementation by a specific
management service producer.
There are two different methods for the performance data to be reported:
\- Performance data file method: In this method the performance data is
accumulated for certain time before it is reported; the data will be delivered
as a file.
\- Performance data streaming method: In this method, the performance data
streaming producer, when the performance data are ready, sends the performance
data to the consumer (i.e., stream target). The volume of the performance data
reported by streaming is expected to be small, and the Granularity period of
the performance data stream needs to be configurable and is expected to be
short.

sending the performance data to the performance data streaming consumer
(stream target).
{width="6.696527777777778in" height="3.966666666666667in"}
Figure D.1.1-1
1\. The consumer of MnS for measurement control requests the MnS producer to
start the measurement collection by the following two alternatives:
1) by the measurement job control service
1a. The MnS consumer invokes the createMeasurementJob operation towards the
MnS producer;
2) by the configurable measurement control service (a.k.a, NRM fragment-based
measurement control service).
1b. The MnS consumer creates a new PerfMetricJob MOI, by invoking the
createMOI operation towards the MnS producer; or
1c. The MnS consumer modifies an existing PerfMetricJob MOI to add new
measurements to be collected, by invoking the modifyMOIAttributes operation
towards the MnS producer.
2\. The producer of MnS for measurement control configures the NF to collect
the measurements. The mechanism of this step is vendor specific. If producer
of MnS for measurement control is in the NF, this step can be skipped.
3\. The NF triggers the producer of MnS for performance data streaming to set
up the streaming information for the new measurements to be collected. The
mechanism of this step is vendor specific. If producer of MnS for performance
data streaming is in the NF, this step can be skipped.
4\. The producer of MnS for performance data streaming communicates with the
consumer to:
4a. establish the streaming (WebSocket) connection containing the stream
information if it does not exist yet, by invoking the
establishStreamingConnection operation;
4b. add the stream information for the new measurements if they will be
reported by new streams, by invoking the addStreamInfo operation;
4c. update the stream information for the new measurements if they will be
reported by existing streams, by invoking the updateStreamInfo operation.
5\. The NF collects the measurements. This step is the internal behaviour of
the NF.
6\. The NF report the collected measurements to the producer of MnS for
performance data streaming. The mechanism of this step is vendor specific. If
producer of MnS for performance data streaming is in the NF, this step can be
skipped.
7\. The producer of MnS for performance data streaming sends the collected
measurements to the consumer via performance data streams, by invoking the
reportStreamData operation.

###### ## Annex F (normative): Threshold crossing notifications triggering
# F.1 Threshold crossing notifications triggering for cumulative counters
For the threshold monitoring of performance measurements that are cumulative
counters, the notification notifyThresholdCrossing is emitted immediately when
the cumulative counter of measured events reached the threshold, without
waiting to the end of the monitoring granularity period (GP).
Figure F.1-1: Threshold crossing notifications triggering for cumulative
counters
# F.2 Threshold crossing notifications triggering for measurements that are
not cumulative counters
For the threshold monitoring of performance measurements that are not
cumulative counters, the notification notifyThresholdCrossing is emitted at
the end of the monitoring granularity period (GP) if the measurement value
reached or crossed the threshold.
The threshold crossing notification event time field indicates the time during
the Monitoring GP that the threshold was crossed.
{width="5.927083333333333in" height="4.5in"}
Figure F.2-1: Threshold crossing notifications triggering for measurements
that are not cumulative counters
Thresholds configured in both directions would emit the following
notifications:
Notifications are emitted for Threshold #1 (T1) and Threshold #2 (T2) at end
of Monitoring GP 1.
Notifications are emitted for Threshold #2 (T3) and Threshold #1 (T4) at end
of Monitoring GP 2.
Notifications are emitted for Threshold #1 (T5) and Threshold #2 (T6) at end
of Monitoring GP 3.
###### ## Annex G (normative): ASN.1 definition for performance data stream
units
## G.1 ASN.1 definition rule
For performance data streaming, the type of WebSocket Data frame shall be
binary (with opcode of 0x2).
This subclause specifies the abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) definition
for the Performance Data Stream Units as Payload data of WebSocket Data frame.
The Performance Data Stream Units are described using ASN.1 as specified in
ITU-T Rec. X.680 [15] and X.681 [16]. Transfer syntax for Performance Data
Stream Units is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by use of Packed Encoding
Rules (PER), aligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [17].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in
ITU-T Rec. X.691 [17]:
\- When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in clause
15.6 to 15.11 in ITU-T Rec X.691 [c], the leading bit of the bit string value
shall be placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of
the bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field;
\- When decoding a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents
Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are
extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
NOTE: The terms \'leading bit\' and \'trailing bit\' are defined in ITU-T Rec.
X.680 [15]. When using the \'bstring\' notation, the leading bit of the bit
string value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is
on the right.

###### ## Annex H (normative): NSI and NSSI performance assurance
# H.1 General
After network slice instance is created, 3GPP management system creates all
resources to the NSI and configurations satisfy the network slice
requirements, including the performance of NSI requested according to network
slice SLS (as part of SLA). In order to guarantee the performance of network
slice, NSI modification can be triggered by NSI provisioning service. During
the NSI performance supervision, the end to end KPIs defined in TS 28.554
[21], performance measurements defined in TS 28.552[2] and optionally slice
QoE provided by NWDAF in 3GPP TS 23.288 [22] should be used for SLA fulfilment
evaluation. According to the evaluation result, NSI modification defined in TS
28.531[24] can be triggered for network slice performance assurance.
# H.2 Procedure of NSI and NSSI performance assurance
This Figure H.2-1 illustrates the procedure of performance assurance for
NSI(s) or NSSI(s).
Figure H.2-1: Example of procedure for NSI and NSSI performance assurance
1\. The authorized consumer requests NSMS_Producer to allocate a new NSI.
NSMS_Producer consumes provisioning services provided by NSSMS_Producer to
create the NSI. After NSI allocation, the NSMS_Producer and NSSMS_Producer
perform NSI and NSSI performance supervision.
2\. The NSMS_Producer or NSSMS_Producer may get slice QoE analytics provided
by NWDAF.
3\. The NSMS_Producer or NSSMS_Producer checks whether the performance
requirements can be met by NSI or NSSI by utilizing the end to end KPIs
defined in TS 28.554 [21], performance measurements defined in TS 28.552[2]
and slice QoE analytics provided by NWDAF in 3GPP TS 23.288 [22].
4a. If the performance requirements of NSI cannot be met, the NSMS_Producer
triggers the NSI modification procedure. NSMS_Producer modifies the capacity
of the network slice, or modifies the network slice configuration to guarantee
the performance requirements.
4b. If the performance requirements of NSSI cannot be met, the NSSMS_Producer
of CN modifies virtualized resources and the configuration of 5GC NFs to
guarantee the performance requirements. NSSMS_Producer of AN reconfigures
RRMPolicy to optimize performance.
