# Introduction
This document describes the different cases of interaction between an Identity
Module (GSM-SIM or a 3G-UICC) and a GSM or 3G mobile equipment with a special
focus on the diverse situations that can apply in a mixed 2G/3G network
environment.
Depending on the technical properties of other involved network elements,
particularly during authentication and key agreement, the ICC and the ME may
or must support some specific features to allow for compatibility. This is a
complex matter and has generated some amount of confusion as the basic
conditions implied by the 3G UICC are not always as clearly understood as they
should be. The present document gives guidance by summarising the important
details and applying them to the (theoretically) possible cases of security
interworking along the transmission chain.
The document further tries to explain the options of interworking that exist
internally when a SIM and one or more USIM(s) are implemented together on a
single UICC.
As this document is a technical report and not a technical specification, none
of its contents have the character of a requirement. Merely they should be
seen as a clarifying summary and straightforward interpretation of the
underlying core specifications.

# 4 Primary clarifications and definitions
For the purpose of this report, the following clauses clarify the meaning of
some important terms.
## 4.1 2G and 3G
The abbreviation 2G stands for 2^nd^ generation technology and characterises
elements of a mobile communication system which are based on the GSM standard,
i.e. 2G technical specifications or their equivalent successors under the 3GPP
administration. A 2G entity only comprises the mandatory and optional
functionality specified in GSM and does not ensure any forward compatibility
with 3G, with a particular exception: 2G terminals of R99 and Rel-4 may and
from Rel-5 onwards have to support the 3G USIM.
The abbreviation 3G stands for 3^rd^ generation technology and characterises
elements of a mobile communication system which are based on 3GPP technical
specifications. A 3G entity only comprises the mandatory and optional
functionality specified in 3G, features for 2G backward compatibility are only
included if explicitly required by the relevant 3G specifications.
Some 3G specifications differentiate the functional extent of a mobile network
entity between releases 98 and earlier (R98-) and releases 99 and later
(R99+). As for example a GSM ME exists in both release categories while a 3G
ME is only defined from release 99 onwards, this split does not make sense
without mentioning the respective technology. For the purpose of this document
it therefore appears more appropriate to differentiate between 2G and 3G only,
with the relationship given by
2G = GSM = GSM R98- or GSM R99+
3G = 3G R99+
## 4.2 SIM, USIM and UICC
The most general term for a smart card, i.e. a micro-controller based access
module, not only for mobile communication purposes, is \"ICC\". It is always a
physical and logical entity and, in the context of this document, either a SIM
or a UICC.
The SIM is the ICC defined for 2G. It has originally been specified as one
physical and logical entity, not distinguishing platform and application. In
3G, the SIM may also be an application on the 3G UICC, then of course only
represented by its logical characteristics. If the SIM application is active,
the UICC is functionally identical to a 2G SIM. The SIM (or SIM application on
a UICC) does only accept 2G commands. It is specified in GSM TS 11.11 [7] / TS
51.011 [8].
Unlike the SIM, the USIM is not a physical entity, but a purely logical
application that resides on a UICC. It does only accept 3G commands and is
therefore not compatible with a 2G ME. The USIM may provide mechanisms to
support 2G authentication and key agreement to allow a 3G ME to access a 2G
network. It is specified in 3G TS 31.102 [2].
The UICC is the physical and logical platform for the USIM. It does at least
contain one USIM application and may additionally contain a SIM application.
Further to that, the UICC may contain additional USIMs and other applications,
e.g. for mobile banking or mobile commerce purposes, if these fit with the
basic physical and logical characteristics of the UICC. It is specified in 3G
TS 31.101 [1].
## 4.3 Types of ME
For the purpose of this document, the following definitions apply for the ME:
  * A 3G ME is either a 3G single mode ME that only supports a 3G radio access network or a 2G/3G dual mode ME that supports both, a 2G radio access network (GSM) and a 3G radio access network, which ever is present. In either case it can handle 3G AKA and 2G AKA and is able to interwork with either a USIM application on a UICC or a SIM. For better understanding, explicit usage of the term \"2G/3G dual mode ME\" points out particular requirements.
> \- A 2G ME does only support a 2G radio access network (GSM).
\- If it is of R98 or earlier, it can only handle 2G AKA and is only able to
interwork with either a SIM application on a UICC or a SIM. Then the card
interface complies to GSM TS 11.11 [7].
\- If it is of R99 or Rel-4, it can handle 2G AKA and is able to interwork
with either a SIM application on a UICC or a SIM. Then the card interface
complies to GSM TS 11.11 [7] / TS 51.011 [8]. Additionally, it may support 3G
AKA and be capable to interwork with a USIM application on a UICC. In this
optional mode, the card interface complies to 3G TS 31.101 [1] and 3G TS
31.102 [2].
\- If it is of Rel-5 or later, it can handle 2G AKA and 3G AKA (depending on
the current network situation) and is capable to work with a USIM application
on a UICC. On the card interface, it behaves just like a 3G ME, i.e. it
complies to 3G TS 31.101 [1] and 3G TS 31.102 [2]. As a recommended option,
the 2G ME of Rel-5 and onwards may additionally support a 2G SIM.
## 4.4 Types of VLR/SGSN and HLR/AuC
For the purpose of this document, the following definitions apply for the
VLR/SGSN and HLR/AuC:
\- A 2G HLR/AuC supports triplet generation for 2G subscriptions, but does not
support quintet generation. Only 2G AKA can be performed. A triplet consists
of RAND, RES and Kc, while a quintet comprises RAND, XRES, CK, IK and AUTN. A
2G HLR/AuC does not support any conversion functions.
\- A 3G HLR/AuC supports quintet generation for 3G subscriptions. To support
2G AKA, i.e. to convert quintets into triplets, it shall support conversion
functions c2 and c3 as defined in 3G TS 33.102 [6]. It may additionally
support pure triplet generation for 2G subscriptions.
\- A 2G VLR/SGSN only supports 2G AKA and can only be attached to a 2G BSS. It
does not support any conversion functions.
\- A 3G VLR/SGSN supports 3G AKA and 2G AKA. It can be attached to a 3G BSS
and/or a 2G BSS. To convert quintets from a 3G HLR/AuC into triplets necessary
for 2G AKA, it shall support conversion functions c2 and c3 as defined in 3G
TS 33.102 [6].
## 4.5 Security related terms
2G AKA is the procedure to provide authentication of an ICC to a serving
network domain and to generate the key Kc in accordance to the mechanisms
specified in TS 03.20. In a mixed 2G/3G network environment 2G AKA is
performed when - except for the BSS - at least one other element is 2G.
3G AKA is the procedure to provide mutual authentication between an ICC and a
serving network domain and to generate the keys CK and IK in accordance to the
mechanisms specified in 3G TS 33.102 [6]. For 3G AKA all involved elements -
except for the BSS - have to be 3G.
2G Security Context is a state that is established between a user and a
serving network domain (i.e. between the ICC and the VLR/SGSN) after the
execution of 2G AKA, with ciphering Kc available at either side.
3G Security Context is a state that is established between a user and a
serving network domain (i.e. between the ICC and the VLR/SGSN) after the
execution of 3G AKA, with ciphering and integrity protection keys CK and IK
available at either side. 3G Security Context is still given, if these keys
are converted into Kc to work with a 2G BSS.
# 5 Interworking between the ME and the ICC
The 3G system is designed to be compatible with GSM and several interworking
requirements apply. Regarding the ICC/ME interface, some basic requirements
can be identified in the 3G standards. They are differing between the
subsequent releases:
For R99, the following applies:
\- In 3G TS 22.100 [4]: \"The UMTS mobile terminal shall support phase 2 and
phase 2+ GSM SIMs as access modules to UMTS networks.\" In other words: A R99
3G ME shall support a 2G ICC.
\- In 3G TS 22.101 [5]: \"It shall be possible to use the UICC in 2G terminals
to provide access to GSM networks. In order to achieve that option, it shall
be possible to store a module containing 2G access functionalities on the UICC
which shall be accessed via the standard GSM SIM-terminal interface. \" In
other words: The R99 UICC may contain a SIM application.
> \- Additionally, a 2G terminal of R99 may provide a USIM interface. For
> Rel-4, 3G TS 22.100 [4] does not exist. There are however similar statements
> in 3G TS 22.101 [5]:
\- \"The basic mandatory UE requirements are: Support for GSM phase 2 and 2+
SIM cards [...]\", meaning that also a Rel-4 ME does work with a 2G ICC.
\- \"It shall be possible to use the UICC in 2G terminals to provide access to
networks supporting GERAN (including networks based on earlier GSM
specifications). In order to achieve that option, it shall be possible to
store a module containing 2G access functionalities on the UICC, which shall
be accessed via the standard SIM-terminal interface.\" In other words: The
Rel-4 UICC may contain a SIM application.
\- Additionally, a 2G terminal of Rel-4 may provide a USIM interface.
Therefore, in R99 and Rel-4 we have the same situation. Note that it is not a
mandatory requirement in R99 and Rel-4 that a USIM has to be supported by a 2G
ME. However, it is optional and in addition to the 2G SIM interface. In order
to allow a 3G UICC to work in a 2G ME where the USIM is not supported, it is
feasible to put a SIM application (according to TS 11.11 [7] / TS 51.011 [8])
onto the UICC in addition to the USIM.
For Rel-5, the requirement for 2G MEs to support 2G ICCs was deleted from 3G
TS 22.101[5], instead the following statements were inserted:
\- \"In Release 5 and later, terminals supporting only GERAN shall support
USIM.\" with a note \"It is strongly recommended that manufacturers implement
SIM support on GERAN only terminals until the population of SIMs in the market
is reduced to a low level.\"
\- \"The basic mandatory UE requirements are: Support for USIM. Optional
support of GSM phase 2, 2+, 3GPP Release 99 and Release 4 SIM cards. [...]
Support for the SIM is optional for the UE, however, if it is supported, all
the mandatory requirements for SIM shall be supported in the UE [...].\"
This means basically that for 2G and 3G MEs of Rel-5 the support of 2G SIMs is
now optional and it is mandatory (in particular for the 2G ME) to support the
USIM. Note that although a SIM application on the UICC is no longer mentioned,
it is still essential (and certainly allowed) to support Rel-4 and earlier
terminals that do not optionally accept a USIM with a SIM application on Rel-5
UICCs. In this case, the Rel-4 SIM specifications apply.
For the ICC/ME interface, with two main types of ME (3G and 2G) and two main
types of ICC (UICC and SIM), four different scenarios can be identified. They
are described in the following sections with appropriate splits into sub-
sections if release specific differences have to be taken into account.
## 5.1 3G ME and UICC
Any 3G ME, independent of the release, has to support the UICC. 3G TS 31.101
[1] and 3G TS 31.102 [2] apply.
According to 3G TS 21.111 [3] a 3G ME does not support a 5V ME/UICC interface.
As laid out in the same specification, a UICC does always support at least two
voltage classes, i.e. a 5V only UICC cannot exist.
In case of a UICC inserted in a 3G ME, nothing but the 3G command set (as
defined in 3G TS 31.101 [1] and 3G TS 31.102 [2]) can be used by the ME. In
particular, the 2G command RUN GSM ALGORITHM is not available.
To support a 2G/3G dual mode ME in a 2G radio access network, the USIM may
provide functions for 2G backward compatibility. Two particular USIM services
are defined for such purposes:
1\. **Service nÂ° 27:** \"GSM Access\". This service is essential when a 2G BSS
is involved and ciphering is active in the BSS. The USIM additionally
generates the 2G ciphering key Kc required by the 2G air interface. From the
security point of view, this behaviour can be characterised as \"**3G + Kc
mode** \" (see below). Further, the USIM supports some additional 2G data
storage elements that are necessary for 2G radio access. If service nÂ° 27 is
not available in the USIM, the lack of Kc prevents operation with a 2G BSS
when ciphering is active. No ciphering key derivation is done by the ME.
2\. **Service nÂ° 38:** \"GSM Security Context\". This service is required when
a 2G VLR/SGSN and/or a 2G HLR/AuC is involved. The USIM performs 2G AKA, i.e.
it accepts 2G input data and generates 2G output data. From the security point
of view, this behaviour can be characterised as \"**virtual 2G mode** \" (see
below). If service nÂ° 38 is not available in the USIM, 2G AKA is not supported
and network access is impossible with a 2G VLR/SGSN and/or a 2G HLR/AuC.\ \ A
2G VLR/SGSN never goes with a 3G BSS. Hence when a 2G VLR/SGSN is involved,
then a 2G BSS is always part of the transmission chain and service nÂ° 27 is
additionally required, i.e. services nÂ° 27 and nÂ° 38 have to be available at
the same time.
If services nÂ° 27 and nÂ° 38 are not supported by the USIM (which the ME can
detect from the USIM Service Table during the USIM activation procedure)
network access is impossible in a mixed 2G/3G environment, even if a SIM
application is available on the UICC. A 3G ME only accesses the USIM
application on the UICC.
From the security point of view, the compatibility services are connected to
up to three different operation modes (see also Annex B):
\- **Normal 3G mode:** The results of the 3G algorithm are sent to the ME
without any change. The USIM receives RAND and AUTN and responds with RES, CK
and IK. This mode applies if service nÂ° 27 is not available.
\- **3G + Kc mode:** The 2G ciphering key Kc (derived from CK, IK) is
additionally included in the response. The USIM receives RAND and AUTN and
responds with RES, CK, IK and Kc. This requires conversion function c3 to be
supported by the USIM. If service nÂ° 27 is available in the USIM, this mode is
always active and the ME picks the relevant values from the USIM response
according to the present network situation.
\- **Virtual 2G mode:** The USIM receives a 2G authentication request with
RAND and returns a 2G authentication response with SRES (derived from RES) and
ciphering key Kc (derived from CK, IK). This requires a particular algorithm
execution mode plus conversion functions c2 and c3 to be supported by the
USIM. If service nÂ° 38 is available in the USIM, this mode is not always
active. The ME may switch the USIM from normal 3G mode or 3G + Kc mode to
virtual 2G mode by sending a particular command parameter according to the
present network situation.
The services nÂ° 27 and nÂ° 38 are both optional. Network operators can decide
whether to include them into their USIMs and hence to allow network access
with lower security level. It should be noted that this access limitation also
affects emergency call set-up and handover.
## 5.2 2G ME and UICC
As explained in the beginning of paragraph 5, the interworking of this
combination is dependent on the actual specification release, the terminal
complies to.
### 5.2.1 2G ME of Rel-4 (or earlier) without USIM support
A 2G ME of Rel-4 (or earlier) is not required to support a USIM, however in
R99 and Rel-4 this is allowed as an option. If it does not support a USIM,
this combination will only work if a SIM application is provided by the UICC.
TS 11.11 [7] / TS 51.011 [8] applies.
### 5.2.2 2G ME of R99 or Rel-4 with USIM support or of Rel-5
A 2G ME of R99 or Rel-4 can and a 2G ME of Rel-5 must support the UICC and
interwork with a USIM application on it. In this case, the mechanisms
described in section 5.1 above apply with the following additional remark:
The USIM services nÂ° 27 and nÂ° 38 are still optional for the USIM. However, as
a 2G ME can only access a 2G BSS, a 2G ciphering key Kc is always required and
thus service nÂ° 27 becomes mandatory. If further a 2G VLR/SGSN and/or a 2G
HLR/AuC is involved (a common situation in 2G networks), service nÂ° 38 is also
necessary. It is therefore recommended to the card issuer who wants to support
this ME/ICC combination to have both services activated in the USIMs.
## 5.3 3G ME and SIM
This combination is depending on the actual 3GPP release the terminal is
compliant to.
### 5.3.1 3G ME of R99 or Rel-4
A 3G ME of R99 or Rel-4 supports a 2G SIM. For this purpose it has to provide
2G SIM interface in addition to the 3G UICC interface. Access is possible to
both 3G and 2G networks. The services that can be provided in this case may be
limited to GSM like services. It is up to the 3G network operator to accept or
reject the use of GSM SIMs as access modules to his network. TS 11.11 [7] / TS
51.011 [8] applies.
According to 3G TS 21.111 [3] and TS 22.100 [4] a 3G ME does not support a 5V
ME/UICC or a 5V ME/SIM interface. This means that a 3G ME is not compatible
with 5V only SIMs.
### 5.3.2 3G ME of Rel-5
For a 3G ME of Rel-5 support of the 2G SIM is only optional. If this option is
taken (strongly recommended as there are huge quantities of legacy 2G SIMs in
almost all major markets), there is no difference to section 5.3.1. Otherwise
this combination does not work.
## 5.4 2G ME and SIM
This combination is depending on the actual 3GPP release the terminal is
compliant to.
### 5.4.1 2G ME of Rel-4 (or earlier)
This is the well-known 2G case. TS 11.11 [7] / TS 51.011 [8] applies. Access
to 3G networks is not possible with this combination.
### 5.4.2 2G ME of Rel-5
For a 2G ME of Rel-5 support of the 2G SIM is only optional. If this option is
taken (strongly recommended as there are huge quantities of legacy 2G SIMs in
almost all major markets), there is no difference to section 5.4.1. Otherwise
this combination does not work.
# 6 Authentication and key agreement in mixed networks
The authentication and key agreement procedure basically involves five network
components (ICC, ME, BSS, VLR/SGSN and HLR), each of which can be either 2G or
3G. Not all combinations work due to missing compatibility, and some require
specific support by the ICC. The following sections give an overview on the
theoretically possible combinations when a given ICC/ME pair is used. Again,
release-dependent differences on the ME side have to be taken into account. A
summary list is included in Annex A.
## 6.1 With 3G ME and UICC
When both ICC and ME are 3G (i.e. the ICC is a UICC), eight different
combinations (security scenarios) of the other three network components
remain. They are given in the following table:
+-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | Case | ICC | ME | BSS | VLR | HL | Se | F | | | | | | /SGSN | R/AuC | rvice | igure | | | | | | | | | 1 | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 1 | 3G | 3G | 3G | 3G | 3G | yes | A | | | | | | | | | | | | | (any | | | | | | | | | rel | | | | | | | | | ease) | | | | | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 2 | | | 2G | 3G | 3G | yes | B | | | | | | | | 1) 3) | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 3 | | | 3G | 2G | 3G | no | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 4 | | | 2G | 2G | 3G | yes | C | | | | | | | | 2) 3) | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 5 | | | 3G | 3G | 2G | no | F | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 6 | | | 2G | 3G | 2G | yes | E | | | | | | | | 2) 3) | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 7 | | | 3G | 2G | 2G | no | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 8 | | | 2G | 2G | 2G | yes | D | | | | | | | | 2) 3) | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | Note: | | | | | | | | | 1) | | | | | | | | | req | | | | | | | | | uires | | | | | | | | | se | | | | | | | | | rvice | | | | | | | | | nÂ° 27 | | | | | | | | | supp | | | | | | | | | orted | | | | | | | | | by | | | | | | | | | the | | | | | | | | | USIM | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 2) | | | | | | | | | req | | | | | | | | | uires | | | | | | | | | ser | | | | | | | | | vices | | | | | | | | | nÂ° 27 | | | | | | | | | and | | | | | | | | | nÂ° 38 | | | | | | | | | supp | | | | | | | | | orted | | | | | | | | | by | | | | | | | | | the | | | | | | | | | USIM | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 3) | | | | | | | | | only | | | | | | | | | with | | | | | | | | | 2G/3G | | | | | | | | | dual | | | | | | | | | mode | | | | | | | | | ME | | | | | | | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+
**Case 1:** All system elements are 3G and thus capable of handling the
related security mechanisms. 3G AKA is executed and 3G security context
established. The USIM receives parameters RAND and AUTN and responds with RES,
CK and IK.
> NOTE: If service nÂ° 27 is active in the USIM (to support mixed 2G/3G
> scenarios), Kc is generated by conversion function c3 and additionally
> included in the response. However, Kc is not needed in this security
> scenario and can be discarded by the ME.
This scenario is marked with A in figure 1.
**Case 2:** All system elements are 3G, except for the radio interface, which
is 2G. This applies when a 3G subscriber roams into a 2G radio access network,
which is connected to a 3G VLR/SGSN (e.g. when in the start phase of a 3G
network not yet all existing 2G BSS are replaced by 3G technology, while the
VLR/SGSN is already 3G).\ \ 3G AKA is executed. The 2G BSS is transparent for
3G authentication parameters but not capable of handling ciphering and
integrity protection keys CK and IK. Therefore the 3G VLR/SGSN and the 3G ICC
have to compute Kc from CK, IK with conversion function c3 and send it to the
BSS and to the ME. Despite a 2G radio access network is involved, 3G security
context is established. No service with a 3G single mode ME.\ \ The USIM
receives parameters RAND and AUTN and calculates RES, CK and IK. If service nÂ°
27 is available, Kc is generated by conversion function c3 and additionally
included in the response. The keys CK and IK are not needed in this security
scenario and can be discarded by the ME. If the USIM does not support service
nÂ° 27, network access is not possible.\ \ This scenario is marked with B in
figure 1.
**Case 3:** All system elements are 3G, except for the VLR/SGSN which is 2G.
As a 2G VLR/SGSN and a 3G BSS are not compatible, this theoretical combination
cannot exist. No service in this case.
**Case 4:** ME, ICC and HLR/AuC are 3G, BSS and VLR/SGSN are 2G. This applies
when a 3G subscriber roams into a 2G network - a very common case as networks
will introduce 3G technology at different times or not at all.\ \ Upon request
by a 2G VLR/SGSN the 3G HLR/AuC produces 2G triplets RAND, RES, Kc out of 3G
quintets RAND, XRES, CK, IK, AUTN. It therefore applies conversion function c2
to generate RES from XRES and conversion function c3 to generate Kc from CK
and IK. RAND is left unchanged and AUTN is discarded. The 2G triplet is then
sent to the VLR/SGSN. Between the VLR/SGSN and the USIM 2G AKA is executed,
i.e. using RAND in the request and SRES in the response. No service with a 3G
single mode ME.\ \ To handle 2G AKA, the USIM must be capable to accept a
request with RAND and return a response with SRES and Kc. The support of the
virtual 2G mode is indicated by service nÂ° 38 in the USIM Service Table. Since
a 2G BSS is involved, service nÂ° 27 is also necessary. In case the USIM does
not support services nÂ° 27 and nÂ° 38, network access is not possible.\ \ This
scenario is marked with C in figure 1.
Figure 1: Possible interworking scenarios of a 3G ME\ and UICC with different
network environments
**Case 5:** All system elements are 3G, except for the HLR/AuC, which is 2G.
This scenario would result into 2G AKA, but although the necessary conversions
would be technically feasible, this combination is not a valid option as it
would violate a basic security requirement in 3G TS 33.102 [6]: A 3G ME with a
UICC inserted with a USIM activated and attached to a 3G BSS shall only
participate in 3G AKA and shall not participate in 2G AKA. Accordingly the ME
shall deny service in this case.\ \ This scenario is marked with F in figure
1.
> NOTE: There is one main consequence from this scenario: If a network
> operator issues UICCs in order to enable his customers to use a 3G access
> network (at home or while roaming), the related subscriptions should be
> installed in a 3G HLR/AuC. Otherwise authentication will fail as a 3G ME
> should not participate in 2G AKA.
**Case 6:** All system elements are 3G, except for the BSS and the HLR/AuC,
which are 2G. It is possible to keep a 3G subscription in a 2G HLR/AuC,
however on request by a 3G VLR/SGSN this can only deliver 2G triplets RAND,
RES and Kc. The 3G VLR/SGSN is backward compatible and behaves like a 2G
VLR/SGSN: Between the VLR/SGSN and the USIM 2G AKA is executed, i.e. using
RAND in the request and SRES in the response. No service with a 3G single mode
ME.\ \ To handle 2G AKA, the USIM must be capable to accept a request with
RAND and return a response with SRES and Kc. The support of the virtual 2G
mode is indicated by service nÂ° 38 in the USIM Service Table. Since a 2G BSS
is involved, service nÂ° 27 is also necessary. In case the USIM does not
support services nÂ° 27 and nÂ° 38, network access is not possible.\ \ This
scenario is marked with E in figure 1.
**Case 7:** All involved system elements are 3G, except for the VLR/SGSN and
the HLR/AuC, which are 2G. The situation is the same as in case 3 above: As a
2G VLR/SGSN a 3G BSS are not compatible, this theoretical combination cannot
exist. No service in this case.
**Case 8:** ICC and ME are 3G and BSS, VLR/SGSN and HLR/AuC are 2G. The
situation is actually very similar to case 4, but here the 2G HLR/AuC is
delivering the necessary 2G triplets directly. No service with a 3G single
mode ME.\ \ Again this mixed network environment requires the virtual 2G mode
in the USIM, indicated by service nÂ° 38. As a 2G BSS is involved, service nÂ°
27 is also necessary. If the USIM does not support services nÂ° 27 and nÂ° 38,
network access is not possible.\ \ This scenario is marked with D in figure 1.
## 6.2 With 2G ME and UICC
### 6.2.1 2G ME of Rel-4 (or earlier) without USIM support
When the ME is 2G and of Rel-4 (or earlier) and does not support a USIM while
the ICC is 3G (i.e. it is a UICC), this pair will only interoperate if a SIM
application is provided by the UICC. The USIM application is not relevant in
this case. Again eight different combinations of the remaining three network
components are existing. They are given in the following table:
+-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | Case | ICC | ME | BSS | VLR | HL | Se | F | | | | | | /SGSN | R/AuC | rvice | igure | | | | | | | | | 2 | +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 1 | 3G | 2G | 3G | 3G | 3G | no | | | | | | | | | | | | | with | (wi | | | | | | | | | thout | | | | | | | | SIM | USIM | | | | | | | | Appl. | sup | | | | | | | | | port) | | | | | | +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 2 | | | 2G | 3G | 3G | yes | G | | | | | | | | 1) | | +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 3 | | | 3G | 2G | 3G | no | | +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 4 | | | 2G | 2G | 3G | yes | H | | | | | | | | 1) | | +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 5 | | | 3G | 3G | 2G | no | | +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 6 | | | 2G | 3G | 2G | yes | J | | | | | | | | 1) | | +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 7 | | | 3G | 2G | 2G | no | | +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 8 | | | 2G | 2G | 2G | yes | I | | | | | | | | 1) | | +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | Note: | | | | | | | | | 1) No | | | | | | | | | se | | | | | | | | | rvice | | | | | | | | | if | | | | | | | | | UICC | | | | | | | | | does | | | | | | | | | not | | | | | | | | | co | | | | | | | | | ntain | | | | | | | | | a SIM | | | | | | | | | a | | | | | | | | | pplic | | | | | | | | | ation | | | | | | | | +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+
**Cases 1, 3, 5, 7:** A 2G ME cannot interwork with a 3G BSS. Further, in
cases 3 and 7, a 3G BSS does not work in combination with a 2G VLR/SGSN. No
service in these cases.
**Case 2:** ME and BSS are 2G, the rest is 3G. This applies when a 3G
subscriber with a 2G ME roams into a 2G radio access network, which is
connected to a 3G VLR/SGSN (e.g. when in the start phase of a 3G network not
yet all of the existing 2G BSS is replaced by 3G technology, while the
VLR/SGSN is already 3G).\ \ Upon request from a 3G VLR/SGSN, the 3G HLR/AuC
delivers quintets. The VLR/SGSN, as it does not know what type of ME it is
communicating with, forwards RAND and AUTN. The 2G ME simply ignores AUTN,
therefore the UICC only receives RAND and responds with SRES for 2G AKA. After
determination that 2G AKA is to be executed, the 3G VLR/SGSN generates Kc from
CK/IK (conversion function c3) and RES from XRES (conversion function c2). It
then also performs 2G AKA. In the UICC only the SIM application is active.\ \
This scenario is marked with G in figure 2.
**Case 4:** ME, BSS and VLR/SGSN are 2G, ICC and HLR/AuC are 3G. This applies
when a 3G subscriber with a 2G ME roams into a 2G network.\ \ Upon request
from a 2G VLR/SGSN, the 3G HLR/AuC must produce 2G triplets out of 3G
quintets. It therefore applies conversion function c2 to generate RES from
XRES and conversion function c3 to generate Kc from CK, IK. RAND is left
unchanged and AUTN is discarded. The 2G triplet is sent to the VLR/SGSN. The
authentication and key agreement procedure is performed according to 2G
specifications, i.e. using RAND in the request and SRES in the response. In
the UICC only the SIM application is active.\ \ This scenario is marked with H
in figure 2.
Figure 2: Possible interworking scenarios of a 2G ME\ and UICC with different
network environments
**Case 6:** ME, BSS and HLR/AuC are 2G, ICC and VLR/SGSN are 3G. This applies
when e.g. in the start-up phase of a 3G network a UICC (with SIM application)
is introduced as the first migration step, while the rest of the network is
still 2G and a user roams into another starting 3G network with 3G VLR/SGSN
and 2G BSS technology.\ \ Since the 3G VLR/SGSN is transparent for 2G AKA and
the SIM application is active on the UICC, the system works entirely like 2G.\
\ This scenario is marked with J in figure 2.
**Case 8:** ME, BSS, VLR/SGSN and HLR/AuC are 2G, only the ICC is a 3G UICC.
This applies when in the start-up phase of a 3G network a UICC (with SIM
application) is introduced as the first migration step, while the rest of the
network is still 2G. With the UICC virtually being a SIM, this case can be
seen as entirely 2G.\ \ This scenario is marked with I in figure 2.
### 6.2.2 2G ME of R99 or Rel-4 with USIM support or of Rel-5
When the ME is 2G of R99 or Rel-4 with USIM support or of Rel-5 and the ICC is
3G (i.e. it is a UICC), a SIM application on the UICC is not necessary since
the ME can interwork with the USIM. It also supports 3G AKA. Again eight
different combinations of the remaining three network components are existing.
They are given in the following table:
+-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | Case | ICC | ME | BSS | VLR | HL | Se | F | | | | | | /SGSN | R/AuC | rvice | igure | | | | | | | | | 3 | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 1 | 3G | 2G | 3G | 3G | 3G | no | | | | | | | | | | | | | | (with | | | | | | | | | USIM | | | | | | | | | sup | | | | | | | | | port) | | | | | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 2 | | | 2G | 3G | 3G | yes | B\' | | | | | | | | 1) | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 3 | | | 3G | 2G | 3G | no | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 4 | | | 2G | 2G | 3G | yes | C\' | | | | | | | | 2) | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 5 | | | 3G | 3G | 2G | no | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 6 | | | 2G | 3G | 2G | yes | E\' | | | | | | | | 2) | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 7 | | | 3G | 2G | 2G | no | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | 8 | | | 2G | 2G | 2G | yes | D\' | | | | | | | | 2) | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | Note: | | | | | | | | | 1) | | | | | | | | | req | | | | | | | | | uires | | | | | | | | | se | | | | | | | | | rvice | | | | | | | | | nÂ° 27 | | | | | | | | | supp | | | | | | | | | orted | | | | | | | | | by | | | | | | | | | the | | | | | | | | | USIM | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 2) | | | | | | | | | req | | | | | | | | | uires | | | | | | | | | ser | | | | | | | | | vices | | | | | | | | | nÂ° 27 | | | | | | | | | and | | | | | | | | | nÂ° 38 | | | | | | | | | supp | | | | | | | | | orted | | | | | | | | | by | | | | | | | | | the | | | | | | | | | USIM | | | | | | | | +-------+-----+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+
**Cases 1, 3, 5, 7:** A 2G ME cannot interwork with a 3G BSS. Further, in
cases 3 and 7, a 3G BSS does not work in combination with a 2G VLR/SGSN. No
service in these cases.
**Case 2:** All system elements are 3G, except for the terminal and the radio
interface, which are 2G. This applies when a 3G UICC in a 2G ME roams into a
2G radio access network, which is connected to a 3G VLR/SGSN (e.g. when in the
start phase of a 3G network not yet all existing 2G BSS are replaced by 3G
technology, while the VLR/SGSN is already 3G).\ \ The 2G ME with USIM support
or the Rel-5 2G ME and the 2G BSS are transparent for 3G authentication
parameters. To derive the ciphering key Kc for the 2G BSS, the 3G VLR/SGSN and
the 3G ICC have to compute Kc from CK, IK with conversion function c3 and send
it to the BSS and to the ME. Despite a 2G radio access network is involved, 3G
security context is established.\ \ The USIM receives parameters RAND and AUTN
and calculates RES, CK and IK. If service nÂ° 27 is available, Kc is generated
by conversion function c3 and additionally included in the response. The keys
CK and IK are not needed in this security scenario and can be discarded by the
ME. If the USIM does not support service nÂ° 27, network access is not
possible.\ \ This scenario is marked with B\' in figure 3.
**Case 4:** ICC and HLR/AuC are 3G, ME, BSS and VLR/SGSN are 2G. This applies
when a 3G UICC in a 2G ME roams into a 2G network - a very common case as
networks will introduce 3G technology at different times or not at all.\ \
Upon request by a 2G VLR/SGSN the 3G HLR/AuC produces 2G triplets RAND, RES,
Kc out of 3G quintets RAND, XRES, CK, IK, AUTN. It therefore applies
conversion function c2 to generate RES from XRES and conversion function c3 to
generate Kc from CK and IK. RAND is left unchanged and AUTN is discarded. The
2G triplet is then sent to the VLR/SGSN. Between the VLR/SGSN and the USIM 2G
AKA is executed, i.e. using RAND in the request and SRES in the response.\ \
To handle 2G AKA, the USIM must be capable to accept a request with RAND and
return a response with SRES and Kc. The support of the virtual 2G mode is
indicated by service nÂ° 38 in the USIM Service Table. Since a 2G BSS is
involved, service nÂ° 27 is also necessary. In case the USIM does not support
services nÂ° 27 and nÂ° 38, network access is not possible.\ \ This scenario is
marked with C\' in figure 3.
**Case 6:** All system elements are 2G, except for the ICC and the VLR/SGSN,
which are 3G. It is possible to keep a 3G subscription in a 2G HLR/AuC,
however on request by a 3G VLR/SGSN this can only deliver 2G triplets RAND,
RES and Kc. The 3G VLR/SGSN is backward compatible and behaves like a 2G
VLR/SGSN: Between the VLR/SGSN and the USIM 2G AKA is executed, i.e. using
RAND in the request and SRES in the response.\ \ To handle 2G AKA, the USIM
must be capable to accept a request with RAND and return a response with SRES
and Kc. The support of the virtual 2G mode is indicated by service nÂ° 38 in
the USIM Service Table. Since a 2G BSS is involved, service nÂ° 27 is also
necessary. In case the USIM does not support services nÂ° 27 and nÂ° 38, network
access is not possible.\ \ This scenario is marked with E\' in figure 3.
**Case 8:** ICC is 3G, ME, BSS, VLR/SGSN and HLR/AuC are 2G. The situation is
actually very similar to case 4, but here the 2G HLR/AuC is delivering the
necessary 2G triplets directly.\ \ Again this mixed network environment
requires the virtual 2G mode in the USIM, indicated by service nÂ° 38. As a 2G
BSS is involved, service nÂ° 27 is also necessary. If the USIM does not support
services nÂ° 27 and nÂ° 38, network access is not possible.\ \ This scenario is
marked with D\' in figure 3.

network environments
## 6.3 With 3G ME and SIM
This combination is depending on the actual 3GPP release the terminal is
compliant to.
### 6.3.1 3G ME of R99 or Rel-4
Any 3G ME, not only if it is a 2G/3G dual mode ME, is required to work with a
2G SIM. Again eight different combinations of the remaining three network
components are existing. These can be reduced to four, as the technology of
the HLR/AuC is not relevant: A 2G HLR/AuC will always deliver 2G triplets and
a 3G HLR/AuC will do the same because a 2G subscriber (his IMSI is linked to
2G functionality) is involved. The remaining four cases are given in the
following table:
* * *
Case ICC ME BSS VLR/SGSN HLR/AuC Service Figure 3 1 2G 3G 3G 3G 2G or 3G yes K
2 2G 3G yes 1) L 3 3G 2G no  
4 2G 2G yes 1) M Note: 1) 2G/3G dual mode ME required
* * *
**Case 1:** ME, BSS and VLR/SGSN are 3G, the ICC is 2G (i.e. a SIM). This
applies when e.g. a 2G subscriber with a 3G ME roams in a 3G network.\ \ Any
HLR/ AuC will deliver triplets to the 3G VLR/SGSN. The 3G BSS requires CK and
IK, so the VLR/SGSN applies conversion function c3 to generate them from Kc.
The SIM can only perform 2G AKA and returns SRES, Kc to the ME which also
applies c3 to generate CK, IK. Despite the usage of CK and IK, security is
based on Kc, i.e. 2G security context is established.\ \ This scenario is
marked with K in figure 3.
**Case 2:** ME and VLR/SGSN are 3G, ICC and BSS are 2G. This applies when e.g.
a 2G subscriber with 3G ME roams in a 3G network with 2G BSS.\ \ The situation
is like in case 1, except that with a 2G BSS there is no need to derive CK, IK
from Kc in the VLR/SGSN and in the ME. Both, the 3G VLR/SGSN and a 2G/3G dual
mode ME can work with 2G AKA. No service with a 3G single mode ME.\ \ This
scenario is marked with L in figure 3.
**Case 3:** ME and BSS are 3G, ICC and VLR/SGSN are 2G. As a 2G VLR/SGSN and a
3G BSS are not compatible, this theoretical combination cannot exist. No
service in this case.
**Case 4:** ICC, BSS and VLR/SGSN are 2G, the ME is 3G. This applies when e.g.
a 2G subscriber with a 3G ME roams in a 2G network.\ \ 2G AKA is performed
just like in a plain 2G situation. A 2G/3G dual mode ME is transparent for 2G
AKA. No service with a 3G single mode ME.\ \ This scenario is marked with M in
figure 3.
Figure 4: Possible interworking scenarios of a 3G ME\ and SIM with different
network environments
### 6.3.2 3G ME of Rel-5
For a 3G ME of Rel-5 support of the 2G SIM is only optional. If this option is
taken (strongly recommended as there are huge quantities of legacy 2G SIMs in
almost all major markets), there is no difference to section 6.3.1. Otherwise
this combination does not work.
## 6.4 With 2G ME and SIM
This combination is depending on the actual 3GPP release the terminal is
compliant to.
### 6.4.1 2G ME of Rel-4 (or earlier)
This ME/ICC combination results more or less in the \"old\" 2G case. Like in
section 6.3 the HLR/AuC is not relevant, so theoretically 4 cases remain as
given in the following table:
* * *
Case ICC ME BSS VLR/SGSN HLR/AuC Service Figure 4 1 2G 2G 3G 3G 2G or 3G no  
2 2G 3G yes N 3 3G 2G no  
4 2G 2G yes O
* * *
**Case 1:** A 2G ME cannot interwork with a 3G BSS. No service in this case.
**Case 2:** The VLR/SGSN is 3G, the HLR is 2G or 3G and the rest is 2G. The
VLR/SGSN is backwards compatible and enters 2G mode. 2G AKA is executed.\ \
This scenario is marked with N in figure 4.
**Case 3:** A 2G ME cannot interwork with a 3G BSS. Further, a 3G BSS does not
work in combination with a 2G VLR/SGSN. No service in this case.
**Case 4:** The HLR is 2G or 3G and the rest is 2G. There is no difference to
the well-known classic 2G case. 2G AKA is executed.\ \ This scenario is marked
with O in figure 4.
Figure 5: Possible interworking scenarios of a 2G ME\ and SIM with different
network environments
### 6.4.2 2G ME of Rel-5
For a 2G ME of Rel-5 support of the 2G SIM is only optional. If this option is
taken (strongly recommended as there are huge quantities of legacy 2G SIMs in
almost all major markets), there is no difference to section 6.4.1. Otherwise
this combination does not work.
# 7 Interworking between a SIM application and a USIM application on a UICC
A SIM application and a USIM application which are implemented together on a
single UICC can never be active at the same time. Neither can they be switched
from one to the other. Their activity solely depends on the type of ME in
which they are inserted: A 2G ME will always activate the SIM application,
while a 3G ME only uses the USIM application. Hence a direct way of
interworking does not exist.
However, both applications may share certain elements, either to enable an
intended basic subscription mode of the UICC (single or double subscription)
or to optimise memory consumption, but still both applications have to be
virtually independent from a functional point of view. This means that a 2G ME
can interwork with the SIM application without any influence from the USIM,
while a 3G ME finds all the mandatory characteristics of the USIM application.
Naturally, independence ends if one application changes shared data which is
later accessed by the other application because the UICC was inserted into
another type of ME. This has to be taken into account.
The following sections describe the possible options.
## 7.1 IMSI, secret key and authentication algorithm
In the HLR/AuC, a single subscription is identified by a particular IMSI,
which is connected to a particular secret key (given by \"Ki\" for 2G, \"K\"
for 3G) and to one type of authentication algorithm (\"A3/A8\" for 2G,
\"f1-f5\" for 3G). At no time, a single IMSI may be connected to more than one
secret key or algorithm. This is valid for both 2G and 3G contexts. Further,
it applies that
\- Length and Format (IMSI~2G~) = Length and Format (IMSI~3G~)
\- Length (Ki) = Length (K)
\- 2G-Type Algorithm = Part of 3G Algorithm + Conversion Functions c2, c3
For the third \"equation\" see Annex B2 or 3G TS 31.102 [2] and 3G TS 33.102
[6]. This 2G behaviour of the 3G algorithm is the same as the virtual 2G mode
described in section 5.1. If it is always active, e.g. in a SIM application or
in a 2G HLR/AuC, it shall in the following be called a fixed virtual 2G mode.
Then, in fact, it is a 2G algorithm.
There are three possible options for the UICC:
  1. **Separate IMSI & Separate Secret Key:** This case applies if the > network operator - for some reason - wants to administrate the 2G > and the 3G subscription, i.e. the usage of a 2G or 3G ME, fully > independent. The two subscriptions can be maintained in either in > a single 2G or 3G HLR/AuC or in different dedicated 2G and 3G > HLR/AuCs. Then USIM and SIM applications also have to keep > separate IMSIs, i.e. IMSI~3G~ â‰  IMSI~2G~. The secret keys have to > be different as well, i.e. K â‰  Ki. Of course, the algorithms in > the UICC have to correspond to the algorithms associated with the > IMSIs in the HLR/AuCs. The USIM application needs a 3G algorithm, > while for the SIM application it can either be
\- a 2G algorithm on its own or
\- a 3G algorithm in fixed virtual 2G mode. In that case the UICC needs to
implement a 3G algorithm only, which from the SIM application is executed in
2G mode. The HLR/AuC must support this option accordingly.
  1. **Separate IMSI & Shared Secret Key:** From a functional point of > view, this option is identical to option 1, except that the UICC > saves 128 bits for the storage of a second secret key. On the > other hand, the deliberate assignment of the same secret key to > two different IMSIs would require particular solutions during > secret key generation and pre-personalization.
  2. **Shared IMSI & Shared Secret Key:** This case applies if the > network operator wants to have one single subscription for a user, > independent of the usage of a 2G or 3G ME. Consequently the UICC > has to carry the same identification details, i.e. IMSI and secret > key, in both SIM and USIM applications. On the network side there > is a single entry consisting of one IMSI and one secret key in > either a 2G or a 3G HLR/AuC, i.e. IMSI~3G~ = IMSI~2G~ and K = Ki. > In a 2G HLR the algorithm has to be a 3G-type in fixed virtual 2G > mode (a 3G algorithm does not fit into a 2G HLR and a 2G algorithm > does not fit with the USIM application on the UICC) while in a 3G > HLR the algorithm is a 3G-type. On the UICC side there is not much > choice: The USIM application essentially needs a 3G algorithm > while for the SIM application it can only be a 3G-algorithm in > (fixed) 2G mode as there is no 2G-type in the network. Again this > has the advantage of having only one shared 3G algorithm on the > UICC, which from the SIM application is executed in 2G mode.
The fourth theoretical combination, namely shared IMSI & separate secret keys,
is not a valid option as a single IMSI cannot be associated with more than one
secret key simultaneously.
## 7.2 File mapping
When comparing the file structure of a SIM in TS 11.11 [7] / TS 51.011 [8]
with that of a USIM in 3G TS 31.102 [2] it strikes that many not only have the
same name and file identifier (although under different DFs) but are entirely
equal by size and content parameters. This generally allows for memory
efficient implementation of a SIM together with a USIM as these files can be
shared by both applications, i.e. necessary storage capacity is only required
once. Further, shared files speed up the pre-personalization process as they
save valuable programming time.
Therefore files should be mapped as far as possible, i.e. in all cases where
basic properties are equal and identical contents do not conflict with the
access by either a 2G or a 3G ME or with intended subscription differences
when separate IMSIs are used (cases 1 or 2 in section 7.1). Mapping is not
possible, when the content is clearly subscription dependent like in case of
IMSI, Kc, KcGPRS or MSISDN in a double subscription UICC.
Annex C gives an overview on the SIM and USIM files that potentially can be
mapped. A case by case decision should be conducted by the network operator /
card manufacturer for each UICC implementation. Caution: It should be noted
that file identifiers may differ between the SIM and USIM applications, while
all other file properties are exactly the same, e.g. for EF~EXT4~.
## 7.3 Access conditions
If a EF or DF is accessible in both 2G and 3G operation modes (e.g. in the MF:
EF-PL in the UICC can be identical to EF-ELP in the SIM), then independent 2G
and 3G access conditions may be defined for the file. The UICC does not check
the consistency of the access conditions in both modes.
Therefore it is possible that the same EF or DF has different security
attributes in 2G and 3G operation mode. It is the responsibility of the
network operator and the card manufacturer to ensure at the personalisation
stage that the security attributes for 2G and 3G session are the same, if
necessary.
## 7.4 Secret codes
In 3G mode, 8 Application PINs with global key references are available and
the UICC also supports up to 8 Local PINs with specific key references. Local
PINs can only be used within an ADF. Further, up to 10 administrative PINs can
be defined. A replacement PIN, called Universal PIN, may also exist.
In 2G mode, only CHV1 and CHV2 are available. They apply to files in DF-GSM
and DF-TELECOM. Additionally, up to 11 administrative PINs can be defined.
Mapping of PINs between 2G and 3G operation modes, so that activation,
deactivation or changing of a PIN in one operation mode has the same effect in
the other operation mode, follow the following principles:
**\- Mapping of CHV1**
CHV1 in the SIM application can be mapped to any USIM application PIN with a
global key reference (or to the Universal PIN, if the UICC is multi-
verification capable), but to only one at a time.\ \ When the UICC is single-
verification capable, CHV1can only be mapped to a USIM application PIN. Then,
if the USIM application PIN is disabled, the CHV1 is also disabled and vice
versa. See also Annex D.1.\ \ When the UICC is multi-verification capable,
different mappings of CHV1 are possible, depending on the standards release to
which the UICC is compliant to:
**\- Static mapping:** CHV1 is always mapped to a USIM application PIN. If the
USIM application PIN is disabled and replaced by the Universal PIN, then also
CHV1is disabled. Thus when using the USIM, the user will have to verify the
Universal PIN. When using the SIM, there will be no verification. Therefore,
in this case the SIM and the USIM behave differently regarding the PIN/CHV1
verification from the user\'s point of view. Static mapping is only possible
for R99 and REL-4 UICCs. See also Annex D.2.
**\- Dynamic mapping:** CHV1 is mapped to the USIM application PIN but the
mapping can change to the Universal PIN. When the USIM application PIN is
enabled, then CHV1 is also enabled. If the USIM application PIN is disabled
and not replaced, then CHV1 is disabled. If the USIM application PIN is
disabled and replaced by the Universal PIN, then CHV1 is mapped to the
Universal PIN, i.e. the mapping changes from the application PIN to its
replacement. In this case the behaviour of the SIM and the USIM is exactly the
same regarding the PIN/CHV1 verification from the user\'s point of view.
Dynamic mapping is possible for UICCs of any 3G release. See also Annex D.3.
**\- Mapping of CHV2**
CHV2 in the SIM application can be mapped to the corresponding local key
reference belonging to the USIM application to which the CHV1 is mapped. In
the 2G operation mode, this PIN is considered to be global, in the 3G
operation mode, it is seen as a being local. If mapped, then, with respect to
the requirement in TS 11.11 [7] / TS 51.011 [8] for CHV2, this PIN cannot be
disabled in either operation mode. The UICC will return an appropriate error
condition in that case.
**\- Mapping of Local PINs**
A SIM does not support Local PINs, hence there is no correspondence in 2G
operation mode. Local PINs cannot be mapped.
**\- Mapping of administrative PINs**
The mapping of administrative PINs between the 2G and 3G operation modes is
fully under the discretion of each network operator and card manufacturer.
## 7.5 Activation of 2G and 3G operation modes
After a cold reset has been performed (i.e. during UICC activation), the ATR
sent by the UICC is compliant to 3G TS 31.101 [1]. No particular operation
mode is active at this stage. The selection and activation of either 2G
operation mode (i.e. the SIM application) or 3G operation mode (i.e. the USIM
application), is implicitly done by the ME when sending the first command. The
following table describes the different possible cases.
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | UICC / ME\ | **Class Byte |** Resulting | **Remark** | | Combination | of First\ | UICC Operation | | | | Command**| Mode** | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | UICC with or | \'0X\' or | 3G | The USIM | | without a SIM | \'8X\' | | application | | application | | | rejects | | | | | commands with | | in a 3G or | | | class byte = | | 2G/3G dual | | | \'A0\'. | | mode ME | | | | | | | | First command | | or in a 2G ME | | | right after | | of R99 or | | | ATR can be | | Rel-4 with | | | SELECT or | | USIM support | | | STATUS. | | | | | | | or in a 2G ME | | | | | of Rel-5 | | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | UICC with a | \'A0\' | 2G | The SIM | | SIM | | | application | | application | | | rejects | | | | | commands with | | in a 2G ME of | | | class byte = | | Rel-4 or | | | \'0X\' or | | earlier | | | \'8X\'. | | without USIM | | | | | support | | | First command | | | | | right after | | | | | ATR can be | | | | | SELECT, STATUS | | | | | or GET | | | | | RESPONSE. | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | UICC without a | \'A0\' | No operation! | All further | | SIM | | | commands with | | application | | | class byte = | | | | | \'A0\' will be | | in a 2G ME of | | | rejected. | | Rel-4 or | | | | | earlier | | | | | without USIM | | | | | support | | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
A 3G or 2G/3G dual mode ME or a 2G ME of R99 or Rel-4 with USIM support or a
2G ME of Rel-5 will only send commands with class byte = \'0X\' or \'8X\'. A
2G ME of Rel-4 (or earlier) without USIM support will only send commands with
class byte = \'A0\'. The operation mode selection takes place regardless of
the result of the command (i.e. if it was successful or not).
## 7.6 Selection of cyclic files
As the SIM application and the USIM application are based on individual
specifications, a particular difference applies for the selection of cyclic
files.
For the SIM, TS 11.11 [7] / TS 51.011 [8] specifies that \"After selection of
a cyclic file (for either operation), the record pointer shall address the
record updated or increased last.\", whereas for the USIM it is required in 3G
TS 31.101 [1] that \"After a successful selection the record pointer is
undefined.\". In the latter case, the record pointer is set implicitly by the
subsequent access command.
Therefore, in the case of a selection of cyclic files, the UICC will behave
corresponding to its current operation mode, i.e. comply to 2G requirements
when the SIM application is active and to 3G requirements when the USIM
application is active.
A 3G ME shall handle this situation accordingly, i.e. depending on whether a
SIM or a UICC is inserted.
## 7.7 Enabling/disabling procedures for dialling numbers
Enabling/disabling procedures of restricted dialling numbers services (e.g.
FDN or BDN) are different between SIM and USIM. In fact, simply mapping the
files associated with such services between the SIM and USIM will not ensure
consistent behaviour in GSM and 3G modes, and can actually allow the user to
bypass the associated security by switching the UICC between a 2G and a 3G
terminal. Therefore, if a dialling number file (e.g. EF~FDN~ or EF~BDN~) is
mapped between a SIM and a USIM, the corresponding enabling/disabling
procedures should also be linked.
This means that the enabling/disabling of a restricted dialling numbers
service in one mode (SIM or USIM) is reflected in the other mode (respectively
USIM or SIM); i.e. any modification of the activation status of such service
(e.g. FDN or BDN) for the USIM in EF~EST~ should affect the validation status
of the file associated with this service (e.g. EF~ADN~ or EF~BDN~
respectively) for the SIM accordingly, and vice-versa.
The linking mechanism can only apply if the initial conditions are consistent
for interworking, i.e. if the associated service (e.g. FDN or BDN) is
available in the USIM Service Table (EF~UST~) and allocated and activated in
the SIM Service Table (EF~SST~)..
NOTE: If the status of a restricted dialling numbers service is modified Over
The Air in the SIM or USIM Service Table (EF~SST~ or EF~UST~), the linking
mechanism may not be able to maintain the synchronization of the service
status between SIM and USIM.
# 8 Interworking between USIM applications on a UICC
If a UICC contains more than one USIM application, these are normally related
to separate subscriptions, either from the same or from different network
operators. In that case IMSIs and secret keys are different and cannot be
shared. The authentication algorithm may be shared if the nature of the
subscriptions does not require different algorithms.
Concerning the mapping of files between multiple USIMs, only the following
guidelines can be given:
\- If the UICC is intended to be used by a single user, all user relevant
files (that can be updated by the user) could be mapped. The phonebook will
preferably be located under DF TELECOM, to enable global access from all
applications. In a multi-user model, user relevant files should not be mapped
and a specific phonebook will be under each DF USIM.
\- All directly subscription relevant files (like Kc or MSISDN) or those
needed to differentiate the subscriptions should not be mapped.
\- All other files: Mapping depends on conditions of use in a multi-
subscription environment.
If a SIM application is existing in addition to multiple USIM applications,
mapping can be done according to section 7 and Annex C with one of the USIM
applications.
As it is not possible to cover all specific situations that might require
multiple USIMs on a UICC, such design decisions should be taken on a case by
case basis by considering each data field and its possible use.
# 9 SIM and UICC Interworking on the Card/Terminal Interface
The SIM specification in TS 11.11 [7] / TS 51.011 [8] and the UICC/USIM
specification in TS 31.101 [1] contain some different requirements affecting
the physical card/terminal interface.
As the interface behaviour needs to be independent of the applications
supported, a UICC holding both a SIM and a USIM application, or a terminal
accepting both legacy SIM and UICCs, satisfies all the requirements from all
the specifications they are complying with.
TS 11.11 [7] / TS 51.011 [8] and TS 31.101 [1] contain no contradictory
requirements, but the strongest requirements from these two sets of
specifications need to apply.
In particular, such cards and terminals are ready to receive data 12 etus
after they begin sending their last outgoing character (to comply with the SIM
specification) but do not start transmitting outgoing data less than 16 etus
after they begin receiving the last incoming character (to comply with the
USIM specification).
This implies that a 12 etu reception turnaround guardtime is supported at all
speeds supported, as indicated by the card in the ATR,
The highest speed supported is compliant with the requirements of TS 31.101
[1].
The ATR of a 31.101 [1] compliant UICC always includes T=15 parameters. This
applies for a UICC that only contains a USIM application (TS 31.102 [2]), it
applies for a UICC that only contains a SIM application (TS 51.011 [8]) and it
also applies for a UICC that contains both a USIM and a SIM application.
An ATR of a SIM as defined in TS 11.11 [7] may contain these T=15 parameters
even though these parameters are not requested by TS 11.11 [7].
###### ### Annex A: Interworking table
The following table lists the complete set of interworking scenarios
introduced by the two possible types of generation (2G or 3G) with each of the
main network elements involved in authentication and key agreement. These are
ICC, ME, BSS, VLR/SGSN and HLR/AuC.
In each case the function of the network elements is commented when the
behaviour is particular for the case. No comment means that the behaviour is
not special for the purpose of interworking. If a case was identified as not
functional, i.e. interworking fails somewhere through the transmission chain,
this is indicated by grey background. A more detailed explanation of each case
can be found in section 6 of this document. The character in the last column
refers to figures 1 to 4 in section 6.

###### ### Annex B: Features for security interworking
The following sections summarise the features defined to convert security
parameters between 2G and 3G or vice versa. For more information see 3G TS
33.102 [6].
# B.1 Conversion functions
**Conversion function c1** converts a 128 bit 3G random challenge into a 128
bit 2G random challenge. Both values have the same format, i.e. they are
equal.
c1: RAND~2G~ = RAND~3G~
**Conversion function c2** converts a 3G expected authentication response XRES
into a 2G expected authentication response RES (in the AuC or the VLR/SGSN) or
a 3G authentication response RES into a 2G authentication response SRES (in
the USIM).
c2: RES~2G~ = XRES~3G,\ 1~ [xor XRES~3G,\ 2~ [xor XRES~3G,\ 3~ [xor XRES~3G,\
4~]]]
SRES~2G~ = RES~3G,\ 1~ [xor RES~3G,\ 2~ [xor RES~3G,\ 3~ [xor RES~3G,\ 4~]]]
where RES~3G,\ i~ or XRES~3G,\ i~ are 32 bits long and (X)RES~3G~ =
(X)RES~3G,\ 1~ [ \|\| (X)RES~3G,\ 2~ [ \|\| (X)RES~3G,\ 3~ [ \|\| (X)RES~3G,\
4~ ]]] depending on the length of (X)RES~3G~ (a multiple of 32 bit or else be
padded with \"0\"). In the USIM, conversion function c2 must be supported in
connection with conversion function c3 and the ability to execute a
\"reduced\" 3G algorithm. This optional service is indicated by service nÂ° 38
in the USIM Service Table.
**Conversion function c3** converts the 128 bit 3G ciphering and integrity
protection keys CK and IK into the 64 bit 2G ciphering key Kc. This function
is applied in the AuC or VLR/SGSN and in the USIM.
c3: Kc = CK~1~ xor CK~2~ xor IK~1~ xor IK~2~
where CK~i~ and IK~i~ are both 64 bits long and CK = CK~1~ \|\| CK~2~ and IK =
IK~1~ \|\| IK~2~. In the USIM, the optional support of conversion function c3
is indicated by service nÂ° 27 in the USIM Service Table.
**Conversion function c4** converts a 64 bit 2G Kc into a 128 bit 3G CK. This
function is applied in the ME and in the VLR/SGSN.
c4: CK = Kc \|\| Kc
**Conversion function c5** converts a 64 bit 2G Kc into a 128 bit 3G IK. This
function is applied in the ME and in the VLR/SGSN.
c5: IK = (Kc~1~ xor Kc~2~) \|\| Kc \|\| (Kc~1~ xor Kc~2~)
where Kc~i~ are both 32 bits long and Kc = Kc~1~ \|\| Kc~2~.
# B.2 3G algorithm execution modes
The 3G algorithm in the USIM consists of five sub-functions that have to be
executed in order to verify the received data and generate the necessary
responses. For more information see 3G TS 31.102 [2] and 3G TS 33.102 [6].
In **normal 3G mode** the input is given by RAND and AUTN. The USIM computes
\- f5 to get the anonymity key AK. AK is then used to retrieve the sequence
number SQN.
\- f1 to derive XMAC. XMAC is then used to verify the authenticity of the home
environment.
\- f2 to calculate the 3G authentication response RES
\- f3 to get the 3G ciphering key CK
\- f4 to get the 3G integrity protection key IK
The USIM returns RES, CK and IK.
In **3G + Kc mode** the input is also given by RAND and AUTN. The USIM
computes the same sequence of functions but in the end applies conversion
function c3 to generate a 2G Kc from CK and IK. The USIM returns RES, CK, IK
and Kc. Kc is always returned if this mode is active in the USIM. If not
needed, the ME may discard the additional Kc.
In **virtual 2G mode** the input is only given by RAND. The USIM skips
functions f5 and f1 and only executes f2, f3 and f4 (\"reduced\" 3G
algorithm). Subsequently it applies conversion function c3 to generate 2G Kc
from CK, IK and conversion function c2 to generate 2G SRES from RES. The USIM
returns SRES and Kc. The ME can require the USIM to operate in this mode by
sending a specific command parameter. If it is not supported by the USIM, an
error indication is returned.
NOTE: The 3G algorithm in 2G mode is virtually (i.e. by input and output)
identical to a 2G algorithm. A UICC with USIM and SIM applications may make
use of that and implement a 3G algorithm only, which from the SIM application
is executed in 2G mode.
###### ### Annex C: SIM/USIM file mapping table
The following table lists all SIM and USIM files that can be mapped in a UICC.
It should be noted that most files are optional and these files are not
necessarily present in the SIM or USIM application. Files not mentioned do not
have a corresponding file in both applications. Mapping with multiple USIMs is
not considered.

###### ### Annex D: CHV mapping
This annex illustrates the possible CHV mappings for a single-verification
capable and a multi-verification capable UICC. In the diagrams D.2 and D.3,
the gray box highlights the difference between the two solutions.
# D.1 In a single-verification capable UICC
# D.2 In a multi-verification capable UICC (static mapping)
# D.3 In a multi-verification capable UICC (dynamic mapping)
