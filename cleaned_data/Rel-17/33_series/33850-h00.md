# 4 Overview of Multicast-Broadcast Services (MBS)
5G system aims to enable general Multicast-Broadcast Service (MBS), e.g.
public safety, V2X application, group communications and IoT applications,
etc.
As in LTE, 5G MBS service also have two modes: Transport Only Mode in which
the multicast and broadcast contents are transparent to the 3GPP network
functions, and Full Service Mode in which the 3GPP network functions are aware
of the contents.
Two delivery methods are envisioned for 5G MBS service, from the view point of
5G core network (5GC): 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method, and 5GC
shared MBS traffic delivery method. For the former, 5GC receives a single copy
of MBS data packets and delivers separate copies of those MBS data packets to
individual UEs via per-UE PDU sessions, while for the latter, 5G CN receives a
single copy of MBS data packets and delivers a single copy of those MBS
packets packet to a RAN node, which then delivers them to one or multiple UEs.
RAN delivers MBS data to UEs using either Point-to-Point delivery or Point-to-
Multipoint (PTM) delivery.
The study item includes security aspects on multicast and broadcast service:
\- Security of authentication and authorization for multicast communication
services
\- Security protection of MBS traffic
\- Security protection of key distribution
\- Security protection between AF and 5GC
NOTE: Different solutions may use different nomenclature for the Service
Functionality MBSF/MBSTF, e.g. both MBSF and MBSTF or MBSF-C and MBSF-U.
# 5 Key issues
## 5.1 Key issue #1: Security of authentication and authorization for
multicast communication services
### 5.1.1 Key issue details
Architecture enhancements for 5G MBS services have been studied in TR 23.757
[2]. Two reference architectures for 5G MBS are proposed. Compared to the MBS
architecture for LTE and before as specified in TS 23.246 [4], 5G MBS
architecture differ, among others, in that MBS signalling is flowing through
the control plane of 3GPP. Figure 1a and 1b shows the MBS architecture for LTE
and before in TS 23.246 [3], and Figure A.1.2-1 and A.2.2-1 in TR 23.757 [2]
shows the MBS architecture alternatives for 5G.
TS 33.246 [3] specifies the security for the MBS for LTE and before. It is
required that a UE is authenticated and authorised such that only legitimate
users are able to participate in a MBS service. In addition, KI#3 from TR
23.757 [2] is describing authorization for multicast communication services
for 5G, which addresses the following security-related issues:
> _5.3.1 Description_
>
> _The 5GS is expected to support different use cases of multicast services.
> The mobile network operators (MNO) and/or application service providers
> (ASP) may want to provide different levels of authorization (e.g. at session
> or service level) for the UE to access multicast communication services._
>
> _This key issue will study the following aspects:_
>
> _\- Define and study how to support the necessary level(s) of authorization
> for UEs to access multicast communication services._
>
> _\- How can a UE join/leave (including authorised or revoked to access) a
> multicast communication service?_
How that authentication and authorization is realized in the new architecture
for 5Gmulticast communication service needs to be studied. The necessary
level(s) of authorization could be needed for UEs to access multicast
communication services.
### 5.1.2 Security threats
If authentication for multicast communication service is not supported, an
attacker may spoof a legitimate UE to gain access to a MBS service. If
authorization for multicast communication service is not supported, an
attacker may gain free access to content without any knowledge of the service
provider. In addition, an attacker may use the 3GPP network to gain \"free
access\" of MBS services and other services on another user\'s bill.
### 5.1.3 Potential security requirements
The 5GS shall support the authentication and authorization for multicast
communication service.
## 5.2 Key Issue #2: Security protection of MBS traffic
### 5.2.1 Key issue details
According to TR 23.757 [2], MBS traffic needs to be delivered from application
service provider to multiple UEs through 5GS. Depending on many factors,
multiple delivery methods may be used to deliver MBS traffic. As described in
clause 4.4 of TR 23.757 [2], Shared PTP or PTM delivery method and Individual
delivery method may be used at the same time for a 5G MBS session depending on
selected solution.
The 5GS may provide multiple interfaces for transferring MBS data between UE
and external services/networks, such as Uu, N3, N6. MBS traffic need to be
properly protected especially in air interface. While it is still possible to
support security for multicast/broadcast traffic at the application layer, it
is necessary to consider a security natively provided by the 5G system for the
following reasons: There would be multicast/broadcast services that do not
have application level security (e.g., due to protocol overhead) but want to
leverage the security provided by 5G system, such as the MBS services provided
by operators (e.g., for IoT devices).
As a result, MBS protection independent of application layer protection is to
be studied in this key issue. This key issue investigates security protection
of 5G MBS PDU sessions/flows at the transport or service level. In **Transport
layer** , the service is provided by the 5G system to deliver multicast
datagrams to multiple receivers using minimum network and radio resources,
while the **service layer is** fully separate from the transport layer. This
allows for applications that do not require a service layer to establish a
multicast transport directly via Nnef (control plane and N6 (user plane data).
### 5.2.2 Security threats
Attackers may eavesdrop MBS traffic on the air-interface. Users that have not
joined and activated a MBS service receiving that service without being
charged.
Modifications and replay of messages in a way to fool the user of the content
from the actual source, e.g. replace the actual content with a fake one.
### 5.2.3 Potential security requirements
The 5GS shall support the confidentiality protection, integrity protection,
and anti-replay protection of MBS traffic.
## 5.3 Key Issue #3: Security protection of key distribution
### 5.3.1 Key issue details
MBS introduces the concept of a point-to-multipoint service into a 3GPP
system. MBS traffic is delivered from application service provider to multiple
UEs through 5GS. To securely transmit data to a given set of users, the MBS
traffic needs to be protected to mitigate the potential attacks. As the
security fundamental basis, the keys for protection of MBS traffic are
required.
Compared with UE keys, the keys for protection of MBS traffic are one-to-many
keys. When UE joins the MBS session, only authorized users are able to receive
the keys delivered from the key generator for protection of MBS traffic. UEs
might also leave an MBS session or be compromised.
### 5.3.2 Security threats
If the keys for protection of MBS traffic are not confidentiality protected,
an attacker may use the 3GPP network to gain \"free access\" of MBS services.
If the keys for protection of MBS traffic are not integrity or anti-replay
protected, the authorised users may not be able to acquire the MBS traffic
properly.
If the keys for protecting the MBS traffic cannot be updated, then:
\- If a device in the group leaves, the device might be able to access the
content after leaving.
\- If a device joins the group, the device might be able to access previous
content.
\- If a device in the group is malicious, the device might be able to inject
fake content.
### 5.3.3 Potential security requirements
The distribution of the keys for protection of MBS traffic between the key
generator and the UE shall be confidentiality, integrity and anti-replay
protected.
The 5GS shall be able to update the keys used to protect the MBS traffic.
## 5.4 Key Issue # 4: Security protection between AF and 5GC
### 5.4.1 Key issue details
The adopted baseline architecture in TR 23.757 [2] provides the Network
Functions including MBSF and NEF at Service Layer and exposure to Application
Function. MBSF User Plane Function is denoted MBSF-U and MBSF Control Plane
Function is denoted MBSF-C. These NFs support external exposure of
capabilities to AF and interaction with provider.
The reference architecture provides the configuration variants for AF
interaction with 5G Core Network, usage of NEF or MBSF-C in the control plane,
and usage of N6, MB2-C or xMB-U in user plane. Three configuration options are
descripted including (1) No MBSF, (2) MBSF, N33 towards AF and (3) MBSF,
MB2-C/xMB-C towards AF. The protection between AF and NEF/MBSF-C/MBSF-U is
needed.
### 5.4.2 Security threats
If the interface between 5GC and AF is not well protected, the attacker may
eavesdrop, modify or replay the message. In addition, the deliberated
manipulation of the data between the 5GC and AF may disturb the communication.
If mutual authentication between 5GC and AF is not supported, the attacker may
impersonate the actual source and publish fake content.
### 5.4.3 Potential security requirements
Integrity protection, replay protection and confidentiality protection for
communication between 5GC and AF shall be supported.
Mutual authentication between 5GC and AF shall be supported.
The 5GC shall be able to determine whether the AF is authorized to interact
with the relevant Network Functions.

## 6.1 Solution #1: Protection of MBS traffic in transport layer
### 6.1.1 Solution overview
This solution addresses Key Issue 2&3 to support the secure MBS traffic
delivery from context provider to multiple UEs through 5GS. The keys for
protection of MBS traffic are generated in the RAN nodes and distributed to
UEs. The UEs, which belong to a multicast group, acquire the same keys in the
RAN node. The security protection is enabled in transport layer.
### 6.1.2 Solution details
#### 6.1.2.0 Procedures
**Figure 6.1.1-1: The procedure to protect MBS traffic in transport layer**
The procedure is described as follows:
1\. The UE registers in 5GS and establishes a PDU session.
2\. The content provider announces the availability of multicast using higher
layers (e.g., application layer).
3\. The UE sends the PDU Session Modification Request. Information about
multicast group including identifier of the multicast group, which UE wants to
join, shall be sent. Multicast_group_ID can be multicast address or other
identifiers.
4\. The AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext, in which information
about multicast group is included. The SMF checks whether the UE is authorized
to receive the requested multicast service based on the UE\'s subscription
information.
5\. If MBS context is not available in (MB-)SMF, (MB-)SMF interacts with UDM
to check whether a multicast context for the multicast group exists in the
system.
6\. (MB-)SMF requests the AMF to transfer a message to the RAN node using the
Namf_N1N2MessageTransfer service to create a multicast context in the RAN, if
it does not exist already. In addition, the SMF sends a security policy for
the multicast service to the gNB via AMF. Security policy indicates whether
confidentiality and/or integrity protection needs to be activated or not for
all bearers belonging to that MBS service.
7\. The N2 session modification request is sent to the RAN, in which
information about multicast group and the security policy is included.
8\. RAN check whether the MBS security context for this multicast group is
available. MBS security context, which is used for MBS traffic protection,
includes the key_ID, K_group_enc, K_group_int, encryption and integrity
algorithms. The key_ID is the key identifier and associated with the
K_group_enc and K_group_int. K_group_enc and K_group_int are used for
encryption and integrity protection of MBS traffic respectively.
If not, RAN generates K_group and derives the K_group_enc and K_group_int. The
encryption and integrity algorithms are selected. The MBS security context is
stored until all the UEs in the multicast group have left the RAN.
NOTE 1: The K_group generation method is randomly generated by the RAN node
when needed.
NOTE 2: The RAN node should update K_group to ensure that the same PDCP COUNT
value is not used multiple times to encrypt and/or integrity protect the MRB
traffic..
9\. The MBS security context is distributed from RAN to UE. The RRC
Reconfiguration message further contains the current PDCP COUNT value for the
K_group.
NOTE 3: Inclusion of the current PDCP COUNT value in RRC Reconfiguration
message is to ensure the UE of the current multicast PDCP COUNT at the time of
joining the multicast PDU session since PDCP PDU header does not carry the
full PDCP PDU count value.
10\. UE receives and stores the MBS security context for the multicast group.
11\. Continue with the multicast service initiation procedure. Then, the UE
decrypts and/or checks the integrity of PDCP PDUs sent over the K_group based
on the security policy.
NOTE 4: The support for mobility of UEs is addressed in other solutions.
#### 6.1.2.1 Security handling in handover
In handover, if a UE has established an MBS PDU session and the corresponding
bearer(s) (i.e., MRB(s)) with the source RAN node, the MRB(s) needs to be
handed over to the target RAN node. There are two handover scenarios that need
to be considered.
\- If the target RAN node has already created an MBS security context for the
MBS PDU session that the UE has established with the source RAN node, the
target RAN node provides the MBS security context to the UE via the source RAN
node.
NOTE: It is possible that the target RAN node creates an MBS security context
for the MBS PDU session when it has received a Handover request from the
source RAN node.
If the target RAN node has not created the MBS security context associated
with the MBS PDU session, the target RAN node configures the DRB(s) for the
MBS PDU session for the UE and provides this configuration information to the
UE via the source RAN node. The security activation status of DRB(s) is same
as the security activation status of MRB(s) for the MBS PDU session.
The above security handling of MBS traffic during the handover is applicable
to both Xn-based and N2-based Handover procedures.
### 6.1.3 Solution evaluation
This solution fulfils the potential security requirements for the key
issue#2&3\. This solution provides the protection for the MBS traffic in
transport layer between the RAN node and the UE.
K_group_enc and K_group_int are one-to-many keys to protect the MBS traffic,
and are distributed and updated in a secure way.
This solution assumes that the UE within the multicast group all support the
encryption and integrity algorithms selected by the RAN.
## 6.2 Solution #2: protect MBS traffic in service layer
### 6.2.1 Solution overview
This solution addresses Key Issue 2&3 to support the secure MBS traffic
delivery from context provider to multiple UEs through 5GS. In the agreed
architecture in TR 23.757 [2], the MBSF-U (Multicast/Broadcast Service
Function-User plane) is defined as a new entity to handle the payload part to
cater for the service level functions and management. MBSF-C
(Multicast/Broadcast Service Function-Control plane) is defined as a new
entity to functionality to handle the control plane signalling. This solution
protects the MBS traffic between the MBSF-U in the operator domain and the UE.
It is independent to the protection in the application layer from the content
provider.
The keys for protection of MBS traffic are generated in the SMF. Afterwards,
the keys are distributed to UEs and MBSF-U respectively. The UEs, which
belongs to a multicast group, acquire the same keys in the MBSF-U. The keys
can be updated in an efficient way.
### 6.2.2 Solution details
**Figure 6.2.2-1.The procedure to protect MBS traffic in service layer**
The procedure is described as follows:
1\. The UE registers 5GS and establishes a PDU session.
2\. The content provider announces the availability of multicast using higher
layers (e.g., application layer).
3\. The UE sends the PDU Session Modification Request. Information about
multicast group including identifier of the multicast group which UE wants to
join, is sent. Multicast_group_ID can be multicast address or other
identifier.
4\. The AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext, in which information
about multicast group is included.
NOTE 1: It is out of scope of the present document whether the network and UE
support multicast session join/leave operation via UP e.g. IGMP Join/Leave.
5\. If MBS context is not available in (MB)-SMF, (MB)-SMF interacts with
UDM/UDR to check whether a multicast context for the multicast group exists in
the system.
6\. (MB)-SMF requests the AMF to transfer a message to the RAN node using the
Namf_N1N2MessageTransfer service to create a multicast context in the RAN, if
it does not exist already. IP address of MBSF-C may be included if needed for
UE to find MBSF-C.
7\. The N2 session modification request is sent to the RAN.
8\. RAN sends RRC reconfiguration request message to UE.
9\. If UE is allowed to access the MBS service, UE derives Multicast User Key
(MUK). The input key KEY is Kausf. The parameters are used to form the input
string to the KDF including Multicast_group_ID.
This solution assumes that MUK update and re-authentication are independent.
If reauthentication is performed, the UE still uses the current MUK. The UE
will also try to process the MBS traffic with its known group key to avoid
introducing unnecessary delays. The MUK and group key may be updated based on
update policy after re-authentication.
NOTE 2: The details of MUK derivation will be discussed in the normative work.
NOTE 3: Depending on which solutions are concluded to be chosen for KI#1 and
KI#3, the details related to \"reauthentication\" and \"protection of MBS
traffic\" and \"MUK/group key update\" might need to be adapted. This can be
left to normative phase.
10\. (MB)-SMF requests MUK and sends Multicast_group_ID to AUSF.
11\. AUSF derives Multicast User Key (MUK) based on Kasuf and
Multicast_group_ID. When re-authentication runs, the AUSF is not required to
generate a new MUK immediately. The MUK is derived when request is received
from SMF.
12\. AUSF responds to SMF with MUK.
13\. (MB)-SMF distributes MUK to MBSF-C.
14\. MBSF-C receives and stores the MUK. Afterwards, ACK is responded to SMF.
15\. Continue with the multicast service initiation procedure.
16\. MBSF-C checks whether the MBS security context for this multicast group
is available. MBS security context, which is used for MBS traffic protection,
includes the key_ID, K_group_enc, K_group_int, encryption and integrity
algorithms. The key_ID is used to indicate which key pair is used. K_group_enc
and K_group_int are used for encryption and integrity protection of MBS
traffic respectively.
If not, MBSF-C generates K_group and derives the K_group_enc and K_group_int.
The encryption and integrity algorithms are selected.
The MBS security context is distributed from MBSF-C to MBSF-U.
17\. UE calculates token based on MUK and requests traffic key to MBSF-C. The
token is secured with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes
(MAC). The input parameter includes UE_id, Multicast_group_ID, and fresh
parameters.
18\. MBSF-C verifies the token using MUK and distributes the MBS security
context to UE if succeeded.
NOTE 4: If roaming aspect is supported, MUK is calculated in home network.
> The above text describes the security handling when SMF and MB-SMF are co-
> located. If SMF and MB-SMF are deployed separately, MB-SMF requests MUK from
> AUSF and distributed MUK to MBSF-C.
### 6.2.2.1 MBS group key distribution and update
This clause explains the logic of steps 18a and 18b in Figure 6.2.2-1 to
support MBS group key distribution and update based on the two approaches
described in Solution #9.
**Default approach:**
This default approach uses only Step 18a.
Step 18a relies on K=K_group, i.e., this message is used to directly update
K_group by means of MUK.
**Communication optimized approach:**
The distribution and update of the group key is done by means of the two
messages shown in Steps 18a and 18b:
\- Message 18a: in this message, K=K_transport_i and is used to provide the UE
with the key transport for the set it belongs to protected with the UE\'s MUK.
Upon reception, a UE first verifies the message authentication code, and if it
is correct, it decrypts its transport key. Freshness can be achieved in
multiple ways. For instance, an increasing initialization vector can be used
that depends on the initial access token exchanged in Step 17.
\- Message 18b: the new group key is distributed by protecting it with the
transport keys in a point-to-point or in multicast messages. The hash of the
new group key H is included in this message.
Upon reception, a UE first searches the part of the message that is addressed
to its set. For instance, if the UE belongs to set z, the UE needs to look for
E~K_transport_z~{K_group}. Then, the UE verifies the message authentication
code, and if it is correct, it decrypts the new group key. Freshness can be
achieved by using the same freshness counter as used for the distribution of
MBS traffic. Finally, the UE also checks whether the hash of the decrypted key
equals the hash H of the group key that is appended at the end of this
message.
These two messages 18a and 18b can be combined to address different
situations:
1\. Initial key distribution to a UE: the UE is provided with its transport
key and the group key in a same message combining 18a and 18b.
2\. Key update triggered by a too long usage of key group: Message 18b is used
to distribute a new group key to all UEs.
3\. Key update triggered by a new device joining the group: Message 18a is
used to deliver the corresponding transport key to the new UE. Then, Message
18b is used to distribute a new group key to all UEs.
4\. Key update triggered by a UE leaving/being revoked: If a UE leaves or is
revoked, its transport key associated to its set and the group key are
compromised. To deal with this situation, Message 18a is sent to the L-1 UEs
in its set to update the transport key. Afterwards, message 18b is used to
distribute a new group key to all UEs.
### 6.2.3 Solution evaluation
The solution fulfils the potential security requirements given in the key
issues#2&3\. This solution protects the MBS traffic in service layer between
the MBSF-U in the operator domain and the UE.
MUK is UE-specific key derived based on Kausf and Multicast_group_ID. K_group
is a one-to-many key to protect the MBS traffic, and is distributed and
updated in user plane in a secure way.
This solution requires a new security protocol between the UE and the MBSF-C
for mutual authentication and transport of the MBS keys.
This solution assumes that the UE within the multicast group all support the
encryption and integrity algorithms selected by the MBSF-C.
NOTE: Further evaluation is not addressed in the present document.
## 6.3 Solution #3: MBS Traffic Protection
### 6.3.1 Solution overview
This solution addresses both KI#2 and KI#3. It is based on the converged
architecture in TR 23.757 [2] which is concluded as the adopted architecture
for 5G MBS.
According to TR 23.757 [2], in the adopted architecture, the MBSTF (Multicast
Broadcast Service Transport Function ) and MBSF(Multicast Broadcast Service
Function ) are two functional components introduced at Service Layer. MBSTF is
the media anchor for MBS data, performs generic packet transport
functionalities such as framing, packet encoding, etc. MBSF provides service
level functionality to support MBS, interacts with AF and MB-SMF for session
operations and transport, controls MBSTF, and etc. Both MBSTF and MBSF belong
to the operator domain.
In this solution, the MBS traffic is protected between the MBSTF and the UE,
and the protection is transparent to the content provider. MBS Traffic Key
(MTK) is generated by MBSF and securely distributed to the MBSTF and the UEs
through the control plane. MBSTF uses the MTK to protect the MBS traffic
before sending them out to the UE.
### 6.3.2 Solution details
Figure 6.3.2-1 shows the call flow for secure MTK distribution and multicast
data protection. The call flow in Figure 6.3.2-1 is based on the concluded
multicast call flow in TR 23.757 [2]. In the call flow MB-SMF is another
functional component introduced in the adopted architecture in TR 23.757 [2].
MB-SMF is used for MBS session management (including QoS control), control of
MBS transport, and etc. MB-SMF may be standalone or co-located with existing
network function.
Figure 6.3.2-1: MBS key distribution
Step 1. The AF of the content provider provisions to the MBSF the information
on a multicast session including the multicast group ID and the security
policy for the multicast session. The multicast group ID, which identifies the
multicast session, can either be a TMGI or source specific IP multicast
address. The NEF is involved in the provision if the content provider belongs
to a 3^rd^ party.
Step 2. If the security policy indicates the multicast session needs security
protection, MBSF will generate a MTK and the associated key identifier (KID)
for the multicast session. MBSF sends a request message including the
multicast group ID to request MB-SMF to reserve source for the session. MBSF
also provisions the MTK and the KID to MB-SMF in the request message.
MTK needs to be different for each multicast session, therefore, the multicast
group ID may be used to generate MTK. The KID consists of a Key Domain ID and
a MTK ID. The Key Domain ID is MCC\|\| MNC. A MTK ID is a number that is
different for each MTK.
Step 3. MBSF sends the security policy and the MTK and KID to MBSTF.
Step 4. There are other steps defined in concluded multicast call flows in TR
23.757 [2] for the multicast session configuration at the core network (e.g.
RAN configuration), the details of which are omitted in this solution as they
are irrelevant to solving the key issue #2 and #3.
Step 5. To join a multicast group via control plane, UE sends to SMF the
request for a PDU session establishment/modification and includes in the
request the multicast group ID the UE wishes to join.
Step 6. SMF sends to MB-SMF a request for the contexts of the multicast
session identified by the multicast group ID.
Step 7. MB-SMF replies to SMF with MTK and KID in the response message.
Step 8. There are other steps for the PDU session establishment/modification
(e.g. N4 session creation or modification).
Step 9. SMF sends the received MTK and the KID to UE.
Step 10. When the multicast data of the session identified by the multicast
group ID is received at MBSTF, MBSTF uses the received MTK to protect the
multicast data if the received security policy from step 3 indicates security
policy is needed. The protected multicast data along with the KID are sent to
the UE. Based on the received KID, the UE uses the received MTK in step 9 to
decrypt the protected multicast data and/or verify the integrity of the
protected multicast data.
When multicast data is protected at the service layer, the protection of
multicast data at the transport layer may not be needed. In this case SMF
sends the user plane policy indicating \"Not needed\" to RAN. SMF may become
aware of the protection at the service layer via local configuration or the
reception of MTK at step 7.
### 6.3.3 Solution evaluation
In the solution, the multicast data protection is performed between UE and
MBSTF, the anchor point of the multicast data. This is similar to the MBS
protection before 5G, in which the protection is performed between BM-SC (the
data anchor) and UE.
The MTK and KIDï¼Œused for the multicast data protection, is generated by MBSF
when needed and securely distributed to UE over the control plane, and to
MBSTF. The solution conforms to the call flows concluded in TR 23.757 [2].
The solution does not affect RAN or UPF or MB-UPF. Moreover, during the
transmission of the multicast data, the solution exposes the unprotected
multicast data to the least network functions possible, i.e. only MBSTF has
access to the unprotected multicast data.
The protection provided by the solution is transparent to UE mobility.
The solution does not rely on GBA or AKMA.
NOTE: Further evaluation is not addressed in the present document.
## 6.4 Solution #4: Authentication and authorization for multicast
communication service
### 6.4.1 Solution overview
This solution, which is based on existing EAP based secondary authentication,
addresses the key issue #1 Security of authentication and authorization for
multicast communication service. This solution also comprises authorization
revocation aspects. The solution is based on the concluded architecture in TR
23.757 [2].
### 6.4.2 Solution details
#### 6.4.2.0 General
In the solution below, the (MB-)SMF is either SMF, which is for managing in
the MBS session, controlling of MBS transport and etc, or SMF for managing the
per-UE PDU session. The two may be co-located.
#### 6.4.2.1 Authentication and authorization
Figure 6.4.2-1: Authentication and authorization procedure
1\. UE initiates multicast session join, specifically, UE sends the request
for a PDU session establishment/modification and includes the multicast
session ID identifying the multicast session that UE wishes to join. The
request is forwarded to the (MB-)SMF.. The multicast session ID can either be
a TMGI (Temporary Mobile Group Identifier) or a source specific IP multicast
address.
If not available locally, the (MB-)SMF retrieves the subscription data from
the UDM.
2\. The (MB-)SMF determines that authentication and authorization is needed
for the multicast session based on the subscription data.
3\. The (MB-)SMF sends a message to the UE to request the EAP identity used
for the multicast session authentication and authorization. The message
includes the multicast session ID.
4\. The UE responds with the EAP identity and the multicast session ID to
(MB-)SMF.
To avoid the round-trip in step 3 and 4, the UE may also send the EAP identity
in step 1, similar to the EAP based secondary authentication by an external
DN-AAA server in 33.501.
5-6. The (MB-)SMF sends the received EAP identity and multicast session ID to
the AAA server through a (MB-)UPF.
7\. EAP messages are exchanged between the AAA server and UE.
8\. After the successful completion of the authentication procedure, the AAA
server sends EAP Success message to the (MB-)SMF.
9\. (MB-)SMF sends the EAP access and the multicast session ID to the UE.
NOTE: SMF and MB-SMF may or may not be co-located. If they are co-located, the
above procedure apparently applies. If they are not, the above procedure still
applies with the adaptation that (MB-)SMF is replaced with MB-SMF and the
communication between MB-SMF and UE is via SMF.
#### 6.4.2.2 Authorization revocation
Figure 6.4.2-2: Authentication Revocation procedure
Step 1: AAA Server sends to (MB-)UPF the request to revoke UE\'s authorization
to use the multicast communication service. The multicast service ID and UE ID
is included. The multicast service ID may be a TMGI (Temporary Mobile Group
Identifier) or a source specific IP multicast address. UE ID may be GPSI or UE
IP address.
Step 2: (MB-)UPF sends to (MB-)SMF the request to revoke UE\'s authorization
to use the multicast communication service, including the received UE ID and
multicast service ID.
Step 3: (MB-)SMF may release the corresponding session for the multicast
service.
Step 4: (MB-)SMF sends the response to (MB-)UPF, including UE ID and multicast
service ID.
Step 5: (MB-UPF) sends the response the AAA Server, including the received UE
ID and multicast service ID.
NOTE: SMF and MB-SMF may or may not be co-located. If they are co-located, the
above revocation procedure apparently applies. If they are not, the above
revocation procedure still applies with the adaptation that in (MB-)SMF is
replaced with MB-SMF and in step 3, MB-SMF requests SMF to release the
corresponding PDU session.
### 6.4.3 Solution evaluation
This solution addresses KI#1 \"Security of authentication and authorization
for multicast communication service\". It re-uses the EAP based secondary
authentication and authorization in TS 33.501[6] with the adaptation that a
TMGI or a source specific IP multicast address is used to identify a multicast
service.
NOTE: Further evaluation is not addressed in the present document.
## 6.5 Solution #5: Authorization revocation
### 6.5.1 Solution overview
This solution proposes how the authorization revocation is performed, for
KI#1. When the content provider decides that the user authorization for a
multicast service needs to be revoked, the content provider will inform the
UDM/UDR about the revocation. The UDM/UDR will accordingly instructs the SMF
to release the corresponding resources established for the user for the
multicast service.
### 6.5.2 Solution details
In the solution below, the (MB-)SMF is either the MB-SMF, which is for
managing in the MBS session, controlling of MBS transport and etc., or the SMF
for managing the per-UE PDU session. MB-SMF and SMF may be co-located.
Figure 6.5.2-1: Authorization revocation
0\. The AF of the content provider provisions the information on the multicast
session including the authorization information to the UDM/UDR. The NEF is
involved in the provisioning if the content provider belongs to a 3^rd^ party.
1\. The UE has successfully joined a multicast session.
2\. The (MB-)SMF subscribes to the UDM/UDR on the changes of the multicast
information including the authorization information. Step 2 may also be
performed during step 1. (MB-)SMF may get data from UDR via UDM/PCF/NEF.
3\. The content provider updates the multicast information. The NEF is
involved in the provisioning if the content provider belongs to a 3^rd^ party.
4\. The UDM/UDR notifies the (MB-)SMF when the authorization for a UE to join
the multicast service/application is revoked. The multicast session ID and UE
identifier (i.e. SUPI) is included in the notification. The multicast session
ID can either be a Temporary Mobile Group Identifier (TMGI) or a source
specific IP multicast address.
5\. The (MB-)SMF may release the PDU session for the multicast session
identified by the received multicast session ID if no UE is left using the
multicast session.
When a UE decides to revoke the authorization, the UE may send a request to
the content provider in the application layer, then the step 3, 4, and 5 of
the solution apply, or the UE may release the PDU session for the multicast
session.
NOTE: If MB-SMF and SMF are co-located, the above procedure applies. If MB-SMF
and SMF are not co-located, the above procedure still apply with the
adaptation that (MB-)SMF is replaced by MB-SMF and the communication between
MB-SMF and UE is via SMF .
### 6.5.3 Solution evaluation
The solution provides the authorization revocation for a multicast session,
for KI#1
## 6.6 Solution #6: Authentication and authorization for multicast
communication service based on AKMA
### 6.6.1 Solution overview
This solution, which is based on AKMA, addresses the key issue #1 Security of
authentication and authorization for multicast communication service.
### 6.6.2 Solution details
{width="6.564583333333333in" height="3.673611111111111in"}
Figure 6.6.2-1: Authentication between the MBSTF and UE based AKMA
1) UE generates the AKMA Anchor Key (K~AKMA~) and the A-KID from the K~AUSF~
before initiating communication with an AKMA Application Function, i.e. MBSTF,
as specified in TS 33.535 [5].
2) The UE requests a PDU session establishment or modification to receive an
MBS service. The procedure for UE authorization is a part of UE join procedure
and is described in TS 23.247 [x] clause 7.2.1.
3) UE derive a key K~MBS~ for authentication with the MBSTF .
4) When UE try to join the multicast service, UE computes MAC-I and then UE
sends a MBS service request to MBSTF. The service request include A-KID and
MAC-I.
Note: How to derive the MAC-I is not addressed in the present document.
4-7) Upon receiving the request, the MBSTF discovers the AAnF, then AAnF
generates K~MBS~ and sends the K~MBS~ to MBSF/MSF-C. The AAnF discovery and
selection is specified in the TS 33.535[5] clause 6.7. The MBSTF computes the
MAC-I using K~MBS~, and check if it is the same with the received MAC-I from
UE. If so, it means that the UE is authenticated and authorized to use the
service.
8) The MBSTF verifies the MAC-I using the K~MBS~, when the verification is
succeed, and if the UE is authorized to perform the operation, then the MBSTF
sends a service response to the UE.
### 6.6.3 Solution evaluation
This solution use AKMA framework to address security of authentication and
authorization for multicast communication service.
NOTE: Further evaluation is not addressed in the present document.
## 6.7 Solution # 7: security protection between AF and 5GC
### 6.7.1 Solution overview
This security solution is related to the key issue #4: \"Security protection
between AF and 5GC\". The interface between the NEF/MBSF-C/MBSF-U and the AF
used needs to be properly secured by providing confidentiality, integrity and
replay protection. Mutual authentication is also needed. TS 33.501 [6] already
defined the security aspects of NEF, which can be reused.
### 6.7.2 Solution details
The security aspects defined in clause 12 in TS 33.501[6] is applicable for
both NEF, MBSF-C and MBSF-U. TLS based solution are reused to protect the
interface between AF and 5GC.
### 6.7.3 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution fulfils the potential security requirements given in the
related key issue.
## 6.8 Solution #8: MBS Traffic Protection
### 6.8.1 Solution overview
This solution addresses both KI#2 and KI#3.
According to TR 23.757 [2], in the adopted baseline architecture 3, the MBSF-U
(Multicast/Broadcast Service Function-User plane) is defined as a new entity
to handle the payload part to cater for the service level functions and
management.
In this solution, MBS traffic is protected between the MBSF-U in the operator
domain and the UE, and it is transparent to the content provider. MBS Traffic
Key (MTK) is generated by (MB-)SMF and distributed to the UEs through the
control plane. In addition, key update is also supported. MBSF-U uses the MTK
to protect the MBS traffic before sending them out to the UE.
### 6.8.2 Solution details
In the procedure below, (MB-)SMF is the enhanced SMF that supports MBS.
Figure 6.8.2-1: MBS traffic protection procedure
0\. The AF of the content provider provides the multicast configuration
information to UDM. The information includes UE authorization information and
indicates whether the security protection provided by PLMN is needed. The NEF
is involved in the provision if the content provider belongs to a 3^rd^ party.
1\. The UE initiates the request for a PDU session establishment/modification.
The identifier for the MBS application is included. The request is forwarded
to the (MB-)SMF through the control plane.
NOTE: Multicast session join operation via UP is out of scope of the present
document.
2\. If the (MB-)SMF does not have the subscription data already, the (MB-)SMF
sends a request for the subscription data to the UDM/UDR.
3\. The UE authorization information is included in the response message. If
the security protection provided by PLMN is needed and MTK and KID is
available, the UDM/UDR replies with the stored MTK and KID. Step 4-7 are
skipped if key updated is not needed.
4\. If MTK and KID is not available in UDM/UDR or the MTK needs to be updated
based on local policy, (MB-)SMF generates a MTK and the associated key
identifier (KID) for the MBS application. KID contains the Key Group part and
the Key Number part. Key Group part could be the MBS Session ID. Key number
part is used to distinguish MTKs that have the same Key Group part.
If MBSF-C is determined to generate MTK and KID, (MB-)SMF retrieves MTK and
KID from MBSF-C when needed.
5\. (MB-)SMF provisions the generated MTK and the KID to the MBSF-U.
6\. (MB-)SMF provisions the generated MTK and the KID to the UDM/UDR.
7\. If UE is authorised to use the MBS feature and allowed to access the data
from the MBS application, the (MB-)SMF sends the MTK and the KID to the UE.
The UP security policy is set to \"not needed\" which indicates UP
confidentiality and/or UP integrity protection is not activated for all DRBs
belonging to that MBS session to avoid redundant protection.
8\. When MBS traffic is received at the MBSF-U/MSF-U, the MBSF-U/MSF-U uses
the received MTK to protect the MBS traffic. The protected MBS traffic along
with the KID are sent to the UE.
The UE uses the received MTK in step 7 to process the MBS traffic.
The above text descripts the security handling when SMF and MB-SMF are co-
located. If SMF and MB-SMF are deployed separately, MB-SMF performs step 2-6.
For step 8, the MB-SMF sends the MTK and the KID to the UE via SMF.
### 6.8.3 Solution evaluation
This solution fulfils the potential security requirements given in the key
issue#2&3\. This solution provides the protection for the MBS traffic between
the MBSF-U in the operator domain and the UE.
MTK is a one-to-many key to protect the MBS traffic, and is distributed and
updated in control plane in a secure way.
## 6.9 Solution #9: Key update solution
### 6.9.1 Solution overview
This solution addresses Key Issue 3 to support the update or revocation of the
group key.
This solution is described in the context of Solution 1. The keys for
protection of MBS traffic are generated in the RAN nodes and distributed to
UEs. The UEs, which belong to a multicast group, acquire the same group keys
in the RAN node. The security protection is enabled in transport layer. MUK
and GK in this description refer to UE_K and K_group in Solution #1,
respectively.
The solution includes three approaches, a basic approach and two communication
optimized approaches that provide better performance, in particular, when the
number of subscribed UEs is high.
This key update solution can be applied to service layer solutions, e.g.,
Solution 2 uses it in clause 6.2.2.1.
### 6.9.2 Solution Details
#### 6.9.2.0 Key update
This clause explains how the group key is to be updated. Reasons to trigger
this procedure include UE mobility, presence of malicious UEs, or long usage
of the group key.
**Default approach:**
The default group key update version uses key hierarchy:
**MUK GK**
In this approach, each UE has two keys: a device specific key, MUK, and a
group key GK shared with all N devices in a RAN subscribed to the same MBS
service and used to protect the MBS traffic. MUK refers the device specific UE
keys used to protect message 9 in 6.1.1-1, i.e., the RRC reconfiguration
request.
In the following, K1 K2 means that K1 is used to protect the transport of K2
by ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and freshness. In the following,
E~K1~{K2} is used to indicate the secure delivery of K2 by protecting it with
K1.
Group key update in the following situations:
1\. Initial group key distribution,
2\. Key update due to a too long usage,
3\. Key update triggered by a new device joining the group, and
4\. Key update triggered by a UE leaving/being revoked.
Might involve the following steps:
\- RAN generating a new group key (Step 8 in Figure 6.1.1-1 and Step 8 in
Figure 6.9.2-1).
\- RAN sending RRC reconfiguration request unicast messages to all UEs
subscribed to a given MBS service (Step 9 in Figure 6.1.1-1 and Step 9 in
Figure 6.9.2-1).
\- UE receiving and storing the security information (Step 10 in Figure
6.1.1-1 and Step 10 in Figure 6.9.2-1).
{width="3.9027777777777777in" height="2.9652777777777777in"}
Figure 6.9.2-1. Default key update
**Communication optimized approach 1:**
Alternatively, the following key hierarchy is used:
**MUK TK_i GK**
In this approach, each UE has three keys: a device specific key, MUK; a
transport key TK_i shared with L - 1 devices in the same set S_i; a group key
GK shared with all N devices and used to protect the MBS traffic. The
transport keys and the group key shall be generated independently from each
other in a secure way. The MUK is used to securely deliver transport keys in a
point-to-point connection. The transport keys are used to securely deliver the
group key.
In this approach, a multicast group with N members is divided into M disjoint
sets S_i of UEs with i={1,...,M}. Each set has roughly L \~ N/M UEs.
The transport keys are used to securely deliver the group key updates as part
of the data exchanged over the regular MBS traffic. The process to extract
this data is as follows:
\- any UE decrypts, checks the integrity, and freshness of the multicast data
sent over the transport layer using the current GK.
\- a UE belonging to set z looks for E~TK_z~{GK}. Then, the UE verifies the
message authentication code, and if it is correct, it decrypts the new group
key. Freshness can be achieved by using the same freshness counter as used for
the distribution of MBS traffic. Finally, the UE also checks whether the hash
of the new decrypted group key equals the hash H of the group key that is
appended at the end of this multicast group key message. This multicast group
key message (MGKM) is:
**MGKM1(TKs, GK) := E~TK\ _1~{GK}, ..., E~TK_M~{GK }, H=Hash(GK)**
The group key update procedure might involve -- depending on the key update
policy -- the following steps:
**1\. During initial group key distribution** : MUK is used in the initial
group key distribution to securely distribute transport keys and GK in a
point-to-point connection by means of RRC reconfiguration request messages
(Step 9 in Figure 6.1.1-1 and Steps 8, 9, and 10 in Figure 6.9.2-2).
**2\. Group key update due to a too long usage** might require the gNB
generating a new group key and sending the MGKM over the MBS transport layer.
Steps 8 and 12 in Figure 6.9.2-2.
**3\. Key update triggered by a new device joining the group or a** **UE
leaving/being revoked** might require (1) RAN generating a new group key and a
new transport key (Steps 8 and 9 in Figure 6.9.2-2), (2) sending L-1 RRC
reconfiguration request messages to the L-1 UEs that were in the same set as
the device that is leaving or has been revoked by means of RRC reconfiguration
request messages (Step 9 in Figure 6.1.1-1 and Steps 10 in Figure 6.9.2-2);
and (3) sending the MGKM over the MBS transport layer (Step 12 in Figure
6.9.2-2).
NOTE 1: The above steps are aligned with the key update conditions in 6.9.2.2
derived from TS 33.246 [3]. The specific required steps can be defined during
normative phase or depend on the operator\'s policy.
{width="4.194444444444445in" height="3.6527777777777777in"}
Figure 6.9.2-2. Communication optimized key update
**Communication optimized approach 2:**
In this approach, the following key hierarchy is used:
MUK TK_i MSK GK
Each UE has four keys: the three keys as described in Communication Optimized
Approach 1 plus an MSK. The MSK is a key shared by the N UEs in the multicast
group. The MSK is distributed over the multicast channel protected with the
TKs. The MSK is used to protect the update the GK over the multicast channel.
The MGKM message in the Communication optimized approach 2 is defined as:
MGKM2 (TKs, MSK, GK) := MGKM1(TKs, MSK), E~MSK~{GK}
When the GK needs to be updated because of:
\- a **too long usage of the GK,** the new GK is generated and sent over the
multicast channel protected with the MSK, i.e., E~MSK~{GK} is transmitted
where GK is the new group key. When a UE receives the new protected GK, the UE
can use the MSK to decrypt and verify the new group key GK.
1\. a **new device joining the group or a** **UE leaving/being revoked,** then
the MSK also needs to be updated since the MSK is also compromised. The key
update procedure consists in (1) generating a new group key, and a new MSK,
and a new transport key (Steps 8 and 9 in Figure 6.9.2-2), (2) sending L-1
reconfiguration request messages to the L-1 UEs that were in the same set as
the device that is leaving or has been revoked (Step 9 in Figure 6.1.1-1 and
Steps 10 in Figure 6.9.2-2); and (3) sending the MGKM2 over the MBS transport
layer (Step 12 in Figure 6.9.2-2). When a UE receives the new encrypted GK,
the UE can use first its TK to decrypt/verify the new MSK, check the validity
of H, and then use the new MSK to decrypt/verify the new GK.
#### 6.9.2.1 Comparison between the default and optimized approaches
The communication optimized approach 1 is useful to decrease the communication
overhead to roughly 2 SQRT(N) compared with the default approach. This
approach is efficient and resilient since the update of the group key due to a
device leaving the group only requires L -- 1 + M messages instead of N that
would be required when only point-to-point messages are involved. For
instance, if N=64, M=8, L=8, then the key update only requires L-1=7 point-to-
point messages for the update of the transport key associated to the set of
the device that is leaving and the multicast distribution of the MGKM1 for the
group key update. This MGKM1 message transports the group key protected with M
different transport keys. The total number of messages is minimized when
L=M=SQRT(N). Another choice might be M=1 so that there is a single transport
key or M=N so that there are N transport keys.
The communication optimized approach 2 builds on communication optimized
approach 1 and improves it by reducing the overhead of the multicast message
used to update of the group key when the group key needs to be updated due to
too long usage. This is so since the update of the group key needs to be
protected with the MSK (i.e., E~MSK~(GK)) and sent a single time through the
multicast channel instead of requiring MGKM1 that including M protected values
of the group key. In practice, the communication optimized approach 2 provides
limited benefits compared with communication optimized approach 1 when the GK
is used to protect a reasonable amount of data, e.g., in the order of 2\^24
calls to the underlying encryption algorithm (i.e., encrypt 2\^28 bytes of
data if a 128 bit encryption algorithm is used) as shown in Figure 6.9.2.1-2.
The following table provides a comparison in the number of messages required
to update a transport key (TK) and the group key (GK) depending on the key

The trade-offs between default and optimized approaches can also be compared
from a computational view. To this end, it is assumed that 256 users in the
same area, e.g., at a concert, are willing to receive the MBS traffic. It is
assumed M= 16 independent groups, each group with a different group key. For
instance, 16 groups in a RAN, each group with L= 16 devices. In this case, if
a device leaves the MBS session, only the group key in the affected multicast
group needs to be updated. The overhead of updating the group key is now as
low as in the communication optimized approach; however, this approach
requires encrypting/protecting the MBS bulk traffic with M = 16 different
group keys, one per group. Thus, the computational overhead is a factor M
worse. Note that this configuration also involves transmitting the same MBS
content M times in parallel.
Since M transport keys are used, an attacker that compromises a UE can only
try to update the group key of up to L-1 devices. This limits the impact of
such an attack, in particular, compared with a situation in which a single
transport key is used to protect the update of the group key where N-1 would
be affected.
Furthermore, the hash of the group key is included so that devices in other
sets -- that potentially might also receive this fake group key update -- can
check the consistency by means of H, detect the group key update attack, and
inform the RAN.
Although the overhead of the key update solutions depends on the configuration
and MBS parameters, the following figures provide an indication of the
performance trade-offs of the different key update approaches. The following
assumptions are used:
1) an MBS group of 10.000 UEs;
2) a maximum number of MBS group membership changes between of 1 and 240 UEs;
3) a data rate of 384 kbps;
4) a transmission time of 24 hours, and
5) the trigger of an update of the GK when the GK has been used to protect
between 2\^20 and 2\^32 bytes.

offset between the red and purple lines is due to the fact that the GK also
needs to be updated due to long usage. Here it is assumed that a group key is
used to protect by to 2\^24 bytes. In the default approach, this key update
needs to be done with unicast messages while in the optimized approaches this
can be done through the multicast channel. The offset between the purple and
blue lines equals 2 = log10(SQRT(10000)).

Figure 6.9.2.1-2: Total overhead of the group key update approaches
The figure shows the total overhead of the group key update approaches as a
function of the MBS group membership changes and the maximum amount of data
that can be protected with an MBS key before group key update. The total
overhead is obtained by adding the number of protected keys that need to be
sent altogether through unicast and multicast messages. In green, Solution 9

blue, Solution 9 in its \"communication optimized approach 1\" with multiple
transport keys; in purple, Solution 9 in its \"communication optimized

Solution 9. The green line (communication optimized approach 2) shows the best
performance in all cases. The performance of the blue line improves compared
with the performance of the purple line when the number of MBS membership
changes increases. For very few MBS member changes, the blue line outperforms
the purple line when the group key is used to protect more than \~2\^22 Bytes
= 4 Mbytes. The performance of Solution #12 is equivalent to that of the
purple line. The performance of Solution #11 is comparable to that in the red
line. A difference of 1.5 - 2 in logarithmic scale (between two approaches)
corresponds to a difference in overhead of a factor 35 -- 100 in linear scale.
#### 6.9.2.2 Key update conditions
Referring to TS 33.246-C.4 (R5c) [3], the key update conditions depend on the
operator and might include:
1) The effect of subscribed users distributing decryption keys to non-
subscribed users should be controllable.
2) Users that have joined an MBS User Service, but then left, should not gain
further access to the MBS User Service without being charged appropriately.
3) Users joining an MBS User Service should not gain access to data from
previous transmissions in the MBS User Service without having been charged
appropriately.
The key update protocol supports the operator to perform re-keying as
frequently as necessary in an efficient way.
\- To address 1), the GK needs to be updated in a regular basis based on a
policy deployed to RAN.
\- To address 2) and 3), a new GK needs to be distributed to all devices. In
the case of the communication optimized approach, the corresponding TK needs
to be updated first.
{width="3.9305555555555554in" height="2.4722222222222223in"}
Figure 6.9.2.2-1: Definition and distribution of key update conditions
To implement these key update conditions, the (MB-)SMF has to define and
deploy key update policies to RAN via AMF (Step 1 and 2 in Figure 6.9.2.2-1)
and the (MB-)SMF has to monitor key update condition events, e.g., when a user
leaves or joins, and inform RAN via AMF (Step 4 and 5 in Figure 6.9.2.2-1).
The RAN key update actions (Step 3 and 6 in Figure 6.9.2.2-1) might be any of
the actions done by RAN in Figures 6.9.2-1 and 6.9.2-2.
#### 6.9.2.3 Applicability to other solutions
The communication optimized approach 1 described above has been used in the
context of Solution #1 and Solution #2 (clause 6.2.2.1). Both communication
optimized approaches are easily applicable to other solutions to reduce the
key update signalling overhead. For instance, when communication optimized
approach 2 is applied to Solution #11,
\- the communication overhead of the key update mechanism in terms of point to
point messages -- Step 6 in Figure 6.11.2 -1 -- is reduced from N messages to
\~ SQRT(N) messages, where N is the number of UEs in connected state that
joined the MBS session.
\- The overhead to updating the group key due to too long usage is reduced to
the transmission of a single key through the multicast channel instead of
requiring N point to point messages.
The required changes are as follows:
\- In Step 1, the MBSF has to generate M different Transport Keys (TKs) and an
MSK and distribute them to the UEs. The MBSTF receives the MTK to protect the
MBS traffic. As in the communication optimized approach 2:
(1) each UE has a unique security key (NAS security), a TK, an MSK, and an
MTK. This clause uses the term MTK as in Solution #11 whose role is equivalent
to GK used in this clause above. These keys are independent of each other;
(2) a NAS protected message is used to securely distribute the TK and the TK
is used to securely distribute the MSK, and the MSK is used to securely
distribute the MTK. The TK, MSK and MTK can also be distributed to the UE at
the same time; and
(3) disjoint sets of L UEs receive the same TK so that Mâ€¢L â‰¥ N, where N is the
total number of devices.
\- In Step 3, the MBSF has to generate a new TK for the L-1 UEs in the same
set of a UE whose authorization info has changed and a new MSK. The MBSF-C
also needs to generate a new MTK when it has been used for a too long time.
\- In Step 4:
\- when the MTK update is triggered due to a membership change, KID2 is
replaced by KID2\'. KID2\' includes the identifier of the new MTK, KID2,
concatenated (indicated as \"\|\") with the MGKM message defined above:
> KID2\' := KID2\|MGKM2
\- when the MTK update is triggered due to a too long usage, KID2 is replaced
by KID2\'\'. KID2\'\' includes the identifier of the new MTK, KID2,
concatenated (indicated as \"\|\") with the update of the MTK protected with
the current MSK:
> KID2\'\' := KID2\|E~MSK~(MTK2)
NOTE 2: The KID2\' and KID2\'\' messages are generated by the MBSF and
combined with KID2 to avoid the integration of any security functionalities
into the MBSTF.
NOTE 3: Details on the structure of KID2\' and KID\'\' that act as a container
of KID2 and MGKM2 (or E~MSK~(MTK2)) can be discussed during normative phase.
\- In Step 5, the MBSF distributes the new TK to the (MB-)SMF.
\- In Step 6, **ONLY** the L-1 UEs that shared the same TK as the UE whose
authorization info has changed are updated by means of a point to point
connection. This means that only L-1 unicast interactions are required,
instead of N. These unicast messages are NAS protected.
\- In Step 8, the MBSTF uses MTK2 to protect the MBS traffic. The MBSTF
appends KID2\' or KID2\'\' to the message. A UE uses: (1) KID2 in KID2\' or
KID\'\' to determine the usage of a new MTK and (2) if the UE did not receive
MTK2 in Step 6 by means of a unicast message, the UE uses the MGKM in KID2\'
or E~MSK~(MTK2) in KID2\'\' to access the new MTK2.
With these modifications, the key update overhead in Solution #11 is
proportional to the square root of the number of UEs in the MBS session. The
overhead of updating the MTK due to too long usage is limited to a single
encrypted key. This optimized signalling approach in 6.11.2.1 also facilitates
interoperability with LTE networks.
### 6.9.3 Evaluation
This solution addresses Key issue #3 to manage, distribute, and update the
keys required to protect the MBS traffic in the context of transport layer
solution #1.
This solution can be applied to service layer solutions, e.g., Solution #2
uses it.
This solution describes a default and two communication optimized approaches.
The communication optimized approaches allow updating the group key used to
protect the MBS traffic in a group with N devices with around root square of N
(SQRT(N)) unicast messages in contrast with the default approach that requires
N unicast messages. This means that _for the same key update signalling
overhead_ , the communication optimized approach allows supporting MBS groups
a quadratic factor larger compared with the default approach without
increasing the computational or communication overhead to protect/transmit the
MBS traffic.
The choice M\~L\~SQRT(N) minimizes the total message size required to
distribute a new group key and the total number of required encryptions to
update the group key. This is because L-1 unicast messages need to be sent to
L-1 UEs and the MGKM message includes M = N/L (rounded upwards) protected
group keys. Thus, the total overhead in terms of protected group keys is
L-1+N/L. This is minimized when L\~SQRT(N).
Using M>1 transport keys and including the hash of the group key makes the
communication optimized solutions more resilient.
The communication overhead of the default approach is similar to the
communication overhead of the rest of solutions of KI#3 in the present
document in terms of the number of unicast messages required to
distribute/update a group key.
Compared with communication optimized approach 1, the communication optimized
approach 2 reduces the overhead in the multicast channel since the update of
the group key due to too long usage only requires the transmission of a single
protected group key value.
Overall, the communication optimized approaches with multiple transport keys
offer the best performance even for very few MBS membership changes if a group
key is used to protect at least 2\^22 bytes of data before group key update. A
symmetric key can be used to protect much more than 2\^22 bytes in a secure
way. For instance, in TS 33.501 [6] for the update of K~gNB~ and other keys
and triggered when the PDCP COUNTs are about to be re-used. PDCP COUNTs are 32
bit values according to TS 38.323 [10].
Performing the key update when a single UE has joined/left/been removed
minimizes the security risk. The communication optimized approaches allow
performing this key update at the cost of M-1 unicast messages while the
default approach or the communication optimized approach with a single
transport key require N-1 unicast messages. In contrast, if the key update
procedure is only triggered when at least a minimum number C>1 of UEs have
joined/left/been removed, the security risk increases because potentially
several malicious devices still have access to the MBS keys. Note that for a
given C and a group of size N divided into M subsets, the expected number of
devices that require update equals L*M*(1 -- binomial(N-M, C)/binomial(N,C)).
This is shown in Figure 6.9.3-1 for N= 400 (blue), 1600 (red), 3600 (green),
6400 (black), and 10000 (purple). It is possible to observe that for C = 1 the
number of devices that need to be updated equals SQRT(N)-1 and when C
increases, the number of devices increases.

Figure 6.9.3-1: The communication optimized approaches with multiple transport
keys
This figure shows the number of devices requiring key update as a function of
C. C is the minimum number of UEs that have to leave/join/be compromised
before the key update procedure is triggered. The default approach and the
communication approach 1 with a single transport key require always N-1
unicast messages for any value of C.
Overall, the communication optimized approach 2 as applied to Solution#1 or
Solution#11 (clause 6.9.2.3) offers the best performance independently of how
often the group key is updated.
In the comparison an MBS application is used requiring the highest data rate
in TS 22.261/TS 22.246. The performance of the different solutions is compared
based on the required number of key updates due to (i) MBS group membership
changes or (ii) key update because of a long usage of the group key. It is
further assumed that the group key is updated as soon as key update condition
is triggered.
Note 1: The key update scenarios used for comparative evaluations require
justification.
NOTE 2: Further evaluation is not addressed in the present document.
## 6.10 Solution #10: Secure framework for Key distribution in MBS
### 6.10.1 Solution overview
This solution addresses the key issue #2 \"security protection of MBS
traffic\" and Key issue #3 \"security protection of key distribution\".
Encryption key for MBS session is generated at RAN and UE from parameters like
TMGI, multicast group token, rekeying token (needed only when rekeying,
otherwise by default it is zero for initial key generation), encryption
algorithm and algorithm ID. Integrity key for MBS session is generated at RAN
and UE from parameters like Temporary Mobile Group Identifier (TMGI),
multicast group token, rekeying token (needed only when rekeying, otherwise by
default it is zero for initial key generation), integrity algorithm and
algorithm ID.
When UE joins the multicast group identified by the TMGI and its session,
after the PDU session establishment, SMF shares the multicast group token,
TMGI, Rekeying token list, rekeying token ID to RAN via AMF. Rekeying token
list contains many pre-generated re-keying token needed for this particular
MBS session. Rekeying ID and respective rekeying token list is stored in RAN
for future use. RAN and UE generates independently the encryption and
integrity keys for this MBS session. MBS traffic is encrypted, and integrity
protected at RAN level. Received MBS traffic is decrypted, and integrity check
is performed at UE.
When a UE or few UEs leaves the MBS group, then rekeying token from the stored
list in RAN is retrieved. Using this rekeying token, new keys are generated at
RAN and UEs in the ongoing MBS session and further sessions, till another
member leaves the group.
### 6.10.2 Solution details
#### 6.10.2.0 General
Multicast key generation and the procedure to distribution of those keys from
network to the UEs belonging to a multicast group identified by TMGI and
rekeying procedure is described below in detail.
#### 6.10.2.1 MBS key generation
Figure 6.10.2.1-1: Key generation at UE and RAN
For the multicast broadcast encryption key generation for traffic KMTenc, the
parameters like TMGI (Temporary mobile group identifier), multicast group
token, re-keying token (if available, otherwise default value \"0\" is used),
encryption algorithm and encryption algorithm ID are used. For the multicast
broadcast integrity key generation for traffic KMTint, the parameters like
TMGI (Temporary mobile group identifier), multicast group token, re-keying
token (if available, otherwise default value \"0\" is used), integrity
algorithm and integrity algorithm ID are used.
NOTE 1: As long as the \"Multicast group Token\" is not updated, the security
of KMTenc and KMTint depends only on the rekeying token.
Figure 6.10.2.1-1 shows the key generation at UE and RAN.
(RAN node (Base stations) get the parameters for the key generation from the
5G core network nodes MB-SMF/AMF as detailed in TR 23.757 [2]).
#### 6.10.2.2 MBS procedure for key generation and traffic protection
Step 1: UE registers in the PLMN (see clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [11]) and
request the establishment of a PDU session (see clause 4.3.2.2 of TS 23.502
[11]). The UE also indicates its capability to receive multicast data over the
radio. The AMF obtains information from the UDM whether the UE can join
multicast sessions as part of the SMF Selection Subscription data. If so, for
direct discovery, the AMF selects an SMF capable of handling multicast
sessions based on locally configured data or a corresponding SMF capability
stored in the NRF and also indicates the UE\'s capability to receive multicast
data over the radio to the SMF.
Step 2: The content provider announces the availability of multicast using
higher layers (e.g., application layer). The announcement includes at least
the multicast address of a multicast group that UE can join.
Step 3: To join the multicast group session, steps 4 to 9 as described in TR
23.757 [2] are followed.
> Figure 6.10.2.2-1: MBS Procedure for key generation and traffic protection
Step 4: SMF requests AMF to transfer a message to RAN node using
Namf_N1N2Message Transfer service with multicast information along with
multicast group token, TMGI, Rekeying token list, Rekying token id etc.
Rekeying token list contains many pre-generated re-keying token and
corresponding ids needed for this particular multicast group management.
NOTE 1: As an option, rekeying token id and rekeying token list sent during
initial configuration from SMF to RAN, can be simplified by reducing the list
to single key. This will avoid key management at RAN.
Step 5: N2 session request is sent to RAN with multicast related information
received from SMF.
Step 6: Rekeying token list is stored in RAN for future purposes (in case of
re-keying).
Step 7: RAN generates multicast key hierarchy (both encryption key and
integrity key) needed for the traffic as shown in Figure 6.10.2.1-1.
Step 8: RAN shares in an integrity protected and encrypted RRC message, the
multicast group token and MBS session ID TMGI to the respective UE. The
multicast group token which plays the role of a group primary key should of
sufficient length for e.g.128bits.
Step 9: UE which joins the session will generate the MBS related keys (both
encryption KMTenc and integrity keys KMTint).
Step 10: UPF(MB-UPF) receives multicast PDUs, either directly from the content
provider or via the MBSF-U that can manipulate the data.
Step 10a: UPF(MB-UPF) sends multicast PDUs in the N3/N9 tunnel associated to
the multicast distribution session to the RAN. There is only one tunnel per
multicast distribution session and RAN node, i.e., all associated PDU sessions
share this tunnel.
Step 10b: RAN performs the encryption of traffic using encryption key KMTenc
and integrity protection by KMTint. RAN selects PTM or PTP radio bearers to
deliver the multicast PDUs to UEs that joined the multicast group.
Step 11a: RAN performs the transmission using selected bearer.
Step 11b: Receiving multicast UEs which are part of this MBS session (matching
the MBS group ID) will decrypt the traffic using encryption keys and also
verifies the integrity check of the packets received.
Figure 6.10.2.2-1 shows the MBS procedure for key generation and traffic
protection
NOTE 2: Security policies for PTM and PTP needs to be the same. RAN may decide
to switch between PTM and PTP for a UE, if the security policies for PTM and
PTP is not the same (e.g. PTM is protected but PTP is not protected), then
security may be breached.
#### 6.10.2.3 MBS procedure for re-keying
Figure 6.10.2.3-1: MBS procedure for re-keying
Step 1: If a UE in a Multicast broadcast, is leaving the Multicast group, then
respective SMF is informed about the UE leaving the Multicast group and the
TMGI. If a UE joins a session, then PDU session establishment or modification
happens with respective SMF.
Step 2: SMF informs the respective RAN via AMF about a UE leaving an MBS group
and initiate a new MBS group management procedure. As one or few UEs leaving
the group, same keys cannot be used for ongoing MBS traffic.
Step 3: It is also possible that few of the UEs are actively listening to the
ongoing MBS session while few of the UEs are in idle mode, may or may not be
listening to the traffic. In order to update all the UE which belongs to the
new (modified) multicast group, AMF pages the UEs which are in Idle state
(which belongs to new multicast group), so that they will listen to the page
(example: _with cause mbskeyupdate)_ and further connect to the network. The
UEs which have left the multicast group are excluded from the to be paged
list.
NOTE 1: The privacy issue with group paging to be addressed during normative
phase.
Step 4: UEs which were in Idle mode establishes connection to the respective
base stations. UEs which were active UEs (already in connected mode) are
aligned and will be in connected mode with the respective RAN. So, all the UEs
in the MBS group identified by the TMGI under the coverage of a given base
station are connected to the base station now.
Step 5: RAN selects the rekeying token from the list already received form
SMF, as instructed by the SMF. All the RAN nodes have to select the same
rekeying token, so to aid the same rekeying token selection, SMF also would
have sent the rekeying token id to the RAN node. It is also option to send the
rekeying token to the RAN nodes at this step directly without token id , to
avoid sending the rekeying token list upfront.
NOTE 2: An alternative is to use different rekeying tokens per RAN node
indicated by SMF. This would result in different multicast keys (both
integrity key KMTint and encryption key KMTenc) at every RAN node.
Step 6: RAN shares in an integrity protected and encrypted RRC message, the
rekeying token to respective UEs. The re-keying token should be of sufficient
length, for e.g.128 bits.
Step 7: New multicast keys (both integrity key KMTint and encryption key
KMTenc) are generated at RAN and UE using rekeying token (Procedure shown in
Figure 6.10.2.1-1).
Figure 6.10.2.3-2 shows the procedure how and when RAN updates the offset
information and rekeying token in RRC reconfiguration message (step 2 and 3)
to all UEs. Traffic protected with newly generated keys are received from
network according to configured timing offset (the value indicates the timing
offset with respect to subframe#0 of SFN#0 in milliseconds.).
NOTE 3: Same MBS security context is used for any MBS data transmission.
Note 4: It is not addressed when to activate the new keys at UE and RAN, after
rekeying token is delivered.
Step 8: Fresh new multicast keys (both integrity key KMTint and encryption key
KMTenc) are generated at UEs using rekeying token.
NOTE 5: Rekeying token is never delivered to the UE which left the MBS session
and so with older MBS keys, the MBS traffic cannot be decrypted, and integrity
protection check will fail.
Figure 6.10.2.3-2 :MBS procedure for re-keying token delivery for multiple UEs
Mobility usecase:
**Usecase where no key update required:** When the SMF distributes the same
rekeying token to all RANs, then there is no need for rekeying procedure
during handover. Target and source RANs will use the same keys for that
particular MBS session.
Usecase where key update required: When SMF provides different rekeying token
for different RANs, then during of the UE handover, it needs to update the
keys. Assume Source NG-RAN has received the multicast group token, which is
same for target NG-RAN. The difference considered is the rekeying token
received at each RAN. Example: rekeying_token_A is received in source NG-RAN
and corresponding MBS keys are generated. Similarly rekeying_token_B is
received in target NG-RAN and corresponding MBS keys are generated. UE_A
connected to source NG-RAN will have the same key material and traffic is
protected with MBS key_A. UE_B connected to target NG-RAN will have the same
key material and traffic is protected with MBS key_B.
When handover is triggered, then SMF will share the rekeying token_B to UE_A,
so the new MBS keys are generated at UE_A and target NG-RAN (updated in
security context). UE_A, UE_B which is connected to target NG-RAN will have
same MBS key_B, which can be used for decrypting the incoming traffic.
### 6.10.3 Solution Evaluation
_As SMF controls rekeying token, UE handover scenarios does not need any
rekeying token (in case target and source RAN uses same rekeying token). In
case target and source RAN maintains different rekeying token, SMF provides
the same rekeying token (used in target RAN) to UE during handover. So in
handover scenarios, it has no or less impact on RAN modules._ Mobility issue
and dynamic switch between PTM and PTP needs security handling in PDCP layer.
For the same MBS session in 5GS, there can be multiple MB-SMFs serving the
session, and for each of the MB-SMF there can be multiple SMFs associated with
the MB-SMF for the same session. Each of the SMF generates a different
multicast group token, which will be used to protect the same MBS session.
Therefore in UE mobility where the SMF changes, the UE has no multicast group
token generated by the new SMF. Before the UE can use the MBS session, the new
SMF has to sends its multicast group token to the UE.
NOTE: Further evaluation is not addressed in the present document.
## 6.11 Solution #11: Update the keys used to protect the MBS traffic
### 6.11.1 Introduction
This solution addresses Key issue #3 to update the keys to protect the MBS
traffic. The MBS traffic is protected between MBSTF and UEs. The basic idea is
to use the signalling messages for the key update procedure. The UEs, which
belong to a multicast group, acquire the same group keys as in the MBSTF. The
security protection is enabled in service layer.
### 6.11.2 Solution details
Figure 6.11.2 -1: Procedure for MTK update
1\. The multicast join and session establishment procedure is performed
between the UE and 5GS, during which MBSF generates MTK1&KID1 and distributes
them to MBSTF and UEs. MTK1&KID1 are used to protect the MBS traffic. Details
can be found in solution #3 or solution #8.
2\. MBSF subscribes to the UDM/UDR on the changes of the multicast information
including the authorization information. The UDM/UDR notifies the MBSF when
the authorization for a UE to join the multicast session is changed. The MBS
Session ID and UE info (i.e. GPSIs, number of UEs) are included in the
notification. The MBS Session ID may be a Temporary Mobile Group Identifier
(TMGI) or a multicast address. UE info indicates the change of authorization
info.
3\. MBSF triggers the MTK update based on the changes of authorization info or
the key lifetime of MTK1. MBSF generates MTK2 and KID2 for this MBS session.
For example, if the number of UEs whose authorization is revoked reached the
threshold, the MBSF triggers the MTK update. It is operator\'s choice to
decide the policy for different event.
4-5. MBSF distributes MTK2, KID2 and MBS Session ID to MB-SMF and MBSTF
respectively.
6\. MB-SMF distributes MTK2, KID2 and MBS Session ID to SMF. SMF distributes
MTK2 and KID2 to the authorized UEs in the connected state whose MBS sessions
are not released. For example, SMF may initiate PDU session modification for
the key distribution. Confirmation for update notification is responded to
(MB)-SMF. With the confirmation info, (MB)-SMF determines to activate MTK2
based on local policy. For UEs in idle or inactive state UEs, the updated key
are delivered when UE joins or activates the MBS session.
7\. If the procedure to update the key in UE side is finished, MB-SMF
indicates MBSTF to activate the MTK2 for the corresponding MBS session via
MBSF.
8\. MBSTF uses MTK2 and KID2 to protect the MBS traffic.
### 6.11.3 Evaluation
This solution addresses Key issue #3 to update the key for protecting the MBS
session. The solution protects the MBS traffic between MBSTF and UEs.
AF provides the subscription changes to UDM via NEF.
MBSF decides to trigger the MTK update procedure based on the changes of
authorization info or the key lifetime of MTK. The new MTK and KID are sent to
UE and MBSTF respectively. The key update procedure by SMF to the UEs incurs
signalling overhead proportional to the number of UEs in connected state that
joined the MBS session. NAS SM messages need to be delivered to those UEs when
a key change happens.
This solution does not require idle or inactive state UEs to transition to the
connected state to receive the key update.
## 6.12 Solution #12: Protection of MBS traffic at service layer based on GBA
### 6.12.1 Solution overview
This solution addresses Key Issue 1, 2 and 3 to protect the MBS key and
traffic at service-layer. This solution leverages the MBMS security
architecture specified in TS 33.246 [3].
### 6.12.2 Solution details
In order to receive an MBS service, the UE establishes a secure connection
with the MBS service function and obtains security materials.
Figure 6.12.2-1: Message flows for MBS key delivery and MBS traffic protection
0\. The UE is registered to 5GS.
1\. The UE requests a PDU session establishment or modification to receive an
MBS service.
2\. The UE establishes a secure connection with MBSTF based on GBA similar to
MBMS [3] or AKMA [5]. In both scenarios, MBSTF is considered an AF and UE and
MBSF-U communicate using Ua/Ua* protocol. Both the UE and MBSTF derive
Multicast User Key (MUK) from the AF key (e.g., Ks_(int/ext)_NAF for GBA or
K~AF~ for AKMA). Over the secure connection, the UE and MBSTF performs
authentication and key derivation as specified in TS 33.246 [3].
NOTE 1: The key management function is located in the MBSTF as in BM-SC [3].
3\. The UE receives the Multicast Service Key (MSK) from the MBSF-U. The MSK
is protected using the MUK and delivered using a unicast message over the
secure connection.
4\. The UE receives the Multicast Traffic Key (MTK) protected using MSK from
the MBSTF. The MTK can be delivered either a unicast or a multicast message.
The MTK is used as a root key to derive application/protocol specific keys to
protect (e.g., encrypt or integrity protect) MBS service traffic.
5\. Using the MTK received in step 4, the UE derives application/protocol
specific keys and decrypts or verifies the MBS traffic.
The key hierarchy, rekeying and key usage for MBS traffic protection is
illustrated in Figure 6.12.2-2 and Figure 6.12.2-3. The MUK derived either
based on GBA or AKMA is used to protect MSKs, and each MSK is used to protect
MTKs. MBSF-U decides to trigger the MSK/MTK update procedure based on the
changes of authorization info or the key lifetime. MSK rekeying is done over
unicast to each UE joined to the MBS PDU session, and MTK rekeying is done
over unicast or multicast to UEs joined to the MBS session.
NOTE 2: When GBA is used, MUK derivation follows as specified in TS 33.220[8].
When AKMA is used, MUK is set to K~AF~ based on AKMA key derivation.
Note 3: More details on the use of AKMA for MUK rekeying are not addressed in
the present document.
Note 4: When AKMA is used, how MBSTF obtains the authorization information is
not addressed in the present document.
Figure 6.12.2-2: Usage of MSK for a single session or a channel
Figure 6.12.2-3: Usage of MSK for multiple sessions or channels
### 6.12.3 Solution evaluation
This solution reuse the LTE MBMS security architecture, both GBA and AKMA are
used to protect the MBS key and traffic at service-layer.
This solution addresses Key issue #2 and 3 to protect the MBS key and traffic
at service-layer.
MBSF-U decides to trigger the MTK update procedure based on the changes of
authorization info or the key lifetime of MTK. The new MTK and KID are sent to
UE and MBSTF respectively. The MSK update procedure by MBSTF to the UEs incurs
overhead proportional to the number of UEs in connected state that joined the
MBS session. The user plane messages need to be delivered to those UEs when a
MTK change happens.
## 6.13 Solution #13: Key generation and distribution for MBS
### 6.13.1 Solution overview
This solution addresses Key Issue 2&3 to support the secure MBS traffic
delivery between the UE and the NG-RAN. The MBS session key is derived by the
MB-SMF and provided to the UE and also to the NG-RAN. Further keys are derived
by the UE and the NG-RAN to protect the MBS data traffic over the air. For MBS
data traffic protection (integrity and/or confidentiality protection) between
the UE and the NG-RAN is performed at the PDCP layer.
### 6.13.2 Solution details
#### 6.13.2.1 Key generation and distribution
Figure 6.13.2.1-1: MBS Session Key generated and distribution
1\. MB Session Announcement (see e.g., TS 23.468 [7]).
2\. UE sends a MB Session Join Request (TMGI) message to the AMF, to join an
MB Session.
3\. If the AMF does not already have a MB Session Context for the received
TMGI, the AMF selects an MB-SMF for the TMGI by querying the NRF. A MB Session
Request (TMGI, AMF ID) message is sent to the MB-SMF to announce the AMF\'s
interest in the MB Session. The MB-SMF generates a session key (K~MBS,~ as
detailed in clause 6.13.2.2) for the TMGI, selects the security algorithm(s)
(encryption algorithm and/or Integrity protection algorithm) and generates a
MBS Key index for the TMGI.
The MB-SMF selects the security algorithm(s) (encryption algorithm and/or
Integrity protection algorithm), if there is network wide usage of the same
algorithm for the TMGI.
If multiple MB-SMFs are used within the network, then a Key Management Server
(KMS) is used to generate the session key (K~MBS,~ as detailed in clause
6.13.2.2) for the TMGI, selects the security algorithm(s) (encryption
algorithm and/or Integrity protection algorithm) and generates a MBS Key index
for the TMGI. The MB-SMF fetch the MBS session security context data from the
KMS. If the KMS does not already have a MBS session security context for the
received TMGI from the MB-SMF, then the KMS generates the MBS session security
context for the TMGI and provides it to the MB-SMF.
4\. The MB-SMF provides the MBS session security context data to the AMF. The
AMF stores the MBS session security context data for the TMGI, in the MBS
Session Context.
5\. The AMF creates a DL NAS MB Session Join Response message (which includes
MBS session security context data) and piggy backs that on a N2 MB Session
Join (NGAP ID, TMGI) message. The DL NAS message is protected using the NAS
security context.
6\. The AF requests activation of an MB Session by sending an Activate MBS
Bearer Request (TMGI, Service Requirement) message to the NEF/MBSF.
7\. NEF/MBSF sends a MB Session Start (TMGI, Service Requirement) message to
the MB-SMF.
8\. MB-SMF sets the MB Session Context to active and sends MB Session Start
(TMGI) messages to all AMFs that has earlier joined the MB Session.
9\. The AMF sends a MB Session Resource Setup Request (TMGI, MBS session
security context data) message to all RAN nodes where CM CONNECTED UEs that
has joined the TMGI resides.
The NG-RAN selects the security algorithm(s) (encryption algorithm and/or
Integrity protection algorithm), instead of MB-SMF selecting (as detailed in
step 3), if NG-RAN specific selection of the security algorithm is supported
for the MBS traffic.
The NG-RAN creates a MB Session Context (if it not already exists), sets it to
\'active\' state, stores the TMGI and MBS session security context data in the
MB Session Context.
10\. If NG-RAN prefers to use N3 multicast transport, the NG-RAN joins the
multicast group.
11\. NG-RAN establishes PTM or PTP DL resources for the MB Session.
For the TMGI\'s PTM MB sessions, the NG-RAN activates the security context and
indicates the key index and information required to derive the RAN specific
keys (as detailed in clause 6.13.2.2).
12\. The NG-RAN transmits the received DL media stream using DL PTM or PTP
resources. The NG-RAN uses the MBS session security context data of the TMGI
to protect (encryption and/or integrity protection) the DL media stream.
#### 6.13.2.2 Key hierarchy
Figure 6.13.2.2-1: Key hierarchy generation
\- K~MBS~ is an anchor/primary key, for a particular TMGI, generated by the
MB-SMF. K~MBS~ is provided to the UE and to the RAN. The network
entity/function generates K~MBS~ (for example, random key generated from a
random number generation function).
\- K~MBS-RAN~ is a key generated by ME and NG-RAN from MBS key K~MBS~. The
K~MBS-RAN~ is used to derive further keys that are used between the UE and the
NG-RAN to protect MBS.
\- K~MRBint~ is a key generated by ME and NG-RAN from MBS RAN specific key
K~MBS-RAN~, which is used for the protection of MBS traffic with a particular
integrity algorithm.
\- K~MRBenc~ is a key generated by ME and NG-RAN from MBS RAN specific key
K~MBS-RAN~, which is used for the protection of MBS traffic with a particular
encryption algorithm.
Key generation is performed using the key derivation function (KDF) specified
in Annex B.2.0 of TS 33.220 [8]. When deriving a key, the input parameters are
used to form the input S to the KDF.
The NG-RAN and the UE derives cell specific key from the session key (K~MBS~)
as follows:
> K~MBS-RAN~ = KDF {K~MBS~, TMGI, RAND~MBS~, Count~MBS,~ PCI, ARFCN-DL}
>
> K~MRB-enc~ = KDF {K~MBS-RAN~, Algorithm type distinguisher value, Algorithm
> identifier value}
>
> K~MRB-int~ = KDF {K~MBS-RAN~, Algorithm type distinguisher value, Algorithm
> identifier value}
Details of the input parameters used to derive MBS keys:
\- TMGI: is included in the key generation as to bind the key to a specific
TMGI.
\- PCI and ARFCN-DL: are included in the key generation as to bind the key to
a specific RAN Cell.
\- Count~MBS~: is used as a freshness parameter in refreshing the key. The NG-
RAN associates a counter, called a Count~MBS~, with the MBS security context.
The Count~MBS~ is used as freshness input into key derivations. The NG-RAN
sends the value of the Count~MBS~ to the UE over the RRC signalling path when
it is required to generate a new MBS key. The NG-RAN maintains the value of
the counter for a duration of the current MBS security context between UE and
NG-RAN. The NG-RAN initializes the Count~MBS~ to 0x00 0x01 when the K~MBS-RAN~
is derived. The UE and the NG-RAN maintains the Count~MBS~ for lifetime of the
K~MBS-RAN~. The Count~MBS~ is incremented by the NG-RAN for every new
computation of the K~MBS-RAN~. The NG-RAN sends the value of the Count~MBS~
(used to generate the K~MBS-RAN~) to the UE. The UE accepts Count~MBS~ value
that is greater than stored Count~MBS~ value.
\- RAND~MBS~: is used as a freshness parameter in refreshing the key (in other
words, not to generate the same key every time), as to generate unique key for
every key generation and to provide it to only authorised UEs. RAND~MBS~ is
used to prevent the UE from deriving the keys, which are not authorized for
the current session, but obtained the MBS security context for the previous
sessions. The size of the RAND~MBS~ should be long enough to prevent
predicting the K~MBS-RAN~, even if K~MBS~ is known to a revoked UEs.
MBS bearer can comprise of MRB (PTM) or DRB (PTP) or a combination of MRB
(PTM) and DRB (PTP). PTM path is protected with using the key (K~MBS-
enc/~K~MBS-int~) and PTP path is protected using the UP key
(K~UPenc~/K~UPint~). In case of combination of PTM and PTP delivery methods,
same security policy is applied for both MRB and DRB bearers.
Note 1: How MB-SMF or KMS selects AS security algorithms is not addressed in
the present document.
Note 2: Details on KMS is FFS, e.g., how it interfaces and interacts with MB-
SMF are not addressed in the present document.
6.13.2.3 Key Refresh
The MBS keys used to protect the MBS traffic needs to be updated:
\- to prevent the UE to access the MBS content after leaving the group (e.g.,
cancel a MBS subscription)
\- if a UE joins the group newly (newly subscribes for MBS), then the UE
should not able to access the already broadcasted content, and
\- to prevent use of same key stream blocks repeatedly (due to PDCP COUNT
wrap-around).
If the NG-RAN nodes decides to refresh the K~MRB-RAN~, then the NG-RAN
provides a new RAND~MBS~ and also the increased Count~MRB~ value to the
authorised UEs over SRB using RRC Re-configuration message. Once the
parameters required for the key derivation is provided by the NG-RAN, then the
UE and the NG-RAN derives new keys (K~MBS-RAN~, K~MRB-enc~ and K~MRB-int~).
The NG-RAN, then establish a new MRB and starts using the new keys to protect
the MBS traffic.
### 6.13.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides the protection for the MBS traffic between the RAN and
the UE (at PDCP layer). This solution provides the following aspects:
Supporting all deployment scenarios. As per MBS TS 23.247 [9] (see Clause
5.1), MBSF and MBSTF are optional entities (Excerpt from TS 23.247 [9]:
\"_NOTE 1: The MBSF is optional and may be collocated with the NEF or AF/AS,
and the MBSTF is an optional network function\"._), leading to deployment
scenarios with/without MBSF & MBSTF.
\- In case if any MBS group member leaves the group, it is efficient to do the
key update at RAN level by refreshing the key K~MBS-RAN~, instead of updating
the session key (K~MBS~) to all member.
\- The key distribution procedure aligns with the session management procedure
as defined in SA2 and RAN groups.
\- The security granularity is cell-level.
NOTE: Further evaluation is not addressed in the present document.
## 6.14 Solution #14: Secure key delivery in service layer
### 6.14.1 Solution overview
This solution addresses Key Issue #3: Security protection of key distribution,
which includes the security requirement as \"The distribution of the keys for
protection of MBS traffic between the key generator and the UE shall be
confidentiality, integrity and anti-replay protected.\"
As the NAS confidentiality protection between AMF and UE is not mandatory and
it is not always enabled. Whenever there is no NAS confidentiality protection,
K~MBS~ will be sent in the clear, which is a huge damage for MBS service.
That\'s the motivation to design this solution. For the case when the NAS
confidentiality protection is enabled, the protection in this solution is
optional but also no harm to enable.
This solution proposes a method to protect the K~MBS~ used for MBS traffic
protection based on K~MBS-UE~ which is derived based on K~AUSF~. With this
solution, K~MBS~ delivery from MB-SMF to UE can be confidentially protected.
### 6.14.2 Solution details
{width="6.5in" height="3.213888888888889in"}
Figure 6.14.2-1: The procedure of key delivery of K~MBS~
The procedure is described as follows:
Step 0a: UE initiates the Primary Authentication and establishes the K~AUSF~
with AUSF in HPLMN.
Step 0b: Service announcement procedure, following the current Clause 7.1.1 in
TS 23.247 [9].
Step 1. MB-SMF generates K~MBS~ and KID for the specific MB service.
Step 2. To join the multicast group, the UE sends the PDU Session Modification
Request (MBS Session ID). MBS Session ID indicates the multicast group that UE
wants to join.
Step 3.0. AMF sends MBS Key Request to AUSF to ask for the encryption key.
Step 3.1. AUSF generates a K~MBS-UE~ using K~AUSF~ and TMGI.
Note 1: It is not addressed in the present document how AUSF knows TMGI.
Step 3.2. UE generates a K~MBS-UE~ and using K~AUSF~ and TMGI.
Step 3.3. AUSF send the K~MBS-UE~ to AMF.
Step 4. By using Nsmf_MBSSession_Create request (MBS Session ID), SMF
interacts with MB SMF to retrieve multicast QoS flow information of the
indicated MBS session.
Step 5. MB-SMF sends the K~MBS~ and KID to SMF using Nsmf_MBSSession_Create
response.
Step 6. SMF responds to AMF through Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
response(N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, MBS Session ID, MB-SMF ID,
multicast QoS flow information, updated PDU Session information, mapping
between unicast QoS flow and multicast QoS flow information), N1 SM container
(PDU Session Modification Command, KMBS and KID)
Step 7. AMF send the PDU session modification command (E~KMBS-UE~(K~MBS~)) to
UE, including the encrypted K~MBS~ and KID.
Step 8. UE decrypt the E~KMBS-UE~(K~MBS~) and gets the K~MBS~
K~MBS~ is used for the future protection of the MBS traffic.
Note 2: It is not addressed whether the KMBS will be used as the root key or
the session key.
NOTE 3: The UE leaving group procedure will be handled separately.
Note 4: Whether other keys (e.g. Kamf) can be used is not addressed here.
Note 5: What algorithms should be used is not addressed here.

# 7 Conclusions
## 7.1 Conclusions on Key Issue #1
Following conclusions are made on Key Issue #1: Authentication and
authorization for multicast communication services:
\- Solution #4 (Secondary based authentication and authorization) will form
the basis for the authentication and authorization method for multicast PDU
session and it is optional-to-use.
\- Solution #12 will be used as a basis for MBS service authentication and
authorization. This is optional to implement in both UE and network.
## 7.2 Conclusions on Key Issue #2
_Following conclusions are made on Key Issue #2 \"_ Security protection of MBS
traffic _\":_
\- No normative work is needed for transport layer-based solution.
\- _Service-layer solution is used as a baseline for the normative work._
MBSTF provides the security protection _for MBS traffic. The MTK is used as a
root key to derive application/protocol specific keys to protect (e.g.,
encrypt or integrity protect) MBS service traffic. The MSK is used to protect
the delivery of MTK. Every MSK/MTK is uniquely identifiable by its KID. This
will be optional to implement in both UE and network._
\- _For control plane based solution, MSK/MTK and its KID are delivered to UE
via control plane in the UE joining procedure if the UE is authorized to the
MBS service. The delivery of MSK/MTK is protected using NAS security. This
will be optional to implement in both UE and network._
\- For a user-plane solution, Solution #12 will be used as a basis for the
normative work. This is optional to implement in both UE and network.
## 7.3 Conclusions for Key Issue #3
_Following conclusions are made on Key Issue #3 \"_ Security protection of key
distribution _\":_
\- Based on the changes of authorization info or the key lifetime or the local
policy, the key generator decides to update the keys used to protect the MBS
traffic in a secure way. If a solution requires a shared key to update the key
used to protect the MBS traffic, then this shared key also needs to be updated
if it has been compromised.
\- In the interworking between LTE and 5G, the key distribution follows the
same security principle with the standalone case without interworking. The
details will be decided in the normative phase.
## 7.4 Conclusions on Key Issue #4
Following conclusions are made on Key Issue #4 \" Security protection between
AF and 5GC\":
\- Solution #7 will form the basis of normative work for key issue #4.
