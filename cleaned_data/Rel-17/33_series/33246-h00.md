# Introduction
The security of MBMS provides different challenges compared to the security of
services delivered over point-to-point services. In addition to the normal
threat of eavesdropping, there is also the threat that it may not be assumed
that valid subscribers have any interest in maintaining the privacy and
confidentiality of the communications, and they may therefore conspire to
circumvent the security solution (for example one subscriber may publish the
decryption keys enabling non-subscribers to view broadcast content).
Countering this threat requires the decryption keys to be updated frequently
in a manner that may not be predicted by subscribers while making efficient
use of the radio network. The stage 1 requirements for MBMS are specified in
TS 22.146 [2].
# 1 Scope
The Technical Specification covers the security procedures of the Multimedia
Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) for 3GPP systems (UTRAN, GERAN and
E-UTRAN). MBMS is a 3GPP system network bearer service over which many
different applications could be carried. The actual method of protection may
vary depending on the type of MBMS application.

# 4 MBMS security overview
## 4.1 MBMS security architecture
### 4.1.1 General
MBMS introduces the concept of a point-to-multipoint service into a 3GPP
system. A requirement of a MBMS User Service is to be able to securely
transmit data to a given set of users. In order to achieve this, there needs
to be a method of authentication, key distribution and data protection for a
MBMS User Service.
This means that MBMS security is specified to protect MBMS User Services, and
it is independent on whether multicast or broadcast mode is used.
NOTE: There are two cases when multicast and broadcast mode are handled
differently: usage of Membership function in authorization (see e.g. clause
4.1.1) and authorization of user related MBMS bearers (see e.g. clause 6.2.2)
are only defined for multicast mode. MBMS in EPS supports only broadcast mode
and functionality related to multicast mode does not apply to EPS.
Figure 4.1: MBMS security architecture
Figure 4.1 gives an overview of the network elements involved in MBMS from a
security perspective. Nearly all the security functionality for MBMS, except
for the normal network bearer security, resides in either the BM-SC or the UE.
The BSF is a part of GBA (TS 33.220 [6]). The UE and the BM-SC use GBA to
establish shared keys that are used to protect the point-to-point
communication between the UE and the BM-SC.
The BM-SC is a source for MBMS data. It could also be responsible for
scheduling data and receiving data from third parties (this is beyond the
scope of the standardisation work) for transmission. The BM-SC is responsible
for establishing shared secrets with the UE using GBA, authenticating the UE
with HTTP digest authentication mechanism, registering and de-registering UEs
for MBMS User Services, generating and distributing the keys necessary for
MBMS security to the UEs with MIKEY protocol and for applying the appropriate
protection to data that is transmitted as part of a MBMS User Service. The BM-
SC also provides the MBMS bearer authorisation for UEs attempting to establish
MBMS bearer.
The BM-SC also verifies whether a user is authorized to register and receive
keys for a MBMS User Service. For MBMS Multicast Mode this authorization is
done with the help of Membership function in the BM-SC. For MBMS Broadcast
Mode this authorization is done without the help of Membership function
because the Membership function is only defined in the context of MBMS
Multicast Mode in TS 23.246 [3].
The UE is responsible for establishing shared secrets with the BM-SC using
GBA, registering to and de-registering from MBMS User Services, requesting and
receiving keys for the MBMS User Service from the BM-SC and also using those
keys to decrypt the MBMS data that is received.
MBMS imposes the following requirements on the MBMS capable elements:
\- a UICC that contains MBMS key management functions shall implement GBA_U;
\- a ME that supports MBMS shall implement GBA_U and GBA_ME, and shall be
capable of utilising the MBMS key management functions on the UICC as well as
providing MBMS key management functions itself;
\- a BM-SC shall support using both GBA_ME and GBA_U keys to enable both ME
based and UICC based MBMS key management, respectively.
### 4.1.2 BM-SC sub-functions
The BM-SC has the following sub-functions related to MBMS security, see figure
4.1.
\- **Key Management function:** The Key Management function includes two sub-
functions: Key Request function and Key Distribution function.
\- **Key Request function:** The sub-function is responsible for retrieving
GBA keys from the BSF, deriving MUK and MRK from GBA keys, performing MBMS
User Service Registration, Deregistration and MSK request procedures and
related user authentication using MRK, providing MUK to Key Distribution
function, performing authorization check. The sub-function implements the
following functions and procedures:
\- Bootstrapping initiation
\- Bootstrapping re-negotiation
\- HTTP digest authentication
\- MRK derivation
\- MBMS User Service Registration procedure
\- MBMS User Service Deregistration procedure
\- MSK request procedure
\- **Key Distribution function:** The sub-function is responsible for
retrieving MUK from Registration function, generating and distributing MSKs
and MTKs to the UE, providing MTK to Session and Transmission function. The
sub-function implements the following security procedures:
\- MSK delivery procedure
\- MTK delivery procedure
\- BM-SC solicited pull procedure
\- **Session and Transmission function:** The sub-function is responsible for
session and transmission functions cf. TS 26.346 [13]. As part of these
session and transmission functions, this function performs protection of data
with MTK (encryption and/or integrity protection). The sub-function implements
the following security procedures:
\- Protection of streaming data
\- Protection of download data
\- **Membership function:** The Membership function is used to verify if a
user is authorized to register, receive keys or to establish a MBMS bearer for
MBMS Multicast Mode. The Membership function is defined only for MBMS
Multicast Mode in TS 23.246 [3].
### 4.1.3 UE security architecture
It is assumed that the UE includes a secure storage (MGV-S). This MGV-S may be
realized on the ME or on the UICC. The MGV-F is implemented in a protected
execution environment to prevent leakage of security sensitive information
such as MBMS keys. MGV-S stores the MBMS keys and MGV-F performs the functions
that should not be exposed to unprotected parts of the ME. An overview of ME
based key management and UICC based key management in UE is described in
figures 4.2a and 4.2b.
In particular in ME based key management it shall be ensured that the keys are
not exposed to unprotected parts of the ME when they are transmitted from the
UICC to the MGV-S or during the key derivations.

## 4.1A Granularity of MBMS security
An MBMS User Service is composed of one or more MBMS Streaming Sessions and/or
MBMS Download Sessions. An MBMS Streaming Session is composed of one or more
RTP sessions, and an MBMS Download Session is composed of one or more FLUTE
channels as defined in TS 26.346 [13]. MBMS streaming/download sessions may be
transported over one or more MBMS Transport Services. Transport Services are
defined in TS 22.246 [3]. MBMS security is used to protect RTP sessions and
FLUTE channels. As such MBMS User Service protection is Transport Service
independent, in particular, it is independent on whether it is carried over
point-to-point bearer or MBMS bearer (in multicast mode or in broadcast mode).
## 4.2 Key management overview
The BM-SC controls the use of the MBMS Service Keys (MSKs) to secure the
different RTP sessions and FLUTE channels. The MSKs are used to protect the
delivery of MBMS Transport Keys (MTKs), which are used to secure the RTP
sessions and FLUTE channels as specified within clauses 6.5 and 6.6. The
delivery of MSKs is secured with user specific MBMS User Key (MUK), which is
received from GBA, cf. clause 6.1. MSKs and MTKs are managed at the MBMS User
Service Level.
The following rules apply for MBMS key management:
The use of the same MTK within two different RTP sessions is not allowed
according to RFC3711 [11] section 9.1.
It shall be possible to update the MTKs during an RTP session or FLUTE channel
to enhance the security.
MSKs shall be used to protect MTKs of only one RTP session or FLUTE channel.
It shall be possible to update the MSKs during an RTP session or FLUTE channel
to enhance the security.
MSKs within one Key Group shall be used to protect MTKs of only one RTP
session or FLUTE channel. To allow smooth transition from \"current\" MSK to
the \"next\", the MGV-S shall be capable of storing two MSKs within the same
Key Group as specified in clause 6.3.2.1 of TS 33.246.
Some of the rules are illustrated in figures 4.3 and 4.4.
The usage of MSKs and MTKs applied to a RTP session or FLUTE channel (i.e.
usage of MSKs and MTKs for one Key group) is depicted in figure 4.3. Figure
4.4 shows an example of the usage of MSKs and MTKs for three RTP sessions. In
particular it shows that MSKs and MTKs of one Key Group are used to protect
exactly one RTP session.
Figure 4.3: MBMS key hierarchy: usage of MSKs and MTKs within one RTP session
or FLUTE channel
Figure 4.4: MBMS key hierarchy: usage of MSKs and MTKs for three separate RTP
sessions
According to TS 22.246 [5] there exist MBMS User Services with shared and non-
shared Transport Services. In case two MBMS User Services share an MBMS
Transport Service, they also share one or more RTP sessions or FLUTE channels
carried in the Transport Service. In this case, it shall be possible for the
MBMS User Services to share one or more MSKs and MTKs of the Key Groups that
are used to protect the MBMS data.
An example showing how key management is used with MBMS User and Transport
Services is depicted in Annex I.
As described in clause 6.6, the MTK is used as master key for SRTP (and for
corresponding SRTCP) and to protect DCF in case of download. According to RFC
3711 [11] it is mandatory to support master key lengths of 128, 192 and 256
bits for SRTP. The length of the MSK does not need to exceed the length of the
MTK, but should be at least as long.
# 5 MBMS security functions
## 5.1 Authenticating and authorizing the user
A UE is authenticated and authorised such that only legitimate users are able
to participate in an MBMS User Service.
When the UE uses HTTP protocol towards the BM-SC, the UE is authenticated with
HTTP digest as described in clause 6.2.1. The Membership function within the
BM-SC is used to verify the subscription information in MBMS Multicast Mode.
The following procedures use HTTP digest authentication:
\- MBMS User Service Registration procedure (clause 6.3.2);
\- MBMS User Service Deregistration procedure (clause 6.3.2);
\- MSK request procedure. This can have many triggers (clause 6.3.2);
\- Associated delivery procedures (specified in TS 26.346 [13]).
When the UE establishes (or releases) the MBMS bearer(s) to receive an MBMS
User Service, it is authenticated and authorized as defined in clause 6.2.2.
## 5.2 Key derivation, management and distribution
Like any service, the keys that are used to protect the transmitted data in a
MBMS User Service should be regularly changed to ensure that they are fresh.
This ensures that only legitimate users can get access to the data in the MBMS
User Service. In particular frequent re-keying acts as a deterrent for an
attacker to pass the MBMS keys to others users to allow those other users to
access the data in an MBMS User Service.
The BM-SC is responsible for the generation and distribution of the MBMS keys
to the UE. A UE has the ability to request a key when it does not have the
relevant key to decrypt the data. This request may also be initiated by a
message from the BM-SC to indicate that a new key is available.
The following function is used by the procedures listed below:
\- MRK derivation (clause 6.1);
The following procedures are involved in Key management and distribution:
\- MBMS User Service Registration procedure (clause 6.3.2);
\- MBMS User Service Deregistration procedure (clause 6.3.2);
\- MSK request procedure (clause 6.3.2);
\- MSK delivery procedure (clause 6.3.2);
\- MTK delivery procedure (clause 6.3.3);
\- BM-SC solicited pull procedure (clause 6.3.2).
## 5.3 Protection of the transmitted traffic
The traffic for a particular MBMS User Service may require some protection
depending on the sensitivity of the data being transmitted (e.g. it is
possible that the data being transmitted by the MBMS User Service is actually
protected by the DRM security method and hence might not require additional
protection. However, MBMS protection is independent of DRM protection). If
this protection is required, it will be either confidentiality and integrity
or confidentiality only, or integrity only. The protection is applied end-to-
end between the BM-SC and the UEs and will be based on a symmetric key shared
between the BM-SC and the UEs that are currently accessing the service. The
actual method of protection specified may vary depending on the type of data
being transmitted, e.g. media streaming application or file download.
NOTE: When MBMS data is received over a point-to-point MBMS radio bearer, it
would be ciphered between the BM-SC and UE and may also ciphered over the
radio interface. This \"double ciphering\" is unnecessary from a security
point of view and hence the decision of whether or not to apply radio
interface ciphering to a point-to-point MBMS radio bearer is outside the scope
of this specification.
The following traffic protection functions can be distinguished:
\- Protection of streaming data (clause 6.6.2);
\- Protection of download data (clause 6.6.3).
# 6 Security mechanisms
## 6.1 Using GBA for MBMS
TS 33.220 [6] GBA (Generic Bootstrapping Architecture) is used to agree keys
that are needed to run an MBMS User Service. The Ua security protocol
identifier that shall be used for MBMS is defined in TS 33.220 [6].
The use of 2G GBA, as specified in Annex I of TS 33.220 [6], for MBMS may be
supported as an implementation option to allow the use of SIM cards or SIMs on
UICCs.
According to TS 33.220 [6], it is possible for operators to explicitly
prohibit the use of SIMs for MBMS access based on policy configuration at the
BSF.
If the Service Announcement indicates that protection of the MBMS User Service
is applied, then the UE needs to share GBA-keys with the BM-SC. If no valid
GBA-keys are available at the UE, the UE shall perform a GBA run with the BSF
of the home network as described within TS 33.220 [6]. The BM-SC will act as a
NAF (Network Application Function) according to TS 33.220 [6].
Along with the GBA-keys the BSF shall send the IMPI of the user to the BM-SC.
When the UE has bootstrapped, it will use a new B-TID over the Ua reference
point. The IMPI is used in the BM-SC to bind the old and the new B-TID
together.
The MSKs for an MBMS User Service shall be stored on either the UICC, if the
UICC is capable of MBMS key management, or the ME, if the UICC is not capable
of MBMS key management or a SIM card is used.
Storing the MSKs on the UICC requires a UICC that contains the MBMS management
functions.
As a result of a GBA_U run, the BM-SC will share a key Ks_ext_NAF with the ME
and share a key Ks_int_NAF with the UICC. In case the UICC supports MBMS then
this key Ks_int_NAF is used by the BM-SC and the UICC as the key MUK (MBMS
User Key) to protect MSK (MBMS Service Key) deliveries to the UICC as
described within clause 6.3. The key Ks_ext_NAF is used as the key MRK (MBMS
Request Key) within the protocols as described within clause 6.2. In case the
UICC does not support MBMS then the key Ks_int_NAF can not be used for ME
based key management, but the key Ks_ext_NAF shall be used as MUK and the key
MRK is derived from the key Ks_ext_NAF by the BM-SC and the ME as specified in
Annex F of this specification.
A run of GBA_ME or 2G GBA results in the BM-SC sharing a key Ks_NAF with the
ME. Both the BM-SC and the ME use the key Ks_NAF as MUK. The key MRK is
derived from the key Ks_NAF by the BM-SC and the ME as specified in Annex F of
this specification. The key MUK is used to protect MSK deliveries to the ME as
described within clause 6.3. The key MRK is used to authenticate the UE
towards the BM-SC within the protocols as described within clause 6.2.
The MUK and MRK are identified by the combination of Bâ€‘TID and NAFâ€‘ID (without
the Ua security protocol identifier) in the UE and by Bâ€‘TID in the BM-SC,
where Bâ€‘TID and NAFâ€‘ID are defined as specified in TS 33.220 [6].
In the UE two different MUKs, i.e. the last generated and the last
successfully used, are used to guarantee that the UE and the BM-SC share
always one MUK. The last generated MUK is replaced immediately after when a
new MUK is generated and the last successfully used MUK is updated after the
successful reception of the MIKEY message, which is protected using the last
generated MUK. The usage of MUKs is described within clause 6.3.
For ME based key management:
\- All MBMS keys (MUK, MRK, MSK and MTK) shall be deleted from the ME when a
different UICC or SIM is inserted. Therefore the ME needs to store in non-
volatile memory the last inserted UICC or SIM identity to be able to compare
that with the used UICC or SIM identity at card insertion and power on.
\- All MBMS keys (MRK, MSK and MTK) may be deleted from the ME when the ME is
powered down. If the ME does not delete the MBMS keys at power down then the
MBMS keys need to be stored in non-volatile memory. The ME should store the
MUKs in non-volatile memory in order to be able to authenticate the first
MIKEY message of a BM-SC solicited pull procedure (see clause 6.3.2.2.4).
NOTE: If the ME deletes the MSK at power down, then the MBMS client would need
to request MSK to the BM-SC and may need to run GBA to reconvene an MBMS
session.
For UICC-based key management:
\- When a MSK delivery procedure has to be performed and the corresponding
Ks_int_NAF (GBA NAF key) is no longer available in the UICC, the UE shall re-
generate a Ks_int_NAF key. If the received MSK delivery procedure refers to a
Ks_int_NAF key no longer available and if the bootstrapped key Ks is
associated to the same B-TID, then the ME should re-generate Ks_int_NAF with a
GBA NAF derivation procedure. In case that the bootstrapped key Ks has been
updated, the ME should take the new B-TID into use and run the MSK request
procedure towards the BM-SC which retrieves the latest Ks_int_NAF from the
BSF.
\- The ME shall control the deletion of MUKs stored on the UICC. When the ME
wants to free up storage in the UICC for new MUK, the ME selects the MUK no
longer needed to be deleted. If a MUK is deleted then the corresponding GBA
NAF Keys (i.e. GBA NAF Keys with same NAF-ID) shall be deleted; the
bootstrapped key Ks shall also be deleted if Ks is present and associated to
the same B-TID.
## 6.2 Authentication and authorisation of a user
### 6.2.1 Authentication and authorisation in HTTP procedures
#### 6.2.1.1 General
This clause describes authentication of the user to the BM-SC when using HTTP
digest with bootstrapped security associations.
#### 6.2.1.2 Bootstrapping
The BM-SC shall implement,initiation of bootstrapping and bootstrapping
renegotiation procedures over Ua as specified in TS 33.220 [6] and in TS
24.109 [18]. The Ua interface procedures shall use MRK.
#### 6.2.1.3 HTTP digest authentication
When the UE initiates an HTTP procedure towards the BM-SC, HTTP digest
authentication as defined in RFC 2617 [8] shall be used for mutual
authentication. HTTP digest is run between BM-SC and ME. The MBMS
authentication procedure is based on the general user authentication procedure
over Ua interface that is specified in clause \"Procedures using the
bootstrapped Security Association\" in TS 33.220 [6]. The BM-SC will act as a
NAF according to TS 33.220 [6]. Along with the GBA-keys the BSF shall send the
IMPI of the user to the BM-SC. The details of HTTP digest authentication are
specified in clause 5.2 of TS 24.109 [18]
The following adaptations apply to HTTP digest:
\- the B-TID as specified in TS 33.220 [6] is used as username;
\- MRK (MBMS Request Key) is used as password.
All HTTP procedures within this specification including the associated
delivery procedures in TS 26.346 [13] shall be integrity protected with HTTP
digest as specified in this clause. In addition, the associated delivery
procedures may be confidentiality protected as specified in clause 6.7 of this
document.
### 6.2.2 Authentication and authorisation in MBMS bearer establishment
As defined in TS 23.246 [3] MBMS bearer establishment applies only to
multicast mode. The authentication of the UE during MBMS bearer establishment
relies on the authenticated point-to-point connection with the network, which
was set up using network security described in TS 33.102 [4] or TS 43.020
[12]. Authorisation for the MBMS bearer establishment happens by the network
making an authorisation request to the BM-SC to ensure that the UE is allowed
to establish the MBMS bearer(s) corresponding to an MBMS User Service (see TS
23.246 [3] for the details). As MBMS bearer establishment authorisation lies
outside the control of the MBMS bearer network (i.e. it is controlled by the
BM-SC), there is an additional procedure to remove the MBMS bearer(s) related
to a UE that is no longer authorised to access an MBMS User Service.
NOTE: MBMS in EPS supports only broadcast mode and functionality described in
this clause applies only to multicast mode.
### 6.2.3 Void
### 6.2.4 Void
## 6.3 Key management procedures
### 6.3.1 General
In order to protect an MBMS User Service, it is necessary to deliver both MSKs
and MTKs from the BM-SC to the UE.
MSK procedures are further divided to MSK request procedures, described in
clause 6.3.2.2, and MSK delivery procedure, described in clause 6.3.2.3. MSK
procedures use a point-to-point bearer. MSK procedures are similar for both
streaming and download services.
MBMS key management messages shall use a non-real time PDP context of QoS
class \"background\" or \"interactive\" as defined by TS 23.107 [23] or PDN
connection with similar QoS properties as defined TS 23.203 [30].
NOTE: In UTRAN the PS radio resources for a PDP context of QoS class
\"background\" and \"interactive\" can be released and re-established on
request of the network, while the IP address remains assigned to the PDP
context. If the radio resources were released and the BM-SC wants to deliver
an MSK (see clause 6.3.2.3) the network will page the UE. Similar
functionality applies to PDN connections in E-UTRAN.
The BM-SC shall store the IP-address which was assigned for the PDP context
for further key management usage. The BM-SC receives the IP address of the UE
from the source IP address field of the MBMS User Service Registration
message. It shall be ensured by the network that the original source UE IP
address is visible to the BM-SC.
The operator may configure the BM-SC to refrain from pushing the MSK update
message to the UE and let the UE request for the MSK. This may be needed in
some download services where the UE fetches the MSK after receiving encrypted
download object. In this case the back-off mode as described in clause
6.3.2.2.1 shall be used if present within the Service Announcement.
MTK delivery procedures use the same bearer as the MBMS User Service. MTK
delivery procedures are different for streaming and download services and they
are described in clause 6.3.3.
The details of the HTTP procedures and HTTP error situations are specified in
Annex G. An example of detailed MSK request procedure is described in Annex H.
The XML schemas of the HTTP payloads are specified in TS 26.346 [13].
### 6.3.2 MSK procedures
#### 6.3.2.1 MSK identification
Every MSK is uniquely identifiable by its Key Domain ID and MSK ID
where
Key Domain ID = MCC \|\| MNC and is 3 bytes long.
NOTE 1: When MCC \|\| MNC is used as key identifier, the UE should not try to
use it in another context, e.g. the UE should not compare the received MCC
\|\| MNC to parameters in radio level.
MSK ID is 4 bytes long and with byte 0 and 1 containing the Key Group part,
and byte 2 and 3 containing the Key Number part. The Key Number part is used
to distinguish MSKs that have the same Key Domain ID and Key Group part. The
Key Number part value zero (0x0) is reserved for special use to denote the
current MSK. Key Group part is used to group keys together in order to allow
redundant MSKs to be deleted. The Key Group part value zero (0x0) is not
allowed as it is reserved for future use. The MSK ID is carried in the
extension payload of MIKEY extension payload.
NOTE 2: If the Key Domain ID does not uniquely identify the BM-SC, it needs to
be ensured that the Key Group parts are unique within an operator, i.e. two
BMâ€‘SCs within an operator shall not use the same Key Group value. unless
multiple BM-SC deployment is used as is defined in clause 6.3.4
#### 6.3.2.1A MBMS User Service Registration procedure
When a UE has received MBMS User Service information, which indicates that the
service is protected, via User Service Discovery / Announcement procedures
describing a MBMS User Service, and the user wants to receive that MBMS User
Service, the UE shall register to the MBMS User Service. Registration is
required to ensure that the UE receives the necessary MSK updates.
MBMS User Service Registration shall be performed by the UE irrespective of
the type of MBMS Transport Service i.e. in multicast mode or broadcast mode,
as soon as the user first indicates that he wants to receive the MBMS User
Service. In addition, it shall be performed at subsequent power on, unless the
user has previously indicated that he/she no longer wants to receive the MBMS
User Service, or unless the USIM or SIM has changed.
NOTE 1: The User Service Discovery / Announcement procedures are specified in
TS 26.346 [13]. It is out of the scope of the present specification how the UE
receives the User Service information and how the User Service is triggered in
the UE.
NOTE 2: The MBMS User Service announcements are not protected when sent over
MBMS bearer.
The UE shall not release the PDP context used by the MBMS User Service
Registration until an MBMS User Service De-registration has been performed.
This is to ensure that the BM-SC is aware of the correct UE IP address for the
purpose of performing MSK deliveries from the BM-SC as specified in clause
6.3.2.2.4 and clause 6.3.2.3.1.
If the UE detects that a PDP context, which is used for MBMS key management,
is released by the network, the UE should try to re-run MBMS User Service
Registration for those MBMS User Services which were using the released PDP
context for MBMS key management. For performing these re-registrations the UE
may establish a new PDP context or the UE may use some other existing
appropriate PDP context as defined in clause 6.3.1, if available. This is to
ensure that the BM-SC becomes aware of the new UE IP address for the purpose
of performing MSK deliveries from the BM-SC. Any new registrations should
override any existing registrations of the UE to the same MBMS User Services.
If the MBMS User Service does not require any protection (i.e. if a service
protection description is not present in the Service Announcement), the UE
shall not perform User Service Registration for key management purposes, which
means that the UE needs no shared secret with the BM-SC and should therefore
not perform a GBA-run with BSF for MBMS (e.g. if no shared secret for MBMS is
available in the UE).
The UE shall receive the following information via the User Service Discovery
/ Announcement procedures if protection of the MBMS User Service is applied:
\- One or more fully qualified domain names (FQDN) of the key management
servers (i.e. the BM-SC). This is for the UE to know to which IP address to
send within the MBMS User Service Registration/Deregistration and MSK request
Procedures. One or more FQDNs may be indicated in the Service Announcement for
load balancing purposes. The UE shall choose the FQDN at the registration
phase with the same mechanism as the File Repair Server is selected in TS
26.346 [13]. The UE shall keep the same FQDN for subsequent key management
procedures.
\- UICC key management required: yes/ no.
\- 2G GBA allowed: yes/no
If the flag 2G GBA is not present then 2G GBA is not allowed.
\- MIKEY FEC-protection, as defined in TS 26.346 [13], may be specified in the
service protection description if MIKEY is FEC protected and encapsulated in
FEC source packets.
\- Identifiers of the MSKs needed for the User Service.
For each MSK, the identifiers that shall be included are Key Domain ID and MSK
ID. The Key Number part of each MSK ID shall be set to 0x0 to denote the
current MSK. The Key Number values in the Service Announcement shall be
ignored by the UE, since they may change over time and Key Group part of MSK
ID is sufficient to identify the MSKs, see clause 6.3.2.1.
\- Mapping information how the MSKs are used to protect the different RTP
sessions or FLUTE channels.
NOTE 3: Void
NOTE 4: Void
\- Back off mode parameters, as defined in TS 26.346 [13], may be specified
for MSK requests, if wanted by the service provider. These parameters are then
valid for all MSKs in the user service. The Back off mode is used to avoid
congestion in MSK requests. In the rare cases that more than one User Service
share the same MSK, but have different back off parameters, the UE is allowed
to choose which ones to use. The Back off mode is optional to implement in the
BM-SC and mandatory to implement in the UE. The UE shall use Back off mode if
it is requested by the BM-SC in the Service Announcement.
The UE shall not register for an MBMS user service if it does not have enough
storage available for any additional MSKs and MTKs required for that service.
The UE should delete MSKs and MTKs that are no longer needed in order to free
up storage for new MSKs and MTKs. For UICC-based key management, the ME shall
control the deletion of MSKs stored on the UICC.
NOTE 4a: It is up to the ME implementation as to which keys are not needed any
longer.
In case the service protection description indicates that the UICC key
management is required, the UE should only try to access the MBMS User Service
if the selected UICC application is capable of MBMS key management.
In case the service protection description indicates that UICC key management
is not required, the use of either UICC key management or ME key management
for a particular UE, depends on if the used UICC application is capable of
MBMS key management or not, i.e. if the used UICC application is capable of
MBMS key management, then UICC key management shall be used.
In case the service protection description indicates that UICC key management
is not required and 2G GBA is not allowed, the UE should only try to access
the MBMS User Service if a USIM is present in the UE as the use of SIM is not
allowed for this MBMS User Service.
In case the service protection description indicates that UICC key management
is not required and 2G GBA is allowed, the use of either 2G or 3G GBA for a
particular UE depends on whether a UICC with a USIM is present in the UE or
not as defined in TS 33.220 [6]. I.e., if a UICC with a USIM is present then
3G GBA shall be used, and if no UICC with a USIM is present then a SIM
together with 2G GBA shall be used. The service protection description shall
not allow 2G GBA and require UICC key management at the same time.
Figure 6.0A: MBMS User Service Registration procedure
The communication between the UE and the BM-SC is authenticated and integrity
protected with HTTP Digest using bootstrapped security association as
described in clause 6.2.1 of this specification.
The UE sends a registration request for the MBMS User Service using the HTTP
POST message to the BM-SC Key Request function. The following information
shall be included in the HTTP message.
\- Indication that the UE requests to register to the MBMS User Service;
\- A list of one or more MBMS User Service IDs.
The BM-SC Key Request function authenticates the UE with HTTP Digest using MRK
key as described in clause 6.2.1.
If the authentication is successful, the BM-SC Key Request function shall
verify whether the UE is authorized to register to the MBMS User Service(s)
specified in the request. If the UE is authorized, the BM-SC Key Request
function registers the UE to the MBMS User Service(s), which means that the UE
is registered to receive the MSKs used in these MBMS User Service(s). The BM-
SC Key Request function sends a HTTP 200 OK message with Authentication-Info
header to the UE. The following information shall be included in the payload
of the HTTP response message:
\- A list including one status code for each MBMS User Service ID that was
present in the Registration request.
The handling of multiple status codes in one response message is specified in
clause 6.3.2.4.
NOTE 5: The BM-SC may not need to challenge the UE (dashed box in figure
6.0A), if the UE has used WWW Authorization request headers in the first
message in figure 6.0A and BM-SC is able to authenticate the UE.
If the authentication fails, the BM-SC Key Request function resends HTTP 401
Authorization required message with the WWW-Authenticate header.
The UE checks the validity of the HTTP response message. If the message
indicated failure in the HTTP status line, the UE may retry to send the
request message.
The UE shall check the status codes in the payload and act accordingly. For
example, the UE may retry to register to the MBMS User Service(s) that were
indicated to have failed. Further error cases are described in clause G.2.4.
The BM-SC Key Distribution function initiates MSK delivery procedure(s) as
specified in clause 6.3.2.3 for those MBMS User Services for which the
response message indicated success. The BM-SC may decide to not initiate MSK
key delivery procedures, if the combination of services is such that it only
makes sense to use all of them simultaneously.
NOTE 6: The time between the MBMS User Service Registration procedure and MSK
delivery procedures may vary, i.e. the UE should not expect the MSK delivery
procedures to start immediately.
#### 6.3.2.1B MBMS User Service Deregistration procedure
When the user desires to deregister from one or more MBMS User Services, the
UE shall perform an MBMS User Service De-registration. This shall be done
irrespective of the type of MBMS Transport Service i.e. in multicast mode or
in broadcast mode.
The UE shall also perform an MBMS User Service De-registration, at UE power
down, for all ongoing MBMS User Services to ensure that the BM-SC is made
aware that the user is no longer contactable.
It may happen that the UE is unable to perform a MBMS User Service De-
registration for all ongoing MBMS User Services e.g. due to uncontrolled power
down or loss of coverage. This could lead to situations where the BM-SC wants
to initiate an MSK delivery procedure (see clause 6.3.2.3) towards an
unreachable UE.
Figure 6.0B: MBMS User Service Deregistration procedure
The communication between the UE and the BM-SC is authenticated and integrity
protected with HTTP Digest using bootstrapped security association as
described in clause 6.2.1 of this specification.
The UE sends a deregistration request for the MBMS User Service using the HTTP
POST message to the BM-SC Key Request function. The following information
shall be included in the HTTP message.
\- Indication that the UE requests to deregister from the MBMS User Service;
\- A list of one or more MBMS User Service IDs.
The BM-SC Key Request function authenticates the UE with HTTP Digest using MRK
key as described in clause 6.2.1.
If the authentication is successful, the BM-SC Key Request function
deregisters the UE from the MBMS User Service(s), which means that the UE will
no longer receive the MSKs used in these MBMS User Service(s). The BM-SC Key
Request function sends a HTTP 200 OK message with Authentication-Info header
to the UE. The following information shall be included in the payload of the
HTTP response message:
\- A list including one status code for each MBMS User Service ID that was
present in the De-Registration request.
The handling of multiple status codes in one response message is specified in
clause 6.3.2.4.
NOTE: The BM-SC may not need to challenge the UE (dashed box in figure 6.0B),
if the UE has used WWW Authorization request headers in the first message in
figure 6.0.B and BM-SC is able to authenticate the UE.
If the authentication fails then the BM-SC Key Request function resends HTTP
401 Authorization required message with the WWW-Authenticate header.
The UE checks the validity of the HTTP response message. If the message
indicated failure in the HTTP status line, the UE may retry to send the
request message. The UE shall check the status codes in the payload and act
accordingly. Error cases are described in clause G.2.4.
The BM-SC should invalidate those MSKs from the UE, which are not used by any
other MBMS User Services where the UE is registered. The BM-SC Key
Distribution function performs this by running MSK delivery procedure for each
MSK, where the Key Validity data is set to invalid value (see clause 6.3.2.3),
i.e. SEQl is greater than SEQu.
#### 6.3.2.2 MSK request procedures
##### 6.3.2.2.1 Basic MSK request procedure
When a UE detects that it needs the MSK(s) for a specific MBMS User Service,
the UE should try to get the MSKs that will be used to protect the data
transmitted as part of this MBMS User Service. In the MSK request procedure
the UE shall list the Key Domain ID - MSK ID pairs for which the UE needs the
MSK(s). The UE shall always (except in the case of a BM-SC solicited pull)
wait a period of time as specified by the back-off parameters in the User
Service Description (if they are present) before making a request.
The basic MSK request procedure is a part of different other procedures, e.g.:
\- request of MSK(s) when the UE has missed a key update procedure e.g. due to
being out of coverage.
\- BM-SC solicited pull procedure.
Figure 6.1: Basic MSK request procedure
The communication between the UE and the BM-SC is authenticated and integrity
protected with HTTP Digest using bootstrapped security association as
described in clause 6.2.1 of this specification.
The UE requests for one or several MSKs using the HTTP POST message. The
following information is included in the HTTP message.
\- key identification information: a list of one or several Key Domain ID -
MSK ID pairs.
UEs may request specific MSK(s) by setting the Key Number part of the MSK ID
to the requested value. When the Key Number part of the MSK ID is set to 0x0,
this means the current MSK, see clause 6.3.2.1. The UE may request MSK(s)
associated to more than one MBMS User Service in the same MSK request
procedure.
The BM-SC Key Request function authenticates the UE with HTTP Digest using the
keys received from GBA as described in clause 6.2.1.
If the authentication is successful, the BM-SC Key Request function shall
verify whether the UE is registered to any MBMS User Service that uses the
MSKs specified in the request. If the UE is authorized, the BM-SC Key
Distribution function shall deliver requested MSKs to the UE (see clause
6.3.2.3). The BM-SC sends a HTTP 200 OK message with Authentication-Info
header. The following information shall be included in the payload of the HTTP
response message:
\- A list including one status code for each Key Domain ID - MSK ID pair that
was present in the Registration request.
The handling of multiple status codes in one response message is specified in
clause 6.3.2.4.
NOTE 1: The BM-SC may not need to challenge the UE (dashed box in figure 6.1),
if the UE has used WWW Authorization request headers in the first message in
figure 6.1 and BM-SC is able to authenticate the UE.
If the authentication fails then the BM-SC Key Request function resends HTTP
401 Authorization required message with the WWW-Authenticate header.
The UE checks the validity of the HTTP response message. If the message
indicated failure in the HTTP status line, the UE may retry to send the
request message.
The UE shall check the status codes in the payload and act accordingly. For
example, the UE may retry to request those MSKs that were indicated to have
failed or leave the MBMS User Service.
If the HTTP procedure above resulted to success, the BM-SC Key Distribution
function initiates MSK delivery procedure as specified in clause 6.3.2.3.
##### 6.3.2.2.2 Void
##### 6.3.2.2.3 Missed key update procedure
When the UE has missed an MSK update and it detects that it has not got the
current MSK, e.g. from the received traffic, it may trigger the retrieval of
the current MSK from the BM-SC. The procedure is the same as the Basic MSK
request procedure in clause 6.3.2.2.1.
##### 6.3.2.2.4 BM-SC solicited pull procedure
While the push is the regular way of updating the MSK to the UE, there may be
situations where the BM-SC Key Distribution function solicits the UE to
contact the BM-SC and request for new MSK. An example of such a situation is
when the BM-SC Key Distribution function wants to trigger the UE that it needs
to update the MSK.
Figure 6.2b: BM-SC solicited pull
The BM-SC Key Distribution function sends a MIKEY message over UDP to the UE.
The MIKEY message shall be protected by the last MUK known by the BM-SC. The
Key Number part of the MSK ID in the extension payload of the MIKEY message
shall be set to 0x0 to indicate that the UE should request for current MSK
from the BM-SC.
If the received MUK_ID (i.e. the last MUK known by the BM-SC) does not
correspond to the last MUK known by the UE, then the UE checks the solicited
pull MIKEY message with the last MUK successfully used by the BM-SC.
The BM-SC shall not set the V-bit in the common header when initiating the BM-
SC solicited pull procedure.
NOTE 1: A MUK may be used by the BM-SC Key Distribution function beyond the
GBA key lifetime of the corresponding Ks_xx_NAF for the purpose of using the
MUK within the first MIKEY message of a push solicited pull procedure.
NOTE 2: Since the integrity of the MIKEY message still needs to be assured, a
KEMAC payload shall be included in the MIKEY message from the BM-SC Key
Distribution function. There is however no key present in the message. Thus by
setting the Encr data len field to zero, only the MAC of the message will be
included.
When receiving the message, the UE shall request for the current MSK for the
specified Key Group as specified in clause 6.3.2.2.1.
A situation where the use of the solicited pull procedure is needed for the
BM-SC to be able to update successfully MSK's to a UE is when the BM-SC has
chosen the MUK lifetime less than the GBA key lifetime of the corresponding
Ks_xx_NAF, and the MUK lifetime has expired in the BM-SC. In that case the BM-
SC should initiate the BM-SC solicited pull procedure and answer to the HTTP
POST of Figure 6.2b with a Bootstrapping Renegotiation Request according to TS
33.220 [6].
#### 6.3.2.3 MSK delivery procedures
##### 6.3.2.3.1 Pushing the MSK to the UE
The BM-SC Key Distribution function controls when the MSKs used in a MBMS User
Service are to be changed. The below flow describes how MSK changes are
performed. This procedure can be initiated after the UE has requested for
MSK(s) as described in clause 6.3.2.2.
Figure 6.3: Pushing the MSKs to the UE
When the BM-SC Key Distribution function decides that it is time to update the
MSK, the BM-SC Key Distribution function sends MIKEY message over UDP
transporting the requested MSK to the UE.
If requested by the BM-SC Key Distribution function, the UE sends a MIKEY
acknowledgement message to the BM-SC.
NOTE: The MSK is not necessarily updated in the message, since a MSK transport
message can be sent e.g. to update the Key Validity data.
When an MSK push MIKEY message is not directly preceded by an MSK key request,
then it may happen that the BM-SC uses a still valid MUK that is not the last
generated MUK at the UE. The UE shall handle such a MIKEY push message in a
similar way as the push solicited pull MIKEY message (i.e. upon a successful
integrity check the UE shall initiate an MSK request with the specified Key
Group). Additionally, in this case, the UE shall not create a MIKEY
acknowledgement message.
NOTE: This procedure guarantees that the UE contacts the BM-SC with the last
B-TID, such that the UE now receives a MIKEY push message with the last
generated MUK. The integrity of the initial pushed MIKEY message can be
verified at the UE with the MUK-ID that is known as the last successfully used
BM-SC MUK-ID.
##### 6.3.2.3.2 Void
#### 6.3.2.4 Handling of multiple status codes within one response message
The UE shall include a list of one or more MBMS User Service IDs (in MBMS User
Service registration and de-registration procedures) or MSK ID-Key Domain ID
-pairs (in MSK request procedure) in the payload of one HTTP request message.
When the BM-SC has processed the request message, it shall include a list of
corresponding status codes in the HTTP response message, i.e. a status code
for each MBMS User Service ID or MSK ID-Key Domain ID -pair. The status codes
are carried in the payload of the HTTP response message and they use the
values as specified in RFC 2616 [19]. A successful code, e.g. 200 OK, means
that the (de-) registration or MSK request for that specific MBMS User Service
ID or MSK was successful. The MBMS specific error codes are described in
clause G.2.4.
There is also a status code in the status line of the HTTP response message,
which has a successful value if the BM-SC was able to successfully process the
corresponding request message. Otherwise the status code in the HTTP status
line shall indicate the appropriate error.
NOTE 1: This means that there are two levels of status codes in the response
message: the status code in the HTTP status line that is specific to the HTTP
message and processed by the HTTP application and the one or more status codes
in the payload that are specific to and processed by the MBMS application.
In case the response message does not include all the same status codes in the
payload that were in the request message, the UE may still process the status
codes that it is able to process.
The list of status codes is also used in case only one MSK or registration is
requested. Figure 6.4 below illustrates an example of a UE trying to register
to two MBMS User Services. The registration is successful for the first but
fails for the second MBMS User service. The example procedure shows only
parameters that are relevant for the functionality in question.
Figure 6.4: Example registration procedure
### 6.3.3 MTK procedures
#### 6.3.3.1 MTK identification
Every MTK is uniquely identifiable by its Key Domain ID, MSK ID and MTK ID
where
Key Domain ID and MSK ID are as defined in clause 6.3.2.1.
> MTK ID is 2 bytes long sequence number and is used to distinguish MTKs that
> have the same Key Domain ID and MSK ID. It is carried in the MTK ID field of
> MIKEY extension payload. Every time a MSK with a new MSK ID is taken into
> use by the BM-SC, the MTK ID of the first MTK sent by the BM-SC protected by
> that MSK shall be set to an initial value greater than zero chosen by the
> BM-SC.
NOTE 1: In most situations the practical choice for the initial MTK ID will be
one, but this does not prevent the BM-SC to choose a value different for each
service and greater than one.
> _The MTK ID that will be used in a next MTK update needs to be greater than
> the previously used MTK-ID._
NOTE 2: The practical choice to increment is 1 but also other increments are
allowed.
NOTE 3: As the MTK ID is 2 bytes long, this allows to use 2 ^16^ -2 MTKs
protected by one MSK if the MTK-ID is always incremented by one and the
initial MTK ID starts at 1. The maximum value for MTK ID is disallowed (see
clause 6.4.5.1).
#### 6.3.3.2 MTK update procedure
The MTK is delivered to the UE using MIKEY over UDP, but the V-bit in the
common header shall not be set.
The UE shall not send an error message to the BM-SC as a result of receiving
an MTK message.
##### 6.3.3.2.1 MTK delivery in download
In the download case the MIKEY message carrying the MTK shall be delivered
over the same FLUTE stream as the object to be downloaded to the UE (see TS
26.346 [13]). This means that the message is specified as a separate object in
the FLUTE File Delivery Table (FDT), having its own identifier. This means the
MTK delivery inherits the reliability features of FLUTE. The mime-type of the
object carrying the MIKEY message shall be the IANA-registered type for MIKEY.
##### 6.3.3.2.2 MTK delivery in streaming
MIKEY messages transporting MTKs shall be sent using the same IP destination
address as the RTP traffic. MIKEY messages shall be transported to UDP port
number 2269 specified for MIKEY. Reliability of MTK delivery is reached by re-
sending MTK messages periodically.
NOTE: Re-sending of MTK message will also allow the UE to faster switch
between SRTP streams.
In order to increase the possibility that UEs receive a new MTK in time, MTK
messages may be sent before the RTP traffic changes over to a new MTK.
### 6.3.4 Multiple BM-SC deployments
#### 6.3.4.1 General
The requirements in the following sub-clauses apply when one and the same MBMS
User Service is transmitted via multiple BM-SCs, as this case requires some
coordination between the BM-SCs regarding MBMS key management.
#### 6.3.4.2 Service announcement coordination
When one and the same MBMS User Service is transmitted via multiple BM-SCs the
service shall be announced with one Service Announcement indicating common
security protectection description for the involved BM-SCs.
#### 6.3.X.3 MSK key management anchor point
The UE shall register to one BM-SC indicated in the Service Announcement and
shall keep the same BM-SC for all subsequent MSK management procedures as
defined in clause 6.3.2.1A.
NOTE: The MSK key management can be kept on the original BM-SC even though the
UE could move under a new BM-SC. This is because the MSK key management uses
the PDP/PDN connection.
#### 6.3.4.4 MSK coordination
The BM-SCs shall use MSKs in a synchronized way. At a certain point in time
the same MSK (identified by the Key Domain ID, MSK Key Group and Key Number
part) shall be used in all BM-SCs per a streaming or download session. When
the MSK needs to be updated, the BM-SCs shall take the new MSK (identified by
the Key Number part) into use at the same time. This is to ensure that the BM-
SCs are able to use the MTKs in a synchronized way. For MSK key management
anchor point see clause 6.3.X.3.
#### 6.3.4.5 MTK coordination
The BM-SCs shall use MTKs in a synchronized way. At a certain point in time
the same MTK (identified by the MTK ID as defined in clause 6.3.3.1) shall be
used in all BM-SCs per a streaming or download session. When the MTK needs to
be updated, the BM-SCs shall take the new MTK into use at the same point in
time. This is to ensure that a UE that moves under a new BM-SC, which is
transmitting the same MBMS User Service as the old BM-SC, is able to decrypt
the service without interruption. The BM-SCs transmitting the same MBMS User
Service may transmit identical content or slightly different content, e.g.
local news. Especially in the latter case it is important that the update of
the MTK happens at the same point in time and is not based on the amount of
content (packets or files) sent in the streaming or download session since the
amount of content may vary between the BM-SCs. This is to ensure that the BM-
SCs keep synchronized in their use of MTKs regardless of the amount of content
sent.
#### 6.3.4.6 MIKEY MTK timestamp coordination
MBMS uses counter-based MIKEY timestamps as specified in clause 6.4.3. The BM-
SCs shall use MIKEY timestamps in MTK delivery messages in a synchronized way.
At a certain point in time the same MIKEY MTK timestamp shall be used in all
BM-SCs for a streaming or download session.
NOTE: There is no need to synchronize the MIKEY timestamp for MSK delivery
messages as the MSK messages are sent from one BM-SC, see also clause 6.3.X.3.
When the same MBMS User Service is transmitted via multiple BM-SCs it may
happen that the BM-SCs send different amount of MTK delivery messages within a
streaming or download session. This will result to that the MIKEY MTK
timestamps are not in synchronization between the BM-SCs, and that a UE that
moves under a new BM-SC is not able to decrypt the service without
interruption due to replay protection.
The BM-SCs may keep synchronization for the use of MIKEY MTK timestamps by
sending the same amount of MIKEY MTK delivery messages at the same pace.
However, this may not always be possible e.g. due to different amount of
content transmitted by the BM-SCs. Another possibility is that the BM-SCs
increase the MIKEY MTK timestamp based on NTP UTC time regardless of how many
MIKEY MTK delivery messages are sent, and add the first 32 most significant
bits (i.e. the integral part) of NTP UTC time to the counter-based timestamp
payload field of MIKEY MTK messages. This ensures that the BM-SCs are
synchronized and the UE will treat the timestamp as a counter.
## 6.4 MIKEY message creation and processing in the ME
### 6.4.1 General
MIKEY is used to transport the MSKs and MTKs from the BM-SC to the UE. Clauses
6.4.2, 6.4.3, 6.4.4 and 6.4.5 describe how to create the MIKEY messages, while
clause 6.4.6 describes the initial processing by the ME on these messages. The
final processing is done by the MBMS key Generation and Validation Function
(MGV-F) and is described in clause 6.5.
MIKEY shall be used with pre-shared keys as described in RFC 3830 [9]. The UDP
port number for MIKEY is 2269 (see Port Numbers at IANA [17]).
To keep track of MSKs and MTKs, a new Extension Payload (EXT) as defined in
RFC 4563 [16] is added to MIKEY. The Extension Payload can contain the key
types and identities of MSK and the MTK and Key Domain ID (see clauses 6.3.2
and 6.3.3).
Some MIKEY payloads contain text strings, e.g., the IDi and IDr payloads.
These strings shall be encoded according to UTF-8 as defined in RFC 3629 [21].
In case MIKEY packets are FEC-protected (see TS 26.346 [13]), this is
signalled within the MBMS User Service Description.
As MIKEY is used in a key transport mode, the key derivation function as
defined in section 4.1.4 of RFC 3830 [9] shall be used for MIKEY internal keys
and MIKEY internal salt. The preshared key used for transmission of MSK is the
MUK, and the pre-shared key used for transmission of MTK is the MSK.
The size of the authentication key to be used to verify the MAC field of a
MIKEY message shall be 160 bits.
### 6.4.2 MIKEY common header
MSKs shall be carried in MIKEY messages. The messages are sent point-to-point
between the BM-SC and each UE. The messages use the MUK shared between the BM-
SC and the UE as the pre-shared secret in MIKEY.
Once the MSK is in place in the UE, the UE can make use of the MTK messages
sent by the BM-SC over MBMS bearer. The MTK is carried in messages conforming
to the structure defined by MIKEY and use the MSK as the pre-shared secret.
If the BM-SC requires an ACK for an MSK key update message this is indicated
by setting the V-bit in the MIKEY common header. The UE shall then respond
with a MIKEY message containing the verification payload. In the case the
server does not receive an ACK, normal reliability constructions can be used,
e.g., start a timer when the message is sent and then resend the message if no
ACK is received before the timer expires.
The CSB ID field of MIKEY common header is not used for identification
purposes but shall be present in both MSK messages and MTK messages.
NOTE: As the CSB ID field has no meaning within the context of MBMS, the BM-SC
is free to assign any value to CSB ID. Assigning random values to CSB ID
enhances security as CSB ID is taken into account for MIKEY key derivations
(section 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 of RFC 3830 [9]).
### 6.4.3 Replay protection
Each MIKEY message contains the timestamp field (TS) of type 2. This means
that the contents of the timestamp field is a 32-bit counter. The counter
shall be increased by one for each MSK message sent from the BM-SC to the UE
even in case BM-SC retransmits a previously sent MSK message. The counter
shall be increased by one for each new MTK message created in the BM-SC.
NOTE: The BM-SC is allowed to retransmit a previously sent MTK message for
streaming in order to provide a higher reliability of MTK delivery (cfr
section 6.3.3.2.2) without having to increment the TS field for each sent MTK
message. As specified in step 2 of clause 6.4.6.2, the ME will discard
duplicate MTK messages based on the last received TS.
There is one counter per UE for MSK delivery, and one counter common to all
UEs for MTK delivery. The counter is used for replay protection; messages with
a counter less than or equal to the current counter are discarded. Less than
or equal is to be taken in the meaning of RFC1982 [10]. If the less than or
equal relation is undefined in the sense of RFC1982 [10], the message should
be considered as being replayed and shall be discarded. The counter in the TS
field shall be reset for MSK transport messages when the MUK is updated. The
counter in the TS field shall be reset for MTK transport messages when the MSK
is updated.
### 6.4.4 General extension payload
The MSK and MTK shall be delivered in messages that conform to the structure
defined in RFC 3830 [9] (MIKEY). To be able to keep track of the key that is
derived in the message, a general Extension Payload (EXT) is used that
conforms to the structure defined in reference RFC 4563 [16].
The EXT includes a Key Domain ID and one or two Key Type ID sub-payloads
depending on the message. These are used as follows.
For MSK delivery the EXT includes the Key Domain ID and a Key Type ID sub-
payload. The Key Domain ID has the value as specified in clause 6.3.2.1. The
Key Type ID sub-payload includes the type and ID of the key that is delivered
in the message, i.e. the MSK ID, see figure 6.4a. The key that is used to
protect the message, i.e. MUK, is identified as specified in clause 6.1.
For MTK delivery the EXT includes the Key Domain ID and two Key Type ID sub-
payloads. The Key Domain ID has the value as specified in clause 6.3.2.1. The
first Key Type ID sub-payload includes the type and ID of the key that is used
to protect the message, i.e. the MSK ID, and the second Key Type ID sub-
payload includes the type and ID of the key that is delivered in the message,
i.e. the MTK ID, see figure 6.4b.
See clauses 6.3.2.1 and 6.3.3.1 for definition of MSK ID and MTK ID. The MTK
ID is increased every time the corresponding key is updated. It is possible
that the same MTK is delivered several times over MBMS bearer, and the ME can
then discard messages related to a key it already has instead of passing them
to the MGV-F.
The MGV-F (see clause 6.5) protects itself from a possibly malicious ME by
checking the integrity and freshness of the MIKEY message.
The format of the key IDs shall be represented by unsigned integers.
Figure 6.4a: Extension payload used with MIKEY MSK message
Figure 6. 4b: Extension payload used with MIKEY MTK message
### 6.4.5 MIKEY message structure
#### 6.4.5.1 MSK message structure
The following applies for both streaming services and download services:
\- The structure of the MIKEY message carrying a MSK key shall be according to
Figure 6.5. (For handling of unknown MIKEY extension payloads in MGV-F, cf.
clause 6.5.3.).
\- The actual MSK key that is delivered is kept in the KEMAC payload. Only one
MSK key shall be transported in the KEMAC payload.
\- The format of the EXT payload is as described in chapter 6.4.4.
\- The MIKEY-RAND is used to derive e.g. encryption and authentication keys
from the received keys. It is sent in all the MSK delivery messages. A UE and
BM-SC shall support a MIKEY-RAND of 128-bit.For a specific MSK (identified by
the MSK ID including the Key Number part) within an MBMS streaming or download
session, the same MIKEY-RAND shall be used in MSK delivery messages for all
UEs. This ensures that all UEs will use the same MIKEY-RAND for MTK message
processing, cf. clause 6.5.4.
\- The identity payloads of the initiator\'s and responder\'s IDs shall be
included in the MSK transport messages. IDi is the ID (i.e. FQDN) of the BM-SC
(i.e. NAFâ€‘ID without the Ua security protocol identifier) and IDr is the ID of
the UE\'s username (i.e. Bâ€‘TID). The ID Type field of IDi and IDr payloads
shall be set to value 0 (=NAI). As the content of the IDi field is not a NAI,
but a FQDN of the BM-SC, the ID Type field of the IDi payload shall be ignored
by the receiver and the ID data field shall be handled as a text string.
NOTE: NAF-ID without the Ua security protocol identifier (i.e. FQDN of BM-SC)
is used to identify a server while a NAI identifies a user,
\- The Type subfield shall be set to value 2 (=TEK) in the KEMAC payload in
all MSK delivery messages.
\- The KV (Key validity period) subfield shall be set to value 2 (=Interval)
in the KEMAC payload in all MSK delivery messages.
\- The Key Validity Data subfield is present in the KEMAC payload when MSK is
transported. The field defines the validity time for MSK in terms of sequence
number interval (i.e. lower limit of MTK ID and upper limit of MTK ID). The
lower limit of the interval defines the original value of SEQl to be used by
the MGV-F (see clause 6.5) and the upper limit of the interval defines the
SEQu. The BM-SC shall never set SEQu to its maximum possible value.
\- The use of NULL algorithm in the MAC alg field is not allowed.
\- The use of NULL algorithm in the Encr alg field is not allowed.
The following applies only for streaming services:
\- Only one CryptoSession can be transported in the field CS ID map info for
streaming.
\- The #CS field shall be set to one, and CS ID map info shall be present in
the MSK message.
\- The CS ID map type subfield shall be set to "SRTP-ID" as defined in RFC
4563 [16].
\- The SP payload shall be used only with streaming services.
\- Security Policy (SP) payload shall include information for the security
protocol such as algorithms to use, key lengths, initial values for algorithms
etc.
\- The BM-SC shall ensure that the UE has received the SP payload before the
SP payload needs to be applied in the streaming service.
\- The BM-SC is not allowed to change the SP payload anymore once the
streaming service using that SP has started for the first time.
\- The BM-SC shall include the SP payload when the MSK delivery was triggered
by the UE using the MSK request procedure or the MBMS User Service
Registration procedure, otherwise it is optional for the BM-SC to include the
SP payload into MSK delivery messages.
\- An SRTP key derivation rate of zero shall be used. The BM-SC can achieve
this either by explicitly signalling a key derivation rate of zero via MIKEY
SRTP policy (RFC 3830 [9]) or by omitting this parameter in MIKEY SRTP policy
as the default key derivation rate of SRTP is zero.
The following applies only for download services:
\- The #CS field shall be set to zero, and no CS ID map info shall be present
in the MSK message.
\- The CS ID map type subfield shall be set to "Empty map" as defined in RFC
4563 [16].
\- The SP payload shall not be included in the MSK messages.
Figure 6.5: The logical structure of the MIKEY message used to deliver MSK.\
For use of brackets, cf. section 1.3 of RFC 3830 [9] (MIKEY)
#### 6.4.5.2 MSK Verification message structure
If the BM-SC expects a response to the MSK-transport message (i.e., the V-bit
in the MIKEY common header is equal to 1), the UE shall send a verification
message as a response. The verification message shall be constructed according
to section 3.1 of MIKEY, and shall consist of the following fields: HDR \|\|
TS \|\| IDr \|\| V, where IDr is the ID of the UE. The ID Type field of IDr
payload shall be set to value 0 (=NAI). The CS ID map type subfield shall be
set to "Empty map" as defined in RFC 4563 [16]. The #CS field shall be set to
zero, and no CS ID map info shall be present in the MSK verification message.
The use of the NULL algorithm in the MAC alg field is not allowed. Note that
the MAC included in the verification payload, shall be computed over both the
initiator\'s and the responder\'s ID as well as the timestamp in addition to
be computed over the response message as defined in RFC 3830 [9].
The UE shall use the same CSB ID in the verification messages as received in
the MSK delivery message.
Figure 6.6: The logical structure of the MIKEY Verification message
The verification message shall not be sent as a response to MIKEY messages
delivering MTK.
The ME shall send the verification message, when received as result from the
MGV-F, to the BM-SC.
#### 6.4.5.3 MTK message structure
Following requirements apply for both streaming and download services:
\- The structure of the MIKEY message carrying a MTK key shall be according to
Figure 6.7. (For handling of unknown MIKEY extension payloads in MGV-F, cf.
clause 6.5.4)
\- The actual MTK key that is delivered is kept in the KEMAC payload. Only one
MTK key can be transported in the KEMAC payload.
\- The EXT payload has format as described in clause 6.4.4.
\- The #CS field shall be set to zero, and no CS ID map info shall be present
in the MTK message.
\- The CS ID type map type subfield shall be set to "Empty map" as defined in
RFC 4563 [16].
\- Neither shall the SP payload be included in MTK messages.
\- The KV (Key validity period) subfield shall be set to NULL in the KEMAC
payload when MTK is transported.
\- The Key Validity Data subfield shall not be present in the KEMAC payload
when MTK is transported.
\- The use of NULL algorithm in the MAC alg field in the KEMAC payload is not
allowed.
\- The use of NULL algorithm in the Encr alg field in the KEMAC payload is not
allowed.
NOTE: MIKEY-RAND is not included in MTK messages since the MIKEY-RAND sent
within MSK delivery messages is used for MTK message processing, cf. clause
6.4.5.1 and 6.5.4.
Following requirement applies for streaming services only:
\- The Type subfield shall be set to value 3 (=TEK + salt) in the KEMAC
payload in all MTK delivery messages for streaming services.
\- A 112 bit salt shall be added to the KEMAC payload in addition to the MTK.
Following requirement applies for dowload services only:
\- The Type subfield shall be set to value 0 (=TGK) in the KEMAC payload in
all MTK delivery messages for download services.
\- No salt shall be added to the KEMAC payload.
Figure 6.7: The logical structure of the MIKEY message used to deliver MTK
### 6.4.6 Processing of received messages in the ME
#### 6.4.6.1 MSK MIKEY Message Reception
When the MIKEY message arrives at the ME, the processing proceeds following
the steps below (basically following section 5.3 of RFC 3830 [9]).
1\. The Extension Payload (EXT) is examined, and if it indicates an MSK
delivery protected with MUK, the MUK ID is received by combining IDi and IDr.
2\. The Timestamp Payload is checked, and the message is discarded if the
counter in the Timestamp Payload is smaller or equal to the stored replay
counter associated with the given MUK (the stored replay counter value is
retrieved from MGV-S).
3\. The Security Policy payload is stored temporarily in the ME if it was
present.
4\. The message is transported to MGV-F for further processing, cf. clause
6.5.3.
5\. The MGV-F replies success or failure. In case of success the temporarily
stored Security Policy payload is taken into use. Otherwise it is deleted.
6\. The ME shall check if the MIKEY message indicates a BM-SC solicited pull
procedure and behave as described in clause 6.3.2.2.4.
#### 6.4.6.2 MTK MIKEY Message Reception
When the MIKEY message arrives at the ME, the processing proceeds following
the steps below (basically following section 5.3 of RFC 3830 [9]).
1\. The Extension Payload (EXT) is examined, and if it indicates an MTK
delivery protected with MSK, the MSK ID is extracted from the Extension
Payload.
2\. The Timestamp Payload is checked, and the message is discarded if the
counter in the Timestamp Payload is smaller or equal to the stored replay
counter associated with the given MSK (the stored replay counter value is
retrieved from MGV-S).
3\. If the MTK ID extracted from the Extension payload is less than or equal
to the current MTK ID (kept in the ME), the message shall be discarded.
4\. The message is transported to MGV-F for further processing, cf. 6.5.4.
5\. The MGV-F replies success (i.e. sending the MTK and salt if available) or
failure.
## 6.5 Validation and key derivation functions in MGV-F
### 6.5.1 General
When an MSK or MTK message is received in the UE, it is processed in protected
environment MGV-S.
### 6.5.2 Usage of MUK
When a MUK has been installed in the MGV-S, i.e. as a result of a GBA run, it
is used as pre-shared secret used to verify the integrity of the MSK transport
message and decrypt the MSK carried in the KEMAC payload as described in RFC
3830 [9].
### 6.5.3 MSK processing
When the MGV-F receives the MIKEY message, the MGV-F first determines the type
of message by reading the EXT. If the EXT indicates MSK delivery (clause
6.4.4) then the text in this clause applies.
The MGV-F shall not abort processing of a MIKEY message when encountered with
an extension payload with unknown type. The content of an unknown extension
payload (except for the next payload, type and length fields) shall be treated
as an opaque object. The MAC computation required for the KEMAC payload shall
include any unknown extension payloads preceeding it.
NOTE: This is because an unknown extension payload may be specified for ME use
only and it is therefore \"unknown\" to the MGV-F. Skipping unknown payloads
during the payload parsing is a deviation from recommended receiver behavior
in section 5.3 of RFC 3830 [9].
The MGV-F retrieves the MUK identified as specified in clause 6.1. If the Key
Number part of the MSK ID in the EXT equals 0x0 then this indicates a
solicited pull procedure (clause 6.3.2.2.4) for which the MIKEY message does
not contain an MSK and for which the MUK shall be applied according to clause
6.3.2.2.4.
The integrity of the message is validated and if valid then the MSK, if
present, shall be extracted from the KEMAC payload as described in section 5
of RFC 3830 [9], and the Key Validity data, shall be extracted from the
message and stored (in the form of MTK ID interval).
If integrity validation is successful, then the MGV-F shall update the stored
Time Stamp value associated with the corresponding MUK ID in MGV-S with the
counter value in the Time Stamp payload.
If the MGV-F receives an MSK and already contains two other MSKs under the
same Key Domain ID and Key Group part, then the UE shall keep the newer and
delete the older of these two MSKs. The newer MSK (i.e. the MSK to be kept) of
the two stored MSKs under the same Key Domain ID and Key Group part is
determined by the UE from the combination of MUK ID and Time Stamp value in
the following way. The MSK that was protected with the newer MUK is the newer
MSK regardless of the value of the Time Stamp. In case the MUK IDs are equal,
the MSK with higher Time Stamp value is the newer MSK. Updating an existing
MSK (e.g. by updating the Key Validity Data) or resending an MSK means then
also that the updated MSK becomes the newer MSK since the Time Stamp value is
increased in these cases. In case the MUK ID values are not equal, the newer
MUK is the last MUK successfully used by the BM-SC as specified in clause
6.3.2.2.4.
If the MGV-F receives an MSK, which has the same MSK ID as a stored MSK, the
received MSK shall replace the stored MSK and update the Key Validity data. In
case the MSK message does not include any key in KEMAC payload, then the Key
Validity data shall be updated for the specified MSK except if the MSK ID is
0x0.
### 6.5.4 MTK processing
When the MGV-F receives the MIKEY message, it first determines the type of
message by reading the EXT. If the key inside the message is an MTK protected
by MSK, MGV-F retrieves the MSK with the ID given by the Extension payload.
The MGV-F shall not abort processing of a MIKEY message when encountered with
an extension payload with unknown type. The content of an unknown extension
payload (except for the next payload, type and length fields) shall be treated
as an opaque object. The MAC computation required for the KEMAC payload shall
include any unknown extension payloads preceeding it.
NOTE: This is because an unknown extension payload may be specified for ME use
only and it is therefore \"unknown\" to the MGV-F. Skipping unknown payloads
during the payload parsing is a deviation from recommended receiver behavior
in section 5.3 of RFC 3830.
It is assumed that the MBMS service specific data, MSK, MIKEY-RAND and the
sequence numbers SEQl and SEQu, have been stored within a secure storage
(MGV-S). MSK, MIKEY-RAND, SEQl and SEQu were transferred to the MGV-S with the
execution of the MSK update procedures. The initial values of SEQl and SEQu
are determined by the service provider.
The MGV-F shall only calculate and deliver the MBMS Traffic Keys (MTK) to the
ME if the ptm-key information is deemed to be fresh.
The MGV-F shall compare the received SEQp, i.e. MTK ID from the MIKEY message
with the stored SEQl and SEQu. If SEQp is equal to or lower than SEQl or SEQp
is greater than SEQu, then the MGV-F shall indicate a failure to the ME.
Otherwise, the MGV-F shall verify the integrity of the MIKEY message according
to RFC 3830 [9]. The random value to use as input to the PRF function (section
4.1.4 of RFC3830 [9]) is the MIKEY-RAND stored together with the MSK. If the
verification is unsuccessful, then the MGV-F will indicate a failure to the
ME. If the verification is successful, then the MGV-F shall update SEQl with
SEQp value and extract the MTK from the message. The MGV-F then provides the
MTK to the ME.
If MAC verification is successful, the MGV-F shall update in MGV-S the counter
value in the Time Stamp payload associated with the corresponding MSK ID.
NOTE 2: It is advised for the implementers of MGV-S (either on the UICC or ME
) to exercise caution when implementing memory management for the MTK
parameters (e.g. MTK ID field ) . E.g. on the UICC, t he file EF~MSK~
containing the MSK_IDs and related timestamps is marked as a high update
activity file , but that might not be sufficient to avoid potential wear-out
of the non-volatile memory, if the network uses a very short MTK lifetime
(e.g. 5 seconds). The approach chosen by implementers need s also to take into
account the fact that users may roam and use the service in other networks
than their home network. Those networks may have a different configuration.
The ME shall store the two most recent MTKs used per MBMS streaming or
download session. In particular, if the ME receives an MTK and already stores
two other MTKs for that MBMS streaming or download session, then the UE shall
keep the newer and delete the older of the two stored MTKs before storing the
received MTK. Any MTKs stored in association with a particular MBMS streaming
or download session should be deleted at the end of that session.
In the case of streaming, SRTP and SRTCP require a master key and a master
salt. The MTK is used as a common master key for both SRTP and SRTCP, and the
salt in the KEMAC payload is used as master salt.
In case of download service, key derivation as defined in section 4.1.3 of RFC
3820 [9] shall be used to derive authentication and encryption keys from MTK
in the ME using the constants for authentication and encryption keys defined
in table 4.1.3 of RFC 3830 [9]. As there shall be no CS field present for
download services as specified in clause 6.4.5.3, cs_id shall be set to
0x00000000 within the key derivation of section 4.1.3 of RFC 3830 [9]. The
derived authentication and encryption keys shall be provided to the download
protection protocol.
## 6.6 Protection of the transmitted traffic
### 6.6.1 General
The data transmitted to the UEs is protected by a symmetric key (an MTK) that
is shared by the BM-SC and UEs that are accessing the MBMS User Service. The
protection of the data is applied by the BM-SC Session and Transmission
Function. In order to determine which MTK was used to protect the data key
identification information is included with the protected data. The key
identification information will uniquely identify the MSK and MTK. The MTK is
processed according to the methods described in clauses 6.4 and 6.5. Whenever
data from an MBMS User Service has been decrypted, if it is to be stored on
the UE it will be stored decrypted.
NOTE: Including the key identification information with the protected data
stops the UE trying to decrypt and render content for which it does not have
the MSK.
### 6.6.2 Protection of streaming data
#### 6.6.2.1 Usage of SRTP
When it is required to protect MBMS streaming data SRTP (Secure Real-time
Transport Protocol) as defined in RFC 3711 [11] shall be used. The MTK is
carried to the UEs from the BM-SC using RFC 3830 [9] (MIKEY) with extensions
defined according to this specification. MTK shall be used as the master key
in SRTP key derivation to derive the SRTP session keys as defined in section
4.3 of RFC 3711 [11]. A key derivation rate as defined in clause 6.4.5 shall
be used.
The correct MTK to use to decrypt the data is indicated using the MKI (Master
Key identifier) field, which is included in the SRTP packets as defined in RFC
3711 [11]. The form of MKI shall be a concatenation of MSK ID and MTK ID, i.e.
MKI = (MSK ID \|\| MTK ID).
NOTE 1: The UE knows the Key Domain ID related to this MKI from the User
Service Description which includes mapping between IP address and port of the
traffic and the corresponding Key Domain ID and MSK ID.
The SRTP authentication tag shall be appended to the packets as defined in RFC
4771 [22].
NOTE 2: In RFC 4771 [22] it is specified that the ROC is transferred in every
Rth SRTP packet. The specification furthermore defines how the constant R and
the integrity transform is negotiated using MIKEY.
The parameter, constant R, shall be included in the MSK delivery messages.
NOTE 3: In RFC 4771 [22] it is specified that if the constant R is not
signalled then the default value 1 is to be used. However explicit signalling
of R is here required in each MSK delivery message in order to require the
operator of choosing the most optimal value for the SRTP stream. The default
value of R=1 causes to add a ROC to each SRTP packet implying that a MAC of 10
octets (proposed by RFC 4771 [22]) and a ROC of 4 octets will be added to each
SRTP packet in both mode RCCm1 and RCCm2. Also a ROC of 4 octets will be added
to each SRTP packet in mode RCCm3 (but no MAC).
SRTP security policy parameters, such as encryption algorithm, are transported
in MIKEY Security Policy payload as defined in section 6.10.1 in RFC 3830 [9].
FEC shall be applied beneath the SRTP layer as described within TS 26.346 [13]
NOTE 4: This deviates from the default FEC order as described within RFC3711
[11] clause 10. The reversed order is not signalled within the service
protection description of the MBMS User Service Announcement.
#### 6.6.2.1A Usage of SRTCP
Secure RTCP (SRTCP) provides the same security services to RTCP as SRTP does
to RTP. As defined in TS 26.346 [13] only RTCP sender reports are allowed in
MBMS.
As defined in RFC 3711[11] SRTCP shall be applied to RTCP control packets when
SRTP is applied to RTP with the following profiling:
\- Encryption of SRTCP packets is optional;
\- SRTCP packets shall be integrity protected as defined in RFC 3711 [11];
\- SRTCP shall share master key and master salt with the corresponding SRTP
stream;
\- SRTCP packets shall carry the same MKI field value as the corresponding
SRTP stream;
NOTE 1: This is a consequence of sharing the same master key.
\- SRTCP shall use the same encryption algorithm as corresponding SRTP session
NOTE 2: SRTCP does not need additional mechanisms, e.g. RFC 4771 [22], to
synchronize the ROC as SRTCP header explicitly carries the SRTCP packet index.
#### 6.6.2.2 Packet processing in the UE
When the SRTP module receives a packet, it will retrieve the correct
cryptographic context identified by destination transport address, destination
port and SSRC (according to RFC 3711 [11] and RFC 4771 [22]), check if it has
the MTK corresponding to the value in the MKI field in the SRTP cryptographic
context.
NOTE 1: The cryptographic context needs to be unique for each SRTP stream.
NOTE 2: The SRTP module does not need to interpret the MKI field semantics. It
only checks whether it has the MTK corresponding to the MKI value.
If the check is successful, the SRTP module processes the packet according to
the security policy.
If the SRTP module does not have the MTK, it will request the MTK
corresponding to the MKI from the key management module. When the key
management module returns a new MTK, the SRTP module will derive new session
keys from the MTK and process the packet. However, if the key management
module does not have the MSK indicated by MKI, then it should fetch the MSK
using the methods discussed in the clause 6.3.
If the correct MTK is not present in the UE when RTP traffic arrives, the UE
shall wait for the next MTK update procedure from the BM-SC as described in
clause 6.3.3.2.
NOTE 3: It is implementation specific issue whether the UE spools encrypted
packets or discards all packets before the UE has received the correct MTK.
The below flow shows how the protected content is delivered to the UE.
{width="5.341666666666667in" height="0.65625in"}
Figure 6.8: Delivery of protected streaming content to the UE
### 6.6.3 Protection of download data
#### 6.6.3.1 General
Data that belongs to a download MBMS User Service is decrypted as soon as
possible by the UE, if the MSK needed to provide the relevant MTK is already
available on the UE.
#### 6.6.3.2 Usage of OMA DRM DCF
NOTE: If the OMA DRM V2.0 DCF [15] specification is upgraded, these upgrades
do not apply for the present document.
When it is required to protect MBMS download data, OMA DRM V2.0 DCF as defined
in OMA DRM V2.0 DCF [15] shall be used. MBMS download data are therefore
indicated by minor version 0x00000002 in a DCF. OMA DRM Rights Objects are not
utilized. Instead, encryption and authentication keys are generated from MTK.
For integrity protection, an OMADRMSignature as specified below is attached
inside the optional Mutable DRM information box (\'mdri\') of the DCF.
The OMADRMSignature Box is an extension to OMA DRM V2.0 DCF for use by MBMS,
and is defined as follows:
aligned(8) class OMADRMSignature extends Fullbox('odfs', version, flags) {
Unsigned int(8) SignatureMethod; // Signature Method
Char Signature[]; // Actual Signature
}
SignatureMethod Field:
NULL 0x00
HMAC-SHA1 0x01
The range of data for the HMAC calculation shall be according to section 5.3
of OMA DRM V2.0 DCF [15].
The correct MTK for decrypting and verifying the integrity of the download
data is indicated by the KeyID in the OMABCASTKeyInfoBox \'obki\' included in
the ExtendedHeadersfield in the OMADRMCommonHeaders box (cf. OMA DRM XBS
[24]). The use of the \'obki\' box by MBMS is as follows:
\- KeyIssuerPresent set to 1 if KeyIssuerURL is provided (the DCF
RightsIssuerURL field is not used)
\- STKMPresent set to 0 (no STKM stored in file)
\- TBKPresent set to 0 (no TerminalBindingKey used)
\- TBKIssuerURLPresent set to 0 (no TBKIssuerURL present)
\- KeyIDType set to 0x02 (reserved by OMA BCAST for 3GPP MBMS, identifies the
KeyID for MBMS usage.
KeyID is the base64 encoded concatenation (Key Domain ID \|\| MSK ID \|\| MTK
ID).
If the MBMS download data requires protection, see 6.3.2.1A, then the FDT of
the FLUTE protocol shall be integrity protectedby wrapping the FDT in a DCF of
its own. The correct MTK for verifying the integrity of the FDT shall be
indicated by theKeyID in the OMABCASTKeyInfoBox \'obki\' included in the
ExtendedHeaders field in the OMADRMCommonHeaders box.
The MBMS DCF implementation shall support the following boxes specified in OMA
DRM V2.0 DCF [15]:
\- Fixed DCF header;
\- Mutable DRM information Box;
\- OMA DRM Container Box.
## 6.7 Confidentiality protection of associated delivery procedures
### 6.7.1 General
The MBMS associated delivery procedures specified in clause 9 of TS 26.346
[13] require the UE to use HTTP protocol to transmit data associated with the
MBMS user service for reception reporting and file repair purposes to a HTTP
server in the network (i.e., the Reception Report server and File Repair
server as defined in TS 26.346 [13]). The information transmitted by the UE
using associated delivery procedures may be user privacy (e.g., MBMS service
the user is listening to, location) and network privacy (e.g., network
topology information) sensitive. Therefore, support for confidentiality
protection in HTTP is required.
In order to protect the confidentiality of the privacy sensitive data
transmitted by the UE using associated delivery procedures, the UE shall
support using HTTP over TLS as specified in RFC 2818 [32]. TLS shall be used
with server certificates, but the HTTP server shall not request client
certificates.
The support of HTTP over TLS (i.e., HTTPS) for associated delivery procedures
is optional in the network. If supported by the network, its use for an
associated delivery procedure (i.e., Reception Reporting or File Repair) is
determined by the UE either based on the UE preconfiguration (e.g., based on
explicit configuration or on the presence of preconfigured list of trusted
root certificates in the UE for the validation of HTTP servers used for
associated delivery procedures [or based on the reception over an integrity
protected channel of an indication to the UE to use HTTP or HTTPS (e.g., User
Service Description and/or FLUTE File Delivery Table contains this indication
and is delivered individually as, or part of, an integrity protected MBMS
Download Service). If the integrity of this indication to use HTTP or HTTPS
can be verified by the UE, then this indication shall take precedence over the
UE preconfiguration. If the integrity of this indication cannot be verified by
the UE, then the UE preconfiguration shall take precedence]{.underline}). The
procedures topre configure this information on the UE are outside the scope of
the present specification.
### 6.7.2 TLS Profile
The UE shall support TLS according to the TLS profile given in TS 33.310 [31],
Annex E.
The certificates shall comply with the requirements for TLS certificates in
clause 6.1 of TS 33.310 [31].
When the UE decides to use TLS, the use of TLS ciphersuite without NULL
encryption is mandatory.
NOTE 1: Without the use of TLS encryption, the use of TLS is not needed as
authentication and integrity protection for HTTP procedures is provided using
HTTP Digest, cf. clause 6.2.
Support of certificate revocation and of the related fields in certificates is
optional. If supported, the certificate and CRL profiles in clauses 6.1 and
6.1a of TS 33.310 [31] should be followed.
NOTE 2: The management of Root Certificates is out of scope of the present
document.
### 6.7.3 HTTP server authentication
The UE shall authenticate the HTTP server by use of a server certificate. The
UE shall match the server name as specified in RFC 2818 [32], section 3.1.
The UE shall use a preconfigured list of trusted root certificates for TLS
server certificate validation. It is recommended that a separate preconfigured
list of trusted root certificates is used with associated delivery procedures.
The server certificate validation shall not require manual user interaction.
### 6.7.4 Authentication of the UE
The HTTP server shall not request a certificate in a Server Hello Message from
the UE. The HTTP server relies on the HTTP Digest for UE authentication as
specified in clause 6.2.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Trust model
The following trust relationship between the roles that are participating in
MBMS services are proposed:
\- the user trusts the home network operator to provide the MBMS service
according to the service level agreement;
\- the user trusts the network operator after mutual authentication;
\- the network trusts an authenticated user using integrity protection and
encryption at RAN level;
\- the network may have trust or no trust in a content provider.
_The home network and visited network trust each other when a roaming
agreement is defined, in the case the user is roaming in a VPLMN._
###### ## Annex B (informative): Security threats
# B.1 Threats associated with attacks on the radio interface
The threats associated with attacks on the radio interface are split into the
following categories, which are described in the following clauses:
\- unauthorized access to MBMS User Service data;
\- threats to integrity;
\- denial of service;
\- unauthorized access to MBMS User Services;
\- privacy violation.
The attacks on the MBMS service announcements to the users on the radio
interface are not discussed here because in case these are transferred on a
point-to-point connection (e.g. PS signalling connection), they are already
secured. In case the service announcement is transferred over HTTP, it is
protected by HTTP Digest as defined in the current specification and/or it may
be integrity protected and optionally encrypted at the RAN level. In case the
service announcements are sent over MBMS bearer, it is impractical to protect
them.
## B.1.1 Unauthorised access to MBMS User Service data
**A1** : Intruders may eavesdrop MBMS User Service data on the air-interface.
**A2** : Users that have not joined and activated a MBMS User Service
receiving that service without being charged.
**A3** : Users that have joined and then left a MBMS User Service continuing
to receive the MBMS User Service without being charged.
**A4** : Valid subscribers may derive decryption keys (MTK) and distribute
them to unauthorized parties.
NOTE: It is assumed that the legitimate end user has a motivation to defeat
the system and distribute the shared keys (MSK, MTK) that are a necessary
feature of any broadcast security scheme.
## B.1.2 Threats to integrity
**B1** : Modifications and replay of messages in a way to fool the user of the
content from the actual source, e.g. replace the actual content with a fake
one.
## B.1.3 Denial of service attacks
**C1** : Jamming of radio resources. Deliberate manipulation of the data to
disturb the communication.
## B.1.4 Unauthorised access to MBMS User Services
**D1** : An attacker using the 3GPP network to gain \"free access\" of MBMS
User Services and other services on another user\'s bill.
**D2** : An attacker using MBMS shared keys (MSK, MTK) to gain free access to
content without any knowledge of the service provider.
NOTE: It cannot be assumed that keys held in a terminal are secure. No matter
how the shared keys (MSK, MTK) are delivered to the terminal, we have to
assume they can be derived in an attack. For example, the shared keys, while
secure in the UICC, may be passed over an insecure UICC-ME interface.
## B.1.5 Privacy violation
**E1** : The user identity could be exposed to the content provider, in the
case the content provider is located in the 3GPP network, and then linked to
the content.
# B.2 Threats associated with attacks on other parts of the system
The threats associated with attacks on other parts of the system are split
into the following categories, which are described in the following clauses:
\- unauthorized access to data;
\- threats to integrity;
\- denial of service;
\- a malicious UE generating MTKs for malicious use later on;
\- unauthorized insertion of MBMS user data and key management data.
## B.2.1 Unauthorised access to data
**F1** : It is assumed that the BM-SC and the GGSN are located in the same
network. The BM-SC can though be located in a different place than the GGSN,
and therefore can open up for intruders who may eavesdrop the interface Gi and
Gmb between the BM-SC and GGSN.
**F2** : Intruders may eavesdrop the interface between the content provider
and the BM-SC.
## B.2.2 Threats to integrity
**G1** : It is assumed that the BM-SC and the GGSN are located in the same
network. The BM-SC can though be located in a different place than the GGSN,
and therefore can open up for new attacks on the interfaces Gi and Gmb between
the BM-SC and GGSN.
**G2:** The interface between the content provider and the BM-SC may open up
for attacks as modifications of multimedia content.
## B.2.3 Denial of service
**H1** : Deliberated manipulation of the data between the BM-SC \ Content
Provider to disturb the communication.
**H2** : Deliberated manipulation of the data between the BM-SC \ GGSN to
disturb the communication.
## B.2.4 A malicious UE generating MTKs for malicious use later on
**I1** : A malicious ME querying the MTK generation function for MTK\'s to use
them later on in an attack (e.g. in order to use the retrieved MTKs within an
unauthorized data insertion attacks (See B.2.5)).
## B.2.5 Unauthorised insertion of MBMS user data and key management data
**J1** : An ME, which deliberately inserts key management and malicious data,
encrypted with valid (previously retrieved) MTK from the MTK generation
function, within the MBMS User Service stream.
**J2** : An ME, which deliberately inserts key management and malicious data,
encrypted with old (using replayed key management messages) MTK, within the
MBMS User Service stream.
**J3** : An attacker, which deliberately inserts incorrect key management
information within the MBMS User Service stream to cause Denial of Service
attacks.
###### ## Annex C (normative): MBMS security requirements
# C.1 Requirements on security service access
## C.1.1 Requirements on secure service access
R1a: A valid USIM or SIM shall be required to access MBMS User Services.
R1b: It shall be possible to prevent intruders from obtaining unauthorized
access of MBMS User Services by masquerading as authorized users.
## C.1.2 Requirements on secure service provision
R2a: It shall be possible for the network (i.e. BM-SC) to authenticate users
at the start of, and during, service delivery to prevent intruders from
obtaining unauthorized access to MBMS User Services.
R2b: It shall be possible to prevent the use of a particular USIM or SIM to
access MBMS User Services.
NOTE: No security requirements shall be placed on the UE that requires UE to
be customised to a particular customer prior to the point of sale.
# C.2 Requirements on MBMS Transport Service signalling protection
R3a: It shall be possible to protect against unauthorized modification,
insertion, replay or deletion of MBMS transport service signalling on the Gmb
reference point.
NOTE 1: This requirement may be fulfilled by physical or proprietary security
measures if the Gmb protocol endpoints (i.e. GGSN, Gmb-Proxy and BM-SC) are
located within the same security domain of the operator's network. Otherwise
the security mechanisms as specified within TS 33.210 [14] shall be applied.
R3b: Unauthorized modification, insertion, replay or deletion of all MBMS
Transport Service signalling, on the RAN shall be prevented when the RAN
selects a point-to-multipoint (ptm) link for the distribution of MBMS data to
the UE.
NOTE 2: UTRAN/E-UTRAN bearer signalling integrity protection will not be
provided for point to multipoint MBMS signalling and GERAN has no bearer
signalling integrity protection, even for point to point signalling.
# C.3 Requirements on Privacy
R4a: The User identity should not be exposed to the content provider or linked
to the content in the case the Content Provider is located outside the 3GPP
operator\'s network.
R4b: MBMS identity and control information shall not be exposed when the RAN
selects a point-to-multipoint link for the distribution of MBMS data to the
UE.
NOTE: UTRAN, E-UTRAN and GERAN bearer confidentiality protection will be not
be provided for point to multipoint MBMS sessions.
# C.4 Requirements on MBMS Key Management
R5a: The transfer of the MBMS keys between the MBMS key generator and the UE
shall be confidentiality protected.
R5b: The transfer of the MBMS keys between the MBMS key generator and the UE
shall be integrity protected.
R5c: The UE and MBMS key generator shall support the operator to perform re-
keying as frequently as it believes necessary to ensure that:
\- users that have joined an MBMS User Service, but then left, shall not gain
further access to the MBMS User Service without being charged appropriately
\- users joining an MBMS User Service shall not gain access to data from
previous transmissions in the MBMS User Service without having been charged
appropriately
\- the effect of subscribed users distributing decryption keys to non-
subscribed users shall be controllable.
R5d: Only authorized users that have joined an MBMS User Service shall be able
to receive MBMS keys delivered from the MBMS key generator.
R5e: The MBMS keys shall not allow the BM-SC to infer any information about
used UE-keys at radio level (i.e. if they would be derived from it).
R5f: All keys used for the MBMS User Service shall be uniquely identifiable.
The identity may be used by the UE to retrieve the actual key (based on
identity match, and mismatch recognition) when an update was missed or was
erroneous/incomplete.
R5g: The BM-SC shall be aware of where all MBMS specific keys are stored in
the UE (i.e. ME or UICC).
R5h: The function of providing MTK to the ME shall only deliver a MTK to the
ME if the input values used for obtaining the MTK were fresh (have not been
replayed) and came from a trusted source.
# C.5 Requirements on integrity protection of MBMS User Service data
R6a: It shall be possible to protect against unauthorized modification,
insertion, replay or deletion of MBMS User Service data sent to the UE on the
radio interface. The use of integrity shall be optional.
NOTE 1: It may be possible to detect the deletion of MBMS data packets, but it
is impossible to prevent the deletion. Packets may be lost because of bad
radio conditions, providing integrity protection will not help to detect or
recover from this situation.
NOTE 2: The use of shared keys (integrity and confidentiality) to a group of
untrusted users only prevents attacks of lower levels of sophistication, such
as preventing eavesdroppers from simply listening in
R6b: The MBMS User Service data may be integrity protected with a common
integrity key, which shall be available to all users that have joined the MBMS
User Service.
R6c: It may be required to integrity protect the \"BM-SC - GGSN\" interface
i.e. reference point Gi.
# C.6 Requirements on confidentiality protection of MBMS User Service data
R7a: It shall be possible to protect the confidentiality of MBMS User Service
data on the radio interface.
R7b: The MBMS User Service data may be encrypted with common encryption keys,
which shall be available to all users that have joined the MBMS User Service.
R7c: It may be required to encrypt the MBMS User Service data on the \"BM-SC -
GGSN\" interface, i.e. the reference points Gi.
R7d: It shall be infeasible for a man-in-the-middle to bid down the
confidentiality protection used on protect the MBMS User Service from the BM-
SC to the UE.
R7e: It shall be infeasible for an eavesdropper to break the confidentiality
protection of the MBMS User Service when it is applied.
# C.7 Requirements on content provider to BM-SC reference point
R8a: The BM-SC shall be able to authenticate and authorize a 3^rd^ party
content provider that wishes to transmit data to the BM-SC.
R8b: It shall be possible to integrity and confidentiality protect data sent
from a 3^rd^ party content provider to the BM-SC.
NOTE: This reference point will not be standardised.
###### ## Annex D (normative): UICC-ME interface
# D.1 MSK Update Procedure
This procedure is part of the MSK update procedure as described in clause 6.5
(Validation and key derivation functions in MGV-F). For details, see TS 31.102
[7].
The ME has previously performed a GBA_U bootstrapping procedure and a
subsequent GBA_U NAF Derivation procedure as described in TS 33.220 [6]. The
UICC stores the corresponding Ks_int_NAF and associated B-TID together with
the NAF_Id without the Ua security protocol identifier, associated with this
particular bootstrapping procedure.
The ME receives a MIKEY message containing an MSK update. After performing
some validity checks, the ME sends the whole message to the UICC. The UICC
uses the MUK ID (included in the MIKEY message, see clause 6.1) to identify
the stored Ks_int_NAF.
The UICC then uses Ks_int_NAF as the MUK value for MUK derivation and MSK
validation and derivation (as described in clause 6.5.3).
After successful MSK Update procedure the UICC stores the Key Domain ID, MSK
ID, MSK and MSK Validity Time (in the form of MTK ID interval).
Figure D.1: MSK Update Procedure
In case the MSK update MIKEY message is acceptable (i.e. the received MSK ID
corresponds to the last generated MUK in the UE, and the MSK Update procedure
has been performed successfully) and the V-bit was set in the HDR, then a MSK
Verification Message as described in clause 6.4.5.2 (MSK Verification message)
shall be produced. The UICC uses the same MUK ID and TS, which were received
from the MSK MIKEY Message (see clause 6.1), for the MSK Verification Message
Generation.
# D.2 Void
# D.3 MTK generation and validation
This procedure is part of the MTK generation and validation function as
described in clause 6.5.4 (MTK processing). For details, see TS 31.102 [7].
The ME receives the MIKEY message (containing Header, Time stamp, Key Domain
ID, MSK ID, MTK ID = SEQp, an encrypted MTK\|\|Salt (if salt is available) and
MAC). After performing some validity checks, the ME sends the whole message to
the UICC. The UICC computes the MGV-F function as described in clause 6.5.
(Validation and key derivation functions in MGV-F). After successful MGV-F
procedure the UICC returns the MTK.
Figure D.3: MTK Generation and Validation
# D.4 MSK deletion procedure
This procedure enables the ME to control the deletion of MSKs stored on the
UICC as described in clause 6.3.2.1A. For details, see TS 31.102 [7].
The ME sends to the UICC the Key Domain ID and Key Group part of the MSK ID to
delete. The UICC deletes all corresponding MSKs.
Figure D.4: MSK Deletion
# D.5 MUK deletion procedure
This procedure enables the ME to control the deletion of MUKs stored on the
UICC. For details, see TS 31.102 [7].
The ME sends the MUK ID to the UICC to delete. The UICC deletes the targeted
MUK , the corresponding GBA NAF Key (Ks_int_NAF associated to the same NAF_ID)
shall be deleted; the bootstrapped key Ks shall also be deleted if Ks is
present and associated to the same B-TID.
.
Figure D.5: MUK Deletion
###### ## Annex E (Informative): MIKEY features not used in MBMS
\- An MBMS capable ME/UICC and BM-SC do not need to implement the public key
encryption method of MIKEY (section 3.2 of RFC 3830 [9]) and related payloads,
although mentioned in RFC 3830 [9] as mandatory for implementation.
\- An MBMS capable ME/UICC and BM-SC do not need to implement the Time Stamp
payload types NTP-UTC and NTP of MIKEY (section 6.6 of RFC 3830 [9]) although
mentioned in RFC 3830 [9] as mandatory for implementation.
\- An MBMS capable ME/UICC and BM-SC do not need to implement the AES Key Wrap
algorithm of MIKEY (section 4.2.3 and 6.2 of RFC 3830 [9]).
###### ## Annex F (normative): MRK key derivation for ME based MBMS key
management
The MRK shall be derived from the key Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF using the GBA key
derivation function (see Annex B of TS 33.220 [6]) as follows (see notation
style is explained in Annex B of TS 33.220 [6]):
\- FC = 0x01,
\- P0 = \"mbms-mrk\" (i.e. 0x6d 0x62 0x6d 0x73 0x2d 0x6d 0x72 0x6b), and
\- L0 = length of P0 is 8 octets (i.e. 0x00 0x08).
The Key to be used in key derivation shall be:
\- Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF (i.e. NAF specific key) as specified in TS 33.220 [6].
In summary, the MRK shall be derived from the Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF, and static
string \"mbms-mrk\" as follows:
\- MRK = KDF (Ks_NAF, \"mbms-mrk\") in case of GBA_ME run;
\- MRK = KDF (Ks_ext_NAF, \"mbms-mrk\") in case of GBA_U run.
###### ## Annex G (normative): HTTP based key management messages
# G.1 Introduction
Clause 6 specifies the HTTP based key management procedures between the BM-SC
and the UE. It specifies that the authentication of these procedures is based
on GBA and more specifically on the HTTP Digest authentication as described in
clause 6.2 of the present document.
# G.2 Key management procedures
This clause contains the following HTTP based procedures:
\- MBMS User Service Registration;
\- MBMS User Service Deregistration;
\- MSK request.
## G.2.1 MBMS User Service Registration
The UE shall generate a request for MBMS User Service Registration according
to clause 6.3.2.1A. The UE shall send the Registration request for one or more
MBMS User Services to the BM-SC in the HTTP payload in a HTTP POST request.
The Request-URI shall indicate the type of the message, i.e. Registration
request. Upon successful request, BM-SC shall return indication of success.
The UE populates the HTTP POST request as follows:
\- the HTTP version shall be 1.1 which is specified in RFC 2616 [19];
\- the base of the Request-URI shall contain the full BM-SC key management URI
(e.g. http://bmsc.home1.net:1234);
\- the Request-URI shall contain an URI parameter \"requesttype\" that shall
be set to \"register\", i.e. Request-URI takes the form of
\"/keymanagement?requesttype= register\";
\- the UE may add additional URI parameters to the Request-URI;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be the MIME type of the payload, i.e.
\"application/mbms-register+xml\". The XML schema of the payload is specified
in TS 26.346 [13];
\- the HTTP payload shall contain request including a list of one or more
userServiceIds of MBMS User Services to which the UE wants to register;
\- the UE may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP POST request.

HTTP response is valid.
An example flow of a successful MSK request procedure can be found in Annex H.
## G.2.4 Error situations
The key management procedures may not be successful for multiple reasons. The
error cases are indicated by using 4xx and 5xx HTTP Status Codes as defined in
RFC 2616 [19]. The 4xx status code indicates that the UE seems to have erred,
and the 5xx status code indicates that the BM-SC is aware that it has erred.
Possible error situations during key management and their mappings to HTTP
Status Codes are described in table G.2.4â€‘1. The handling of multiple status
codes within one response message is specified in clause 6.3.2.4.
NOTE: In table G.2.4â€‘1, the \"Description\" column describes the error
situation in BM-SC. The \"BM-SC error\" column describes the typical reason
for the error.

###### ## Annex H (informative): Signalling flows for MSK procedures
# H.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for the key management
procedures.
# H.2 Signalling flows demonstrating a successful MSK request procedure
## H.2.1 Successful MSK request procedure
The signalling flow in figure H.2.1â€‘1 describes the message exchange between
UE and BM-SC when UE wants to request MSK.
Figure H.2.1â€‘1: Successful MSK request procedure.
1\. **Initial MSK request (UE to BM-SC)** \- see example in table H.2.1â€‘1
The UE sends an HTTP request to the BM-SC containing a MSK request.
Table H.2.1â€‘1: MSK request (UE to BM-SC)
+------------------------------------------------------+ | POST /keymanagement?requesttype=msk-request HTTP/1.1 | | | | Host: bmsc.home1.net:1234 | | | | Content-Type: application/mbms-msk+xml | | | | Content-Length: (...) | | | | User-Agent: MBMSAgent; Release-6 3gpp-gba | | | | Date: Thu, 08 Jan 2004 10:50:35 GMT | | | | Accept: */* | | | | Referrer: http://bmsc.home1.net:1234/service | | | | \ | +------------------------------------------------------+
**Request-URI:** The Request-URI (the URI that follows the method name,
\"POST\", in the first line) indicates the resource of this POST request. The
Request-URI contains the parameter \"requesttype\" which is set to \"msk-
request\" to indicate to the BM-SC the desired request type, i.e. UE requests
for one or several MSKs.
**Host:** Specifies the Internet host and port number of the BM-SC, obtained
from the original URI given by referring resource.
**Content-Type:** Contains the media type \"application/mbms-msk+xml\", i.e.
MSK request.
**Content-Length:** Indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number
of OCTETs, sent to the recipient.
**User-Agent:** Contains information about the user agent originating the
request and it shall include the static string \"3gpp-gba\" to indicate to the
application server (i.e. NAF) that the UE supports 3GPP-bootstrapping based
authentication.
**Date:** Represents the date and time at which the message was originated.
**Accept:** Media types which are acceptable for the response.
**Referrer:** Allows the user agent to specify the address (URI) of the
resource from which the URI for the BM-SC was obtained.
NOTE 1: This step is used to trigger the GBA-based authentication between the
UE and the BM-SC.
2\. **401 Unauthorized response (BM-SC to UE)** \- see example in table
H.2.1â€‘2
Upon receiving an HTTP request that contains static string \"3gpp-gba\" in the
User-Agent header the BM-SC responds with HTTP response code 401
\"Unauthorized\" which contains a WWW Authenticate header. The header
instructs the UE to use HTTP Digest Authentication with a bootstrapped
security association.
Table H.2.1â€‘2: 401 Unauthorized response (BM-SC to UE)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized | | | | Server: Apache/1.3.22 (Unix) mod_perl/1.27 | | | | Date: Thu, 08 Jan 2004 10:50:35 GMT | | | | WWW-Authenticate: Digest | | realm=\"3GPP-bootstrapping\@bmsc.home1.net\", | | nonce=\"6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1\", algorithm=MD5, | | qop=\"auth,auth-int\", opaque=\"5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f30e41\" | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
**Server:** Contains information about the software used by the origin server
(BM-SC).
**Date:** Represents the date and time at which the message was originated.
**WWW-Authenticate:** The BM-SC challenges the user. The header instructs the
UE to use HTTP Digest Authentication with a bootstrapped security association.
The options for the quality of protection (qop) attribute is by default
\"auth-int\" meaning that the payload of the following HTTP requests and
responses should be integrity protected.
The realm attribute contains two parts delimited by \"@\" sign. The first part
is a constant string \"3GPP-bootstrapping\" instructing the UE to use a
bootstrapped security association. The second part is the hostname of the
server (i.e. FQDN of the BM-SC).
3\. **Generation of NAF specific keys at UE**
The UE verifies that the second part of the realm attribute does correspond to
the server it is talking to.
UE derives the NAF specific key material as specified in TS 33.220 [6]. UE
further derives MBMS specific key material MRK and MUK as specified in clause
6.1.
NOTE 2: If UE does not have a bootstrapped security association available, it
will obtain one by running bootstrapping procedure over Ub interface.
4\. **Authenticated MSK request (UE to BM-SC)** \- see example in table
H.2.1â€‘3
UE generates the HTTP request by calculating the Authorization header values
using the bootstrapping transaction identifier B-TID it received from the BSF
as the username and the MRK (base64 encoded) as the password, and sends the
request to BM-SC.
Table H.2.1â€‘3: Authenticated MSK request (UE to BM-SC)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | POST /keymanagement?requesttype=msk-request HTTP/1.1 | | | | Host: bmsc.home1.net:1234 | | | | Content-Type: application/mbms-msk+xml | | | | Content-Length: (...) | | | | User-Agent: MBMSAgent; Release-6 3gpp-gba | | | | Date: Thu, 08 Jan 2004 10:50:35 GMT | | | | Accept: */* | | | | Referer: http://bmsc.home1.net:1234/service | | | | Authorization: Digest username=\"(B-TID)\", | | realm=\"3GPP-bootstrapping\@bmsc.home1.net\", | | nonce=\"a6332ffd2d234==\", | | uri=\"/bmsc.home1.net/keymanagement?requesttype=msk-request\", | | qop=auth-int, nc=00000001, | | cnonce=\"6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1\", | | response=\"6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1\", | | opaque=\"5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f30e41\", algorithm=MD5 | | | | \ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
**Authorization:** This carries the response to the authentication challenge
received in step 2 along with the username, the realm, the nonce, the URI, the
qop, the NC, the cnonce, the response, the opaque, and the algorithm.
The qop attribute is set to \"auth-int\" by default.
NOTE 3: If step 1 was a POST request then this request would also be a POST
request and contain the same client payload in the HTTP request as was carried
in step 1.
5\. **Zn: NAF specific key procedure**
BM-SC retrieves the NAF specific key material and IMPI of the user. BM-SC
further derives MBMS specific key material MRK and MUK as specified in clause
6.1.
For detailed signalling flows see TS 29.109 [20].
Table H.2.1â€‘4: Bootstrapping authentication information procedure (BM-SC to
BSF)
* * *
Message source and destination Zn Information element name Information Source
in GET Description NAF to BSF B-TID Authorization The bootstrapping
transaction identifier is encoded in the username field according to the
Authorization protocol.
* * *
6\. **Authentication at BM-SC**
BM-SC verifies the Authorization header by using the bootstrapping transaction
identifier B-TID and the key MRK. BM-SC calculates the corresponding digest
values using MRK, and compares the calculated values with the received values
in the Authorization header.
The BM-SC also verifies that the hostname (i.e. its FQDN) in the realm
attribute matches its own.
If the verification succeeds, the incoming client-payload request is taken in
for further processing. The BM-SC continues processing of the MSK request
according to its internal policies. The BM-SC verifies that the subscriber is
allowed to receive the particular MSK(s) indicated in the MSK request.
7\. **Response indicating success (BM-SC to UE)** \- see example in table
H.2.1â€‘5
The BM-SC sends 200 OK response to the UE to indicate the success of the
authentication and the MSK request. The BM-SC generates a HTTP response. The
BM-SC can use key MRK derived from NAF key material to integrity protect and
authenticate the response.
NOTE 5: The requested MSK keys are not delivered within the MSK request
procedure. They are delivered with a separate MIKEY procedure, see clause
6.3.2.3.
Table H.2.1â€‘5: Successful HTTP response (BM-SC to UE)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | HTTP/1.1 200 OK | | | | Server: Apache/1.3.22 (Unix) mod_perl/1.27 | | | | Content-Type: application/mbms-msk+xml | | | | Content-Length: (...) | | | | Authentication-Info: qop=auth-int, | | rspauth=\"6629fae49394a05397450978507c4ef1\", | | cnonce=\"6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1\", nc=00000001 | | | | Date: Thu, 08 Jan 2004 10:50:35 GMT | | | | Expires: Fri, 09 Jan 2004 10:50:36 GMT | | | | \ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
**Authentication-Info:** This carries the protection.
**Expires:** Gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale.
8\. **Authentication at UE**
The UE receives the response and verifies the Authentication-Info header. If
the verification succeeds, the UE can regard the MSK request procedure as
successful.
###### ## Annex I (informative): Example of using MSKs and MTKs in MBMS
The following table shows an example of two MBMS User Services, sports Mobile
TV channel and news Mobile TV channel. Both of the MBMS User Services include
an MBMS User Service Session that downloads a joke per day. The table shows
how the MBMS User Services are broken down into RTP sessions (each including
the data stream with related RTCP) and FLUTE channels.
The table shows how MSKs and MTKs belonging to different Key Groups are used
to protect the RTP sessions and FLUTE channels. It should be noted that the
MBMS download session is shared with User Services 1 and 2 so these MBMS User
Services need to be able to share MSKs in Key Group C.
Furthermore the table shows how traffic could be carried over MBMS bearers,
but this is not a security issue and is only shown here for completeness.

###### ## Annex J (informative): Mapping the MBMS security requirements into
security functions and mechanism
## J.1 Consistency check
### J.1.1 Requirements on secure service access
* * *
**Security requirement** **Check result** R1a: A valid USIM or SIM shall be
required to access MBMS User Services. This is provided by GBA.
Ks_(ext/int)_NAF generation requires a valid USIM or SIM. R1b: It shall be
possible to prevent intruders from obtaining unauthorized access of MBMS User
Services by masquerading as authorized users. GBA and HTTP digest
authentication provide this. R2a: It shall be possible for the network (i.e.
BM-SC) to authenticate users at the start of, and during, service delivery to
prevent intruders from obtaining unauthorized access to MBMS User Services. A
user is authenticated during the MBMS user service registration and MSK re-
keying. R2b: It shall be possible to prevent the use of a particular USIM or
SIM to access MBMS User Services. GAA user security settings provide this.

# J.2 Conclusions
Based on the above results of the consistency check between the security
requirements and security functions/mechanisms the MBMS security requirements
have been adequately met.
###### ## Annex K (Informative): SRTP features not used in MBMS
\- An MBMS capable ME and BM-SC do not need to implement an SRTP key
derivation rate different from zero.
###### ## Annex L (Normative): Multicasting MBMS user data on Iub
TS 25.434 [27] specifies the possibility to use IP multicast as defined in RFC
3376 [25] and RFC 3810 [26] for FACH data streams on Iub Interface. In order
to protect the transfer of MBMS user plane data multicast between the RNC and
NodeBs on the Iub interface over unprotected IP network segments, it is
required to use IPsec ESP with shared secrets according to RFC 4303 [28] as
profiled by TS 33.210 [14] section 5.3 with integrity protection. The use of
confidentiality protection is optional.
NOTE: In case the Iub interfaces are physically protected, the above IPsec
based protection is not needed and this is regarded as a closed IP based RAN.
###### ## Annex M (informative): Relation to IMS based MBMS user services
Security procedures for IMS based MBMS User Services are specified in TS
26.237 [29].
###### ## Annex N (normative): GCSE security aspects
# N.0 GCSE architecture and requirements
GCSE architecture is specified in TS 23.468 [33] and based on the requirements
specified in TS 22.468 [34].
NOTE 1: The MCPTT AS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.179 [47] is an instantiation
of a GCS AS.
NOTE 2: The V2X AS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [48] is an instantiation of
a GCS AS.
# N.1 GCSE security requirements
## N.1.1 General
The security requirements specified in 3GPP TS 22.468 apply.
Note it is assumed that LTE access security mechanisms at the air interface
are used.
Note no requirements are given on Rx and SGi, which are generic interfaces and
therefore not specified in the scope of GCSE.
## N.1.2 GCSE Broadcast Delivery specific security requirements
\- Mutual authentication between a node in the security domain, in which the
BM-SC resides, and a node in the security domain, in which the GCS AS resides,
shall be performed.
NOTE 0: The present document covers only security procedures for deployments
where a Diameter message on the MB2-C interface between BM-SC and GCS AS
passes through at most one Diameter agent in the security domain, in which the
BM-SC resides and at most one Diameter agent in the security domain, in which
the GCS AS resides. Other deployments are possible, but they are not
recommended for the purposes of the MB2-C interface.
\- The signalling messages on MB2-C between the BM-SC and the GCS AS shall be
integrity and confidentiality protected.
\- The signalling messages on MB2-C between the BM-SC and the GCS AS shall be
replay protected.
\- The user plane messages on MB2-U between the BM-SC and the GCS AS shall be
integrity protected.
\- The BM-SC may apply access control on the messages initiated by the GCS AS.
\- The GCS AS may apply access control on the messages initiated by the BM-SC.
NOTE 1: MBMS security may or may not be used independent of GCSE.
# N.2 Security solution for MB2-C interface
The Diameter mechanisms as specified in IETF RFC 3588 [35] shall apply to
MB2-C reference point unless explicitly stated otherwise.
TLS (IETF RFC 5246 [38]) shall be mandatory for implementation on MB2-C. If
SCTP is supported then DTLS shall be supported (IETF RFC 6347 [39]). IKE/IPsec
(IETF RFC 5996 [40]) is optional for implementation on MB2-C.
NOTE: The use of Diameter in the present specification is based on RFC 3588
[35]. Nevertheless, the security mechanism defined for MB2-C reference point
rather aligns with the security mechanism in RFC 6733 [36]. The only
difference to the security in RFC 6733 is that the support for DTLS is made
conditional on the support of SCTP.
The security profiles for TLS and IKE/IPsec are identical to the ones defined
in 3GPP TS 29.368 [37], clause 6.3.3, for the Tsp interface. The security
profile of DTLS is defined in 33.310 [31], annex E.
Mutual authentication for the MB2-C interface shall be performed as defined in
3GPP TS 29.368 [37], clause 6.3.2 for the Tsp interface with MTC-IWF and SCS
replaced by BM-SC and GCS AS respectively. In particular, the rules for
Diameter deployments defined in TS 29.368 [37], clause 6.3.2, shall also apply
to the MB2-C interface.
(D)TLS or IKE/IPsec should be used to protect MB2-C.
If the operator does not use the mechanisms described in this clause, then
other adequate security measures shall be taken to ensure security on that
interface. It is up to the operator, i.e. the owner of the BM-SC, to decide
whether the MB2-C interface is trusted or physically protected, or whether it
needs protection by a cryptographic protocol as specified above.
# N.3 Security solution for MB2-U interface
The assumption is that security in the sense of end-to-end security between UE
and UE or UE and GCS AS is supported at application layer. Thus,
confidentiality protection of MB2-U is out of scope of 3GPP specifications.
Integrity protection is required in order to mitigate the following DoS
attacks: Once ports have been assigned for transferring user data via MB2-U,
i.e. by setting up the connection on MB2-C, these ports may be used by an
intruder to flood the system and UEs with unwanted messages.
3GPP TS 29.468 [41], Figure 7.1-1 depicts the MB2-U protocol stack, in which
user plane data, for instance an IP layer and UDP layer (IETF RFC 768 [42])
are sent over MB2-U interface.
For integrity protection of MB2-U interface, DTLS (IETF RFC 6347 [45]) should
be used. IKE/IPsec/ESP (IETF RFC 4303 [46]) may be used. If NATs are present
on this interface, UDP encapsulating IKE/IPsec/ESP for negotiation of NAT-
Traversal (IETF RFC 3948 [44] and IETF RFCs 3947 [43]) may be used. If the
operator does not use the mechanisms described in this clause, then other
adequate security measures shall be taken to ensure security on that
interface. It is up to the operator, i.e. the owner of the BM-SC, to decide
whether the MB2-U interface is trusted or physically protected, or whether it
needs protection by a cryptographic protocol as specified above.
Traffic on MB2-U is unidirectional from the GCS AS to the BM-SC, and the BM-SC
does not get the user plane address of the GCS AS when the MB2-U connection is
established Thereforeit shall be possible for the BM-SC to request GCS AS over
MB2-C to establish a security association for the user plane. The security
protocol (DTLS or IKE/Ipsec) to be used over MB2-U needs to be configured in
the GCS AS, possibly dependent on BM-SC and/or target network. It shall also
be possible for the BM-SC to receive a request from GCS AS for the
establishment of a security association for the user plane.The target IP
address and possible UDP port for this security association can be provided in
the MB2-C signalling protected by MB2-C security.
###### ## Annex O (normative): Security aspects of xMB reference point between
Content Provider and BM-SC
# O.1 General
The xMB reference point and related stage 2 protocol procedures are defined in
TS 26.346 [13]. The present Annex specifies the security aspects of the xMB
reference point.
# O.2 Protection of the xMB reference point
The control plane (xMB-C) shall use TLS and the user plane (xMB-U) shall use
TLS for TCP-based transport and DTLS for UDP-based transport as is specified
in the following:
The profile for TLS and DTLS implementation and usage shall follow the
provisions given in TS 33.310 [31], Annex E. Certificate based mutual
authentication using TLS or DTLS between a BM-SC and a Content Provider shall
be based on certificate profiles in clauses 6.1.3a and 6.1.4a in TS 33.310
[31]. The structure of the PKI used for these certificates is out of scope of
the present document, thus the provisions in these clauses on issuers of the
certificates do not apply.
After the successful mutual D(TLS) authentication, the BM-SC shall perform
authorization checks based on the subject field of the Content Provider
certificate. For domain based authorization, the subject field shall identify
the domain of the Content Provider and shall be used by the BM-SC for domain
level authorization checks. The BM-SC may additionally perform user-based
authorization. For an additional user-based authorization, after performing
successful domain based authorization, the BM-SC shall authenticate the user
using HTTP digest as specified in RFC 2617 [8] and username/password. The
username shall identify the user (a human user or a machine) and shall be used
by the BM-SC to perform user level authorization checks. The management of the
username and password are out of the scope of the present document.
