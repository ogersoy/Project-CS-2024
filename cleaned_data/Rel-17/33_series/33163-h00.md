# 4 Security Procedures for Battery Efficient Security for Very Low Throughput
MTC Devices (BEST)
## 4.1 Introduction
This specification defines elements, protocols and procedures that enable
battery efficient security for low throughput devices such as MTC devices. The
BEST service is a secure channel between a UE and a HSE, optimised for low
throughput and high latency devices that are battery constrained. The security
is between the UE and either an element in the service provider home network
(the HSE) or an element in the enterprise domain (the EAS). The design is
modular and extensible so that it can be used to satisfy a wide range of use
cases.
The following services are defined:
\- BEST key agreement only service -- This service is a battery efficient
service for key agreement between a BEST compliant UE and the HSE or the EAS.
The user plane for this service is provided by the application layer between
the UE and the EAS and is out of scope of this specification.
\- BEST user plane integrity protected service -- This service is a battery
efficient integrity protected user plane service for low throughput devices.
This service includes the key agreement and includes integrity protected
security over small data over NAS User Plane. The user plane for this service
can be either terminated in the HSE (so called UE-to-HSE mode) or in the EAS
(so called UE-to-EAS mode). Control messages are always terminated in the HSE.
\- BEST user plane confidential service -- This service is a battery efficient
integrity and confidentiality protected user plane service for low throughput
devices. The user plane for this service can be either terminated in the HSE
(so called UE-to-HSE mode) or in the EAS (so called UE-to-EAS mode). Control
messages are always terminated in the HSE.
It may be possible for the UE to have concurrent BEST sessions.
## 4.2 BEST framework service description
### 4.2.1 EPS architecture
Figure 4.2.1-1 shows the EPS architecture of the extended user plane
protection service for the case where the UE's PDN connection terminates at
the P-GW. Figure 4.2.1-2 shows the architecture of the extended user plane
protection service for the case where the UE's PDN connection terminates at
the SCEF.
Figure 4.2.1-1: The architecture of the extended user plane protection service
(P-GW Terminated PDN Connection Option)
Figure 4.2.1-2: The architecture of the extended user plane protection service
(SCEF Terminated PDN Connection Option)
In an EPS network, the BEST service requires the following components:
\- Home Security Endpoint (HSE) -- This is the termination point in the home
network that performs the following functions:
\- Terminating the control plane for BEST between the UE and the HSE
\- Terminating the secure communication for BEST between the UE and the HSE
and forwarding to and from the Data Network via the SGi if UE-to-HSE security
is selected.
\- Routing the user plane traffic for BEST between the UE and the Enterprise
Application Server (EAS) via the SGi if UE-to-EAS security is selected.
\- Anchor for BEST Key agreement only service. Exposes an interface for EAS to
obtain MNO provided pre-shared key.
\- End to Middle Key Server (EMKS) -- This is an optional key server element
that manages the key communication with the HSS (for quintets) and stores keys
to reduce loading on the HSE and HSS. The EMKS has interfaces to the HSS (S6a)
and the HSE (S6a).
The BEST service uses the following interfaces:
\- S6a between the HSS and the HSE
\- S6a between the HSS and EMKS
\- S6a between the EMKS and the HSE
\- BEST-C and BEST-U between the UE and the HSE
\- EAS-C and EAS-U between the HSE and the EAS. Definition of this interface
is out of scope. Annex B describes a candidate interface based on Restful HTTP
for the communication between the HSE and the EAS.
When the UE's PDN connection terminates at the SCEF as shown in Figure
4.2.1-2:
  * The HSE may be implemented as part of the SCEF.
  * The EAS may be an SCS/AS and use a T8 interface to access exposed network capabilities as described in TS 23.682 [14].
\- EMSDP via the SCEF only supports non-IP PDU Type communication.
### 4.2.2 5GS architecture
Figure 4.2.2-1 shows the 5GS architecture of the extended user plane
protection service.
Figure 4.2.2-1: The architecture of the extended user plane protection service
In a 5GS network, the BEST service requires the following components:
\- Home Security Endpoint (HSE) -- This is the termination point in the home
network that performs the following functions:
\- Terminating the control plane for BEST between the UE and the HSE
\- Terminating the secure communication for BEST between the UE and the HSE
and forwarding to and from the Data Network via the N3 if UE-to-HSE security
is selected.
\- Routing the user plane traffic for BEST between the UE and the Enterprise
Application Server (EAS) via the N3 if UE-to-EAS security is selected.
\- Anchor for BEST Key agreement only service. Exposes an interface for EAS to
obtain MNO provided pre-shared key.
The BEST service uses the following interfaces:
\- SBA between the UDM and the HSE
\- BEST-C and BEST-U between the UE and the HSE
\- EAS-C and EAS-U between the HSE and the EAS. Definition of this interface
is out of scope. Annex B describes a candidate interface based on Restful HTTP
for the communication between the HSE and the EAS.
### 4.2.3 Architecture when using GBA, 5G GBA, AKMA or proprietary key
agreement
When using GBA, according to TS 33.220 [13], 5G GBA, according to TS 33.220
[13], Annex N, AKMA, according to TS 33.535 [17], or proprietary key
agreement, the architecture may be either as for EPS architecture or 5GS
architecture as required. In this case, the HSE shall be connected to the EPS
or 5GS architecture according to the GBA, 5G GBA, AKMA or proprietary service
instead. For GBA and 5G GBA, the HSE shall act as NAF. For AKMA, the HSE shall
act as AF.
## 4.3 Procedures between the UE and the HSE
### 4.3.1 Overview of BEST procedures
To use the BEST service, the UE shall setup a PDN connection (EPS) or PDU
Session (5GS) to connect to the HSE. The UE may either use a locally stored IP
address to locate the HSE or use a \"BEST APN\" (EPS) or \"BEST DNN\" (5GS)
where the traffic is directed by the PDN Gateway (EPS) or UPF (5GS) to the
correct HSE for that UE. Once a connection to the HSE exists, the UE may
initiate the BEST service. It is up to the UE as to when it establishes the
PDN connection (EPS) or PDU session (5GS) that is used for BEST control plane
and user plane messages.
The BEST service consists of 5 general processes between the UE and the HSE:
session initiation and key agreement, key management, data transfer, session
termination, and message rejection. The details of the End to Middle Secure
Data Protocol (EMSDP) used for the BEST control plane service and optionally
for user plane security service, is detailed in clause 6.
When BEST user plane (UP) security services are used, UP data plane messages
are between the UE and the HSE in UE to HSE security mode, and between the UE
and the EAS in UE to EAS security mode.
Figure 4.3.1-1: Generalised BEST service flow
### 4.3.2 BEST Session Initiation and Key Agreement
The UE shall initiate a BEST session using the EMSDP Session Request message
following the establishment of the PDN connection (EPS) or PDU Session (5GS).
To optimise the message flow for battery constrained devices, the EMSDP
Session Response is combined with Session Key Agreement.
The EMSDP Session Request message shall include the UE Identity, BEST
capabilities of the UE (i.e. BEST UE configuration), the UE serving network
(conditionally, cf. clause 6.2.6.1.5) and details of the enterprise service
including the Enterprise server Id (EAS Id) that the BEST service is being
used for. The BEST capabilities of the UE includes the BEST release supported
by the UE and it also includes the BEST key agreement(s) that are supported
(e.g. UMTS, EPS, 5G, etc.).
The EMSDP Session Start message shall include the information needed for a key
agreement of the BEST keys, the BEST service parameters (i.e. BEST Service
configuration), and a checksum validating the previous EMSDP Session Request
message. The BEST service parameters include an indication of the BEST key
agreement selected by the HSE.
The HSE shall determine the parameters for the BEST service. The HSE may use
the location information provided by the UE to determine whether aspects of
the BEST service, such as cyphering, can be used in that location. The UE may
request that the BEST user plane is confidentiality protected in the EMSDP
Session Request message, in this case the HSE should take this information
into account to decide whether to activate the user plane confidential service
for the UE.
As a result of the key agreement exchange the UE and HSE shall derive the UE-
to-HSE keys. In case of UE-to-EAS security mode and in case of Key agreement
only service, the UE and HSE shall also derive the intermediate key and the
EAS PSK.
To optimise the BEST service for battery constrained devices, confirmation of
the BEST session start is not required. The UE sending a UP message to the HSE
or EAS is by itself is an implied confirmation. However, if the BEST service
is being used for key agreement only, the HSE shall require the UE to send
EMSDP Session Start Confirmation by setting the indicator in the EMSDP Session
Start message.
### 4.3.3 BEST Session Key Management
At any time during the BEST session, either the UE or the HSE may trigger a
re-negotiation of the keys being used for the BEST service using the EMSDP
Manage Keys Request and Response exchange. To avoid overloading of the HSE and
the HSS, the HSE may throttle or not support UE triggered key renegotiation.
The newly generated keys take effect immediately for EMSDP based BEST UP
services. For procedures when BEST Key management service is used to provide a
pre-shared key to the application layer protocol, refer clause 4.4.4 for
additional details.
### 4.3.4 BEST Session Termination
At any time, either the UE or the HSE may terminate the current BEST session
using the EMSDP Session Termination Request and Response message exchange.
Once terminated, all relevant keys and IDs shall be discarded and both the UE
and HSE shall ignore further messages using that session ID, unless a session
with that ID is re-established using the session initiation process.
### 4.3.5 BEST Message Reject
Either the UE or the HSE may at any time respond with a EMSDP Message Reject
message, upon which the recipient shall discard all relevant keys and IDs of
the session, and both the UE and HSE shall ignore further messages using that
session ID.
The EMSDP Message Reject is also used when the HSE needs to prompt a UE to
initiate a new session using the Session Start message. For example, if it
receives a UP packet from the UE on a BEST session for which it aged out the
context.
## 4.4 Procedures between the HSE and the EAS
### 4.4.1 Message Exchange Overview
The message exchanges between the HSE and the EAS are essentially a mirror of
the ones between the UE and the HSE. All BEST control plane messages are
terminated or initiated by the HSE. When BEST user plane security services are
used in UE-to-EAS mode, the user plane security is end-to-end between the UE
and the EAS.
NOTE: The actual details and standardization of the HSE to EAS interfaces is
out of scope of this document.
Figure 4.4.1-1: Generalised BEST EAS service flow
### 4.4.2 EAS Registration for BEST Service
As a prerequisite to using BEST service, the EAS shall register with the HSE
over a secure connection by providing its identity (Enterprise server Id).
This results in a session context to be established in the HSE for the
registered EAS.
A secure connection is established between the HSE and the EAS as part of the
management of the BEST service between the Enterprise and the HSE, cf clause
7.1.
NOTE: The procedures for establishing up a secure connection and EAS
registration with the HSE are out of scope of this TS.
### 4.4.3 Key Request
During the Key agreement procedure, described in clause 4.3.2, HSE may forward
the derived key to the EAS in the EAS Session Request message.
When BEST is used for Key agreement only or when BEST UP service is used in
UE-to-EAS mode, the HSE shall forward the pre-shared key (K~EAS_PSK~) that is
specifically derived for the enterprise as defined by key definition rules in
clause 5.1.2. It also includes the Intermediate Key Id in this message. The
EAS shall respond with the EAS Session Start message.
When BEST is used for Key agreement only, the EAS may initiate a Key Request
by sending the EAS Session Request message. The UE includes Intermediate Key
Id needed to identify the UE-specific Intermediate key and the associated EAS
specific pre-shared key in the HSE. The EAS obtains the key identifier from
the UE during application layer session establishment. The HSE shall respond
with the pre-shared key (KEAS_PSK)..
### 4.4.4 Key Refresh
At any time during the BEST session, either the UE or the HSE or the EAS may
trigger a re-negotiation of the keys being used for the BEST service. It is
optional for the HSE to support UE initiated key refresh, which it signals to
the UE in the Session Start message. If not supporting it, an HSE will ignore
UE triggered key refresh messages.The UE and the HSE triggered re-negotiation
is described in clause 4.3.3. For UE-to-EAS mode BEST UP service and BEST Key
agreement only service, the newly derived pre-shared key (EAS PSK) may be sent
by the HSE to the EAS. This is further described in clause 6.2.7.2.
The EAS-triggered re-negotiation of keys applies to BEST UP Service in UE-to-
EAS mode. The trigger for generating new keys is appropriately propagated to
the UE using EMSDP Manage Keys Request. The EAS is provided with newly derived
EAS PSK from the HSE.
For BEST key-agreement only service, there is no provision for the application
layer to trigger generation of the new EAS PSK. The application layer
continues to use the existing pre-shared key to generate fresh session keys
for consecutive instances of the protocol. When a new EAS PSK is generated in
the HSE, the application layer obtains it either via an update from the HSE or
when the EAS contacts the HSE again when a new application layer session is
set up.
### 4.4.5 Session Termination
At any time, any of the BEST functions, the UE or the EAS or the HSE may
terminate the current BEST session using the BEST or EAS Session Termination
Request and Response message exchange. The session terminate request shall be
applied to all the involved functions for a given session. Once terminated,
all relevant keys and IDs shall be discarded and the UE, the EAS and HSE shall
ignore further messages using that session ID, unless a session with that ID
is re-established using the session initiation process.
### 4.4.6 Message Reject
The UE or the EAS or the HSE may at any time trigger a EAS Message Reject
message, upon which the recipient shall discard all relevant keys and IDs of
the session, and the UE, the EAS and HSE shall ignore further messages using
that session ID.
## 4.5 BEST Data Service
Once the BEST session is successfully initiated, the UE or the HSE or EAS may
send UP data using the negotiated keys.
If the BEST UP session is set up between the UE and the HSE, then the UP
packets are initiated or terminated by the HSE. In this case, the low power
optimized EMSDP protocol, as detailed in clause 6, is used.
If the BEST UP session is setup between the UE and the EAS, then the HSE
passes the UP messages to the EAS after checking the message is formatted
correctly and that it is a UP message. The key used by the UE and EAS to
encrypt and decrypt data messages (when required) is KE2E~enc~ and to
integrity protect the message is KE2E~int~. Verification of any Key ID,
counter, message integrity and deciphering is the responsibility of the EAS.
If the BEST key agreement service is used to set up a data session between the
UE and EAS, the UE and EAS need to use a security protocol with the EAS PSK
other than EMSDP, e.g., IKE/IPsec or (D)TLS for user plane data transmission.
In this case, the HSE does not handle the UP.
## 4.6 Key Management
### 4.6.1 Key Agreement and Refresh
#### 4.6.1.1 Key setup messaging between HSE and UE
New keys are agreed either at the start of a BEST session or as required due
to key aging or counter thresholds being met. Key agreement can be based on
the 3GPP AKA mechanism detailed in TS 33.102 [3], TS 33.401 [12], or TS 33.501
[16], respectively, or based on one of the following external key agreement
methods: GBA [13], 5G GBA [13], Annex N, AKMA [17], or proprietary key
agreement. For 3GPP AKA based key agreement, the AKA challenge is then
transported between the HSE and the UE as part of the BEST service detailed in
clause 4.3.2. The key hierarchy is shown in clause 4.6.2.2.
The EMDSP protocol has 7 Key IDs for each session ID. Each Key ID has a
separate keyset consisting of an integrity Key (K~E2Mint~), an encryption key
(K~E2Menc~), optionally an Intermediate Key (K~Intermediate~) and optionally
an EAS PSK (K~EAS_PSK~). The Key IDs shall be set during the derivations of
the keys as specified in clause 5.1.
The Intermediate Key (K~Intermediate~) is used together with a separate
enterprise server identifier (EAS Id) to calculate the EAS PSK (K~EAS_PSK~).
There can be many K~EAS_PSK~ derived from one K~Intermediate~.
The EAS PSK (K~EAS_PSK)~ is used together with the Enterprise Key to calculate
K~E2Eint~ and K~E2Eenc~ when BEST User plane security services are used in UE-
to-EAS mode.
Figure 4.6.1.1-1 shows the generic key agreement process for EPS networks:
Figure 4.6.1.1-1: Generic BEST key agreement process for EPS networks
The Key agreement steps are:
**1\. EMSDP Session Request (UE ID, BEST capabilities, Enterprise information
serving network (cond)).** The UE shall send the EMSDP Session Request (UE ID,
BEST capabilities, Enterprise information, serving network (cond)) to set up a
new BEST session. The BEST capabilities shall indicate that EPS key agreement
is supported.
**2\. Keys required?** \- the HSE shall check to see if there are valid keys
with valid counter values available in the HSE for that UE then the following
is checked:
\- If the HSE has a valid set of keys for the indicated session and the UE ID
is valid for that session then the HSE may start the BEST session without re-
negotiating the keys (step 8).
\- If the UE ID is valid for that HSE and the HSE does not have a valid set of
keys for the indicated session or the HSE wishes to update the keys, then it
shall first renegotiate the keys (steps 2 to 7) and then start the BEST
session (step 8).
\- If the UE ID is not valid for that session ID or the UE does not support
the level of service required by the HSE or the enterprise information is not
valid for the HSE, then the HSE may reject the command.
3**. Authentication-Information-Request over S6a interface** \-- The HSE shall
use the S6a interface to the HSS to request one or more authentication vectors
using the UE IMSI.. For UEs the request shall indicate that EPS authentication
vectors are requested. For legacy UEs supporting BEST, the request shall
indicate that UMTS authentication vectors are requested
**4\. Authentication-Information-Answer over S6a interface** \-- The HSS uses
the S6a interface to the HSE to return the requested authentication vectors.
**a. Authentication-Information-Request over the S6a interface between HSE and
EMKS** \-- Where an EMKS is used, the HSE shall use the S6a interface to the
EMKS to request an authentication vector using the UE IMSI.
**b. Authentication-Information-Request over the S6a interface between EMKS
and HSE** \-- The EMKS shall use the S6a interface to the HSS to request one
or more authentication vectors using the UE IMSI.
**c. Authentication-Information-Answer over the S6a interface between EMKS and
HSE** \-- The HSS shall use the S6a interface to the EMKS to return the
requested authentication vectors. These vectors may be stored on the EMKS for
later use.
**d. Authentication-Information-Answer over the S6a interface between HSE and
EMKS** \-- The EMKS uses the S6a interface to the HSE to return the requested
authentication vector.
**5\. Calculate UE-to-HSE Keys** \- See key derivation details in clause 5.
**6\. The HSE may optionally send \"EAS Session Request\" to the EAS** \-- In
case BEST UP service is used in UE-to-EAS mode, the HSE shall use the HSE
interface to the EAS to inform the EAS of the new UE-to-EAS session request
and shall forward the EAS PSK (K~EAS_PSK~) to the EAS. In case the BEST key
agreement service is used, the HSE shall forward to the EAS, the EAS PSK
(K~EAS_PSK~) and the key identifier for the Intermediate Pre Shared Key
(K~Intermediate~).
**7\. The Enterprise Server sends a \"EAS Session Start\" to the HSE** \-- The
Enterprise Server shall respond by sending the \"UE-to-EAS Session Start\"
message. In case BEST UP service is used, this message may contain an EAS
container that includes an identifier for the Enterprise Key.
**8\. EMSDP Session Start message** \- The HSE shall send a EMSDP Session
Start (Key Agreement, Session Parameters, Request Validation, HSE ID(opt) ,
EAS container (opt)). The Session Parameters shall contain RAND and AUTN from
the received authentication vectors. As described in TS 33.401 [12], clause
6.1.2, the \"separation bit\" in the AMF field of AUTN shall be set to 0 if
UMTS authentication vectors have been received, and the \"separation bit\" in
the AMF field of AUTN shall be set to 1 if EPS authentication vectors have
been received. The Session Parameters shall indicate the selected key
agreement (i.e. EPS key agreement).
**9**. **EMSDP Session Start Confirmation** \- UE optionally, if requested in
the Session Start Confirmation, responds with an EMSDP Session Start
Confirmation message.
**10\. EAS Session Start Confirmation** \- The HSE may optionally send EAS
Session Start Confirmation.
**11\. Calculate UE Keys** \-- See key derivation details in clause 5.
**12\. Calculate UE-to-EAS Keys** \-- In case of the UE-to-EAS BEST UP
service, the Enterprise server generates UE-to-EAS keys as per the key
derivation details in clause 5.
Figure 4.6.1.1-2 shows the generic key agreement process for 5GS networks:
Figure 4.6.1.1-2: Generic BEST key agreement process for 5GS networks
The Key agreement steps are:
**1\. EMSDP Session Request (UE ID, BEST capabilities, Enterprise information,
serving network).** The UE shall send the EMSDP Session Request (UE ID, BEST
capabilities, Enterprise information, serving network) to set up a new BEST
session. The BEST capabilities shall indicate that 5G key agreement is
supported.
**2\. Keys required?** \- the HSE shall check to see if there are valid keys
with valid counter values available in the HSE for that UE then the following
is checked:
\- If the EMSDP Session Request is sent with a valid Session ID (i.e., not 0)
and there is a valid key set for that session, then the HSE may start the BEST
session without re-negotiating the keys (step 8). In this case the received UE
ID may be ignored.
\- If the EMSDP Session Request is sent without a valid Session ID or using a
single byte Session ID set to 0 or the HSE wishes to update the keys, then it
shall first renegotiate the keys (steps 2 to 7) and then start the BEST
session (step 8).
\- If the UE does not support the level of service required by the HSE or the
enterprise information is not valid for the HSE, then the HSE may reject the
command.
**3.** **Nudm_UEAuthentication_GetBESTav Request over SBA interface** \-- The
HSE shall use the SBA interface to the UDM/ARPF to request an authentication
vector using the UE SUCI. The service operation
Nudm_UEAuthentication_GetBESTav Request has the same inputs as the service
operation Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request.
**4\. Nudm_UEAuthentication_GetBESTav Response over SBA interface** \-- The
UDM/ARPF uses the SBA interface to the HSE to return a BEST-adapted 5G HE
authentication vector (if 5G AKA is the selected authentication method) or a
transformed authentication vector (if EAP-AKA\' is the selected authentication
method).The service operation Nudm_UEAuthentication_GetBESTav Response has the
same outputs as the service operation Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response,
except that in the BEST-adapted 5G HE authentication vector the parameter
K~AUSF~ is replaced by K~HSE~ (see clause 5.1.0a).
**5\. Calculate UE-to-HSE Keys** \- See key derivation details in clause 5.
**6\. The HSE may optionally send \"EAS Session Request\" to the EAS** \-- In

and shall forward the EAS PSK (K~EAS_PSK~) to the EAS. In case the BEST key
agreement service is used, the HSE shall forward to the EAS, the EAS PSK
(K~EAS_PSK~) and the key identifier for the Intermediate Pre Shared Key
(K~Intermediate~).

#### 4.6.1.2 Usage of Keys
For UE-to-HSE BEST UP sessions, the following keys shall be used:
\- The K~E2Menc~ shall be used by the UE and the HSE for the encryption of the
user plane and the control plane, according to the agreed encryption
algorithm.
\- The K~E2Mint~ shall be used by the UE and the HSE for the integrity
protection of the user plane and the control plane according to the agreed
integrity protection algorithm.
For UE-to-EAS BEST UP sessions, the following keys shall be used:
\- The K~E2Menc~ shall be used by the UE and the HSE for the encryption of the
control plane, according to the agreed encryption algorithm.
\- The K~E2Mint~ shall be used by the UE and the HSE for the integrity
protection of the control plane according to the agreed integrity protection
algorithm.
\- The K~E2Eenc~ shall be used by the UE and the EAS for the encryption of the
user plane, according to the agreed encryption algorithm.
\- The K~E2Eint~ shall be used by the UE and the EAS for the integrity
protection of the user plane according to the agreed integrity protection
algorithm.
For key-agreement only BEST service, the following key shall be used:
\- The EAS PSK (K~EAS_PSK~) shall be used by the EAS and UE for protection of
the user plane between the EAS and UE. The protocol to be used between the UE
and EAS is out of scope of this specification. Optionally, further keys may be
derived from the EAS PSK.
NOTE: As the K~EAS_PSK~ is known to the HSE, the EAS and the UE will have to
transform the key further to achieve end to end security. This transformation
is out of scope of this specification.
\- The K~E2Menc~ shall be used by the UE and the HSE for the encryption of the
control plane, according to the agreed encryption algorithm.
\- The K~E2Mint~ shall be used by the UE and the HSE for the integrity
protection of the control plane according to the agreed integrity protection
algorithm.
#### 4.6.1.3 Key Setup for BEST session end point modification
The modification of a BEST UE-to-EAS UP session to a BEST UE-to-HSE UP session
does not require any new calculations of keys.
The modification of a BEST UE-to-HSE UP session to a BEST UE-to-EAS UP session
requires new keys to be calculated when no UE-to-EAS keys are available in the
EAS. Before sending the EMSDP Modification command the HSE does the following:
\- Checks with the EAS whether it has UE-to-EAS keys in storage
\- If not, obtains a EAS container that may contain a key identifier for the
Enterprise Key from the EAS and forwards this to the UE in the EMSDP
Modification command.
#### 4.6.1.4 BEST key handling
The aging of keys and any counter window used are out of scope of this
specification.

# 6 End to Middle Secured Data Protocol (EMSDP)
## 6.1 Introduction
The EMSDP protocol is used for the BEST service. This protocol runs between
the UE and the HSE and has been optimised for efficient, secure transfer of
both BEST user plane and control plane data.
## 6.2 EMSDP Protocol Description
### 6.2.1 Data Stack
Figures 6.2.1-1, 6.2.1-2, 6.2.1-3, and 6.2.1-4 show examples with the LTE
network of the data stacks for the EMSDP transfers (based on 3GPP TS 23.401
[4]) between the HSE and the UE.
Figure 6.2.1-1: Non-IP PDU Type data stack for the EMSDP transfers over UP
Figure 6.2.1-2: Non-IP PDU Type data stack for the EMSDP transfers over NAS
via the PDN GW
Figure 6.2.1-3: Non-IP PDU Type data stack for the EMSDP transfers over NAS
via the SCEF
If the UE selects the non-IP PDU data type as defined in clause 4.3.17.8 of
3GPP TS 23.401[2], the PDN GW encapsulates the non-IP EMSDP payload in PtP (IP
and UDP as detailed in clause 4.3.17.8.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401[4]) for the
communication with the HSE. In case of the EMSDP is in IP PDU Type, the PtP
encapsulation is unnecessary, and the UE's IP packet is directly forwarded to
the HSE. This is shown on Figure 6.2.1-2.
Figure 6.2.1-4: IP PDU Type data stack for the EMSDP transfers
In all four scenarios for UE-to-EAS BEST sessions, the HSE may forward the
EMSDP user plane unmodified to the EAS. When the session uses a non-IP PDU
Type connection that terminates at the SCEF, SCEF API's are used to forward
the EMSDP user plane unmodified to the HSE. The signalling plane always
terminates in the HSE.
Note 1: It is up to the operator to decide the protocol between the HSE and
the EAS. For example, an operator may agree to use the optional Annex B
protocol. In that case, the HSE will have to encapsulate the user data in an
agreed message format.
Note 2: The method by which the UE discovers the IP address of the HSE is an
operational matter, out of scope.
Note 3: The SCEF does not support IP routing towards the EAS.
Note 4: The EMSDP Payload may carry a non-IP or an IP message. If the message
in the EMSDP Payload is already IP, after decapsulating the payload the HSE
just forwards it onto the SGi. If the message in EMSDP Payload is non-IP, then
the HSE needs to encapsulate it, for example in IP/UDP, which shown on the
above diagrams with dashed boxes. Handling of the EMSDP Payload is controlled
by operator policy and is out of scope.
### 6.2.2 EMSDP general structure
This clause details a type 01 control plane EMSDP message and a type 01 user
plane EMSDP message.
Figure 6.2.2-1 shows the general structure of the EMSDP type 01 message:
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+ | Co | | | | | | | | | | ntrol | | | | | | | | | | Plane | | | | | | | | | | type | | | | | | | | | | 01 | | | | | | | | | | mes | | | | | | | | | | sage: | | | | | | | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+ | UP / | RFU | Key | CP | Se | EMSDP | Cmd | MAC | | | CP | | ID | CO | ssion | Co | Op | | | | Flag | | | UNTER | ID | mmand | tions | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+ | 1 bit | 1 bit | 3 | Note | Note | Note | Note | Note | | | | | bits | 4 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Note | Note | Note | Note | | | | | | | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Note | | | | | | | | | | 3 | | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+ | User | | | | | | | | | | Plane | | | | | | | | | | type | | | | | | | | | | 01 | | | | | | | | | | mes | | | | | | | | | | sage: | | | | | | | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+ | UP / | RFU | Key | UP | Se | Data | Data | MAC | | | CP | | ID | CO | ssion | L | | | | | Flag | | | UNTER | ID | ength | | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+ | 1 bit | 1 bit | 3 | Note | Note | Note | Note | Note | | | | | bits | 4 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Note | Note | Note | Note | | | | | | | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Note | | | | | | | | | | 3 | | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+
Note 1: The length of these fields is indicated in the BEST HSE configuration
TLV from the HSE.
Note 2: These fields are included in the integrity protection calculation.
Note 3: These fields are encrypted when encryption is used. When encrypted
these fields are replaced by the encrypted output.
Note 4: The length of this field is as defined in the BEST Counter Scheme
being used.
**Figure 6.2.2-1: data stack for the EMSDP transfers**
**UP / CP Flag:** This is a 1 bit field that when set to '1' means that the
data packet is a User Plane message and when set to '0' means that the message
is a control plane message.
**RFU:** This is a 1 bit field that is reserved for future use. Set to '0'.
**Key ID:** This is a 3 bit field that indicates the key being used for
encryption and Integrity protection. If no keys have been agreed between the
HSE and the UE then this shall be '000'. The Key ID is associated to a
specific Session ID.
**CP COUNTER:** This is a counter, used for control plane data messages, that
is incremented every control plane message. It is used to protect control
plane data messages against replay attacks and its length is set based on the
counter scheme indicated in the BEST HSE configuration TLV (minimum length is
3 bits). There are separate counter values for UE to HSE and HSE to UE. This
counter value is associated to a specific Session ID. There are two
independent CP counter values, one for messages from the UE and one for
messages to the UE. The HSE shall not check the CP counter value if the
incoming message is \"EMSDP Session Request \" and the Session ID is 0.
**UP COUNTER:** This is a counter, used for user plain data messages, that is
incremented every user plain data message. It is used to protect user plain
data message against replay and its length is set based on the counter scheme
indicated in the BEST HSE configuration TLV (minimum length is 3 bits). There
are separate counter values for UE to HSE and HSE to UE. This counter value is
associated to a specific Session ID. There are two independent UP counter
values, one for messages from the UE and one for messages to the UE.
**Session ID:** This indicates the identifier for the current session. The
value is assigned by the HSE. Its length is determined according to the
Session ID scheme that is agreed. For signalling messages sent from the UE,
outside of a BEST session, the Session ID length shall be 1 octet and the
Session ID value shall be all 0's. Two simultaneously existing sessions shall
not have the same Session ID unless they correspond to the same UE.
**EMSDP Command** : This is a 1 byte field that contains the signalling
command. The defined commands are detailed below.
**Cmd Options** : This is a TLV container that contains TLV elements that
detail the options for the EMSDP command. The defined options TLVs are
detailed below.
**MAC** : This contains the truncated integrity result for this data packet
calculated using the agreed integrity algorithm. Its length is set in the BEST
HSE configuration TLV. For an EMSDP session request command the MAC shall not
be present.
**Data length** : This holds the length of the following data in this data
packet. Its length is set in the EMSDP Session Request message. This is not
present if the data length is set to 0 in the BEST HSE configuration TLV.
**Data** : This is the data being transferred.
Note: The content and processing of the BEST UP EMSDP data payload is out of
scope.
### 6.2.3 EMSDP Counter and Session ID Schemes
#### 6.2.3.1 Optimised EMSDP counter scheme
The optimised EMSDP counter scheme has a 3 bit counter length followed by the
counter value. This allows the counter length to be changed on a per message
basis. The 3 bits are used to indicate the number of octets the counter is on,
the value "000" is reserved for future use. So for instance:
> Counter value "1" is represented as "001 00000001"
>
> Counter value "257" is represented as "010 00000001 00000001"
Counter values are rejected if the counter value is less than or equal to a
valid counter value already received. The HSE and the UE may also reject a
message with a counter higher than a specific offset from the last valid
counter value received. The HSE shall not check the counter value if the
message is EMSDP Session Request and the Session ID is 0.
The optimised EMSDP counter scheme is defined as scheme 01.
#### 6.2.3.2 Optimised EMSDP Session ID scheme
The Optimised EMSDP session ID scheme enables the EMSDP session ID to have a
known length that can be as long as the application requires it.
In this scheme the highest bit of every session ID byte is an indication that
the following byte is also part of the session ID.
For example the following session IDs are valid under this scheme: \'01\',
\'F469\', \'82A57F\'
This is the default session ID scheme for EMSDP messages and is defined as
scheme 01.
### 6.2.4 EMSDP Integrity protection
The integrity protection algorithm to be used and the length of the MAC is
selected by the HSE with the EMSDP Session Start message.
Integrity protection is mandatory for all control plane and user plane
messages except for the following control plane commands when no valid keyset
is agreed between the UE and HSE:
\- an EMSDP session request command originating from the UE or the HSE. For
this command the MAC shall not be present.
For an EMSDP start session command, originating from the HSE, if the Key Id
for the message is the same as the Key Id indicated in the Key agreement TLV
then the MAC shall be calculated using the new keys resulting from the
authentication vectors in the Key agreement TLV.
For all other signalling plane and user plane data packets the MAC shall be
computed as follows:
First the following fields are calculated (where needed for the chosen
algorithm):
INPUT-I set to the message Counter Value expanded and right padded with 0's to
a fixed size of 4 bytes.

correct size from the right.
### 6.2.5 EMSDP Encryption
The encryption protection algorithm to be used is selected by the HSE with the
EMSDP Session Start message. If EEA0 is indicated then the message shall not
be encrypted.
Encryption is mandatory for all control plane and user plane messages when an
encryption algorithm other than EEA0 is selected by the HSE with the EMSDP
Session Start message, except for the following control plane commands when no
valid keyset is agreed between the UE and HSE:
\- an EMSDP session request command originating from the UE or the HSE
\- an EMSDP start session command originating from the HSE

Response:
If the HSE agrees to setup the session, it shall respond with an EMSDP Session
Start command.
If the HSE does not agree to setup a BEST session, it may respond with a EMSDP
Message Reject command. This command may include the reason that the request
has been rejected.
##### 6.2.6.1.2 EMSDP Session Start
The EMSDP Session Start command is used by the HSE to setup a new BEST
session. This message shall contain information on the BEST service setup, key
agreement details, a hash of the information sent by the UE in the prior EMSDP
Session Request command and optionally, the HSE identity.
On receipt of this command the UE shall:
\- If no indication is given, perform a UTMS security context authentication
with the USIM using the RAND and AUTN combination from the Key Agreement TLV.
If the USIM returns IK and CK values, the UE uses these keys and the HSE
identity supplied (if the HSE Identity TLV is present) to generate the session
keys for the EMSDP messages as detailed in clause 5. If the USIM determines
re-synchronisation is required and returns an AUTS then the UE sends a EMSDP
Message Reject command containing the AUTS to the HSE.
\- If indicated, perform an EPS security context authentication with the USIM
using the RAND and AUTN combination from the Key Agreement TLV. If the USIM
returns IK and CK values, the UE uses these keys to derive K~ASME~ and
subsequently use K~ASME~ and the HSE identity supplied (if the HSE Identity
TLV is present) to generate the session keys for the EMSDP messages as
detailed in clause 5. If the USIM determines re-synchronisation is required
and returns an AUTS then the UE sends a EMSDP Message Reject command
containing the AUTS to the HSE.
\- If indicated, perform a 5G security context authentication with the USIM
using the RAND and AUTN combination from the Key Agreement TLV. If the USIM
returns IK and CK values, the UE uses these keys to derive K~HSE~ (depending
on the authentication method selected) and subsequently use K~HSE~ and the HSE
identity supplied (if the HSE Identity TLV is present) to generate the session
keys for the EMSDP messages as detailed in clause 5. The derivation of K~HSE~
is described in clause 5.1.0a. If the USIM determines re-synchronisation is
required and returns an AUTS then the UE sends a EMSDP Message Reject command
containing the AUTS to the HSE.
\- If indicated, perform a GBA based authentication. After establishing the
agreed key (see clause 5.1.1), the UE uses this key and the HSE identity
supplied (if the HSE Identity TLV is present) to generate the session keys for
the EMSDP messages as detailed in clause 5.
\- If indicated, perform a 5G GBA based authentication. After establishing the
agreed key (see clause 5.1.1), the UE uses this key and the HSE identity
supplied (if the HSE Identity TLV is present) to generate the session keys for
the EMSDP messages as detailed in clause 5.
\- If indicated, perform a AKMA based authentication. After establishing the
agreed key (see clause 5.1.1), the UE uses this key and the HSE identity
supplied (if the HSE Identity TLV is present) to generate the session keys for
the EMSDP messages as detailed in clause 5.
\- If indicated, perform a proprietry based authentication. After establishing
the agreed key (see clause 5.1.1), the UE uses this key and the HSE identity
supplied (if the HSE Identity TLV is present) to generate the session keys for
the EMSDP messages as detailed in clause 5.
\- Verify that the UE supports the BEST service indicated in the BEST Service
configuration TLV.
\- Verify the received message format, the CP COUNTER value and the message
MAC value.
\- Verify that the MAC supplied in the MAC TLV matches the MAC that would be
produced for the previous EMSDP Session Request message if the BEST
configuration in the BEST Service configuration TLV had been applied using the
integrity key calculated from the Key agreement TLV.
The EMSDP Session Start command has the following cmd options:

The EMSDP Manage Keys command is used by the HSE to agree new keys,replace a
key and delete existing keys.
When the HSE indicates \"Add new key\" and the key ID indicated in the Key
Agreement TLV is not currently used in the UE, then the UE shall use the
information in the Key Agreement TLV to create a new key that can be used in
this EMSDP session. If the Key ID is already in use then the UE shall send a
EMSDP Message Reject command.
When the HSE indicates \"Update key\" and the Key ID in the Key Agreement TLV
is the same as the Key ID in the in the Key Management TLV, then the UE shall
delete the key indicated in the Key Management TLV and then create a new key
use the information in the Key Agreement TLV that can be used in this EMSDP
session. If the Key ID of the key to be deleted is no longer valid then the UE
shall silently ignore this request.
When the HSE indicates \" Update key\" and the Key ID in the Key Agreement TLV
is different to the Key ID in the in the Key Management TLV, then the UE shall
create a new key using the information in the Key Agreement TLV that can be
used in this EMSDP session. The key indicated in the Key Management TLV shall
be deleted when the UE receives the first EMSDP message using the new key ID.
If the Key ID of the key to be created is already in use then the UE shall
send a EMSDP Message Reject command. If the Key ID of the key to be deleted is
no longer valid then the UE shall silently ignore this request.
When the HSE indicates \"delete key\" then the UE shall delete the key
indicated in the Key Management TLV. If the Key ID of the key to be deleted is
no longer valid then the UE shall silently ignore this request.

### 6.2.7 Procedures for BEST when using EMSDP
#### 6.2.7.1 Introduction
This clause contains the procedures between the UE, HSE, HSS and EAS for the
following BEST Services when using EMSDP:
\- BEST key agreement only service in clause 6.2.7.2
\- BEST user plane integrity protected service in clause 6.2.7.3
\- BEST user plane confidential service in clause 6.2.7.4
#### 6.2.7.2 Procedures for BEST Key Agreement Only Service using EMSDP
Figure 6.2.7.2-1 shows the messages exchanged between the UE, HSE, HSS/EMKS
and EAS in order to setup a BEST Session when using EMSDP. In this figure, the
EMKS and HSS are collapsed into one.
Figure 6.2.7.2-1: BEST Session Setup Procedure for BEST Key Agreement Only
Service using EMSDP
The above figure depicts BEST Session setup procedure for Key Agreement Only
service. The EAS PSK is provided by the HSE to the EAS in step 5. The UE
derives all the required keys in Step 9.
The EAS shall also be able to obtain the EAS PSK anytime after the BEST
Session is setup by the UE. The EAS initiates a EAS Session Request message
with the required Key Id (specific to the UE). The HSE derives EAS PSK and
provides it in the EAS Session Start message.
NOTE1: The Key Id refers to the Intermediate Key Identifer that uniquely
identifies the UE-specific Intermediate key. The mechanism by which UE
provides Key Id to the EAS is out of scope of this specification.
NOTE 2: The EAS application layer key derivation in step 6 when using key
agreement only service is out of scope of this specification.
Figure 6.2.7.2-2 shows the messages exchanged between the UE, HSE, HSS/EMKS
and EAS in order to refresh the keys when using EMSDP. In this figure, the
EMKS and HSS are collapsed into one.
Figure 6.2.7.2-2: BEST Procedure for Key Refresh using EMSDP
In the above figure, steps 1-5 and 7-9 are mandatory. Steps 10 and 11 are
optional depending on whether the HSE has set the \'Confirm Authentication\'
flag in the \'EMSDP Session Response\' message. The contents of the respective
commands are given in the respective clauses that detail the commands. Step 6
is optional and out of scope.

the one detailed in clause 6.7.4.3.
# 7 BEST Service Management
## 7.1 Ability to enable and disable the BEST service
The HSE may allow the enterprise to manage the BEST service. The service shall
allow enable / disable of the BEST service down to an individual UE level. The
interface for the management of the BEST service between the enterprise and
the HSE is out of scope of this document. However it is expected that such an
interface would have the following abilities:
\- a mechanism that allows the service to be removed for a specific subscriber
at the network end (probably re-using a service provisioning service).
\- the ability for the enterprise to enable / disable the E2M security service
for one or many of their endpoints through communication with the operators
CIoT interface. (This may be because other security mechanisms are being
used).
\- The ability for the home network to disable the BEST service due to non-
payment or security concerns.
If the BEST service parameters in the HSE change as a result of the management
of the BEST service for a specific UE and the BEST service is not currently
active with that UE then the changes shall take effect the next BEST session.
If the BEST service parameters in the HSE change as a result of the management
of the BEST service for a specific UE and the BEST service is currently active
with that UE then the HSE shall end the current BEST session and where
appropriate start a new BEST session using the new BEST service parameters.
The UE may allow the application connected to it to manage the BEST service if
the Local BEST configuration management flag within the protocol configuration
options of a ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST indicates this is
allowed.
If the BEST service parameters in the UE change as a result of the management
of the BEST service and the BEST service is not currently active then the
changes shall take effect the next BEST session.
If the BEST service parameters in the UE change as a result of the management
of the BEST service and the BEST service is currently active in that UE then
the UE shall end the current BEST session and where appropriate start a new
BEST session using the new BEST service parameters.
The UE may choose not to accept data that does not meet the defined security
requirements.
When the BEST service is disabled the HSE and UE shall act as though the BEST
service is not supported.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Structure of APN names for BEST
Due to regulatory requirements, operators may have to disable the best service
for UEs roaming in their network. A simple, but effective method relies on the
MME capability to filter specific APNs. For that reason, a BEST APN structure
is proposed in this section. Operators may agree on a different method in
bilateral requirements.
APNs that are used for the BEST service may reside in a specific subdomain of
the operator. It is proposed to use the subdomain \'best\' for this specific
service.
Note: For example, if the operator uses operator.cc as a domain for APNs, the
best servers should be in the domain \'best.operator.cc\'. So
\'apn.best.operator.cc\' would be an APN that is best capable.
###### ## Annex B (informative): HSE to EAS interface based on Restful HTTP
# B.1 Introduction
This annex contains example of a RESTful HTTP interface between the HSE and
the EAS.
# B.2 Restful HTTP interface
## B.2.1 Overview
It is described as follows:
\- TCP provides communication service at the transport layer
\- TLS provides security to the communication
\- HTTP based transport of XML data
\- XML documents used to embed specific data structures, such as keys etc.
Figure B.2.1-1 illustrates the protocol stack of this reference point.
{width="5.268055555555556in" height="2.4895833333333335in"}
Figure: B.2.1-1 RESTful HTTPS between EMKS(HSE) and EMSE(EAS)
The HSE and the EAS act as both HTTP client and server. The underlying TCP
connection permits bidirectional communication between the EAS and the HSE.
RESTful HTTP is used at the application delivery layer. The content type of
the RESTful HTTP is XML.
The unsecured HTTP protocol shall be combined with TLS, as HTTPS, to provide
confidentiality and integrity protection. Mutual authentication shall be
enabled in TLS for authenticating and allowing only an authorized third party
EAS to access the HSE. The profile for TLS implementation and usage shall
follow the provisions given in 3GPP TS 33.310 [11], Annex E.
## B.2.2 Procedures over the RESTful HTTP reference point
### B.2.2.1 Overview of the procedures
Following procedures are supported over the RESTful HTTP reference point:
\- Initial registration by the EAS
\- Obtaining UE specific pre-shared key from the HSE
\- Obtaining UE specific pre-shared key during BEST Session Setup
\- Deregistration by EAS
### B.2.2.2 Initial registration by EAS
The EAS registers with the HSE by sending an HTTP POST "EAS Session Register"
message to the HSE including its identifier (EAS_Id). The HSE establishes a
session context for this EAS and returns session id in HTTP 201 CREATED.
### B.2.2.3 Obtaining UE specific pre-shared key from the EAS
The EAS obtains UE specific pre-shared key (K~Int_EAS_PSK~) from the HSE by
sending an EAS Session Request message including an identity of the UE and the
key identifier received from the UE. The HSE derives EAS specific pre-shared
key and provides it in the EAS Session Start message.
### B.2.2.4 Obtaining UE specific pre-shared key during BEST Session Setup
During BEST Session setup, the HSE forwards the EAS specific pre-shared key
(K~Int_EAS_PSK~) in the EAS Session Request message. The EAS responds with a
EAS Session Start message.
### B.2.2.5 Deregistration by EAS
When the session needs to be terminated, EAS may send an HTTP DELETE message
including the session ID to the HSE.
