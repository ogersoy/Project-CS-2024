# Introduction
The present document has been produced by the 3GPP TSG SA to enable
standardisation of Lawful Interception (LI) of telecommunications. The present
document provides requirements for Lawful Interception.
Laws of individual nations and regional institutions, and sometimes licensing
and operating conditions, define a need to intercept targeted
telecommunications traffic and related information in communication systems.
Lawful Interception applies in accordance with applicable national or regional
laws and technical regulations.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies Stage 1 Lawful Interception requirements for
3GPP networks and services.
Regional interception requirements can be satisfied by meeting the correct
subset of requirements from the present document. Which CSP services are
subject to Lawful Interception is defined by national regulations.
The presence of a requirement in the present document does not in itself imply
or mandate that a 3GPP operator has an obligation to implement any network
service capability, which is not otherwise required to meet LI obligation
compliance in relation to specific regulated services, offered by that 3GPP
operator. Only those specific requirements and sub-clauses of the present
document which are applicable to specific network and/or service capabilities
implemented in a 3GPP operator\'s network will be considered in scope for that
operator. In all cases, laws and regulations define which requirements are
applicable to 3GPP operators in each country relative to the services offered
by each 3GPP operator.
As such not all requirements in the present document will apply in all
national jurisdictions or to all 3GPP operator deployments (e.g. if an
operator does not offer voice services, then voice LI requirement in the
present document do not apply).
The interception system defined in the present document provides LI based on
specific target identifiers.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**activation/deactivation:** The large time scale action (i.e. on the same
order as subscription lifetimes, that encompass multiple sessions, e.g.
subscribing to "call hold" service) that turns on/off a service or feature for
a user so that it is ready to act or will no longer be available to act. In
the case of lawful interception, this may apply to all or a particular subset
of communications. (See also Invocation).
**Artificial Intelligence:** Artificial Intelligence is typically considered
to be a system that performs some form of reasoning, planning or object
management, using knowledge as well as perceived information that, in the
past, required human intervention. (Definition from ATIS-I-0000068, White
Paper \"Evolution to an Artifical Intelligence Enabled Network\" [8]).
**capture:** The action taken by the CSP to separate and copy the
communications associated with a target identifier.
**Content of Communication (CC):** Information exchanged between two or more
users of a communications service, excluding intercept related information.
This includes information which may, as part of some communications service,
be stored by one user for subsequent retrieval by another.
**context of communication:** Information needed to recreate the state known
in the CSP\'s network of the Target Communication. For example the direction
of initiation on communication (to or from), direction of data flow (to or
from), direction association with the identifiers to and from addresses),
actions taken by the CSP on behalf of the target or identity translations.
**Communication Service Provider (CSP):** The entity that owns or operates the
network that provides a service to a subscriber.
**delivery:** The action taken by the CSP to perform the necessary correlation
and processing of communications associated with a target, and delivering the
result to the LEA.
**de-provisioning:** The action taken by the CSP, that may be in response to
an interception termination request from the LEA, or automatically once the
warrant period has expired, to remove from its network functions the
information and reporting pertaining to the target.
**detection:** The action taken by the CSP to identify communications
associated with a target identifier.
**edge interception:** Interception performed in less secure locations that
could be at customer\'s premises e.g. H(e)NB, ProSe relays.
**group identifier:** A group identity provides a reference to a defined group
of one or more users. The use of this group identity applies to all users in
the group.
**interception:** The actions of Provisioning, Detection, Capture, Delivery,
and De-Provisioning.
**interception product:** The Intercept Related Information (IRI) and/or
Content of Communication (CC) generated as a result of isolating the
target**\'** s communications or identities for the purpose of delivery to the
requesting LEA.
**Intercept Related Information (IRI):** Information or data associated with
communication services involving the target identity, specifically
communication associated information or data (e.g. unsuccessful communication
attempts), service associated information or data, and location information.
**invocation:** The short, intra-session time scale action (i.e. the
application of the hold feature in the middle of a call session) in which a
service or feature is called to act. In the case of lawful interception, this
may apply to all or a particular subset of communications. (See also
Activation).
**Lawful Access Location Services (LALS):** A service provided by a CSP to an
LEA in which action is performed by a CSP to obtain a target\'s location
information by means of Location Services (LCS), and to provide that
information to an LEA.
**Lawful Interception (LI):** Actions taken by the CSP that include:
provisioning the target identity in the network to enable isolation of target
communications (separating it from other users\' communications), duplicating
the communications for the purpose of sending the copy to the LEA, and handing
over the Interception Product to the LEA that served the CSP with the warrant.
An interception is associated with exactly one warrant.
**lawful interception identifiers:** Target identifying details as defined in
ETSI TS 103 280 [5].
**LI delivery latency:** The time between isolation in the Point of
Interception and delivery of the Product of Interception at the LEA at the
agreed point of handover.
**location information:** Information relating to the geographic/ physical or
logical location of a target.
**Mediation and Delivery Function (MDF):** Functions that convert the CSP
internal formats and protocols to the agreed formats and protocols for
handover from the CSP to the LEA.
**party role:** The role of a user identifies whether the user was for example
the initiating party or the addressed party or intermediate addressed party in
a communication.
_**production:** The actions of Detection, Capture, and Delivery._
_**provisioning:** The action taken by the CSP to insert into its network
functions information that identifies the target and the specific
communication services of interest to the LEA, sourced from the LEA provided
warrant._
**target communication:** All communications, communication attempts
(successful or not), and network interactions that originate from, are
directed to, are controlled by, or are associated with, the target\'s
identifiers, equipment, facilities or services, including actions taken by the
network on behalf of the target, that are available in the CSP\'s network.
**target identity:** A network or service identity that uniquely identifies a
target for interception from all other non-targets within one or more CSP
services. One target may have one or several target identities. The target
identity can be a long term subscription based identity, a short term network
identity, a public identity or an internal (private) identity.
**third party:** A resource or entity which is not fully owned and fully
controlled by the CSP.
**warrant:** The formal mechanism to require Lawful Interception from an LEA
served to the CSP on a specific target. Depending on jurisdiction also known
as: intercept request, intercept order, lawful order, court order or judicial
order (in association with supporting legislation).

# 4 Jurisdiction specific Lawful Interception requirements
Lawful Interception requirements are subject to jurisdiction specific
regulations and should be interpreted accordingly.
Requirements called out in jurisdiction specific Lawful Interception
regulatory requirements are supported by the system defined in the present
document.
Lawful Interception requirements often have national requirements specific to
local jurisdictions relating to operational aspects of interception (e.g.,
interception equipment location and interception scope).
# 5 General interception lifecycle and model
## 5.1 Lifecycle
Figure 5.1 depicts the general Lawful Interception lifecycle.
Figure 5.1: Generic Lawful Interception lifecycle
After a LEA Warrant is delivered to the CSP, the interception is provisioned.
In the ACTIVE state, the Lawful Interception system elements _detect_ ,
_capture_ and _deliver_ Interception Product to the LEA (labelled
\"production\" in Figure 5.1). These three production actions occur each time
a targeted communication is identified, and therefore may happen many times
during the lifecycle.
Depending on requirements, once provisioned, the LI system can enter directly
into the ACTIVE state, or enter into the INACTIVE state, in which it still
requires a RESUME transition to enter the ACTIVE state. The \"production\"
activities of _detect_ , _capture_ , and _deliver_ from figure 5.1 happen only
in the ACTIVE state. It is in this ACTIVE state only that Interception Product
is delivered to the requesting LEA.
A transition from INACTIVE to ACTIVE will resume the process from the _detect_
action. Conversely, a transition from ACTIVE to INACTIVE will immediately
suspend delivery to the LEA (i.e., if there are communications that have been
_detect_ ed or _captur_ ed, they will be discarded and not _deliver_ ed to the
LEA).
If provisioning enters the INACTIVE state, the RESUME transition is the
equivalent of a delayed start.
Some jurisdictions may not support the INACTIVE state of the interception. In
such cases, the production actions start directly upon provisioning, and stop
directly upon de-provisioning.
## 5.2 Model
Figure 5.2 depicts the general interception model. Lawful Interception (LI) is
implemented in a 3GPP Communication Service Provider (CSP) network by the
logical elements shown in the figure. Detailed LI architecture and functions
are found in TS 33.127 [3], while delivery details are found in TS 33.128 [4].
The Administration Function (ADMF) provides the CSP\'s administrative
functions for the LI capability, including provisioning and de-provisioning
the Point(s) Of Interception (POI(s)) and the Mediation and Delivery Function
(MDF).
A POI detects and captures the target\'s communications, based on information
provided by the ADMF, passing the Interception Product to the Mediation and
Delivery Function.
The MDF performs any necessary mediation of the Interception Product before
delivering it on to the LEA\'s Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF).
The LEMF is the logical element in the LEA which receives Interception
Product.

# 6 Fundamental requirements
## 6.1 Overview
In the present document some requirements are cumulative in nature, and rely
on implicit compliance with other requirements.
The network shall be able to provide a Lawful Interception capability which
meets the relevant regulatory and operational obligations. In general, this

the target identity is converted when necessary, by the network, to
corresponding identities used in the network.

(required to produce IRI) associated with targeted communications as provided
in the network, in order for the LEA to fully understand the Context of
Communication.

agreed format to the LEA, such that the LEA can fully understand the
Interception Product as provided by the CSP.
\- Lawful: The CSP\'s Lawful Interception capability shall comply with the
relevant obligations, restrictions and reporting regimes in the warrant,
including (but not limited to) period, duration, locality, services.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Guidance on regulatory and capability Issues
# A.1 Introduction
This annex contains guidance for regulatory capability issues not being formal
LI requirements.
# A.2 Service specific obligations
In general, LI obligations are determined by the service being provided,
regardless of how that service is implemented. For example, if a 3GPP network
operator\'s voice service replaces a legacy CS voice service, or is equivalent
to a CS voice service, then the same LI obligations as for the CS voice (e.g.
providing interception capability for roamers) apply. This also applies to new
3GPP networks without legacy CS voice service.
# A.3 Roaming obligations clarification
A visited network is generally not required to be able to intercept
supplementary services (e.g. voicemail, home network based call forwarding) or
3rd party services not directly provided by the visited network. However, if
such a service is observable in the visited network, national regulation may
specify a minimum set of LI requirements for that service.
# A.4 Delivery
The availability and reliability of the near-real-time transport mechanism of
the LI data from the CSP to the LEA have to be addressed in bilateral
agreement.
A mechanism to reduce Interception Product volume based on information
received from the LEA (e.g. exclusion of particular flows such as movies) may
be bilaterally agreed.
# A.5 Quality
The Quality of Service (QoS), capacity, and integrity of the delivered IRI and
CC need to be specified by a bilateral agreement between the CSP and the LEA.
In addition it is recommended to implement jurisdiction-appropriate auditing
procedures.
# A.6 Security
It is recommended to make risks assessment and management on LI system and LI
deployment environment, based on based on industry best practise security and
risk assessment techniques (e.g., ISO/IEC 27000 [6] family or TVRA of ETSI
[7]) in order to reduce risks on such LI system to the minimum possible. Such
assessment have to be made regularly and at any new major change in terms of
services or networks function.
LI system are recommended to be securely protected and any attack attempts
should be logged. The accesses to any target list or LI functions, or to LI
administrative system, are recommended to be isolated from the other network
management and supervision. Secured access based control or ID based access
control to LI system is recommended.
By bilateral agreement the security of the negotiated delivery mechanism from
the CSP to the LEA is to be specified.
The CSP is recommended to ensure the highest level of security of LI system if
only part of the infrastructure (physical and virtual) is owned and/or managed
by the CSP. This for example applies if a CSP does not manage all slices and
to the degree of control of ownership is with partners or third parties.
For NFV compliance with NFV security ref Sec012 reference document [2] is
necessary to achieve compliance with the majority of requirements in the
present document but it is by no means sufficient. Consequently, the CSP is to
complement its LI implementation with sound operational security policies,
processes, and procedures.
A choice should be considered for security optimised and/or LI functionality
optimised implementations in situations where functionality for LI functions
might be required at the edge (periphery) of the network (e.g. mission
critical services, ProSE relays, (e)NB, H(e)NB, gNB).
# A.7 Mission Critical (MC)
Where a mission critical service is provided for commercial service purposes,
full LI compliance may apply.
