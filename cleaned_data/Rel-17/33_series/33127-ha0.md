# Introduction
The present document has been produced by the 3GPP TSG SA to standardise
Lawful Interception of telecommunications. The present document specifies the
architecture and functions required to support Lawful Interception in 3GPP
networks. Lawful Interception shall always be done in accordance with the
applicable national or regional laws and technical regulations. Such national
laws and regulations define the extent to which functional capabilities in the
present document are applicable in specific jurisdictions.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies both the architectural and functional system
requirements for Lawful Interception (LI) in 3GPP networks. The present
document provides an LI architecture supporting both network layer based and
service layer based Interception.
National regulations determine the specific set of LI functional capabilities
that are applicable to a specific 3GPP operator deployment.

# 4 Requirements realisation
The LI architecture set out in the present document is designed to allow CSP
deployments to meet the set of LI requirements described in TS 33.126 [3] that
are determined to be applicable by the relevant national regulation for that
deployment. For more details on the relationship between LI requirements and
national legislation, see TS 33.126 [3] clause 4.
A CSP may deploy different network technologies or services considered in the
present document. A CSP should consider each of these network technologies or
services separately with respect to the present document, bearing in mind that
a different subset of LI requirements may apply according to relevant national
legislation, and that a warrant may require the CSP to intercept multiple
network technologies or services.
# 5 Functional architecture
## 5.1 General
The following clauses describe the high-level functional architecture for LI
for 3GPP-defined services and network technologies. It describes the
architectural elements necessary for LI, their roles and responsibilities, and
the interfaces and interactions between them.
Clauses 6 and 7 of the present document describe how the LI for various 3GPP-
defined network technologies and services are realised within the generic LI
architecture, including associations of LI architectural elements with the
network functions involved.
Not all LI architectural elements and interfaces are used in all network
technologies and services.
## 5.2 High-level generic LI architecture
The overall conceptual view of LI architecture is shown in figure 5.2-1 below.
Figure 5.2-1: A high-level generic view of LI architecture
The functional entities of the architecture are described in more detail in
clause 5.3 below. Details of the specific interfaces between these entities
are described in clause 5.4.
## 5.3 Functional entities
### 5.3.1 Law Enforcement Agency (LEA)
In general the LEA is responsible for submitting the warrant to the CSPs,
although in some countries the warrant may be provided by a different legal
entity (e.g. judiciary).
### 5.3.2 Point of Interception (POI)
#### 5.3.2.1 General
The **Point of Interception (POI)** detects the target communication, derives
the intercept related information or communications content from the target
communications and delivers the POI output as xIRI to the MDF2 or as xCC to
the MDF3. The output of a POI is determined by the type of the NF associated
with the POI. A POI may be embedded within a Network Function (NF) or separate
from a NF with which it is associated.
Multiple POIs may have to be involved in executing a warrant.
#### 5.3.2.2 Directly provisioned and triggered POIs
POIs are divided into two categories:
\- Directly provisioned POIs are provisioned by the LIPF.
\- Triggered POIs are triggered by a Triggering Function (TF) (see clause
5.3.3).
The directly provisioned POIs detect the target\'s communications that need to
be intercepted, and then derive the intercept related information or
communication contents from that target communications depending on the POI
type (see clause 5.3.2.3). The triggered POIs detect the target communications
based on the trigger received from an associated Triggering Function and then
derives the intercept related information or communication contents of target
communications depending on the POI type (see clause 5.3.2.3).
#### 5.3.2.3 IRI-POIs and CC-POIs
POIs are divided into two types for each category based on the type of data
they send to the MDF (see clause 5.3.4):
\- IRI-POI delivers xIRI to the MDF2.
\- CC-POI delivers xCC to the MDF3.
Both IRI-POIs and CC-POIs are either directly provisioned or triggered (see
clause 5.3.2.2).
In the present document, an xIRI is identified with the event that has caused
its generation within the IRI-POI.
#### 5.3.2.4 Failure handling
In case a network procedure involving the target UE and requiring the
generation of an xIRI fails, the IRI-POI shall be able to report the failure
reason available from the involved network protocol.
### 5.3.3 Triggering Function
The **Triggering Function (TF)** is provisioned by the LIPF and is responsible
for triggering triggered POIs in response to network and service events
matching the criteria provisioned by the LIPF. The Triggering Function detects
the target communications and sends a trigger to the associated triggered POI.
As a part of this triggering, the Triggering Function shall send all necessary
interception rules (i.e. rules that allow the POIs to detect the target
communications), forwarding rules (i.e. MDF2, MDF3 address), target identity,
and the correlation information.
A Triggering Function may interact with other POIs to obtain correlation
information. Details of this interface are not specified by the present
document.
The Triggering Function that triggers CC-POI is referred to as a CC-TF and the
Triggering Function that triggers an IRI-POI is referred to as IRI-TF.
### 5.3.4 Mediation and Delivery Function (MDF)
The **Mediation and Delivery Function (MDF)** delivers the Interception
Product to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF).
Two variations of MDF are defined: MDF2 and MDF3.
MDF2 generates the IRI messages from the xIRI and sends them to one or more
LEMFs. The MDF3 generates the CC from the xCC and delivers it to one or more
intercepting LEMFs. An overview of this is shown in figure 5.3-2 below.
Figure 5.3-2: MDF2 and MDF3
The MDF2 and MDF3 are provisioned by the LIPF with the intercept information
necessary to deliver the IRI and/or CC to one or more LEMFs.
The LI_MDF interface between MDF2 and MDF3 (shown in figure 5.3-2) allows the
MDF3 and MDF2 to exchange information between the two.
### 5.3.5 Administration Function (ADMF)
#### 5.3.5.1 General
The Administration Function (ADMF) provides the CSP\'s administrative and
management functions for the LI capability. This includes overall
responsibility for the provisioning/activating, modifying, and de-
activating/de-provisioning the Point(s) Of Interception (POI), Triggering
Functions (TF), and the Mediation and Delivery Functions (MDF). The ADMF is
also responsible managing the Identifier Event Functions (IEF) and Identifier
Caching Function (ICF).
The ADMF includes four logical sub-functions:
\- Lawful Interception Control Function (LICF).
\- Lawful Interception Provisioning Function (LIPF).
\- Identifier Query Function (IQF).
\- Certificate Authority (CA).
Within one ADMF there is one LICF, one IQF and at least one, but possibly
multiple LIPFs.
The LICF and LIPF communicate via the internal LI_ADMF interface, the details
of which are outside the scope of the present document.
The ADMF contains the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) for all LI components
(POIs, MDFs etc.). Further details are defined in clause 8.3.
The IQF is used for handling identifier association requests. Further details
are defined in clause 5.7.
NOTE: It is assumed that the LICF and IQF are always implemented on dedicated
LI infrastructure which is only accessible to CSP personnel explicitly
authorised to handle LI. However, the LIPF is assumed in some scenarios (e.g.
virtualisation) to be implemented within the main CSP network infrastructure
environment, although still only accessible to LI authorised CSP personnel.
For further details on the roles and responsibilities of the ADMF refer to
Annex B.
#### 5.3.5.2 LICF
The LICF controls the management of the end-to-end life cycle of a warrant.
The LICF contains the master record of all sensitive information and LI
configuration data. The LICF is ultimately responsible for all decisions
within the overall LI system. The LICF, via the LIPF acting as its proxy is
responsible for auditing other LI components (POIs, MDFs etc.). The LICF is
responsible for communication with administrative LEA systems (LI_HI1).
The LICF provides the intercept information derived from the warrant for
provisioning at the POI, TF, MDF2 and MDF3.With the exception of the
communication with the LEA, all other communication between the LICF and any
other entities shall be proxied by the LIPF.
The LICF also maintains and authorises the master list of POIs, IEFs, ICF, TFs
and MDFs. In dynamic networks the LIPF is responsible for providing the LICF
with any necessary updates to the POI, TF, IEF, ICF and MDF list.
The LICF is responsible for management and audit of the IEF(s) and ICF proxied
by the LIPF.
The LICF shall support activating and deactivating of IEF identifier
association reporting capabilities on a per IEF basis proxied by the LIPF.
The LICF shall provide the IQF with information relating to IEFs and ICF
necessary for the IQF to handle queries from the LEA and obtain answers to
such queries.
If the LICF deactivates event record reporting to an IEF, the LICF shall also
instruct the ICF to immediately delete all cached identifier associations
which the ICF had received from that IEF.
The LICF shall ensure that the ICF is always activated before IEFs and de-
activated after IEFs to ensure that data loss does not occur due to an IEF
sending events before an ICF is configured to receive them.
#### 5.3.5.3 LIPF
The LIPF provisions all the applicable POIs, TFs and MDFs.
The role of the LIPF varies depending on implementation of network functions
and of the ADMF itself (e.g. virtual or non-virtual).
In its simplest form, the LIPF is the secure proxy used by the LICF to
communicate with POIs, TFs, MDFs or other infrastructure required to operate
LI within the CSP network. In this scenario the LIPF does not store target
information and simply routes LI_X1 messages from and to the LICF.
In scenarios where the ADMF is required to take an active role in POI
triggering, the LIPF is responsible for receiving triggering information (e.g.
from an IRI-TF) and forwarding the trigger to the appropriate POI.
For directly provisioned POIs, TFs and MDFs, the LIPF will forward all LI
administration instructions from the LICF to the intended destination POI, TF
or MDF.
In SBA as defined in TS 23.501 [2] or virtualised deployments, the LIPF is
responsible for identifying changes to NFs, POIs, and TFs and MDFs through
interaction with the SIRF or underlying virtualisation infrastructure. The
LIPF shall notify the LICF of changes affecting the number of active NFs/POIs
and TFs or other information which the LICF requires to maintain the master
POI/TF and MDF list.
While the LIPF is assumed to be stateful with respect to dynamic interceptions
it is managing, it shall not hold the full static target or other historic LI
data. If the LIPF is deployed in a virtualised environment, the LIPF shall not
store LI information in persistent storage and shall rely on the LICF to
manage re-synchronisation in the case of LIPF restart.
#### 5.3.5.4 IQF
The IQF is the function responsible for receiving and responding to dedicated
LEA real-time queries for identifier associations. Further details of the IQF
are defined in clause 5.7.2.1.
#### 5.3.5.5 LI Function Selection
The LICF and LIPF shall support selective management and provisioning of
groups of POIs, TFs and IEFs, based on the warrant parameters (e.g., service
scope, target identities), the target UE type and profile (e.g. a smartphone,
a CIoT device) and the CSP\'s network deployment architecture and services
implementation (e.g. Slicing, MEC and URLLC enablers, etc.), with the purpose
of optimizing the LI system operation and avoiding its over-provisioning. This
selective management and provisioning shall apply independently of
architectural alternatives in clause 8.2.
The selective management and provisioning of LI functions may be supported by
ADMF's GUI configuration capabilities, as well as by ADMF\'s ability to obtain
and use the CSP network data to drive its provisioning decisions.
The following are examples of the ADMF's configuration capabilities:
\- Single or multiple POIs or TFs or IEFs.
\- Groups of one or more POIs, TFs, and IEFs of a specific parent NF type.
\- POIs, TFs, and IEFs associated with NFs in a specific slice.
\- POIs, TFs, and IEFs independently where they are contained in the same
parent NF.
\- Enabling only specific services or features of POIs (individually and in
groups).
Selective provisioning shall be supported on a per warrant basis.
NOTE: The criteria by which the CSP decides which POIs, IEFs and TFs to select
is outside the scope of the present document except where the ADMF is able to
make selections using information provided by the SIRF (e.g. all POIs and TFs
in a slice).
### 5.3.6 System Information Retrieval Function (SIRF)
The **System Information Retrieval Function (SIRF)** is responsible for
providing the LIPF with the system related information for NFs that are known
by the SIRF (e.g. service topology). The information provided shall allow the
LIPF/LICF to perform the necessary operations to establish and maintain
interception of the target service (e.g. provisioning POIs, TFs and MDFs over
LI_X1). LIPF/LICF knowledge of POI, TF and MDF existence is provided directly
by interactions between the LIPF/LICF and the underlying CSP management
systems that instantiate NFs (as defined in clause 5.5). The NRF/SIRF are not
involved in this step of NF/POI or MDF instantiation.
While the LIPF is responsible for interactions with the SIRF, the LIPF will
forward applicable information to the LICF. Details of LIPF vs LICF
responsibilities in managing and maintaining interception are defined in
clause 5.3.2.
As described in clause 5.6 of the present document, the OSS/BSS is responsible
for managing the number of NFs within the network including the NF within
which the SIRF is implemented. Therefore, the SIRF is not responsible for
notifying the LIPF that a new NF, POI, TF or MDF has been instantiated (in
virtualised networks) or connected to the network using manual processes
(legacy networks). The LIPF is notified of these events directly by the
relevant CSP management system as described in clause 5.6, prior to any
interaction with the SIRF. When the SIRF subsequently notifies the LIPF that,
for example an NF associated with a POI has now been registered with the SIRF,
the LIPF knows that an NF and POI which it has already configured for LI usage
is ready for live user traffic service.
NOTE: The SIRF will only become aware of the existence of NFs after they are
commissioned for use within the network and are ready for service usage (NFs
are authorised, instantiated and configured for network connectivity before
the SIRF will become aware of them). By this stage the NF may be only several
milli-seconds away from live user traffic handling. This is too late to check
whether the LI components are functional and therefore the SIRF is not
involved in NF instantiation reporting to the LIPF.
In virtualised networks where selective per POI provisioning of target
identifiers is not required, or only limited network static network slicing is
in use, implementation of the SIRF is not required to allow the LIPF and LICF
to meet LI requirements.

interfaces
### 5.4.2 Interface LI_SI
LI_SI is an interface between the SIRF and LIPF. SIRF uses this interface to
provide the system information to the LIPF. The LIPF may request the SIRF for
such information before sending the intercept provisioning information to the
POIs. The SIRF may also notify the LIPF whenever the status of a system
function changes (e.g. removed from service, migrating to another location,
etc.).
### 5.4.3 Interface LI_HI1
LI_HI1 is used to send warrant and other interception request information from
the LEA to the CSP. This interface may be electronic or may be an offline
manual process depending on national warranty processes.
The following are some of the information elements sent over this interface:
\- Target identifier: used to identify the communications to be intercepted.
\- Type of intercept: used to indicate whether IRI only, CC only, or both IRI
and CC, is to be delivered to the LEMF.

format to LEMFs.
LI_X1 interfaces shall support the use of ETSI TS 103 221-1 [8] for transport
of X1 messages / information. However, the requirements specified in the
present document shall apply regardless of generic default options specified
in TS 103 221-1 [8].

\- Target identifier.
\- Time stamp.
\- Correlation information.
\- User plane packets.
### 5.4.7 Interface LI_T
#### 5.4.7.1 General
The LI_T interface is used to pass the triggering information from the
Triggering Function to the POI. Depending on the POI type, two types of LI_T
are defined:
\- LI_T2.
\- LI_T3.

been provisioned as expected. This capability is mandatory to support but
optional to use (subject to relevant national agreement) at both MDF2 and
MDF3.
NOTE: It is FFS if/how LI_HI4 interface could be used to report network
topology information.
#### 5.4.10.2 LI operation notification
The MDF2 and MDF3 shall support reporting to the LEMF changes to provisioning,
including:
\- Activation of LI.
\- Modification of active LI.
\- Deactivation of LI.
NOTE: A mechanism may be needed at the CSP to prevent duplicate notifications
being raised in the case of LI being provisioned across multiple MDFs. Such a
mechanism is for FFS.
#### 5.4.10.3 Contents of the notification
Each notification shall include at least the following:
\- The type of notification (e.g. activation, deactivation).
\- Relevant related information (LIID, time of change).
### 5.4.11 Interface LI_ADMF

transport of XEM1 messages / information. However, the requirements specified
in the present document shall apply regardless of generic default options
specified in [8].
## 5.5 LI service discovery
In SBA as defined in TS 23.501 [2] the NRF is a central repository of
discoverable NFs. For NFs to be discoverable, they need to have been
previously instantiated and undergone a degree of configuration (function
identity allocated, IP addresses, certificates, network connectivity to NRF,
etc.).
LI functions (e.g. ADMF, POIs and MDFs) exist within a separate security
domain to the main network NF to which they are embedded. Furthermore, as with
legacy networks, LI functions associated with NFs shall be configured and
tested before the associated NF is allowed to enter active network user
service (i.e. LI shall be configured and tested before an NF can handle live
user traffic).
In the present document, all LI functions have dedicated LI_X interfaces and
discovery of LI functions by the LIPF shall happen as part of the NF / LI
function instantiation phase. POIs, TFs and MDFs shall not be subject to or
within the scope of NRF service discovery as defined in TS 23.501 [2]. The
SIRF is used to provide the LIPF with NF discovery information which shall be
used to identify which NFs are applicable to intercept specific user sessions,
as described in clause 5.3.6. However, the SIRF is not involved directly in LI
service discovery.
The SIRF may be used to inform the LIPF that an NF has been registered /
deregistered with the NRF and is now ready for use in a network user service.
The LIPF is assumed to already have knowledge of which POIs and TFs are
associated with which NFs.
POIs, TFs and MDFs may be discovered in virtualised deployments using the
approach described in clause 5.6. The exact mechanisms for achieving this are
out of scope of the present document.
## 5.6 LI in a virtualised environment
### 5.6.1 General
Virtualisation is one of the 3GPP network deployment options for NFs
containing LI functions as described in the present document. In virtualised
deployments, many of the initial deployment and configuration actions
performed manually in non-virtualised deployments need to be automated and
occur in near real-time. This clause outlines the basic architecture
enhancements to support virtualised LI in 3GPP networks. Security aspects
relating to virtualisation are described in clause 8.
The architecture enhancements in this clause are intended to apply to any
virtualised 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G scenario including IMS that needs to support LI.
Where legacy network functions defined in TS 33.107 [11] are virtualised, the
architecture in figure 5.6-1 shall be applied, with legacy TS 33.107 [11]
reference points and functional elements substituted for their equivalent in
the present document (e.g. POI is equivalent to ICE and LI_X2 is equivalent to
X2 in TS 33.107 [11]).
### 5.6.2 Virtualised deployment architecture
Figure 5.6-1 shows the necessary extensions to the basic LI architecture
described in clause 5.2 required to support real-time deployment of
virtualised LI functions. Figure 5.6-1 is a simplified version of the virtual
LI function deployment procedures.
Figure 5.6-1: Simplified virtualised LI system with provisioning
infrastructure for a direct provisioned POI
Figure 5.6-1 shows the LI NFV controller and NFV Management and Orchestration
functions (MANO), together with two logical interfaces:
\- LI_NO: This interface allows to exchange correlation and notification
information between the LI application/service and NFV layer about related VNF
and VNFC lifecycle management; it also allows to configure optional virtual
deployment parameters. In addition, in case of LI functions not instantiated
by OSS/BSS (see clause 5.6.3.1.6 of the present document) this interface shall
support LI function instantiation requests from the ADMF.
\- LI_MANO: This interface allows to notify the LI NFV controller about
VNF/VNFC lifecycle management and enforce virtual deployment LI security
policy.
These two interfaces are assumed to be already setup between the involved
functional entities via a mutual authenticated and encrypted dedicated
connection.
The procedures in clause 5.6.3 assume that the LIPF, LICF and NFV LI
Controller already exist before creation of any other LI functions.
The OSS/BSS is responsible for controlling the number of 3GPP VNFs and service
chains within the network. The OSS/BSS instructs NFV MANO to instantiate,
scale or terminate one or more VNFs. NFV MANO is also able to instantiate and
terminate VNF sub-components (VNFCs) dynamically without input from the
OSS/BSS in order to maintain performance and resilience requirements. This is
especially likely in container-based implementations.
To ensure that all LI related aspects, if applicable, are considered within
that VNF, NFV MANO notifies the LI NFV Controller about the VNF and VNFC
instantiation, scaling and termination. In case where a VNF, about to be
instantiated, is expected to have LI specific functionalities such as POI, TF
or MDF, the LI NFV controller notifies the LIPF about those LI specific
functionalities within the VNF. The LIPF would forward that notification to
the LICF, which in turn, validate/verify/authorize (via LIPF, of course) that
POI/TF/MDF for LI over LI_X0. If the VNF does not contain an LI function then
the LI NFV Controller may still notify the LIPF/LICF.
LI NFV Controller shall be configurable to apply default LI policy and
configuration to LI VNFCs without explicit authorisation from the LIPF/LICF,
depending on network performance and LI security requirements. The LI NFV
Controller shall be able to apply policy on a per instantiation basis or apply
a static configuration policy to NFV MANO, which NFV MANO is able to use to
automatically instantiate LI components using this default configuration.
In most deployments some default LI configuration information will need to be
provided as part of the VNF image packages and package descriptor files. Such
LI information needs to be adequately protected within NFV MANO and software
catalogues.
Where explicit authorisation of LI components is required, the LIPF would
notifies the LI NFV Controller that the LI specific functions are
authorized/verified and the LI NFV Controller notifies NFV MANO.
NOTE: In figure 5.6.1, LI_MANO is shown as a combined representation of the up
to three separate NFV MANO interfaces provided by ETSI GS NFV IFA 026 [20].
Since the exact number of interfaces required depends on the vendor
implementation of the NFVI / NFV MANO and whether a combined single NFVO
interface is supported by NFV MANO, the present document treats this a single
logical interface labelled as LI_MANO for 3GPP LI purposes.
### 5.6.3 LI function instantiation and lifecycle management procedures
#### 5.6.3.1 Controller virtualisation layer and MANO procedures
##### 5.6.3.1.1 Responsibilities
The 5G NRF is not involved in the discovery of LI functions, as described in
clause 5.3.6. NFs containing LI functions shall only be discoverable by the
NRF / SIRF once all LI initialisation steps in this clause have been completed
and the OSS/BSS/ MANO informed that LI operation is ready. The process by
which the NRF / SIRF is notified by the OSS/BSS/MANO is out of scope of the
present document.
##### 5.6.3.1.2 General procedures
When the 3GPP network OSS/BSS makes a request to NFV MANO to instantiate,
modify or terminate a 3GPP NF, NFV MANO shall notify the LI NFV Controller of
the request over LI_MANO using procedures as described in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 026
[20] or equivalent. The NFV LI Controller shall be able to send all applicable
NF changes to the LIPF over LI_NO, so that the LICF is able to maintain an
understanding of network topology. In 5G, the LICF in the ADMF (via the LIPF)
also maintains understanding of active use of NF via the NRF / SIRF.
In addition, NFV MANO is required to send notifications of non-OSS/BSS
triggered (e.g. NFV MANO automated VNF relocation, or software image update)
as described in ETSI GS NFV IFA 026 [20]. The LI NFV Controller shall also be
able to provide applicable notifications to the LICF in the ADMF (via the
LIPF) of such changes.
NOTE: The precise list of information required for the ADMF to maintain
understanding of network topology is implementation specific and therefore
outside the scope of the present document.
In deployments where the implementation supports data centre / location
verification for NFs being instantiated or modified, subject to operator
policy the LI NFV Controller shall not allow instantiation or modification of
LI functions or associated NFs which do not comply with LI location
constraints set by the LICF in the ADMF (via the LIPF).
##### 5.6.3.1.3 Instantiation
Where an NF being instantiated contains one or more LI functions (e.g. POI,
TF, MDF) the LI NFV Controller shall handle any necessary steps to allow the
LI functions to be instantiated by NFV MANO and the LI functions to be added
to the LI environment, so that initial contact between the LI functions and
the LIPF in the ADMF can be established. The LI NFV Controller shall provide
details of the new LI functions to the LICF in the ADMF (via the LIPF),
including the identity of the new LI functions, so that the LICF is aware of
the existence of the LI functions.
In deployments where ADMF (LICF) signing of LI function software images has
been implemented, the LI NFV Controller shall provide the signatures to the
LICF in the ADMF (via the LIPF) for verification and shall only authorise NFV
MANO to continue instantiation of the LI function if the LICF has successfully
verified the signatures.
NOTE: Once this instantiation step is completed an LI function is considered
ready for configuration by the ADMF (LIPF) but is not ready to become a live
LI function.
##### 5.6.3.1.4 Modification
When an NF containing LI functions is being modified (e.g. scaled or
relocated) the LI NFV Controller shall manage the necessary interactions with
NFV MANO (using the procedures in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 026 [20] or equivalent) to
allow the LI functions to also be modified in alignment with changes to their
parent NF. The LI NFV Controller shall notify the LICF in the ADMF via the
LIPF over LI_NO, of the subsequent modifications. Where the modifications
result in a new LI function being instantiated (e.g. where a scale up exceeds
the existing capabilities of the existing LI functions and a new VNFC is
instantiated), the LI NFV Controller shall notify the LICF about the existence
of the new LI function and indicate to which existing NF the new LI function
is associated.
##### 5.6.3.1.5 Termination
When an NF containing LI functions is terminated, the LI NFV Controller shall
manage the necessary interactions with NFV MANO (using the procedures in ETSI
GS NFV IFA 026 [20] or equivalent) and notify the LICF via the LIPF that the
LI functions have been removed from the system. The LICF in the ADMF shall
ensure that certificates associated with those LI functions are appropriately
revoked.
##### 5.6.3.1.6 Direct instantiation of LI Functions by ADMF
Procedures in clauses 5.6.3.1.3, 5.6.3.1.4 and 5.6.3.1.5 are based on the
OSS/BSS being responsible for creating all LI functions as part of normal
network operations (e.g. LI functions are embedded VNFC within a VNFs or are
instantiated as part of network service descriptors where a whole slice or
large set of VNFs are instantiated together as part of a complete network
service).
In some scenarios, the ADMF needs to create specific virtualised LI functions
(e.g. MDF) within the NFVI used to host other operator NFs but for security
reasons requires that the OSS/BSS does not manage or have knowledge of these.
In this scenario, the LICF, instructs the LI NFV Controller via LIPF over
LI_NO to request NFV MANO via LI_MANO to instantiate an LI specific image.
This LI VNF may either be inserted as part of an existing network service
chain or create a new LI specific service chain.
In such scenarios, the ADMF shall play the role of the OSS/BSS and the LI_NO
interface shall support the related operations; the LIPF should implement the
equivalent logic of OSS/BSS for these operations.
NOTE: It is assumed that any required LI VNF or VNFC images are available
within NFV MANO image software catalogue and the images are not sent over the
LI_NO or LI_MANO interfaces.
#### 5.6.3.2 LI_X0 procedures
Only once an LI function has been instantiated and the LIPF in the ADMF
informed of that NF\'s existence, can that NF be managed by the LIPF in the
ADMF over LI_X0. Such notification is achieved as described in clause 5.6.3.1
over LI_NO and LI_MANO and occurs prior to any SIRF/NRF (or equivalent) NF
discovery processes.
The LI_X0 interface is used to manage LI functions after instantiation such
they are made ready for LI use and subsequent provisioning over LI_X1.
After a VNF is instantiated (e.g. using the procedures in ETSI GR NFV-SEC 011
[10] and ETSI NFV-IFA 026 [20] or equivalent), it is necessary to
automatically configure the LI functions (e.g. POI, TF, MDF) before use (i.e.
to initialise it to a state where it can accept LI_X1 messages). To achieve
this the LI Function shall after instantiation and initial network
configuration by NFV MANO (e.g. allocation of network IP address and FQDN)
contact the LIPF over the LI_X0 interface and LIPF will notify the LICF that a
new potential LI function has contacted the LIPF. The LIPF shall only accept
incoming connections from new LI functions that have previously been notified
to the LIPF/LICF by the LI NFV controller over LI_NO. The LI_NO interface
shall carry information to allow the LIPF to associate a VNF instance with the
LI application instance running in it.
The LICF in the ADMF, through the LIPF, shall verify the authenticity of the
LI function over LI_X0 in order to verify that the new LI function has been
instantiated from a valid software image. If the LI function software image
has been partly encrypted as described in ETSI GR NFV-SEC 011 [10], then once
the LICF has verified the integrity of the LI function it shall provide any
necessary keys to the LIPF to decrypt the LI function to complete
instantiation of that LI function.
Once a trust relationship has been established between the LICF and new LI
function, the LIPF shall issue the LI function with an LI identity (e.g. POI
CSCF number 42 or LI System FQDN) and provide the other necessary certificates
and configuration information to allow the new LI function to be configured
for LI use on LI_X1. The LICF is responsible for providing necessary
information and policy rules necessary for the LIPF to perform configuration
of LI functions over LI_X0. For the purposes of instantiation IEFs and ICF
follow the same instantiation flow as POIs except that the LIPF has a more
limited role in managing these functions after instantiation over LI_XEM1
compared to POIs as neither of these types of LI functions are subject to LI
provisioning.
In the case of triggered POIs which are not directly provisioned by the LIPF
in the ADMF over LI_X1, the LIPF is still responsible for LI_X0 configuration
of the POI including identity manage and all necessary identity /
communication certificates in order to allow the POIs and TF to communicate
over LI_X1, LI_T2 and LI_T3. The same applies to virtualised MDFs or CC-PAG.
Once an LI function directly associated with or embedded in an NF has been
made fully ready for provisioning over LI_X1 using LI_X0, the LICF in the ADMF
via the LIPF shall notify the LI NFV Controller that the LI function is ready
for service and NFV MANO may advise the OSS/BSS that the NF associated with
the LI functions is ready for service and discovery by the NRF. For MDFs, CC-
PAGs, or non-embedded POIs the LICF may still need to provide a ready for
service indication to NFV MANO / OSS / BSS depending on the implementation
scenario.
NOTE: The full procedure for notifying the OSS/BSS that LI is ready and that
the NF can be notified to the NRF (in the case of 5G SBA) is out of scope of
the present document and is left to operator deployment choice.
During normal system operation LI_X0 shall be used by the LIPF in the ADMF to
maintain the LI function throughout the LI function's lifecycle, except as a
result of scaling or other changes applied by NFV MANO (such changes are first
managed by the NFV LI Controller through LI_NO and LI_MANO and any necessary
LI_X1/LI_X2/LI_X3 level re-configuration then applied over LI_X0). In-life
certificate updates, identity changes, LI_X1/2/3 credential changes and other
similar configuration changes shall be supported by both the LIPF in the ADMF
and LI functions over LI_X0.
Figure 5.6-2 shows an example of what the procedures described in this clause
look like when instantiating a new NF and associated LI functions.

instantiation procedures
### 5.6.3.3 Exception Procedures
If during normal LI system operation the ADMF (LIPF or LICF) detects or is
informed of abnormal LI function behaviour, then subject to operator policy
the LICF in the ADMF via the LIPF shall be able via the LI NFV Controller over
LI_NO and LI_MANO to request immediate termination or quarantine of the LI
function to NFV MANO as defined in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 026 [20]. For this purpose,
the LI NFV Controller acts as a Semi-Active SM as described in ETSI GS NFV-IFA
026 [20].
If during normal operation the LICF in the ADMF via the LIPF is notified of a
NF modification or instantiation event which does not comply with operator LI
policy (e.g. NF location is not within allowed locations or LI functionality
is not authorised for a given deployment scenario) the LICF via the LIPF shall
be able to deny NFV MANO and the OSS/BSS authorisation to complete the system
change. The ADMF shall be able to delegate responsibility for real-time
termination handling to the NFV LI Controller. The NFV LI Controller shall be
responsible for reporting detected events and subsequent actions taken by LI
NFV Controller and NFV MANO to the LICF via the LIPF over LI_NO.
## 5.7 Identifier association and reporting
### 5.7.1 General
3GPP networks use temporary identifiers in place of permanent identifiers to
ensure that identities which are visible on exposed interfaces (e.g. RAN)
cannot be used to track or degrade the privacy of a subscriber. For LI
purposes, CSPs are required to be able to provide real-time association
between temporary and permanent identifiers where the use of such identifier
associations impact the ability of the LEA to uniquely identify the UE,
subscriber or true permanent identifiers associated with a service.
The present document defines two sets of capabilities which allow CSPs to
report such association to LEAs:
\- Real-time reporting of associations as observed by POIs as part of network
access, target communications and service usage.
\- Dedicated real-time query, lookup and reporting of identifier associations.
For real-time reporting based on POI observation, associations are reported
through a combination of dedicated event records sent from the POI to the MDF
over LI_X2 and through inclusion of specific parameters in other
communications service records reported over LI_X2.
For dedicated query, lookup and reporting, figure 5.7-1 shows the high-level
architecture used to support identifier association query and response
requirements. The Identifier Event Function (IEF) provides the Identifier
Caching Function (ICF) with the events necessary to answer the identifier
association queries from the IQF. LEAs are able to issue real-time queries to
the Identifier Query Function (IQF), which in turn queries the ICF.
Figure 5.7-1 High-level identifier retrieval via Query and Response.
The IQF and ICF shall support the following query types:
\- Single query and response.
\- Single query and response followed by triggered real-time reporting of any
subsequent changes reported to the ICF (see NOTE 2).
Within the present document, only a single ICF for all IEFs is supported.
Within the present document, interfaces and generic functionality for
dedicated identifier query and response are defined in this clause, while
specific instances of the IEFs are defined within clause 6 and the ICF in
clause 7.
For each request over LI_HIQR, the LEA shall provide a legal
warrant/authorisation unique identifier. In addition, depending on the
scenario, the LEA needs to provide, the observed identity (temporary or
permanent), along with the serving cell identity, tracking area identifier,
and time of observation by LEA.
The IQF shall obtain in real-time the identifier associations which match the
LEA query from the ICF and provide a response to the LEA over LI_HIQR.
In some cases, it may not be possible to establish a single unique identifier
association given the information provided by the LEA. IQF handling in such a
scenario is subject to the authorisation in the warrant and is outside the
scope of the present document.
NOTE 1: If the LEA is unable to provide the tracking area associated with an
observed temporary identifier this may prevent the CSP from uniquely
associating the identifier to the correct UE.
NOTE 2: Single query and response followed by triggered real-time reporting of
any subsequent changes detected by the IEF is only applicable to queries based
on a permanent identifier where the changes reported are new temporary
identifiers to which that permanent identifier has been associated.
NOTE 3: The terms identifier and identity are used interchangeably in clause
5.7. This also applies to the naming of functions like IQF.
### 5.7.2 Functional entities
#### 5.7.2.1 Identity Query Function (IQF)
The IQF is the function responsible for receiving and responding to dedicated
LEA real-time queries for identifier associations. The IQF is a sub-function
of the ADMF.
On receiving a valid query, the IQF shall query the ICF in order to obtain the
required mapped identities. The IQF shall be able to support both association
from permanent identifiers to temporary identifiers and from temporary
identifiers to permanent identifiers.
NOTE 1: Only queries based on applicable subscription permanent identifiers or
associated temporary identifiers are supported by the present document.
Queries based on ME hardware identifiers or communications services
identifiers (e.g. E.164 numbers) are not supported by the IQF.
NOTE 2: A specific query response to the LEA may require both permanent and
temporary identifiers to be returned in a single response for a given query.
For example, if an LEA queries using a temporary identifier, then it may be
necessary to respond with a permanent identifier, plus other associated
temporary identifiers in order to fulfil the query.
The IQF shall only support queries that are received from the LEA within the
caching duration and shall reject any queries from the LEA which fall outside
those time limits.
NOTE 3: It may not always be possible for the CSP to provide an answer due to
association information no longer being available in the network. The IQF
shall provide support for multiple LEA scenarios. The IQF shall be able to
support different query constraints for different LEAs.
NOTE 4: Since IEF event generation and ICF temporary caching applies to all
UEs served by the parent NF, any multiple LEA scenarios or differences in
requirements are handled by the IQF only and no specific support is provided
by IEF or ICF.
The IQF shall support both query and response types as defined in clause
5.7.1.
#### 5.7.2.2 Identity Event Function (IEF)
The IEF is the function responsible for observing and detecting identifier
association changes within its parent NF and providing those changes in the
form of event records to the ICF over LI_XER.
IEFs may be co-located with POIs but may also be placed in other NFs where the
NFs handling identifier association do not otherwise support POI
functionality.
The IEF shall be able to provide event records to the ICF when associations
are updated. Association events include both allocation or deallocation events
for temporary identifiers managed by the IEF's parent NF and for identifier
associations which are registered or deregistered in the IEF\'s parent NF but
the identifier allocation is not controlled by that NF.
The IEF shall support activation and deactivation of IEF association reporting
capabilities, as controlled by the LICF (proxied by the LIPF) over the LI_XEM1
interface.
When IEF reporting capabilities are activated, the IEF shall obtain the
current allocation and registration state of all UEs known to the parent NF,
(where that information has been retained in the NF as part of normal network
operations) and send this as a series of allocation/registration events to the
ICF.
NOTE: The IEF can only report on associations that occurred before activation
of the IEF if those associations remain valid for UEs which are still served
by the parent NF (some allocations may not be retained by the parent NF).
Therefore, not all UE identifier associations may be available at IEF
activation (e.g. due to NF or UE mobility) and therefore ICF caching may be
incomplete until network reauthentication timers or similar reallocation
timers have refreshed all served UEs as part of normal network operation. Such
incomplete data will result in no matching identifier responses from the ICF.
When IEF reporting capabilities are deactivated, the IEF shall immediately
stop sending event records to the ICF.
#### 5.7.2.3 Identity Caching Function (ICF)
The ICF is the LI function responsible for caching of identifier associations
provided by the IEF in event records received over the LI_XER and answering
queries from the IQF received over LI_XQR. The ICF shall support association
queries from both temporary identities to permanent identities and from
permanent identities to temporary identities.
The ICF shall store identifier associations received from the IEF and hold
them indefinitely as active associations until:
\- A new association event is received which updates a previous association.
\- A disassociation event is received for a stored association.
\- A CSP defined maximum age is reached.
Upon receiving a disassociation event or a new association event from the IEF,
the ICF shall match any corresponding identifier associations, mark them for
deletion and begin the cache time for that association. After being marked for
deletion, associations shall be deleted and purged irrecoverably from the ICF
once their cache time limit is reached.
NOTE: The cache time limit after which automatic deletion should occur is
outside the scope of the present document. However, this CSP determined value
needs to be no shorter than the maximum allowed query delay (i.e., the time
from the identity observation by the LEA to the query reception by the CSP).
Otherwise, this value needs to be as short as possible.
The ICF shall support both query and response types as defined in clause
5.7.1. For the on-going triggered response query type, after sending the
initial response, the ICF shall send a further response each time the
permanent identifier provided in the initial query is associated or de-
associated with a temporary identifier until the IQF deprovisions the query in
the ICF.
The ICF shall support immediate deletion of identifier associations received
in events for one or more IEF(s) when requested to do so by the LICF (proxied
by the LIPF) over LI_XEM1.
# 6 Network layer based interception
## 6.1 General
Clause 6 gives details for the configuration of the high-level LI architecture
for network layer based interception. It defines aspects of the LI
configuration specific to each network under consideration (e.g. 5G), while
aspects concerning services delivered over this network are considered in
clause 7.
## 6.2 5G

Figure 6.2-2: 5G core-anchored LI architecture
NOTE: A CC-POI may also be present in the SMF for roaming NIDD interception,
which is not shown in figure 6.2-2.
### 6.2.2 LI at AMF
#### 6.2.2.1 Architecture
In the 5GC network, the AMF handles the access and mobility functions as well
as provides or facilitates UE location information delivery to other NFs in
the course of location-related service operations, such as LCS or Location
Reporting. The AMF shall have LI capabilities to generate the target UE\'s
network access, registration, connection management, and location update
related xIRI. Extending the generic LI architecture presented in clause 5,
figure 6.2-3 below gives a reference point representation of the LI
architecture with AMF as a CP NF providing the IRI-POI functions.
Figure 6.2-3: LI architecture for LI at AMF
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides the same to the LIPF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POI (over LI_X1) present in
the AMF and the MDF2. The LIPF may interact with the SIRF (over LI_SI) present
in the NRF to discover the AMFs in the network.
The IRI-POI present in the AMF detects the target UE\'s access and mobility
related functions (network access, registration and connection management),
generates and delivers the xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the
IRI messages as part of the Interception Product to the LEMF over LI_HI2.
#### 6.2.2.2 Target identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the AMF:
\- SUPI.
\- PEI.
\- GPSI.
The interception performed on the above three identities are mutually
independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other
identities when available.
#### 6.2.2.3 Identity privacy
TS 33.501 [9] defines the ability to prevent the SUPI being exposed over the
5G RAN through the use of SUCI. Where SUPI privacy is implemented by both the
UDM and UE, the SUPI is not sent in the clear over the RAN. Therefore, AMF has
to rely on the UDM to provide the SUPI as part of the registration procedure
as defined in TS 33.501 [9].
If the AMF receives a SUCI from the UE then the AMF shall ensure for every
registration (including re-registration) that SUPI has been provided by the
UDM to the AMF and that the SUCI to SUPI mapping has been verified as defined
in TS 33.501 [9]. This shall be performed regardless of whether the SUPI is a
target of interception.
The AMF IRI-POI shall provide both the SUPI and the current SUCI in all
applicable events defined in clause 6.2.2.4.
#### 6.2.2.4 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the AMF shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
following specific events or information:
\- Registration.
\- Deregistration.
\- Location update.
\- Identifier association.
\- Start of interception with already registered UE.
\- Unsuccessful communication related attempt.
\- Positioning info transfer.
NOTE: AMF reporting of UE state changes other than registration or
deregistration is not supported in the present document.
The registration xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an AMF detects
that a target UE has successfully registered to the 5GS via 3GPP NG-RAN or
non-3GPP access. The registration xIRI describes the type of registration
performed (e.g. initial registration, periodic registration, registration
mobility update) and the access type (e.g. 3GPP, non-3GPP). Unsuccessful
registration shall be reported only if the target UE has been successfully
authenticated.
The deregistration xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an AMF
detects that a target UE has deregistered from the 5GS. The deregistration
xIRI shall indicate whether it was a UE-initiated or a network-initiated
deregistration.
The location update xIRI is generated each time the IRI-POI present in an AMF
detects that the target\'s UE location is updated due to target UE mobility
(e.g. in case of Xn based inter NG-RAN handover) or when the AMF observes
target UE location information during some service operation (e.g., LCS,
Location Reporting, or emergency services). The generation of such xIRI may be
omitted if the updated UE location information is already included in other
xIRIs (e.g. mobility registration) provided by the IRI-POI present in the same
AMF. If the information in the AMF received over N2 (TS 38.413 [14]) includes
one or more cell IDs, then all cell IDs shall be reported to the LEMF whenever
location reporting is triggered at the AMF.
The identifier association xIRI is generated each time the IRI-POI in the AMF
detects a SUCI or 5G-GUTI allocation change for a SUPI associated with the
target UE.
The start of interception with already registered UE xIRI is generated when
the IRI-POI present in an AMF detects that interception is activated on the
target UE that has already been registered in the 5GS.
When additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to
generate and deliver the start of interception with already registered UE
related IRI messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants without
receiving the corresponding start of interception with already registered UE
xIRI.
The unsuccessful communication related attempt xIRI is generated when the IRI-
POI present in an AMF detects that a target UE initiated communication
procedure (e.g. session establishment, SMS) is rejected or not accepted by the
AMF before the proper NF handling the communication attempt itself is
involved. The unsuccessful communications related attempt xIRI is also
generated when the IRI-POI present in the AMF detects that a PDU session
modification request to convert a single access PDU session to a Multi-Access
PDU (MA PDU) session is not accepted by the AMF and therefore not forwarded to
the SMF.
The IRI-POI in the AMF shall support per target selective activation or
deactivation of reporting of identifier association xIRI independently of
activation of LI for all other events. When identifier association xIRI only
reporting is activated, the IRI-POI in the AMF shall also generate location
update xIRI.
The positioning info transfer xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the AMF detects one the the following events:
\- network-based or network-assisted positioning requests, responses or
reports related to a target UE are being exchanged between LMF and NG-RAN via
the AMF.
\- UE-based or UE-assisted positioning requests, responses or reports related
to a target UE are being exchanged between LMF and the target UE via the AMF.
NOTE: The activation and invocation of the positioning info transfer
capability exclusively for LALS is not supported in the current version of the
specification. Instead, the capability is invoked whenever any LCS operation
(including LALS) is performed on the target.
#### 6.2.2.5 Common IRI parameters
The list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15]. All xIRI shall
include the following:
\- Target identity.
\- Time stamp.
\- Location information.
\- Correlation information.
#### 6.2.2.6 Specific IRI parameters
The list of parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15]. The
following give a summary.
The registration xIRI shall include the following:
\- Registration type information.
\- Access type information.
\- Requested slice information.
The deregistration xIRI shall include the following:
\- UE initiated de-registration.
\- Access type information.
\- Network initiated de-registration.
The location update xIRI shall include the following:
\- Location of the target UE (see clause 7.3).
The identifier association xIRI shall include the following:
\- Subscription permanent identifier.
\- Temporary identifier association (i.e. SUCI or 5G-GUTI).
\- Association change type indication.
The start of interception with already registered UE xIRI shall include the
following:
\- Access type information.
\- Requested slice information.
The unsuccessful communication attempt xIRI shall include the following:
\- Rejected type of communication attempt.
\- Access type information.
\- Failure reason.
When the access type is non-3GPP, the IP address used by the UE to reach the
N3A Entity shall be reported. The port shall also be reported if available.
#### 6.2.2.7 Network topologies
The AMF shall provide the IRI-POI functions in the following network topology
cases:
\- Non-roaming case.
\- Roaming case, in VPLMN.
\- Roaming case, in HPLMN for non-3GPP access.
In a roaming case, it is possible that the target UE may use non-3GPP access
with the N3A Entity present in the HPLMN.
### 6.2.2A Identifier Reporting for AMF
#### 6.2.2A.1 General
The AMF shall provide IEF capabilities. The IEF present in the AMF shall
support LI_XEM1 interface and upon activation shall provide IEF events to the
ICF over LI_XER interface.
The IEF shall not generate events prior to UEs being successfully registered
by the AMF onto the network.
#### 6.2.2A.2 IEF Events
The IEF present in the AMF shall generate report records, when it detects the
following specific events or information for any UE:
\- Association of a 5G-GUTI to a SUPI (this may also include SUCI to SUPI
association).
\- De-association of a 5G-GUTI from a SUPI.
NOTE1: The de-association event is only generated if a new 5G-GUTI is not
allocated to a SUPI to update a previous association (e.g. at inter-AMF
handover).
NOTE 2: For SUCIs seen during registration, they shall only be reported if UE
registration is successfully completed.
The association event shall be generated by the IEF in the AMF whenever the
AMF initiates any action or procedure for which a new allocated 5G-GUTI is
sent to the UE regardless of whether the action or procedure is completed
successfully.
#### 6.2.2A.3 IEF Event parameters
The list of event parameters is specified in TS 33.128 [15]. Each event shall
include at the minimum the following information:
\- Subscription permanent identifier.
\- Observed temporary identifier(s).
\- Cell identity (see clause 7.3).
\- Time stamp of event.
\- AMF identifier (including Region and Set Identifiers).
\- Tracking area identifier.
\- Registration area (including tracking area identifier list).
The following additional information shall be included if it is available in
the AMF when the event is reported to the ICF:
\- Permanent equipment identifier.
#### 6.2.2A.4 Network topologies
Since the IEF generates events independently of network topology for
individual service usage UEs, no specific network topology handling is
provided by the IEF. The IQF shall be responsible for handling any network
topology requirements that may be applied by the LEA in an individual warrant.
### 6.2.3 LI for SMF/UPF
#### 6.2.3.1 Architecture
In the 5GC network, user plane functions are separated from the control plane
functions. The SMF that handles control plane actions (e.g. establishing,
modifying, deleting) for the PDU sessions shall include an IRI-POI that has
the LI capability to generate the related xIRI. The UPF that handles the user
plane data shall include a CC-POI that has the capability to duplicate the
user plane packets from the PDU sessions based on the interception rules
received from the SMF. Figure 6.2-4 shows the LI architecture for SMF/UPF
based interception.
Figure 6.2-4: LI architecture showing LI at SMF/UPF
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides it to the LIPF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI (present in the SMF), MDF2 and
MDF3 over the LI_X1 interfaces. To enable the interception of the target\'s
user plane packets (e.g. when the warrant requires the interception of
communication contents), the CC-TF present in the SMF is also provisioned with
the intercept data.
NOTE 1: The IRI-POI and CC-TF represented in figure 6.2-4 are logical
functions and require correlation information be shared between them; they may
be handled by the same process within the SMF.
The LIPF may interact with the SIRF (over LI_SI) present in the NRF to
discover the SMFs and UPFs in the network. The IRI-POI present in the SMF
detects the PDU session establishment, modification, and deletion related
events, generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The
MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.
When interception of communication contents is required, the CC-TF present in
the SMF sends a trigger to the CC-POI present in the UPF over the LI_T3
interface. The CC-POI in the UPF shall present itself as the same CC-POI to
all the CC-TFs in the same SMF set, such that a CC-TF is capable of modifying
or deactivating a task activated/modified in the CC-POI by a different CC-TF
in the same SMF set.
The trigger sent from the CC-TF to CC-POI includes the following information:
\- User plane packet detection rules.
\- Target identity.
\- Correlation information.
\- MDF3 address.
NOTE 2: When LI_T3 is used, the LI_X1 between LIPF and CC-POI present in the
UPF is used to monitor the user plane data.
The CC-POI present in the UPF generates the xCC from the user plane packets
and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and the target
identity) to the MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over LI_HI3.
A warrant that does not require the interception of communication contents,
may require IRI messages that have to be derived from the user plane packets.
To support the generation of related xIRI (i.e. that requires access to the
user plane packets), the present document supports two implementation
approaches as described in clause 7.12.2. When approach 1 from clause 7.12.2
is used, the IRI-POI in the UPF shall present itself as the same IRI-POI to
all the IRI-TFs in the same SMF set, such that an IRI-TF is capable of
modifying or deactivating a task activated/modified in the IRI-POI by a
different IRI-TF in the same SMF set.
Clause 8.6.2 defines a CC-PAG (CC-POI Aggregator) as an architectural
extension option that is located between the MDF3 and CC-POI and performs the
function of aggregating the xCC from different CC-POIs towards the MDF3.
#### 6.2.3.2 Target identities
The LIPF provisions the intercept related information associated with the
following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the SMF:
\- SUPI.
\- PEI.
\- GPSI.
The interception performed on the above three identities are mutually
independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other
identities when available.
#### 6.2.3.3 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the SMF shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
following specific events or information:
\- PDU session establishment.
\- PDU session modification.
\- PDU session release.
\- Start of interception with an established PDU session.
The PDU session establishment xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the SMF detects that a PDU session has been established for the target UE.
The PDU session modification xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
SMF detects that a PDU session is modified for the target UE.
The PDU session release xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the SMF
detects that a PDU session is released for the target UE.
The start of interception with an established PDU session xIRI is generated
when the IRI-POI present in a SMF detects that interception is activated on
the target UE that has an already established PDU session in the 5GS. When a
target UE has multiple PDU sessions, this xIRI shall be sent for each PDU
session with a different value of correlation information.
When additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to
generate and deliver the start of interception with an established PDU session
related IRI messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants without
receiving the corresponding start of interception with an established PDU
session xIRI.
When the warrant requires the packet header information reporting, the
following xIRI shall be generated:
\- Packet header information report (see clause 7.12.2).
The generation of packet header information reporting can be done by either
the IRI-POI present in the UPF or the MDF2.
#### 6.2.3.4 Common IRI parameters
The list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15]. Each xIRI shall
include at the minimum the following information:
\- Target identity.
\- Time stamp.
\- Correlation information.
\- Location information.
\- Session related information.
#### 6.2.3.5 Specific IRI parameters
The parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15].
#### 6.2.3.6 Network topologies
The SMF shall provide the IRI-POI functions in the following network topology
cases:
\- Non-roaming case.
\- Roaming case, in VPLMN.
\- Roaming case, in HPLMN.
\- Non-3GPP access case, in the PLMN where N3A Entity resides.
When the target UE has multiple PDU sessions active, the generation and
delivery of xCC for each PDU session shall be done independently, each with
separate correlation information.
When a target UE\'s PDU session involves multiple Data Network (DN)
connections (i.e. multiple connections to the same DN as described in clause
A.3 of the present document), the generation and delivery of xCC shall be done
in such a way that:
\- All applicable user plane packets are captured and delivered.
\- Duplicate delivery of CC is suppressed to the extent possible.
\- Each user plane packet is delivered with the associated DN Access
Identifier (DNAI).
A PDU session may involve more than one UPFs. In that case, the CC-TF present
in the SMF shall determine which UPF(s) is (are) more suitable to provide the
CC-POI functions adhering to the above requirements. Furthermore, independent
of which UPF is used to generate the xCC, the CC delivered from the MDF3 shall
be correlated to the IRI messages related to the PDU session.
#### 6.2.3.7 Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session Specific
The IRI-POI present in the SMF shall generate xIRI, for MA PDU sessions when
it detects events or information as in clause 6.2.3.3, with the following
clarifications.
The PDU session establishment xIRI:
\- When a UE request for an MA PDU session is received at the SMF (for one or
more access types).
\- When a UE request for a single access PDU session is received at the SMF
with an upgrade indicator to an MA PDU and the SMF chooses to establish an MA
PDU session.
The PDU session modification xIRI:
\- When an MA PDU Session is modified by releasing or adding an access type.
\- When a UE request for a mid-session upgrade to MA PDU session is received
at the SMF.
The PDU session release xIRI:
\- When the entire PDU session is released.
Each user plane packet of the MA PDU session should be able to be associated
to the access type.
#### 6.2.3.8 LI state transfers in SMF sets
{width="6.69375in" height="7.722222222222222in"}
Figure 6.2-4A: LI architecture diagram for SMF/UPF interception when using SMF
sets and LISSF
If an SMF belongs to an SMF set, then the TF present in the SMF shall have the
ability to modify or stop the interceptions in the POIs present in the UPF
irrespective of which TF present in an SMF from that SMF set had previously
initiated the interception. A TF in one SMF of an SMF set may initiate the
interception at a POI present in the UPF, the TF present in another SMF of the
SMF set may make changes to the interception in that POI, and a TF in a
different SMF of the SMF set may stop the interception in that POI.
In order to allow the TFs present in different SMFs of an SMF set to manage
the interceptions at the POI present in an UPF, a new LI function referred to
as LI State Storage Function (LISSF) is introduced. The TF that initiates the
interception at a POI present in the UPF stores the related necessary
information (e.g. correlation information) in case a different TF has to
manage the interception at that POI. This necessary related information is
referred to as LI state information (see TS 33.128 [15] for the details).
If an SMF belongs to an SMF set, then the POI present in the SMF shall have
the ability to continue the interception using the same correlation
information or stop the interception even when the SMF that manages the PDU
session changes.
In order to allow the POIs present in different SMFs of an SMF set to continue
the interception by maintaining a continuity, the LISSF mentioned above is
used by storing the LI state information. When required, the POI present in
the SMF of an SMF set stores the LI state information in the LISSF. The POI
present in another SMF of the same SMF can retrieve the LI state information
from that LISSF to provide a continued interception.
When an SMF in an SMF set requests SM context information related to a target
from a UDSF or receives SM context information from another SMF, the TF and
POI within the SMF shall retrieve also the relevant LI state information from
the shared LISSF.
If the implementation of the SMF set does not ensure that active SM contexts
are always present in some SMF of the SMF set, the TF shall also retrieve the
relevant LI state information when an existing task is deactivated by the
LIPF.
NOTE: The race conditions between the LI_X1, LI_ST operations, and network
events are possible and need to be accounted for in the implementation.
#### 6.2.3.9 Interface LI_ST
LI_ST is an interface between the LISSF and the LIPF and between the LISSF and
other LI functions. It is used for transferring LI state information. The LI
functions may request, store or erase LI state information from the LISSF
using this interface. LI functions need to be authorized by the LIPF to have
access to a specific instance of the LISSF before using the LI_ST interface.

### 6.2.4 LI at UDM for 5G
In 5G packet core network, the UDM provides the unified data management for
UE. The UDM shall have LI capabilities to generate the target UE\'s service
area registration related xIRI. See clause 7.2.2 for the details.
### 6.2.5 LI at SMSF
#### 6.2.5.1 Architecture
In the 5GC network, the SMSF provides functionalities to support the SMS over
NAS. The SMSF shall have LI capabilities to generate xIRIs when SMS related to
the target UE are handled. Extending the generic LI architecture presented in
clause 5, figure 6.2-5 below gives a reference point representation of the LI
architecture with SMSF as a CP NF providing the IRI-POI functions.
Figure 6.2-5: LI architecture for LI at SMSF
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides the same to the LIPF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POI present in the SMSF and
the MDF2 over LI_X1 interfaces. The LIPF may interact with the SIRF (over
LI_SI) present in the NRF to discover the SMSFs in the network.
The IRI-POI present in the SMSF detects the target UE\'s SMS, generates and
delivers the xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The xIRI will contain the SMS
payload. The MDF2 shall support the capability to deliver the IRI messages
including the SMS payload as part of the Interception Product to the LEMF over
LI_HI2.
National regulations may require that the MDF2 remove information regarded as
content from the payload in case of an IRI only warrant.
#### 6.2.5.2 Target identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the SMSF:
\- SUPI.
\- PEI.
\- GPSI.
The interception performed on the above three identities are mutually
independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other
identities when available.
#### 6.2.5.3 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the SMSF shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
following specific events or information:
\- SMS message.
The SMS message xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an SMSF detects
that an SMS message for the target UE is handled.
#### 6.2.5.4 Common IRI parameters
The list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15]. The xIRIs shall
include at the minimum the following information:
\- Target identity.
\- Time stamp.
\- Location information.
\- SMS message direction (mobile originated, mobile terminated).
\- SMS message payload.
#### 6.2.5.5 Specific IRI parameters
The parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15].
#### 6.2.5.6 Network topologies
The SMSF shall provide the IRI-POI functions in the following network topology
cases:
\- Non-roaming case.
\- Roaming case, in VPLMN.
NOTE: SMS message delivery over non-3GPP access with N3A Entity in the HPLMN
is considered a non-roaming case.
### 6.2.6 LI support at NRF
#### 6.2.6.1 Architecture
In 5G, network functions that support SBA register with the NRF after
instantiation. The NRF thus provides the network repository functions and is
aware of all the NFs that have been instantiated. The present document refers
to this as system information.
The SIRF present in the NRF provides the system information to LIPF present in
the ADMF, in order for the LIPF to establish which NFs (and therefore POIs)
are applicable to a specific target user\'s services. LI function service
discovery is described in clause 5.5.
An architecture diagram depicting this LI at NRF is shown in figure 6.2-6
below.
Figure 6.2-6: LI Architecture depicting NRF as an SIRF
Figure 6.2-6 shows the architecture illustrating the SIRF functions within the
NRF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF interacts with the SIRF (over LI_SI) present in
the NRF to obtain the system information.
#### 6.2.6.2 LI_SI notifications {#li_si-notifications .list-paragraph}
The SIRF present in the NRF shall generate notifications over LI_SI when the
SIRF detects the following specific events or information:
\- NF service registration.
\- NF service update.
\- NF service deregistration.
\- NF service chain change.
The NF service chain change notification shall be generated whenever an NF is
added to or removed from a service chain in response to NF discovery and
selection events.
#### 6.2.6.3 LI_SI parameters {#li_si-parameters .list-paragraph}
The notifications reported over LI_SI by the SIRF shall include the following
information elements:
\- Event type (as defined in clause 6.2.6.2).
\- NF details, including appropriate information elements defined in TS 23.501
[2] clause 6.2.6.
### 6.2.7 External data storage
#### 6.2.7.1 UDSF or UDR
The UDSF or UDR as defined in TS 23.501 [2] are used to externally store data
relating to one or more NFs, separating the compute and storage elements of an
NF. Where the NF contains a POI the following restrictions on the use of the
UDSF/UDR shall apply:
\- The UDSF/UDR shall be subject to the same location, geographic, security
and other physical environment constraints as the NF POI for which it is
storing data.
\- No LI specific POI data (e.g. target list) shall be stored in the UDSF/UDR
unless storage is directly under the control of the POI within the NF.
\- LI data stored in a UDSF/UDR shall only be accessible by the specific
individual POI for which the UDSF/UDR is storing data and that data shall not
be shared between POIs unless specifically authorised by the LICF within the
ADMF.
\- By default, LI data shall not be stored in a UDSF/UDR which is shared by
multiple NFs unless specifically authorised by the LICF.
\- Any storage of LI data outside of the POI in the UDSF/UDR shall be
auditable by the LICF.
\- The interface between the POI/NF and the UDSF/UDR shall be protected such
that an attacker cannot identify targeted users based on observation of this
interface. (i.e. access to the UDSF/UDR shall be identical for both
intercepted and non-intercepted user communications).
\- The use and placement of a UDSF/UDR within an NF/POI design shall not
introduce additional interception delay compared with non-separated compute
and storage.
\- Where the POI requires access to NF data that is stored in the UDSF/UDR,
non-LI network functions and processes or non-LI authorised personnel shall
not be able to detect POI access to that data in the UDSF/UDR.
\- The POI and LICF/MDF shall be responsible for managing encryption of LI
data stored in the UDSF/UDR for the POI in addition to any default encryption
applied by the NF.
The above requirements shall apply when the UDSF/UDR provide data storage for
TF/NF.
#### 6.2.7.2 LI State Storage Function (LISSF)
The LISSF is a function that makes it possible for other LI functions to share
information with each other. There can be multiple instances of the LISSF in
the network being handled by the same ADMF. The LISSF can be implemented as a
separate function or within the ADMF. The LISSF may be used to transfer LI
state information between LI functions. The following restrictions on the use
of the LISSF shall apply:
\- The LISSF shall be subject to the same location, geographic, security and
other physical environment constraints as the LI functions for which it is
storing data.
\- LI state information stored in an LISSF shall only be accessible by the LI
functions specifically authorised by the LICF.
\- Other than the time required to acquire the LI state information, the use
and placement of an LISSF within the LI architecture shall not introduce
additional delay.
\- The LISSF shall be directly under the control of the ADMF, and it shall be
directly accessible and auditable by the LICF.
## 6.3 EPC
### 6.3.1 General
The present document specifies three options for EPC interception
capabilities:
\- Option A. Perform LI on the events specified in the current document in
clauses 6.3.2.3.1, 6.3.3.3 and 6.3.4.3 using the capabilities specified below
for stage 2 and in TS 33.128 [15] for stage 3.
\- Option B. Perform LI on the events specified in TS 33.107 [11] clause 12
and clause 18.2.4 using the capabilities specified below in the present
document for stage 2 and in TS 33.128 [15] for stage 3.
\- Option C. Use TS 33.107 [11] and TS 33.108 [21] natively as defined in
those documents.
For implementations that include EPS/5GS interworking, Option A shall be used.
For virtualised 4G implementations from Release 15 onwards (including combined
4G / 5G scenarios), 4G shall be virtualised based on the architecture in
clause 5.6. For such implementations the LI architecture for 4G / LTE shall be
implemented using an ADMF as defined in the present document (including LIPF
and LICF split). However, equivalent reference points as specified in TS
33.107 [11] shall be used where appropriate (e.g. X2 is equivalent to LI_X2 in
the present document and MDF is equivalent to MF/DF). Security and audit
requirements as defined in clause 8 of the present document shall be applied
to such 4G scenarios.
### 6.3.2 LI at the MME
#### 6.3.2.1 Architecture
In the EPC network, the MME handles the mobility management and connection
management as specified in TS 23.401 [22]. The MME shall have LI capabilities
to generate the target UE's network access, registration and connection
management related xIRI. Extending the generic LI architecture presented in
clause 5, figure 6.3-1 below gives a reference point representation of the LI
architecture with MME as a CP Network Element providing the IRI-POI functions.
Figure 6.3-1: LI architecture for LI at MME
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides the same to the LIPF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POI (over LI_X1) present in
the MME and the MDF2.
The IRI-POI present in the MME detects the target UE\'s access and mobility
related functions (network access, registration and connection management),
generates and delivers the xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the
IRI messages as part of the Interception Product to the LEMF over LI_HI2.
#### 6.3.2.2 Target identities
The LIPF provisions the IRI-POI present in the MME with the following target
identities:
\- IMSI.
\- MSISDN.
\- IMEI.
The interception performed on the above three identities are mutually
independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other
identities when available.
#### 6.3.2.3 IRI events
##### 6.3.2.3.1 Option A
The IRI-POI present in the MME shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
following specific events or information:
\- Attach.
\- Detach.
\- Tracking Area/EPS Location Update.
\- Start of interception with EPS attached UE.
\- Unsuccessful communication related attempt.
\- Identifier association.
\- Positioning info transfer.
The attach xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an MME detects that a
target UE has performed an E-UTRAN attach procedure including via a HeNB. The
attach xIRI describes the type of attach performed. Unsuccessful registration
shall be reported only if the target UE has been successfully authenticated.
The detach xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an MME detects that a
target UE has detached from the EPS including via a HeNB. The detach xIRI
shall indicate whether it was a UE-initiated or a network-initiated detach.
The tracking area/EPS location update xIRI is generated each time the IRI-POI
present in an MME detects that the target UE location is updated due to target
UE mobility (e.g. in case of X2 based handover, S1 based handover) or when the
MME observes target UE location information during some service operation
(e.g., periodic Tracking Area Update, UE triggered Service Request). If the
information in the MME received over S1 (TS 36.413 [14]) includes one or more
cell IDs, then all cell IDs shall be reported to the LEMF whenever location
reporting is triggered at the MME.
The start of interception with EPS attached UE xIRI is generated when the IRI-
POI present in an MME detects that interception is activated on a target UE
that is already attached to the EPS. If there are multiple PDN connections
active for the target, then a start of interception with EPS attached UE xIRI
is generated for each of them.
When additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to
generate and deliver the start of interception with E-UTRAN attached UE
related IRI messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants without
receiving the corresponding start of interception with already registered UE
xIRI.
The unsuccessful communication related attempt xIRI is generated when the IRI-
POI present in an MME detects that a target UE initiated communication
procedure (e.g. service request, SMS) is rejected or not accepted by the MME
before the proper NF handling the communication attempt itself is involved.
The identifier association xIRI is generated each time the IRI-POI in the MME
detects a GUTI allocation change for an IMSI associated with the target UE.
The IRI-POI in the MME shall support per target selective activation or
deactivation of reporting of only identifier association xIRI independently of
activation of LI for all other events. When identifier association xIRI only
reporting is activated, the IRI-POI in the MME shall also generate Tracking
Area/EPS Location Update xIRI.
The positioning info transfer xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the MME detects one the following events:
\- network-based or network-assisted positioning requests, responses or
reports related to a target UE are being exchanged between E-SMSC and eNB via
the MME.
\- UE-based or UE-assisted positioning requests, responses or reports related
to a target UE are being exchanged between E-SMLC and the target UE via the
MME.
NOTE: The activation and invocation of the positioning info transfer
capability exclusively for LALS is not supported in the current version of the
specification. Instead, the capability is invoked whenever any LCS operation
(including LALS) is performed on the target.
##### 6.3.2.3.2 Option B
The IRI-POI present in the MME shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
applicable events specified in TS 33.107 [11].
In addition to the events specified in TS 33.107 [11] the MME shall generate
xIRI, when it detects the following additional event:
\- Identifier association.
The identifier association xIRI is generated each time the IRI-POI in the MME
detects a GUTI allocation change for an IMSI associated with the target UE.
The IRI-POI in the MME shall support per target selective activation or
deactivation of reporting of only identifier association xIRI independently of
activation of LI for all other events. When identifier association xIRI only
reporting is activated, the IRI-POI in the MME shall also generate Tracking
Area/EPS Location Update xIRI.
#### 6.3.2.4 Common IRI parameters
The list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15]. All xIRI shall
include the following:
\- Target identity.
\- Time stamp.
\- Location information.
\- Correlation information.
#### 6.3.2.5 Specific IRI parameters
##### 6.3.2.5.1 Option A
The list of parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15]. The
following give a summary.
The attach xIRI shall include the following:
\- Attach type information.
\- Access type information.
\- HeNB information.
The detach xIRI shall include the following:
\- Detach Direction.
\- Detach type information.
\- HeNB information.
The tracking area/EPS location update xIRI shall include the following:
\- Location of the target (see clause 7.3).
\- HeNB information.
The start of interception with EPS attached UE xIRI shall include the
following:
\- Attach type information.
\- Access type information.
\- PDN connection information.
The unsuccessful communication attempt xIRI shall include the following:
\- Rejected type of communication attempt.
\- Access type information.
\- Failure reason.
The identifier association xIRI shall include the following:
\- IMSI.
\- IMEI.
\- Temporary identifier association (i.e. GUTI).
\- Association change type indication.
##### 6.3.2.5.2 Option B
The list of parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15], for events
which are imported from TS 33.107 [11] clause 12.2.1.2.
The identifier association xIRI shall include the following:
\- IMSI.
\- IMEI.
\- Temporary identifier association (i.e. GUTI).
\- Association change type indication.
#### 6.3.2.6 Network topologies
The MME shall provide the IRI-POI functions in the following network topology
cases:
\- Non-roaming case.
\- Roaming case, in VPLMN.
### 6.3.3 LI at SGW/PGW
#### 6.3.3.1 Architecture
##### 6.3.3.1.1 General
In the EPC network, the SGW is the gateway which terminates the user plane
interface as specified in TS 23.401 [22]. The PGW is the gateway which
terminates the SGi interface towards the PDN as specified in TS 23.401 [22].
Additionally, the PGW is the user plane anchor for mobility between 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access as specified in TS 23.402 [23].
NOTE : The present document supports LI for non-3GPP accesses connected to EPC
using GTP-based S2a or GTP-based S2b as specified by TS 23.402 [23]. Other
scenarios are covered by TS 33.107 [11].
The SGW and PGW shall include an IRI-POI that has the LI capabilities to
generate the target UE\'s bearer related and a CC-POI that has the LI
capabilities to duplicate the user plane packets from the EPS bearers related
to a target UE.
As defined in TS 23.214 [75], the SGW and PGW may have separated control plane
and user plane functions (CUPS). The control plane (CP) functions (SGW-C and
PGW-C) provide the traffic forwarding rules (referred to as Forward Action
Rules in TS 23.214 [75]) to the user plane (UP) functions (SGW-U and PGW-U).
The UP functions forward the user plane traffic as per the Forward Action
Rules.
In the following clauses, EPS architecture that does not separate the control
plane and user plane functions of the SGW/PGW is referred to as non-CUPS EPS.
The LI architecture for non-CUPS EPS is defined in clause 6.3.3.1.2. For non-
CUPS EPS architecture, the SGW and PGW function as both CP Entities and the UP
Entities.
The LI architecture for CUPS EPS is defined in clause 6.3.3.1.3. For CUPS EPS
architecture:
\- The CP Entities are the SGW-C and the PGW-C.
\- The UP Entities are the SGW-U and the PGW-U.
When CUPS architecture is used, unless otherwise specified, the term SGW/PGW
refers to both the SGW-U/PGW-U and the SGW-C/PGW-C.
When CUPS architecture is used:
\- The LI functions present in the SGW-C/PGW-C are:
\- The IRI-POI.
\- The IRI-TF.
\- The CC-TF.
\- The LI functions present in the SGW-U/PGW-U are:
\- The CC-POI.
\- The IRI-POI.
When EPC-5GC interworking architecture is used and the PGW-C and PGW-U are
part of combined SMF+PGW-C and UPF+PGW-U respectively:
\- The LI functions present in the SMF+PGW-C are:
\- The IRI-POI.
\- The CC-TF.
\- The IRI-TF.
\- The LI functions present in the UPF+PGW-U are:
\- The CC-POI.
\- The IRI-POI.
##### 6.3.3.1.2 Non-CUPS architecture
Figure 6.3-2 shows the LI architecture for non-CUPS SGW/PGW based
interception.
{width="6.695138888888889in" height="6.663888888888889in"}
Figure 6.3-2: LI architecture for LI at non-CUPS SGW/PGW
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides the same to the LIPF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI present in the SGW/PGW, MDF2
and MDF3 over the LI_X1 interfaces. To enable the interception of the
target\'s user plane packets (e.g. when the warrant requires the interception
of communication contents), the CC-POI present in the SGW/PGW is also
provisioned with the intercept data.
NOTE: The IRI-POI and CC-POI represented in figure 6.3-2 are logical functions
and require correlation information be shared between them; they may be
handled by the same process within the SGW/PGW.
The IRI-POI present in the SGW/PGW detects the target UE\'s bearer activation,
modification and deactivation, generates and delivers the xIRI to the MDF2
over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.
The CC-POI present in the SGW/PGW generates the xCC from the user plane
packets and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and the
target identity) to the MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over
LI_HI3.
A warrant that does not require the interception of communication contents,
may require IRI messages that have to be derived from the user plane packets.
To support the generation of related xIRI (i.e. that requires access to the
user plane packets), the present document supports two implementation
approaches described in clause 7.12.2
##### 6.3.3.1.3 EPS CUPS Architecture
Figure 6.3-3 shows the LI architecture for EPS CUPS SGW/PGW based
interception.
{width="6.695138888888889in" height="6.143285214348206in"}
Figure 6.3-3: LI architecture for LI at EPS CUPS SGW/PGW
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides the same to the LIPF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI present in the SGW-C/PGW-C and
the MDF2 over the LI_X1 interfaces. To enable the interception of the
target\'s user plane packets (e.g. when the warrant requires the interception
of communication contents), the CC-TF present in the SGW-C/PGW-C is also
provisioned with the intercept data.
NOTE: The IRI-POI and CC-TF represented in figure 6.3-3 are logical functions
and require correlation information be shared between them; they may be
handled by the same process within the SGW-C/PGW-C.
When PGW-C and PGW-U (represented in figure 6.3-3) are part of combined
SMF+PGW-C and UPF+PGW-U respectively in the EPC-5GC interworking architectures
as shown in clause A.2.2, figure A.2-1 of the present document, the SMF+PGW-C
and UPF+PGW-U shall exhibit the LI functions as described in clause 6.3.3.3.1.
The IRI-POI present in the SGW-C/PGW-C detects the target UE\'s bearer
activation, modification and deactivation and generates and delivers the xIRI
to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over
LI_HI2.
The CC-TF present in the SGW-C/PGW-C detects the target UE\'s bearer
activation, modification and deactivation and provisions the CC-POI in the
SGW-U/PGW-U.
The CC-POI present in the SGW-U/PGW-U generates the xCC from the user plane
packets and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and the
target identity) to the MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over
LI_HI3.
A warrant that does not require the interception of communication contents,
may require IRI messages that have to be derived from the user plane packets.
To support the generation of related xIRI (i.e. that requires access to the
user plane packets), the present document supports two implementation
approaches described in clause 7.12.2.
#### 6.3.3.2 Target identities
The LI functions in the SGW/PGW shall support the following target identities
for provisioning:
\- IMSI.
\- MSISDN.
\- IMEI.
Interception performed on the above three identities are mutually independent,
even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other identities
when available.
In the case of EPC-5GC interworking via combined SMF+PGW-C and UPF+PGW-U, the
LI functions in the SMF+PGW-C shall support the following target identities:
\- SUPI.
\- IMSI.
\- GPSI.
\- MSISDN.
\- PEI.
\- IMEI.
Interception performed on the above identities may be mutually independent.
Details for how the above identities are related are specified in TS 33.128
[15].An xIRI may contain information about the other identities when
available.
#### 6.3.3.3 IRI events
##### 6.3.3.3.1 Option A
##### 6.3.3.3.1.1 General {#general-13 .H6}
When Option A described in clause 6.3.1 is used, xIRI provided by the IRI-POI
in the SMF+PGW-C based on the events specified in TS 33.107 [11] shall not be
generated; the IRI-POI in the SMF+PGW-C shall generate xIRI when it detects
the following specific events or information specified in TS 33.128 [15]:
\- PDN connection establishment.
\- PDN connection modification.
\- PDN connection release.
\- Start of interception with an established PDN connection.
\- Unsuccessful procedure.
When EPC/5GC interworking architecture is used, the xIRI for the events listed
above are described in clause 6.3.3.3.1.2.
##### 6.3.3.3.1.2 xIRI records for architectures with EPC/5GC interworking
{#xiri-records-for-architectures-with-epc5gc-interworking .H6}
For the interception of home routed roaming sessions in the visited network,
the POIs and TFs shall be present in the SGW and the SMF in the VPLMN and the
xIRI records described in the present clause and clause 6.2.3.3 shall be
generated.
For all other cases, the POIs and TFs shall be present in the SMF+PGW-C and
SMF+PGW-U as described in clause 6.3.3.6.2 and the following events shall be
generated.
The PDU session establishment xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the SMF+PGW-C detects that a PDU session with mapped EBIs has been established
for the target UE or that a PDN connection has been established for the target
UE.
The PDU session modification xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
SMF+PGW-C detects that a PDU session or EBIs are modified for the target UE or
when a target UE\'s PDN connection from EPC is migrated to the 5GS or when a
dedicated EPS bearer is activated or deactivated for the target UE.
The PDU session release xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
SMF+PGW-C detects that a PDU session is released or when the default EBI for a
PDN connection is deactivated for the target UE.
The start of interception with an established PDU Session xIRI is generated
when the IRI-POI present in a SMF+PGW-C detects that interception is activated
on the target UE that has an already established PDU session in the 5GS that
has a mapped to PDN connection or an already established PDN connection in
EPS. When a target UE has multiple 5GC PDU sessions mapped to multiple PDN
connections in EPC or when a target UE has multiple PDN connections in EPC,
this xIRI shall be sent for each PDU session and each PDN connection with
different correlation information values.
When xIRIs are generated due to the detection of a PDU session with mapped
EBIs, no separate xIRIs shall be generated for the same events for the
corresponding PDN connection.
When additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to
generate and deliver the start of interception with an established PDU session
related IRI messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants without
receiving the corresponding start of interception with an established PDU
session xIRI.
When the warrant requires the packet header information reporting, the
following xIRI shall be generated:
\- Packet header information report (see clause 7.12.2).
The generation of packet header information reporting can be done by either
the IRI-POI present in the UPF+PGW-U or the MDF2.
##### 6.3.3.3.2 Option B
The IRI-POI present in the SGW/PGW shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
applicable events specified in TS 33.107 [11].

correlation information.
#### 6.3.3.7 EPC-5GC Interworking via SMF+PGW-C and UPF+PGW-U
In the case of interworking between EPC and 5GC via combined nodes (e.g.
SMF+PGW-C, UPF+PGW-U) as defined in TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.17, all of the
requirements found in clause 6.2.3 (LI for SMF/UPF) and clause 6.3.3 (LI at
the SGW/PGW) of the present document apply with the following modifications:
\- PDN Connection context information present in the combined SMF+PGW-C shall

\- User identifiers that are EPC specific but known in the combined SMF+PGW-C
are reported as supplemental user IDs per TS 33.128 [15] clause 6.2.3.
### 6.3.4 LI at ePDG
#### 6.3.4.1 Architecture
In the EPC network, the ePDG is the gateway which allows interworking between
non-3GPP access and 3GPP network. The ePDG functionalities are specified in TS
23.402 [23].
NOTE 1: The present document supports LI for non-3GPP accesses connected to
EPC using GTP-based S2a or GTP-based S2b as specified in TS 23.402 [23]. Other
scenarios are covered by TS 33.107 [11].
The ePDG shall include an IRI-POI that has the LI capabilities to generate the
target UE's bearer related xIRI.
In addition, the ePDG shall include a CC-POI that has the LI capabilities to
duplicate the user plane packets from the EPS bearers related to a target UE.
Figure 6.3-4 shows the LI architecture for ePDG based interception.
Figure 6.3-4: LI architecture for LI at ePDG
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides the same to the LIPF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI present in the ePDG, MDF2 and
MDF3 over the LI_X1 interfaces. To enable the interception of the target\'s
user plane packets (e.g. when the warrant requires the interception of
communication contents), the CC-POI present in the ePDG is also provisioned
with the intercept data.
NOTE 2: The IRI-POI and CC-POI represented in figure 6.3-3 are logical
functions and require correlation information be shared between them; they may
be handled by the same process within the ePDG.
The IRI-POI present in the ePDG detects the target UE\'s bearer activation,
modification and deactivation, generates and delivers the xIRI to the MDF2
over LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.
The CC-POI present in the ePDG generates the xCC from the user plane packets
and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and the target
identity) to the MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over LI_HI3.
#### 6.3.4.2 Target identities
The target identities which the LIPF present in the ADMF provisions to the
IRI-POI and CC-POI present in the ePDG are specified in TS 33.107 [11].
#### 6.3.4.3 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the ePDG shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
applicable events specified in TS 33.107 [11].
#### 6.3.4.4 Common IRI parameters
The list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15]. Each xIRI shall
include at the minimum the following information:
\- Target identity.
\- Time stamp.
\- Correlation information.
\- Location information.
\- Bearer related information.
#### 6.3.4.5 Specific IRI parameters
The parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15].
#### 6.3.4.6 Network topologies
The ePDG shall provide the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions in the following
network topology cases:
\- Roaming case, in VPLMN.
## 6.4 3G
The present document does not specify LI functionality for 3G / UMTS. LI
capabilities for 3G / UMTS for this release are specified in TS 33.107 [11].
## 6.5 VoNR
Voice over NR as defined in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.502 [4] is intended to
provide equivalent functionality to VoLTE in 4G.
LI requirements for VoNR based on IMS are defined in clause 7.4 of the present
document.
## 6.6 4G/5G Interworking
Figure 6.6-1 depicts interworking between EPC and the 5G architecture. The
network functions are depicted in grey, while the LI elements are depicted in
blue.

NOTE: A CC-POI may also be present in the MME and SMF for roaming NIDD
interception, which are not shown in figure 6.6-1.
# 7 Service layer based interception
## 7.1 General
Clause 7 provides details for the configuration of the high-level LI
architecture for service layer based interception and for network function
which are not specific to a single access type or network service (e.g.
subscription management functions). It defines aspects of the LI configuration
specific to each service under consideration, while aspects concerning network
over which the service is delivered (e.g. 5G) are considered in clause 6.
## 7.2 Central subscriber management
### 7.2.1 General
Clause 7.2 provides LI architecture and requirements for the CSP 3GPP
subscriber database LI reporting. Central subscriber databases are common for
all CSP network services, including both the network layer and the service
layer. This clause 7.2 provides requirements for both user session related
interception events and requirements for reporting of changes to the
subscriber information held within the 3GPP subscriber databases, which may or
may not be directly related to service usage.
### 7.2.2 LI at UDM
#### 7.2.2.1 Architecture
The UDM provides the unified data management for UE. The UDM shall have LI
capabilities to generate the target UE\'s serving system (e.g. VPLMN Id or AMF
Id related xIRI). Extending the generic LI architecture presented in clause 5,
figure 7.2-1 below gives a reference point representation the LI architecture
with UDM as a CP NF providing the IRI-POI functions.
Figure 7.2-1: LI architecture for LI at UDM
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides it to the LIPF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI (over LI_X1) present in the
UDM and MDF2. The LIPF may interact with the SIRF (over LI_SI) present in the
NRF to discover the UDM in the network.
The IRI-POI present in the UDM detects the target UE\'s service area
registration and subscription related functions, generates and delivers the
xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 generates and delivers the IRI messages
based on received xIRI to the LEMF over LI_H2.
#### 7.2.2.2 Target identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the UDM:
\- SUPI.
\- PEI.
\- GPSI.
\- IMPU/IMPI.
The interception performed on the above identities are mutually independent,
even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other identities
when available.
#### 7.2.2.3 Identity privacy
TS 33.501 [9] defines the ability to prevent the SUPI being exposed over the
5G RAN through the use of SUCI. Where SUPI privacy is implemented by both the
UDM and UE, the SUPI is not sent in the clear over the RAN. Therefore, the UDM
shall ensure that the SUPI is provided to the serving AMF in both initial
registration and re-registration procedures as defined in TS 33.501 [9].
#### 7.2.2.4 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the UDM shall generate xIRI, when the UDM detects the
following specific events or information:
\- Serving system.
\- Subscriber record change.
\- Cancel location.
\- Location information request.
\- Location information result.
\- UE information response.
\- UE authentication response.
A serving system xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the UDM detects
the target UE registration or re-registration related notifications. The AMF
Id or the MME Id, or the VPLMN Id (when the other two are not known) is used
as the serving system identifier in a serving system xIRI.
NOTE: The serving system xIRI may carry the information of one or more serving
systems based on the target UE\'s network connectivity.
A subscriber record change xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
UDM detects that the GPSI, or SUPI, or PEI associated to the target has
changed. In addition, a subscriber record change xIRI is generated when the
associated GPSI or, SUPI, or PEI for the target is de-provisioned. A
subscriber record change xIRI is also generated when the target's user service
identifiers are modified (e.g. subscribed S-NSSAIs, subscribed CAG).
A cancel location xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the UDM
detects that a de-registration notification is sent, or received, by the UDM
for the target.
A location information request xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the UDM detects that the UDM received a query for the location information of
the target UE from a different PLMN (e.g. inbound SMS routing) with a known
PLMN Id.
A location information result xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the UDM
detects that the UDM received a LocationInfoRequest from an NF service
consumer (i.e. HSS) for the target and responds with a LocationInfoResult to
the NF service consumer.
A UE information response xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
UDM detects that the UDM received a ProvideUeInfo request for the target UE
and returns a UeInfo response.
A UE authentication response xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
UDM detects that the UDM received an authentication info request for the
target UE from the HSS or AUSF and an authentication info result is sent.
#### 7.2.2.5 Common IRI parameters
The list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15]. All xIRIs shall
include the following information:
\- Target identity.
\- Time stamp.
#### 7.2.2.6 Specific IRI parameters
The parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15].
#### 7.2.2.7 Network topologies
The UDM shall provide the IRI-POI functions in the following network topology
cases:
\- Non-roaming case.
\- Roaming case, in HPLMN.
### 7.2.3 LI at HSS
#### 7.2.3.1 Architecture
The HSS contains the subscription-related information for all users served by
the CSP. The HSS provides the support functions in the mobility management,
session setup, user authentication and access authorization.
The HSS shall have LI capabilities to generate the xIRIs as described in
clause 7.2.3.3. The present document specifies two options for HSS LI
capabilities:
> 1\. Use TS 33.107 [11] and TS 33.108 [21] natively as defined in those
> documents.
>
> 2\. Use the capabilities specified below in the present document for stage 2
> and in TS 33.128 [15] for stage 3.
Extending the generic LI architecture presented in clause 5, figure 7.2-2
below gives a reference point representation the LI architecture with HSS as a
CP NF providing the IRI-POI functions.
Figure 7.2-2: LI architecture for LI at HSS
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides it to the LIPF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI (over LI_X1) present in the
HSS and MDF2.
The IRI-POI present in the HSS detects the target UE\'s service area
registration and subscription related functions, generates and delivers the
xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2 generates and delivers the IRI messages
based on received xIRI to the LEMF over LI_H2.
The HSS shall provide the IRI-POI functions independent of the services on
which the interception is active.
When multiple intercepts are active, IRI-POI functions in the HSS may send one
xIRI which can then be distributed to the LEMFs associated with those multiple
intercepts from the MDF2.
#### 7.2.3.2 Target identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the HSS:
\- IMSI.
\- IMEI.
\- MSISDN.
\- IMPU/IMPI.
The interception performed on the above identities are mutually independent,
even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other identities
when available.
#### 7.2.3.3 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the HSS shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
applicable events specified in TS 33.107 [11].
#### 7.2.3.4 Common IRI parameters
The list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15]. All xIRIs shall
include the following information:
\- Target identity.
\- Time stamp.
#### 7.2.3.5 Specific IRI parameters
The parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15].
#### 7.2.3.6 Network topologies
The HSS shall provide the IRI-POI functions in the following network topology
cases:
\- Non-roaming case.
\- Roaming case, in HPLMN.
## 7.3 Location
### 7.3.1 General
This clause provides location reporting functionality for both UE location
obtained as part of normal network access or user service usage and location
actively triggered through location based services or other LALS reporting.
In addition, clause 7.3.4 describes Cell Supplemental Information (CSI) (e.g.,
civic address, _geographical_ coordinates, or operator specific information)
derived from CSP databases.
For all UE locations obtained, generated or reported to the MDF2, the POI
shall report the time at which the location was established by the location
source (e.g. AMF, MME or HSS/UDM) and provide this to the MDF along with the
location information.
For all UE locations obtained, generated or reported to the ICF, the IEF shall
report the time at which the location was established by the location source
(e.g. AMF) and provide this to the ICF along with the location information.
### 7.3.2 Service usage location reporting
#### 7.3.2.1 General
This clause specifies requirements relating to location reporting that is
obtained as part of target user usage of network services. Only location
reporting that is available as part of the network service being used by the
target user is specified in this clause.
#### 7.3.2.2 Embedded location reporting
This clause defines requirements for reporting of location when location is
provided as part of other associated interception information sent from the
POI to the MDF2.
Location shall be available at the start and end of a user communication. In
addition, where available, a POI shall be able to provide location updates to
the MDF2 (e.g. due to UE mobility at the AMF or MME).
The following information shall be transferred from the POI to the MDF2 as
part of POI events for which location reporting is required:
\- Target location(s).
\- Date/time of UE location(s) (if target location provided).
\- Source location information (if target location provided).
#### 7.3.2.3 Separated location reporting
This clause defines a dedicated location reporting event when location cannot
be reported (or is not available) at the same time as the POI output event for
which the location was required is sent to the MDF2. The event shall also be
used when an updated location becomes available and no other suitable POI
output event message is triggered (e.g. mid- session location update).
Location reporting availability shall be the same as for embedded location
reporting in clause 7.3.2.2.
The following information needs to be transferred from the POI to the MDF2 in
order to enable a MDF2 to perform its functionality:
\- Target identity.
\- Event date/time.
\- Target location(s).
\- Date/time of UE location(s).
\- Nature and identity of the POI.
\- Location source(s).
### 7.3.3 Lawful Access Location Services (LALS)
#### 7.3.3.1 General
LALS provides lawful access to the target\'s location. LALS is based on the
Location Services (LCS) capabilities defined in TS 23.271 [5], TS 23.273 [30]
and inOMA MLP [6]. The 5G Core Network support of LCS is described in TS
23.501 [2] clause 4.4.4 and TS 23.502 [4] clause 4.13.5.
LALS shall adhere to the requirements in TS 33.126 [3] clauses 6.6 (Security)
and 6.3 (Detect and Capture). The LCS supporting LALS shall be able to provide
priority to LALS requests. The subscriber location privacy settings shall be
overridden for LALS by setting the privacy override indicator to \"override\"
in the LI LCS client profile in the GMLC (see TS 23.273 [30] clause 5.4.4).
For inbound roaming targets, the VPLMN LCS functional entities fulfilling LALS
requests, by default, shall not communicate with the target\'s HPLMN, as it
may cause detectability issues, but rather the GMLC shall be able to determine
the serving AMF/MME from which it can acquire the inbound roaming target\'s
location. Detectability issues may also exist when LALS is invoked for
outbound roaming targets. This means by default, the GMLC shall refrain from
performing the positioning of an outbound roaming target.
NOTE 0: The visited GMLC may send the location request to all the AMF/MME of
the VPLMN. If the visited GMLC has knowledge of the last AMF/MME serving the
target UE, it may use that one in the first attempt.
Depending on national requirements and LCS capabilities of the CSP, the
location information provided by LALS may vary in location information types
(mobile network cell ID, location shape and geo-coordinates, civic address, or
a combination of those), in the set of additional location parameters (map
data, motion state, speed, etc.), as well as in the accuracy of provided
location information.
NOTE 1: The accuracy of positioning is, usually, a trade-off for the location
acquisition delay. It also depends on other positioning technology specific
factors.
The parameters controlling the LALS output are either delivered per warrant
over the LI_X1 interface from the ADMF to the LI-LCS Client, or to the
Location Triggering Function (LTF, see clause 7.3.3.3), or are pre-configured
in the LI-LCS Client. The LI-LCS Client is a special type of IRI-POI in the
CSP network fulfilling the role of the LCS client for LALS purposes. As such,
the LI-LCS client shall support all the requirements and interfaces in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.273 [30] for an LCS client.
NOTE 2: The LI-LCS Client profile at GMLC is to be provisioned and accessed by
authorized personnel only. The mechanism of this functionality is outside the
scope of the present document.
There are two types of the location interception defined in the present
document: target positioning and triggered location.
Target positioning determines the target\'s location independently of the
services used by the target.
Triggered location determines the LALS based location of the target when
specific network or service events related to the target occur.
The warrant for target positioning and for triggered location of the same
target may be independent of each other and may be overlapping in time or
combined in a single intercept warrant by the LEA.
There may be multiple active LALS warrants from different LEAs at any given
time.
#### 7.3.3.2 Target positioning
##### 7.3.3.2.1 General
As required by TS 33.126 [3] R6.3 -- 370, the location provision variants
supported in the current document are immediate location and periodic
location.
The LI-LCS client shall include an IRI-POI that has the LI capabilities to
generate the target UE's location related xIRI.
Figure 7.3-1 shows the architecture for LALS where the LI-LCS client provides
the target\'s location and associated information towards the MDF2 over the
LI_X2 interface as per the ADMF request for target positioning delivered over
LI_X1 interface.
Figure 7.3-1: LALS model for target positioning
NOTE: The Le interface is specified in OMA MLP [6].
##### 7.3.3.2.2 Immediate location provision
The request for immediate location provision is delivered to the LI-LCS client
over the LI_X1 interface. Upon receiving the request, the LI-LCS client
initiates a Location Immediate Request (LIR, see TS 23.271 [5]) to the LCS
Server/GMLC supporting LALS over the Le interface and reports the acquired
location to the MDF2 over LI_X2.
While waiting for a response to an LIR from the LCS Server/GMLC, the LI-LCS
client may receive and process additional LIRs from the ADMF over the LI_X1.
NOTE: The LCS Server/GMLC supporting LALS can be optimized to provide the same
single location estimation in response to multiple positioning requests
arriving in temporal proximity of each other.
The resulting immediate location information shall be delivered by the LI-LCS
client as xIRI over LI_X2 to the MDF2. The MDF2 generates and delivers the IRI
messages based on received xIRI to the LEMF over LI_H2.
##### 7.3.3.2.3 Periodic location provision
The request for periodic location provision is delivered to the LI-LCS client
over the LI_X1 interface.
The request for periodic location from the ADMF to the LI-LCS client may
include a set of parameters defining the duration of reporting, report
periodicity, etc. The description of the service response parameters is
provided in clause 7.3.3.4. The periodic location result shall be delivered by
the LI-LCS client as xIRI over LI_X2 to the MDF2. The MDF2 generates and
delivers the IRI messages based on received xIRI to the LEMF over LI_H2.
The periodicity of the LALS reports shall be controlled by the LI-LCS client.
The LI-LCS client shall issue a series of Location Immediate Requests (LIR,
see TS 23.271 [5]) at required time intervals.
#### 7.3.3.3 Triggered location
The Triggered location is the capability of providing LALS based location
information when specific network or service events related to the target
occur. While IRI generated by the event that also triggers the LALS may have
the location information included (in the form of cell ID), LALS may provide
additional location parameters, such as the target geo-location, velocity,
etc. (see TS 33.126 [3] R6.3 -- 270). The triggered location reporting
utilizes the immediate location variant.
The LALS triggered location architecture in figures 7.3-2 and 7.3-3 depicts
the Location Triggering Function (LTF). The LTF is an IRI-TF and resides in
the same NF (e.g. AMF) that has the IRI-POI or in an MDF2. The LTF is
responsible for triggering the IRI-POI in the LI-LCS Client when a specific
event related to the target is observed at the co-located IRI-POI or received
at the MDF2 in which the LTF is residing.
Figure 7.3-2 depicts the architecture of Triggered Location for IRI
acquisition and delivery for the case when the LTF is residing in the same NF
that has the IRI-POI reporting IRI events for the target.
Figure 7.3-2: LALS model for triggered location (POI/LTF option)
NOTE 1: The IRI-POI and LTF represented in figure 7.3-2 are logical functions
and require correlation information be shared between them; they may be
handled by the same process within the NF.
Figure 7.3-3 depicts the architecture of triggered location acquisition and
delivery for the case when the LTF is embedded into an MDF2.
Figure 7.3-3: LALS Model for triggered location (MDF/LTF option)
In case of triggered location, the LTF (present in either an NF hosting an
IRI-POI or in a MDF2) is provisioned by the ADMF over LI_X1 interface.
As part of this request, the ADMF provides the address for the LTF to reach
the LI-LCS client for use on the LI_T2 interface. The IRI-POI (s) or the MDF2
then arm the LTF(s).
The LTF triggers the LI-LCS client over the LI_T2 interface.
The LALS result is delivered to MDF2 from the LI-LCS Client as xIRI over the
LI_X2 interface asynchronously with the associated IRI events delivered by the
IRI-POI. To enable correlation between the LALS reports and the associated IRI
events, the LTF shall include the correlation information of the IRI event, if
provided by the IRI-POI, into the LI_T2 trigger.
NOTE 2: The IRI events may contain the location information obtained by other
means, e.g. NPLI. The LALS reports are augmenting that information with extra
details and accuracy.
#### 7.3.3.4 LI_X2 interface for target positioning and triggered location
The following information needs to be delivered from the LI-LCS Client to MDF2
in order to enable the MDF2 to format and deliver LALS intercept product to
LEMF:
\- Target identity.
\- Target reported location(s).
\- Date/time(s) location(s) established by reporting function.
\- Additional location parameters based on operator policy.
\- Correlation information.
### 7.3.4 Cell database information reporting
When a cell identity is provided for the target\'s location in an IRI message,
the CSP may also provide CSI for the reported cell identity. The MDF2 may
retrieve CSI by access to a CSP maintained database (referred to as CSP Cell
Database) as shown in figure 7.3.4-1. The CSP delivers the CSI either via the
IRI message generated from the corresponding xIRI, or asynchronously in a
stand-alone Cell Site Report (CSR) IRI message.
The following information shall be delivered when CSI is provided in IRI
message or a MDF2 generated CSR:
\- LIID.
\- Cell identity.
\- Date/time(s) established by MDF2.
\- Cell supplemental information.
Cell supplemental information (CSI) shall include the physical location (e.g.
geographical coordinates) information for the reported cell. If the reported
cell is not fixed to a permanent location, the report should indicate the cell
mobility type (e.g. nomadic cell, vehicle-mounted cell) as well as the time
period of the location validity.
If CSI for a cell identity has been previously reported to the LEMF for the
current interception, CSI may be omitted, if allowed by the warrant.

real-time means.

### 7.4.2 Architecture
#### 7.4.2.1 Overview
The capabilities defined in this clause apply to the interception of IMS-based
services. The target of interception can be a subscriber of the CSP, an
inbound roamer or a non-local ID.
The network function involved in providing the interception of IMS-based
services are determined based on the deployment option, the network
configuration, LI service scope and the IMS session including the roaming
scenarios. The IRI-POI functions are provided by the network functions that
handle the SIP messages (those network functions are referred to as IMS
Signalling Functions) and the triggered CC-POI functions are provided by the
network functions that handle the media (these network functions are referred
to as IMS Media Functions). The CC-TF functions are also provided by the
network functions that handle the SIP messages (referred to as IMS Signalling
Functions) and manage the IMS Media Functions. The network functions that
provide the CC-TF functions can be different from the network functions that
provide the IRI-POI functions.
An architecture depicting the LI for IMS is depicted in figure 7.4-2 below.
Figure 7.4-2: IMS LI architecture
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides it to the LIPF. The LIPF
present in the ADMF provisions IRI-POI, CC-TF, MDF2 and MDF3 over the LI_X1
interfaces.
The CC-TF sends the CC intercept trigger to the CC-POI over LI_T3 interface.
The IRI-POI generates the xIRI and delivers the same to the MDF2 over LI_X2
interface. The CC-POI generates the xCC and delivers the same to the MDF3 over
LI_X3 interface.
The MDF2 generates IRI messages from the received xIRI and delivers those IRI
messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2 interface. The MDF3 generates the CC from the
received xCC and delivers that CC to the LEMF over LI_HI3 interface.
The network configuration and IMS service scenarios including the roaming
scenarios determine the network functions that provide the IRI-POI, CC-TF and
CC-POI functions. The network function that provides the IRI-POI or CC-TF is
referred to as IMS Signalling Function in figure 7.4-2 and the network
function that provides the CC-POI functions is referred to as IMS Media
Function in figure 7.4-1.
NOTE: The details of correlation between the xIRI and the xCC when IRI-POI and
CC-TF are not co-located is not defined in the present document. The IRI-POI
and CC-TF are logical functions and they may be handled by the same process
when they are co-located in the same IMS Signalling Function.
#### 7.4.2.2 Target identities
The LIPF provisions the intercept related information associated with the
following target identities to the IRI-POI and CC-TF present in the IMS
Signalling Functions:
\- IMPU.
\- IMPI.
\- PEI (IMEI only).
\- IMEI.
The IRI-POI and CC-TF shall also support interception of non-local identities
in any of the IMPU formats (SIP URI, TEL URI as well as the E.164 number in a
SIP URI or TEL URI). In case a PBX is connected to a PLMN, the interception of
targets that are served by PBX may be treated as non-local identities in the
connected PLMN.
NOTE It is assumed that GPSI/MSISDN is mapped to IMPU, and SUPI/IMSI is mapped
to IMPI.
#### 7.4.2.3 Target identification
Depending on the session direction, different SIP parameters are used to
identify the target subscriber.
Further details on the use of SIP parameters in identifying a target is
described in TS 33.128 [15].
### 7.4.3 IRI-POI
#### 7.4.3.1 General
The IRI-POI detects the SIP messages that are related to a target subscriber
and then generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2.
The following IMS Network Functions (i.e. IMS Signalling Functions) that
handle SIP signalling for IMS sessions may provide the IRI-POI functions:
\- S-CSCF.
\- E-CSCF.
\- P-CSCF.
\- IBCF.
\- MGCF.
\- Conference AS/MRFC.
\- Telephony AS.
\- PTC server.
Clause 7.4.6 gives more information from network topology/session perspective
how different IMS Network Functions are to be used in providing the IRI-POI
functions. The Telephony AS is one of the IMS Network Functions that provides
the IRI-POI for STIR/SHAKEN and RCD/eCNAM (see clause 7.14.2).
#### 7.4.3.2 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the IMS Signalling Function generates the following
xIRI:
\- Encapsulated SIP message.
\- CC unavailable in serving PLMN.
\- Start of interception with an established IMS session.
The encapsulated SIP message xIRI is generated and delivered to the MDF2 when
the IRI-POI in the IMS Signalling Function detects that a SIP message is
received from, or sent to, a target or processed on behalf of a target at the
IMS Signalling Function.
The CC unavailable in PLMN xIRI is generated and delivered to the MDF2 for the
session scenarios where access to the target media is not available to the CSP
(see clause 7.4.7.1).
The start of interception with an established IMS session xIRI is generated
when an interception is activated on an established IMS session. To support
the possibility of generating such an xIRI, the IMS Signalling Function shall
store and maintain the session related information including the media
information for the life of all IMS sessions.
#### 7.4.3.3 Common IRI parameters
The list of parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15]. Each xIRI
shall include at the minimum the following information:
\- Target identity.
\- Additional identities associated with the target as observed by the IRI-
POI.
\- Time stamp.
\- Correlation information.
#### 7.4.3.4 Specific IRI parameters
The parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15].
### 7.4.4 CC-TF and CC-POI
#### 7.4.4.1 General
The CC-TF detects the SIP messages that are related a target and then
generates and sends a trigger to the CC-POI over the LI_T3 reference point.
The CC-POI based on the trigger detects the media to be intercepted, generates
the xCC and delivers the same to the MDF3.
The following IMS Network Functions (i.e. IMS Media Functions and IMS
Signalling Functions) may provide the CC-POI and CC-TF functions:
\- IMS-AGW with CC-TF in P-CSCF.
\- TrGW with CC-TF in IBCF.
\- IM-MGW with CC-TF in MGCF.
\- MRFP with CC-TF in AS/MRFC (see NOTE 3).
\- MRFP with CC-TF in Conference AS/MRFC (see NOTE 2).
\- PTC Server with CC-TF in PTC Server (see NOTE 1).
Clause 7.4.6 gives more information from network topology/session perspective
how different IMS Network Functions are to be used in providing the CC-TF/CC-
POI functions.
NOTE 1: The PTC Server provides the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions, accordingly,
PTC Server itself is the CC-TF.
NOTE 2: Conference AS, MRFC and MRFP together are referred to as Conference
Server. Conference AS/MRFC provide the conference focus functions as defined
in TS 24.147 [28].
NOTE 3: When music tone or announcement is given to the calling user prior to
answer on an incoming call to the target.
#### 7.4.4.2 CC intercept trigger
The CC-TF shall send CC intercept trigger to the CC-POI over LI_T3. The CC
intercept trigger, at the minimum, shall consist of the following:
\- Correlation Identifier.
\- Media Identifier (e.g. SDP information).
The Correlation Identifier is used to correlate the xCC with the corresponding
xIRI and is delivered from the CC-POI over the LI_X3 interface to the MDF3.
The Media Identifier is used to identify the media packets that have to be
intercepted.
#### 7.4.4.3 Common CC parameters
For the delivery of intercepted media packets, the following information shall
be passed from the CC-POI to the MDF3 in addition to the intercepted media
packets:
\- Target identity.
\- Correlation identifier
\- Time stamp.
\- Direction (indicates media is from or to the target).
### 7.4.5 Correlation of xCC and xIRI
The IRI messages derived from the xIRI and CC derived from xCC for a session
shall be correlated to each other using the correlation information received
in the xIRI and xCC. The details of this are specified in TS 33.128 [15].
### 7.4.6 Network topologies
#### 7.4.6.1 General
The IMS Network Functions that provide the IRI-POI, CC-TF and CC-POI functions
can vary based on the network topology and session scenarios such as:
\- Network topologies:
\- Non-roaming.
\- Roaming case with Local Break Out (LBO), VPLMN.
\- Roaming case with LBO, HPLMN.
\- Roaming case with Home Routed (HR), VPLMN.
\- Roaming case with HR, in HPLMN.
\- Session types:
\- Normal sessions.
\- Emergency sessions.
\- Redirected sessions.
\- IMS specific services such as conferencing, PTC, music, announcements.
\- SMS over IMS.
\- Target type:
\- Non-local ID target.
A deployment option within the CSP may also have a role in selection of the
Network Functions. In the case of roaming case, the interception performed in
the VPLMN and HPLMN are based on separate independent warrants.
More detailed description of these scenarios is given in TS 33.128 [15].
#### 7.4.6.2 IMS Network Functions providing the IRI-POI
The IMS Network Functions that handle the target side of the session provide
the IRI-POI functions except when the alternate option is used for the non-
local ID target. When the alternate option is used for the non-local ID
target, the IMS network function that handles the session-leg of the local
served user connected directly to the non-local ID target.
Table 7.4.6.2-1 below identifies the IMS Network Functions in providing the
IRI-POI functions in a non-roaming case for various session scenarios.

P-CSCF (NOTE 3A)
NOTE 1: For originated emergency sessions (or SMS over IMS to emergency
services centre) handled in the fixed networks, where S-CSCF is also part of
an emergency session, the S-CSCF based IRI-POI as a deployment option may also
be considered.
NOTE 2: A conference ID can also be a target. Conf-AS stands for conference AS
(see NOTE 2 in clause 7.4.4.1). When a normal session is extended to a
conference session, the IMS signalling functions that provide the IRI-POI
functions prior to the conference may continue to provide the IRI-POI
functions in addition to the conference AS/MRFC.
NOTE 3: Non-roaming means that the local served user is non-roaming.
NOTE 3A: The default/alternate option used when the target is non-local ID is
mutually independent of default/alternate option used when the target is local
served user.
Table 7.4.6.2-2 below identifies the IMS Network Functions in providing the
IRI-POI functions in a roaming case for various session scenarios.

alternate option is used to provide the IRI-POI functions for the normal case.
NOTE 5: For the redirected do not answer related sessions, the IMS Network
Functions that provide the IRI-POI functions prior to the redirection are as
illustrated in table 7.4.6.2-2 (normal case) and after the redirection are as
illustrated in table 7.4.6.2-3.
The IMS Network Functions that provide the IRI-POI for STIR/SHAKEN and
RCD/eCNAM are listed in clause 7.14.2.
#### 7.4.6.3 IMS Network Functions providing the CC-TF and CC-POI functions
The IMS Network Functions that handle the target side (including the non-local
ID target) of the session provide the CC-TF and CC-POI functions. For
redirected scenarios, the IMS Network Functions that handle the redirected-to-
user side of the session provide the CC-TF and CC-POI functions.
Table 7.4.6.3-1 provides the IMS Network Functions that provide the CC-TF
functions when the CC-POI functions are provided by the IMS Media Functions as
indicated (also see clause 7.4.4.1).

that case, the P-CSCF provides the CC-TF functions for the CC-POI in the IMS-
AGW.
NOTE 5: This is applicable only for IMS sessions with home-routed media with a
TrGW present in the VPLMN.
### 7.4.7 Roaming cases
#### 7.4.7.1 Media unavailable in a roaming case
For roaming targets, depending on the roaming architecture deployed, media of
the target may not enter the HPLMN for certain session scenarios. In such
situations, the HPLMN served with the warrant shall be able to do the
following:
\- Perform the interception without the CC and report to the LEMF that the CC
is unavailable due to target\'s roaming situation. Note that the Serving
System message (reported by the UDM/HSS) also indicates to the LEMF that the
target is roaming.
\- When a new warrant is activated on a target with an ongoing IMS session
with the CC not available, the HPLMN serving the new warrant shall report the
CC unavailability indication to the LEMF associated with the new warrant.
See TS 33.128 [15] for the method used to report the CC unavailability
indication.
#### 7.4.7.2 S8HR
##### 7.4.7.2.1 Background
The term S8HR is used to denote the home-routed roaming architecture for VoEPS
UEs. Within the VPLMN with S8HR, the IMS signalling messages are carried over
the GTP tunnel that corresponds to the IMS signalling bearer and the media
packets are carried over the GTP tunnel that corresponds to the media bearer.
(i.e. a dedicated EPS Bearer is used to carry the media packets). The EPS
Bearer ID of the IMS signalling bearer is always linked to the dedicated EPS
Bearer used as a media bearer.
The SGW/PGW within the EPC may implement control plane and user plane
functions in a combined form or in a separated form. In a separated form, the
SGW-C/PGW-C provides the control plane functions and SGW-U/PGW-U provides the
user plane functions.
NOTE: With S8HR, the PGW (or PGW-C/PGW-U) resides in the HPLMN.
##### 7.4.7.2.2 LI architecture
The present document specifies two options for implementing the LI functions
for voice services with S8HR as the roaming architecture:
1\. Use the capabilities specified below in the present document for stage 2
and in TS 33.128 [15] for stage 3.
2\. Use the capabilities defined in TS 33.107 [11] and TS 33.108 [21] natively
as defined in those documents.
According to the present document, to provide the lawful interception of voice
services in the VPLMN with S8HR, the architecture presented in figure
7.4.7.4-1 is used with SGW-C providing the BBIFF-C and SGW-U providing the
BBIFF-U functions.
NOTE 1: The overall architecture and functions related to the lawful
interception of voice services of inbound roaming targets with S8HR as the
roaming architecture is also referred in the present document as S8HR LI.
NOTE 2: The LI functions for SGW in a combined form can be visualized
presuming that SGW-C and SGW-U are provided by the same network function. In
this mode, the BBIFF-C and BBIFF-U functions are provided by BBIFF.
S8HR LI solution requires that Access Point Name (APN) can be identified as
being used for S8HR and therefore can be used to identify that the EPS Bearers
are used for inbound roamers with S8HR.
##### 7.4.7.2.3 S8HR LI Process
For the describing the S8HR LI process, the following terms apply:
\- The packet data connection representing the IMS signalling channel
referenced in clause 7.4.7.4.11 is referred to as IMS signalling bearer. This
is also referred to as the default bearer and uses the QCI value of 5, GSMA
IR.92 [26].
\- The packet data connection representing the IMS media channel referenced in
clause 7.4.7.4.11 is referred to as IMS media bearer. This is a dedicated
bearer and uses the QCI value of 1 for voice media, GSMA IR.92 [26].
\- The IMS signalling bearer and IMS media bearers are on separate GTP tunnels
but are linked.
The S8HR LI process follows the steps described in clause 7.4.7.4.11 with the
following specific aspects that apply to S8HR:
\- The LIPF configures the BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C to notify the LMISF-
IRI whenever an IMS signalling bearer or an IMS media bearer is created,
modified, or deleted for S8HR inbound roaming UEs (i.e. the UEs that use S8HR
APN).
\- The BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C notifies the LMISF-IRI whenever it detects
that such an IMS signalling bearer or an IMS media bearer is created,
modified, or deleted.
\- When the LMISF-IRI detects that IMS voice media interception is required,
the LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C to deliver the user
plane packets from the related IMS voice media bearer to the LMISF-CC.
NOTE 1: The LMISF-IRI includes the target UE location (when required) in the
xIRI based on the UE location that it receives within the messages that denote
the creation, modification, or deletion of IMS signalling or media bearers.
NOTE 2: When a target UE is involved in more than one IMS session, the release
of an IMS session will not result in the BBIFF-U stopping the delivery of the
user plane packets from the IMS media bearer since the IMS media bearer may
still be active for that target UE.
##### 7.4.7.2.4 CC intercept trigger
The CC-POI and IRI-POI functions are provided by the embedded functions LMISF-
CC and LMISF-IRI within the LMISF. As such the only interaction required
between the two is to establish the correlation between the xCC and xIRI at an
IMS session-leg level.
The LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C to deliver the user
plane packets (to LMISF-CC) from the IMS media bearer linked to the IMS
signalling bearer when it determines that an IMS session is associated with a
target and requires CC interception. The BBIFF-C forwards the instruction
along with the linked IMS signalling bearer information to BBIFF-U present in
the SGW-U.
##### 7.4.7.2.5 S8HR LI and Target UE Mobility
During a session that involves the target UE, the SGW-C/SGW-U associated with
the BBIFF-C/BBIFF U can change.
To support the continued interception of IMS sessions, the BBIFF-C in the new
SGW-C notifies the LMISF-IRI that a BBIFF relocation has occurred.
The LMISF-IRI provides the functions described in clause 7.4.7.4.12 to support
the continued and correlated interception for the CC.
NOTE: The LMISF should not disrupt the ongoing interception, if an IMS
signalling bearer deletion notification is received from the BBIFF-C present
in the old SGW-C.
#### 7.4.7.3 N9HR
##### 7.4.7.3.1 Background
The term N9HR is used to denote the home-routed roaming architecture for Vo5GS
UEs. Within the VPLMN with N9HR, the IMS signalling messages and media packets
are carried over the GTP tunnel that corresponds to the PDU session
established for the UE for IMS based services.
The IMS signalling packets and the media packets are on separate Quality of
Service (QoS) Flows with specific 5QI values (5QI = 5 for IMS signalling and
5QI = 1 for voice, GSMA NG.114 [27]). The H-SMF in the HPLMN assigns a
separate QoS Flow Index (QFI) for IMS signalling related packets and IMS voice
related packets. The UPF in the VPLMN can isolate the IMS signalling and media
related packets from user plane packets based on the QFI value.
##### 7.4.7.3.2 LI architecture
To provide the lawful interception of voice services in the VPLMN with N9HR,
the architecture presented in figure 7.4.7.4-1 is used with SMF providing the
BBIFF-C and UPF providing the BBIFF-U functions.
NOTE: The overall architecture and functions related to the lawful
interception of voice services of inbound roaming targets with N9HR as the
roaming architecture is also referred in the present document as N9HR LI.
N9HR LI requires that a Data Network Name (DNN) can be identified as being
used for N9HR and therefore can be used to identify that PDU sessions are used
for inbound roamers with N9HR.
The BBIFF-C and BBIFF-U functions are provided by adopting a subset of LI
functions defined for LI at SMF/UPF as defined in clause 6.2.3 and TS 33.128
[15].
##### 7.4.7.3.3 N9HR LI Process
For the purposes of describing the N9HR LI process, the following terms apply:
\- The packet data connection representing the IMS signalling channel
referenced in clause 7.4.7.4.11 is referred to as PDU session with IMS
signalling related QoS flow.
\- The packet data connection representing the IMS media channel referenced in
clause 7.4.7.4.11 is referred to as PDU session with IMS media related QoS
flow.
The IMS signalling and the IMS voice media are on the same PDU session.
NOTE 1: The QoS flow associated with the IMS signalling related user plane
packets have the 5QI value 5, GSMA NG.114 [27] and such user plane packets can
be identified at the BBIFF-U in UPF with the assigned QFI value.
NOTE 2: The QoS flow associated with the IMS voice media related user plane
packets have the 5QI value 1, GSMA NG.114 [27] and such user plane packets can
be identified at the BBIFF-U in UPF with the assigned QFI value.
The N9HR LI process follows the steps described in clause 7.4.7.4.11 with the
following specific aspects that apply to N9HR:
\- The LIPF configures the BBIFF-C present in the SMF to notify the LMISF-IRI
whenever a PDU session is created, modified, or deleted for inbounding roaming
UEs with an N9HR DNN.
\- The BBIFF-C present in the SMF notifies the LMISF-IRI whenever it detects
that a PDU session is created, modified, or deleted for inbound roaming UEs
with N9HR DNN. The UE location information and the PDU session ID is included
in such notifications.
\- When the LMISF-IRI determines that IMS voice media interception is
required, the LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C present in the SMF with the PDU
session information that the IMS voice media related user plane packets from
that PDU session are to be delivered to LMISF-CC.
NOTE 3: The LMISF-IRI includes the target UE location (when required) in the
xIRI based on the UE location that it receives within the messages that denote
the creation, modification, or deletion of the PDU session.
NOTE 4: When a target UE is involved in more than one IMS session, the release
of an IMS session will not result in the BBIFF-U stopping delivery of IMS
media related user plane packets since the IMS media related QoS Flow may
still be active within the PDU session.
##### 7.4.7.3.4 CC intercept trigger
The CC-POI and IRI-POI functions are provided by the embedded functions LMISF-
CC and LMISF-IRI within the LMISF. As such the only interaction required
between the two is to establish the correlation between the xCC and xIRI at an
IMS session-leg level.
The LMISF instructs the BBIFF-C present in the SMF to deliver to (to LMISF-CC)
the IMS voice media related user plane packets from the PDU session associated
with the intercepted IMS session. The BBIFF-C present in the SMF forwards the
instruction along with the PDU session information to BBIFF-U present in the
UPF.
##### 7.4.7.3.5 N9HR LI and Target UE Mobility
During a session that involves the target UE, the SMF that has the BBIFF-C, or
the UPF that has the BBIFF-U can change.
To support the continued interception of IMS sessions, the BBIFF-C in the new
SMF notifies the LMISF-IRI that a BBIFF (i.e., SMF or UPF) relocation has
occurred.
The LMISF-IRI provides the functions described in clause 7.4.7.4.12 to support
the continued and correlated interception of CC.
NOTE: The LMISF should not disrupt the ongoing interception, if a PDU session
deletion related notification is received from the BBIFF-C present in the old
SMF.
#### 7.4.7.4 LI in VPLMN with home-routed roaming architecture
##### 7.4.7.4.1 Background
With home-routed roaming architecture, all the IMS Signalling Functions and
IMS Media Functions reside in the HPLMN. National regulations may still
require the VPLMN to have the capabilities to perform the lawful interception
of voice services involving the inbound roaming targets. The LI capabilities
provided in the VPLMN with home-routed roaming architecture shall be to the
same extent as the LI capabilities provided in the VPLMN with LBO approach as
the roaming architecture.
The IMS signalling messages are exchanged between the UE and the P-CSCF (in
HPLMN) and the media is exchanged between the UE and the IMS-AGW (in HPLMN).
##### 7.4.7.4.2 LI architecture
To provide the lawful interception of voice services in the VPLMN with home-
routed roaming architecture, new LI-specific functions are introduced to
examine the packets that flow through the VPLMN packet core network functions
in order to generate IRI and CC when the communication involves an inbound
roaming target.
Figure 7.4.7.4-1 shown below illustrates a generic LI architecture for home-
routed roaming architecture in the VPLMN.
Figure 7.4.7.4-1: VPLMN generic LI architecture for home-routed roaming
NOTE: See clause 7.4.7.4.10 for brief descriptions of the LI functions and
interfaces depicted in figure 7.4.7.4-1.
##### 7.4.7.4.3 Target identifiers
The target identifiers used for inbound roaming UEs are same as the
identifiers used for IMS sessions in the VPLMN with LBO as the roaming
architecture. See clause 7.4.2.2 for further details.
##### 7.4.7.4.4 Target identification
Depending on the session direction, different SIP parameters are used to
identify the target. The SIP parameters used to identify the target can be
different from the SIP parameters used to identify a target at the P-CSCF
(with LBO as the roaming architecture).
Further details on the use of SIP parameters in identifying a target are
described in TS 33.128 [15].
##### 7.4.7.4.5 IRI events
The IRI events are same as the xIRI defined for IMS sessions in the VPLMN with
LBO as the roaming architecture. See clause 7.4.3.2 for details.
##### 7.4.7.4.6 IRI parameters
The IRI parameters are the same as those defined for IMS sessions in the VPLMN
with LBO as the roaming architecture. See clauses 7.4.3.3 and 7.4.3.4 for
details.
##### 7.4.7.4.7 CC intercept trigger
The LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C (over the LI_T1 interface) to deliver the
IMS media packets when it determines that an IMS session is associated with a
target and requires CC interception. The BBIFF-C forwards the instruction to
BBIFF-U over the LI_T3 interface.
##### 7.4.7.4.8 CC parameters
The CC parameters are the same as those defined for IMS sessions in the VPLMN
with LBO as the roaming architecture. See clause 7.4.4.3 for details.
##### 7.4.7.4.9 Correlation of xCC and xIRI
The LMISF assigns the correlation number for an IMS session and uses the same
correlation number in the associated xIRI and xCC. The interaction between the
LMISF-IRI that generates the xIRI and LMISF-CC that generates the xCC is an
internal function of LMISF.
##### 7.4.7.4.10 LI specific functions and interfaces
The additional LI specific functions and interfaces introduced to support the
LI with home-routed roaming architecture shown in figure 7.4.7.4-1 are listed
below:
\- LMISF (LI Mirror IMS State Function): A logical LI specific function that
provides the IMS state function for LI purposes. The LMISF provides the IRI-
POI and CC-POI functions. The LMISF also initiates the required trigger for
IMS media interception. The LMISF may be viewed as consisting of two embedded
functions: 1) LMISF-IRI (handling the IMS signalling related LI functions,
i.e. IRI-POI), 2) LMISF-CC (handling the IMS media related LI functions, i.e.
CC-POI). The interface between the two embedded functions is not defined.
NOTE 1: The present document assumes one LMISF per VPLMN for a given roaming
agreement.
NOTE 2: The term LMISF is used when a description applies to LMISF-IRI or
LMISF-CC.
\- BBIFF (Bearer Binding Intercept and Forward Function): Binds the IMS
signalling and media to the LMISF for interception purpose. The BBIFF may be
split into two BBIFF-C and BBIFF-U, with the former present in the NF that
provides the control plane related functions and the latter present in the NF
that provides the user plane related functions associated with the inbound
roaming UEs.
\- LI_X2_LITE: Used to carry the control plane information (e.g. packet data
connection related notifications, UE location) from BBIFF-C to LMISF-IRI.
\- LI_X3_LITE_S: Used to forward the IMS signalling related user plane packets
of inbound roaming UEs from BBIFF-U to the LMISF-IRI.
\- LI_X3_LITE_M: Used to forward the IMS media related user plane packets of
inbound roaming target UE from BBIFF-U to the LMISF-CC.
\- LI_T1: Used to instruct the BBIFF-C that user plane packets of the
associated IMS media need to be captured and delivered to the LMISF-CC.
\- LI_T3: Used to instruct the BBIFF-U to capture and deliver the selective
user plane packets of inbound roaming UEs to the LMISF.
The user plane packets reported by BBIFF-U include the IMS signalling related
packets and IMS media related packets. A condition required for this LI
architecture is that LMISF shall have access to the IMS signalling messages
and the IMS media packets in an unencrypted form.
NOTE 3: The LI functions available within the VPLMN network functions that
have access to the packet data connections that carry the IMS signalling and
IMS media may be used to provide the BBIFF-C, BBIFF-U functions.
##### 7.4.7.4.11 LI Process
The following steps happen for all home-routed inbound roaming UEs
irrespective of whether those UEs are associated with a target:
\- The LIPF configures the BBIFF-C (over LI_X1 interface) to notify the LMISF-
IRI whenever home-routed inbound roaming UEs establish, modify or delete the
IMS signalling and the IMS media channels. The UE exchanges the IMS signalling
messages with the P-CSCF residing in the HPLMN over the IMS signalling channel
and IMS media with the IMS-AGW residing in the HPLMN over the IMS media
channel. The LIPF also provides the same information to LMISF-IRI (over LI_X1
interface) in order to let it know the notifications to be expected from the
BBIFF-C.
NOTE 1: The term _channel_ is a generic term used in this description to
represent IMS signalling or media related packet data connection within a PDN
(Packet Data Network) connection.
\- The BBIFF-C notifies the LMISF-IRI (over LI_X2_LITE interface) whenever the
IMS signalling channel or the IMS media channel is established, modified or
deleted for home-routed inbound roaming UEs. The UE location information is
included in such notifications. The BBIFF-C instructs the BBIFF-U (over LI_T3
interface) to deliver the appropriate IMS signalling related user plane
packets to the LMISF-IRI.
\- The BBIFF-U delivers the IMS signalling related user plane packets to the
LMISF-IRI (over the LI_X3_LITE_S interface).
The following steps are performed for the target UEs:
\- The LIPF provisions the LMISF-IRI, MDF2 and MDF3 (over LI_X1 interface)
with the IMS target information.
\- When the received user plane packets from the BBIFF-U represent IMS
signalling messages associated with a target, the LMISF-IRI generates the xIRI
and delivers them to the MDF2 over the LI_X2 interface.
\- Upon identifying that IMS signalling messages are associated with a target
that requires CC interception, the LMISF-IRI instructs the BBIFF-C (over LI_T1
interface) that the user plane packets that represent associated IMS media
(i.e. from the IMS media channel associated with the IMS signalling channel)
are to be delivered to LMISF-CC.
\- The BBIFF-C instructs the BBIFF-U (over LI_T3 interface) to deliver user
plane packets that represent the associated IMS media to the LMISF-CC.
\- The BBIFF-U delivers the indicated user plane packets that represent the
IMS media to the LMISF-CC (over LI_X3_LITE_M interface). The LMISF-CC
generates xCC from the received IMS media related user plane packets and
delivers them to the MDF3 over LI_X3 interface along with the information that
correlates the xCC with the xIRI.
NOTE 2: LMISF-CC interacts with the LMISF-IRI to correlate the xCC with the
xIRI.
\- When all IMS sessions for a target UE have ended, LMISF-IRI instructs the
BBIFF-C (over LI_T1 interface) to stop the delivery of IMS media related user
plane packets. Upon receiving such a notification, the BBIFF-C instructs the
BBIFF-U (over LI_T3 interface) to stop the delivery of the IMS media related
user plane packets to the LMISF-CC.
NOTE 3: In the above steps, BBIFF-C and BBIFF-U functions are not aware of any
IMS target information (i.e. SIP URI or TEL URI).
NOTE 4: The LMISF-IRI includes the target UE location (when required) in the
xIRI based on the UE location that it receives from the BBIFF-C.
The LMISF-IRI stores the IMS signalling messages received from the BBIFF-U for
a potential future LI activation (i.e. mid-call interception). Furthermore,
the xCC generated from the IMS media related user plane packets may be
associated with different session-legs, and hence may have different
correlation numbers.
When the inbound roaming UE deregisters for the IMS signalling (i.e. with
HPLMN), the LMISF shall ensure that deregistration is mirrored in its own
maintained state for that UE.
##### 7.4.7.4.12 Target UE Mobility
During a session that involves the target UE, the network function associated
with the BBIFF-C, or the BBIFF U can change. The lawful interception of IMS
sessions involving a target shall continue when such a relocation happens. The
xIRI and xCC delivered before and after the relocation shall be correlated.
To support the continued interception of IMS sessions, the BBIFF-C in the new
network function notifies the LMISF-IRI (over LI_X2_LITE interface) that a
BBIFF relocation has occurred.
The LMISF-IRI provides the following functions to support the continued and
correlated interception of CC:
\- When a notification is received from the BBIFF-C that a BBIFF relocation
has occurred, examine to see whether any IMS session is setup for the UE and
is being intercepted.
\- If an intercepted IMS session is setup, examine to see whether a CC
interception for that IMS session is required.
\- If the intercepted IMS session requires CC interception, inform the new
BBIFF-C (over the LI_T1 interface) with an instruction that the user plane
packets that represent associated IMS media are to be delivered to LMISF-CC.
Further handling of CC interception is as defined in clause 7.4.7.4.11.
## 7.5 MMS
### 7.5.1 Overview
MMS service is defined in TS 22.140 [19], OMA\'s MMS Architecture OMA-AD-
MMS-V1_3-20110913-A [17], and OMA\'s Multimedia Messaging Service
Encapsulation Protocol OMA-TS-MMS_ENC-V1_3-20110913-A [18].
In a 3GPP network, the MMS Proxy-Relay handles the MMS related functions. More
specifically, the MMS Proxy-Relay is responsible for:
1) receiving an MMS from a served UE and forwarding that to the MMS Proxy-
Relay of the destination UE;
2) receiving an MMS from an originating MMS Proxy-Relay and forwarding this
MMS or a notification of it to its served UE;
3) receiving a request for retrieval of an MMS from a served UE and delivering
that MMS to the served UE;
4) providing the served UE with delivery status and read reports of served UE
originated MM;
5) providing an MMS/Relay of another UE with delivery status and read reports
of MMS received for the served UE.
### 7.5.2 LI at MMS Proxy-Relay
#### 7.5.2.1 Architecture
The MMS Proxy-Relay shall have LI capabilities to generate the target UE\'s
MMS related xIRI and xCC.
The IRI-POI present in the MMS Proxy-Relay detects the MMS related events,
generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2
delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.
When interception of communication contents is required, the CC-POI present in
the MMS Proxy-Relay generates the xCC from the MMS messages and delivers the
xCC (that includes the correlation number and the target identity) to the
MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over LI_HI3.
#### 7.5.2.2 Target Identities
The LIPF provisions the intercept related information associated with the
following target identities to the IRI-POI/CC-POI present in the MMS Proxy-
Relay:
\- Email Address.
\- GPSI.
\- IMPI.
\- IMPU.
\- IMSI.
\- SUPI.
The interception performed on the above identities are mutually independent,
even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other identities
when available. The IRI-POI and CC-POI present in the MMS Proxy-Relay shall
also support interception of non-local identities in any of the IMPU formats
(SIP URI, TEL URI as well as the E.164 number in a SIP URI or TEL URI), GPSI
formats (E.164 number, external identifier) and email address.
#### 7.5.2.3 IRI Events
The IRI-POI present in the MMS Proxy-Relay shall generate xIRI, when it
detects the following specific events or information:
\- An MMS message is sent by the target or sent to the target.
#### 7.5.2.4 Common IRI parameters
The list of xIRI parameters are specified in TS 33.128 [15]. Each xIRI shall
include at the minimum the following information:
\- Target identity.
\- Time stamp.
\- Correlation information (when xCC is also reported).
\- MMS related information.
#### 7.5.2.5 Specific IRI parameters
The parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15].
#### 7.5.2.6 CC
The MMS xCC is generated when the CC-POI in the MMS Proxy-Relay detects that
CC related to an MMS message is either received from the target, sent to the
target, or stored on behalf of the target.
#### 7.5.2.7 Network Topologies
LI at the MMS Proxy-Relay is only applicable at the HPLMN.
## 7.6 PTC service
### 7.6.1 General
In the present clause, \"PTC\" will be used to reference events or services
that occur in either of two different architectures unless specified
otherwise, e.g., Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) or Push to talk over
Cellular (PoC).
The following servers support PTC architecture:
> \- MCPTT servers (Including Common services core as defined in TS 23.280
> [24]).
>
> \- PoC servers (Including Shared XDMS as defined in OMA-AD-
> PoC-V2_1-20110802-A [25]).
The PTC server will be used to represent the MCPTT server or PoC server for
group communication services.
If two or more different parties involved in a PTC communication are each a
target of interception, each interception shall operate independently of the
others and the results of each intercept shall be delivered to the respective
LEMF in accordance with the applicable warrant.
### 7.6.2 Target identities
A provisioned target identity can be the following:
\- MCPTT ID.
\- Instance Identifier URN.
\- IMPU.
\- IMPI.
\- PTC Chat GroupID.
The interception performed on the above identities are mutually independent,
even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other identities
when available.
### 7.6.3 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the PTC Server shall generate xIRI when it detects the
following specific events or information:
\- PTC service registration.
\- PTC session initiation.

\- PTC party join.
\- PTC party drop.
\- PTC party hold.
\- PTC media modification.
\- PTC group advertisement.
\- PTC floor control.
\- PTC target presence.
\- PTC associate presence.
\- PTC list management.
\- PTC access policy.
The events above trigger the transmission of information from the IRI-POI to
the MDF2.
### 7.6.4 Common IRI parameters
Each xIRI shall include at the minimum the following information:
\- Target identity.
\- Time stamp.
\- Correlation information.
\- Location information (if required and available).
\- PTC related information (e.g., PTC group ID, PTC party).
\- Encryption parameters (if required and available).
\- Direction (floor control source or destination port).
### 7.6.5 Specific IRI parameters
The parameters in each xIRI are defined in TS 33.128 [15].
### 7.6.6 Common CC parameters
In addition to the intercepted content of communications, the following
information needs to be transferred from the CC-POI to the MDF3 in order to
allow the MDF3 to perform its functionality:
\- Target identity.
\- Correlation information.
\- Time stamp.
\- Identity of source of media (communications content) for group call.
### 7.6.7 Specific CC parameters
The parameters in xCC are defined in TS 33.128 [15].
### 7.6.8 Network topologies
The PTC server resides in the home network and shall provide IRI-POI and CC-
POI functionality.
## 7.7 Identity Caching Function
### 7.7.1 General
The ICF is responsible for receiving identity caching events from all IEFs in
the network over the LI_XER interface and handling queries from the IQF over
the LI_XQR interface to the IQF as defined in clause 5.7.
The temporary cache duration shall be configurable by the LICF on a per CSP
network basis.
NOTE: The terms identifier and identity are used interchangeably in clause
7.7. This also applies to the naming of functions like IQF.
### 7.7.2 ICF Query Identities
The IQF present in the ADMF shall be able to query the records held by the ICF
using one of the following target identifiers:
\- SUPI.
\- SUCI.
\- 5G-S-TMSI.
\- 5G-GUTI.
NOTE: Targeting based on GPSI, PEI, IMS identifiers or other legacy
identifiers (e.g. MSISDN) is not supported by the present document.
The list of event parameters is specified in TS 33.128 [15]. Each event shall
include at the minimum the following information:
\- Query target identifier.
\- Time of target identifier observation.
For queries based on temporary identifiers the following additional
information shall be included:
\- Tracking area identifier.
\- Cell identity.
### 7.7.3 ICF Response parameters
The list of event parameters is specified in TS 33.128 [15]. Each event shall
include at the minimum the following information:
\- Subscription permanent identifier.
\- Related temporary identifier(s).
\- Start of validity timestamp(s).
\- End of validity timestamp(s).
The following additional information shall be included if it was available in
the IEF records provided to the ICF:
> \- Permanent equipment identifier (PEI).
\- Generic Public Subscription Identifier (GPSI).
The following additional information shall be included when available and if
requested in the IQF to ICF query:
\- Location information (i.e. Cell identity and tracking area identifier).
### 7.7.4 Network topologies
Since the ICF caches events independently of network topology for individual
service usage UEs, no specific network topology handling is provided by the
ICF. The IQF shall be responsible for handling any network topology
requirements that may be applied by the LEA in an individual warrant.
## 7.8 Non-IP data delivery (NIDD) in 5GS
### 7.8.1 Background
#### 7.8.1.1 General
Functions for NIDD (Non-IP Data Delivery) may be used to handle Mobile
Originated (MO) and Mobile Terminated (MT) communication for unstructured data
(also referred to as Non-IP). Such delivery to an AF is accomplished by one of
the following two mechanisms (see TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.31.5):
\- Delivery using NEF.
\- Delivery using UPF via a Point-to-Point (PtP) N6 tunnel.
If the subscription includes a \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" corresponding to the
DNN and S-NSSAI information, then the SMF selects that NEF as the anchor of
this PDU session, otherwise, the SMF selects a UPF as the anchor of this PDU
session. If NEF is used, the NIDD traffic is forwarded by NEF to the AF. If
UPF is used, the NIDD traffic is forwarded by UPF to the AF.
NIDD applies to non-roaming and roaming with home-routed roaming architecture.
#### 7.8.1.2 NIDD in non-roaming situation
##### 7.8.1.2.1 Delivery using NEF
Figure 7.8-1 presents the architecture for delivery of NIDD using NEF in non-
roaming scenario. NIDD using NEF requires a control plane PDU session. The PDU
session is established between UE and NEF via AMF and SMF. The user traffic is
exchanged with DoNAS (Data over NAS) between UE and AMF, then over N11
interface between AMF and SMF, then over N29 interface between SMF and NEF and
finally over N33 interface between NEF and AF (see TS 23.502 [4] clause 4.25).
Figure 7.8-1: 5GS Architecture for NIDD using NEF
##### 7.8.1.2.2 Delivery using UPF via a PtP N6 tunnel
Figure 7.8-2 shows the architecture for delivery of NIDD using UPF via a PtP
N6 tunnel in non-roaming scenario. The user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS
between UE and AMF, over N11 interface between AMF and SMF, over N4 interface
between SMF and UPF and finally over PtP N6 tunnel between UPF and AF. The
tunnel is typically a UDP/IP tunnel.

Figure 7.8-2: 5GS Architecture for NIDD using a PtP N6 tunnel
#### 7.8.1.3 NIDD in roaming situation
##### 7.8.1.3.1 Delivery using NEF
In roaming scenario, the PDU session for NIDD using NEF is established between
the UE and NEF via V-AMF, V-SMF and H-SMF. The user traffic is exchanged with
DoNAS between UE and AMF, then over N11 interface between AMF and V-SMF, over
N16 interface between V-SMF and H-SMF and over N29 interface between SMF and
NEF and finally over N33 interface between NEF and AF. Figure 7.8-3 shows the
architecture for delivery of NIDD using NEF in roaming situation.
{width="6.3in" height="1.2319444444444445in"}
Figure 7.8-3: 5GS Architecture for NIDD using NEF in roaming situation
##### 7.8.1.3.2 Delivery using UPF via a PtP N6 tunnel
In roaming scenario, the user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS between UE and
AMF, over N11 interface between AMF and V-SMF, over N4 interface between V-SMF

### 7.8.2 LI for NIDD
#### 7.8.2.1 LI for NIDD using NEF
##### 7.8.2.1.1 General
In non-roaming scenario, only NEF will provide IRI-POI and CC-POI.
In roaming scenario, V-SMF shall provide the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions for
the visited network while NEF in the home network provides IRI-POI and CC-POI.
NOTE: Only home-routed mode applies.
LI for NIDD using NEF in the VPLMN is described in clause 7.8.2.1.2. LI for
NIDD using NEF in the HPLMN is described in clause 7.9.2.1.
Packet header reporting, non-3GPP access and MA-PDU session are not applicable
to NIDD.
##### 7.8.2.1.2 Architecture for NIDD using NEF in the VPLMN
This clause describes the LI for NIDD using NEF in the VPLMN. The access
method for the delivery of xCC related to NIDD using NEF is based on
duplication of packets without modification of the packets at the V-SMF (in
case of roaming) and NEF in the home network. The duplicated packets with
additional information in a header are sent to MDF3 via LI_X3 for further
delivery to the LEMF via LI_HI3. Figure 7.8-5 gives a reference point
representation of the LI architecture with V-SMF as a CP NF and UP NF
providing the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions for NIDD using NEF in the visited
network.
Figure 7.8-5: LI architecture for NIDD using NEF showing LI at V-SMF
##### 7.8.2.1.3 Target identifiers
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the AMF:
\- SUPI.
\- PEI.
\- GPSI.
The interception performed on the above three identities are mutually
independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other
identities when available.
##### 7.8.2.1.4 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the V-SMF handles the same records included in xIRIs
for NIDD using NEF as those identified in clause 6.2.3.3:
\- PDU session establishment.
\- PDU session modification.
\- PDU session release.
\- Start of interception with established PDU session.
\- Unsuccessful procedure.
For NIDD using NEF with or without roaming situation, the IRI-POI present in
the H-SMF shall avoid generating xIRIs since NEF always provides the xIRIs for
the home network.
#### 7.8.2.2 LI for NIDD using a PtP N6 tunnel
In non-roaming scenario, the SMF will provide an IRI POI while UPF shall
include a CC-POI.
In roaming scenario, V-SMF and H-SMF shall provide the IRI-POI and V-UPF and
H-UPF shall include the CC-POI function as shown in figure 6.2-4 which also
concerns IRI-POI and CC-POI functions for IP-based and Ethernet-based PDU
sessions.
NOTE: Only home-routed mode applies.
The LI architecture for SMF/UPF for NIDD using a PtP N6 tunnel is the same as
presented in figure 6.2-4.
However, the user plane packets between UE and UPF flow through the SMF as
shown in figures 7.8-2 and 7.8-4.
The same xIRIs defined in clause 6.2.3.3. for PDU sessions of IP or Ethernet
type and the same xCC are also considered for PDU sessions for NIDD using a
PtP N6 tunnel, considering unstructured payload format.
## 7.9 LI at NEF
### 7.9.1 General
The present document specifies NEF as POI for:
\- NIDD.
\- Device triggering.
\- MSISDN-less MO SMS.
\- Parameter provisioning.
### 7.9.2 LI for NIDD using NEF
#### 7.9.2.1 Architecture
The NEF shall provide both IRI-POI and CC-POI functions. Figure 7.9-1 gives a
reference point representation of the LI architecture with NEF as a CP NF and
UP NF providing the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions. NEF is the anchor point for
PDU session establishment and NIDD traffic. The NIDD traffic is forwarded by
NEF to the AF over the N33 interface.
Figure 7.9-1: LI architecture for NIDD using NEF showing LI at NEF
#### 7.9.2.2 Target Identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the NEF:
\- SUPI.
\- GPSI.
The interception performed on the above two identities are mutually
independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other
identities when available.
#### 7.9.2.3 IRI events
NEF handles xIRIs including the following records for NIDD using NEF in both
roaming and non-roaming situations:
\- PDU session establishment.
\- PDU session modification.
\- PDU session release.
\- Start of interception with established PDU session.
\- Unsuccessful procedure.
The PDU session establishment xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the NEF detects that a PDU session for NIDD using NEF has been established for
the target UE. The NEF plays the role of anchor point for that PDU session.
The PDU session modification xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
NEF detects that a PDU session for NIDD using NEF is modified for the target
UE.
The PDU session release xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the NEF
detects that a PDU session for NIDD using NEF is released for the target UE.
The start of interception with an established PDU session xIRI is generated
when the IRI-POI present in the NEF detects that interception is activated on
the target UE that has an already established PDU session for NIDD using NEF
in the 5GS. When a target UE has multiple PDU sessions, this xIRI shall be
sent for each PDU session with a different value of correlation information.
When additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to
generate and deliver the start of interception with an established PDU session
related IRI messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants without
receiving the corresponding start of interception with an established PDU
session xIRI.
The unsuccessful procedure xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
NEF detects an unsuccessful procedure for PDU session establishment,
modification or release.
NEF handles xCC for NIDD using NEF if CC is requested.
### 7.9.3 LI for device triggering
#### 7.9.3.1 Background
Device triggering is the means by which an AF sends information to the UE via
the NEF to trigger the UE to perform application specific actions that include
initiating communication with the AF (see TS 23.502 [4] clause 4.13.2 and TS
29.522 [31] clause 4.4.3).
The device trigger request is authorized by NEF by submitting the GPSI of the
UE to the UDM. After successful authorization, NEF forwards the Device trigger
request with the SUPI of the UE to the corresponding SM-SC to be delivered to
that UE. The 5GS architecture for Device triggering is presented in figure
7.9-2.
The device trigger may be recalled or replaced by the AF if the UE is not
reachable at the time the AF has delivered the device trigger to the UE.
Figure 7.9-2: 5GS architecture for device triggering
#### 7.9.3.2 Architecture
Figure 7.9-1 without the CC-POI in NEF provides the architecture for LI for
device triggering.
#### 7.9.3.3 Target identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the NEF:
\- SUPI.
\- GPSI.
The interception performed on the above two identities are mutually
independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other
identities when available.
#### 7.9.3.4 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the NEF shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
following specific events or information related to the device triggering
service:
\- Device trigger.
\- Device trigger replacement.
\- Device trigger cancellation.
\- Device trigger report notification.
The device trigger xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the NEF
detects that a device trigger has been received from an AF and is delivered to
the SM-SC for the target UE.
The device trigger replacement xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the NEF detects that a device trigger replacement has been received from an AF
and delivered to the SM-SC to replace previously submitted device trigger
message which is not yet delivered to the target UE.
The device trigger cancellation xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the NEF
detects that a device trigger cancellation has been received from an AF and
delivered to the SM-SC to recall previously submitted device trigger which is
not yet delivered to the target UE.
The device trigger report notification xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI
present in the NEF detects that a device trigger report is returned to the AF
with a cause value indicating the trigger delivery outcome (e.g. succeeded,
unknown or failed and the reason for the failure).
### 7.9.4 LI for MSISDN-less MO SMS
#### 7.9.4.1 Background
An MSISDN-less MO SMS is sent by a UE without MSISDN as originator and
received by a third party application as destination (i.e. AF) via SM-SC and
NEF as presented in figure 7.9-3. MSISDN-less means that the GPSI of the UE is
not an MSISDN but an External Identifier which form is username\@realm.
MSISDN-less MO-SMS service allows MSISDN-less UE to send small data to an AF
using SMS-MO. The SMS-MO received by the SM-SC through MO submission procedure
as defined in TS 23.040 [50], is directly forwarded to the NEF for further
transfer to the recipient AF (see TS 23.502 [4] clause 4.13.7 and TS 29.522
[31] clause 4.4.10).
The NEF queries the UDM with the SUPI of the UE, obtains the corresponding
GPSI of the UE sending the SMS, and forwards it to the AF including the GPSI
(i.e. external identifier) of the originating UE.
Figure 7.9-3: 5GS architecture for MSISDN-less MO SMS
#### 7.9.4.2 Architecture
Figure 7.9-1 without the CC-POI in NEF provides the architecture for LI for
MSISN-less MO SMS.
#### 7.9.4.3 Target identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the NEF:
\- SUPI.
\- GPSI.
The interception performed on the above two identities are mutually
independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other
identities when available.
#### 7.9.4.4 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the NEF shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
following specific events or information related to the MSISDN-less MO SMS:
\- MSISDN-less MO SMS.
The MSISDN-less MO SMS xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the NEF
detects that a MSISDN-less MO SMS has been received from a target UE by the
NEF and is delivered to the recipient AF.
### 7.9.5 LI for parameter provisioning
#### 7.9.5.1 Background
Parameter provisioning is a capability exposed by NEF to AF (see TS 23.502 [4]
clause 4.15.6 and TS 29.522 [31] clause 4.4.11). The AF can use this
capability to tell the network when a device is expected to communicate. The
core network can then use this information to create assistance information
for the RAN. The RAN may then use the assistance information to minimize UE
state transitions. The AF provides the Expected UE behaviour data specified in
TS 29.503 [25] to NEF, and NEF updates the UE subscription data via UDM as
described in figure 7.9-4. Each parameter within the Expected UE Behaviour
shall have an associating validity time. The validity time indicates when the
Expected UE Behaviour parameter expires. The validity time may be set to
indicate that the particular Expected UE Behaviour parameter has no expiration
time.
Figure 7.9-4: 5GS architecture for Parameter provisioning
#### 7.9.5.2 Architecture
Figure 7.9-1 without the CC-POI in NEF provides the architecture for LI for
parameter provisioning.
#### 7.9.5.3 Target identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the NEF:
\- GPSI.
#### 7.9.5.4 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the NEF shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
following specific events or information related to parameter provisioning:
\- Expected UE behaviour update.
The expected UE behaviour update xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the NEF detects that an AF sent a request to create, update, delete or get
expected UE behaviour data related to the target UE and the NEF updates or
gets these data from the UE subscription profile via UDM.
## 7.10 Non-IP data delivery (NIDD) in EPS
### 7.10.1 Background
#### 7.10.1.1 General
Functions for NIDD (Non-IP Data Delivery) may be used to handle Mobile
Originated (MO) and Mobile Terminated (MT) communication for unstructured data
(also referred to as Non-IP). Such delivery to the SCS/AS (Service Capability
Server/ Application Server) is accomplished by one of the following two
mechanisms as defined in TS 23.682 [33] clause 4.5.14:
\- Delivery using SCEF.
\- Delivery using a Point-to-Point (PtP) SGi tunnel.
If the subscription includes a \"SCEF Identity for NIDD\" corresponding with
the APN information, then the MME selects that SCEF and uses the T6a interface
to that SCEF, otherwise, the MME selects a SGW and PGW which handle this PDN
connection. The PDN GW shares a SGi tunnel with the SCS/AS for the NIDD
traffic exchange. If SCEF is used, the NIDD traffic is forwarded by SCEF to
the SCS/AS.NIDD applies to non-roaming and roaming with home-routed roaming
architecture.
#### 7.10.1.2 NIDD in non-roaming situation
##### 7.10.1.2.1 Delivery using SCEF
Figure 7.10-1 presents the architecture for delivery of NIDD using SCEF in
non-roaming scenario. NIDD using SCEF requires a control plane PDN connection.
The PDN connection is established between UE and SCEF via MME. The user
traffic (i.e. NIDD traffic) is exchanged with DoNAS (Data over NAS) between UE
and MME, then over T6a interface between MME and SCEF and finally over T8
interface between SCEF and SCS/AS.

##### 7.10.1.2.2 Delivery using a PtP SGi tunnel
Figure 7.10-2 shows the architecture for delivery of NIDD using a PtP SGi
tunnel in non-roaming scenario. The user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS
between UE and MME, over S11 interface between MME and SGW, over S5 interface
between SGW and PGW and finally over a PtP SGi tunnel between PGW and AF. The
tunnel is typically a UDP/IP tunnel.

#### 7.10.1.3 NIDD in roaming situation
##### 7.10.1.3.1 Delivery using SCEF
In roaming scenario, the PDN connection for NIDD using SCEF is established
between UE and SCEF via MME and IWK-SCEF in the visited network and SCEF in
the home network. The user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS between UE and MME,
over T6a interface between MME and IWK-SCEF, over T7a interface between IWK-
SCEF and SCEF and finally over T8 interface between SCEF and SCS/AS. Figure
7.10-3 shows the architecture for delivery of NIDD using SCEF in roaming
situation.

##### 7.10.1.3.2 Delivery using a PtP SGi tunnel
In roaming scenario, the PDN connection for NIDD using PtP SGi tunnel is
established between UE and PGW via MME and SGW in the visited network and PGW
in the home network. The user traffic is exchanged with DoNAS between UE and
MME, over S11 interface between MME and SGW, over S8 interface between SGW and
PGW and finally over a PtP SGi tunnel between PGW and SCS/AS (figure 7.10-4).

situation
### 7.10.2 LI for NIDD
#### 7.10.2.1 LI for NIDD using SCEF
In non-roaming scenario, only SCEF will provide IRI-POI and CC-POI.
In roaming scenario, IWK-SCEF shall provide the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions
for the visited network while SCEF in the home network provides IRI-POI and
CC-POI.
NOTE: Only home-routed mode applies.
LI for NIDD using SCEF or IWK-SCEF is described in clause 7.10.2.2.
Packet header reporting and non-3GPP access are not applicable to NIDD.
#### 7.10.2.2 LI for NIDD using a PtP SGi tunnel
In non-roaming scenario, the PGW provides an IRI-POI and a CC-POI. Although
SGW provides an IRI POI and a CC-POI for IP and Ethernet-based PDN
connections, PGW terminates the PtP SGI tunnel with the SCS/AS and has the
same capabilities as SCEF for NIDD.
In roaming scenario, SGW in the visited network and PGW in the home network
shall provide the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions as shown in figure 6.3-2 which
also concerns IRI-POI and CC-POI functions for IP and Ethernet-based PDN
connections.
NOTE: Only home-routed mode applies for NIDD using a PtP SGi tunnel.
The LI architecture for NIDD using a PtP SGi tunnel is the same as presented
in figure 6.3-2.
However, the user plane packets between UE and PGW flow through the MME and
SGW as shown in figures 7.10-2 and 7.10-4.
The same xIRIs as specified in clause 6.3.3.3 for PDN connections of IP or
Ethernet type and the same xCC are also considered for PDN connections for
NIDD using a PtP SGi tunnel, considering unstructured payload format.
## 7.11 LI at SCEF
### 7.11.1 General
The present document specifies SCEF as POI for:
\- NIDD.
\- Device triggering.
\- MSISDN-less MO SMS.
\- Parameter provisioning.
### 7.11.2 LI for NIDD using SCEF
#### 7.11.2.1 Architecture
The SCEF in the home network and the IWK-SCEF in the visited network shall
provide both IRI-POI and CC-POI functions. Figure 7.11-1 gives a reference
point representation of the LI architecture with SCEF as a CP NF and UP NF
providing the IRI-POI and CC-POI functions for NIDD using SCEF. SCEF is the
anchor point for PDN connection establishment and NIDD traffic.
**Figure 7.11-1: LI architecture for NIDD using SCEF showing LI at SCEF/IWK-
SCEF**
#### 7.11.2.2 Target Identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the SCEF:
\- IMSI.
\- MSISDN.
\- External Identifier.
The interception performed on the above three identities are mutually
independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other
identities when available.
#### 7.11.2.3 IRI events
The IRI-POI in the SCEF/IWK-SCEF shall generate xIRI when it detects the
following specific events or information in both roaming and non-roaming
situations:
\- PDN connection establishment.
\- PDN connection update.
\- PDN connection release.
\- Start of interception with established PDN connection.
\- Unsuccessful procedure.
The PDN connection establishment xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the SCEF/IWK-SCEF detects that a PDN connection for NIDD using SCEF has been
established for the target UE. The SCEF plays the role of anchor point for
that PDN connection.
The PDN connection update xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
SCEF/IWK-SCEF detects that a PDN connection for NIDD using SCEF is modified
for the target UE.
The PDN connection release xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
SCEF/IWK-SCEF detects that a PDN connection for NIDD using SCEF is released
for the target UE.
The start of interception with an established PDN connection xIRI is generated
when the IRI-POI present in a SCEF/IWK-SCEF detects that interception is
activated on the target UE that has an already established PDN connection for
NIDD using SCEF in the EPS. When a target UE has multiple PDN connections,
this xIRI shall be sent for each PDN connection with a different value of
correlation information.
When additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to
generate and deliver the start of interception with an established PDN
connection related IRI messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants
without receiving the corresponding start of interception with an established
PDN connection xIRI.
The unsuccessful procedure xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
SCEF/IWK-SCEF detects an unsuccessful procedure for PDN connection
establishment, update, release or data delivery, data reception.
SCEF/IWK-SCEF generates xCC for NIDD using SCEF if CC is requested.
### 7.11.3 LI for device triggering
#### 7.11.3.1 Background
Device triggering is the means by which an SCS/AS sends information to the UE
via the SCEF to trigger the UE to perform application specific actions that
include initiating communication with the SCS/AS (see TS 23.682 [33] clause
5.2 and TS 29.122 [32] clause 4.4.6).
The device trigger request is authorized by SCEF by submitting the MSISDN or
External Identifier of the UE to the HSS. After successful authorization, SCEF
forwards the Device trigger request with the IMSI of the UE to the
corresponding SM-SC to be delivered to that UE. The EPS architecture for NIDD
is presented in figure 7.11-2.
The device trigger may be recalled or replaced by the SCS/AS if the UE is not
reachable at the time the SCS/AS has delivered the device trigger to the UE.

following specific events or information related to the device triggering
service:
\- Device trigger.
\- Device trigger replacement.
\- Device trigger cancellation.
\- Device trigger report notification.
The device trigger xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the SCEF
detects that a device trigger has been received from an SCS/AS and is
delivered to the SM-SC for the target UE.
The device trigger replacement xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the SCEF detects that a device trigger replacement has been received from an
SCS/AS and delivered to the SM-SC to replace previously submitted device
trigger message which is not yet delivered to the target UE.
The device trigger cancellation xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI in the SCEF
detects that a device trigger cancellation has been received from an SCS/AS
and delivered to the SM-SC to recall previously submitted device trigger which
is not yet delivered to the target UE.
The device trigger report notification xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI
present in the SCEF detects that a device trigger report is returned to the
SCS/AS with a cause value indicating the trigger delivery outcome (e.g.
succeeded, unknown or failed and the reason for the failure).
### 7.11.4 LI for MSISDN-less MO SMS
#### 7.11.4.1 Background
An MSISDN-less MO SMS is sent by a UE without MSISDN as originator and
received by a third party application as destination (i.e. SCS/AS) via SM-SC
and SCEF. MSISDN-less means that the UE has a subscription without MSISDN but
an External Identifier which form is username\@realm. MSISDN-less MO-SMS
service allows MSISDN-less UE to send small data to an SCS/AS using SMS-MO.
The SMS-MO received by the SM-SC through MO submission procedure as defined in
TS 23.040 [50], is directly forwarded to the SCEF for further transfer to the
recipient SCS/AS (see TS 23.682 [33] clause 5.15).
The SCEF queries the HSS with the IMSI of the UE, obtains the corresponding
External Identifier of the UE sending the SMS, and forwards the SMS to the
SCS/AS including the External Identifier of the originating UE.
Figure 7.11-3: EPS architecture for MSISDN-less MO SMS
#### 7.11.4.2 Architecture
Figure 7.11-1 without the CC-POI in SCEF provides the architecture for LI for
MSISN-less MO SMS.
#### 7.11.4.3 Target identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the SCEF:

The interception performed on the above two identities are mutually
independent, even though, an xIRI may contain the information about the other
identities when available.
#### 7.11.4.4 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the SCEF shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
following specific events or information related to the MSISDN-less MO SMS:
\- MSISDN-less MO SMS.
The MSISDN-less MO SMS xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the SCEF
detects that a MSISDN-less MO SMS has been received from a target UE by the
SCEF and is delivered to the recipient SCS/AS.
### 7.11.5 LI for parameter provisioning
#### 7.11.5.1 Background
Parameter provisioning is a capability exposed by SCEF to SCS/AS (see TS
23.682 [33] clause 5.10). The SCS/AS can use this capability to tell the
network when a device is expected to communicate. The core network can then
use this information to create assistance information for the RAN. The RAN may
then use the assistance information to minimize UE state transitions. The
SCS/AS provides the communication pattern parameters to SCEF, and SCEF updates
the UE subscription data via HSS. The parameters shall have a validity time.
The validity time indicates when the communication pattern parameters expire.
The validity time may be set to indicate that the communication pattern
parameters have no expiration time.

#### 7.11.5.2 Architecture
Figure 7.11-1 without the CC-POI in SCEF provides the architecture for LI for
parameter provisioning.
#### 7.11.5.3 Target identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI present in the SCEF:
\- MSISDN.
\- External Identifier.
#### 7.11.5.4 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the SCEF shall generate xIRI, when it detects the
following specific events or information related to Parameter provisioning:
\- Communication pattern update.
The communication pattern update xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in
the SCEF detects that an SCS/AS sent a request to create, update, delete or
get communication pattern data related to the targe UE and the SCEF updates or
gets these data from the UE subscription profile via HSS.
## 7.12 Data
### 7.12.1 General
This clause provides additional details on LI architecture, requirements and
functionality for data services.
### 7.12.2 Packet header information reporting
#### 7.12.2.1 General
A warrant that does not require the interception of communication contents,
may require IRI messages that have to be derived from the user plane packets.
One report type that requires such a capability is the packet header
information report.
#### 7.12.2.2 Report types
Depending on the requirements of the warrant, packet header information
reporting may be done either in per-packet form, as one or more Packet Data
Header Reports (PDHR), or in summary form, as one or more Packet Data Header
Summary Reports (PDSR).
#### 7.12.2.3 Implementation approaches
To support the generation of related xIRI (i.e. that requires access to the
user plane packets), the present document supports two implementation
approaches:
\- In approach 1, xIRI (that includes the correlation number and the target
identity) is generated by the IRI-POI in the UP Entity. The IRI-POI generates
the xIRI from the user plane packets and sends it to the MDF2. The MDF2
generates the IRI messages and sends them to the LEMF.

In 5GS and CUPS EPS, the POI in the UP Entity requires a trigger to enable it
to detect the user plane packets. The corresponding Triggering Function (IRI-
TF or CC-TF) resides in the CP Entity that has the IRI-POI for the generation
of other xIRI. The trigger sent by the IRI-TF or CC-TF to the corresponding
POI includes the following:
\- User plane packet detection rules.
\- Target identity.
\- Correlation information.
\- MDF2 (in approach 1) or MDF3 (in approach 2) address.
## 7.13 RCS
### 7.13.1 Background
Rich Communication Suite (RCS) is the platform that enables the delivery of
communication experiences beyond voice and SMS, providing consumers with a
number of services related to:
\- Capability discovery for enhanced contacts information.
\- Standalone messaging:
\- Pager mode.
\- Large message mode.
> \- Chat:
\- 1-to-1.
\- Group chat.
\- File URL transfer for enhanced messaging.
\- Upload and download of files through HTTP Content Server.
RCS also covers additional services related to enriched calls. LI for these
additional services is not defined in the present document.
As RCS requires the IMS to enable communication between RCS clients, the LI
capabilities, requirements and architecture build on those defined for IMS in
clause 7.4.
For additional details on LI for specific RCS services, see Annex D.
### 7.13.2 Architecture
#### 7.13.2.1 Overview
The capabilities defined in this clause and the following subclauses apply to
the LI for RCS. The LI architecture and functionality for RCS builds on the LI
capabilities defined for IMS (see clause 7.4). When LI for RCS is required,
the LI functions in IMS are provisioned as described in clause 7.4.
The network functions involved in providing the interception of RCS events are
determined based on the deployment option, the network configuration, LI
service scope and the RCS communication type. In general, the LI functions
involved in the interception of RCS events are located either in the IMS core
or in RCS specific network functions.
Additional topology options for RCS are described in clause 7.13.2.2.
The present document refers to any server that provides support, services or
functions for RCS as an RCS Server. In general, RCS Servers are IMS
Application Servers. The HTTP Content Server supports file upload, URI
generation, and file download to allow for the transfer of files over RCS.
The following sub-clauses contain general stage 2 details for LI for RCS.
The RCS Servers shall have LI capabilities to generate xIRI records and xCC
when RCS events related to the target UE are handled. The HTTP Content Server
shall have LI capabilities to generate xIRI records and xCC when the target UE
uploads or downloads a file and when any user downloads a file previously
uploaded by a target. If an IRI-TF or CC-TF is required, the relevant RCS
Server shall have the CC-TF. The figure 7.13.2-1 gives a reference point
representation of the LI architecture for RCS interception.
Figure 7.13.2-1: LI architecture for RCS services
The LICF present in the ADMF receives the warrant from an LEA, derives the
intercept information from the warrant and provides it to the LIPF.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POI present in each RCS
Server, the IRI-TF in the relevant RCS Servers, the MDF2 and the MDF3 over the
LI_X1 interfaces.
If the authentication method used to authenticate at the HTTP Content Server
uses a permanent identifier, the LIPF present in the ADMF also provisions the
IRI-POI in the HTTP Content Server.
To enable the interception of the target\'s message contents (e.g. when the
warrant requires the interception of communication contents), the CC-POI in
each RCS Server and the CC-TF present in the relevant RCS Servers are also
provisioned with the intercept data.
If the authentication method used to authenticate at the HTTP Content Server
uses a permanent identifier and the interception of the target\'s
communication contents is required, the LIPF present in the ADMF also
provisions the CC-POI in the HTTP Content Server.
NOTE 1: The IRI-POI, CC-POI, IRI-TF and CC-TF represented in figure 7.13.2-1
are logical functions and require correlation information be shared between
them; they may be handled by the same process within the NF.
NOTE 2: The details on which RCS Servers require IRI-POIs, CC-POIs, and IRI-
TFs or CC-TFs is dependent on implementation.
NOTE 3: The IRI-POI, CC-POI represented in figure 7.13.2-1 with LI_T2, LI_T3,
and LI_X1 (Management) interfaces are the triggered POIs and are logically
separate from the non-triggered IRI-POI, CC-POI represented in figure 7.13.2-1
with LI_X1 interface.
NOTE 4: The use of File Transfer Localisation Function (figure 7.13.2-1) is a
deployment option for the CSP. See clause 7.13.2.2.2 for the details when File
Transfer Localisation Function is deployed.
The IRI-POI present in the relevant RCS Server detects RCS registration and
deregistration; session establishment, modification, and deletion; and message
related events, generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over
LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.
When the IRI-TF present in the RCS Server detects a URI for file transfer, the
IRI-TF present in the RCS Server sends a trigger to the IRI-POI in the HTTP
Content Server over the LI_T2 interface.
The IRI-POI present in the HTTP Content Server detects file uploads,
downloads, or retrieval (i.e. by File Transfer Localisation Function, see
clause 7.13.2.2.2), generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over
LI_X2. The MDF2 delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.
When interception of communication contents is required, the CC-POI present in
the relevant RCS Server generates the xCC from RCS messages and delivers the
xCC (that includes the correlation number and the target identity) to the
MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over LI_HI3.
When interception of communication contents is required, the CC-TF present in
the RCS Servers sends a trigger to the CC-POI present in the HTTP Content
Server over the LI_T3 interface.
The trigger sent from the IRI-TF to the IRI-POI or the CC-TF to the CC-POI
includes the following information:
\- File detection rules.
\- Target identity.
\- Correlation information.
\- MDF3 address.
The CC-POI present in the HTTP Content Server generates the xCC from the
uploaded file and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and
the target identity) to the MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over
LI_HI3.
#### 7.13.2.2 Deployment options
##### 7.13.2.2.1 Implementations without a third party registration to the RCS
Server
As a deployment option, the S-CSCF may not perform a third party registration
with the RCS Server. In this case, in addition to the architecture information
in clause 7.13.2.1, the IRI-POI present in the IMS Signalling Function detects
RCS registration and deregistration, generates and delivers the related xIRI
to the MDF2 over LI_X2.
NOTE: The method used within the IRI-POI present in the IMS Signalling
Function to determine that the third party registration to the RCS Server is
deployed is outside the scope of the present document.
##### 7.13.2.2.2 Implementations that have a file transfer localisation
function
As described in GSMA RCC.07, clause 4.1.15.3 [35], the terminating CSP may
utilize a File Transfer Localisation Function which retrieves objects from the
originating HTTP Content Server and makes the same available to the
terminating user.
If the CSP implements a File Transfer Localisation Function, in addition to
the architecture information in clause 7.13.2.1, the following requirements
apply.
The LI architectue for the File Transfer Localisation Function is depicted in
figure 7.13.2-1.
When the IRI-TF present in the RCS Server detects a URI for an incoming file
transfer, the IRI-TF present in the RCS Server sends a trigger to the IRI-POI
in the File Transfer Localisation Function over the LI_T2 interface. When
interception of communication contents is required, the CC-TF present in the
RCS Servers sends a trigger to the CC-POI present in the File Transfer
Localisation Function over the LI_T3 interface. The trigger sent from the TF
to the POI includes the following information:
\- File detection rules.
\- Target identity.
\- Correlation information.
\- MDF2 (for xIRI) or MDF3 (for xCC) address.
If the authentication method used to authenticate at the File Transfer
Localisation Function uses a permanent identifier (see clause 7.13.3), the
LIPF present in the ADMF also provisions the IRI-POI in the File Transfer
Localisation Function.
In both cases, the IRI-POI present in the File Transfer Localisation Function
detects file retrieval (i.e. from the HTTP Content Server) or downloads,
generates and delivers the related xIRI to the MDF2 over LI_X2. The MDF2
delivers the IRI messages to the LEMF over LI_HI2.
If the authentication method used to authenticate at the File Transfer
Localisation Function uses a permanent identifier and the interception of the
target\'s communication contents is required, the LIPF present in the ADMF
also provisions the CC-POI in the Localisation Function.
If the interception of communications content is required, the CC-POI present
in the File Transfer Localisation Function generates the xCC from the
retrieved file and delivers the xCC (that includes the correlation number and
the target identity) to the MDF3. The MDF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF over
LI_HI3.
### 7.13.3 Target identities
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identities to the IRI-POI, IRI-TF, CC-POI and CC-TF
present in the RCS Server:
\- IMPU.
\- IMPI.
\- IMEI.
In addition to the target identifiers listed above, the LIPF present in the
ADMF provisions the intercept information associated with the following target
identities to the IRI-POI and CC-POI present in the HTTP Content Server and
the IRI-POI and CC-POI present in the Localisation Function:
\- IMSI.
\- SUPI.
\- GPSI.
\- Email Address.
The interception performed on identities above are mutually independent, even
though an xIRI may contain the information about the other identities when
available. The IRI-POI and CC-POI present in the RCS Servers and HTTP Content
Servers shall also support interception of non-local identities in any of the
IMPU formats (SIP URI, TEL URI as well as the E.164 number in a SIP URI or TEL
URI), GPSI formats (E.164 number, external identifier) and email address.
### 7.13.4 IRI events
#### 7.13.4.1 General RCS IRI events
As described in clause 7.13.2, the term RCS Server in the present document
refers to any server performing support, services or functions for RCS. In
most deployments there will be more than one RCS Server, and the events listed
below shall be intercepted in the server responsible for performing the
functions described by the event.
The IRI-POI present in the RCS Servers shall generate xIRI when it detects the
following specific events or information:
\- Registration.
\- Deregistration.
\- Capability discovery.
\- RCS message.
\- RCS message report.
\- Session establishment.
\- Session modification.
\- Session release.
\- Group chat establishment.
\- Group chat modification.
\- Group chat release.
\- Start of interception with already registered UE.
\- Start of interception with already established session.
\- Unsuccessful procedure.
The IRI-POI present in the HTTP Content Server shall generate xIRI when it
detects the following specific events or information:
\- File upload.
\- File download.
\- Unsuccessful procedure.
NOTE: In the following paragraphs, when the requirement applies to both target
UE and target non-local ID, the term \"target\" is used.
The registration xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an RCS Server
detects that a target UE has been registered for RCS services.
The deregistration xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an RCS Server
detects that a target UE has been deregistered from RCS services.
The capability discovery xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the RCS
Server detects that a target UE has updated the target UE's RCS capabilities.
This xIRI is also generated when a target UE gets information about the
capabilities and state of another RCS user.
The RCS message xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an RCS Server
detects that a target sends or receives an RCS message.
The RCS message report xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an RCS
Server detects that a target sends or receives a response to an RCS message.
The session establishment xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an RCS
Server detects that an RCS session has been created for a target.
The session modification xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an RCS
Server detects that an RCS session has been modified for a target.
The session release xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an RCS
Server detects that an RCS session has been released for a target.
The group chat establishment xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an
RCS Server detects that the target has joined an RCS group chat session.
The group chat modification xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an
RCS Server detects that a group chat session the target is participating in is
modified.
The group chat release xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an RCS
Server detects that the target leaves a group chat session.
The start of interception with already registered UE xIRI is generated when
the IRI-POI present in an RCS Server detects that interception is activated on
the target UE that is already registered for RCS services.
The start of interception with an established RCS session xIRI is generated
when the IRI-POI present in an RCS Server detects that interception is
activated on a target UE that has an already established RCS session. When a
target UE has multiple RCS sessions, this xIRI shall be sent for each RCS
session with a different value of correlation information.
When additional warrants are activated on a target UE, MDF2 shall be able to
generate and deliver the start of interception with already registered UE and
start of interception with already established RCS session related IRI
messages to the LEMF associated with the warrants without receiving the
corresponding xIRI.
The file upload xIRI shall be generated when the IRI-POI in the HTTP Content
Server detects that a target UE has uploaded a file or when any UE has
uploaded a file destined for the target non-local ID.
The file download xIRI shall be generated when the IRI-POI in the HTTP Content
Server detects that a target has downloaded a file or when any UE has
downloaded a file previously uploaded by a target UE.
The unsuccessful procedure xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in an
RCS Server or HTTP Content Server detects that a target UE initiated
communication procedure (e.g. session establishment, RCS Message) is rejected
or not accepted by the RCS Server before the proper NF handling the procedure
itself is involved. The unsuccessful procedure xIRI is also generated when the
IRI-POI present in the RCS Server or HTTP Content Server detects that any
request from the target UE is not accepted by the RCS Server or HTTP Content
Server.
#### 7.13.4.2 RCS events for topologies without a third party registration to
the RCS Server
The events specified in clause 7.13.4.1 apply with the following changes:
Rather than the IRI-POI present in the RCS Servers, the IRI-POI present in the
IMS Signalling Function shall generate xIRI when it detects the following
specific events or information:
\- Registration.
\- Deregistration.
The registration xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the IMS
Signalling Function detects that a target UE has been registered for RCS
services.
The deregistration xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the IMS
Signalling Function detects that a target UE has been deregistered from RCS
services.
#### 7.13.4.3 RCS events for topologies utilising a file transfer localisation
function
The events specified in clause 7.13.4.1 apply with the following changes.
In addition to the IRI-POI present in the HTTP Content Server (as described in
clause 7.13.4.1), the IRI-POI present in the Localisation Function shall
generate xIRI when it detects the following specific events or information:
\- File transfer.
\- File download.
\- Unsuccessful procedure.
The file download xIRI shall be generated when the IRI-POI in the Localisation
Function detects that a target UE has downloaded a file or when any UE has
downloaded a file previously sent from target non-local ID.
The file transfer xIRI shall be generated when the IRI-POI in the File
Transfer Localisation Function detects that File Transfer Localisation
Function retireves a file destined to the target UE from the HTTP Content
Server. The file transfer xIRI shall also be generated when the IRI-POI in the
File Transfer Localisation Function detects that File Transfer Localisation
Function retrieves a file from the HTTP Content Server when the file was sent
from a target non-local ID.
The unsuccessful procedure xIRI is generated when thi IRI-POI present in the
File Transfer Localisation Function detects that any request from the target
UE is not accepted by the File Transfer Localisation Function.
## 7.14 STIR/SHAKEN and RCD/eCNAM
### 7.14.1 General
Annex E provides detailed description of STIR SHAKEN and RCD/eCNAM procedures.
### 7.14.2 Architecture
The IMS Signaling Function that interacts with the AS for verification or the
LMISF-IRI (inbound roaming with HR) or P-CSCF (inbound roaming with LBO) shall
provide the IRI-POI functions for STIR/SHAKEN and RCD/eCNAM. In addition, at
the originating side of the session, the IMS Signaling Function that interacts
with the AS for signing shall provide the IRI-POI functions for STIR/SHAKEN
and RCD. In some redirection cases, the IMS Signaling Function, even if not
interacting with the AS of verification, may have to provide the IRI-POI
functions for STIR/SHAKEN and RCD/eCNAM (see TS 33.128 [15] clause 7.11.2.3).
Depending on the deployment, the IMS signaling function that interacts with
the AS for signing is either the Telephony AS or the Egress IBCF (see figure
E.2.1-1). Similarly, depending on the deployment, the IMS signaling function
that interacts with the AS for verification is either the Telephony AS or the
Ingress IBCF (see figure E.2.1-1).
Accordingly, table 7.14.2-1 identifies the IRI-POIs for STIR/SHAKEN and RCD
while table 7.14.2-2 identifies the IRI-POIs for eCNAM.

### 7.14.3 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the IMS network functions listed in table 7.14.2-1 and
7.14.2-2 shall generate xIRI when it detects the following specific events or
information:
> \- Signature generation.
>
> \- Signature validation.
The Signature generation xIRI is generated when the IRI-POI present in the
Telephony AS for non-roaming UE or outbound roaming UE (HR) or in the egress
IBCF detects that the Telephony AS or egress IBCF has sent a signing request
(HTTP POST request) to the AS for signing and received a signing response
(HTTP 200 OK) containing the Identity header. This interaction occurs when the
Telephony AS or egress IBCF has received a SIP INVITE request from a UE. The
xIRI shall contain the identity token which also includes the signed RCD
information if RCD is supported, and the initial caller number if changes
occur on that number.
The Signature validation xIRI is generated when:
\- The IRI-POI present in the Telephony AS or ingress IBCF has sent a
verification request (HTTP POST request) containing the Identity token to the
AS for verification and received a verification response (200 OK) containing
the verification outcome (validation passed / validation failed / no
validation). The xIRI shall contain the calling party identity, the identity
token, the verification outcome, and the RCD or eCNAM related information if
RCD or eCNAM is supported.
\- The IRI-POI present in the P-CSCF for inbound roaming UE (LBO) or LMISF-IRI
for inbound roaming UE (HR) receives a SIP INVITE request including
appropriate SIP headers containing the verification outcome and RCS or eCNAM
related information if RCS or eCNAM is supported.
These xIRIs should be correlated by MDF2 with the xIRIs related toIMS session
establishment. The correlation identifier found in the STIR/SHAKEN xIRIs and
IMS xIRIs should help the MDF2 performing the correlation procedure and
generated IRIs with both sets of data for delivery to LEMF.
## 7.15 LI for services encrypted by CSP-provided keys
### 7.15.1 Background
#### 7.15.1.1 General
3GPP standards have defined frameworks for encrypting application layer
traffic based on cryptographic keys derived from USIM (or equivalents such as
eSIM). These frameworks can be characterized by a Key Server Function (KSF),
located at the home CSP and having a connection to the AAA infrastructure
(typically the AUSF). The KSF reuses the basic network layer authentication
service (native 5G AKA or EAP-AKA') to obtain a derived anchor key. From this
anchor key, the KSF can derive one or more service specific keys, which can be
provided to various application functions. Such an application function
provides, besides the application specific functionality, a Security
Termination Function (STF) endpoint for the security with the UE. The KSF uses
a 5G native identifier space for subscribers such as SUPI , wheras the STF
could in principle use any identifier type to identify its users.
Additionally, while the KSF is always located in HPLMN, the STF can be located
either in HPLMN, in VPLMN, or even outside a PLMN, e.g. at an enterprise.
In 5G context, the principles laid out above are currently realized by the
Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA) based on 3GPP
credentials in the 5G System as defined in TS 33.535 [47] and also by legacy
frameworks such as the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA), TS 33.220
[48], which is currently undergoing specification for use in the 5GS.
NOTE : The terms KSF and STF above are defined for use in the present
document, and will in general be realised by network functions specific to a
given key management protocol or framework. See clause 7.15.3.1.1 for an
example of how these terms are mapped to functions defined by the AKMA
framework.
#### 7.15.1.2 LI requirements - overview
This clause specifies a common LI architecture for a general CSP-provided key
management solution in support of encryption, implemented by generic KSF and
STF functionality as defined in clause 7.15.1.1.
When encryption keys are provided by a CSP, lawful interception for a
target\'s communication may be done in one of the two ways: (i) decrypt
intercepted communication traffic before delivering IRIs and CCs to the LEA,
or, (ii) provide to the LEA the decryption keys and other information
necessary to enable the decryption of communication traffic. To fully enable
decryption of communicaiton traffic, LI functions are in general required both
at the KSF and at the STF as illustrated by the following examples.
EXAMPLE 1: In most situations, after STF has obtained encryption key from KSF,
the STF has all the necessary information to decrypt the communication traffic
without the additional help of KSF. In this situation, an LI function within
the STF can decrypt the target\'s communication and does not need to provide,
explicit encryption-related xIRI. However, the STF can also have access to
xIRI which is not related to encryption, but which is still application
specific, and which also can be of relevance to include as part of IRI.
EXAMPLE 2: In some situations, STF may not know whether communication traffic
is that of a target since it could use a user identfier space which is
independent from the 5G identifiers used for LI provisiong. In this situation,
the LI function in KSF will have to provide intercept triggers to the LI
function in the STF in order to identify the target communication traffic.
Moreover, even if decrypted xCC is provided by the STF, the KSF can still
typically report xIRI relating to key management (e.g. request for keys from
other STFs, expiry of keys etc) which are of relevance for LI. For a third
example of applicabity of LI at the KSF, refer to NOTE 3 below.
As mentioned, the physical/jurisdictional location of KSF and STF can differ
depending on the scenario which can have bearing on LI requirements.
NOTE 1: When a warrant is served to a PLMN that has neither the STF nor the
KSF, handling of LI aspects specifically related to the encrypted
communication traffic of a target is outside the scope of the present
document.
NOTE 2: For roaming situations, where LI providing unencrypted communication
in the VPLMN is required, the STF would need to be located in the VPLMN and
the STF would also need to use 5G native user identifiers which enable LI
provisioning in the VPLMN (since LI can not rely on triggering from HPLMN in
this case). However, such roaming scenarios are outside the scope of the
present document.
NOTE 3: When a warrant is issued to a HPLMN that has the KSF, but not the STF,
then the LI function in that KSF can still provide encryption related keys and
related events to the LEMF. LI at the STF is however then outside the scope of
the present document.
To summarize, with respect to the LI at KSF and STF, three specific type of
xIRIs are identified:
1\. xIRI from KSF consting of key managment information such as decryption
keys and thereto related information.
2\. xIRI from STF consisting of other encryption related parameters, refered
to as auxiliary security parameters.
3\. xIRI from STF which are application specific but not pertaining to
encryption.
### 7.15.2 Architecture
Figure 7.15.2-1 shows the general LI architecture where an IRI-POI in the KSF
provides the xIRIs that include key management related information such as the
decryption keys to the MDF2 over the LI_X2 interface. The STF can provide xIRI
and xCC for the target\'s communication traffic, as described in more detail
below. Figure 7.15.2-1 shows the case where STF is assumed to provide services
based on 5G-native identifier, e.g. SUPI, enabling the STF to be provisioned
over LI_X1.
{width="4.9in" height="3.5in"}
NOTE: If the STF is located outside the PLMN (not shown), the LI_X2 from IRI-
POI in KSF can be used to provide IRI with key management information such as
decryption keys via MDF2.
Figure 7.15.2-1: General architecture, STF using 5G native identifiers.
If the STF instead provides services based on some other user identifier
space, the STF POIs are assumed to be triggered by IRI-TF and CC-TF in the
KSF, as shown in figure 7.15.2-2. The triggering is based on the KSF detecting
requests from the STF for cryptographic keys associated with a target UE. When
the key management service of the KSF is based on target specific key
identifiers (KID) known both at KSF and STF, such KID can serve as basis for
mapping STF-identifiers to 5G-native identifiers at the KSF. The IRI-TF or CC-
TF present in the KSF send the triggers to the IRI-POI or CC-POI present in
the STF to indicate that the communication traffic is that of a target. The
IRI-POI and CC-POI are then enabled for delivery of xIRI and the xCC with
communication traffic of the target in a decrypted form as laid out above.
{width="5.0in" height="3.4in"}
Figure 7.15.2-2: General architecture, STF not relying on 5G native
identifiers.
The IRI-POI present in the KSF is provisioned by the LIPF over LI_X1 and is
responsible for providing key management related information in the form of
xIRI. The key management related information can comprise information about
requesting, creating, changing, or deleting encryption keys, and most
importantly, can comprise decryption keys. Such decryption keys are
generically denoted K~LI~ and may comprise one or more cryptographic keys.
The IRI-POI in the STF is responsible for providing xIRI with auxiliary
security parameters necessary to decrypt xCC which has been encrypted using
the keys provided by the KSF. In addition, application specific (not
encryption related) xIRI for the target\'s communication traffic. In more
detail, the auxiliary security parameters can typically include:
\- Additional cryptographic keys.
\- Selected protocols / cipher-suites / cryptographic algorithms for UE-STF
traffic encryption.
\- Parameters for key derivation (e.g. nonces).
\- Other cryptographic state information (e.g. counters).
Similarly, the CC-POI in the STF is responsible for providing the xCC for the
target\'s communicaiton traffic in a decrypted form.
The remainder of the present clause provides details of IRI-intercept and, as
applicable, CC-intercept of specific services encrypted by CSP-provided keys.
### 7.15.3 LI for specific services
#### 7.15.3.1 LI for general AKMA-based service
##### 7.15.3.1.1 Background
In the specific case of AKMA (see TS 33.535 [47]), the KSF of the general
architecture described above corresponds to the AAnF (AKMA Anchor Function).
The STF corresponds to the AKMA Application Function (AF), identified by an
application identifier AKMA AF_ID. Key requests from external AFs are routed
to AAnF via the NEF.
An AKMA Anchor Key is provided to the AAnF and is referred to as K~AKMA.~The
Anchor Key Identifier (A-KID) is used to identify the key K~AKMA.~ A-KID can
by TS 33.535 [47] be assumed to be globally unique. The AAnF derives, from the
anchor key, one or more application-dependent keys referred to as K~AF~ and
provides the same to the AF.
The A-KID (and the associated K~AKMA~) of a specific UE can be modified by
running 5G primary authentication. The A-KID can also become invalid at the
AAnF due to specific AKMA Context Removal request from some duly authorized
NF.
##### 7.15.3.1.2 LI architecture
{width="5.2in" height="3.5in"}
NOTE: If the AF is located outside the PLMN (not shown) the LI_T2 and LI_T3
interfaces are not used but LI_X2 from IRI-POI in AAnF can still be used to
provide IRI with key management information such as decryption keys via MDF2.

KSF AAnF TS 33.535 [47] clause 4.2.1 STF AF TS 33.535 [47] clause 4.2.2
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POI present in the AAnF and
the MDF2/MDF3 over LI_X1 interfaces. The LIPF may interact with the SIRF (over
LI_SI) to find the correct instances of these functions. Depending on the
warrant received from LEA, provisioning could be restricted to only specific
services/AFs or could be general.
The LIPF also provisions IRI-TF and CC-TF present in the AAnF. The IRI-TF and
CC-TF are capable of mapping AKMA key identifiers (A-KID) to/from SUPI. When a
UE presents A-KID to the AAnF, via the AF, the IRI-TF and CC-TF present in the
AAnF trigger the IRI-POI and CC-POI present in the AF respectively when LI is
active on the SUPI associated with the A-KID.
The AAnF only provides xIRI comprising key management events (creation,
modification, deletion, etc, of encryption keys), as well as cryptographic
keys themselves (K~AKMA~ and/or K~AF~) and key identifiers (A-KID). The AF can
provide both xIRI and xCC. The xIRI from the AF can comprise both auxiliary
security parameters (Ua* security protocol parameters, see below) and any
other application specific information as set out in the general case
described in clause 7.15.2.
Providing decrypted xCC depends on details of the security protocol used
between the target UE and AF. This protocol is in AKMA referred to as the Ua*
security protocol. Below, the generic term \"Ua* security protocol
parameters\" is used to denote the complete set of auxiliary security
parameters, besides the AKMA-related key material itself, necessary to decrypt
the application traffic.
EXAMPLE: The Ua* security protocol can be a profile of TLS version 1.2.
NOTE: AFs making use of AKMA for security purposes provide various
services/applications toward subscribers. Details of LI related to the
specifics of such services/applications are outside the scope of the present
document, Only LI for the AKMA key management service itself is described in
the present clause.
3GPP-defined Ua* security protocols and protocol identifiers are defined in
annex B of TS 33.535 [47] and currently cross-reference protocols defined in
TS 33.222 [49].

##### 7.15.3.1.3 Target identities
###### 7.15.3.1.3.1 Provisioning
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the intercept information associated
with the following target identity to the IRI-POI, IRI-TF and CC-TF present in
the AAnF:
\- SUPI.
Provisioning of AKMA AF, as an alternative to the triggering described in
clause 7.15.3.1.3.2, could be possible for certain types of AFs. This is
however service specific and outside the scope of the present document.
###### 7.15.3.1.3.2 Triggering
AFs making use of AKMA can use either SUPI or some other form of identifier as
basis for providing their services. The AAnF maintains a mapping from valid
AKMA key identifiers (A-KID) to the SUPI.
When the IRI-TF in the AAnF receives an A-KID, it shall use said mapping to
determine whether or not to trigger the IRI-POI in the AF. Thus, this is done
independently of the type of subscriber identifier used locally at the AF.
CC intercept and CC-TF behaviour is service specific and outside the scope of
the present document. Non-service-specific CC intercept can be achieved as
described in clause 7.15.3.1.8.
An initial trigger for a new Task shall be issued to POIs of AFs matching the
scope of the warrant when an A-KID for a target is first created. Since all
such AFs might not be known in advance, this triggering can alternatively be
performed dynamically, when a previously unknown AF requests key material
related to a specific A-KID, from the AAnF.
Each time the A-KID of a target changes (due to primary authentication), the
TF shall issue a new Task to the AF POI containing the new A-KID.
##### 7.15.3.1.4 IRI events
The IRI-POI present in the AAnF shall generate xIRI when it detects the
following specific events or information related to an LI target:
\- Anchor key register: AAnF receives AKMA-related key material from AUSF.
This event can occur each time a target UE performs successful primary
authentication to 5GC and then overwrites previous AKMA parameters stored at
the AAnF.
\- AKMA application key get: AAnF receives request for AKMA-related key
material from a network-internal AF, or, from a network-external AF (via NEF).
\- Start of intercept with established AKMA key material: AAnF detects that
interception is activated on a target UE that has already established AKMA key
material.
\- AKMA context removal: An NF requests AAnF to remove AKMA-related key
material.
The conditions under which the IRI-POI present in the AF generates xIRI is
application-specific, but shall include at least the following events relating
to xIRI with auxiliary security parameter:
\- Application key refresh: AF performs local K~AF~ refresh with the target
UE.
\- Start of intercept with established AKMA application key: the AF detects
that interception is activated on a target UE that already has an established
K~AF~.
\- Auxiliary security parameter establishment: establishment or update of
\"Ua* security protocol parameters\" between the UE and the AF (e.g. nonces,
selected security algorithms, etc.).
\- Application key removal: the AF terminates the connection and does not make
further use of K~AF~.
##### 7.15.3.1.5 Common IRI parameters
All xIRI shall include at least the following information:
\- Target identity.
\- Additional identities associated with the target as observed by the IRI-
POI.
NOTE: This applies mainly for the AF.
\- Time stamp.
\- Correlation information.
##### 7.15.3.1.6 Specific IRI parameters
Additionally, to the common IRI parameters, the following xIRI shall be
provided by the IRI-POI of the AAnF for the specific IRI events.
The Anchor key register shall include:
\- A-KID, Anchor key identity of the currently valid anchor key associated
with the event, see TS 33.535 [47].
\- The AKMA anchor key K~AKMA~ itself as defined in TS 33.535 [47], unless LI
has been provisioned only for specific services or specific AFs.
The AKMA application key get shall include:
\- Type: internal or external AF.
\- AKMA AF_ID (Application Function Identity), of the requesting application
function. AF_ID has format\ AF_ID = FQDN of the AF \|\| Ua* security protocol
identifier, as defined in TS 33.535 [47].
\- A-KID.
\- K~AF~, the Application Function specific key delivered to the requesting
application function, as defined in TS 33.535 [47].
\- K~AF~ Expiration Time, the expiry time of K~AF~, as defined in TS 33.535
[47].
NOTE 1: If the TLS-based Ua* security protocols of annex B in TS 33.535 [47]
is used between a target UE and STF, it could likely be the case that K~AF~
itself is insufficient as decryption key for xCC. Further key material only
available as part of the \"Ua* security protocol parameters\" element of xIRI
obtained from the STF, see below, are then likely also needed.
\- The Start of intercept with established AKMA key material shall
include:A-KID (currently valid).
NOTE 2: While a new primary authentication overwrites old AKMA contexts
(K~AKMA~ and A-KID), the expiry time of earlier application specific keys
(K~AF~), derived from an old AKMA context (with an old A-KID) could still lie
in the future when the Start of intercept with established AKMA key material
occurs.
\- The AKMA anchor key K~AKMA~ associated with currently valid A-KID, unless
provisioning has been made service- or AF-specific.
\- The set of all (AKMA AF_ID, K~AF~, K~AF~ Expiration Time)-tuples associated
with the target and satisfying all of:
\- Being available at AAnF,
\- AF_ID is within scope of previous LI-provisioning, and
\- K~AF~ Expiration Time has not yet been passed.
The AKMA context removal xIRI shall include:
\- A-KID.
\- NF identity, of the NF requesting the removal.
Additionally, to the common IRI parameters, the following xIRI shall be
provided by the IRI-POI of an AF for the specific IRI events:
\- Application key refresh:AKMA AF_ID.
\- A-KID.
\- New K~AF.~
\- The set of \"Ua* security protocol parameters\", if updated alongside
K~AF~.
\- Start of intercept with established AKMA application key:The FQDN part of
the AKMA AF_ID.
NOTE 3: Since a given application function could have several parallel secured
sessions with a target UE, the FQDN part of AF_ID is reported separately,
while details of each session, e.g. \"Ua* security protocol parameters\", is
reported in the information elements below.
\- A-KID (currently valid).
\- The set of all (A-KID, K~AF~, K~AF~ expiry, \"Ua* security protocol
parameters\")-tuples where A-KID is associated with the target and satisfying
all of:
\- Being available in the AF and not having expired, and
\- The \"Ua* security protocol parameters\" are associated with the specific
A-KID / K~AF~.
Auxiliary security parameter establishment:
\- AKMA AF_ID.
\- A-KID associated with the \"Ua* security protocol parameters\" being
established or updated (i..e with K~AF~).
\- K~AF~ associated with the \"Ua* security protocol parameters\" being
established or updated.
\- The actual set of \"Ua* security protocol parameters\" associated with the
event.
Application key removal:
\- AKMA AF_ID.
\- A-KID.
\- Cause (reason for removal, e.g. key expiration).
For both Start of intercept with established application key and Auxiliary
security parameter establishment, if other cryptographic key material (besides
K~AF~) is required to decrypt xCC, then it shall be ensured that all such key
material is included as part of \"Ua* security protocol parameters\".
EXAMPLE: One example when K~AF~ alone is insufficient is when the Ua* security
protocol deploys a separate \"base secret\" (e.g. from a stand-alone Diffie-
Hellman key exchange), which is used by UE/AF when producing traffic
encryption keys. In such case, also this base secret is needed for decryption.
##### 7.15.3.1.7 Network topologies
The AAnF shall provide the IRI-POI, IRI-TF, and CC-TF functions, and the
network-internal AF shall provide the IRI-POI function in the following
network topology cases:
\- Non-roaming case.
NOTE: Handling of AKMA-based services in the roaming case is currently not
defined in TS 33.535 [47].
##### 7.15.3.1.8 Provision of CC
Since AKMA is a non-service specific framework, interception of (decrypted)
xCC at an AF for AKMA-secured services is not specified in further detail as
part of clause 7.15.3.1. Non-service specific intercept of encrypted UP
traffic could in some cases however be accomplished by combining the IRI-
intercept (in particular, intercepted key material) of clauses 7.15.3.1.3 to
7.15.3.1.6 with the general solution for network layer xCC-intercept at the
UPF as defined in clause 6.2.3.
# 8 LI security and deployment considerations
## 8.1 Introduction
The most sensitive information in the LI system is the target list. This is
the list of all the subjects in the network currently under surveillance,
whether active, suspended or in any other state. The security measures used by
the carrier to prevent unauthorized access to this list is not subject to
standardization, but the architectural choices made in the design of the LI
system do impact the security of the target list directly.
Since completeness of the interception product is a legal requirement in most
jurisdictions, the LI system shall ensure that no events that are lawfully
authorized for interception are missed (or collected in error). To ensure that
no events are missed there are two architectural alternatives.
## 8.2 Architectural alternatives
### 8.2.1 Full target list at every POI node
A carrier may choose to deploy the full target list at all POIs, such that
when a UE arrives in the network and commences registration, the POI is fully
armed and in position to recognize if the target identifier is in the target
list. The choice to push the full list to every node is the simplest, and
arguably the riskiest, since the compromise of any node will leak the complete
target list.
### 8.2.2 Full target list only in LICF
A Communication Service Provider (CSP) may choose to selectively distribute
specific target identifiers to specific POIs, rather than distributing the
full target list to all POIs. This choice introduces a race condition. When
the UE appears, the POI shall query the ADMF/LICF to find out if the user
identifier is part of the target list. As the registration sequence
progresses, the NF POI is waiting for a response from the ADMF/LICF. When the
reply arrives, the POI can take action if the reply is positive. If the reply
is negative, the POI\'s involvement ends.
If the reply is positive, depending on how long the POI-(ADMF/LICF)-POI round
trip for the query/reply took, it is possible that some reportable events are
missed. To mitigate this there are two further alternatives:
> 1) the carrier may choose to delay completion of the registration for all
> users for the time it takes the ADMF/LICF to answer, thus inducing a
> registration delay in all registrations, whether the user is a target or
> not, or
>
> 2) the carrier may choose to cache the reportable registration events while
> the POI-(ADMF/LICF)-POI query is running, and either report them if the
> answer is positive, or delete them if the answer is negative.
These are choices at the discretion of the CSP, but the trade-off cannot be
avoided.
### 8.2.3 Provisioning for registered users
When a new target is provisioned in the LI system, after the target is already
registered in the CSP network, the CSP will be faced with the race condition
consequences of the implementation choice made as described in clauses 8.2.1
and 8.2.2. The ADMF has a choice to either wholesale pre-arm every POI with
the new target (and expect every POI to immediately start interception on the
new target, as in clause 8.2.1), or, the ADMF can poll every serving UDM POI
for all target UEs, and arm the associated POI (and start interception, as in
clause 8.1.2) _only_ if a target UE is discovered to be served by that
particular NF. The second approach would take comparatively longer and would
be expected to miss more of the on-going target interactions with the network
than the first approach.
## 8.3 LI key management at ADMF
### 8.3.1 General
The ADMF is responsible for overall management of the LI system as defined in
clause 5.3.2.4. The ADMF is responsible for creating and managing
intermediate, client and root certificates used for both identity verification
and establishing encrypted communications between LI components.
NOTE: The exact mechanism for installation of certificates in POIs, MDFs or
other LI components (manual or automated) is outside the scope of the present
document.
### 8.3.2 Key management
The ADMF shall implement an LI Certificate Authority (LI CA) which shall be
used as the issuing CA for all LI components.
By default, the LI CA shall be a sub-CA of the CSP root CA, and may issue
intermediate certificates.
The LI CA shall be responsible for creating, maintaining and revoking all
identity verification and encryption certificates and root keys used by LI
components communicating on LI_X interfaces. It may also be responsible for
issuing certificates and root keys for LI_HI interfaces if these are not
issued by the LEA/LEMF.
For virtualised implementations, the LICF shall support automated certificate
enrolment for POIs, TFs and MDFs. For non-virtualised deployments, support for
automatic certificate enrolment is optional.
The LICF shall maintain a list of all valid LI components for which the LI CA
has generated certificates. The LICF shall instruct the LI CA to revoke any
certificate belonging to LI components that are removed from the system (e.g.
de-instantiated).
The LI CA shall provide a single certificate for each LI component. The LI
component shall generate individual session keys for each LI_X link.
## 8.4 Virtualised LI security
### 8.4.1 General
This clause provides requirements and deployment constraints relating to the
virtualisation of LI in 3GPP networks.
### 8.4.2 NFVI and host requirements
NFVIs hosting LI functions defined in the present document, shall provide
functionality for protecting sensitive functions as defined in ETSI GS NFV-SEC
012 [29] or equivalent specification.
### 8.4.3 Virtualised LI function implementation
LI functions as defined in the present document when virtualised shall include
the use of one or more HMEEs as defined in ETSI GS NFV-SEC 012 [29] or
equivalent specification, to protect as a minimum:
\- LI target lists.
\- Any LI dynamic selectors used internally within the NF to select target
communications to be intercepted.
\- Any cryptographic keys and LI_X1/LI_X2/LI_X3 end points.
During runtime, NFs containing LI functions should not share NFVI hosts with
any other NF, VNF or VNFC.
During runtime, NFs containing LI functions shall not share NFVI hosts with
any other NF, VNF or VNFC which does not contain other authorised LI
functions.
The NF runtime restriction requirements do not prevent hosts being used for
different NFs over the lifetime of the NFVI, following termination of the
previous VNF instances. However, both where hosts are newly allocated for LI
use and when subsequently released, host memory and storage secure erase
procedures as defined in ETSI GS NFV-SEC 012 [29] or equivalent specification
shall be used.
### 8.4.4 Container based deployments
Where containers are used for implementing LI functionality, and when images
corresponding to those containers are required to be stored at runtime in a
system wide container cache, the LI Controller shall ensure that each time the
container image is retrieved from the cache, the integrity of the image is
validated. In addition, when the image is no longer required by a live running
Network Function, the image is erased from the cache.
## 8.5 Points of Interception
CSPs use a wide range of 3GPP NFs to provide services to users. In order to
intercept a service, POIs are associated with specific NFs, as depicted in
Figure 8.5-1. The manner the POI obtains the required information from the NF
depends on the service and can range from something as simple as a copy-and-
forward mechanism, to sophisticated isolation and filtering. The POI may be
embedded in the NF or external to the NF, connected to its interfaces. The
choice of one, the other, or both approaches is service specific.
{width="3.25in" height="1.1111111111111112in"}
Figure 8.5-1: Embedded vs. external POIs
In figures 8.5-2 and 8.5-3 the POI will be depicted straddling the edge of the
NF to simultaneously indicate both approaches.
Figure 8.5-2 shows the basic job of a POI: to obtain the state, or
communicated user data, of the intercepted service. As the NF changes state,
or as additional user data is generated or forwarded, in the course of
providing the service, the appropriate interceptable events or real-time
content are transferred into the POI.
{width="1.3194444444444444in" height="0.8194444444444444in"}
Figure 8.5-2: POI state capture
Although the POI has access to service state in the NF and information flows
in and out of the NF, the NF shall not be able to access data in the POI, for
obvious security reasons, as depicted in figure 8.5-3. If the POI is embedded,
LI data leakage from the POI back into the non-secure area of the NF shall be
prohibited. If the POI is not embedded, the implementation shall prohibit LI
data leakage back into the NF.
The same requirements apply to TFs.
{width="1.3194444444444444in" height="0.8194444444444444in"}\ Figure 8.5-3:
POI state capture security
Generally, embedded POIs have full access to the state machine of the service
they intercept, while external POIs have to infer the state of the intercepted
service from the events detected on the interfaces or externally applied
traffic filtering criteria.
## 8.6 Deployment considerations
### 8.6.1 General
This clause provides deployment considerations for Lawful Interception.
### 8.6.2 CC-PAG
This clause introduces CC-PAG (CC-POI Aggregator) as an architectural
extension that is located between the MDF3 and CC-POI. The CC-PAG performs the
function of aggregating the xCC from different CC-POIs towards the MDF3 and is
shown in Figure 8.6-1.
Figure 8.6-1: LI architecture showing CC-PAG.
NOTE: The IRI-POI and CC-TF represented in figure 8.6-1 are logical functions
and require correlation information be shared between them; they may be
handled by the same process within the SMF.
The CC-PAG is an optional LI function and may be deployed in networks that
need aggregation of xCC from potentially large number of different CC-POIs
towards the MDF3. The CC-PAG may be deployed closer to the UPFs, to reduce the
impact of latencies, packet drops, and buffering on UPFs for lawful
interception of highspeed user plane traffic. The system resources such as
hardware interfaces, CPUs and memory for the CC-PAG node may be tuned to
balance the forwarding/reception capabilities of CC-POI and MDF3.
As shown in figure 8.6-1, the CC-POI is triggered by the CC-TF to deliver the
xCC (on a per flow basis) to the CC-PAG (via LI_X3A interface) or to the MDF3
(via LI_X3 interface as described in clause 6.2.3).
In the option where CC-PAG is involved, the LIPF configures the CC-PAG with
the appropriate MDF3 address. The CC-PAG address is provided to the CC-POI
using one of the two methods:
> 1) pre-provisioned (e.g. by LIPF over LI_X0 interface) while instructed to
> use the pre-provisioned address over LI_X1;
>
> 2) as a part of the CC intercept trigger by the CC-TF which in turn is
> provisioned by the LIPF over LI_X1.
The CC-PAG aggregates the xCC received from different CC-POIs before
forwarding the same to the MDF3. The xCC is not modified. The LI_X3A interface
is the same as LI_X3 interface on the application level but may be used with
other transport protocol options as described in ETSI TS 103 221-2 [16].
###### ## Annex A (informative): 5G LI network topology views
# A.1 Non-roaming scenario
## A.1.1 General
In a non-roaming scenario, the POIs present in the following NFs provide the
LI functions:
\- AMF.
\- UDM.
\- SMF.
\- UPF.
\- SMSF.
\- NEF.
For the interception of PDU sessions, the EPC CUPS LI model is not extended to
5G where SMF and UPF are involved in delivering the xIRI and xCC associated
with the PDU sessions.
NOTE: The above list of NFs that provide the POI functions may have to be
expanded once a deployment scenario for such a case is defined in the
normative part of the present document.
## A.1.2 Service-based representation with point-to-point LI system
The overall network configuration for 5G in a non-roaming scenario with the LI
aspects is shown in figure A.1-1 using the service-based representation (as
shown in TS 23.501 [2]) with the use of point-to-point LI system.
Figure A.1-1: Network topology showing LI for 5G (service-based
representation) with point-to-point LI system
Figure A.1-1 shows the network topology of 5G system in a service-based
representation; however, all the LI-related interfaces remain to be point-to-
point.
The IRI-POIs present in the AMF, UDM SMF and SMSF deliver the xIRI to the MDF2
and CC-POI present in the UPF delivers the xCC to the MDF3. The MDF3 address
to CC-POI present in UPF is provided by the CC-TF present in the SMF over
LI_T3 reference point.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POIs and the CC-TF present in
the NFs with the intercept related data. The LI_X1 interfaces between the LIPF
and the UPF is to monitor the user plane data.
NOTE: The CC-POI present in the NEF is not shown in figure A.1-1 but will be
present if intercept of those services is supported.
# A.2 Interworking with EPC/E-UTRAN
## A.2.1 General
In EPC/E-UTRAN, the NFs that provide the POI functions are:
\- MME.
\- SGW.
\- PGW (optional).
\- HSS.
> \- SCEF.
In a 5GS, the NFs that provide the POI functions are:
\- AMF.
\- SMF/UPF.
\- UDM.
\- SMSF.
> \- NEF.
In an interworking scenario between the EPC and the 5GS, the AMF in 5GS and
MME in EPC provide the IRI-POI functions for the related attach/registration
related aspects. When the network topology includes SMF + PGW-C and UPF +
PGW-U as the interworking NFs, it is recommended that these provide the POI
functions for the PDU sessions as the target communication traffic coming from
either of the two interworking networks pass through these NFs. In that case,
the interception at the SGW and UPF (if present between the NG-RAN and the UPF
+ PGW-U) is not required unless the condition specified in the NOTE in clause
A.2.2 applies.
In a non-roaming scenario, the IRI-POI present in the HSS + UDM also provide
the LI functions. The IRI-POI present in the SMSF provides the LI functions
for the SMS-related IRI events.
## A.2.2 Topology view for a non-roaming scenario
The overall network configuration for interworking between EPC-EUTRAN and 5GS
in non-roaming scenario with the LI aspects is shown in figure A.2-1.
The 5G core system is shown using the service-based representation (as shown
in TS 23.501 [2]) with the use of point-to-point LI system.
Figure A.2-1: Network topology showing LI for interworking with EPC/E-UTRAN
Figure A.2-1 shows the network topology of 5G system in a service-based
representation, however, all the LI-related interfaces remain to be point-to-
point.
The IRI-POIs present in the AMF, MME, UDM, SMSF and SMF + PGW-C deliver the
xIRI to the MDF2 and CC-POI present in the UPF + PGW-U delivers the xCC to the
MDF3. The MDF3 address to CC-POI present in UPF + PGW-U is provided by the CC-
TF present in the SMF over LI_T3 reference point.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POIs and the CC-TF present in
the NFs with the intercept related data. The LI_X1 interfaces between the LIPF
and the UPF + PGW-U is to monitor the user plane data.
NOTE 1: TS 23.501 [2] notes that there can another UPF between the NG-RAN and
PGW-U + UPF. In that case, the other UPF may also provide the CC-POI functions
for any user plane packets that do not reach the PGW-U \+ UPF.
NOTE 2: The IRI-POIs and CC-POIs present in the NEF and the SCEF are shown as
a combined function, but could be deployed as separate NEF and SCEF.
# A.3 Multiple DN connections in a PDU session
## A.3.1 General
According to TS 23.501 [2], a PDU session can involve multiple UPFs, but
regardless of how many UPFs are involved in the session, the session only
connects to a single DN through one or more DN connections (i.e. connections
to the same DN).
When a PDU session involves multiple UPFs, the interception of user plane
packets can be done in two ways:
\- At one UPF (branching UPF) through which all the user plane packets pass
through.
\- At anchor UPFs.
When the second approach is chosen with branching UPF being one of the anchor
UPFs, redundant delivery of CC should be avoided.
In a non-roaming scenario, the IRI-POI present in UDM also provide the LI
functions.
## A.3.2 Topology view for a non-roaming scenario
The overall network configurations to illustrate the LI with multiple DN
connections (to the same DN) in a PDU session is illustrated in figure A.3-1
and A.3-2.
The 5G core system is shown using the service-based representation (as shown
in TS 23.501 [2]) with the use of point-to-point LI system.
Figure A.3-1: Network topology showing CC-POI at one UPF
The IRI-POIs present in the AMF, MME, UDM, SMSF and SMF deliver the xIRI to
the MDF2 and CC-POI present in the branching UPF (shown as UPF-1) on the
common path to both DN connections delivers the xCC to the MDF3. The MDF3
address to CC-POI present in UPF-1 is provided by the CC-TF present in the SMF
over LI_T3 reference point. In this view, all user plane packets pass through
UPF-1.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POIs and the CC-TF present in
the NFs with the intercept related data. The LI_X1 interfaces between the LIPF
and the UPF is to monitor the user plane data.
Figure A.3-2: Network topology showing CC-POI at two UPFs
The IRI-POIs present in the AMF, MME, UDM, SMSF and SMF deliver the xIRI to
the MDF2. In this example, there is a branching UPF (UPF-B), an anchor UPF for
the DN (UPF-A1) and another anchor UPF for the same DN (UPF-A2). The second
approach (i.e. CC interception at the anchor UPFs) mentioned in A.3.1 is used
to provide the CC interception. The UPF-A1 delivers the xCC generated from the
user plane packets that flow from UE to the DN via UPF-A1 to the MDF3. The CC-
POI present in the UPF-A2 delivers the xCC generated from the user plane
packets that flow UE to the DN via UPF-A2 to the MDF3. The MDF3 address in the
CC-POIs present in UPF-1 and UPF-2 are provided by the CC-TF present in the
SMF over LI_T3 reference point.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POIs and the CC-TF present in
the NFs with the intercept related data. The LI_X1 interfaces between the LIPF
and the UPFs are to monitor the user plane data.
NOTE: In some cases, the branching UPF may be merged with one of the anchor
UPFs. In this case care needs to be taken to avoid duplication of xCC e.g. by
intercepting only on the external N6 interface of each anchor UPF.
# A.4 Non-3GPP access in a non-roaming scenario
## A.4.1 General
When the target UE is connected to the 5G core network via non-3GPP access,
the POIs present in the following NFs of the PLMN where the N3A Entity resides
provide the LI functions:
\- AMF.
\- SMF.
\- UPF.
\- SMSF.
When the PLMN that has the N3A Entity is the HPLMN, as illustrated in clause
A.1, the IRI-POI present in the UDM also provide the LI functions.
When the PLMN that has N3A Entity is different from the PLMN that provides the
3GPP access to the target UE, two different AMFs are involved in handling the
target UE\'s registration accepts (this is not illustrated in this clause). In
this case, depending on the operator policy, the SMSF present in either of the
two networks may perform the routing of SMS messages to and from the target
UE.
The PLMN that provides the 3GPP access can be a VPLMN and PLMN where the N3A
Entity resides can be the HPLMN. In this case, the AMF in the HPLMN provides
the IRI-POI functions for non-3GPP access related registration events when the
target UE is roaming. The SMSF present in the HPLMN may have to provide the
IRI-POI functions for the SMS related messages routed via non-3GPP access
network.
## A.4.2 Topology view
The overall network configuration for non-3GPP access in a non-roaming
scenario with the LI aspects is shown in figures A.4-1, A.4-2 and A.4-3. In
these views, the target UE is not connected to a 3GPP access network.
The 5G core system is shown in the following figures the service-based
representation (as shown in TS 23.501 [2]) with the use of point-to-point LI
system.
Figure A.4-1: Network topology showing LI for non-3GPP access to 5G via N3IWF
Figure A.4-2: Network topology showing LI for non-3GPP access to 5G via TNGF
Figure A.4-3: Network topology showing LI for non-3GPP access to 5G via TWIF
The IRI-POIs present in the AMF, UDM, SMSF and SMF deliver the xIRI to the
MDF2 and CC-POI present in the UPF delivers the xCC to the MDF3. The MDF3
address to CC-POI present in UPF is provided by the CC-TF present in the SMF
over LI_T3 reference point.
The LIPF present in the ADMF provisions the IRI-POIs and the CC-TF present in
the NFs with the intercept related data. The LI_X1 interfaces between the LIPF
and the UPF is to monitor the user plane data.
###### ## Annex B (normative): ADMF functionality
The Administration Function (ADMF) provides the CSP\'s administrative and
management functions for the LI capability.
The ADMF's primary roles and responsibilities include:
\- The logical point of contact from the LEA to the CSP via LI_HI1 for
Lawfully authorised requests (e.g. warrant).
\- Maintaining the CSP / LEA mutually agreed unique Lawful Interception
IDentifier (LIID) for the warrant which is used for all corresponding LI_HI2,
LI_HI3, and LI_HI4 communications for warrant correlation.
\- CSP administration and local management of the warrant including start/stop
times, filter criteria, LEA policy toggles, etc.
\- Deriving internal information (ID mappings, potential POIs, etc.) from the
warrant.
\- For virtualised instances, verifying the authenticity/integrity of CSP LI
functions (e.g. LI function\'s software image) prior to instantiation, see
e.g. ETSI NFV-SEC 011 [10] or equivalent.
\- When required, providing keys to newly instantiated LI functions to enable
decryption of LI specific software.
\- LI functions physical location policy control ensuring LI functions are
within the legal location policy of the warrant.
\- LI Certificate Authority (LI CA, sub-CA of the CSP root CA) for issuing
certificates to LI functions as part of their LI provisioning via LI_X0
interface, see clause 5.6.3.2.
\- Provisioning of all required and valid LI functions instantiated by the CSP
network.
\- Maintaining the master list of all authorised and provisioned LI functions.
\- Managing the termination of LI instances across all impacted LI functions
when the warrant expires or the LEA specifically requests termination of a LI
instance.
\- Certificate revoking when the LI function is terminated or the LI function
is de-instantiated.
\- Maintaining the status of the warrant execution within the CSP (e.g.
accepted, pending/provisioning, active, suspended, de-provisioned, etc.).
\- As agreed between the LEA and CSP, reporting warrant execution status
changes to the LEA as well as responds to warrant audit requests from the LEA.
\- Keeping records of the CSP\'s management of LI related activities (e.g. log
files).
Refer to clause 5.4 LI interfaces, and figures 5.4-1 and 5.6-1 for details on
specific interfaces between the ADMF and other network functions.
###### ## Annex C (informative): LEA initiated suspend and resume
This annex presents a means within current ETSI and 3GPP specifications to
support the temporary suspension (suspend) and subsequent resuming (resume) of
a Lawful Intercept. Temporary suspension of LI is either directly initiated by
the LEA or automatically initiated based on predefined criteria/policy between
the LEA and CSP as part of the warrant. This clause only addresses the case of
LEA initiated temporary suspension of the delivery of LI product to the LEA.
The underlying baseline is that a Lawful Intercept has been fully authorised
and established between the LEA and the CSP via LI_HI with an agreed LIID to
map the warrant to the CSP provided LI product via LI_HI2, LI_HI3 and LI_HI4.
The LEA may request that this active LI instance be temporarily suspended.
This means, at a minimum, that the CSP no longer delivers (or buffers) LI
product to the LEA.
LEA initiated LI suspension may involve the following steps:
\- The LEA, via LI_HI1, sends an Update Request, referencing the intercept,
with the DesiredStatus of Suspended; reference ETSI TS 103 120 [7].
\- The ADMF, via LI_X1, deactivates/deprovisions the required LI Functions,
reference ETSI TS 103 221-1 [8]. These LI Functions then locally fully delete
the active intercept as required and hence stops any subsequent LI_HI2/3
delivery.
\- The ADMF should maintain all the intercept warrant information of the
original intercept, with the status advanced to Suspended.
\- The MDFs for which the intercept instance has been de-activated send an
LI_HI4 deactivation notification to the LEMF.
\- The ADMF sends an Update Response message to the LEA, via LI_HI1, with a
status of Suspended.
To resume the LI product delivery, this may involve the following steps:
\- The LEA sends the CSP, via LI_H1, an Update Request, referencing the
original intercept, with the DesiredStatus of Active. This is equivalent to
the initial LI activation but without having to repeat all the warrant
information in the original intercept request, and the existing LIID is
maintained. Sessions that were active before the intercept suspension that are
still active when resumed, or new sessions initiated while the intercept is
resumed, are handled as per mid-call intercept activation.
\- The ADMF, via LI_X1, re-provisions the de-activated LI Functions just as
for a new intercept to re-instantiate the intercept.
NOTE: This implies all LI Product deliveries will restart just as for a new
intercept; e.g. PDU sequence numbers will restart at zero, etc.
\- The re-provisioned MDFs send an LI_HI4 activation notification to the LEMF.
\- The ADMF sends an Update Response message to the LEA, via LI_HI1, with a
status of Active.
If the intercept (warrant) timespan expires or the LEA directly requests
intercept deactivation while the intercept is in a suspended state, all
remaining LI Functions are deactivated/deprovisioned and the rest of LI
instance is taken down as per usual warrant deactivation.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Additional RCS specific LI details
# D.1 General
The following sub-clauses provide additional details for LI for RCS. Unless
specified, the details provided in clause 7.13 apply to all of the following
sub-clauses. In general, the specific architecture is used as an example, the
location of the POIs may need to be adjusted based on implementation.
The current document defines LI for the following RCS services at the RCS
Servers:
\- Capability discovery: This service enhances service usability by allowing a
user to understand the subset of RCS services available to access and/or
communicate with the user's contacts, at certain points in time.
\- Pager mode standalone messaging: This service allows delivering one
standalone message which does not exceed 1300 bytes in size to one or several
recipients. No SIP session is established to deliver that message. The message
is carried in a SIP MESSAGE request.
\- Large message mode standalone messaging: This service allows `delivering
one standalone message which is larger than 1300 bytes in size to one or more
recipients. A SIP session is established for the delivery of one message only.
The message is carried on the user plane.
\- 1-to-1 chat: This service allows establishing a SIP session between two
participants. This session is used to exchange user plane messages. Unlike
large message mode standalone messaging, there is no limit to the number of
messages being exchanged.
\- Group chat: This service allows establishing a SIP session between several
participants. This session is used to exchange user plane messages.
\- File URL transfer: Delivery of the URL of a file being uploaded to the HTTP
Content Server. The delivery of the URL of the file is performed either by
pager mode standalone messaging, large message mode standalone messaging,
1-to-1 chat or group chat.
The current document defines LI for the following RCS services at the HTTP
Content Servers:
\- File upload. A target UE uploads a file to the HTTP Content Server. If the
upload procedure is successful, the target UE is provided with a file transfer
message body containing file metadata including the file download URL by the
HTTP Content Server.
\- File download. A target UE downloads a file or any UE downloads a file
uploaded by a target from the HTTP Content Server using a download URL. The
URL may have been received via one of the RCS messaging services.
# D.2 LI for Registration and Deregistration
## D.2.1 Background
RCS Registration is usually handled by the IMS automatically when a user that
is authorised RCS Services registers to the IMS with a UE that supports RCS
Services.
## D.2.2 Architecture
The figure 7.13.2-1 without the CC-POI in the RCS Server provides the
architecture for LI for capability discovery.
In a normal deployment, the S-CSCF, a Presence Server or Messaging Server may
perform the function of the RCS Server in figure 7.13.2-1.
# D.3 LI for capability discovery
## D.3.1 Background
The capability or service discovery mechanism in RCS is a process which
enhances service usability by allowing a RCS user to exchange its own RCS
service capabilities and to understand the RCS service capabilities of another
RCS user, at certain points in time.
When available, the RCS specification provides two alternative mechanisms to
perform the capability discovery:
\- SIP OPTIONS exchange: The SIP OPTIONS end-to-end message is used by one RCS
user (e.g., User A) to query the capabilities (services which the other user
has available) of the other RCS user (e.g., User B). The SIP OPTIONS message
passes the information about which capabilities are supported by User A and
the response contains information about which capabilities are supported by
User B. Using this method, both users get updated information in a single
transaction.
\- Presence: In this case, instead of performing an end-to-end transaction,
the capabilities are queried against a presence server which is part of the
RCS Server as defined in GSMA RCC.07 [35] clause 2.6.1.2.
When the SIP OPTIONS request is used, user A includes user A's RCS
capabilities and the IMPU of user B. The response is any of the following:
\- SIP 200 OK including at least, one of the tags assigned to the RCS
Services. User B is an RCS user. The capabilities returned in the SIP 200 OK
response are considered as the current communication options with user B.
\- SIP 200 OK not including any of the tags used by RCS services. User B is
registered to IMS, but not with an RCS client. User B is not an RCS user. Only
the non-RCS communication services (e.g. voice calls, SMS, MMS, etc.) are
indicated as available.
\- SIP 480 TEMPORARY UNAVAILABLE or 408 REQUEST TIMEOUT returned by the
network if user B is an IMS (and potentially thus an RCS) user, but is
currently not registered.
\- 404 Not Found or 604 Does Not Exist Anywhere. User B is not considered as
an IMS user nor an RCS user. Only the non-RCS communication services (e.g.,
voice calls, SMS, MMS, etc.) are indicated as available.
When presence is used:
\- After user A has registered to IMS, User A publishes their RCS capabilities
in a Presence document that is published by using the SIP PUBLISH request. If
changes are required in the published capabilities (e.g., due to RAT change),
a new PUBLISH request is sent. When the client/device is switched off, the
published capabilities are removed from the presence server before
deregistering from IMS by sending another PUBLISH request.
\- When User A wants to use RCS, User A requests the RCS capabilities of user
B by sending SIP SUBSCRIBE requests. The Presence server of User B sends a SIP
NOTIFY request to User A containing the RCS capabilities of User B.
## D.3.2 Architecture
The figure 7.13.2-1 without the CC-POI in the RCS Server provides the
architecture for LI for capability discovery.
In a normal deployment, if SIP OPTIONS are used for capability discovery, the
Messaging Server performs the function of the RCS Server in figure 7.13.2-1.
In a normal deployment, if presence is used for capability discovery, the
presence server and S-CSCF performs the function of the RCS Server in figure
7.13.2-1.
# D.4 LI for standalone messaging
## D.4.1 Background
Standalone messaging is based on the OMA CPM Pager Mode and Large Message Mode
mechanisms as described in OMA CPM [34].
When the size of a message does not exceed 1300 bytes, it can be sent as a
pager mode standalone message carried directly within the body of a SIP
MESSAGE. It may be sent to one or many destinations. Using the SIP MESSAGE
method, the message body is CPIM-formatted message as specified in RFC 3862
[38]. The SIP/IP Core provides the routing between the RCS Server and RCS
Clients without establishing a SIP session.
The origination of the pager mode standalone message may request to receive a
disposition status notification when the message is delivered and/or displayed
to the destination of the message. If sent, these messages will follow the
reverse path indicated in the message they relate to. These messages may be
used for 1-to-1 or 1-to-many pager mode messaging and the notification details
are carried within the body of a SIP MESSAGE.
If a standalone message is larger than 1300 bytes, large message mode is used.
In large message mode, the contents of the message are not inserted into the
SIP message but carried using MSRP as defined in RFC 4975 [36] and RFC 6714
[37]. A SIP session is established between the interested parties (sender and
all receivers) with MSRP as the media Stream. The CPIM-formatted messages are
then transmitted using MSRP data chunks.
Large Message Mode SIP sessions should not be confused with a chat session as
no chat session is established. The SIP session is only used to transmit
exactly one large message after which the SIP session is torn down. If
delivery and/or display notifications need to be returned by the recipient(s),
these notifications are CPIM-formatted messages carried within MSRP data
chunks inside the SIP session or within SIP MESSAGEs delivered outside the SIP
session as pager mode messages.
## D.4.2 Architecture
The figure 7.13.2-1 provides the architecture for LI for pager mode standalone
messaging.
In a normal deployment, the P-CSCF or S-CSCF perform the function of the RCS
Server in figure 7.13.2-1.
# D.5 LI for chat
## D.5.1 Background
The RCS 1-to-1 chat service and group chat service use SIP procedures for the
setup of chat sessions and MSRP for the exchange of user messages as defined
in RCC.07 [35] clause 3.2.3. Each MSRP SEND request containing a user message
contains a request to receive a delivery notification and possibly a display
notification. The client therefore always includes the header field for
delivery notification when sending a message. The notifications may be
delivered within the 1-to-1 chat session as MSRP SEND requests or outside the
1-to-1 chat session as a pager mode message delivery notification. Multimedia
content is not permitted in user messages. Only text/plain user messages can
be exchanged.
For the establishment of a group chat session, an RCS user selects at least 2
contacts capable of the chat service. Only ad-hoc groups are authorized. An
ad-hoc group is a list of addresses created by the target dynamically. Pre-
defined group are not permitted. Extending of a 1-to-1 chat to a group chat is
not applicable for the current version of the RCS specification. Users may
dynamically add additional participants to a group chat, if they are capable
to support chat service.
## D.5.2 Architecture
The figure 7.13.2-1 provides the architecture for LI for 1-to-1 chat.
# D.6 LI for file transfer
## D.6.1 Background
When an RCS user desires to send a file to one or more other RCS users, the
file URL transfer service is used. The user first uploads the file to a HTTP
Content Server, and then uses pager mode standalone messaging, large message
mode standalone messaging, 1-to-1 Chat or group chat procedures described in
sections D.4 and D.5 respectively to send the URL of the file to the
recipient(s).
When using pager mode standalone messaging, the originating client sends the
URL of the file in a SIP MESSAGE as a CPIM-formatted message. When using large
message mode standalone messaging, 1-to-1 chat or group chat the originating
client sends the URIL of the file in MSRP data chunk.
The originating client may request delivery and/or display notification to the
recipient(s).
If the recipients send status notification(s), they are sent as CPIM-formatted
messages and may be delivered by the recipient in a SIP MESSAGE when using
pager mode standalone messaging and in an MSRP data chunk when using large
message mode standalone messaging, 1-to-1 chat or group chat.
## D.6.2 Architecture
The figure 7.13.2-1 provides the architecture for LI for file transfer.
###### ## Annex E (informative): STIR/SHAKEN operation
# E.1 General
This annex defines STIR (Secure Telephony Identity Revisited), SHAKEN (Secure
Handling of Asserted information using toKENs), eCNAM (Enhanced Calling Name)
and RCD (Rich Call Data) and their application to different call scenarios.
# E.2 STIR/SHAKEN
## E.2.1 STIR/SHAKEN for telephony
STIR (Secure Telephony Identity Revisited) and SHAKEN (Secure Handling of
Asserted information using toKENs) are the frameworks to prevent the
completion of illegally spoofed telephony sessions. Call spoofing is when a
session originator changes the calling number to hide or change which calling
number is shown on the telephony session display.
STIR provides the ability within SIP to authenticate caller ID, and SHAKEN
defines the end-to-end architecture to implement caller ID authentication
using STIR in the telephone network.
STIR/SHAKEN uses digital certificates, based on common public key cryptography
techniques, to ensure the calling number of a telephony session is secure.
Each telephone service provider obtains its digital certificates from a
trusted certificate authority. The certificate technology enables verifying
that the calling number is accurate and has not been spoofed.
Figure E.2.1-1 below depicts the SHAKEN reference architecture as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [39] when using end-to-end SIP signalling.
Figure E.2.1-1: SHAKEN reference architecture for end-to-end SIP signaling
It is based on IMS architecture. The \"application server (AS) for signing\"
is an HTTP-based application server that performs the function of the
authentication service defined in RFC 8224 [40] for originating number
identity and in RFC 8946 [41] for diverting number identity. The \"AS for
verification\" is an HTTP-based application server that performs the function
of the verification service defined in RFC 8224 [40] and in RFC 8946 [41].
Certificate Repository (CR) represents the publicly accessible store for
public key certificates.
Either the Telephony AS or IBCF in the originating service provider's network
invokes the AS for signing which creates a digital signature for the call
called a PASSportT (Personal Assertion Token) assigned to a SIP Identity
header. The IBCF or Telephony AS in the terminating service provider's network
invokes the AS for verification which verifies the digital signature of the
call. The AS includes a VERSTAT parameter in the P-Asserted-Identity or From
header of the SIP INVITE request, with possible values of TN-Validation-
Passed, TN-Validation-Failed or No-TN-Validation.
A SIP INVITE request might have one Identity added by an authentication
service at the originating administrative domain and then other Identity
header fields added by some further intermediaries. The presence of multiple
Identity header fields within a SIP INVITE request raises the prospect that a
verification service could receive a message containing both valid and invalid
Identity header fields. As a guideline, RFC 8224 [40] recommends that only if
a verifier determines that all Identity header fields within a message are
invalid should the request be considered to have an invalid identity. If at
least one Identity header field value is valid and from a trusted source, then
relying parties can use that header for authorization decisions regardless of
whether other untrusted or invalid Identity headers appear in a request.
## E.2.2 STIR/SHAKEN for intra-network telephony
Some telecommunication regulation authorities may force CSPs implementing
STIR/SHAKEN even for intra-network voice sessions. Figure E.2.2-1 depicts the
SHAKEN reference architecture for such scenario when using end-to-end SIP
signalling. The Telephony AS is the default approach to provide STIR/SHAKEN
capabilities, i.e. is capable of invoking the AS for signing on the
originating side and AS for verification on the terminating side.
Figure E.2.2-1: SHAKEN reference architecture for intra-network telephony
## E.2.3 STIR/SHAKEN for messaging
STIR/SHAKEN could apply to providing protection for textual and multimedia
messaging as specified in the IETF draft ietf-stir-messaging-07 [46].
A PASSporT could be used to securely negotiate a session over which messages
will be exchanged; this is applicable for example to the following RCS
services: large message mode standalone messaging, 1-to-1 chat and group chat
where messages are exchanged using MSRP (Message Session Relay Protocol) after
the SIP ssession is established. In these scenarios, usage of STIR/SHAKEN is
very similar to that for voice sessions.
In sessionless scenarios such as RCS pager mode standalone messaging service,
a PASSporT could be generated on a per-message (i.e. SIP MESSAGE) basis with
its own built-in message security. An Identity header could be added to any
SIP MESSAGE request, but without some extension to the PASSporT claims, the
PASSporT would offer no protection to the message content. In IETF draft-ietf-
stir-messaging-07 [46], PASSporT provides its own integrity check for message
contents as part of its assertions through a new claim which is here defined
to provide a hash over message contents. A new \"msg\" PASSporT Type is
defined for that purpose. A new optional claim \"msgi\" provides a digest over
a MIME body (i.e. body of the SIP MESSAGE). The PASSporT is conveyed in an
Identity header field in the SIP MESSAGE request. The authentication and
verification service procedures for populating that PASSporT follow the same
procedures as for a voice session, with the addition of the \"msgi\" claim.
## E.2.4 Out of band SHAKEN
In today's PSTN, and for the foreseeable future, the Identity header may fail
to arrive at the terminating service provider's network for verification by
their AS for verification because the call is not transmitted using SIP end to
end. However, Out-of-Band SHAKEN remedies this problem. A possible scenario is
described in figure E.2.4-1.
Figure E.2.4-1: Out of band SHAKEN reference architecture for non end-to-end
SIP signaling
With this solution, the identity token is sent to the terminating service
provider separately, out-of-band, through implementation of a Call Placement
Service (CPS).All other SHAKEN steps for authentication, use of certificates
and verification remain the same. CPS as defined in RFC 8816 [45] permits the
identity token to be stored during call processing and retrieved for
verification purposes when a session is not using end-to-end SIP signaling,
i.e. a leg in the session is using circuit switching and ISUP signaling.
Out-of-Band SHAKEN is used when a service provider wants to use STIR/SHAKEN
for a call sent or received across a non-SIP network segment. For example,
Out-of-Band SHAKEN would be used in the following situations:
\- A service provider originating a call using TDM signaling would generate
the applicable PASSporTs using their AS for signing and publish them to a CPS.
\- An Intermediate Service Provider converting a session from SIP to TDM would
publish all PASSporTs received in SIP signaling for that call to a CPS.
\- An Intermediate Service Provider converting a call from TDM to SIP would
retrieve all PASSporTs for that call from a CPS and insert them into the SIP
signaling for that call.
\- A service provider terminating a call using TDM signaling would retrieve
all PASSporTs for that call from a CPS and verify the call using their AS for
verification.
Service providers originating, transiting, or terminating calls using only SIP
signaling do not use Out-of-Band SHAKEN. They use PASSporTs in SIP signaling.
Intermediate providers transiting calls with TDM signaling only do not use
Out-of-Band SHAKEN. An upstream provider would have already published
PASSporTs for those calls to a CPS. There is no need for an all-TDM
intermediate provider to do anything as shown in figure E.3.4-2. The
interworking function (IWF) is the interface to the AS for signing at the
originating side and the interface to the AS for verification at the
terminated side.

signaling**
## E.2.5 STIR/SHAKEN and forwarded calls
In case of call forwarding, the original called party number is not the number
to which a call is delivered. The SIP headers such as \"History-Info\",
\"Diversion\" and \"To\" do not provide any cryptographic assurance of secure
redirection. RFC 8946 [41] extends the SIP identity token (i.e. PASSporT) with
an explicit indication that the original called number no longer reflects the
destination to which a call is intended to be delivered via a \"div\"
parameter. It indicates a previous destination for a session during its
routing process. When a retargeting entity receives a call signed with the SIP
Identity token, it may act as an authentication service and create a new SIP
Identity token containing the "div" parameter to attach to the session.
# E.3 Enhanced caller data
## E.3.1 General
Two approaches, namely Rich Call Data (RCD) and eCNAM (Enhanced Calling Name)
build on STIR/SHAKEN to provide additional caller information rendered to the
callee during alerting to encourage the callee to answer the session.
## E.3.2 RCD
RCD is described in an IETF draft draft-ietf-stir-passport-rcd-12 [42]. RCD is
of two main categories. The first data is a more traditional set of
information about a caller associated with \"display-name\", typically a
textual description of the caller in the SIP INVITE. The second category is a
set of RCD that is defined as part of the jCard (JSON format for vCard) as
specified in RFC 7095 [43]. RCD is inserted in the SIP Identity header token
and is digitally signed. If a session is not authenticated and signed then RCD
cannot be used. While RCD can be provided by an originating authentication
service, an intermediary in the session path could also acquire RCD by
querying a third-party service. Such a service effectively acts as a STIR
authentication service, generating its own Identity token including RCD, and
that token could be attached to a SIP session by either the originating or
terminating side.
## E.3.3 eCNAM
The Enhanced Calling Name (eCNAM) service defined in TS 24.196 [44] provides
the terminating user with a name that identifies the originating user, and
metadata about that originating user (e.g. address, language, etc.), like with
RCD. eCNAM data is managed by the originating network and stored in an
authoritative database. To enable the terminating network to retrieve eCNAM
data, the terminating service provider queries the database using the calling
telephone number as the key, to obtain calling display name and other
metadata.
In both RCD and eCNAM the terminating network shall populate the received name
and received metadata elements in appropriate SIP headers in the INVITE
request being forwarded to the terminating UE.
# E.4 STIR/SHAKEN call flow example
The following procedure explains STIR/SHAKEN operation when SIP signaling is
carried end-to-end between an originating and terminating service provider as
illustrated in figure E.4.1-1.
Figure E.4.1-1: SHAKEN reference call flow using end-to-end SIP signalling
1\. The originating UE, which first successfully registers to IMS creates a
SIP INVITE request.
2\. The S-CSCF of the originating service provider passes the SIP INVITE
request to the Telephony AS.
3\. The Telephony AS runs the telephony services related to the originating
user and:
\- May send a signing request (HTTP POST request) to the AS for signing. AS
for signing using its private key generates an Identity header as defined in
RFC 8224 [40] using the Caller ID to attest for the validity of the calling
number. The AS for signing returns the signing response (HTTP 200 OK)
containing the Identity header to telephony AS. The Telephony AS signs the SIP
INVITE request with the SIP Identity header. The Telephony AS also obtains
Identity header for each diverting identity as defined in RFC 8946 [41].
\- May not sign the SIP INVITE request with the SIP Identity header if it
knows the egress IBCF supports invoking the AS for signing for providing an
Identity header field.
4\. The Telephony AS passes the SIP INVITE request back to the S-CSCF.
5\. The S-CSCF, through standard resolution, routes the telephony session to
the egress IBCF.
6\. If the egress IBCF does not find an Identity header field in the received
SIP INVITE request, the IBCF sends a signing request (HTTP POST request) to
the AS for signing. When the response to the request is received, the IBCF
shall include the value of the \"identity\" claim in an Identity header field
in the SIP INVITE request. If the SIP INVITE request contains one or more
History-Info header fields, that determine that one or several diversions have
occurred, the IBCF sends a signing request for each of the identities to be
signed if no corresponding Identity header fields are found in the SIP INVITE
request. The IBCF shall include the value of the \"identity\" claim in an
Identity header field in the SIP INVITE request.
7\. The SIP INVITE request is routed over the NNI through the standard inter-
domain routing configuration. The terminating service provider ingress IBCF
receives the SIP INVITE request containing one or more Identity header fields
over the NNI.
8\. The IBCF uses the identity header fields to build and send a verification
request (HTTPS POST request) to the AS for verification related to the
originating identity and forwarding identities if the IBCF supports invoking
the AS for verification.
9\. The AS for verification uses the \"x5u\" key in the Identity header field
to determine the CR Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and makes an HTTPS
request to the CR. The AS for verification validates the certificate and then
extracts the public key. It uses the public key to verify the signature in the
Identity header field, which validates the Caller ID used when signing the SIP
INVITE request on the originating service provider's AS for signing.
10\. The AS for verification returns a verification response (200 OK) to the
ingress IBCF which adds the verification result (TN-Validation-Passed, TN-
Validation-Failed, No-TN-Validation) as a VERSTAT parameter to the P-Asserted-
Identity or From header in the SIP INVITE request. The TN-Validation-Failed
result is associated with a failure response code to identify the specific
error. The standard does not propose any authorization policy to follow based
on the presence of a valid Identity header field, the presence of an invalid
Identity header field or the absence of an Identity header field. However, it
is anticipated that local policies could involve making different forwarding
decisions or changing how the user is alerted or how identity is rendered in
UE implementations.
11\. The ingress IBCF passes the SIP INVITE request to the terminating S-CSCF.
12\. The terminating S-CSCF passes the SIP INVITE request to the terminating
Telephony AS.
13\. If the verification has not been performed by the ingress IBCF, the
Telephony AS runs the verification procedure toward the AS for verification
before running the telephony services related to the terminating identity.
14\. If the validation is successful, the SIP INVITE request is passed back to
the terminating S-CSCF which continues to set up the session to the
terminating UE.
15\. The terminating UE receives the SIP INVITE request and normal SIP
processing of the session continues.
