In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 NEF-specific security requirements and related test cases
## 4.1 Introduction
NEF specific security requirements include both requirements derived from NEF-
specific security functional requirements as well as security requirements
derived from threats specific to NEF as described in TR 33.926 [5]. Generic
security requirements and test cases common to other network product classes
have been captured in TS 33.117 [6] and are not repeated in the present
document.
## 4.2 NEF-specific security functional adaptations of requirements and
related test cases
### 4.2.0 Introduction
The present clause describes the security functional requirements and the
corresponding test cases for NEF network product class. The proposed security
requirements are classified in two groups:
\- Security functional requirements derived from TS 33.501 [2] and detailed in
clause 4.2.2.
\- General security functional requirements which include requirements not
already addressed in TS 33.501 [2] but whose support is also important to
ensure that NEF conforms to a common security baseline detailed in clause
4.2.3.
### 4.2.1 Void
### 4.2.2 Security functional requirements on the NEF deriving from 3GPP
specifications and related test cases
#### 4.2.2.0 General
The general approach in TS 33.117 [3] clause 4.2.2.1 and all the requirements
and test cases in TS 33.117 [3] clause 4.2.2.2 related to SBA/SBI aspect apply
to the NEF network product class.
#### 4.2.2.1 Security functional requirements on the NEF deriving from 3GPP
specifications -- TS 33.501 [2]
4.2.2.1.1 Authentication on application function
_Requirement Name:_ Authentication on application function
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 33.501 [2], clause 5.9.2.3, and clause 12.2
_Requirement Description:_ \"Mutual authentication between the NEF and
Application Function shall be supported\" as specified in TS 33.501 [2],
clause 5.9.2.3. \"For authentication between NEF and an Application Function
that resides outside the 3GPP operator domain, mutual authentication based on
client and server certificates shall be performed between the NEF and AF using
TLS\" and \"Certificate based authentication shall follow the profiles given
in 3GPP TS 33.210 [3], clause 6.2.\" as specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause
12.2.
_Threat References_ : TR 33.926 [5], clause I.2.2.1, No authentication on
application function
_**Test Case** :_
**Test Name:** TC_CP_AUTH_AF_NEF
**Purpose:** To verify that the NEF can authenticate application function and
establish TLS connection towards the application server with certificate based
authentication, and may authenticate application function and establish TLS
connection towards the application server with pre-shared key based
authentication.
**Pre-Condition:**
\- The NEF network product shall be connected in emulated/real network
environments.
\- In order to establish TLS connections to the NEF network product, the
application function shall offer a feature that is supported by the NEF
network product, including protocol version and combination of cryptographic
algorithms.
\- The application function and the NEF network product shall support
certificate based authentication, and may support pre-shared key based
authentication.
\- If the NEF network product does not support CAPIF as specified in clause
6.2.5.1 in TS 23.501 [3], the certificates or the pre-shared key shall be
provisioned in the NEF network product.
\- If the NEF network product supports CAPIF, the certificates or the pre-
shared key shall be provisioned in the CAPIF core function, the CAPIF core
function shall be able to select appropriate authentication method as defined
in the sub-clause 6.5.2 in TS 33.122 [4].
**Execution Steps:**
1\. If certificate based authentication is used, provision correct certificate
on the application function, if pre-shared key based authentication is used,
provision same pre-shared key on the application function.
2\. The application function shall initiate establishment of TLS connection
towards the NEF network product, and check whether a TLS connection is
established successfully.
3\. If certificate based authentication is used, provision incorrect
certificate on the application function, if pre-shared key based
authentication is used, provision different pre-shared key on the application
function.
4\. The application function shall initiate establishment of TLS connection
towards the NEF network product, and check whether no new TLS connection is
established.
**Expected Results:**
Only one TLS connection is established at step 2.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g., Screenshot containing the
operational results.
4.2.2.1.2 Authorization on northbound APIs
_Requirement Name:_ Authorization on application function
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 33.501 [2], clause 12.4
_Requirement Description:_ \"The NEF shall authorize the requests from
Application Function using OAuth-based authorization mechanism, the specific
authorization mechanisms shall follow the provisions given in RFC 6749 [43]\"
as specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause 12.4.
_Threat References_ : TR 33.926 [5], clause I.2.2.2, No authorization on
northbound APIs
_**Test Case** :_
**Test Name:** TC_CP_AUTHOR_AF_NEF
**Purpose:** To verify that the NEF can authorize application function.
**Pre-Condition:**
\- The NEF network product shall be connected in emulated/real network
environments.
\- The application function and the NEF network product shall support OAuth-
based authorization mechanism.
\- An authorization server (e.g. NRF, or CAPIF core function) that supports
OAuth2 protocol to authorize NEF northbound APIs using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant has been deployed.
\- The TLS connection between the NEF network product and the application
function has been established.
\- The authorization server is configured to grant the application function to
access a northbound API of the NEF network product, called NEF northbound API
A.
**Execution Steps:**
Test 1: without token:
1\. The application function invokes Obtain_Authorization service towards the
authorization server to get a token from the authorization server for
accessing the NEF northbound API A.
2\. The application function invokes NEF northbound API A.
3\. The tester triggers the application function to invoke another northbound
API of the NEF network product, called NEF northbound API B, without token.
Test 2: With incorrect token:
1\. The application function invokes Obtain_Authorization service towards the
authorization server to get a token from the authorization server for
accessing the NEF northbound API A.
2\. The application function invokes NEF northbound API A.
3\. The tester triggers the application function to invoke the NEF northbound
API B with a fake token.
**Expected Results:**
The invoking of NEF northbound API A succeeds, while the invoking of NEF
northbound API B fails.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g., Screenshot containing the
operational results.
