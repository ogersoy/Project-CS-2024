In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

unique.
**Pre-Conditions:**
Test environment is set up with SMF, which may be real or simulated, and UPF
under test. The tester is able to trace traffic between the UPF under test and
the SMF (real or simulated). SMF configures UPF under test to generate the
TEIDs.
**Execution Steps:**
1) The tester intercepts the traffic between the UPF under test and the SMF.
2) The tester triggers the maximum number of concurrent N4 session
establishment requests.
3) The tester captures the N4 session establishment responses sent from UPF to
SMF and verifies that the F-TEID created for each generated response is
unique.

belongs to an active PDU session and discard all others.\" as specified in TS
33.501[5], clause 5.9.3.4.
_Threat Reference:_ TR 33.926 [7], Clause L.2.5, \"invalid user plane data
forwarding\"
**TEST CASE:**
NOTE 1: This test case is only applicable to UPF supporting IPUPS.
**Test Name:** TC_IPUPS_PACKET_HANDLING
**Purpose:**
Verify that the packets not belonging to an active PDU session is discarded.
**Pre-Conditions:**
Test environment is set up with a V-SMF, an H-SMF, an H-UPF and a gNB which
may be simulated.
**Execution Steps:**
1) The V-SMF requests the UPF with IPUPS functionality under test to establish
an N4 session for a PDU session in home-routing roaming. The UPF with IPUPS
functionality under test responds to the SMF with the F-TEID for the N9 tunnel
towards the H-UPF, and the F-TEID for the N3 tunnel towards the gNB.
2) The V-SMF requests the H-SMF to establish a PDU session providing the
received F-TEID for the N9 tunnel.
3) The H-SMF requests the H-UPF to establish an N4 session providing the
received F-TEID for the N9 tunnel. H-UPF in the response provides its F-TEID
for the N9 tunnel. The H-SMF provides the received F-TEID from the H-UPF to
the V-SMF.
4) The V-SMF requests the gNB to allocate resource for the PDU session
providing the F-TEID for the N3 tunnel received at step 1. The gNB replies
with its F-TEID for the N3 tunnel to the V-SMF.
5) The V-SMF provides the UPF with IPUPS functionality under test with the
received F-TEID assigned by the gNB for the N3 tunnel and the received F-TEID
assigned by the H-UPF for the N9 tunnel.
6) The H-UPF is triggered to send GTP-U packets using the F-TEID assigned by
the V-UPF for the N9 tunnel.
7) The H-UPF is triggered to send GTP-U packets using an F-TEID different than
the one assigned by V-UPF for N9 tunnel.
**Expected Results:**
When the H-UPF is triggered to send GTP-U packets using the F-TEID assigned by
the V-UPF for the N9 tunnel (step 6 in the execution steps), GTP-U packets are
witnessed over the N3 tunnel.
When the H-UPF is triggered to send GTP-U packets using an F-TEID different
than the one assigned by the V-UPF (step 7 in the execution steps), no GTP-U
packets are witnessed over the N3 tunnel.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Files recording the GTP packets captured (e.g. pcap trace).
#### 4.2.2.8 Protection against malformed GTP-U messages
_Requirement Name:_ Protection against malformed GTP-U messages
_Requirement Reference: TS 33.501[8], clause 5.9.3.4_

The expected results in clause 4.4.4 of TS 33.117 [3] apply except that the
protocol and the interface contained in the testing documentation are GTP-U
and N9 respectively.
