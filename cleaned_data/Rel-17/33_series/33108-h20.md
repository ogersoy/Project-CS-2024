# Introduction
This Technical Specification has been produced by 3GPP TSG SA to allow for the
standardization in the area of lawful interception of telecommunications. This
document addresses the handover interfaces for lawful interception of Packet-
Data Services, Circuit Switched Services, Multimedia Services within the
Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Evolved Packet System
(EPS). The specification defines the handover interfaces for delivery of
lawful interception Intercept Related Information (IRI) and Content of
Communication (CC) to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility.
Laws of individual nations and regional institutions (e.g. European Union),
and sometimes licensing and operating conditions define a need to intercept
telecommunications traffic and related information in modern
telecommunications systems. It has to be noted that lawful interception shall
always be done in accordance with the applicable national or regional laws and
technical regulations. Nothing in this specification, including the
definitions, is intended to supplant national law.
This specification should be used in conjunction with TS 33.106 [18] and TS
33.107 [19] in the same release. This specification may also be used with
earlier releases of TS 33.106 [18] and TS 33.107 [19], as well as for earlier
releases of UMTS and GPRS.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the handover interfaces for Lawful Interception
(LI) of Packet-Data Services, Circuit Switched Services, Multimedia Services
within the UMTS network and Evolved Packet System (EPS). The handover
interface in this context includes the delivery of Intercept Related
Information (IRI) through the Handover Interface 2 (HI2) and Content of
Communication (CC) through the Handover Interface 3 (HI3) to the Law
Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF).

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [38] and the following apply.
**access provider:** access provider provides a user of some network with
access from the user\'s terminal to that network.
NOTE 1: This definition applies specifically for the present document. In a
particular case, the access provider and network operator may be a common
commercial entity.
**(to) buffer:** temporary storing of information in case the necessary
telecommunication connection to transport information to the LEMF is
temporarily unavailable.
**communication:** Information transfer according to agreed conventions.
**content of communication:** information exchanged between two or more users
of a telecommunications service, excluding intercept related information. This
includes information which may, as part of some telecommunications service, be
stored by one user for subsequent retrieval by another.
**handover interface:** physical and logical interface across which the
interception measures are requested from network operator / access provider /
service provider, and the results of interception are delivered from a network
operator / access provider / service provider to a law enforcement monitoring
facility.
**identity:** technical label which may represent the origin or destination of
any telecommunications traffic, as a rule clearly identified by a physical
telecommunications identity number (such as a telephone number) or the logical
or virtual telecommunications identity number (such as a personal number)
which the subscriber can assign to a physical access on a case-by-case basis.
**interception:** action (based on the law), performed by a network operator /
access provider / service provider, of making available certain information
and providing that information to a law enforcement monitoring facility.
NOTE 2: In the present document the term interception is not used to describe
the action of observing communications by a law enforcement agency.
**interception configuration information:** information related to the
configuration of interception.
**interception interface:** physical and logical locations within the network
operator\'s / access provider\'s / service provider\'s telecommunications
facilities where access to the content of communication and intercept related
information is provided. The interception interface is not necessarily a
single, fixed point.
**interception measure:** technical measure which facilitates the interception
of telecommunications traffic pursuant to the relevant national laws and
regulations.
**intercept related information:** collection of information or data
associated with telecommunication services involving the target identity,
specifically communication associated information or data (e.g. unsuccessful
communication attempts), service associated information or data and location
information.
**internal intercepting function:** point within a network or network element
at which the content of communication and the intercept related information
are made available.
**internal network interface:** network\'s internal interface between the
Internal Intercepting Function and a mediation device.
**invocation and operation:** describes the action and conditions under which
the service is brought into operation; in the case of a lawful interception
this may only be on a particular communication. It should be noted that when
lawful interception is activated, it shall be invoked on all communications
(Invocation takes place either subsequent to or simultaneously with
activation.). Operation is the procedure which occurs once a service has been
invoked.
NOTE 3: The definition is based on ITU‑T Recommendation X.882 [8], but has
been adapted for the special application of lawful interception, instead of
supplementary services.
**law enforcement agency:** organization authorized by a lawful authorization
based on a national law to request interception measures and to receive the
results of telecommunications interceptions.
**law enforcement monitoring facility:** law enforcement facility designated
as the transmission destination for the results of interception relating to a
particular target.
**lawful authorization:** permission granted to a LEA under certain conditions
to intercept specified telecommunications and requiring co-operation from a
network operator / access provider / service provider. Typically this refers
to a warrant or order issued by a lawfully authorized body.
**lawful interception:** see interception.
**lawful interception identifier:** identifier for a particular interception.
**Location Dependent Interception:** is interception of a target mobile within
a network service area that is restricted to one or several Interception Areas
(IA).
**location information:** information relating to the geographic, physical or
logical location of an identity relating to an target.
**mediation device:** equipment, which realizes the mediation function.
**mediation function:** mechanism which passes information between a network
operator, an access provider or service provider and a handover interface, and
information between the internal network interface and the handover interface.
**network element:** component of the network structure, such as a local
exchange, higher order switch or service control processor.
**network element identifier:** uniquely identifies the relevant network
element carrying out the lawful interception.
**network identifier:** internationally unique identifier that includes a
unique identification of the network operator, access provider, or service
provider and, optionally, the network element identifier.
**network operator:** operator of a public telecommunications infrastructure
which permits the conveyance of signals between defined network termination
points by wire, by microwave, by optical means or by other electromagnetic
means.
**precision: the number of digits with which a numerical value is expressed,
e.g. the number of decimal digits or bits. Note: precision should not be
confused with accuracy, which is a difference between a measured/recorded
numerical value and the respective value in the standard reference system.**
**quality of service:** quality specification of a telecommunications channel,
system, virtual channel, computer-telecommunications session, etc. Quality of
service may be measured, for example, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, bit
error rate, message throughput rate or call blocking probability.
**reliability:** probability that a system or service will perform in a
satisfactory manner for a given period of time when used under specific
operating conditions.
**result of interception:** information relating to a target service,
including the content of communication and intercept related information,
which is passed by a network operator, an access provider or a service
provider to a law enforcement agency. Intercept related information shall be
provided whether or not call activity is taking place.
**service information:** information used by the telecommunications
infrastructure in the establishment and operation of a network related service
or services. The information may be established by a network operator, an
access provider, a service provider or a network user.
**service provider:** natural or legal person providing one or more public
telecommunications services whose provision consists wholly or partly in the
transmission and routing of signals on a telecommunications network. A service
provider needs not necessarily run his own network.
**SMS:** Short Message Service gives the ability to send character messages to
phones. SMS messages can be MO (mobile originate) or MT(mobile terminate).
**target identity:** technical identity (e.g. the interception\'s target
directory number), which uniquely identifies a target. One target may have one
or several target identities.
**target service:** telecommunications service associated with an target and
usually specified in a lawful authorization for interception.
NOTE 4: There may be more than one target service associated with a single
target.
**telecommunications:** any transfer of signs, signals, writing images,
sounds, data or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by
a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photo-optical system.

# 4 General
## 4.0 Introduction
The present document focuses on the handover interface related to the
provision of information related to LI between a network operator, access
provider and/or service provider and a Law Enforcement Agency (LEA).
## 4.1 Basic principles for the handover interface
The network requirements mentioned in the present document are derived, in
part, from the requirements defined in ETSI ES 201 158 [2].
Lawful interception may require functions to be provided in the switching or
routing nodes of a telecommunications network.
The specification of the handover interface is subdivided into three logical
ports each optimised to the different purposes and types of information being
exchanged.
The interface is extensible. (i.e. the interface may be modified in the future
as necessary).
## 4.2 Legal requirements
It shall be possible to select elements from the handover interface
specification to conform with:
\- national requirements;
\- national law;
\- any law applicable to a specific LEA.
As a consequence, the present document shall define, in addition to mandatory
requirements, which are always applicable, supplementary options, in order to
take into account the various influences listed above. See also ETSI TS 101
331 [1] and ETSI ETR 330 [3].
## 4.3 Functional requirements
A lawful authorization shall describe the kind of information IRI only, or IRI
with CC that is required by an LEA, the identifiers for the target, the start
and stop time of LI, and the addresses of the LEAs for delivery of CC and/or
IRI and further information.
A single target may be the target by different LEAs. It shall be possible
strictly to separate these interception measures.
If two targets are communicating with each other, each target is dealt with
separately.
## 4.4 Overview of handover interface
### 4.4.0 Introduction
The generic handover interface adopts a three port structure such that
administrative information (HI1), intercept related information (HI2), and the
content of communication (HI3) are logically separated.
Figure 4.1 shows a block diagram with the relevant entities for Lawful
Interception.
The outer circle represents the operator\'s (NO/AN/SP) domain with respect to
lawful interception. It contains the network internal functions, the internal
network interface (INI), the administration function and the mediation
functions for IRI and CC. The inner circle contains the internal functions of
the network (e.g. switching, routing, handling of the communication process).
Within the network internal function the results of interception (i.e. IRI and
CC) are generated in the Internal Interception Function (IIF).
The IIF provides the CC and the IRI, respectively, at the Internal Network
Interface (INI). For both kinds of information, mediation functions may be
used, which provide the final representation of the standardized handover
interfaces at the operator\'s (NO/AN/SP) domain boundary.
Figure 4.1: Functional block diagram showing handover interface HI
NOTE 1: Figure 4.1 shows only a reference configuration, with a logical
representation of the entities involved in lawful interception and does not
mandate separate physical entities.
NOTE 2: The mediation functions may be transparent.
NOTE 3: The LEMF is responsible for collecting and analyzing IRI and CC
information. The LEMF is the responsibility of the LEA.
NOTE 4: In case MIKEY ticket based solution is used for IMS media security as
specified in TS 33.328 [54], upon reception of the IRI related to an encrypted
session the IRI mediation function queries the network key management server
and retrieves the media decryption keys; the IRI mediation function then
delivers the keys to the LEMF.
### 4.4.1 Handover interface port 2 (HI2)
The handover interface port 2 shall transport the IRI from the operator\'s
(NO/AN/SP) IIF to the LEMF.
The delivery of the handover interface port 2 shall be performed via data
communication methods which are suitable for the network infrastructure and
for the kind and volume of data to be transmitted. From the operator
(NO/AN/SP) to LEMF delivery is subject to the facilities that may be procured
by the government.
The delivery can in principle be made via different types of lower
communication layers, which should be standard or widely used data
communication protocols.
The individual IRI parameters shall be coded using ASN.1 and the basic
encoding rules (BER). The format of the parameter\'s information content shall
be based on existing telecommunication standards, where possible.
The individual IRI parameters have to be sent to the LEMF at least once (if
available).
The IRI records are transmitted individually. As an option, IRI records can be
aggregated for delivery to the same LEA (i.e. in a single delivery
interaction). As there are time constraints associated with the delivery of
IRI, the use of this optional feature is subject to national or regional
requirements. As a general principle, IRI records shall be sent immediately
and shall not be withheld in the MF/DF in order to use the IRI record
aggregation option.
The IRI records shall contain information available from normal provider
(NO/AN/SP) operating procedures. In addition the IRI records shall include
information for identification and control purposes as specifically required
by the HI2 port.
The IIF is not required to make any attempt to request explicitly extra
information which has not already been supplied by a signalling system.
### 4.4.2 Handover interface port 3 (HI3)
The port HI3 shall transport the CC of the intercepted telecommunication
service to the LEMF. The CC shall be presented as a transparent en-clair copy
of the information flow during an established, frequently bi-directional,
communication of the target. However, in case MIKEY ticket based solution is
used for IMS media security as specified in TS 33.328 [54] and CC is presented
in encrypted format, the decryption keys and the associated information shall
be delivered to the LEMF via appropriate IRI over the HI2.
NOTE 1: Additional information needed for decryption, e.g. roll-over counter,
will be available as part of intercepted CC.
NOTE 2: In this version of the standard, in case of interception starting on
ongoing encrypted communication, some information needed for decryption might
not be available.
NOTE 3: In this version of the standard, immediate rekeying is not supported
from the LI perspective.
As the appropriate form of HI3 depends upon the service being intercepted, HI3
is described in relevant annexes.
The HI2 and HI3 are logically different interfaces, even though in some
installations the HI2 and HI3 packet streams might also be delivered via a
common transmission path from a MF to a LEMF. It is possible to correlate HI2
and HI3 packet streams by having common (referencing) data fields embedded in
the IRI and the CC packet streams.
## 4.5 HI2: Interface port for intercept related information
### 4.5.0 General
The HI2 interface port shall be used to transport all IRI, i.e. the
information or data associated with the communication services of the target
identity apparent to the network. It includes signalling information used to
establish the telecommunication service and to control its progress, time
stamps, and, if available, further information such as location information.
Only information which is part of standard network signalling procedures shall
be used within communication related IRI.
For all UE locations obtained, generated or reported to the LEMF, the MF/DF
shall report the time at which the location was established by the location
source (e.g. MME or HSS) and provide this to the MF/DF along with the location
information. If this information cannot be provided to the MF/DF, then the
MF/DF shall indicate that the time is not available. If the information in the
MME received over S1 (TS 36.413 [100]) includes one or more cell IDs, then all
cell IDs shall be reported to the LEMF whenever location reporting is
triggered at the MME.
Sending of the IRI to the LEMF shall in general take place as soon as
possible, after the relevant information is available.
In exceptional cases (e.g. data link failure), the IRI may be buffered for
later transmission for a specified period of time.
Within this clause only, definitions are made which apply in general for all
network technologies. Additional technology specific HI2 definitions are
specified in related Annexes.
### 4.5.1 Data transmission protocols
The protocol used by the \"LI application\" for the encoding and the sending
of data between the MF and the LEMF is based on already standardized data
transmission protocols.
The specified data communication methods provide a general means of data
communication between the LEA and the operator\'s (NO/AN/SP) mediation
function. They are used for the delivery of:
\- HI2 type of information (IRI records);
\- Certain types of content of communication (e.g. SMS).
The present document specifies the use of the several possible methods for
delivery: FTP or TPKT/TCP/IP (specifications for this specific protocol are in
Clause G.2 - \"HI2 delivery methods\". This protocol is defined by IETF RFC
2126: \"ISO Transport Service on top of TCP (ITOT)\" [28] on the application
layer and the BER on the presentation layer. The lower layers for data
communication may be chosen in agreement with the operator (NO/AN/SP) and the
LEA.
As an alternative, ETSI TS 102 232-1 [104] and ETSI TS 102 232-7 [105] may be
used for the encoding and the sending of data between the MF and the LEMF.
The delivery to the LEMF should use the internet protocol stack.
NOTE: TPKT/TCP/IP is recommended in the case of IRI only with the option of
IRI Packet Header Information reporting.
### 4.5.2 Application for IRI (HI2 information)
The handover interface port 2 shall transport the IRI from the operator\'s
(NO/AN/SP) MF to the LEMF.
The individual IRI parameters shall be coded using ASN.1 and the basic
encoding rules (BER). Where possible, the format of the information content
shall be taken over from existing telecommunication standards, which are used
for these parameters with the network already (e.g. IP). Within the ASN.1
coding for IRI, such standard parameters are typically defined as octet
strings.
### 4.5.3 Types of IRI records
Intercept related information shall be conveyed to the LEMF in messages, or
IRI data records, respectively. Four types of IRI records are defined:
1) IRI-Begin record at the first event of a communication attempt,\ opening
the IRI transaction.
2) IRI-End record at the end of a communication attempt,\ closing the IRI
transaction.
3) IRI-Continue record at any time during a communication attempt\ within the
IRI transaction.
4) IRI-REPORT record used in general for non-communication related events.
For information related to an existing communication case, the record types 1
to 3 shall be used. They form an IRI transaction for each communication case
or communication attempt, which corresponds directly to the communication
phase (set-up, active or release).
For packet oriented data services, the first event of a communication attempt
shall be the PDP context activation or a similar event and an IRI-BEGIN record
shall be issued. The end of the communication attempt shall be the PDP context
deactivation and an IRI-END record shall be issued. While a PDP context is
active, IRI-CONTINUE records shall be used for CC relevant IRI data records,
IRI-REPORT records otherwise.
Record type 4 is used for non-communication related subscriber action, like
subscriber controlled input (SCI) for service activation. For simple cases, it
can also be applicable for reporting unsuccessful communication attempts. It
can also be applicable to report some subscriber actions which may trigger
communication attempts or modifications of an existing communication, when the
communication attempt or the change of the existing communication itself is
reported separately.
Record type 4 is also used to convey the LALS reports.
For the IMS domain the IRI record types are used in a different way than
described in this clause. Details on the IRI type usage in the IMS domain are
defined in clause 7.5.
The record type is an explicit part of the record. The 4 record types are
defined independently of target communication events. The actual indication of
one or several communication events, which caused the generation of an IRI
record, is part of further parameters within the record\'s information
content. Consequently, the record types of the IRI transactions are not
related to specific messages of the signalling protocols of a communication
case, and are therefore independent of future enhancements of the intercepted
services, of network specific features, etc. Any transport level information
(i.e. higher-level services) on the target communication-state or other target
communication related information is contained within the information content
of the IRI records.
For packet oriented data services, if LI is being activated during an already
established PDP context or similar, an IRI-BEGIN record will mark the start of
the interception. If LI is being deactivated during an established PDP context
or similar, no IRI-END record will be transmitted. The end of interception can
be communicated to the LEA by other means (e.g. HI1).
NOTE: In some situation (e.g. during activation of second, third, etc,
intercepts on the target), the MF/DF may have to detect on its own that an
interception is activated on an already established PDP context or similar.
The DF2 shall not send the BEGIN with Start of Interception to the LEMFs that
were already intercepting the target communication due to a previous LI
activation on the same target.
## 4.6 Reliability
The reliability associated with the result of the interception of the content
of communication should be (at least) equal to the reliability of the original
content of communication. For intercepted packet data communications, this may
be derived from the QoS class used for the original intercepted session, TS
23.107 [20].
The reliability associated with the result of interception of signalling
should be (at least) equal to the the reliability of the original signalling.
Reliability from the operator (NO/AN/SP) to the LEMF is determined by what
operators (NO/AN/SP) and law enforcement agree upon.
# 5 Circuit-switch domain
## 5.0 General
For North America, the use of J‑STD‑025‑A [23] is recommended.
## 5.1 Specific identifiers for LI
### 5.1.0 Introduction
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception
uniquely and to correlate between the data, which is conveyed over the
different Handover Interfaces (HI1, HI2 and HI3). The identifiers, which apply
to all communication technologies, are defined in the clauses below.
### 5.1.1 Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID)
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized
operator (NO/AN/SP) shall assign a special Lawful Interception IDentifier
(LIID), which has been agreed between the LEA and the operator (NO/AN/SP). It
is used within parameters of all HI interface ports.
Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it
easier to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the
authorized operators (NO/AN/SP) and the handling agents at the LEA.
The Lawful Interception IDentifier LIID is a component of the CC delivery
procedure and of the IRI records. It shall be used within any information
exchanged at the Handover Interfaces HI2 and HI3 for identification and
correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters (or digit string for
sub-address option, see annex J). It might for example, among other
information, contain a lawful authorization reference number, and the date,
when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall enter for each target identity of the
target a unique LIID.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be
unique LIIDs assigned, relating to each LEA.
### 5.1.2 Communication IDentifier (CID)
#### 5.1.2.0 General
For each activity relating to a target identity, a CID is generated by the
relevant network element. The CID consists of the following two identifiers:
\- Network IDentifier (NID);
\- Communication Identity Number (CIN) - optional.
NOTE 1: For all non CC related records like SMS, SCI etc. no correlation to a
CC could be made.
The CID distinguishes between the different activities of the target identity.
It is also used for correlation between IRI records and CC connections, as
well as for correlation between LALS reports and IRI records of the triggering
events. It is used at the interface ports HI2 and HI3.
The Communication IDentifier is specified in the subsequent subclauses of
5.1.2. For ASN.1 coding details, see annex B.
#### 5.1.2.1 Network Identifier (NID)
The Network IDentifier is a mandatory parameter; it should be internationally
unique. It consists of one or both of the following two identifiers.
\- Operator - (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory):\ Unique identification of
network operator, access network provider or service provider.
\- Network element identifier NEID (optional):\ The purpose of the network
element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element
carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending,
etc.
A network element identifier may be:
\- an E.164 international node number
\- an X.25 address;
\- an IP address.
National regulations may mandate the sending of the NEID.
#### 5.1.2.2 Communication Identity Number (CIN) - optional
This parameter is mandatory for IRI in case of reporting events for
connection-oriented types of communication (e.g. circuit switched calls).
The communication identity number is a temporary identifier of an intercepted
communication, relating to a specific target identity.
The Communication Identity Number (CIN) identifies uniquely an intercepted
communications session within the relevant network element. All the results of
interception within a single communications session has to have the same CIN.
If a single target has two or more communications sessions through the same
operator, and through the same network element then the CIN for each session
shall be different.
NOTE: If two or more target identities, related either to an unique target or
to different targets, are involved in the same communication the same CIN
value may be assigned by the relevant network element to the communication
sessions of the different target identities.
### 5.1.3 CC link identifier (CCLID)
This identifier is only used at the interface ports HI2 and HI3 in case of the
reuse of CC links (option B, see clause 5.4.4.2).
For each CC link, which is set up by the mediation function towards the LEMF,
a CC link identifier (CCLID) is transmitted in the HI2 records and HI3 setup
message in addition to CIN and NID. For the correct correlation of multiparty
calls this identity number indicates in the IRI records of each multiparty
call, which CC link is used for the transmission of the CC.
The CCLID may use the same format as the CIN; in this case, it need not be
transmitted explicitly during set up of the CC links, as part of HI3. The CIN
may also implicitly represent the CCLID.
### 5.1.4 Correlation of CC and IRI
To assure correlation between the independently transmitted Content of
Communication (CC) and Intercept Related Information (IRI) of an intercepted
call the following parameters are used:
\- Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID), see clause 5.1.1;
\- Communication IDentifier (CID), see clause 5.1.2;
\- CC Link IDentifier (CCLID), see clause 5.1.3.
These parameters are transferred from the MF to the LEMF in:
\- HI2: see clause 5.2.2.1;
\- HI3: see clause 5.3.2.
Correlation of the present document ID\'s to TS 33.107 [19] ID\'s.
The ID Lawful Interception Identifier (LIID) out of the present document is
supported at the IIF with warrant reference number.
Parameters out of the present document, see clause 5.1.2:
_Communication Identifier (CID)_
For each call or other activity relating to a target identity a CID is
generated by the relevant network element. The CID consists of the following
two identifiers:
\- Network IDentifier (NID);
\- Communication Identity Number (CIN).
Intercepting Node ID is used for the NID in the UMTS system.
The correlation number is used for the CIN.
For the Communication IDentifier (CID) in the UMTS system we use the
combination of Interception Node ID and the correlation number.
### 5.1.5 Usage of Identifiers
The identifiers are exchanged between the mediation function and the LEMF via
the interfaces HI1, HI2 and HI3. There exist several interface options for the
exchange of information. Tables 5.1 and 5.2 define the usage of numbers and
identifiers depending on these options.
NOTE: X in tables 5.1 and 5.2: Identifier used within parameters of the
interface.

## 5.2 HI2: interface port for IRI
### 5.2.1 Definition of Intercept Related Information
Intercept Related Information will in principle be available in the following
phases of a call (successful or not):
1) At call initiation when the target identity becomes active, at which time
call destination information may or may not be available (set up phase of a
call, target may be the originating or terminating party, or be involved
indirectly by a supplementary service).
2) At the end of a call, when the target identity becomes inactive (release
phase of call).
3) At certain times between the above phases, when relevant information
becomes available (active phase of call).
In addition, information on non-call related actions of a target constitutes
IRI and is sent via HI2, e.g. information on subscriber controlled input.
The Intercept Related Information (IRI) may be subdivided into the following
categories:
1) Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information).
2) Basic call information, for standard calls between two parties.
3) Information related to supplementary services, which have been invoked
during a call.
4) Information on non-call related target actions.
### 5.2.2 Structure of IRI records
#### 5.2.2.0 General
Each IRI-record contains several parameters. In the subsequent subclauses of
5.2.2, the usage of these parameters is explained in more detail.
Mandatory parameters are indicated as HI2 control information. Optional
parameters are provided depending on the availability at the MF. For the
internal structure of the IRI records, the ASN.1 description, with the
application of the basic encoding rules (BER) is used. This ASN.1
specification is enclosed in annex B.
#### 5.2.2.1 Control Information for HI2
The main purpose of this information is the unique identification of records
related to a target identity, including their unique mapping to the links
carrying the Content of Communication. In general, parameters of this category
are mandatory, i.e. they have to be provided in any record.
The following items are identified (in brackets: ASN.1 name and reference to
the ASN.1 definition or clause B.3a):
1) Record type (_IRIContent_ , see clause B.3a)\ IRI-BEGIN, IRI-CONTINUE, IRI-
END, IRI-REPORT-record types.
2) Version indication (_iRIversion_ , see clause B.3a)\ Identification of the
particular version of the HI2 interface specification.
3) Communication Identifier (_CommunicationIdentifier,_ see clauses 5.1.2 and
B.3a).
4) Lawful Interception Identifier (_LawfulInterceptionIdentifier,_ see clauses
5.1.1 and B.3a).
5) Date & time (_TimeStamp_ , see clause B.3a)\ Date & time of record trigger
condition.\ The parameter shall have the capability to indicate whether the
time information is given as Local time without time zone, or as UTC.
Normally, the operator (NO/AN/SP) shall define these options.
6) CC Link Identifier (_CC-Link-Identifier_ , see clause 5.1.3 for definition
and clause B.3a for ASN.1 definition).
Table 5.3 summarizes the items of HI2 control information. It is mandatory
information, except the CID - it may be omitted for non-call related IRI
records - and the CCLID. Their format and coding definition is LI specific,
i.e. not based on other signalling standards.

#### 5.2.2.2 Basic call information
This clause defines parameters within IRI records for basic calls, i.e. calls,
for which during their progress no supplementary services have been invoked.
In general, the parameters are related to either the originating or
terminating party of a call; consequently, ASN.1 containers are defined for
the originating/terminating types of parties, which allow to include the
relevant, party-related information. The structure of these containers and the
representation of individual items are defined in clause B.3a.
NOTE: A third type of party information is defined for the forwarded-to-party
(see clause 5.2.2.3 on calls with supplementary services being invoked).
The items below are to be included, when they become available for the first
time during a call in progress. If the same item appears identically several
times during a call, it needs only to be transmitted once, e.g. in an IRI-
BEGIN record. The ASN.1 name of the respective parameters, as defined in
clause B.3a, is indicated in brackets.
1) Direction of call (_intercepted-Call-Direct_)\ Indication, whether the
target identity is originating or terminating Party.
2) Address of originating and terminating parties (_CallingPartyNumber_ or
_CalledPartyNumber_)\ If e.g. in case of call originated by the target at
transmission of the IRI-BEGIN record only a partial terminating address is
available, it shall be transmitted, the complete address shall follow, when
available.
3) Basic Service, LLC (_Services-Information_)\ Parameters as received from
signalling protocol (e.g. BC, HLC, TMR, LLC).
4) Cause (_ISUP-parameters_ or _DSS1-parameters-codeset-0_)\ Reason for
release of intercepted call. Cause value as received from signalling protocol.
It is transmitted with the ASN.1 container of the party, which initiated the
release; in case of a network-initiated release, it may be either one.
5) Additional network parameters\ e.g. location information (_Location_).
Parameters defined within table 5.5 shall be used for existing services, in
the given 3GPP format. National extensions may be possible using the ASN.1
parameter _National-Parameters_.
#### 5.2.2.3 Information on supplementary services, related to a call in
progress
The general principle is to transmit service related information within IRI
records, when the corresponding event/information, which needs to be conveyed
to the LEMF, is received from the signalling protocol. Where possible, the
coding of the related information shall use the same formats as defined by
standard signalling protocols.
The selection, which types of events or information elements are relevant for
transmission to the LEAs is conforming to the requirements defined in ETSI TS
101 331 [1] and ETSI ES 201 158 [2].
A dedicated ASN.1 parameter is defined for supplementary services related to
forwarding or re-routing calls (_forwarded-to-Party_ information), due to the
major relevance of these kinds of services with respect to LI. For the various
cases of forwarded calls, the information related to forwarding is included in
the _originatingParty_ /_terminatingParty_ /_forwarded-to-Party_ information:
1) If a call to the target has been previously forwarded, available parameters
relating to the redirecting party(ies) are encapsulated within the
_originatingPartyInformation_ parameter.
2) If the call is forwarded at the target\'s access (conditional or
unconditional forwarding towards the\ forwarded-to-party), the parameters
which are related to the redirecting party (target) are encapsulated within
the _terminatingPartyInformation_ parameter.
3) All parameters related to the forwarded-to-party or beyond the forwarded-
to-party are encapsulated within the _forwarded-to-Party_ ASN1 coded
parameter. In addition, this parameter includes the\ _supplementary-Services-
Information_ , containing the forwarded-to address, and the redirection
information parameter, with the reason of the call forwarding, the number of
redirection, etc.).
For the detailed specification of supplementary services related procedures
see clause 5.4.
Parameters defined within table 5.4 shall be used for existing services, in
the given format. National extensions may be possible using the ASN.1
parameter National-Parameters.
#### 5.2.2.4 Information on non-call related supplementary services
The general principle is to transmit non-call related service information as
received from the signalling protocol.
A typical user action to be reported is Subscriber Controlled Input (SCI).
For the detailed specification of the related procedures see clause 5.4.
### 5.2.3 Delivery of IRI
The events defined in TS 33.107 [19] are used to generate Records for the
delivery via HI2. The LALS reports defined in TS 33.107 [19] are delivered via
HI2, as well.
There are thirteen different events type received at DF2 level. According to
each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF if this is required. In the case of
LALS reports, which are not associated with an event, a Record is sent to the
LEMF without the event parameter.
The following table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level
and record type sent to the LEMF.
It is an implementation option if the redundant information will be sent for
each further event.
Table 5.4: Structure of the records for UMTS (CS)

Event IRI Record Type Call establishment BEGIN Answer CONTINUE Supplementary
service CONTINUE Handover CONTINUE Release END Location update REPORT
Subscriber controlled input REPORT SMS REPORT Serving system REPORT HLR

REPORT Location information request REPORT
* * *
The LALS report records are sent to the LEMF with the REPORT IRI Record Type.
NOTE 1: Void.
A set of information is used to generate the records. The records used
transmit the information from mediation function to LEMF. This set of
information can be extended in 3G MSC server or 3G GMSC server or DF2/MF, if
this is necessary in a specific country. The following table gives the mapping
between information received per event or report and information sent in
records.

NOTE 3: In some specific scenarios the amount of Enhanced Location for IRI
reports data may overload the X2 and/or HI2 interfaces. To prevent the
overload, a flow control for Enhanced Location for IRI Reports may be
implemented, e.g. by limiting the frequency of the reports for individual
target.
## 5.3 HI3: interface port for Content of Communication
### 5.3.0 General
The port HI3 shall transport the Content of the Communication (CC) of the
intercepted telecommunication service to the LEMF. The Content of
Communication shall be presented as a transparent en-clair copy of the
information flow during an established, frequently bi-directional,
communication of the target. It may contain voice or data.
A target call has two directions of transmission associated with it, to the
target, and from the target. Two communication channels to the LEMF are needed
for transmission of the Content of Communication (stereo transmission).
The network does not record or store the Content of Communication.
### 5.3.1 CS-based Delivery of Content of Communication
CC will be delivered as described in annex J.
Exceptionally, SMS will be delivered via HI2.
The transmission media used to support the HI3 port shall be standard ISDN
calls, based on 64 kbit/s circuit switched bearer connections. The CC links
are set up on demand to the LEMF. The LEMF constitutes an ISDN DSS1 user
function, with an ISDN DSS1 basic or primary rate access. It may be locally
connected to the target switching node, or it may be located somewhere in the
target network or in another network, with or without a transit network in
between.
For network signalling, the standard ISDN user part shall be used. No
modifications of the existing ISDN protocols shall be required. Any
information needed for LI, like to enable correlation with the IRI records of
a call, can be inserted in the existing messages and parameters, without the
need to extend the ETSI standard protocols for the LI application.
For each LI activation, a fixed LEMF address is assigned; this address is,
within the present document, not used for any identification purposes;
identification and correlation of the CC links is performed by separate, LI
specific information, see clause 5.1.
The functions defined in the ISDN user part standard, Version 1 (ETSI ISUP V1)
are required as a minimum within the target network and, if applicable, the
destination and transit networks, especially for the support of:
\- Correlation of HI3 information to the other HI port\'s information, using
the supplementary service user-to-user signalling 1 implicit (UUS1).
\- Access verification of the delivery call (see clause 5.3.3).
The bearer capability used for the CC links is 64 kbit/s unrestricted digital
information; this type guarantees that the information is passed transparently
to the LEMF. No specific HLC parameter value is required.
The CC communication channel is a one-way connection, from the operator\'s
(NO/AN/SP) IIF to the LEMF, the opposite direction is not switched through in
the switching node of the target.
The scenario for delivery of the Content of Communication is as follows:
1) At call attempt initiation, for one 64 kbit/s bi-directional target call,
two ISDN delivery calls are established from the MF to the LEMF. One call
offers the Content of Communication towards the target identity (CC Rx
call/channel), the other call offers the Content of Communication from the
target identity (CC Tx call/channel). See figure 5.1.
2) During the establishment of each of these calls, appropriate checks are
made (see clause 5.3.3).
3) The MF passes during call set up, within the signalling protocol elements
of the CC link the LIID and the CID to the LEMF. The LEMF uses this
information to identify the target identity and to correlate between the IRI
and CC.
4) At the end of a call attempt, each delivery call associated with that call
attempt shall be released by the MF.
Figure 5.1: Content of Communication transmission from MF to LEMF
### 5.3.2 Control information for Content of Communication
The delivery calls shall use unmodified standard ISDN protocols (DSS1, ISDN
user part). Table 5.6 summarizes specific settings of parameters for the CC
links. The User-to-User service 1 parameter is used during call set up (within
the ISUP Initial Address Message [29] or DSS1 Set Up Message [30],
respectively) to transmit LI-specific control information. This information is
carried transparently and delivered to the specific LEMF remote user.
To identify the delivered information, including correlating the delivery
calls with the IRI records, parameters 1 to 3 and 5 shall be included in the
call set up. Parameters 6 to 9 specify settings of further relevant
information. Other parameters of the ISDN protocols shall correspond to normal
basic calls.

10 ISDN user part optional forward call indicators parameter Connected line

* * *
Parameters 2, 3 and 4 are also present in the IRI records, for correlation
with the CC links. Parameter 5 indicates in case of separate transmission of
each communication direction, which part is carried by a CC link. Parameter 6,
the basic service of the target call, can be used by the LEMF for processing
of the CC signal, e.g. to apply compression methods for speech signals, in
order to save storage space. Parameter 7 contains the CUG of the LEA. It is
optionally used at set up the CC link to the LEA. Parameter 8, the basic
service of the CC link, is set to \"64 kbit/s unrestricted\": All information
of the Rx, Tx channels can be transmitted fully transparently to the LEA. The
setting of the ISDN user part indicator guarantees, that the services
supporting the LI CC link delivery are available for the complete CC link
connection.
The MF uses en-bloc dialling, i.e. there exists only one message in forward
direction to the LEA.
NOTE: The LEMF should at reception of the set up message not use the alerting
state, it should connect immediately, to minimize time delay until switching
through the CC links. Not all networks will support such a transition.
Exceptionally, it may be necessary to send an alerting message before the
connected message.
The maximum length of the user information parameter can be more than the
minimum length of 35 octets (national option, see ITU-T Recommendation Q.763
[29]), i.e. the network transmitting the CC links shall support the standard
maximum size of 131 octets for the UUS1 parameter.
The User-to-User service 1 parameter cannot be discarded by the ETSI ISUP
procedures: the only reason, which would allow the ISUP procedures to discard
it would be, if the maximum length of the message carrying UUS1 would be
exceeded. With the specified amount of services used for the CC links, this
cannot happen.
The signalling messages of the two CC channels (stereo mode) carry the same
parameter values, except for the direction indication.
See clause J.1 for the ASN.1 definition of the UUS1 LI specific content of the
UUS1 parameter.
### 5.3.3 Security requirements at the interface port of HI3
#### 5.3.3.0 General
The process of access verification and additional (optional) authentication
between the MF and the LEMF shall not delay the set up of the CC.
For the protection and access verification of the Content of Communication
delivery call the ISDN supplementary services CLIP, COLP and CUG shall be used
when available in the network involved**.**
Generally any authentication shall be processed before the set-up of the CC
links between the MF and the LEMF is completed. If this is technically not
feasible the authentication may be processed after completion of the CC
connection in parallel to the existing connection.
#### 5.3.3.1 LI access verification
The supplementary service CLIP shall be used to check for the correct origin
of the delivery call.
NOTE: When using CLIP, the supplementary service CLIR has to not be used.
The supplementary service COLP shall be used to ensure that only the intended
terminal on the LEA\'s side accepts incoming calls from the Handover Interface
(HI).
To ensure access verification the following two checks shall be performed:
\- check of Calling-Line Identification Presentation (CLIP) at the LEMF; and
\- check of COnnected-Line identification Presentation (COLP) at the Handover
Interface (HI) (due to the fact that the connected number will not always be
transported by the networks involved, there shall be the possibility for
deactivating the COLP check for a given interception measure. In addition, the
COLP check shall accept two different numbers as correct numbers, i.e. the
user provided number and the network provided number. Usually, the user
provided number contains a DDI extension).
#### 5.3.3.2 Access protection
In order to prevent faulty connections to the LEA, the CC links may be set up
as CUG calls.
In this case, the following settings of the CUG parameters should be used:
\- Incoming Access: not allowed;
\- Outgoing Access: not allowed;
\- Incoming calls barred within a CUG: no;
\- Outgoing calls barred within a CUG: yes.
#### 5.3.3.3 Authentication
In addition to the minimum access verification mechanisms described above,
optional authentication mechanisms according to the standard series ISO 9798
\"Information technology - Entity authentication - parts 1 to 5\" may be used.
These mechanisms shall only be used in addition to the access verification and
protection mechanisms.
## 5.4 LI procedures for supplementary services
### 5.4.1 General
In general, LI shall be possible for all connections and activities in which
the target is involved. The target shall not be able to distinguish
alterations in the offered service. It shall also not be possible to prevent
interception by invoking supplementary services. Consequently, from a
supplementary services viewpoint, the status of interactions with LI is \"no
impact\", i.e. the behaviour of supplementary services shall not be influenced
by interception.
Depending on the type of supplementary service, additional CC links to the LEA
may be required, in addition to already existing CC links.
Within the IRI records, the transmission of additional, supplementary service
specific data may be required.
Supplementary services, which have an impact on LI, with respect to CC links
or IRI record content, are shown in table 5.7. The table is based on UMTS
services, it considers the services which have been standardized at the time
of finalizing the present document. Future services should be treated
following the same principles.
NOTE 1: Co-ordination of handling of new services should be performed via 3GPP
SA WG3-LI. If required, additions will be included in a subsequent version of
the present document.
The question of Lawful Interception with Intelligent Networks is not covered
in this version (see note 2).
NOTE 2: The general principle is, that LI takes place on the basis of a
technical identity, i.e. a directory number. Only numbers which are known to
the operators (NO/AN/SP), and for which LI has been activated in the standard
way, can be intercepted. No standardized functions are available yet which
would enable an SCF to request from the SSF the invocation of LI for a call.
Additional CC links are only required, if the target is the served user. IRI
Records may also carry data from other parties being served users.
Clause 5.5 specifies details for relevant services:
\- The procedures for CC links, depending on the call scenario of the target.
\- Related to the IRI records, the point in time of sending and supplementary
service specific information.
\- Additional remarks for services with \"no impact\" on LI.
The specifications for supplementary services interactions are kept as far as
possible independent of the details of the used signalling protocols; service
related events are therefore described in more general terms, rather than
using protocol dependent messages or parameters.
Interactions with services of the same family, like call diversion services,
are commonly specified, if the individual services behaviour is identical,
with respect to LI.
With respect to the IRI records, clause 5.5 specifies typical cases; the
general rules for data which shall be included in IRI records are defined in
clause 5.2, specifically in clause 5.4.3.
Services, which are not part of table 5.7, do not require the generation of LI
information: No CC links are generated or modified, and no specific
information on the service is present in the IRI records. That is, these
services have \"no impact\" on LI, no special functions for LI are required.
However, within the IIF, functions may be required to realize the principle,
that the service behaviour shall not be influenced by LI.
\"No impact\" is not automatically applicable for new services. Each new
service has to be checked for its impact on LI.
The present document does not intend to give a complete description of all
possible cases and access types of interactions with supplementary services.

### 5.4.2 CC link Impact
The column \"CC links: additional calls, impact\" (see table 5.7) defines,
whether:
\- for the related service CC links shall be set up, in addition to the CC
links for a basic call;
\- already existing calls are impacted, for example by disconnecting their
information flow.
The CC link impact relates always to actions of a target being the served
user. Services invoked by other parties have no CC link impact.
### 5.4.3 IRI Impact, General Principle for Sending IRI records
The column \"IRI items related to service\" (see table 5.7) specifies, which
parameters may be transmitted to the LEA within the IRI records. For several
services, it is differentiated, whether the target or the other party is the
served user.
The table specifies, which parameters are applicable in principle. That is,
these parameters are normally sent to the LEA, immediately when they are
available from the protocol procedures of the service. In many cases,
additional IRI-CONTINUE records, compared to a basic call, will be generated.
However, not each service related signalling event needs to be sent
immediately within an individual record. Exceptions may exist, where several
events are included in one record, even if this would result in some delay of
reporting an event (this may be implementation dependent). Each record shall
contain all information, which is required by the LEA to enable the
interpretation of an action; example: the indication of call forwarding by the
target shall include the forwarded-to number and the indication of the type of
forwarding within the same record.
The complete set of parameters, which are applicable for IRI, is specified in
clause 5.2.3 (see table 5.5).
If during procedures involving supplementary services protocol parameters,
which are listed in table 5.5 become available, they shall be included in IRI
Records.
IRI data are not stored by the IIF or MF for the purpose of keeping
information on call context or call configuration, including complex
multiparty calls. The LEMF (electronically) or the LEA\'s agent (manually)
shall always be able, to find out the relevant history on the call
configuration, to the extent, which is given by the available signalling
protocol based information, within the telecommunication network.
Service invocations, which result in invoke and return result components (as
defined in table 5.5) need only be reported in case of successful invocations.
One IRI record, containing the invoke component, possibly including additional
parameters from the return result component, is sufficient.
With respect to the inclusion of LI specific parameters, see also the
parameter specifications and example scenarios in clause J.2.3 for more
details.
Details of e.g. the definition of the used record type, their content, the
exact points in time of sending etc. follow from the according service
specifications; in some cases, they are specified explicitly in clauses 5.5
and J.2.3.
### 5.4.4 Multi party calls - general principles, options A, B
#### 5.4.4.0 General
Each network has to adopt option A or B according to local circumstances.
With respect to IRI, each call or call leg owns a separate IRI transaction
sequence, independent of whether it is actually active or not.
With respect to the CC links, two options (A, B) exist, which depend on laws
and regulations, see below. Active call or call leg means in this context,
that the target is actually in communication with the other party of that call
or call leg; this definition differs from the definition in ETSI EN 300 356
[30].
#### 5.4.4.1 CC links for active and non-active calls (option A)
For each call, active or not, separate CC links shall be provided. This
guarantees that:
\- changes in the call configuration of the target are reflected immediately,
with no delay, at the LEMF;
\- the signal from held parties can still be intercepted.
It is a network option, whether the communication direction of a non-active
call, which still carries a signal from the other party, is switched through
to the LEMF, or switched off.
Figure 5.2: CC link option A (example for call hold supplementary service)
#### 5.4.4.2 Reuse of CC links for active calls (option B)
CC links are only used for calls active in their communication phase. Changes
in the call configuration may not be reflected at the LEMF immediately,
because switching in the IIF/MF is required, and the signal from the held
party is not available.
Each time, another target call leg uses an existing CC link, an IRI-CONTINUE
record with the correct CID and CCLID shall be sent.
NOTE: Even when option B is used, more than one CC link may be required
simultaneously.
Figure 5.3: CC link option B (example for call hold supplementary service)
### 5.4.5 Subscriber Controlled Input (SCI): Activation / Deactivation /
Interrogation of Services
For user procedures for control of Supplementary Services
(Activation/Deactivation/Interrogation), a special IRI record type (IRI-REPORT
record) is defined to transmit the required information.
The IRI-REPORT record shall contain an indicator, whether the request of the
target has been processed successfully or not.
## 5.5 Detailed procedures for supplementary services
### 5.5.1 Advice of Charge services (AOC)
No impact.
Advice of Charge information is not included in IRI records.
### 5.5.2 Call Waiting (CW)
#### 5.5.2.1 Call Waiting at target: CC links
In case of option A \"CC links for all calls\", a CC link is set up for the
waiting call, using the standard procedures for terminating calls. In case of
option B \"CC links for active calls\", no CC link is set up for the waiting
call, it is treated like a held call.
With respect to CC links, the same configurations as for Call Hold apply.
Procedure, when the target accepts the waiting call: see retrieve of a held
call (see clause 5.5.3).
#### 5.5.2.2 Call Waiting: IRI records
##### 5.5.2.2.1 Target is served user
If Call Waiting is invoked at the target access by another (calling) party:
the IRI-BEGIN record or a following IRI‑CONTINUE record for the waiting call
shall contain the LI specific parameter _call waiting indication_.
##### 5.5.2.2.2 Other party is served user
If Call Waiting is invoked at the other (called) party\'s access: if a _CW
notification_ is received by the target\'s switching node, it shall be
included in an IRI-CONTINUE record; it may be a separate record, or the next
record of the basic call sequence.
### 5.5.3 Call Hold/Retrieve
#### 5.5.3.1 CC links for active and non-active calls (option A)
If an active call is put on hold, its CC links shall stay intact; as an
option, the signal from the held party is not switched through to the LEMF.
If the target sets up a new call, while one call is on hold, this call is
treated like a normal originating call, i.e. a new LI configuration (CC links,
IRI records) is established.
#### 5.5.3.2 Reuse of CC links for active calls (option B)
If an active call is put on hold, its CC links shall not immediately be
disconnected; as an option, the signal from the held party is not switched
through to the LEMF.
If the target sets up a new call, or retrieves a previously held call, while
one target call, which still owns CC links, is on hold, these CC links shall
be used for the signals of the new active call.
#### 5.5.3.3 IRI records
##### 5.5.3.3.1 Invocation of Call Hold or Retrieve by target
An IRI-CONTINUE record with the LI specific parameter hold indication or
retrieve indication, respectively, shall be sent.
##### 5.5.3.3.2 Invocation of Call Hold or Retrieve by other parties
An IRI-CONTINUE record with a call hold or retrieve notification shall be sent
if it has been received by the signalling protocol entity of the target call.
### 5.5.4 Explicit Call Transfer (ECT)
#### 5.5.4.1 Explicit Call Transfer, CC link
During the preparation phase of a transfer, the procedures for Call
Hold/Retrieve are applicable.
If the served (transferring) user is the target, its original call is
released. This terminates also the CC link, and causes an IRI-END record to be
sent.
After transfer, two options exist:
1) For the transferred call, CC links (and IRI records) shall be generated, in
principle like for a forwarded call (similar to procedures in clause
5.5.12.1.1, case b));
2) The transferred call shall not be intercepted.
#### 5.5.4.2 Explicit Call Transfer, IRI records
In addition to the basic or hold/retrieve/waiting call related records and
parameters, during the reconfiguration of the call, ECT-specific information
at the target\'s access is sent to the LEMF within IRI-CONTINUE records.
When the target leaves the call after transfer, an IRI-END record is sent, and
the LI transaction is terminated. Options for the new call, after transfer:
see clause 5.5.4.1.
### 5.5.5 Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP) (IRI Records)
#### 5.5.5.1 Call originated by target (target is served user)
The standard CLI parameter of an originating target is included as a
supplementary service parameter in the IRI records.
#### 5.5.5.2 Call terminated at target (other party is served user)
The CLI sent from the other party is included in the IRI-BEGIN record
(_originating-Party_ information), irrespective of a restriction indication.
An eventually received second number (case two number delivery option) is
included in the IRI record as supplementary services information (Generic
Number parameter).
### 5.5.6 Calling Line Identification Restriction (CLIR)
For use by LI, the restriction is ignored, but copied within the CLI parameter
to the IRI record.
### 5.5.7 COnnected Line identification Presentation (COLP)
#### 5.5.7.1 Call terminated at target (target is served user)
A connected number parameter received from the target shall be included in an
IRI record (terminating-Party information).
#### 5.5.7.2 Call originated by target (other party is served user)
If available, a connected number parameter as received from the other
(terminating) party shall be included in an IRI record (terminating-Party
information). Any additional number, e.g. a Generic Number, shall also be
included in the IRI record.
### 5.5.8 COnnected Line identification Restriction (COLR)
For use by LI, the restriction is ignored, but copied within the COL parameter
to the IRI record.
### 5.5.9 Closed User Group (CUG)
In case of a CUG call, the closed user group interlock code shall be included
in an IRI.
### 5.5.10 Completion of Call to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
No impact.
The first call, which meets a (terminating) busy subscriber, and is released
subsequently, is treated like a standard busy call, with no CCBS related IRI
information.
The procedures for CCBS, until starting a new call attempt from the served
user to the terminating user, including the CCBS recall, are not subject of
LI.
### 5.5.11 Multi ParTY call (MPTY)
#### 5.5.11.1 General
a) Target is conference controller:\ The MPTY conference originates from a
configuration with two single calls (one active, one held). When joining the
calls to a conference, the CC links, which have carried the signals of the
active target call are used to transmit the conference signals; that is, the
Rx call contains the sum signal of the conference, the Tx call contains the
signal from the target.
The second CC link set, for the previously held call stays intact. If the
conference is released, and the initial state (1 held, 1 active call) is re-
established, the required CC links are still available.
b) Target is passive party of conference:\ No impact on CC links.
#### 5.5.11.2 IRI records
For the events indicating the start and the end of the MPTY conference, IRI
records are generated.
### 5.5.12 DIVersion Services (DIV)
#### 5.5.12.0 General
Calls to a target, with a called party number equal to the intercepted target
DN(s), but forwarded, are intercepted, i.e. CC links are set up, and IRI
records are sent to the LEA. This applies for all kinds of call forwarding.
For calls forwarded by the other party (calling or called), the available
diversion-related information is sent to the LEA.
#### 5.5.12.1 Call Diversion by Target
##### 5.5.12.1.1 Call Diversion by Target, CC links
In order to handle call diversion services by applying, as far as possible,
common procedures, the following two cases are differentiated:
a) Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU), Call Forwarding Busy (NDUB):\ In these
cases, forwarding is determined, before seizing the target access. CC links
are set up, immediately, for the forwarded call.
Other variants of Call Forwarding with immediate forwarding, i.e. without
first seizing the target access, are handled in the same way (e.g.
unconditional Selective Call Forwarding).
b) Call Forwarding No Reply, Call Forwarding Busy (UDUB), Call Deflection:\
Initially, the target call is set up, and the call is intercepted like a basic
call.
When forwarding takes place (e.g. after expiry of the CFNR timer), the
original call is released; this may cause also a release of the CC links. In
such case two optional IRI record handling may apply:
1) For the original call an IRI-END record is sent. For the forwarded call a
new set up procedure, including new LI transaction may take place with new set
of IRI records (starting with IRI-BEGIN record sent to the LEA).
2) For the forwarded call the IRI-CONTINUE record is generated and sent to a
LEA, indicating the CFNR invocation.
Other variants of Call Forwarding with forwarding after first seizing the
target access, are handled in the same way.
In case of multiple forwarding, one call may be intercepted several times, if
several parties are targets. Considering the maximum number of diversions for
one call of 5 (3GPP recommended limit), one call can be intercepted 7 times,
from the same or different LEAs. In principle, these procedures are
independent of each other.
##### 5.5.12.1.2 Call Diversion by Target, IRI records
See clause 5.2.2.3, case 2, related to the target\'s information, and case 3,
related to the forwarded-to-party information.
As above for the CC links, the diversion types a) and b1, 2) are
differentiated: For case a) and b2) diversions, the IRI is part of one
transaction, IRI-BEGIN, -CONTINUE, -END, for case b1) diversions, a first
transaction informs about the call section, until diversion is invoked
(corresponding to a basic, prematurely released call), a second transaction
informs about the call section, when diversion is invoked (corresponding to
case a).
#### 5.5.12.2 Forwarded Call Terminated at Target
The CC link is handled in the standard way. The IRI-BEGIN record contains the
available call diversion information, see clause 5.2.2.3 case 1.
#### 5.5.12.3 Call from Target Forwarded
The CC link is handled in the standard way. The IRI-BEGIN and possibly IRI-
CONTINUE records contain the available call diversion related information, see
clause 5.2.2.3 case 3.
### 5.5.13 Variants of call diversion services
Variants of the above \"standard\" diversion services are treated in the same
way as the corresponding \"standard\" diversion service.
### 5.5.14 SUBaddressing (SUB)
The different types of subaddress information elements are part of the IRI
records, in all basic and supplementary services cases, where they are
present.
### 5.5.15 User-to-User Signalling (UUS)
User-to-User parameters of services UUS1, UUS2 and UUS3 shall be reported as
HI2, see clause 5.4.
If User-User information is not delivered from a target to the other party
(e.g. due to overload in the SS No.7 network), no notification is sent to the
LEA.
### 5.5.16 Incoming Call Barring (ICB)
No impact.
a) **Case terminating call to a target with ICB active:\** In general, the
barring condition of a target is detected before the target access is
determined, consequently, an IRI-REPORT records is generated.\ If the access
would be determined, a standard IRI-END record is generated, with the
applicable cause value.
b) **Case target calls a party with ICB active:\** In general, an IRI-BEGIN
record has been sent already, and CC links have been set up. Consequently, a
standard IRI-END record is generated, with the applicable cause value.
### 5.5.17 Outgoing Call Barring (OCB)
No impact.
For a barred call, a standard record may be generated; its type and content
are depending on the point in the call, where the call was released due to OCB
restrictions.
### 5.5.18 Tones, Announcements
No impact.
If the normal procedures, depending on the call state, result in sending the
tone or announcement signal on the Rx CC link channel, this shall be
transmitted as CC.
## 5.6 Functional architecture
The following picture contains the reference configuration for the lawful
interception (see TS 33.107 [19]).
There is one Administration Function (ADMF) in the network. Together with the
delivery functions it is used to hide from the 3G MSC server and 3G GMSC
server that there might be multiple activations by different Law Enforcement
Agencies (LEAs) on the same target.
Figure 5.4: Reference configuration for Circuit switched
The reference configuration is only a logical representation of the entities
involved in lawful interception and does not mandate separate physical
entities. This allows for higher levels of integration.
A call could be intercepted based on several identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI,
Non-Local ID) of the same target.
Interception based on IMEI could lead to a delay in start of interception at
the beginning of a call and interception of non-call related events is not
possible.
For the delivery of the CC and IRI the 3G MSC server or the 3G GMSC server
provides correlation number and target identity to the DF2 and DF3 which is
used there in order to select the different LEAs where the product shall be
delivered to.
## 5.7 IP-based handover interface for CC
### 5.7.1 General
When IP-based delivery interface is used for HI3, the CC of intercepted
Circuit Switched (CS) voice calls shall be delivered to the LEMF using the
ASN.1 module defined in Annex B.17.
As illustrated in figure 5.5, the communication between target and the other
party will still be over circuit-switched network connections.
Figure 5.5: IP based handover interface for the CC of a CS intercepts
The method used to deliver the CS-voice contents from ICE to DF3 (i.e. the
details of X3 reference point, see TS 33.107 [19]) can be implementation
specific and therefore, related details are outside the scope of the present
document. Some examples are illustrated in TS 33.107 [19].
### 5.7.2 Identifiers
The identifiers are used to establish a correlation between the CC and the IRI
messages. The following identifiers are used to correlate the CC with the
associated IRI messages:
Lawful Interception Identifier (see sub-clause 5.1.1)
Communication Identifier (see sub-clause 5.1.2)
CC-Link-Identifier (see sub-clause 5.1.3).
The Communication Identifier includes two identifiers:
Network Identifier (see sub-clause 5.1.2.1)
Communication Identity Number (see sub-clause 5.1.2.2).
When a target is involved in multi-party calls, each call-leg will have a
separate Communication Identity Number. The Lawful Interception Identifier,
Network Identifier can be the same for multiple legs of the call. The CC-Link-
Identifier is used when single circuit-link is used to deliver the CC of all
call-legs of multi-party calls. The details of this are described in sub-
clause 5.1.5.
With IP-based handover interface option for CC, the use of CC-Link-Identifier
may not be applicable for HI3. However, to avoid any backward compatibility
issues, the inclusion of CC-Link-Identifier in the HI3 even for IP-based
handover interface is encouraged if the same is sent over the HI2.
### 5.7.3 Voice Content Direction
Voice content direction shall be included within the CC delivered to the LEMF
and it allows the LEMF to distinguish between multiple voice media streams
received. Within the ASN.1 module, this is identified as TPDU-direction and
can have the following values:
\- From the target: indicates that the voice content is sent from the target.
\- To the target: indicates that the voice content is sent to the target.
\- Combined: indicates that the voice content sent to, and received from, the
target is delivered to the LEMF in a combined form.
\- Unknown: indicates that the direction cannot be determined.
Basically, this information helps the LEMF to identify whether the voice
content is delivered in a stereo form or mono-form. In the former case, it
further helps the LEMF to distinguish the voice content sent to the target
from the voice content received from the target.
### 5.7.4 Payload Description
The intercepted voice-content delivered over HI3 is identified within the
ASN.1 module as payload. The information necessary for the LEMF to decode the
payload shall be included within the CC. Within the ASN.1, this is identified
as payload description that contains the media format (RFC 3551 [93]) and
media attributes (RFC 4566 [94]) using the SDP (RFC 4566 [94]).
NOTE: When IP-based handover interface is used to deliver the CC, the payload
can be in the RTP (RFC 3550 [95]) form. The codec information associated with
that RTP can be delivered over HI2 or HI3. However, former approach will
require changes to the IRI messages and hence, causing a backward
compatibility issue.
In support of backward compatibility, the delivery of payload description
(i.e. media format and media attributes when the payload is in RTP form) over
HI2 shall be discouraged. In other words, the pay-load description shall be
delivered over HI3.
Table 5.8 below describes the usage of Media Format and Media Attributes.
Table 5.8: usage of media format and media attributes
* * *
**Field name** **Status** **ASN.1 field** **Information**
* * *
Media Format Mandatory mediaFormat This field signals the codec used, as
defined in RFC 3551 [93].
Media Attributes Conditional\ mediaAttributes If any extra information (beyond
the Media Format) is needed to understand the delivered CC then it shall be
sent here, in the format defined in the a= field of SDP (see RFC 4566 [94]).
Typically, media attributes shall be present if and only if the media format
is 32 or above. (i.e. mandatory under the conditions listed)
* * *
### 5.7.5 Sequence Number
Sequence Number is an integer incremented each time a T-PDU is delivered.
Handling of sequence number is done according to national requirements.
# 6 Packet data domain
## 6.1 Identifiers
### 6.1.0 Introduction
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception
uniquely and to correlate between the data, which is conveyed over the
different handover interfaces (HI2 and HI3). The identifiers are defined in
the subsequent subclauses of 6.1.
For the delivery of CC and IRI the SGSN or GGSN provide correlation numbers
and target identities to the HI2 and HI3. The correlation number is unique per
PDP context and is used to correlate CC with IRI and the different IRI\'s of
one PDP context. When the SGSN connects an UE to a S-GW through the S4
interface (TS 23.060 [42], see also NOTE) for a specific communication, the
SGSN is not required to provide CC, IRIs for the PDP context associated with
CC and correlation for that communication.
NOTE: The S4 is an intra-PLMN reference point between the SGSN and the S-GW.
### 6.1.1 Lawful interception identifier
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized
operator (NO/AN/SP) shall assign a special Lawful Interception Identifier
(LIID), which has been agreed between the LEA and the operator (NO/AN/SP).
Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it
easier to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the
authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) and the handling agents at the LEA.
The LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records.
It shall be used within any information exchanged at the handover interfaces
HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for
example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference
number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall either enter a unique LIID for each
target identity of the target or a single LIID for multiple target identities
all pertaining to the same target.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be
unique LIIDs assigned relating to each LEA.
### 6.1.2 Network identifier
The network identifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be
internationally unique. It consists of the following two identifiers.
1) Operator- (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory):\ Unique identification of
network operator, access network provider or service provider.
2) Network element identifier NEID (optional):\ The purpose of the network
element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element
carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending,
etc.
A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier. For GSM
and UMTS systems deployed in the U.S., the network element identifier is
required.
A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier.
National regulations may mandate the sending of the NEID.
### 6.1.3 Correlation number
The Correlation Number is unique per PDP context and used for the following
purposes:
\- correlate CC with IRI;
\- correlate different IRI records within one PDP context;
\- correlate LALS reports with the IRI records of the triggering events.
As an example, in the UMTS system, the Correlation Number may be the
combination of GGSN address and charging ID.
NOTE: The Correlation Number is at a minimum unique for each concurrent
communication (e.g. PDP context) of a target within a lawful authorization.
## 6.2 Timing and quality
### 6.2.1 Timing
As a general principle, within a telecommunication system, IRI, if buffered,
should be buffered for as short a time as possible.
NOTE: If the transmission of IRI fails, it may be buffered or lost.
Subject to national requirements, the following timing requirements shall be
supported:
\- Each IRI data record shall be sent by the delivery function to the LEMF
over the HI2 within seconds of the detection of the triggering event by the
IAP at least 95% of the time;
\- Each IRI data record shall contain a time-stamp, based on the intercepting
nodes clock that is generated following the detection of the IRI triggering
event. The timestamp precision should be at least 1 second (ETSI TS 101 671
[24]). Defining the required precision of an IRI timestamp however is subject
to national requirements.
### 6.2.2 Quality
The quality of service associated with the result of interception should be
(at least) equal to the quality of service of the original content of
communication. This may be derived from the QoS class used for the original
intercepted session, TS 23.107 [20]. However, when TCP is used as an OSI layer
4 protocol across the HI3, real time delivery of the result of the
interception cannot be guaranteed. The QoS used from the operator (NO/AN/SP)
to the LEMF is determined by what operators (NO?AN?SP) and law enforcement
agree upon.
### 6.2.3 Void
(Void)
## 6.3 Security aspects
Security is defined by national requirements.
## 6.4 Quantitative aspects
The number of target interceptions supported is a national requirement.
The area of Quantitative Aspects addresses the ability to perform multiple,
simultaneous interceptions within a provider\'s network and at each of the
relevant intercept access points within the network. Specifics related to this
topic include:
\- The ability to access and monitor all simultaneous communications
originated, received, or redirected by the target;
\- The ability for multiple LEAs (up to five) to monitor, simultaneously, the
same target while maintaining unobtrusiveness, including between agencies;
\- The ability of the network to simultaneously support a number of separate
(i.e. multiple targets) legally authorized interceptions within its service
area(s), including different levels of authorization for each interception,
including between agencies (i.e. IRI only, or IRI and communication content).
## 6.5 IRI for packet domain
### 6.5.0 Introduction
The IRI will in principle be available in the following phases of a data
transmission:
1\. At connection attempt when the target identity becomes active, at which
time packet transmission may or may not occur (set up of a data context,
target may be the originating or terminating party);
2\. At the end of a connection, when the target identity becomes inactive
(removal of a data context);
3\. At certain times when relevant information are available.
In addition, information on non-transmission related actions of a target
constitute IRI and is sent via HI2, e.g. information on subscriber controlled
input.
The IRI may be subdivided into the following categories:
1\. Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information);
**2.** Basic data context information, for standard data transmission between
two parties.
The events defined in TS 33.107 [19] are used to generate records for the
delivery via HI2.
Unless otherwise noted, the following terminology applies to both GPRS and 3G
GSN nodes:
GPRS attach - also applies to Mobile Station attach
GPRS detach - also applies to Mobile Station detach
gPRSEvent - also applies to PDP Context events and Mobile Station events
gPRSCorrelationNumber - also applies to PDP Context Correlation
gPRSOperationErrorCode - also applies to PDP Context Operation Error Codes
There are several different event types received at DF2 level. According to
each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF if this is required. In the case of
LALS reports, which are not associated with an event, a Record is sent to the
LEMF without the event parameter.
The following table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level
and record type sent to the LEMF.

The UMTS PS LALS reports are sent to the LEMF in the REPORT IRI records.
A set of information is used to generate the records. The records used
transmit the information from mediation function to LEMF. This set of
information can be extended in the GSN or DF2 MF, if this is necessary in a
specific country. The following table gives the mapping between information
received per event and information sent in records.

NOTE: LIID parameter has to be present in each record sent to the LEMF.
### 6.5.1 Events and information
#### 6.5.1.0 General
This clause describes the information sent from the Delivery Function (DF) to
the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) to support Lawfully Authorized
Electronic Surveillance (LAES). The information is described as records and
information carried by a record. This focus is on describing the information
being transferred to the LEMF.
The IRI events and data are encoded into records as defined in the Table 6.1
Mapping between GPRS Events and HI2 records type and Annexes B.3 and B.9
Intercept related information (HI2) (see Note). IRI is described in terms of a
\'causing event\' and information associated with that event. Within each IRI
Record there is a set of events and associated information elements to support
the particular service.
NOTE: IRI events and data intercepted by the GPRS and 3G PS nodes may be
delivered to the LEMF by using either the HI2 specified in Annex B.3 or the
HI2 specified in Annex B.9. The latter option may be preferred when the GPRS
and 3G PS nodes are interworking with SAE/EPS nodes, in order to deliver all
the IRI events and data intercepted in the Packet based network by using the
same HI2.
The communication events described in Table 6.1: Mapping between GPRS Events
and HI2 record type and Table 6.2: Mapping between Events information and IRI
information convey the basic information for reporting the disposition of a
communication. This clause describes those events and supporting information.
Each record described in this clause consists of a set of parameters. Each
parameter is either:
mandatory (M) - required for the record,
conditional (C) - required in situations where a condition is met (the
condition is given in the Description), or
optional (O) - provided at the discretion of the implementation.
The information to be carried by each parameter is identified. Both optional
and conditional parameters are considered to be OPTIONAL syntactically in
ASN.1 Stage 3 descriptions. The Stage 2 inclusion takes precedence over Stage
3 syntax.
#### 6.5.1.1 REPORT record information
The REPORT record is used to report non-communication related subscriber
actions (events) and for reporting unsuccessful packet-mode communication
attempts.
The REPORT record is also used for the PS LALS reports.
The REPORT record shall be triggered when:
\- the target\'s mobile station performs a GPRS attach procedure (successful
or unsuccessful);
\- the target\'s mobile station performs a GPRS detach procedure;
\- the target\'s mobile station is unsuccessful at performing a PDP context
activation procedure;
\- the target\'s mobile station performs a cell, routing area, or combined
cell and routing area update;
\- the interception is activated after target\'s mobile station has
successfully performed GPRS attach procedure;
\- optionally when the target\'s mobile station leaves the old SGSN;
\- optionally when the target\'s mobile station enters or leaves IA;
\- the target\'s mobile station sends an SMS-Mobile Originated (MO)
communication. Dependent on national requirements, the triggering for the
REPORT record event shall occur either when the 3G SGSN receives the SMS from
the target MS or, when the 3G SGSN receives notification that the SMS-Centre
successfully received the SMS;
a mobile station sends an SMS-Mobile Originated (MO) communication to a Non-
Local ID target. Dependent on national requirements, the triggering event for
the REPORT record shall occur either when the 3G SGSN receives the SMS from a
MS for a Non-Local ID target or, when the 3G SGSN receives notification that
the SMS-Centre successfully received the SMS for the Non-Local ID target;
\- the target\'s mobile station receives a SMS Mobile-Terminated (MT)
communication. Dependent on national requirements, the triggering event for
the REPORT record shall occur either when the 3G SGSN receives the SMS from
the SMS-Centre or, when the 3G SGSN receives notification that the target MS
successfully received the SMS;
a mobile station receives a SMS Mobile-Terminated (MT) communication from a
Non-Local ID target. Dependent on national requirements, the triggering event
for the REPORT record shall occur either when the 3G SGSN receives the SMS
from the SMS-Centre originating from a Non-Local ID target or, when the 3G
SGSN receives notification that the MS successfully received the SMS
originating from a Non-Local ID target;
\- as a national option, a mobile terminal is authorized for service with
another network operator or service provider; in that case, other related
events are required as cancel location, register location, location
information request from a third party\'s node;
\- as a national option, a REPORT record have to be generated when there is a
HLR subscriber record change of IMSI or of MSISDN triggered by a messages to
or from the HLR;
\- packet data header reporting is performed on an individual intercepted
packet basis and a packet is detected as it is sent or received by the target
for a packet-data communication PDP Context.;
\- when packet data summary reporting is performed on a summary basis for a
packet-data communication PDP Context.associated with a particular packet flow
(defined as the combination of source IP address, destination IP address,
source port, destination port, and protocol and for IPv6 also include the flow
label) and:
\- the packet flow starts,
\- an interim packet summary report is to be provided, or
\- packet flow ends including the case where PDP Context is deactivated.
> An interim packet data summary report is triggered if:
\- the expiration of a configurable Summary Timer per intercept occurs. The
Summary Timer is configurable in units of seconds. Or
\- a per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached.
\- when a LALS report information is received from the LI LCS Client.
Packet Data Header Information is reported either on a per-packet (i.e. non-
summarised) basis or in a summary report. These reports provide IRI associated
with the packets detected. The packet data header information related REPORT
record is used to convey packet data header information during an active
packet-data communication PDP Context.
NOTE: In the case of IP Fragments, Packet Data Header Information on a 6-tuple
basis may only be available on the first packet and subsequent packets may not
include such information and therefore may not be reported.

## 6.6 IRI reporting for packet domain at GGSN
Interception in the GGSN is a national option. However, if 3G direct tunnel
functionality with the GGSN (as defined in TS 23.060 [42]) is used in the
network, then the GGSN shall perform the interception of IRI.
As a national option, in the case where the GGSN is reporting IRI for a
target, the target is handed off to another SGSN and the same GGSN continues
to handle the content of communications subject to roaming agreements, the
GGSN shall continue to report the following IRI of the content of
communication:
\- PDP context activation;
\- PDP context deactivation;
\- Start of interception with PDP context active;
\- PDP context modification;
\- Packet Data Header Information.
NOTE: In some situation (e.g, during activation of second, third, etc,
intercepts on the target), the MF/DF may have to detect on its own that an
interception is activated on a target with PDP context active.
## 6.7 Content of communication interception for packet domain at GGSN
Interception in the GGSN is a national option. However, if 3G direct tunnel
functionality with the GGSN (as defined in TS 23.060 [42]) is used in the
network, then the GGSN shall perform the interception of content of
communication.
As a national option, in the case where the GGSN is performing interception of
the content of communications, the target is handed off to another SGSN and
the same GGSN continues to handle the content of communications subject to
roaming agreements, the GGSN shall continue to perform the interception of the
content of communication.
# 7 Multi-media domain
## 7.0 Introduction
Clause 7 deals with IRI reporting in the IMS. IRI reporting in the multi-media
domain specified in this clause does not depend on the IP-Connectivity Access
Network (IP-CAN), defined in TS 23.228 [40], used to transport the CC. When
the IP-CAN is the UMTS PS domain, annexes C and G apply for CC interception at
the SGSN/GGSN. However, such CC interception may intercept more than just the
CC associated with an IMS based voice service. Hence, for separated VoIP CC
intercept and reporting, refer to clause 12.
In addition, this clause also specifies IRI reporting from the HSS handling
subscriber data for IMS network. Target identities to be used for interception
of IRIs at the HSS are specified in TS 33.107 [19].
According to TS 33.107 [19], interception in the CSCFs shall be supported in
the S‑CSCF and optionally in the P‑CSCF where the S-CSCF and the P-CSCF are in
the same network. For roaming scenarios where the P-CSCF is in the Visited
Network, interception at the P-CSCF is mandatory. The target identities for
the intercept of traffic at the CSCFs are only the SIP-URI, TEL‑URI and IMEI
(described in TS 23.003 [25], obtained from the Instance IDs, described also
in TS 23.003 [25] as requested in clause7A.8 of TS 33.107 [19]. In the
intercepting nodes (CSCF\'s) the relevant SIP-Messages are duplicated and
forwarded to the MF HI2.
The enhanced P-CSCF (eP-CSCF) shall adhere to all the LI requirements
pertaining to a P-CSCF. Any additional LI requirements pertaining to the
support of Web Real Time Communications (WebRTC) Interworking as specified in
TS 23.228 [40] that only apply to the eP-CSCF are described distinctly.
In case of target manipulation of IMS supplementary service setting, the
interception shall be made by XCAP servers maintaining XCAP resources related
to the supplementary service settings defined in TS 22.173 [78] made on the
interface Ut as described in TS 24.623 [77]. Any other points related to
attempts to access to Target\'s XCAP servers or, XCAP change/transaction in
services setting related to the target, are for further studies.
Ut based XCAP manipulation messages for the IMS services for the target is
reported. Any copy \"en clair\" of the XCAP exchanges (aggregated or not),
between the UE and the AS, will be transmitted to the LEMF in the HI2
interface through the DF 2, that will encapsulate the XCAP Ut transactions in
ASN.1. Such XCAP transactions on the Ut interface have to include any exchange
of data, which are contained in the XCAP payload (e.g. the get, put, and
delete operations on the XCAP resources).
NOTE: Interception of the target\'s supplementary service setting management
or modifications that are made outside the Ut interface is for further
studies.
For clarification, see Figure 7.1. If the P‑CSCF and S‑CSCF are in the same
network and LI is provided at both P-CSCF and S-CSCF, the events are sent
twice to the LEMF.
Figure 7.1: IRI Interception at a CSCF
## 7.1 Identifiers
### 7.1.0 General
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception
uniquely and to correlate between the data, which is conveyed over the
different handover interfaces (HI2 and HI3). The identifiers are defined in
the subsequent subclauses of clause 7.1.
For the delivery of CC and IRI the SGSN, GGSN and CSCF\'s provide correlation
numbers and target identities to the HI2 and HI3. The correlation number
provided in the PS domain (SGSN, GGSN) is unique per PDP context and is used
to correlate CC with IRI and the different IRI\'s of one PDP context. However,
where separated delivery of IMS based VoIP is required, to ensure that the CC
related to an IMS based VoIP call is intercepted and reported separately from
other PS domain services while being correlated to the IMS based VoIP IRI,
refer to clause 12.
Interception is performed on an IMS identifier(s) associated with the target
including identifiers such as IMEI, SIP‑URI and Tel‑URI, ETSI EN 300 356 [30].
In addition, in case of interception at the HSS, IMSI shall be supported as
target identity if it is available in the subscription data stored in the HSS
and the association with IMS identities can be done.
IMEI and MSISDN shall be supported as target identities if the HSS is shared
with access services (e.g. PS, EPS) and the association with IMS identities
can be done.
Non-Local ID interception is based on SIP-URI or Tel URI. Non-Local Id may be
present in any of the SIP headers used to identify either the calling party
information and redirecting party information present in the incoming SIP
message for incoming calls from target Non-Local ID, or the called party
information present in the outgoing SIP message for outgoing calls to target
Non-Local ID.
For Non-Local ID target interception, the CSP is not responsible for the
deduplication of events.
### 7.1.1 Lawful Interception Identifier (LIID)
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized
operator (NO/AN/SP) shall assign a special Lawful Interception Identifier
(LIID), which has been agreed between the LEA and the operator (NO/AN/SP).
Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it
easier to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the
authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) and the handling agents at the LEA.
The LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records.
It shall be used within any information exchanged at the handover interfaces
HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for
example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference
number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall either enter, based on an agreement
with each LEA: a unique LIID for each target identity of the target; or a
single LIID for multiple target identities all pertaining to the same target.
Note that, in order to simplify the use of the LIID at the LEMF for the
purpose of correlating IMS signalling with GSN CC, the use of a single LIID in
association with potentially numerous IMS identities (IMEI, SIP and TEL URIs)
is recommended.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be
unique LIIDs assigned relating to each LEA.
In case the LIID of a given target has different values in the GSN and in the
CSCF, it is up to the LEMF to recover the association between the two LIIDs.
### 7.1.2 Network identifier
The network identifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be
internationally unique. It consists of the following two identifiers.
1) Operator- (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory):\ Unique identification of
network operator, access network provider or service provider.
2) Network element identifier NEID (optional):\ The purpose of the network
element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element
carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending,
etc.
A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier.
National regulations may mandate the sending of the NEID.
### 7.1.3 Correlation number
Two parameters are defined to enable further correlation than can be
accomplished via a LIID alone. The first is called a Correlation number while
the second is simply called Correlation. The Correlation Number was initially
defined to carry a GPRS/EPS Correlation Number and is limited to those access
types that support a PDP Context/EPS Bearer. Subsequently, the Correlation
parameter was defined to enable a more general correlation. The value used in
the Correlation number parameter or the Correlation parameter may be generated
by the CSCF.
When clause 12 is used to provide separated IMS VoIP intercept and delivery,
imsVoIP (as defined in clause 12) may be used to provide the correlation
between the IRI and CC of an IMS VoIP session and also between IRI messages of
the same IMS VoIP session.
See clause 6.1.3 for a definition of the GPRS Correlation Number. See clause
10.5.0 for EPS Correlation Number.
NOTE 1: Void.
It is an implementation matter how the CSCF generates a correlation number
parameter value. The CSCF should use the
gPRSCorrelationNumber/ePSCorrelationNumber ASN.1 parameter as a container.
For a GPRS/UMTS access or LTE access, if two PDP contexts or two EPS Bearers
are used for the communication (one for signalling and one for bearer) two
correlation numbers may be delivered via the CSCFs. Different identifiers may
be used for correlating a target\'s various SIP messages such as:
\- LIID;
\- implementation dependent number.
NOTE 2: The implementation dependent number may be e.g. a \'Call-id\'.
However, when a CSCF acts as a back-to-back user agent a CSCF can have
different \'Call-id\' values for different legs of signalling. Therefore some
other number would be needed in such a case.
NOTE 3: The LIID may be used to associate SIP messages with respective GSN IRI
records. In case the target is only permitted to have a single SIP session
with a single CC bearer active at any time, the LIID is sufficient to
correlate IMS IRI records with GSN IRI records. In all other case s, e.g. the
target is permitted to have multiple SIP sessions active concurrently, a
combination of the LIID and an implementation dependent number may be used to
correlate the IMS IRI records with the GSN IRI records.
In case the LIID of a given target has different values in the GSN and in the
CSCF, it is up to the LEMF to recover the association between the two LIIDs.
SIP correlation number is used to correlate events of one specific SIP
session.
Correlation number is not applicable to interception at the HSS.
## 7.2 Timing and quality
### 7.2.1 Timing
As a general principle, within a telecommunication system, IRI, if buffered,
should be buffered for as short a time as possible.
NOTE: If the transmission of IRI fails, it may be buffered or lost.
Subject to national requirements, the following timing requirements shall be
supported:
\- Each IRI data record shall be sent by the delivery function to the LEMF
over the HI2 within seconds of the detection of the triggering event by the
IAP at least 95% of the time.
\- Each IRI data record shall contain a time-stamp, based on the intercepting
nodes clock that is generated following the detection of the IRI triggering
event. Subject to national requirements, IMS specific IRI timestamp should
have higher precision than 1 second.
### 7.2.2 Quality
QoS is not applicable to SIP signalling and hence not to IMS specific IRI
records.
NOTE: The QoS class in PS domain is defined only for user plane data (CC);
refer to subclause 6.2.2.
### 7.2.3 Void
(Void)
## 7.3 Security aspects
When KMS based IMS media security TS 33.328 [54] is adopted in the network,
the HI2 shall have strong integrity and confidentiality protection. In this
case, the HI2 should be protected by TLS. FTP delivery should be done over TLS
as specified by IETF RFC 4217 [58]. TLS and certificate profiling shall be
according to TS 33.310 [60].
Additional security is defined by national requirements.
## 7.4 Quantitative aspects
The number of target interceptions supported is a national requirement.
The area of Quantitative Aspects addresses the ability to perform multiple,
simultaneous interceptions within a provider\'s network and at each of the
relevant intercept access points within the network. Specifics related to this
topic include:
\- The ability to access and monitor all simultaneous communications
originated, received, or redirected by the target;
\- The ability for multiple LEAs (up to five) to monitor, simultaneously, the
same target while maintaining unobtrusiveness, including between agencies;
\- The ability of the network to simultaneously support a number of separate
(i.e. multiple targets) legally authorized interceptions within its service
area(s), including different levels of authorization for each interception,
including between agencies (i.e. IRI only, or IRI and communication content
when SIP message also contains content).
## 7.5 IRI for IMS
### 7.5.0 Introduction
In addition, information on non-transmission related actions of a target
constitute IRI and is sent via HI2, e.g. information on SIP message with call
forwarding configuration information.
The IRI may be subdivided into the following categories:
1\. Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information).
2\. Basic data context information, for standard data transmission between two
parties (e.g. SIP- or XCAP-message).
3\. Information needed to decrypt media traffic between the parties.
For each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF, if this is required. The
following table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level and
record type sent to the LEMF.
Table 7.1: Mapping between IMS Events and HI2 Records Type
* * *
Event IRI Record Type SIP-message REPORT XCAP-request REPORT XCAP response
REPORT Media decryption keys available REPORT Start of interception for
already established IMS session REPORT Serving System REPORT Subscriber record
change REPORT Registration Termination REPORT Location Information Request
REPORT
* * *
A set of information is used to generate the record. The records used transmit
the information from mediation function to LEMF. This set of information can
be extended in the CSCF or DF2 MF, if new IEs are available and if this is
necessary in a specific country. The following table gives the mapping between
information received per event and information sent in records.
Once IRI only interception is underway, LEMF receives IMS specific IRI only
(SIP IRI) from CSCF or IRI only (XCAP Message IRI) from the XCAP server
managing the XCAP resource associated with the IMS supplementary service
setting, or IRI only from the HSS. LEMF does not receive CC, and therefore it
is not possible to correlate IMS specific IRI with CC.
Once IRI and CC interception is underway, LEMF receives IMS specific IRI both
from a GSN and from a CSCF. LEMF receives SIP messages also from a GSN within
CC. LEMF receives IRI of XCAP events from functions such as XCAP
authentication and resource management function. In certain cases, however,
SIP messages may be encrypted between UE and CSCF. XCAP message between the UE
and the AS managing the target\'s IMS supplementary service settings may be
encrypted. In these cases LEMF needs to receive unencrypted SIP or XCAP
messages in IMS specific IRI provided from CSCF, or from the XCAP server
managing the target\'s IMS supplementary service settings. The LI service
delivery of XCAP events related to XCAP authentication process is for further
study.
In some cases the CC is encrypted according to one of the IMS media security
solutions specified in TS 33.328 [54]. In these cases the LEMF receives
encrypted CC and decrypts it based on the decryption information received over
the HI2 interface.
NOTE 0: CC interception is not applicable at the HSS.
When the InstanceID is present in IMS signalling TS 24.229 [76], and contains
an IMEI URN [81], [82], the IMEI shall be extracted and converted to the
reporting format defined for partyInformation (imei).
NOTE 1: Delivery of decrypted CC in the above scenario is FFS.
NOTE 1a: GSN has no possibility to decrypt SIP messages based on the IMS
security architecture.
NOTE 2: Security mechanisms for protecting delivery of key material over the
HI2 in line with TS 33.328 [54] are FFS.
NOTE 2a: When the CSCF is not aware of the activation of multiple lawfully
authorized intercepts on a single target, the MF/DF needs to generate the
REPORT with _Start of Interception on an already established IMS session_ on
its own using information that it has retained.
The DF2 shall not send the REPORT with Start of Interception with an already
established IMS session to the LEMFs that were already intercepting the

SDP content within SIP messages is reported even for warrants requiring only
IRI.
NOTE 9: In case of IMS event reporting involving the correlation number
parameter, the gPRSCorrelationNumber HI2 ASN.1 parameter, which is also used
in the IRIs coming from UMTS PS nodes, is used as container.
NOTE 10: This parameter is applicable only in case of start of interception
for an already established IMS session.
NOTE 11: For separated IMS VoIP, the imsVoIP (as defined in clause 12) may be
used instead of Correlation Number or Correlation shown in table 7.2.
NOTE 12: Applicable to HSS only.
pANI-header-info parameter includes elements present in the P-Access-Network-
Info (PANI) header in intercepted SIP messages originated by the target\'s UE
and handled by the CSCFs. The mediation function shall parse these intercepted
SIP messages and copy from the PANI header the type/class of access and, if
required by the warrant, location information in the related parameters
specified in Annexes B.3 and B.9. In such case, the SIP messages carrying the
PANI header shall also be sent to the LEMF unmodified.
In case the warrant does not require providing target\'s location information,
any location information shall be filtered from the intercepted raw SIP
messages, prior that these are delivered to the LEMF. In such case, as an
implementation option, location information may be masked (e.g. filled with
blanks or other characters) instead of filtered.
### 7.5.1 Events and information
This clause describes the information sent from the Delivery Function (DF) to
the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) to support Lawfully Authorized
Electronic Surveillance (LAES). The information is described as records and
information carried by a record. This focus is on describing the information
being transferred to the LEMF.
The IRI events and data are encoded into records as defined in the Table 7.1:
Mapping between IMS Events and HI2 Records Type and Annexes B.3 and B.9
Intercept related information (HI2). IRI is described in terms of a \'causing
event\' and information associated with that event. Within each IRI Record
there is a set of events and associated information elements to support the
particular service.
The communication events described in Table 7-1: Mapping between the IMS Event
and HI2 Record Type and Table 7.2: Mapping between IMS Events Information and
IRI Information convey the basic information for reporting the disposition of
a communication. This clause describes those events and supporting
information.
Each record described in this clause consists of a set of parameters. Each
parameter is either:
\- mandatory (M): required for the record,
\- conditional (C): required in situations where a condition is met (the
condition is given in the Description), or
\- optional (O): provided at the discretion of the implementation.
The information to be carried by each parameter is identified. Both optional
and conditional parameters are considered to be OPTIONAL syntactically in
ASN.1 Stage 3 descriptions. The Stage 2 inclusion takes precedence over Stage
3 syntax.

## 7.6 Correlation indications of IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF
See Annex F.
## 7.7 Void
# 8 3GPP WLAN Interworking
## 8.0 General
NOTE: WLAN Interworking specification (TS 29.234 [41]) is no longer maintained
Release 12 and onwards. Therefore, the entire clause 8 is not maintained
Release 12 and onwards.
## 8.1 Identifiers
## 8.1.1 Overview
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception
uniquely and to correlate between the data, which is conveyed over the
different handover interfaces (HI2 and HI3). The identifiers are defined in
the subsections below.
For the delivery of CC and IRI the PDG or AAA server provide correlation
numbers and target identities to the HI2 and HI3. The correlation number is
unique per I-WLAN tunnel and is used to correlate CC with IRI and the
different IRI\'s of one I-WLAN tunnel.
### 8.1.2 Lawful interception identifier
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized
operator (NO/AN/SP) shall assign a special Lawful Interception Identifier
(LIID), which has been agreed between the LEA and the operator (NO/AN/SP).
Using an indirect identification to point to a target identity makes it easier
to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the authorized
operator (NO/AN/SP) and the handling agents at the LEA.
The LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records.
It shall be used within any information exchanged at the handover interfaces
HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for
example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference
number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall either enter a unique LIID for each
target identity of the target or a single LIID for multiple target identities
all pertaining to the same target.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be
unique LIIDs assigned relating to each LEA.
### 8.1.3 Network identifier
The network identifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be
internationally unique. It consists of the following two identifiers.
1) Operator- (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory):\ Unique identification of
network operator, access network provider or service provider.
2) Network element identifier NEID (optional):\ The purpose of the network
element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element
carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending,
etc.
A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier.
National regulations may mandate the sending of the NEID.
### 8.1.4 Correlation number
The Correlation Number is unique per I-WLAN tunnel and used for the following
purposes:
\- correlate CC with IRI (in the PDG),
\- correlate different IRI records within one I-WLAN tunnel (for both PDG and
AAA server).
NOTE: The Correlation Number is at a minimum unique for each concurrent
communication (e.g. I-WLAN tunnel) in a specific node (e.g. AAA server or PDG)
of an target within a lawful authorization.
## 8.2 Timing and quality
### 8.2.1 Timing
As a general principle, within a telecommunication system, IRI, if buffered,
should be buffered for as short a time as possible.
NOTE: If the transmission of IRI fails, it may be buffered or lost.
Subject to national requirements, the following timing requirements shall be
supported:
\- Each IRI data record shall be sent by the delivery function to the LEMF
over the HI2 within seconds of the detection of the triggering event by the
IAP at least 95% of the time.
\- Each IRI data record shall contain a time-stamp, based on the intercepting
node\'s clock that is generated following the detection of the IRI triggering
event.
### 8.2.2 Quality
The quality of service associated with the result of interception should be
(at least) equal to the quality of service of the original content of
communication. This may be derived from the QoS class used for the original
intercepted session, TS 23.107 [20]. However, when TCP is used as an OSI layer
4 protocol across the HI3, real time delivery of the result of the
interception cannot be guaranteed. The QoS used from the operator (NO/AN/SP)
to the LEMF is determined by what operators (NO/AN/SP) and law enforcement
agree upon.
### 8.2.3 Void
(Void).
## 8.3 Security aspects
Security is defined by national requirements.
## 8.4 Quantitative aspects
The number of target interceptions supported is a national requirement.
The area of Quantitative Aspects addresses the ability to perform multiple,
simultaneous interceptions within a provider\'s network and at each of the
relevant intercept access points within the network. Specifics related to this
topic include:
\- The ability to access and monitor all simultaneous communications
originated, received, or redirected by the target;
\- The ability for multiple LEAs (up to five) to monitor, simultaneously, the
same target while maintaining unobtrusiveness, including between agencies;
\- The ability of the network to simultaneously support a number of separate
(i.e. multiple targets) legally authorized interceptions within its service
area(s), including different levels of authorization for each interception,
including between agencies (i.e. IRI only, or IRI and communication content).
## 8.5 IRI for I-WLAN
### 8.5.0 Introduction
The IRI will in principle be available in the following phases of a data
transmission:
1\. At I-WLAN access initiation attempt, when the target identity becomes
active, at which time packet transmission may or may not occur (at the set up
of a I-WLAN tunnel, the target may be the originating or terminating party);
2\. At the end of a connection, when the target identity becomes inactive
(removal of a I-WLAN tunnel);
3\. At certain times when relevant information are available.
In addition, information on non-transmission related actions of a target
constitute IRI and is sent via HI2, e.g. information on subscriber controlled
input.
The IRI may be subdivided into the following categories:
1\. Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information);
**2.** Basic data communication information, for standard data transmission
between two parties.
The events defined in TS 33.107 [19] are used to generate records for the
delivery via HI2.
There are multiple different event types received at DF2 level. According to
each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF if this is required. The following
table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level and record
type sent to the LEMF.

Header Information REPORT
* * *
A set of information is used to generate the records. The records used
transmit the information from mediation function to LEMF. This set of
information can be extended in the ICE or DF2 MF, if this is necessary in a
specific country. The following table gives the mapping between information
received per event and information sent in records.
For the event \"Start of intercept with I-WLAN Communication Active\" reported
from a AAA server, this event is reported using a:
\- REPORT record to provide an indication that I-WLAN Access Initiation event
has already occurred, but there are no tunnels established yet.
\- BEGIN record to provide an indication that one or more I-WLAN Tunnels are
already established.

### 8.5.1 Events and information
#### 8.5.1.1 Overview
This clause describes the information sent from the Delivery Function (DF) to
the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) to support Lawful Interception
(LI). The information is described as records and information carried by a
record. This focus is on describing the information being transferred to the
LEMF.
The IRI events and data are encoded into records as defined in the Table 8.1
Mapping between I-WLAN Events and HI2 records type and Annex B.7 Intercept
related information (HI2). IRI is described in terms of a \'causing event\'
and information associated with that event. Within each IRI record there is a
set of events and associated information elements to support the particular
service.
The communication events described in Table 8.1: Mapping between I-WLAN Events
and HI2 record type and Table 8.2: Mapping between Events information and IRI
information convey the basic information for reporting the disposition of a
communication. This clause describes those events and supporting information.
Each record described in this clause consists of a set of parameters. Each
parameter is either:
mandatory (M) - required for the record,
conditional (C) - required in situations where a condition is met (the
condition is given in the Description), or
optional (O) - provided at the discretion of the implementation.
The information to be carried by each parameter is identified. Both optional
and conditional parameters are considered to be OPTIONAL syntactically in
ASN.1 Stage 3 descriptions. The Stage 2 inclusion takes precedence over Stage
3 syntax.
#### 8.5.1.2 REPORT record information
The REPORT record is used to report non-communication related target actions
(events) and for reporting unsuccessful packet-mode communication attempts.
The REPORT record shall be triggered when:
\- the target\'s WLAN UE performs a (successful or unsuccessful) I-WLAN access
initiation procedure (triggered by AAA server);
\- the target\'s WLAN UE performs a (successful or unsuccessful) re-
authentication (triggered by AAA server);
\- the target\'s WLAN UE performs a I-WLAN access termination detach procedure
(triggered by AAA server);
\- the target\'s WLAN UE is unsuccessful at performing a I-WLAN tunnel
establishment procedure (triggered by AAA server or PDG);
\- the interception of a target\'s communications is started and the WLAN UE
has already successfully performed a I-WLAN access initiation procedure
(triggered by AAA server), but there are no tunnels established;
\- packet data header reporting is performed on an individual intercepted
packet basis and a packet is detected as it is sent or received by the target
for I-WLAN communications;
\- when packet data summary reporting is performed on an summary basis for
I-WLAN communications associated with a particular packet flow (defined as the
combination of source IP address, destination IP address, source port,
destination port, and protocol and for IPv6 also include the flow label) and:
\- the packet flow starts,
\- an interim packet summary report is to be provided, or
\- packet flow ends including the case where the I-WLAN interworking tunnel is
deactivated.
> An interim packet summary report is triggered if:
\- the expiration of a configurable Summary Timer per intercept occurs. The
Summary Timer is configurable in units of seconds. Or
\- a per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached.
Packet Data Header Information is reported either on a per-packet (i.e., non-
summarised) basis or in a summary report. These reports provide IRI associated
with the packets detected. The packet data header information related REPORT
record is used to convey packet data header information during active I-WLAN
communications.
NOTE: in the case of IP Fragments, Packet Data Header Information on a 6-tuple
basis may only be available on the first packet and subsequent packets may not
include such information and therefore may not be reported.

The interface protocols and data structures defined in Annex B.4, Annex C, and
Annex G of this specification are applicable to the delivery of the
intercepted CC for I-WLAN over the HI3 PS interface. The mandatory or
optionality of the parameters is not changed for I-WLAN. However the
availability of relevant intercepted information will affect the population of
the parameters.
# 9 Interception of Multimedia Broadcast/MultiCast Service (MBMS)
## 9.1 Identifiers
### 9.1.1 Overview
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception
uniquely and to correlate between the data, which is conveyed over the
different handover interface (HI2). The identifiers are defined in the
subsections below.
The MBMS LI solution in this section provides an IRI solution for MBMS only.
CC interception is provided by transport bearer level interception
functionality e.g. GSNs. The Correlation Number is unique per target MBMS
service and MBMS session and is used to correlate different IRI records within
one MBMS service and MBMS session.
### 9.1.2 Lawful interception identifier
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized
operator (NO/AN/SP) shall assign a special Lawful Interception Identifier
(LIID), which has been agreed between the LEA and the operator (NO/AN/SP).
Using an indirect identification to point to a target identity makes it easier
to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the authorized
operator (NO/AN/SP) and the handling agents at the LEA.
The LIID is a component of the IRI records. It shall be used within any
information exchanged at the handover interfaces HI2 for identification and
correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for
example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference
number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall either enter a unique LIID for each
target identity of the target or a single LIID for multiple target identities
all pertaining to the same target.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be
unique LIIDs assigned relating to each LEA.
### 9.1.3 Network identifier
The network identifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be
internationally unique. It consists of the following two identifiers.
1) Operator- (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory):\ Unique identification of
network operator, access network provider or service provider.
2) Network element identifier NEID (optional):\ The purpose of the network
element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element
carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending,
etc.
A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier.
National regulations may mandate the sending of the NEID.
### 9.1.4 Correlation number
The Correlation Number is unique per target MBMS service and MBMS session. The
correlation number is used for the following purposes:
\- Correlate different IRI records within one MBMS service and MBMS session.
NOTE: Correlation only applies to MBMS service usage. Correlation of
subscription management events is not required and the ASN.1 subscription
event records in Annex B.8 do not provide support for correlation numbers.
Such Subscription management report record events are asynchronous, can occur
at any time and are likely to occur infrequently.
## 9.2 Timing and quality
### 9.2.1 Timing
As a general principle, within a telecommunication system, IRI, if buffered,
should be buffered for as short a time as possible.
NOTE: If the transmission of IRI fails, it may be buffered or lost.
Subject to national requirements, the following timing requirements shall be
supported:
\- Each IRI data record shall be sent by the delivery function to the LEMF
over the HI2 within seconds of the detection of the triggering event by the
IAP at least 95% of the time.
\- Each IRI data record shall contain a time-stamp, based on the intercepting
node\'s clock that is generated following the detection of the IRI triggering
event.
### 9.2.2 Quality
The quality of service associated with the result of interception should be
(at least) equal to the quality of service of the original MBMS service.
### 9.2.3 Void
(Void).
## 9.3 Security aspects
Security is defined by national requirements.
## 9.4 Quantitative aspects
The number of target interceptions supported is a national requirement.
The area of Quantitative Aspects addresses the ability to perform multiple,
simultaneous interceptions within a provider\'s network and at each of the
relevant intercept access points within the network. Specifics related to this
topic include:
\- The ability to access and monitor all simultaneous communications
originated, received, or redirected by the target;
\- The ability for multiple LEAs (up to five) to monitor, simultaneously, the
same target while maintaining unobtrusiveness, including between agencies;
\- The ability of the network to simultaneously support a number of separate
(i.e. multiple targets) legally authorized interceptions within its service
area(s), including different levels of authorization for each interception,
including between agencies (i.e. IRI only, or IRI and communication content).
## 9.5 IRI for MBMS
### 9.5.0 General
The IRI will in principle be available in the following phases of a data
transmission:
1\. At MBMS Service Joining or Leaving.
2\. At MBMS Subscription Activation, Modification and Termination.
3\. At certain times when relevant information are available.
The IRI may be subdivided into the following categories:
1\. Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information);
**2.** Basic data communication information, for standard data transmission
between two parties.
The events defined in TS 33.107 [19] are used to generate records for the
delivery via HI2.
There are multiple different event types received at DF2 level. According to
each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF if this is required. The following
table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level and record
type sent to the LEMF.
Table 9.1: Mapping between MBMS Events and HI2 records type
* * *
Event IRI Record Type MBMS Service Joining BEGIN MBMS Service Leaving END MBMS
Subscription Activation REPORT MBMS Subscription Modification REPORT MBMS
Subscription Termination REPORT Start of intercept with MBMS Service Active
BEGIN
* * *
A set of information is used to generate the records. The records used
transmit the information from mediation function to LEMF. This set of
information can be extended in the ICE or DF2 MF, if this is necessary in a
specific country. The following table gives the mapping between information
received per event and information sent in records.
NOTE: Support for MBMS over IMS is For Further Study. As a minimum, IMPU and
IMPI reporting support will be required.

NOTE: LIID parameter has to be present in each record sent to the LEMF.
### 9.5.1 Events and information
#### 9.5.1.1 Overview
This clause describes the information sent from the Delivery Function (DF) to
the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) to support Lawful Interception
(LI). The information is described as records and information carried by a
record. This focus is on describing the information being transferred to the
LEMF.
The IRI events and data are encoded into records as defined in the Table 9.1
Mapping between MBMS Events and HI2 records type and Annex B.8 Intercept
related information (HI2). IRI is described in terms of a \'causing event\'
and information associated with that event. Within each IRI record there is a
set of events and associated information elements to support the particular
service.
The communication events described in Table 9.1: Mapping between MBMS Events
and HI2 record type and Table 9.2: Mapping between Events information and IRI
information convey the basic information for reporting the disposition of a
communication. This clause describes those events and supporting information.
Each record described in this clause consists of a set of parameters. Each
parameter is either:
mandatory (M) - required for the record,
conditional (C) - required in situations where a condition is met (the
condition is given in the Description), or
optional (O) - provided at the discretion of the implementation.
The information to be carried by each parameter is identified. Both optional
and conditional parameters are considered to be OPTIONAL syntactically in
ASN.1 Stage 3 descriptions. The Stage 2 inclusion takes precedence over Stage
3 syntax.
#### 9.5.1.2 REPORT record information
The REPORT record is used to report non-communication related target actions
(events) and for reporting unsuccessful packet-mode communication attempts.
The REPORT record shall be triggered when:
\- the target\'s MBMS UE or target via an off-line means (e.g. via internet or
customer service centre) performs MBMS Subscription Activation. See Table 9.3
\- the target\'s MBMS UE or target via an off-line means (e.g. via internet or
customer service centre) performs MBMS Subscription Modification. See Table

## 9.6 CC for MBMS
The MBMS LI solution specified in this version of this specification does not
specifically provide a CC interception solution. Only IRI generated by the BM-
SC is specifically supported.
CC interception of MBMS services is provided by the underlying transport
bearer LI functionality eg GSNs for GPRS. Only MBMS Multicast service CC
interception is supported. However, in many MBMS scenarios, the MBMS content
stream is routed to the UE using multicast streams, rather than BM-SC to UE
point to point bearers. In the case of multicast stream routing to the serving
basestations/NodeB, the GSNs may not be able to intercept the MBMS stream as
no IP address or other target related identities may be associated with the
stream at the GSN. In this case, since no target identity is available for
interception in the CC stream, the LEA will not receive MBMS CC.
No MBMS CC capability is provided by this specification for MBMS broadcast
services, as the UE will receive such services in IDLE mode without an active
network connection.
NOTE: Provision of MBMS CC decryption keys is for further study.
# 10 Evolved Packet System (EPS)
## 10.0 Introduction
Clause 10 specifies requirements for the handover interface in the Evolved
Packet System (TS 23.060 [42], TS 23.401 [44], TS 23.402 [45]).
In case the SGSN is used in the EPS and interworks with a S-GW by using S4/S12
interfaces, the SGSN and the HSS are subjected to the requirements applicable
to these nodes for PS interception, as specified throughout this document.
In case of untrusted non-3GPP IP access, the e-PDG not using a GTP based
protocol over the s2b interface and AAA server are subjected to all the
requirements specified in this document for PDG and AAA server for the case of
WLAN interworking.
NOTE: WLAN Interworking specification (TS 29.234 [41]) is not maintained in
Release 12 and onwards.
When a PDN-GW provides a Gn/Gp interface for interworking with a SGSN, from LI
perspective the PDN-GW acts as a GGSN towards the involved SGSN. In this case,
in addition to the requirements specified in this chapter, all the
requirements specified in this document for PS interception applicable the
GGSN are applicable also to the PDN-GW. PDP contexts/EPS bearer modification
signalling detected by the PDN-GW during a handover between different accesses
involving a Gn/Gp interface (i.e. from E-UTRAN to 2G/3G and vice versa) is
reported inside the IRI BEGIN- END transaction. The same correlation number
shall be used before and after the handover during the same IRI transaction.
After the handover, the events sent by the PDN-GW shall be mapped into IRIs
according to the requirements for the new access.
In case the target is related to a ProSe Remote UE or to a ProSe UE-to-NW
Relay, additional requirements specified in clause 13 are applicable.
## 10.1 Identifiers
### 10.1.0 Introduction
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception
uniquely and to correlate between the data, which is conveyed over the
different handover interfaces (HI2 and HI3). The identifiers are defined in
the subsequent subclauses of 10.1.
For the delivery of CC and IRI the S-GW or PDN-GW provide correlation numbers
and target identities to the HI2 and HI3. The correlation number is unique per
EPS bearer/tunnel and is used to correlate CC with IRI and the different
IRI\'s of one EPS bearer/tunnel.
NOTE: When different protocols (i.e. GTP and PMIP) are used in the networks,
different values for the correlation number can be generated by different
nodes for the same communication.
### 10.1.1 Lawful interception identifier
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized
operator (NO/AN/SP) shall assign a special Lawful Interception Identifier
(LIID), which has been agreed between the LEA and the operator (NO/AN/SP).
Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it
easier to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the
authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) and the handling agents at the LEA.
The LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records.
It shall be used within any information exchanged at the handover interfaces
HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for
example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference
number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall either enter a unique LIID for each
target identity of the target or a single LIID for multiple target identities
all pertaining to the same target.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be
unique LIIDs assigned relating to each LEA.
### 10.1.2 Network identifier
The network identifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be
internationally unique. It consists of the following two identifiers.
1) Operator- (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory):\ Unique identification of
network operator, access network provider or service provider.
2) Network element identifier NEID (optional):\ The purpose of the network
element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element
carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending,
etc.
> A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier.
> National regulations may mandate the sending of the NEID.
### 10.1.3 Correlation number
The Correlation Number is unique per EPS bearer/tunnel and is used for the
following purposes:
\- correlate CC with IRI;
\- correlate different IRI records within one EPS bearer/tunnel;
\- correlate LALS reports with the IRI records of the triggering events.
NOTE: The Correlation Number is at a minimum unique for each concurrent
communication (e.g. EPS bearer/tunnel) of a target within a lawful
authorization. However when different protocols (i.e. GTP and PMIP) are used
in the networks, different values for the correlation number can be generated
by different nodes for the same communication.
In case of handover between different accesses involving a Gn/Gp interface
(i.e. from E-UTRAN to 2G/3G and vice versa), the same correlation number for
the PDP context/bearer shall be used before and after the handover during the
same IRI transaction.
## 10.2 Timing and quality
### 10.2.1 Timing
As a general principle, within a telecommunication system, IRI, if buffered,
should be buffered for as short a time as possible.
NOTE: If the transmission of IRI fails, it may be buffered or lost.
Subject to national requirements, the following timing requirements shall be
supported:
\- Each IRI data record shall be sent by the delivery function to the LEMF
over the HI2 within seconds of the detection of the triggering event by the
IAP at least 95% of the time;
\- Each IRI data record shall contain a time-stamp, based on the intercepting
nodes clock that is generated following the detection of the IRI triggering
event. The timestamp precision should be at least 1 second (ETSI TS 101 671
[24]). Defining the required precision of an IRI timestamp however is subject
to national requirements.
### 10.2.2 Quality
The quality of service associated with the result of interception should be
(at least) equal to the quality of service of the original content of
communication. This may be derived from the QoS class used for the original
intercepted session. However, when TCP is used as an OSI layer 4 protocol
across the HI3, real time delivery of the result of the interception cannot be
guaranteed. The QoS used from the operator (NO/AN/SP) to the LEMF is
determined by what operators (NO/AN/SP) and law enforcement agree upon.
### 10.2.3 Void
Void.
## 10.3 Security aspects
Security is defined by national requirements.
## 10.4 Quantitative aspects
The number of target interceptions supported is a national requirement.
The area of Quantitative Aspects addresses the ability to perform multiple,
simultaneous interceptions within a provider\'s network and at each of the
relevant intercept access points within the network. Specifics related to this
topic include:
\- The ability to access and monitor all simultaneous communications
originated, received, or redirected by the target;
\- The ability for multiple LEAs (up to five) to monitor, simultaneously, the
same target while maintaining unobtrusiveness, including between agencies;
> \- The ability of the network to simultaneously support a number of separate
> (i.e. multiple targets) legally authorized interceptions within its service
> area(s), including different levels of authorization for each interception,
> including between agencies (i.e. IRI only, or IRI and communication
> content).
## 10.5 IRI for evolved packet domain
### 10.5.0 Introduction
The IRI will in principle be available in the following phases of a data
transmission:
1\. At connection attempt when the target identity becomes active, at which
time packet transmission may or may not occur (set up of a bearer/tunnel,
target may be the originating or terminating party);
2\. At the end of a connection, when the target identity becomes inactive
(removal of a bearer/tunnel);
3\. At certain times when relevant information are available.
In addition, information on non-transmission related actions of a target
constitute IRI and is sent via HI2. Also, the EPS LALS reports convey via HI2
as IRI.
The IRI may be subdivided into the following categories:
1\. Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information);
**2.** Basic data context information, for standard data transmission between
two parties.
The events defined in TS 33.107 [19] are used to generate records for the
delivery via HI2.
There are several different event types received at DF2 level. According to
each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF if this is required. In the case of
LALS reports which are not associated with an event, a Record is sent to the
LEMF without the event parameter.
The following table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level
and record type sent to the LEMF. The applicability of the events to specific
access (E-UTRAN, trusted non-3GPP access, untrusted non-3GPP access) and
network protocols (GTP/PMIP S5/S8 interface) is specified in TS 33.107 [19].
Additional events and mapping with IRI Record type are applicable to EPS in
case of interworking between SGSN and PDN-GW over Gn/Gp interface, as
specified in this document for PS interception.

NOTE 1: In some situation (e.g. during activation of second, third, etc,
intercepts on the target), the MF/DF may have to detect on its own that an
interception is activated on a target.
NOTE 2: These events are also used for IoT UE's NIDD communications using
SCEF.
The EPS LALS records are sent to the LEMF as the REPORT IRI Records.
A set of information is used to generate the records. The records used
transmit the information from mediation function to LEMF. This set of
information can be extended in the network nodes or DF2 MF, if this is
necessary in a specific country. The following table gives the mapping between
information received per event and information sent in records.

### 10.5.1 Events and information
#### 10.5.1.0 Introduction
This clause describes the information sent from the Delivery Function (DF) to
the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) to support Lawfully Authorized
Electronic Surveillance (LAES). The information is described as records and
information carried by a record. This focus is on describing the information
being transferred to the LEMF.
The IRI events and data are encoded into records as defined in the Table
10.5.1 Mapping between EPS Events and HI2 records type and Annex B.9 Intercept
related information (HI2). IRI is described in terms of a \'causing event\'
and information associated with that event. Within each IRI Record there is a
set of events and associated information elements to support the particular
service.
The communication events described in Table 10.5.1: Mapping between EPS Events
and HI2 record type and Table 10.5.2: Mapping between Events information and
IRI information convey the basic information for reporting the disposition of
a communication. This clause describes those events and supporting
information.
Each record described in this clause consists of a set of parameters. Each
parameter is either:
mandatory (M) - required for the record,
conditional (C) - required in situations where a condition is met (the
condition is given in the Description), or
optional (O) - provided at the discretion of the implementation.
The information to be carried by each parameter is identified. Both optional
and conditional parameters are considered to be OPTIONAL syntactically in
ASN.1 Stage 3 descriptions. The Stage 2 inclusion takes precedence over Stage
3 syntax.
#### 10.5.1.1 REPORT record information
The REPORT record is used to report non-communication related target actions
(events) and for reporting unsuccessful packet-mode communication attempts. In
addition, this record is also used to report some target actions which may
trigger communication attempts or modifications of an existing communication,
when the communication attempt or the change of the existing communication
itself is reported separately. The REPORT records are also used to deliver the
LALS reports.
The REPORT record shall be triggered when:
\- the target's UE performs an E-UTRAN attach procedure (successful or
unsuccessful) including via a HeNB;
\- the target's UE performs an E-UTRAN detach procedure including via a HeNB;
\- the target's UE is unsuccessful at performing an EPS bearer activation
procedure;
\- the target\'s UE performs an UE requested bearer resource modification;
\- the target's UE performs a tracking area/EPS location update;
\- optionally when the target's UE leaves the old MME;
\- the target's UE performs an UE requested PDN connectivity procedure;
\- the target's UE performs an UE requested PDN disconnection procedure;
\- the target's UE is unsuccessful at performing a PMIP attach/tunnel
activation procedure;
\- the target's UE is unsuccessful at performing a MIP registration/tunnel
activation procedure;
\- the target's UE is unsuccessful at performing a DSMIP registration/tunnel
activation procedure;
\- optionally when the target's UE enters or leaves IA (FFS);
\- the target's UE is ordered by the network to perform an home agent switch;
\- as a national option, a mobile terminal is authorized for service with
another network operator or service provider; in that case, other related
events are required as cancel location, register location, location
information request from a third party's node;
\-- as a national option, a REPORT record have to be generated when there is a
HSS subscriber record change of IMSI or of MSISDN or IMEI triggered by a
messages to or from the HSS;
\- the interception of a target is started with E-UTRAN attached target. If
there are more than one PDN connections then a REPORT record is generated per
PDN connection.;
\- packet data header reporting is performed on an individual intercepted
packet basis and a packet is detected as it is sent or received by the target
for an EPS bearer/session.;
\- when packet data summary reporting is performed on an summary basis for an
EPS bearer/session associated with a particular packet flow (defined as the
combination of source IP address, destination IP address, source port,
destination port, and protocol and for Ipv6 also include the flow label) and:
\- the packet flow starts,
\- an interim packet summary report is to be provided, or
\- packet flow ends including the case where the EPS bearer/session is
deactivated.
An interim packet summary report is triggered if:
\- the expiration of a configurable Summary Timer per intercept occurs. The
Summary Timer is configurable in units of seconds, or
\- a per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached;
\- when a LALS report is received from the LI LCS Client.
Packet Data Header Information is reported either on a per-packet (i.e., non-
summarised) basis or in a summary report. These reports provide IRI associated
with the packets detected. The packet data header information related REPORT

#### 10.5.1.2 BEGIN record information
The BEGIN record is used to convey the first event of EPS communication
interception.
The BEGIN record shall be triggered in the following cases:
\- successful EPS bearer activation or tunnel establishment;
\- the interception of a target\'s communications is started and at least one
EPS bearer or tunnel is active. In this case, some of the parameters,
available at EPS bearer or tunnel activation may be not available any longer
at the node. It is not required to store these parameters at the node to be
used just in case of LI activation at later stage. If more than one EPS bearer
or tunnel is active, a BEGIN record shall be generated for each EPS bearer or
tunnel that is active;
\- during the S-GW relocation, when there is a change in the PLMN or when the
information about the change in the PLMN is not available at the DF/MF;
\- the target entered an interception area and has at least one EPS
bearer/tunnel active (FFS).

intercepting the target due previous LI activation on the same target.
#### 10.5.1.3 CONTINUE record information
The CONTINUE record is used to convey events during an active EPS
bearer/tunnel.
The CONTINUE record shall be triggered in the following cases:
\- An active EPS bearer/session is modified.
\- During the S-GW relocation, when target has got at least one EPS
bearer/tunnel active, the PLMN does not change and the triggering event
information is available at the DF/MF.
NOTE: This scenario does not apply to DSMIP and MIP protocol cases.
\- In case of handover between different accesses when GTP based messages are
intercepted. In this case, the RAT type indicates the new access after the
handover.
In order to enable the LEMF to correlate the information on HI3, a new
correlation number shall not be generated within a CONTINUE record.

## 10.6 IRI reporting for evolved packet domain at PDN-GW
Interception in the PDN-GW is a national option. However, in certain scenarios
the PDN-GW is the only ICE in the 3GPP network where interception in the PLMN
accessed by the target can be performed (i.e., for trusted non-3GPP access,
the HPLMN in case of non roaming and the VPLMN in case of roaming with local
breakout).
As a national option, in the case where the PDN-GW is reporting IRI for a
target, the target is handed off to another S-GW and the same PDN-GW continues
to handle the content of communications subject to roaming agreements, the
PDN-GW shall continue to report the IRIs.
NOTE: In some situation (e.g. during activation of second, third, etc,
intercepts on the target), the MF/DF may have to detect on its own that an
interception is activated on a target with active bearer or with active
PMIP/MIP/DSMIP tunnel.
## 10.7 Content of communication interception for evolved packet domain at
PDN-GW
Interception in the PDN-GW is a national option. However, in certain scenarios
the PDN-GW is the only ICE in the 3GPP network where interception in the PLMN
accessed by the target can be performed (i.e., for trusted non-3GPP access,
the HPLMN in case of non roaming and the VPLMN in case of roaming with local
breakout).
As a national option, in the case where the PDN-GW is performing interception
of the content of communications, the target is handed off to another S-GW and
the same PDN-GW continues to handle the content of communications subject to
roaming agreements, the PDN-GW shall continue to perform the interception of
the content of communication.
# 11 3GPP IMS Conference Services
## 11.1 Identifiers
### 11.1.1 Overview
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception
uniquely and to correlate between the data, which is conveyed over the
different handover interfaces (HI2 and HI3). The identifiers are defined in
the subsections below.
For the delivery of CC, the MRFP provides correlation numbers and target
identities to the HI3. The AS/MRFC reports the IRI associated with the
conference services.
For the delivery of CC and IRI, the AS/MRFC/MRFP provides correlation numbers
and target identities to the HI2 and HI3. For a given target the correlation
number is unique per conference session.
> NOTE: If two or more target identities are involved in the same conference
> session the same Correlation Number may be assigned by the relevant network
> element to the communication sessions of the different target identities.
### 11.1.2 Lawful interception identifier
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized
operator (NO/AN/SP) shall assign a special Lawful Interception Identifier
(LIID), which has been agreed between the LEA and the operator (NO/AN/SP).
Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it
easier to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the
authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) and the handling agents at the LEA.
The LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records.
It shall be used within any information exchanged at the handover interfaces
HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for
example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference
number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall either enter, based on an agreement
with each LEA, a unique LIID for each target identity of the target or a
single LIID for multiple target identities all pertaining to the same target.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be
unique LIIDs assigned relating to each LEA.
Note that, in order to simplify the use of the LIID at LEMF for the purpose of
correlating IMS signalling with GSN CC, the use of a single LIID in
association with potentially numerous IMS identities (SIP and TEL URIs) is
recommended.
In case the LIID of a given target has different values in the GSN and in the
CSCF, it is up to the LEMF to recover the association between the two LIIDs.
### 11.1.3 Network identifier
The network identifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be
internationally unique. It consists of the following two identifiers.
1) Operator- (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory):\ Unique identification of
network operator, access network provider or service provider.
2) Network element identifier NEID (optional):\ The purpose of the network
element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element
carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending,
etc.
A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier.
National regulations may mandate the sending of the NEID.
### 11.1.4 Correlation number
For a given target the Correlation Number is unique per conference session and
used for the following purposes:
\- correlate CC with IRI,
\- correlate different IRI records within one conference session.
NOTE: The Correlation Number is at a minimum unique for each concurrent
communication of a target within a lawful authorization.
## 11.2 Timing and quality
### 11.2.1 Timing
As a general principle, within a telecommunication system, IRI, if buffered,
should be buffered for as short a time as possible.
NOTE: If the transmission of IRI fails, it may be buffered or lost.
Subject to national requirements, the following timing requirements shall be
supported:
\- Each IRI data record shall be sent by the delivery function to the LEMF
over the HI2 within seconds of the detection of the triggering event by the
IAP at least 95% of the time.
\- Each IRI data record shall contain a time-stamp, based on the intercepting
node\'s clock that is generated following the detection of the IRI triggering
event.
### 11.2.2 Quality
The quality of service associated with the result of interception should be
(at least) equal to the highest quality of service of the original content of
communication for all participants. This may be derived from the QoS class
used for the original intercepted session, TS 23.107 [20]. However, when TCP
is used as an OSI layer 4 protocol across the HI3, real time delivery of the
result of the interception cannot be guaranteed. The QoS used from the
operator (NO/AN/SP) to the LEMF is determined by what operators (NO/AN/SP) and
law enforcement agree upon.
### 11.2.3 Void
(Void)
## 11.3 Security aspects
Security is defined by national requirements.
## 11.4 Quantitative aspects
The number of target interceptions supported is a national requirement.
The area of Quantitative Aspects addresses the ability to perform multiple,
simultaneous interceptions within a provider\'s network and at each of the
relevant intercept access points within the network. Specifics related to this
topic include:
\- The ability to access and monitor all simultaneous communications
originated, received, or redirected by the target;
\- The ability for multiple LEAs (up to five) to monitor, simultaneously, the
same target while maintaining unobtrusiveness, including between agencies;
\- The ability of the network to simultaneously support a number of separate
(i.e. multiple targets) legally authorized interceptions within its service
area(s), including different levels of authorization for each interception
(i.e. IRI only, or IRI and communication content), including between agencies.
## 11.5 IRI for IMS Conference Services
### 11.5.0 Introduction
The IRI will in principle be available in the following phases of a conference
service transmission:
1) At a conference creation, when the target successfully provisions or
requests that a conference is created;
2) At the start of a conference, when the first party is joined to the
conference; the conference may be provisioned or requested by the target or
the conference is the target of interception;
3) At the end of a conference, when the last party on the conference leaves or
the conference is terminated by the conference server; the conference may be
provisioned or requested by the target or the conference is the target;
4) At certain times when relevant information are available.
The IRI may be subdivided into the following categories:
1\. Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information);
**2.** Basic data communication information, for standard data transmission
between two parties.
The events defined in TS 33.107 [19] are used to generate records for the
delivery via HI2.
There are multiple different event types received at DF2 level. According to
each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF if this is required. The following
table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level and record
type sent to the LEMF.

A set of information is used to generate the records. The records used
transmit the information from mediation function to LEMF. This set of
information can be extended in the ICE or DF2 MF, if this is necessary in a
specific country. The following table gives the mapping between information
received per event and information sent in records.

### 11.5.1 Events and information
#### 11.5.1.1 Overview
This clause describes the information sent from the Delivery Function (DF) to
the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) to support Lawful Interception
(LI). The information is described as records and information carried by a
record. This focus is on describing the information being transferred to the
LEMF.
The IRI events and data are encoded into records as defined in the Table 11.1
Mapping between Conference Service Events and HI2 records type and Annex B.11
Intercept related information (HI2). IRI is described in terms of a \'causing
event\' and information associated with that event. Within each IRI record
there is a set of events and associated information elements to support the
particular service.
The communication events described in Table 11.1: Mapping between Conference
Service Events and HI2 record type and Table 11.2: Mapping between Events
information and IRI information convey the basic information for reporting the
disposition of a communication. This clause describes those events and
supporting information.
Each record described in this clause consists of a set of parameters. Each
parameter is either:
mandatory (M) - required for the record,
conditional (C) - required in situations where a condition is met (the
condition is given in the Description), or
optional (O) - provided at the discretion of the implementation.
The information to be carried by each parameter is identified. Both optional
and conditional parameters are considered to be OPTIONAL syntactically in
ASN.1 Stage 3 descriptions. The Stage 2 inclusion takes precedence over Stage
3 syntax.
#### 11.5.1.2 BEGIN record information
The BEGIN record is used to convey the first event of conference service
communication interception.
The BEGIN record shall be triggered when:
\- a target provisioned or requested conference is started (i.e., when the
first party is joined to the conference, or when the first party accesses the
conference but has to wait for a conference host/owner/chairman to join);
\- a conference that is the target is started (i.e., when the first party is
joined to the conference, or when the first party accesses the conference but
has to wait for a conference host/owner/chairman to join);
\- an interception is activated during an on-going conference call.

* * *
When the AS/MRFC is not aware of the activation of multiple lawfully
authorized intercepts on an on-going conference call of a single target, the
MF/DF shall generate the BEGIN record with _Start of Intercept with Conference
Active_ on its own using information that it has retained.
When the BEGIN-record is used to convey the start of interception on an on-
going conference, the DF2 shall not send the Start of Intercept with
Conference Active BEGIN record to the LEMFs that were already intercepting the
conference due previous LI activation on the same target or conference.
#### 11.5.1.3 CONTINUE record information
The CONTINUE record is used to convey the events during an active conference.
The CONTINUE record shall be triggered when:
\- a party successfully joins the target\'s conference or a conference that is
the target;
\- a party unsuccessfully attempts to join the target\'s conference or a
conference that is the target;
\- a party successfully leaves (e.g. normal disconnection or involuntary
termination/removal) a target\'s conference or a conference that is a target;
\- a party unsuccessfully attempts to drop another party from the target\'s
conference or a conference that is the target;
\- a party successfully modifies (e.g. adds, removes, changes) media in the
conference;
\- a party unsuccessfully manages modifies (e.g. adds, removes, changes) media
in the conference;
\- there was an unsuccessful attempt to terminate a target provisioned or
requested conference;
\- there was an unsuccessful attempt to terminate a conference that is the
target.
In order to enable the LEMF to correlate the information on HI3, a new
correlation number shall not be generated within a CONTINUE record.
NOTE: Reporting of participant signalling to manage conference features (e.g.
(un)mute) is for further study.

## 11.6 CC for IMS Conference Services
The interface protocols and data structures defined in Annex B.11.2 have been
enhanced to cater for the requirements of IMS Conferencing services. In
particular, media types (bearers) that require multicasting at the MRFP, a
party identifier is needed to identify the source of that bearer stream. The
enhanced data structure also allows for the reporting of separate media
streams for each user on the conference.
# 12 3GPP IMS-based VoIP Services
## 12.1 Identifiers
### 12.1.1 Overview
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception
uniquely and to correlate between the communication information, which is
conveyed over the different handover interfaces (HI2 and HI3). The identifiers
are defined in the subsections below. The eP-CSCF and enhanced IMS-AGW (eIMS-
AGW) shall adhere to all the LI requirements pertaining to a P-CSCF and IMS-
AGW, respectively. Any additional LI requirements pertaining to the support of
WebRTC Interworking as specified in TS 23.228 [40] that only apply to the eP-
CSCF or eIMS-AGW are described distinctly.
Based on the WebRTC Interworking as described in TS 23.228 [40], an individual
Public User Identity is used as the target of interception in a WebRTC
interworking system. Some additional considerations are included below.
1) When a Public User Identity may be temporarily assigned to a WebRTC IMS
Client (WIC) from a pool of Public User Identities, an underlying identity for
the WIC used during authentication (called a web identity in TS 24.371 [86],
e.g. NAI) will need to be correlated to the temporary Public User Identity
assigned to the WIC. This is needed to ensure that target identified in the
lawful authorization is associated with the Public User Identity assigned to
the user.
2) When a lawful authorization is targeting an entire pool of Public User
Identites, the target should still be each individual Public User Identity
associated with the pool of Public User Identities.
NOTE: As U.2.1.4 of TS 23.228 [40] indicates that WebRTC Web Server Function
(WWSF) may be located in a third party network and have a business arrangement
with the IMS operator, this third party network will have its own LI functions
according to national regulation. This point and the definition of a target or
parties in the annex B9 is FFS. Also, some national regulations may prohibit
the WWSF or WebRTC Authorisation Function (WAF) from using the option of not
authenticating the user, especially as unauthenticated users are anonymous to
the third party but may still be authorized for IMS service.
### 12.1.2 Lawful Interception Identifier
See clause 7.1.1.
### 12.1.3 Network Identifier
See clause 7.1.2.
### 12.1.4 Correlation Number
For a given target, the Correlation Number is unique per VoIP session and used
for the following purposes:
\- Correlate CC with IRI,
\- Correlate different IRI records and different CC data within one VoIP
session.
For IMS-based VoIP, the S-CSCF and optionally, the P-CSCF provide the IRI
events. For IMS-based VoIP, the functional element that provides the CC
interception depends on the call scenario and network configuration.
As described in TS 33.107 [19], CC interception is done by one of the
following functional elements (referred to as CC Intercept Function):
\- PDN-GW/GGSN
\- IMS-AGW
\- TrGW
\- IM-MGW
\- MRF.
And, the trigger to perform the CC interception at the above functional
elements may be provided by the following functional elements (referred to as
CC Interception Triggering Function):
\- P-CSCF for PDN-GW/GGSN
\- P-CSCF for IMS-AGW
\- IBCF for TrGW
\- MGCF for IM-MGW
\- S-CSCF or AS for MRF.
For the delivery of CC, the CC Intercept Triggering Function provides the
Correlation Number to the CC Intercept Function. This Correlation Number is
delivered to the LEMF on the handover interface HI3 and is also delivered to
the LEMF on the handover interface HI2.
The IMS-VoIP-Correlation delivered to the LEMF on the HI2, contains the
Correlation Number (s) used for the IRI messages as ims-iri (IRI-to-IRI-
Correlation) and Correlation Number (s) used for the CC data as ims-cc (IRI-
to-CC-Correlation). The LEMF shall interpret that the IRI messages and the CC
data containing those Correlation Number values belong to the one single IMS
VoIP session.
## 12.2 Timing and quality
Refer to clause 7.2 for the details.
## 12.3 Security aspects
Refer to clause 7.3 for the details.
## 12.4 Quantitative aspects
Refer to clause 7.4 for the details.
## 12.5 IRI for IMS-based VoIP
IRI for VoIP shall be based on the procedures defined in 7.5 IRI for IMS with
the following change specific to IMS-based VoIP:
\- According to TS 33.107 [19], national option may require a CSP to report
the LEMF about the situation where the CC delivery is required for an
intercept order but the media does not enter the CSP\'s network, and hence,
not available for interception.
\- To support this case, a CC-Unavailable event is added to the IMS events
with a parameter added to the list of IRI parameters that gives the reason for
CC unavailability. The CC-Unavailable is reported only when the media
interception is required according to the intercept order but the media is not
available for interception.
## 12.6 CC for IMS-based VoIP
Annex B.12 provides the definitions of the data structures to be used for the
delivery of CC for IMS-based VoIP (see Annex K for the detailed description).
The Correlation Number received from the CC Intercept Triggering Function
shall be used in the CC Data sent over the HI3.
For PDN-GW based interception of CC for IMS-based VoIP, optionally, the data
structures defined in B.10 can be used if the combined delivery option is not
required. In the same way, for GGSN based interception of CC for IMS-based
VoIP, optionally, the data structures defined in B.10 or B.4 can be used if
the combined delivery option is not required.
The Correlation Number received from the P-CSCF shall be used in the CC data
sent over the handover interface (HI3).
## 12.7 VoLTE Roaming
### 12.7.1 General
Two roaming architectures are defined for VoLTE:
\- S8HR.
\- LBO.
As described in TS 33.107 [19], with S8HR as the roaming architecture, the
PDN-GW and the P-CSCF reside in the HPLMN and therefore, the UE IMS signalling
and media are directly routed to the HPLMN. In the alternate roaming
architecture (Local Breakout), the PDN-GW and P-CSCF reside in the VPLMN.
In VoLTE roaming scenario, the lawful interceptions performed in the HPLMN and
in the VPLMN are independent of each other. As such, the HPLMN is not aware
of, if, any LI activities are performed in the VPLMN. Likewise, the VPLMN is
not aware of, if, any LI activities are performed in the HPLMN.
### 12.7.2 LI in HPLMN
The interception of voice services in the HPLMN is done according to clause 15
of TS 33.107 [19] and the reporting of IRI messages over HI2 and CC over HI3
are done according to the sub-clause 12.5 (IRI) and the sub-clause 12.6 (CC)
of this document.
#### 12.7.2.1 With S8HR
With S8HR, as described in TS 33.107 [19], the IRI messages are generated by
the S-CSCF and, optionally, by the P-CSCF.
As described in TS 33.107 [19], the CC is generated by the PDN-GW or by the
IMS-AGW and, for redirecting scenarios, by the IM-MGW or by the TrGW.
#### 12.7.2.2 With LBO
With LBO, as described in TS 33.107 [19], the IRI messages are generated by
the S-CSCF.
As described in TS 33.107 [19], the CC is generated by the TrGW and, for
redirecting scenarios, by the IM-MGW or by the TrGW. In some variations of
LBO, the CC may not be available in the HPLMN in which case, HPLMN shall send
the CC-Unavailable message to the LEMF as described in sub-clause 12.5.
### 12.7.3 LI in VPLMN with S8HR
See clause 20 and Annex J of TS 33.107 [19] for a detailed description of S8HR
LI architectural aspects. A condensed view of the same is presented in figure
12.1 below.
Figure 12.1: Lawful Interception in the VPLMN with S8HR as the roaming
architecture
The Serving Gateway/BBIFF extracts the data from the IMS signalling bearer of
S8HR APNs and delivers the same to the LMISF. When the IMS signalling messages
are related to a target communication, the LMISF generates the IMS events and
sends the same to the Delivery Function 2 over the X2 reference point.
In addition, the Serving Gateway/BBIFF provides the LMISF with Media Bearer
information of S8HR APNs over Xib reference point.
Based on the instruction received over the Xib reference point, the Serving
Gateway/BBIFF extracts the the packets from associated media bearer and
delivers the same to the LMISF. From those media packets, the LMISF delivers
the CC along with the correlation information to the Delivery Function 3 over
the X3 reference point.
NOTE 1: The confidentiality protection is disabled for roaming targets with
S8HR as the roaming architecture, and therefore, the SIP messages and the
voice-media content are always visible in clear form (i.e. no encryption) at
the Serving Gateway/BBIFF.
NOTE 2: Like X2 and X3, the Xia and Xib reference points are not standardized
in the present document.
The reporting of IRI messages over HI2 and CC over HI3 are done according to
the sub-clause 12.5 (IRI) and the sub-clause 12.6 (CC) with the following
additions:
\- Include the VoIP roaming indication with the choice value of
\"roamingS8HR\" indicating that the IMS events are generated in the VPLMN with
S8HR as the roaming architecture. See annex B.9 for ASN.1 definition.
\- Include the ICE-type with the value \"lmISF\" or \"sGW\" in the CC. See
annex B.12 for ASN.1 definition.
### 12.7.4 LI in VPLMN with LBO
The interception of voice services in the VPLMN is done according to clause 15
of TS 33.107 [19] and the reporting of IRI messages over HI2 and the CC over
HI3 are done according to the sub-clause 12.5 (IRI) and the sub-clause 12.6
(CC) with the following addition:
\- Include the VoIP roaming indication with the choice value of \"roamingLBO\"
indicating that the IMS events are generated in the VPLMN with LBO as the
roaming architecture. See annex B.9 for ASN.1 definition.
As described in TS 33.107 [19], the IRI messages are generated by the P-CSCF
and the CC is generated by the by PDN-GW or by the IMS-AGW.
## 12.8 Roaming Constraints to IMS VoIP/VoLTE LI
National regulations may limit delivery of communications (CC and
communications-associated IRI) of an outbound international roaming target by
the HPLMN as described in Clause 5.1.4 of [7].
If roaming interception is allowed, IMS VoIP (including VoLTE) interception
and delivery to the LEMF by the HPLMN shall proceed normally as described
elsewhere in this specification when the target is roaming outside the country
as well as when the target is within the country.
If roaming interception is not allowed and the HPLMN determines that the
target is outside the country, the HPLMN shall act as described in Clause 15.5
of TS 33.107 [19]. For scenarios where the invocation of a supplementary
service causes the status of the target to change from participating to not
participating, the HPLMN starts intercepting and reporting events to the LEMF.
The HPLMN shall utilize:
\- the Start of interception for already established IMS session REPORT Record
as described in Clause 7.5 for non-conference calls;
\- the Start of Intercept with Conference Active REPORT Record as described in
Clause 11.5.1.2 for target provisioned or requested conference calls hosted by
the HPLMN.
# 13 Interception of Proximity Services (ProSe)
## 13.1 General
### 13.1.1 Identifiers
#### 13.1.1.1 Overview
Specific identifiers are necessary to uniquely identify a target for
interception, and to correlate between the data, which is conveyed over the
handover interface (HI2). The identifiers are defined in the subsequent
subclauses of 13.1.1.
#### 13.1.1.2 Lawful interception identifier
For each target identity related to an interception warrant, the authorized
CSP shall assign a Lawful Interception Identifier (LIID).
Using an indirect identification to point to a target identity makes it easier
to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the authorized
CSP and the LEA.
The LIID is a component of the IRI records. It shall be used within any
information exchanged at the handover interfaces HI2 for identification and
correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for
example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference
number, and the date when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized CSP shall either enter a LIID for each target identity of the
target or a single LIID for multiple target identities all pertaining to the
same target.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be LIIDs
assigned relating to each LEA.
#### 13.1.1.3 Network identifier
The network identifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be
internationally unique. It consists of the following two identifiers.
1) Operator- (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory):\ Unique identification of
network operator, access network provider or service provider.
2) Network element identifier NEID (optional):\ The purpose of the network
element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element
carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending,
etc.
A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier.
National regulations may mandate the sending of the NEID.
### 13.1.2 Timing and quality
#### 13.1.2.1 Timing
As a general principle, within a telecommunication system, IRI, if buffered,
should be buffered for as short a time as possible.
NOTE: If the transmission of IRI fails, it may be buffered or lost.
Subject to national requirements, the following timing requirements shall be
supported:
\- Each IRI data record shall be sent by the delivery function to the LEMF
over the HI2 within seconds of the detection of the triggering event by the
IAP at least 95% of the time.
\- Each IRI data record shall contain a time-stamp, based on the intercepting
node\'s clock that is generated following the detection of the IRI triggering
event.
#### 13.1.2.2 Quality
The QoS used from the CSP to the LEMF is determined by what operators
(NO/AN/SP) and law enforcement agree upon.
### 13.1.3 Security aspects
Security is defined by national requirements.
### 13.1.4 Quantitative aspects
The number of target interceptions supported is a national requirement.
The area of Quantitative Aspects addresses the ability to perform multiple,
simultaneous interceptions within a CSP\'s network and at each of the relevant
intercept access points within the network. Specifics related to this topic
include:
\- The ability to access and monitor all simultaneous communications
originated, received, or redirected by the target;
\- The ability for multiple LEAs (up to five) to monitor, simultaneously, the
same target while maintaining unobtrusiveness, including between agencies;
\- The ability of the network to simultaneously support a number of separate
(i.e. multiple targets) legally authorized interceptions within its service
area(s), including different levels of authorization for each interception,
including between agencies (i.e. IRI only, or IRI and communication content).
## 13.2 ProSe Direct Discovery
### 13.2.1 General
For ProSe Direct Discovery, the LI solution in this subclause provides an IRI
solution only as there is no CC.
The IRI will in principle be available in the following phases of ProSe Direct
Discovery:
1\. At Discovery Request;
2\. At Match Report.
The IRI may be subdivided into the following categories:
1\. Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information);
**2.** Prose Direct Discovery information.
The events defined in TS 33.107 [19] are used to generate records for the
delivery via HI2.
There are multiple different event types received at DF2 level. According to
each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF if this is required. The following
table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level and record
type sent to the LEMF.
Table 13.2.1-1: Mapping between Direct Discovery Events and HI2 records type

* * *
NOTE: LIID parameter needs to be present in each record sent to the LEMF.
### 13.2.2 Events and information
#### 13.2.2.1 Overview
This clause describes the information sent from the Delivery Function (DF) to
the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) to support Lawful Interception
(LI). The information is described as records and information carried by a
record. This focus is on describing the information being transferred to the
LEMF.
The IRI events and data are encoded into records as defined in the Table
13.2.1-1: Mapping between Direct Discovery Events and HI2 records type and
Annex B.13 Intercept related information for ProSe. IRI is described in terms
of a \'causing event\' and information associated with that event. Within each
IRI record there is a set of events and associated information elements to
support the particular service.
The direct discovery events described in Table 13.2.1-1: Mapping between
Direct Discovery Events and HI2 records type and Table 13.2.1-2: Mapping
between Events information and IRI information convey the basic information
for reporting direct discovery. This clause describes those events and
supporting information.
Each record described in this clause consists of a set of parameters. Each
parameter is either:
mandatory (M) - required for the record,
conditional (C) - required in situations where a condition is met (the
condition is given in the Description), or
optional (O) - provided at the discretion of the implementation.
The information to be carried by each parameter is identified. Both optional
and conditional parameters are considered to be OPTIONAL syntactically in
ASN.1 Stage 3 descriptions. The Stage 2 inclusion takes precedence over Stage
3 syntax.
#### 13.2.2.2 REPORT record information
The REPORT record is used to report non-communication related target actions
(events).
The REPORT record shall be triggered when:
\- The ProSe Function receives a Discovery Request from the UE. See Table
13.2.2.2-1.
\- The ProSe Function receives a Match Report from the UE. See Table
13.2.2.2-2.

## 13.3 ProSe Remote UE communications
### 13.3.1 General
The provisions in this clause specify the LI handover interface to report IRIs
in case a ProSe Remote UE communicates through a ProSe UE-to-NW Relay.
TS 33.107 [19] specifies, see clause 17.3.3, in case the ProSe UE-to-NW Relay
is a target, the conditions under which CC is required to be intercepted.
CC interception, when required, shall be reported according to annex B.10.
The IRIs will in principle be available in the following phases of ProSe
Remote UE communications:
1\. When a target ProSe Remote UE connects to or disconnects from a ProSe UE-
to-NW Relay;
2\. When a ProSe Remote UE connects to or disconnects from a target ProSe UE-
to-NW Relay;
3\. When a target ProSe Remote UE starts communication by using a ProSe UE-to-
NW Relay;
4\. When a target ProSe Remote UE ends communication by using a ProSe UE-to-NW
Relay;
5\. When interception is started for a target ProSe Remote UE with ongoing
communication;
6\. When interception is started for a Prose UE-to-NW Relay with connected
ProSe Remote UE(s).
In addition, requirements specified in clause 10 are also applicable:
1\. When a Tracking Area/EPS Location Update occurs for a target ProSe UE-to-
NW Relay;
2\. When a target ProSe UE-to-NW Relay uses one or more PDN connections for
any activity/communication which is not related to relaying;
3\. To IRI and CC interception related to a target ProSe UE-to-NW Relay, when
national regulations require to intercept all the CC handled by a target ProSe
UE-to-NW Relay.
The IRI may be subdivided into the following categories:
1\. Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information);
2\. Prose Remote UE communications information.
The events defined in TS 33.107 [19] are used to generate records for the
delivery via HI2.
There are multiple different event types received at DF2 level. According to
each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF if this is required. The following
table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level and record
type sent to the LEMF.

A set of information is used to generate the records. The records are used to
transmit the information from the mediation function to LEMF. This set of
information can be extended in the ICE or DF2 MF, if this is necessary in a
specific country. The following table gives the mapping between information
received per event and information sent in records.
The ASN.1 specified in Annex B.9 shall be used to provide HI2 to LEMF.

### 13.3.2 Events and information
#### 13.3.2.1 Overview
This clause specifies the information sent from the Delivery Function (DF) to
the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) to support Lawful Interception
(LI). The information is described as records and parameters carried by a
record. The focus is on describing the information being transferred to the
LEMF.
The IRI events and data are encoded into records as specified in the Table
13.3.1-1: Mapping between ProSe Remote UE communication Events and HI2 records
type and Annex B.9 Intercept related information (HI2 SAE/EPS and IMS). IRI is
specified in terms of a \'causing event\' and parameters associated with that
event. Within each IRI record there is a set of events and associated
information elements to support the particular service.
The ProSe Remote UE communication events specified in Table 13.3.1-1: Mapping
between Direct Discovery Events and HI2 records type and Table 13.3.1-2:
Mapping between Events information and IRI information convey the basic
information for reporting the ProSe Remote UE communication. This clause
describes those events and supporting information.
Each record described in this clause consists of a set of parameters. Each
parameter is either:
mandatory (M) - required for the record,
conditional (C) - required in situations where a condition is met (the
condition is given in the Description), or
optional (O) - provided at the discretion of the implementation.
The information to be carried by each parameter is identified. Both optional
and conditional parameters are considered to be OPTIONAL syntactically in
ASN.1 Stage 3 descriptions. The Stage 2 inclusion takes precedence over Stage
3 syntax.
#### 13.3.2.2 REPORT record information
The REPORT record is used to report non-communication related target actions
(events).
The REPORT record shall be triggered when:
\- The target ProSe Remote UE connects to or disconnects from a ProSe UE-to-NW
Relay. See Table 13.3.2.2-1.
\- One or several UEs connect to or disconnect from a target ProSe UE-to-NW
Relay. See Table 13.3.2.2-1.
\- LI is activated on a target ProSe UE-to-NW Relay with already connected

# 14 Invocation of Lawful Interception (LI) for Group Communications System
Enablers (GCSE)
## 14.1 Background
### 14.1.1 Interception at GCS AS versus other nodes
There are several scenarios possible for the interception of group
communications involving GCSE (see TS 22.468 [83] and TS 23.468 [84]). First
is where the GCS AS is part of the intercepting operator\'s network. Second is
where the GCS AS is outside of the intercepting operator\'s network. This
clause specifies LI solutions for both cases.
## 14.2 GCS AS in Intercepting Operator\'s Network
### 14.2.1 General
In the case where the GCS AS is in the intercepting operator\'s network, the
ICE solution is very similar to the conferencing solution specified in Clause
11, where the main difference is that a single functional entity (the GCS AS)
is utilized for GCSE, rather than two functional entities.
### 14.2.2 Identifiers
#### 14.2.2.1 Overview
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception
uniquely and to correlate between the data, which is conveyed over the
different handover interfaces (HI2 and HI3). The identifiers are defined in
the subsections below.
For the delivery of CC, the GCS AS provides correlation numbers and target
identities to the HI3. The GCS AS reports the IRI associated with the GCSE
group communication services.
For the delivery of CC and IRI, the GCS AS provides correlation numbers and
target identities to the HI2 and HI3. For a given target the correlation
number is unique per group communications session in which the target is a
member.
NOTE: If two or more target identities are involved in the same group
communications session the same Correlation Number may be assigned by the
relevant network element to the communication sessions of the different target
identities.
#### 14.2.2.2 Lawful Interception Identifier
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized
operator (NO/AN/SP) shall assign a special Lawful Interception Identifier
(LIID), which has been agreed between the LEA and the operator (NO/AN/SP).
Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it
easier to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the
authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) and the handling agents at the LEA.
The LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records.
It shall be used within any information exchanged at the handover interfaces
HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for
example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference
number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall either enter, based on an agreement
with each LEA, a unique LIID for each target identity of the target or a
single LIID for multiple target identities all pertaining to the same target.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be
unique LIIDs assigned relating to each LEA.
#### 14.2.2.3 Network Identifier
The network identifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be
internationally unique. It consists of the following two identifiers.
1) Operator- (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory):\ Unique identification of
network operator, access network provider or service provider.
2) Network element identifier NEID (optional):\ The purpose of the network
element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element
carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending,
etc.
A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier.
National regulations may mandate the sending of the NEID.
#### 14.2.2.3 Correlation Number
For a given target the Correlation Number is unique per group communications
session and used for the following purposes:
\- correlate CC with IRI,
\- correlate different IRI records within one group communications session.
NOTE: The Correlation Number is at a minimum unique for each concurrent
communication of a target within a lawful authorization.
### 14.2.3 Timing and quality
#### 14.2.3.1 Timing
As a general principle, within a telecommunication system, IRI, if buffered,
should be buffered for as short a time as possible.
NOTE: If the transmission of IRI fails, it may be buffered or lost.
Subject to national requirements, the following timing requirements shall be
supported:
\- Each IRI data record shall be sent by the delivery function to the LEMF
over the HI2 within seconds of the detection of the triggering event by the
IAP at least 95% of the time.
\- Each IRI data record shall contain a time-stamp, based on the intercepting
node\'s clock that is generated following the detection of the IRI triggering
event.
#### 14.2.3.2 Quality
The quality of service associated with the result of interception should be
(at least) equal to the highest quality of service of the original content of
communication for all participants. This may be derived from the QoS class
used for the original intercepted session, TS 23.107 [20]. However, when TCP
is used as an OSI layer 4 protocol across the HI3, real time delivery of the
result of the interception cannot be guaranteed. The QoS used from the
operator (NO/AN/SP) to the LEMF is determined by what operators (NO/AN/SP) and
law enforcement agree upon.
### 14.2.4 Security Aspects
#### 14.2.4.1 General
Security is defined by national requirements.
### 14.2.5 Quantitative Aspects
#### 14.2.5.1 General
The number of target interceptions supported is a national requirement.
The area of Quantitative Aspects addresses the ability to perform multiple,
simultaneous interceptions within a provider\'s network and at each of the
relevant intercept access points within the network. Specifics related to this
topic include:
\- The ability to access and monitor all simultaneous communications
originated, received, or redirected by the target;
\- The ability for multiple LEAs (up to five) to monitor, simultaneously, the
same target while maintaining unobtrusiveness, including between agencies;
\- The ability of the network to simultaneously support a number of separate
(i.e. multiple targets) legally authorized interceptions within its service
area(s), including different levels of authorization for each interception
(i.e. IRI only, or IRI and communication content), including between agencies.
### 14.2.6 IRI for GCSE based Communications
#### 14.2.6.1 General
The IRI will in principle be available in the following phases of a group
communications service transmission:
1) At a communications group creation, when a GCS AS communications group is
created that includes the target or when the target is added to an existing
communications group;
2) At the start of a group communications session to which the target is
connected;
3) At the point when the target joins an active group communications session;
4) When the target leaves an active group communications session;
5) At the end of a group communications session, when the GCS AS terminates a
group communications session;
6) At certain times when relevant information are available.
The IRI may be subdivided into the following categories:
1\. Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information);
**2.** Basic data communication information, for standard data transmission
between two parties.
The events defined in TS 33.107 [19] are used to generate records for the
delivery via HI2.
There are multiple different event types received at DF2 level. According to
each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF if this is required. The following
table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level and record
type sent to the LEMF.

transmit the information from mediation function to LEMF. This set of
information can be extended in the ICE or DF2 MF, if this is necessary in a
specific country. The following table gives the mapping between information

### 14.2.7 CC for GCSE based Communications
#### 14.2.7.1 General
The interface protocols and data structures defined in Annex B.14.2 contain
the ASN.1 for CC for GCSE. The data structure also allows for the reporting of
separate media streams for each user in the group communications.
## 14.3 GCS AS Outside Intercepting Operator Network
### 14.3.1 General
In the case where the GCS AS is outside the intercepting operator\'s network,
packet data interception capabilities can be used to intercept and report a
target\'s communication. Such interception is dependent on the network\'s
ability to identify the target. In general, for a target accessing the network
via LTE based unicast bearer as defined in TS 23.468 [84], the interception at
a S-GW and PDN-GW as defined in Clause 10 shall apply. This covers all
upstream communications from the target as well as any downstream
communications received in unicast mode. For a target that is receiving
downstream communications via the BM-SC in multicast mode, a solution is for
further study.
# 15 Interception of Messaging Services
## 15.1 Overview
The capabilities defined in this clause apply when the interception of
messaging services shall be separated from the interception of all other
services. This clause applies to the messaging services identified in Clause
5.13 of TS 33.106 [18].
For messaging services, separated delivery when SMS events are detected, the
CSP shall be able to use existing intercept capabilities defined in this
specification, but isolatable to only deliver messaging services when
specified by a lawful authorisation. TS 33.107 [19] defines the SMS events to
be reported. This clause will identify the set of event reports that are to be
sent from the DF to the LEMF to achieve this separated delivery based on
capabilities that already exist in the rest of this specification.
The network nodes, involved in providing the interception of messaging
services, shall be determined based on the deployment configuration and the
messaging scenario.
When lawfully authorized, Law Enforcement requires access to CC and IRI for
the events pertaining to the target\'s authorization, access to, and use of
message services, independent of the deployed service architecture. This
includes where the communications between the target and associates are sent
and received over separate channels, or may be accessed at different ICEs at
different geographical locations in the service provider\'s network.
## 15.2 SMS
### 15.2.1 Introduction
LI for SMS over a GPRS and UMTS access is specified in Clause 6. LI for SMS
over IMS (using IMS SIP signalling handled by the core network) which can be
used in conjunction with LTE access as well as other non-3GPP IP based access
is defined in Clause 7.
### 15.2.2 SMS over GPRS/UMTS
For separate delivery of SMS when SMS is used in conjunction with GPRS or UMTS
access, the following records shall be sent by DF2 to the LEMF:
1) SMS MO and SMS MT Communication REPORT Records (Clause 6.5.1.1).
2) HLR Related REPORT Records:
a. Serving System REPORT Record (6.5.1.1);
b. Cancel location REPORT Record (6.5.1.1);
c. Register location REPORT Record (6.5.1.1);
d. Location information request REPORT Record (6.5.1.1).
The above REPORT Records shall be reported from DF2 to the LEMF independent of
any other services that may or may not be intercepted.
### 15.2.3 SMS over IMS
For separate delivery of SMS when SMS over IMS (using IMS SIP signalling
handled by the core network) is used, the following REPORT Records shall be
reported by DF2 to the LEMF:
1) SMS over IP REPORT Record (see Table 15.2.3.1).
2) HSS related REPORT Records:
a. Serving System (6.5.1.1) or Serving Evolved Packet System (10.5.1.1) for
use when roaming
b. Registration termination or Cancel Location (6.1.1.1 or 10.5.1.1);
c. Register location REPORT Record (6.5.1.1 or 10.5.1.1);
d. Location information request REPORT Record (6.5.1.1. or 10.5.1.1).
The above REPORT Records shall be able to be reported from DF2 to the LEMF
independent of any other services that may or may not be intercepted.

## 15.3 MMS
### 15.3.1 Introduction
LI for Separated Delivery of MMS (see Clause 18.3 of [19]), the events of
Clause 18.3 need to be reported to the LEMF from DF2 and for CC from DF3,
respectively. A Report record shall be utilized to report the IRI events while
a CC shall be reported as described in this clause using a ULIC header.
The CC PDU contains the content of an MMS.
### 15.3.2 Identifiers
#### 15.3.2.1 Overview
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception
uniquely and to correlate IRI and CC, which is conveyed over the different
handover interfaces (HI2 and HI3). The identifiers are defined in the clauses
below.
For the delivery of CC, the MMS Proxy-Relay provides correlation numbers and
target identities to DF3. The MMS Proxy-Relay reports the IRI associated with
the MMS services.
For the delivery of CC and IRI, the MMS Proxy-Relay provides correlation
numbers and target identities to the DF2 and DF3. For a given target the
correlation number for a given MMS is unique across all MMS involving the
target.
#### 15.3.2.2 Lawful Interception Identifier
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized
operator (CSP) shall assign a Lawful Interception Identifier (LIID), which has
been agreed between the LEA and the operator (CSP). This shall be a LIID
specific to MMS interception, per national regulation.
Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it
easier to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the
authorized operator (CSP) and the handling agents at the LEA.
The LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records.
It shall be used within any information exchanged at the handover interfaces
HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for
example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference
number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized operator (CSP) shall either enter, based on an agreement with
each LEA, a unique LIID for each target identity of the target or a single
LIID for multiple target identities all pertaining to the same target.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be
unique LIIDs assigned relating to each LEA.
#### 15.3.2.3 Correlation Number
For a given target the Correlation Number is for a given MMS is unique across
all MMS involving the target and used for the following purpose:
\- correlate CC with IRI.
NOTE: The Correlation Number is at a minimum unique for each concurrent
communication of a target within a lawful authorization.
### 15.3.6 IRI for MMS
#### 15.3.6.1 General
The events defined in TS 33.107 [19] are used to generate records for the
delivery via HI2.
There are multiple different event types received at DF2 level. According to
each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF if this is required. The following
table gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level and record
type sent to the LEMF.

The Serving System and Serving Evolved Packet System events are reported as
per Clause 6.5.1.1 and 10.5.1.1, respectively, of the present document.
A set of information is used to generate the records. The records used
transmit the information from mediation function to LEMF. This set of
information can be extended in the ICE or DF2 MF, if this is necessary in a
specific country. The following table gives the mapping between information
received per event and information sent in records.

#### 15.3.6.2 Events and Event Information
##### 15.3.6.2.1 Overview
This clause describes the information sent from the Delivery Function (DF) to
the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) to support Lawful Interception
(LI). The information is described as records and information carried by a
record. This focus is on describing the information being transferred to the
LEMF.
The IRI events and data are encoded into records as defined in the Table
15.3.6.1.1 Mapping between MMS Events and HI2 records type and Annex B.15
Intercept related information (HI2). IRI is described in terms of a \'causing
event\' and information associated with that event. Within each IRI record
there is a set of events and associated information elements to support the
particular service.
The communication events described in Table 15.3.6.1.1: Mapping between MMS
Events and HI2 record type and Table 15.3.6.1.2: Mapping between Events
information and IRI information convey the basic information for reporting the
disposition of a communication. This clause describes those events and
supporting information.
Each record described in this clause consists of a set of parameters. Each
parameter is either:
\- mandatory (M) required for the record,
\- conditional (C) required in situations where a condition is met (the
condition is given in the Description), or
\- optional (O) provided at the discretion of the implementation.
The information to be carried by each parameter is identified. Both optional
and conditional parameters are considered to be OPTIONAL syntactically in
ASN.1 Stage 3 descriptions. The Stage 2 inclusion takes precedence over Stage
3 syntax.
##### 15.3.6.2.2 REPORT record information
The REPORT record is used to convey the events of MMS service interception.
The REPORT record shall be triggered when:
\- the target sends a MMS;
\- the target receives a notification of an incoming MMS;
\- the target responds to the notification of an incoming MMS;
\- an MMS is retrieved by the target;
\- the target acknowledges to the retrieved MMS;
\- the target forwards an MMS;
\- the target stores an MMS in the Mmbox;
\- the target uploads an MMS to the Mmbox;
\- the target deletes a MMS stored in the Mmbox;
\- the target receives a MMS Delivery report;
\- the target sends a MMS Read Reply;
\- the target receives a MMS Read Reply;
\- the target receives a MMS cancel request;
\- the target sends a MMbox view request;
\- the target receives a confirmation of a sent MMbox View request.

# 16 Cell Site Reporting
## 16.1 Overview
When a Cell Site Identity is provided in an IRI event, the CSP may provide the
specific Cell Site Supplemental Information records from their Cell Site
database. This information should be placed in the events location parameter
if the IRI message is still available in the MF before its delivery or use a
separate Cell Site Report (CSR) capability as described in TS 33.107 [19]
Clause 22 Cell Site Supplemental Information Reporting. If the Cell Site
Supplemental information for a Cell Site Identity has already been sent for an
intercept and it has not changed, the CSP is not required to send the record
again.
## 16.2 LI_CELL_INFO Interface
The LI_CELL_INFO interface, as identified in its configuration in [19] clause
4 figure 1m, is used by the MF to access a CSP cell site database(s) that have
additional Cell Site Supplemental Information. The MF will query or the MF
will be provided from/to the CSP database any supplemental information for a
Cell Site Identity across this LI_CELL_INFO interface and shall place this
information into the Location parameter of the IRI event, however, if this IRI
event is not available in the MF, the MF shall have the ability to create a
CSR to be delivered to the LEMF.
## 16.3 Cell Site Reporting in IRI event
If an IRI event Record from the network contains a Cell Site Identity (e.g.
Cell Global Identifier), the MF should enrich the IRI Record with Cell Site
Supplemental Information retrieved from the CSP\'s Cell Site Database prior to
delivery of the IRI to the LEMF. The parameters as shown in Table 16.1 shall
be included within the location parameter. However, if the MF cannot insert
this information without undue delay into the IRI event Record, the MF should
create and deliver a separate CSR as shown in 16.4 Table 16.2.

# 17 Interception of PTC
## 17.1 Capabilities when the PTC service is supported by a CSP
### 17.1.0 Introduction
The capabilities defined in this clause apply when the Push to Talk over
Cellular (PTC) service is supported by a CSP. The term PTC, when used in the
present document, represents either a Push to talk Over Cellular (PoC) or
Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) type service. PoC and MCPTT, which use
similar architectures for service delivery, shall be intercepted and delivered
separated from the interception of all other services for LI purposes.
This clause applies to the PTC services identified in Clause 21 of TS 33.107
[19].
When PTC events are detected the CSP shall be able to use existing intercept
capabilities defined in this specification but isolatable to only deliver PTC
events when specified by a lawful authorization. TS 33.107 [19] defines the
PTC events to be reported. This clause will identify the set of event Records
that are to be sent from the DF to the LEMF based on capabilities that already
exist in this specification.
The network nodes, involved in providing the interception of PTC services,
shall be determined based on the deployment configuration and the particular
PTC type service scenarios.
When lawfully authorized, Law Enforcement requires access to CC and IRI for
the events pertaining to the target\'s authorization, access to, and use of
PTC services, independent of the deployed service architecture. This includes
where the communications between the target and associates are sent and
received over separate channels, or may be accessed at different Intercept
Control Elements (ICE) at different geographical locations in the service
provider\'s network.
### 17.1.1 Lawful interception identifier
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized
CSP shall assign a special Lawful Interception Identifier (LIID), which has
been agreed between the LEA and the CSP.
Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it
easier to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the
authorized CSP and the handling agents at the LEA.
The LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records.
It shall be used within any information exchanged at the handover interfaces
HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation purposes.
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for
example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference
number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued.
The authorized CSP shall either enter a unique LIID for each target identity
of the target or a single LIID for multiple target identities all pertaining
to the same target.
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be
unique LIIDs assigned relating to each LEA.
### 17.1.2 Network identifier
The network identifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be
internationally unique. It consists of the following two identifiers.
1) CSP identifier (mandatory):\ Unique identification of the CSP.
2) Network Element IDentifier NEID (mandatory):\ The purpose of the network
element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element
carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending,
etc.
A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier.
### 17.1.3 PTC IRI Events
Intercept Related Information (IRI) events are necessary at the PTC Mobile
Station Attach, PTC Mobile Station Detach, PTC session Activation, Start of
intercept with PTC context active, PTC Context Deactivation, PTC Serving
System, and other PTC events that are defined in this clause.
TS 33.107 [19] Figure 21.1.1 shows the transfer of intercept related
information to the DF2. If an event for / from a PTC MS occurs, the Shared
XDMS/PTC common core servers or the Home Subscriber Service (HSS) sends the
relevant data to the DF2 for delivery to the LEA.
The following report records shall be mapped to appropriate records that are
sent by DF2 to the LEMF:
\- PTC IRI defined events as applicable to both PoC and MCPTT service as
defined in [19] (21.3.3.1).
\- In addition, this clause also specifies IRI reporting from the HSS handling
subscriber data. Target identities to be used for interception of IRI at the
HSS are specified in TS 33.107 [19]:
\- Serving System;
\- Cancel location;
\- Register location;
\- Location information request.
\- The following events are applicable to the SIP Core:
\- Service Registration
The above REPORT Records and those in clause 17.2 shall be reported from DF2
to the LEMF independent of any other services that may or may not be
intercepted.
### 17.1.4 CC for PTC-based VoIP
The CSP shall report Communication Content (CC) for all talk burst in a
target\'s PTC session, when authorized. The CC ICE has to intercept all PTC
session content (i.e., talk burst) between the PTC LI target and associate(s)
and deliver the PTC session content to the LEMF. The CSP shall deliver CC for
the duration of all of the different types of PTC sessions (e.g. Pre-arranged
PTC group, PTC Chat group, One-to-One, and other type group calls) that are
originated by or terminated at the PTC target\'s MS, facilities, or service
when authorized. PTC communications are based on SIP/IP signalling within the
CSP core and PTC client as per [97]. The PTC CC shall use the provisions in
B.12 Contents of Communication (HI3 IMS-based VoIP) to provide PTC CC to the
LEMF.
Annex B.12 provides the definitions of the data structures to be used for the
delivery of CC for IMS-based VoIP (see Annex K for the detailed description).
The Correlation Number received from the CC Intercept Triggering Function
shall be used in the CC Data sent over the HI3.
### 17.1.5 IRI for PTC based Communications
The IRI event information sent to the DF2/DF3 is triggered by different PTC
session related and non-call related events/reports. A set of information is
used to generate the IRI records. The records used transmit the information
from mediation function to LEMF. The following table gives the mapping between
information received per event or report and information sent in records.

### 17.2.2 PTC Start of Interception
The PTC Start of Interception Begin Record shall be reported by the MF/DF to
the LEMF for two separate conditions. The first reporting of a PTC Start of
Interception Begin Record is for a PTC session that has been initiated but has
not been established, either from/to the target. The second conditional
reporting of a PTC Start of Interception Begin Record shall be reported when
LI is first started and the PTC target has at least one PTC Session active in
progress. If multiple PTC Sessions are active at the start of the
interception, a PTC Start of Interception Record is generated for each active
PTC Session and sent to the LEMF. The PTC Start of Interception Begin Record
is not reported for an Instant Personal Alert type of PTC Session.

### 17.2.14 PTC Floor Control
Floor Control arbitrates requests from the PTC Clients for the right to send
media (i.e. the right to speak). Note, the term \"Floor Control\" is used to
mean the same as the term \"Talk Burst Control\". Talk Burst Control Protocol
[TBCP] is a protocol for performing floor control and these aspects are
defined in (OMA-PoC-AD [97]) and [OMA-PoC-UP [98]). When the PTC target is
participating in a PTC Session, a Floor Control event Continue Record shall be
sent from the MF/DF to the LEMF when the target requests to speak (e.g.
presses the PTC mechanism) or the target is given permission to speak in
response to a request (e.g. the network responds positively to the PTC
Subscriber\'s request) or is refused the request to speak and when the target
is finished speaking (e.g. the PTC Intercept target releases the PTC
mechanism).
When the PTC target is participating in a PTC Session, a Floor Control
Continue Record is triggered when:
\- The PTC target request to speak is received (e.g. when the PTC Intercept
target presses the Push To Talk (PTT)).
\- The PTC target is given permission to speak in response to a request (e.g.
the network responds positively to the PTC Subscriber\'s request).
\- The PTC target who initiates a PTC session is given permission to speak
automatically when the PTC session starts (i.e., if the service allows the
initiating PTC participant the floor automatically and there is no request).
\- The PTC target\'s request to speak is refused (e.g. the network responds
negatively to the PTC Subscriber\'s request).
\- The PTC target request to release the floor control is received (e.g. when
the PTC target releases the PTT).
\- The service revokes the PTC target\'s permission to speak (e.g. network
response, possibly to time out or host\'s instructions).
\- The floor becomes idle (i.e., no one has requested nor has permission to
speak).
\- An associate (i.e., another member of the PTC Session other than the PTC
target) is given permission to speak and the PTC target\'s service is aware of
the request.
\- The PTC target cancels the request to speak.
\- The PTC target\'s request to speak is queued.
\- The PTC target\'s query to determine their position in the floor-control-
request queue is received.
\- The position of the PTC target\'s request in the queue is changed due to
differing priority levels in the queue (OMA-PoC-AD [97]).
\- The PTC target\'s request to speak is de-queued and permission to speak is
granted (i.e., when the request for permission to speak was previously
queued).
\- When the PTC associate\'s request permission to speak is queued or de-
queued (i.e., permission to speak is granted) and the PTC target\'s service is
aware of the event.

###### ## Annex A (normative): HI2 delivery mechanisms and procedures
# A.0 Introduction
There are two possible methods for delivery of IRI to the LEMF standardized in
this document:
a) FTP.
b) ETSI TS 102 232-1 [104] and ETSI TS 102 232-7 [105].
The present document recommends that option b) is used.
# A.1 Void
# A.2 FTP
## A.2.1 Introduction
At HI2 interface FTP is used over internet protocol stack for the delivery of
the IRI. The FTP is defined in IETF STD 9 [13]. The IP is defined in IETF
STD0005 [15]. The TCP is defined in IETF STD0007 [16].
FTP supports reliable delivery of data. The data may be temporarily buffered
in the mediation function (MF) in case of link failure. FTP is independent of
the payload data it carries.
## A.2.2 Usage of the FTP
The MF acts as the FTP client and the LEMF acts as the FTP server . The client
pushes the data to the server.
The receiving node LEMF stores the received data as files. The MF may buffer
files.
Several records may be gathered into bigger packages prior to sending, to
increase bandwidth efficiency.
The following configurable intercept data collection (= transfer package
closing / file change) threshold parameters should be supported:
\- frequency of transfer, based on send timeout, e.g. X ms;
\- frequency of transfer, based on volume trigger, e.g. X octets.
Every file shall contain only complete IRI records. The single IRI record
shall not be divided into several files.
There are two possible ways as to how the interception data may be sent from
the MF to the LEMF. One way is to produce files that contain interception data
only for one observed target (see: \"File naming method A)\"). The other way
is to multiplex all the intercepted data that MF receives to the same sequence
of general purpose interception files sent by the MF (see: \"File naming
method B)\").
**[File naming:]{.underline}**
The names for the files transferred to a LEA are formed according to one of
the 2 available formats, depending on the delivery file strategy chosen (e.g.
due to national convention or operator preference).
Either each file contains data of only one observed target (as in method A) or
several targets\' data is put to files common to all observed target traffic
through MF (as in method B).
The maximum set of allowed characters in interception file names are
\"a\"...\"z\", \"A\"...\"Z\", \"-\", \"_\", \".\", and decimals \"0\"...\"9\".
**[File naming method A):]{.underline}**
\_\.\
**LIID** = See clause 7.1.
**seq** = integer ranging between [0..2\^64-1], in ASCII form (not exceeding
20 ASCII digits), identifying the sequence number for file transfer from this
node per a specific target.
**ext** = ASCII integer ranging between [\"1\"..\"8\"] (in hex: 31H...38H),
identifying the file type. The possible file types are shown in table A.1.
Type \"1\" is reserved for IRI data files and type \"8\" is reserved for data
files according to a national requirement by using the same file naming
concept.
Table A.1: Possible file types
* * *
File types that the LEA may get Intercepted data types \"1\" (in binary: 0011
0001) IRI / as option HI1 notifications \"2\" (in binary: 0011 0010) CC (MO)
(see clause C.2.2) \"4\" (in binary: 0011 0100) CC (MT) (see clause C.2.2)
\"6\" (in binary: 0011 0110) CC (MO&MT) (see clause C.2.2) \"7\" (in binary:
0011 0111) IRI + CC (MO&MT) (see clause C.2.2) \"8\" (in binary: 0011 1000)
for national use
* * *
This alternative A is used when each target\'s IRI is gathered per observed
target to dedicated delivery files. This method provides the result of
interception in a very refined form to the LEAs, but requires somewhat more
resources in the MF than alternative B. With this method, the data sorting and
interpretation tasks of the LEMF are considerably easier to facilitate in near
real time than in alternative B.
**[File naming method B):]{.underline}**
The other choice is to use monolithic fixed format file names (with no
trailing file type part in the file name):
\ (e.g. ABXY00041014084400001)
where:
ABXY = Source node identifier part, used for all files by the mobile network
operator \"AB\" from this MF node named \"XY\".
> 00 = year 2000
>
> 04 = month April
>
> 10= day 10
>
> 14 = hour
>
> 08 = minutes
>
> 44 = seconds
>
> 0000 = extension
>
> ext = file type. The type \"1\" is reserved for IRI data files and type
> \"8\" is reserved for national use. (Codings \"2\" = CC(MO), \"4\" = CC(MT),
> \"6\" = CC(MO&MT) are reserved for HI3).
This alternative B is used when several targets\' intercepted data is gathered
to common delivery files. This method does not provide the result of
interception in as refined form to the LEAs as the alternative A, but it is
faster in performance for the MF point of view. With this method, the MF does
not need to keep many files open like in alternative A.
### A.2.3 Profiles (informative)
As there are several ways (usage profiles) how data transfer can be arranged
by using the FTP, this chapter contains practical considerations how the
communications can be set up. Guidance is given for client-server
arrangements, session establishments, time outs, the handling of the files (in
RAM or disk). Example batch file is described for the case that the sending
FTP client uses files. If instead (logical) files are sent directly from the
client\'s RAM memory, then the procedure can be in principle similar though no
script file would then be needed.
At the LEMF side, FTP server process is run, and at MF, FTP client. No FTP
server (which could be accessed from outside the operator network) shall run
in the MF. The FTP client can be implemented in many ways, and here the FTP
usage is presented with an example only. The FTP client can be implemented by
a batch file or a file sender program that uses FTP via an API. The login
needs to occur only once per e.g. \ & \ -pair. Once the
login is done, the files can then be transferred just by repeating \'mput\'
command and checking the transfer status (e.g. from the API routine return
value). To prevent inactivity timer triggering, a dummy command (e.g. \'pwd\')
can be sent every T seconds (T should be less than L, the actual idle time
limit). If the number of FTP connections is wanted to be as minimised as
possible, the FTP file transfer method \"B\" is to be preferred to the method
A (though the method A helps more the LEMF by pre-sorting the data sent).
_Simple example of a batch file extract:_
FTP commands usage scenario for transferring a list of files:
To prevent FTP cmd line buffer overflow the best way is to use wild-carded
file names, and let the FTP implementation do the file name expansion (instead
of shell). The number of files for one mput is not limited this way:
ftp \ \
user \ \
cd \
lcd \
bin
mput \
nlist \ \
close
EOF
This set of commands opens an FTP connection to a LEA site, logs in with a
given account (auto-login is disabled), transfers a list of files in binary
mode, and checks the transfer status in a simplified way.
Brief descriptions for the FTP commands used in the example:
> user \ \ Identify the client to the remote FTP server.
>
> cd \ Change the working directory on the remote machine to
> remote-directory.
>
> lcd \ Change the working directory on the local machine.
>
> bin Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer.
>
> mput \ Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as
> arguments and do a put for each file in the resulting list. Store each local
> file on the remote machine.
>
> nlist \ \ Print a list of the files in a
> directory on the remote machine. Send the output to local-file.
>
> close Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return to the
> command interpreter. Any defined macros are erased.
The parameters are as follows:
**\ ** contains the FTP command options, e.g. \"-i -n -V -p\" which
equals to \'interactive prompting off\', \'auto-login disabled\', \'verbose
mode disabled\', and \'passive mode enabled\'. (These are dependent on the
used ftp- version.)
**\ ** contains the IP address or DNS address of the destination
(LEA).
**\ ** contains the receiving (LEA) username.
**\ ** contains the receiving (LEA) user\'s password.
**\ ** contains the destination path.
**\ ** contains the source path.
**\ ** wildcarded file specification (matching the files to be
transferred).
**\ ** the name of the last file to be transferred.
**\ ** is a (local) file to be checked upon transfer completion; if
it exists then the transfer is considered successful.
The FTP application should to do the following things if the checkfile is not
found:
\- keep the failed files.
\- raise \'file transfer failure\' error condition (i.e. send alarm to the
corresponding LEA).
\- the data can be buffered for a time that the buffer size allows. If that
would finally be exhausted, DF would start dropping the corresponding
target\'s data until the transfer failure is fixed.
\- the transmission of the failed files is retried until the transfer
eventually succeeds. Then the DF would again start collecting the data.
\- upon successful file transfer the sent files are deleted from the DF.
The FTP server at LEMF shall not allow anonymous login of an FTP client.
It is required that FTP implementation guarantees that LEMF will start
processing data only after data transfer is complete.
The following implementation example addresses a particular issue of FTP
implementation. It is important however to highlight that there are multiple
ways of addressing the problem in question, and therefore the given example
does not in any way suggest being the default one.
MF sends data with a filename, which indicates that the file is temporary.
Once data transfer is complete, MF renames temporary file into ordinary one
(as defined in C.2.2).
The procedure for renaming filename should be as follow:
1) open FTP channel (if not already open) from MF to LEMF;
2) sends data to LEMF using command \"put\" with temporary filename;
3) after MF finished to send the file, renaming it as ordinary one with
command \"ren\".
Brief descriptions for the FTP commands used in the example:
ren \ \ renaming filename from-name to to-name.
If the ftp-client want to send file to LEMF using the command \"mput\" (e.g.
MF stored many IRI files and want to send all together with one command),
every filename transferred successfully has to be renamed each after command
\"mput\" ended.
### A.2.4 File content
The file content is in method A relating to only one target.
In the file transfer method B, the file content may relate to any targets
whose intercept records are sent to the particular LEMF address.
Individual IRI records shall not be fragmented into separate files at the FTP
layer.
### A.2.5 Exceptional procedures
Overflow at the receiving end (LEMF) is avoided due to the nature of the
protocol.
In case the transit network or receiving end system (LEMF) is down for a
reasonably short time period, the local buffering at the MF will be sufficient
as a delivery reliability backup procedure.
In case the transit network or receiving end system (LEMF) is down for a very
long period, the local buffering at the MF may have to be terminated. Then the
following intercepted data coming from the intercepting nodes to the MF would
be discarded, until the transit network or LEMF is up and running again.
### A.2.6 Other considerations
The FTP protocol mode parameters used:
> Transmission Mode: stream
>
> Format: non-print
>
> Structure: file-structure
>
> Type: binary
The FTP client (=user -FTP process at the MF) uses e.g. the default standard
FTP ports 20 (for data connection) and 21 (for control connection),
\'passive\' mode is supported. The data transfer process listens to the data
port for a connection from a server-FTP process.
For the file transfer from the MF to the LEMF(s) e.g. the following data
transfer parameters are provided for the FTP client (at the MF):
\- transfer destination (IP) address, e.g. \"194.89.205.4\";
\- transfer destination username, e.g. \"LEA1\";
\- transfer destination directory path, e.g. \"/usr/local/LEA1/1234-8291\";
\- transfer destination password;
\- interception file type, \"1\" (this is needed only if the file naming
method A is used).
LEMF may use various kind directory structures for the reception of
interception files. It is strongly recommended that at the LEMF machine the
structure and access and modification rights of the storage directories are
adjusted to prevent unwanted directory operations by a FTP client.
**[Timing considerations for the HI2 FTP transmission]{.underline}**
The MF and LEMF sides control the timers to ensure reliable, near-real time
data transfer. The transmission related timers are defined within the lower
layers of the used protocol and are out of scope of this document.
The following timers may be used within the LI application:
Table A.2: Timing considerations
* * *
Name Controlled by Units Description T1 inactivity timer LEMF Seconds
Triggered by no activity within the FTP session (no new files). The FTP
session is torn down when the T1 expires. To send another file the new
connection will be established. The timer avoids the FTP session overflow at
the LEMF side. T2 send file trigger MF Milliseconds Forces the file to be
transmitted to the LEMF (even if the size limit has not been reached yet in
case of volume trigger active). If the timer is set to 0 the only trigger to
send the file is the file size parameter (See C.2.2).

# A.3 ETSI TS 102 232-1 and ETSI TS 102 232-7
## A.3.1 General
Functions having an HI2 interface may support the use of ETSI TS 102 232-1
[104] and ETSI TS 102 232-7 [105] to realise the interface.
In the event of a conflict between either specification and the present
document, the terms of the present document shall apply.
## A.3.2 Usage for realising HI2
The IRI messages sent over HI2 are structured as a header and a payload. The
header contains general information like LIID, timestamp, correlation
information (as for example defined in ETSI TS 102 232-1 [104]). The payload
contains intercept related information based on information that the MF has
received from sources in the network. Messages defined as passing over the HI2
interface shall be passed as described in ETSI TS 102 232-7 [105] clauses 5
and 6.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Structure of data at the handover interface
# B.0 Introduction
This annex specifies the coding details at the handover interface HI for all
data, which may be sent from the operator\'s (NO/AN/SP) equipment to the LEMF,
across HI.
At the HI2 and HI3 handover interface ports, the following data may be
present:
\- interface port HI2: IRI;
\- interface port HI3: records containing CC.
The detailed coding specification for these types of information is contained
in this annex, including sufficient details for a consistent implementation in
the operator\'s (NO/AN/SP) equipment and the LEMF.
# B.1 Syntax definitions
The transferred information and messages are encoded to be binary compatible
with [5] (Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)) and [6] (Basic Encoding Rules
(BER)).
These recommendations use precise definitions of the words _type_ , _class_ ,
_value_ , and _parameter_. Those definitions are paraphrased below for
clarity.
A _type,_ in the context of the abstract syntax or transfer syntax, is a set
of all possible values. For example, an INTEGER is a type for all negative and
positive integers.
A _class_ , in the context of the abstract syntax or transfer syntax, is a one
of four possible domains for uniquely defining a type. The classes defined by
ASN.1 and BER are: UNIVERSAL, APPLICATION, CONTEXT, and PRIVATE.
The UNIVERSAL class is reserved for international standards such as [5] and
[6]. Users of the protocol may extend the syntax with PRIVATE class parameters
without conflict with the present document, but risk conflict with other
users\' extensions. APPLICATION class parameters are reserved for future
extensions.
A _value_ is a particular instance of a type. For example, five (5) is a
possible value of the type INTEGER.
A _parameter_ in the present document is a particular instance of the transfer
syntax to transport a value consisting of a tag to identify the parameter
type, a length to specify the number of octets in the value, and the value.
In the BER a _tag_ (a particular type and class identifier) may either be a
primitive or a constructor. A _primitive_ is a pre-defined type (of class
UNIVERSAL) and a _constructor_ consists of other types (primitives or other
constructors). A constructor type may either be IMPLICIT or EXPLICIT. An
IMPLICIT type is encoded with the constructor identifier alone. Both ends of a
communication have to understand the underlying structure of the IMPLICIT
types. EXPLICIT types are encoded with the identifiers of all the contained
types. For example, an IMPLICIT Number of type INTEGER would be tagged only
with the _Number_ tag, where an EXPLICIT number of type INTEGER would have the
_INTEGER_ tag within the _Number_ tag. The present document uses IMPLICIT
tagging for more compact message encoding.
For the coding of the value part of each parameter the general rule is to use
a widely use a standardized format when it exists (ISUP, DSS1, MAP, etc.).
As a large part of the information exchanged between the user\'s may be
transmitted within ISUP/DSS1 signalling, the using of the coding defined for
this signalling guarantee the integrity of the information provided to the
LEMF and the evolution of the interface. For example if new values are used
within existing ISUP parameters, this new values shall be transmitted
transparently toward the LEMF.
For the ASN.1 parameters of the type \'OCTET STRING\', the ordering of the
individual halfoctets of each octet shall be such that the most significant
nibble is put into bitposition 5 ‑ 8 and the least significant nibble into
bitposition 1 ‑ 4. This general rule shall not apply when parameter formats
are imported from other standards, e.g. an E.164 number coded according to
ISUP, ITU‑T Recommendation Q.763 [29]. In this case the ordering of the
nibbles shall be according to that standard and not be changed.

###### ## *** *__Annex C (normative):_ _UMTS and EPS HI3 interfaces
# C.0 Introduction
There are three possible methods for delivery of content of communication to
the LEMF standardized in this document:
a) UMTS/EPS LI Correlation Header (ULIC) and UDP/TCP
b) FTP
c) ETSI TS 102 232-1 [104] and ETSI TS 102 232-7 [105]
The present document recommends that option c) is used.
Two versions of ULIC are defined for UMTS PS interception: version 0 and
version 1.
ULICv1 shall be supported by the network and, optionally, ULICv0 may be
supported by the network. When both are supported, ULICv1 is the default
value.
ULIC version 0 is not specified for EPS.
# C.1 UMTS LI correlation header
## C.1.1 Introduction
The header and the payload of the communication between the target and the
other party (later called: Payload Information Element) is duplicated. A new
header (later called: ULIC-Header) is added before it is sent to LEMF.
Data packets with the ULIC header shall be sent to the LEA via UDP/IP or
TCP/IP.
## C.1.2 Definition of ULIC header version 0
ULIC header contains the following attributes:
\- Correlation Number.
\- Message Type (a value of 255 is used for HI3-PDUs).
\- Direction.
\- Sequence Number.
\- Length.
\- Intercepting Control Element (ICE) type.
T-PDU contains the intercepted information.

Figure C.1: Outline of ULIC header
For interception tunneling the ULIC header shall be used as follows:
\- Version shall be set to 0 to indicate the first version of ULIC header.
\- DIR indicates the direction of the T-PDU:
\"1\" indicating uplink (from observed mobile user); and
\"0\" indicating downlink (to observed mobile user).
\- Message Type shall be set to 255 (the unique value that is used for T-PDU
within GTP TS 29.060 [17]).
\- Length shall be the length, in octets, of the signalling message excluding
the ULIC header. Bit 8 of octet 3 is the most significant bit and bit 1 of
octet 4 is the least significant bit of the length field.
\- Sequence Number is an increasing sequence number for tunneled T-PDUs. Bit 8
of octet 5 is the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet 6 is the least
significant bit of the sequence number field.
NOTE: When a handoff occurs between SGSNs, the DF3 serving the LEA may change.
If the DF3 serving an LEA changes as a result of an handoff between SGSNs,
contiguous sequencing may not occur as new sequencing may be initiated at the
new DF3. Accordingly, the LEA should not assume that sequencing shall be
contiguous when handoff occurs between SGSNs and the DF3 serving the LEA
changes.
\- Correlation Number consists of two parts: GGSN-ID identifies the GGSN which
creates the Charging-ID.
Charging-ID is defined in TS 29.060 [17] and assigned uniquely to each PDP
context activation on that GGSN (4 octets).
The correlation number consist of 8 octets. The requirements for this
correlation number are similar to that defined for charging in TS 29.060 [17].
Therefore it is proposed to use the Charging-ID, defined in TS 29.060 [17] as
part of correlation number. The Charging-ID is signalled to the new SGSN in
case of SGSN-change so the tunnel identifier could be used \"seamlessly\" for
the HI3 interface.

This parameter is needed only in case the GGSN and the SGSN use the same

Communication.

## C.1.3 Definition of ULIC header version 1
ULIC-header version 1 is defined in ASN.1 [5] (see annex B.4 for UMTS PS
interception and annex B.10 for EPS interception) and is encoded according to
BER [6]. It contains the following attributes:
\- Object Identifier (hi3DomainId)
\- ULIC header ASN.1 version (version).
NOTE: ULIC header ASN.1 version (version) is not used for EPS interception.
\- lawful interception identifier (lIID, optional)\ sending of lawful
interception identifier is application dependant; it is done according to
national requirements.
\- correlation number (correlation-Number). As defined in clause 6.1.3 for
UMTS PS and clause 10.1.3 for EPS.
\- time stamp (timeStamp, optional),\ sending of time stamp is application
dependant; it is done according to national requirements.
\- sequence number (sequence-number). Sequence Number is an increasing
sequence number for tunneled T-PDUs. Handling of sequence number is
application dependent; it is done according to national requirements (e.g.
unique sequence number per PDP-context).
NOTE: When a handoff occurs between SGSNs or other Core Network nodes, the DF3
serving the LEA may change. If the DF3 serving an LEA changes as a result of
an handoff between SGSNs or other Core Network nodes, contiguous sequencing
may not occur as new sequencing may be initiated at the new DF3. Accordingly,
the LEA should not assume that sequencing shall be contiguous when handoff
occurs between SGSNs or other Core Network nodes and the DF3 serving the LEA
changes.
\- TPDU direction (t-PDU-direction)\ indicates the direction of the T-PDU
(from the target or to the target).
\- National parameters (nationalParameters, optional)\ this parameter is
encoded according to national requirements
\- ICE type (ice-type, optional)\ indicates in which node the T-PDU was
intercepted. This parameter is needed only in case several Core Network nodes
use the same Delivery Function/Mediation Function for the delivery of Content
of Communication.
The ULIC header is followed by a subsequent payload information element. Only
one payload information element is allowed in a single ULIC message (see annex
B.4 for UMTS PS interception and annex B.10 for EPS interception).
The payload information element contains the header and the payload of the
communication between the target and the other party.
## C.1.4 Exceptional procedure
With ULIC over UDP: the delivering node doesn\'t take care about any problems
at LEMF.
With ULIC over TCP: TCP tries to establish a connection to LEMF and resending
(buffering in the sending node) of packets is also supported by TCP.
In both cases it might happen that content of communication gets lost (in case
the LEMF or the transit network between MF and LEMF is down for a long time).
## C.1.5 Other considerations
The use of IPsec for this interface is recommended.
The required functions in LEMF are:
\- Collecting and storing of the incoming packets inline with the sequence
numbers.
\- Correlating of CC to IRI with the use of the correlation number in the ULIC
header.
# C.2 FTP
## C.2.1 Introduction
At HI3 interface FTP is used over the internet protocol stack for the delivery
of the result of interception. FTP is defined in IETF STD 9 [13]. The IP is
defined in IETF STD0005 [15]. The TCP is defined in IETF STD0007 [16].
FTP supports reliable delivery of data. The data may be temporarily buffered
in the sending node (MF) in case of link failure. FTP is independent of the
payload data it carries.
## C.2.2 Usage of the FTP
In the packet data LI the MF acts as the FTP client and the receiving node
(LEMF) acts as the FTP server . The client pushes the data to the server.
The receiving node LEMF stores the received data as files. The sending entity
(MF) may buffer files.
Several smaller intercepted data units may be gathered to bigger packages
prior to sending, to increase bandwidth efficiency.
The following configurable intercept data collection (= transfer package
closing / file change) threshold parameters should be supported:
\- frequency of transfer, based on send timeout, e.g. X ms.
\- frequency of transfer, based on volume trigger, e.g. X octets.
There are two possible ways how the interception data may be sent from the MF
to the LEMF. One way is to produce files that contain interception data only
for one observed target (see: \"File naming method A)\"). The other way is to
multiplex all the intercepted data that MF receives to the same sequence of
general purpose interception files sent by the MF (see: \"File naming method
B)\").
The HI2 and HI3 are logically different interfaces, even though in some
installations the HI2 and HI3 packet streams might also be delivered via a
common transmission path from a MF to a LEMF. It is possible to correlate HI2
and HI3 packet streams by having common (referencing) data fields embedded in
the IRI and the CC packet streams.
**File naming:**
The names for the files transferred to a LEA are formed according to one of
the 2 available formats, depending on the delivery file strategy chosen (e.g.
due to national convention or operator preference).
Either each file contains data of only one observed target (as in method A) or
several targets\' data is put to files common to all observed target traffic
through a particular MF node (as in method B).
The maximum set of allowed characters in interception file names are
\"a\"...\"z\", \"A\"...\"Z\", \"-\", \"_\", \".\", and decimals \"0\"...\"9\".
**[File naming method A):]{.underline}**
\_\.\
**LIID** = See clause 7.1.
**seq** = integer ranging between [0..2\^64-1], in ASCII form (not exceeding
20 ASCII digits), identifying the sequence number for file transfer from this
node per a specific target.
**ext** = ASCII integer ranging between [\"1\"..\"8\"] (in hex: 31H...38H),
identifying the file type. The possible file type codings for intercepted data
are shown in table C.1. The types \"2\", \"4\", and \"6\" are reserved for the
HI3 interface and type \"8\" is reserved for data files according to a
national requirement by using the same file naming concept.
Table C.1: Possible file types
* * *
File types that the LEA may get Intercepted data types \"1\" (in binary: 0011
0001) IRI / as option HI1 notifications (see annex A.2.2) \"2\" (in binary:
0011 0010) CC(MO) \"4\" (in binary: 0011 0100) CC(MT) \"6\" (in binary: 0011
0110) CC(MO&MT) \"7\" (in binary 0011 0111) IRI + CC(MO&MT) \"8\" (in binary:
0011 1000) for national use
* * *
The least significant bit that is \'1\' in file type 1, is reserved for
indicating IRI data and may be used for indicating that the HI2 and HI3 packet
streams are delivered via a common transmission path from a MF to a LEMF.
The bit 2 of the **ext** tells whether the CC(MO) is included in the
intercepted data.
The bit 3 of the **ext** tells whether the CC(MT) is included in the
intercepted data.
The bit 4 of the **ext** tells whether the intercepted data is according to a
national requirement.
Thus, for CC(MO) data, the file type is \"2\", for CC(MT) data \"4\", for
CC(MO&MT) data \"6\" and for \"national use\" data the file type is \"8\".
When HI2 and HI3 packet streams are delivered via a common transmission path
from a MF to a LEMF, then the file type is \"7\", that indicates the presence
of both the IRI and the CC(MO&MT) data.
This alternative A is used when each target\'s intercepted data is gathered
per observed target to dedicated delivery files. This method provides the
result of interception in a very refined form to the LEAs, but requires
somewhat more resources in the sending node than alternative B. With this
method, the data sorting and interpretation tasks of the LEMF are considerably
easier to facilitate in near real time than in alternative B.
**[File naming method B):]{.underline}**
The other choice is to use monolithic fixed format file names (with no
trailing file type part in the file name):
\ (e.g. ABXY00041014084400006)
where:
ABXY = Source node identifier part, used for all files by the mobile network
operator \"AB\" from this MF node named \"XY\".
00 = year 2000
04= month April
10= day 10
14 = hour
08 = minutes
44= seconds
0000 = extension
ext = file type. Coding: \"2\" = CC(MO), \"4\" = CC(MT), \"6\" = CC(MO&MT),
\"8\" = national use. The type \"1\" is reserved for IRI data files and may be
used for indicating that the HI2 and HI3 packet streams are delivered via a
common transmission path from a MF to a LEMF. In such a case, the file type is
\"7\", that indicates the presence of both the IRI and the CC(MO&MT) data.
This alternative B is used when several targets\' intercepted data is gathered
to common delivery files. This method does not provide the result of
interception in as refined form to the LEAs as the alternative A, but it is
faster in performance for the MF point of view. With this method, the MF does
not need to keep many files open like in alternative A.
## C.2.3 Exceptional procedures
Overflow at the receiving end (LEMF) is avoided due to the nature of the
protocol.
In case the transit network or receiving end system (LEMF) is down for a
reasonably short time period, the local buffering at the MF will be sufficient
as a delivery reliability backup procedure.
In case the transit network or receiving end system (LEMF) is down for a very
long period, the local buffering at the MF may have to be terminated. Then the
following intercepted data coming from the intercepting nodes towards the MF
would be discarded, until the transit network or LEMF is up and running again.
## C.2.4 CC contents for FTP
### C.2.4.1 Fields
The logical contents of the CC-header is described here.
**CC-header** = (Version, HeaderLength, PayloadLength, PayloadType,
PayloadTimeStamp, PayloadDirection, CCSeqNumber, CorrelationNumber, LIID,
PrivateExtension).
The Information Element CorrelationNumber forms the means to correlate the IRI
and CC of the communication session intercepted.
The first column indicates whether the Information Element referred is
Mandatory, Conditional or Optional.
The second column is the Type in decimal.
The third column is the length of the Value in octets.
(Notation used in table C.2: M = Mandatory, O = Optional, C= Conditional).
Table C.2: Information elements in the first version of the CC header
+------+------+---------+-------------------------------------------+ | Mode | Type | Length | Value | +------+------+---------+-------------------------------------------+ | M | 130 | 2 | **Version** = the version number of the | | | | | format version to be used.

Type of | | | | | the payload. This field has a decimal | | | | | value. The possible PDP Type values can | | | | | be found in the standards (e.g. TS 29.060 | | | | | [17]). The value 255 is reserved for | | | | | future PDP Types and means: \"Other\".\ | | | | | The PDP Type values defined in TS 29.060 | | | | | [17] are used for the GTPv2 and for the | | | | | PMIP protocols as well.

This field has a decimal | | | | | value 0 if the payload data is going | | | | | towards the target (ie. downstream), or 1 | | | | | if the payload data is being sent from | | | | | the target (ie. upstream). If this | | | | | information is transferred otherwise, | | | | | e.g. in the protocol header, this field | | | | | is not required as mandatory.

### C.2.4.2 Information element syntax
The dynamic TypeLengthValue (TLV) format is used for its ease of
implementation and good encoding and decoding performance. Subfield sizes:
Type = 2 octets, Length = 2 octets and Value = 0...N octets. From Length the T
and L subfields are excluded. The Type is different for every different field
standardized.
The octets in the Type and Length subfields are ordered in the little-endian
order, (i.e. least significant octet first). Any multioctet Value subfield is
also to be interpreted as being little-endian ordered (word/double word/long
word) when it has a (hexadecimal 2/4/8-octet) numeric value, instead of being
specified to have an ASCII character string value. This means that the least
significant octet/word/double word is then sent before the more significant
octet/word/double word.
TLV encoding:
* * *
[T]{.underline}ype (2 octets) [L]{.underline}ength (2 octets)
[V]{.underline}alue (0-N octets)
* * *
Figure C.4: Information elements in the CC header
TLV encoding can always be applied in a nested fashion for structured values.
* * *
T L V T L ^V^ TLV TLV TLV TLV
* * *
> (The small \"v\" refers to the start of a Value field that has inside it a
> nested structure).
Figure C.5: Information elements in the CC header
In figure C.6, the TLV structure for UMTS HI3 transfer is presented for the
case that there is just one intercepted packet inside the CC message. (There
can be more CC Header IEs and CC Payload IEs in the CC, if there are more
intercepted packets in the same CC message).
Figure C.6: IE structure of a CC message that contains one intercepted packet
The first octet of the first TLV element will start right after the last octet
of the header of the protocol that is being used to carry the CC information.
The first TLV element (i.e. the main TLV IE) comprises the whole dynamic
length CC information, i.e. the dynamic length CC header and the dynamic
length CC payload.
Inside the main TLV IE there are at least 2 TLV elements: the Header of the
payload and the Payload itself. The Header contains all the ancillary IEs
related to the intercepted CC packet. The Payload contains the actual
intercepted packet.
There may be more than one intercepted packet in one UMTS HI3 delivery
protocol message. If the Value of the main TLV IE is longer than the 2 (first)
TLV Information Elements inside it, then it is an indication that there are
more than one intercepted packets inside the main TLV IE (i.e. 4 or more TLV
IEs in total). The number of TLV IEs in the main TLV IE is always even, since
for every intercepted packet there is one TLV IE for header and one TLV IE for
payload.
## C.2.5 Other considerations
The FTP protocol mode parameters used:
> Transmission Mode: stream
>
> Format: non-print
>
> Structure: file-structure
>
> Type: binary
The FTP service command to define the file system function at the server side:
STORE mode for data transmission.
The FTP client- (=user -FTP process at the MF) uses e.g. the default standard
FTP ports 20 (for data connection) and 21 (for control connection),
\'passive\' mode is supported. The data transfer process listens to the data
port for a connection from a server-FTP process.
For the file transfer from the MF to the LEMF(s) e.g. the following data
transfer parameters are provided for the FTP client (at the MF):
\- transfer destination (IP) address, e.g. \"194.89.205.4\";
\- transfer destination username, e.g. \"LEA1\";
\- transfer destination directory path, e.g. \"/usr/local/LEA1/1234-8291\";
\- transfer destination password;
\- interception file type, e.g. \"2\" (this is needed only if the file naming
method A is used).
LEMF may use various kind directory structures for the reception of
interception files. It is strongly recommended that at the LEMF machine the
structure and access and modification rights of the storage directories are
adjusted to prevent unwanted directory operations by a FTP client.
The use of IPSec services for this interface is recommended.
**[Timing considerations for the FTP transmission]{.underline}**
The MF and LEMF sides control the timers to ensure reliable, near-real time
data transfer. The transmission related timers are defined within the lower
layers of the used protocol and are out of scope of this document.
The following timers may be used within the LI application:
Table C.4: Timing considerations
* * *
Name Controlled by Units Description T1 inactivity timer LEMF Seconds
Triggered by no activity within the FTP session (no new files). The FTP
session is torn down when the T1 expires. To send another file the new
connection will be established. The timer avoids the FTP session overflow at
the LEMF side. T2 send file trigger MF Milliseconds Forces the file to be
transmitted to the LEMF (even if the size limit has not been reached yet in
case of volume trigger active). If the timer is set to 0 the only trigger to
send the file is the file size parameter (see C.2.2).
* * *
## C.2.6 Profiles (informative)
As there are several ways (usage profiles) how data transfer can be arranged
by using the FTP, this clause contains practical considerations how the
communications can be set up. Guidance is given for client‑server
arrangements, session establishments, time outs, the handling of the files (in
RAM or disk). Example batch file is described for the case that the sending
FTP client uses files. If instead (logical) files are sent directly from the
client\'s RAM memory, then the procedure can be in principle similar though no
script file would then be needed.
At the LEMF side, FTP server process is run, and at MF, FTP client. No FTP
server (which could be accessed from outside the operator network) shall run
in the MF. The FTP client can be implemented in many ways, and here the FTP
usage is presented with an example only. The FTP client can be implemented by
a batch file or a file sender program that uses FTP via an API. The login
needs to occur only once per e.g. \ and \ ‑ pair. Once the
login is done, the files can then be transferred just by repeating \"mput\"
command and checking the transfer status (e.g. from the API routine return
value). To prevent inactivity timer triggering, a dummy command (e.g. \"pwd\")
can be sent every\ T seconds (T should be less than L, the actual idle time
limit). If the number of FTP connections is wanted to be as minimized as
possible, the FTP file transfer method \"B\" is to be preferred to the method
A (though the method A helps more the LEMF by pre‑sorting the data sent).
Simple example of a batch file extract:
FTP commands usage scenario for transferring a list of files:
To prevent FTP cmd line buffer overflow the best way is to use wildcarded file
names, and let the FTP implementation do the file name expansion (instead of
shell). The number of files for one mput is not limited this way:
ftp \ \
user \ \
cd \
lcd \
bin
mput \
nlist \ \
close
EOF
This set of commands opens an FTP connection to a LEA site, logs in with a
given account (auto‑login is disabled), transfers a list of files in binary
mode, and checks the transfer status in a simplified way.
Brief descriptions for the FTP commands used in the example:
user \ \ Identify the client to the remote FTP server.
cd \ Change the working directory on the remote machine to
remote‑directory.
lcd \ Change the working directory on the local machine.
bin Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer
mput \ Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as
arguments and do a put for each file in the resulting list. Store each local
file on the remote machine.
nlist \ \ Print a list of the files in a
directory on the remote machine. Send the output to local‑file.
close Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return to the
command interpreter. Any defined macros are erased.
The parameters are as follows:
**\ ** contains the FTP command options, e.g. \"‑i ‑n ‑V ‑p\" which
equals to \"interactive prompting off\", \"auto‑login disabled\", \"verbose
mode disabled\", and \"passive mode enabled\". (These are dependent on the
used ftp‑version.)
**\ ** contains the IP address or DNS address of the destination
(LEA).
**\ ** contains the receiving (LEA) username.
**\ ** contains the receiving (LEA) user\'s password.
**\ ** contains the destination path.
**\ ** contains the source path.
**\ ** wild carded file specification (matching the files to be
transferred).
**\ ** the name of the last file to be transferred.
**\ ** is a (local) file to be checked upon transfer completion; if
it exists then the transfer is considered successful.
The FTP application should to do the following things if the check file is not
found:
‑ keep the failed files;
‑ raise \"file transfer failure\" error condition (i.e. send alarm to the
corresponding LEA);
‑ the data can be buffered for a time that the buffer size allows. If that
would finally be exhausted, DF would start dropping the corresponding
target\'s data until the transfer failure is fixed;
‑ the transmission of the failed files is retried until the transfer
eventually succeeds. Then the DF would again start collecting the data;
‑ upon successful file transfer the sent files are deleted from the DF.
The FTP server at LEMF shall not allow anonymous login of an FTP client.
It is required that FTP implementation guarantees that LEMF will start
processing data only after data transfer is complete.
The following implementation example addresses a particular issue of FTP
implementation. It is important however to highlight that there are multiple
ways of addressing the problem in question, and therefore the given example
does not in any way suggest being the default one.
MF sends data with a filename, which indicates that the file is temporary.
Once data transfer is complete, MF renames temporary file into ordinary one
(as defined in F.3.2.2).
The procedure for renaming filename should be as follow:
1) open FTP channel (if not already open) from MF to LEMF;
2) sends data to LEMF using command \"put\" with temporary filename;
3) after MF finished to send the file, renaming it as ordinary one with
command \"ren\".
Brief descriptions for the FTP commands used in the example:
ren \ \ renaming filename from-name to to-name.
If the ftp-client want to send file to LEMF using the command \"mput\" (e.g.
MF stored many IRI files and want to send all together with one command),
every filename transferred successfully has to be renamed each after command
\"mput\" ended.
# C.3 ETSI TS 102 232-1 and ETSI TS 102 232-7
## C.3.1 General
Functions having an HI3 interface may support the use of ETSI TS 102 232-1
[104] and ETSI TS 102 232-7 [105] to realise the interface.
In the event of a conflict between either specification and the present
document, the terms of the present document shall apply.
C.3.2 Usage for realising HI3The CC sent over HI3 is structured as a header
and a payload. The header contains general information like LIID, timestamp,
correlation information (as for example defined in ETSI TS 102 232-1 [104]).
The payload contains content of communication based on information that the MF
has received from sources in the network. CC defined as passing over the HI3
interface shall be passed as described in ETSI TS 102 232-7 [105] clauses 5
and 6.
NOTE: ETSI TS 102 232-1 [104] specifies in clause 6.4 a transport layer based
on TCP. However, based on agreement between network operator and LEA, in
scenarios where it may not be possible to achieve the necessary LI data rates
based on the transport layer based on single TCP connection, alternative
profiles may be considered (e.g. based on UDP, multi path TCP or other
protocols). Any alternative profile needs to ensure that LI reliability,
security and completeness requirements as specified in TS 33.126 [106] are
met.
###### ## Annex D (informative): LEMF requirements - handling of unrecognised
fields and parameters
During decoding of a record at the LEA, the following exceptional situations
may occur:
1) Unrecognized parameter: The parameter layout can be recognized, but its
name is not recognized:\ The parameter shall be ignored, the processing of the
record proceeds.
2) The parameter content or value is not recognized or not allowed:\ The
parameter shall be ignored, the processing of the record proceeds.
3) The record cannot be decoded (e.g. it seems to be corrupted):\ The whole
record shall be rejected ignored.
NOTE: In cases 2 and 3, the LEMF may wish to raise an alarm to the operator
(NO/AN/SP) administration centre. For case 1, no special error or alarm
procedures need be started at the LEA, because the reason may be the
introduction of a new version of the specification in the network, not be an
error as such security aspects.

###### ## Annex F (informative): Correlation indications of IMS IRI with GSN
CC at the LEMF
This annex is informative and provides some guidelines pertaining to
correlating IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF.
For IMS-enabled multimedia communication scenarios involving a target, it will
be necessary for the LEMF to be able to correlate the media streams (as
provided in the CC intercepted by the GSN) with the specific SIP signaling (as
provided in the IRI intercepted by the CSCFs) used to establish those media
streams. The principal reason for this is that the SDP content within the SIP
signaling may provide the information required to even be able to decode the
media streams. In certain cases, for example, the information in the RTP
header within the media stream packets may not be sufficient to be able to
determine the specific encoding used. The SDP portion of the SIP signaling
would need to provide this information. Another important reason is that the
SIP signaling provides information about the participants in a SIP session
(other than the target) sending and receiving the associated media streams.
The LIID parameter in the IMS IRI and GSN CC can be used to correlating all of
the IMS IRI and all of the GSN CC associated with a particular target. If a
single LIID is used in association all of the target\'s IMS identities (as per
a NO/AN/SP agreement with the LEA), the process of associating the IMS IRI and
GSN CC information is fairly straightforward. If, however, multiple LIIDs are
used (e.g. one per IMS identity) then the LEMF needs to be able to associate
each of the LIIDs that may be used for the IMS IRI with the LIID used for the
CC.
The SIP messsages provided to the LEMF would contain a number of additional
items of information that could be relevant with respect to supporting
correlations of various types. Their potential role in correlating IMS IRI and
GSN CC (or, more specifically, correlating SIP dialogs with media streams) is
discussed below:
**\- Call-ID, From tag, To tag** : These SIP headers would identify different
SIP messages belonging to the same SIP dialog (a call leg between the target
user and a peer SIP user). It should be noted that the Call-ID alone is not
sufficient to identify a dialog. Correlating specific SIP dialogs with
specific media streams is the principal objective of this discussion.
**\- P-Charging-Vector (IMS Charging ID)** : The principal purpose of the IMS
Charging ID (ICID) in IMS is to correlate charging information provided by
different network entities for the same call. The ICID could be useful in
correlating SIP messages belonging to the same call, even if their SIP dialog
identifiers are modified (e.g. by a B2BUA application server). It should be
noted, however, that the use of the ICID is not necessary for the purpose of
correlating SIP dialogs and the corresponding media streams.
**\- P-Charging-Vector (GPRS Charging ID, GGSN address)** : GCIDs, along with
the GGSN address, may be used as identifiers of the PDP contexts. These
identifiers (one for each PDP context used by the SIP session) are made
available to the P-CSCF and subsequently to the S-CSCF. They could be used to
correlate SIP messages with the PDP context(s) used. For the purpose of
correlating SIP dialogs with media streams, this type of correlation would be
useful, although not essential.
**SDP Connection addresses and ports** : The address and port information
within the SDP of the SIP messages need to be matched with the addresses and
ports corresponding to the media streams as provided in the CC reports. This
implies a need to look both at the SDP content of the SIP messages as well as
in the packets provided by the GSN. The set of PDP context identifiers
included in the P-Charging-Vector could be used to simplify the search for a
match. It should also be noted that the SDP contained in the SIP message may
also include essential information about the encoding of each of the media
streams, without which it may not be possible to decode.
###### ## Annex G (informative): United States lawful interception
# G.1 Delivery methods preferences
Law enforcement agencies want reliable delivery of intercepted communications
to the LEMF:
\- U.S. Law enforcement prefers that the capability to deliver IRI to the LEMF
be provided over the HI2 directly over TCP (at the transport layer) and the
Internet Protocol (IP) (at the network layer).
\- U.S. Law enforcement prefers that the capability to deliver content of
communication to the LEMF be provided using the UMTS LI Correlation (ULIC) v1
Header over TCP/IP method for delivery.
# G.2 HI2 delivery methods
## G.2.1 TPKT/TCP/IP
### G.2.1.1 Introduction
The protocol used by the \"LI application\" for the encoding of IRI data and
the sending of IRI data between the MF and the LEMF is based on already
standardized data transmission protocols. At the HI2 interface, the \"LI
application\" protocol is used directly over the Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP), which uses the Internet Protocol (IP) for the delivery of the IRI. IP
is defined in IETF STD0005 [15]. TCP is defined in IETF STD0007 [16].
TCP/IP supports reliable delivery of data. TCP is independent of the payload
data it carries.
### G.2.1.2 Normal Procedures
#### G.2.1.2.0 General
The MF/DF initiates the TCP connection as detailed in G.2.1.2.1.
#### G.2.1.2.1 Usage of TCP/IP when MF initiates TCP Connections
The MF shall initiate TCP connections to the LEMF for LI purposes. Once a TCP
connection is established, the MF shall send the LI application messages
defined in clause G.2.1.3. The MF shall not receive TCP data.
The \"LI application\" messages may be sent over a single TCP connection per
LEMF. A TCP/IP connection shall be capable of transporting \"LI application\"
messages for multiple surveillance cases to a single LEA. The MF initiates the
establishment of TCP connections to the LEMF equipment designated by the LEA.
Optionally, the MF may use more than one TCP connection per LEMF for the
purpose of delivering \"LI application\" messages to minimize the effects of
congestion or facility failures. For example, if more than one TCP connection
was used \"LI application\" messages may be uniformly distributed across the
connections. If delays are detected on one TCP connection, the MF could begin
to transmit more messages on the other TCP connections. The number of TCP
connections supported to the LEMF shall be less than or equal to the
provisioned maximum number of such connections.
#### G.2.1.2.2 Use of TPKT
The individual IRI parameters are coded using ASN.1 and the basic encoding
rules (BER). The individual IRI parameters are conveyed to the LEMF in \"LI
application\" messages or IRI data records.
TCP is a stream-based protocol and has no inherent message delineation
capability.
Since the upper-layer protocols are not self-describing, ISO Transport Service
on top of TCP (ITOT), also referred to as TPKT, as defined in RFC 1006 [27]
and later updated by RFC 2126 [28] is used to encapsulate the \"LI
application\" messages before handing them off to TCP.
Therefore, TPKT shall be required and used in the transport stack of the IRI
delivery interface (i.e. \"LI application\" messages/TPKT/TCP/IP). Only
protocol class 0 defined in RFC 2126 [28] shall be supported. However, the
TPKT connection establishment and negotiation mechanisms shall not be used.
The maximum TPDU size to be supported is the default maximum TPDU size
specified in [28] and is not negotiated. Consequently, the segmentation and
reassembly procedures associated with TPKT will not be used.
In case the TPKT connection establishment is not provided, based on agreement
between the Operator and LEA, the TPDU header included in the TPKT payload
(TPDU field defined in RFC 2126 [28]) may be omitted.
#### G.2.1.2.3 Sending of LI messages
After the TCP connection has been established, the MF shall send the \"LI
application\" messages defined in clause G.2.1.3 to the LEMF, when applicable
events have been detected and such messages are formulated.
The basic \"LI application\" message is called LawfulIntercept message. When
sending IRI, a LawfulIntercept message shall be used and the IRI shall be
encoded within the IRIContent parameter. Multiple IRIContent parameters may be
included within a single LawfulIntercept message. When sending the optional
keep-Alive indication, the LawfulIntercept shall be coded with the keep-Alive
parameter.
In all cases, LawfulIntercept messages are only sent from the MF to the LEMF.
All transfer of packets other than those operationally required to maintain
the connection has to be from the MF to the LEMF only. At no time may the LEMF
equipment send unsolicited packets from the LEMF equipment to the MF.
If supported, a LawfulIntercept message including a keep-Alive parameter shall
be sent when no LawfulIntercept message has been sent for a configurable
amount of time in minutes (e.g. 5 minutes), indicating to the LEMF that the LI
connection is still up. The keep-alive-time parameter shall be settable in
increments of 1 minute, from 1 minute up to a maximum of 5 minutes, with a
default value of 5 minutes.
The \"LI application\" messages shall be encapsulated using TPKT, as defined
in clause G.2.1.2.2, before sending them from the MF to the LEMF using TCP/IP.

\-- The above format for EnvelopedIRIContent can be used with UmtsIRIContent,
EpsIRIContent or any
\-- other IRI content from any of the ASN.1 of Annex B. The object identifier
embedded within the
\-- IRI-Parameters allows for unique identification of the specific IRI being
sent (e.g. UMTS or
\-- EPS).
### G.2.1.4 Error Procedures
Upon detection of the \"User Timeout\" condition, as defined in IETF STD0007
[16], if the surveillance is still active, the MF shall take action to re-
establish the TCP connection with the LEMF. Due to this condition, any
information that TCP was not able to deliver is lost unless it is buffered.
Therefore, the MF should be able to buffer any information that is to be
delivered to the LEMF during a period of User Timeout detection until the re-
establishment of the TCP connection. If the MF is not able to establish the
TCP connection, the MF may discard the buffered information. If the connection
is re-established, the MF shall hand off (transmit) the information stored in
its buffer to TCP before sending any new information.
### G.2.1.5 Security Considerations
Security considerations shall be taken into account in designing the interface
between the MF and the LEMF. At a minimum, the MF shall use a source IP
address known to the LEMF. To protect against address spoofing and other
security concerns, it is recommended that the MF and the LEMF utilize IPSec.
# G.3 HI3 delivery methods
## G.3.1 Use of TCP/IP
At the HI3 interface, the user data packets with the ULIC header, version 1,
shall be sent to the LEMF over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which uses
the Internet Protocol (IP).
TCP/IP supports reliable delivery of data. TCP is independent of the payload
data it carries.
### G.3.1.1 Normal Procedures
#### G.3.1.1.0 Introduction
The MF/DF initiates the TCP connection as detailed in G.3.1.1.1.
#### G.3.1.1.1 Usage of TCP/IP when MF/DF initiates TCP Connections
The MF/DF shall initiate TCP connections to the LEMF for the purpose of
delivering CC. Once a TCP connection is established, the MF/DF will send CC
messages to the LEMF via TCP.
CC messages shall be sent over TCP connections established specifically to
deliver CC. A minimum of one TCP connection shall be established per LEMF to
deliver CC associated with one or more targets. The MF/DF initiates the
establishment of TCP connections to the LEMF equipment designated by the LEA.
Optionally, the MF/DF may use more than one TCP connection per LEMF for the
purpose of delivering CC associated with the target to minimize the effects of
congestion or facility failures. For example, if more than one TCP connection
is used, CC messages may be uniformly distributed across the connections. If
delays are detected on one TCP connection, the MF/DF could begin to transmit
more messages on the other TCP connections. The number of TCP connections
supported to the LEMF shall be less than or equal to the provisioned maximum
number of such connections.
If delivery of CC for only a single target is supported per TCP connection,
then after the TCP connection establishment procedure, the MF/DF shall send
the connectionStatus message including the lawfulInterceptionIdentifier
parameter to the LEMF. The delivery of the lawful interception identifier to
the LEMF after the TCP connection establishment procedure will assist the LEMF
in correlating the TCP connection, established for delivering content of
communication, with a particular surveillance and the target.
If delivery of CC for multiple targets is supported per TCP connection, then
the connectionStatus message including a lawfulInterceptionIdentifier
parameter is not sent to the LEMF. Moreover, in this case, the ULIC v1
parameter shall include the lawful interception identifier (LIID).
#### G.3.1.1.2 Use of TPKT
TCP is a stream-based protocol and has no inherent message delineation
capability.
Since the upper-layer protocols are not self-describing, ITOT, also referred
to as TPKT, as defined in RFC 1006 [27] and later updated by RFC 2126 [28] is
used to encapsulate the CC and connectionStatus messages before handing them
off to TCP.
Therefore, TPKT shall be required and used in the transport stack of the CC
delivery interface (e.g. CC messages/TPKT/TCP/IP). Only protocol class 0
defined in RFC 2126 [28] shall be supported.
However, the TPKT connection establishment and negotiation mechanisms shall
not be used. The maximum TPDU size to be supported is the default maximum TPDU
size specified in [28] and is not negotiated. Consequently, the segmentation
and reassembly procedures associated with TPKT will not be used.
In case the TPKT connection establishment is not provided, based on agreement
between the Operator and LEA, the TPDU header included in the TPKT payload
(TPDU field defined in RFC 2126 [28]) may be omitted.
#### G.3.1.1.3 Sending of Content of Communication Messages
After the TCP connection has been established and the connectionStatus message
has been sent, the MF shall send the CC messages (including the ULIC header,
v1) defined in clause C.1 using TPKT to the LEMF.
In all cases, CC messages are only sent from the MF to the LEMF. All transfer
of packets other than those operationally required to maintain the connection
has to be from the MF to the LEMF only. At no time may the LEMF equipment send
unsolicited packets from the LEMF equipment to the MF.
If supported, a connectionStatus message including the keep-Alive parameter
shall be sent from the MF to the LEMF when no CC message has been sent for a
configurable amount of time in minutes (e.g. 5 minutes), indicating to the
LEMF that the TCP connection is still up. If a keep-alive capability is
supported, a keep-Alive parameter shall be settable in increments of 1 minute,
from 1 minute up to a maximum of 5 minutes, with a default value of 5 minutes.
The CC messages and the connectionStatus message shall be encapsulated using
TPKT, as defined in clause G.3.1.1.2, before sending them from the MF to the
LEMF using TCP/IP.
### G.3.1.2 **ASN.1 for** HI3 Mediation Function Messages
DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::=
ConnectionStatus ::= CHOICE
{
keep-Alive [0] Null,
lawfulInterceptionIdentifier [1] LawfulInterceptionIdentifier,
...
}
### G.3.1.3 Error Procedures
Upon detection of the \"User Timeout\" condition, as defined in IETF STD0007
[16], if the surveillance is still active and user data packets with the ULIC
header, v1 are available for delivery to the LEMF, the MF shall take action to
re-establish the TCP connection with the LEMF. Due to this condition, any
information that TCP was not able to deliver is lost unless it is buffered.
Therefore, the MF should be able to buffer any information that is to be
delivered to the LEMF during a period of User Timeout detection until the re-
establishment of the TCP connection. If the MF is not able to establish the
TCP connection, the MF may discard the buffered information. If the connection
is re-established, the MF shall hand off (transmit) the information stored in
its buffer to TCP before sending any new information.
### G.3.1.4 Security Considerations
Security considerations shall be taken into account in designing the interface
between the MF and the LEMF. At a minimum, the MF shall use a source IP
address known to the LEMF. To protect against address spoofing and other
security concerns, it is recommended that the MF and the LEMF utilize IPSec.

###### ## Annex H (normative): United States lawful interception
This annex shall apply equally to all 3GPP and non-3GPP access types which are
connected to EPC, excluding CS domain (which is not covered by this document).
With respect to the handover interfaces they have to be capable of delivering
intercepted communications and IRI information to the government in a format
such that they may be transmitted by means of equipment, facilities, or
services procured by the government to a location other than the premises of
the carrier.
With respect to location information \'when authorized\' means the ability to
provide location information on a per-surveillance basis.
The delivery methods described in this document are optional methods and no
specific method is required in the United States. For systems deployed in the
U.S., only ULIC version 1, including the timestamp attribute, shall be used.
The specification of lawful intercept capabilities in this document does not
imply that those services supported by these lawful intercept capabilities are
covered by CALEA. Inclusion of a capability in this document does not imply
that capability is required by CALEA. This document is intended to satisfy the
requirements of section 107 (a) (2) of the Communications Assistance for Law
Enforcement Act, Pub. L. 103-414 such that a telecommunications carrier,
manufacturer, or support service provider that is in compliance with this
document shall have \"Safe Harbor\".
In the United States, for a broadband access intercept pertaining to:
1) 3GPP GPRS/UMTS access,
a) The SGSN and the HSS shall perform interception. GGSN may optionally
support interception, however, it has to support interception in the cases
outlined below.
b) The GGSN shall support interception in the following cases:.
\- If direct tunnel functionality as defined in TS 23.060 [42] is used in the
network,
\- If the network supports roaming and the communications comes into the GGSN
from a SGSN (in the visited network) over a Gp interface.
c) For any other scenario where the traffic does not pass the SGSN, the GGSN
shall support interception.
2) 3GPP I-WLAN access,
a) the PDG, WAG, and AAA server shall perform interception.
NOTE: WLAN Interworking specification (TS 29.234 [41]) is no longer maintained
in Release 12 and onwards.
3) Access Via 3GPP EPC
a) The S-GW, MME and the HSS shall perform interception.
b) The PDN Gateway shall support interception in the following cases:
\- The network supports roaming and the communications comes into the PDN
Gateway from an S-GW (in the visited network) over an S8 interface.
\- Non-3GPP access is used to access the EPC via the PDN Gateway
A TSP shall not be responsible for decrypting or decompressing, or ensuring
the government\'s ability to decrypt or decompress, any communication
encrypted or compressed by a subscriber or customer, unless the encryption or
compression was provided by the TSP and the TSP possesses the information
necessary to decrypt or decompress the communication. A TSP that provides the
government with information about how to decrypt or decompress a communication
(e.g. identifying the type of compression software used to compress the
communication, directing the government to the appropriate vendor that can
provide decryption or decompression equipment, or providing the encryption key
used to encrypt the communication) fully satisfies its obligation under the
preceding sentence.
For systems deployed in the U.S, use ATIS-0700005 [55] for the reporting of
IRI and CC interception for IMS VoIP and other Multimedia Services.
For IMS-based VoIP Dialled Digits Reporting (DDR) message definition, see
ATIS-0700005 [55].
NOTE 1: The term, Dialed Digit Extraction (DDE), used in [55] is the same as
Dialed Digit Reporting (DDR) in this specification.
NOTE 2: Dialled Digits are keypad digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 8, 9, *, and
# entered by the target.
> NOTE 3: DDR does not apply to PS domain and IMS-based multi-media services
> other than voice.
>
> For systems deployed in the U.S., the network element identifier is
> required.
>
> For systems deployed in the U.S., the following two records are also
> required for the packet domain:
1\. a REPORT record shall be triggered when the 3G SGSN receives an SMS-MO
communication from the target\'s mobile station;
2\. a REPORT record shall be triggered when the 3G SGSN receives an SMS-MT
communication from the SMS-Centre destined for the target\'s mobile station.
For systems deployed in the U.S., when a mobile terminal is authorized for
service with another network operator or service provider, or within another
service area as defined in J-STD-025- B [65], a Serving System REPORT record
or a Serving Evolved Packet System REPORT Record shall be triggered.
For systems deployed in the U.S., the timestamp reported shall be coded as
generalized time and provide either coordinated universal time or local time
with the local time differential from coordinated universal time.
For systems deployed in the U.S., Packet Data Header Information REPORT
Records shall be delivered to Law Enforcement for IRI only authorizations
where the timestamps shall be coded as specified above.

# J.2 Use of sub-address and calling party number to carry correlation
information
## J.2.1 Introduction
Not all ISDN networks fully support the use of the UUS1 service ETSI EN 300
403‑1 [31]. Some networks may be limited to the transfer of only 32 octets of
UUS1 user information rather than the 128 required for full support of the
UUS1 service. Some networks may not support UUS1 at all.
This annex describes a procedure to provide correlation information which is
appropriate:
1) if a network does not support the delivery of UUS1; or
2) if a network does not support the delivery of 128 octets for UUS1.
If all network involved support the delivery of 128 octets for UUS1 then the
procedure (described in this annex) is not appropriate.
The calling party number, the calling party subaddress (CgP Sub) and the
called party subaddress (CdP Sub) are used to carry correlation information.
## J.2.2 Subaddress options
The coding of a subaddress information element is given in ETSI EN 300 403‑1
[31]. The following options shall be chosen:
Table J.2.1: Subaddress options

## J.2.3 Subaddress coding
### J.2.3.0 General
The coding of subaddress information shall be in accordance with ETSI EN 300
403‑1 [31].
### J.2.3.1 BCD Values
The values 0‑9 shall be BCD coded according to their natural binary values.
The hexadecimal value F shall be used as a field separator. This coding is
indicated in table J.2.2.

Apart from National Parameters, inclusion and format of which is determined by
national regulations, each field noted above shall be included, whether empty
or not. Each of the Operator-ID, CIN, CCLID, LIID and Direction fields shall
end by a field separator.
When sending entity does not have a valid value for either of Operator-ID,

The parameters within the Information Elements \"Called Party Subaddress\" and
\"Calling Party Subaddress\" are variable. Because of this variable length the
parameters may start in different octets in the related Information Element.
i.e. in the Calling Party Subaddress the Direction can be found in octet 17
when the LIID is 25 digits long (table J.2.6).
When the LIID is composed of less than 25 digits, the field separator and
direction indicator \"moves up\" and the rest of the octets is spare till
octet 19. Between the last digit of the LIID and the Direction is always a
Field separator (value F). Also after the \"Direction\" one Field Separator is
given. The last Field separator separates the relevant data from the spare
part. So the location of the TMR and the other service Octets below are fixed
within the Subaddress. The total length of the Calling Party Subaddress is
fixed to 23 octets (including the two Mobile service octets) or 21 octets
(without the two Mobile service octets).
The Service Octets as available shall always be mapped into octets 19 to 23 of
the Calling Party Subaddress, as appropriate. If one of the parameters TMR, BC
or HLC is not available, the octet shall be filled with \"FF\" hex.
In relation to Mobile Bearer Service Code and Mobile Teleservice Code, the
mapping of the values into octets 22 and 23, respectively, shall be done as
follows:
i. if both, Mobile Bearer Service Code and Mobile Teleservice Code are
provided by signalling, octets 22 and 23, shall be present, each containing
the mapped value;
ii. if Mobile Bearer Service Code is provided by signalling, and Mobile
Teleservice Code is NOT provided by signalling, octet 22 shall be present
containing the mapped value, and octet 23 shall be omitted;
iii. if Mobile Teleservice Code is provided by signalling, and Mobile Bearer
Service Code is NOT provided by signalling, there are two implementation
options:
1) neither octet 22 nor octet 23 shall be present;
2) octet 22 shall be filled with \"FF\" hex and octet 23 shall be present
containing the mapped value;
iv. if neither Mobile Teleservice Code nor Mobile Bearer Service Code is
provided by signalling, neither octet 22 nor octet 23 shall be present.
As an option the Calling Party Subaddress and Called Party Subaddress may have
a variable length. The length is given in octet 2.
When the LIID is composed of less than 25 digits in the Calling Party
Subaddress, the Field separator, Direction indicator, Field separator and all
the Service Octets \"moves up\".
National Parameters in a variable length Called Party Subaddress may have
variable length.

## J.2.4 Field coding
### J.2.4.0 Introduction
Each field shall employ decimal coding, except for the Service Octets (octets
19-23 of the CgP Sub) and the octets reserved for national use (octets 16-23
of the CdP Sub). Other values are not permitted.
### J.2.4.1 Direction
The direction field shall be coded as follows:
Table J.2.7: Direction coding
+-----------------------------+-------+ | Indication | Value | +-----------------------------+-------+ | Mono mode (combined signal) | 0 | | | | | (historic) | | +-----------------------------+-------+ | CC from target | 1 | +-----------------------------+-------+ | CC to target | 2 | +-----------------------------+-------+
### J.2.4.2 Coding of the Calling Party Number
The Network Element Identifier (NEID) shall be carried by the calling party
number information element. The coding shall be as follows, depending on the
type of network access (see note 1):
* * *
Numbering plan identification: ISDN/telephony numbering plan (Recommendation
E.164) Nature of address: As specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.731.3 (see
note 1) (e.g. national (significant) number or international number) (in case
of ISUP signalling) Type of number: As specified in ITU-T Q.951, EN 300 092
(e.g. unknown, subscriber number, national number or international number),
and Network Operator specific type of access (BRA or PRA) (in case of DSS1
signalling, see note 2 and 3) Screening indicator: Network provided (in case
ISUP signalling) Screening indicator: User-provided, not screened (in case of
DSS1 signalling, see note 3) Presentation indicator: Presentation allowed
* * *
NOTE 1: The relevant national specification of the Signalling System Number 7
may also specify requirements on the Nature of address for national specific
use in national variants of ISUP.
NOTE 2: Usually, the IIF respectively the Mediation Function is connected to
the network by links using Signalling System Number 7 and ISDN User Part
(ISUP), whereby the parameters are coded according to ITU‑T Recommendation
Q.763 [29]. But in some cases, the IIF respectively the Mediation Function may
be connected via a Basic Rate Access or a Primary Rate Access using D-Channel
signalling, whereby the parameters are coded according to ETSI EN 300 356
[30].
NOTE 3: The network will perform screening, i.e. the number will arrive at the
LEMF as \"user-provided, verified and passed\" with the appropriate \"type of
number\" indicator. A network provided number shall also be accepted at the
LEMF.
## J.2.5 Length of fields
The length of the identifiers is variable. The maximum and recommended minimum
length of each field is given in table J.2.8:
Table J.2.8: Field length
+----------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+---------+ | Field | Minimum length | Maximum length | Maximum length | I.E. | | | | | | | | | (decimal digits) | (decimal digits) | (Half-Octets) | | +----------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+---------+ | Operator ID | 2 | 5 | 5 + 1 | CdP Sub | +----------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+---------+ | CIN | 6 | 8 | 8 + 1 | CdP Sub | +----------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+---------+ | CCLID | 1 | 8 | 8 + 1 | CdP Sub | +----------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+---------+ | LIID | 2 | 25 | 25 + 1 | CgP Sub | +----------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+---------+ | Direction | 1 | 1 | 1 + 1 | CgP Sub | +----------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+---------+ | Service Octets | | | 10 | CgP Sub | +----------------+------------------+------------------+----------------+---------+
###### ## Annex K (normative): VoIP HI3 Interface

###### ## Annex M (informative): Generic LI notification (HI1 notification
using HI2 method)
# M.1 HI.1 delivery methods preferences:
Based on clause 4.4 of this TS 33.108, this annex defines a system of
management notification of LI system with the Handover interface port 1 (HI1).
The handover interface port 1 (HI1) have to transport specific LI service O&M
information from the operator\'s (NO/AN/SP) administration function to the
LEMF. The individual notification parameters should be coded using ASN.1 and
the basic encoding rules (BER). The delivery of HI1 has to be performed
directly using the HI2 mechanism, in order to limit and to protect the LI MF
and DF in terms of the number of interface to any other CSP\'s O&M.
NOTE 1: The different O&M models, specially the 3GPP TMF that may apply are
for further studies.
NOTE 2: This annex may be applied to LI HI1 solutions framework described in
ETSI TS 101 671.
The notification of some actions performed by the operator on the LI system is
requested, only to notify the different elements of the LEA warrant, except
the target\'s IDs. For security reason, any flow including such value may have
to be limited. It is recommended to have a manual input in the LI system by
the accredited staff of the operator.
If the HI1 is used for notification, it may be used for LI management to send
electronic notification to the LEMF in the following cases:
1) after the activation of lawful interception,
2) after the deactivation of lawful interception,
3) after the modification of an active lawful interception.
NOTE: The detailed following points are for further studies:
\- broadcast status system,
\- alarm, especially support for reporting alarm conditions (O&M alarm NNI)
,.- an applicative keep-alive system.
The IRI of HI 1 may include:
\- the OID,
\- Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID) that may be provided by the LEA or by
default by the CSP,
\- Network-Identifier, to identify the operator or part of the network of the
operator, sending such IRI. The value may be determined by national
regulation,
\- BroadcastArea ID, to identify to which geographical area apply the
interception. A Broadcast Area is used to select the group of NEs (network
elements) which an interception applies to. This group may be built on the
basis of network type, technology type or geographic details to fit national
regulation and jurisdiction. The pre-defined values may be decided by national
regulation or the CSP to determinate the specific part of the network or
platform on which the target identity (ies) has to be activated or
deactivated,
\- deliveryInformation which has been decided by the LEA in terms of delivery
numbers, IP addresses for HI2 and HI3,
\- liActivatedTime, in Generalized time with UTC format, unless defined by
national regulation. The day and time either given by the warrant, or of the
actual LI activation by the operator, may be used as a value of this field.,
\- liDeactivatedTime,in Generalized time with UTC format, unless defined by
national regulation. The day and time either given by the warrant, or of the
time of the actual LI deactivation by the operator, may be used as a value of
this field,
\- liSetUpTime the date and time when the warrant is entered into the ADMF.
Format to be decided by national regulation. It is recommended to use
Generalized time with UTC format,
\- type of interception (voice IRI and CC, voice IRI only, data IRI and CC,
data IRI only, voice and data IRI and CC, voice and data IRI only ) ,
\- specific threeGPP National-HI1 parameters, if requested by national
regulation.
It is recommended to have no direct control over the NO/AP/SP\'s equipment by
the LEA/LEMF.
As other IRIs, the individual notifications parameters may have to be sent to
the LEMF as soon as possible with the lowest latency at least once (if
available)
The DF 2 may have to deliver the HI1 notification operation to LEMF.
# M.2 ASN.1 description of LI management notification operation (HI1
interface)
NOTE: This annex does not describe an electronic Handover Interface, but HI1
information, which is sent to the LEMF across the HI2 port.

###### ## Annex N (informative): Guidelines on IMS VoIP Correlation
Information
# N.1 Introduction
It is commonly understood that all IRI messages delivered over the HI2 and,
when applicable, the associated CC delivered over the HI3 shall be correlated.
To accomplish this, ASN.1 modules defined in TS 33.108 define the parameters
under different names. In all cases, except the case of VoIP, it is straight
forward. The ASN.1 module for HI2 defines the parameter which is imported and
used in the ASN.1 module of HI3. In some cases, both HI2 and HI3 modules
import the parameter from somewhere else.
This annex focuses on the correlation numbers used in IMS VoIP and IMS
Conferencing.
# N.2 IMS VoIP
## N.2.0 General
IMS-VoIP-Correlation used to carry the correlation information for IMS VoIP
may consists of one or more set of the following:
IRI-to-IRI-Correlation
IRI-to-CC-Correlation (optional).
IRI-to-IRI-Correlation contains the correlation number related to the IRI
messages and the IRI-to-CC-Correlation contains correlation numbers related to
the CC. Since not all intercepts may have the associated CC, the presence of
IRI-to-CC-Correlation is optional. With being a SET, the above structure
allows to have multiple ICE points for the IRI and multiple CC Intercept
Functions for the CC. The IRI-to-CC-Correlation is defined as a combination of
the following two:
One or more Correlation Number used for the CC
Present only when more than one Correlation Numbers are used for CC.
The ASN.1 defined in B.3 and B.9 show the following:
> IMS-VoIP-Correlation ::= SET OF SEQUENCE {
>
> ims-iri [0] IRI-to-IRI-Correlation,
>
> ims-cc [1] IRI-to-CC-Correlation OPTIONAL
>
> }
>
> IRI-to-CC-Correlation ::= SEQUENCE { -- correlates IRI to Content
>
> cc [0] SET OF OCTET STRING,-- correlates IRI to multiple CCs
>
> iri [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
>
> \-- correlates IRI to CC with signaling
>
> }
>
> IRI-to-IRI-Correlation ::= OCTET STRING -- correlates IRI to IRI
Some of the fields present in the above definition may not be used at all and
their presence is only for historical reasons (in other words, they were
present in the early versions of the TS 33.108 and retained to avoid an
impacts on to early implementations).
For easy understanding, the above definition is shown in a tabular form in
Table N-1 below:
Table N-1: Structure of IMS-VoIP-Correlation
**IMS-VoIP-Correlation**
* * *
**SET 1** **...** **SET m**  
**ims-iri** **ims-cc** **...** **ims-iri** **ims-cc**  
**cc** **iri** **...** **cc** **iri**  
**SET 1** **...** **SET n** **...** **SET 1** **...** **SET p**
It may be difficult to grasp the structure of the IRI-to-CC-Correlation
correlation number. The idea is perhaps to allow the possibility of a change
in the CC Intercept Function during a call. This annex assumes that a for a
VoIP call, only one instance of cc within the ims-cc (i.e. IRI-to-CC-
Correlation) is required.
## N.2.1 One Correlation Number Value
The IMS nodes involved in the setting up of a session, exchange the
correlation number values used for an IMS session and the same correlation
number is used for the CC as well. In this case, the usage of the correlation
information in IRI and CC can be as shown in Table N-2 below:
Table N-2: An example to show the use of IMS-VoIP-Correlation with single
value
**IMS-VoIP-Correlation**
* * *
**SET 1** **...** **SET m**  
**ims-iri** **ims-cc** **...** **ims-iri** **ims-cc**  
**cc** **iri** **...** **cc** **Iri**  
**SET 1** **...** **SET n** **...** **SET 1** **...** **SET p**  
**100** **100** **\--**
In Table N-2, a value of 100 is used as the correlation number. All IRI
messages will have the correlation number value of 100 and the associated CC
will have use the same correlation number value of 100. In this example, there
is only one set of {ims-iri, ims-cc} and there is only one set of {cc} within
the ims-cc and {iri} in ims-cc is not used.
A typical example use-case for the usage of Table N-2 could be: P-CSCF is the
CC Intercept Triggering Function, IMS-AGW as the CC Intercept Function and
S-CSCF as the IRI ICE. P-CSCF and S-CSCF coordinate to use the value 100 and
P-CSCF supplies the value 100 to the IMS-AGW.
## N.2.2 Multiple Correlation Number Values
### N.2.2.0 General
Here, the IMS nodes do not exchange the correlation number values. In this
case, correlation numbers may be delivered in multiple ways. The Table N-3,
Table N-4 and Table N-5 illustrate the usages.
### N.2.2.1 Method 1
Table N-3: An example to show the use of IMS-VoIP-Correlation with multiple
values (method 1)
**IMS-VoIP-Correlation**

**cc** **iri** **...** **cc** **Iri**  
**SET 1** **...** **SET n** **...** **SET 1** **...** **SET p**  
**100** **250** **\--**
In Table N-3, the values of 100 and 250 are used as the correlation number
values. All IRI messages will have the correlation number value of 100 and the
associated CC will have use the correlation number value of 250. In this
example, there is only one set of {ims-iri, ims-cc} and there is only one set
of {cc} within the ims-cc. The {iri} in ims-cc is not used.
A typical example use-case for the usage of Table N-3 could be: P-CSCF is the
CC Intercept Triggering Function, IMS-AGW as the CC Intercept Function and
S-CSCF as the IRI ICE. P-CSCF tells the IMS-AGW to use the correlation number
value of 250 and S-CSCF uses the value of 100 for IRI.
### N.2.2.2 Method 2
Table N-4: An example to show the use of IMS-VoIP-Correlation with multiple
IRI ICEs (method 2)
**IMS-VoIP-Correlation**
* * *
**SET 1** **...** **SET m**

**SET 1** **...** **SET n** **...** **SET 1** **...** **SET p**  
**100** **250** **200**
In Table N-4, the values of 100, 200 and 250 are used as the correlation
number values. The IRI messages will have the correlation number values of 100
and 200 and the associated CC will have use the correlation number value of
250. In this example, there is only one set of {ims-iri, ims-cc} and there is
only one set of {cc} within the ims-cc. The {iri} in ims-cc is used.
A typical example use-case for the usage of Table N-4 could be: P-CSCF is the
CC Intercept Triggering Function, IMS-AGW as the CC Intercept Function and
S-CSCF as the IRI ICE. P-CSCF tells the IMS-AGW to use the correlation number
value of 250 and S-CSCF uses the value of 100 for IRI. P-CSCF may additionally
provide the IRI ICE functions and when it does, the related IRI messages use
the correlation number 200.
As an alternative example, the iri (in ims-cc) and cc (in ims-cc) may use the
same value (e.g. 200) instead of two values 200 and 250.
### N.2.2.3 Method 3

values (method 3)
**IMS-VoIP-Correlation (# of SETs = 2)**

**SET 1** **...** **SET n** **...** **SET 1** **...** **SET p**  
**100** **-** **-** **200** **250** **-**
In Table N-3, the values of 100, 200 and 250 are used as the correlation
number values. The IRI messages will have the correlation number value of 100,
200 and the associated CC will have use the correlation number value of 250.
In this example, there are two sets of {ims-iri, ims-cc} and there is only one
set of {cc} within each of the ims-cc and {iri} in ims-cc is not used.
A typical example use-case for the usage of Table N-5 could be: P-CSCF is the
CC Intercept Triggering Function, IMS-AGW as the CC Intercept Function and
S-CSCF as the IRI ICE. P-CSCF tells the IMS-AGW to use the correlation number
value of 250 and S-CSCF uses the value of 100 for IRI. P-CSCF may additionally
provide the IRI ICE functions and when it does, the related IRI messages use
the correlation number 200.
As an alternative example, in SET2, the ims-iri (in ims-cc) and cc (in ims-cc)
may use the same value (e.g. 200) instead of two values 200 and 250.
## N.2.3 Complex Example - Use of one Correlation Number
Multiple IMS nodes are providing the IRI functions (e.g. S-CSCF and AS/MRFC)
and two media streams (IMS-AGW and MRFP) are delivered to the LEMF as separate
CC. When IMS nodes exchange the correlation numbers used, it is possible to
use the same correlation number for all IRI messages and the CC. This is
illustrated in Figure N-6.
Table N-6: Complex Example, but one value for the correlation number
**IMS-VoIP-Correlation (# of SETs = 2)**

**SET 1** **...** **SET n** **...** **SET 1** **...** **SET p**  
**100** **100** **-** **100** **100** **-**
In Table N-6, correlation number value 100 is used. In the example, two sets
of {ims-iri, ims-cc} and only one set of {cc} within each of the ims-cc is
used. The {iri} in ims-cc is not used.
A typical example use-case for the usage of Table N-6 could be: S-CSCF
provides the IRI ICE functions and the P-CSCF provides the CC Intercept
Triggering Function, IMS-AGW as the CC Intercept Function. For the conference
side of the call, AS provides the IRI ICE functions, MRFC provides the CC
Intercept Trigger Function and the MRFP is the CC Intercept Function. In set
1, the P-CSCF tells the IMS-AGW to use the correlation number 100 for the CC
and S-CSCF uses the correlation number 100\. In set 2, the MRFC tells the MRFP
to use the correlation number 100 and AS uses the correlation number 100 for
the IRI.
## N.2.4 Complex Example - Use of Multiple Correlation Numbers
### N.2.4.0 General
Multple IMS nodes are providing the IRI functions (e.g. S-CSCF and AS/MRFC)
and two media streams (IMS-AGW and MRFP) are delivered to the LEMF as separate
CC. Here, the IMS nodes do not exchange the correlation number information.
In this case, correlation numbers may be delivered in multiple ways. The Table
N-7, Table N-8 and Table N-9 illustrate the usages.
### N.2.4.1 Method 1
Table N-7: Complex example to show the use of IMS-VoIP-Correlation with
multiple values (method 1)
**IMS-VoIP-Correlation**

**SET 1** **...** **SET n** **...** **SET 1** **...** **SET p**  
**100** **250** **\--** **1000** **2500**
In Table N-7, the values of 100, 250, 1000 and 2500 are used as the
correlation number values. The IRI messages will have the correlation number
value of 100 and 1000. The associated CC will have the correlation number
values 250 and 2500. In this example, there are two sets of {ims-iri, ims-cc}
and there is only one set of {cc} within the ims-cc. The {iri} in ims-cc is
not used.
A typical example use-case for the usage of Table N-7 could be: S-CSCF
provides the IRI ICE functions and the P-CSCF provides the CC Intercept
Triggering Function, IMS-AGW as the CC Intercept Function. For the conference
side of the call, AS provides the IRI ICE functions, MRFC provides the CC
Intercept Trigger Function and the MRFP is the CC Intercept Function. In set
1, the P-CSCF tells the IMS-AGW to use the correlation number 250 for the CC
and S-CSCF uses the correlation number 100\. In set 2, the MRFC tells the MRFP
to use the correlation number 2500 and AS uses the correlation number 1000 for
the IRI.
As an alternative example, in SET2, the ims-iri and cc (in ims-cc) may use the
same value (e.g. 1000) instead of two values 1000 and 2500.
### N.2.4.2 Method 2

**SET 1** **...** **SET n** **...** **SET 1** **...** **SET p**  
**100** **250** **200** **1000** **2500**
In Table N-8, the values of 100, 200, 250, 1000 and 2500 are used as the
correlation number values. The IRI messages will have the correlation number
values of 100, 200 and 1000, and the associated CC will have to use the
correlation number value of 250 and 2500. In this example, there are two sets
of {ims-iri, ims-cc} and there is only one set of {cc} within the ims-cc. The
{iri} in ims-cc is used in one set.
A typical example use-case for the usage of Table N-8 could be: S-CSCF
provides the IRI ICE functions and the P-CSCF provides the CC Intercept
Triggering Function, IMS-AGW as the CC Intercept Function. For the conference
side of the call, AS provides the IRI ICE functions, MRFC provides the CC
Intercept Trigger Function and the MRFP is the CC Intercept Function. In set
1, the P-CSCF tells the IMS-AGW to use the correlation number 250 for the CC
and S-CSCF uses the correlation number 100\. P-CSCF may additionally provide
the IRI ICE functions, and when it does, it uses the correlation number 200.
In set 2, the MRFC tells the MRFP to use the correlation number 2500 and AS
uses the correlation number 1000 for the IRI.
As an alternative example, in SET2, the ims-iri and cc (in ims-cc) may use the
same value (e.g. 1000) instead of two values 1000 and 2500. Also, in SET 1,
the iri and cc (in ims-cc) may use the same value (e.g. 200) instead of two
values 200 and 250.

In Table N-9, the values of 100, 200, 250, 1000 and 2500 are used as the
correlation number values. The IRI messages will have the correlation number
values of 100, 200 and 1000 and the associated CC will have to use the
correlation number value of 250 and 2500. In this example, there is one set of
{ims-iri}, two sets of {ims-iri, ims-cc} with one set of {cc} in each of the
{ims-cc} and {iri} in {ims-cc} is not used.
A typical example use-case for the usage of Table N-9 could be: S-CSCF
provides the IRI ICE functions and the P-CSCF provides the CC Intercept
Triggering Function, IMS-AGW as the CC Intercept Function. For the conference
side of the call, AS provides the IRI ICE functions, MRFC provides the CC
Intercept Trigger Function and the MRFP is the CC Intercept Function. In set
1, S-CSCF uses the correlation number 100. In set 2, the P-CSCF tells the IMS-
AGW to use the correlation number 250 for the CC and P-CSCF may provide the
IRI ICE functions with the correlation number 200. In set 3, the MRFC tells
the MRFP to use the correlation number 2500 and AS uses the correlation number
1000 for the IRI.
As an alternative example, in SET3, the ims-iri and cc (in ims-cc) may use the
same value (e.g. 1000) instead of two values 1000 and 2500. Also, in SET 2,
the ims-iri and cc (in ims-cc) may use the same value (e.g. 200) instead of
two values 200 and 250.
# N.3 IMS Conferencing
## N.3.1 General
The ConfCorrelation is used to carry the correlation information for IMS
conferencing. The ASN.1 B.11.1 shows the following:
> ConfCorrelation ::= CHOICE {
>
> correlationValues [0] CorrelationValues,
>
> correlationNumber [1] OCTET STRING,
>
> imsVoIP [2] IMS-VoIP-Correlation,
>
> ...
>
> }
Even though the above ASN.1 definition shows 3 different choices, only last
two choices are used. The other value is present only for historical reasons
(in other words, it was present in the early versions of the TS 33.108 and
retained to avoid impacts to early implementations). The details of IMS-VoIP-
Correlation are described in clause N.2.0.
## N.3.2 Target Initiated AdHoc Conference Call
When a lawful interception is to be done for a target-intiated conference
call, the IRI and CC sent for conference part of the call may have to be
correlated with the IRI and CC sent for the basic part of VoIP call. The
clause N.2.3 and clause N.2.4 illustrate different examples of IMS-VoIP-
Correlation usage for this case.
## N.3.3 Independent Lawful Interception of IMS-Conferencing,
### N.3.3.1 General
An example of independent lawful interception of IMS conferencing is the case
when a lawful interception is activated on a conference-ID. In this case, the
lawful interception is applicable just for IMS conferencing (i.e. not to be
correlated with the basic VoIP call). For this, either the choice of
correlationNumber or the choice of imsVoIP can be used.
### N.3.3.2 Use of correlationNumber (OCTET STRING)
As shown in clause N.3.1, the conferenceNumber is an OCTET STRING. That means
it can have only one value and that value is used as correlation number in IRI
and CC.
For example, if 100 is used as the correlationNumber, then AS providing the
IRI ICE functions for IMS conferencing and MRFC triggerring the CC
interception at MRFP exchange the value 100 and the MRFC supplies that value
to the MRFP.
### N.3.3.3 Use of imsVoIP (IMS-VoIP-Correlation)
#### N.3.3.3.1 One Correlation Number Value
In this case, the same correlation number is used for IRI and CC as shown in
Table N-10 below:
Table N-10: An example to show the use of IMS-VoIP-Correlation\ for IMS
Conferencing with single value
IMS-VoIP-Correlation
* * *
SET 1 ... SET m  
ims-iri ims-cc ... ims-iri ims-cc  
cc iri ... cc Iri  
SET 1 ... SET n ... SET 1 ... SET p  
100 100 --
In Table N-10, a value of 100 is used as the correlation number. All IRI
messages will have the correlation number value of 100 and the associated CC
will have use the same correlation number value of 100. In this example, there
is only one set of {ims-iri, ims-cc} and there is only one set of {cc} within
the ims-cc and {iri} in ims-cc is not used.
A typical example use-case for the usage of Table N-10 could be: AS providing
the IRI ICE functions, MRFP, triggered by MRFC, providing the CC Intercept
Function. The AS and MRFC coordinate to use the value 100 and MRFC supplies
the value 100 to the MRFP.
#### N.3.3.3.2 Multiple Correlation Number Values
Here, the conferencing handling nodes do not exchange the correlation number
values. In this case, correlation numbers may be delivered as illustrated in
Table N-11.
Table N-11: An example to show the use of IMS-VoIP-Correlation\ for IMS
Conferencing with multiple values
IMS-VoIP-Correlation
* * *
SET 1 ... SET m  
ims-iri ims-cc ... ims-iri ims-cc  
cc iri ... cc Iri  
SET 1 ... SET n ... SET 1 ... SET p  
100 250 --
In Table N-11, the values of 100 and 250 are used as the correlation number
values. All IRI messages will have the correlation number value of 100 and the
associated CC will have use the correlation number value of 250. In this
example, there is only one set of {ims-iri, ims-cc} and there is only one set
of {cc} within the ims-cc. The {iri} in ims-cc is not used.
A typical example use-case for the usage of Table N-11 could be: AS providing
the IRI ICE functions and MRFP, triggered by MRFC, providing the CC Intercept
Function. MRFC tells the MRFP to use the correlation number value of 250 and
AS uses the value of 100 for IRI.
In the event MRFC also provides some IRI events, additional cases as
illustrated in Table N-4 and N-5 for basic calls may apply (with AS, MRFC and
MRFP replacing S-CSCF, P-CSCF and IMS-AGW within the typical example of clause
N.2.22 and clause N.2.2.3).
###### ## Annex O (informative): Selection of ASN.1 HI2 sub-domain for LALS
Reporting
The LALS Target Positioning reports may be encoded in any of the following HI2
ASN.1 sub-domains:
\- hi2 (for PS), specified in Annex B.3;
\- hi2CS (for CS), specified in Annex B.3a;
\- hi2eps (for EPS), specified in Annex B.9.
The LALS Target Positioning report records and their ASN.1 parameters for each
sub-domain are presented in the following Tables:
\- 5.5F (for CS);
\- 6.9H (for PS);
\- 10.5.1.1.21 (for EPS).
The selection of a particular ASN.1 sub-domain for LALS Target Positioning
reporting is implementation-specific and out of scope of the present document.
It may depend on the ability of the LI LCS Client to identify the network
domain serving the UE, e.g. from the domain specific parameters in the LCS
Server response, like the RAI for PS. It is also possible that a default sub-
domain is used, e.g. by the operators that have a single network domain
deployed.
For the LALS Enhanced Location for IRI reporting the ASN.1 HI2 sub-domain is
the same one that is used for reporting of the corresponding triggering event,
when the triggering event is reported in either hi2CS, or hi2, or hi2eps sub-
domains.
For the triggering events reported using the dedicated ASN.1 sub-domains, e.g.
MBMS, MMS, GCSE, etc., the LALS reports are encoded in either hi2 (PS) or
hi2eps (EPS) sub-domains.
###### ## Annex P (normative): Removal of content from SMS
Subject to national agreement, the content of an SMS message may have to be
removed in case of IRI-only interception.
The following procedure shall be applied to remove the content.
The short message (SM) portion of the TP-User-Data (TS 23.040 [107] clause
9.2.3.24) shall be replaced by the equivalent of \"Space\" in the original
encoding for the total length of the SM portion as determined by the TP-User-
Data-Length field (TS 23.040 [107] clause 9.2.3.16), and accounting for the
Length of the User Data Header (UDHL) field (TS 23.040 [107] clause 9.2.3.24)
if the latter is present as indicated by the TP-User-Data-Header-Indicator
field (TS 23.040 [107] clause 9.2.3.23). While replacing the SM data, the Data
Coding Scheme (TS 23.038 [108] clause 4) shall be considered.
If the TP-User-Data-Header-Indicator indicates the TP-User-Data Header is
present, the Header shall be rewritten so that each of the Information
Elements that are not classified as \"SMS Control\" in TS 23.040 [107] clause
9.2.3.24 shall be converted to a Filler Information Element per TS 23.040
[107] clause 9.2.3.24.17.
In any case, the overall length of the TP-User-Data, and if present, the
overall length of the TP-User-Data Header, shall not be changed.
NOTE: The procedure in this annex is defined to ensure backwards compatibility
in SMS decoding implementations if the SMS content has been removed.
