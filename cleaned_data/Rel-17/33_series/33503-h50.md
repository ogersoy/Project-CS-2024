# 4 Overview
## 4.1 General
The overall architecture for 5G ProSe is given in TS 23.304 [2]. 5G ProSe
includes several features that may be deployed independently of each other.
For this reason, no overall security architecture is provided and each feature
describes its own architecture.
Security for the 5G ProSe common procedures is described in clause 5, while
the overall security of the 5G ProSe features is described in clause 6.
## 4.2 Reference points and functional entities
### 4.2.1 Functional entities
#### 4.2.1.1 General
Architectural reference model is specified in clause 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and
4.2.7 of TS 23.304 [2].
#### 4.2.1.2 5G ProSe Key Management Function
In addition to the architectural reference model specified in TS 23.304 [2],
the architectural reference model shall support the functional entity 5G ProSe
Key Management Function (5G PKMF) which is the logical function handling
network related actions required for the key management and the security
material for discovery of a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay by a 5G ProSe Remote
UE, and for establishing a secure PC5 communication link between a 5G ProSe
Remote UE and 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.
The 5G ProSe Remote UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay know from which 5G
ProSe Key Management Function(s) to get the needed discovery security
materials for protecting discovery messages and UP-PRUK(s) for establishing a
secure PC5 link between the 5G ProSe Remote UE and the UE-to-Network Relay as
the address of the 5G PKMF(s) is either pre-provisioned or provided by the 5G
DDNMF (or the PCF) in the HPLMN of the 5G ProSe Remote UE to the 5G ProSe
Remote UE, and by the 5G DDNMF (or the PCF) in the HPLMN of the 5G ProSe UE-
to-Network Relay to the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.
The 5G PKMF interacts with the 5G ProSe-enabled UE using procedures over PC8
reference point defined in clause 4.2.2. The protection for the key
request/response messages are described in clause 5.2.5.
The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall request the discovery security
materials from the 5G PKMFs of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relays
from which the 5G ProSe Remote UE gets the relay services.
The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall request the security
materials (e.g. Knrp and Knrp freshness parameter) from the 5G PKMF of the 5G
ProSe Remote UE for PC5 communication.
#### 4.2.1.3 Prose Anchor Function
In addition to the architectural reference model specified in TS 23.304 [2],
the architectural reference model shall support the functional entity Prose
Anchor Function (PAnF) which is the logical function handling network related
actions required for the key management and the security material for
establishing a secure PC5 communication link between a 5G ProSe Remote UE and
5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay over Control Plane.
The PAnF shall store the Prose context info (i.e. SUPI, RSC, CP-PRUK, CP-PRUK
ID) for a 5G ProSe Remote UE.
The PAnF interacts with AUSF using procedures over Npc11 reference point
defined in clause 4.2.2. The PAnF interacts with UDM using procedures over
Npc12 reference point defined in clause 4.2.2.
### 4.2.2 Reference points
In addition to the reference points are specified in clause 4.2.5 of TS 23.304
[2], the 5G Prose architectural reference model shall support the following
reference points:
**PC8:** The reference point between the UE and the 5G ProSe Key Management
Function (5G PKMF). PC8 relies on 5GC user plane for transport (i.e. an \"over
IP\" reference point). It is used to transport security material to UEs for 5G
ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery and communication.
**Npc9:** The reference point between the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE
and the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay. It is used to transport
security material between two 5G PKMFs.
**Npc10:** The reference point between the UDM and the 5G PKMF. It is used to
de-conceal SUCI to gain SUPI, obtain a GBA Authentication Vector (AV) for a
UE, or request relay service authorization information from the UDM.
**Npc11:** The reference point between the AUSF and Prose Anchor Function
(PAnF). It is used to store the Prose context info for a 5G ProSe Remote UE.
**Npc12:** The reference point between the PAnF and UDM. It is used to check
with the UDM whether the Remote UE is authorized to use the UE-to-Network
Relay service.
**Npc13:** The reference point between the SMF and PKMF. It is used to obtain
the SUPI of Remote UE from PKMF.
**Npc14:** The reference point between the SMF and PAnF. It is used to obtain
the SUPI of Remote UE from PAnF.
# 5 Common security procedures
## 5.1 General
This clause describes the security requirements and procedures that are
commonly applied to different modes of ProSe communication, including unicast
mode ProSe Direct Network Communication and unicast mode ProSe Indirect
Network Communication via the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.
## 5.2 Network domain security
### 5.2.1 General
5G Prose uses several interfaces between network entities, e.g. Npc4 between
the 5G DDNMF and the UDM, Npc8 between the 5G DDNMF and the PCF (see TS 23.304
[2]). This clause describes the security for those interfaces.
### 5.2.2 Security of Npc2 reference point
#### 5.2.2.1 General
Npc2 is the reference point between the ProSe Application Server and the 5G
DDNMF as specified in clause 4 of TS 23.304 [2]. When the ProSe Application
Server is in a 3rd party\'s network, the Npc2 comprises two interfaces, i.e.
the service-based interface between the 5G DDNMF and the NEF, and the N33
interface between the NEF and the Prose Application Server. When the Prose
Application Server is in a MNO\'s network, the Npc2 is a purely service-based
interface.
#### 5.2.2.2 Security requirements
When the ProSe Application Server is controlled by a 3rd party, requirements
on security aspects of NEF are captured in clause 5.9.2.3 of TS 33.501 [3].
#### 5.2.2.3 Security procedures
When the ProSe Application Server is controlled by a 3rd party, security
procedures specified in clause 12 of TS 33.501 [3] is applicable.
When the Prose Application Server is controlled by a MNO, security procedures
specified in clause 13 of TS 33.501 [3] is applicable.
As specified in TS 23.304 [2], the 5G System architecture supports the service
based Npc2 interface between 5G DDNMF and ProSe Application Server and
optionally supports PC2 interface between the 5G DDNMF and the ProSe
Application Server. The security of PC2 reference point specified in TS 33.303
[4] shall be reused.
### 5.2.3 Security of UE - 5G DDNMF interface
#### 5.2.3.1 General
PC3a is the reference point between the 5G Prose-enabled UE and the 5G DDNMF
as specified in clause 4.2.5 of TS 23.304 [2].
#### 5.2.3.2 Security requirements
3rd parties shall not be allowed to provide configuration data impacting the
5G ProSe-related network operations to the 5G ProSe-enabled UE. The 5G ProSe-
enabled UE and the 5G DDNMF shall mutually authenticate each other.
The transmission of the material for 5G Prose discovery between the 5G DDNMF
and the 5G ProSe-enabled UE shall be integrity protected.
The transmission of the material for 5G Prose discovery between the 5G DDNMF
and the 5G ProSe-enabled UE shall be confidentiality protected.
The transmission of the material for 5G Prose discovery between the 5G DDNMF
and the 5G ProSe-enabled UE shall be protected from replays.
#### 5.2.3.3 Security procedures for configuration transfer to UICC
See clause 5.3.3.1 in TS 33.303 [4].
#### 5.2.3.4 Security procedures for PC3a using GBA
For the security procedures for protecting data transfer between the UE and
the 5G DDNMF on the PC3a interface, the use of either TLS v1.2 or TLS v. 1.3,
as described in clause 5.3.3.2 in TS 33.303 [4] applies with the following
modifications:
\- The ProSe function is replaced by the 5G DDNMF.
\- Confidentiality protection shall be enabled.
#### 5.2.3.5 Security procedures for PC3a using AKMA
Security procedures specified in clause B.1.3.2 of TS 33.535 [5] is applicable
with the additional changes:
\- The 5G DDNMF takes the role of AF.
\- Confidentiality protection shall be enabled.
#### 5.2.3.6 Privacy issue in PC3a interface
PC3a interface will be used to transfer the configuration data that is used to
perform 5G ProSe Direct Discovery. According to clause 6.3.1.4 of TS 23.304
[2], the UE identity is included in the Discovery Request message. Privacy of
UE identity is ensured by the confidentiality protection over PC3a interface.
### 5.2.4 Security of service-based interfaces used in 5G Prose
#### 5.2.4.1 Security requirements
The 5G Prose network entities shall be able to authenticate the source of the
received data communications.
The transmission of data between 5G Prose network entities shall be integrity
protected.

[2], Npc11 and Npc12 specified in clause 4.2.2 are realized by corresponding
NF service-based interfaces, therefore security procedures specified in clause
13 of TS 33.501 [3] apply to these interfaces.
### 5.2.5 Security for UE - 5G PKMF interface
#### 5.2.5.1 General
The 5G ProSe-enabled UEs have interactions with the 5G PKMF over the PC8
interface in the ProSe features described in clause 4.2.2.
#### 5.2.5.2 Security requirements

The 5G System shall support confidentiality protection, integrity protection
and replay protection of discovery messages in restricted 5G ProSe Direct
Discovery.
The 5G System shall support a method to verify source authenticity of
discovery messages.
### 6.1.3 Security procedures
#### 6.1.3.1 Open 5G ProSe Direct Discovery
The open 5G ProSe Direct Discovery security procedure is described as follows.
Figure 6.1.3.1-1: Open 5G ProSe Direct Discovery security procedure
> 1\. The Announcing UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the ProSe
> Application ID to the 5G DDNMF in its HPLMN in order to be allowed to
> announce a code on its serving PLMN (either VPLMN or HPLMN).
>
> 2\. If the Announcing UE wants to send announcements in the VPLMN, it needs
> to be authorized from the VPLMN 5G DDNMF. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN requests
> authorization from the VPLMN 5G DDNMF by sending Announce Auth.() message.
>
> 3\. VPLMN 5G DDNMF responds with an Announce Auth. Ack () message, if
> authorization is granted. There are no changes to these messages for the
> purpose of protecting the transmitted code for open 5G ProSe Direct
> Discovery. If the Announcing UE is not roaming, these steps do not take
> place.
>
> 4\. The 5G DDNMF in HPLMN of the Announcing UE returns the ProSe Application
> Code that the Announcing UE can announce and a Discovery Key associated with
> it. The 5G DDNMF stores the Discovery Key with the ProSe Application Code.
> In addition, the 5G DDNMF provides the UE with a CURRENT_TIME parameter,
> which contains the current UTC-based time at the 5G DDNMF, a MAX_OFFSET
> parameter, and a Validity Timer. The UE sets a clock which is used for ProSe
> authentication (i.e. ProSe clock) to the value of CURRENT_TIME and the UE
> stores the MAX_OFFSET parameter, overwriting any previous values. The
> Announcing UE obtains a value for a UTC-based counter associated with a
> discovery slot based on UTC time. The counter is set to a value of UTC time
> in a granularity of seconds. The UE may obtain UTC time from any sources
> available, e.g. the RAN via SIB9, NITZ, NTP, GPS, via Ub interface (in GBA)
> (depending on which is available).
NOTE 1: The UE may use unprotected time to obtain the UTC-based counter
associated with a discovery slot. This means that the discovery message could
be successfully replayed if a UE is fooled into using a time different to the
current time. The MAX_OFFSET parameter is used to limit the ability of an
attacker to successfully replay discovery messages or obtain correctly MICed
discovery message for later use. This is achieved by using MAX_OFFSET as a
maximum difference between the UTC-based counter associated with the discovery
slot and the ProSe clock held by the UE.
NOTE 2: A discovery slot is the time at which an Announcing UE sends the
announcement.
> 5\. The Announcing UE starts announcing, if the difference between UTC-based
> counter provided by the system associated with the discovery slot and the
> UE\'s ProSe clock is not greater than the MAX_OFFSET and if the Validity
> Timer has not expired. For each discovery slot it uses to announce, the
> Announcing UE calculates a 32-bit Message Integrity Check (MIC) to include
> with the ProSe Application Code in the discovery message. Four least
> significant bits of UTC-based counter are transmitted along with the
> discovery message. The MIC is calculated as described in clause A.6 using
> the Discovery Key and the UTC-based counter associated with the discovery
> slot.
>
> 6\. The Monitoring UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the ProSe
> Application ID to the 5G DDNMF in its HPLMN in order to get the Discovery
> Filters that it wants to listen for.
>
> 7\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE sends Monitor Req.
> message to the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE.
>
> 8\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE sends Monitor Resp.
> message to the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE.
>
> 9\. The 5G DDNMF returns the Discovery Filter containing either the ProSe
> Application Code(s), the ProSe Application Mask(s) or both along with the
> CURRENT_TIME and the MAX_OFFSET parameters. The Monitoring UE sets its ProSe
> clock to CURRENT_TIME and stores the MAX_OFFSET parameter, overwriting any
> previous values. The Monitoring UE obtains a value for a UTC-based counter
> associated with a discovery slot based on UTC time. The counter is set to a
> value of UTC time in a granularity of seconds. The Monitoring UE may obtain
> UTC time from any sources available, e.g. the RAN via SIB9, NITZ, NTP, GPS
> (depending on which is available).
>
> 10\. The Monitoring UE listens for a discovery message that satisfies its
> Discovery Filter, if the difference between UTC-based counter associated
> with that discovery slot and UE\'s ProSe clock is not greater than the
> MAX_OFFSET of the Monitoring UE\'s ProSe clock.
>
> 11\. On hearing such a discovery message, and if the UE has either not
> checked the MIC for the discovered ProSe App Code via Match Report
> previously or has checked a MIC for the ProSe App Code via Match Report and
> the associated Match Report refresh timer (see steps 14 and 15 for details
> of this timer) has expired, or as required based on the procedure specified
> in TS 23.304 [2], the Monitoring UE sends a Match Report message to the 5G
> DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE. The Match Report contains the UTC-
> based counter value with four least significant bits equal to four least
> significant bits received along with discovery message and nearest to the
> Monitoring UE\'s UTC-based counter associated with the discovery slot where
> it heard the announcement, and other discovery message parameters including
> the ProSe App Code and MIC. If a Match Report is not required, the
> Monitoring UE shall locally process the discovery message and the rest of
> the procedure is not performed.
>
> 12\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE passes the discovery
> message parameters including the ProSe Application Code and MIC and
> associated counter parameter to the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing
> UE in the Match Report message.
>
> 13\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE shall check the MIC is
> valid. The relevant Discovery Key is identified by the ProSe Application
> Code.
>
> 14\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE shall acknowledge a
> successful check of the MIC to the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring
> UE via the Match Report Ack message. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the
> Announcing UE include a Match Report refresh timer in the Match Report Ack
> message. The Match Report refresh timer indicates how long the UE will wait
> before sending a new Match Report for the ProSe Application Code.
>
> 15\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE acknowledges the MIC
> check result to the Monitoring UE. The 5G DDNMF returns the parameter ProSe
> Application ID to the UE. It also provides the CURRENT_TIME parameter, by
> which the UE (re)sets its ProSe clock. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the
> Monitoring UE may optionally modify the received Match Report refresh timer
> based on local policy and then include the Match Report refresh timer in the
> message to the Monitoring UE.
#### 6.1.3.2 Restricted 5G ProSe Direct Discovery
##### 6.1.3.2.1 General
The security for both models of restricted 5G ProSe Direct Discovery is
similar to that of open 5G ProSe Direct Discovery described in clause 6.1.3.1.
Both models also use a UTC-based counter (see step 9 in clause 6.1.3.1) to
provide freshness for the protection of the restricted 5G ProSe Direct
Discovery message on the PC5 interface. The parameters CURRENT_TIME and
MAX_OFFSET are also provided to the UE from the 5G DDNMF in its HPLMN to
ensure that the obtained UTC-based counter is sufficiently close to real time
to protect against replays.
The major differences are that restricted 5G ProSe Direct Discovery requires
confidentiality protection of the discovery messages (e.g. to ensure a UE\'s
privacy is not disclosed to unauthorized parties or tracked due to constantly
sending the same ProSe Restricted/Response Code in the clear) and that the MIC
checking may be performed by the receiving UE (if allowed by the 5G DDNMF).
The security parameters needed by a sending UE to protect a discovery message
(i.e. in Model A the Announcing UE and in Model B the Discoverer UE sending
the ProSe Query Code and the Discoveree UE sending the ProSe Response Code)
are provided in the Code-Sending Security Parameters. Similarly, the security
parameters needed by a UE receiving a discovery message (i.e. in Model A the
Monitoring UE and in Model B the Discoverer UE receiving a ProSe Response Code
and the Discoveree receiving a ProSe Query Code) are provided in the Code-
Receiving Security Parameters.
In addition to clause 6.1.3.4.1 in TS 33.303 [4], 5G Prose introduced two new
features:
\- During the discovery request procedure, 5G DDNMF may optionally provide the
PC5 security policies to the UEs.
\- A ciphering algorithm for message-specific confidentiality is configured at
the UE during the Discovery Request procedure.
5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery is different from 5G ProSe Restricted
Direct Discovery. In 5G ProSe UEâ€‘to-Network Relay discovery, the discovery
security materials are provided by the PKMF for RSC(s) representing user-plane
based security procedure, and by the DDNMF or the PCF for RSC(s) with Control
Plane Security Indicator set representing control-plane based security
procedure. The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery procedures described in
clause 6.1.3.2.2.1 and clause 6.1.3.2.2.2 apply with adjustment when 5G DDNMF
or 5G PKMF is used for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery.
##### 6.1.3.2.2 Security flows
###### 6.1.3.2.2.1 Restricted 5G ProSe Direct Discovery Model A
The security procedure for restricted 5G ProSe Direct Discovery Model A is
described as follows.
Figure 6.1.3.2.2.1-1: Security procedure for restricted 5G ProSe Direct
Discovery Model A
NOTE 1: When the user-plane based security procedure for the UE-to-Network
Relay is used, the 5G PKMF takes the role of the 5G DDNMF as described in
clause 6.3.3.2 of the present document.
Steps 1-4 refer to an Announcing UE:
> 1\. Announcing UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the
> Restricted ProSe Application User ID (RPAUID) to the 5G DDNMF in its HPLMN
> in order to get the ProSe Code to announce and to get the associated
> security material. In addition, the Announcing UE shall include its PC5 UE
> security capability that contains the list of supported ciphering algorithms
> by the UE in the Discovery Request message.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay
> plays the role of the Announcing UE and sends a Relay Discovery Key Request
> instead of a Discovery Request. The Relay Discovery Key Request message
> includes the Relay Service Code (RSC) and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
> Relay\'s PC5 security capability.
>
> 2\. The 5G DDNMF may check for the announce authorization with the ProSe
> Application Server.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, the 5G DDNMF may check with the
> UDM whether the UE-to-Network relay is authorized to announce UE-to-Network
> relay discovery message.
>
> 3\. If the Announcing UE is roaming, the 5G DDNMFs in the HPLMN and VPLMN of
> the Announcing UE exchange Announce Auth.
>
> 4\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE returns the ProSe
> Restricted Code and the corresponding Code-Sending Security Parameters,
> along with the CURRENT_TIME and MAX_OFFSET parameters. The Code-Sending
> Security Parameters provide the necessary information for the Announcing UE
> to protect the transmission of the ProSe Restricted Code and are stored with
> the ProSe Restricted Code. The Announcing UE takes the same actions with
> CURRENT_TIME and MAX_OFFSET as described for the Announcing UE in step 4 of
> clause 6.1.3.1 of the present document. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the
> Announcing UE shall include the chosen PC5 ciphering algorithm in the
> Discovery Response message. The 5G DDNMF determines the chosen PC5 ciphering
> algorithm based on the ProSe Restricted Code and the received PC5 UE
> security capability in step 1. The UE stores the chosen PC5 ciphering
> algorithm together with the ProSe Restricted Code.
>
> In addition, the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE may associate
> the ProSe Restricted Code with the PC5 security policies and include the PC5
> security policies in the Discovery Response message.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, a Relay Discovery Key Response
> is used instead of the Discovery Response, and the RSC is used instead of
> the ProSe Restricted Code.
NOTE 2: 5G DDNMF may get the PC5 security policies in different ways (e.g.
from PCF, from ProSe Application Server, or based on local configuration).
Steps 5-10 refer to a Monitoring UE:
> 5\. The Monitoring UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the
> RPAUID and its PC5 UE security capability to the 5G DDNMF in its HPLMN in
> order to be allowed to monitor for one or more Restricted ProSe Application
> User IDs.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, the 5G ProSe Remote UE plays the
> role of the Monitoring UE and sends a Relay Discovery Key Request instead of
> the Discovery Request. The Relay Discovery Key Request message includes the
> RSC and the 5G ProSe Remote UE\'s PC5 security capability. The Remote UE may
> provide a list of PLMNs in which the UE is authorized to use a 5G ProSe U2N
> Relay. in the Relay Discovery Key Request.
>
> 6\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE sends an authorization
> request to the ProSe Application Server. If, based on the permission
> settings, the RPAUID is allowed to discover at least one of the Target
> RPAUIDs contained in the Application Level Container, the ProSe Application
> Server returns an authorization response.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, the 5G DDNMF of the Remote UE
> may check with the UDM whether the Remote UE is authorized to monitor UE-to-
> Network relay discovery.
>
> 7\. If the Discovery Request is authorized, the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the
> Monitoring UE contacts the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE by
> sending a Monitor Request message, as specified in clause 6.3 of TS 23.304
> [2], including the PC5 UE security capability received in step 5.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery, Relay Discovery Key Request and
> RSC are used instead of Discovery Request and RPAUID. The 5G DDNMF of the
> remote UE discovers 5G DDNMF(s) of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
> relay(s) supporting the RSC based on HPLMNs of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-
> Network relay(s) mapping to the RSC.
NOTE 2a: 5G DDNMF may get the HPLMNs of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
relays in different ways (e.g. from PCF, or based on local configuration).
> 8\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE may exchange
> authorization messages with the ProSe Application Server.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, this step is skipped.
>
> 9\. If the PC5 UE security capability in step 5 includes the chosen PC5
> ciphering algorithm, the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE responds
> to the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE with a Monitor Response
> message including the ProSe Restricted Code, the corresponding Code-
> Receiving Security Parameters, an optional Discovery User Integrity Key
> (DUIK), and the chosen PC5 ciphering algorithm (based on the
> information/keys stored in step 4). The Code-Receiving Security Parameters
> provide the information needed by the Monitoring UE to undo the protection
> applied by the Announcing UE. The DUIK shall be included as a separate
> parameter if the Code-Receiving Security Parameters indicate that the
> Monitoring UE use Match Reports for MIC checking. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN
> of the Monitoring UE stores the ProSe Restricted Code and the Discovery User
> Integrity Key (if it received one outside of the Code-Receiving Security
> Parameters).
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, a Relay Discovery Key Response
> is used instead of the Monitor Response, and the RSC is used instead of the
> ProSe Restricted Code.
>
> The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE may send the PC5 security
> policies associated with the ProSe Restricted Code to the 5G DDNMF in the
> HPLMN of the Monitoring UE.
NOTE 3: For 5G ProSe Direct Discovery, there are two possible configurations
for integrity checking, namely, MIC checked by the 5G DDNMF of the Monitoring
UE, and MIC checked at the Monitoring UE side. Which configuration to use is
decided by the 5G DDNMF, which assigns the monitored ProSe Restricted Code and
signals the Monitoring UE in the Code-Receiving Security Parameters.
For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, MIC checking is performed only at
the Remote UE and the 5G DDNMF of the Remote UE does not need to configure
integrity checking for UE-to-Network Relay discovery.
NOTE 4: The chosen PC5 ciphering algorithm is associated with the ProSe
Restricted Code.
> 10\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE returns the Discovery
> Filter and the Code-Receiving Security Parameters, along with the
> CURRENT_TIME and MAX_OFFSET parameters and the chosen PC5 ciphering
> algorithm. The Monitoring UE takes the same actions with CURRENT_TIME and
> MAX_OFFSET as described for the Monitoring UE in step 9 of clause 6.1.3.1 of
> the present document. The UE stores the Discovery Filter, Code-Receiving
> Security Parameters, and the chosen PC5 ciphering algorithm together with
> the ProSe Restricted Code.
For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, a Relay Discovery Key Response is
returned instead of the Discovery Response, and the RSC is included instead of
the ProSe Restricted Code. The response message contains the discovery
security materials as contained in step 9.
If the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE receives the PC5 security
policies associated with the ProSe Restricted Code in step 9, the Monitoring
UE\'s 5G DDNMF forwards the PC5 security policies to the Monitoring UE.
For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, a Relay Discovery Key Response is
used instead of the Discovery Response, and the RSC is used instead of the
ProSe Restricted Code.
Steps 11 and 12 occur over PC5:
> 11\. The UE starts announcing, if the UTC-based counter provided by the
> system associated with the discovery slot is within the MAX_OFFSET of the
> Announcing UE\'s ProSe clock and if the Validity Timer has not expired. The
> UE forms the discovery message and protects it. The four least significant
> bits of UTC-based counter are transmitted along with the protected discovery
> message.
>
> 12\. The Monitoring UE listens for a discovery message that satisfies its
> Discovery Filter if the UTC-based counter associated with that discovery
> slot is within the MAX_OFFSET of the monitoring UE\'s ProSe clock. In order
> to find such a matching message, it processes the message. If the Monitoring
> UE was not asked to send Match Reports for MIC checking, it stops at this
> step from a security perspective. Otherwise, it proceeds to step 13.
NOTE 5: The UE checking the integrity of the discovery message on its own does
not prevent the UE from sending a Match Report due to requirements in TS
23.304 [2]. If such a Match Report is sent, then there is no security
functionality involved.
Steps 13-16 refer to a Monitoring UE that has encountered a match:
NOTE 6: For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, the steps 13-16 are
skipped.
> 13\. If the UE has either not had the 5G DDNMF check the MIC for the
> discovered ProSe Restricted Code previously or the 5G DDNMF has checked a
> MIC for the ProSe Restricted Code and the associated Match Report refresh
> timer (see step 15 for details of this timer) has expired, or as required
> based on the procedure specified in TS 23.304 [2], then the Monitoring UE
> sends a Match Report message to the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring
> UE. The Match Report contains the UTC-based counter value with four least
> significant bits equal to four least significant bits received along with
> discovery message and nearest to the Monitoring UE\'s UTC-based counter
> associated with the discovery slot where it heard the announcement, and
> other discovery message parameters including the ProSe Restricted Code and
> MIC. The 5G DDNMF checks the MIC.
>
> 14\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE may exchange an Auth
> Req/Auth Resp with the ProSe Application Server to ensure that Monitoring UE
> is authorized to discover the Announcing UE.
>
> 15\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE returns to the
> Monitoring UE an acknowledgement that the integrity check passed. It also
> provides the CURRENT_TIME parameter, by which the UE (re)sets its ProSe
> clock. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE included the Match
> Report refresh timer in the message to the Monitoring UE. The Match Report
> refresh timer indicates how long the UE will wait before sending a new Match
> Report for the ProSe Restricted Code.
>
> 16\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE may send a Match Report
> Info message to the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE.
###### 6.1.3.2.2.2 Restricted 5G ProSe Direct Discovery Model B
The security procedure for restricted 5G ProSe Direct Discovery Model B is
described as follows.
Figure 6.1.3.2.2.2-1: Security procedure for restricted 5G ProSe Direct
Discovery Model B
NOTE 1: When the user-plane based security procedure for the UE-to-Network
Relay is used, the 5G PKMF takes the role of the 5G DDNMF as described in
clause 6.3.3.2 of the present document.
Steps 1-4 refer to a Discoveree UE:
> 1\. Discoveree UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the RPAUID to
> the 5G DDNMF in its HPLMN in order to get Discovery Query Filter(s) to
> monitor a query, the ProSe Response Code to announce and associated security
> materials. The command indicates that this is for ProSe Response (Model B)
> operation, i.e. for a Discoveree UE. In addition, the Discoveree UE shall
> include its PC5 UE security capability that contains the list of supported
> ciphering algorithms by the UE in the Discovery Request message.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay
> plays the role of the Discoveree UE and sends a Relay Discovery Key Request
> instead of a Discovery Request. The Relay Discovery Key Request message
> includes the Relay Service Code (RSC) and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
> Relay\'s PC5 security capabilities.
>
> 2\. The 5G DDNMF may check for the announce authorization with the ProSe
> Application Server depending on 5G DDNMF configuration.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, the 5G DDNMF may check with the
> UDM whether the UE-to-Network relay is authorized to announce UE-to-Network
> relay discovery.
>
> 3\. The 5G DDNMFs in the HPLMN and VPLMN of the Discoveree UE exchange
> Announce Auth. Messages. If the Discoveree UE is not roaming, these steps do
> not take place.
>
> 4\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE returns the ProSe
> Response Code and the Code-Sending Security Parameters, Discovery Query
> Filter(s), Code-Receiving Security Parameters corresponding to each
> discovery filter along with the CURRENT_TIME and MAX_OFFSET parameters and
> the chosen PC5 ciphering algorithm. The Code-Sending Security Parameters
> provide the necessary information for the Discoveree UE to protect the
> transmission of the ProSe Response Code and are stored with the ProSe
> Response Code. The Code-Receiving Security Parameters provide the
> information needed by the Discoveree UE to undo the protection applied to
> the ProSe Query Code by the Discoverer UE. The Code-Receiving Security
> Parameters indicate a Match Report will not be used for MIC checking. The UE
> stores each Discovery Filter with its associated Code-Receiving Security
> Parameters. The Discoveree UE takes the same actions with CURRENT_TIME and
> MAX_OFFSET as described for the Announcing UE in step 4 of clause 6.1.3.1 of
> the present document. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE shall
> include the chosen PC5 ciphering algorithm in the Discovery Response
> message. The 5G DDNMF determines the chosen PC5 ciphering algorithm based on
> the ProSe Response Code and the received PC5 UE security capability in step
> 1. The UE stores the chosen PC5 ciphering algorithm together with the ProSe
> Response Code.
>
> In addition, the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE may associate
> the ProSe Response Code with the PC5 security policies and include the PC5
> security policies in the Discovery Response message.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, a Relay Discovery Key Response
> is used instead of the Discovery Response, and the RSC is used instead of
> ProSe Query Code and ProSe Response Code.
NOTE 2: 5G DDNMF may get the PC5 security policies in different ways (e.g.
from PCF, from ProSe Application Server, or based on local configuration).
Steps 5-10 refer to a Discoverer UE:
> 5\. The Discoverer UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the
> RPAUID and its PC5 UE security capability to the 5G DDNMF in its HPLMN in
> order to be allowed to discover one or more Restricted ProSe Application
> User IDs.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, the 5G ProSe Remote UE plays the
> role of the Discoverer UE and sends a Relay Discovery Key Request instead of
> the Discovery Request. The Relay Discovery Key Request message includes the
> RSC and the 5G ProSe Remote UE\'s PC5 security capabilities. The Remote UE
> may provide a list of PLMNs in which the UE is authorized to use a 5G ProSe
> U2N Relay. in the Relay Discovery Key Request.
>
> 6\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE sends an authorization
> request to the ProSe Application Server. If the RPAUID is allowed to
> discover at least one of the Target RPAUIDs contained in the Application
> Level Container, the ProSe Application Server returns an authorization
> response.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, the 5G DDNMF of the Remote UE
> may check with the UDM whether the Remote UE is authorized to monitor UE-to-
> Network relay discovery.
>
> 7\. If the Discovery Request is authorized, the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the
> Discoverer UE contacts the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE by
> sending a Discovery Request message, as specified in clause 6.3 of TS 23.304
> [2], including the PC5 UE security capability in step 5.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery, Relay Discovery Key Request and
> RSC are used instead of Discovery Request and RPAUID. The 5G DDNMF of the
> remote UE discovers 5G DDNMF(s) of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
> relay(s) supporting the RSC based on HPLMNs of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-
> Network relay(s) mapping to the RSC.
NOTE 2a: 5G DDNMF may get the HPLMNs of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
relays in different ways (e.g. from PCF, or based on local configuration).
> 8\. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE may exchange
> authorization messages with the ProSe Application Server.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, this step is skipped.
>
> 9\. If the PC5 UE security capability in step 5 includes the chosen PC5
> ciphering algorithm, the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE responds
> to the 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE with a Discovery Response
> message including the ProSe Query Code(s) and their associated Code-Sending
> Security Parameters, ProSe Response Code and its associated Code-Receiving
> Security Parameters, an optional Discovery User Integrity Key (DUIK) for the
> ProSe Response Code, and a chosen PC5 ciphering algorithm. The Code-
> Receiving Security Parameters provide the information needed by the
> Discoverer UE to undo the protection applied by the Discoveree UE. The DUIK
> shall be included as a separate parameter if the Code-Receiving Security
> Parameters indicate that the Discoverer UE use Match Reports for MIC
> checking. The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE stores the ProSe
> Response Code and the Discovery User Integrity Key (if it received one
> outside of the Code-Receiving Security Parameters). The Code-Sending
> Security Parameters provide the information needed by the Discoverer UE to
> protect the ProSe Query Code.
>
> The 5G DDNMF in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE may send the PC5 security
> policies associated with the ProSe Response Code to the 5G DDNMF in the
> HPLMN of the Discoverer UE.
>
> For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, a Relay Discovery Key Response
> is used instead of the Discovery Response, and the RSC is used instead of
> ProSe Query Code and ProSe Response Code.
NOTE 3: For 5G ProSe Direct Discovery, there are two possible configurations
for integrity checking, namely, MIC checked by the 5G DDNMF of the Discoverer
UE, and MIC checked at the Discoverer UE side; this is decided by the 5G DDNMF
that assigns the ProSe Restricted Code, and signals the Discoverer UE in the
Code-Receiving Security Parameters.
For 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery, MIC checking is performed only at
the Remote UE and the 5G DDNMF of the Remote UE does not need to configure
integrity checking for UE-to-Network Relay discovery.
NOTE 4: The chosen PC5 ciphering algorithm is associated with the ProSe
Response Code.
> 10\. The 5G DDNMFs in the HPLMN and VPLMN of the Discoverer UE exchange

Steps 12 to 15 occur over PC5:
> 12\. The Discoverer UE sends the ProSe Query Code and also listens for a
> response message if the UTC-based counter provided by the system associated
> with the discovery slot is within the MAX_OFFSET of the Discoverer UE\'s

NOTE 5: Match Reports are not used for the MIC checking of ProSe Query Codes.
> 14\. The Discoveree UE sends the ProSe Response Code associated with the

NOTE 6: The UE checking the integrity of the discovery message on its own does
not prevent the UE from sending a Match Report due to requirements in TS
23.304 [2]. If such a Match Report is sent, then there is no security
functionality involved.
NOTE 7: The security keys in the Code-Sending Security Parameters of
Discoverer UE and the security keys in the Code-Sending Security Parameters of
Discoveree UE need to be generated independently and randomly.
Steps 16-19 refer to a Discoverer UE that has encountered a match:

##### 6.1.3.2.3 Protection of discovery messages over PC5 interface
There are three types of security that are used to protect the restricted 5G
ProSe Direct Discovery messages over the PC5 interface: integrity protection,
scrambling protection, and message-specific confidentiality which are defined
in clause 6.1.3.4.3 in TS 33.303 [4]. The protection mechanisms specified in
TS 33.303 [4] are reused with the following changes:
\- Input parameters to integrity protection algorithm as specified in clause
A.6 in the present document.
\- Message-specific confidentiality mechanisms as specified in clause A.7 in
the present document.
\- In A.5 of TS 33.303 [4], the time-hash-bitsequence keystream is set to L
least significant bits of the output of the KDF, where L is the bit length of
the discovery message to be scrambled and set to Min (the length of discovery
message - 16, 256).
\- Step 3 of clause 6.1.3.4.3.5 of TS 33.303 [4] becomes:
XOR (0xFFFF \|\| time-hash-bitsequence) with the most significant (L + 16)
bits of discovery message.
NOTE 1: 16 is the size of Message Type and UTC-based counter LSB in bit
length.
NOTE 2: The maximum length of the discovery message to be scrambled is limited
to 256 bits.
\- Step 2 of clause 6.1.3.4.3.2 of TS 33.303 [4] becomes:
Calculate MIC if a DUIK was provided, otherwise set MIC to a 32-bit random
string. Then, set the MIC IE to the MIC.
\- Step 4 of clause 6.1.3.4.3.2 of TS 33.303 [4] is not processed.
NOTE 3: Protection for the discovery messages between the ProSe UEs is
provided at the ProSe layer.
## 6.2 Security for unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication
### 6.2.1 General
The unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication procedures are described in TS
23.304 [2]. Unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication is used by two UEs that
directly exchange traffic for the ProSe applications running between the peer
UEs.
PC5 security policy provisioning by 5G DDNMF for unicast mode 5G Prose Direct
Communication during the restricted 5G ProSe Direct Discovery procedure is
specified in clause 6.1.3.2.
PC5 direct communication security for relay services is specified in clause
6.3.
If the UE receives PC5 security policies from 5G DDNMF as specified in clause
6.1.3.2.2, the UE uses the PC5 security policies from 5G DDNMF to establish
PC5 unicast communication security instead of the PC5 security policies
provisioned by PCF or pre-configured in UE as defined in TS 23.304 [2].
### 6.2.2 Security requirements
The initiating UE shall establish a different security context for each peer
UE during the PC5 unicast establishment if the security is activated. It shall
be possible to establish security context also when either one or both the 5G
ProSe-enabled UEs are out of coverage.
The mutual authentication between two 5G ProSe-enabled UEs during PC5 unicast
shall be supported.
The PC5 unicast signalling shall support confidentiality protection, integrity
protection and anti-replay protection.
The PC5 unicast user plane shall support confidentiality protection, integrity
protection and anti-replay protection.
The PCF shall be able to provision the PC5 security policies to the UE per
ProSe application during service authorization and information provisioning
procedure as defined in TS 23.304 [2].
The 5G System shall support means for a secure refresh of the UE security
context.
NOTE 1: The security context refresh may be triggered based on various options
(e.g. validity time etc.).
The 5G System should provide means for mitigating trackability attacks on a UE
during PC5 unicast communications.
The 5G System should provide means for mitigating link ability attacks on a UE
during PC5 unicast communications.
NOTE 2: The 5G system provides means for mitigating trackability and link
ability if security of the connection is activated.
### 6.2.3 Security procedures
The unicast mode security mechanism defined in clause 5.3 of TS 33.536 [6] is
reused in 5G ProSe to provide unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication
security.
### 6.2.4 Identity privacy for the PC5 unicast link
The privacy protection procedures defined in clause 5.3.3.2 of TS 33.536 [6]
are reused in 5G ProSe to provide unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication
security.
## 6.3 Security for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Communication
### 6.3.1 General
This clause describes the security requirements and the procedures that are
specifically applied to 5G ProSe UEâ€‘toâ€‘Network Relay communication defined in
TS 23.304 [2]. The security requirements for 5G ProSe Layerâ€‘3 UE-to-Network
Relay and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay are different and are defined
in clause 6.3.3 and clause 6.3.4 respectively.
There are two security mechanism options for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay:
security procedure over User Plane as defined in clause 6.3.3.2 and security
procedure over Control Plane as defined in clause 6.3.3.3. The 5G ProSe remote
UE and 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay determine the security mechanism based on
the Control Plane Security Indicator associated with the RSC, the Control
Plane Security Indicator and the associated RSC are specified in clause
5.1.4.3.2 of TS 23.304 [2].
The functionality in this clause is supported by both 5G ProSe-enabled UEs for
commercial services and public safety.
### 6.3.2 Security requirements
The following security requirements apply to both 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-
Network Relay and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay:
\- The 5G System shall support the authorization of the UE as a 5G ProSe UE-
to-Network Relay in the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay scenario.
\- The 5G System shall support the authorization of the UE as a 5G ProSe
Remote UE in the 5G ProSe UEâ€‘toâ€‘Network Relay scenario.
\- For UE-to-Network Relay discovery, the security requirements in clause
6.1.2 apply.
\- The 5G System shall support a secure means to establish a PC5 link between
the 5G ProSe Remote UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.
\- The 5G System shall support confidentiality protection, integrity
protection and replay protection for secure communication between the 5G ProSe
Remote UE and the network via 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relays.
\- PC5 signalling integrity security policy is set to \"REQUIRED\" for the 5G
ProSe Remote UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.
\- The 5G ProSe Remote UE shall establish a different PC5 security context
with each different 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and for each different Relay
Service Code. It shall also be possible to establish a PC5 security context
when the 5G ProSe Remote UE is out of coverage.
### 6.3.3 Security for 5G ProSe Communication via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UEâ€‘to-
Network Relay
#### 6.3.3.1 Security requirements
Both user-plane (UP) based and control-plane (CP) based procedures can be used
for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay authorization and security establishment. The
UP based procedure uses a UP connection to the 5G PKMF, while the CP based
procedure uses the ProSe authentication for PC5 key establishment.
The following are the security requirements for 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network
Relay communication:
\- For 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay security established over control
plane, the PCF shall be able to provision the PC5 security policies to the 5G
ProSe Remote UE and the UE-to-Network Relay respectively per 5G ProSe UE-to-
Network Relay service, during service authorization and information
provisioning procedure as defined in TS 23.304 [2].
\- For 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay security established over user
plane, the 5G PKMF shall be able to provision the PC5 security policies to the
5G ProSe Remote UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay respectively per 5G
ProSe UE-to-Network Relay service, during security materials provisioning
procedure defined in clause 6.3.3.2.
\- The PC5 UP security policies for protecting 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay
communication shall be configured per 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay service
based on the security requirements of the specific relay service.
\- The activation of PC5 signalling security shall be based on PC5 CP security
policies of the specific 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay service.
\- The activation of PC5 user plane security shall be based on PC5 UP security
policies of the specific 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay service.
\- 5G PKMF shall be configured with the PC5 security policies associated with
each 5G ProSe Layer-3 UEâ€‘toâ€‘Network Relay service.
#### 6.3.3.2 Security procedure over User Plane
##### 6.3.3.2.1 General
This clause describes a mechanism to setup a PC5 link between a 5G ProSe
Remote UE and 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay. The mechanism includes how a 5G
ProSe Remote UE and 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay get authorized by the 5G
ProSe Key Management Function (5G PKMF) and verify each other\'s roles.
##### 6.3.3.2.2 PC5 security establishment for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay
communication over User Plane
Figure 6.3.3.2.2-1: PC5 security establishment procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-
Network relay communication over User Plane
The 5G ProSe Remote UE is provisioned with the discovery security materials
(see clause 6.1.3.2) and Prose Remote User Key (UP-PRUK) when it is in
coverage. These security materials are associated with an expiration time,
after which they become invalid. If the UE does not have valid discovery
security materials, the 5G ProSe Remote UE needs to connect to the 5G PKMF and
obtain fresh ones to use the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay services.
NOTE 1: The procedure is described for the scenario that the 5G PKMF of the 5G
ProSe Remote UE is different from the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
Relay. If both the 5G ProSe Remote UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay are
served by a single 5G PKMF, the 5G PKMF takes the role of the 5G PKMF of the
5G ProSe Remote UE and the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and the
inter-5G PKMF message exchanges are not needed.
NOTE 2: Steps 0a, 0b, 1a, 1b are performed when the 5G ProSe Remote UE is in
coverage.
> 0a. The 5G ProSe Remote UE gets the 5G PKMF address from the 5G DDNMF of its
> HPLMN. Alternatively, the 5G ProSe Remote UE may be provisioned with the 5G
> PKMF address by PCF. If the 5G ProSe Remote UE is provisioned with the 5G
> PKMF address, the 5G ProSe Remote UE may access the 5G PKMF directly without
> requesting it from the 5G DDNMF. In case that the 5G ProSe Remote UE cannot
> access the 5G PKMF using the provisioned 5G PKMF address, the 5G ProSe
> Remote UE may request the 5G PMKF address to the 5G DDNMF.
>
> 0b. The 5G ProSe Remote UE shall establish a secure connection with the 5G
> PKMF via PC8 reference point. Security for PC8 interface relies on Ua
> security if GBA specified in TS 33.220 [8] is used (see clause 5.2.3.4) or
> Ua* security if AKMA specified in TS 33.535 [5] is used (see clause
> 5.2.5.4). The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall check whether the 5G
> ProSe Remote UE is authorized to receive UE-to-Network Relay service, and if
> the UE is authorized, the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE provides the
> discovery security materials to the 5G ProSe Remote UE. If the 5G ProSe
> Remote UE provides a list of visited networks, the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe
> Remote UE shall request the discovery security materials from the 5G PKMFs
> of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relays from which the 5G ProSe
> Remote UE gets the relay services based on the visited networks from the
> remote UE. If authorized visited networks are not provided by the 5G ProSe
> Remote UE, the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall request the discovery
> security materials from the 5G PKMFs of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
> Relays based on the PLMNs of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relays.
> The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay may include the PC5 security
> policies to the 5G ProSe Remote UE.
NOTE 2a: 5G PKMF may retrieve the PLMNs of the potential 5G ProSe UE-to-
Network relays in different ways (e.g. from PCF, or based on local
configuration).
NOTE 3: The 5G PKMF may be locally configured with the UE\'s authorization
information. Otherwise, the 5G PKMF interacts with the UDM of the UE to
retrieve the UE\'s authorization information.
NOTE 4: The 5G ProSe Remote UE is provisioned by PCF with a list of the
potential visited networks for the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay service (which
is identified by RSC).
> 0c. The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay gets the 5G PKMF address from its HPLMN
> in the same way as described in step 0a.
>
> 0d. The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall establish a secure connection
> with the 5G PKMF via PC8 reference point as in step 0b. The 5G PKMF of the
> 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall check whether the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
> Relay is authorized to provide 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay service, and if
> the UE is authorized, the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay
> provides the discovery security materials to the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
> Relay. The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay may include the PC5
> security policies to the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.
>
> 1a. The 5G ProSe Remote UE sends a UP-PRUK Request message to its 5G PKMF.
> The message indicates that the 5G ProSe Remote UE is requesting a UP-PRUK
> from the 5G PKMF. If the 5G ProSe Remote UE already has a UP-PRUK from this
> 5G PKMF, the message shall also contain the UP-PRUK ID of the UP-PRUK.
>
> UP-PRUK ID shall take the form of either the NAI format or the 64-bit
> string. If the UP-PRUK ID is in NAI format, i.e. username\@realm, the realm
> part shall include Home Network Identifier (i.e. HPLMN ID). The username
> part shall include the 64-bit string.
>
> 1b. The 5G PKMF checks whether the 5G ProSe Remote UE is authorized to
> receive UE-to-Network Relay services. This is done by using the 5G ProSe
> Remote UE\'s identity associated with the key used to establish the secure
> connection between the 5G ProSe Remote UE and 5G PKMF in step 0b. If the 5G
> ProSe Remote UE is authorized to receive the service, the 5G PKMF sends a
> UP-PRUK and UP-PRUK ID to the 5G ProSe Remote UE. If a UP-PRUK and UP-PRUK
> ID are included, the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall store these and delete any
> previously stored ones for this 5G PKMF.
>
> 2\. The discovery procedure is performed between the 5G ProSe Remote UE and
> the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay using the discovery parameters and
> discovery security material as described in clause 6.1.3.2.
>
> 3\. The 5G ProSe Remote UE sends a Direct Communication Request (DCR) that
> contains the UP-PRUK ID or a SUCI if the Remote UE does not have a valid UP-
> PRUK, Relay Service Code (RSC) of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay service
> and K~NRP~ freshness parameter 1 to the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay. If the
> UP-PRUK ID is not in NAI format, the DCR message shall include the HPLMN ID
> of the 5G ProSe Remote UE. The PC5 security establishment procedure between
> the 5G ProSe Remote UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay including
> security parameters and security policy negotiation and protection of
> messages hereafter shall follow the one-to-one security establishment
> described in clause 6.2.3 of the present document. Only additional
> parameters required for the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay scenario
> are described in this clause. The privacy and integrity protection of DCR
> are described in clause 6.3.5.
>
> 4a. The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay sends a Key Request message that
> contains UP-PRUK ID or SUCI, RSC and K~NRP~ freshness parameter 1 to its 5G
> PKMF. The Key Request message shall also include the HPLMN ID of the 5G
> ProSe Remote UE if it is included in the DCR.
>
> 4b. On receiving the Key Request message, the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-
> Network Relay shall check if the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is authorized
> to provide relay service to the 5G ProSe Remote UE based on the 5G ProSe UE-
> to-Network Relay\'s identity associated with the key used to establish the
> secure PC8 connection and the received RSC.
NOTE 4a: The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay needs to do the
authorization of RSC based on its implementation.
If the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay\'s authorization information is not
locally available, the 5G PKMF shall request the authorization information
from the UDM of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay (not shown in the figure)
using Nudm_SDM_Get service as described in TS 23.502 [10]. If the 5G ProSe UE-
to-Network Relay is authorized to provide the relay service based on ProSe
Subscription data as specified in TS 23.502 [10], the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe
UE-to-Network Relay sends the Key Request with the UP-PRUK ID or the SUCI to
the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE. The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-
Network Relay identifies the 5G PKMF address of the 5G ProSe Remote UE based
on the UP-PRUK ID or HPLMN ID or SUCI of the 5G ProSe Remote UE if it is
included in the Key Request message.
NOTE 4b: The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE needs to do the authorization
of RSC based on its implementation.
> 4c. On receiving the Key Request message from the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe
> UE-to-Network Relay, the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall check if
> the 5G ProSe Remote UE is authorized to use the relay service. The relay
> service authorization check shall be based on the UP-PRUK ID and RSC
> included in the Key Request message or the SUPI of the Remote UE and the RSC
> included in the Key Request message. If a SUCI is included in the Key
> Request message, the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall request the UDM
> of the 5G ProSe Remote UE to de-conceal the SUCI to gain the SUPI using
> Nudm_UEIdentifier_Deconceal service, and the UDM invokes SIDF to de-conceal
> SUCI to gain SUPI. If the 5G ProSe Remote UE\'s authorization information is
> not locally available, the 5G PKMF shall request the authorization
> information from the UDM of the 5G ProSe Remote UE (not shown in figure
> 6.3.3.2.2-1).
NOTE 5: Privacy issues need to be considered while determining whether the
SUPI is to be sent to the PKMF. For a privacy control, the UDM can authorize
the PKMF based on its NF type or the service provider domain.
> If a new UP-PRUK is required, the 5G PKMF shall perform the one of the
> following procedures (as shown in the step 4c in figure 6.3.3.2.2-1):
\- If the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE supports the Zpn interface to the
BSF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE, the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE may
request a GBA Push Info (GPI - see TS 33.223 [9]) for the 5G ProSe Remote UE
from the BSF. When requesting the GPI, the 5G PKMF shall include a UP-PRUK ID
in the P-TID field. On receiving the GPI, the 5G PKMF shall use Ks(_ext)_NAF
as the UP-PRUK.
\- If the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE supports the SBI interface to the
BSF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE, the 5G PKMF may request the GPI via SBI
interface as described in TS 33.223 [9]. On receiving the GPI, the 5G PKMF
shall use Ks(_ext)_NAF as the UP-PRUK.
\- If the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE supports the PC4a interface to the
HSS of the UE, then the 5G PKMF of 5G ProSe Remote UE may request a GBA
Authentication Vector (AV) for the 5G ProSe Remote UE from the HSS. On
receiving the AV, the 5G PKMF locally forms the GPI including a UP-PRUK ID in
the P-TID field. The 5G PKMF shall use Ks(_ext)_NAF as the UP-PRUK.
\- If the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE is co-located or integrated with
BSF functionality and supports the SBI interface to the UDM/HSS of the 5G
ProSe Remote UE, the 5G PKMF may request the GBA AV via SBI interface as
described in TS 33.220 [8]. On receiving the AV, the 5G PKMF locally forms the
GPI including a UP-PRUK ID in the P-TID field. The 5G PKMF shall use
Ks(_ext)_NAF as the UP-PRUK.
NOTE 6: GPI is supported only when GBA is used.
> 4d. The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall generate K~NRP~ freshness
> parameter 2 and derive K~NRP~ using the UP-PRUK identified by UP-PRUK ID,
> RSC, K~NRP~ freshness parameter 1 and K~NRP~ freshness parameter 2 as
> specified in A.8. Then, the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE sends a Key
> Response message that contains K~NRP~ and K~NRP~ freshness parameter 2 to
> the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay. This message shall include
> GPI if generated. The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall also include
> the Remote User ID of the 5G ProSe Remote UE in the Key Response message to
> the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay. UP-PRUK ID is used as a
> Remote User ID in the present document.
>
> 4e. The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay sends the Key Response

> K~NRP~, K~NRP~ freshness parameter 2, the GPI if used to calculate a fresh
> UP-PRUK to the UE-to-Network Relay.
>
> 5a. The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall derive the session key (K~NRP-
> SESS~) from K~NRP~ and then derive the confidentiality key (NRPEK) (if
> applicable) and integrity key (NRPIK) based on the PC5 security policies as
> specified in TS 33.536 [6]. The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall store the

>
> 5b. If the 5G ProSe Remote UE receives the message containing the GPI, it
> processes the GPI as described in TS 33.223 [9]. The 5G ProSe Remote UE
> shall derive the UP-PRUK and obtain the UP-PRUK ID from the GPI.

> relaying, if needed etc.
7\. When the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay sends a Remote UE Report to
the SMF as specified in TS 23.304 [2], the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network
Relay shall include Remote User ID stored in the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay
in step 5a. If the UP-PRUK ID used as Remote User ID is not in NAI format, the
5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay shall include the HPLMN ID of the 5G
ProSe Remote UE in the Remote UE Report.
8a. If the mapping of the Remote User ID and the 5G ProSe Remote UE\'s SUPI is
not available in the SMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, the SMF shall
discover the 5G PKMF of the Relay UE using the HPLMN ID from Relay UE's SUPI
(based on the PDU session associated with the relay as specified in TS 23.304
[2]) and send a Resolve Remote User ID request towards the PKMF of the 5G
ProSe UE-to-Network Relay in Npkmf_ResolveRemoteUserId_Get Request message,
including the Remote User ID of the 5G ProSe Remote UE and the HPLMN ID of the
5G ProSe Remote UE if UP-PRUK ID used as Remote User ID is not in NAI format
in the message.
8b. The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay forwards the Resolve
Remote User ID request in Npkmf_ResolveRemoteUserId_Get Request message
towards the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE. The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-
to-Network Relay identifies the 5G PKMF address of the 5G ProSe Remote UE
based on the UP-PRUK ID or HPLMN ID of the 5G ProSe Remote UE.
8c. The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall send a Resolve Remote User ID
response to the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay in
Npkmf_ResolveRemoteUserId_Get Response message, including the SUPI of the 5G
ProSe Remote UE in the message.
8d. The 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay forwards the
Npkmf_ResolveRemoteUserId_Get Response message including the SUPI to the SMF
of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.
The SMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall store the Remote User ID,
the SUPI of the 5G ProSe Remote UE and the Remote UE info in the 5G ProSe
Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay\'s SM context for this PDU Session associated with
the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay. The SMF sends Remote UE Report Ack message
to the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay.
If the 5G ProSe Remote UE receives from the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay a
Direct Connection Reject due to UP-PRUK ID not found in the network, the 5G
ProSe Remote UE shall not attempt to reconnect with the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
Relay using the UP-PRUK ID. The 5G ProSe Remote UE may attempt to connect with
the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay using its SUCI.
NOTE: The UP-PRUK ID not being found condition is detected by the 5G PKMF of
the 5G ProSe Remote UE if it does not find a valid UP-PRUK that corresponds to
the received UP-PRUK ID. The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is informed of this
condition via the 5G PKMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.
##### 6.3.3.2.3 PC5 Key Hierarchy over User Plane

key is derived as specified in clause A.8.
\- K~NRP-SESS~: This key is derived as specified in TS 33.536 [6].
\- NRPEK, NRPIK: These keys are derived as specified in TS 33.536 [6].
#### 6.3.3.3 Security procedure over Control Plane
##### 6.3.3.3.1 General
This clause describes the security mechanisms for the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-
Network Relay authentication, authorization and key management using the 5G
ProSe Remote UE specific authentication for PC5 keys establishment. EAP-AKA',
as specified in IETF RFC 9048 [15] shall be used for 5G ProSe Remote UE
authentication. The EAP-AKA' implementations shall comply with the EAP-AKA'
profile specified in Annex F of of TS 33.501 [3]. Network entities AMF, AUSF
and UDM are involved for key derivation and distribution of keys used for 5G
ProSe UE-to-Network Relay communication. The UE shall be provisioned with
necessary policies and parameters to use 5G ProSe services, as part of the UE
ProSe Policy information as defined in clause 4.2.2 of TS 23.503 [7]. PCF
shall provision the authorization policy and parameters for 5G ProSe UE-to-
Network Relay discovery and communication as specified in clause 5.1.4 of TS
23.304 [2].
##### 6.3.3.3.2 PC5 security establishment for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay
communication over Control Plane
This clause describes the procedure for establishing a PC5 link between the 5G
ProSe Remote UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay. The procedure includes
how the 5G ProSe Remote UE is authenticated by the AUSF of the 5G ProSe Remote
UE via the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and the AMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-
Network Relay during 5G ProSe PC5 establishment. This mechanism can be used
when the 5G ProSe Remote UE is out of coverage.

> message.
NOTE 2: The PAnF is selected based on the Routing Indicator in the CP-PRUK ID.
> 10b. The PAnF retrieves CP-PRUK based on the CP-PRUK ID and checks whether
> the 5G ProSe Remote UE is authorized to use the UE-to-Network Relay service
> based on received RSC, i.e. the PAnF uses Nudm_SDM operation defined in TS
> 23.502 [10] to check with the UDM whether the Remote UE is authorized to use
> ProSe UE-to-Network Relay service by using the SUPI. If the 5G ProSe Remote
> UE is authorized and the retrieved CP-PRUK is valid, the PAnF sends
> Npanf_ProseKey_get Response message with CP-PRUK to the AUSF.
If the CP-PRUK is stale, the PAnF treats it as invalid based on local policy.
When receiving a Npanf_ProseKey_get request in such case, the PAnF responses
with CP-PRUK not found.
> 11\. The AUSF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall generate Nonce_2 and derive
> the K~NR_ProSe~ key using CP-PRUK, Nonce_1 and Nonce_2 as defined in clause

>
> 13\. When receiving a K~NR_ProSe~ from the AUSF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE
> via the AMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
> Relay derives PC5 session key K~relay-sess~ and confidentiality key K~relay-
> enc~ (if applicable) and integrity key K~relay-int~ from K~NR**_** ProSe~,
> as defined in clause 6.3.3.3.3 of the present document. K~NR_ProSe~ ID and
> K~relay-sess~ ID are established in the same way as K~NRP~ ID and K~NRP-
> sess~ ID in TS 33.536 [6]. The CP-PRUK ID is sent from the AMF of the 5G
> ProSe UE to-Network Relay to UE-to-Network Relay. The EAP Success message is
> also sent from the AMF of the 5G ProSe UEâ€‘to-Network Relay to UE-to-Network

> defined in step 11. The 5G ProSe Remote UE shall derive PC5 session key
> K~relay-sess~ and confidentiality and integrity keys from K~NR_ProSe~ in the
> same way as defined in step 13.
The 5G ProSe Remote UE shall verify the Direct Security Mode Command message.
Successful verification of the Direct Security Mode Command message assures
the 5G ProSe Remote UE that the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is authorized to
provide the relay service.
> 16\. The 5G ProSe Remote UE shall send the Direct Security Mode Complete
> message containing its PC5 user plane security policies to the 5G ProSe UE-
> to-Network relay, which is protected by K~relay-int~ or/and K~relay-enc~
> derived from K~relay-sess~ according to the negotiated PC5 signalling
> policies between the 5G ProSe Remote UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
> Relay.
>
> 17\. On receiving the Direct Security Mode Complete message, the 5G ProSe
> UE-to-Network Relay shall verify the Direct Security Mode Complete message.
> Successful verification of the Direct Security Mode Complete message assures
> the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay that the 5G ProSe Remote UE is authorized
> to get the relay service.
After the successful verification of the Direct Security Mode complete
message, the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay responds a Direct Communication
Accept message to the 5G ProSe Remote UE to finish the PC5 connection
establishment procedures and store the CP-PRUK ID in the security context
associated to the PC5 link with the 5G ProSe Remote UE.
18\. When the conditions to send a Remote UE Report reach as specified in TS
23.304 [2], the 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay shall send a Remote UE
Report (Remote User ID, Remote UE info) message to the SMF of the 5G ProSe UE-
to-Network Relay. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay shall include
Remote User ID (i.e. the CP-PRUK ID received in step 13) in the message
19\. If the mapping of the Remote User ID and the 5G ProSe Remote UE\'s SUPI
is not available in the SMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, the SMF of
the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall discover the PAnF of the 5G ProSe
Remote UE based on the Remote User ID (i.e. the CP-PRUK ID) and sends a
Resolve Remote User ID request towards the PAnF in
Npanf_ResolveRemoteUserId_Get Request message, including the Remote User ID of
the 5G ProSe Remote UE in the message.
The PAnF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall send a Resolve Remote User ID
response to the SMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay in
Npanf_ResolveRemoteUserId_Get Response message, including the SUPI of the 5G
ProSe Remote UE in the message.
The SMF of the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall store the Remote User ID,
the SUPI of the 5G ProSe Remote UE and the Remote UE info in the 5G ProSe
Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay\'s SM context for this PDU Session associated with
the Relay. The SMF sends Remote UE Report Ack message to the 5G ProSe Layer-3
UE-to-Network Relay.
Further communication between the 5G ProSe Remote UE and the Network takes
place securely via the 5G ProSe UEâ€‘to-Network Relay.
If the 5G ProSe Remote UE receives from the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay a
Direct Connection Reject due to CP-PRUK ID not found in the network, the 5G
ProSe Remote UE shall not attempt to reconnect with the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
Relay using the CP-PRUK ID. The 5G ProSe Remote UE may attempt to connect with
the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay using its SUCI.
NOTE: The CP-PRUK ID not being found condition is detected by the PAnF if it
does not find a ProSe context info for the 5G ProSe Remote UE that corresponds
to the received CP-PRUK ID. The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is informed of
this condition via the AUSF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE and AMF of the 5G ProSe
UE-to-Network Relay.
##### 6.3.3.3.3 PC5 Key Hierarchy over Control Plane
Figure 6.3.3.3.3-1: PC5 Key Hierarchy for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay
security over Control Plane
The different layers of keys (see figure 6.3.3.3.3-1) are the following:
> \- K~AUSF_P~: A key derived based on 5G ProSe Remote UE specific
> authentication, only used to derive CP-PRUK.
\- CP-PRUK: The root credential derived from K~AUSF_P~ that is the root of
security of the PC5 unicast link used for 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay
service.
\- K~NR_ProSe~: This is a 256-bit root key that is established between the two
entities that communicating using NR PC5 unicast link.
\- K~relay-sess~: This is the 256-bit key that is derived by UE from
K~NR_ProSe~ and is used derive keys that to protect the transfer of data
between the UEs. The K~relay-sess~ is derived per unicast link same as K~NRP-
sess~ specified in TS 33.536 [6]. During activated unicast communication
session between the UEs, the K~relay-sess~ may be refreshed by running the
rekeying procedure. The keys for confidentiality and integrity algorithms are
derived directly from K~relay-sess~. The 16-bit K~relay-sess~ ID identifies
the K~relay-sess~.
\- K~relay-int~, K~relay-enc~: The K~relay-int~ and K~relay-enc~ are used in
the chosen confidentiality and integrity algorithms respectively for
protecting PC5-S signalling, PC5 RRC signalling, and PC5 user plane data.
These keys are equivalent to NRPIK and NRPEK as specified in TS 33.536 [6].
They are derived from K~relay-sess~ and are refreshed automatically every time
K~relay-sess~ is changed.
##### 6.3.3.3.4 Void
#### 6.3.3.4 Security for 5G ProSe Communication via Layer-3 UE-to-Network
Relay with N3IWF support
The 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE selects N3IWF as specified in TS 23.304 [2].
The 5G ProSe Remote UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall establish
security for PC5 connection using either User Plane based solution as
specified in clause 6.3.3.2 or Control Plane based solution as specified in
clause 6.3.3.3. Then, the 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE performs the security
procedures as specified in clause 7.2.1 of TS 33.501 [3].
### 6.3.4 Security for 5G ProSe Communication via 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-
Network Relay
Connection establishment for 5G ProSe Communication via 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-
to-Network Relay is specified in clause 6.5.2.2 of TS 23.304 [2]. During the
connection establishment, the 5G ProSe Remote UE and NG-RAN node shall
establish AS security as specified in TS 33.501 [3].
The 5G ProSe Remote UE and the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall establish
security for PC5 connection using either User Plane based solution as
specified in clause 6.3.3.2 or Control Plane based solution as specified in
clause 6.3.3.3.2. The requirements on security policies for PC5 connection
between the 5G ProSe Remote UE and the Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay are as
follows:
\- The PCF shall be able to provision the PC5 security policies to the 5G
ProSe Remote UE and Layer-2 UEâ€‘toâ€‘Network Relay respectively per ProSe relay
service during their service authorization and information provisioning
procedures as defined in TS 23.304 [2].
NOTE: If PC5 UP security policies are included in the PC5 security policies,
they are negotiated but not enforced by the 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network
Relay.
### 6.3.5 Direct Communication Request in 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay
Communication
#### 6.3.5.1 General
This clause describes the mechanism to protect the privacy of the UP-PRUK
ID/CP-PRUK-ID and RSC in Direct Communication Request (DCR) message when
restricted discovery is used for the UE-to-Network Relay service. This clause
also describes a mechanism to integrity protect the DCR message when DUIK is
provisioned for discovery.
NOTE: Protection of Direct Communication Request (DCR) is provided at the
ProSe layer.
#### 6.3.5.2 Privacy protection of UP-PRUK ID and RSC in DCR
The 5G ProSe Remote UE encrypts the UP-PRUK ID/CP-PRUK ID and RSC using the
code-receiving security parameters used for discovery. The 5G ProSe UE-to-
Network Relay, on receiving the DCR message, decrypts the encrypted UP-PRUK
ID/CP-PRUK ID and RSC using the code-sending security parameters used for
discovery and verifies if the RSC matches with the one that it sent in the
discovery message. If the RSC does not match, the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay
shall abort the PC5 direct link establishment procedure.
The 5G ProSe Remote UE shall encrypt the UP-PRUK ID/CP-PRUK ID and RSC as
follows:
1) If the UE is configured with Discovery User Confidentiality Key (DUCK), the
DCR ciphering key K~DCR~ is set to DUCK. If the UE is configured with
Discovery User Scrambling Key (DUSK) but not DUCK, K~DCR~ is set to DUSK. If
the UE is neither configured with DUCK nor DUSK, the DCR message is not
protected, and Steps 2-3 are skipped.
2) Set Keystream to DCR confidentiality keystream calculated using K~DCR~,
UTC-based counter and RSC as described in clause A.5.
3) XOR the first L bits of the Keystream with the RSC where L is the length of
the RSC, and XOR the remaining bits of the Keystream with the UP-PRUK ID/CP-
PRUK ID.
NOTE 1: If UP-PRUK ID/CP-PRUK ID is in NAI format, encryption of the UP-PRUK
ID/CP-PRUK ID is performed on the username part of the UP-PRUK ID/CP-PRUK ID.
The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall decrypt the encrypted UP-PRUK ID/CP-
PRUK ID and RSC as follows:
1) If the UE is configured with DUCK, the DCR ciphering key K~DCR~ is set to
DUCK. If the UE is configured with DUSK but not DUCK, K~DCR~ is set to DUSK.
If the UE is neither configured with DUCK nor DUSK, the DCR message is not
protected, and steps 2-3 are skipped.
2) Set Keystream to DCR confidentiality keystream calculated using K~DCR~,
UTC-based counter and RSC as described in clause A.5.
3) XOR the first L bits of Keystream with the encrypted RSC where L is the
length of the encrypted RSC, and XOR the remaining bits of Keystream with the
encrypted UP-PRUK ID/CP-PRUK ID.
NOTE 2: If UP-PRUK ID/CP-PRUK ID is in NAI format, decryption of the UP-PRUK
ID//CP-PRUK ID is performed on the username part of the UP-PRUK ID/CP-PRUK ID.
#### 6.3.5.3 Integrity protection of DCR
The 5G ProSe Remote UE integrity protects the DCR message using the code-
receiving security parameters used for discovery. The integrity protection of
the DCR message is performed after the privacy protection of UP-PRUK ID/CP-
PRUK ID and RSC.
The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, on receiving the DCR message, verifies the
integrity of the received DCR message using the code-sending security
parameters used for discovery. If the integrity verification of the DCR fails,
the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall abort the PC5 direct link establishment
procedure.
The 5G ProSe Remote UE shall integrity protect the DCR as follows:
1\. If the UE is configured with DUIK, the DCR integrity key K~INT~ is set to
DUIK. Otherwise, the DCR message is not integrity protected, and steps 2-3 are
skipped.
2\. Calculate Message Integrity Check (MIC) using K~INT~, UTC-based counter
and the DCR message as described in clause A.9.
3\. Set the MIC IE to the calculated MIC.
The 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay shall verify the integrity of the received
DCR message as follows:
1\. If the UE is configured with DUIK, the DCR integrity key K~INT~ is set to
DUIK. Otherwise, the DCR message is not integrity protected, and step 2 is
skipped.
2\. Calculate a MIC using K~INT~, UTC-based counter and the received DCR
message as described in clause A.9 and compare the calculated MIC with the MIC
included in the DCR message. If they mismatch, the integrity check fails.

KEY, for each distinct use of the KDF. Note that \"KEY\" is denoted \"Key\" in
TS 33.220 [8].
## A.1.2 FC value allocations
The FC number space used is controlled by TS 33.220 [8], FC values allocated
for the present document are: 0x85, 0x86, 0x87, 0x88, 0x89, 0x8A, 0x8B.
# A.2 CP-PRUK derivation function
When deriving a CP-PRUK from K~AUSF_P~, the following parameters shall be used
to form the input S to the KDF:
\- FC = 0x85;
\- P0 = SUPI;

used to form the input S to the KDF:
\- FC = 0x86;
\- P0 = \"PRUK-ID\";
\- L0 = length of \"PRUK-ID\";
\- P1 = relay service code;
\- L1 = length of relay service code;
\- P2 = SUPI;
\- L2 = length of SUPI.
The input key KEY is K~AUSF_P~.
# A.4 K~NR_ProSe~ derivation function

\- L1 = length of RSC (i.e. 0x00 0x03).
The input key shall be the 256-bit selected key in Step 1 of clause 6.3.5.2.
The DCR confidentiality keystream is set to L least significant bits of the
output of the KDF, where L = the length of the RSC + the length of the UP-PRUK
ID.
NOTE: If UP-PRUK ID is in NAI format, the length of the UP-PRUK ID is
determined by the username part of the UP-PRUK ID.
# A.6 Calculation of MIC value for discovery message
When calculating a MIC using the Discovery Key for open discovery or the DUIK
for restricted discovery, the following parameters shall be used to form the
input S to the KDF that is specified in Annex B of TS 33.220 [8]:
\- FC = 0x89.
\- P0 = UTC-based counter associated with the discovery slot.
\- L0 = length of above (i.e. 0x00 0x04).
\- P1 = discovery message with the MIC value field set to all zeros.
\- L1 = length of above.
The MIC is set to the 32 least significant bits of the output of the KDF.
The Discovery Key, DUIK, Time parameter and discovery message follow the
encoding also specified in Annex B of TS 33.220 [8].
# A.7 Message-specific confidentiality mechanisms for discovery
Message-specific confidentiality protection is provided by ProSe layer between
ProSe UEs.
The use and mode of operation of the ciphering algorithms are specified in
Annex D in TS 33.501 [3].
The input parameters to the ciphering algorithms as described in Annex D in TS
33.501 [3] are:
\- KEY: 128 least significant bits of the output of the KDF (DUCK, UTC-based
counter, MIC)
\- COUNT: UTC-based counter
\- BEARER: 0x00
\- DIRECTION: 0x00
\- LENGTH: LEN(discovery message) - (LEN(Message Type) + LEN(UTC-based counter
LSB) + LEN(MIC)), where LEN(x) is the length of x in number of bits
KEY is set to as such to generate message-specific keystream as in TS 33.303
[4].
The output keystream of the ciphering algorithm (output_keystream) is then
masked with the Encrytped_bits_mask to produce the final keystream for the
message-specific confidentiality protection (KEYSTREAM):
KEYSTREAM = output_keystream AND (Encrypted_bits_mask \|\| 0xFF..FF)
The KEYSTREAM is XORed with the discovery message for message-specific
confidentiality protection.
# A.8 Calculation of K~NRP~ for UE-to-Network relays

\- P2 = K~NRP~ freshness parameter 2
\- L2 = length of K~NRP~ freshness parameter 2 (i.e. 0x00 0x10)
The input key shall be the 256-bit UP-PRUK.
# A.9 Calculation of MIC value for Direct Communication Request
When calculating a MIC using the DUIK to integrity protect Direct
Communication Request (DCR) message, the following parameters shall be used to
form the input S to the KDF that is specified in Annex B of TS 33.220 [8]:
\- FC = 0x8B.
\- P0 = UTC-based counter.
\- L0 = length of above (i.e. 0x00 0x04).
\- P1 = DCR message with the MIC value field set to all zeros.
\- L1 = length of above.
The MIC is set to the 32 least significant bits of the output of the KDF.
The DUIK, UTC-based counter and DCR message follow the encoding also specified
in Annex B of TS 33.220 [8].
###### ## Annex B (informative): Source authenticity of discovery messages
To achieve source authenticity of discovery messages, the third security
requirement in clause 6.1.2, a UE receiving a discovery message can verify the
source authenticity of the received discovery message by using the provisioned
DUIK under the assumption that the UEs provisioned with the same DUIK are
trusted.
Alternatively, if receiving UEs are not provisioned with the DUIK, the network
can verify the source authenticity of discovery messages via match report
procedure.
