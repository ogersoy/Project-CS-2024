# 1 Scope
The scope for this technical specification is to specify the security features
and mechanisms for secure access to the IM subsystem (IMS) for the 3G mobile
telecommunication system.
Since the scope also encompasses the use of these security features and
mechanisms for secure access to IMS in the context of fixed broadband networks
and 3GPP2 networks, Annex L and Annex S specify how the material in the main
body and other normative Annexes of this document apply to the fixed broadband
networks and 3GPP2 networks respectively.
The IMS supports IP Multimedia applications such as video, audio and
multimedia conferences. SIP, Session Initiation Protocol, was chosen as the
signalling protocol for creating and terminating Multimedia sessions, cf. RFC
3261 [6]. This specification only deals with how the SIP signalling is
protected between the subscriber and the IMS, how the subscriber is
authenticated and how the subscriber authenticates the IMS.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply.
**Authenticated (re-) registration:** A registration i.e. a SIP register is
sent towards the Home Network which will trigger a authentication of the IMS
subscriber i.e. a challenge is generated and sent to the UE.
**Authentication vector: A quintet (as defined in TS 33.102 [1]) or an SD-
AV.**
**Confidentiality:** The property that information is not made available or
disclosed to unauthorised individuals, entities or processes.
**Data integrity:** The property that data has not been altered in an
unauthorised manner.
**Data origin authentication:** The corroboration that the source of data
received is as claimed.
**Entity authentication:** The provision of assurance of the claimed identity
of an entity.
**Key freshness:** A key is fresh if it can be guaranteed to be new, as
opposed to an old key being reused through actions of either an adversary or
authorised party.
**IMS Credentials (IMC):** This is defined in TS 21.905 [7].
**ISIM -- IM Subscriber Identity Module:** For the purposes of the present
document the ISIM is a term that indicates the collection of IMS security data
and functions on a UICC. The ISIM may be a distinct application on the UICC.
> NOTE: The distinction between the terms "ISIM" and "ISIM application" is
> useful for the purpose of describing the IMS security architecture. However,
> in other 3GPP specifications these terms are used as synonyms, i.e. the term
> "ISIM" always refers to the ISIM application in the UICC, as defined in TS
> 31.103 [51].
**Security Domain** : Networks that are managed by a single administrative
authority. Within a security domain the same level of security and usage of
security services will be typical.
**SIP Digest authentication vector (SD-AV) : Temporary authentication data
that enables the IMS network to engage in SIP Digest with a particular user.
An SD-AV consists of four elements: a) protection space user hint realm, b)
the authentication algorithm, c) the quality of protection value qop and d)
the hash of IMPI, realm and password H(A1).**

# 4 Overview of the security architecture
In the PS domain, the service is not provided until a security association is
established between the UE and the network. IMS is essentially an overlay to
the PS-Domain and has a low dependency of the PS-domain. Consequently a
separate security association is required between the multimedia client and
the IMS before access is granted to multimedia services. The IMS Security
Architecture is shown in figure 1.
IMS authentication keys and functions at the user side shall be stored on a
UICC. It shall be possible for the IMS authentication keys and functions to be
logically independent to the keys and functions used for PS domain
authentication. However, this does not preclude common authentication keys and
functions from being used for IMS and PS domain authentication according to
the guidelines given in clause 8.
For the purposes of the present document the ISIM is a term that indicates the
collection of IMS security data and functions on a UICC. Further information
on the ISIM is given in clause 8.
{width="5.004166666666666in" height="3.7444444444444445in"}
Figure 1: The IMS security architecture
There are five different security associations and different needs for
security protection for IMS and they are numbered 1,2, 3, 4 and 5 in figure 1
where:
1\. Provides mutual authentication. The HSS delegates the performance of
subscriber authentication to the Sâ€‘CSCF. The long-term key in the ISIM and the
HSS is associated with the IMPI. The subscriber will have one (network
internal) user private identity (IMPI) and at least one external user public
identity (IMPU).
2\. Provides a secure link and a security association between the UE and a
Pâ€‘CSCF for protection of the Gm reference point. Data origin authentication is
provided i.e. the corroboration that the source of data received is as
claimed. For the definition of the Gm reference point cf. TS 23.002 [9].
3\. Provides security within the network domain internally for the Cx-
interface. This security association is covered by TS 33.210 [5]. For the
definition of the Cx-interface cf. TS 23.002 [9].
4\. Provides security between different networks for SIP capable nodes. This
security association is covered by TS 33.210 [5]. This security association is
only applicable when the Pâ€‘CSCF resides in the VN and if the Pâ€‘CSCF resides in
the HN then bullet point number five below applies, cf. also figure 2 and
figure 3.
5\. Provides security within the network internally between SIP capable nodes.
This security association is covered by TS 33.210 [5]. Note that this security
association also applies when the Pâ€‘CSCF resides in the HN.
There exist other interfaces and reference points in IMS, which have not been
addressed above. Those interfaces and reference points reside within the IMS,
either within the same security domain or between different security domains.
The protection of all such interfaces and reference points apart from the Gm
reference point are protected as specified in TS 33.210 [5].
Mutual authentication is required between the UE and the HN.
The mechanisms specified in this technical specification are independent of
the mechanisms defined for the CS- and PS-domain.
An independent IMS security mechanism provides additional protection against
security breaches. For example, if the PS-Domain security is breached the IMS
would continue to be protected by its own security mechanism. As indicated in
figure 1 the Pâ€‘CSCF may be located either in the Visited or the Home Network.
The Pâ€‘CSCF shall be co-located within the same network as the GGSN/PGW, which
may reside in the VPLMN or HPLMN according to the APN and GGSN/PGW selection
criteria, cf. TS 23.060 [10] and TS 23.401 [56].

Figure 3: This figure gives an overview of the security architecture for IMS
and the relation with Network Domain security, cf. TS 33.210 [5], when the
Pâ€‘CSCF resides in the HN
The confidentiality and integrity protection for SIP-signalling is provided in
a hop-by-hop fashion, cf. figure 2 and figure 3. The first hop i.e. between
the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF is specified in this technical specification. The other
hops, inter-domain and intra-domain are specified in TS 33.210 [5].
# 5 Security features
## 5.1 Secure access to IMS
### 5.1.1 Authentication of the subscriber and the network
Authentication between the subscriber and the network shall be performed as
specified in clause 6.1.
An IM-subscriber will have its subscriber profile located in the HSS in the
Home Network. The subscriber profile will contain information on the
subscriber that may not be revealed to an external partner, cf. TS 23.228 [3].
At registration an Sâ€‘CSCF is assigned to the subscriber by the Iâ€‘CSCF. The
subscriber profile will be downloaded to the Sâ€‘CSCF over the Cx-reference
point from the HSS (Cx-Pull). When a subscriber requests access to the IP
Multimedia Core Network Subsystem this Sâ€‘CSCF will check, by matching the
request with the subscriber profile, if the subscriber is allowed to continue
with the request or not i.e. Home Control (Authorization of IM-services).
All SIP-signalling will take place over the PS-domain in the user plane i.e.
IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem is essentially an overlay to the PS-
domain. Hence the Visited Network will have control of all the subscribers in
the PS-domain i.e. Visited Control (Authorization of bearer resources) since
the Visited Network provides the subscriber with a transport service and its
associated QoS.
For IM-services a new security association is required between the UE and the
IMS before access is granted to IM-services.
The mechanism for mutual authentication in UMTS/LTE is called UMTS/EPS AKA.
They are challenge response protocols and the AuC/HSS in the Home Stratum
derives the challenge. A Quintet containing the challenge is sent from the
Home Stratum to the Serving Network. The Quintet contains the expected
response XRES and also a message authentication code MAC. The Serving Network
compares the response from the UE with the XRES and if they match the UE has
been authenticated. The UE calculates an expected MAC, XMAC, and compares this
with the received MAC and if they match the UE has authenticated the Serving
Network.
The AKA-protocol is a secure protocol developed for UMTS and the same
concept/principles is reused for the IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem,
where it is called IMS AKA.
NOTE: Although the method of calculating the parameters in UTMS AKA and IMS
AKA are identical, the parameters are transported in slightly different ways.
In UMTS, the UE's response RES is sent in the clear, while in IMS RES is not
sent in the clear but combined with other parameters to form an authentication
response and the authentication response is sent to the network (as described
in RFC 3310 [17]).
The Home Network authenticates the subscriber at anytime via the registration
or re-registration procedures.
### 5.1.2 Re-Authentication of the subscriber
Initial registration shall always be authenticated. It is the policy of the
operator that decides when to trigger a re-authentication by the Sâ€‘CSCF. Hence
a re-registration might not need to be authenticated.
A SIP REGISTER message, which has not been integrity protected at the first
hop, shall be considered as initial registration.
The Sâ€‘CSCF shall also be able to initiate an authenticated re-registration of
a user at any time, independent of previous registrations.
### 5.1.3 Confidentiality protection
Possibility for IMS specific confidentiality protection shall be provided to
SIP signalling messages between the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF. Operators shall take
care that the deployed confidentiality protection solution and roaming
agreements fulfils the confidentiality requirements presented in the local
privacy legislation. The following mechanisms are provided at SIP layer:
1\. The UE shall always offer encryption algorithms for Pâ€‘CSCF to be used for
the session, as specified in clause 7.
2\. The Pâ€‘CSCF shall decide whether the IMS specific encryption mechanism is
used. If used, the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF shall agree on security associations,
which include the encryption key that shall be used for the confidentiality
protection. The mechanism is based on IMS AKA and specified in clause 6.1.
Confidentiality between CSCFs, and between CSCFs and the HSS shall rely on
mechanisms specified by Network Domain Security in TS 33.210 [5].
### 5.1.4 Integrity protection
Integrity protection shall be applied between the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF for
protecting the SIP signalling, as specified in clause 6.3. The following
mechanisms are provided.
1\. The UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF shall negotiate the integrity algorithm that shall
be used for the session, as specified in clause 7.
2\. The UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF shall agree on security associations, which include
the integrity keys that shall be used for the integrity protection. The
mechanism is based on IMS AKA and specified in clause 6.1.
3\. The UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF shall both verify that the data received originates
from a node, which has the agreed integrity key. This verification is also
used to detect if the data has been tampered with.
4\. Replay attacks and reflection attacks shall be mitigated.
Integrity protection between CSCFs and between CSCFs and the HSS shall rely on
mechanisms specified by Network Domain Security in TS 33.210 [5].
NOTE 1: TLS is mandatorily supported by SIP proxies according to RFC 3261 [6],
and operators may use it to provide confidentiality and integrity inside their
networks instead of or on top of IPsec, as the intra-domain Zb interface is
optional, and TLS may also be used between IMS networks on top of IPsec. It
should be pointed out, that the 3GPP specifications do not ensure backward
compatibility between CSCFs that do not support TLS and those CSCFs and other
networks that do support it.. These management and capability issues need then
to be solved by manual configuration of the involved operators. If TLS is to
be applied then the authentication framework in TS 33.310 [24] can be used.
## 5.2 Network topology hiding
The operational details of an operator\'s network are sensitive business
information that operators are reluctant to share with their competitors.
While there may be situations (partnerships or other business relations) where
the sharing of such information is appropriate, the possibility should exist
for an operator to determine whether or not the internals of its network need
to be hidden.
It shall be possible to hide the network topology from other operators, which
includes the hiding of the number of Sâ€‘CSCFs, the capabilities of the Sâ€‘CSCFs
and the capability of the network.
The Iâ€‘CSCF/IBCF shall have the capability to encrypt the addresses of all the
entities of the operator network in SIP Via, Record-Route, Route and Path
headers and then decrypt the addresses when handling the response to a
request. The Pâ€‘CSCF may receive routing information that is encrypted but the
Pâ€‘CSCF will not have the key to decrypt this information.
The mechanism shall support the scenario that different Iâ€‘CSCFs/IBCF s in the
HN may encrypt and decrypt the addresses of all the entities of the operator
network.
## 5.3 SIP Privacy handling in IMS Networks
Privacy may in many instances be equivalent with confidentiality i.e. to hide
the information (using encryption and encryption keys) from all entities
except those who are authorized to understand the information. The SIP Privacy
Extensions for IMS Networks do not provide such confidentiality. The purpose
of the mechanism is rather to give an IMS subscriber the possibility to
withhold certain identity information of the subscriber as specified in IETF
RFC 3323 [29] and IETF RFC 3325 [30].
NOTE 1: It is useful that the privacy mechanism for IMS networks does not
create states in the CSCFs other than the normal SIP states.
## 5.4 SIP Privacy handling when interworking with non-IMS Networks
When a Relâ€‘6 IMS is interworking with a non-IMS network, the CSCF in the IMS
network shall decide the trust relation with the other end. The other end is
trusted when the security mechanism for the interworking (see clause 6.5) is
applied as well as the availability of an inter-working agreement. If the
interworking nonâ€‘IMS network is not trusted, the privacy information shall be
removed from the traffic towards to this nonâ€‘IMS network. When receiving SIP
signalling, the CSCF shall also verify if any privacy information is already
contained. If the interworking nonâ€‘IMS network is not trusted, the information
shall be removed by the CSCF, and retained otherwise.
Because absence of the security mechanism for the interworking (see clause
6.5) indicates an untrusted nonâ€‘IMS network, separate CSCFs are usually needed
to interface with IMS and nonâ€‘IMS networks. The CSCF interfacing with IMS
networks implicitly trusts all IMS networks reachable via the SEG that
establishes security according to TS 33.210 [5]. A Relâ€‘5 CSCF always assumes
this trust relationship and network configuration. For a Relâ€‘6 CSCF, this
implicit trust setting shall be a configuration option, that an operator can
set according to his network and interface configuration.
# 6 Security mechanisms
## 6.1 Authentication and key agreement
### 6.1.0 General
The scheme for authentication and key agreement in the IMS is called IMS AKA.
The IMS AKA achieves mutual authentication between the ISIM and the HN, cf.
figure 1. The identity used for authenticating a subscriber is the private
identity, IMPI, which has the form of a NAI, cf. TS 23.228 [3]. The HSS and
the ISIM share a long-term key associated with the IMPI.
The HN shall choose the IMS AKA scheme for authenticating an IM subscriber
accessing through UMTS. The security parameters e.g. keys generated by the IMS
AKA scheme are transported by SIP.
Note 1: The above statement conflicts with the use of GIBA as an allowed
mechanism for UMTS access.
The generation of the authentication vector AV that includes RAND, XRES, CK,
IK and AUTN shall be done in the same way as specified in TS 33.102 [1]. The
ISIM and the HSS keep track of counters SQN~ISIM~ and SQN~HSS~ respectively.
The requirements on the handling of the counters and mechanisms for sequence
number management are specified in TS 33.102 [1]. The AMF field can be used in
the same way as in TS 33.102 [1].
Furthermore two pairs of (unilateral) security associations (SAs) are
established between the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF for each registered contact. The
subscriber may have several IMPUs associated with one IMPI. These may belong
to the same or different service profiles. Only two pairs of SAs shall be
active between the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF for each registered contact. These two
pairs of SAs shall be updated when a new successful authentication of the
registered contact of for the subscriber has occurred, cf. clause 7.4.
NOTE 2: An authenticated emergency registration creates a separate registered
contact from a normal registration and will therefore have two separate pairs
of (unilateral) SAs for the emergency registration. The same applies when
multiple registrations by the same UE are used using the Outbound mechanism
according to TS 24.229 [8].
It is the policy of the HN that decides if an authentication shall take place
for the registration of different IMPUs e.g. belonging to same or different
service profiles. Regarding the definition of service profiles cf. TS 23.228
[3].
### 6.1.1 Authentication of an IM-subscriber
Before a user can get access to the IM services at least one IMPU needs to be
registered and the IMPI authenticated in the IMS at application level. In
order to get registered the UE sends a SIP REGISTER message towards the SIP
registrar server i.e. the Sâ€‘CSCF, cf. figure 1, which will perform the
authentication of the user. The message flows are the same regardless of
whether the user has an IMPU already registered or not.

subscriber and successful mutual authentication with no synchronization error

SMn stands for SIP Message n and CMm stands for Cx message m which has a
relation to the authentication process:
+----------------------+ | SM1: | | | | REGISTER(IMPI, IMPU) | +----------------------+
In SM2 and SM3 the Pâ€‘CSCF and the Iâ€‘CSCF respectively forwards the SIP
REGISTER towards the Sâ€‘CSCF.
After receiving SM3, if the IMPU is not currently registered at the Sâ€‘CSCF,
the Sâ€‘CSCF needs to set the registration flag at the HSS to initial
registration pending. This is done in order to handle UE terminated calls
while the initial registration is in progress and not successfully completed.
The registration flag is stored in the HSS together with the Sâ€‘CSCF name and
user identity, and is used to indicate whether a particular IMPU of the user
is unregistered or registered at a particular Sâ€‘CSCF or if the initial
registration at a particular Sâ€‘CSCF is pending. The registration flag is set
by the Sâ€‘CSCF sending a Cx-Put to the HSS. If the IMPU is currently
registered, the Sâ€‘CSCF shall leave the registration flag set to _registered_.
At this stage the HSS has performed a check that the IMPI and the IMPU belong
to the same user.
Upon receiving the SIP REGISTER the Sâ€‘CSCF CSCF shall use an Authentication
Vector (AV) for authenticating and agreeing a key with the user. If the Sâ€‘CSCF
has no valid AV then the Sâ€‘CSCF shall send a request for AV(s) to the HSS in
CM1 together with the number m of AVs wanted where m is at least one.
+--------------------+---+ | CM1: | | | | | | Cx-AV-Req(IMPI, m) | | +--------------------+---+
Upon receipt of a request from the Sâ€‘CSCF, the HSS sends an ordered array of
_n_ authentication vectors to the Sâ€‘CSCF using CM2. The authentication vectors
are ordered based on sequence number. Each authentication vector consists of
the following components: a random number RAND, an expected response XRES, a
cipher key CK, an integrity key IK and an authentication token AUTN. Each
authentication vector is good for one authentication and key agreement between
the Sâ€‘CSCF and the IMS user.
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+---+ | CM2: | | | | | | Cx-AV-Req-Resp(IMPI, | | | RAND1\|\|AUTN1\|\| | | | XRES1\|\|CK1\|\|IK1,....,RANDn\|\|AUTNn\|\|XRESn\|\|CKn\|\|IKn) | | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+---+
When the Sâ€‘CSCF needs to send an authentication challenge to the user, it
selects the next authentication vector from the ordered array, i.e.
authentication vectors in a particular Sâ€‘CSCF are used on a first-in / first-
out basis.
The Sâ€‘CSCF sends a SIP 4xx Auth_Challenge i.e. an authentication challenge
towards the UE including the challenge RAND, the authentication token AUTN in
SM4. It also includes the integrity key IK and the cipher key CK for the
Pâ€‘CSCF. RFC 3310 [17] and RFC 4169 [65] specifies how to populate the
parameters of an authentication challenge. The Sâ€‘CSCF shall offer both
\"AKAv2-SHA-256\" [65] and \"AKAv1-MD5\" [17] starting with \"AKAv2-SHA-256\"
as most preferred. The Sâ€‘CSCF also stores the RAND sent to the UE for use in
case of a synchronization failure. To maintain backwards compatibility with
pre Rel-17 releases, \"AKAv1-MD5\" is supported but not recommended to use.
The verification of the SQN by the USIM and ISIM will cause the UE to reject
an attempt by the Sâ€‘CSCF to re-use a AV. Therefore no AV shall be sent more
than once.
NOTE: This does not preclude the use of the normal SIP transaction layer re-
transmission procedures.
+-----------------------------------------------+ | SM4: | | | | 4xx Auth_Challenge(IMPI, RAND, AUTN, IK, CK) | +-----------------------------------------------+
When the Pâ€‘CSCF receives SM5 it shall store the key(s) and remove that
information and forward the rest of the message to the UE i.e.
+---------------------------------------+ | SM6: | | | | 4xx Auth_Challenge(IMPI, RAND, AUTN) | +---------------------------------------+
Upon receiving the challenge, SM6, the UE takes the AUTN, which includes a MAC
and the SQN. The UE calculates the XMAC and checks that XMAC=MAC and that the
SQN is in the correct range as in TS 33.102 [1]. If both these checks are
successful the UE selects the first algorithm it supports and uses RES and
some other parameters to calculate an authentication response. The UE needs to
support \"AKAv2-SHA-256\".This response is put into the Authorization header
and sent back to the registrar in SM7. RFC 4169 [65] and RFC 3310 [17] specify
how to populate the parameters of the response for \"AKAv2-SHA-256\" and
\"AKAv1-MD5\" respectively. It should be noted that the UE at this stage also
computes the session keys CK and IK. To maintain backwards compatibility,
\"AKAv1-MD5\" is supported but not recommended to use.
+-----------------------------------------+ | SM7: | | | | REGISTER(IMPI, Authentication response) | +-----------------------------------------+
The Pâ€‘CSCF forwards the authentication response in SM8 to the Iâ€‘CSCF, which
queries the HSS to find the address of the Sâ€‘CSCF. In SM9 the Iâ€‘CSCF forwards
the authentication response to the Sâ€‘CSCF.
Upon receiving SM9 containing the response, the Sâ€‘CSCF retrieves the active
XRES for that user and uses this to check the authentication response sent by
the UE as described in RFC 3310 [17] and RFC 4169 [65]. If the check is
successful then the user has been authenticated and the IMPU is registered in
the Sâ€‘CSCF. If the IMPU was not currently registered, the Sâ€‘CSCF shall send a
Cx-Put to update the registration-flag to _registered_. If the IMPU was
currently registered the registration-flag is not altered.
It shall be possible to implicitly register IMPU(s). (see clause 4.3.3.4 in TS
23.228 [3]). All the IMPU(s) being implicitly registered shall be delivered by
the HSS to the Sâ€‘CSCF and subsequently to the Pâ€‘CSCF. The Sâ€‘CSCF shall regard
all implicitly registered IMPU(s) as registered IMPU(s).
When an IMPU has been registered this registration will be valid for some
period of time. Both the UE and the Sâ€‘CSCF will keep track on a timer for this
purpose but the expiration time in the UE is smaller than the one in the
Sâ€‘CSCF in order to make it possible for the UE to be registered and reachable
without interruptions. A successful registration of a previously registered
IMPU (including implicitly registered IMPUs) means the expiry time of the
registration is refreshed.
If the user has been successfully authenticated, the Sâ€‘CSCF sends a SM10 SIP
2xx Auth_OK message to the I-CSCF indicating that the registration was
successful. In SM11 and SM12 the Iâ€‘CSCF and the Pâ€‘CSCF respectively forward
the SIP 2xx Auth_OK towards the UE.
It should be noted that the UE initiated re-registration opens up a potential
denial-of-service attack. That is, an attacker could try to register an
already registered IMPU and respond with an incorrect authentication response
in order to make the HN de-register the IMPU. For this reason a subscriber,
when registered, shall not be de-registered if it fails an authentication.
The lengths of the IMS AKA parameters are specified in clause 6.3.7 of TS
33.102 [1].
### 6.1.2 Authentication failures
#### 6.1.2.1 User authentication failure
In this case the authentication of the user should fail at the Sâ€‘CSCF due an
incorrect response (received in SM9). However, if the response is incorrect,
then the IK used to protect SM7 will normally be incorrect as well, which will
normally cause the integrity check at the Pâ€‘CSCF to fail before the response
can be verified at Sâ€‘CSCF. In this case SM7 is discarded by the IPsec layer at
the Pâ€‘CSCF.
If the integrity check passes but the response is incorrect, the message flows
are identical up to and including SM9 as a successful authentication. Once the
Sâ€‘CSCF detects the user authentication failure it should proceed in the same
way as having received SM9 in a network authentication failure (see clause
6.1.2.2).
#### 6.1.2.2 Network authentication failure
In this clause the case when the authentication of the network is not
successful is specified. When the check of the MAC in the UE fails the network
can not be authenticated and hence registration fails. The flow is identical
as for the successful registration in 6.1.1 up to SM6.
{width="4.9944444444444445in" height="3.7444444444444445in"}
Figure 5
The UE shall send a Register message towards the HN including an indication of
the cause of failure in SM7. The Pâ€‘CSCF and the Iâ€‘CSCF forward this message to
the Sâ€‘CSCF.
+---------------------------------------------------+ | SM7: | | | | REGISTER(Failure = _AuthenticationFailure_ , IMPI) | +---------------------------------------------------+
Upon receiving SM9, which includes the cause of authentication failure, the
Sâ€‘CSCF shall clear the S-CSCF name in the HSS, if the IMPU is currently _Not
registered_. To clear the S-CSCF name the Sâ€‘CSCF sends in CM3 a Cx-Put to the
HSS. The Sâ€‘CSCF does not update the registration flag.
+------------------------------------+ | CM3: | | | | Cx-AV-Put(IMPI, Clear Sâ€‘CSCF name) | +------------------------------------+
The HSS responds to CM3 with a Cx-Put-Resp in CM4.
In SM10 the Sâ€‘CSCF sends a 4xx Auth_Failure towards the UE indicating that
authentication has failed, no security parameters shall be included in this
message.
+---------------------------+ | SM10: | | | | SIP/2.0 4xx Auth_Failure | +---------------------------+
#### 6.1.2.3 Incomplete authentication
When the Sâ€‘CSCF receives a new REGISTER request and challenges this request,
it considers any previous authentication to have failed. It shall delete any
information relating to the previous authentication, although the Sâ€‘CSCF may
send a response if the previous challenge is answered. A challenge to the new
request proceeds as described in clause 6.1.1.
If the Sâ€‘CSCF does not receive a response to an authentication challenge
within an acceptable time, it considers the authentication to have failed. The
update to the HSS is performed in the same way as if receiving an SM9
indicating authentication failure (see message CM3 in clause 6.1.2.2).
### 6.1.3 Synchronization failure
In this clause the case of an authenticated registration with synchronization
failure is described. After re-synchronization, authentication may be
successfully completed, but it may also happen that in subsequent attempts
other failure conditions (i.e. user authentication failure, network
authentication failure) occur. In below only the case of synchronization
failure with subsequent successful authentication is shown. The other cases
can be derived by combination with the flows for the other failure conditions.
{width="4.9944444444444445in" height="3.7444444444444445in"}
Figure 6
The flow equals the flow in 6.1.1 up to SM6. When the UE receives SM6 it
detects that the SQN is out of range and sends a synchronization failure back
to the Sâ€‘CSCF in SM7. RFC 3310 [17] describes the fields to populate
corresponding parameters of synchronization failure.
+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | SM7: | | | | REGISTER(Failure = _Synchronization Failure,_ AUTS, IMPI _)_ | +-------------------------------------------------------------+
Upon receiving the _Synchronization Failure_ and the AUTS the Sâ€‘CSCF sends an
Av-Req to the HSS in CM3 including the RAND stored by the Sâ€‘CSCF and the
required number of Avs, m.
+-------------------------------+ | CM3: | | | | Cx-AV-Req(IMPI, RAND,AUTS, m) | +-------------------------------+
The HSS checks the AUTS as in clause 6.3.5 of TS 33.102 [1]. After potentially
updating the SQN, the HSS sends new AVs to the Sâ€‘CSCF in CM4.
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+---+ | CM4: | | | | | | Cx-AV-Req-Resp(IMPI, | | | n,RAND~1~\|\|AUTN~1~\|\|XRES~1~\|\|CK~1~ | | | \|\|IK~1~,....,RAND~n~\|\|AUTN~n~\|\|XRES~n~\|\|CK~n~\|\|IK~n~) | | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+---+
When the Sâ€‘CSCF receives the new batch of authentication vectors from the HSS
it deletes the old ones for that user in the Sâ€‘CSCF.
The rest of the messages i.e. SM10-SM18 including the Cx messages are exactly
the same as SM4-SM12 and the corresponding Cx messages in 6.1.1.
### 6.1.4 Network Initiated authentications
In order to authenticate an already registered user, the Sâ€‘CSCF shall send a
request to the UE to initiate a re-registration procedure. When received at
the Sâ€‘CSCF, the re-registration shall trigger a new IMS AKA procedure that
will allow the Sâ€‘CSCF to re-authenticate the user.
{width="3.8555555555555556in" height="2.8833333333333333in"}
Figure 7
The UE shall initiate the re-registration on the reception of the
Authentication Required indication. In the event that the UE does not initiate
the re-registration procedure after the request from the Sâ€‘CSCF, the Sâ€‘CSCF
may decide to de-register the subscriber or re-issue an Authentication-
Required.
### 6.1.5 Integrity protection indicator
In order to decide whether a REGISTER request from the UE needs to be
authenticated, the Sâ€‘CSCF needs to know about the integrity protection applied
to the message. The Pâ€‘CSCF attaches an indication to the REGISTER request to
inform the Sâ€‘CSCF that the message was integrity protected if:
\- the Pâ€‘CSCF receives a REGISTER containing an authentication response and
the message is protected with an SA created during this authentication
procedure; or
\- the Pâ€‘CSCF receives a REGISTER not containing an authentication response
and the message is protected with an SA created by latest successful
authentication (from the Pâ€‘CSCF perspective).
For all other REGISTER requests the Pâ€‘CSCF attaches an indication that the
REGISTER request was not integrity protected.
## 6.2 Confidentiality mechanisms
If the local policy in Pâ€‘CSCF requires the use of IMS specific confidentiality
protection mechanism between UE and Pâ€‘CSCF, IPsec ESP as specified in RFC 4303
[54] shall provide confidentiality protection of SIP signalling between the UE
and the Pâ€‘CSCF, protecting all SIP signalling messages at the IP level. IPsec
ESP general concepts on Security Policy management, Security Associations and
IP traffic processing as described in reference RFC 4301 [53] shall also be
considered. ESP confidentiality shall be applied in transport mode between UE
and Pâ€‘CSCF. Dummy packets (Next Header = 59) shall not be sent.
> NOTE: For interoperability with 3GPP pre-Release 11 implementations, usage
> of dummy packets is not allowed.
The method to set up ESP security associations (SAs) during the SIP
registration procedure is specified in clause 7. As a result of an
authenticated registration procedure, two pairs of unidirectional SAs between
the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF all shared by TCP and UDP, shall be established in the
Pâ€‘CSCF and later in the UE. One SA pair is for traffic between a client port
at the UE and a server port at the Pâ€‘CSCF and the other SA is for traffic
between a client port at the Pâ€‘CSCF and a server port at the UE. For a
detailed description of the establishment of these security associations see
clause 7.
The encryption key CK~ESP~ is the same for the two pairs of simultaneously
established SAs. The encryption key CK~ESP~ is obtained from the keying
material established as a result of the AKA procedure, specified in clause
6.1, using a suitable key expansion function. . This key expansion function
depends on the ESP encryption algorithm and is specified in Annex I of this
specification.
The encryption key expansion on the user side is done in the UE. The
encryption key expansion on the network side is done in the Pâ€‘CSCF.
## 6.3 Integrity mechanisms
IPsec ESP as specified in reference RFC 4303 [54] shall provide integrity
protection of SIP signalling between the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF, protecting all SIP
signalling messages at the IP level. IPsec ESP general concepts on Security
Policy management, Security Associations and IP traffic processing as
described in reference RFC 4301 [53] shall also be considered. ESP integrity
shall be applied between UE and Pâ€‘CSCF either in transport mode if no NAT is
present or -- if NAT traversal shall be supported -- in UDP encapsulated
tunnel mode. ESP integrity can be provided by an integrity algorithm or an
authenticated encryption algorithm, see IETF RFC 4106 [73].
The method to set up ESP security associations (SAs) during the SIP
registration procedure is specified in clause 7. As a result of an
authenticated registration procedure, two pairs of unidirectional SAs between
the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF, all shared by TCP and UDP, shall be established in the
Pâ€‘CSCF and later in the UE. One SA pair is for traffic between a client port
at the UE and a server port at the Pâ€‘CSCF and the other SA is for traffic
between a client port at the Pâ€‘CSCF and a server port at the UE. For a
detailed description of the establishment of these security associations see
clause 7.
The integrity key IK~ESP~ is the same for the two pairs of simultaneously
established SAs. The integrity key IK~ESP~ is obtained from the keying
material established as a result of the AKA procedure, specified in clause
6.1, using a suitable key expansion function. This key expansion function
depends on the ESP integrity algorithm and is specified in Annex I of this
specification.
The integrity key expansion on the user side is done in the UE. The integrity
key expansion on the network side is done in the Pâ€‘CSCF.
The anti-replay service shall be enabled in the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF on all
established SAs.
## 6.4 Hiding mechanisms
The Hiding Mechanism is optional for implementation. All I-CSCFs/IBCFs in the
HN shall share the same encryption and decryption key Kv. If the mechanism is
used and the operator policy states that the topology shall be hidden the
I-CSCF/IBCF shall encrypt the hiding information elements when the I-CSCF/IBCF
forwards SIP Request or Response messages outside the hiding network's domain.
The hiding information elements are entries in SIP headers, such as Via,
Record-Route, Route and Path, which contain addresses of SIP proxies in hiding
network. When I-CSCF/IBCF receives a SIP Request or Response message from
outside the hiding network's domain, the I-CSCF/IBCF shall decrypt those
information elements that were encrypted by I-CSCF/IBCF in this hiding network
domain.
The purpose of encryption in network hiding is to protect the identities of
the SIP proxies and the topology of the hiding network. Therefore, an
encryption algorithm in confidentiality mode shall be used. The network hiding
mechanism will not address the issues of authentication and integrity
protection of SIP headers. The AES in CBC mode with 128-bit block and 128-bit
key shall be used as the encryption algorithm for network hiding. In the CBC
mode under a given key, if a fixed IV is used to encrypt two same plaintexts,
then the ciphertext blocks will also be equal. This is undesirable for network
hiding. Therefore, random IV shall be used for each encryption. The same IV is
required to decrypt the information. The IV shall be included in the same SIP
header that includes the encrypted information.
## 6.5 CSCF interoperating with proxy located in a non-IMS network
SIP signalling protected by TLS specified in RFC 3261 [6] may be used for
protecting the SIP interoperation between an IMS CSCF with a proxy/CSCF
located in a foreign network. The CSCF may request the TLS connection with a
foreign Proxy by publishing sips: URI in DNS server, that can be resolved via
NAPTR/SRV mechanism specified in RFC 3263 [23]. When sending/receiving the
certificate during the TLS handshaking phase, the CSCF shall verify the name
on the certificate against the list of the interworking partners.
The TLS session could be initiated from either network. A TLS connection is
capable of carrying multiple SIP dialogs.
Applying this method is to prevent attacks on SIP level, but it does not
prohibit other security methods to be applied so as to strengthen the security
for IP based networks. This part is specified in Annex A of TS 33.210 [5].
NOTE: NOTE 1 in clause 5.1.4 on the use of TLS also applies here.
# 7 Security association set-up procedure
## 7.0 General
The security association set-up procedure is necessary in order to decide what
security services to apply and when the security services start. In the IMS
authentication of users is performed during registration as specified in
clause 6.1. Subsequent signalling communications in this session will be
integrity protected based on the keys derived during the authentication
process.
## 7.1 Security association parameters
For protecting IMS signalling between the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF it is necessary to
agree on shared keys that are provided by IMS AKA, and a set of parameters
specific to a protection method. The security mode setup (cf. clause 7.2) is
used to negotiate the SA parameters required for IPsec ESP with authentication
and confidentiality, in accordance with the provisions in clauses 5.1.3,
5.1.4, 6.2, and 6.3.
The SA parameters that shall be negotiated between UE and Pâ€‘CSCF in the
security mode set-up procedure are:
**\- Encryption algorithm**
Both the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF shall adhere to the profiling given in clause 5.3.3
of 33.210 [5] with the addition that only algorithms that can be signalled
according to Annex H needs to be supported.
**\- Integrity algorithm**
Both the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF shall adhere to the profiling given in clause 5.3.4
of 33.210 [5] with the addition that only algorithms that can be signalled
according to Annex H needs to be supported.
NOTE 1: What is called \"authentication algorithm\" in RFC 4303 [54] is called
\"integrity algorithm\" in this specification in order to be in line with the
terminology used in other 3GPP specifications and, in particular, to avoid
confusion with the authentication algorithms used in the AKA protocol.
NOTE 2: If one of the two integrity algorithms is compromised then it suffices
for the IMS to remain secure that the algorithm is no longer supported by any
Pâ€‘CSCF. The security mode set-up procedure (cf. clause 7.2) will then ensure
that some other integrity algorithm is selected.
**\- SPI (Security Parameter Index)**
The SPI is allocated locally for inbound SAs. The triple (SPI, destination IP
address, security protocol) uniquely identifies an SA at the IP layer. The UE
shall select the SPIs uniquely, and different from any SPIs that might be used
in any existing SAs (i.e. inbound and outbound SAs). The SPIs selected by the
Pâ€‘CSCF shall be different than the SPIs sent by the UE, cf. clause 7.2. In an
authenticated registration, the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF each select two SPIs, not
yet associated with existing inbound SAs, for the new inbound security
associations at the UE \'s client and server ports and the Pâ€‘CSCF \'s client
and server ports respectively.
NOTE 3: This allocation of SPIs ensures that protected messages in the uplink
always differ from protected messages in the downlink in, at least, the SPI
field. This thwarts reflection attacks. When several applications use IPsec on
the same physical interface the SIP application should be allocated a separate
range of SPIs.
**The following SA parameters are not negotiated:**
\- Life type: the life type is always seconds;
\- SA duration: the SA duration has a fixed length of 2^32^-1;
NOTE 4: The SA duration is a network layer concept. From a practical point of
view, the value chosen for \"SA duration\" does not impose any limit on the
lifetime of an SA at the network layer. The SA lifetime is controlled by the
SIP application as specified in clause 7.4.
\- Mode: transport mode;
\- Key length: the length of the integrity key IK~ESP~ depends on the
integrity algorithm, c.f. Annex I.
\- Key length: the length of the encryption key depends on the encryption
algorithm, c.f. Annex I.
**Selectors:**
The security associations (SA) have to be bound to specific parameters
(selectors) of the SIP flows between UE and Pâ€‘CSCF, i.e. source and
destination IP addresses, transport protocols that share the SA, and source
and destination ports.
\- IP addresses are bound to two pairs of SAs, as in clause 6.3, as follows:
\- inbound SA at the Pâ€‘CSCF:\ The source and destination IP addresses
associated with the SA are identical to those in the header of the IP packet
in which the initial SIP REGISTER message was received by the Pâ€‘CSCF.
\- outbound SA at the Pâ€‘CSCF:\ the source IP address bound to the outbound SA
equals the destination IP address bound to the inbound SA;\ the destination IP
address bound to the outbound SA equals the source IP address bound to the
inbound SA.
NOTE 5: This implies that the source and destination IP addresses in the
header of the IP packet in which the protected SIP REGISTER message was
received by the Pâ€‘CSCF need to be the same as those in the header of the IP
packet in which the initial SIP REGISTER message was received by the Pâ€‘CSCF.
\- The transport protocol selector shall allow UDP and TCP.
\- Ports:
1\. The Pâ€‘CSCF associates two ports, called _port_ps_ and _port_pc_ , with
each pair of security associations established in an authenticated
registration. The ports _port_ps_ and _port_pc_ are different from the
standard SIP ports 5060 and 5061. No unprotected messages shall be sent from
or received on the ports _port_ps_ and _port_pc_. From a security point of
view, unprotected messages may be received on any port which is different from
the ports _port_ps_ and _port_pc_. The number of the ports _port_ps_ and
_port_pc_ are communicated to the UE during the security mode set-up
procedure, cf. clause 7.2. These ports are used with both, UDP and TCP. The
use of these ports may differ for TCP and UDP, as follows:
**UDP case:** the Pâ€‘CSCF receives requests and responses protected with ESP
from any UE on the port _port_ps_ (the\"protected server port\"). The Pâ€‘CSCF
sends requests and responses protected with ESP to a UE on the port _port_pc_
(the \"protected client port\").
**TCP case:** the P-CSCF, if it does not have a TCP connection from its
_port_pc_ to the _port_us_ of the UE, shall set up a TCP connection from its
_port_pc_ to the port _port_us_ of the UE before sending a request to it.
NOTE 6: Both the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF may set up a TCP connection from their
client port to the other end\'s server port on demand. An already existing TCP
connection from their client port to the other end's server port is reused by
both the Pâ€‘CSCF or the UE for sending SIP requests by client and SIP responses
by server; but it is not mandatory to maintain such TCP connection longer than
required in RFC 3261 [6].
NOTE 7: The protected server port _port_ps_ stays fixed for a UE until all
IMPUs from this UE are deâ€‘registered. It may be fixed for a particular Pâ€‘CSCF
over all UEs, but there is no need to fix the same protected server port for
different Pâ€‘CSCFs.
NOTE8: The distinction between the UDP and the TCP case reflects the different
behaviour of SIP over UDP and TCP, as specified in section 18 of RFC 3261 [6].
2\. The UE associates two ports, called _port_us_ and _port_uc_ , with each
pair of security associations established in an authenticated registration.
The ports _port_us_ and _port_uc_ are different from the standard SIP ports
5060 and 5061. No unprotected messages shall be sent from or received on the
ports _port_us_ and _port_uc_. From a security point of view, unprotected
messages may be received on any port which is different from the ports
_port_us_ and _port_uc_. The number of the ports _port_us_ and _port_uc_ are
communicated to the P-CSCF during the security mode set-up procedure, cf.
clause 7.2. These ports are used with both, UDP and TCP. The use of these
ports may differ for TCP and UDP, as follows:
**UDP case:** the UE receives requests and responses protected with ESP on the
port _port_us_ (the\"protected server port\"). The UE sends requests and
responses protected with ESP on the port _port_uc_ (the \"protected client
port\").
**TCP case:** the UE, if it does not have a TCP connection towards the Pâ€‘CSCF
yet, shall set up a TCP connection to the port _port_ps_ of the Pâ€‘CSCF before
sending a request to it.
NOTE 9: Both the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF may set up a TCP connection from their
client port to the other end\'s server port on demand. An already existing TCP
connection may be reused by both the Pâ€‘CSCF or the UE, but it is not
mandatory.
NOTE 10: The protected server port _port_us_ stays fixed for a UE until all
IMPUs from this UE are de-registered.
NOTE 11: The distinction between the UDP and the TCP case reflects the
different behaviour of SIP over UDP and TCP, as specified in section 18 of RFC
3261 [6]
3\. The Pâ€‘CSCF is allowed to receive only REGISTER messages, messages relating
to emergency services in accordance with TS 23.167 [31] and TS 24.229 [8], and
error messages related to unprotected messages on unprotected ports. All other
messages not arriving on a protected port shall be either discarded or
rejected by the Pâ€‘CSCF.
4\. The UE is allowed to receive only the following messages on an unprotected
port:
\- responses to unprotected REGISTER messages;
\- messages relating to emergency services in accordance with TS 23.167 [31]
and TS 24.229 [8];
\- error messages related to unprotected messages.
All other messages not arriving on a protected port shall be rejected or
silently discarded by the UE.
The following rules apply:
1\. For each unidirectional SA which has been established and has not expired,
the SIP application at the Pâ€‘CSCF stores at least the following data:
(UE_IP_address, UE_protected_port, P-CSCF_protected_port, SPI, IMPI, IMPU1,
... , IMPUn, lifetime) in an \"SA_table\". The pair (UE_protected_port,
P-CSCF_protected_port) equals either (_port_uc_ , _port_ps_) or (_port_us_ ,
_port_pc_).
NOTE 12: The SPI is only required when initiating and deleting SAs in the
Pâ€‘CSCF. The SPI is not exchanged between IPsec and the SIP layer for incoming
or outgoing SIP messages.
2\. The SIP application at the Pâ€‘CSCF shall check upon receipt of a protected
REGISTER message that the source IP address in the packet headers coincide
with the UE's IP address inserted in the Via header of the protected REGISTER
message. If the Via header does not explicitly contain the UE\'s IP address,
but rather a symbolic name then the Pâ€‘CSCF shall first resolve the symbolic
name by suitable means to obtain an IP address.
3\. The SIP application at the Pâ€‘CSCF shall check upon receipt of an initial
REGISTER message or a re-REGISTER message that the pair (UE_IP_address,
UE_protected_client_port), where the UE_IP_address is the source IP address in
the packet header and the protected client port is sent as part of the
security mode set-up procedure (cf. clause 7.2), has not yet been associated
with entries in the \"SA_table\". Furthermore, the Pâ€‘CSCF shall check that,
for any one IMPI, no more than six SAs per direction are stored at any one
time. If these checks are unsuccessful the registration is aborted and a
suitable error message is sent to the UE.
NOTE 13: According to clause 7.4 on SA handling, at most six SAs per direction
per registered contact may exist at a Pâ€‘CSCF for one IMPI at any one time.
4\. For each incoming protected message the SIP application at the Pâ€‘CSCF
shall verify that the correct inbound SA according to clause 7.4 on SA
handling has been used. The SA is identified by the triple (UE_IP_address,
UE_protected_port, Pâ€‘CSCF_protected_port) in the \"SA_table\". The SIP
application at the Pâ€‘CSCF shall further ensure that the user associated with
the SA, which was used to protect the incoming message from the UE, is
identical to the user who is associated at SIP level with the message sent by
the P-CSCF towards the network.
NOTE 14: Not all SIP messages necessarily contain public or private
identities, e.g. subsequent messages in a dialogue. Other information, e.g. a
dialogue identifier, may be used to associate the message with a user at SIP
level.
5\. For each unidirectional SA which has been established and has not expired,
the SIP application at the UE stores at least the following data:
(UE_protected_port, Pâ€‘CSCF_protected_port, SPI, lifetime) in an \"SA_table\".
The pair (UE_protected_port, Pâ€‘CSCF_protected_port) equals either (_port_uc,
port_ps_) or (_port_us, port_pc_).
NOTE 15: The SPI is only required to initiate and delete SAs in the UE. The
SPI is not exchanged between IPsec and the SIP layer for incoming or outgoing
SIP messages.
6\. When establishing a new pair of SAs (cf. clause 6.3) the SIP application
at the UE shall ensure that the selected numbers for the protected ports do
not correspond to an entry in the \"SA_table\".
NOTE 16: Regarding the selection of the number of the protected port at the UE
it is generally recommended that the UE randomly selects the number of the
protected port from a sufficiently large set of numbers not yet allocated at
the UE. This is to thwart a limited form of a Denial of Service attack. UMTS
PS access link security also helps to thwart this attack.
7\. For each incoming protected message the SIP application at the UE shall
verify that the correct inbound SA according to clause 7.4 on SA handling has
been used. The SA is identified by the pair (UE_protected_port,
Pâ€‘CSCF_protected_port) in the \"SA table\".
NOTE 17: If the integrity check of a received packet fails then IPsec will
automatically discard the packet.
## 7.2 Set-up of security associations (successful case)
The set-up of security associations is based on RFC 3329 [21]. Annex H of this
specification shows how to use RFC 3329 [21] for the set-up of security
associations.
In this clause the normal case is specified i.e. when no failures occurs. Note
that for simplicity some of the nodes and messages have been omitted. Hence
there are gaps in the numbering of messages, as the Iâ€‘CSCF is omitted.
{width="4.9944444444444445in" height="3.7444444444444445in"}
Figure 8
The UE sends a Register message towards the Sâ€‘CSCF to register the location of
the UE and to set-up the security mode, cf. clause 6.1. In order to start the
security mode set-up procedure, the UE shall include a _Security-setup_ -line
in this message.
The _Security-setup-line_ in SM1 contains the Security Parameter Index
(SPI)values and the protected ports selected by the UE. The UE includes two
unique ports (one client and one server port) and two unique SPIs (one
associated to the client port, and one associated to the server port) in the
REGISTER.It also contains a list of identifiers for the integrity and
encryption algorithms, which the UE supports.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | [SM1:]{.underline} | | | | REGISTER(Security-setup = _SPI_U, Port_U, UE integrity and | | encryption algorithms list)_ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
SPI_U is the symbolic name of a pair of SPI values (cf. clause 7.1) (spi_uc,
spi_us) that the UE selects. _spi_uc_ is the SPI of the inbound SA at UE's the
protected client port, and _spi_us_ is the SPI of the inbound SA at the UE's
protected server port. The syntax of spi_uc and spi_us are defined in Annex H.
NOTE 1: The syntax defined in Annex H allows a large freedom of number of
SPIs. Only one pair of unique SPIs is included in the Security-setup.
Port_U is the symbolic name of a pair of port numbers (_port_uc, port_us_) as
defined in clause 7.1. The syntax of port_uc and port_us is defined in Annex
H.
NOTE 2: The syntax defined in Annex H allows a large freedom of number of
ports. Only one pair of unique ports is included in the Security-setup.Upon
receipt of SM1, the Pâ€‘CSCF temporarily stores the parameters received in the
_Security-setup_ -_line_ together with the UE's IP address from the source IP
address of the IP packet header, the IMPI and IMPU. Upon receipt of SM4, the
Pâ€‘CSCF adds the keys IK~IM~ and CK~IM~ received from the Sâ€‘CSCF to the
temporarily stored parameters.
The Pâ€‘CSCF then selects the SPIs for the inbound SAs. The Pâ€‘CSCF shall define
the SPIs such that they are unique and different from any SPIs as received in
the _Security-setup-line_ from the UE.
NOTE 3: This rule is needed since the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF use the same key for
inbound and outbound traffic.
In order to determine the integrity and encryption algorithm the Pâ€‘CSCF
proceeds as follows: the Pâ€‘CSCF has a list of integrity and encryption
algorithms it supports, ordered by priority. The Pâ€‘CSCF selects the first
algorithm combination on its own list which is also supported by the UE. If
the UE did not include any confidentiality algorithm in SM1 then the P-CSCF
shall either select the NULL encryption algorithm or abort the procedure,
according to its policy on confidentiality.
NOTE 4: It should be noted that, if the P-CSCF policy requires
confidentiality, then all UEs with no encryption support would be denied
access to the IMS network. This would apply in particular to UEs, which
support only a Release 5-version of this specification or only GIBA according
to Annex T of this specification.
The Pâ€‘CSCF then establishes two new pairs of SAs in the local security
association database.
The _Security-setup-_ line in SM6 contains the SPIs and the ports assigned by
the Pâ€‘CSCF. It also contains a list of identifiers for the integrity and
encryption algorithms, which the Pâ€‘CSCF supports. The only exception from this
is the case that the Pâ€‘CSCF is configured to never apply confidentiality. In
this case, it shall not include encryption algorithms to the _Security-setup-_
line in SM6.
NOTE 5: The Pâ€‘CSCF may be configured to never apply confidentiality, e.g.
because it trusts the encryption provided by the underlying access network. If
the P-CSCF is configured to apply confidentiality whenever the UE supports it
then the P-CSCF always includes the encryption algorithms in SM6, which it
supports, even if the UE did not include encryption algorithms in SM1. This is
to thwart bidding down attacks.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | [SM6:]{.underline} | | | | 4xx Auth_Challenge(Security-setup = _SPI_P, Port_P_ , _Pâ€‘CSCF | | integrity and encryption algorithms list)_ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
SPI_P is the symbolic name of the pair of SPI values (cf. clause 7.1)
(_spi_pc, spi_ps_) that the Pâ€‘CSCF selects. _spi_pc_ is the SPI of the inbound
SA at the Pâ€‘CSCF's protected client port, and _spi_ps_ is the SPI of the
inbound SA at the Pâ€‘CSCF's protected server port. The syntax of spi __pc_ and
_spi_ps_ is defined in Annex H.
Port_P is the symbolic name of the port numbers (_port_pc_ , _port_ps_) as
defined in clause 7.1. The syntax of Port_P is defined in Annex H.
Upon receipt of SM6, the UE determines the integrity and encryption algorithms
as follows: the UE selects the first integrity and encryption algorithm
combination on the list received from the Pâ€‘CSCF in SM 6 which is also
supported by the UE. If the P-CSCF did not include any confidentiality
algorithm in SM6 then the UE shall select the NULL encryption algorithm.
NOTE 6: Release 5 UE will not support any encryption algorithms, and will
choose the first Release 5 integrity algorithm on the list received from the
Pâ€‘CSCF in SM6.
The UE then proceeds to establish two new pairs of SAs in the local SAD.
The UE shall integrity and confidentiality protect SM7 and all following SIP
messages. Furthermore the integrity and encryption algorithms list, _SPI_P,_
and _Port_P_ received in SM6, and _SPI_U, Port_U sent in SM1_ shall be
included:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | [SM7:]{.underline} | | | | REGISTER(Security-setup = _SPI_U, Port_U, SPI_P, Port_P_ , | | _Pâ€‘CSCF integrity and encryption algorithms list)_ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
After receiving SM7 from the UE, the Pâ€‘CSCF shall check whether the integrity
and encryption algorithms list, _SPI_P_ and _Port_P_ received in SM7 is
identical with the corresponding parameters sent in SM6. It further checks
whether _SPI_U_ and _Port_U_ received in SM7 are identical with those received
in SM1. If these checks are not successful the registration procedure is
aborted. The Pâ€‘CSCF shall include in SM8 information to the Sâ€‘CSCF that the
received message from the UE was integrity protected as indicated in clause
6.1.5. The Pâ€‘CSCF shall add this information to all subsequent REGISTER
messages received from the UE that have successfully passed the integrity
check in the Pâ€‘CSCF.
+-------------------------------------------------------+ | [SM8:]{.underline} | | | | REGISTER(Integrity-Protection = _Successful,_ IMPI _)_ | +-------------------------------------------------------+
The Pâ€‘CSCF finally sends SM12 to the UE. SM12 does not contain information
specific to security mode setup (i.e. a Security-setup line), but with sending
SM12 not indicating an error the Pâ€‘CSCF confirms that security mode setup has
been successful. After receiving SM12 not indicating an error, the UE can
assume the successful completion of the security-mode setup.
An example of how to make use of two pairs of unidirectional SAs is
illustrated in figure 9 with a set of example message exchanges protected by
the respective IPsec SAs where the INVITE and following messages are assumed
to be carried over TCP.
Figure 9
## 7.3 Error cases in the set-up of security associations
### 7.3.1 Error cases related to IMS AKA
#### 7.3.1.0 General
Errors related to IMS AKA failures are specified in clause 6.1. However, this
clause additionally describes how these shall be treated, related to security
setup.
#### 7.3.1.1 User authentication failure
In this case, SM7 fails integrity check by IPsec at the Pâ€‘CSCF if the IK~IM~
derived from RAND at UE is wrong. The SIP application at the Pâ€‘CSCF never
receives SM7. It shall delete the temporarily stored SA parameters associated
with this registration after a time-out.
In case IK~IM~ was derived correctly, but the response was wrong the
authentication of the user fails at the Sâ€‘CSCF due to an incorrect response.
The Sâ€‘CSCF shall send a 4xx Auth_Failure message to the UE, via the Pâ€‘CSCF,
which may pass through an already established SA. Afterwards, both, the UE and
the Pâ€‘CSCF shall delete the new SAs.
#### 7.3.1.2 Network authentication failure
If the UE is not able to successfully authenticate the network, the UE shall
send a REGISTER message which may pass through an already established SA,
indicating a network authentication failure, to the Pâ€‘CSCF. The Pâ€‘CSCF deletes
the new SAs after receiving this message.
#### 7.3.1.3 Synchronisation failure
In this situation, the UE observes that the AUTN sent by the network in SM6
contains an out-of-range sequence number. The UE shall send a REGISTER message
to the Pâ€‘CSCF, which may pass through an already established SA, indicating
the synchronization failure. The Pâ€‘CSCF deletes the new SAs after receiving
this message.
#### 7.3.1.4 Incomplete authentication
If the UE responds to an authentication challenge from a Sâ€‘CSCF, but does not
receive a reply before the request times out, the UE shall start a
registration procedure if it still requires any IM services. The first message
in this registration should be protected with an SA created by a previous
successful authentication if one exists.
When the Pâ€‘CSCF receives a challenge from the Sâ€‘CSCF and creates the
corresponding SAs during a registration procedure, it shall delete any
information relating to any previous registration procedure (including the SAs
created during the previous registration procedure).
If the Pâ€‘CSCF deletes a registration SA due to its lifetime being exceeded,
the Pâ€‘CSCF should delete any information relating to the registration
procedure that created the SA.
### 7.3.2 Error cases related to the Security-Set-up
#### 7.3.2.1 Proposal unacceptable to Pâ€‘CSCF
In this case the Pâ€‘CSCF cannot accept the proposal set sent by the UE in the
Security-Set-up command of SM1. The Pâ€‘CSCF shall respond to SM1 indicating a
failure, by sending an error response to the UE.
#### 7.3.2.2 Proposal unacceptable to UE
If the Pâ€‘CSCF sends in the security-setup line of SM6 a proposal that is not
acceptable for the UE, the UE shall abandon the registration procedure.
#### 7.3.2.3 Failed consistency check of Security-Set-up lines at the Pâ€‘CSCF
The Pâ€‘CSCF shall check whether authentication and encryption algorithms list
received in SM7 is identical with the authentication and encryption algorithms
list sent in SM6. If this is not the case the registration procedure is
aborted. (Cf. clause 7.2).
## 7.4 Authenticated re-registration
### 7.4.0 General
Every registration that includes a user authentication attempt produces new
security associations. If the authentication is successful, then these new
security associations shall replace the previous ones. This clause describes
how the UE and Pâ€‘CSCF handle this replacement and which SAs to apply to which
message.
When security associations are changed in an authenticated re-registration
then the protected server ports at the UE (_port_us_) and the Pâ€‘CSCF
(_port_ps_) shall remain unchanged, while the protected client ports at the UE
(_port_uc_) and the Pâ€‘CSCF (_port_pc_) shall change. For the definition of
these ports see clause 7.1.
If the UE has an already active pair of security associations, then it shall
use this to protect the REGISTER message. If the Sâ€‘CSCF is notified by the
Pâ€‘CSCF that the REGISTER message from the UE was integrity-protected it may
decide not to authenticate the user by means of the AKA protocol. However, the
UE may send unprotected REGISTER messages at any time. In this case, the
Sâ€‘CSCF shall authenticate the user by means of the AKA protocol. In
particular, if the UE considers the SAs no longer active at the Pâ€‘CSCF, e.g.,
after receiving no response to several protected messages, then the UE should
send an unprotected REGISTER message.
Security associations may be unidirectional or bi-directional. This clause
assumes that security associations are unidirectional, as this is the general
case. For IP layer SAs, the lifetime mentioned in the following clauses is the
lifetime held at the application layer. Furthermore deleting an SA means
deleting the SA from both the application and IPsec layer. The message
numbers, e.g. SM1, used in the following clauses relate to the message flow
given in clause 6.1.1.
### 7.4.1 Void
### 7.4.1a Management of security associations in the UE
The UE shall be involved in only one registration procedure at a time, i.e.
the UE shall remove any data relating to any previous incomplete registrations
or authentications, including any SAs created by an incomplete authentication.
The UE may start a registration procedure with two existing pairs of SAs.
These will be referred to as the old SAs. The authentication produces two
pairs of new SAs. These new SAs shall not be used to protect non-
authentication traffic until noted during the authentication flow. In the same
way, certain messages in the authentication shall be protected with a
particular SA. If the UE receives a message protected with the incorrect SA,
it shall discard the message.
A successful authentication proceeds in the following steps:
\- The UE sends the SM1 message to register with the IMS. If SM1 was
protected, it shall be protected with the old outbound SA.
\- The UE receives an authentication challenge in a message (SM6) from the
Pâ€‘CSCF. This message shall be protected with the old inbound SA if SM1 was
protected and unprotected otherwise.
\- If this message SM6 can be successfully processed by the UE, the UE creates
the new SAs, which are derived according to clause 7.1. The lifetime of the
new SAs shall be set to allow enough time to complete the registration
procedure. The UE then sends its response (SM7) to the Pâ€‘CSCF, which shall be
protected with the new outbound SA. Meanwhile, if SM1 was protected, the UE
shall use the old SAs for messages other than those in the authentication,
until a successful message of new authentication is received (SM12); if SM1
was unprotected, the UE is not allowed to use IMS service until it receives an
authentication successful message (SM12).
\- The UE receives an authentication successful message (SM12) from the
Pâ€‘CSCF. It shall be protected with the new inbound SA.
\- After the successful processing of this message by the UE, the registration
is complete. The UE sets the lifetime of the new SAs such that it either
equals the latest lifetime of the old SAs or it will expire shortly after the
registration timer in the message, depending which gives the SAs the longer
life. For further SIP messages sent from UE, the new outbound SAs are used,
with the following exception: when a SIP message is part of a pending SIP
transaction it may still be sent over the old SA. A SIP transaction is called
pending if it was started using an old SA. When a further SIP message
protected with a new inbound SA is successfully received from the Pâ€‘CSCF, then
the old SAs shall be deleted as soon as either all pending SIP transactions
have been completed, or have timed out. The old SAs shall be always deleted
when the lifetime is expired. This completes the SA handling procedure for the
UE.
A failure in the authentication can occur for several reasons. If the SM1 was
not protected, then no protection shall be applied to the failure messages,
except the user authentication failure message which shall be protected with
the new SA. If SM1 was protected, the old SAs shall be used to protect the
failure messages. In both cases, after processing the failure message, the UE
shall delete the new SAs.
The UE shall monitor the expiry time of registrations without an
authentication and if necessary increase the lifetime of the SAs created by
the last successful authentication such that it will expire shortly after the
registration timer in the message.
NOTE: In particular this means that the lifetime of a SA is never decreased.
The UE shall delete any SA whose lifetime is exceeded. The UE shall delete all
SAs it holds once all the IMPUs are de-registered.
### 7.4.2 Void
### 7.4.2a Management of security associations in the Pâ€‘CSCF
When the Sâ€‘CSCF initiates an authentication by sending a challenge to the UE,
the Pâ€‘CSCF may already contain existing SAs from previously completed
authentications. It may also contain two existing pairs of SAs from an
incomplete authentication. These will be referred to as the old and
registration SAs respectively. The authentication produces two pairs of new
SAs. These new SAs shall not be used to protect non-authentication traffic
until noted during the authentication flow. Similarly certain messages in the
authentication shall be protected with a particular SA. If the Pâ€‘CSCF receives
a message protected with the incorrect SA, it shall discard the message.
The Pâ€‘CSCF associates the IMPI given in the registration procedure and all the
successfully registered IMPUs related to that IMPI to an SA.
A successful authentication proceeds in the following steps:
\- The Pâ€‘CSCF receives the SM1 message. If SM1 is protected, it shall be
protected with the old inbound SA.
\- The Pâ€‘CSCF forwards the message containing the challenge (SM6) to the UE.
This shall be protected with the old outbound SA, if SM1 was protected and
unprotected otherwise.
\- The Pâ€‘CSCF then creates the new SAs, which are derived according to clause
7.1. The expiry time of the new SAs shall be set to allow enough time to
complete the registration procedure. The registration SAs shall be deleted if
they exist.
\- The Pâ€‘CSCF receives the message carrying the response (SM7) from the UE. It
shall be protected using the new inbound SA. If SM1 was protected, the old SAs
are used to protect messages other than those in the authentication.
\- The Pâ€‘CSCF forwards the successful registration message (SM12) to the UE.
It shall be protected using the new outbound SA. This completes the
registration procedure for the Pâ€‘CSCF. The Pâ€‘CSCF sets the expiry time of the
new SAs such that they either equals the latest lifetime of the old SAs or it
will expire shortly after the registration timer in the message, depending
which gives the SAs the longer life.
\- After SM12 is sent, the Pâ€‘CSCF handles the UE related SAs according to
following rules:
\- If there are old SAs, but SM1 belonging to the same registration procedure
was received unprotected, the Pâ€‘CSCF considers error cases happened, and
assumes UE does not have those old SAs for use. In this case the Pâ€‘CSCF shall
remove the old SAs.
\- If SM1 belonging to the same registration procedure was protected with an
old valid SA, the Pâ€‘CSCF keeps this inbound SA and the corresponding three SAs
created during the same registration with the UE active, and continues to use
them. Any other old SAs are deleted. When the old SAs have only a short time
left before expiring or a further SIP message protected with a new inbound SA
is successfully received from the UE, the Pâ€‘CSCF starts to use the new SAs for
outbound messages with the following exception: when a SIP message is part of
a pending SIP transaction it may still be sent over the old SA. A SIP
transaction is called pending if it was started using an old SA. The old SAs
are then deleted as soon as all pending SIP transactions have been completed,
or have timed out. The old SAs are always deleted when the old SAs lifetime
are expired. When the old SAs expire without a further SIP message protected
by the new SAs, the new SAs are taken into use for outbound messages. This
completes the SA handling procedure for the Pâ€‘CSCF.
A failure in the authentication can occur for several reasons. If the SM1 was
not protected, then no protection shall be applied to the failure messages,
except the user authentication failure message which shall be protected with
the new SAs. If SM1 was protected, the old SAs shall be used to protect the
failure messages. In both cases, after processing the failure message, the
Pâ€‘CSCF shall delete the new SAs.
The Pâ€‘CSCF shall monitor the expiry time of registrations without an
authentication and if necessary increase the lifetime of SAs created by the
last successful authentication such that it will expire shortly after the
registration timer in the message.
The Pâ€‘CSCF shall delete any SA whose lifetime is exceeded. The P-CSCF shall
delete all SAs it holds that are associated with a particular IMPI once all
the associated IMPUs are de-registered.
## 7.5 Rules for security association handling when the UE changes IP address
When a UE changes its IP address, e.g. by using the method described in RFC
8981 [81], then the UE shall delete the existing SA\'s and initiate an
unprotected registration procedure using the new IP address as the source IP
address in the packets carrying the REGISTER messages.
# 8 ISIM
## 8.0 General
For the purposes of this document the ISIM is a term that indicates the
collection of IMS security data and functions on a UICC. The following
implementation options are permitted:
\- Use of a distinct ISIM application on a UICC which does not share security
functions with the USIM;
\- Use of a distinct ISIM application on a UICC which does share security
functions with the USIM;
\- Use of a USIM application on a UICC.
NOTE 1: For later releases other implementations of ISIM are foreseen to be
permitted.
NOTE 2: The distinction between the terms "ISIM" and "ISIM application" is
useful for the purpose of describing the IMS security architecture. However,
in other 3GPP specifications these terms are used as synonyms, i.e. the term
"ISIM" always refers to the ISIM application in the UICC, as defined in [51].
The case of using a USIM application is always handled separately in other
specifications.
If there is an ISIM application and a USIM application on a UICC, then the
ISIM application shall always be used for IMS authentication.
There shall only be one ISIM for each IMPI. The IMS subscriber shall not be
able to modify or enter the IMPI. The IMS subscriber shall not be able to
modify or enter the Home Domain Name.
## 8.1 Requirements on the ISIM application
This clause identifies requirements on the ISIM application to support IMS
access security. It does not identify any data or functions that may be
required on the ISIM application for non-security purposes.
The ISIM application shall include:
\- The IMPI;
\- At least one IMPU;
\- Home Network Domain Name;
\- Support for sequence number checking in the context of the IMS Domain;
\- The same framework for algorithms as specified for the USIM applies for the
ISIM;
\- An authentication Key.
The ISIM shall deliver the CK to the UE although it is not required that SIP
signalling is confidentiality protected.
At UE power off the existing SAs in the MT shall be deleted. The session keys
and related information in the SA shall never be stored on the ISIM.
## 8.2 Sharing security functions and data with the USIM
When an ISIM application is used for IMS access, only the following options
for sharing security functions and data are permitted:
\- No security functions or data are shared;
\- Only the sequence number checking mechanism is shared;
\- Only the algorithm is shared;
\- Only the algorithm and sequence number checking mechanism are shared;
\- The authentication key, authentication functions and the sequence number
checking mechanism are shared.
When a USIM is used for IMS access, only the following option is applicable:
\- The authentication key, authentication functions and the sequence number
checking mechanism are shared.
NOTE: If the authentication keys and functions are shared, the
cipher/integrity key sets generated during authentication are used with
different cipher/integrity algorithms in CS/PS domain and IMS. Note that the
same cipher/integrity key set is never used for both CS/PS domain and IMS
because the authentication and key agreement protocol is run independently
between CS/PS domain and IMS. Therefore there is no danger that the compromise
of the cipher/integrity algorithm in one domain would lead to vulnerabilities
in the other domain.
If the mechanism and data for checking sequence numbers are shared then it
shall be required for the authentication failure rate due to synchronization
failures to be kept sufficiently low. In particular, the mechanism shall be
required to support interleaving authentication in three domains (CS, PS and
IMS). Example methods to achieve this are described in Annex G.
# 9 IMC
This clause identifies requirements on the IMC to support IMS access security.
The IMC is used to enable access using IMS AKA. The IMC may be used for IMS
access by a non-3GPP-only terminal when specified in the access specific
annexes of this specification. The IMC shall not used if ISIM or USIM is
present.
NOTE 1: a non-3GPP-only terminal is a terminal that does not support 3GPP
access technology.
This clause does not identify any data or functions that may be required on
the IMC for non-security purposes. The IMC shall not be part of ISIM, USIM nor
SIM.
The IMC shall include:
\- The IMPI;
\- At least one IMPU;
\- Home Network Domain Name;
\- Support for sequence number checking in the context of the IMS Domain;
\- The same framework for algorithms as specified in TS 33.102 [1];
\- An authentication key.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Void
###### ## Annex B (informative): Void
###### ## Annex C (informative): Void
###### ## Annex D (informative): Void
###### ## Annex E (informative): Void
###### ## Annex F (informative): Void
###### ## Annex G (informative): Management of sequence numbers
The example sequence number management schemes in TS 33.102 [1] Informative
Annex C can be used to ensure that the authentication failure rate due to
synchronization failures to kept sufficiently low when the same sequence
number mechanism and data is used for authentication in the PS/CS domains and
in the IMS. This can be done by enhancing the method for the allocation of
index values in the AuC/HSS so that authentication vectors distributed to
different service domains shall always have different index values (i.e.
separate ranges of index values are reserved for PS, CS and IMS operation).
The AuC/HSS is required to obtain information about which type of service node
has requested the authentication vectors. Reallocation of array elements to
the IMS domain can be done in the AuC/HSS with no changes required to already
deployed USIMs.
As the possibility for out of order use of authentication vectors within the
IMS service domain may be quite low, the number of PS or CS array elements
that need to be reallocated to the IMS domain could be quite small. This means
that the ability to support out of order authentication vectors within the PS
and CS domains would not be significantly affected.
Sequence number management is operator specific and for some proprietary
schemes over the air updating of the UICC may be needed.
###### ## Annex H (normative): The use of \"Security Mechanism Agreement for
SIP Sessions\" [21] for security mode set-up
The BNF syntax of RFC 3329 [21] is defined for negotiating security
associations for semi-manually keyed IPsec or TLS in the following way:
security-client = \"Security-Client\" HCOLON sec-mechanism *(COMMA sec-
mechanism)
security-server = \"Security-Server\" HCOLON sec-mechanism *(COMMA sec-
mechanism)
security-verify = \"Security-Verify\" HCOLON sec-mechanism *(COMMA sec-
mechanism)
sec-mechanism = mechanism-name *(SEMI mech-parameters)
mechanism-name = \"ipsec-3gpp\" / \"tls\"
mech-parameters = ( preference / algorithm / protocol / mode / encrypt-
algorithm / spiâ€‘c / spiâ€‘s / portâ€‘c / portâ€‘s )
preference = \"q\" EQUAL qvalue
qvalue = ( \"0\" [ \".\" 0*3DIGIT ] ) / ( \"1\" [ \".\" 0*3(\"0\") ] )
algorithm = \"alg\" EQUAL (\"hmac-sha-1-96\" / \"aes-gmac\" / \"null\" )
protocol = \"prot\" EQUAL ( \"ah\" / \"esp\" )
mode = \"mod\" EQUAL ( \"trans\" / \"tun\" / \"UDP-enc-tun\" )
encrypt-algorithm = \"ealg\" EQUAL (\"aes-cbc\" / \"aes-gcm\" / \"null\" )
spiâ€‘c = \"spiâ€‘c\" EQUAL spivalue
spiâ€‘s = \"spiâ€‘s\" EQUAL spivalue
spivalue = 10DIGIT; 0 to 4294967295
portâ€‘c = \"portâ€‘c\" EQUAL port
portâ€‘s = \"portâ€‘s\" EQUAL port
port = 1*DIGIT
The changes compared to RFC 3329 [21] are:
\"alg\" parameter: Addition of \"aes-gmac\" and \"null\". Removal of \"hmac-
md5-96\"
\"ealg\" parameter: Addition of \"aes-cbc\" and \"aes-gcm\". Removal of \"des-
ede3-cbc\"
\"mod\" parameter: Addition of \"UDP-enc-tun\"
\"Hmac-sha-1-96\" and \"aes-cbc\" are not recommended.
The use of security association parameters is specified in clauses 7.1, 7.2,
M.7.1 and M.7.2 of the present document. The parameters described by the BNF
above have the following semantics:
Mechanism-name: For manually keyed IPsec, this field includes the value
\"ipsec-3gpp\". \"ipsecâ€‘3gpp\" mechanism extends the general negotiation
procedure of RFC 3329 [21] in the following way:
1 The server shall store the Security-Client header received in the request
before sending the response with the Security-Server header.
2 The client shall include the Security-Client header in the first protected
request. In other words, the first protected request shall include both
Security-Verify and Security-Client header fields.
3 The server shall check that the content of Security-Client headers received
in previous steps (1 and 2) are the same.
> Mech-parameters: Of the mech-parameters, only preference is relevant when
> the mechanism-name has the value \"tls\".
Preference: As defined in RFC 3329 [21].
Algorithm: Defines the authentication algorithm. The algorithm parameter is
mandatory. The value \"aes-gmac\" refers to the authentication algorithm
ENCR_NULL_AUTH_AES_GMAC defined in IETF RFC 4543 [74]. The value \"null\"
shall only be used with encryption algorithm \"aes-gcm\".
Protocol: Defines the IPsec protocol. May have a value \"ah\" or \"esp\". If
no Protocol parameter is present, the value will be \"esp\".
NOTE 1: According to clause 6 only \"esp\" (RFC 4303 [54]) is allowed for use
in IMS.
Mode: Defines the mode in which the IPsec protocol is used. May have a value
\"trans\" for transport mode, and value \"tun\" for tunneling mode. If no Mode
parameter is present, the value will be \"trans\".
NOTE 2: Void.
Encrypt-algorithm: If present, defines the encryption algorithm. The value
\"aes-cbc\" refers to the algorithm defined in IETF RFC 3602 [22]. The value
\"aes-gcm\" refers to the encryption algorithm AES-GCM with a 16 octet ICV
defined in IETF RFC 4106 [73]. If no Encrypt-algorithm parameter is present,
the algorithm will be \"null\". The value \"aes-gcm\" shall only be used with
authentication algorithm equal to \"null\".
Spiâ€‘c: Defines the SPI number of the inbound SA at the protected client port.
Spiâ€‘s: Defines the SPI number of the inbound SA at the protected server port.
Portâ€‘c: Defines the protected client port.
Portâ€‘s: Defines the protected server port.
It is assumed that the underlying IPsec implementation supports selectors that
allow all transport protocols supported by SIP to be protected with a single
SA.
###### ## Annex I (normative): Key expansion functions for IPsec ESP
**Integrity Keys:**
If the selected authentication algorithm is HMAC-SHA-1-96 then IK~ESP~ is
obtained from IK~IM~ by appending 32 zero bits to the end of IK~IM~ to create
a 160â€‘bit string.
If selected authentication algorithm is AES-GMAC as specified in RFC 4543 [74]
with 128 bit key then IK~ESP~ = IK~IM.~
The salt value specified in Section 3.2 of RFC 4543 [74] shall be derived
using the key derivation function KDF defined in Annex B of TS 33.220 [66].
The input Key to the KDF function shall be equal to the concatenation of
CK~IM~ and IK~IM~: CK~IM~ \|\| IK~IM~. The input S to the KDF function shall
be formed from the following parameters:
\- FC = 0x58.
\- P0 = \"AES_GMAC_SALT\" .
\- L0 = length of the string "AES_GMAC_SALT" (i.e. 0x00 0x0D).
The salt value shall consist of the 32 least significant bits of the 256 bits
of the KDF output.
\"Hmac-sha-1-96\" is not recommended.
**Encryption Keys:**
If selected encryption algorithm is AESâ€‘CBC as specified in RFC 3602 [22] with
128 bit key then CK~ESP~ = CK~IM\ .~
If selected encryption algorithm is AESâ€‘GCM as specified in RFC 4106 [73] with
128 bit key then CK~ESP~ = CK~IM.~ The salt value specified in Section 4 of
RFC 4106 [73] shall be derived using the key derivation function KDF defined
in Annex B of TS 33.220 [66]. The input Key to the KDF function shall be equal
to the concatenation of CK~IM~ and IK~IM~: CK~IM~ \|\| IK~IM~. The input S to
the KDF function shall be formed from the following parameters:
\- FC = 0x59
\- P0 = "AES_GCM_SALT"
\- L0 = length of the string "AES_GCM_SALT" (i.e. 0x00 0x0C)
The salt value shall consist of the 32 least significant bits of the 256 bits
of the KDF output.
\"aes-cbc\" is not recommended.
###### ## Annex J (informative): Recommendations to protect the IMS from UEs
bypassing the Pâ€‘CSCF
After the UE does a successful SIP REGISTER with the Pâ€‘CSCF, malicious UE
could try to send SIP messages directly to the Sâ€‘CSCF. This could imply that
the UE would be able to bypass the integrity protection provided by IPsec ESP
between the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF.
NOTE: The TS 24.229 [8] defines a trust domain that consists of the Pâ€‘CSCF,
the Iâ€‘CSCF, the Sâ€‘CSCF, the BGCF, the MGCF, the MRFC and all the AS:s that are
not provided by 3rd party service providers. There are nodes in the edge of
the trust domain that are allowed to provide with an asserted identity header.
The nodes in the trust domain will trust SIP messages with asserted identity
headers. The asserted identity information is useful as long as the interfaces
in an operator's network can be trusted.
If a UE manages to bypass the Pâ€‘CSCF it presents at least the following
problems:
1) The Pâ€‘CSCF is not able to generate any charging information.
2) Malicious UE could masquerade as some other user (e.g. it could potentially
send INVITE or BYE messages).
The following recommendations for preventing attacks based on such misbehavior
are given:
\- Access to Sâ€‘CSCF entities shall be restricted to the core network entities
that are required for IMS operation, only. It shall be ensured that no UE is
able to directly send IP packets to IMS-entities other than the required ones,
ie. assigned Pâ€‘CSCF, or HTTP servers.
\- Impersonation of IMS core network entities at IP level (IP spoofing),
especially impersonation of Pâ€‘CSCFs by UEs shall be prevented.
\- It is desirable to have a general protection mechanism against UEs spoofing
(source) IP addresses in any access network providing access to IMS services.
If the traffic is between two nonâ€‘IMS CSCFs, it is recommended to use TLS
mechanisms as specified in RFC 3261 [6]. This will mitigate the problems
caused by misbehaviour of the UE. TLS certificate management as outlined in TS
33.310 [24] can be used between two non-IMS CSCFs. If neither intraâ€‘CSCF
traffic nor CSCF-SEG traffic can be trusted and if this traffic is not
protected by the NDS/IP, TS 33.210 [5] mechanisms, then physical protection
measures or IP traffic filtering should be applied. This is anyhow not in the
scope of 3GPP specification.
###### ## Annex K (informative): Void
###### ## Annex L (normative): Application to fixed broadband access
# L.1 Introduction
This Annex specifies how the material in the main body and other normative
Annexes of the present document apply to the TISPAN NGN (ETSI ES 282 001 [26]
).
> NOTE 1: NGN specific abbreviations and terminology can be found in ETSI ES
> 282 001 [26].
>
> NOTE 2 : In the context of this Annex the term NGN-UE denotes the UE as
> defined in ETSI ES 282 001 [26]
# L.2 Application of clause 4
In 3GPP IMS, the ISIM is mandated to be present on UICC which is usually
inserted within the MT component of the UE. In NGN-UEs, the ISIM shall be
provided on the UICC, which shall be inserted within either :
1) The TE; or
2) The IMS Residential Gateway (IRG).
NOTE: The exact definition of IRG can be found in ETSI TS 187 003 [57].
Where the TE and IRG each contain an UICC with an ISIM, the ISIM should be
used in following order of preference TE, IRG.
Figure L.1
Figure L.1 redraws figure 1 of the main body of the present document replacing
the 3GPP specific transport domain by Generic IP transport domain. The
following observations support figure L.1.
1) The IMS is independent of the transport network
2) Generic Entities (GE) equivalent to the 3GPP transport entities will be
present in the Generic IP transport domain.
3) In the NGN architecture the AuC/HSS functionality is performed by the UPSF.
4) The Security Associations (SA) (referring to the corresponding arrows in
Figure L.1) are retained:
a) SA-1, SA-3, SA-4 and SA-5 are endorsed by this annex
b) SA-2 is endorsed by this Annex with the extension to ensure transport
across NAT/Firewall boundaries.
There exist other interfaces and reference points in IMS, which have not been
addressed above. Those interfaces and reference points reside within the IMS,
either within the same security domain or between different security domains
(See figure L.2). The protection of all such interfaces and reference points
(which may include other subsystems) apart from the Gm reference point are
protected as specified in TS 33.210 [5].

###### ## Annex M (normative): Enhancements to the access security for IP
based services to enable NAT traversal for signaling messages
# M.0 General
NOTE: Annex M.x (x= 1, 2, ...) in this annex corresponds to clause x in the
body of this specification.
# M.1 Scope
It is assumed for the purposes of this annex that a NAT device may be located
between the UE and the P-CSCF. Only NATs outside the borders of an IMS network
are considered, i.e. NATs are assumed to be located at the subscriber\'s site
or in the access network. If there are multiple NATs in either of these
locations, it is assumed that their effect sums up in such a way that they can
be treated as a single NAT so that the mechanisms described below are still
valid.
In this annex enhancements to sections 4 through 8 of this specification are
specified that allow a UE and a P-CSCF to detect whether they are located
behind a NAT device, to inform each other about their NAT traversal
capabilities, and, if there is a NAT present, to securely communicate. If
there is no NAT device present, the procedures of sections 6, 7 and 8 apply.
Examples of subscribers who are, in general, located behind a NAT device
include subscribers accessing IMS via a DSL line.
Furthermore, this specification is restricted to the treatment of NAT
traversal for signalling messages. Measures required for NAT traversal of
media data are not considered in this specification. The general handling of
NAT traversal for signalling messages is specified in TS 23.228 [3] and TS
24.229 [8]. Additional procedures for NAT traversal for protected signalling
messages are specified in this specification.
It should be noted that many NAT routers in residential sites do also apply
port translation, which is typically denoted as Network Address and Port
Translation (NAPT). For reasons of simplicity the term NAT is used, no matter
whether only address or address and port translation is actually applied.
NOTE: this annex is fully compliant with RFC 3948 [28], but only partially
compliant with RFC 3947 [27] because 3GPP IMS security, as specified in this
specification (main body and annexes), does not use IKE as the key management
protocol for IPsec.

## M.6.2 Confidentiality mechanisms
If the local policy in Pâ€‘CSCF requires the use of IMS specific confidentiality
protection mechanism between UE and Pâ€‘CSCF, IPsec ESP as specified in RFC 4303
[54] shall provide confidentiality protection of SIP signalling between the UE
and the Pâ€‘CSCF, protecting all SIP signalling messages at the IP level. IPsec
ESP general concepts on Security Policy management, Security Associations and
IP traffic processing as described in reference RFC 4301 [53] shall also be
considered. ESP confidentiality shall be applied in transport mode between UE
and Pâ€‘CSCF either in transport mode if no NAT is present, or \-- if NAT
traversal shall be supported -- in UDP encapsulated tunnel mode. Dummy packets
(Next Header = 59) shall not be sent.
> NOTE: For interoperability with 3GPP pre-Release 11 implementations, usage
> of dummy packets is not allowed.
The method to set up ESP security associations (SAs) during the SIP
registration procedure is specified in clause M.7. As a result of an
authenticated registration procedure, two pairs of unidirectional SAs between
the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF all shared by TCP and UDP, shall be established in the
Pâ€‘CSCF and later in the UE. One SA pair is for traffic between a client port
at the UE and a server port at the Pâ€‘CSCF and the other SA is for traffic
between a client port at the Pâ€‘CSCF and a server port at the UE. For a
detailed description of the establishment of these security associations see
clause M.7.
The encryption key CK~ESP~ is the same for the two pairs of simultaneously
established SAs. The encryption key CK~ESP~ is obtained from the key CK~IM~
established as a result of the AKA procedure, specified in clause M.6.1, using
a suitable key expansion function.
The encryption key expansion on the user side is done in the UE. The
encryption key expansion on the network side is done in the Pâ€‘CSCF.
## M.6.3 Integrity mechanisms
IPsec ESP as specified in reference RFC 4303 [54] shall provide integrity
protection of SIP signalling between the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF, protecting all SIP
signalling messages at the IP level. IPsec ESP general concepts on Security
Policy management, Security Associations and IP traffic processing as
described in reference RFC 4301 [53] shall also be considered. ESP integrity
shall be applied between UE and Pâ€‘CSCF either in transport mode if no NAT is
present or -- if NAT traversal shall be supported -- in UDP encapsulated
tunnel mode.
The method to set up ESP security associations (SAs) during the SIP
registration procedure is specified in clause M.7. As a result of an
authenticated registration procedure, two pairs of unidirectional SAs between
the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF, all shared by TCP and UDP, shall be established in the
Pâ€‘CSCF and later in the UE. One SA pair is for traffic between a client port
at the UE and a server port at the Pâ€‘CSCF and the other SA is for traffic
between a client port at the Pâ€‘CSCF and a server port at the UE. For a
detailed description of the establishment of these security associations see
clause M.7.
The integrity key IK~ESP~ is the same for the two pairs of simultaneously
established SAs. The integrity key IK~ESP~ is obtained from the key IK~IM~
established as a result of the AKA procedure, specified in clause M.6.1, using
a suitable key expansion function. This key expansion function depends on the
ESP integrity algorithm and is specified in Annex I of this specification.
The integrity key expansion on the user side is done in the UE. The integrity
key expansion on the network side is done in the Pâ€‘CSCF.
The anti-replay service shall be enabled in the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF on all
established SAs.

## M.6.5 CSCF interoperating with proxy located in a non-IMS network
The text in section 6.5 applies without changes.
# M.7 Security association set-up procedure
## M.7.0 General
The security association set-up procedure is necessary in order to decide what
security services to apply and when the security services start. In the IMS
authentication of users is performed during registration as specified in
clause M.6.1. Subsequent signalling communications in this session will be
integrity protected based on the keys derived during the authentication
process.
## M.7.1 Security association parameters
For protecting IMS signalling between the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF it is necessary to
agree on shared keys that are provided by IMS AKA, and a set of parameters
specific to a protection method. The security mode setup (cf. clause M.7.2) is
used to negotiate the SA parameters required for IPsec ESP with authentication
and confidentiality, in accordance with the provisions in clauses 5.1.3,
5.1.4, M.6.2, and M.6.3.
The SA parameters that shall be negotiated between UE and Pâ€‘CSCF in the
security mode set-up procedure are:
**\- Encryption algorithm**
> **cf. clause 7.1**
**\- Integrity algorithm**
> **cf. clause 7.1**
**\- Mode**
> The IPsec SA mode of operation shall depend on whether the UE is located
> behind a NAT device or not. If the UE is located behind a NAT device UDP
> encapsulated tunnel mode according to RFC 3948 [28] shall be used. Otherwise
> transport mode shall be used. The set-up of security associations (cf.
> clause M.7.2) allows the P-CSCF to detect whether the UE is located behind a
> NAT or not.
**\- SPI (Security Parameter Index)**
> **cf. clause 7.1**
**The following SA parameters are not negotiated:**
> **cf. clause 7.1**
**Selectors if no NAT is present:**
**Cf. section 7.1**
**Selectors if a NAT is present:**
The security associations (SA) have to be bound to specific parameters
(selectors) of the SIP flows between UE and Pâ€‘CSCF, i.e. source and
destination IP addresses, transport protocols that share the SA, and source
and destination ports.
\- IP addresses are bound If a NAT is present, it is assumed that the UE is
configured locally with a (e.g. private) IP address. When the UE communicates
with the P-CSCF via the NAT device, the NAT allocates a binding, mapping the
local IP address to two pairs of SAs, asa publicly routable IP address (called
public IP address in the sequel) and perhaps also mapping the source port used
in clause 6.3, as follows:the UDP or TCP packet to another port number. In the
following, the term UE_IP_address always denotes the public IP address of the
UE.
NOTE: The IP addresses and ports used as selectors in IPsec tunnel mode are
those of the inner IP header, in accordance with RFC 4301 [53]. The inner IP
addresses are always the public IP addresses. Please also note that the
terminology used here may differ from that used in other scenarios, e.g. in
VPN access to a corporate network, as in the latter scenario the inner IP
address is not publicly routable in general.
\- IP addresses:
\- inbound SA at the Pâ€‘CSCF:\ The source and destination IP addresses
associated with the SA are identical to those in the header of the IP packet
in which the initial SIP REGISTER message was received by the Pâ€‘CSCF.
\- outbound SA at the Pâ€‘CSCF:\ the The source IP address bound to the outbound
SA equals the destination IP address bound to the inbound SA;\ the destination
IP address bound to the outbound SA equals the source IP address bound to the
inbound SA.
NOTE: This implies that the source and destination IP addresses in the header
of the inner IP packet in which the protected SIP REGISTER message was
received by the Pâ€‘CSCF need to be the same as those in the header of the IP
packet in which the initial SIP REGISTER message was received by the Pâ€‘CSCF.
NOTE: This further implies that the source address in the inbound SA and the
destination address in the outbound SA at the P-CSCF equals the public IP
address of the UE.
\- outbound SA at the UE:\ The source IP address bound to the outbound SA
equals the public IP address of the UE. The public IP address is learned by
the UE from the received parameter in the Via header in the 401 Unauthorized
response to the initial unprotected REGISTER Request (cf Section M.7.2).\ The
destination IP address bound to the outbound SA equals the destination IP
address in the header of the IP packet in which the initial SIP REGISTER was
sent to the P-CSCF.
\- inbound SA at the UE:\ The source IP address bound to the inbound SA equals
the destination IP address bound to the outbound SA;\ the destination IP
address bound to the inbound SA equals the source IP address bound to the
outbound SA.
NOTE: For the handling of the outer IP header in UDP encapsulated tunnel mode,
see section on \"**Data related to the use of UDP encapsulated tunnel mode\"
below.**
\- The transport protocol selector shall allow UDP and TCP.
\- Ports:
1\. The Pâ€‘CSCF associates two ports, called _port_ps_ and _port_pc_ , with
each pair of security associations established in an authenticated
registration. The ports _port_ps_ and _port_pc_ are different from the
standard SIP ports 5060 and 5061. No unprotected messages shall be sent from
or received on the ports _port_ps_ and _port_pc_. From a security point of
view, unprotected messages may be received on any port which is different from
the ports _port_ps_ and _port_pc_. The number of the ports _port_ps_ and
_port_pc_ are communicated to the UE during the security mode set-up
procedure, cf. clause 7.2. These ports are used with both, UDP and TCP. The
use of these ports may differ for TCP and UDP, as follows:
**UDP case:** the Pâ€‘CSCF receives requests and responses protected with ESP
from any UE on the port _port_ps_ (the\"protected server port\"). The Pâ€‘CSCF
sends requests and responses protected with ESP to a UE on the port _port_pc_
(the \"protected client port\").
**TCP case:** the Pï·“-CSCF, if it does not have a TCP connection towards the UE
yet, shall set up a TCP connection from its _port_pc_ to the port _port_us_ of
the UE before sending a request to it..
NOTE: Both the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF may set up a TCP connection from their client
port to the other end\'s server port on demand. An already existing TCP
connection may be reused by both the Pâ€‘CSCF or the UE; but it is not
mandatory.
NOTE: The protected server port _port_ps_ stays fixed for a UE until all IMPUs
from this UE are deâ€‘registered. It may be fixed for a particular Pâ€‘CSCF over
all UEs, but there is no need to fix the same protected server port for
different Pâ€‘CSCFs.
NOTE: The distinction between the UDP and the TCP case reflects the different
behaviour of SIP over UDP and TCP, as specified in section 18 of RFC 3261 [6].
NOTE: The handling of the protected ports is the same, irrespective of whether
transport or UDP encapsulated tunnel mode is used.
2\. The UE associates two ports, called _port_us_ and _port_uc_ , with each
pair of security associations established in an authenticated registration.
The ports _port_us_ and _port_uc_ are different from the standard SIP ports
5060 and 5061. No unprotected messages shall be sent from or received on the
ports _port_us_ and _port_uc_. From a security point of view, unprotected
messages may be received on any port which is different from the ports
_port_us_ and _port_uc_. The number of the ports _port_us_ and _port_uc_ are
communicated to the P-CSCF during the security mode set-up procedure, cf.
clause 7.2. These ports are used with both, UDP and TCP. The use of these
ports may differ for TCP and UDP, as follows:
**UDP case:** the UE receives requests and responses protected with ESP on the
port _port_us_ (the\"protected server port\"). The UE sends requests and
responses protected with ESP on the port _port_uc_ (the \"protected client
port\").
**TCP case:** the UE, if it does not have a TCP connection towards the Pâ€‘CSCF
yet, shall set up a TCP connection to the port _port_ps_ of the Pâ€‘CSCF before
sending a request to it.
NOTE: Both the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF may set up a TCP connection from their client
port to the other end\'s server port on demand. An already existing TCP
connection may be reused by both the Pâ€‘CSCF or the UE, but it is not
mandatory.
NOTE: The protected server port _port_us_ stays fixed for a UE until all IMPUs
from this UE are de-registered.
NOTE: The distinction between the UDP and the TCP case reflects the different
behaviour of SIP over UDP and TCP, as specified in section 18 of RFC 3261 [6]
NOTE: The handling of the protected ports is the same, irrespective of whether
transport or UDP encapsulated tunnel mode is used.
3\. The Pâ€‘CSCF is allowed to receive only REGISTER messages, messages relating
to emergency services in accordance with TS 23.167 [31] and TS 24.229 [8], and
error messages related to unprotected messages on unprotected ports. All other
messages not arriving on a protected port shall be either discarded or
rejected by the Pâ€‘CSCF.
4\. The UE is allowed to receive only the following messages on an unprotected
port:
\- responses to unprotected REGISTER messages;
\- messages relating to emergency services in accordance with TS 23.167 [31]
and TS 24.229 [8];
\- error messages related to unprotected messages.
All other messages not arriving on a protected port shall be rejected or
silently discarded by the UE.
**Data related to the use of UDP encapsulated tunnel mode**
\- Tunnel endpoint addresses and header construction for tunnel mode:
> In case UDP encapsulated tunnel mode is selected, an \"outer\" IP header is
> added to protected packets exchanged between UE and P-CSCF, following the
> rules of tunnel mode processing according to RFC 4301 53 []. While the IP
> addresses of the inner IP header are as specified above in the section about
> \"Selectors\", the IP addresses of the outer IP header shall be selected as
> follows:
>
> \- P-CSCF:\ For the outbound SA at the P-CSCF the source address shall be
> the IP address of the P-CSCF, the destination address shall be the public IP
> address of the UE. For the inbound SA only the destination address of the
> outer IP header is used to identify the SA at the P-CSCF, together with the
> SPI. This address is the IP address of the P-CSCF.
>
> \- UE:\ For the outbound SA at the UE the source address shall be the local
> IP address of the UE, the destination address shall be the address of the
> P-CSCF as in the destination address of the IP header of the initial
> unprotected REGISTER message. For the inbound SA only the destination
> address of the outer IP header is used to identify the SA at the UE. This
> address is the local IP address of the UE.
>
> Other data of the outer IP header (apart from IP addresses) shall be
> constructed as specified in RFC 4301 [53].
\- **Ports used in the encapsulating UDP header:**
> **In case UDP encapsulated tunnel mode is selected, an encapsulating UDP
> header is inserted after the outer IP header. With respect to the ports used
> in the UDP header, the following rules shall be applied in accordance with
> standard** IETF RFC 3948 **[28]:**
>
> **\- UE:\ Each protected and UDP encapsulated packet shall use port 4500 as
> source and destination port in the encapsulating UDP header.**
>
> **\- P-CSCF:\ When the UE sends an UDP encapsulated packet towards the
> P-CSCF with the ports as described in the previous paragraph, the NAT will
> change the source port to a port different from 4500. This port is called
> port_Uenc. When the P-CSCF receives the first protected and UDP encapsulated
> message from the UE it shall store port_Uenc (cf. Section 7.2). From then
> on, all protected UDP encapsulated messages from the P-CSCF to the UE shall
> use port 4500 as source port and port_Uenc as destination port in the
> encapsulating UDP header.**
The following rules apply:
1\. For each unidirectional SA which has been established and has not expired,
the SIP application at the Pâ€‘CSCF stores at least the following data:
(UE_IP_address, UE_protected_port, P-CSCF_protected_port, SPI, IMPI, IMPU1,
... , IMPUn, lifetime, mode) in an \"SA_table\". The pair (UE_protected_port,
P-CSCF_protected_port) equals either (_port_uc_ , _port_ps_) or (_port_us_ ,
_port_pc_).
NOTE: The SPI is only required when initiating and deleting SAs in the Pâ€‘CSCF.
The SPI is not exchanged between IPsec and the SIP layer for incoming or
outgoing SIP messages.
2\. The SIP application at the Pâ€‘CSCF shall check upon receipt of a protected
REGISTER message that the source IP address in the packet headers coincide
with the UE's IP address inserted in the Via header of the protected REGISTER
message. If the Via header does not explicitly contain the UE\'s IP address,
but rather a symbolic name then the Pâ€‘CSCF shall first resolve the symbolic
name by suitable means to obtain an IP address.
> 3\. The SIP application at the Pâ€‘CSCF shall check upon receipt of an initial
> REGISTER message or a re-REGISTER message that the pair (UE_IP_address,
> UE_protected_client_port), where the UE_IP_address is the source IP address
> in the packet header and the protected client port is sent as part of the
> security mode set-up procedure (cf. clause 7.2), has not yet been associated
> with entries in the \"SA_table\". In addition, if the P-CSCF has detected

> entries in the \"SA_table\". Here the UE_IP_address is the source IP address
> in the packet header, and the protected client and server ports are sent as
> part of the security mode set-up procedure (cf. clause 7.2).
NOTE: In case of multiple UEs behind the same NAT, the same public IP address
may be assigned by the NAT to two different UEs. Therefore, the P-CSCF shall
not accept registration attempts from UEs with the same address and protected
server port in order to ensure unambiguous addressing of SIP messages sent
towards the UE, using the protected server port.
> Furthermore, the Pâ€‘CSCF shall check that, for any one IMPI, no more than six
> SAs per direction are stored at any one time. If these checks are
> unsuccessful the registration is aborted and a suitable error message is
> sent to the UE.
NOTE: According to clause M.7.4 on SA handling, at most six SAs per direction
may exist at a Pâ€‘CSCF for one user at any one time.
4\. For each incoming protected message the SIP application at the Pâ€‘CSCF
shall verify that the correct inbound SA according to clause M.7.4 on SA
handling has been used. The SA is identified by the triple (UE_IP_address,
UE_protected_port, Pâ€‘CSCF_protected_port) in the \"SA_table\". The SIP
application at the Pâ€‘CSCF shall further ensure that the user associated with
the SA, which was used to protect the incoming message from the UE, is
identical to the user who is associated at SIP level with the message sent by
the P-CSCF towards the network.
NOTE: Not all SIP messages necessarily contain public or private identities,
e.g. subsequent messages in a dialogue. Other information, e.g. a dialogue
identifier, may be used to associate the message with a user at SIP level.
5\. For each unidirectional SA which has been established and has not expired,
the SIP application at the UE stores at least the following data:
(UE_IP_address, UE_protected_port, Pâ€‘CSCF_protected_port, SPI, lifetime, mode)
in an \"SA_table\". The pair (UE_protected_port, Pâ€‘CSCF_protected_port) equals
either (_port_uc, port_ps_) or (_port_us, port_pc_).
NOTE: The SPI is only required to initiate and delete SAs in the UE. The SPI
is not exchanged between IPsec and the SIP layer for incoming or outgoing SIP
messages.
> 6\. When establishing a new pair of SAs (cf. clause 6.3) the SIP application
> at the UE shall ensure that the selected numbers for the protected ports do
> not correspond to an entry in the \"SA_table\". Furthermore, the UE should
> select port numbers (pseudo-)randomly from a sufficiently large set of
> numbers not yet allocated at the UE. When the UE receives an error message
> indicating a collision of a pair (IP address, port), according to rule 3
> above, the UE may retry the registration with differently selected port
> numbers.
NOTE: The UE should select port numbers (pseudo-)randomly for two reasons:\ 1)
to avoid collisions of pairs (IP address, port) at the P-CSCF, cf. rule 3
above.\ 2) to thwart a limited form of a Denial of Service attack. UMTS/LTE PS
access link security also helps to thwart this attack.
NOTE: The (pseudo-)randomization of port numbers is meant for both initial
registrations and re-registrations
7\. For each incoming protected message the SIP application at the UE shall
verify that the correct inbound SA according to clause M.7.4 on SA handling
has been used. The SA is identified by the pair (UE_protected_port,
Pâ€‘CSCF_protected_port) in the \"SA table\".
NOTE: If the integrity check of a received packet fails then IPsec will
automatically discard the packet.
## M.7.2 Set-up of security associations (successful case)
The set-up of security associations is based on RFC 3329 [21]. Annex H of this
specification shows how to use RFC 3329 [21] for the set-up of security
associations.
In this clause the normal case is specified i.e. when no failures occurs. Note
that for simplicity some of the nodes and messages have been omitted. Hence
there are gaps in the numbering of messages, as the Iâ€‘CSCF is omitted.
For the purpose of the description of the message processing in case UDP
encapsulated tunnel mode is used, a conceptual functional element called \"UDP
encapsulation function\" is used. The UDP encapsulation function handles all
tasks relevant to the UDP encapsulation processing, i.e. the addition and
removal of UDP headers to packets. In that sense it does not perform any IPsec
processing as such. From an implementation point of view, it is immaterial
whether the UDP encapsulation function and the IPsec processing are combined
or kept separate. On the network side, the UDP encapsulation function may
reside on the P-CSCF or in a separate device.
**Relation of this Annex with the NAT traversal functionality specified in TS
24.229 [8]:**

Figure M.8
The UE sends a Register message towards the Sâ€‘CSCF to register the location of
the UE and to set-up the security mode, cf. clause M.6.1. In order to start
the security mode set-up procedure, the UE shall include a _Security-setup_
-line in this message.
The _Security-setup-line_ in SM1 contains the Security Parameter Index (SPI)
values and the protected ports selected by the UE. The UE includes two unique
ports (one client and one server port) and two unique SPIs (one associated to
the client port, and one associated to the server port) in the REGISTER.It
also contains a list of identifiers for the integrity and encryption
algorithms, which the UE supports. It shall also contain the list of IPsec
modes (i.e. transport and/or UDP encapsulated tunnel mode) supported by the
UE.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | [SM1:]{.underline} | | | | REGISTER(Security-setup = _SPI_U, Port_U, UE integrity and | | encryption algorithms list, IPsec mode list)_ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
SPI_U is the symbolic name of a pair of SPI values (cf. clause 7.1) (spi_uc,
spi_us) that the UE selects. _spi_uc_ is the SPI of the inbound SA at UE's the
protected client port, and _spi_us_ is the SPI of the inbound SA at the UE's
protected server port. The syntax of spi_uc and spi_us are defined in Annex H.
NOTE 1: The syntax defined in Annex H allows a large freedom of number of SPIs
Only one pair of unique SPIs is included in the Security-setup
Port_U is the symbolic name of a pair of port numbers (_port_uc, port_us_) as
defined in clause 7.1. The syntax of port_uc and port_us is defined in Annex
H.
NOTE 2: The syntax defined in Annex H allows a large freedom of number of
ports. Only one pair of unique ports is included in the Security-setup.
A Release 6 Pâ€‘CSCF shall propose SA alternatives for Release 5 and Release 6
UE's since the UE may or may not support confidentiality protection. The
Pâ€‘CSCF then selects the SPIs for the inbound SAs. The same SPI number shall be
used for Release 5 and Release 6 options. The Pâ€‘CSCF shall define the SPIs
such that they are unique and different from any SPIs as received in the
_Security-setup-line_ from the UE.
Upon receipt of SM1, the Pâ€‘CSCF temporarily stores the parameters received in
the _Security-setup_ -_line_ together with the UE's IP address from the source
IP address of the IP packet header, the IMPI and IMPU.
If the source IP address of the IP packet header is different from the address
contained in the top-most Via header, the P-CSCF concludes that the UE is
located behind a NAT device parameter with the source IP address to the Via
header and acts as described in Annex F of TS 24.229 [8]. In this case the
P-CSCF concludes that the UE is located behind a NAT device. If the UE has not
signalled support for UDP encapsulated tunnel mode in message SM1 the P-CSCF
shall silently discard the message and stop performing any further steps.
Otherwise, if the source IP address of SM1 matches the UE address in the Via
header, the P-CSCF concludes that the UE is not located behind a NAT. The
P-CSCF then continues with the set-up of security associations as specified in
section 7.2, otherwise it continues as specified in this annex.
NOTE 3: If the top-most Via header contains a domain name the P-CSCF shall
perform the appropriate DNS procedures in order to retrieve the address
information to be used for the comparison, as specified in Annex F of TS
24.229 [8].
Upon receipt of SM4, the Pâ€‘CSCF adds the keys IK~IM~ and CK~IM~ received from
the Sâ€‘CSCF to the temporarily stored parameters.
The Pâ€‘CSCF then selects the SPIs for the inbound SAs. The Pâ€‘CSCF shall define
the SPIs such that they are unique and different from any SPIs as received in
the _Security-setup-line_ from the UE.
NOTE 4: This rule is needed since the UE and the Pâ€‘CSCF use the same key for
inbound and outbound traffic.
In order to determine the integrity and encryption algorithm the Pâ€‘CSCF
proceeds as follows: the Pâ€‘CSCF has a list of integrity and encryption
algorithms it supports, ordered by priority, cf. Annex H. Release 6 algorithms
shall have higher priority than Release 5 algorithms.The Pâ€‘CSCF selects the
first algorithm combination on its own list which is also supported by the UE.
If the UE did not include any confidentiality algorithm in SM1 then the P-CSCF
shall either select the NULL encryption algorithm or abort the procedure,
according to its policy on confidentiality.
NOTE 5: It should be noted that, if the P-CSCF policy requires
confidentiality, then all UEs with no encryption support would be denied
access to the IMS network. This would apply in particular to UEs, which
support only a Release 5-version of this specification or only GIBA according
to Annex T of this specification.
The Pâ€‘CSCF then establishes two new pairs of SAs in the local security
association database.
In case the P-CSCF has discovered before that the UE is located behind a NAT,
it informs the UDP encapsulation function about the IPsec SA data relevant for
the UDP encapsulation process. This data consists of the IP source and
destination addresses of the outer IP headers and the SPIs used in all four
SAs (cf. section M.6.3) established. At this point in time the UDP
encapsulation function creates a table, the \"UDP encapsulation table\", with
the following contents:
* * *
\"UDP Encapsulation Table on the network side \"  
SA1 SA2 SA3 SA4 Src Addr PCSCF UE_pub PCSCF UE_pub Dest Addr UE_pub PCSCF
UE_pub PCSCF Src Port 4500 **_undef_** 4500 **_undef_** Dest Port **_undef_**
4500 **_undef_** 4500 SPI SPI_us SPI_ps SPI_uc SPI_pc
* * *
The P-CSCF shall use port 4500 as the source port for UDP encapsulated packets
towards the UE. The P-CSCF will also receive packets from the UE with and as
the destination port 4500. This is the IPsec standard port for UDP
encpasulated IPsec packets (see RFC 3948 [28]). The source port for packets
received by the P-CSCF from the UE and the destination port for packets sent
by the P-CSCF towards the UE is not known yet and can only be learned in a
later step (see below).
NOTE 6: A corresponding table on the UE side is not required as the ports used
by the UE are not affected by the NAT.
The _Security-setup-_ line in SM6 contains the SPIs and the ports assigned by
the Pâ€‘CSCF. It also contains a list of identifiers for the integrity and
encryption algorithms, which the Pâ€‘CSCF supports. The only exception from this
is the case that the Pâ€‘CSCF is configured to never apply confidentiality. In
this case, it shall not include encryption algorithms to the _Security-setup-_
line in SM6.
Furthermore, the P-CSCF indicates the IPsec mode of operation. In case the
P-CSCF detected that the UE is behind a NAT, it indicates UDP encapsulated
tunnel mode, otherwise transport mode is indicated.
NOTE 7: The Pâ€‘CSCF may be configured to never apply confidentiality, e.g.
because it trusts on the encryption provided by the underlying access network.
In this case, the Pâ€‘CSCF acts according to Release 5 specifications, and does
not include encryption algorithms to the _Security-setup-_ line in SM6. If the
P-CSCF is configured to apply confidentiality whenever the UE supports it then
the P-CSCF always includes the encryption algorithms in SM6, which it
supports, even if the UE did not include encryption algorithms in SM1. This is
to thwart bidding down attacks.Pâ€‘CSCF may be configured to trust on the
encryption provided by the underlying access network. In this case, the Pâ€‘CSCF
acts according to Release 5 specifications, and does not include encryption
algorithms to the _Security-setup-_ line in SM6.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | [SM6:]{.underline} | | | | 4xx Auth_Challenge(Security-setup = _SPI_P, Port_P_ , _Pâ€‘CSCF | | integrity and encryption algorithms list), IPsec mode )_ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
SPI_P is the symbolic name of the pair of SPI values (cf. clause 7.1)
(_spi_pc, spi_ps_) that the Pâ€‘CSCF selects. _spi_pc_ is the SPI of the inbound
SA at the Pâ€‘CSCF's protected client port, and _spi_ps_ is the SPI of the
inbound SA at the Pâ€‘CSCF's protected server port. The syntax of spi __pc_ and
_spi_ps_ is defined in Annex H.
Port_P is the symbolic name of the port numbers (_port_pc_ , _port_ps_) as
defined in clause 7.1. The syntax of Port_P is defined in Annex H.
Upon receipt of SM6, the UE determines the integrity and encryption algorithms
as follows: the UE selects the first integrity and encryption algorithm
combination on the list received from the Pâ€‘CSCF in SM 6 which is also
supported by the UE.
NOTE 8: Release 5 UE will not support any encryption algorithms, and will
choose the first Release 5 integrity algorithm on the list received from the
Pâ€‘CSCF in SM6.
The UE shall either configure UDP encapsulated tunnel mode or determine the
IPsec mode according to the mode information contained in SM6. If no mode
information is included in SM6, the UE shall first check whether it is located
behind a NAT by checking for the presence of a \"received\"-parameter in the
Via header of SM6. If the UE is not located behind a NAT, the UE assumes
transport mode, otherwise it aborts the communication. If transport mode is
used the UE continues with the set-up of security associations as specified in
section 7.2, otherwise it continues as specified in this annex.
The UE then proceeds to establish two new pairs of SAs in the local SAD.
The UE shall integrity and confidentiality protect SM7 and all following SIP
messages.
Furthermore the integrity and encryption algorithms list, _SPI_P,_ and
_Port_P_ received in SM6, and _SPI_U, Port_U sent in SM1_ shall be included:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | [SM7:]{.underline} | | | | REGISTER(Security-setup = _SPI_U, Port_U, SPI_P, Port_P_ , | | _Pâ€‘CSCF integrity and encryption algorithms list)_ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
If UDP encapsulated tunnel mode is used, the UE shall use the following
addresses and ports in the various headers of message SM7:
> SIP header:\ In the Via and Contact header the UE shall use its public IP
> address and protected server port. The UE learns its public IP address by
> inspecting the received parameter in the top-most Via header included in
> message SM6, in case such a parameter is present.
IP and UDP/TCP headers are used as specified in M.7.1.
If UDP encapsulated tunnel mode is applied, the UE shall start sending keep
alive messages according to RFC 3948 [28]. This ensures that the NAT binding
is kept alive for the duration of the registration.
When SM 7 arrives at the P-CSCF it is at first processed by the UDP
encapsulation function. The UDP encapsulation function can now learn
port_Uenc, which the NAT has chosen for the UDP encapsulated packet. The UDP
encapsulation function inserts this port in the UDP encapsulation table, so
that the table is complete.
* * *
\"UDP Encapsulation Table\" on the network side  
SA1 SA2 SA3 SA4 Src Addr PCSCF UE_pub PCSCF UE_pub Dest Addr UE_pub PCSCF
UE_pub PCSCF Src Port 4500 **_Port_Uenc_** 4500 **_Port_Uenc_** Dest Port
**_Port_Uenc_** 4500 **_Port_Uenc_** 4500 SPI SPI_us SPI_ps SPI_uc SPI_pc
* * *
The UDP encapsulation function removes the UDP header from the IP packet and
hands it over to the IPsec processing.
After successful IPsec processing the SIP application in the Pâ€‘CSCF shall
check whether the integrity algorithms list, _SPI_P_ and _Port_P_ received in
SM7 is identical with the corresponding parameters sent in SM6. It further
checks whether _SPI_U_ and _Port_U_ received in SM7 are identical with those
received in SM1. If these checks are not successful the registration procedure
is aborted.
The Pâ€‘CSCF shall include in SM8 information to the Sâ€‘CSCF that the received
message from the UE was integrity protected as indicated in clause 6.1.5. The
Pâ€‘CSCF shall add this information to all subsequent REGISTER messages received
from the UE that have successfully passed the integrity check in the Pâ€‘CSCF.
+-------------------------------------------------------+ | [SM8:]{.underline} | | | | REGISTER(Integrity-Protection = _Successful,_ IMPI _)_ | +-------------------------------------------------------+
The Pâ€‘CSCF finally sends SM12 to the UE. SM12 does not contain information
specific to security mode setup (i.e. a Security-setup line), but with sending
SM12 not indicating an error the Pâ€‘CSCF confirms that security mode setup has
been successful.
After receiving SM12 not indicating an error, the UE can assume the successful
completion of the security-mode setup.
An example of how to make use of two pairs of unidirectional SAs is
illustrated in figure M.9 with a set of example message exchanges protected by
the respective IPsec SAs where the INVITE and following messages are assumed
to be carried over TCP.
Figure M.9
## M.7.3 Error cases in the set-up of security associations
### M.7.3.1 Error cases related to IMS AKA
The text in clause 7.3.1 applies without changes.
### M.7.3.2 Error cases related to the Security-Set-up
#### M.7.3.2.1 Proposal unacceptable to Pâ€‘CSCF
In this case the Pâ€‘CSCF cannot accept the proposal set sent by the UE in the
Security-Set-up command of SM1. The Pâ€‘CSCF shall respond to SM1 indicating a
failure, by sending an error response to the UE.
#### M.7.3.2.2 Proposal unacceptable to UE
If the Pâ€‘CSCF sends in the security-setup line of SM6 a proposal that is not
acceptable for the UE, the UE shall abandon the registration procedure.
#### M.7.3.2.3 Failed consistency check of Security-Set-up lines at the Pâ€‘CSCF
The Pâ€‘CSCF shall check whether authentication and encryption algorithms list
received in SM7 is identical with the authentication and encryption algorithms
list sent in SM6. If this is not the case the registration procedure is
aborted. (Cf. clause 7.2).
#### M.7.3.2.4 Missing NAT traversal capabilities in the presence of a NAT
In case the P-CSCF detects the presence of a NAT, but the UE or the P-CSCF do
not support NAT traversal as specified in this annex, the P-CSCF shall abort
the procedure.
## M.7.4 Authenticated re-registration
### M.7.4.0 General
Every registration that includes a user authentication attempt produces new
security associations. If the authentication is successful, then these new
security associations shall replace the previous ones. This clause describes
how the UE and Pâ€‘CSCF handle this replacement and which SAs to apply to which
message.
When security associations are changed in an authenticated re-registration
then the protected server ports at the UE (_port_us_) and the Pâ€‘CSCF
(_port_ps_) shall remain unchanged, while the protected client ports at the UE
(_port_uc_) and the Pâ€‘CSCF (_port_pc_) shall change. For the definition of
these ports see clause 7.1.
If the UE has an already active pair of security associations, then it shall
use this to protect the REGISTER message. If the Sâ€‘CSCF is notified by the
Pâ€‘CSCF that the REGISTER message from the UE was integrity-protected it may
decide not to authenticate the user by means of the AKA protocol. However, the
UE may send unprotected REGISTER messages at any time. In this case, the
Sâ€‘CSCF shall authenticate the user by means of the AKA protocol. In
particular, if the UE considers the SAs no longer active at the Pâ€‘CSCF, e.g.,
after receiving no response to several protected messages, then the UE should
send an unprotected REGISTER message.
Security associations may be unidirectional or bi-directional. This clause
assumes that security associations are unidirectional, as this is the general
case. For IP layer SAs, the lifetime mentioned in the following clauses is the
lifetime held at the application layer. Furthermore deleting an SA means
deleting the SA from both the application and IPsec layer. The message
numbers, e.g. SM1, used in the following clauses relate to the message flow
given in clause 6.1.1.
### M.7.4.1 Void
### M.7.4.1a Management of security associations in the UE
The UE shall be involved in only one registration procedure at a time, i.e.
the UE shall remove any data relating to any previous incomplete registrations
or authentications, including any SAs created by an incomplete authentication.
The UE may start a registration procedure with two existing pairs of SAs.
These will be referred to as the old SAs. The authentication produces two
pairs of new SAs. These new SAs shall not be used to protect non-
authentication traffic until noted during the authentication flow. In the same
way, certain messages in the authentication shall be protected with a
particular SA. If the UE receives a message protected with the incorrect SA,
it shall discard the message.
A successful authentication proceeds in the following steps:
\- The UE sends the SM1 message to register with the IMS. If SM1 was
protected, it shall be protected with the old outbound SA.
\- The UE receives an authentication challenge in a message (SM6) from the
Pâ€‘CSCF. This message shall be protected with the old inbound SA if SM1 was
protected and unprotected otherwise.
\- If this message SM6 can be successfully processed by the UE, the UE creates
the new SAs, which are derived according to clause 7.1. The lifetime of the
new SAs shall be set to allow enough time to complete the registration
procedure. If SM1 was protected and UDP encapsulated tunnel mode is used in
the old SAs, the new SAs shall also be configured in with UDP encapsulated
tunnel mode. The UE then sends its response (SM7) to the Pâ€‘CSCF, which shall
be protected with the new outbound SA. Meanwhile, if SM1 was protected, the UE
shall use the old SAs for messages other than those in the authentication,
until a successful message of new authentication is received (SM12); if SM1
was unprotected, the UE is not allowed to use IMS service until it receives an
authentication successful message (SM12).
\- The UE receives an authentication successful message (SM12) from the
Pâ€‘CSCF. It shall be protected with the new inbound SA.
\- After the successful processing of this message by the UE, the registration
is complete. The UE sets the lifetime of the new SAs such that it either
equals the latest lifetime of the old SAs or it will expire shortly after the
registration timer in the message, depending which gives the SAs the longer
life. For further SIP messages sent from UE, the new outbound SAs are used,
with the following exception: when a SIP message is part of a pending SIP
transaction it may still be sent over the old SA. A SIP transaction is called
pending if it was started using an old SA. When a further SIP message
protected with a new inbound SA is successfully received from the Pâ€‘CSCF, then
the old SAs shall be deleted as soon as either all pending SIP transactions
have been completed, or have timed out. The old SAs shall be always deleted
when the lifetime is expired. This completes the SA handling procedure for the
UE.
A failure in the authentication can occur for several reasons. If the SM1 was
not protected, then no protection shall be applied to the failure messages,
except the user authentication failure message which shall be protected with
the new SA. If SM1 was protected, the old SAs shall be used to protect the
failure messages. In both cases, after processing the failure message, the UE
shall delete the new SAs.
The UE shall monitor the expiry time of registrations without an
authentication and if necessary increase the lifetime of the SAs created by
the last successful authentication such that it will expire shortly after the
registration timer in the message.
NOTE: In particular this means that the lifetime of a SA is never decreased.
The UE shall delete any SA whose lifetime is exceeded. The UE shall delete all
SAs it holds once all the IMPUs are de-registered.
### M.7.4.2 Void
### M.7.4.2a Management of security associations in the Pâ€‘CSCF
When the Sâ€‘CSCF initiates an authentication by sending a challenge to the UE,
the Pâ€‘CSCF may already contain existing SAs from previously completed
authentications. It may also contain two existing pairs of SAs from an
incomplete authentication. These will be referred to as the old and
registration SAs respectively. The authentication produces two pairs of new
SAs. These new SAs shall not be used to protect non-authentication traffic
until noted during the authentication flow. Similarly certain messages in the
authentication shall be protected with a particular SA. If the Pâ€‘CSCF receives
a message protected with the incorrect SA, it shall discard the message.
The Pâ€‘CSCF associates the IMPI given in the registration procedure and all the
successfully registered IMPUs related to that IMPI to an SA.
A successful authentication proceeds in the following steps:
\- The Pâ€‘CSCF receives the SM1 message. If SM1 is protected, it shall be
protected with the old inbound SA.
\- The Pâ€‘CSCF forwards the message containing the challenge (SM6) to the UE.
This shall be protected with the old outbound SA, if SM1 was protected and
unprotected otherwise.
\- The Pâ€‘CSCF then creates the new SAs, which are derived according to clause
7.1. The expiry time of the new SAs shall be set to allow enough time to
complete the registration procedure. If SM1 was protected and UDP encapsulated
tunnel mode is used in the old SAs, the new SAs shall also be configured with
UDP encapsulated tunnel mode. The registration SAs shall be deleted if they
exist.
\- The Pâ€‘CSCF receives the message carrying the response (SM7) from the UE. It
shall be protected using the new inbound SA. If SM1 was protected, the old SAs
are used to protect messages other than those in the authentication.
\- The Pâ€‘CSCF forwards the successful registration message (SM12) to the UE.
It shall be protected using the new outbound SA. This completes the
registration procedure for the Pâ€‘CSCF. The Pâ€‘CSCF sets the expiry time of the
new SAs such that they either equals the latest lifetime of the old SAs or it
will expire shortly after the registration timer in the message, depending
which gives the SAs the longer life.
\- After SM12 is sent, the Pâ€‘CSCF handles the UE related SAs according to
following rules:
\- If there are old SAs, but SM1 belonging to the same registration procedure
was received unprotected, the Pâ€‘CSCF considers error cases happened, and
assumes UE does not have those old SAs for use. In this case the Pâ€‘CSCF shall
remove the old SAs.
\- If SM1 belonging to the same registration procedure was protected with an
old valid SA, the Pâ€‘CSCF keeps this inbound SA and the corresponding three SAs
created during the same registration with the UE active, and continues to use
them. Any other old SAs are deleted. When the old SAs have only a short time
left before expiring or a further SIP message protected with a new inbound SA
is successfully received from the UE, the Pâ€‘CSCF starts to use the new SAs for
outbound messages with the following exception: when a SIP message is part of
a pending SIP transaction it may still be sent over the old SA. A SIP
transaction is called pending if it was started using an old SA. The old SAs
are then deleted as soon as all pending SIP transactions have been completed,
or have timed out. The old SAs are always deleted when the old SAs lifetime
are expired. When the old SAs expire without a further SIP message protected
by the new SAs, the new SAs are taken into use for outbound messages. This
completes the SA handling procedure for the Pâ€‘CSCF.
A failure in the authentication can occur for several reasons. If the SM1 was
not protected, then no protection shall be applied to the failure messages,
except the user authentication failure message which shall be protected with
the new SAs. If SM1 was protected, the old SAs shall be used to protect the
failure messages. In both cases, after processing the failure message, the
Pâ€‘CSCF shall delete the new SAs.
The Pâ€‘CSCF shall monitor the expiry time of registrations without an
authentication and if necessary increase the lifetime of SAs created by the
last successful authentication such that it will expire shortly after the
registration timer in the message.
The Pâ€‘CSCF shall delete any SA whose lifetime is exceeded. The P-CSCF shall
delete all SAs it holds that are associated with a particular IMPI once all
the associated IMPUs are de-registered.

###### ## Annex N (normative): Enhancements to the access security to enable
SIP Digest
# N.1 SIP Digest
SIP Digest authentication and the requirements in this Annex shall not apply
to access networks defined in 3GPP specifications. The P-CSCF can enforce this
condition by identifying REGISTER requests relating to SIP Digest according to
the rules in Annex P.3 of the present document and discarding them when
received over an access network defined in 3GPP specifications.
The provisions in Annex N are optional for implementation. The provisions in
Annex N are optional for use. However, the use of one of the authentication
mechanisms in the present document is mandated.
SIP Digest shall not be used in conjunction with IPsec.
NOTE 1: The use of SIP Digest in conjunction with IPsec, as specified in the
main body and in Annex N of this specification, is technically impossible
because SIP Digest does not generate session keys for use with IPsec security
associations.
An additional scheme for authentication is SIP Digest as specified in RFC 3261
[6]. SIP Digest achieves mutual authentication between the UE and the HN, and
is based on HTTP Digest as specified in RFC 7616 [76]. The identity used for
authenticating a subscriber is the private identity, IMPI, which has the form
of a NAI. The HSS and the UE share a preset secret (e.g., a password)
associated with the IMPI. The generation of the authentication challenge shall
be done in the same way as specified in RFC 7616 [76] and the present
document.
It is the policy of the HN that decides if an authentication shall take place
for the registration of an additional IMPU that is not part of the already
registered set of IMPUs associated with the same IMPI.
If a UE supports SIP Digest as well as further authentication methods, the UE
shall proceed as follows:
\- If the access network is of a type defined in 3GPP specifications then the
UE shall not select SIP Digest, in accordance with the requirement at the
start of this clause.
NOTE 2: The rules listed in Annex T of this specification say how a UE can
select between IMS AKA and GIBA.
\- If the access network is of a type not defined in 3GPP specifications then
\- if both the UE and network support IMS AKA according to the main body or
Annex M of this specification, as determined by the use of sip-sec-agree RFC
3329 [21], the authentication method shall be IMS AKA;
\- otherwise the authentication method shall be SIP Digest as specified in
Annex N of this specification.
# N.2 Authentication
## N.2.1 Authentication Requirements
### N.2.1.1 Authentication Requirements for Registrations
For the purposes of this subclause, the name \"authentication\" is used
synonymously with \"entity authentication\".
Before a user can get access to the IM services at least one IMPU needs to be
registered and the IMPI authenticated in the IMS at application level. In
order to get registered the UE sends a SIP REGISTER message towards the SIP
registrar, i.e. the Sâ€‘CSCF, cf. figure N.1, which will perform the
authentication of the user. The message flows are the same regardless of
whether the user has an IMPU already registered or not.

Figure N.1: The IMS Authentication using SIP Digest for an unregistered IM
subscriber and successful mutual authentication
The detailed registration procedures are defined in TS 24.229 [8].
The NAT traversal procedures in RFC 5626 [32] and in TS 24.229 [8] clause K.4
shall apply.
NOTE 1: It is recognized that RFC 5626 [32] can be useful for capabilities
beyond NAT traversal (e.g. multiple registrations) however this annex does not
consider such capabilities at this time.
The UE should include an indication of support for managing client-initiated
connections as defined in RFC 5626 [32] in all REGISTER requests. Per RFC 5626
[32], the P-CSCF shall be able to accept registration request with or without
an indication of support for managing client-initiated connections. However,
the P-CSCF should only accept a register request without support for managing
client-initiated connections if it can determine that no NAT is present in the
signaling path between the UE and the P-CSCF.
NOTE 2: It is left to stage 3 specifications how a P-CSCF can determine
whether the conditions in the preceding paragraph are met. An operator may
configure all UEs and P-CSCFs in his network not to use support for managing
client-initiated connections (provided there is no roaming). Cf. also the
implications of the indication of support for managing client-initiated
connections for the P-CSCF procedures after receiving SM11.
SMn stands for SIP Message n and CMm stands for Cx message m which has a
relation to the authentication process:
+------------------------+ | SM1: | | | | REGISTER(IMPI*, IMPU) | +------------------------+
"IMPI*" in SM1 means that the inclusion of the IMPI is optional in SM1.
NOTE 2a: When a registering UE omits the IMPI from the REGISTER request, the
IMPI for the registration is derived from the registering IMPU. Since there
can be only one registered instance of an IMPI at any point in time, the
registering IMPU in this case cannot be shared across multiple UEs.
In SM2 and SM3 the Pâ€‘CSCF and the Iâ€‘CSCF respectively forwards the SIP
REGISTER towards the Sâ€‘CSCF. If SM1 does not contain an IMPI, the P-CSCF shall
behave according to Annex P.3 and forward the message as SM2 to the I-CSCF.
NOTE 2b: Annex P.3 formulates conditions depending on the presence of an
Authorization header. Note that, if SM1 does not contain an IMPI, then SM1
does not contain an Authorization header.
The I-CSCF queries the HSS to find the address of the Sâ€‘CSCF. If SM2 does not
contain an IMPI the I-CSCF shall derive the IMPI from the IMPU in the REGISTER
request as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [8]. Then the I-CSCF forwards the
message as SM3 to the S-CSCF.
After receiving SM3, if the IMPU is not currently registered at the Sâ€‘CSCF,
the Sâ€‘CSCF needs to set the registration flag at the HSS to initial
registration pending. This is done in order to handle UE terminated calls
while the initial registration is in progress and not successfully completed.
The registration flag is stored in the HSS together with the Sâ€‘CSCF name and
user identity, and is used to indicate whether a particular IMPU of the user
is unregistered or registered at a particular Sâ€‘CSCF or if the initial
registration at a particular Sâ€‘CSCF is pending. The registration flag is set
by the Sâ€‘CSCF sending a Cx-Put to the HSS. If the IMPU is currently
registered, the Sâ€‘CSCF shall leave the registration flag set to registered. At
this stage the HSS has performed a check that the IMPI and the IMPU belong to
the same user.
The S-CSCF shall determine the type of authentication based on the rules in
Annex P. If SM3 does not contain an IMPI the S-CSCF shall derive the IMPI from
the IMPU in the REGISTER request as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [8]. If the
IMS registration request is related to SIP Digest, then the procedures below
apply.
Upon receiving the SIP REGISTER the Sâ€‘CSCF shall use a SIP Digest
Authentication Vector (SD-AV) for authenticating the user. If the Sâ€‘CSCF has
no valid SD-AV for the specific IMPI, then the Sâ€‘CSCF shall send a request for
SD-AV(s) to the HSS in CM1 where the number m of SD-AVs wanted is equal to 1.
+--------------------+---+ | CM1: | | | | | | Cx-AV-Req(IMPI, m) | | +--------------------+---+
Upon receipt of a request from the Sâ€‘CSCF, the HSS sends one SD-AV to the
Sâ€‘CSCF using CM2. The SD-AV consists of the qop (quality of protection) value,
the authentication algorithm including SHA256 and MD5, realm, and two hashes,
called H(A1)_256 and H(A1), of the IMPI, realm, and password. The H(A1)_SHA256
is calculated based on SHA256 while the H(A1) is calculated based on MD5.
Refer to RFC 7616 [76] for additional information on the values in the
authentication vector for SIP Digest based authentication. To maintain
backwards compatibility, the MD5 algorithm is still supported but not
recommended.
The qop value shall be set to \"auth\" since SIP Digest, as used in IMS, can
only provide authentication, not message integrity.
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+ | CM2: | | | | | | Cx-AV-Req-Resp(IMPI, realm, algorithms, qop, H(A1)_SHA256 and H(A1) ) | | +------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+
The S-CSCF generates a random nonce, stores H(A1)_SHA256 and H(A1) and the
nonce against the IMPI, and then sends a SIP 401 Auth_Challenge i.e., an
authentication challenge towards the UE including the nonce in SM4. It also
includes the realm, qop and algorithm parameters including SHA256 and MD5,
which are in order of preference, starting with SHA256, followed by MD5. RFC
7616 [76] specifies how to populate the parameters of a 401 Auth_Challenge.
+----------------------------------------------------------+ | SM4: | | | | 401 Auth_Challenge(IMPI, realm, nonce, qop, algorithms) | +----------------------------------------------------------+
The I-CSCF forwards the SIP 4xx Auth_Challenge message towards the P-CSCF as
SM5.
When the P-CSCF receives SM5 it shall forward the message to the UE.
+---------------------------------------------------------+ | SM6: | | | | 401 Auth_Challenge(IMPI, realm, nonce, qop, algorithm) | +---------------------------------------------------------+
Upon receiving the challenge, SM6, the UE generates a cnonce. It then selects
the first algorithm it supports and uses the cnonce as well as parameters
provided in the SM6 such as nonce and qop to calculate an authentication
response according to RFC 7616 [76]. This response and other parameters are
put into the Authorization header and sent back towards the network in SM7.
The inclusion of the IMPI, the selected algorithm and an Authorization header
in SM7 are mandatory.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | SM7: | | | | REGISTER(IMPI, realm, nonce, response, cnonce, qop, nonce-count, | | algorithm, digest-uri) | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
NOTE 3: As specified in RFC 3261 [6], when the P-CSCF receives a SIP request
from the UE, the P-CSCF checks the IP address in the \"sent-by\" parameter of
the Via header field provided by the UE. If the \"sent-by\" parameter contains
a domain name, or if it contains an IP address that differs from the packet
source IP address, the P-CSCF adds a \"received\" parameter to that Via header
field value. This parameter contains the source IP address from which the
packet was received.
The Pâ€‘CSCF forwards the authentication response in SM8 to the Iâ€‘CSCF, which
queries the HSS to find the address of the Sâ€‘CSCF. In SM9 the Iâ€‘CSCF forwards
the authentication response to the Sâ€‘CSCF.
Upon receiving SM9 containing the response, the S-CSCF selects the stored
hashes (i.e., H(A1)_256 and H(A1)) based on the received algorithm selected by
UE and calculates the expected response using the received algorithm selected
by UE and the selected hash and stored nonce together with other parameters
contained in SM9 (e.g., cnonce, nonce-count, qop, as specified in RFC 7616
[76]) and uses this to check against the response sent by the UE. If the check
is successful then the user has been authenticated and the IMPU is registered
in the Sâ€‘CSCF. If the IMPU was not currently registered, the Sâ€‘CSCF shall send
a Cx-Put to update the registration-flag to registered. If the IMPU was
currently registered the registration-flag is not altered.
NOTE 4: Depending on its local security policy, the S-CSCF may delete H(A1)
immediately after checking the Digest response, but this may then lead to an
increased exposure of H(A1) on the Cx-interface as H(A1) would then have to be
fetched from the HSS more often.
It shall be possible to implicitly register IMPU(s) (see clause 4.3.3.4 in TS
23.228 [3]). All the IMPU(s) being implicitly registered shall be delivered by
the HSS to the Sâ€‘CSCF and subsequently to the Pâ€‘CSCF. The Sâ€‘CSCF shall regard
all implicitly registered IMPU(s) as registered IMPU(s).
When an IMPU has been registered this registration will be valid for some
period of time. Both the UE and the Sâ€‘CSCF will keep track of a timer for this
purpose but the expiration time in the UE is smaller than the one in the
Sâ€‘CSCF in order to make it possible for the UE to be registered and reachable
without interruptions. A successful registration of a previously registered
IMPU (including implicitly registered IMPUs) means the expiry time of the
registration is refreshed.
If the user has been successfully authenticated, the Sâ€‘CSCF sends a SM10 SIP
2xx Auth_OK message to the I-CSCF indicating that the registration was
successful. The 2xx Auth_OK message contains the Authentication-Info header
with a response digest as specified in RFC 7616 [76]. The response digest
allows the UE to authenticate the HN.
In SM11 the Iâ€‘CSCF forwards the SIP 2xx Auth_OK towards the P-CSCF.
The P-CSCF associates the UE\'s packet source IP address along with the
\"sent-by\" parameter of the Via header, cf. RFC 3261 [6], of the REGISTER
message with the IMPI and all the successfully registered IMPUs related to
that IMPI. If managing of client-initiated connections as defined in RFC 5626
[32] is used then the P-CSCF shall also include the UE\'s packet source port
of the REGISTER message as part of the association. The P-CSCF stores the
associated parameters in an IP address check table. If managing of client-
initiated connections is not used then the P-CSCF shall overwrite any existing
entry in the IP address check table which has the same IP address, but a
different IMPI. If managing of client-initiated connections is used then the
P-CSCF shall overwrite any existing entry in the IP address check table which
has the same (IP address, port) pair, but a different IMPI.
The P-CSCF forwards the SIP 2xx AUTH_OK towards the UE.
NOTE 5: If a P-CSCF associated the port with the IMPI even when managing of
client-initiated connections was not used then the UE would be unnecessarily
restricted in opening new connections during a registration. The restriction
is unavoidable in the presence of NAT.
Upon receiving SM12, the UE shall calculate the expected response from the HN
as described in RFC 7616 [76]. To authenticate the HN, the UE shall compare
its expected response to the response provided by the HN. If the comparison
fails the UE shall abort the communication.
### N.2.1.2 Authentication Requirements for Non-registration Messages
For the purposes of this subsection, the name \"authentication\" is used
synonymously with \"message origin authentication\".
The IP address check table (cf. subclause N.2.1.1) shall be used by the P-CSCF
to identify the initiator of subsequent requests as follows: one of the public
user identities associated with the packet IP address (and port if applicable)
is selected and asserted to the S-CSCF according to the rules in TS 24.229
[8], subclause 5.2.6.3.
In addition, subsequent requests (e.g. INVITE) may be authenticated with SIP
Digest, as described in the following:
NOTE 1: The assertion of IMPUs based on checks of IP address (and ports if
applicable) provides a reasonable level of security only in environments where
the risk from source IP address and port spoofing or from IP address re-
assignment unnoticed by the SIP application is sufficiently low. If the
environment does not fulfill this condition then it is recommended to use SIP
Digest in conjunction with either TLS, as specified in Annex O of this
specification, or with the SIP Digest proxy authentication mechanism as
specified in this subclause. It is not part of this specification to determine
which environments fulfill the conditions in this NOTE. This is left to
specifications, possibly maintained by standardization bodies other than 3GPP,
describing these environments. More details on the usage of the authentication
mechanisms for non-registration messages are provided in Annex Q
(informative).
When the S-CSCF receives a SIP request with a method other than the REGISTER
method from the UE, the S-CSCF may perform authentication on the SIP request
according to the operator\'s policy and according to the following procedures.
  * If the request does not contain a Proxy-Authorization header or the Proxy-Authorization header does not contain a digest response the S-CSCF shall send a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response to challenge the UE. The 407 response shall contain digest challenge parameters in a Proxy-Authenticate header as defined by RFC 7616 [76]. The challenge parameters, with the exception of the nonce, shall be taken from the same SD-AV as used for the last successful registration or re-registration message of the UE. The nonce shall be generated freshly by the S-CSCF. Upon receiving the challenge the UE shall extract digest challenge parameters from the Proxy-Authenticate header field and calculate a digest response as indicated in RFC 7616 [76]. The UE should store the received digest challenge. The UE then sends a new request to the network containing a Proxy-Authorization header in which the header fields are populated as described in RFC 7616 [76] using the calculated digest response. Upon receiving the new request which contains a digest response, the S-CSCF verifies the user's identity by validating the digest response information (e.g. the nonce-count) contained in the Proxy-Authorization header field against the expected information based on the same SD-AV as used for generating the challenge;
NOTE 1a: Authorization (used for registration messages, cf. sub-clause
N.2.1.1) and Proxy-Authorization (used for non-registration messages, this
sub-clause) are handled by logically separated protocol engines and thus each
mechanism has its own nonce, cnonce and nonce-count parameters.
NOTE 1b: The usage of the same SD-AV for authentication of non-registration
messages and of registration messages requires the storage of the SD-AV in
S-CSCF during the authentication of registration messages (cf. subclause
N.2.1.1), as retrieval of AVs from HSS is only specified for handling of
registration messages. In case of dynamic password change (cf. clause N.2.5),
the SD-AV (or SD-AVs) used for generating the challenge(s) are specified in
clause N.2.5.
  * If the check is successful then the request has been authenticated, and the S-CSCF sends a 2xx AUTH_OK towards the UE;
  * If the check fails, based on local policy the S-CSCF may choose to re-challenge the user by using the same procedure described in this subclause, or reject the request by sending a 403 response.
When the UE is to send a non-REGISTER SIP request it should first check
whether it has a digest challenge stored which was previously received in a
Proxy-Authenticate header. If such a digest challenge is available in the UE
the UE should use it together with the nonce-count mechanism as specified in
RFC 7616 [76] to calculate a digest response, include the digest response in a
Proxy-Authorization header and send this header together with the non-REGISTER
SIP request.
NOTE 2: According to RFC 7616 [76], the S-CSCF may send a 407 (Proxy
Authentication Required) as a response to any non-REGISTER request, indicating
that the nonce is stale and the digest response shall be recomputed using the
fresh challenge sent in the same 407 message.
When the S-CSCF has successfully used the SIP Digest proxy authentication
mechanism it shall check if the public user identity asserted by the P-CSCF
belongs to the implicit registration set (i.e. the public user identities
associated with the authenticated user). If the check is not successful the
S-CSCF shall reject the non-registration request.
NOTE 3: Such a rejection may occur when one of the conditions mentioned in
NOTE 1 is not fulfilled.
NOTE 4: When TLS according to Annex O is used, or when IPsec according to the
main body or Annex M is used, then the failure conditions mentioned in NOTE 1
and Annex Q.3 cannot occur, and the public user identity asserted by the
P-CSCF is reliable.
## N.2.2 Authentication failures
### N.2.2.1 User Authentication failure
If the S-CSCF detects the user authentication failure due to an incorrect
response (received in SM9), the S-CSCF sends a failure notification to the UE.
The S-CSCF shall set the registration-flag in the HSS to unregistered or Not
registered if the IMPU is not currently registered. To set the flag the S-CSCF
sends in CM3 a Cx-Put to the HSS as shown in Figure 5. If the IMPU is
currently registered, the S-CSCF does not update the registration flag. The
HSS responds to CM3 with a Cx-Put-Resp in CM4.
In SM10 the S-CSCF sends a 4xx Auth_Failure towards the UE indicating that
authentication has failed. No security parameters shall be included in this
message.
+---------------------------+ | SM10: | | | | SIP/2.0 4xx Auth_Failure | +---------------------------+
### N.2.2.2 Network authentication failure
For network authentication failures, the flow is identical as for the
successful registration in N.2.1 up to SM12. After receipt of the 2xx Auth_OK,
the UE shall attempt to validate the response digest. If the response digest
authentication fails, the UE shall consider registration as failed and may
start a new registration.
### N.2.2.3 Incomplete Authentication
When the S-CSCF receives a new REGISTER request and challenges this request,
it considers any previous authentication to have failed. It shall delete any
information relating to the previous authentication, although the S-CSCF may
send a response if the previous challenge is answered. A challenge to the new
request proceeds as described in clause N.2.1.
If the S-CSCF does not receive a response to an authentication challenge
within an acceptable time, it considers the authentication to have failed. If
the IMPU was not already registered, the S-CSCF shall send a Cx-Put to the HSS
to set the registration-flag for that IMPU to Not registered or unregistered
(see message CM3 in clause 6.1.2.2). If the IMPU was already registered, the
S-CSCF does not change the registration-flag.
## N.2.3 SIP Digest synchronization failure
For SIP Digest based authentication, the UE can not detect synchronization
failures when processing SM6 but the S-CSCF can check if the nonce value in
SM9 is invalid with a valid digest for that nonce (indicating that the client
knows the correct username/password) to determine that a synchronization
failure has occurred.
Another possible synchronization failure may occur (e.g. during a replay
attack) when the nonce-count value (sent by the UE) is different from the one
expected by the network. In order to detect such a synchronization failure,
the S-CSCF shall store the value of the nonce-count value sent by the specific
UE (in the SM7) during the last successful authentication.
In both of these situations, the S-CSCF shall reject the request and send out
the challenge (i.e., SM4) again using a new nonce. The stale parameter in the
www-Authenticate header is set to TRUE (case-insensitive) in this message.
For SIP Digest, when the UE receives the challenge with the stale parameter in
the www-Authenticate header set to TRUE, it shall retry the REGISTER request
with a new response with Digest computed over the new nonce (i.e., starting
from SM7 in Figure N.1).
## N.2.4 Network Initiated authentications
In order to authenticate an already registered user, the S-CSCF shall send a
request to the UE to initiate a re-registration procedure. When received at
the S-CSCF, the re-registration shall trigger a new SIP Digest procedure that
will allow the S-CSCF to re-authenticate the user.
The UE shall initiate the re-registration on the reception of the
Authentication Required indication. In the event that the UE does not initiate
the re-registration procedure after the request from the S-CSCF, the S-CSCF
may decide to de-register the subscriber or re-issue an Authentication-
Required.
## N.2.5 Support for dynamic password change
SIP Digest relies on the use of passwords. This clause specifies the
requirements on the HSS and the S-CSCF for supporting a change of this
password in a dynamic way, while not disrupting ongoing communication.
A user and his home network may agree on a new password for SIP Digest by a
secure password change mechanism, which is outside the scope of this
specification. As part of this process, the new password will be stored in the
HSS. It is assumed here that the new password is stored in the HSS only after
the user confirmed receipt of the new password as part of the secure password
change mechanism.
NOTE 1: Such a secure password change mechanism may be e.g. realized through
the use of an online portal.
The HSS and the S-CSCF shall support the possibility for the HSS to push a new
entry for the hash value H(A1), of the IMPI, realm and password to the S-CSCF
currently serving the user. The HSS shall be able to send such a H(A1) push
message at any time independent of other communication on the Cx interface.
NOTE 2: It is recommended that the secure password change mechanism updates
the password in the HSS with minimal delay, and the HSS sends such a push
message to the S-CSCF immediately after the new password entry in the HSS has
occurred in order to avoid the situation that a user has already taken the new
password into use while the H(A1) is not yet available in the S-CSCF.
When the S-CSCF receives a new H(A1) from the HSS via a push message it shall
store the new H(A1) and take it into use at the next occasion.
NOTE 3: The text in this clause does not preclude the possibility that the HSS
initiates a user de-registration or the S-CSCF triggers a network-initiated
authenticated re-registration when it suspects a password compromise. De-
registration would result in the loss of ongoing sessions, while authenticated
re-registration would not. Network-initiated authenticated re-registration as
a measure against suspected password compromise would therefore only be
acceptable if a reasonably fast password change mechanism was available.
To avoid password synchronization problems during password change that could
lead to service interruption, the following approach may be applied as an
implementation option. When the S-CSCF receives a new H(A1) from the HSS via a
push or pull message it may keep at most one already stored H(A1). If the
S-CSCF has two H(A1) for the user then, if authentication using one of the
H(A1) values fails, the S-CSCF may continue trying to verify the Digest
response using the other H(A1) value. After a successful verification using
the new H(A1) value, the S-CSCF should delete the old H(A1). If the S-CSCF has
already two H(A1) stored, and yet another H(A1) is pushed or pulled to the
S-CSCF, then the S-CSCF should delete the oldest H(A1) not yet successfully
used.
NOTE 4: The possibility for the S-CSCF to store two H(A1) needs to consider
the fact that a user may be slow in taking the new H(A1) into use. An S-CSCF
could receive more than one H(A1) pushed or pulled from the HSS between two
SIP requests received from the user when the user for some reason changes his
password repeatedly. In this case the last sentence of the previous paragraph
applies.
NOTE 5: It is implementation dependent in which order the S-CSCF tries the
stored H(A1) values. As a default setting, it is suggested that the S-CSCF try
a H(A1) received later before a H(A1) received earlier. It is recommended that
older H(A1) are deleted some time after receiving a new H(A1), even if the new
H(A1) value is not successfully used. A typical value for such time is
recommended to be in the order of a few minutes to give the user enough time
to take the new password into use. It is also recommended that a user is
informed to stop using the old password immediately after having received a
new one. An old password in the UE should be deleted as soon as a new password
is available in the UE.
NOTE 6: The above mechanism assumes that the user actively changes the
password, and keeps both the old and new password confidential. In the event
the user\'s password is changed due to the fact that it is compromised (e.g.,
loss of terminal etc), the usage of the above mechanism can lead to service
misuse during the time the old password remains active as it is not
immediately revoked. For such scenarios, an administrative de-registration
prior to password change would ensure that the old H(A1) is not kept in the
S-CSCF.
###### ## Annex O (normative): Enhancements to the access security to enable
TLS
# O.1 TLS
## O.1.1 TLS Access Security
TLS access security and the requirements in this Annex shall not apply to
access networks defined in 3GPP specifications.
SIP Digest, as specified in Annex N, shall be used when TLS access security,
as specified in Annex O, is used.
The provisions in Annex O are optional for implementation. The provisions in
Annex O are optional for use.
NOTE 2: If the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks in the access network between
UE and P-CSCF cannot be ruled out then the operator should configure the UEs
such that the UEs always use either TLS, according to Annex O, or IPsec,
according to the main body or Annex M, or abort the communication. Otherwise,
there is a risk of a man-in-the-middle bidding down the UE to \"no signalling
security\" without the P-CSCF even noticing, even when both, the UE and P-CSCF
support TLS and want to use it.
## O.1.2 Confidentiality protection
Operators shall take care that the deployed confidentiality protection
solution and roaming agreements fulfils the confidentiality requirements
presented in the local privacy legislation.
When TLS is used to protect signalling information between the UE and the
Pâ€‘CSCF, the following confidentiality mechanisms are provided for TLS based
access security:
1\. Negotiation of TLS related confidentiality protection features shall take
place at the TLS layer as specified in clause O.2.
2\. The UE shall always offer TLS CipherSuites to the P-CSCF to be used for
the session, as specified in clause O.2.1.
3\. The P-CSCF shall decide which TLS CipherSuites are used.
Confidentiality between CSCFs, and between CSCFs and the HSS shall rely on
mechanisms specified by Network Domain Security in TS 33.210 [5].
## O.1.3 Integrity protection
When TLS is used to protect signalling information between the UE and the
Pâ€‘CSCF, the following integrity mechanisms are provided for TLS based access
security:
1\. Negotiation of TLS related integrity protection features shall take place
at the TLS layer.
2\. The UE shall always offer TLS CipherSuites for P-CSCF to be used for the
session, as specified in clause O.2.1.
3\. The P-CSCF shall decide which TLS CipherSuites are used.
4\. The UE and the P- CSCF shall both verify that the data is sent and
received within the TLS connection. This verification is also used to detect
if the received data has been tampered with.
5\. Replay attacks and reflection attacks shall be mitigated by using the
mechanism provided by TLS.
6\. UE and P-CSCF shall verify the identities of the TLS session endpoints
according to clause O.2.1.
Integrity protection between CSCFs and between CSCFs and the HSS shall rely on
mechanisms specified by Network Domain Security in TS 33.210 [5].
## O.1.4 TLS integrity protection indicator
For non-Initial REGISTER messages protected by TLS according to this Annex,
the P-CSCF shall attach an appropriate indicator to the message when
forwarding it to the S-CSCF. This indicator shall enable the S-CSCF to
distinguish between protection by IPsec according to the main body or Annex M
and protection by TLS according to this Annex. For more details on the use of
this indicator cf. clause O.2.2. When a REGISTER message is not protected by
TLS the P-CSCF shall not include any indication about integrity protection by
TLS in the messages.
# O.2 TLS Session set-up procedure
## O.2.1 TLS Profile for TLS based access security
When the UE and the P-CSCF implement and use TLS as specified in the present
Annex O, TLS shall be implemented and used according to the TLS profile
specified in TS 33.310 [24], Annex E. For all TLS versions the provisions on
ciphersuites given in TS 33.310 [24], Annex E, shall apply.
NOTE 0: Void.
\- Authentication of the P-CSCF
\- The P-CSCF shall be authenticated by the UE by presenting a valid server
certificate. The P-CSCF certificate profile shall be based on TLS certificates
as presented in clause O.5.1.
\- Authentication of the UE
\- The P-CSCF shall not request a certificate in a Server Hello Message from
the UE. The HN shall authenticate the UE as specified in Annex N of this
specification.
\- Verification of the TLS session endpoints
\- In order for the UE to be able to trust the TLS session endpoint, the
P-CSCF certificate shall be used during the authentication procedure.
\- In order for the P-CSCF to be able to trust that the UE, which was
authenticated according to Annex N, is the TLS session endpoint, the P-CSCF
shall use the mechanism for associating the TLS Session ID with registration
parameters IP address, port, IMPI, IMPU(s), specified in clause O.2.2, and
shall have assurance that man-in-the-middle attacks can be mitigated, e.g. by
following the rules in the NOTE in clause O.1.1.
\- TLS session parameters
  * The TLS Handshake Protocol negotiates a session, which is identified by a Session ID.
\- The lifetime of a Session ID is subject to local policies of the UE and the
P-CSCF. A recommended lifetime is one hour (or at least more than the re-
REGISTRATION time out). The procedure for TLS session re-negotiation in IMS is
specified in clauses O.4.1 and O.4.2.
\- Ports
\- The P-CSCF shall be prepared to accept TLS session requests on port 5061 or
on a port published by the operator.
> \- Forwarding requests
\- The procedures for forwarding requests by the edge proxy in RFC 5626 [32]
shall apply to the P-CSCF when managing TLS connections.
NOTE 1: The use of RFC 5626 [32] in conjunction with TLS is needed so that
terminating requests can re-use an existing TLS connection.
## O.2.2 TLS session set-up during registration
The TLS session set-up procedure is necessary in order to decide what security
services to apply and when the security services start. In the IMS,
authentication of users is performed during registration. Subsequent
signalling communications in this session will be integrity protected based on
the TLS session that was established during the authentication process.
The set-up of the TLS session between the UE and the P-CSCF is based on the
TLS profile specified in clause O.2.1. The sip-sec-agree negotiation according
to RFC 3329 [21] is performed during the registration procedure to negotiate
the choice of the security mechanism. Annex H of this specification describes
the parameters of RFC 3329 [21] for the set-up of TLS sessions.
The following describes how TLS session set-up is integrated with the initial
registration procedure described in Annex N.1:
Up to and including message SM6 received by the UE, the procedures for the
cases with and without TLS are identical, except for the following:
\- In SM1 the UE includes sip-sec-agree negotiation headers according to RFC
3329 [21], which must include one header with value \"tls\" (cf. annex H), if
TLS is to be used.
\- In SM 6 the P-CSCF includes sip-sec-agree negotiation headers, which must
include one header with value \"tls\" and the highest q-value of all security
mechanisms common to UE and P-CSCF (cf. annex H), if TLS is to be used.
After receiving SM6, when TLS was selected by the P-CSCF the procedure
continues as follows:
\- the UE performs a TLS handshake with the P-CSCF; the UE shall not re-use an
existing TLS connection for initial registrations;
\- after successful establishment of a TLS connection, the UE sends SM7 over
this TLS connection, including sip-sec-agree negotiation headers;
\- the P-CSCF then sends SM8, together with a TLS integrity protection
indicator indicating the logical value \"authentication pending\".
\- the S-CSCF receives this message as SM9 and treats it according to Annex N.
If the authentication of the UE is successful the S-CSCF shall associate the
registration with the local state \"tls-protected\".
\- when the P-CSCF receives message SM11 (200 OK) it shall associate the UE\'s
IP address and port of the TLS connection with the TLS Session ID, the IMPI
and all the successfully registered IMPUs related to that IMPI. From this
point on, the P-CSCF shall not accept any SIP signalling messages outside the
TLS connection other than REGISTER messages, messages relating to emergency
services in accordance with TS 24.229 [8] and TS 23.167 [31], and error
messages.
\- after the UE has received SM12 it shall not accept any SIP signalling
messages outside the TLS connection other than responses to REGISTER messages,
messages relating to emergency services in accordance with TS 24.229 [8] and
TS 23.167 [31], and error messages.
An S-CSCF shall accept a REGISTER message with a TLS integrity protection
indicator indicating \"authentication pending\" only if it contains a
verifiable Digest value computed over a valid challenge according to Annex N.
NOTE: The S-CSCF may have a local security policy to treat messages other than
initial REGISTER messages, messages relating to emergency services, and error
messages, differently depending on whether the registration is associated with
the state \"tls-protected\".
## O.2.3 TLS session set-up prior to Initial registration
The set-up of the TLS session between the UE and the P-CSCF is based on the
TLS profile specified in clause O.2.1. Annex H of this specification describes
the parameters of RFC 3329 [21] for the set-up of TLS sessions during Initial
registration.
NOTE 1: The sip-sec-agree negotiation according to RFC 3329 [21] is not used
for this TLS variant.
The following describes how TLS session set-up is performed prior to the
initial registration procedure described in Annex N.2.1.1 (Figure N.1):
\- Prior to SM1 the UE performs a TLS handshake with the P-CSCF; the UE shall
not re-use an existing TLS connection for initial registrations.
\- After successful establishment of a TLS connection, the UE sends SM1 over
this TLS connection. All subsequent messages will be sent over this TLS
connection.
NOTE 2: Sec-agree is not used as TLS is selected from start.
\- When P-CSCF receives SM7, the P-CSCF then sends SM8, together with a TLS
integrity protection indicator indicating the logical value \"authentication
pending\".
\- The S-CSCF receives this message as SM9 and treats it according to Annex N.
If the authentication of the UE is successful the S-CSCF shall associate the
registration with the local state \"tls-protected\".
\- When the P-CSCF receives message SM11 (200 OK) it shall associate the UE\'s
IP address and port of the TLS connection with the TLS Session ID, the IMPI
and all the successfully registered IMPUs related to that IMPI. From this
point on, the P-CSCF shall not accept any SIP signalling messages outside the
TLS connection other than messages relating to emergency services in
accordance with TS 24.229 [8] and TS 23.167 [31].
\- After the UE has received SM12 it shall not accept any SIP signalling
messages outside the TLS connection other than messages relating to emergency
services in accordance with TS 24.229 [8] and TS 23.167 [31].
An S-CSCF shall accept a REGISTER message with a TLS integrity protection
indicator indicating \"authentication pending\" only if it contains a
verifiable Digest value computed over a valid challenge according to Annex N.
NOTE 3: The S-CSCF may have a local security policy to treat messages other
than initial REGISTER messages, messages relating to emergency services, and
error messages, differently depending on whether the registration is
associated with the state \"tls-protected\".
# O.3 Error cases in the set-up of TLS sessions
## O.3.1 Error cases related to TLS
### O.3.1.0 General
Errors related to SIP Digest failures are specified in Annex N. However, this
clause additionally describes how these shall be treated, related to security
setup.
### O.3.1.1 User authentication failure
If the UE response does not match with the response calculated by the S-CSCF,
the authentication of the user fails at the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF shall send a
4xx Auth_Failure message to the UE, via the P-CSCF. Afterwards, both the UE
and the P-CSCF shall close the TLS connection and delete the associated TLS
session if one was established.
### O.3.1.2 Network authentication failure
If the UE is not able to successfully authenticate the network due to failed
validation of the P-CSCF certificate, the UE shall send an alert message to
the P-CSCF, which includes the failure information as specified in TLS.
### O.3.1.3 Synchronisation failure
When the UE receives the challenge with the stale parameter in the www-
Authenticate header set to TRUE, the UE shall retry the REGISTER request with
a new encrypted response. The existing TLS session shall be used for the
retry.
### O.3.1.4 Incomplete authentication
If the UE responds to an authentication challenge from a S- CSCF, but does not
receive a reply before the request times out, the UE shall start a new
registration procedure if it still requires any IM services.
## O.3.2 Error cases related to the Security-Set-Up
The requirements in clauses 7.3.2.1 and 7.3.2.2 apply.
# O.4 Management of TLS sessions
## O.4.1 Management of TLS sessions at the UE
The UE shall be involved in only one registration procedure at a time, i.e.,
the UE shall remove any data relating to any previous incomplete
registrations, including any TLS connection and session successfully created
in a previous incomplete registration procedure.
When the UE receives a HELLO request from the P-CSCF it should initiate a
renegotiation. The UE shall send all TLS session renegotiation messages inside
the existing TLS connection.
When the TLS connection is lost the UE shall initiate a registration procedure
according to Annex N.
## O.4.2 Management of TLS sessions at the P-CSCF
The lifetime of the TLS session negotiated between the UE and the P-CSCF is
subject to local policies.
The P-CSCF may trigger a TLS session renegotiation at any time by sending a
HELLO request message to the UE. The P-CSCF shall send this message and all
TLS session renegotiation messages inside the existing TLS connection.
According to its local policy, the PCSCF may abort the communication if the UE
does not initiate a TLS session renegotiation.
When the TLS session renegotiation is successfully completed, the P-CSCF shall
replace the old Session ID with the new TLS Session ID associated with the
UE\'s IP address and port of the TLS connection, the IMPI and all the
successfully registered IMPUs related to that IMPI, cf. clause O.2.2.
The P-CSCF shall accept TLS handshake messages outside TLS connections
associated with an existing registration only during a registration procedure
according to Annex N.
## O.4.3 Authenticated re-registration
If the UE has an already active TLS session, then it shall use this to protect
the REGISTER message for re-registration.
When the P-CSCF receives a REGISTER message protected by a TLS session whose
TLS Session ID is associated with an IMPI from a previously successful
registration (cf. O.2.2), then the P-CSCF shall proceed as follows:
\- If the IMPI is present in the REGISTER message the P-CSCF shall verify that
the IMPI in the REGISTER matches the IMPI associated with the TLS Session ID.
If the IMPIs match, then the P-CSCF shall forward this REGISTER message
together with a TLS integrity protection indicator indicating the logical
value \"authentication complete\".
\- If the IMPI is not present in the REGISTER message the P-CSCF shall not
include any TLS integrity protection indicator.
When the S-CSCF receives a REGISTER message with a TLS integrity protection
indicator indicating the logical value \"authentication complete\" it may
authenticate the user by means of SIP Digest, according to the local security
policy of the S-CSCF. When the S-CSCF receives a REGISTER message with no TLS
integrity protection indicator the S-CSCF shall challenge the user by sending
a SIP 401 Auth_Challenge.
If the UE considers the TLS session no longer active at the Pâ€‘CSCF, e.g.,
after receiving no response to several protected messages, then the UE should
send an unprotected REGISTER message. In this case, the Sâ€‘CSCF shall determine
the applicable authentication scheme according to Annex P.
# O.5 TLS Certificate Profile and Validation
## O.5.1 TLS Certificate
X.509 digital certificates shall be used for authentication in TLS. All X.509
certificates shall be signed by a trusted party. The certificates shall be
profiled as specified in clause 6.1 in TS 33.310 [24] with the following
additions:
\- for TLS entity certificates:
\- CRL distribution point in the certificates shall not be mandatory.
\- The common name CN shall be the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the
server. Only a single FQDN is allowed in the CN field.
\- The subjectAltName shall contain the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of
the server.
\- for TLS CA certificates:
\- TLS CA certificates shall have no restriction in the issuer name.
## O.5.2 Certificate validation
TLS certificates shall be verified as part of a certificate chain that chains
up to a trusted Root certificate. The chain may contain intermediate
Certification Authority (CA) certificates.
Usually the first certificate in the chain is not explicitly included in the
certificate chain that is sent by the P-CSCF to the UE. In the cases where the
first certificate is explicitly included, it shall already be known to the
verifying party ahead of time and shall not contain any changes to the
certificate, with the possible exception of the certificate serial number,
validity period and the value of the signature. If changes other than the
certificate serial number, validity period and the value of the signature
exist in the root certificate that was sent by the P-CSCF to the UE in
comparison to the known root certificate, the UE shall conclude that the
certificate verification has failed.
UEs shall build the certificate chain and validate the TLS certificate
according to the \"Certification Path Validation\" procedures described in RFC
5280 [52]. In general, X.509 certificates support a liberal set of rules for
determining if the issuer name of a certificate matches the subject name of
another. The rules are such that two name fields may be declared to match even
though a binary comparison of the two name fields does not indicate a match.
RFC 5280 [52] recommends that certificate authorities restrict the encoding of
name fields so that an implementation can declare a match or mismatch using
simple binary comparison. Accordingly, the DER-encoded tbsCertificate.issuer
field of a certificate shall be an exact match to the DER-encoded
tbsCertificate.subject field of its issuer certificate. An implementation may
compare an issuer name to a subject name by performing a binary comparison of
the DER-encoded tbsCertificate.issuer and tbsCertificate.subject fields.
## O.5.3 Certificate Revocation
Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) may be checked as part of certificate path
validation. CRL infrastructure is optional to implement. The CRL, if used,
should be profiled as specified in clause 6 in TS 33.310 [24].
###### ## Annex P (normative): Co-existence of authentication schemes IMS AKA,
GPRS-IMS-Bundled Authentication, NASS-IMS-bundled authentication, SIP Digest
and Trusted Node Authentication
# P.1 Scope of this Annex
This Annex is meant to ensure that the same IMS core network entities can be
used to support various authentication schemes defined for Common IMS. In this
context, rules are developed how an xâ€‘CSCF can decide from a registration
request which authentication scheme to apply. If these rules are not adhered
to compatibility problems may arise.
The following authentication schemes are taken into account in this Annex:
\- IMS AKA without and with NAT traversal;
\- IMS AKA over TLS (used for WebRTC over IMS);
\- GPRS-IMS-Bundled Authentication (GIBA);
\- NASS-IMS-bundled authentication (NBA);
\- SIP Digest authentication (with or without TLS);
\- Trusted Node Authentication (TNA).
These authentication schemes are specified in the following places:
\- IMS AKA without NAT traversal is specified in the main body of this
specification;
\- IMS AKA with NAT traversal is specified in Annex M of this specification;
\- IMS AKA over TLS is specified in Annex X of this specification;
\- SIP Digest without TLS is specified in Annex N of this specification;
\- SIP Digest with TLS is specified in Annexes N and O of this specification;
\- NASS-IMS-bundled authentication is specified in Annex R of this
specification;
\- GPRS-IMS-Bundled Authentication is specified in Annex T of this
specification;
\- Trusted Node Authentication is specified in Annex U of this specification.
# P.2 Requirements on co-existence of authentication schemes
\- It shall be possible to deploy one IMS in a fixed mobile convergence
situation.
\- As a minimum it shall be possible to serve both fixed and mobile
subscribers at the same Sâ€‘CSCF.
\- Incompatibilities between the authentication schemes considered here shall
be avoided.
# P.3 Pâ€‘CSCF procedure selection
When the Pâ€‘CSCF receives a registration request it shall proceed as follows:
The P CSCF first checks for the presence of an Authorization header in the
REGISTER request, and, if present, checks further for the presence of an
\"integrity-protected\" flag within this header. If the flag is present in the
message from the UE, it shall be removed.
The Pâ€‘CSCF shall then check whether the Security-Client header exists in the
received REGISTER message:
  * If the REGISTER request contains a Security-Client header then, for an initial registration, the P-CSCF shall select the sec-mechanism and mode (cf. Annex H) from the corresponding parameters offered in the Security-Client header according to its priorities.
\- If the P-CSCF selects the sec-mechanism \"ipsec-3GPP\" and the mode
\"trans\" it shall perform the steps required for IMS AKA without NAT
traversal.
\- If the P-CSCF selects the sec-mechanism \"ipsec-3GPP\" and the mode \"UDP-
enc-tun\" it shall perform the steps required for IMS AKA with NAT traversal.
\- If the P-CSCF selects the sec-mechanism \"tls\" it shall perform the steps
required for SIP Digest with TLS.
  * If the REGISTER request does not contain a Security-Client header, or the P-CSCF does not select any sec-mechanism from the Security-Client header, then the P-CSCF shall behave as follows:
\- If the REGISTER request contains an Authorization header signalling an
algorithm \"AKAv2-SHA-256\", then the eP-CSCF shall perform the step required
for IMS AKA with HTTP Digest AKAv2 over TLS session set-up prior to
registration as defined for WebRTC over IMS. The eP-CSCF forwards the REGISTER
request to the S-CSCF including the \"integrity-protected\" header field
parameter with the value set to \"tls-connected\".
\- Otherwise:
\- If the REGISTER request is received over a TLS connection, the P-CSCF shall
perform the steps required for Digest with TLS prior to Initial registration
according to Clause O.2.3.
\- Otherwise
If the REGISTER request does not contain an Authorization header and was
received over an access networks defined in 3GPP specifications then the
Pâ€‘CSCF shall perform the steps required for GIBA.
If the REGISTER request was not received over a TISPAN NASS or 3GPP network
then the Pâ€‘CSCF shall perform the steps required for SIP Digest without TLS.
If the REGISTER request was received over a TISPAN NASS access, then the
Pâ€‘CSCF shall perform the steps required for NBA as well as the steps required
for SIP Digest without TLS, unless it is configured to behave differently or
the P-CSCF only supports either SIP Digest without TLS or NBA. If the NBA-
related query from the P-CSCF to the TISPAN NASS fails the P-CSCF shall not
continue to perform the NBA-related steps.
  * For a subsequent registration, the P-CSCF shall continue to use the selected mechanism.
NOTE 1: Note that Annex N states that SIP Digest authentication shall not
apply to access networks defined in 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 2: The use of Authorization headers in IMS REGISTER requests is defined
in TS 24.229 [8].
NOTE 3: The inclusion of an Authorization header in a REGISTER request is
optional for NBA and optional for SIP Digest. Therefore, when a REGISTER
request is received over a TISPAN NASS the P-CSCF cannot know whether the
request relates to SIP Digest or NBA unless it is configured to select one of
the schemes according to certain criteria, e.g. IP address range. The steps
required for SIP Digest and for NBA are not in contradiction. Rather, for NBA
the P-CSCF needs to perform additional steps, namely an exchange with the
TISPAN NASS and an inclusion of NASS location information in the REGISTER
request, on top of the steps required for SIP Digest.
A P-CSCF is said to be "PANI-aware" if it handles P-Access-Network-Info
headers as follows:
  * A "PANI-aware" Pâ€‘CSCF shall insert a P-Access-Network-Info header containing the \"network-provided\" parameter and remove any such header containing the \"network-provided\" parameter sent by the UE if the REGISTER request was received over a TISPAN NASS.
  * A "PANI-aware" Pâ€‘CSCF may insert a P-Access-Network-Info header containing the \"network-provided\" parameter and shall remove any such header containing the \"network-provided\" parameter sent by the UE if the REGISTER request was not received over a TISPAN NASS.
P-Access-Network-Info headers are used by the S-CSCF to distinguish REGISTER
requests relating to GIBA from REGISTER requests relating to NBA and SIP
Digest, which do not necessarily use an Authorization header in the initial
REGISTER request, cf. Annex P.4.2 of this specification. This motivates the
following rule:
  * Under the additional conditions that the REGISTER request contains no Authorization header and was received over an access network other than TISPAN NASS or 3GPP it is even mandatory for the Pâ€‘CSCF to insert a P-Access-Network-Info header containing the \"network-provided\" parameter.
NOTE 4: For the purposes of NBA, the P-CSCF includes NASS location information
in the P-Access-Network-Info header. But, according to TS 24.229 [8], the
Pâ€‘CSCF handles any P-Access-Network-Info header included by the UE
transparently, and, hence, an Sâ€‘CSCF could receive a P-Access-Network-Info
header with false NASS location information inserted by the UE even when the
access network is not a TISPAN NASS. This would negatively impact the security
of NASS-IMS-bundled authentication. Therefore, the removal of a P-Access-
Network-Info header with the \"network-provided\" parameter is mandated for
PANI-aware P-CSCFs even when the access network is not a TISPAN NASS.
How the Pâ€‘CSCF knows the access network type of a specific network interface
is implementation-dependent (e.g. it can know the access network type from
different UE IP address ranges or by using different network interfaces for
different access network types).
NOTE 5: The P-CSCF is not in the path for all authentication techniques. For
example, for TNA the Trusted Node communicates directly with the I-CSCF.
# P.4 Determination of requested authentication scheme in Sâ€‘CSCF
## P.4.1 Stepwise approach
When receiving a REGISTER request the Sâ€‘CSCF distinguishes among
authentication methods using the following three steps. How these steps are
performed is described in subclause P.4.2.
\- **Step 1:** the Sâ€‘CSCF first checks whether the IMS REGISTER request
relates to IMS AKA or not. In the case of IMS AKA, the Sâ€‘CSCF shall behave
according to this specification. Otherwise, the Sâ€‘CSCF proceeds to step 1a.
\- **Step 1a:** the S-CSCF checks whether the IMS REGISTER request relates to
TNA or not. In the case of TNA, the S-CSCF shall behave according to Annex U
of this specification. Otherwise, the S-CSCF proceeds to step 2.
\- **Step 2:** for a non-IMS-AKA REGISTER request, the Sâ€‘CSCF next checks
whether the request relates to GIBA. In the case of GIBA the Sâ€‘CSCF shall
behave according to Annex T of this specification. Otherwise, the Sâ€‘CSCF
proceeds to step 3.
\- **Step 3:** In step 3, the Sâ€‘CSCF requests the HSS to perform the
distinction among SIP Digest and NBA.
NOTE_p6: The distinctions in steps 1 and 2 are required because the records of
an IMS AKA or GIBA user may reside on an HSS of an earlier release. Such an
HSS requires the authentication scheme to be determined by the S-CSCF
according to the specification for IMS AKA and GIBA.
For subsequent REGISTER requests, the authentication scheme shall not change.
## P.4.2 Mechanisms for performing steps 1 to 3 in P.4.1
**Step 1:**
The Sâ€‘CSCF checks for the presence of an Authorization header in the REGISTER
request, and, if present, checks further for the presence of an \"integrity-
protected\" flag within this header. If the flag is present and has either the
value "yes" or the value "no" the Sâ€‘CSCF concludes that the REGISTER request
relates to IMS AKA. If the value of the \"integrity-protected\" flag is set to
\"tls-connected\" and \"algorithm\" parameter in the Authorization header has
the value \"AKAv2-SHA-256\", then the S-CSCF concludes that the REGISTER
request relates to IMS AKA with HTTP Digest AKAv2 over TLS session set-up
prior to registration, as defined for WebRTC over IMS in Annex X.
> NOTE 1: the \"integrity-protected\" flag and its values are defined in TS
> 24.229 [8].
**Step 1a:**
**The S-CSCF checks for the presence of an Authorization header in the
REGISTER request, and, if present, checks further for the presence of an
\"integrity-protected\" flag within this header. If the flag is present and
has the value \"auth-done\" the S-CSCF concludes that the REGISTER request
related to TNA.**
**Step 2:**
The Sâ€‘CSCF then shall proceed as follows:
If there is no Authorization header in the REGISTER request, and there is
either no P-Access-Network-Info header containing the \"network-provided\"
parameter, or there is a P-Access-Network-Info header containing the
\"network-provided\" parameter, in which the access-type parameter indicates
3GPP, and the S-CSCF supports GIBA then GIBA is used.
Otherwise, the Sâ€‘CSCF proceeds to step 3.
NOTE 2: P-Access-Network-Info headers not containing the \"network-provided\"
parameter are irrelevant for the above condition.
NOTE 3: If an S-CSCF supports both, GIBA and SIP Digest without Authorization
header in the initial REGISTER message, then the mechanism described in this
step works properly only if the P-CSCF inserts PANI headers as described in
Annex P.3 of this specification.
**Step 3:**
This step rests on three conditions:
1) The Sâ€‘CSCF shall know, e.g. using the mechanism in clause P.5, which
Pâ€‘CSCFs in the home network are PANI-aware in the sense of clause P.3.
2) It shall be ensured that Pâ€‘CSCFs in the home network, which are not PANI-
aware, do not connect to TISPAN NASS.
3) A user always uses either NBA or SIP Digest, but not sometimes NBA and
sometimes SIP Digest.
If the S-CSCF supports both SIP Digest and NBA, the Sâ€‘CSCF shall send an
authentication request to the HSS indicating that the authentication scheme is
unknown. The S-CSCF shall infer the authentication scheme used by the
subscriber from authentication request response by the HSS.
If the returned authentication scheme is NBA the S-CSCF shall proceed with
this authentication only if the Pâ€‘CSCF is in the home network and "PANI-
aware".
If the returned authentication scheme is SIP Digest the S-CSCF will learn from
the \"integrity-protected\" flag in the subsequently received REGISTER request
containing the challenge response whether SIP Digest with or without TLS is
used.
If the S-CSCF supports NBA but not SIP Digest, the S-CSCF shall send an
authentication request to the HSS indicating that the authentication scheme is
either NBA or unknown. The S-CSCF shall infer the authentication scheme used
by the subscriber from authentication request response by the HSS. If the
returned authentication scheme is NBA the S-CSCF shall proceed with this
authentication only if the P CSCF is in the home network and "PANI-aware".
If the S-CSCF supports SIP Digest but not NBA, the S-CSCF shall send an
authentication request to the HSS indicating that the authentication scheme is
either SIP digest or unknown. The S-CSCF shall infer the authentication scheme
used by the subscriber from authentication request response by the HSS. If the
returned authentication scheme is SIP Digest the S-CSCF will learn from the
\"integrity-protected\" flag in the subsequently received REGISTER request
containing the challenge response whether SIP Digest with or without TLS is
used.
# P.5 Co-existence of PANI-aware and other Pâ€‘CSCFs
This section introduces a configuration-based solution, which enables an
Sâ€‘CSCF to serve both PANI-aware Pâ€‘CSCFs and Pâ€‘CSCFs that are not PANI-aware.
Configuration-based solution:
The Sâ€‘CSCF shall be configured in such a way that it knows which Pâ€‘CSCFs are
PANI-aware, according to section P.3. The Sâ€‘CSCF knows the Pâ€‘CSCF which
forwarded the registration request from the Via header.
NOTE: Both GIBA and NBA require the Pâ€‘CSCF to be in the home network. This may
help in realising the configuration-based solution.
# P.6 Considerations on the Cx interface
The specification of certain Cx commands in TS 29.228 [39] requires the
inclusion of a private user identity (IMPI). When a registration request is
sent without an Authorization header then such a private user identity is not
available.
For GIBA, an Authorization header is never included in a registration request.
However, it is specified for GIBA in TS 23.003 [46] how to create the private
and temporary public user identity, and in TS 24.229 [8] (c.f., clause
5.3.1.2) how to derive a private user identity from a public user identity.
This derived private user identity is then used in Cx commands.
For NBA the inclusion of an Authorization header in a registration request is
optional. However, it is specified for NBA in TS 24.229 [8] (c.f., clause
5.3.1.2) how to derive a private user identity from a public user identity.
This derived private user identity is then used in Cx commands.
For SIP Digest, an Authorization header is not necessarily present in a
registration request. However, it is specified in TS 24.229 [8] (c.f. clause
5.3.1.2) how to derive a private user identity from a public user identity.
This derived private user identity is then used in Cx commands.
###### ## Annex Q (informative): Usage of the authentication mechanisms for
non-registration messages in Annexes N and O
# Q.1 General
The name "authentication mechanism" is used here synonymously with "mechanism
for message origin authentication". The following three authentication
mechanisms for non-registration messages, which can only be used in
conjunction with SIP Digest authentication for registrations, are included in
Annexes N and O:
  * TLS:
> In this procedure, the P-CSCF associates source IP address and port of the
> TLS connection with the TLS Session ID, the IMPI and all the successfully
> registered IMPUs related to that IMPI. The P-CSCF uses this association
> later, when receiving non-registration messages, to assert identities to the
> S-CSCF based on the TLS connection over which the packet was received, cf.
> Annex O.2. For more information on the assertion of identities cf. below.
> TLS is optional according to Annex O.
  * IP address check:
> In this procedure, the P-CSCF associates IP address and, if managing of
> client-initiated connections as defined in RFC 5626 [32] is used, also the
> source port of the packet in which the REGISTER message was received, with
> the identities of the user during a successful registration. The P-CSCF uses
> this association later, when receiving non-registration messages, to assert
> identities to the S-CSCF based on IP address and, if applicable, port of the
> received packet, cf. Annex N.2.1. The IP address check is mandatory
> according to Annex N.
  * SIP Digest proxy-authentication:
> In this procedure, the S-CSCF authenticates a non-registration message by
> verifying the Digest response in the Proxy-Authorization header. If the non-
> registration message contains no Proxy-Authorization header, or if the nonce
> is stale, the S-CSCF may challenge the non-registration message by sending a
> 407 SIP message with a Proxy-authenticate header containing a nonce. This
> procedure is transparent for the P-CSCF. SIP Digest proxy-authentication is
> optional according to Annex N.\ As RFC 3261 [6] does not specify the Proxy-
> Authentication-Info header for SIP, the UE cannot authenticate the HN on
> responses to non-registration requests. If such authentication is needed,
> other mechanisms may be used, e.g. TLS according to Annex O.
# Q.2 Assertion of identities by the P-CSCF
Assertion of identities by the P-CSCF is currently described in TS 24.229 [8],
clause 5.2.6.3. This clause is referenced in Annex N.2.1 of this
specification. The underlying assumption of this clause is the use of IMS AKA
with IPsec.
It is briefly recapped how identity assertion works for IMS AKA with IPsec as
this helps to understand its use in Annex N: The P-CSCF stores the IP address
and port together with the IMPI and the registered IMPUs in an "SA table"
during a successful registration. The idea of identity assertion for non-
registration message is that the P-CSCF securely knows from the source IP
address and port, tied to the IPsec security association, which user sent the
non-registration message. The P-CSCF therefore can assert to the S-CSCF that a
certain IMPU is related to the sender of the non-registration message. The
P-CSCF uses the P-Asserted-Identity header for this purpose. The S-CSCF has to
rely on the P-CSCF for the verification of user identities as the security is
provided by IPsec which terminates at the P-CSCF.
The relevant paragraphs from TS 24.229, clause 5.2.6.3, are:
> "When the P-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
> standalone transaction, and the request contains a P-Preferred-Identity
> header that matches one of the registered public user identities, the P-CSCF
> shall identify the initiator of the request by that public user identity.
>
> When the P-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
> standalone transaction, and the request contains a P-Preferred-Identity
> header that does not match one of the registered public user identities, or
> does not contain a P-Preferred-Identity header, the P-CSCF shall identify
> the initiator of the request by a default public user identity. If there is
> more than one default public user identity available, the P-CSCF shall
> randomly select one of them.
>
> NOTE 1: The contents of the From header do not form any part of this
> decision process."
It is clear that the S-CSCF needs to be certain about the user identities
associated with a non-registration message, e.g. for charging purposes or for
being able to convey the asserted identities to application servers (ASs). The
concept of identity assertion may be applied to the three authentication
mechanisms for non-registration messages, which may be used in conjunction
with SIP Digest authentication for registrations, as follows:
  * TLS:
> This case is very similar to the IPsec case as the P-CSCF knows the
> originator of a message from the TLS session (i.e. security association)
> with which the corresponding packet was protected. The procedures in TS
> 24.229, clause 5.2.6.3 apply without changes.
  * IP address check:
> This case is also similar to the IPsec and TLS cases. The P-CSCF knows the
> originator of a message from the association of IP address and, if
> applicable, port with the user identities in the IP address check table
> which it established during registration. The procedures in TS 24.229,
> clause 5.2.6.3 apply in the P-CSCF without changes. A minor change of the
> local S-CSCF behaviour is required when the mechanism is used in conjunction
> with SIP Digest proxy-authentication, cf. next paragraph.
  * SIP Digest proxy-authentication:
> This case is different from the previous cases in that proxy-authentication
> is transparent to the P-CSCF. The P-CSCF therefore cannot assert any
> identity to the S-CSCF. However, the S-CSCF has now secure knowledge of the
> user's private identity. The P-CSCF-related procedures in TS 24.229, clause
> 5.2.6.3 therefore can remain the same only when they are used in conjunction
> with the IP address check. In order to cover a potential error condition of
> a mismatch in the S-CSCF between the identity asserted by the P-CSCF by
> means of IP address check and the identity verified by the S-CSCF by means
> of Digest proxy-authentication, the rule is added that the latter shall take
> precedence as Digest proxy-authentication is the stronger of the two
> mechanisms, cf. below.
# Q.3 Strengths and boundary conditions for the use of authentication
mechanisms for non-registration messages
\- TLS:
During the set-up phase SIP Digest with TLS is somewhat weaker than IMS AKA
with IPsec because the client end of the TLS tunnel is authenticated by means
of the password-based Digest mechanism, and not the UICC-based AKA mechanism,
and because the session keys are cryptographically tied to authentication with
IMS AKA, which is not the case for SIP Digest with TLS. But once the TLS
tunnel has been set up securely, the strengths of TLS and IPsec are
comparable, and no attacks, except attacks on the security of endpoint
platforms, seem feasible. TLS requires TCP and does not work for UDP.
\- SIP Digest proxy-authentication:
This mechanism is weaker than TLS or IPsec because the message origin
authentication relies on a message authentication code (the Digest response in
the Proxy-Authorization header), which is not cryptographically tied to the
body nor to the header of the SIP message. (Note that qop = auth-int, which
would at least provide a cryptographic tie with the message body, cannot be
used in the IMS context.) Therefore, certain man-in-the-middle attacks are
theoretically conceivable where an attacker could "steal" a Digest response
from one message and append it to another. These attacks may, however, be
impractical in many deployment scenarios so that the SIP Digest proxy-
authentication provides sufficient security in these scenarios. An attacker
being only able to spoof source IP address and port would not be able to break
SIP Digest proxy-authentication.
There would be no technical problem in using SIP Digest proxy-authentication
together with TLS, but the only security advantage would be increased home
control, in case the P-CSCF is in a visited network.
\- IP address check:
> This mechanism has two main benefits:
\- One benefit of the IP address check mechanism is for operators who would
otherwise rely entirely on link layer security. If only link layer security
was provided then an attacker, although correctly authenticated at the link
layer, could spoof SIP addresses and impersonate another IMS user. The IP
address check provides the missing link between lower layers and SIP layer to
prevent this kind of attack. Reasons why operators may not want to use TLS or
SIP Digest proxy-authentication may include clients not supporting these
mechanisms, need for server certificates (in the TLS case) or performance.
\- Another benefit of the IP address check mechanism is that the existing
mechanism for identity assertion in the P-CSCF can be used in the same way as
for IMS AKA with IPsec, cf. above.
> However, the IP address check mechanism has to fulfill additional boundary
> conditions to work securely. If there is uncertainty about the boundary
> conditions of a given environment it is recommended to use TLS or SIP Digest
> proxy-authentication.
\- An attacker being able to spoof source IP address and port of another
registered user can break this mechanism. Therefore, this mechanism can only
be used in environments where IP address and port spoofing occurs neither in
the public access network nor on the customer premises. In this sense, the IP
address check mechanism is weaker than SIP Digest proxy-authentication.
\- When the IP address check mechanism is not used in conjunction with
managing of client-initiated connections as defined in RFC 5626 [32], then
only the IP address is associated with the user's identities, cf. Annex N.2.
In this case, it is additionally required to ensure that two different users
cannot share the same IP address. An example of when this could happen would
be when a UE not fully compliant to Annex N does not use support for managing
client-initiated connections, although it sits behind a NAT, and the P-CSCF
does not realise that there is a NAT. Hence the requirement in Annex N.2 that
"the P-CSCF should only accept a register request without support for managing
client-initiated connections if it can determine that no NAT is present in the
signaling path between the UE and the P-CSCF". Another example would be two
users sharing the same machine with one IP address, and not using support for
managing client-initiated connections. It depends on the environment whether
the additional requirement in this bullet can be fulfilled.
\- It may happen that a UE loses connection without being able to deregister
in the IMS, and the access network consequently re-assigns the IP address to
another user, or a NAT re-assigns the port to another user. To cover such
cases, Annex N states that the P-CSCF shall overwrite any existing entry in
the IP address check table when a new registration with a different IMPI, but
the same IP address (and port, if applicable) is successfully performed. In
the absence of malicious attacks the IP address check mechanism then works
correctly.
\- An attacker may try to exploit IP address and port re-assignment as
follows: he repeatedly attaches to the network hoping to be assigned the IP
address or port of another user who dropped off without deregistering in IMS.
If this indeed happens then any non-registration message sent by the attacker
would be accepted by the IP address check mechanism in the P-CSCF as coming
from the previous user. The attacker does not attempt to register in IMS as he
would not be able to send a correct SIP Digest response. This possibility of
attack seems difficult to exploit, but again, the likelihood for success
depends on the environment.
###### ## Annex R (normative): NASS-IMS-bundled authentication
# R.1 Overview
The main objectives and requirements on NASS-IMS-bundled authentication is
that it shall be possible to gain access to IMS based on successful access
level (NASS, cf. ETSI ES 282 004 [36]) authentication (see requirements for
Early Deployments in ETSI TS 187 001 [37]). In practice this is achieved by
associating an IMS identity with a fixed specific location from where it is
authorized to access from.
When registering to the IMS subsystem, the location of where the UE is
accessing from is verified by the NASS (which also handles the authentication
/ authorization) and if the NASS location is equal to the provisioned
location, the UE is authorized to access IMS.
It is assumed that there exist a strong relationship between the access
network and the IMS network, and that the NASS location of the UE can be
provisioned in the user profile of the HSS.
# R.2 Use Cases and Limitations
The main use case for NASS-IMS-bundled authentication is to provide access to
the IMS network for legacy equipment that cannot support the IMS access
security (see clause 6.1). This is also reflected by the requirements in ETSI
TS 187 001 [37] (see clause 4.2, _Early Deployments_), which requires the
possibility to link NASS and IMS authentication so that it is possible to
reuse the authentication of the NASS to gain access to IMS. It is the
responsibility of the end user to ensure the protection between the entity
providing access level authentication and the entity including the IMS
application.
NASS-IMS-bundled authentication has a number of deployment requirements which
restricts its usage for general usage. This includes:
\- The access network provides sufficient means to assure the IMS layer that a
specific UE/user is connecting from a specific location.
\- The access network provides sufficient means for confidentiality and
integrity of the signalling communication.
\- The access network is providing anti-IP spoofing mechanisms.
\- Nomadicity (and roaming) is not possible as the user is fixed to a specific
location and the access network and IMS network need to be tightly coupled.
# R.3 Detailed description
This clause describes how UEs authenticate to NASS and simultaneously also
gain service layer authentication using the \"single sign on\" NASS-IMS-
bundled authentication. The sequence diagram is depicted in Figure R.1.
The UE gets network attachment after the authentication at the NASS level. The
CLF in the NASS (network attachment subsystem) holds a binding between the IP
address and the location information (contains the Line Identifier), which the
UE holds per the xDSL connectivity. The selection of the authentication
(whether NBA is possible or not) is done at HSS level on IMS user basis.
1-2) The UE sends a new SIP REGISTER message to the P-CSCF. The P-CSCF
identifies whether or not a security association is required at this point,
based on the presence or absence of Security Client header and the access
network / location from where the SIP REGISTER is received. During the SIP
registration, the P-CSCF locates the CLF based on the UE\'s IP address or/and
based on the information of the access network from which the P-CSCF receives
the IP packet (P-CSCF may have several logical/physical interfaces toward
different Access Networks). P-CSCF performs a \"Location Information Query\"
towards the CLF over the e2 interface. The key for the query is the IP address
indicated by the UE.
3) The CLF sends the response to the P-CSCF including the location information
of the UE using the given IP address.
4-7) The P-CSCF appends the NASS location information to the SIP REGISTER
message and forwards the REGISTER message to the I-CSCF. The I-CSCF contacts
the HSS to authorize the UE. In case no explicit IMPI was included in the SIP
REGISTER, the I-CSCF behaves according to Annex P.6 of this specification. The
HSS responds that the UE is authorized, and the I-CSCF forwards the SIP
REGISTER message to the S-CSCF chosen to serve the UE.
8) If the S-CSCF supports both NBA and SIP digest (according to Annex N of
this specification), the S-CSCF queries the HSS over the Cx interface,
indicating that the authentication method is unknown (see Annex P.4.1, step 3,
and Annex P.4.2, step 3, of this specification, and TS 29.228 [39]). If the
S-CSCF supports NBA but not SIP digest, it queries the HSS over the Cx
interface, indicating that the authentication method is either NBA or unknown.
9) The HSS returns a message with the location information of the UE
identified by the IMPI and IMPU (if NASS--IMS-bundled authentication is the
preferred authentication scheme). The S-CSCF authenticates the UE by comparing
the location info embedded in the REGISTER message with the location
information received from the HSS. If they match, the UE is successfully
authenticated and the processing continues.
10-11) The S-CSCF sends a message to the HSS, informing that this S-CSCF is
going to serve the UE, and the HSS responds which a message providing
information that the S-CSCF needs for serving the user.
12-14) The S-CSCF sends 200 OK message to the UE.
Figure R.1: Flow Diagram for successful NASS Bundled Authentication during
Registration
The detailed procedures of NASS-IMS-bundled authentication for the CSCF\'s are
described in TS 24.229 [8]. The details of the extended interface towards the
HSS are covered in TS 29.228 [39].
###### ## Annex S (Normative): Application to 3GPP2 Access
# S.1 Introduction
This annex specifies how the material in the main body and other normative
annexes of the present document apply to 3GPP2 Access. In case there is a
conflict with another annex of the present document, then the requirements in
this annex shall override. The IP Connectivity Access Network (IP-CAN) for
3GPP2 networks, called Packet Data Subsystem (PDS), is defined in 3GPP2
X.S0011 [40].
# S.2 Application of clause 4
In 3GPP2 networks, the IMS is essentially an overlay to the PDS and has a low
dependency on the PDS. PDS can be deployed without the multimedia session
capability. The IMS Security Framework is shown in Figure S.1.
For the purposes of this Annex, the UE is not mandated to contain a UICC. The
security data at the UE for access using IMS AKA are stored according to the
requirements in clause S.4. It shall be possible for the IMS authentication
keys and functions to be logically independent to the keys and functions used
for PDS authentication. However, this does not preclude common authentication
keys and functions from being used for IMS and PDS authentication.
The IMS Security Framework also addresses the security of interfaces between
the IMS and external network domains, for example, Multimedia IP-Networks as
shown in Figure S.1. This is important since the service capability subsystem
of the IMS includes application servers that reside on untrusted third-party
networks, and which can access network functionality.
Figure S.1: The IMS security architecture
There are seven different security associations and different needs for
security protection for IMS (including SIP AS nodes) and they are numbered 1
through 7 in Figure S.1.
1\. Provides mutual authentication between the UE and the S-CSCF. The HSS
delegates the performance of subscriber authentication to the S-CSCF. The
long-term key in the UE and the HSS is associated with the user private
identity (IMPI). The UE will have one (network internal) user private identity
(IMPI) and at least one external user public identity (IMPU).
The security associations 2 through 5 are as defined in clause 4 except that
requirements in clause S.5 of this specification shall apply for security
protection.
6\. Provides security between a SIP-capable node residing in an external IP
network, and the HSS. This security association is covered in clause S.5 of
this specification The SIP-capable node is a SIP Application Server and may
also reside within the HN. However, this security association is only
applicable when the SIP AS resides in an external IP network. If the SIP AS
resides in the Home Network, then the security association 3 applies.
7\. Provides security between SIP-capable nodes located in different networks.
It differs from security association 4 in that the SIP-capable node here is
the SIP Application Server. Using SIP, this type of application server may
communicate with network entities to offer service control and content, access
functionality provided in the operator's network, and manage bearers. This
security association is covered in clause S.5 of this specification. It is
only applicable when the SIP AS resides in an external IP network. If the SIP
AS resides in the Home Network, then security association 5 applies.
Not all security mechanisms in this specification provide all of the above.
There may exist other interfaces and reference points in IMS, which have not
been addressed above. Those interfaces and reference points reside within the
IMS, either within the same security domain or between different security
domains. Clause S.5 of this specification is intended to address security
issues for all such interfaces. The present document assumes that the IP-CAN
supports secure communications via standard IETF protocols RFC 4301 [53].
The confidentiality and integrity protection for SIP-signaling is provided in
a hop-by-hop fashion. The first hop i.e. between the UE and the P-CSCF is
specified in clause S.3. The other hops, inter-domain and intra-domain are
specified in clause S.5 of this specification.
# S.3 Application of clauses 5 through 9
The user's subscription is authenticated by the S-CSCF (home service
provider). The security association between the UE and the first access point
into the operator's network (P-CSCF) is negotiated based on the protocol
defined in RFC 3329 [21]. The options that may be negotiated using RFC 3329
[21], which are defined in 3GPP specifications, are: tls and ipsec-3gpp. If
the negotiated protocol is ipsec-3gpp and no NAT device is present between the
UE and the P-CSCF then clauses 5 through 9 of the main body of the present
document shall apply. If the negotiated mechanism is "ipsec-3gpp" and a NAT
device is present between the UE and the P-CSCF, then Annex M of this
specification shall apply. If the negotiated mechanism is tls then Annex O of
this specification shall apply.
**NOTE1:** RFC 3329 [21] also allows to negotiate the mechanisms digest,
ipsec-ike, and ipsec-man for use between UE and P-CSCF. They are defined in
SIP RFC 3261 [6].
**NOTE2:** RFC 3329 only defines the security mechanisms between the SIP
client and the next-hop SIP entity, i.e. the P-CSCF. In particular, if SIP
Digest is negotiated by means of RFC 3329 then Digest has to be run between UE
and P-CSCF, with the P-CSCF acting as the server. So, RFC 3329 cannot be used
to negotiate SIP Digest authentication in IMS, which occurs between UE and
S-CSCF.
When using security mechanisms or protocols specified in the present document
(including ipsec-3gpp), the following exceptions shall apply:
\- The clause 8 on ISIM is replaced with the clause S.4 on 3GPP2 AKA
Credentials.
\- Any references to ISIM or USIM in clause 5 to 7 and clause M.5 to M.7 are
replaced with 3GPP2 AKA Credential.
\- The references to TS 33.210 are replaced with a reference to clause S.5 of
this specification.
# S.4 3GPP2 AKA Credentials
## S.4.1 Realisations of 3GPP2 AKA Credentials
For the purposes of this Annex, the following implementation options for 3GPP2
AKA Credentials are permitted:
\- Use of a distinct ISIM application which does not share security functions
with the CSIM or USIM;
\- Use of a distinct ISIM application which does share security functions with
the CSIM;
\- Use of a distinct USIM application on a UICC;
\- Use of a distinct IMC which does not share security functions with the UIM;
\- Use of a distinct IMC which does share security functions with the UIM;
\- Use of a CSIM application on a UICC (3GPP2 C.S0065 [45] );
\- Use of a UIM or R-UIM (3GPP2 C.S0023 [41] ).
There shall only be one 3GPP2 AKA credential for each IMPI.
If there is an IMC or ISIM, then the IMC or ISIM shall always be used for IMS
authentication using AKA.
The IMS subscriber shall not be able to modify or enter the IMPI. The IMS
subscriber shall not be able to modify or enter the Home Domain Name.
If the IMS specific identities are not present, i.e. neither an ISIM or an IMC
is used as the 3GPP2 AKA credential, the IMS identities (e.g., IMPI/IMPU)
shall be derived from the Mobile Station Identity (MSID) used to access
cdma2000 access networks as specified in clause 13 of TS 23.003 [46]. The MSID
can be either IMSI or Mobile Indentification Number (MIN).
The AKA algorithms for 3GPP2 networks are specified in 3GPP2 S.S0055 [43] and
3GPP2 S.S0078 [44].
The ISIM application as defined in clause 8.1 and the rules for sharing
security functions between an ISIM application and USIM given in clause 8.2
apply to the above cases.
At UE power off, the existing SAs (session keys and related information) shall
be deleted.
# S.5 Network Domain Security for IMS
## S.5.1 General
This clause describes security mechanisms for all communication except
interfaces 1 and 2 of Figure S.1, including the Home Network, Serving Network,
and any 3^rd^ party network nodes (such as SIP Application Servers). This
clause is applicable independent of negotiated IMS access security mechanism.
When providing security between network elements, where at least one is in a
3GPP2 network (this includes both legacy 3GPP2 MMD networks and ones migrating
to Common IMS), then the requirements in the rest of clause S.5 or TS 33.210
[5] may be used. Otherwise TS 33.210 [5] shall be used.
NOTE: For migration to Common IMS and scalability purposes, it is recommended
that 3GPP2 systems migrate to using NDS/IP for securing inter-domain IMS
signalling traffic as specified in TS 33.210 [5].
## S.5.2 Inter-domain Domain Security
Referring to Figure S.1, interfaces 4 and 7 provides transport security
between different networks for SIP capable nodes. Interface 6 provides
security for communications between a SIP Application Server, residing in an
external network, and the HSS. There may be other interfaces to nodes outside
the Home Network, which are also intended to be covered by this clause. The
involved nodes shall be capable of IPsec (cf. RFC 4301 [53)]. Privacy
protection shall be applied with cryptographic strength greater than DES.
Integrity protection shall be applied. IPsec may be used in either transport
mode or tunnel mode; when used in tunnel mode, one or both of the network
security domains may use Security Gateways. Security associations between
nodes in different networks shall be negotiated using IPsec/IKE(cf. RFC 4301
53 [)].
It is necessary that nodes outside the home network should be secure and
trustworthy, perhaps using mechanisms such as firewalls, packet filters, and
so on. However such details are outside the scope of this clause.
## S.5.3 Intra-domain Domain Security
The interface labeled 5 in Figure S.1 is between SIP-capable nodes in the same
network security domain. The interface labeled 3 in Figure S.1 is between the
I-CSCF/S-CSCF and the HSS. There may be other interfaces to nodes inside the
Home Network, which are also intended to be covered by this clause. As these
interfaces exist entirely within one network security domain, the
administrative authority may choose any mechanism to secure this interface,
including physical security where appropriate. Cryptographic methods of
security, if applied, shall include both privacy and integrity protection, and
be at least as strong as the IPsec(RFC 4301 [53], RFC 7296 [82]) profile
defined in clause S.5.4).
## S.5.4 Profiles of Network Domain Security Methods
### S.5.4.1 General
The profiles specified in this clause shall apply to clauses S.5.2 and S.5.3.
### S.5.4.2 Support of IPsec ESP
#### S.5.4.2.1 General
For the interfaces security protection between IMS network elements, this
clause specifies the protection using IPsec as specified in RFC 4301 [53]. The
key management and distribution architecture is based on the IPsec IKE (RFC
4301 [53], RFC 7296 [82]) protocols. IKEv2 shall follow the 3GPP IKEv2 profile
as defined in clause 5.4 of TS 33.210 [5] and clause 6.2.1b of TS 33.310 [24].
The security services provided by network domain security are:
\- data integrity;
\- data origin authentication;
\- anti-replay protection;
\- confidentiality (optional);
\- limited protection against traffic flow analysis when confidentiality is
applied.
The IPsec security protocol shall always be ESP. Integrity protection/message
authentication together with anti-replay protection shall always be used.
IPsec ESP should be used with both encryption and integrity protection for all
SIP signaling traversing inter-security domain boundaries.
IPsec offers a set of security services, which is determined by the negotiated
IPsec security associations. That is, the IPsec SA defines which security
protocol to be used, the mode, and the endpoints of the SA.
#### S.5.4.2.2 Support of ESP authentication and encryption
For IMS signaling traffic, ESP shall always be used to provide data integrity,
data origin authentication, and anti-replay protection services, thus the
ESP_NULL authentication algorithm shall not be allowed for use. ESP shall
follow the 3GPP ESP profile as defined in clause 5.3 of TS 33.210 [5].
#### S.5.4.3 Support of TLS
This section specifies the use of TLS, for transport protection between IMS
network elements. Where TLS is used for transport protection, implementations
shall support TLS according to the TLS profile specified in TS 33.310 [24],
Annex E. Implementations shall support mutual, certificate-based
authentication, and may support (and attempt to negotiate the use of) other
authentication methods such as pre-shared secret keys (PSK). The security
services provided by network domain security are:
\- data integrity;
\- data origin authentication;
\- anti-replay protection;
TLS provides transport-layer security over connection-oriented protocols (for
the purposes of the present document, TCP); \"tls\" (signifying TLS over TCP)

value or a SIP-URI. TLS is most suited to architectures in which hop-by-hop
security is required between hosts with no pre-existing trust association.
Implementations shall firstly prefer AES cipher suites, and secondly prefer
ephemeral Diffie-Hellman cipher suites during TLS negotiation. Mutual
authentication shall be required for all TLS connections.
###### ## Annex T (normative): GPRS-IMS-Bundled Authentication (GIBA) for Gm
interface
# T.1 Introduction
3GPP IMS provides an IP-based session control capability based on the SIP
protocol. IMS can be used to enable services such as push-to-talk, instant
messaging, presence and conferencing. It is understood that \"early\"
implementations of these services will exist that are not fully compliant with
3GPP IMS.
It is expected that there will be a need to deploy some IMS-based services
before products are available which fully support the 3GPP IMS security
features defined in the main body of this specification. Non-compliance with
security features specified in the main body of this specification is expected
to be a problem mainly at the UE side, because of the potential lack of
support of the USIM/ISIM interface (especially in 2G-only devices) and because
of the potential inability to support IPsec on some UE platforms.
Although full support of security features specified in the main body of this
specification is preferred from a security perspective, it is acknowledged
that early IMS implementations will exist which do not support these features.
Therefore, there is a need to ensure that simple, yet adequately secure,
mechanisms are in place to protect against the most significant security
threats that will exist in early IMS implementations.
This Annex documents an interim security solution for early IMS
implementations that are not fully compliant with the IMS security
architecture specified in the main body of this specification. For security
reasons, the provisions in this Annex only apply to IMS procedures used over
the 3GPP PS domain.
# T.2 Requirements
The following requirements apply for GPRS-IMS-Bundled Authentication (GIBA):
**Low impact on existing entities:** GIBA should be such that impacts on
existing entities, especially on the UE, are minimised and would be quick to
implement. It is especially important to minimise impact on the UE to maximise
interoperability with early IMS UEs.
**Adequate level of security:** Although it is recognised that the GIBA
solution will be simpler than the fully compliant IMS security solution as
specified in the main body of this specification, it should still provide an
adequate level of security to protect against the most significant security
threats that will exist in early IMS implementations. As a guide, the strength
of subscriber authentication should be comparable to the level of
authentication provided for existing chargeable services in mobile networks.
**Smooth and cost effective migration path to fully compliant solution:**
Clearly, any security mechanisms developed for early IMS systems will provide
a lower level of protection compared with that offered by the fully compliant
IMS security solution. The security mechanisms developed for early IMS systems
should therefore be considered as an interim solution and migration to the
fully compliant IMS security solution should take place as soon as suitable
products become available at an acceptable cost. In particular, the GIBA
solution should not be used as a long-term replacement for the fully compliant
IMS security solution. It is important that the GIBA solution allows a smooth
and cost-effective migration path to the fully compliant IMS security
solution.
**Co-existence with fully compliant solution:** It is clear that UEs
supporting the GIBA solution will need to be supported even after fully
compliant IMS UEs are deployed. The GIBA solution should therefore be able to
co-exist with the fully compliant IMS security solution. In particular, it
shall be possible for the SIP/IP core to differentiate between a subscription
using the GIBA mechanism and a subscription using the fully compliant IMS
security solution.
**Protection against bidding down:** It should not be possible for an attacker
to force the use of the GIBA solution when both the UE and the network support
the fully compliant IMS security solution.
**No restrictions on the type of charging model:** Compared with fully
compliant IMS security solution, the GIBA solution should not impose any
restrictions on the type of charging model that can be adopted.
**Impact on interfaces:** Interfaces that are impacted by the GIBA solution
should be adequately documented to ensure interoperability between vendors.
**Support access over 3GPP PS domain:** It is a requirement to support secure
access over the 3GPP GPRS/UMTS access.
**Low impact on provisioning:** The impact on provisioning should be low
compared with the fully compliant IMS security solution.
# T.3 Threat Scenarios
## T.3.0 General
To understand what controls are needed to address the security requirements,
it is useful to describe some of the threat scenarios.
NOTE: There are many other threats, which are outside the scope of this Annex.
## T.3.1 Impersonation on IMS level using the identity of an innocent user
The scenario proceeds as follows:
\- Attacker A attaches to GPRS, GGSN allocates IP address, IPA
\- Attacker A registers in the IMS using his IMS identity, IDA
\- Attacker A sends SIP invite using his own source IP address (IPA) but with
the IMS identity of B (IDB).
If the binding between the IP address on the bearer level, and the public and
private user identities is not checked then the attacker will succeed, i.e. A
pays for IP connectivity but IMS service is fraudulently charged to B. The
fraud situation is made worse if IP flow based charging is used to \'zero
rate\' the IP connectivity.
The major problem is however that without this binding multiple users within a
group \"of friends\" could sequentially (or possibly simultaneously) share
B\'s private/public user identities, and thus all get (say) the push-to-talk
service by just one of the group paying a monthly subscription. Without
protection against this attack, operators could be restricted to IP
connectivity based tariffs and, in particular, would be unable to offer
bundled tariffs. This is unlikely to provide sufficiently flexibility in
today\'s market place.
## T.3.2 IP spoofing
The scenario proceeds as follows:
\- User B attaches to GPRS, GGSN allocates IP address, IPB
\- User B registers in the IMS using his IMS identity, IDB
\- Attacker A sends SIP messages using his own IMS identity (IDA) but with the
source IP address of B (IPB)
If the binding between the IP address that the GGSN allocated the UE in the
PDP context activation and the source IP address in subsequent packets is not
checked then the attacker will succeed, i.e. A pays for IMS service but IP
connectivity is fraudulently charged to B. Note that this attack only makes
sense for IMS services with outgoing traffic only because the attacker will
not receive any incoming packets addressed to the IMS identity that he is
impersonating.
## T.3.3 Combined threat scenario
The scenario proceeds as follows:
\- User B attaches to GPRS, GGSN allocates IP address, IPB
\- User B registers in the IMS using his IMS identity, IDB
\- Attacker A sends SIP messages using IMS identity (IDB) and source IP
address (IPB)
If the bindings mentioned in the scenarios in clause T.3.1 and T.3.2 are not
checked then the attacker will succeed, i.e. A fraudulently charges both IP
connectivity and the IMS service to B. Note this attack only makes sense for
IMS services with outgoing traffic only because the attacker will not receive
any incoming packets addressed to the IMS identity that he is impersonating.
# T.4 GIBA Security Mechanism
The GIBA security solution works by creating a secure binding in the HSS
between the public/private user identity (SIP-level identity) and the IP
address currently allocated to the user at the GPRS level (bearer/network
level identity). Therefore, IMS level signaling, and especially the IMS
identities claimed by a user, can be connected securely to the PS domain
bearer level security context.
When using IPv6, stateless autoconfiguration is the only IP address allocation
method mandatorily supported by the terminal in GPRS. With this method, a
primary PDP context is bound only to the 64-bit prefix of the 128-bit IPv6
address, not the full address. This needs to be taken into account in GIBA
procedures.
The GGSN terminates each user\'s PDP context and has assurance that the IMSI
used within this PDP context is authenticated. The GGSN shall provide the
user\'s IP address (or the prefix in the case of IPv6 stateless
autoconfiguration), IMSI and MSISDN to a RADIUS server in the HSS over the Gi
interface when a PDP context is activated towards the IMS system. The HSS has
a binding between the IMSI and/or MSISDN and the IMPI and IMPU(s), and is
therefore able to store the currently assigned IP address (or the prefix in
the case of IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration) from the GGSN against the
user\'s IMPI and/or IMPU(s). The precise way of the handling of these
identities in the HSS is outside the scope of standardization. The GGSN
informs the HSS when the PDP context is deactivated/modified so that the
stored IP address (or the prefix in the case of IPv6 stateless
autoconfiguration) can be updated in the HSS. When the S-CSCF receives a SIP
registration request or any subsequent requests for a given IMPU, it checks
that the IP address (or the prefix in the case of IPv6 stateless
autoconfiguration) in the SIP header (verified by the network) matches the IP
address (or the prefix in the case of IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration) that
was stored against that subscriber\'s IMPU in the HSS.
The mechanism assumes that the GGSN does not allow a UE to successfully
transmit an IP packet with a source IP address (or the prefix in the case of
IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration) that is different to the one assigned during
PDP context activation. In other words, the GGSN must prevent \"source IP
spoofing\". The mechanism also assumes that the P-CSCF checks that the source
IP address in the SIP header is the same as the source IP address in the IP
header received from the UE (the assumption here, as well as for the full
security solution, is that no NAT is present between the GGSN and the P-CSCF).
The mechanism prevents an attacker from using his own IP address in the IP
header but spoofing someone else\'s IMS identity or IP address in the SIP
header, so that he pays for GPRS level charges, but not for IMS level charges.
The mechanism also prevents an attacker spoofing the address in the IP header
so that he does not pay for GPRS charges. It therefore counters the threat
scenarios given in clause T.3.
# T.5 Restrictions imposed by GIBA
The mechanism assumes that only one contact IP address is associated with one
IMPI. Furthermore, the mechanism supports the case that there may be several
IMPUs associated with one IMPI.
In GIBA the IMS user authentication is performed by linking the IMS
registration (based on an IMPI) to a PDP context (based on an authenticated
IMSI). The mechanism here assumes that there is a one-to-one relationship
between the IMSI for bearer access and the IMPI for IMS access.
For the purposes of the present document, an APN, which is used for IMS
services, is called an IMS APN. An IMS APN may be also used for non-IMS
services. The mechanism described in the present document further adds the
requirement on the UE that it allows only one APN for accessing IMS for a PLMN
and that all active PDP contexts, for a single UE, associated with that IMS
APN use the same IP address at any given time.
The GIBA mechanism relies on the Via header remaining unchanged between the UE
and the S-CSCF for requests and responses sent in the direction from the UE to
the S-CSCF.
Due to the fact that the Authorization header is not included in REGISTER
requests in GIBA, the I-CSCF is unable to use the presence or absence of the
\"integrity-protected\" parameter to distinguish initial and non-initial
REGISTER messages. Therefore the S-CSCF reselection procedure described in
clause 5.3.1.3 of TS 24.229 [8] cannot be used.
GIBA requires the GGSN to be in the home network.
GIBA works with UEs that contain a SIM or a USIM, whereas full IMS security
requires a USIM or ISIM. GIBA does not authenticate at the IMS level. Instead,
it relies on bearer level security at the GPRS or UMTS PS level. Because there
is no key agreement, IPsec security associations are not set up between UE and
P-CSCF, as they are in the full IMS security solution.
The solution works by binding the IMS level transactions to the GPRS or UMTS
PS domain security association established at a GPRS or UMTS PS domain level.
In doing so, it creates a dependency between SIP and the PS bearer, which does
not exist with the full IMS security solution. This means that the interim
solution does not provide as high a degree of access network independency as
the full solution. In particular, the solution does not currently support
scenarios where IMS services are offered over WLAN. If support for WLAN access
is required then the full solution must be used or GIBA must be extended to
cover WLAN access.
GIBA derives the public user identity used in the REGISTER request from the
IMSI. Consequently, the same derived public user identity cannot be
simultaneously registered from multiple terminals, using only GIBA
registration procedures. However, simultaneous registration of a public user
identity from one terminal using GIBA, and from other terminals using fully
compliant IMS security is not precluded.
Unlike in fully compliant IMS security, the private user identity is not
included in the REGISTER requests when GIBA is used for registration, re-
registration and mobile-initiated de-registration procedures. Subsequently,
all REGISTER requests from the UE shall use the IMSI-derived IMPU as the
public user identity even when the implicitly registered IMPUs are available
at the UE. Otherwise, the I-CSCF would be unable to derive the private user
identity that is needed to query the HSS in certain Cx messages.
# T.6 Protection against IP address spoofing in GGSN
All GGSNs that offer connection to IMS shall implement measures to prevent
source IP address spoofing. Specifically, a UE attached to the GGSN shall not
be able to successfully transmit an IP packet with a source IP address (or the
prefix in the case of IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration) that is different to
the one assigned by the GGSN during PDP context activation. If IP address
spoofing is detected the GGSN shall drop the packet. It shall be possible for
the GGSN to log the event in its security log against the subscriber
information (IMSI/MSISDN), e.g. based on operator configuration.
# T.7 Interworking cases
For the purposes of the interworking considerations in this clause, it is
assumed that the IMS entities Pâ€‘CSCF, Iâ€‘CSCF, Sâ€‘CSCF and HSS reside in the
home network and all support the same variants of IMS, i.e. all support either
only GIBA, or only fully compliant IMS security, or both.
NOTE 1: It is compatible with the considerations in the document that the UE
uses different APNs to indicate the IMS variant currently used by the UE, in
case the P-CSCF functionality is split over several physical entities.
It is expected that both fully compliant UEs implementing the security
mechanisms in the main body of this specification (denoted \"fully compliant
IMS security\" in the following) and UEs implementing GIBA specified in this
Annex (denoted \"GIBA security\" in the following) will access the same IMS.
In addition, IMS networks will support only fully compliant IMS UEs, GIBA UEs,
or both. Both UEs and IMS networks must therefore be able to properly handle
the different possible interworking cases.
Since GIBA security does not require the security headers specified for fully
compliant IMS UEs, these headers shall not be used for GIBA security. The
REGISTER request sent by an early IMS UE security to the IMS network shall not
contain the security headers specified by the main body of this specification
(Authorization and Security-Client).
As a result, GIBA security UEs shall not add an explicit indication for the
security used to the IMS signaling. An IMS network supporting both GIBA
security and fully compliant IMS security UEs shall use GIBA security for
authenticating the UE during registrations that do not contain the security
headers specified by the main body of this specification (Authorization and
Security-Client).
Without sending an Authorization Header in the initial REGISTER request, GIBA
UEs only provide the IMS public identity (IMPU), but not the IMS private
identity (IMPI) to the network (this is only present in the Authorization
header for fully compliant IMS security UEs).
During the process of user registration for GIBA security, the Cx interface
carries the privateuser identity in Cx-UAR requests (sent by I-CSCF) and Cx-
MAR as well as Cx-SAR requests (sent by S-CSCF). The private user identity
within these requests is derived in accordance to TS 24.229 [8] (clause
5.3.1.2 and 5.4.1.2.1E).
If the S-CSCF receives an indication that the UE is an GIBA UE, then it shall
be able to select the GIBA in the Cx-MAR request.
For interworking between GIBA security and fully compliant IMS security
implementations during IMS registration, an ME that implements the full IMS
security solution as specified in the main body of this specification (or both
GIBA and full IMS security) shall not attempt to register using the full IMS
security solution if neither a USIM nor a ISIM is present. The following cases
shall be supported:
1\. Both ME and IMS network support GIBA security only.
IMS registration shall take place as described by the present document. This
applies regardless of whether SIM or USIM/ISIM is in use.
2\. ME supports GIBA security only, IMS network supports both GIBA security
and fully compliant IMS security.
IMS registration shall take place as described by the present document. This
applies regardless of whether SIM or USIM/ISIM is in use.
3\. ME supports both, IMS network supports GIBA security only.
The ME shall check the smartcard application in use.
> If a SIM is in use, then it shall start with a GIBA security procedure, else
> it shall start with the fully compliant IMS Registration procedure.
>
> In the second case, the GIBA P-CSCF shall answer with a 420 (Bad Extension)
> failure, since it does not recognize the method mandated by the Proxy-
> Require header that is sent by the UE in the initial REGISTER request.
NOTE 2: The Proxy-Require header cannot be ignored by the P-CSCF.
The UE shall, after receiving the error response, send a GIBA registration,
i.e., shall send a new REGISTER request without the fully compliant IMS
security headers.
NOTE 3: If the UE already has knowledge about the IMS network capabilities
(which could for example be preconfigured in the UE), the appropriate
authentication method can be chosen. The UE can use fully compliant IMS
security, if the network supports this, otherwise the UE can use GIBA
security.
4\. ME and IMS network support both.
> The ME shall check the smartcard application in use.
>
> If a USIM/ISIM application is in use, then the ME shall start with the fully
> compliant IMS security registration procedure. The network, with receiving
> the initial REGISTER request, receives indication that the IMS UE is fully
> compliant and shall continue as specified by the main body of this
> specification.
>
> If a SIM is in use, then the ME shall start with the GIBA security
> registration procedure. If the ME starts with the fully compliant IMS
> security registration procedure when a SIM is in use, this is an error case
> to be handled as follows: when the S-CSCF requests authentication vectors
> from the HSS, the HSS will discover that a SIM is in use and returns an
> error. The S-CSCF shall answer with a 403 (Forbidden). After receiving the
> 403 response, the UE shall stop the attempt to register with this network.
5\. ME supports GIBA security only, IMS network supports fully compliant IMS
security only.
The UE sends a REGISTER request to the IMS network that does not contain the
security headers required by fully compliant IMS security. The fully compliant
IMS security P-CSCF will detect that the Security-Client header is missing and
return a 4xx response, as described in clause 5.2.2 of TS 24.229 [8]. This
applies regardless of whether SIM or USIM/ISIM is in use.
6\. ME supports fully compliant IMS security only, IMS network supports GIBA
security only.
> A ME supporting Full IMS security only is not aware of GIBA security, so its
> behaviour is expected to be compliant with the procedures defined in the
> main body of this specification. Based on this, if a SIM is in use, the ME
> should not attempt to register using the full IMS security solution.
> Whatever attempt would fail anyway, as Full IMS security requires ISIM/USIM.
>
> If a USIM/ISIM application is in use, then the ME shall start with the fully

>
> 7\. ME supports fully compliant IMS access security only, IMS network

8\. ME supports both, IMS network supports fully compliant IMS access security
only.
> The ME shall check the smartcard application in use.
>
> If a USIM/ISIM application is in use, then the ME shall start with the fully

>
> If a SIM is in use, then the ME shall start with the GIBA security

# T.8 Message Flows
## T.8.1 Successful registration
Figure T.1 below describes the message flow for successful registration to the
IMS that is specified by the early IMS security solution.
NOTE: The \"received\" parameter is only sent from P-CSCF to S-CSCF under the
conditions given in RFC 3261 [6].
The procedure is as follows.
The UE starts by setting up a PDP context.
When a PDP context has been set up successfully, the UE sends a SIP REGISTER.
The REGISTER message contains the IP address and the IMPU of the UE.
The GGSN checks that the IP address provided in the REGISTER message matches
the IP address allocated to the UE when the PDP context was set up. When the
IP address has been verified, the GGSN forwards the REGISTER message to the
P-CSCF.
The P-CSCF checks the source IP address against the IP address in the Via
header of the REGISTER message. If the source IP address differs from the IP
address in the Via header, the P-CSCF adds the source IP address to a received
parameter in the Via header. The P-CSCF then forwards the REGISTER to the
I-CSCF in the home network.
NOTE: The source IP address differs from the IP address in the Via header only
in case the UE is malicious or the UE is misbehaving for some reason.
The I-CSCF contacts the HSS to authorize the UE. The HSS responds that the UE
is authorized, and the I-CSCF forwards the SIP REGISTER message to the S-CSCF
chosen to serve the UE.
The S-CSCF contacts the HSS and indicates that GIBA is used to authenticate
the UE. The HSS returns the stored IP address to the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF then
checks the IP address returned by the HSS against the IP address obtained in
the REGISTER message ((if present, the received by parameter shall be used).
The S-CSCF sends a message to the HSS, informing that this S-CSCF is going to
serve the UE, and the HSS responds which a message providing information that
the S-CSCF needs for serving the UE.
The S-CSCF returns a SIP 200 OK to the UE, indicating that the registration is
successfully completed.

Figure T.1: Message sequence for early IMS security showing a successful
registration
## T.8.2 Unsuccessful registration
Figure T.2 below gives an example message flow for the unsuccessful attempt of
an attacker trying to spoof the IMS identity of a valid IMS user.
NOTE: Again, the \"received\" parameter is only present between P-CSCF to
S-CSCF under the conditions given in RFC 3261 [6].
The procedure is as follows.
UE1 sets up a PDP context. UE2 already has an active PDP context.
After UE1 has set up the PDP context, UE2 attempts to REGISTER using the IP
address allocated to UE2, but using the IMPU of UE1.
The GGSN checks that the IP address provided in the REGISTER message matches
the IP address allocated to the UE2 when the PDP context was set up. When the
IP address has been verified, the GGSN forwards the REGISTER message to the
P-CSCF.
The P-CSCF checks the source IP address against the IP address in the Via
header of the REGISTER message. If the source IP address differs from the IP
address in the Via header, the P-CSCF adds the source IP address to a received
parameter in the Via header. The P-CSCF then forwards the REGISTER to the
I-CSCF in the home network.
The S-CSCF contacts the HSS and indicates that GIBA is used to authenticate
the UE. The HSS returns the stored IP address to the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF then
checks the IP address returned by the HSS against the IP address obtained in
the REGISTER message (if present, the received by parameter shall be used).
Since the IP address stored by the HSS (the IP address of UE1) does not match
the IP address in the REGISTER (IP address of UE2), the authentication fails.
The S-CSCF returns a 403 Forbidden to the UE, indicating that the registration
failed.
Figure T.2: Message sequence for early IMS security showing an unsuccessful
identity theft
## T.8.3 Successful registration for a selected interworking case
Figure T.3 below describes the message flow for successful registration to the
IMS in the case that the UE supports both fully compliant IMS and GIBA
security and the network supports GIBA security only. This case is denoted as
case 3 in clause 6.2.6.
NOTE: The \"received\" parameter is only sent from P-CSCF to S-CSCF under the
conditions given in RFC 3261 [6].
The procedure is as follows.
The UE starts by setting up a PDP context.
When a PDP context has been set up successfully, the UE sends a SIP REGISTER.
As the UE supports fully compliant IMS security, the UE attempts to register
using the procedures of fully compliant IMS security.
The P-CSCF does not support fully compliant IMS security, and returns an
indication back to the UE that the network does not support fully compliant
IMS security.
The UE sends a new REGISTER, this time according to the procedures of GIBA
security. The REGISTER message contains the IP address and the IMPU of the UE.
The GGSN checks that the IP address provided in the REGISTER message matches
the IP address allocated to the UE when the PDP context was set up. When the
IP address has been verified, the GGSN forwards the REGISTER message to the
P-CSCF.
The P-CSCF checks the source IP address against the IP address in the Via
header of the REGISTER message. If the source IP address differs from the IP
address in the Via header, the P-CSCF adds the source IP address to a received
parameter in the Via header. The P-CSCF then forwards the REGISTER to the
S-CSCF.
The S-CSCF contacts the HSS and indicates that GIBA is used to authenticate
the UE. The HSS returns the stored IP address to the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF then
checks the IP address returned by the HSS against the IP address obtained in
the REGISTER message (if present, the received by parameter shall be used).
The S-CSCF sends a message to the HSS, informing that this S-CSCF is going to
serve the UE, and the HSS responds which a message providing information that
the S-CSCF needs for serving the UE.
The S-CSCF returns a SIP 200 OK to the UE, indicating that the registration is
successfully completed.

UE supports both fully compliant IMS security and GIBA security and network
supports GIBA security only
###### ## Annex U (normative): Trusted Node Authentication (TNA)
# U.1 Overview
The main objectives and requirements on Trusted Node Authentication is that it
shall be possible to gain access to IMS based on successful access level
authentication being provided by a trusted node in the network which provides
an interworking function towards the IMS. In practice this is achieved by
having this trusted node take on the role of both the UE and the P-CSCF from
an IMS perspective. One example of such a scenario is the MSC Server enhanced
for ICS as described in TS 23.292 [50].
When registering to the IMS subsystem, the trust of the registering node is
verified by the I-CSCF based on the visited network information (see TS 29.228
[39]) and network domain security (see TS 33.210 [5]). If the node is
considered trusted, then the request is forwarded to the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF
looks for an indication in the \"integrity-protected\" flag that
authentication is already performed by the trusted node.
# U.2 Use case and detailed description
The main use case for TNA is to provide access to the IMS network for legacy
or IMS enabled equipment when connected via a CS access domain as defined for
ICS (see TS 23.292 [50]).
TNA relies on the following assumptions:
\- The trusted node can be in either the home or visited network
\- The trusted node provides sufficient means for authentication in the CS
access domain
\- The trusted node provides interworking between the IMS domain and the CS
access domain
The authentication flow is depicted below in Figure U.1.
Figure U.1 Trusted Node performs registraton on behalf of the UE
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
**1\. CS attach (UE A to Trusted Node)**
As a result of some stimulus, UE A performs CS attachment toward the CS
network
**2\. Authentication and Update Location (MSC/VLR to HLR/HSS)**
The CS network performs standard CS location update, authentication and
obtains subscriber data.
**3\. CS attach accept (MSC to UE A)**
The CS attach request is accepted by the network, an accept message is sent to
the UE.
**4\. REGISTER request (Trusted Node to I-CSCF)**
The Trusted Node sends a SIP REGISTER to the I-CSCF with a private and
temporary public user identity derived from the subscriber's IMSI as well as
an Instance ID. The REGISTER also contains information indicating the
capabilities and characteristics of the Trusted Node as a SIP User Agent
Client. The Trusted Node inserts an \"integrity-protected\" flag set to
indicate that authentication has already been performed. The I-CSCF verifies
that the incoming REGISTER originates from a trusted node (according to TS
33.210 [5]).
**5\. Cx: User registration status query procedure**
The I-CSCF makes a request for information related to the Subscriber
registration status by sending the private user identity, public user identity
and visited domain name to the HSS as specified in see TS 29.228 [39]. The HSS
returns the S-CSCF required capabilities and the I-CSCF uses this information
to select a suitable S-CSCF.
**6\. REGISTER request (I-CSCF to S-CSCF)**
I-CSCF forwards the REGISTER request to the selected S-CSCF.
**7\. Cx: S-CSCF Registration Notification**
Based on the presence of the \"integrity-protected\" flag set to indicate that
authentication has already been performed, the S-CSCF knows that the
subscriber has already been authenticated by the Trusted Node. The S-CSCF
informs the HSS that the user has been registered. Upon being requested by the
S-CSCF, the HSS will also include the user profile in the response sent to the
S-CSCF. For detailed message flows see TS 29.228 [39].
**8\. 200 (OK) response (S-CSCF to I-CSCF)**
The S-CSCF sends a 200 (OK) response to the I-CSCF indicating that
Registration was successful.
**9\. 200 (OK) response (I-CSCF to Trusted Node)**
The I-CSCF forwards the 200 (OK) response to the MSC Server enhanced for ICS
indicating that Registration was successful.
###### ## Annex V (informative): NAT deployment considerations for GIBA
In the current IMS architecture, it is assumed that no NAT is present between
the GGSN and the P-CSCF in GIBA (or that it is kept transparent to the UE). If
a NAT device is between the GGSN and P-CSCF, problems may arise if it is not
deployed properly. Although there is no IP address theft, when signaling
messages traverse the NAT device, the source IP address may be translated.
When P-CSCF compares the source IP address in the IP header with the one in
the SIP header, it will find that these two IP address are not equal, and will
attach the source IP address in the IP header to the "received" parameter of
the Via header in the SIP header. When the request message is forwarded to the
S-CSCF, the S-CSCF shall compare the IP address in the "received" parameter
with the one stored in HSS. These two IP addresses may not be equal, and the
registration will fail. This implies that GIBA will not be able to distinguish
between address translation caused by NAT and IP address theft.
There are two deployment options that can be used to mitigate this problem.
A) If a NAT is deployed between GGSN and P-CSCF, it shall be controlled by the
Operators and kept transparent to the UE. The P-CSCF can retrieve the address
mapping information from the NAT device, and add the correct address
information in the SIP message. The precise way of getting the address mapping
information from the NAT is outside the scope of this specification.
NOTE 1: A common practice among NAT devices is to implement such address
mapping information query interface based on a standardized protocol like
SNMP.
B) A second alternative to solve the NAT problem is to ensure that the NAT
function is provided in the P-CSCF (see also TS 23.228 [3]). The P-CSCF may
have two interfaces. The internal interface has a private IP address and
communicates with the private address space where the UE resides. The external
interface has a public IP address and communicates with the public address
space where the IMS core devices reside. This will then also ensure that the
correct IP address is provided in the SIP message towards the S-CSCF.
NOTE 2: In practical deployment, a P-CSCF may have more than one internal
interface to extend the capability to hold multiple private networks.
NOTE 3: The two solutions here only define the NAT traversal of the GPRS-IMS
bundled authentication signaling. Media flow NAT traversal in above cases can
be correspondingly solved using the mechanism defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 Annex
G [3].
###### ## Annex W (normative): Tunnelling of IMS Services over Restrictive
Access Networks
# W.1 Overview
This Annex specifies two mechanisms for tunnelling of IMS Services over
Restrictive Access Networks.
The mechanisms specified in this Annex shall only be applicable when the IP
traffic to the IMS core does not traverse through the Evolved Packet Core
(EPC).
The mechanisms in this Annex are optional to implement.
# W.2 Service and Media Reachability for Users over Restrictive Firewalls --
Tunneled Firewall Traversal for IMS traffic
## W.2.0 General
This clause specifies firewall traversal mechanism that can be used for UE
access to IMS services. Before using the mechanisms specified in this clause,
the UE shall in accordance with normal procedures attempt to use existing
NAT/FW traversal mechanisms as specified in TS 23.228 [3] and Annex M of this
document. The exact procedure depends on the UE, the access, and operator
policy.
This mechanism is called Enhanced Firewall Traversal Function (EFTF).
Editor's Note: The functions required for this mechanism need to be detailed
further, while re-using functions from the mechanism defined in Annex X.2 of
33.402 as much as possible when applicable. The Enhanced Firewall Traversal
Function (EFTF) is not required to implement any ePDG functionality not
required for IMS firewall traversal (e.g. authentication, ESP, APN handling,
mobility protocols like PMIP). For IMS firewall traversal the S2b, Gxb and SWm
reference points from 23.402 is not required.
Figure W.1: Protocol stack for IMS firewall traversal
Editor's note: more textual description of EFTF in line with Figure W.1 is
needed to arrive at a complete stage 2 description of the EFTF mechanism.
**Legend:**
\- As a part of Tunnel Creation, allocation of IP address and negotiation of
Keep Alive interval is required.
NOTE: The details of how the IP address is allocated and the keep-alive
interval is negotiated are in the corresponding stage 3 specification.
## W.2.1 Firewall detection procedure
Based on the detection procedure as specified in the following flowchart, it
is determined whether it is required to create a TCP/TLS based tunnel to
enable the traversal of NIMSFW.
If so, then the TLS profile as defined in TS 33.310 [24] shall be used.
Figure W.2: Flowchart for IMS firewall traversal
Once the TCP/TLS connection is established, the tunnel creation procedure
involves negotiating IP address and keep-alive intervals.
# W.3 Service and Media Reachability for Users over Restrictive Firewalls --
Extensions to STUN/TURN/ICE
Editor's note: Details on the extensions (HTTP CONNECT and detection mechanism
for determining firewall types and explicit mention of supporting TCP port
443) to STUN/TURN/ICE is ffs.
## W.3.1 Introduction
### W.3.1.1 General
This clause specifies a firewall traversal solution for IMS control and media
traffic based on SIP over TLS and an extended version of the ICE protocol
[ICE, ICE-TCP]. In this solution, the TLS profile as defined in TS 33.310 [24]
shall be used.
The method is intended for IMS clients that are located behind IMS-unaware
firewalls and which fail to perform IMS registration and/or session
establishment using the normal procedures. The method is likely to succeed as
long as the firewall permits HTTP(S) traffic and does not perform extensive
traffic monitoring. The method consists of two sub-solutions, one for the IMS
media plane and one for the IMS control plane.
Note that this solution is only applicable to UEs which already support the
use of ICE as defined in Annex G of TS 23.228 [3].
### W.3.1.2 Firewall traversal for IMS control plane using SIP over TLS/TCP
Firewall traversal for IMS control plane is accomplished by running SIP over
TLS and using port 443 (HTTPS) instead of the standard port 5061 (SIPS). This
makes the SIP signalling appear as HTTPS traffic to any firewall that is
present along the signalling path.
In order to ensure that the firewall pinholes are maintained, the IMS client
-shall apply the keep-alive mechanism specified in RFC 5626 [32]. The keep-
alive mechanism is negotiated by the IMS client and the P-CSCF at IMS
registration using the method described in RFC 6223 [64]. Note that RFC 5626
defines two keep-alive techniques: a technique based on STUN for connection-
less transports and a technique based on SIP (called CRLF) for connection-
oriented transports. Since TCP is used as transport between the IMS client and
the P-CSCF, the CRLF keep-alive technique must be used.
In case the IMS client is configured to use an HTTP proxy, the IMS client uses
the HTTP CONNECT method (see RFC 2817 [63]) to request the proxy to establish
a TCP connection with the P-CSCF on its behalf. Once the client has received a
positive reply from the proxy that the TCP connection has been established,
the client initates the TLS handshake with the P-CSCF and establishes the TLS
tunnel. Note that the use of the HTTP CONNECT method is completely transparent
to P-CSCF.
Editor's note: It needs to be verified that this does not interfere with the
HTTP proxy settings on the UE.
### W.3.1.3 Firewall traversal for IMS media plane using ICE and TURN
Firewall traversal for IMS media plane is accomplished by using the ICE
protocol together with an enhanced version of TURN. ICE is defined in RFC 8445
[79] and RFC 8839 [80], and it is a protocol for performing NAT traversal of
UDP based media streams. ICE in turn makes use of TURN, defined in RFC 5766
[60], which is a protocol for relaying media through a relay server. An IMS
client that supports ICE will allocate relayed candidates at the TURN server
and include the candidate information in the SDP offer/answer sent to the
peer. The relayed candidates will be used as a last resort when the client and
peer fail to establish a direct communication path. The communication between
the client and the TURN server (this includes both the relayed media and the
control information needed to setup the relayed candidates) can occur over
UDP, TCP or TCP/TLS. By using TCP/TLS on port 443 (HTTPS) or TCP on port 80
(HTTP) the communication will appear as HTTP(S) to firewalls and will
(typically) be allowed through. Using TCP instead of TLS/TCP reduces the
overhead but will fail when the firewall performs DPI or if an HTTP proxy is
present. An IMS client may be configured to use both TURN over TCP/80 and TURN
over TLS/443, in such case, the client should prefer to use TURN over TCP/80
to avoid TLS overhead.
ICE and TURN have later on been extended to also support TCP based media. ICE
TCP is defined in RFC 8445 [79] and RFC 8839 [80] and TURN TCP is defined in
RFC 8656 [78]. One of the changes introduced in TURN TCP is that the multiple
TCP connections are established between the client and TURN server: one for
exchange of control information and one for each relayed TCP based media
stream. All UDP based media streams are relayed over the same TCP connection
that is used for the control information, just as in the original TURN
protocol. The TURN server will use TCP/TLS on port 443 (HTTPS) or TCP over
port 80 (HTTP) for all the connections. In order to reduce the TLS setup time
when several TCP connections are established, the IMS client and TURN server
may use the TLS session resumption feature.
An IMS client that is configured to use an HTTP proxy uses the HTTP CONNECT
method (see RFC 2817 [63]) to request the proxy to establish a TCP connection
with the TURN server. Once the client has received a positive reply from the
proxy that the TCP connection has been established, the client initates the
TLS handshake with the TURN server and establishes the TLS tunnel. This
procedure is repeated once for every TCP connection the client establishes
with the TURN server. Note that the use of the HTTP CONNECT method is
completely transparent to TURN server.
Using ICE for firewall traversal is particularly suitable for IMS clients that
already implement ICE for NAT traversal, since in this case only minimal
changes are required to the client. Usage of ICE for IMS clients is specified
in TS 23.228 [3] and TS 24.229 [8].
Note that there is no need to specify any keep-alive mechanism since this
functionality is already included in ICE. The IMS client will send regular
STUN keep-alives which ensures that the firewall pinholes are maintained.
Editor\'s note: ICE TCP is required for TCP based media (e.g. MSRP) but is not
yet supported in TS 23.228 [3] and TS 24.229 [8]. These specifications need to
be updated.
Editor\'s note: How the client is authenticated and authorized by the TURN
server is ffs. One possibility is to use the SIP Digest credentials and the
normal TURN authentication procedure. However, this would require an
additional interface between the TURN server and the HSS. Another possibility
is to use GBA but this would perhaps be unnecessarily complex considering that
the only attack we need to protect against is DoS.
## W.3.2 Reference model
Figure W.1 presents the reference model for IMS access when the IMS client
uses the firewall traversal mechanism outlined in this section.
In case the remote endpoint does not support ICE, the P-CSCF may instruct the
IMS-ALG to insert the IMS Access Gateway in the media path and terminate ICE.
The procedure is described in TS 24.229 [8] and continues to function in the
same way, i.e. the IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW are not impacted by the firewall
traversal solution.
Note that the media may take several routes depending on which ICE candidates
that succeed first. Media will only be relayed through the TURN server if all
ICE candidates with higher priority fail.
Also note that the STUN server is included in Figure W.1 for sake of
completeness. There is no impact on this function.
Figure W.1: Reference model for IMS access when firewall traversal is
performed using SIP over TCP/TLS and ICE
## W.3.3 Required functions of the UE
For firewall traversal of IMS control plane, the IMS client shall implement
the following functionality:
\- support SIP over TLS/TCP on the non-standard port 443 (HTTPS);
\- support the SIP Digest authentication method according to Annex N;
\- support the CRLF keep-alive technique defined in RFC 5626 [32] together
with the negotiation mechanism defined in RFC 6223 [64];
\- support the HTTP CONNECT method in RFC 2817 [63] for establishing the TLS
tunnel with the P-CSCF when the IMS client is configured with an HTTP proxy.
For firewall traversal of IMS media plane, the IMS client shall implement the
following functionality:
\- support ICE for UDP and TCP based media streams according to Annex G of TS
23.228 [3];
\- support TLS/TCP on non-standard port 443 and TCP on non-standard port 80
for communication with TURN server;
\- support the HTTP CONNECT method in RFC 2817 [63] for establishing TLS
tunnels with the TURN server when the IMS client is configured with an HTTP
proxy.
Note that the HTTP CONNECT method is only used when the IMS client is
configured with an HTTP proxy for outgoing HTTP(S) requests. The way in which
the IMS client obtains the proxy address and port is out of scope.
## W.3.4 Required functions of the P-CSCF
For firewall traversal of IMS control plane, the P-CSCF shall implement the
following functionality:
\- support SIP over TLS/TCP on the non-standard port 443 (HTTPS);
\- support the SIP Digest authentication method according to Annex N;
\- support the CRLF keep-alive technique defined in RFC 5626 [32] together
with the negotiation mechanism defined in RFC 6223 [64].
## W.3.5 Required functions of the TURN server
The TURN server shall, in addition to the requirements specified in Annex G of
TS 23.228 [3], implement the following functionality:
\- Support TLS/TCP on non-standard port 443 and (optionally) TCP on non-
standard port 80 for communication with IMS client
## W.3.6 Required functions of the IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW
The requirements for the IMS-ALG and IMS-AGW specified in TS 24.228 [11] apply
without changes.
NOTE: The IMS-ALG is invoked by the P-CSCF, IBCF, or ISC to handle the case
when the remote endpoint lacks support of ICE. The IMS-ALG in turn inserts the
IMS-AGW on the media path.
Editor's note: IMS-AGW may be inserted in other cases as well, e.g. for hosted
NAT.
###### ## Annex X (Normative): Security for WebRTC IMS Client access to IMS
# X.1 Introduction
This annex specifies the security required for the signalling procedures
described in TS 23.228 [3] for WebRTC IMS Client access to IMS.
The provisions in the present annex are optional for implementation. The
provisions in the present annex are optional for use.
For this release of the present specification, only the descriptions relating
to the reference points in the IMS core, i.e. the interfaces between eP-CSCF,
I-CSCF, S-CSCF, and HSS are normative. The descriptions of the reference
points between WIC, WWSF, and eP-CSCF are of informative nature only. The
latter are therefore to be considered as examples only, and implementations
may be compliant with this specification and yet realise the reference points
between WIC, WWSF, and eP-CSCF in a way different from the one described in
the present annex.
The present annex is structured according to the three registration scenarios
for WebRTC IMS Clients described in TS 23.228 [3].
This annex also describes solutions for TURN credential provisioning and
authentication of WebRTC IMS clients when ICE/TURN is used as a mechanism to
provide solution for traversing symmetric NAT and restrictive firewalls.
# X.2 Authentication of WebRTC IMS Client with IMS subscription re-using
existing IMS authentication mechanisms
## X.2.0 General
The present clause X.2 deals with the security aspects of the registration
scenario described in TS 23.228 [3] that is entitled \"WIC registration of
individual Public User Identity using IMS authentication\".
## X.2.1 General requirements
The following security requirements apply to all solutions for the present
registration scenario:
\- REQ 1.0: For the reference interface W1 (WIC to WWSF), one way
authentication (WIC needs to authenticate WWSF) is needed. For the interface
W2 (WIC to eP-CSCF), mutual authentication is required.
\- REQ 1.1: The eP-CSCF shall verify that the WIC establishing the signalling
connection with the eP-CSCF comes from a trusted domain.
When the WIC has access to the USIM/ISIM in the UE, IMS AKA scheme shall be
used for authenticating WebRTC IMS Client, as defined in section X.2.3 of this
document.
## X.2.2 Solution 1.1: Use of SIP Digest credentials
### X.2.2.1 General
In solution 1.1 it is assumed that the user has a subscription with an
individual IMPU. The WebRTC IMS Client (WIC) is provided with the user\'s SIP
Digest credentials and uses SIP Digest to register with IMS. The eP-CSCF is
assumed to relay the authentication information so that the message flows are
unchanged. The use of SIP Digest in IMS is specified in Annex N of this
document.
NOTE: The use of SIP Digest breaks the security requirement mandating IMS AKA
to connect to IMS when using a 3GPP access network. See Annex N of this
document.
It is recommended to maintain a clear separation between WICs and regular IMS
UEs. A user accessing IMS from a WIC should be assigned a separate
subscription in the HSS with a unique IMPI and SIP Digest password. In this
way a compromised password will have an isolated impact and only affect the
WIC.
The entities that have access to the IMPI and SIP Digest password, and thus
needs to be trusted by the operator, are the user, the browser, the WWSF, and
the IMS core network. (The WWSF is included here since it has the ability to
inject rogue JavaScript code into the WIC). SIP Digest should therefore only
be used when the WWSF is controlled by the operator or a 3rd party trusted by
the operator.
### X.2.2.2 Requirements
No requirements have been identified.
### X.2.2.3 Procedures
Figure X.2.3-1 shows the registration flow. In this figure SIP over secure
WebSocket is used between the WIC and the eP-CSCF. Other protocols (e.g. HTTP
RESTful or JSON over WebSocket) can also be used as long as it is able to
relay the digest challenge, challenge-response, and auth-info values.
Solution 1.1 requires that the IMPU and SIP Digest password are made available
to the JavaScript in the WIC. The IMPI can be omitted from the initial SIP
Register request, and if that is the case the S-CSCF will try to determine its
value from the registering IMPU. This requires that IMPUs are not shared
between IMS users (see Annex N).
NOTE 1: It is assumed that the credentials are entered by the user via the web
GUI or retrieved from the WWSF over HTTPS. Note that the latter option
requires that WWSF has authenticated the user previously.
NOTE 2: Unless the SIP Digest password or the intermediate hash value H(A1)
(see RFC 7235 [83] and RFC 7616 [76]) is stored in the WIC, the password needs
to be re-obtained each time a re-registration is performed. If the password is
entered manually and if re-registrations occur often, this will result in a
negative user experience. This can be avoided by storing the SIP Digest
password or H(A1) in the WIC after the initial registration procedure.
Ensuring the confidentiality of the SIP Digest password or H(A1) during
storage is at the discretion of the implementation and is outside the scope of
3GPP. The use of MD5 in HTTP Digest is not recommended and only supported for
interoperability.
NOTE 3: It is recommended that the user does not enter his SIP Digest
credentials into the WIC, except possibly once before the initial
registration.
Figure X.2.2.3-1: WebRTC IMS Client authentication using SIP Digest
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1) **Web page download from WWSF**
> From within a WebRTC-enabled browser, the user accesses a URI to the WWSF to
> initiate an HTTPS connection to the WWSF. The TLS connection provides one-
> way authentication of the server based on the server certificate. The
> browser downloads and initializes the WIC from the WWSF.
**2) Establishment of secure Web socket connection between WIC and eP-CSCF**
> The WIC opens a WSS (secure Web Socket) connection to the eP-CSCF. The TLS
> connection provides one-way authentication of the server based on the server
> certificate. The eP-CSCF verifies in this step that the WIC establishing the
> signalling connection comes from a trusted domain.
NOTE 3: The protection mechanism works under the assumption that the browser
is not under the attacker\'s control.
**3-10) SIP Digest message flow**
> The SIP Digest messages exchanged between the WIC and eP-CSCF and between
> the eP-CSCF and the I/S-CSCF are as defined in Annex N of this document.
## X.2.3 Solution 1.2: Use of IMS AKA
### X.2.3.1 General
When the WIC has access to the USIM/ISIM in the UE, IMS AKA scheme is used for
authenticating WebRTC IMS Client, as described figure X.2.3.3-1.
The IMS AKA procedure is performed as specified in section 6.1 with the usage
of HTTP Digest AKAv2 as defined in RFC 4169 [65] (instead of HTTP Digest AKA
defined in RFC 3310 [17]) and without security association set-up. The
protection of IMS signalling between the WIC and the eP-CSCF is provided by
the secure WebSocket connection.
The ME shall be able to apply access control policy to the WIC before granting
the access to the UICC application in charge of the IMS AKA authentication for
WebRTC.
NOTE: Precision on how the ME could apply access control policy to restrict
access to UICC is at the discretion of the ME implementation and is left out
of scope of the present 3GPP release.
It is optional to have in the UICC an ISIM application that would be dedicated
to WebRTC usage in order to maintain a clear separation between WebRTC Client
and regular IMS UEs. This ISIM application dedicated to WebRTC could have
separate subscription in the HSS (with unique IMPI and key K). In this way an
attack will have an isolated impact and only affect the WebRTC IMS Client.
### X.2.3.2 Requirements
No requirements have been identified.
### X.2.3.3 Procedures
Figure X.2.3.3-1 shows the registration flow:
{width="5.300694444444445in" height="4.288888888888889in"}
Figure X.2.3.3-1: WebRTC client authentication using IMS AKA
  * **Web page download from WWSF**
From within a WebRTC-enabled browser, the user accesses a URI to the WWSF to
initiate an HTTPS connection to the WWSF. The TLS connection provides one-way
authentication of the server based on the server certificate. The browser
downloads and initializes the WIC from the WWSF.
  * **Establishment of secure Web socket connection between WIC and eP-CSCF**
The WIC opens a WSS (secure Web Socket) connection to the eP-CSCF. The TLS
connection provides one-way authentication of the server based on the server
certificate.The eP-CSCF verifies in this step that the WIC establishing the
signalling connection comes from a trusted domain.
NOTE 1: The protection mechanism works under the assumption that the browser
is not under the attacker\'s control.
\- **IMS AKA Procedure** (from Step 1 to Step 8)
The IMS AKA procedure is performed as specified in section 6.1 with
differences as explained below.
HTTP Digest AKAv2 is used as defined in RFC 4169 [65] (instead of HTTP Digest
AKA defined in RFC 3310 [17]) and no IPsec security association is set-up. The
keys CK and IK shall not be forwarded by the S-CSCF to thee P-CSCF in SM4.
Hence, any statements relating to the use of these keys in the eP-CSCF do not
apply.
The WebRTC IMS Client forwards necessary IMS AKA information to the UICC
application in charge of the IMS AKA authentication for WebRTC.
The ME applies access control policy to the WIC before granting the access to
the UICC application in charge of the IMS AKA authentication for WebRTC.
This UICC application sends back the results of the AUTHENTICATE command
executed to perform the IMS AKA authentication, as defined in section 8 of
this document. After successful execution of the AUTHENTICATE command, the ME
securely derives the HTTP Digest password as described in RFC 4169 [65] using
algorithm name equal to \"AKAv2-SHA-256\" and associated pseudo-random
function (PRF) as defined in RFC 4169 [65] The algorithm value equals to
SHA-256 in RFC 3310[17]. The WebRTC IMS Client uses this HTTP Digest password
to provide the authentication response in the SIP Register message. The WIC
shall not have access to the keys CK and IK.
NOTE: The messages SM2, SM8, SM9 and SM11 mentioned in the following are
defined in clause 6 of this specification.
The eP-CSCF shall forward the REGISTER request to the S-CSCF including the
\"integrity-protected\" header field parameter with the value set to \"tls-
connected\" in message SM2 if the REGISTER request was received over the TLS
connection between the WIC and the eP-CSCF. The eP-CSCF sends message SM8 with
a TLS integrity protection indicator indicating the logical value
\"authentication pending\". When the eP-CSCF receives message SM11 (200 OK),
it shall associate the UE's IP address and port of the TLS connection with the
TLS session ID, the IMPI and all the successfully registered IMPUs related to
that IMPI. From this point onwards for WebRTC session, the eP-CSCF shall not
accept any SIP signalling messages outside the TLS connection other than
messages relating to emergency services in accordance to TS 24.229 [8] and TS
23.167 [31].
In the REGISTER message received by the S-CSCF, if the value of the
\"integrity-protected\" flag is set to \"tls-connected\" and \"algorithm\"
parameter in the Authorization header has the value \"AKAv2-SHA-256\", the
S-CSCF concludes that the REGISTER request relates to IMS AKA with HTTP Digest
AKAv2 over TLS session set-up prior to registration.
The S-CSCF shall derive the HTTP Digest password as described in RFC 4169 [65]
using algorithm name equal to \"AKAv2-SHA-256\" and associated pseudo-random
function (PRF) After message SM9, if the authentication of the UE is
successful, the S-CSCF shall associate the registration with the local state
\"tls-protected\". An S-CSCF shall accept a REGISTER message with a TLS
integrity protection indicator indicating \"authentication pending\" only if
it contains a verifiable Digest value computed over a valid challenge
according to RFC 4169 [65].
.
# X.3 Authentication of WebRTC IMS Client with IMS subscription using web
credentials
## X.3.0 General
The present clause X.3 deals with the security aspects of the registration
scenario described in TS 23.228 [3] that is entitled \"WIC registration of
individual Public User Identity based on web authentication\".
## X.3.1 General requirements
The following security requirements apply to the present registration
scenario:
\- REQ 2.0: For the interface W1 (WIC to WWSF) mutual authentication is
required, unless the user\'s web identity is authenticated by the WAF, in
which case only one-way authentication is required. For the interfaces W2 (WIC
to eP-CSCF), and W4, if present, (WWSF to WAF), mutual authentication is
required.
\- REQ 2.1: An IMS service provider shall ensure that a third party
authenticating a WebRTC IMS Client (WIC) and authorizing it to register with
an IMS network using certain IMS identities has been granted the right to do
so by the IMS subscriber owning these IMS identities. In case of a potential
security breach affecting that third party, IMS subscribers that did not grant
any right to that third party shall not be affected.
\- REQ 2.2: An IMS service provider should be able to identify and mitigate
security anomalies or security breaches at one third party entity
authenticating or authorizing WebRTC IMS Clients , without affecting clients
associated with other such third party entities.
\- REQ 2.3: To prevent a third party from providing authorization information
to a WebRTC IMS Client (WIC) without having been authorized by the IMS service
provider to do so, an IMS service provider shall be able to identify the
granting third party each time the IMS subscriber registers with the IMS
network through the W2 interface. The identity of the third party shall be
determined from the authorization information securely received by the IMS
network over W2.
\- REQ 2.4: An IMS service provider relying on a third party for
authenticating or authorizing WebRTC IMS Clients (WIC), shall securely
determine from the received authorization information the IMPI and IMPU of the
authenticated WIC attempting to register with the IMS network.
NOTE: In a use-case where IMPI is associated with multiple IMPUs, IMPI to IMPU
association check when\ I-CSCF User Registration Query is processed by the
HSS, is not enough. For example, a user who has authenticated to the WWSF as
sip:bob-impu1\@operator.com but changes \"To\" field in the W2 REGISTER
message to sip:bob-impu2\@operator.com, will not be detected by the IMS
network. It is therefore necessary to determine IMPU and IMPI of the
authenticated user from the received authorization information.
\- REQ 2.5: It shall be ensured that a third party authenticating and
authorizing a WebRTC IMS Clienthas enough information to guarantee that the
user is entitled to use the IMS private identity IMPI determined from the
user\'s web identity authenticated by the third party.
\- REQ 2.6: The eP-CSCF shall verify that the WIC establishing the signalling
connection with the eP-CSCF comes from a trusted domain.
## X.3.2 Solution 2.1
### X.3.2.1 General
In the present registration scenario it is assumed that the user has a
subscription with an individual IMPU, but uses a web identity and
authentication scheme to authenticate with the WWSF or the WAF. (Whether it is
the WWSF or the WAF depends on the deployment).
### X.3.2.2 Requirements
All requirements for solution 2.1 are covered in clause X.3.1.
### X.3.2.3 Procedures
The procedure provided in this clause is split into a normative part and non-
normative part: the description for the interfaces between eP-CSCF, I-/S-CSCF
and HSS is normative while the description for the interfaces W1, W2 and W4 is
only by way of example.
NOTE 1: This split into a normative part and a non-normative part is due to
3GPP's decision not to standardise the interfaces W1, W2 and W4 in the present
release.
For the non-normative part, the procedure allows for various realisations that
are out of scope of 3GPP for the present release. All realisations have in
common that the WAF issues authorization tokens that are provided to the WIC
via the WWSF. The WIC presents this authorization token to the eP-CSCF during
the IMS registration. The validation of the authorization token by the eP-CSCF
is specific to the particular realisation. The authorization token allows the
eP-CSCF to retrieve the IMS subscriber identity, the WAF and WWSF identities,
validity period, and possible other authorization parameters.
The procedure in the present clause covers two cases of locating the
authorization entity (WAF):
\- The WAF is located in the IMS provider domain;
\- The WAF is located in a third party domain.
NOTE 2: WWSF and WAF realisations can be physically co-located or physically
separate; in the latter case, WWSF and WAF can reside in the same or in
different domains.
An example signalling flow for the present registration scenario is shown in
Figure X.3.2.3-1. In this figure, by way of example SIP over secure WebSocket
is used between the WebRTC IMS Client and the eP-CSCF. Other protocols (e.g.
HTTP RESTful or JSON over WebSocket) can also be used.
All steps in the procedure below apply to both cases of WAF location unless
stated otherwise. For the example of OAuth 2.0 the WAF needs to be located in
the IMS provider domain.
For the normative part, the procedure applies Trusted Node Authentication
(TNA) specified for IMS in Annex U of the present specification. The trusted
node is the eP-CSCF residing in the operator network, according to TS 23.228
[3]. The signalling between the Trusted Node and the rest of the IMS core is
unchanged from the signalling flow in Annex U of the present specification
with the following exception: if the WAF is located in a third party domain
then the REGISTER message is enhanced with additional parameters (WAF and WWSF
identity, if available), which are included to satisfy the requirements REQ
2.1 and REQ 2.2 from clause X.3.1 of the present specification.
Figure X.3.2.3-1: WebRTC IMS Client access to IMS using Trusted Node
Authentication (example flow)
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
Each step x in the signalling flow has a part x.1 providing general text
applying to all realisations, irrespective of whether the WAF is located in
the IMS provider domain or in a third party domain. This part x.1 is followed
by text explaining how it would work for a realisation using the example of
OAuth. For the example of OAuth, the WAF needs to be located in the IMS
provider domain.
In addition, some of the steps contain a second step x.2 that applies only
when the WAF is located in a third party domain.
**0\. WWSF obtains authorization token**
> _0.1 General_ :
The WWSF requests an authorization token from the WAF. The WAF or WWSF,
depending on the authorization flow used, authenticates the user via "web
credentials", i.e. credentials as commonly used for access to web based
services, for example a username and password. The user\'s web identity is
mapped to the corresponding IMS subscriber identity (i.e. IMPI and IMPU(s) ).
NOTE 3: It is assumed that the WWSF or WAF maintains the mapping between a
user\'s web identity and IMPI/IMPU. How this mapping is established (i.e. how
REQ 2.5 is satisfied) is out-of-scope of this specification.
> _Example of OAuth 2.0_ :
>
> When using the example of OAuth 2.0 then one of the authorization flows
> defined by OAuth 2.0 is used.
\- Authorization Code flow: The WAF authenticates both the user and the WWSF
before it issues the access token. The WAF may also request the user to
explicitly authorize the WWSF.
\- Client Credentials flow: The WAF authenticates only the WWSF and the
authorization is performed without user involvement. As part of the
authorization, the WAF verifies that the WWSF has the necessary permissions to
access the IMS account indicated in the request. It is assumed that the WWSF
has authenticated the user prior to sending the token request.

NOTE 6a: In the present 3GPP release the token format and verification
procedure is left out of scope.\ It is assumed that the eP-CSCF can check the
validity of the token and obtain the subscriber IMPI and IMPU(s), the WWSF
identity, lifetime, and scope parameters.

# X.4 Assignment of IMS identities to WebRTC IMS Client from pool of IMS
subscriptions held by WWSF
## X.4.0 General
The present clause X.4 deals with the security aspects of the registration
scenario described in TS 23.228 [3] that is entitled \"WIC registration of
individual Public User Identity from a pool of Public User Identities\".
## X.4.1 General requirements
The following security requirements apply to the present registration
scenario:
\- REQ 3.0: For the interfaces W2 (WIC to eP-CSCF), and W4, if present, (WWSF
to WAF), mutual authentication is required. For the W1interface, mutual
authentication is required, except for the case of anonymous user. In the case
of anonymous user, one way authentication (WIC needs to authenticate WWSF) is
required.
\- REQ 3.1: The WAF shall provide authorization information to the eP-CSCF
(possibly via the WIC) that allows the IMS core to ascertain that the WIC in
possession of this authorization information is authorized to access IMS using
the associated public and private IMS identities presented during registration
or retrieved from the WAF through undefined means.
\- REQ 3.2: An IMS service provider shall ensure that the private IMS identity
provided in the authorization information from REQ 3.2 belongs to an IMS
subscription in the pool of IMS subscriptions uniquely assigned to the WWSF.
\- REQ 3.3: The eP-CSCF shall verify that the WIC establishing the signalling
connection with the eP-CSCF comes from a trusted domain.
## X.4.2 Solution 3.1
### X.4.2.1 General
In the present registration scenario it is assumed that the "WWSF is provided
with a pool of subscriptions, each containing a single unique IMPU/IMPI pair,
to IMS and can assign individual Public and Private User Identities from this
pool." (quoted from TS 23.228). This assignment is temporary and the same IMPU
(and IMPI) may be re-assigned to a different user at a later time once they
are free and available for reâ€‘use.
In an extension to this registration scenario, the IMS operator may also
provide the WWSF with an unbounded number of IMPUs associated with IMPIs to be
allocated to WIC users.
The user's web identity may be authenticated by the WWSF or the WAF. (Whether
it is the WWSF or the WAF depends on the deployment.), but the WWSF may decide
not to authenticate the user. Unauthenticated users are anonymous to the WWSF
and WAF, but may still be authorized for IMS service.
NOTE 1: The difference to the registration scenario addressed in clause X.3 is
that, in the present registration scenario, the IMS subscriber is the WWSF,
not the user. There is no linkage between the user's web identity that may be
authenticated by the WWSF or the WAF and the assigned IMS identities.
NOTE 2: Considerations on Lawful Interception, e.g. when the user is anonymous
to the third party, are outside the scope of the present document.
### X.4.2.2 Requirements
All requirements for solution 3.1 are covered in clause X.4.1.
### X.4.2.3 Procedures
The procedure provided in this clause is split into a normative part and non-
normative part: the description for the interfaces between eP-CSCF, I-/S-CSCF
and HSS is normative while the description for the interfaces W1, W2 and W4 is
only by way of example.
NOTE 3: This split into a normative part and a non-normative part is due to
3GPP's decision not to standardise the interfaces W1, W2 and W4 in the present
release.
For the non-normative part, the procedure allows for various realisations that
are out of scope of 3GPP for the present release. All realisations have in
common that the WAF issues authorization tokens that are provided to the WIC
via the WWSF. The WIC presents this authorization token to the eP-CSCF during
the IMS registration. The validation of the authorization token by the eP-CSCF
is specific to the particular realisation. The authorization token allows the
eP-CSCF to retrieve the IMS subscriber identity, the WAF and WWSF identities,
validity period, and possible other authorization parameters.
The procedure in the present clause covers two cases of locating the
authorization entity (WAF):
\- The WAF is located in the IMS provider domain;
\- The WAF is located in a third party domain.
NOTE 4: WWSF and WAF realisations can be physically co-located or physically
separate; in the latter case, WWSF and WAF can reside in the same or in
different domains.
An example signalling flow for the present registration scenario is shown in
Figure X.3.3-1. In this figure, by way of example SIP over secure WebSocket is
used between the WebRTC IMS Client and the eP-CSCF. Other protocols (e.g. HTTP
RESTful or JSON over WebSocket) can also be used.
All steps in the procedure below apply to both cases of WAF location unless
stated otherwise. For the example of OAuth 2.0 the WAF needs to be located in
the IMS provider domain.
For the normative part, the procedure applies Trusted Node Authentication
(TNA) specified for IMS in Annex U of the present specification. The trusted
node is the eP-CSCF residing in the operator network, according to the present
specification .
The signalling between the trusted node and the rest of the IMS core is
unchanged from the signalling flow in Annex U of the present specification
with the following exception: if the WAF is located in a third party domain
then the REGISTER message may be enhanced with additional parameters (WAF and
WWSF identity, if available), whose inclusion is conditional, to satisfy the
requirements REQ 3.2 from clause X.4.1 of the present specification.

# X.5 TURN credential provisioning and authentication (informative)
## X.5.1 Introduction
TURN RFC 8656 [78] specifies that TURN servers and clients MUST implement
\"Long-Term Credential Mechanism\" as specified in clause 10.2 of RFC 8489
[77]. In this mechanism, the client and server share a pre-provisioned
username and password that remains in the system till the user is using the
system.The TURN server uses these credentials to authenticate the client by
performing digest challenge/response.
In IMS_WebRTC, the browser plays the role of a TURN client. The WIC (i.e. the
Javascript code) controls the execution of the browser via the W3C defined
RTCPeerConnection API. Through this API, the WIC provides TURN credentials to
the browser. These credentials should therefore be made available to the WIC.
There are two known gaps that need to be addressed before TURN can be used in
IMS_WebRTC:
1) At present, the provisioning of TURN long-term credentials in the WIC is
un-defined.
2) Moreover, as indicated in RFC 7376 [68], ensuring secrecy of these
credentials in a web-based application such as the WIC is difficult. Once
these credentials are exposed to a Javascript script, it could lead to various
security issues such as leak of the credentials, privacy leakage etc.
A solution is needed to dynamically configure the TURN credentials in the WIC
while ensuring that security gaps identified by RFC 7376 [68] are addressed.
Two solutions are presented in this annex for TURN credential provisioning and
authentication:a) eP-CSCF based dynamic provisioning of credentials in the WIC
and TURN server
b) TURN client authentication based OAuth 2.0 access tokens.
Both solutions are optional for implementation.
## X.5.2 Solution 1: TURN credential provisioning and authentication using eP-
CSCF
### X.5.2.1 Overview
This solution reuses the TURN long-term credential method defined in RFC 8656
[78] , but the credential is dynamically provisioned by eP-CSCF via the
signalling channel. When WIC registers to IMS, WIC requests the IMS networks
to provision a credential for TURN authentication using a 3GPP extension
header. If the request is authenticated and authorized, eP-CSCF generates a
TURN credential, including user id, password, expiration, etc, and sends the
credential to WIC in the response message. Since the signaling messages
between WIC and eP-CSCF are protected by the secure protocols, e.g. secure
Websocket, the TURN credential is securely transferred to WIC. The WIC
retrieves the credential and uses it in subsequent TURN allocation requests.
The WIC may request TURN credential for every registration, or use the
credential until it expires. WIC can also use other signaling messages such as
OPTION to request a new credential at anytime before re-registration.
This method requires some enhancement of WIC and eP-CSCF. WIC needs to be
enhanced to use the 3GPP extension header to request TURN credential from eP-
CSCF via signaling messages. The eP-CSCF needs to be enhanced to process TURN
credential request and generate TURN user name and password using a preshared
key with the TURN server. The TURN server also needs to be enhanced to re-
generate TURN password from username in TURN request and the preshared key
with P-CSCF.
This solution provides a way to provision TURN credential in large scale with
minor change to existing functions. It addresses the security issues in RFC
8489 [76] by dynamically generating TURN user name and password. This solution
is optional to support. When to use this solution depends on WebRTC deployment
scenario and operator's policy. For example, if a deployment does not have
WAF, or if the WAF or TURN server does not support TURN access token, the eP-
CSCF based approach may be used for TURN credential provision and
authentication since the alternative solution requires the use of WAF and
support of TURN access token by TURN server, WAF.
### X.5.2.2 Procedures
The procedure of TURN credential provision via eP-CSCF is shown in figure
X.5.2.2.1. To use this solution, a shared secret key _Km_ should be configured
between eP-CSCF and TURN server using out of band method not defined in this
solution.
1) WIC establishes secure websocket with eP-CSCF
2) WIC sends REGISTER request to eP-CSCF with 3GPP extended header (3gpp-ext-
turn-cred) for TURN credential request.
3) eP-CSCF authenticate and authorized the request then
1) Generate a random user ID _Tid_ and credential expiration time _Texp_ based
on its policy, _Tid_ and _Texp should be encoded as string type._
2) Generate TURN password using _Km_ , _Tpwd_ = HASH (_Km_ , _Tid : Texp_ )
4) eP-CSCF sends REGISTER response with generated TURN credential using the
3gpp extended header. The valud of the header = (_Tid : Texp : Tpwd),_ which
is the concatenation of _Tid, Texp, Tpwd_ separated by semi-colon sign.
5) IC extracts the TURN credential from the TURN credential header. The WIC
uses (_Tid : Texp)_ as TURN USERNAME and uses _Kpwd_ to compute the MESSAGE-
INTEGRITY value of TURN Allocate request as defined in IETF RFC 58656 [78].
6) TURN server re-generates TURN password using the USERNAME attribute in
request and the preshared key with eP-CSCF
7) TURN server validates that the credential has not expired and verifies the
integrity of the TURN request using the password generated in step 6.
8) TURN server sends Allocate response with allocated relay address to WIC
The procedure above uses REGISTER as example to explain how to request TURN
credential from eP-CSCF by signaling messages. WIC may use other signaling
messages, such as OPTIONAL, to request TURN credential.

## X.5.3 Solution 2: TURN credential provisioning and authentication using
OAuth Access token
### X.5.3.1 Overview
IETF RFC 7635[70] proposes a new mechanism for TURN client authentication
authorization mechanism different from the current long-term credential
solution. In this mechanism, third party authorization using OAuth 2.0 is used
by the TURN server to authorize the TURN client instead of the regular
username/password mechanism.
Using OAuth 2.0, the TURN client obtains an ephemeral self-contained access
token and the associated secret session key from the authorization server. The
authorization server acts as a trusted third party that binds the secret
session key to the generated access token. The token is presented to the TURN
server instead of username/password credentials. The server performs two
checks to authorize the TURN client \-- it validates the authenticity of the
received self-contained token, and in addition, also verifies that the TURN
client is in possession of the secret key. It provides required services only
after both the checks succeed. The secret key is used to integrity protect the
connection between TURN client and TURN server.
The salient security features of this solution are the following:
a. Using ephemeral access token and session key with short lifetimes (in secs)
ensure that access to TURN server can be controlled even if one or both of
them are compromised in WIC. The session key has lifetime that corresponds to
the lifetime of the access token.
b. The proof-of-possession security mechanism defined in IETF RFC 7800 [75] is
used by the TURN server to authenticate the TURN client. A secret session key
is bound to the access token by the Authorization server. This key is used to
integrity-protect TURN messages between the TURN client and the server. The
server confirms the authenticity of the TURN client by verifying the message
integrity of the received message against the message integrity populated by
the client.
c. Real usernames are not used in TURN messages. This ensures that there is no
privacy leakage by any snooping adversary.
This solution has impacts on the following IMS WebRTC functional entities:
\- WAF: WAF has to support extensions as defined by IETF RFC 7635[70]. WAF
generates a self-contained access token and other required parameters (TURN
session key and key id) in compliance with IETF RFC 7635[70]. The WAF and the
TURN server share a long-term secret K. This key is used by the WAF to
generate additional keys for encrypting the access token and ensuring message
integrity of the message. Additional details on this can be found in IETF RFC
7635[70]. The provisioning of the long-term secret key in WAF and TURN server
is out of scope of this solution.
\- WebRTC IMS Client (WIC): The WIC performs the HTTPS request to WAF to
obtain the access token, TURN session key and the key id. The WAF responds
with the required parameters. The WIC configures these parameters in the TURN
client through the W3C RTCPeerConnection API.
This solution also assumes that the TURN client and the TURN server are
compliant with the extensions defined in IETF RFC 7635[70].
### X.5.3.2 Procedures
The procedure provided in this clause is non-normative text due to 3GPP's
decision not to standardize the interfaces between the WIC and the WWSF (W1)
and between the WWSF and the WAF (W4). These reference points may therefore be
realized in a way different from the one described in this clause.
Figure X.5.3.2-1 illustrates a TURN authentication flow in IMS WebRTC based on
OAuth 2.0 access token. As an example flow, OAuth Client credentials grant is
used in this procedure to obtain an access token.
Following is the mapping of various roles:
a) The Browser, executing ICE Agent on behalf of the WIC, is the TURN client.
b) The WWSF is the OAuth client that interacts with the OAuth server to
authenticate, and obtain access token.
c) The WAF is the OAuth authorization server that authenticates WWSF, the
OAuth client, and issues access token and other required TURN parameters.
d) The TURN server is the OAuth resource server that receives and validates
the access token from the TURN client.
Figure X.5.3.2-1 TURN authentication based on OAuth 2.0 access token
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
**[Pre-requisite :]{.underline}**
**a. WWSF registers with the WAF [72]**
**WWSF, as the OAuth client, registers with the WAF associated with the TURN
server. The WAF assigns a unique client id and client password to the
registered WIC.**
**b. WIC registers with the IMS**
**The WIC performs IMS registration before the user is allowed to use IMS
services. The user accesses a URI to initiate an HTTPS connection to the WWSF.
The WIC is downloaded and initialized by the browser. The WIC performs one of
the IMS WebRTC registration procedures to register with the IMS network.**
**Both these steps are completed in advance of the following steps.**
**1\. User clicks on a button to make a WebRTC call**
The user clicks on a button to make a WebRTC call.
**2\. WIC requests Access token**
The WIC requests access token from the WWSF.
**3\. User authentication and authorization**
The WWSF authenticates the user and obtains user authorization to allow WIC to
setup a call.
NOTE 1: This step is optional. WWSF could skip this step if it has
authenticated and obtained user's authorization during IMS registration in
scenarios 2 and 3, and IMS registration is still considered active.
**4\. WWSF requests access token from WAF**
WWSF starts the OAuth Client credentials flow [72]. It issues HTTP GET to
request access token from WAF. WWSF includes client_id and client_password in
this request. The complete set of required parameters to be included in this
GET request is defined in IETF RFC 7635[70].
**5\. WAF validates WWSF and issues access token**
WAF authenticates WWSF and generates access token, session key and key id
(kid) according to IETF RFC 7635[70]. Access token is structured according to
the format in IETF RFC 7635[70].
The access token, session key and key identifier (kid) is returned back to
WWSF.
**6\. WIC obtains access token from WWSF**
WWSF forwards the access token, session key and the key identifier (kid) to
WIC.
**7\. WIC initiates a WebRTC connection setup**
The WIC initiates a WebRTC connection using W3C's RTCPeerConnection API. TURN
Server URI, key id (as username), session key (as credential) and access token
are passed as arguments to this API.
**8\. Obtain "relayed transport address" on the TURN server**
NOTE 2: This step is executed by WebRTC stack in the browser.
The WebRTC stack in the browser executes TURN protocol using enhancements for
third party authorization as defined in IETF RFC 7635[70]. A relayed transport
address is allocated in the TURN server.
All communication between the WIC and TURN server is now integrity protected.
NOTE 3: It is recommended that this solution be only used in IMS registrations
scenarios 2 and 3. In both the scenarios, the user authentication is delegated
by the IMS network to either the WWSF or the WAF. Once the user is
authenticated, WAF provides WIC with an access token. The WIC then presents
this token to the IMS network during IMS registration. This is very similar to
the procedure described in this section for TURN client authentication based
on OAuth access token. It is therefore possible to use the same WAF for
generating access token for TURN authentication.
NOTE 4: IMS Registration scenario 3 provides a mechanism by which an anonymous
user skips authenticating with the WWSF but is able to access IMS services
like any other authenticated user. Similar mechanism is supported by this
solution when \"client credentials\" based flow is used for TURN
authentication. In the client credentials flow, WWSF is the OAuth client and
requests access token on behalf of the user. WWSF authentication is performed
by WAF, whereas the user authentication is performed by the WWSF. Therefore
when anonymous user requests an access token, WWSF skips user authentication
for the user. In the backend it will authenticate with the WAF and obtain an
access token. The access token is then presented back to the user.
