# 5 Channel coding, multiplexing and interleaving
Data and control streams from/to MAC layer are encoded /decoded to offer
transport and control services over the radio transmission link. Channel
coding scheme is a combination of error detection, error correcting, rate
matching, interleaving and transport channel or control information mapping
onto/splitting from physical channels.
## 5.1 Generic procedures
This clause contains coding procedures which are used for more than one
transport channel or control information type.
### 5.1.1 CRC calculation
Denote the input bits to the CRC computation by, and the parity bits by. _A_
is the size of the input sequence and _L_ is the number of parity bits. The
parity bits are generated by one of the following cyclic generator
polynomials:
\- g~CRC24A~(_D_) = [_D_ ^24^ + _D_ ^23^ + _D_ ^18^ + _D_ ^17^ + _D_ ^14^ +
_D_ ^11^ + _D_ ^10^ + _D_ ^7^ + _D_ ^6^ + _D_ ^5^ + _D_ ^4^ + _D_ ^3^ + _D_ \+
1] and;
\- g~CRC24B~(_D_) = [_D_ ^24^ + _D_ ^23^ + _D_ ^6^ + _D_ ^5^ + _D_ \+ 1] for a
CRC length _L_ = 24 and;
\- g~CRC16~(_D_) = [_D_ ^16^ + _D_ ^12^ + _D_ ^5^ + 1] for a CRC length _L_ =
16.
\- g~CRC8~(_D_) = [_D_ ^8^ + _D_ ^7^ + _D_ ^4^ + _D_ ^3^ + _D_ \+ 1] for a CRC
length of _L_ = 8.
The encoding is performed in a systematic form, which means that in GF(2), the
polynomial:
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by the corresponding length-24 CRC
generator polynomial, g~CRC24A~(_D_) or g~CRC24B~(_D_), the polynomial:
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC16~(_D_), and the
polynomial:
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC8~(_D_).
The bits after CRC attachment are denoted by, where _B_ = _A_ \+ _L_. The
relation between _a~k~_ and _b~k~_ is:
for _k_ = 0, 1, 2, ..., _A_ -1
for _k_ = _A_ , _A_ +1, _A_ +2, ..., _A_ +_L_ -1.
### 5.1.2 Code block segmentation and code block CRC attachment
The input bit sequence to the code block segmentation is denoted by, where _B_
> 0\. If _B_ is larger than the maximum code block size _Z_ , segmentation of
the input bit sequence is performed and an additional CRC sequence of _L_ = 24
bits is attached to each code block. The maximum code block size is:
\- _Z_ = 6144.
If the number of filler bits _F_ calculated below is not 0, filler bits are
added to the beginning of the first block.
> Note that if _B \  block.
The filler bits shall be set to \ at the input to the encoder.
Total number of code blocks _C_ is determined by:
if
_L_ = 0
Number of code blocks:
else
_L_ = 24
Number of code blocks: .
end if
The bits output from code block segmentation, for _C_ ≠ 0, are denoted by ,
where _r_ is the code block number, and _K~r~_ is the number of bits for the
code block number _r_.
Number of bits in each code block (applicable for _C_ ≠ 0 only):
First segmentation size: = minimum _K_ in table 5.1.3-3 such that
if
the number of code blocks with length is =1, ,
else if
Second segmentation size: = maximum _K_ in table 5.1.3-3 such that
Number of segments of size: .
Number of segments of size _:_ .
end if
Number of filler bits:
for _k =_ 0 to _F_ -1 -- Insertion of filler bits
end for
_k_ = _F_
_s_ = 0
for _r_ = 0 to _C_ -1
if
else
end if
while
end while
if _C_ >1
The sequence is used to calculate the CRC parity bits according to clause
5.1.1 with the generator polynomial g~CRC24B~(_D_). For CRC calculation it is
assumed that filler bits, if present, have the value 0.
while
end while
end if
end for
### 5.1.3 Channel coding
The bit sequence input for a given code block to channel coding is denoted by,
where _K_ is the number of bits to encode. After encoding the bits are denoted
by, where _D_ is the number of encoded bits per output stream and _i_ indexes
the encoder output stream. The relation between and and between _K_ and _D_ is
dependent on the channel coding scheme.
The following channel coding schemes can be applied to TrCHs:
\- tail biting convolutional coding;
\- turbo coding.
Usage of coding scheme and coding rate for the different types of TrCH is
shown in table 5.1.3-1. Usage of coding scheme and coding rate for the
different control information types is shown in table 5.1.3-2.
The values of _D_ in connection with each coding scheme:
\- tail biting convolutional coding with rate 1/3: _D = K_ ;
\- turbo coding with rate 1/3: _D_ = _K_ \+ 4.
The range for the output stream index _i_ is 0, 1 and 2 for both coding
schemes.

_G_(_D_) = {width="0.6979166666666666in" height="0.5520833333333334in"},
where
_g_ ~0~(_D_) = 1 + _D_ ^2^ + _D_ ^3^,
_g_ ~1~(_D_) = 1 + _D_ \+ _D_ ^3^.
The initial value of the shift registers of the 8-state constituent encoders
shall be all zeros when starting to encode the input bits.
The output from the turbo encoder is
for .
If the code block to be encoded is the 0-th code block and the number of
filler bits is greater than zero, i.e., _F_ > 0, then the encoder shall set
_c~k~_ , = 0, _k_ = 0,...,(_F_ -1) at its input and shall set , _k_ =
0,...,(_F_ -1) and , _k_ = 0,...,(_F_ -1) at its output.

the first and second 8-state constituent encoders are denoted by and,
respectively. The bits output from the turbo code internal interleaver are

trellis termination only)
##### 5.1.3.2.2 Trellis termination for turbo encoder

register feedback after all information bits are encoded. Tail bits are padded
after the encoding of information bits.

encoder (upper switch of figure 5.1.3-2 in lower position) while the second
constituent encoder is disabled. The last three tail bits shall be used to
terminate the second constituent encoder (lower switch of figure 5.1.3-2 in

The \"x\" and \"y\" in Table 5.2.2.6-3 and 5.2.2.6-4 are placeholders for [2]
to scramble the RI bits in a way that maximizes the Euclidean distance of the

For the case where RI feedback for more than one DL cell is to be reported,
the RI report for each DL cell is concatenated prior to coding in increasing

For the case where RI feedback for more than one CSI process is to be

For the case where RI feedback consists of one or two bits of information the

is the total number of coded bits for all the encoded RI blocks. The last
concatenation of the encoded RI block may be partial so that the total bit

For the case where RI feedback consists of bits of information, the bit
sequence is obtained by the circular repetition of the bit sequence so that
the total bit sequence length is equal to.
For the case where CRI feedback is to be reported, the same procedures for RI
are applied for CRI. When rank information is to be multiplexed with UL-SCH at
a given PUSCH, the rank information is multiplexed in all layers of all
transport blocks of that PUSCH. For a given transport block, the vector
sequence output of the channel coding for rank information is denoted by ,
where , are column vectors of length and where . The vector sequence is
obtained as follows:
Set _i_ , _j_ , _k_ to 0
while

\-- replicating the row vector _N~L~_ times and transposing into a column
vector
end while
where is the number of layers onto which the UL-SCH transport block is mapped.
The same processing procedures for RI and RI multiplexing with UL-SCH at a
given PUSCH are applied for CRI, using CRI instead of RI in the equations.

corresponding PUSCH, and on the uplink power control subframe set for the

##### 5.2.2.6.4 Channel coding for CQI/PMI information in PUSCH
The channel quality bits input to the channel coding block are denoted by
where _O_ is the number of bits. The number of channel quality bits depends on
the transmission format. When PUCCH-based reporting format is used, the number
of CQI/PMI bits is defined in clause 5.2.3.3.1 for wideband reports and in
clause 5.2.3.3.2 for UE selected subbands reports. When PUSCH-based reporting
format is used, the number of CQI/PMI bits is defined in clause 5.2.2.6.1 for
wideband reports, in clause 5.2.2.6.2 for higher layer configured subbands
reports and in clause 5.2.2.6.3 for UE selected subbands reports.
The channel quality information is first coded using a (32, _O_) block code.
The code words of the (32, _O_) block code are a linear combination of the 11
basis sequences denoted M~i,n~ and defined in Table 5.2.2.6.4-1.

#### 5.2.2.8 Channel interleaver
The channel interleaver described in this clause in conjunction with the
resource element mapping for PUSCH in [2] implements a time-first mapping of
modulation symbols onto the transmit waveform while ensuring that
\- if the PUSCH is Partial PUSCH Mode 1, the CQI/PMI and RI information are
present only on the second slot of the subframe regardless of the number of
actually transmitted slot(s) for the subframe based on the result of the
channel access procedure in 4.2.1 defined in [8];
\- if the PUSCH is Partial PUSCH Mode 2 or 3, the CQI/PMI and RI information
are present only on the scheduled slot of the subframe;
\- if the PUSCH is AUL PUSCH, the AUL-UCI is mapped from symbol 1 to symbol 12
of the subframe;
\- otherwise, the HARQ-ACK and RI information are present on both slots in the
subframe for PUSCH with subframe duration. HARQ-ACK information is mapped to
resources around the uplink demodulation reference signals while RI
information is mapped to resources around those used by HARQ-ACK.
The input to the channel interleaver are denoted by
\- {width="1.1666666666666667in" height="0.2951388888888889in"},

AUL PUSCH;
\- otherwise , and .
In case where more than one UL-SCH transport block are transmitted in a
subframe of an UL cell, the HARQ-ACK and RI information are multiplexed with
data on both UL-SCH transport blocks.
The number of modulation symbols per layer in the subframe is given by
\- {width="1.3027777777777778in" height="0.23472222222222222in"} if the PUSCH

for the subframe is AUL PUSCH and the AUL-UCI is multiplexed with data on this
UL-SCH transport block, and
\- otherwise.

modulation symbols in a BL/CE subframe _s_ of the _S_ subframes allocated to a
UL-SCH transport block, _s =_ 0, 1, 2, ..., _S_ -1 [3]. The output bit
sequence from the channel interleaver is derived as follows:

corresponding transport block if that transport block has previously been
transmitted using two layers with closed-loop spatial multiplexing.
If the number of information bits in format 2 carried by PDCCH belongs to one

Some entries in Table 5.3.3.1.5-4 and Table 5.3.3.1.5-5 are used for
indicating that the eNodeB has applied precoding according to PMI(s) reported
by the UE. In these cases the precoding for the corresponding RB(s) in
subframe _n_ is according to the latest PMI(s) in an aperiodic CSI reported on
