# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report on LTE inter-band CA for 2 bands DL
with 2 bands UL under Rel-16 time frame. The purpose is to gather the relevant
background information and studies in order to address 2 bands DL/2 band UL
Inter-band Carrier Aggregation requirements for the Rel-16 band combinations
in Table 1-1.

# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 2 bands DL/2 bands UL Inter-
band Carrier Aggregation under Rel-16 timeframe. The document covers each band
combination specific issues (i.e. one sub-clause defined per band combination)
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.

### 5.1.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For 2UL CA_3-11, the same requirements on values for ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ of
1UL CA_3-11 can be applied. Therefore, for two simultaneous UL, the ∆T~IB,c~
and ∆R~IB,c~ values are shown in table 5.1.3-1 and in table 5.1.3-2.

[2] for DL_26A-48A_UL_ 26A-48A_BCS0.
### 5.2.2 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values

As shown in table 6.8.3.1-2 of the TR 36.715-02-02 [2], IMD up to 5^th^ order
does not fall into own Rx of band 26 and 48. Therefore, no MSD requirement is
needed for these CA configurations in TS 36.101.

### 5.3.4 REFSENS requirements
For these combinations, sensitivity degradation is allowed for a band if it is
impacted by the UL of another band that is part of the same DC configuration
due to cross band isolation issues. RAN4 studied the impact of cross band
isolation between Band 25 and n41 for DC_25A_n41A and decided that the MSD
would be [0.6] dB the B25 DL due to n41 UL, and no MSD for the n41 DL due to
the B25 UL. The same analysis is applied to the LTE CA combinations between
B25 and B41. Reference sensitivity is specified in Table 5.3.4-1 with uplink
configuration specified in Table 5.3.4-2.

According to the co-existence analysis in table 5.3.2-1, the 3^rd^ order IMD
frequency range from "fx_low -- max BW fy" to "fx_low + max BW fy" may fall
into own Rx of band 25 in 1930 to 1935 MHz. However, when the UE is
transmitting in 1910-1915 MHz, it will not be receiving in 1930-1935 MHz.
Thus, no IMD issues are expected for this CA configuration with dual uplink
carrier.

Based on Table 5.7.2-1, 5th order IMD may also fall into Rx frequencies of
bands 66 as well as that 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx
frequencies of band 48.

These need to be covered in TS 36.101 as in table below. MSD value are same as
for CA_2A-49A.

As also can be seen in 5.8.2 there is MSD needed for band 2 2^nd^ harmonics
falling into band 48 which are already covered in TS 36.101 Table 7.3.1A-0a
and Table 7.3.1A-0b. However, Table 7.3.1A-0a and Table 7.3.1A-0b also need to
include the new DL configurations added: CA_2A-48A-48D, CA_2A-48E and
CA_2A-48A-48E.

### 5.9.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
The ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values for two band CA_2-14 are already specified in
TS 36.101 Table 6.2.5-2 (two bands) for ΔT~IB,c~ and Table 7.3.1-1A (two
bands) for ΔR~IB,c~.
### 5.9.4 REFSENS requirements
Since there is no harmonic or IMD relation, no MSD is required due to harmonic
or IMD.

E-UTRA Band 42 F~DL_low~ - F~DL_high~ -50 1 2 NOTE 2: As exceptions,
measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 are permitted for each assigned E-UTRA carrier used in the
measurement due to 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^ [or 5^th^] harmonic spurious emissions.
Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the exception is also allowed for
the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic emission on
both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception
interval centred at the harmonic emission of (2MHz + N x L~CRB~ x 180kHz),
where N is 2, 3, 4, [5] for the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^ [or 5^th^] harmonic
respectively. The exception is allowed if the measurement bandwidth (MBW)
totally or partially overlaps the overall exception interval.

### 5.9.4 REFSENS requirements
As can be seen in 5.9.2 there is MSD needed for IMD5 falling into band 66\.
These need to be covered in TS 36.101 as in table below. MSD value derived
from other used IMD5 MSD values in Table 7.3.1A-0f.

falling into band 48 which are already covered in TS 36.101 Table 7.3.1A-0a
and Table 7.3.1A-0b.

own DL bands. The 3^rd^ harmonic of band 28 UL falls into band 4 DL.
The spurious emission towards UE coexisting bands are specified for Regions 3
according to band 4 and band 28 coexisting bands.

It can be seen from Table 5.15.2-1 that there is no IMD impact towards any of
its own downlink bands.

It can be seen from Table 5.16.2-1 that
\- The 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into the Rx of Band18，
\- The 5^th^ order IMD may fall into the Rx of Band 41, since B41 is a TDD
band, there is no IMD impact.
\- The 3^rd^ harmonic mixing may fall into The Rx of Band 18..
Since B18 only was used in Japan, considering KDDI's spectrum, there is no IMD
impact to Band 18.

configuration.
