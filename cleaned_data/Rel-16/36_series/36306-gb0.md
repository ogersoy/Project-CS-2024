# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Fallback band combination:** A band combination that would result from
another band combination (parent band combination) by releasing at least one
SCell or uplink configuration of SCell. A fallback band combination supports
the same channel bandwidths for each carrier as its parent band combination.
An intra-band non-contiguous band combination is not considered to be a
fallback band combination of an intra-band contiguous band combination.
**NB-IoT:** NB-IoT allows access to network services via E-UTRA with a channel
bandwidth limited to 200 kHz (corresponding to one PRB).
**Primary Cell:** The cell, operating on the primary frequency, in which the
UE either performs the initial connection establishment procedure or initiates
the connection re-establishment procedure, or the cell indicated as the
primary cell in the handover procedure. In this specification, Primary Cell
also refers to PSCell defined in TS 36.331 [5] unless explicitly stated
otherwise.
**Sidelink** : UE to UE interface for sidelink communication, V2X sidelink
communication and sidelink discovery. The Sidelink corresponds to the PC5
interface as defined in TS 23.303 [24].
**Sidelink communication** : AS functionality enabling ProSe Direct
Communication as defined in TS 23.303 [24], between two or more nearby UEs,
using E-UTRA technology but not traversing any network node. In this version,
the terminology \"sidelink communication\" without \"V2X\" prefix only
concerns PS unless specifically stated otherwise.
**Sidelink discovery** : AS functionality enabling ProSe Direct Discovery as
defined in TS 23.303 [24], using E-UTRA technology but not traversing any
network node.
**V2X sidelink communication** : AS functionality enabling V2X Communication
as defined in TS 23.285 [29], between nearby UEs, using E-UTRA technology but
not traversing any network node.

# 4 UE radio access capability parameters
The following clauses define the UE radio access capability parameters and
minimum capabilities for MBMS capable UE. Only parameters for which there is
the possibility for UEs to signal different values are considered as UE radio
access capability parameters. Therefore, mandatory features without capability
parameters that are the same for all UEs are not listed here. Also
capabilities which are optional or conditionally mandatory for UEs to
implement but do not have UE radio access capability parameter are listed in
this specification.
E-UTRAN needs to respect the signalled UE radio access capability parameters
when configuring the UE and when scheduling the UE.
All parameters shown in italics are signalled and correspond to a field
defined in TS 36.331 [5].
For optional features, the UE radio access capability parameter indicates
whether the feature has been implemented and successfully tested. For
mandatory features with the UE radio access capability parameter, the
parameter indicates whether the feature has been successfully tested.
The mandatory features required to be supported by a UE are the same for all
UE categories unless explicitly specified elsewhere in the specifications.
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements on the maximum number of transport
block bits are applicable for a TTI length of 1 ms. For other TTI lengths, the
requirements shall be scaled according to clause 7.1.7 or 11.1 in TS 36.213
[22] in order to get the corresponding requirement.

## 4.1A _ue-CategoryDL_ and _ue-CategoryUL_
The fields _ue-CategoryDL_ and _ue-CategoryUL_ define downlink/uplink
capability respectively. The parameters set by the UE DL/UL Categories are
defined in clause 4.2. Tables 4.1A-1 and 4.1A-2 define the downlink and,
respectively, uplink physical layer parameter values for each UE DL/UL
Category. Table 4.1A-4 defines the minimum capability for the maximum number
of bits of a MCH transport block received within a TTI for an MBMS capable UE
capable of reception via MBSFN. Table 4.1A-6 defines the only combinations for
UE UL and DL Categories that are allowed to be signalled with _ue-CategoryDL_
and _ue-CategoryUL. Table 4.1A-6 also defines which UE Categories a UE shall
indicate in addition to the_ combinations for UE UL and DL Categories _._ For
a BL UE, Table 4.1A-7 defines the only combinations for UE UL and DL
Categories that are allowed to be signalled with _ue-CategoryDL_ and _ue-
CategoryUL_ , and which UE Categories a UE shall indicate in addition to the
combinations for UE UL and DL Categories. A UE indicating DL category 13 may
indicate category 9 or 10 in _ue-Category-v1170_. A UE indicating Category M2
shall also indicate Category M1.

inter-band, intra-band non-contiguous, intra-band contiguous carrier
aggregation and without carrier aggregation. For each band in a band
combination the UE provides the supported CA bandwidth classes and the
corresponding MIMO capabilities for downlink. The UE also has to provide the
supported uplink CA bandwidth class and the corresponding MIMO capability for
at least one band in the band combination. Applicability of provisioning
uplink CA bandwidth class for each band in the band combinations is defined in
TS 36.101 [6]. A MIMO capability applies to all carriers of a bandwidth class
of a band in a band combination. For bandwidth classes that include multiple
component carriers (i.e. bandwidth classes B, C, D and so on), the UE may also
indicate a separate MIMO capability that applies to each individual carrier of
a bandwidth class of a band in a band combination.
In all non-CA band combinations the UE shall indicate a bandwidth class
supporting the maximum channel bandwidth defined for the band.
In all non-CA band combinations the UE shall indicate at least the number of
layers for spatial multiplexing according to the UE\'s Rel-8/9 category (Cat.
1-5). If the UE provides a Rel-10 category (Cat. 6-8) it shall indicate at
least the number of layers according to that category for at least one band
combination. In all other band combinations a UE indicating a category 2 and
higher shall indicate support for at least 2 layers for downlink spatial
multiplexing for all bands. The indicated number of layers for spatial
multiplexing may exceed the number of layers required according to the
category indicated by the UE. The carrier aggregation and MIMO capabilities
indicated for at least one band combination together with modulation scheme
shall meet the processing requirements defined by the physical layer parameter
values in the UE category (i.e., maximum number of DL-SCH/UL-SCH transport
block bits received/transmitted within a TTI, maximum number of bits of a DL-
SCH/UL-SCH transport block received/transmitted within a TTI, and total number
of soft channel bits for downlink).
NOTE: If the UE reports a subset of supported band combinations based on
_requestedFrequencyBands_ and/or _skipFallbackCombinations_ and/or
_maximumCCsRetrieval,_ reported band combination(s) may or may not meet the
processing requirements defined by the physical layer parameter values in the
UE category.
The UE that supports MBMS reception via MBSFN shall support MBMS reception via
MBSFN on the PCell of MCG, and it may indicate support for MBMS reception via
MBSFN on configured SCells (_mbms-SCell_) and for any cell that may be
additionally configured as an SCell (_mbms-NonServingCell_) according to this
field. The UE may indicate support for MBMS reception from FeMBMS/Unicast
mixed cells (_fembmsMixedCell_) or MBMS-dedicated cells
(_fembmsDedicatedCell_). The UE that supports MBMS reception via SC-PTM shall
support MBMS reception via SC-PTM on the PCell of MCG, and it may indicate
support for MBMS reception via SC-PTM on configured SCells (_scptm-SCell_) and
for any cell that may be additionally configured as an SCell (_scptm-
NonServingCell_) according to this field. The UE shall apply the system
information acquisition and change monitoring procedure relevant for MBMS
operation for these cells.
The UE indicating more than one frequency in the _MBMSInterestIndication_
message as specified in TS 36.331 [5] shall support simultaneous reception of
MBMS (via MBSFN or SC-PTM) on the indicated frequencies when the frequencies
of the configured serving cells and the indicated frequencies belong to at
least one band combination.
NOTE: For the purposes of determining whether the carrier aggregation and MIMO
capabilities indicated for a band combination meets the processing
requirements defined by the physical layer parameter values in the UE category
as described above, the carrier aggregation and MIMO capabilities indicated
for a band combination is considered to meet the processing requirements if
the UE supports the maximum processing requirements defined by the UE category
assuming 20MHz channel bandwidth is supported on all bands.
While PCell is not changed, the UE shall support release of any SCell(s) or
any uplink configuration of SCell(s) without requiring reconfiguration of
parameters related to UE radio access capabilities for the remaining serving
cell(s) in the fallback band combination, except for release of an SCell from
a contiguous CA band configuration that results in a non-contiguous CA band
configuration.
While reporting the sTTI/sPT capabilities, the UE is allowed to report the
same band combination more than once with this IE, if the UE supports
different combinations of the corresponding sTTI/sPT capabilities.

component carriers with uplink is included in this field, the UE supports
Extended PHR MAC Control Element supporting 32 serving cells with configured
uplink as specified in TS 36.321 [4].
If the fallback band combinations for a given band combination are omitted in
this field (see TS 36.331 [5]), the UE shall for all the omitted fallback band
combinations support the same UE radio access capabilities as for the parent
band combination.
NOTE: A fallback band combination may have multiple different parent band
combinations.
While reporting the sTTI/sPT capabilities, the UE is allowed to report the
same band combination more than once with this IE, if the UE supports
different combinations of the corresponding sTTI/sPT capabilities.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Guideline on maximum number of DL PDCP SDUs
per TTI
In order to help the dimensioning of the UE design, values for the maximum
number of DL PDCP SDUs per TTI from Table A-1 may be used. The values are
applicable for a TTI length of 1 ms. For other TTI lengths, the table refers
to maximum number of DL PDCP SDUs within a 1ms period.
NOTE: Due to the need for the network buffer data for efficient scheduling,
values for Category 1, 1bis and 2 are same. It is not expected that category 1
or category 1bis UE has to sustain the same rate of PDCP SDUs per TTI as
category 2 for prolonged period of time.
Table A-1: Maximum values for DL PDCP SDUs per TTI
