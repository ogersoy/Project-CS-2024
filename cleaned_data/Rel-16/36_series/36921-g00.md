# 1 Scope
This document is a technical report of the work item on FDD Home eNodeB RF
Requirements [1]. The goal of this technical report is to satisfy the two
objectives of the work item, which are reproduced below,
##### Objective 1 {#objective-1 .H6}
The existing E-UTRA BS class does not fully address the RF requirements of the
HeNB application. Correspondingly, Objective 1 is to specify the RF
requirements for the Home eNodeB in TS 36.104, where the work done for the HNB
can be taken as a basis.
Furthermore, the test specification TS 36.141 would need to be updated
accordingly.
It is foreseen that the HeNB-specific additions to TS 36.104 / 36.141 can be
accommodated in a manner similar to that accomplished for the UTRA HNB.
##### Objective 2 {#objective-2 .H6}
TR 25.820 showed that for the CSG HNB there are occasions where overall system
performance may be enhanced by controlling the HNB output power dependent on
the strength of signal from the macro cell layer and from other HNB. Control
of CSG HNB output power mitigates interference to the macro layer and other
CSG HNB. Correspondingly, it is expected that similar observations may be made
for the HeNB. Objective 2 is to ensure that operators have the ability to
achieve control of HeNB power; in particular, the work should cover but not be
limited by the following,
• The operator has the means to obtain measurements of the strength of signals
and the identity (to allow macro neighbour cell list building) from the macro
cell layer and from other HeNBs. Measurements may be made by the HeNB or may
make use of existing measurements defined for the UE; no new UE measurements
will be defined.
• The operator has the means to set the maximum output power of the HeNB, this
is expected to introduce changes to TS 36.104.
• The operator has guidance on how to control HeNB power and expected
performance levels in the relevant scenarios. There are additional factors
that may be controlled in E-UTRA in comparison with UTRA, such as variable
bandwidth and allocation of radio sub-carriers; work will be conducted to
investigate if similar mechanisms may be used for controlling HeNB resource
allocation versus the macro cell layer and versus other HeNBs. Additionally,
mechanisms may be applied to control HeNB coverage in the case of open access
HeNB.
As objective 2 of the work item is to create a published document to provide
guidance to operators it is necessary to issue a TR in the 900 series. To
avoid administrative overhead this TR will also be used to document any other
output from this work item.

# 4 General
As agreed in the work item proposal [1]:
Within the course of increasing terminal penetration and fixed-mobile
convergence, an upcoming demand for LTE Home eNodeBs is observed to provide
attractive services and data rates in home environments.
E-UTRAN was developed and defined under the assumption of coordinated network
deployment whereas home eNodeBs are typically associated with uncoordinated
and large scale deployment.
Aim of this work item is to amend the E-UTRAN eNodeB related RF specifications
and base the work on the experience gathered in the RAN4 specific part of TR
25.820 to support the Home eNodeBs application. No changes to the UE RF
specifications are foreseen.
The scope of this work item is limited to the E-UTRA FDD mode.
The interference analysis can be expected to be similar to that conducted for
UTRA so the conclusions from that work would be expected to broadly apply to
E-UTRA as well.
## 4.1 Task description
### 4.1.1 HeNB Class definition
The purpose of this work is to update the radio performance requirement
specification TS 36.104, further work required to agree on new parameter
values will be documented in the TR and the updates required in test
specification TS 36.141 will be documented.
### 4.1.2 HeNB measurements and adaptation
The purpose of this work item is to ensure that operators have necessary
information about how to adjust the output transmission power of HeNB as a
function of the signal strength from the macro cell layer, and/or from other
HeNBs, in order to enhance overall system performance.
In order to achieve this, (at least) the following areas should be addressed:
1) Guidance on how to control HeNB power
a) The intention is to provide guidance to operators on possible strategies
and expected performance in typical exemplary deployment scenarios.
b) Is it possible to have the same mechanism to control HeNB output power with
respect to the macro cell layer, other surrounding HeNBs, and in the case of
HeNB coverage control for open access HeNB.
c) It is not the intention to mandate HeNB behaviour.
2) Measurements of surrounding environment (i.e. macro and other HeNBs signal
strength)
a) Issues to address include factors that govern accuracy and timeliness of
the suggested measurements, and the ability to identify the macro neighbour
cell list.
b) It is not the intention to restrict the vendor\'s scope about how to
perform measurements.
c) It is envisaged that measurements will be performed directly by the HeNB or
by employing the UEs attached to the HeNB, using existing UE defined
measurements.
3) Mechanism to set maximum power
a) Issues to address include accuracy and timeliness of HeNB maximum power
setting.
b) It is not the intention to restrict the vendor\'s scope about how to
process measurements.
c) It is not the intention to restrict the vendor\'s scope about which network
element the measurements may be processed in.
d) It is not the intention to restrict to which network entities measurements
are reported. However, it is not envisaged that new signalling will be
standardised to support this.
4) Mechanism to adjust HeNB uplink.
a) Issues to address include possibility to adjust uplink noise rise target.
b) It is not the intention to restrict the vendor\'s scope about what actions
may be taken regarding HeNB uplink.

# 7 Guidance on How to Control HeNB Interference
## 7.1 HeNB Measurements
Several types of measurements that HeNB can perform are listed in the
following subsections. The objectives of the HeNB measurements are
\- to provide sufficient information to the HeNB for the purpose of
interference mitigation
\- to provide sufficient information to the HeNB such that the HeNB coverage
can be maintained.
According to the measurement type, some of these measurements can be collected
through Connected Mode UEs attached to the HeNB or via a DL Receiver function
within the HeNB itself. Such DL receiver function is also called Network
Listen Mode (NLM), Radio Environment Measurement (REM) or \"HeNB Sniffer\".
These measurements can also be used during the HeNB self-configuration
process.
### 7.1.1 Measurements from all cells
This section identifies the potential measurements performed by HeNB during
self-configuration and normal operation. Based on the measurements in Table
7.1.1-1, the HeNB can obtain useful information from its surrounding cells for
purposes such as interference management.

* * *
Received Interference Power Calculation of UL interference towards HeNB (from
MUE) HeNB UL Receiver
HeNB could use the Received Interference Power measurement to monitor the
uplink interference. For example, a Received Interference Power measurement
value larger than a pre-defined threshold would mean that at least an MUE
which is interfered by a HeNB is close to the HeNB and that the MUE\'s Tx
power would cause significant interference towards the HeNB. This measurement
value may be used in calculating path loss between the HeNB and the MUE
assuming that a single MUE dominates the interference. It is also preferable
for the HeNB to distinguish between UL interference from the MUE and wanted
signals from HUEs to improve the accuracy of interference measurement.
### 7.1.2 Measurements to identify surrounding cell layers
This section identifies the potential measurements performed by HeNB during
self-configuration and normal operation. Based on the measurements in Table
7.1.2-1, the HeNB can obtain useful information to identify the layer of its
surrounding cells and indirectly identifies other HeNBs nearby for purposes
such as mobility handling.

### 7.1.3 Measurements from macro cell layer
This section identifies the potential measurements performed by HeNB during
self-configuration and normal operation. Based on the measurements in Table
7.1.3-1, the HeNB can obtain useful information from its surrounding macro
cells for purposes such as interference management.

HeNB could detect the presence of a dominant UL interferer in order to
determine if there is a nearby victim UE requiring protection on the DL.
If a HeNB has receiver capability, in addition to the measurements listed in
Table 7.1.3-1, HeNB is able to measure the received CRS Êc, measured in dBm,
which is the Reference Signal Received Power per resource element present at
the Home BS antenna connector for the Reference Signal received on the co-
channel. For CRS Êc determination, the cell-specific reference signal R0
according TS 36.211 shall be used. If the HeNB can reliably detect that
multiple TX antennas are used for transmission on the co-channel, it may use
the average in [W] of the CRS Êc on all detected antennas. On start-up, the
HeNB can measure the CRS Êc power from the most dominant co-channel deployed
macro cell.

purposes such as interference management.

## 7.2 Control of HeNB Downlink Interference
### 7.2.1 Control Channel Protection
Several techniques have been considered for data interference management (see
[3] for a list of some of these techniques). However control channel
interference management is equally important since improved data SINR is not
useful if the UEs cannot receive control channels. Thus, it is vital to have
techniques that address control channel interference.
Downlink control channel (PDCCH) interference can occur in two directions in
co-channel HeNB deployments.
• HeNB (aggressor) to macro-UE (victim), and
• macro-eNB (aggressor) to HUE (victim) if the UE is connected to a weaker
HeNB cell (e.g. to access local information at the HeNB).
This can lead to problems both in connected mode and in idle mode such as:
1) UE being unable to reliably decode paging channel resulting in missed pages
and therefore a user\'s inability to receive UE-terminated calls,
2) UE being unable to read common control channels, and
3) throughput degradation or degraded PDSCH performance.
The following are some of the techniques that could be used for control
channel protection. It should be noted that some of these aspects may require
UE implementation changes and should be considered for Rel 10 and beyond. It
is possible that these methods offer gains for Rel 8/9 UEs; however, this
needs to be studied further.
#### 7.2.1.1 Time shifting for overlapped carriers with frame time shifting at
symbol level
##### 7.2.1.1.1 Time shifting at symbol level
This technique is applicable when the HeNB and the eNB are time-synchronized.
This approach uses time shifting of HeNB transmission by _k_ symbols (i.e. to
avoid overlap with macro-eNB control region size _k_) relative to macro-eNB
downlink frame timing and uses HeNB/macro-eNB power reduction or muting on the
portion of a symbol (or symbols) that overlap the control region of macro-
eNB/HeNB (see Figure 7.2.1.1). The HeNB (macro-eNB) could also use power
reduction on all the RBs (i.e. say 25 RBs) overlapping the macro-eNB (HeNB)
control region to improve PDSCH performance for macro-eNB (HeNB). A single
OFDM symbol HeNB control region (_n_ = 1) is preferred for PDSCH efficiency
which leaves 5 CCEs for HeNB control channels which should be sufficient for
HeNB control signaling. However the use of all allowed symbols for control is
not precluded.
Due to the time shift of HeNB transmissions, the last _k_ symbols of the HeNB
PDSCH region would see interference from the macro-eNB control region. In a
similar way, some symbols in the PDSCH region of macro-eNB would see
interference from a HeNB. The HeNB PDSCH overlap with macro-eNB control region
could be further mitigated by either
a) using truncation so that only _14-n-k_ symbols would be used for HeNB PDSCH
or
b) not using truncation (i.e, using _14-n_ symbols) but accounting for the
overlap via link adaptation including resource allocation and MCS selection.
In Figure 7.2.1.1, a subframe shift plus two symbol shift (_k_ = 16) is shown
where the HeNB SCH/PBCH do not overlap with macro-eNB SCH/PBCH. Then HeNB
(macro-eNB) would have to mute or attenuate its PDSCH symbol(s) overlapping
the macro-eNB (HeNB) control region and would also attenuate or mute RBs or
just the overlapping REs that overlap on the HeNB PBCH and SCH. If attenuation
or muting is carried on a PRB level (by scheduling only close-by UEs or not
scheduling any UEs in 6 PRBs respectively), scheduling can be conducted as
normal and therefore, there are no Rel-8 backwards compatibility issues.

Figure 7.2.1.1 Time-shift HeNB frame timing by k = 16 OFDM symbols relative to
macro-eNB timing
##### 7.2.1.1.2 Carrier offsetting (possibly in addition to frame time
shifting)
The HeNB carrier frequency can be offset from the macro-eNB carrier by 6 RBs
or more in order to mitigate SCH/PBCH interference from macro-eNB. This is
suitable when the HeNB downlink bandwidth is smaller than the macro-eNB
downlink bandwidth (eg. 5 MHz HeNBs are deployed within a 10 or 20 MHz macro-
eNB overlay). This avoids interference from HeNB (macro-eNB) to macro-eNB
(HeNB) SCH/PBCH, if the HeNB (macro-eNB) were to reduce power or mute six RBs
overlapping with the macro-eNB (HeNB) SCH/PBCH. Carrier offsetting could also
be used in conjunction with frame time shifting, as seen in Figure 7.2.1.2.

Figure 7.2.1.2 Time-shift HeNB frame timing by k = 2 OFDM symbols and offset
the HeNB carrier by 6 PRBs (1.08 MHz) relative to macro-eNB timing and carrier
respectively
#### 7.2.1.2 Carrier offsetting or frequency partitioning with per-subband
interference estimation
Frequency partitioning, or carrier offsetting, where HeNBs are confined to use
only a part of the bandwidth can be used to mitigate interference problems.
This scenario is shown in Fig. 7.2.1.2-1. By using scheduling techniques that
would avoid data transmissions on those parts of the bandwidth, the levels of
interference as seen at the receiver can be reduced. This could resolve the
interference problem for the data transmissions, however, control channels
such as PDCCH that span the entire bandwidth would still be affected.
{width="2.1666666666666665in" height="1.6666666666666667in"}
Fig. 7.2.1.2-1 Partial Bandwidth Coexistence
The effects of the high interference seen in one of the subbands can be
mitigated if the interference estimation is done on a per-subband basis. This
would confine the influence of the interference only to that subband and not
allow it to affect the entire bandwidth. This in turn would mean that only
some of the coded bits are affected. When wideband interference estimation is
used, all the bits are affected and the probability of successfully decoding
the message decreases. Assuming sufficient number of CCEs are used (i.e.,
enough code protection), the PDCCH BLER performance would be slightly
degraded. But the transmission would likely be reliable enough not to
significantly affect normal operation.
To illustrate the performance of this scheme, some simulation results are
given. A simulation was performed to evaluate the impact on control channel
performance of high interference on one of the subbands. Results for the cases
of per-subband interference estimation and wideband interference estimation
are presented.
The simulation considers a HeNB that uses one fourth of the bandwidth of the
macro as shown in Fig. 7.2.1.2-1. A UE connected to a macro-eNB and receiving
PDCCH transmission from it, sees high interference on one of the subbands. The
level of interference is varied as a parameter relative to the noise level.
The PDCCH error rate is compared for the cases when wideband interference
estimation and per-subband interference estimation are used. The simulation
parameters are given in Table 7.2.1.2. Only the results for 4 CCE PDCCH are
given here but similar results were observed for other PDCCH sizes. A more
extensive analysis and simulation results can be found in [14].

#### 7.2.1.3 Control of HeNB downlink interference among neighboring HeNBs
control channels by frequency partitioning
Unlike data (PDSCH, PUSCH), there is no HARQ for control channel transmissions
which must typically target fairly low BLER of 1% or less. HeNBs that are in
close proximity of each other will not have reliable downlink control channels
(e.g. PDCCH, PHICH, PCFICH, PBCH, P/S-SCH). One way to solve this is to
segment the LTE carrier and allow the interfering HeNBs to transmit their
control signaling in separate frequency domain resources. For example, if the
LTE carrier is 20MHz then it would be segmented into two 10MHz carriers on the
downlink with each of the two interfering HeNBs transmitting its control
signaling (PDCCH, PHICH, PCFICH, P-SCH, S-SCH, PBCH) on one of the 10 MHz
carriers.
Both Release-8 UEs and Release-9 UEs would access the HeNB as a 10 MHz carrier
and receive control and broadcast signaling from HeNB within 10 MHz. However,
Release-10 UEs can additionally be assigned PDSCH resource on the remaining 10
MHz frequency resources using carrier aggregation. Therefore, while
Release-8/9 UEs are limited to allocations of 50 RBs, Release-10 UEs could be
assigned any portion of the 100 RBs.
### 7.2.2 Data Channel Protection
#### 7.2.2.1 Control of HeNB Downlink Interference towards macro eNB data
channels by frequency partition
Frequency partition between Macro eNB and HeNB can be utilized to mitigate the
interference from HeNB to Macro eNB. HeNB can get frequency partition
information of its neighbor Macro eNB through air link measurement if
additional receiver is enabled on HeNB. Alternatively, a semi-static scheme
can be adopted if a pre-configuration of the frequency partition can be
determined by Macro eNB management server. For example, Macro eNB will
schedule resource blocks to Macro UE based on its location. When HeNB gets its
own location information, it will know which resource blocks will be assigned
to a nearby macro UE.
With the knowledge of the frequency partition information [4], for example,
HeNB knows which set of resource blocks will be used for Macro eNB cell center
users (CCU), and which set of resource blocks will be used for Macrocell cell
edge users (CEU), HeNB can coordinate its transmission to avoid its
interference to nearby Macro UE by giving high scheduling priority to resource
blocks not used by the nearby Macro UE. For example, if HeNB is located at the
edge of the Macro eNB, HeNB will give higher priority to resource blocks used
by macro center UEs for downlink transmission. If HeNB is located at the
center of the Macro eNB, HeNB will give higher priority to resource blocks
used by macro edge UEs for downlink transmission as shown in Figure 7.2.2.1-1.
{width="3.1305555555555555in" height="1.4361111111111111in"}
Figure 7.2.2.1-1 Examples of HeNB and macro UE location
In addition, to minimize the mutual interference between HeNB and surrounding
cells, RSRP measurements and cell re-selection priority information in SIBs or
RRC message from neighbour cells could be utilized for HeNB to adaptively
select its operating carrier frequency [8, 9].
The original purpose of cell-reselection priority information is for UE to
properly select its camping cell based on the frequency layer priority of each
carrier. For interference avoidance, this information can be utilized by HeNB
to appropriately select its operating frequency by decoding SIBs or RRC
message from its neighbour cells during normal operation or in self-
configuration mode. At the same time, HeNB should also measure co-channel or
adjacent channel RSRP of the neighbour cells to make a proper selection.
Furthermore, if the priority information of the neighbour cells is changed at
a certain time after the HeNB has already started up, the HeNB should
periodically update the priority information, measure the RSRP and adjust its
operating frequency (if necessary).
Figure 7.2.2.1-2 below depicts a scenario where the HeNB is overlaid by both
higher and lower priority frequency layers as shown for HeNB cell 1, and
another scenario where the HeNB is overlaid by only one frequency layer as
shown for HeNB cell 2.
For HeNB cell 1, when the measured RSRP of both higher and lower priority
frequency layers exceed a predefined set of thresholds which implies that it
is overlaid by more than one frequency layers, the HeNB should select its
operating frequency that is being used by the cell that has the lower priority
for interference mitigation. As illustrated in Figure 7.2.2.1-2, the HeNB cell
1 should select RF1 which is the lower priority carrier frequency. On the
other hand, if the HeNB is overlaid by only one priority carrier frequency as
shown for HeNB cell 2 in Figure 7.2.2.1-2, the HeNB should select a carrier
frequency that corresponds to the smaller measured RSRP. For example, the HeNB
cell 2 in Figure 7.2.2.1-2 should select RF2 which has smaller RSRP.

Figure 7.2.2.1-2 Examples of adaptive frequency selection scheme
The adaptive frequency selection scheme is applied most effectively to HeNBs
in non-allowed CSG mode for avoiding the interference. In the case when the
HeNB is operating in an open or hybrid access mode, it may also apply the
scheme for interference avoidance.
#### 7.2.2.2 Control of HeNB Downlink Interference among neighboring HeNBs
When powered on, a HeNB listens to neighboring HeNBs\' control channel and
reference signal transmissions, determines the cell ID of each neighboring
HeNB and measures the path loss from each of them. In addition, the HeNBs
could also use reports from UEs.
Based on this information, HeNBs could use fractional frequency reuse (FFR) to
orthogonalize the resources used and increase the overall performance of the
network.
##### 7.2.2.2.1 Centralized Coordination
The centralized coordinator can form an adjacency graph of all HeNBs based on
the reports from each HeNB.
Each HeNB estimates the fraction of time it needs to transmit according to the
traffic load and channel conditions of its UEs, and reports this ratio to the
centralized controller via S1 signaling.
• For mixed traffic with both delay sensitive traffic and delay tolerant
traffic, two ratios which correspond to both traffic types will be reported.
• Each HeNB needs to update its report when at least one of the following
event happens:
\- New traffic session initiation
\- UE channel condition variation over a pre-defined threshold
Given the adjacency graph and the reported ratios from each HeNB, the
centralized coordinator determines
Option 1: the subframes that each HeNB is allowed to transmit, and notifies
each HeNB of its transmission pattern via S1 signalling.
A HeNB needs to properly configure DRX parameters of its UEs according to the
transmission pattern notified by the centralized coordinator.
Option 2: the subbands or carrier frequency that each HeNB is allowed to
transmit, and notifies each HeNB of its transmission pattern via S1
signalling.
Note that the S1 signalling load between HeNBs and the centralized coordinator
could be large if the number of HeNB connections per coordinator is
significant. To reduce S1 signalling, it is preferable to limit the number of
HeNB reports to the centralized coordinator. For example, the centralized
coordinator can assign a HeNB a lot more resources than it actually needs, and
the HeNB will not send a report to the centralized controller unless it uses
up all the assigned resources. As HeNBs are generally lightly loaded, a HeNB
may rarely send a report if it is assigned a large fraction of resources (i.e.
sub-frames).
##### 7.2.2.2.2 Distributed Dynamic Frequency Partitioning
Based on the information collected, the HeNBs can construct a \"Jamming
Graph\" where each node denotes an active HeNB and an edge denotes jamming
condition between two HeNBs. A jamming condition is declared when the channel
gain difference between the interfering and serving links exceeds a certain
threshold. The distributed fractional frequency reuse planning problem is now
converted into a graph coloring problem, which could be solved in a
distributed manner at low complexity.
Examples of such algorithms and brief performance analysis are given in [13],
[16], [19] for both the FDD and TDD case.
This algorithm could be an adaptive algorithm in which resources are
negotiated and adaptively allocated for different nodes, based on a utility
function that enables nodes to quantify the benefit or loss due to each
resource coordination action [18]. These utility values can then be used at
each node to select the right resource coordination requests to be sent to
their neighbours, or to select the best requested coordination action from
among multiple received requests, and hence to grant/reject the requests based
on their quantified benefit to the network.
To support this adaptive algorithm, network nodes need to exchange information
such as subbands reuse updates and utility information. The performance
depends significantly on the latency of the messaging, especially in the case
of non-full buffer traffic. This information should be taken into account
while analyzing the different options for such information exchange (e.g. X2,
S1, over-the-air, over-the-air via UE).
#### 7.2.2.3 Control of HeNB Downlink Interference by dynamically changing
HeNB CSG ID
To mitigate HeNB interference as well as to prevent free HeNB usage by
neighbours, one option is to change the CSG ID of a closed access HeNB
dynamically between
• Its default CSG ID which is assigned when it is deployed and
• A dedicated CSG ID which is configured by the operator.
This dedicated CSG ID is included in the Operator CSG list [15] (clause 5.3.2
\"Closed Subscriber Group\") for every UE in the operator network. When the
closed access HeNB changes its CSG ID to the dedicated CSG ID, it actually
becomes accessible to each passing-by UE, thus alleviating its interference
towards the macro cell. Note that this scheme would only be beneficial when a
large fraction of UEs support CSG.
By dynamically changing the CSG IDs of closed access HeNBs in a coordinated
manner, it might be possible to ensure that the number of closed access HeNBs
using default CSG IDs under each macro cell does not go beyond a pre-defined
upper bound at any time instant.
\- A centralized controller (e.g. HeNB Gateway or HeNB management server) can
set the upper bound, and configures, for each HeNB, the time intervals it
supports the default CSG ID and the dedicated CSG ID, respectively. Then each
HeNB dynamically varies its CSG ID based on the configuration parameters
provided by the centralized controller.
\- Different macro cells may have different or common upper bounds.
\- Whenever a HeNB is deployed, the centralized controller can determine its
adjacent macro cell based on its location and configure the time intervals it
will employ the default CSG ID and the dedicated CSG ID, respectively.
\- The mechanisms of when and how to select a set of HeNBs is FFS. It may be
possible to carefully arrange time intervals to employ default CSG IDs for
different HeNBs to ensure that the number of closed access HeNBs using default
CSG IDs under every macro cell can be upper limited at any time instant.
\- E.g. some HeNBs may use default CSG IDs the first 30 minutes of every hour,
but others may not; alternatively, some HeNBs may use default CSG IDs 9AM-11PM
everyday, but others may do.
\- The upper bound can be determined by
\- Simulation/numerical analysis
\- HeNB subscription profile
> E.g. make HeNBs \"less open\" if the subscription rate is high and the
> subscribers desire to do so.
\- Macro cell load
\- E.g. make HeNBs \"more open\" when macro cell is heavy loaded, and \"less
open\" when macro cell is lightly loaded.
Further study of this proposals and comparison to alternatives (e.g. hybrid
cells) may be needed. In particular, the UE and core network impact of
dynamically changing the CSG ID is for further study by the relevant working
groups.
#### 7.2.2.4 Downlink interference management based on mapping between PCIs
and transmission patterns
Interference Management based on mapping between PCIs and transmission
patterns requires a centralized coordinator. The centralized coordinator
generates a number of transmission patterns and a function which maps
transmission patterns to PCIs, and then sends to all cells the information of
transmission patterns and the mapping function. The essentials of this scheme
are as follows:
\- When powered on, a HeNB will listen to neighbouring cell transmissions,
determine the Cell ID of these neighbouring HeNBs, and report them to the
centralized coordinator.
\- The centralized coordinator can form an adjacency graph of all HeNBs based
on the reports from each HeNB as well as its UEs.
\- Given the adjacency graph, the centralized coordinator determines the
followings semi-statically:
> a set of transmission patterns; A pattern shows a profile of maximum Tx
> power for each PRB or group of PRBs
>
> a function which maps transmission patterns to PCIs
\- The centralized coordinator notifies to HeNBs and MeNBs of the followings
via S1 signaling.
> the set of transmission patterns
>
> the function which maps transmission patterns to PCIs
\- This notification makes it possible that all cells share the information of
the transmission patterns and the mapping between the patterns and PCIs.
\- HeNB should use PRBs according to the transmission pattern corresponding to
its PCI.
Downlink interference management can be done as follows:
If a UE connected to a serving (H)eNB is close to a neighbouring HeNB, the
downlink of the UE can be severely degraded due to high interference from the
neighbouring HeNB. The serving (H)eNB can be macro eNB or HeNB. The UE detects
the PCI and measures the RSRP of the neighbouring HeNB, and reports these to
the serving (H)eNB. Because of the sharing of the information of the
transmission patterns and the mapping between these patterns and PCI, the
serving (H)eNB knows the transmission pattern of the neighbouring HeNB that
the UE is close to. This makes it possible for the serving (H)eNB to allocate
downlink resource such that the UE is not severely interfered by the
neighbouring HeNB on its downlink.
#### 7.2.2.5 Techniques for Dynamic Frequency Partitioning
Interference in HeNB network interference can be mitigated through fractional
frequency reuse (FFR) by orthogonalizing dominant interferers. Compared to a
simple carrier-reuse, a frequency reuse that can be tailored to each user
offers an increase in capacity and better flexibility. LTE supports subband
FFR via subband CQI reporting, which allows a scheduler to schedule users
based on the subband CQI reporting that reflects different interference levels
on different subbands. In a 10 MHz system with 6 RBs/subband, there are 8
regular subbands and one short subband that could be used to implement
fractional frequency reuse.
A distributed FFR algorithm is designed to cope with non-operator deployed
networks, such as HeNBs. Each HeNB could construct an RF neighbour list
through network listening and user reporting. In this method, the local RF
neighbour information is called a \"Jamming Graph\", where each node denotes
an active HeNB and an edge denotes jamming condition between two HeNBs. A
jamming condition is declared when the channel gain difference between the
interfering and serving links exceeds certain threshold. The distributed FFR
planning problem is now converted into a graph coloring problem, which could
be solved in a distributed manner at low complexity.
An example of such an algorithm and a brief performance analysis is given next
[16], [17].
The link level performance is based on single user 2x2 MIMO with channel and
interference estimation loss. Link adaptation and HARQ are modelled and the
baseline performance has been calibrated with NGMN Rel. 8 performance for D1
scenario. Typical LTE system parameters are used resulting in a total system
overhead close to 41%.
Other parameters are given in Table 7.2.3.1.
Table 7.2.3.1 Simulation parameters
Parameter Value
* * *
HeNB Tx Power 10dBm Path loss 127+30log10(R/1000) Shadowing standard deviation
10dB Deployment model 5x5 Grid Model
Three interference management schemes have been compared: Rel 8 with frequency
reuse 1; distributed FFR with medium level of interference orthogonalizaton;
distributed FFR with high level of interference orthogonalization. The level
of orthogonalization is controlled by tuning the jamming graph threshold,
i.e., the channel gain difference between interfering and serving link. In
this simulation, 0 dB and -6 dB thresholds have been studied. The decoding C/I
and mobile throughput statistics are shown in Fig. 7.2.3.1 for 20% penetration
rate with full buffer traffic. It can be seen that distributed FFR schemes
eliminate system outage and significantly improve the system fairness. Similar
results are obtained for different penetration rates [16].

The performance of this scheme was also analyzed for a mixed traffic model
[17]. A mix of delay sensitive (QoS) flows and full-buffer flows was
considered. Each UE has only one flow which is either delay-sensitive or full-
buffer. For full-buffer flows, the user performance is dependent on the
average rate. In particular, we assume a log utility function (corresponding
to proportional fair) for full-buffer flows. The delay CDF for QoS flows and
the rate CDF for full-buffer flows are plotted in Fig. 7.2.3.2. In this case
reuse one is compared to a FFR scheme based on spatial feedback information
(SFI) with different delays. SFI genie shows an upper bound on the performance
of the large delay SFI case. These results show that FFR can significantly
improve system efficiency and ensures fairness with mixed traffic also [17].
Figure 7.2.3.2 Delay and data rate CDF for mixed traffic with 50% penetration
A further refinement of this algorithm is an adaptive algorithm in which
resources are negotiated and adaptively allocated for different nodes, based
on a utility function that enables nodes to quantify the benefit or loss due
to each resource coordination action [18]. These utility values can then be
used at each node to select the right resource coordination requests to be
sent to their neighbours, or to select the best requested coordination action
from among multiple received requests, and hence to grant/reject the requests
based on their quantified benefit to the network. The utility function can be
selected in accordance with the scheduler metric used at different nodes, in
which case it will enable a distributed enforcement of network-wide fairness.
This scheduling metric can be considered as the marginal utility function,
i.e., the derivative of a utility function that the frame-by-frame scheduler
attempts to iteratively maximize. One example of such utility function is $U =
\sum_{i}^{}{U_{i}(R_{i})} = \sum_{i}^{}{\log(R_{i})}$, where _R~i~_ is the
long-term or average throughput of user _i_. This corresponds to the well-
known proportionally fair scheduler, with the scheduling metric of $dU =
\sum_{i}^{}{U^{'}\left( R_{i} \right)\text{dR}_{i}} \approx
\sum_{i}^{}\frac{r_{i}}{R_{i}}$ where _r~i~_ is the instantaneous rate of user
_i_. To enforce network-wide fairness, the above utility function can be
extended to the entire network and defined as the sum of utilities of all
individual users in the network. This utility-based resource coordination
algorithm aims at adaptively determining the network-wide utility-maximizing
resource allocation set for any given channel and interference conditions.
Note that, with this approach, resource usage does not need to be a binary
decision of either using the resource at full/nominal PSD or not using it at
all, and can instead be a soft decision, or at least a selection from a set of
multiple possible PSD values.
A brief performance evaluation of this scheme is shown in Fig. 7.2.3.3. The
simulation parameters are the same as for the previous results. A total of
four resources are defined over the entire band and the allowed PSDs on
different resources are obtained by multiplying the scaling factors from the
following sets; two levels: {0, 1}, three levels: {0, 0.1, 1}. These results
show that substantial gains in tail and average throughput can be achieved,
translating into improved network-wide fairness. Although not shown here,
similar results are obtained for different penetration rates [18].

coordination with 50% penetration
##### 7.2.2.5.1 Support for dynamic FFR
The above results demonstrate the benefits of frequency reuse (and resource
reuse in general) based on information exchange between eNBs. Furthermore,
utility information exchange can enable network-wide fairness, which ensures
that the maximum number of users can benefit from HeNB deployments. To support
the adaptive algorithm introduced above, network nodes need to exchange
information such as subbands reuse updates [19] and utility information [18].
It was also shown that the performance depends significantly on the latency of
the messaging, especially in the case of non-full buffer traffic. This
information should be taken into account while analyzing the different options
for such information exchange (e.g. X2, S1, over-the-air, over-the-air via
UE).
#### 7.2.2.6 Victim UE Aware Downlink Interference Management
For closed access HeNBs, protection of the downlinks of other cells is an
important consideration and can be done on the basis of managing the usage of
power and/or resource blocks. This may restrict the operation of the HeNB such
that the HeNB performance may be degraded. To avoid restricting the HeNBs
unnecessarily, it could be useful to detect whether there are victim UEs in
the vicinity of the HeNB. If so then full protection could be provided. If not
then a reduced level of protection can be provided.
Two basic approaches to determining whether there are victim UEs in the
vicinity of a HeNB are:
A) Determination at the macro or HeNB on the basis of reported UE
measurements.
B) Determination at the HeNB on the basis of detection of uplink transmissions
from victim UEs.
##### 7.2.2.6.1 Determination based on reported UE measurements
There are multiple approaches to use UE DL measurements. In one case, the
macro could share the information in a standardized interface (e.g. X2, S1 in
future releases) or over a non-standardized interface in Rel 9\. In another
scenario, the HeNB could be a hybrid HeNB that knows it is the strongest cell
and hence a dominant interferer either when the UE accesses it, or when the
macro attempts to handover its UE to the HeNB. No new signaling is needed to
support the latter.
##### 7.2.2.6.2 Determination based on detected uplink transmissions
Active mode victim UEs in the vicinity of a HeNB will be transmitting data
and/or control information on the uplink (using PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS and PRACH)
and these uplink transmissions may be detected by the HeNB. In the case of
interference management by controlling HeNB downlink power, such an approach
has the potential to provide the same level of protection to the macro UEs,
while improving HeNB performance when there are no victim UEs nearby.
The victim UEs will be most vulnerable when they are at or near the edge of
their own cells and relatively close to the HeNB. In this case the victim UEs
will likely be transmitting with a relatively high power and the pathloss to
the HeNB will be relatively low. Therefore the SINR of the received reference
signals at the HeNB for the most vulnerable UEs is likely to be high, and the
detection at the HeNB will be reliable. In [29] it was shown that the SINR
would typically be well in excess of 20dB
Two approaches for the detection of uplink transmissions can be considered.
These are:
**_Detection based on IoT_**
If there are one or more victim UEs in the vicinity of the HeNB, then the IoT
will be high. If the uplink transmission from the victim UE(s) only occupies a
portion of the frequency or time resource, then the resulting IoT variations
in time and/or frequency may be used to distinguish the case of a small number
of such UEs close to the HeNB from the case of a higher number of MUEs further
away.
**_Detection of UL RS_**
In order to better detect if there is a nearby UE requiring protection on the
downlink, the properties of the uplink reference signals can be used. The
reference signals have markedly different characteristics to the data bearing
signals or to noise. The differences are exhibited in the frequency domain
(and equivalently autocorrelation function), and time domain (e.g. peak to
average ratio) [29]. This applies to reference signals used for PRACH, SRS and
demodulation reference signals. Note however that in future releases including
LTE-A, for which clustered SC-FDMA and NxSC-FDMA have been agreed, the
reference signal properties may change and it is possible that a HeNB may fail
to detect a LTE-A macro UE (e.g. because it has higher PAPR)
**_Combined Scheme_**
The two approaches above may be combined e.g. such a scheme could operate as
follows:
\- If IoT on all RBs in a subframe is below a threshold assume no protection
is required
\- If IoT is above a threshold (in any RB) trigger a set of RS detection
attempts. If a RS detection attempt is made when the IoT is high and no MUE is
detected, assume protection is not required, otherwise assume detection is
required. Note that such detection would require the HeNB to not schedule its
own HUEs in some subframes.
For this kind of scheme it is important to consider the false alarm and missed
detection probabilities, taking into account the case where the uplink
transmissions from victim MUEs are intermittent, the duration for which
protection is provided in response to a detection (or false alarm), and the
need to only provide protection when there are MUEs nearby to the HeNB (rather
than a higher number of further away UEs). The performance of the detection
schemes depends on the environment and the number of UEs nearby, their
relative powers and channel fades. System-level investigation of the benefit
of the combined IoT + RS/PAPR scheme in such a scenario is for further study.
##### 7.2.2.6.3 Protection of idle mode UEs
For both approaches A and B defined above, if the HeNB is closed (CSG), an
issue arises as to how to protect idle mode UEs. In the case of approach A,
such UEs will not be reporting measurements to the macro eNBs. For approach B,
idle mode UEs will not be transmitting in the uplink and therefore there is no
opportunity to detect them at the HeNB.
The same methods used to protect macro eNB downlink control channels (PBCH,
SCH, PCFICH, PDCCH, PHICH) from HeNBs can also be used to protect these
channels for idle mode UEs when employing the victim aware protection schemes.
These methods rely on introducing orthogonality in the time or frequency
dimension between HeNB transmissions and the eNB control channel
transmissions. Furthermore similar approaches could be used for the protection
of paging and system information messages. For example the same (e.g. 1 or 2)
DL RBs could always be used to send paging and system information mapped to
PDSCH from on the macro eNB, and these could always be protected by the HeNB.
The RBs to protect at the HeNB could, for example, be configured via S1
signalling or OAM. However, some of these schemes may require UE changes and
hence are not applicable to Rel 8/9 UEs. Depending on the schemes employed a
closed HeNB may therefore have to always reduce its power if wants to protect
idle mode macro UEs.
Alternatively if paging-only Hybrid cell is supported, then protection during
idle mode is not an issue. In this case while a HeNB can infer the presence of
a victim UE which has recently become active immediately after hand-out from
the HeNB, detection of the active mode UE is still desirable in order to
determine when protection on the downlink is no longer required (due to the
victim UE moving away from the HeNB). This could be used as an alternative to
the options in 7.2.2.6.1.
### 7.2.3 Power Control
#### 7.2.3.1 HeNB power control based on HUE measurement
Home eNB (HeNB) typically sets its own transmit power by measuring surrounding
RF conditions of macro cells to mitigate interference to macro UE (MUE) and
maintain good HeNB indoor coverage for the Home UEs (HUE). However, there may
be a significant difference between the RF conditions measured by the HeNB and
those experienced by the MUEs or HUEs. Even in an indoor environment, the HeNB
and the HUEs may measure significantly different RF conditions in some cases
such as between different rooms, or between different floors. It is difficult
to solve this difference with NLM only. The NLM during operation may be a big
burden on the HeNB.
An example where there is a significant difference between the RF conditions
measured by HeNB and HUEs is shown in Figure 7.2.3.1-1. In the left figure,
the scenario where a HeNB and a HUE is located at edge and center of a house
respectively and a MUE is located at the close proximity of the house is
depicted. The edge and the center of the house assume to be isolated by an
internal wall. In this case the HeNB transmit power is set to a relatively
higher value because the signal level from MeNB (RSRP) is relatively high. As
a result the interference to the MUE will significantly increase and the HeNB
indoor coverage is unnecessarily widened. On the other hand, in the right
figure, the scenario where a HeNB and a HUE is located at center and edge of a
house respectively and a MUE is located at the close proximity of the house is
depicted. In this case the HeNB transmit power is set to a relatively lower
value because the signal level from MeNB is relatively low. As a result the
HeNB indoor coverage is significantly narrowed while the interference to the
MUE will decrease. In these scenarios it is necessary for the HeNB to consider
measurement results of HUEs in order to set transmit power appropriately.
{width="6.135416666666667in" height="1.6770833333333333in"}
Figure 7.2.3.1-1 Scenarios where HeNB transmit power are not appropriately
set.
In order to improve the above described problems, it can be beneficial to
utilize HUE measurements (or measurement statistics) to optimize the HeNB
transmit power after the initial start up. This is particularly useful in co-
channel deployments and can provide better protection for MUEs while
maintaining good HeNB coverage for the HUEs. Furthermore, by utilizing HUE
measurement reports, the burden on HeNB transmit power control solely based on
NLM can be avoided.
HeNB should initially set transmit power of reference signal or maximum
downlink transmit power based on measurements of RF conditions of macro cells
such as RSRP. Then HUE should measure quality level of the reference signal
from the HeNB such as RSRP or RSRQ and report this value to the HeNB via
measurement reporting. Based on the measurement results, the HeNB should
optimize the transmit power so that the subsequent reported measurement values
are close to a predetermined or network notified target value. If multiple
HUEs are connected to the HeNB, the minimum value of the reported measurement
results from each HUE should become close to the target value. The measurement
result may be measurement statistics such as x-percentile value.
As shown in [10], the above scheme can improve the problem shown in Figure
7.2.3.1-1. In the left figure the HeNB will decrease the transmit power and
the interference to the MUE will be mitigated because the HUE measurement
result shows good quality and it is preferable to decrease the transmit power.
In the right figure the HeNB will increase the transmit power and the indoor
coverage will be widened because the HUE measurement result shows poor quality
and it is preferable to increase the transmit power.
#### 7.2.3.2 Smart power control based on interference measurement from macro
BS
In the absence of alternative techniques such as resource partitioning, a
fixed maximum power setting configured by the network is not sufficient to
ensure minimum HeNB coverage range while protecting macro in all cases. Hence,
a sensing of the HeNB environment can be used for setting the transmit power.
The HeNB adjust its maximum DL transmit power as a function of air interface
measurements to avoid interfering with macro cell UEs. Examples of such
measurements are total received interference, received CRS Êc from the most
dominant macro cell eNB, etc. The scheme is open loop, and does not involve
the UEs and signaling between network nodes.
The HeNB shall adjust its maximum transmit power according to the following
formula,
(1)
where parameters P~max~ and P~min~ is the maximum and minimum HeNB transmit
power settings, CRS Êc is measured in dBm, which is the Reference Signal
Received Power per resource element present at the Home BS antenna connector
received from the strongest co-channel macro cell. is the number of downlink
resource blocks in the HeNB channel. is the number of subcarriers in a
resource block (). Parameter α is a linear scalar that allows altering the
slope of power control mapping curve, β is a parameter expressed in dB that
can be used for altering the exact range of CRS Êc covered by dynamic range of
power control.
Parameters P~min\ ,~ α, and β are considered to be HeNB configuration
parameters, and P~max~ corresponds to the HeNBs maximum transmit power
capability.
For the special case where the HeNB is unable to detect any co-channel
deployed macro cells. The HeNB is free to use its maximum transmit power, or
apply pre-set parameterized value based on the requirement of operator.
#### 7.2.3.3 HeNB power control based on HeNB-MUE path loss
HeNB should adjust the downlink transmit power by taking into account the path
loss between the HeNB and an outdoor neighbor MUE including penetration loss
in order to provide better interference mitigation for the MUE while
maintaining good HeNB coverage for HUEs.
HeNB should set the transmit power of reference signal P_tx as follows:
P_tx (dBm) = MEDIAN( P_m + P_offset, P_tx_upp, P_tx_low )
Where:
\- P_m (dBm) is RSRP from the nearest MeNB measured by the HeNB. P_m is
dependent on path loss which includes the penetration loss between the nearest
MeNB and the HeNB.
\- P_offset (dB) is the power offset described below in detail.
\- P_tx_upp/P_tx_low (dBm) is the upper/lower limit value for the transmit
power of the reference signal. The maximum and the minimum total transmit
power of HeNB should follow HNB in [20].
The HeNB can also set the maximum downlink transmit power in proportion to the
transmit power of the reference signal. As the RSRP decreases, which means the
HeNB is located close to the edge of the macro cell, the transmit power should
be small in order to mitigate the downlink interference to the MUE.
P_offset above should be defined based on path loss between the HeNB and the
MUE. The path loss may consist of indoor path loss between the HeNB and cell
edge of HeNB cell and the penetration loss. Therefore, P_offset should be
formulated as follows:
P_offset = MEDIAN( P_offset_o + K*LE, P_offset_max, P_offset_min )
Where:
\- P_offset_o (dB) is a predetermined power offset value corresponding to the
indoor path loss. Typical value range between 50 and 100dB, and can be
determined by the averaged measurement value.
\- K is an adjustable positive factor can be determined by the priority of
HeNB operation. This value should be high to increase the total transmit power
(MeNB is more acceptable to higher interference) and low to reduce the
interference to MeNB operation.
\- LE (dB) is estimated penetration loss as below.
\- P_offset_max/P_offset_min (dB) is the maximum/minimum value of the P_offset
by which the estimated and calculated P_offset can be prevented from being too
large or too small. This value is dependent of the actual wall penetration
loss plus P_offset_o. And the typical wall penetration loss ranges between 10
and 30dB.
If the path loss between the HeNB and the MUE can be estimated, then the
transmit power of the HeNB should be set accordingly.
The path loss between the HeNB and the MUE should be estimated based on the
difference between the estimated UL transmit power and the UL reception power
(as the Received Interference Power) of the MUE. The estimated UL transmit
power is based on the assumption that UL power control is applied for both MUE
and HeNB as a UE. Then the UL transmit power can be calculated by the DL
propagation loss from the surrounding MeNB to the HeNB utilizing the RSRP
measurement.
#### 7.2.3.4 GPS Based HeNB Maximum Output Adjustment
GPS is used to locate the geographical position of the user for more than a
decade. Among other positioning methods, the assisted GPS (A-GPS) is
considered to be one of the most viable and commonly used methods. It is
tailored to work with a user terminal (UE) and thus enables UE subscribers to
relatively accurately determine their location, time, and even velocity
(including direction) in open area environment provided sufficient number of
satellites are visible. A HeNB can incorporate a GPS or A-GPS receiver similar
to the one used in the UE for location services.
##### 7.2.3.4.1 Maximum Output Power Adjustment based on GPS Detection
Performance
The GPS receiver in HeNB is used to set the maximum output power of the HeNB.
Two type of information can be exploited from the GPS receiver, namely the
number of detected satellites () and the reception quality () of the detected
satellites. In a normal environment, at least 4-5 satellites should be visible
with sufficient quality to obtain good accuracy of the geographical location.
Furthermore, the reception quality can be an aggregate value of all the
detected satellites e.g. weighted average of all detected satellites or
certain number of strongest satellites. Herein, we refer and/or as GPS
detection performance. Other examples of the reception quality can be the
reception signal level, duration for determining the HeNB location, and
accuracy of the detected location.
Depending upon the GPS detection performance, the maximum output power of HeNB
can be set according to different mapping functions as shown below.
(1) Mapping the number of detected satellites to the maximum output power of
the HeNB (Pmax_HeNB):
, **(1)**
(2) Mapping the reception quality to the maximum output power of the HeNB
(Pmax_HeNB):
, (2)
(3) Mapping the number of detected satellites and the reception quality to the
maximum output power of the HeNB (Pmax_HeNB):
, (3)
where and are the weighting factors. Any suitable mapping function such as
weighted sum or average can be used. The above mapping functions are used to
create lookup tables with multiple maximum output power levels for HeNB.
A poor GPS detection performance corresponds to a scenario where HeNB is
isolated and shielded from outside base stations. This means less interference
is generated by the HeNB to the outside Macro UE. Therefore higher maximum
output power can be used in order to extend the HeNB coverage within the
building. On the other hand, a good GPS detection performance indicates that
the location of the HeNB may cause significant interference to the outside and
therefore lower maximum output power should be used at HeNB in order to
protect the Macro UE.
Effectively, GPS detection performance estimates to what degree the HeNB and
outside base stations are isolated. The cause of the isolation in most cases
is building penetration loss. Therefore one possible function of adjusting the
maximum output power should be based on the estimated penetration loss, which
can be obtained by the difference between an indoor measured GPS detection
performance and a typical value that corresponds to an outdoor measured one.
##### 7.2.3.4.2 GPS Detection Performance Combined with Macro eNB Measurements
The GPS based approach can also be combined with Macro eNB measurements in
order to further adjust the maximum output power at HeNB. In this case, the
HeNB measures the surrounding radio environment and detect the signal level of
Macro eNB. This information, together with GPS detection performance, are used
to adjust the maximum output power of HeNB.
## 7.3 Control of HeNB Uplink Interference
### 7.3.1 Control Channel Protection
#### 7.3.1.1 HeNB Uplink Control Channel Protection
In the uplink, physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) interference from
\- HUE (aggressor) to macro-eNB (victim),
\- MUE (aggressor) to HeNB (victim), and
\- HUE (aggressor) to HeNB (victim)
can be mitigated by enabling orthogonal transmissions. Uplink control
signaling (PUCCH, CQI) reliability can be maintained for both HeNBs and macro-
eNBs by making use of PUCCH offsets for enabling orthogonal PUCCH assignments
between the HeNB and macro-eNB users. For PUCCH transmissions, over-
provisioning can be made use of to ensure orthogonality of control channels
between a HeNB UE and a macro-eNB UE as shown in Figure 7.3.3.1. It is
possible to employ this method for Release-8 UEs without changing the physical
layer design or RAN2 signaling.
{width="1.8125in" height="3.3541666666666665in"}
Figure 7.3.1.1 UL control interference mitigation by PUCCH orthogonalization
#### 7.3.1.2 Signaling offset over the backhaul
It would be desirable for the macro-eNB to signal an offset to all HeNBs
within its coverage area in order that transmissions from UEs connected to
HeNBs do not cause interference at the macro-eNB receiver (e.g., a HeNB
deployed in close range of a macro-eNB). Conversely, a macro-eNB UE that is at
the cell edge and therefore transmitting close to its maximum transmit power
can interfere severely with a HeNB UE and the signaled offset can be made use
of to mitigate interference. Alternately, a HeNB gateway can signal over S1,
the offsets that each HeNB should use, thus providing the capability of
configuring orthogonal PUCCH transmissions in neighboring HeNBs thereby
avoiding HeNB (aggressor) to HeNB (victim) interference on the uplink.
One option for the HeNBs is to not allocate PUCCH resources on edge RBs as
shown in Fig. 7.3.3.1 using over-provisioning. A typical macro-eNB deployment
is likely to have PUCCH transmission on the band-edges to maximize the number
of contiguous RBs that can be allocated to PUSCH. However, unlike macro-eNBs,
utilizing the full uplink bandwidth may not be critical for HeNBs as they
serve only a few users at a time. Therefore, the PUCCH resources in HeNBs can
be \"pulled\" inward. The edge RBs not used by the HeNBs can be used by the
macro-eNB for PUCCH for its UEs. Also, the macro-eNB, being aware of the RBs
used by HeNBs in its coverage area, can schedule some users (e.g. UEs close to
the macro and not near any HeNB) on RBs that overlap with HeNB UE PUCCH
region. This results in reduced interference from macro-eNB UEs to HeNB UE
PUCCH.
### 7.3.2 Power Control
#### 7.3.2.1 Smart Power Control based on Path Loss to Worst Victim Macro
eNodeB
Interference from the Home UE (HUE) to the Macro eNodeB (MeNB) is particularly
significant if the HUE is located close to the MeNB. On the other hand, an
indoor HUE near its serving HeNB and far from the MeNB may be harmless. As
pointed out in [20], the HUE transmission power should be controlled based on
path loss (PL) from the HUE to its worst victim MeNB (i.e. nearest neighbour
MeNB).
The PL from HUE to MeNB can be estimated from HUE measurements of Reference
Signal Received Power (RSRP) and MeNB Reference Signal (RS) Transmission (Tx)
power. HeNB might know MeNB RS Tx power by means of decoding the variable
\"referenceSignalPower\" in System Information Block Type2 (SIB2) message
broadcasted from MeNB [21]. In FDD mode, the estimated downlink PL might be
used for an approximation of uplink PL.
During this work item, such smart power control methods are proposed and their
performance gain is investigated [22][23]. The methods are as follows.
##### **7.3.2.1.1** Power Cap Method
In this method, the maximum transmission power density (i.e. power cap) of HUE
is restricted based on the interference rise at MeNB. The power cap is
calculated as the function of PL from the HUE to its worst victim MeNB. The
HUE is power-controlled based on PL to its serving HeNB, up to the level of
the power cap.
Simulation results have been generated for an urban deployment model with
varying HeNB density and for either full buffer or bursty traffic. The results
are assume a fixed power cap of either 0.2 dB (labelled \"tight\") or 7 dB
(labelled \"loose\", and it should be noted that this is a very loose cap, for
which in practice the home UE power will likely be set considering coverage
requirements of the HeNB alone rather than also considering interference to
the macro layer).
##### 7.3.2.1.1.1 Simulation Assumptions {#simulation-assumptions .H6}
The simulation parameters largely follow the assumption in [24], [25] with the
following specific parameters

##### 7.3.2.1.1.2 Simulation Results {#simulation-results .H6}
Figure 7.3.2.1.1.2-1 below shows the average macrocell sector throughput as a
function of the probability that there is an active HeNB in an apartment.
Results are shown for two values of the target maximum \"noise rise\" that the
home UE should generate at the macro eNB (\"tight\" and \"loose\"). It can be
seen that with a low density of active HeNBs the \"loose\" approach provides
adequate protection whereas at higher densities the \"tight\" cap is
appropriate. This goes for both the full buffer and the bursty traffic models.

##### 7.3.2.1.1.3 Discussion of Results {#discussion-of-results .H6}
For low densities of HeNB a \"loose\" power cap is sufficient which allows
higher HeNB throughputs than the \"tight\" power cap which is required for
higher HeNB densities.
##### **7.3.2.1.2 Power Control** based on PL from HUE to its serving HeNB and
PL from HUE to its worst victim MeNB
The UE specific term of the transmission power density should be defined as
the function of PL from HUE to its serving HeNB () and PL from HUE to its
worst victim MeNB () because the uplink transmission power is explicitly
defined as the form using PL from UE to its serving eNodeB in the current
specification [26]. For example, the power control where the UE specific term
of is set to (in dB) corresponds to the power cap method (The term is
cancelled by path loss compensation term and the parameter is path loss
compensation coefficient [9]). In general, the UE specific term of might be
non-decreasing function of and the dependency of is implementation issue.
One realization of such power control is proposed during this work item; PL
difference based power control. In this method, the UE specific term of is
defined as the non-decreasing function of PL difference (in dB). The explicit
form of the UE specific term of is shown in [23].
##### 7.3.2.1.2.1 Simulation Assumptions {#simulation-assumptions-1 .H6}

##### 7.3.2.1.2.2 Simulation Results {#simulation-results-1 .H6}
Figures 7.3.2.1.2.2-1 and 7.3.2.1.2.2-2 show the MUE and HUE throughputs for
various HeNB densities, which is the number of HeNB per macro sector. The
power control based on PL difference (PL-diff.) and conventional fractional
power control (FPC) (set 2 of [25]) are compared. These results are appeared
in [23].
Figure 7.3.2.1.2.2-1 indicates that the PL difference based power control
mitigates the degradation of MUE throughput than FPC. Figure 7.3.2.1.2.2-2
(right) shows the PL difference based power control can keep the HUE average
throughput at the same level of FPC. Its cost is the degradation of HUE 5
percentile throughput as shown in Fig. 7.3.2.1.2.2-2 (left). In the suburban
model with 10 % outdoor HUE, the HUE that is correspond to HUE 5 percentile
throughput is mainly located outdoors.

The power control based on PL difference can mitigate the degradation of MUE
throughput. Its cost is the degradation of HUE 5 percentile throughput which
is mainly correspond to outdoor HUE.
##### 7.3.2.1.3 For Future Releases
The above smart power controls require no interference coordination between
eNodeBs. As the result, it might be difficult to manage the interference from
HUE as HeNB density increases. For future releases (LTE Release 10 or LTE-
Advanced), the adaptive power control by means of X2 or S1 signaling between
MeNB and HeNB or between HeNBs should be investigated (e.g. to take account of
the density of active femtocells within a macrocell coverage area). Notice
that during this work item, the adaptive power controls are proposed and their
performance gain is investigated [22][27].
## 7.4 HeNB Self-configuration
### 7.4.1 Information Exchange between eNBs and HeNBs
The provision of information exchange between eNBs ↔ HeNBs and HeNBs ↔ HeNBs
has potential benefits in allowing HeNBs to take account of uplink and
downlink conditions at nearby eNBs and HeNBs when configuring power and/or
resource blocks to use in uplink and downlink.
We consider several relevant metrics to compare these approaches:
(1) Latency: It was recognized in several contributions that a reliable low
latency scheme is desirable for interference management. In [11] it was
discussed that the adaptation of HeNB parameters could be relatively slow,
such that changes in interference/loading at eNB are not tracked on a sub-
frame by sub-frame, or frame by frame, basis, but rather more slowly as the
traffic load varies on the eNB. Simulation results in [4] showed that with
50ms latency such relatively slow adaptation still offers significant
performance benefits. Similarly simulation results in [12] also showed
significant performance benefits at comparable latencies. Further benefits can
be obtained by faster interference coordination [13], especially in the case
of bursty traffic.
(2) Scalability and Complexity: It is desirable to have the network complexity
scale in a manageable manner with increasing number of HeNBs, UEs etc.
Furthermore, different approaches are expected to have different
implementation impacts at different network entities (eNB, MME etc.).
(3) Overhead: The signaling overhead for exchanging interference management
messages (for both the backhaul and Over-the-Air methods discussed
subsequently) should be small.
Possible approaches for performing the information exchange are illustrated in
Figure 7.4.X-1 and their potential benefits and drawbacks are described in the
following. Flexible operations should be allowed to choose one or combination
of information exchange approaches in HeNB deployment.
{width="5.46875in" height="2.3333333333333335in"}
Figure 7.4.X-1: Illustration of information exchange for Over-the-Air and
Network based approaches
**_Option1. Over-the-air information, direct eNB to HeNB_**
Potential benefits of this approach include:
• No impact to network load.
• Low latency for information signalled from eNB to HeNBs.
• Predictable timeline (independent of backhaul conditions), can be used for
coordinated scheduling/transmission.
While this approach may offer low latency, there are several drawbacks:
• The eNB may not always be visible from the HeNB, even though there are
victims requiring protection.
• For some advanced approaches for managing interference, it may be desirable
to send different information to different groups of eNBs or HeNBs. An over
the air broadcast would preclude such operation.
• The downlink would need to be interrupted whenever information is read over
the air.
• Requires changes to eNB implementation
**_Option2. Over-the-air information, (H)eNB to HeNB via UE_**
For the DL: a victim UE forwards interference coordination related information
to the aggressor HeNB.
For the UL: An aggressor UE forwards interference coordination related
information from the victim (H)eNB to its serving (H)eNB.
Potential benefits of this approach:
• The downlink would not need to be interrupted to receive information over
the air.
• Lower latency compared to backhaul solutions (i.e. Option3 and 4) (higher
latency relative to Option 1).
• Predictable timeline (independent of backhaul conditions), can be used for
coordinated scheduling/transmission.
• Different information can be sent to different HeNBs
Potential drawbacks to this approach:
• Rel8 UEs can\'t be used to relay the messages.
• Requires changes to (H)eNB implementation
• Can increase the number of UEs that need to be handled by the HeNB.
**_Option3. X2 based interface between eNB and HeNB, and between HeNBs_**
The potential benefits of this approach:
• Higher accuracy of information received at destination than the Over-the-Air
approach
• Different information can be sent to different groups of eNBs or HeNBs
The potential drawbacks of this approach:
• The eNB may have large numbers of HeNBs within its coverage area which
potentially means the macro would need to deal with many messages to/from
HeNBs. Ways in which this could be mitigated could be considered by the
relevant working groups for further study e.g. X2 could be between macro eNBs
and HeNBs via HeNB gateways only, with the HeNB gateways performing a
distribution/aggregation function towards the HeNBs. To reduce the complexity
further the set of supported X2AP procedures could be limited, e.g. no
handover over X2, and only sending Load Indication (OI, HII, RNTP) in the
direction macro eNB to HeNB.
• Potentially large latency.
**_Option4. S1 based interface between eNB and HeNB, and between HeNBs_**
In some cases it is likely that direct physical links would not exist between
(H)eNBs and HeNBs, and as such X2 would be a logical interface sharing a
similar physical path to S1. With this in mind it could be argued that the
information exchange could be made over S1 instead of X2. If compared to the
X2 based approach there are some potential benefits to this approach:
> • Higher accuracy of information received at destination than the Over-the-
> Air approach
>
> • Different information can be sent to different groups of eNBs or HeNBs
>
> • S1 signalling interface already exist in the current specifications
Potential drawbacks of this approach:
• Increased functionality and processing load at the MME.
• Increased latency
• Lack of alignment between eNB↔eNB, eNB↔HeNB and HeNB↔HeNB SON/interference
management.
• Potential lack of alignment with likely future evolutions of interference
management in Release 10 and beyond (assuming that these are less likely to be
based on S1)
## 7.5 Hybrid Cells
Hybrid cells are being included in the 3GPP release 9 specifications. Hybrid
HeNBs may provide different service levels to UEs that are members of the HeNB
and non-member UEs. In [5], extensive deployment scenarios of hybrid cells
have been discussed. The interference scenarios apply to most of the
deployments listed in [5].
For the scenario where HeNBs are on a shared carrier with eNBs, the
interference management considerations are different between closed and hybrid
access modes. For the closed access mode the used HeNB resources (e.g. power,
RBs) are selected as a trade-off between performance at the HeNB/HUEs and
interference caused to the macro eNB/MUEs. For the hybrid access mode the
trade-off is between overall system performance (including both macro eNB and
HeNB layers), and resources consumed at the HeNB by \"visiting\" (i.e. non-CSG
member) UEs. These aspects are considered in more detail in the following sub-
sections.
### 7.5.1 Hybrid Access Level of Service
Hybrid HeNB may provide different service levels to UEs that are members of
the HeNB and non-member UEs. The lowest level of services is paging service,
where a hybrid cell allows a non-member UE to access the cell to receive
pages. A paging only hybrid cell is an interesting alternative to pure CSG
cells. Since CSG cells have separate PCID space, switching between CSG and
hybrid mode would have impact on both idle state and connected state home UEs.
On the contrary, a hybrid cell could with paging-only service provides similar
functionality as a CSG cell without incurring CSG-hybrid switching penalty.
If a hybrid cell only provides paging services to non-member UEs, data channel
interference is similar to CSG HeNBs. The difference is that the hybrid cell
has more information about the victim UE than a CSG cell. When the hybrid cell
decides to handover (HO) the UE to a macro cell, interference coordination
could be negotiated with the macro as part of the HO procedure. Some examples,
are:
1\. DL interference: The hybrid cell could reduce transmit power such that the
UE handed over to the target cell has sufficient DL C/I to receive DL control
channels from the target cell. The hybrid cell could also engage in fractional
frequency reuse (FFR) with the target cell to enhance DL data rate of the
victim UE.
2\. UL interference: A hybrid cell and HO target cell could choose the power
setting of this UE such that UL interference could be coordinated. UL control
channels of the HO sUE could also be orthogonalized with the PUCCH of the
source hybrid cell. UL data channel coordination through UL FFR could be
configured on a semi-static basis.
Note that hybrid cells also have additional information on the channel quality
of active UEs. Hence the adjustment made at the hybrid cell could fully take
into account on the impact to ongoing traffic. In some extreme scenarios,
hybrid cell could handover both the member UEs and non-member UEs to the macro
cell.
If a hybrid cell provides data services to non-member UEs, the hybrid HeNB is
similar to a pico cell with lower Tx power and different service level for
members and non-members. In addition, a hybrid HeNB is different from a
operator deployed pico cell in the following areas
1\. A release 9 hybrid HeNB does not support X2 interface.
2\. A hybrid HeNB could be customer deployed without proper RF planning
3\. The density of hybrid HeNB could have much high density than operator
deployed pico cells.
Given the challenges mentioned above, non-Rel-8 interference coordination
schemes should be investigated for hybrid cells.
### 7.5.2 DL Performance Evaluation
Full buffer performance analysis is performed for CSG and hybrid HeNB
deployments. The dense-urban model corresponds to to densely-populated areas
where there are multi-floor apartment buildings with smaller size apartment
units as described in [7].
The set of simulation parameters are shown below:
• System bandwidth 5 MHz
• Macro Power = 43dBm
• HeNB power between [-10 dBm, 10 dBm].
▪ Case 1, the HeNB power is fixed to 8 dBm
▪ Case 2, the adaptive HeNB power setting is used to reduce the MUE outage
• ISD of 1km
• Noise power = -99dBm
• 57 cell wrap around model with 3 center cells simulated for traffic
• 10 macro UEs per cell
• HeNB penetration rate of 5%, and activity factor of 13%, this leads to 12
active home UEs per cell
The association algorithm in all cases is based on the best RSRQ among allowed
cells. In the case of CSG cells, UEs are only allowed to associate with the
macro cell or the HeNB in the same CSG group. In the case of hybrid cells, all
cells are open.
The C/I and throughput distribution for CSG and hybrid cells are shown in
Figures 7.5.2.1 to 7.5.2.4. As shown in [6], adaptive power control could
reduce outage for CSG cells. In the case of hybrid cells, there is no outage
even without adaptive power control due to open association. Note that if
different service levels are enforced for group member and non-group members,
the fairness could be different from those shown in the figures.
Key mobile statistics (outage, 20% throughput and median throughput) are shown
in Table 7.5.2.1. It is noted that hybrid cells improve the outage and edge
user performance, while making little difference in high throughput region.
This is consistent with the expectation that with hybrid cells, the network
would be able to offload macro UEs in poor channel conditions to close by
hybrid cells. It is also interesting to note that the improvements due to
hybrid cell is much higher when adaptive HeNB power control is not available
(800% gain versus 60% gain).
Note that backhaul limitation of CSG and hybrid cells are not modeled in the
simulations. For practical deployments, users close by a hybrid cell is likely
to be backhaul limited rather than air-interface limited.

### 7.5.3 Hybrid Cell RB Resource Management
For hybrid cells, non-CSG members consume RB resources at the HeNB, the amount
of which will depend on the number of non-CSG UEs and the service level
provided to the non-CSG UEs. One possible method of managing the RB resources
used at a HeNB for non-CSG UEs is to reserve some RB resources for use by non-
CSG UEs.
In hybrid access mode, if a HeNB accepts non-CSG members as temporary users,
it would degrade CSG members\' capacity similar to the open access HeNB.
Moreover, when HeNB is under heavily loading, non-CSG UEs may be blocked first
and diverted to macro eNBs. These diverted non-CSG UEs that are still within
the coverage of the hybrid access HeNB may experience strong interferences
from the HeNB.
In order to manage RB resource and mitigate the DL interference of the hybrid
cells, a method called \"Resource Priority Region (RPR)\" may be used which
guarantees a small percentage of HeNB resources for non-CSG members.
The RPR for the hybrid access HeNB divides radio resources of a HeNB into two
regions for non-CSG members and CSG members respectively. The detailed
definitions for each resource region are:
1\. Non-CSG member priority region - non-CSG members have higher priority than
CSG members.
2\. CSG member priority region - CSG members have higher priority than non-CSG
members.
Fig. 7.5.3.1 Resource Priority Region
A threshold -- _Priority Region Threshold_ (PRT) is set to separate resources
between two priority regions. The PRT could be a time or physical resource
block (PRB) in radio frames, and PRT could be statically or dynamically
adjusted by exchanging ICIC messages between HeNB and macro eNB. The HeNB
could autonomously define the threshold for release 9, and further
enhancements allowing the threshold to be adapted e.g. based on S1 signaling
could be considered for release 10.
The hybrid access HeNB with RPR efficiently decreases the blocking probability
to non-CSG members when HeNB is exhausting its resource. Also, this method
guarantees the CSG members throughput that HeNB are not affected by sharing
the resource with non-CSG members.
### 7.5.4 Hybrid Cell Power Management
The optimum power setting for hybrid cells is likely to be different than for
closed cells, in that for closed cells the power is set as a compromise
between HeNB coverage and interference caused to neighbour \"victim\" cells,
whereas for hybrid HeNB it is set as a compromise between overall system
performance versus resources used at the HeNB by non-CSG UEs.
Measurements made by the HeNB of neighbour cells (\"sniffing\") can be used to
set an appropriate downlink power. However the propagation conditions between
a neighbouring (H)eNB and its associated UEs may differ significantly from the
propagation conditions between a neighbouring (H)eNB and the HeNB as measured
during \"sniffing\". Furthermore the propagation conditions between the HeNB
and nearby non-served UEs will not be known. These differences will result in
uncertainty when estimating the coverage of HeNB and neighbouring (H)eNBs to
non-served UEs.
One potential way to allow a hybrid access mode HeNB to get a more accurate
picture of its local environment is for the HeNB to request a UE to measure
RSRP and/or RSRQ of both source and target cells immediately after a UE hands-
in (active state) or registers with (idle state) the HeNB. This would apply
particularly to non-CSG UEs but could also apply to CSG UEs. In this way the
HeNB could, for example, determine if the hand-in or re-selection is a) due to
poor signal level from the source (e.g. macro) cell or b) due to high
interference from the HeNB. This would then allow the HeNB to determine its
output power appropriately. For example if the signal is particularly poor on
the source (e.g. macro) cell, the HeNB could use a relatively high power
and/or provide relatively high access priorities for non CSG UEs, compared to
the case where the signal level on the source cell is not so poor.
This basic approach would require no standards changes. Future standards
releases could consider more sophisticated approaches aimed at improved
performance e.g. based on UE storing measurement reports and/or events prior
to a hand-in or reselection of a HeNB, with subsequent reporting to the HeNB.
