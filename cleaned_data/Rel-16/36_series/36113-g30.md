# 1 Scope
The present document covers the assessment of E-UTRA, E-UTRA with NB-IoT or
NB-IoT base stations, repeaters and associated ancillary equipment in respect
of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC).
The present document specifies the applicable test conditions, performance
assessment and performance criteria for E-UTRA, E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT
base stations, repeaters and associated ancillary equipment in one of the
following categories:
> \- base sations of E-UTRA, E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT meeting the
> requirements of TS 36.104 [2], with conformance demonstrated by compliance
> to TS 36.141 [3].
>
> \- repeaters of E-UTRA meeting the requirements of TS 36.106 [4], with
> conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 36.143 [5].
Technical requirements related to the antenna port of E-UTRA, E-UTRA with NB-
IoT or NB-IoT base stations or repeaters are not included in the present
document. These are found in the relevant product standards [2-5].
The environment classification used in the present document refers to the
residential, commercial and light industrial environment classification used
in IEC 61000-6-1 [6] and IEC 61000-6-3 [7].
The EMC requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of
compatibility for apparatus at residential, commercial and light industrial
environments. The levels, however, do not cover extreme cases which may occur
in any location but with low probability of occurrence.

# 4 Test conditions
## 4.1 General
The equipment shall be tested in normal test environment defined in base
station conformance testing specification TS 36.141 [3] or in the E-UTRA
repeater conformance testing specification TS 36.143 [5]. The test conditions
shall be recorded in the test report.
For an EUT which contains more than one BS, it is sufficient to perform tests
relating to each type of port of each representative type of the BS forming
part of the EUT.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirements in the present
document apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated.
Operating bands shall be activated according to the test configuration in
subclause 4.6. Tests shall be performed relating to each type of port and all
bands shall be assessed during the tests.
## 4.2 Arrangements for establishing a communication link
The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency shall be selected by setting the
E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) to an appropriate
number.
A communication link shall be set up with a suitable test system capable of
evaluating the required performance criteria (hereafter called \"the test
system\") at the air interface and/or the S1 interface. The test system shall
be located outside of the test environment.
When the EUT is required to be in the transmit/receive mode, the following
conditions shall be met:
> \- the EUT shall be commanded to operate at maximum rated transmit power;
>
> \- Adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the unwanted
> signal on the measuring equipment;
>
> \- The wanted input signal level shall be set to a level where the
> performance is not limited by the receiver noise floor or strong signal
> effects e.g.15 dB above the reference sensitivity level as defined in TS
> 36.141 [3] to provide a stable communication link.
For immunity tests subclause 4.3 shall apply and the conditions shall be as
follows.
### 4.2.1 Multiple enclosure BS solution
For a BS with multiple enclosures, the BS part with Radio digital unit and the
Radio unit may be tested separately. Communication link shall be set up in the
same way as if they are in single BS enclosure. The Radio Digital unit and the
Radio unit shall communicate over an interface enabling establishment of a
communication link.
## 4.3 Narrow band responses on receivers
Responses on receivers or duplex transceivers occurring during the immunity
test at discrete frequencies which are narrow band responses (spurious
responses), are identified by the following method:
> \- if during an immunity test the quantity being monitored goes outside the
> specified tolerances (clause 6), it is necessary to establish whether the
> deviation is due to a narrow band response or to a wide band (EMC)
> phenomenon. Therefore, the test shall be repeated with the unwanted signal
> frequency increased, and then decreased by 2 x BW~Channel~ MHz, where
> BW~Channel~ is the channel bandwidth as defined in TS 36.104 [2];
>
> \- if the deviation disappears in either or both of the above 2 x
> BW~Channel~ MHz offset cases, then the response is considered as a narrow
> band response;
>
> \- if the deviation does not disappear, this may be due to the fact that the
> offset has made the frequency of the unwanted signal correspond to the
> frequency of another narrow band response. Under these circumstances the
> procedure is repeated with the increase and decrease of the frequency of the
> unwanted signal set to 2.5 x BW~Channel~ MHz;
>
> \- if the deviation does not disappear with the increased and/or decreased
> frequency, the phenomenon is considered wide band and therefore an EMC
> problem and the equipment fails the test.
Narrow band responses are disregarded.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, all supported operating bands shall be
considered for narrowband responses.
## 4.4 Test condition for Repeater
The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency shall be selected by setting the
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (ARFCN) to an appropriate number
within the operating band of the Repeater.
The Repeater path shall be tested with a suitable test system capable of
measuring RF performance criteria (hereafter called \"the test system\"). The
test system shall be located outside of the test environment.
When the EUT is required to be in the operational mode, the following
conditions shall be met:
> \- the EUT shall be commanded to operate at maximum rated gain;
>
> \- Adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the unwanted
> signal on the measuring equipment;
For immunity tests conditions subclause 4.3 shall apply.
### 4.4.1 Arrangements for test signals for repeaters
For immunity tests of repeaters, the wanted RF input signal shall be coupled
to one antenna port at a level which will result, when measured, in the
maximum rated RF output power per channel, as declared by the manufacturer.
The test shall either be repeated with a wanted signal coupled to the other
antenna port, or a single test shall be performed with the specified input
signals being simultaneously coupled to both antenna ports.
## 4.5 Exclusion bands
### 4.5.1 Transmitter exclusion band
For the purpose of EMC specifications there shall be a transmitter exclusion
band.
> \- Lower carrier frequency used - 2.5 x BW~Channel~ MHz to upper carrier
> frequency used + 2.5 x BW~Channel~ MHz, where BW~Channel~ is the channel
> bandwidth as defined in TS 36.104 [2].
### 4.5.2 Receiver exclusion band
The receiver exclusion band for base stations is the frequency range over
which no tests of radiated immunity of a receiver are made. The receiver
exclusion band is defined as:

NOTE 1: The performance criteria, Throughput > 95 % / No loss of service,
applies also if a bearer with another characteristics is used in the test.
NOTE 2: The performance criteria, Throughput > 90 % / No loss of service,
applies instead if the Uplink and Downlink paths are evaluated as a one loop.
NOTE 3: This is the information data rate of a single instance of the bearer
mapped to 25 resource blocks. The performance criteria shall be met for each
consecutive application of a single instance of the bearer mapped to disjoint
frequency ranges with a width of 25 resource blocks each. This reference
measurement channel is not applied for Band 46.
NOTE 4: This is the information data rate of a single instance of the bearer
mapped to a single interlace. The performance criteria shall be met for each
application of a single instance of the bearer mapped to each single
interlace. This reference measurement channel is only applied for Band 46.
## 6.2 Performance criteria for transient phenomena for BS
The test should be, where possible, be performed using a bearer with the
characteristics of data rate and throughput defined in Table 6.2.1 and Table
6.2.1a. If the test is not performed using one of these bearers (for, example,
of none of them are supported by the BS), the characteristics of the bearer
used shall be recorded.
The throughput in Table 6.2.1 or Table 6.2.1a is stated relative to the
maximum throughput of the FRC. For E-UTRA the maximum throughput for an FRC is
equal to the payload size * the number of uplink subframes per second. For NB-
IoT the Maximum throughput for an FRC equals the Payload size / (Number of
Resource Unit * time to send one Resource Unit).
The BS Uplink and Downlink paths shall each meet the performance criteria
defined in Table 6.2.1 and Table 6.2.1a during the test. If the Uplink and
Downlink paths are evaluated as a one loop then the criteria is two times the
throughput reduction shown in Table 6.2.1 and Table 6.2.1a. After each test
case BS shall operate as intended with no loss of user control function,
stored data and the communication link shall be maintained.

## 8.2 Radiated emission from Base station, Repeater and ancillary equipment
### 8.2.1 Radiated emission, Base stations and Repeater
This test is applicable to Base station and Repeater. This test shall be
performed on a representative configuration of the Base station or Repeater.
#### 8.2.1.1 Definition
This test assesses the ability of BS and Repeater to limit unwanted emission
from the enclosure port.
#### 8.2.1.2 Test method
> a) A test site fulfilling the requirements of ITU-R SM. 329 [10] shall be
> used. The BS or Repeater shall be placed on a non-conducting support and
> shall be operated from a power source via a RF filter to avoid radiation
> from the power leads.
>
> Mean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test antenna
> and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser). At each frequency at
> which a component is detected, the BS or Repeater shall be rotated and the
> height of the test antenna adjusted to obtain maximum response, and the
> effective radiated power (e.r.p.) of that component determined by a
> substitution measurement. The measurement shall be repeated with the test
> antenna in the orthogonal polarization plane.
>
> NOTE: Effective radiated power (e.r.p.) refers to the radiation of a half
> wave tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a constant
> difference of 2,15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p.
e.r.p. (dBm) = e.i.r.p. (dBm) − 2,15 Ref: ITU-R SM.329 ANNEX 1 [10].
> b) The BS shall transmit with maximum power declared by the manufacturer
> with all transmitters active. Set the base station to transmit a signal as
> stated for measurement of spurious emission in the TS 36.141 [3].
>
> In case of a Repeater the gain and the output power shall be set to the
> maximum value as declared by the manufacturer.
>
> c) The received power shall be measured over the frequency range 30 MHz to
> 12.75 GHz, excluding 2.5 x BW~Channel~ MHz below the first carrier frequency
> to 2.5 x BW~Channel~ MHz above the last carrier frequency used, where
> BW~Channel~ is the channel bandwidth as defined in TS 36.104 [2]. The
> measurement bandwidth shall be 100 kHz between 30 MHz and 1 GHz and 1 MHz
> above 1 GHz as given in ITU-R SM.329 [10]. The video bandwidth shall be
> approximately three times the resolution bandwidth. If this video bandwidth
> is not available on the measuring receiver, it shall be the maximum
> available and at least 1 MHz. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are
> done as mean power (RMS).
#### 8.2.1.3 Limits
The frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed transitions
of the limits between the requirements for out of band emissions and spurious
emissions are based on ITU-R Recommendations SM.329 [10] and SM.1539 [23].
The BS or the Repeater shall meet the limits below:
Table 8.2.1: Limits for radiated emissions from BS and repeater
* * *
Frequency range Minimum requirement (e.r.p.)/Reference Bandwidth
30 MHz≤ f \ Fc1: Center frequency of first carrier frequency used by the BS and
> repeater.
>
> Fc2: Center frequency of last carrier frequency used by the BS and repeater.
>
> BW~Channel~: Channel bandwidth as defined in TS 36.104 [2].
#### 8.2.1.4 Interpretation of the measurement results
The interpretation of the results recorded in a test report for the radiated
emission measurements described in the present document shall be as follows:
> \- the measured value related to the corresponding limit will be used to
> decide whether an equipment meets the requirements of the present document;
>
> \- the value of the measurement uncertainty for the measurement of each
> parameter shall be included in the test report;
>
> \- the recorded value of the measurement uncertainty shall be, for each
> measurement, equal to or lower than the figures in Table 8.2.2 for BS and
> repeater.
Table 8.2.2 specifies the Maximum measurement uncertainty of the Test System.
The Test System shall enable the equipment under test to be measured with an
uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and
uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level of 95
%, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
