# 4 Performance Management procedures
## 4.1 Introduction
The procedures listed in clause 4, as some of all the possibilities, are not
exhaustive.
## 4.2 Threshold creation for monitoring the 3GPP NF performance measurements
related to VR
Figure 4.2-1 depicts a procedure that describes how the 3GPP NF performanc
measurements related VR threshold crossing notification is generated. If the
threshold is created to monitor a performance measurement directly without
association with a PM job, then step 1 to 4 are not needed:
1\. NM sends a request to EM to create a measurement job (see clause 7.3.1 of
[2]) to collect the 3GPP NF performanc measurements related VR. The job is
defined by the parameters, such as iOCName and iOCInstanceList ... etc. as
listed in clause 7.3.1.2 of [2].
2\. EM sends a request with sourceSelector, performanceMetric,
performanceMetricGroup, collectionPeriod, reportingPeriod, reportingBoundary
(see clause 7.6.2.2 of [3]), to VNFM to create a PM job to collect VNF/VNFC PM
data related to VR.
3\. VNFM sends a response with pmJobId (see clause 7.6.2.3 of [3]) to EM to
indicate the PM job that has been created.
4\. EM sends a response to NM with jobId that is mapped from pmJobId, and
status = Success (see clause 7.3.1.3 of [2]).
5\. NM sends a request to EM to create thresholds (see clause 7.4.1 of [2])
that are defined by parameters, such as iOCName, iOCInstanceList, and
thresholdInfoList (see clause 7.4.1.2 of [2]) to monitor the 3GPP NF
performance measurements related VR.
6\. EM sends a request to VNFM with sourceSelector, performanceMetric,
thresholdType, thresholdDetails (see clause 7.6.7.2 of [3]), to create the
thresholds for monitoring the measurement types specified in sourceSelector.
7\. VNFM sends a response to EM with thresholdId (see clause 7.6.7.3 of [3])
to indicate the identifiers of thresholds that have been created.
8\. EM sends a response to NM with monitorId, and status = Success (see clause
7.4.1.3 of [2]).
9\. NM sends a request to EM to subscribe the 3GPP NF performance measurements
related VR threshold crossing notification (see clause 6.3.1 of [4]).
10\. EM sends a request with filter (see clause 7.6.4.2 of [3]) to VNFM to
subscribe the VNF/VNFC performance information related VR threshold crossing
notification.
11\. VNFM sends a response with subscriptionId (see clause 7.6.4.3 of [3]) to
EM to indicate the notification subscription that has been subscribed.
12\. EM sends a response to NM to indicate that the 3GPP NF performance
measurements related VR threshold crossing notification has been subscribed
(see clause 6.3.1 of [4]).
13\. VNFM sends a notification with thresholdId, crossingDirection,
objectInstanceId, performanceMetric, performanceValue (see clause 9.7.9.3 of
[3]) to EM to indicate the threshold identified by objectInstanceId has been
crossed.
14\. EM sends a notification with the object instance ID to NM to indicate
that the threshold identified by object instance has been crossed.

notification procedure
## 4.3 VNF PM data related to VR job creation procedure
Figure 4.3-1 depicts a procedure that describes how VNF PM data related to VR
job is created:
> 1\. EM sends a _CreatePmJobRequest_ to VNFM with the following parameters
> (see clause 7.6.2.2 of [3]) to create a PM job:
\- sourceSelector: It identifies the VNF/VNFC for which the PM data is to be
collected.
\- performanceMetric or performanceMetricGroup: It defines the type of
performance metric(s), or the group of performance metric(s). Only one of the
two is present.
\- collectionPeriod: it specifies the periodicity at which the VNFM will
collect performance information.
\- reportingPeriod: It specifies the periodicity at which the VNFM will report
to the EM about performance information,
\- reportingBoundary: It identifies a boundary after which the reporting will
stop, and is optional.
2\. VNFM sends a _CreatePmJobResponse_ to EM with pmJobId (see clause 7.6.2.3
of [3]) to indicate the PM job that has been created.
Figure 4.3-1: VNF PM data related to VR job creation procedure
## 4.4 VNF PM data related to VR subscription procedure
Figure 4.4-1 depicts a procedure that describes howto create a subscription to
monitor VNF PM data related to VR:
1\. EM sends a _SubscribeRequest_ to VNFM with filter (see clause 7.6.4.2 of
[3]) to subscribe the VNF PM data related to VR available notification.
2\. VNFM sends a _SubscribeResponse_ to EM with subscriptionId (see clause
7.6.4.3 of [3]) to indicate the notification subscription that has been
subscribed.
Figure 4.4-1: subscription for VNF PM data related to VR procedure
## 4.5 VNF PM data related to VR available notification procedure
Figure 4.5-1 depicts a procedure that describes how VNF PM data related to VR
available notification is generated. EM has subscribed to receive the
notification from VNFM. NM has subscribed to receive the notification from EM:
1\. VNFM invokes an operation called Notify (see clause 7.6.5 of [3]) to send
a _PerformanceInformationAvailableNotification_ to EM (see clause 9.7.8 of
[3]) with objectInstanceId, the identifier of the VNF or VNFC instances (see
clause 9.7.8.3 of [3]), to indicate the VNF PM data related to VR identified
by objectInstanceId is available.
2\. EM invokes a notification called _notifyFileReady_ (see clause 6.5.1 of
[5]) to NM with object instance IDs to indicate that the VNF PM data related
to VR identified by object instance ID is available.
Figure 4.5-1: VNF PM data related to VR available notification procedure
## 4.6 PM job deletion for VNF/VNFC performance measurements related to VR
Figure 4.6-1 depicts a procedure PM job deletion for VNF/VNFC performance
measurements related to VR.
> 1\. EM sends a _DeletePmJobRequest_ to VNFM with the pmJobId (see clause
> 7.4.3.2 of [3]) to identify the PM jobs to be deleted.
2\. VNFM sends a _DeletePmJobResponse_ to EM with deletedPmJobId (see clause
7.4.3.3 of [3]) to identifiy the PM jobs that have been deleted.
Figure 4.6-1: PM job deletion for VNF/VNFC performance measurements related to
VR
## 4.7 Measurement job suspension for 3GPP NF performance measurements related
to VR
Figure 4.7-1 depicts a procedure on measurement job suspension for 3GPP NF
performance measurements related to VR:
1\. NM invokes the suspendMeasurementJob operation (see clause 7.3.3 of [2])
with jobId to request EM to suspend the measurement job for 3GPP NF
performance measurements related to VR.
2\. EM stops the reporting of the measurement result data for the measurement
job identified by the jobId.
3\. EM responses the suspendMeasurementJob operation (see clause 7.3.1 of [2])
to NM with the result of the measurement job suspension.
Figure 4.7-1: Measurement job suspension for 3GPP NF performance measurements
related to VR
## 4.8 Measurement job resumption for 3GPP NF performance measurements related
to VR
Figure 4.8-1 depicts a procedure on measurement job resumption for 3GPP NF
performance measurements related to VR:
1\. NM invokes the resumeMeasurementJob operation (see clause 7.3.3 of [2])
with jobId to request EM to resume the measurement job for 3GPP NF performance
measurements related to VR.
2\. If the PM jobs used to support the measurement job identified by the jobId
do not exist anymore, EM requests VNFM to create the PM job(s), according to
the procedure defined in clause 4.3.
3\. EM resumes the reporting of the measurement result data for the
measurement job identified by the jobId.
4\. EM responses the resumeMeasurementJob operation (see clause 7.3.1 of [2])
to NM with the result of the measurement job resumption.
Figure 4.8-1: Measurement job resumption for 3GPP NF performance measurements
related to VR
## 4.9 Performance alarm notification procedure for NF performance
measurements related to VR
Figure 4.9-1 depicts a procedure that describes how EM can generate a
performance alarm when threshold crossing notifications are received from
VNFM. It is assumed that EM has subscribed to receive the threshold crossing
notification from VNFM:
1\. VNFM sends a _ThresholdCrossedNotification_ with the following parameters
(see clause 9.7.9.3 of [3]) to EM to indicate the threshold that has been
crossed:
\- thresholdId: identifies the threshold which has been crossed.
\- crossingDirection: indicates whether the threshold was crossed in upward or
downward direction.
\- objectInstanceId: identifies the VNF or VNFC instance for which the
threshold has been crossed.
\- performanceMetric: indicates the performance metric associated with the
threshold.
\- performanceValue: indicates the value of the metric that resulted in
threshold crossing.
2\. EM maps the performanceValue to the performance measurements for 3GPP NF
related to VR, and determines whether or which alarm notification (i.e.,
notifyNewAlarm, notifyChangedAlarm or notifyClearedAlarm for the measurements
defined in TS 32.426 [6]) should be sent to NM (see Annex B in [2]), based on
the ThresholdMonitor created by NM (see clause 7.4.1.1 in [2]).
Note: How EM to perform mapping depends on the definition/specification of
\"performance measurements for 3GPP NF related to VR\" and of
performanceMetric, which are not defined in the present specification.
3\. If an alarm needs to be generated:
3.1. EM saves the performance alarm to the AlarmList.
3.2.a. If the performance alarm is a new alarm, then EM sends a
_notifyNewAlarm_ notification to NM.
> 3.2.b. If the performance alarm is a changed alarm, then EM sends to NM
> either a _notifyChangedAlarm_ notification, or _notifyClearedAlarm_ follow
> by a _notifyNewAlarm_ notifications if _notifyChangedAlarm_ is not
> supported.
3.2.c. If the performance alarm is a cleared alarm, then EM sends a
_notifyClearedAlarm_ notification to NM.
