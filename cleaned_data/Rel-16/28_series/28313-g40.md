In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.

# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 SON concepts
### 4.1.1 Overview
Based on the location of the SON algorithm, SON is categorized into four
different solutions that are possible for implementing various SON use cases,
the solution is selected depending on the needs of the SON use cases.
a) Centralized SON:
1) Cross Domain-Centralized SON
2) Domain-Centralized SON
b) Distributed SON
c) Hybrid SON.
The SON algorithm is not standardized by 3GPP.
The following figure illustrates the overview of SON Framework.
{width="3.388888888888889in" height="2.576388888888889in"}
Figure 4.1.1-1: Overview of SON Framework
### 4.1.2 Centralized SON
#### 4.1.2.1 Introduction
Centralized SON (C-SON) means that the SON algorithm executes in the 3GPP
management system. The centralized SON concept has been defined for LTE in TS
32.500 [2].
Figure 4.1.2.1-1 shows a generic C-SON process, where the SON algorithms
execute in the 3GPP management system interact with network functions in RAN
and/or CN to implement SON functions. The SON algorithm may consist of the
following functionalities:
> \- Monitoring: monitor the network(s) by collecting management data,
> including the data provided by MDAS.
>
> \- Analysis: analyse the management data to determine if there are issues in
> the network(s) that need to be resolved.
>
> \- Decision: makes the decision on the SON actions to resolve the issues.
\- Execution: execute the SON actions.
\- Evaluation: evaluate whether the issues have been solved by analysing the
management data
NOTE: The management data as well as the exact algorithm may vary for
different SON cases. For example, for automated creation of NSI, NSSI and/or
NFs related cases, the management data may be SLA requirements received from
service management layer; for automated optimization related cases, the
management data may be performance measurements of the networks; for automated
healing related cases, the management data may be alarm information of the
networks. The management data and the algorithm are to be specified case by
case.
Figure 4.1.2.1-1: C-SON process
#### 4.1.2.2 Cross Domain-Centralized SON
The Cross Domain-Centralized SON means that the SON algorithm executes in the
3GPP Cross Domain layer.
For Cross Domain-Centralized SON, the MnF(s) in 3GPP Cross Domain layer
monitors the networks via management data, analyses the management data, makes
decisions on the SON actions, and executes the SON actions.
#### 4.1.2.3 Domain-Centralized SON
The Domain-Centralized SON means the SON algorithm executes in the Domain
layer.
For Domain-Centralized SON, the MnF(s) in Domain layer monitors the networks
via management data, analyses the management data, makes decisions on the SON
actions, and executes the SON actions.
The MnF(s) in 3GPP Cross Domain is responsible for management and control of
the Domain-Centralized SON function. The management and control may include
switching on/off a Domain-Centralized SON function, making policies for a
Domain-Centralized SON function, and/or evaluating the performance of a
Domain-Centralized SON function.
### 4.1.3 Distributed SON
The distributed SON (D-SON) means that the SON algorithm is located in the
NFs. The distributed SON concept has been defined for LTE in TS 32.500 [2].
For D-SON, the NFs monitors the network events, analyses the network data,
makes decisions on the SON actions and executes the SON actions in the network
nodes.
Figure 4.1.3-1 shows that the 3GPP management system (MnF in Domain or 3GPP
Cross Domain) is responsible for the following functions:
a) D-SON management function:
1) Switch on/off a D-SON function,
2) Provide policies, targets, and supplementary information (e.g., the range
attributes) for a D-SON function.
b) D-SON evaluation function: evaluate whether the issues have been resolved,
and may apply D-SON management actions.
Figure 4.1.3-1: D-SON process
### 4.1.4 Hybrid SON
The hybrid SON (H-SON) means the SON algorithm are executed at two or more of
the following levels: NF layer, Domain layer or 3GPP Cross Domain layer. The
hybrid SON concept has been defined for LTE in TS 32.500 [2].
The 3GPP management system (i.e. MnF(s) in Domain or 3GPP Cross Domain) and
NFs work together, in a coordinated manner, to build up a complete SON
algorithm. The decisions on SON actions may be made by 3GPP management system
and/or NFs, depending on the specific cases.
Figure 4.1.4-1 shows that the C-SON component is monitoring and executes SON
actions.

## 4.2 Self-establishment of new RAN NE in network
### 4.2.1 Introduction
Self-establishment of new RAN NE in network describes the procedure of a new
NG-RAN NE can automatically establish when it is powered up and connect to the
IP network in multi-vendor scenario, which includes:
\- Network Configuration data handling
\- Plug and connect to management system
\- Self-Configuration
### 4.2.2 Network configuration data handling
Network configuration data handling makes the network configuration data
available to the management system support self-configuration process, which
may include network configuration data preparation, network configuration data
transfer and network configuration data validation. This happens except all of
the network configuration data for NE can be generated by the management
system supporting self-configuration process.
**Network configuration data preparation:** This makes the network
configuration data ready in operator\'s network management system who provides
the network configuration data. How to prepare the network configuration data
in operator\'s network management system is out of scope of the present
document.
**Network configuration data transfer:** This transfers the Network
configuration data from network configuration data Provider to the network
configuration data Consumer.
**Network configuration data validation:** This validates the syntax and
semantics of network configuration data. It takes place in the network
configuration data Consumer.
### 4.2.3 Plug and connect to management system
Plug and connect to management system connects the deployed NE to its
management system providing support for self-configuration process as
automatically as possible. The following functionality is included: initial IP
Autoconfiguration service, Certificate enrolment, establish secure connection,
establish connect to management system providing support for self-
configuration process.
### 4.2.4 Self-configuration
Self-configuration puts the NE into a state to be ready to carry traffic in an
automated manner. Self-configuration includes following functionality: create
self-configuration task, monitor self-configuration process, generate
configuration data if needed, download and activate software, download and
active configuration data, perform self-test and update network resource
model, etc.
