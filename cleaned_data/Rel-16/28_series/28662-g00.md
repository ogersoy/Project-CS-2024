Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
28.661: Generic Radio Access Network (RAN) Network Resource Model (NRM);
Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements;
**28.662: Generic Radio Access Network (RAN) Network Resource Model (NRM);
Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS);**
28.663: Generic Radio Access Network (RAN) Network Resource Model (NRM);
Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Generic Radio Access Network (RAN) network
resource model (NRM) that can be communicated between an IRPAgent and an
IRPManager for telecommunication network management purposes, including
management of converged networks.
This document specifies the semantics and behaviour of information object
class attributes and relations visible across the reference point in a
protocol and technology neutral way. It does not define their syntax and
encoding.
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface IRP such
as the \"Basic CM IRP\" is needed (3GPP TS 32.602 [5]). However, which
Interface IRP is applicable is outside the scope of the present document.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

### 4.3.4 GSMCellPart
#### 4.3.4.1 Definition
A GSM cell can consist of a number of carriers. These carriers can be
configured in a number of ways, for example, the carriers can have different
propagation properties which are sent with different antenna tilt, with
different RF power, different radio band and even possibly different antenna.
The various GSMCellPart instances capture different radio propagation
properties allowing different frequency planning schemes, e.g. some
GSMCellPart instances can use frequency groups planned for tighter frequency
reuse.
Hence, a GSM cell can, and in some cases must, be distributed on more than one
SectorEquipmentFunction.
This IOC is required as part of the capability to satisfy the Requirements
statement identified below.
