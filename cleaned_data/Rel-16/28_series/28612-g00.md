# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:
TS 28.611: **\"** Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access interworking
system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Requirements**\";**
**TS 28.612: \"Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access interworking
system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Information Service (IS)\" ;**
TS 28.616: **\"** Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access interworking
system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Solution Set (SS) definitions**\".**
The interface Itf-N, defined in 3GPP TS 32.102 [3], is built up by a number of
Integration Reference Points (IRPs) and a related Name Convention, which
realize the functional capabilities over this interface. The basic structure
of the IRPs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.101 [2], 3GPP TS 32.102 [3] and 3GPP TS
32.103 [13].
# 1 Scope
The present document is an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named \"Evolved
Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access interworking system Network resource
Model (NRM) IRP; Information Service (IS)\", through which an \'IRPAgent\'
(typically an Element Manager or Network Element) can communicate
configuration management information to one or several \'IRPManagers\'
(typically Network Managers) concerning interworking network resources.
The present document specifies the semantics and behaviour of Information
Object Class (IOC) attributes and relations visible across the reference point
in a protocol and technology neutral way. It does not define their syntax and
encoding.
It reuses relevant parts of the generic NRM in 3GPP TS 28.622 [6], either by
direct reuse or sub-classing, and in addition to that defines specific IOCs in
EPC and non-3GPP access interworking systems.
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an interface IRP is
needed, such as the Basic CM IRP IS (3GPP TS 32.602 [7]) or the Bulk CM IRP IS
(3GPP TS 32.612 [8]). However, which interface IRP is applicable is outside
the scope of the present document.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.
