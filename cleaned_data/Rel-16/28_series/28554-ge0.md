## 6.5 Retainability KPI
### 6.5.1 QoS flow Retainability
#### 6.5.1.1 Definition
a) QoSRetain_R1, QoSRetain_R2.
b) This KPI shows how often an end-user abnormally loses a QoS flow during the
time the QoS flow is used. It is obtained by number of QoS flows with data in
a buffer that was abnormally released, normalized with number of data session
time units. The unit of this KPI is "active release / second". The KPI type is
MEAN.
c) To measure QoS flow Retainability for a single QoS level (R1) is fairly
straight forward.\ \ {width="2.3229166666666665in" height="0.3125in"}\ However
to measure the QoS flow Retainability for UEs is not as straight forward. The
measurement R1 is defined to look at the activity level of just one QoS level
at the time, so to use this formula and measurements in an aggregated way to
get QoS flow Retainability on UE level will not be accurate (e.g. for an UE
with multiple QoS flows there might be QoS flows that are active at the same
time, hence aggregating the QoS level measurements for session time will give
a larger session time than the total UE session time. See picture below).\ \ \
Hence a measurement QoS flow Retainability on UE level is defined (R2) to
provide a measurement for the overall QoS flow Retainability.\ \

e) The definition of the service provided by 5GS is QoS flows.
#### 6.5.1.2 Extended definition
The retainability rate is defined as:
To define (from a QoS flow Retainability point of view) if a QoS flow is
considered active or not, the QoS flows can be divided into two groups:
\- For QoS flows with bursty flow, a QoS flow is said to be active if there is
user data in the PDCP queue in any of the directions or if any data (UL or DL)
has been transferred during the last 100 ms.
\- For QoS flows with continuous flow, the QoS flow (and the UE) is seen as
being active in the context of this measurement as long as the UE is in RRC
connected state, and the session time is increased from the first data
transmission on the QoS flow until 100 ms after the last data transmission on
the QoS flow.

d) SubNetwork, NRCellCU
e) The definition of the service provided by 5GS is DRBs.
#### 6.5.2.2 Extended definition
To define (from a DRB Retainability point of view) if a DRB is considered
active or not, the DRB can be divided into two groups:
\- For DRBs with bursty flow, a DRB is said to be active if there is user data
in the PDCP queue in any of the directions or if any data (UL or DL) has been
transferred during the last 100 ms.
\- For DRBs with continuous flow, the DRB (and the UE) is seen as being active
in the context of this measurement as long as the UE is in RRC connected
state, and the session time is increased from the first data transmission on
the DRB until 100 ms after the last data transmission on the DRB.
A particular DRB is defined to be of type continuous flow if the mapped 5QI is
any of {1, 2, 65, 66}.

collect PEE measurements data from all PNFs in the gNB, in the same way as the
other PM measurements.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Use cases for end to end KPIs
# A.1 Use case for end-to-end latency measurements of 5G network-related KPI
The end-to-end latency is an important performance parameter for operating 5G
network. In some scenarios (e.g. uRLLC), if end-to-end latency is
insufficient, the 5G network customer cannot obtain guaranteed network
performance provided by the network operator. So it is necessary to define
end-to-end latency of network related measurement to evaluate whether the end-
to-end latency that network customer requested has been satisfied. A procedure
is invoked by network management system and is used:
\- to update the CSMF/NSMF with the end-to-end latency parameter for
monitoring;
\- to inform the network customer/network operator the end-to-end latency;
\- to make CSMF/NSMF aware if the end-to-end latency can meet network
customer's service requirement.
If high end-to-end latency are measured, it is also of benefit to pinpoint
where in the chain from application to UE that the latency occurs.
# A.2 Use case for number of registered subscribers of single network-slice
related KPI
Number of registered subscribers of single network slice can be used to
describe the amount of subscribers that are successfully registered, it can
reflect the usage of network slice , It is useful to evaluate accessibility
performance provided by one single network slice which may trigger the
lifecycle management of the network slice, this kind of KPI is valuable
especially when network functions (e.g. AMF) are shared between different
network slice . This KPI is focusing on both network and user view.
# A.3 Use case for upstream/downstream throughput for one-single-network-
slice-related KPI
Measuring throughput is useful to evaluate system load of end to end network
slice. If the throughput of the specific network slice cannot meet the
performance requirement, some actions need to be performed to the network
slice e.g. reconfiguration, capacity relocation. So it is necessary to define
the IP throughput for one single network slice . This KPI is focusing on
network and user view.
# A.4 Use case for mean PDU sessions number in network slice
It is necessary to evaluate the mean PDU session number in the network slice
to indicate system load level. For example, if the mean value of the PDU
sessions is high, maybe the system capacity should be increased. This KPI is
focusing on network view.
# A.5 Use case for virtualised resource utilization of network-slice-related
KPI
It is necessary to evaluate the current utilization of virtualised resources
(e.g. memory and storage utilization) that a network slice is occupied. If the
utilization is larger or smaller than the threshold, maybe some scale in/out
operations will be made by the management system. This KPI is focusing on
network and user view.
# A.6 Use case for 5GS registration success rate of one single-network-slice-
related KPI
It is necessary to evaluate accessibility performance provided by 5GS. 5GS
registration for a UE is important when they have registered to the network
slice . If users or subscribers cannot register to the network slice , they
cannot access any network services in the network slice . This KPI is focusing
on network view.
# A.7 Use case for RAN UE throughput-related KPI
The UE perceived throughput in NG-RAN is an important performance parameter
for operating 5G network. If the UE throughput of the NR cell cannot meet the
performance requirement, some actions need to be performed to the network,
e.g. reconfiguration or capacity increase. So it is necessary to define UE
throughput KPI to evaluate whether the end-users are satisfied. The KPI covers
volume large enough to make the throughput measurement relevant, i.e.
excluding data volume of the last or only slot.
The UE throughput KPI covers also \"NR option 3\" scenarios. Then the gNB is
\"connected\" towards the EPC, and not towards 5GC.
It is proposed to allow the KPI separated based on mapped 5QI (or for QCI in
case of NR option 3).
When network slicing is supported by the NG-RAN, multiple network slices may
be supported. The UL and DL UE throughput for each network slice is then of
importance to the operator to pinpoint a specific performance problem.
# A.8 Use case for QoS flow retainability-related KPI
QoS flow is the key and limited resource for 5GS to deliver services. The
release of the QoS flow needs to be monitored. QoS flow retainability is a key
performance indicator of how often an end-user abnormally losing a QoS flow
during the time the QoS flow is used. This key performance indicator is of
great importance to estimate the end users' experiences.
# A.9 Use case for DRB accessibility-related KPI
In providing services to end-users, the first step is to get access to the
service. First after access to the service has been performed, the service can
be used.
The service provided by NG-RAN is the DRB. For the DRB to be successfully
setup it is also necessary to setup an RRC connection and an NG signalling
connection.
If an end user cannot access a service, it is hard to charge for the service.
Also, if it happens often that an end-user cannot access the provided service,
the end-user might change wireless subscription provider, i.e. loss of income
for the network operator. Hence, to have a good accessibility of the services
is important from a business point of view.
A DRB accessibility KPI requires the following 3 measurements:
\- RRC connection setup success rate.
\- NG signalling connection setup success rate.
\- DRB setup success rate.
The success rate for RRC connection setup and for NG signalling connection
setup shall exclude setups with establishment cause mo-Signalling, since these
phases/procedures occur when there is no request to setup a DRB.
This KPI is available per mapped 5QI and per S-NSSAI, and it assists the
network operator with information about the accessibility provided to their 5G
network customers.
# A.10 Use case for mobility KPIs
When a service is used it is important that it is not interrupted or aborted.
One of the fault cases in a radio system for this is handovers/mobility.
If a mobility KPI is not considered OK, then the network operator can
investigate which steps that are required to improve the mobility towards
their services.
These KPIs can be used for observing the impact on end-users of mobility in
NG-RAN and towards other system.
# A.11 Use case for DRB retainability related KPI
DRB is the key and limited resource for 5GS to deliver services. Once a QoS
flow reaches a gNB it will trigger setup of a new DRB or it will be mapped to
an existing DRB. The decision on how to map QoS flows into new or existing
DRBs is taken at the CU-CP. CU-CP also defines one set of QoS parameters (one
5QI) for the DRB. If a QoS flow is mapped to an existing DRB, the packets
belonging to that QoS flow are not treated with the 5QI of the QoS flow, but
they are treated with the mapped 5QI of the DRB.
The release of the DRB needs to be monitored, so that abnormal releases while
the UE is considered in an active transfer shall be logged. DRB retainability
is a key performance indicator of how often an end-user abnormally loses a DRB
during the time the DRB is actively used. This key performance indicator is of
great important to estimate the end users' experiences. DRBs with bursty flow
are considered active if any data (UL or DL) has been transferred during the
last 100 ms. DRBs with continuous flow are seen as active DRBs in the context
of this measurement as long as the UE is in RRC connected state. A particular
DRB is defined to be of type continuous flow if the mapped 5QI is any of {1,
2, 65, 66}.
The key performance indicator shall monitor the DRB retainability for each
used mapped 5QI value, as well as for the used S-NSSAI(s). DRBs used in 3GPP
option 3 shall not be covered by this KPI. For the case when a DRB have
multiple QoS flows mapped and active, when a QoS flow is released it will not
be counted as a DRB release (DRB still active) in this KPI.
# A.12 Use case for PDU session establishment success rate of one network
slice (S-NSSAI) related KPI
It is necessary to evaluate accessibility performance provided by 5GS. PDU
session Establishment for a UE is important when it has registered to the
network slice. If users or subscribers cannot establish PDU sessions in slice
instance, they cannot access any network services in the network slice. This
KPI is focusing on network view.
# A.13 Use case for integrated downlink latency in RAN
Following figure captured in clause 4.2.3, 3GPP TS 23.501[x] illustrates the
5G system architecture. The end to end downlink latency should be measured
from Data Network to UE, of which the latency from RAN to UE is an important
part for the latency of this section is closely related to NG-RAN.
The integrated downlink latency in RAN is a key performance parameter for
evaluating the packet delay in RAN for QoS monitoring. This KPI is also an
important part of the end-to-end network latency for SLA assurance.
# A.14 Use case for PDU session Establishment success rate of one single-
network-slice instance-related KPI
It is necessary to evaluate PDU session establishment time, it can be used to
analyse the network service difference between different RAN locations in one
area, which can be used for management area division. This KPI is focusing on
network view.
# A.15 Use case for QoS flow retainability-related KPI
QoS Flow is the key and limited resource for 5GS to deliver services. The
release of the QoS flow needs to be monitored. QoS Flow drop ratio is a key
performance indicator of how often an end-user is abnormally losing a bearer.
This key performance indicator is of great importance to estimate the end
users' experiences.
The KPI shall be available per QoS group.
From QoS perspective it is important to focus also on call duration as in some
cases wrong quality perceived by the end user is not fully reflected by drop
ratio nor retainability KPI. Typical case is when due to poor radio conditions
the end user redials (the call was terminated normally) to the same party to
secure the quality. But in this case the drop ratio KPI will not show any
degradation. Secondly, although the call is dropped the end user may or may
not redial depending on dropped call duration compared to the case when the
call would be normally released. It is therefore highly recommended to monitor
distribution of duration of normally and abnormally released calls.
# A.16 Use case for 5G Energy Efficiency (EE) KPI
Assessment of Energy Efficiency in network is very important for operators
willing to control their OPEX and, in particular, their network energy OPEX.
Mobile Network data Energy Efficiency (EE~MN,DV~) is the ratio between the
performance indicator (DV~MN~) and the energy consumption (EC~MN~) when
assessed during the same time frame, see ETSI ES 203 228 [8] clause 3.1 and
clause 5.3.
{width="0.9583333333333334in" height="0.25in"}
where EE~MN,DV~ is expressed in bit/J.
Assessment of EE~MN,DV~ needs the collection of both Data Volumes (DV) and
Energy Consumption (EC) of 5G Network Functions (NF). How this EE KPI can be
applied to NG-RAN is specified in clause 4.1 of TS 28.310 [9].
Before the network operator takes any action to save network energy OPEX, the
network operator needs to know the energy efficiency of its 5G network.
This KPI needs to be used for observing the impact of NG-RAN on data energy
efficiency of 5G access networks.
