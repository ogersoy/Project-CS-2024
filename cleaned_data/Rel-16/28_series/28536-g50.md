### 4.1.3 Procedures
#### 4.1.3.1 SLS Assurance Procedure
Figure 4.1.3.1.1 SLS assurance procedure
For the purpose of the procedure shown in Figure 4.1.3.1.1 \"entities
participating in the loop\" refers to any entity in the 3GPP management system
responsible for the functioning of an ACCL to ensure the
AssuranceControlLoopGoal required by an AssuranceControlLoop_Consumer.
1\. AssuranceControlLoop_consumer derives AssuranceControlLoopGoal from the
ServiceProfile or SliceProfile.
2\. AssuranceControlLoop_consumer provides the AssuranceControlLoopGoal to
Entities_Participating_in_loop by utilizing the provision management services
defined in as defined in clause 11.1.1.3 of TS 28.532 [7].
NOTE 1: In case the Entities_Participating_in_loop represents
CrossDomain_Entities_Participating_in_loop, the AssuranceControlLoopGoal is
the attribute(s) of the ServiceProfile. In case the
Entities_Participating_in_loop represents
Domain_Entities_Participating_in_loop, the AssuranceControlLoopGoal is the
attribute(s) of the SliceProfile.
3\. Entities_Participating_in_loop subscribes the related performance data
(e.g., the packet delay related measurements), fault data, QoE data (e.g.,
buffer level) and MDT data from respective sources by utilizing the Operation
establishStreamingConnection as defined in clause 6.2.1 of TS 28.550 [3].
4\. Entities_Participating_in_loop, optionally, subscribes the related
analytical data from MDAS producer or network functions, e.g., NWDAF. In case
of NWDAF as a provider, Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription Service as defined in clause
4.2 of TS 29.520 [11] is used.
5\. Entities_Participating_in_loop collects the related performance, fault,
QoE and MDT data (e.g., the packet delay related measurements), fault data,
QoE data (e.g., buffer level) and MDT data from respective sources by
utilizing the Operation establishStreamingConnection as defined in clause
6.2.1 of TS 28.550 [3].
6\. Entities_Participating_in_loop, optionally, collects the related
analytical data from MDAS producer or network functions, e.g., NWDAF. In case
of NWDAF as a provider, Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription Service as defined in clause
4.2 of TS 29.520 [11] is used.
7\. Entities_Participating_in_loop assesses if the AssuranceControlLoopGoal
has been fulfilled.
8\. Entities_Participating_in_loop assesses if and which action to take in
case the AssuranceControlLoopGoal has not been fulfilled.
9\. As per the mitigation action (e.g., scale out) resources are changed, the
generic provisioning management service as defined in clause 11.1 of TS 28.532
[7] is utilized for the same.
10\. Action completed.
NOTE 2: The Entities_Participating_in_loop continues to monitor and analyse
the performance and perform the adjustment until the attribute(s) of
SliceProfile is assured.
11\. AssuranceControlLoop_consumer receives the confirmation of assurance
fulfilment from Entities_Participating_in_loop by utilizing the provision
management services defined in clause 11.1.1.3 of TS 28.532 [7].
## 4.2 Stage 3
### 4.2.1 Solution Set (SS) for JSON/YAML
The JSON/YAML solution set is documented in clause B.2.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Control loop deployed in different layers
## A.1 Introduction
This example gives a high-level view of control loops deployed in different
layers, which consists of control loop in communication service layer, control
loop in network slice layer, control loop in network slice subnet layer and
control loop in NF layer, as described as Figure A.1.1, where the analytic
could be leverage MDAS, and different control loops can provide input
(interact with) to other control loops (in the same layer or different layers)
and obtain the output from other control loops (in the same layer or different
layers).
{width="4.7in" height="2.8in"}
Figure A.1.1: Control loop in different layers
## A.2 Control loop in communication service layer
SLA/SLS requirements provided from CSC are translated into serviceProfile,
which represents the requirements for communication service assurance to the
CSP. Coordination between control loop in communication service layer and
control loop in network slice layer is needed to calculate the communication
service resource requirements and to assure the communication service SLA/SLS
requirements.
When the communication service is active, network slice performance is
monitored and analysed for the communication service according to end user
service experiences.
If service degradation occurs or it is predicted, the 3GPP management system
could take actions, i.e. the allocated resources are scaled up or the SLS is
adjusted based on pre-agreement/interaction between CSP and CSC.
## A.3 Control loop in network slice layer
After receiving SLA/SLS requirements from service profile and completing the
network slice provisioning, the network slice performance (e.g. KPI, QoE) are
monitored and reported. Compared to the SLA/SLS requirements from service
profile, when network slice performance is not met, the 3GPP management system
identifies the root cause and may reconfigure the resources according to
analytical report from MDAS producer. The network slice resources are also
modified accordantly in case the network slice performance requirement needs
to be changed based on communication service requirement adjustment.
## A.4 Control loop in network slice subnet layer
After decomposing service profile to slice profile, the performance
requirements for each network slice subnet are obtained. The 3GPP management
system could have the capability of service observation (e.g., the supervision
to the NSSI) based on MDAS. Based on such observation and comparison with
initial subnet performance requirements, management actions on the NSSI might
be performed if NSSI performance requirements fulfillment indicates a problem.
Another possible scenario is that, when the NSSI performance requirement is
changed because of the network slice modification management action, the NSSI
resources might be also reconfigured.
## A.5 Control loop in NF layer
NOTE: The control loop in NF layer is not addressed in the present document.

###### ## Annex C (normative): AssuranceClosedControlLoop state management
An AssuranceClosedControlLoop is a logical object in the management system
that represents complex interaction between the assurance information and
configuration information of a grouping of resources. At any time, the
management system needs to know the state of an AssuranceClosedControlLoop.
The ITU-T X.731 [15], to which [14] refers, has defined the inter-relation
between the administrative state and operational state of systems in general.
Figure X.1 shows the state diagram of an AssuranceClosedControlLoop, where the
number in the Figure identify the state changes. The explanations for the
state changes are described in Table C.1.
Figure C.1: AssuranceClosedControlLoop state diagram
In an AssuranceClosedControlLoop deployment scenario, the interactions between
various management services allow the reconfiguration of the resources
controlled by the AssuranceClosedControlLoop based on predefined goal(s). The
interactions specified under the column \"The state transition events and
actions\" of Table C.1 shall be present for the state transition.
Table C.1: The AssuranceClosedControlLoop state transition table
+----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | Trigger number | The state transition | State | | | events and actions | | +================+=========================+=========================+ | 0 | The Assurance MnS | Locked & Disabled | | | producer responds | | | | positively to the | | | | "create ACCL\" message, | | | | the ACCL is created and | | | | the state is set to | | | | Locked | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | 1 | The Assurance MnS | _Locked & Enabled_ | | | producer has assurance | | | | goals to fulfil and | | | | starts or resumes | | | | operation by setting | | | | the operational state | | | | to Enabled | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | 2 | The Assurance MnS | _Locked_ | | | consumer suspends | | | | operation of the ACCL | _(Enabled or Disabled)_ | | | by setting the | | | | adminstrative state to | | | | Locked | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | 3 | The Assurance MnS | _Unlocked_ | | | consumer resumes | | | | operation of the ACCL | _(Enabled or Disabled)_ | | | by setting the | | | | administrative state to | | | | Unlocked. | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | 4 | The Assurance MnS | _Disabled_ | | | producer does not have | | | | any assurance goals to | _(Locked or Unlocked)_ | | | fulfil and suspends | | | | operation by setting | | | | the operational state | | | | to Disabled | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | 5 | The Assurance MnS | _NULL_ | | | producer responds | | | | positively to the | | | | "delete ACCL\" message, | | | | the ACCL is deleted, | | | | and the state is set to | | | | NULL (the Initial and | | | | Final state) | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
NOTE: The trigger numbers in the first column represent the state changes in
