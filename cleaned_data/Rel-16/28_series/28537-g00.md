# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, certain modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
> The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
> normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
>
> The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
> \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
> they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
> external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
> style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
> document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
> The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
> elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
> used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" shall not to be used as substitutes
for \"may\" and \"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

## 4.1 Overview
The communication between Management Service (MnS) producers and MnS consumers
shall be monitored, and communication link breaks between them shall be

#### 4.2.1.3 Emitting periodic heartbeat notifications
* * *
Use case stage Evolution/Specification \>\ Related use
**Goal** To send periodic heartbeat notifications at the periodicity requested
by the management service consumer.
**Actors and Roles** An authorized producer of the management service.
**Telecom resources** The management service consumer.
**Assumptions** The heartbeat notification periodicity has been configured
according to the management service consumer request. Configuring heartbeat
notification periodicity
**Pre-conditions** N/A
**Begins when** The internal countdown timer managed by the management service
producer has reached the value 0.
**Step 1** The management service producer sends a heartbeat notification to
all authorized management service consumer(s), provided they previously
subscribed to heartbeat notifications..
**Step 2** The management service producer resets its internal countdown timer
to the value of the heartbeat notification periodicity. Configuring heartbeat
notification periodicity
**Ends when** All the steps identified above are successfully completed.
**Exceptions** One of the steps identified above fails.
**Post-conditions** The periodic heartbeat notification has been emitted to
all authorized management service consumer(s) at the requested periodicity.
**Traceability** REQ-HB-NOTIF-FUN-1.
