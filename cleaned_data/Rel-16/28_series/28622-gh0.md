# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
28.621 Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Requirements;
**28.622 Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Information Service (IS) ;**
**28.623 Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions.**
The interface Itf-N, defined in 3GPP TS 32.102 [2], is built up by a number of
Integration Reference Points (IRPs) and a related Name Convention, which
realise the functional capabilities over this interface. The basic structure
of the IRPs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.150 [4].
The present document is part of a set that has been developed for converged
management solutions.
The present document is part of a set that is used for **management and
orchestration of 5G networks and network slicing.**
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Generic network resource information that
can be communicated between an MnS producer and MnS consumer for
telecommunication network management purposes, including management of
converged networks and networks that include virtualized network functions.
This document specifies the semantics of information object class attributes
and relations visible across the reference point in a protocol and technology
neutral way. It does not define their syntax and encoding.
This document supports the Federated Network Information Model (FNIM) concept
described in [8] in that the relevant Information Object Class (IOC)s defined
in this specification are directly or indirectly inherited from those
specified in the Umbrella Information Model (UIM) of [9].
Note that the present document is applicable to deployment scenarios using the
Service Based Management Architecture (SBMA) as defined in TS 28.533 [32].

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply. For terms and definitions not found here, please refer to 3GPP TS
32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2], 3GPP TS 32.150 [4] and 3GPP TS 32.600 [14].
**Association** : In general, it is used to model relationships between
Managed Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
1) name bindings,
2) reference attributes, and
3) association objects.
This IRP stipulates that name containment associations shall be expressed
through name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other
types of associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate
entities in the object models (UML diagrams). Currently however, all (non-
containment) associations are modelled by means of reference attributes of the
participating MOs.
**Information Object Class (IOC): An IOC represents the management aspect of a
network resource.** It describes the information that can be passed/used in
management interfaces. **Their representations are technology agnostic
software objects.** IOC has attributes that represents the various properties
of the class of objects. See the term \"attribute\" defined in [10].
Furthermore, IOC can support operations providing network management services
invocable on demand for that class of objects. An IOC may support
notifications that report event occurrences relevant for that class of
objects. It is modelled using the stereotype \"Class\" in the UML meta-model.
See TS 32.156 [10] for additional information on IOC.
**Managed Object (MO)** : A MO is an instance of a Managed Object Class (MOC)
representing the management aspects of a network resource. Its representation
is a technology specific software object. It is sometimes called MO instance
(MOI). The MOC is a class of such technology specific software objects. An MOC
is the same as an IOC except that the former is defined in technology specific
terms and the latter is defined in technology agnostic terms. MOCs are
used/defined in SS level specifications. IOCs are used/defined in IS level
specifications.
**Management Information Base (MIB)** : A MIB is an instance of an NRM and has
some values on the defined attributes and associations specific for that
instance. In the context of the present document, an MIB consists of:
1) a Name space (describing the MO containment hierarchy in the MIB through
Distinguished Names),
2) a number of Managed Objects with their attributes and
3) a number of Associations between these MOs. Also note that TMN (ITU-T
Recommendation X.710 [7]) defines a concept of a Management Information Tree
(also known as a Naming Tree) that corresponds to the name space (containment
hierarchy) portion of this MIB definition. Figure 3.1 depicts the
relationships between a Name space and a number of participating MOs (the
shown association is of a non-containment type)
Figure 3.1: Relationships between a Name space and a number of participating
MOs
**Name space** : A name space is a collection of names. The IRP name
convention (see 3GPP TS 32.300 [13]) restricts the name space to a
hierarchical containment structure, including its simplest form - the one-
level, flat name space.\ All Managed Objects in a MIB are included in the
corresponding name space and the MIB/name space shall only support a strict
hierarchical containment structure (with one root object). A Managed Object
that contains another is said to be the superior (parent); the contained
Managed Object is referred to as the subordinate (child). The parent of all
MOs in a single name space is called a Local Root. The ultimate parent of all
MOs of all managed systems is called the Global Root.
**Network resource:** discrete entity represented by an Information Object
Class (IOC) for the purpose of network and service management.
NOTE: A network resource may represent intelligence, information, hardware and
software of a telecommunication network.
**Network Resource Model (NRM)** : A collection of IOCs, inclusive of their
associations, attributes and operations, representing a set of network
resources under management.

## 4.2 Class diagrams
### 4.2.1 Relationships
This clause depicts the set of classes (e.g. IOCs) that encapsulates the
information relevant for this IRP. This clause provides the overview of the
relationships of relevant classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more
detailed specification of various aspects of these classes.
The following figure shows the containment/naming hierarchy and the
associations of the classes defined in the present document. See Annex A of a
class diagram that combines this figure with Figure 1 of [2], the class
diagram of UIM.
NOTE 1: ManagedElement may be contained either
> \- in a SubNetwork (since _SubNetwork_ inherits from _Domain_ _ and
> _ManagedElement_ inherits from _ManagedElement_ _ and _Domain_ _ name-
> contained _ManagedElement__ as observed in the figure of Annex A) or
>
> \- in a MeContext instance as observed by the above figure or in the figure
> of Annex A.
This either-or relation cannot be shown by using an {xor} constraint in the
above figure.
ManagedElement may also have no parent instance at all.
NOTE 2: Void
NOTE 3: If the configuration contains several instances of SubNetwork, exactly
one SubNetwork instance shall directly or indirectly contain all the other
SubNetwork instances.
NOTE 4: The SubNetwork instance not contained in any other instance of
SubNetwork is referred to as \"the root SubNetwork instance\".
NOTE 5: ManagementNode shall be contained in the root SubNetwork instance.
NOTE 6: If contained in a SubNetwork instance, MnsAgent shall be contained in
the root SubNetwork instance.
NOTE 7: Void
NOTE 8: Void
Figure 4.2.1-1: NRM fragment
Each Managed Object is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to
3GPP TS 32.300 [13] that expresses its containment hierarchy. As an example,
the DN of a ManagedElement instance could have a format like:
SubNetwork=Sweden,MeContext=MEC-Gbg-1,ManagedElement=RNC-Gbg-1.

specification but are or will be defined in other IRP specification(s).
#### 4.3.1.2 Attributes
None
#### 4.3.1.3 Attribute constraints
None
#### 4.3.1.4 Notifications
_This class does not support any notification._
### 4.3.2 Void
### 4.3.2a MnsAgent
#### 4.3.2a.1 Definition
The MnsAgent represents the MnS producers, incl. the supporting hardware and
software, available for a certain management scope that is related to the
object name-containing the MnS Agent.
The MnSAgent can be name-contained under an IOC as follows (only one of the
options shall be used):
1) ManagementNode;
2) SubNetwork, if the SubNetwork does not contain a ManagementNode;
3) ManagedElement, ifit is the root element .
In case the MnsAgent is name-contained under a ManagementNode, the management
scope is the complete management scope of the ManagementNode or a subset
thereof.
In case the MnsAgent is name-contained under a SubNetwork, the management
scope is the complete SubNetwork or a subset thereof.
In case the MnsAgent is name-contained under a ManagedElement, the management
scope is the complete ManagedElement or a subset thereof.
The MnsAgent shall be used only in deployments using the Service Based
Management Architecture (SBMA) as defined in TS 28.533 [32].
#### 4.3.2a.2 Attributes
The MnSAgent IOC includes the attributes inherited from Top_ IOC (defined in
TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in clause 4.3.8)
and the following attributes:
Attribute Name S isReadable isWritable isInvariant isNotifyable
* * *
systemDN M T F F T
#### 4.3.2a.3 Attribute constraints
None.
#### 4.3.2a.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC, without
exceptions or additions.
### 4.3.3 ManagedElement
#### 4.3.3.1 Definition
This IOC represents telecommunications equipment or TMN entities within the
telecommunications network providing support and/or service to the
subscriber.\ A ManagedElement IOC is used to represent a Network Element
defined in TS 32.101[1] including virtualization or non-virtualization
scenario. ManagementElement instance is used for communicating with a manager
(directly or indirectly) over one or more management interfaces for the
purpose of being monitored and/or controlled. ManagedElement may or may not
additionally perform element management functionality. A ManagedElement
contains equipment that may or may not be geographically distributed.
A telecommunication equipment has software and hardware components. The
ManagedElement IOC described above represents the following two cases:
\- In the case when the software component is designed to run on dedicated
hardware component, the ManagedElement IOC description includes both software
and hardware component.
\- In the case when the software is designed to run on ETSI NFV defined NFVI
[15], the ManagedElement IOC description would exclude the NFVI component
supporting the above mentioned subject software.
A ManagedElement may be contained in either a SubNetwork or in a MeContext
instance. A ManagedElement may also exist stand-alone with no parent at all.
The relation of ManagedElement IOC and ManagedFunction IOC can be described as
following:
\- A ManagedElement instance may have 1..1 containment relationship to a
ManagedFunction instance. In this case, the ManagedElement IOC may be used to
represent a NE with single ManagedFunction functionality. For example, a
ManagedElement is used to represent the 3GPP defined RNC node.
\- A ManagedElement instances may have 1..N containment relationship to
multiple ManagedFunction IOC instances. In this case, the ManagedElement IOC
may be used to represent a NE with combined ManagedFunction functionality (as
indicated by the managedElementType attribute and the contained instances of
different ManagedFunction IOCs). For example, a ManagedElement is used to
represent the combined functionality of 3GPP defined gNBCUCPFunction,
gNBCUUPFunction and gNBDUFunction.
NOTE: For some specific functional IOCs a 1..N containment relationship is
permitted. The specific functional entities are identified in the NRMs that
define subclasses of ManagedFunction.
#### 4.3.3.2 Attributes
The ManagedElement IOC includes the attributes inherited from ManagedElement_
IOC (defined in TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from TopX IOC (defined in
clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
Attribute Name S isReadable isWritable isInvariant isNotifyable
* * *
vendorName M T F F T userDefinedState M T T F T swVersion M T F F T
priorityLabel O T T F T supportedPerfMetricGroups O T F F T
#### 4.3.3.3 Attribute constraints
Attribute constrains for dnPrefix: The attribute dnPrefix shall be supported
if an instance of ManagedElement is the local root instance of the MIB.
Otherwise the attribute shall be absent or carry no information.
#### 4.3.3.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC. In
addition, the following set of notifications is also valid.
Name S Notes
* * *
notifyFileReady M -- notifyFilePreparationError M --
notifyDownloadNESwStatusChanged M -- notifyInstallNESwStatusChanged O --
notifyActivateNESwStatusChanged M --
### 4.3.4 _ManagedFunction_
#### 4.3.4.1 Definition
This IOC is provided for sub-classing only. It provides attribute(s) that are
common to functional IOCs. Note that a ManagedElement may contain several
managed functions, a managed function may contain other managed functions as
specified for the specific subclass.. The ManagedFunction may be extended in
the future if more common characteristics to functional objects are
identified.
This IOC can represent a telecommunication function either realized by
software running on dedicated hardware or realized by software running on
NFVI. Each ManagedFunction instance communicates with a manager (directly or
indirectly) over one or more management interfaces exposed via its containing
ME instance.
#### 4.3.4.2 Attributes
The ManagedFunction IOC includes the attributes inherited from Function_ IOC
(defined in TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from TopX IOC (defined in
clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
Attribute Name S isReadable isWritable isInvariant isNotifyable
* * *
vnfParametersList CM T T F T peeParametersList CM T T F T priorityLabel O T T
F T supportedPerfMetricGroups O T F F T
#### 4.3.4.3 Attribute constraints
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | Name | Definition | +===================+=================================================+ | vnfParametersList | Condition: The ManagedFunction instance is | | | realized by one or more VNF instance(s). | | Support Qualifier | Otherwise this attribute shall be absent. | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | peeParametersList | Condition: The control and monitoring of PEE | | | parameters is supported by the ManagedFunction | | Support Qualifier | or sub-class instance. | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
#### 4.3.4.4 Notifications
There is no notification defined.
### 4.3.5 ManagementNode
#### 4.3.5.1 Definition
This IOC represents a telecommunications management system (EM) within the TMN
that contains functionality for managing a number of ManagedElements (MEs).
The management system communicates with the MEs directly or indirectly over
one or more interfaces for the purpose of monitoring and/or controlling these
MEs.
This class has similar characteristics as the ManagedElement. The main
difference between these two classes is that the ManagementNode has a special
association to the managed elements that it is responsible for managing.
#### 4.3.5.2 Attributes
The ManagementNode IOC includes the attributes inherited from
ManagementSystem_ IOC (defined in TS 28.620 [9]), attributes inherited from
TopX IOC (defined in clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
Attribute Name S isReadable isWritable isInvariant isNotifyable
* * *
vendorName M T F F T userDefinedState M T T F T locationName M T F F T
swVersion M T F F T
#### 4.3.5.3 Attribute constraints
None
#### 4.3.5.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC. In
addition, the following set of notifications is also valid.
Name S Notes
* * *
notifyFileReady M -- notifyFilePreparationError M --
### 4.3.6 MeContext
#### 4.3.6.1 Definition
This IOC is introduced for naming purposes. It may support creation of unique
DNs in scenarios when some MEs have the same RDNs due to the fact that they
have been manufacturer pre-configured.\ If some MEs have the same RDNs (for
the above mentioned reason) and they are contained in the same SubNetwork
instance, some measure shall be taken in order to assure the global uniqueness
of DNs for all IOC instances under those MEs. One way could be to set
different dnPrefix for those NEs, but that would require either that:
a) all LDNs or DNs are locally modified using the new dnPrefix for the upper
portion of the DNs, or
b) a mapping (translation) of the old LDNs or DNs to the new DNs every time
they are used externally, e.g. in alarm notifications.
As both the two alternatives above may involve unacceptable drawbacks (as the
old RDNs for the MEs then would have to be changed or mapped to new values),
using MeContext offers a new alternative to resolve the DN creation. Using
MeContext as part of the naming tree (and thus the DN) means that the
dnPrefix, including a unique MeContext for each ME, may be directly
concatenated with the LDNs, without any need to change or map the existing ME
RDNs to new values.
MeContext have 0..N instances. It may exist even if no SubNetwork exists.
Every instance of MeContext contains exactly one ManagedElement during steady-
state operations.
#### 4.3.6.2 Attributes
The MeContext IOC includes the attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in
clause 4.3.29) and the following attributes:
Attribute Name S isReadable isWritable isInvariant isNotifyable
* * *
dnPrefix CM T F F T
#### 4.3.6.3 Attribute constraints

### 4.3.10 _Link_
#### 4.3.10.1 Definition
This IOC is provided for sub-classing only. This IOC represents a
communication link or reference point between two network entities. The Link
IOC does not indicate whether the represented communication link or reference
point is a physical or logical entity.
For the subclasses of Link, the following rules apply:
1) The subclass names shall have the form "Link_\_\", where \ is a
string that represents the IOC at one end of the association related to the
particular Link subclass, and \ is a string that represents the IOC at the
other end of the association. For the order of the two strings, \ shall
come alphabetically before \.
2) In case \ and \ are YyyFunction IOCs (inheriting from ManagedFunction
and on first level below ManagedElement), the \ and \ strings shall have
the same form as the legal values of the managedElementType attribute (see
clause 4.5.1), e.g. "Auc". Otherwise \ and \ shall be the full IOC
names.

### 4.3.16 ThresholdMonitor
#### 4.3.16.1 Definition
This IOC represents a threshold monitor for performance metrics. It can be
name-contained by SubNetwork, ManagedElement, or _ManagedFunction_. A
threshold monitor checks for threshold crossings of performance metric values
related to specified managed objects and generates a notification when that
happens.
The ThresholdMonitor is used only when NRM based threshold monitoring is
supported.
To activate threshold monitoring, a MnS consumer needs to create a
ThresholdMonitor instance on the MnS producer. For ultimate deactivation of
threshold monitoring, the MnS consumer should delete the monitor to free up
resources on the MnS producer.
For temporary suspension of threshold monitoring, the MnS consumer can
manipulate the value of the administrative state attribute. The MnS producer
may disable threshold monitoring as well, for example in overload situations.
This situation is indicated by the MnS producer with setting the operational
state attribute to disabled. When monitoring is resumed the operational state
is set again to enabled.
All object instances below and including the instance name-containing the
ThresholdMonitor (base object instance) are scoped for performance
metricthreshold monitoring. Performance metrics are monitored only on those
object instances whose object class matches the object class associated to the
performance metrics to be monitored.
The optional attributes objectInstances and rootObjectInstances allow to
restrict the scope. When the attribute objectInstances is present, only the
object instances identified by this attribute are scoped. When the attribute
rootObjectInstances is present, then the subtrees whose root objects are
identified by this attribute are scoped. Both attributes may be present at the
same time meaning the total scope is equal to the sum of both scopes. Object
instances may be scoped by both the objectInstances and rootObjectInstances
attributes. This shall not be considered as an error by the MnS producer.
Multiple thresholds can be defined for multiple performance metric sets in a
single monitor using thresholdInfoList. The attribute monitorGranularityPeriod
defines the granularity period to be applied. The value is a multiple of a
supported granularity period for the measurements being monitored.
A threshold is defined using the attributes thresholdValue, thresholdDirection
and hysteresis.
When hysteresis is absent or carries no information, a threshold is triggered
when the thresholdValue is reached or crossed. When hysteresis is present, two
threshold values are specified for the threshold as follows: A high threshold
value equal to the threshold value plus the hysteresis value, and a low
threshold value equal to the threshold value minus the hysteresis value. When
the monitored performance metric increases, the threshold is triggered when
the high threshold value is reached or crossed. When the monitored performance
metric decreases, the threshold is triggered when the low threshold value is
reached or crossed. The hysteresis ensures that the performance metric value
can oscillate around a comparison value without triggering each time the
threshold when the threshold value is crossed.Using the thresholdDirection
attribute a threshold can be configured in such a manner that it is triggered
only when the monitored performance metric is going up or down upon reaching
or crossing the threshold.
A ThresholdMonitor creation request shall be rejected, if the performance
metrics requested to be monitored, the requested granularity period, or the
requested combination thereof is not supported by the MnS producer. A creation
request may fail, when the performance metrics requested to be monitored are
not produced by a PerfMetricJob.
Creation and deletion of ThresholdMonitor instances by MnS consumers is
optional; when not supported, ThresholdMonitor instances may be created and
deleted by the system or be pre-installed.
A threshold crossing event detected by a \"ThresholdMonitor\" shall trigger a
\"notifyThresholdCrossing\" notification. To subscribe to
\"notifyThresholdCrossing\" notifications the MnS consumer shall specify one
or more \"ThresholdMonitor\" instances in the subscription. All threshold
crossings detected by the specified \"ThresholdMonitor\" instances are sent as
\"notifyThresholdCrossing\" to subscribed MnS consumers (unless filtered out
by the \"notificationFilter\" attribute of \"NtfSubscriptionControl).
#### 4.3.16.2 Attributes

### 4.3.21 HeartbeatControl
#### 4.3.21.1 Definition
MnS consumers (i.e. notification recipients) use heartbeat notifications to
monitor the communication channels between them and MnS producers configured
to emit notifications.
A HeartbeatControl instance allows controlling the emission of heartbeat
notifications by MnS producers. The recipients of heartbeat notifications are
specified by the notificationRecipientAddress attribute of the
NtfSubscriptionControl instance name containing the HeartbeatControl instance.
Note that the MnS consumer managing the HeartbeatControl instance and the MnS
consumer receiving the heartbeat notifications may not be the same.
As a pre-condition for the emission of heartbeat notifications, a
HeartbeatControl instance needs to be created. Creation of an instance with an
initial non-zero value of the heartbeatNtfPeriod attribute triggers an
immediate heartbeat notification emission. Creation of an instance with an
initial zero value of the heartbeatPeriod attribute does not trigger an
emission of a heartbeat notification. Deletion of an instance does not trigger
an emission of a heartbeat notification.
Once the instance is created, heartbeat notifications are emitted with a
periodicity defined by the value of the heartbeatNtfPeriod attribute. No
heartbeat notifications are emitted if the value is equal to zero. Setting a
zero value to a non zero value, or a non zero value to a different non zero
value, triggers an immediate heartbeat notification, that is the base for the
new heartbeat period. Setting a non zero value to a zero value stops emitting
heartbeats immediately; no final heartbeat notification is sent.
The attribute triggerHeartbeatNtf allows MnS consumers to trigger the emission
of an immediate additional heartbeat notification. The emission of heartbeat
notifications according to the heartbeat period is not impacted by this
additional notification.
Creation and deletion of HeartbeatControl instances by MnS Consumers is
optional; when not supported, the HeartbeatControl instances may be created
and deleted by the system or be pre-installed.
The emission of heartbeat notifications is fully controlled by
HeartbeatControl instances. Subscription for heartbeat notifications is not
supported by NtfSubscriptionControl.
#### 4.3.21.2 Attributes
The HeartbeatControl IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined
in clause 4.3.29) and the following attributes:

### 4.3.22 NtfSubscriptionControl
#### 4.3.22.1 Definition
NtfSubscriptionControl represents a notification subscription of a
notification recipient. It can be name-contained by SubNetwork or
ManagedElement.
The scope attribute is used to select managed object instances included in the
subscription. The base object instance of the scope (see clause 4.3.23) is the
object instance name-containing the NtfSubscriptionControl instance. When the
scope attribute is absent, all objects below and including the base object are
scoped. The notifications related to the selected managed object instances are
candidates to be sent to the address specified by the
notificationRecipientAddress attribute.
The notificationType attribute and notificationFilter attribute allow MnS
consumers to control which candidate notifications are sent to the
notificationRecipientAddress.
If the notificationType attribute is present, its value identifies the
notification types that are candidates to be sent to the
notificationRecipientAddress. If the notificationType attribute is absent,
notifications of all types are candidates to be sent to
notificationRecipientAddress.
If supported, the notificationFilter attribute defines a filter that is
applied to the set of candidate notifications. The filter is applicable to all
parameters of a notification. Only candidate notifications that pass the
filter criteria are sent to the notificationRecipientAddress. If the
notificationFilter attribute is absent, all candidate notificatios are sent to
the notificationRecipientAddress.
To receive notifications, a MnS consumer has to create a
NtfSubscriptionControl instance on the MnS producer. A MnS consumer can create
a subscription for another MnS consumer since it is not required the
notificationRecipientAddress be his own address.
When a MnS consumer does not wish to receive notifications any more the MnS
consumer shall delete the corresponding NtfSubscriptionControl instance.
When a subscription is created and the notification scope inludes the created
subscription object and the subscribed notification types include
notifications reporting object creation (notifyMOICreation or
notifyMOIChanges), the first notification sent related to the new subscription
shall report the creation of the NtfSubscriptionControl instance. Likewise,
when a subscription is deleted and the notification scope inludes the deleted
subscription object and the subscribed notification types include
notifications reporting object deletion (notifyMOIDeletion or
notifyMOIChanges), the last notification sent related to the subscription
shall report the deletion of the NtfSubscriptionControl instance.
Creation and deletion of NtfSubscriptionControl instances by MnS consumers is
optional; when not supported, the NtfSubscriptionControl instances may be
created and deleted by the system or be pre-installed.
#### 4.3.22.2 Attributes
The NtfSubscriptionControl IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC

### 4.3.26 AlarmList
#### 4.3.26.1 Definition
The AlarmList represents the capability to store and manage alarm records. It
can be name-contained by SubNetwork and ManagedElement. The management scope
of an AlarmList is defined by all descendant objects of the base managed
object, which is the object name-containing the AlarmList, and the base object
itself.
AlarmList instances are created by the system or are pre-installed. They
cannot be created nor deleted by MnS consumers.
An instance of SubNetwork or ManagedElement has at most one name-contained
instance of AlarmList.
When the alarm list is locked or disabled, the existing alarm records are not
updated or deleted, and new alarm records are not added to the alarm list.
#### 4.3.26.2 Attributes
The AlarmList IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in
clause 4.3.29) and the following attributes:
**Attribute Name** **S** **isReadable** **isWritable** **isInvariant**

#### 4.3.26.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC, without
exceptions or additions.
### 4.3.27 AlarmRecord \>
#### 4.3.27.1 Definition
An AlarmRecord contains alarm information of an alarmed object instance. A new
record is created in the alarm list when an alarmed object instance generates
an alarm and no alarm record exists with the same values for objectInstance,
alarmType, probableCause and specificProblem. When a new record is created the
MnS producer creates an alarmId, that unambiguously identifies an alarm record
in the AlarmList.
Alarm records are maintained only for active alarms. Inactive alarms are
automatically deleted by the MnS producer from the AlarmList. Active alarms
are alarms whose
a) perceivedSeverity is not \"CLEARED\", or whose
b) perceivedSeverity is \"CLEARED\" and its ackState is not \"ACKNOWLEDED\".
#### 4.3.27.2 Attributes
The attributes are defined in clause 11.2.2.1.5.1 of TS 28.532 [27]. Many of
them are based on definitions in ITU-T X.733 [31].

### 4.3.30 TraceJob
#### 4.3.30.1 Definition
A TraceJob instance represents the Trace Control and Configuration parameters
of a particular Trace Job (see TS 32.421 [29] and TS 32.422 [30] for details).
It can be name-contained by SubNetwork, ManagedElement, ManagedFunction.
To activate Trace Jobs, a MnS consumer has to create TraceJob object instances
on the MnS producer. A MnS consumer can activate a Trace Job for another MnS
consumer since it is not required the value of traceCollectionEntityIpAddress
or traceReportingConsumerUri to be his own.
For the details of Trace Job activation see clauses 4.1.1.1.2 and 4.1.2.1.2 of
TS 32.422 [30].
When a MnS consumer wishes to deactivate a Trace Job, the MnS consumer shall
delete the corresponding TraceJob instance. For details of management Trace
Job deactivation see clauses 4.1.3.8 to 4.1.3.11 and 4.1.4.10 to 4.1.4.13 of
TS 32.422 [30].
The attribute traceReference specifies a globally unique ID and identifies a
Trace session. One Trace Session may be activated to multiple Network
Elements. The traceReference is populated by the consumer that makes the
request for a Trace Session, TS 32.422 [30].
The attribute traceReportingFormat defines the method for reporting the
produced measurements. The selectable options are file-based or stream-based
reporting. In case of file-based reporting the attribute
traceCollectionEntityIPAddress is used to specify the IP address to which the
trace records shall be transferred, while in case of stream-based reporting
the attribute traceReportingConsumerUri specifies the streaming target.
The mandatory attribute traceTarget determines the target object of the
TraceJob. Dependent on the network element to which the Trace Session is
activated different types of the target object are possible. The attribute
plmnTarget defines the PLMN for which sessions shall be selected in the Trace
Session in case of management based activation when several PLMNs are
supported in the RAN.
The attribute jobType specifies the kind of data to collect. Dependent on the
selected type various parameters shall be available. The attributes jobType,
traceReference, traceRecordingSessionReference,
traceCollectionEntityIPAddress, traceTarget and traceReportingFormat are
mandatory for all job types. If streaming reporting is selected for
traceReportingFormat, traceReportingConsumerUri shall be present additionally.
The attribute pLMNTarget shall be present if trace activation method is
management based.
For the different job types the attributes are differentiated as follows:
\- In case of TRACE_ONLY additionally the following attributes shall be
available: listOfNeTypes, traceDepth, and triggeringEvents.
> For this case the optional attribute listOfInterfaces allows to specify the
> interfaces to be recorded.
\- In case of IMMEDIATE_MDT_ONLY additionally the following attributes shall
be available:
\- anonymizationOfMDTData,
\- listOfMeasurements,
\- collectionPeriodRRMUMTS (conditional for M4 and M5 in UMTS),
> \- measurementPeriodUMTS (conditional for M6 and M7 in UMTS),
>
> \- collectionPeriodRRMLTE (conditional for M3 in LTE),
>
> \- measurementPeriodLTE (conditional for M4 and M5 in LTE),
>
> \- collectionPeriodM6LTE (conditional for M6 in LTE),

> \- collectionPeriodM7NR (conditional for M7 in NR),
>
> \- reportInterval (conditional for M1 in LTE or NR and M1/M2 in UMTS),
>
> \- reportAmount (conditional for M1 in LTE or NR and M1/M2 in UMTS),
>
> \- reportingTrigger (conditional for M1 in LTE or NR and M1/M2 in UMTS),
>
> \- eventThreshold (conditional for A2 event reporting or A2 event triggered
> periodic reporting),
>
> \- measurementQuantity (conditional for 1F event reporting).
>
> For this case the optional attribute areaScope allows to specify the area in
> terms of cells or Tracking Area/Routing Area/Location area where the MDT
> data collection shall take place and the optional attributes
> positioningMethod, sensorInformation allow to specify the positioning
> methods to use or the sensor information to include.
\- In case of IMMEDIATE_MDT_AND_TRACE both additional attributes of TRACE_ONLY
and IMMEDIATE_MDT_ONLY shall apply.
\- In case of LOGGED_MDT_ONLY additionally the following attributes shall be
available: anonymizationOfMDTData, traceCollectionEntityId, loggingInterval,
loggingDuration, reportType, eventListForEventTriggeredMeasurements.
> For this case the optional attribute areaScope allows to specify the area in
> terms of cells or Tracking Area/Routing Area/Location area where the MDT
> data collection shall take place, the optional attribute plmnList allows to
> specify the PLMNs where measurement collection, status indication and log
> reporting is allowed, the optional attribute areaConfigurationForNeighCell
> allows to specify the area for which UE is requested to perform measurements
> logging for neighbour cells which have list of frequencies and the optional
> attribute sensorInformation allows to specify the sensor information to
> include.
\- In case of RLF_REPORT_ONLY and RCEF_REPORT_ONLY the optional attribute
areaScope allows to specify the eNB or list of eNBs or gNB or list of gNBs
where the reports should be collected.
\- In case of LOGGED_MBSFN_MDT additionally the following attributes shall be
available: anonymizationOfMDTData, loggingInterval, loggingDuration,
mBSFNAreaList.
Reporting of measurements and messages can be periodical, event triggered or
event triggered periodic depending on the selected job type.
\- For trace the reporting is event based, where the triggering event is
configured with attribute triggeringEvents. For each triggering event the
first and last message (start/stop triggering event) to record are specified.
\- For immediate MDT, the reporting is dependent on the configured
measurements:
\- For measurement M1 in LTE or NR, it is possible to select between
periodical, event triggered, event triggered periodic reporting or reporting
according to all configured RRM event triggers. For M1 and M2 measurement in
UMTS, it is possible to select between periodical, event triggered reporting
or reporting according to all configured RRM event triggers. Parameter
reportingTrigger determines which of the reporting methods is selected and in
case of event triggered or event-triggered periodic, which is the decisive
event type. For periodical reporting, parameters reportInterval and
reportAmount determine the interval between two successive reports and the
number of reports. This means the periodical reporting terminates after
reportAmount reports have been sent as long as reportAmount is configured with
a value different from infinity. For event-triggered periodic reporting, these
two parameters apply in addition to parameter eventThreshold which determines
the threshold of the event. In this case up to reportAmount reports are sent
with a periodicity of reportInterval after the entering condition is
fulfilled. The reporting is stopped, if the leaving condition is fulfulled and
is restarted if the configured event reoccurs. For event based reporting,
there is only one report sent after the event occurs. The parameters to
configure are reportingTrigger and eventThreshold. In case of UMTS and 1f
event reporting, additionally parameter measurementQuantity is necessary in
order to determine for which measurement(s) the event threshold is applicable.
\- For measurement M2 in LTE or NR, reporting is according to RRM
configuration, see TS 38.321 [36], TS 36.321 [37] and TS 38.331 [38], TS
36.331 [39]. For measurement M4 in UMTS, reporting is either according to RRM
configuration, see TS 25.321 [40] and TS 25.331 [41] or periodic or event
triggered periodic using parameter collectionPeriodRRMUMTS and
eventThresholdUphUMTS.
\- For measurement M3 in UMTS, the reporting is done upon availability, see TS
37.320 [43].
\- For measurements M4, M5, M6 and M7 in NR, for measurements M3, M4, M5, M6
and M7 in LTE and for measurements M5, M6 and M7 in UMTS periodical reporting
is applied. The configurable parameter is the interval between two
measurements (collectionPeriodRRMNR, collectionPeriodM6NR,
collectionPeriodM7NR, collectionPeriodRRMLTE, measurementPeriodLTE,
collectionPeriodM6LTE, collectionPeriodM7LTE, collectionPeriodRRMUMTS,
measurementPeriodUMTS). If no collection period is configured for M5 in UMTS,
all available measurements are logged according to RRM configuration.
\- For logged MDT in UMTS and LTE, the reporting is periodical. Parameter
loggingInterval determines the interval between the reports and parameter
loggingDuration determines how long the configuration is valid meaning after
this duration has passed no further reports are sent. In NR, the reporting can
be periodical or event based, determined by parameter reportType. For
periodical reporting the same parameters as in LTE and UMTS apply. For event
based reporting, parameter eventListForEventTriggeredMeasurement configures
the event type, namely 'out of coverage' or 'L1 event'. In case 'L1 event' is
selected as event type, the logging is performed according to parameter
loggingInterval at regular intervals only when the conditions indicated by
eventThreshold L1, hysteresis L1, timeToTrigger L1 (defining the thresholds,
hysteresis and time to trigger) are met and if UE is 'camped normally' state
(TS 38.331 [38], TS 38.304 [42]). In case 'out of coverage' is selected as
event type, the logging is performed according to parameter loggingInterval at
regular intervals only when the UE is in 'any cell selection' state.
Furthermore, logging is performed immediately upon transition from the 'any
cell selection' state to the 'camped normally' state ( TS 38.331 [38], TS
38.304 [42]).
Creation and deletion of TraceJob instances by MnS consumers is optional; when
not supported, the TraceJob instances may be created and deleted by the system
or be pre-installed.

#### 4.3.30.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 4.5 are valid for this IOC, without
exceptions.
### 4.3.31 PerfMetricJob
#### 4.3.31.1 Definition
This IOC represents a performance metric production job. It can be name-
contained by SubNetwork, ManagedElement, or _ManagedFunction_.
To activate the production of the specified performance metrics, a MnS
consumer needs to create a PerfMetricJob instance on the MnS producer. For
ultimate deactivation of metric production, the MnS consumer should delete the
job to free up resources on the MnS producer.
For temporary suspension of metric production, the MnS consumer can manipulate
the value of the administrative state attribute. The MnS producer may disable
metric production as well, for example in overload situations. This situation
is indicated by the MnS producer with setting the operational state attribute
to disabled. When production is resumed the operational state is set back to
enabled.
The jobId attribute can be used to associate metrics from multiple
PerfMetricJob instances. The jobId can be included when reporting performance
metrics to allow a MnS consumer to associate received metrics for the same
purpose. For example, it is possible to configure the same jobId value for
multiple PerfMetricJob instances required to produce the measurements for a
specific KPI.
The attribute performanceMetrics defines the performance metrics to be
produced and the attribute granularityPeriod defines the granularity period to
be applied.
All object instances below and including the instance name-containing the
PerfMetricJob (base object instance) are scoped for performance metric
production. Performance metrics are produced only on those object instances
whose object class matches the object class associated to the performance
metrics to be produced.
The optional attributes objectInstances and rootObjectInstances allow to
restrict the scope. When the attribute objectInstances is present, only the
object instances identified by this attribute are scoped. When the attribute
rootObjectInstances is present, then the subtrees whose root objects are
identified by this attribute are scoped. Both attributes may be present at the
same time meaning the total scope is equal to the sum of both scopes. Object
instances may be scoped by both the objectInstances and rootObjectInstances
attributes. This shall not be considered as an error by the MnS producer.
When the performance metric requires performance metric production on multiple
managed objects, which is for example the case for KPIs, the MnS consumer
needs to ensure all required objects are scoped. Otherwise a PerfMetricJob
creation request shall fail.
The attribute reportingCtrl specifies the method and associated control
parameters for reporting the produced measurements to MnS consumers. Three
methods are available: file-based reporting with selection of the file
location by the MnS producer, file-based reporting with selection of the file
location by the MnS consumer and stream-based reporting.
For file-based reporting, all performance metrics that are produced related to
a \"PerfMetricJob\" instance for a reporting period shall be stored in a
single reporting file.
When the administrative state is set to \"UNLOCKED\" after the creation of a
\"PerfMetricJob\" the first granularity period shall start. When the
administrative state is set to \"LOCKED\" or the operational state to
\"DISABLED\", the ongoing reporting period shall be aborted, for streaming the
ongoing granularity period. When the administrative state is set back to
\"UNLOCKED\" or the operational state to \"ENABLED\" a new reporting period
period shall start, in case of streaming a new granularity period.
Changes of all other configurable attributes shall take effect only at the
beginning of the next reporting period, for streaming at the beginning of the
next granularity period.
When the \"PerfMetricJob\" is deleted, the ongoing reporting period shall be
aborted, for streaming the ongoing granularity period.
A PerfMetricJob creation request shall be rejected, if the requested
performance metrics, the requested granularity period, the requested repoting
method, or the requested combination thereof is not supported by the MnS
producer.
Creation and deletion of PerfMetricJob instances by MnS consumers is optional;
when not supported, PerfMetricJob instances may be created and deleted by the
system or be pre-installed.
#### 4.3.31.2 Attributes

This \> defines the method for reporting collected performance
metrics to MnS consumers as well as the parameters for configuring the
reporting function. It is a choice between the control parameter required for
the reporting methods, whose presence selects the reporting method as follows:
When only the fileReportingPeriod attribute is present, the MnS producer shall
store files on the MnS producer at a location selected by the MnS producer
and, on condition that an appropriate subscription is in place, inform the MnS
consumer about the availability of new files and the file location using the
notifyFileReady notification. In case the preparation of a file fails,
\"notifyFilePreparationError\" shall be sent instead.
When only the fileReportingPeriod and fileLocation attributes are present, the
MnS producer shall store the files on a MnS consumer, that can be any entity
such as a file server, at the location specified by fileLocation. No
notification is emitted by the MnS producer.
When only the streamTarget attribute is present, the MnS producer shall stream
the data to the location specified by streamTarget.
For the file-based reporting methods the fileReportingPeriod attribute
specifies the time window during which collected measurements are stored into
the same file before the file is closed and a new file is opened.
