identified in [3]), in particular:
  * The altitude of the spacecraft(s) (several hundred to several tens of thousands of kilometres), leading to a regional (multiple countries) or worldwide coverage by the satellite access network.
  * The possibility to support end-to-end overlay access network, on a global scale basis, including with the possibility to embark gNBs, or parts of gNBs on board spacecraft.
# 1 Scope
The scope of this document is:
  * to identify the main key issues associated with business roles, service and network management and orchestration of a 5G network with integrated satellite component(s) (whether as NG-RAN or non-3GPP access, or for transport), and
  * to study the associated solutions.
This study aims at minimising the impacts and complexity of satellite
integration in the existing business models and in management and
orchestration aspects of the current 5G networks.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**Geostationary (GEO) satellites** : located precisely in the plane of the
Equator at an altitude of 35,786 km, these satellites rotate at the same rate
as the Earth\'s rotation: a GEO satellite stands still with respect to Earth.
Thanks to this property, a single GEO satellite is sufficient to create a
continuous coverage.
**Non-Geostationary Orbiting (NGSO) satellites** : NGSO satellites do not
stand still with respect to Earth. Should service continuity be required over
time, a number of satellites (a constellation) is required to meet this
requirement; the lower the altitude the higher the number of satellites.
**Low-Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites** : with altitude ranging from 500 km to
2,000 km, and with inclination angle of the orbital plane ranging from 0 to
more than 90 degrees. These constellations are placed above the International
Space Station and debris, and below the first Van Allen belt.
**Medium-Earth Orbiting (MEO) satellites** : with altitude ranging from 8,000
to 20,000 km. The inclination angle of the orbital plane ranges from 0 to more
than 90 degrees. These constellations are placed above the Van Allen belts.
**Highly-Eccentric Orbiting (HEO) satellites** : with a range of operational
altitudes (the orbit of such satellites being designed for the spacecraft to
be exploited when the vehicle is closer to its apogee \- the higher part of
the orbit -) between 7,000 km and more than 45,000 km. The inclination angle
is selected so as to compensate, completely or partially, the relative motion
of Earth with respect to the orbital plane, allowing the satellite to cover
successively different parts of Northern land masses (e.g. Western Europe,
North America, and Northern Asia).

# 4 Concepts and Background
## 4.1 Reference management architecture for integrated satellite components
### 4.1.1 Management architecture for integrated satellite NR-RAT
The reference architecture depicted in figure 4.4.1-1 considers the case of a
3GPP RAN integrating a satellite NR-RAT, possibly together with a Terrestrial
RAT. The NOP operates the 5G network interfacing through API's with
Communication Service Customers or Verticals on the one hand and delivering
services to UEs on the other hand. The 3GPP Management system manages the 3GPP
RAN.
Figure 4.1.1-1: Reference architecture for the management of a satellite NR-
RAT.
### 4.1.2 Management architecture for integrated non-3GPP satellite RAN
The reference architecture depicted in the following figure considers the case
of a non-3GPP satellite RAN integrated in a 5G network. The NOP operates the
5G network interfacing through API's with Communication Service Customers or
Verticals on the one hand and delivering services to UEs on the other hand.
The 3GPP management system manages the 3GPP RAN and the non-3GPP RAN.
Figure 4.1.2-1: Reference architecture for the management of a non-3GPP
satellite RAN
## 4.2 Architecture scenarios for 5G networks with an integrated satellite
component
### 4.2.1 Scenario #1: Satellite enabled 3GPP network as a roaming network for
terrestrial network operators
Consider two separate 3GPP networks, one 3GPP network with a satellite access
network and one 3GPP network with a terrestrial access network. Both networks
have their own PLMN ID and have a roaming agreement in place with each other.
Roaming is used by the terrestrial operator to use the 3GPP network with a
satellite access. Both the satellite and terrestrial network have their own
separate 3GPP management domain.
NOTE: This scenario follows the architecture identified in the Satellite
access class scenario in section 4.1.3 from 3GPP TR 23.737 [5].

**Figure 4.2.1-1: Architecture of satellite 3GPP network (green) as roaming
network to a terrestrial 3GPP network (blue)**
NOTE: The green and blue networks are separate management domains.
### 4.2.2 Scenario #2: A 3GPP network with a satellite access network and a
terrestrial access network
In this scenario a 3GPP network is composed out of a 3GPP core network, a
terrestrial 3GPP access network and a satellite 3GPP access network, where the
satellite component is also integrated as a 3GPP access network. The satellite
network and the terrestrial network both share the same PLMN and both access
networks are managed by the same 3GPP management system. This architecture
scenario follows the Satellite access class scenario in section 4.1.1 from
3GPP TR 23.737 [5].

# 5 Use Cases
## 5.1 Use cases related to network slice management
### 5.1.1 Network slice instance(s) associated with a satellite RAN
#### 5.1.1.1 Create a network slice instance associated with a satellite RAN
##### 5.1.1.1.1 Pre-conditions
A NOP wants an NSI which includes a 5GC and a Satellite RAN. The Satellite RAN
is associated with either a Satellite NR-RAT, or can be non-3GPP Satellite
RAT.
##### 5.1.1.1.2 Description
In some cases, the satellite coverage can be as large as the whole world, or
can be regional (i.e. covering several countries). In some cases, the latency
of the satellite RAN can be significant, from few tens of ms (for LEO) to
several hundreds of ms (see Informative Annex A). Further, the description of
the Satellite RAN can vary according to its characteristics.
The NOP wants an NSI to support a communication service and the NSI to support
to the description of the satellite RAN characteristics.
##### 5.1.1.1.3 Post-conditions
An NSI which includes CN part and RAN part is created, taking into account the
specific characteristics of the satellite RAN.
### 5.1.2 RAN sharing of a 5G network with satellite components
##### 5.1.2.1 Pre-conditions
A 5G System is composed of a satellite component, that may include:
\- A number of spacecraft, each composed of RUs, possibly gNB-DUs, gNB-CUs
\- A number of Earth radio stations located on ground, interconnected with the
spacecrafts, each composed of RUs and possibly connected to gNB-DUs and/or
gNB-CUs.
The satellite component is interconnected with a 5GC.
It is specified in TS 22.261 that: "a 5G satellite access network shall
support NG-RAN sharing".
A number of NOPs want to share the 5G satellite access network and certain
NOPs want to have Network Slicing enabled in the satellite components.
##### 5.1.2.2 Description
The satellite on-board resources are managed by a satellite NOP, to allow the
distribution of the limited RF power and bandwidth resources (for a RU), as
well as for the power consumption and network resources for the digital
processing units. A satellite NOP can therefore act also as VISP (and/or a
Data Center Service Provider (for the spaceborne part)). A NOP that is allowed
access to the satellite components will be allowed to manage slice
configurations in the shared satellite RAN.
##### 5.1.2.3 Post-conditions
The satellite components are configured to support multiple NOPs and NSIs are
created for each NOP according to their requirements (bandwidth, connectivity,
coverage, etc.) and according to the capabilities of each spacecraft and of
the combined capabilities of the network.
### 5.1.3 Handling of latencies associated with satellite components
#### 5.1.3.1 Creating and managing sliced associated with satellite components
##### 5.1.3.1.1 Pre-conditions
A 5G System is composed of a satellite component, that may include:
\- a Geostationary-satellite network on the Radio Access part,
\- a global LEO access network on the Radio access part, creating potentially
a global overlay.
Further, satellite backhaul can be used for transport between 5G-CN functions
and RAN functions.
These conditions generate latencies between UEs and the 5G-CN that can be
higher or lower than those that could be met if a terrestrial network (radio
or fiber) would be used for access or transport.
##### 5.1.3.1.2 Description
In TS 22.261, it is specified that a 5G system with satellite access shall
support different configurations where the radio access network is either a
satellite NG-RAN or a non-3GPP satellite access network, or both.
It is further required that:
  * The 5G system with satellite access shall support the use of satellite links between the radio access network and core network, by enhancing the 3GPP system to handle the latencies introduced by satellite backhaul.
  * A 5G system with satellite access shall be able to support meshed connectivity between satellites interconnected with inter-satellite links.
For a 5G system with satellite access, the following requirement also applies:
  * A 5G system with satellite access shall be able to select the communication link providing the UE with the connectivity that most closely fulfils the agreed QoS.
Operator wants an NSI to support a communication service and the associated
Network Slice that offer the best service options.
##### 5.1.3.1.3 Post-conditions
An NSI which includes CN part and RAN part is created, taking into account the
specific characteristics of the satellite RAN and backhaul characteristics.
The performances of the satellite components are monitored to ensure that the
performances of the NSI can be delivered as planned.
### 5.1.4 Network slice instance(s) associated with both a Satellite RAN and a
Terrestrial RAN
### 5.1.4.1 Pre-conditions
A NOP wants to instantiate an NSI which includes a 5GC, a 3GPP Satellite RAN
and a 3GPP Terrestrial RAN. The Satellite RAN is connected to the 5GC with the
use of RAN sharing.
### 5.1.4.2 Description
A satellite network could be used to the extend the coverage of an existing
terrestrial 3GPP network. When the Satellite RAN is connected to a 5GC by
using RAN sharing and therefore is connected to the same 5GC, the NOP may want
to deploy a single NSI spanning the Satellite RAN, Terrestrial RAN and 5GC.
Moreover, a NOP may want to specify different network slice service
requirements (data rate, latency, etc.) for the Satellite RAN and Terrestrial
RAN in the same NSI, due to the specific Satellite RAN characteristics.

Figure 5.1.4-1: An NSI spanning both a Satellite RAN and a terrestrial RAN
with two examples of network slice service requirements
Note: There may be more than one network slice service requirement for the
Satellite RAN, terrestrial RAN and 5GC.
### 5.1.4.3 Post-conditions
An NSI is created which spans both the Satellite RAN and the terrestrial RAN,
with specific network slice service requirements for Satellite RAN and
Terrestrial RAN domains.

regenerative satellite(s) to the SaT/UE, as illustrated in Annex B.2.
The 5G network management is implemented in such a way that moving
regenerative satellite components could be managed.
#### 5.2.2.3 Post-description

component(s).
## 5.3 Use cases for monitoring of satellite components
### 5.3.1 Use case for monitoring of performances of NGSO satellite components
with split gNBs
#### 5.3.1.1 Goal
When considering an NGSO satellite component with split gNB, the goal is to
allow the monitoring of average packet delays on the RAN, as delays would be
varying between gNB-DUs and gNB-CUs.
#### 5.3.1.2 Pre-conditions
A NOP operates a 5G network.
The NOP monitors the 5G network performances in accordance with the 5G
specifications.
The NOP integrates a satellite component. NGSO satellites embark gNB-DUs on
board, gNB-CUs are located on ground (see Annex B of this document).
As the NGSO satellites move along their orbit, the distance between the gNB-
DUs embarked on the satellites and the served CUs varies significantly.
#### 5.3.1.3 Description
The monitoring the packet delay is implemented in a such a way so that the
varying distance between the gNB-DUs and the gNB-CUs are taken into account.
KPIs such as Average delay DL, CU-UP, Average delay on F1-U, Average delay DL
in gNB-DU, are monitored.
#### 5.3.1.4 Post-description
The 5G network can monitor the performances of NGSO satellite components with
split gNBs.
### 5.3.2 Use case for monitoring of average delay on DL-Air Interface for MEO
and GEO satellite components
#### 5.3.2.1 Goal

a MEO or GEO satellite component for which the HARQ process has been modified
with respect to a terrestrial RAN.
#### 5.3.2.2 Pre-conditions

The 5G network as operated by the NOP satellite RAN supporting NR
#### 5.3.2.3 Description
To cope with the effects of satellite delay and associated RTT, the HARQ
operation is disabled or modified when compared to terrestrial RAN.
The management system of the 5G network is designed to provide a measured of
the average delay on DL-Air Interface for MEO and GEO satellite components
without an HARQ process.
#### 5.3.2.4 Post-description
The management system monitors the average delay on the DL-Air Interface for
MEO and GEO satellite components.
### 5.3.3 Multi-RAT load-balancing associated with both a Satellite RAN and a
Terrestrial RAN
### 5.3.3.1 Pre-conditions
A NOP wants to optimize resource usage of multi-RATs by supporting load-
balancing between satellite RANs and terrestrial RANs. The Satellite RAN and
Terrestrial RAN are connected to the 5GC with the use of RAN sharing.
A NOP provides the following capabilities: radio resource management and
traffic flow control in RAN, multi-RAT resource control in 5GC, and multi-RAT
resource management in 3GPP Management.
### 5.3.3.2 Description
For efficient multi-RATs load balancing, the following capabilities and
procedures are applied across different parts of 5GS. Figure 5.3.3-1 shows
capabilities required for the load balancing.
{width="6.694444444444445in" height="3.0208333333333335in"}
**Figure 5.3.3-1: Capabilities for Multi-RATs load-balancing for Satellite and
terrestrial RANs**
Both satellite and terrestrial 3GPP NR RANs have capabilities of its own radio
resource management (e.g., dynamic selection of the appropriate radio bearers)
and traffic flow control which dynamically decides, for each in progress
connection, the traffic bit rates that have to be managed by each cell of the
gNB. The 5GC has multi-RATs resource control capability which performs optimal
load-balancing control of multi-RATs. 3GPP Management includes multi-RAT
resource management capability which coordinates with multi-RAT resource
control capability in 5GC for optimal multi-RAT load-balancing.
Multi-RAT load-balancing procedure may follow the following steps:
  1. UE connection procedure to the selected RAT is performed based on the connection profile information such as UE type, service type, and user's connection preferences, etc.
  2. When a connection is setup, uplink and downlink traffic is sent from/to the UE
  3. UE sends measurement report about radio link periodically during the connection to the multi-RAT resource control module
  4. The multi-RAT resource control module decides load-balancing policy based on the reports, the traffic is switched from the currently active RAT to another RAT by the traffic flow control when load-balancing is required
> 5\. At the end of the connection, each UE sends feedback about the quality
> of connection and the connection profile information is updated accordingly.
> The same information is also sent to multi-RAT resource management module in
> 3GPP management system
### 5.1.3.3 Post-conditions
Optimal Multi-RAT load-balancing is completed across both the Satellite RAN
and the terrestrial RAN, with specific multi-RAT resource usage requirements
for Satellite RAN and Terrestrial RAN domains. As a result, the following
improvement can be achieved:
  * Improvement of the overall data rates (throughput) to mobile UEs in 5G networks for both DL and UL.
  * Improvement of the optimal exploitation of 5G network resources while meeting the 5G KPIs.
  * Guarantee of service continuity (reliability) in mobile UEs

###### ### Annex A: Characteristics of satellite systems
# A.1 General
This annex describes the main characteristics of satellite systems when
considering their integration with the 5G system.
# A.2 Class of orbit
On the one hand, our planet attracts as a main body the much smaller
satellite, which motion is dictated as a consequence by the laws of Kepler. On
the other hand, the environment of Earth can be also constraining: the higher
density of the atmosphere, debris from launchers and former satellites in the
lower altitudes, as well as higher energy particles trapped in the Van Allen
belts between 2,000 and 8,000 km\'s altitudes are to be avoided. These two
constraints contribute to defining several classes of orbits that are used for
communication satellites:
**\- Geostationary** (GEO) satellites, located precisely in the plane of the
Equator at an altitude of 35,786 km, these satellites rotate at the same rate
as the Earth\'s rotation: a GEO satellite stands still with respect to Earth.
Thanks to this property, a single GEO satellite is sufficient to create a
continuous coverage.
**\- Non-Geostationary Orbiting** (NGSO) satellites: NGSO satellites do not
stand still with respect to Earth. Should service continuity be required over
time, a number of satellites (a constellation) is required to meet this
requirement; the lower the altitude the higher the number of satellites.
Different classes of NGSO satellites are listed below:
\- **Low-Earth Orbiting** (LEO) satellites, with altitude ranging from 500 km
to 2,000 km, and with inclination angle of the orbital plane ranging from 0 to
more than 90 degrees. These constellations are placed above the International
Space Station and debris, and below the first Van Allen belt.
\- **Medium-Earth Orbiting** (MEO) satellites, with altitude ranging from
8,000 to 20,000 km. The inclination angle of the orbital plane ranges from 0
to more than 90 degrees. These constellations are placed above the Van Allen
belts.
\- **Highly-Eccentric Orbiting** (HEO) satellites, with a range of operational
altitudes (the orbit of such satellites being designed for the spacecraft to
be exploited when the vehicle is closer to its apogee \- the higher part of
the orbit -) between 7,000 km and more than 45,000 km. The inclination angle
is selected so as to compensate, completely or partially, the relative motion
of Earth with respect to the orbital plane, allowing the satellite to cover
successively different parts of Northern land masses (e.g. Western Europe,
North America, and Northern Asia).

# A.3 Geometrical coverage of satellite and propagation delay
As depicted in the following figure, the theoretical geometrical coverage of a
satellite is associated to its altitude and the minimum elevation angle under
which the satellite is seen by the UE above the horizon.

different orbits
NOTE: The above figure provides only examples, some designers may decide to
select lower altitudes as this contribute lowering the propagation delay.
The following table illustrates the number of satellites that are necessary
for a constellation of satellites to provide continuous coverage for an
elevation angle ranging from 5 to 10 degrees. Global coverage may not be fully
achieved for MEO or GEO satellite, however in this case the vast majority of
the world population is covered.

# A.4 Type of satellite communication payloads
Communication payloads embarked on-board a satellite are of two main
categories, for any type of satellite (whether GEO or NGSO):
**\- Transparent payloads** : the electromagnetic waves that are transmitted
from the Earth's surface are converted by a satellite receive antenna into an
electric signal which is channel filtered and amplified by a low-noise
amplifier (LNA). The signal is then frequency converted. A high-power
amplifier (HPA) delivers finally the signal to a transmitting antenna
generating a reconditioned electromagnetic wave towards the Earth surface
where receive station are located.
**\- Regenerative payloads:** an On-Board Processor (OBP), is inserted between
the LNA and the HPA. This OBP allows to convert the air interface between the
uplink (from Earth to satellite) and the down link (from satellite to Earth).
It allows to correct bits or packet in errors before retransmitting them, or
to route packets between beams. Ultimately any network function can be
implemented, at the expense of power and mass, thanks to an OBP (including gNB
CU\'s or DU\'s, or any function attached to a CN).
**\- Inter-Satellite Links (ISL):** can also interconnect regenerative
satellite payloads. Through ISL\'s satellites can be interconnected through a
dedicated mesh-network.
# A.5 Air interfaces
Air interfaces can include:
\- 3GPP defined air interfaces, such as the New Radio;
\- Non-3GPP defined air interfaces
Unless otherwise indicated, 3GPP NR will be assumed in this document.
# A.6 General considerations on the use of satellite networks
In relation to the coverage associated with Non-Geostationary Satellite
Networks, or Geostationary-Satellite ones, the use of satellite networks is
related to:
\- The complement of terrestrial networks where these terrestrial networks are
not available, permanently for physically (maritime or aeronautical
constraints) or economic reasons, or for temporary reasons associated to local
unavailability of a terrestrial of network (drought, Earth quake) or local
overload of the demand;
\- Satellite networks can be used for broadcast over large areas of a same
content, for multicast (with acknowledge of delivery of content), for unicast;
\- Use cases are related to the actual of altitude of the satellite platforms
and the associated delay of propagation.

the 5G System
# B.1 Elementary satellite network architecture
The physical implementation of a satellite network architecture can always be
sketched as displayed in the following figure:
{width="6.496527777777778in" height="1.6409722222222223in"}
Figure B.1-1: Reference Satellite Access Network Architecture
A satellite network is always composed of:
\- One, or more, satellite(s), embarking a telecommunication payload.
\- Satellite enabled UEs, such as IoT devices, broadband vehicular or fixed
terminals.
\- A Hub, including an RF Earth station, and a data centre including (co-
located or not) RAN and CN related functions. The hub is also interconnected
to (a) data network(s).
\- UEs interconnected to the hub through the satellite.
## B.2 Reference architecture with satellite enabled NR-RAN
The following figure depicts a reference architecture for a direct access with
a satellite enabled NR-RAN (see below):
{width="5.511111111111111in" height="0.7708333333333334in"}
Figure B.2-1: 5GS with Satellite enabled NR-RAN
Knowing the possible nature of satellite payloads (transparent or re-
generative), the instantiation of this architecture can have several forms:
In a first implementation, the satellite is transparent, the NR signals are
generated from gNB\'s from a satellite enabled NR-RAN that are located on
ground. The satellite is equivalent to a Radio Frequency (RF) Remote Unit, and
is full transparent to the New Radio protocols, including the physical layer
(see below).
{width="7.030555555555556in" height="1.1222222222222222in"}
Figure B.2-2: 5GS with transparent satellite enabled NR-RAN
In a second implementation, the satellite is regenerative. The satellite
payload implements a gNB-DU as part of a satellite enabled NR-RAN. Some of the
protocols of the NR are processed by the satellite. A Satellite Radio
Interface (SRI) transports the F1 protocol between the on-ground CU and the
on-board DU (it can be the NR (see below)).

Figure B.2-3: 5GS with regenerative satellite enabled NR-RAN and distributed
gNB
In a third implementation, the satellite is regenerative. The satellite
payload implements a full gNB supporting a satellite enabled NR-RAN. A
Satellite Radio Interface (SRI) transports the N1/N2/N3 interfaces between the
on-ground 5G CN and the on-board gNB-CU (see below).
{width="7.190972222222222in" height="0.9770833333333333in"}
Figure B.2-4: 5GS with regenerative satellite enabled NR-RAN and on-board gNB
One can note that with a regenerative implementation (either with distributed
gNB or not) a 5GS can have a global coverage, providing a single 5G CN with
global or regional (continental or sub-continental) coverage as well. This is
valid for GEO or LEO (see below):
{width="5.511111111111111in" height="3.282638888888889in"}
Figure B.2-5: 5GS with regenerative satellite enabled NR-RAN, with ISL for
regional or global coverage
Another configuration (see below) may consist in satellites each embarking a
gNB supporting a satellite enabled NR-RAN, and 5G CN\'s accessing these
gNB\'s, as described in the following figure, where specific (or not)
satellite radio interfaces are used to handle control and user planes:
{width="5.34375in" height="3.2444444444444445in"}
