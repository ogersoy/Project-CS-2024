# 4 Architecture considerations
## 4.1 High level architecture
The high level service based management architecture for Network Slicing
management is specified in TS 28.533 [250] clause 4, with Management Services
(MnS) produced by MnS Producer and consumed by MnS Consumer.
## 4.2 Network Slice Management converged charging architecture
### 4.2.1 High level architecture network slice charging
The scope of the present document is network slice management charging, the
details for other types of network slice charging are defined in TS 32.255
[15] and TS 28.201 [70].
### 4.2.2 Converged charging architecture
Network Slice Management converged charging can be achieved under the
alternatives:
\- Charging Trigger Function (CTF) based, as depicted in figure 4.2.2.1.
\- Charging Enablement Function (CEF) based, depicted in figure 4.2.2.2.
Figure 4.2.2.1: Network Slice Management converged charging architecture (CTF)
Figure 4.2.2.2: Network Slice Management converged charging architecture (CEF)
The Charging Trigger Function (CTF) is specified in TS 32.240 [1].
The Charging Enablement Function (CEF) is defined in TS 28.201 [70]: charging
information addressed by the CEF in the present document, are related to
provisioning for network slices.
The MnS producer is defined in TS 28.533 [250]: the MnS producer in the
present document is the producer of provisioning MnS.
For network slice management converged charging the CEF is a consumer of both:
\- provisioning service (MnS) for network slice exposed by the MnS Producer,
specified in TS 28.532 [253];
\- charging (Nchf) service.
Details on the interfaces and functions can be found in TS 32.240 [1] for the
general architecture components. Ga is described in clause 5.2.4 and Bns in
clause 5.2.5 of the present document, and Nchf is described in TS 32.290 [50].
# 5 Network Slice Management charging principles and scenarios
## 5.1 Network Slice Management charging principles
### 5.1.1 General
The charging functions for the Network Slice Management charging, are based on
provisioning management services used for provisioning of network slice.
The management services are specified under TS 28.533 [250], TS 28.532 [253]
and TS 28.541 [254]. Management services and procedures for provisioning are
described TS 28.531 [252].
How a MnS consumer consumes and is authorized to consume provisioning MnS
produced by the MnS producer, are out of the scope of the present document.
The network slice subscriber is the tenant, i.e. the party for which the
network slice instance(s) is(are) created, satisfying the requirements of
subscribed-to service(s).
NOTE 1: these service(s) requirements may take the form of Service Level
Specification (SLS) per TS 28.530 [251] definition, supplied by external
service providers (e.g. MVNO, Verticals, enterprises), in which case the
tenant is the external service provider.
NOTE 2: these service(s) requirements may be built by a MNO for its own
operational needs, in which case the tenant is the MNO itself, and the tenant
id may not be present.
Depending on the relationship and deployment model between the tenant and the
party owning the MnS producer, the MnS consumer of the provisioning MnS may be
the tenant.
The following provisioning of network slice procedures of clause 7 in TS
28.531 [252] are considered for Network Slice Management charging:
\- Network Slice Instance (NSI) Creation.
\- Network Slice Instance (NSI) Modification.
\- Network Slice Instance (NSI) Termination.
Network Slice Instance (NSI) is defined in TS 28.530 [251].
### 5.1.2 Requirements
The following are high-level charging requirements specific to the Network
Slice Management charging:
\- The CEF shall support converged charging.
\- The CEF shall collect charging information per NSI Creation, Modification
and Termination.
\- The Service Producer (CTF) shall support converged charging.
\- The Service Producer (CTF) shall collect charging information per NSI
Creation, Modification and Termination.
### 5.1.3 Network Slice Management charging information
The charging information for Network Slice Management charging are defined
under the following list:
\- identity of the MnS consumer of provisioning MnS.
\- identity of the tenant, i.e. viewed as the network slice subscriber.
\- operation type invoked by MnS consumer of provisioning MnS.
\- identifier of the Network Slice Instance.
\- network slice related requirements identified by a service profile as
defined in TS 28.531 [252] clause 4.5. and detailed in TS 28.541 [254] clause
6.3.3.
The following non-exhaustive list of information elements of the service
profile are identified for Network Slice Management charging:
\- Service Profile identifier.
> \- S-NSSAI(s).
>
> \- SST.
>
> \- Latency.

### 5.1.4 CHF selection
The CHF selection by the MnS Producer (CTF)/CEF is based on the following
options and with this priority order (highest to lowest):
\- NRF based discovery;
\- pre-configured CHF address(s).
## 5.2 Network Slice Management charging scenarios
### 5.2.1 Basic principles
#### 5.2.1.1 General
Network Slice Management charging is performed by the Service Producer (CTF)
of provisioning MnS or the CEF interacting with CHF using Nchf specified in TS
32.290 [50] and TS 32.291 [51]. In order to provide the data required for the
charging management activities outlined in TS 32.240 [1], the Service Producer
(CTF) or CEF shall be able to perform converged charging for provisioning MnS
when consumed by MnS consumer for NSI allocation, modification and
deallocation.
The Service Producer (CTF) of provisioning MnS or CEF shall be able to perform
converged charging by interacting with CHF, for charging data related to
Network Slice Management. The Charging Data Request and Charging Data Response
are exchanged between the Service Producer (CTF) and the CHF or between the
CEF and the CHF, based on PEC scenarios specified in TS 32.290 [50]. The
Charging Data Request is issued by the Service Producer (CTF) or CEF towards
the CHF when certain conditions (chargeable events) are met.
The CEF shall be able to consume services related to provisioning MnS events,
defined in TS 28.531 [252], for collecting charging information related to
Network Slice Management.
The contents and purpose of each charging event that triggers interaction with
CHF, as well as the chargeable events that trigger them, are described in
clauses 5.2.2.
A detailed formal description of the converged charging parameters to CHF
defined in the present document can be found in TS 32.291 [51].
A detailed formal description of the CDR parameters defined in the present
document can be found in TS 32.298 [57].
Whether network slice management charging is active is configured in MnS
producer or CEF.
#### 5.2.1.2 Applicable triggers in Network Slice Management charging
A set of trigger conditions are defined for the CEF or Service Producer (CTF)
to invoke a Charging Data Request [Event] towards the CHF.
Table 5.2.1.2.1 summarizes the set of default trigger conditions and their
category which shall be supported by the CEF or Service Producer (CTF).
Table 5.2.1.2.1: Default Trigger conditions in CEF or Service Producer (CTF)
Trigger Conditions Trigger level Default category CHF allowed to change
category CHF allowed to enable and disable Message when \"immediate
reporting\" category
* * *
Creation Response sent - Immediate Not Applicable Not Applicable Charging Data
Request [Event] NSI Modification Response sent - Immediate Not Applicable Not
Applicable Charging Data Request [Event] NSI Termination Response sent -
Immediate Not Applicable Not Applicable Charging Data Request [Event]
The CDR generation mechanism processed by the CHF upon receiving Charging Data
Request [Event] issued by the CEF or Service Producer (CTF) for these
chargeable events, is specified in clause 5.2.3.
### 5.2.2 Message flows
#### 5.2.2.1 General
The management services for network slice provisioning, specified in TS 28.531
[252], enables its consumer to request allocating, deallocating or modifying
an NSI. There following operations are defined to enable this: createMOI,
deleteMOI, getMOIAttributes, modifyMOIAttributes, allocateNsi and
deallocateNsi. Use of any of these operations, with the exception of
getMOIAttributes, can be subscribed to for charging purposes.
The CEF shall use this subscription possibility to get notifications based on
the operations used and filtered for network slice.
The flows in the present document specify the interaction between an MnS
producer with a CTF and the CHF for Network Slice Management charging
functionality, in some scenarios, based on TS 28.531 [252] clause 7 procedures
and flows.
The table 5.2.2.1.1 describes the mapping between the messages used in the
flows, and the Operations specified in TS 28.531 [252].
