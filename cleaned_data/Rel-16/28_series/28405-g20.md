# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
TS 28.404: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Concepts, use
cases and requirements\";
**TS 28.405: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Control and
configuration\";**
TS 28.406: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Information
definition and transport\".
One main motivation of mobile network evolution is to improve the user
experience, which is why the evaluation of the user experience at the UE side
is vital to network operators. This is especially true when the operators
provide high bit rate real-time services like streaming services (typically
video services), where even intermittent quality degradation is very annoying.
Many of these streaming services are a significant part of the commercial
traffic growth rate, therefore the focus is on the end users\' experience.
Quality of Experience (QoE) information collection provides detailed
information at session level on a number of UEs.
The capability to log information within a UE, and in particular the QoE of an
end user service, initiated by an operator, provides the operator with QoE
information. The collected information (specified in 3GPP TS 26.247 [6])
cannot be deduced from performance measurements in the mobile network.
The QoE information is information collected by the end user application in
the UE.
The QoE information is collected by the management system for analysis and/or
KPI calculations.
# 1 Scope
The present document addresses the mechanisms used for the function Quality of
Experience (QoE) measurement collection in UMTS and LTE. The measurements that
are collected are DASH [6] and MTSI [7] measurements.
The function includes collecting QoE information from UEs frequenting a
specified area or an individual UE for a specified end user service/end user
service type. The document describes the activation and deactivation of a
network request session, UE request session and recording session and also the
reporting of recorded information [2].

# 4 Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection
## 4.1 _Management based activation in UTRAN_
### 4.1.1 Activation of measurement collection job and reporting of collected
information in UTRAN
The parameters for the network request session are sent from the management
system to the RNCs that host the cells that are included in the collection job
request in the activateAreaQMCJob operation [3]. The RNC starts a network
request session, with the Network request session id [3] given in
activateAreaQMCJob operation [3]. For the duration of the network request
session, the RNC(s) checks for connections where the UE has the UE Application
Layer Measurement Capability [10]. The UE Application Layer Measurement
Capability is sent from the UE to RNC (via the core network) in message
INITIAL UE MESSAGE [10].
When a session is found that has a UE with the UE Application Layer
Measurement Capability, the RNC starts a UE request session by sending a
MEASUREMENT CONTROL message [4] to the UE via the NB.
The AT command +CAPPLEVMC [5] activates provisioning of measurement reporting
from the lower layers to the application within the UE by an unsolicited
result code +CAPPLEVMC. When information about a measurement report is
received in the UE from the network, the unsolicited result code +CAPPLEVMC
contains the relevant parameters (service_type, start_stop-indication and
config-file & config-file length if applicable) that are provided from the
lower layers in the UE to the application.

4\. When a connection is found that has the UE Application Layer Measurement
Capability [10], the RNC start a UE request session and stores the associated
QoECollectionEntityAddress, sends the message RRCConnectionReconfiguration to
the UE, and includes the following: serviceType, qoEReference and QMC
configuration file.
5\. The access stratum in the UE sends the AT command +CAPPLEVMC to
application level and includes the following: serviceType, qoEReference and

### 4.1.2 Handling of measurement collection at handover in UTRAN
#### 4.1.2.1 Handover between cells within an RNC
When handover is made, the measurement area is checked.
\- If the mobile is inside the measurement area after the handover, the RNC
sends in an indication that the UE is inside the measurement area in the
RRCConnectionReconfiguration message [4] to the UE. The UE send the +CAPPLEVMC
AT command [5] to the application to inform that recording shall start if the
application becomes active (when the UE moves into the measurement area).
\- If the mobile has moved outside the measurement area, there is no
indication that the UE is inside the measurement area in the
RRCConnectionReconfiguration message [4] from the RNC to the UE. The UE sends
the +CAPPLEVMC AT command [5] to the application to inform that recording
shall not be started even if the application becomes active.
#### 4.1.2.2 Handover between RNCs

to the NM.
11\. When the QMC is completed, the recorded information is collected in a QMC
report [6] and [7]. including qoEReference and recordingSessionId. The
qoEReference, Client Id [6] and [7] in the reporting container (that represent
the UE request session) and recordingSessionId are needed in the QoE
collection entity for post processing purposes.
12\. The application layer sends the AT command +CAPPLEVMR including

### 4.1.3 Deactivation of measurement collection job in UTRAN
#### 4.1.3.1 Forced deactivation in UTRAN
If the operator technician or the management application wants to deactivate a
measurement collection job before the pre-set time has expired, the management
system sends the deactivateQMCJob operation [3] to the RNC. The RNC sets the
network request session to ended, but does not delete the UE request session
id and the Collection Entity Address parameters [3], as the UE still may send
reports which shall be send to the collection centre. For UE request sessions
which have reported that a recording session is started, the RNC sends the
MeasurementControl message [4] with the DeactivateJob request to relevant UEs.
The Access stratum sends +CAPPLEVMC AT command [5] to the application with the
DeactivateJob request. The application stops the recording session and stops
recording of the requested information. The UE request session id and the
Collection Entity Address parameters [3] in the RNC are deleted when the UE
request session is ended.
#### 4.1.3.2 Deactivation of recording session in UTRAN
Regardless of whether the pre-set time has elapsed or not, the recording
session continues to be active until the session for the application is ended.
## 4.2 _Management based activation in LTE_
### 4.2.1 Activation of measurement collection job and reporting of collected
information in LTE
The parameters for the network request session are sent from the management
system to the eNBs that host the cells that are included in the collection job
request in the activateAreaQMCJob operation [3]. The eNB starts a network
request session, with the Network request session id [3] given in
activateAreaQMCJob operation [3]. For the duration of the network request
session, the eNB(s) checks for connections where the UE has the QoE-MeasReport
capability [8] for collection of streaming services or the QoE-MTSI-MeasReport
capability [8] for collection of MTSI services. The UE capability is sent from
the UE to eNB via the core network in message UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION
[9].
When a session is found that has a UE with the wanted UE capability, the eNB
starts a UE request session and sends a RRCConnectionReconfiguration [8] to
the UE.
The AT command +CAPPLEVMC [5] activates provisioning of measurement reporting
from the lower layers to the application within the UE by an unsolicited
result code +CAPPLEVMC. When information about a measurement report is
received in the UE from the network, the unsolicited result code +CAPPLEVMC
contains the relevant parameters (service_type, start_stop-indication and
config-file & config-file length if applicable) that are provided from the
lower layers in the UE to the application.

### 4.2.3 Deactivation of measurement collection job in LTE
#### 4.2.3.1 Forced deactivation
When the operator technician or the management application wants to deactivate
a measurement collection job, the management system sends the deactivateQMCJob
operation [3] to the eNB. The eNB sets the network request session to ended,
but does not delete the UE request session id and the Collection Entity
Address parameters [3], as the UE still may send reports which shall be send
to the collection centre. For UE request sessions which have reported that a
recording session is started, the eNB sends the RRCConnectionReconfiguration
message [8] to relevant UEs. The RRCConnectionReconfiguration message is
including _measConfigAppLayer_ set to discard application layer measurement
report information in _otherConfig [8]_. The Access stratum sends +CAPPLEVMC
AT command [5] to the application with the discard request. The application
stops the recording session and stops recording of the requested information.
The UE request session id and the Collection Entity Address parameters [3] in
the eNB are deleted when the UE request session is ended.

### 4.2.4 Void
# 5 Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement management parameters
## 5.1 QoE collection entity address (M)
This is a parameter which defines the IP address to which the QMC records
shall be transferred. Ipv4 or Ipv6 address(es) may be used.
## 5.2 QoE reference (M)
The QoE reference parameter specify the network request session. The QoE
reference shall be globally unique therefore it is composed as follows:
MCC+MNC+QMC ID, where the MCC and MNC are coming with the QMC activation
request from the management system to identify one PLMN containing the
management system, and QMC ID is a 3 byte Octet String.
The QMC ID is generated by the management system or the operator.
It is used to identify the QoE measurement collection job in the traffic nodes
and in the measurement collection centre.
## 5.3 PLMN target (CM)
This parameter defines the PLMN for which sessions shall be selected in the
network request session in case of area based QMC when several PLMNs are
supported in the RAN (this means that shared cells and not shared cells are
allowed for the specified PLMN. Furthermore, several PLMNs can be used for not
shared RAN cases as well as for shared RAN cases.). Only the sessions may be
selected where the PLMN that the UE reports as selected PLMN is the same as
the PLMN Target.
Note that the PLMN Target might differ from the PLMN specified in the Network
Request Session Id, as that specifies the PLMN that is containing the
management system requesting the Network Request Session from the NE.
The parameter is mandatory if network sharing is deployed.
## 5.4 Area scope (CM)
The area scope parameter defines the area in terms or cells or Tracking
Area/Routing Area/Location Area where the QMC shall take place. If the
parameter is not present the QMC shall be done throughout the PLMN specified
in PLMN target.
The area scope parameter in UMTS is either:
\- List of cells, identified by CGI. Maximum 32 CGI can be defined.
\- List of Routing Area, identified by RAI. Maximum of 8 RAIs can be defined.
\- List of Location Area, identified by LAI. Maximum of 8 LAIs can be defined.
The area scope parameter in LTE is either:
\- list of cells, identified by E-UTRAN-CGI. Maximum 32 CGI can be defined.
\- List of Tracking Area, identified by TAC. Maximum of 8 TAC can be defined.
The parameter is mandatory if area based QMC is requested.
## 5.5 QMC configuration file (container) (M)
The QMC configuration file is a container that is specified in [6] or [7].
## 5.6 QMC target (M)
The QMC target parameter specifies it the QMC is area based or individual UE
based.
\- Area based QMC (0)
NOTE: Individual UE based QMC is not supported in this release.
## 5.7 Recording session id (M)
This parameter shall be a 2 byte octet string. The recording session id shall
be the same for the whole session in the application, while for each different
session in the application the recording session id shall be changed. The
recording session id is generated by the application in the UE.
It is used in the measurement collection centre to identify which session
within a UE has collected information in the application.
## 5.8 Service type (M)
Which kind of service that shall be recorded.
\- DASH (0)
\- MTSI (1)
DASH measurements are specified in [6]. MTSI measurements are specific in [7].
