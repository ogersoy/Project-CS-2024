# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
**TS 28.404: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Concepts,
use cases and requirements\";**
TS 28.405: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Control and
configuration\";
TS 28.406: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Information
definition and transport\";
One main motivation of mobile network evolution is to improve the user
experience, which is why the evaluation of the user experience at the UE side
is vital to network operators. This is especially true when the operators
provide high bit rate real-time services like streaming services (typically
video services), where even intermittent quality degradation is very annoying.
Many of these streaming services are a significant part of the commercial
traffic growth rate, therefore the focus is on the end users\' experience .
Quality of Experience (QoE) information collection provides detailed
information at call level on a number of UEs.
The capability to log information within a UE, and in particular the QoE of an
end user service, initiated by an operator, provides the operator with QoE
information. The collected information (specified in TS 26.247 [2]) cannot be
deduced from performance measurements in the mobile network.
The QoE information is information collected by the end user application in
the UE.
The QoE information is collected by the management system for analysis and/or
KPI calculations.
# 1 Scope
The present document addresses concepts, business level use cases and
requirements for the function Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement
collection in UMTS and LTE. The measurements that are collected are DASH [2]
and MTSI [3] measurements.
The function includes collecting QoE information from UEs frequenting a
specified area .

QoE Quality of Experience
# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 _Concepts_
A network request session is a session in the mobile network when the network
checks for UEs that have the capability to provide requested information.
An UE request session is a session in the network when the network has found
an UE that has the capability to provide the requested information and the
request is forwarded to the UE.
A recording session is a session in the UE when it initiates recording of the
requested end user service/end user service type and record the requested
information.
## 4.2 Background
The collection of QoE information for a specified end user service/end user
service type either from UEs in a specified area . The collected _information_
is transported to a collection centre, where it can be analysed and/or KPIs
can be calculated.
_A collection can be requested by an operator technician via the management
system to the traffic network. As the network do not have any knowledge which
UEs have the capability to record the requested data, therefore the UEs will
report whether they have this capability or not when a session set up. UEs
that has this capability that match the request from the management system
will be requested to start recording the requested information when the
request constraints are met. The UE will make the recorded data available for
management system._

records the requested information for 5% of sessions of the requested service
