# 4 Concepts and background
3GPP mobile network management standards incorporate the Life Cycle Management
(LCM) provided by the ETSI NFV defined NFVO and VNFM functional blocks,
facilitating the installation, dimensioning, layer 2 and 3 interconnection,
healing and recovery of 3GPP-defined network functions that are virtualized.
Some requirements specified in TS 28.500 [2], TS 28.510 [11], TS 28.515 [12],
TS 28.520 [7] and TS 28.525 specifications on telecommunication management for
mobile networks that include virtualized network functions, are related to or
using the LCM exposed by NFVO and VNFM functional blocks. The LCM operation
requests, responses and notifications can carry parameters. In the context of
the 3GPP mobile network management standards, the parameters used in the LCM
operation requests, responses and notifications are not the 3GPP-defined
network function parameters.

#### 5.4.5.1 Introduction
There are several possibilities with regards to providing the initial
configuration data (e.g. IP address of the managing EM) to the VNF in
instantiation use cases. Some of the possibilities (those described in clauses
5.4.5.3.1 and 5.4.5.3.2) rely on functionalities provided by the VNFM while
others (described in clause 5.4.5.2) may be considered independent from the
ETSI NFV defined functional blocks.

target VNF instance to scale, type of scaling and value of scaling as
necessary.
