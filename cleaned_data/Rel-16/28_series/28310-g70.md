# 4 Concepts and overview
## 4.1 EE KPIs Overview
Telecommunication networks energy efficiency KPIs are defined by various SDOs
/ organizations and are of various natures. They can be applied to either:
\- whole networks (i.e. end-to-end), or to
\- sub-networks (e.g. the radio access network), or to
\- single network elements, or to
\- telecommunication sites, which contain network elements and site equipment.
NOTE 1: Data centers used by network operators are considered in the present
document as telecommunication sites.
Moreover, EE KPIs can also be categorized according to the operator\'s network
life cycle phase they may apply to, e.g.:
\- during the Buy phase, mobile network operators may be willing to compare
network elements from various vendors from an EE standpoint. Some EE KPIs and
measurement methods have been specified for this purpose.
\- during the Design / Build phase, mobile network operators are always faced
to several design options, and may be willing to compare them from an EE
standpoint. This may happen for the whole network, sub-networks and for
telecom sites. For telecom sites, EE KPIs have been specified.
\- during the Run phase, mobile network operators need to assess the energy
efficiency of the live network, as a whole (i.e. end-to-end), or for sub-
networks, or for single network elements or telecom sites. Some EE KPIs and
measurement methods have also been specified for this purpose.
NOTE 2: EE KPIs in the present document are only applicable for the Run phase.
Generally, EE KPIs for network elements are expressed in terms of Data Volume
divided by the Energy Consumption of the considered network elements. In the
case of radio access networks, an EE KPI variant may also be used, expressed
by the Coverage Area divided by the Energy Consumption of the considered
network elements.
The calculation of the energy efficiency of 5G networks relies on the
following principles:
\- it is based on the two high-level EE KPIs defined in ETSI ES 203 228 [2]:
\- {width="1.00625in" height="0.42430555555555555in"}, and
\- {width="1.3583333333333334in" height="0.3729166666666667in"}
\- EE~MN,DV~ may apply to the whole 5G network whereas EE~MN,CoA~ may apply
only to NG-RAN;
\- EE~MN,DV~ requires the collection of both Data Volumes (DV) and Energy
Consumption (EC) of 5G Network Functions (NF);
\- In NG-RAN, DV is measured per cell;
\- In 5GC, DV is measured per NF;
\- EC definition and measurement method for 5G PNFs rely on ETSI ES 202 336-1
[3] and ETSI ES 202 336-12 [4];
\- EC is measured by PEE parameters (cf. ETSI ES 202 336-12 [4] -- Annexes A
and B);
\- PEE measurements requirements for all deployment scenario in NG-RAN: The
3GPP management system responsible for the management of the gNB (single or
multiple vendor gNB) shall be able to collect PEE measurements data from all
PNFs in the gNB, in the same way as the other PM measurements;
\- When gNBCU/gNBCU-CP/gNBCU-UP energy consumption is assumed to be very small
compared to gNBDU and given that, in some cases, the gNBCU/gNBCU-CP/gNBCU-UP
may be virtualized, the present document only considers the energy consumed in
gNBDU(s) (in case of split scenarios) and in non-split gNBs (see clause 4.2.1
of 3GPP TS 28.541 [11] and clause 6.1.1 of 3GPP TS 38.401 [12]). There might
be a need for some correction in KPI between the different deployment
scenarios.
NOTE 3: The vendor(s) of 2-split (gNBDU/gNBCU) or 3-split gNB/en-gNB
components (gNBDU/gNBCU-CP/gNBCU-UP) may be same or different depending on the
implementations.
\- EC definition and measurement method for 5G VNFs are not in the scope of
3GPP;
\- In the present document, it is assumed that NG-RAN is only composed of base
stations with built-in sensors (cf. ETSI ES 202 336-12 [4] -- clause 4.4.1).
## 4.2 Management services
The management services required for the assessment of the energy efficiency
of 5G networks are listed below:
\- Performance management services (cf. [5] -- clause 4.3):
\- Measurement job control service for NF.
\- Performance data file reporting service for NF.
\- Performance data streaming service for NF.
\- Management services for network function provisioning (cf. [6] -- clause
6.3):
\- Provisioning for NF.
\- Provisioning data report for NF.
\- Management services for Fault Supervision (cf. [7] -- clause 4.1.1):
\- Fault supervision data report service for NF.
\- Fault supervision data control service for NF.
## 4.3 Energy saving
### 4.3.1 Introduction
Operators are aiming at decreasing power consumption in 5G networks to lower
their operational expense with energy saving management solutions. With the
foreseen deployment of more NR base stations, e.g., small base stations with
massive MIMO in high-band, energy saving becomes even more urgent and
challenging.
Management of 5G networks contributes to energy saving by reducing energy
consumption of 5G networks, while maintaining coverage, capacity and quality
of service. The permitted impact on coverage, capacity and quality of service
is determined by operator\'s decision.
### 4.3.2 Concepts
Two energy saving states can be conceptually identified for cells, NEs and
NFs.
Conceptually, a cell or a network element or network function may be on one of
these two states with respect to energy saving:
\- notEnergySaving state
\- energySaving state
_Based on the above energy saving states, a full energy saving solution
includes two elementary procedures:_
\- Energy saving activation (change from notEnergySaving state to energySaving
state)
\- Energy saving deactivation (change from energySaving state to
notEnergySaving state)
When a cell is in energy saving state it may need candidate cells to pick up
the load. However a cell in energySaving state should not cause coverage holes
or create undue load on the surrounding cells. All traffic on that cell is
expected to be drained to other overlaid/umbrella candidate cells before the
cell moves to energySaving state.
A cell in energySaving state is not considered as a cell outage or a fault
condition. No alarms should be raised for any condition that is a consequence
of a subject cell or network element or network function moving into
energySaving state.

### 5.1.3 Energy saving use cases
#### 5.1.3.1 General
The objective of energy saving is to lower OPEX for mobile operators, through
the reduction of power consumption in the mobile networks that is becoming
more urgent and challenging, as there are much more network elements in NR
(e.g., small cells with massive MIMO in higher frequency bands) than those
used in LTE (TR 37.816 [14], TS 38.300 [13]). One typical scenario of energy
saving is to switch off capacity boosters when the traffic demand is low, and
re-activated them on a need basis (see clause 5.6 in TR 37.816 [14]).
The energy saving consists of two scenarios where the capacity booster cell -
gNB is fully or partially overlaid by the candidate cell(s).
#### 5.1.3.2 Capacity booster cell partially overlaid by candidate cell(s)
##### 5.1.3.2.1 Introduction
Figure 5.1.3.2.1-1 shows that a NR capacity booster cell is partially overlaid
by the gNB or eNB candidate cell(s). There can be two cases of energy saving:
\- Intra-RAT energy saving if the candidate cell is a gNB
\- Inter-RAT energy saving if the candidate cell is an eNB
{width="5.368055555555555in" height="1.4027777777777777in"}

cells

FUN-4, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-5, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-6, REQ-ESCOL-FUN-7.
##### 5.1.3.2.2 Intra-RAT energy saving
Intra-RAT energy saving focuses on a scenario where the gNB candidate cells
provides the coverage for the NR capacity booster cells that is switched off.
Intra-RAT energy saving (ES) consists of distributed energy saving where the
energy saving decision is made in the NR cells with MnS producer(s) assist to
provide relevant information, such as policies, and centralized energy saving
where the energy saving decision is made in MnS producer (see clause 15.4 in
TS 38.300 [13]).
For the distributed energy saving, the NR capacity booster cell may decide to
enter the energy saving mode when it detects that its traffic load is below
certain threshold, and its coverage can be provided by the candidate cells.
However, the NR capacity booster cell can be switched off only after the
handover actions to off-load its traffic to the candidate cells is completed
(see clause 15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]). The candidate cell decides to re-
activate the NR capacity booster cell when it detects additional capacity is
needed (see clause 15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]).
For the centralized energy saving, MnS producer collects the traffic load
performance measurements from the NR capacity booster cell and candidate
cells, and may request a NR capacity booster cell to enter the energy saving
mode when its traffic is below certain threshold. The NR capacity booster may
initiate handover actions to off-load the traffic to the neighbouring cells
(see clause 15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]) prior to entering into the energy saving
mode.
##### 5.1.3.2.3 Inter-RAT energy saving
Inter-RAT energy saving focuses on a scenario where the LTE eNB provides basic
coverage, with the gNB providing the capacity booster that can be switched
off, based on its own cell load information or by MnS producer(s). The LTE eNB
is allowed to activate the dormant capacity booster NR cell (see clause 5.6 in
TR 37.816 [14]).
Inter-RAT energy saving consists of centralized energy saving where the energy
saving decision is made in MnS producer. The inter-RAT energy saving is almost
the same as the intra-RAT energy with the exception that the candidate cells
are eNB.
#### 5.1.3.3 Capacity booster cell fully overlaid by candidate cell(s)
An NG-RAN node, which connects with 5GC to provide boost capacity, may enter
into energySaving state if there is radio coverage by other radio systems --
be another NG-RAN node or an entity of another radio access technology - for
the whole coverage area of the NG-RAN node in question, see figure 5.1.3.3-1
for gNB capacity booster cell fully overlaid by candidate cell(s) case.
{width="6.524305555555555in" height="2.845138888888889in"}
Figure 5.1.3.3-1: gNB capacity booster cell fully overlaid by candidate
cell(s)
This use case applies both for Intra- and Inter-RAT Energy Saving.
**Inter-frequency Intra-RAT gNB Coverage**
Two gNB cells (Cell A, Cell B) with separate frequency bands cover the same
geographical area. Cell B has a smaller size than Cell A and is covered
totally by Cell A. Generally, Cell A is deployed to provide continuous
coverage of the area, while Cell B increases the capacity of the special sub-
areas, such as hot spots. The ES activation procedure in the coverage of Cell
B (ES area) may be triggered in case that light traffic in Cell B is detected.
Cell B ES activation may also be triggered when the traffic of ES area
(measured by candidate Cell A) resumes to a high level. A Cell B capable of ES
probing can execute the ES probing procedure and based on Cell B measurements
the centralized or distributed ES management can decide if the Cell B needs to
be activated and take portion of the traffic from Cell A.
**Inter-RAT gNB Coverage**
Two IRAT cells (Cell A, Cell B) cover the same geographical area. gNB Cell B
is totally covered by inter-RAT Cell A (such as legacy system UMTS or LTE).
Cell A is deployed to provide continuous coverage of basic eMBB services in
the area, while Cell B enhances the capability of the area to support eMBB
services with high data rate or URLLC services. The ES activation in the
coverage of Cell B (ES area) may be triggered in case that no eMBB services
with high data rate or URLLC traffic in Cell B is detected or load threshold
for going into energySaving state is reached. Cell B ES deactivation may be
triggered when the eMBB services with high data rate or URLLC service request
in ES area is restarted again or load threshold for going out of energySaving
state (i.e. going into notEnergySaving state) is reached. A Cell B capable of
ES probing can execute the ES probing procedure and based on Cell B
measurements the centralized or distributed ES management can decide if the
Cell B needs to be activated and take portion of the traffic from Cell A.
Different scenarios of gNB capacity booster cell fully overlaid by candidate
cell(s) are listed in below table 5.1.3.3-1.

# 6 Solutions for energy efficiency
## 6.1 Solutions for assessment of mobile network data energy efficiency
Assessment of NG-RAN data EE is based on the high-level mobile network data EE
KPI defined in clause 3.1 and clause 5.3 of ETSI ES 203 228 [2]:
> {width="1.00625in" height="0.42430555555555555in"}
NG-RAN data EE KPI is is obtained by the data volume divided by Energy
Consumption (EC) of the considered network elements. The KPI is defined for
both non-split and split gNB scenarios. This KPI is defined in clause 6.7.1 of
TS 28.554 [18].
The following PEE (Power, Energy and Environmental) measurement may be used as
the EC~MN~:
\- PNF Energy consumption (cf. clause 5.1.1.19.3 of TS 28.552 [15]): This
measurement provides the energy consumed (in kilowatt-hours) by the subject
gNB.
## 6.2 Solutions for energy saving
### 6.2.1 Overview
For the scenarios where the capacity booster cell is fully or partially
overlaid by the candidate cell(s), the key of energy saving solution is that
3GPP management system or NG-RAN node owning the capacity booster cell has the
capability to autonomously decide to deactivate such capacity booster cell to
lower energy consumption (in energySaving state) or activate the capacity
booster cell in energySaving state back to notEnergySaving state due to the
increasing traffic above the threshold. The cell activation/deactivation
decision is typically based on the load information of the related cells and
the energy saving policies set by operators.
ES activation procedure and ES deactivation procedure may be initiated in
different ways as below:
\- Centralized ES solution
\- Consumer of centralized MnS for ES requests the producer to configure ES
procedure trigger points (e.g. cell traffic load crossing threshold),
monitoring the traffic situation of capacity booster cells and candidate
cells.
\- Consumer of centralized MnS for ES requests the producer to instruct the
capacity booster cells to move from notEnergySaving state into energySaving
state (e.g. according to some traffic performance measurements which cross
below some load thresholds)
\- Consumer of centralized MnS for ES requests the producer to instruct the
capacity booster cells to move from energySaving state into notEnergySaving
state (e.g. according to some traffic performance measurements which cross
above some load thresholds)
\- Distributed ES solution
\- NF provisioning MnS consumer requests the producer to set policies and
conditions when these policies/conditions are met, the capacity booster cells
will move from notEnergySaving state into energySaving state. Examples for
policies/conditions are: A time period, during which energy saving is or not
allowed; load thresholds to be considered for energy saving decisions; which
of the RATs should be considered with priority in Inter-RAT scenario.
\- Based on these policies/conditions and further information - e.g. the
operational status of the candidate cell to take over the coverage- the NG-RAN
node controls the energy saving procedures (ES activation procedure and ES
deactivation procedure) in the network nodes. The network operator is informed
about configuration changes which are triggered by the NG-RAN nodes. For
example, the gNB owning the capacity booster cells moves itself to/from
energySaving state autonomously and sends notifications of configuration
changes to operator.
### 6.2.2 Centralized energy saving solution
#### 6.2.2.1 Procedures
##### 6.2.2.1.1 Energy saving activation
NOTE: The centralized energy saving solution in clause 6.2.2 is Domain-
Centralized ES solution because the scope of the centralized ES solution is
for NR only.
Figure 6.2.2.1.1-1 depicts a procedure that describes how MnS producer of
Domain Centralized SON ES management makes the NR capacity booster cell enter
the energySaving state.
{width="6.6819444444444445in" height="2.2381944444444444in"}
Figure 6.2.2.1.1-1: Centralized energy saving activation
It is assumed that all relevant MOIs have been created.
**Energy saving activation:**
The MnS producer for Domain centralized ES collects the traffic load
performance measurements from the NR capacity booster cell and candidate
cells.
The MnS producer for Domain centralized ES analyzes the traffic load
performance measurements and decides that the NR capacity booster cell should
enter the energySaving state.
The MnS producer for Domain centralized ES consumes the management service for
NF provisioning with _modifyMOIAttributes_ operation to request the NR
capacity booster cell to enter the energySaving state.
The NR capacity booster cell may initiate handover actions to off-load the
traffic to the neighbour cells (see clause 15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]), prior to
entering into the energySaving state, and then change to the energySaving
state, leading to a notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges being sent to the MnS
producer for Domain centralized ES that the NR capacity booster cell has
entered the energySaving state.
##### 6.2.2.1.2 Energy saving deactivation
Figure 6.2.2.1.2-1 depicts a procedure that describes how MnS producer of
Domain Centralized ES management makes the NR capacity booster cell leave the
energySaving state.
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="2.2194444444444446in"}
Figure 6.2.2.1.2-1: Centralized energy saving deactivation
**Energy saving deactivation:**
The MnS producer for Domain centralized ES collects the traffic load
performance measurements from the candidate cells.
The MnS producer for Domain centralized ES decides to re-activate the NR
capacity booster cell if it detects that the capacity is needed (see clause
15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]).
The MnS producer for Domain centralized ES consumes the management service for
NF provisioning with _modifyMOIAttributes_ operation to re-activate the NR
capacity booster cell, and changes to the notEnergySaving state, leading to a
notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges being sent to the consumer to indicate that the
NR capacity booster cell has been re-activated.

Figure 6.2.3.2.1-1: Distributed energy saving activation
It is assumed that all relevant MOIs have been created.
**Energy saving activation:**
The MnS producer for distributed ES management consumes the management service
for NF provisioning with _modifyMOIAttributes_ operation to:
\- Configure the cell overlaid relations for NR capacity booster cells, and
macro cells as candidate cells
\- Configure the ES policy that includes the thresholds for the energy saving
activation and deactivation for NR capacity booster cells and candidate cells
\- Enable the distribute energy saving function for intra-RAT or inter-RAT.
NOTE: Void
The distributed ES function makes decision for the NR capacity booster cell to
enter the energySaving state based on the cell traffic load information (see
clause 15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]).
The distributed ES function changes to the energySaving state, leading to a
notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges (see clause 5.1.9 in TS 28.532 [16]) being sent
to the MnS producer for distributed ES management to indicate the NR capacity
booster has entered the energySaving state.

**Energy saving deactivation:**
The distributed ES function monitors the traffic load of candidate cell, and
decides to re-activate the NR capacity booster cell when it detects that
additional capacity is needed (see clause 15.4.2 in TS 38.300 [13]).
The distributed ES function changes to the notEnergySaving state, leading to a
notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges being sent to the MnS producer for distributed
ES management to indicate the NR capacity booster has been re-activated.
