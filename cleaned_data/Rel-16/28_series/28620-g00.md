# 1 Scope
As a result of the analysis of the requirements for the harmonization of the
3GPP and TM Forum Information Models in the context of FMC basic use cases
were developed [6], [14]. These use cases led to the recognition that it would
be necessary to define common model elements applicable for wire-line and
wireless networks. This document defines these common model elements.

# 4 UIM -- Partition operational
## 4.1 Introduction
This section introduces a number of classes that form the UIM. These classes
are represented in UML and are implementation neutral views in that they only
capture the semantics of the model from both a purpose neutral and purpose
specific perspective. They do not:
a) Include syntax or representation of the information in a system or on-the-
wire between systems;
b) Relate to the protocol used to create/delete/read/write/modify the NM
information.
Various SDOs and organizations are expected to use the UIM classes for
definition of Domain/Technology-specific model classes. This procedure will
maximize the probability of the domain/technology specific concrete classes
(from various SDOs) being semantically consistent, a necessary characteristic
for FMC NM purposes.
The Generic NRM IRP [20] defines abstract classes and other NRM IRPs such as
E-UTRAN NRM IRP [2] define concrete classes. The Generic NRM IRP abstract
classes are harmonized (if not identical) to those defined in this document.
The UIM defined in this document provides the set of classes etc. that
strengthen consistency of representation in the fixed and mobile environments.
For management of an FNIM solution many other classes will be required in
addition to those in the UIM.
The UIM cannot be used directly for implementation. Implementation classes
must be derived from those in the UIM by Inheritance or some other appropriate
mechanism.
Implementation classes derived from those in the UIM (e.g. for the fixed
environment) must use different names from those used in the UIM.
Where an implementation class is essentially identical to that in UIM the name
of the implementation class should be the same as that of the UIM minus the
underscore, e.g. the UIM class \"_Function_"_ would become "Function\".
## 4.2 Class diagram
The criteria for choosing these classes is their relevance to (e.g. can be
used by) Domain/Technology-specific model classes (e.g. 3GPP network resource
model [2], ATM network management model [1], TMF MTNM [8].
Note that this set of classes is basic in that their definitions and usage are
necessary for the harmonization of various Domain/Technology-specific model
classes, forming the so-called FNIM.
These classes are _abstract_. Other classes are for further study.

## 4.3 Class definitions
### 4.3.1 _Domain__
#### 4.3.1.1 Definition
This class groups managed entities:
\- Such that the group represents a topological structure which describes the
potential for connectivity;
\- Subject to common administration;
\- With common characteristics.
A domain is a partition of instances of managed entities.
#### 4.3.1.2 Attributes
The Domain_ IOC includes attributes inherited from Top_ IOC (defined in clause
4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier **isReadable** **isWritable** **isInvariant**
**isNotifyable** dnPrefix M M - - M T F F T userLabel M M M - M T T F T
userDefinedNetworkType M M M - M T T F T
* * *
### 4.3.2 _ManagedElement__
#### 4.3.2.1 Definition
This (and its contained _Function__(s)) represents telecommunications
resources (e.g. equipment) within the telecommunications network. This group
performs Managed Element (ME) functions, e.g., provides support and/or service
to the subscriber.
This can also provide access to a grouping of equipments for management
purposes.
An ME communicates with a manager (directly or indirectly) for the purpose of
being monitored and/or controlled. MEs may or may not additionally perform
element management functionality.
An ME (and its contained _Function__(s)) may or may not be geographically
distributed. An ME (and its contained _Function__(s)) is often referred to as
a \"Network Element\".
#### 4.3.2.2 Attributes
The ManagedElement_ IOC includes attributes inherited from Top_ IOC (defined
in clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier **isReadable** **isWritable** **isInvariant**
**isNotifyable** dnPrefix M M - - M T F F T managedElementTypeList O M - - M T
F F T userLabel M M M - M T T F T locationName M M - - M T F F T Attribute
related to role  
managedBy O M - - M T F F T
* * *
### 4.3.3 _Function__
#### 4.3.3.1 Definition
This represents a process, task, transformation or a relation between inputs
and outputs.
#### 4.3.3.2 Attributes
The Function_ IOC includes attributes inherited from Top_ IOC (defined in
clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier **isReadable** **isWritable** **isInvariant**
**isNotifyable** userLabel O M M - M T T F T
* * *
### 4.3.4 _ManagementSystem__
#### 4.3.4.1 Definition
This represents a telecommunications management system (DM/EM) that contains
functionality for managing a number of MEs. The management system communicates
with the MEs directly or indirectly over one or more interfaces for the
purpose of monitoring and/or controlling these MEs.
This class has similar characteristics as the _ManagedElement_ _. The main
difference between these two classes is that the _ManagementSystem_ _ has a
special association to the MEs that it is responsible for managing.
#### 4.3.4.2 Attributes
The ManagementSystem_ IOC includes attributes inherited from Top_ IOC (defined
in clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier **isReadable** **isWritable** **isInvariant**
**isNotifyable** userLabel M M M - M T T F T Attribute related to role  
managedElements O M - - M T F F T
* * *
### 4.3.5 _TopologicalLink__
#### 4.3.5.1 Definition
The _TopologicalLink__ represents a communication relationship between network
entities and indicates that information is intended to flow between those
network entities. The _TopologicalLink__ always represents a logical
relationship.
#### 4.3.5.2 Attributes
The TopologicalLink_ IOC includes attributes inherited from Top_ IOC (defined
in clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier **isReadable** **isWritable** **isInvariant**
**isNotifyable** userLabel M M M - M T T F T layerProtocolNameList O M - - M T
F F T **Attribute related to role**  
aEnd M M - - M T F F T zEnd M M - - M T F F T
* * *
### 4.3.6 _TerminationPointEncapsulation__
#### 4.3.6.1 Definition
The _TerminationPointEncapsulation_ _ (TPE) represents one or more functions
that terminate/originate a signal that adapt a signal for use, and that enable
a signal to propagate. Hence a TPE can represent the end point of a signal
flow (see Annex C (informative): Rationale and Usage of TPE/LT for information
on structure).
The TPE can also represent the intermediate point of a signal flow. See Annex
C (informative): Rationale and Usage of TPE/LT for information on TPE
structure.
A TPE is capable of encapsulating multiple transport functions (G.805
termination functions, adapters, points etc.) at many different layers where
the encapsulated transport functions are all related to the same signal flow.
There are specific rules that guide encapsulation (see Annex C (informative):
Rationale and Usage of TPE/LT for information on usage). The encapsulated
layers may be exposed (of its details of the transport assembly) via usage of
instances of _LayerTermination_ _ (LT).
The TPE deals equivalently with unidirectional and bidirectional flows.
#### 4.3.6.2 Attributes
The TerminationPointEncapsulation_ IOC includes attributes inherited from Top_
IOC (defined in clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier **isReadable** **isWritable** **isInvariant**
**isNotifyable** tpeType CM M - - M T F F T
* * *
#### 4.3.6.3 Attribute constraints
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------+ | > Name | > Definition | +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------+ | tpeType Support Qualifier | The condition is \"The subject class | | | instance name-contains one or more | | | _LayerTermination_ _ instances \". | +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
### 4.3.7 _LayerTermination__
#### 4.3.7.1 Definition
The _LayerTermination__ (LT) encapsulates the functions and points associated
with one instance of a layer []. The functions include the adapter functions,
the termination functions and the connection points of that layer. In this
case the term layer is essentially synonymous with the term protocol as use by
other standards. All functions encapsulated have the same signal granularity,
closely associated characteristic type and essential rate. A specific
_LayerTermination_ may be equipped with a subset of capabilities. Where the
TPE is semi-transparent the layers encapsulated by a TPE are exposed by the
_LayerTermination__ set that it contains.
The _LayerTermination__ provides the relevant layer parameters for the semi-
transparent TPE cases.
The _LayerTermination_ _ allows for detailed layer description of a TPE
(potentially representing a port) and for precise association of the TPE with
a _TopologicalLink__ (or other representatives of forwarding relationship).
#### 4.3.7.2 Attributes
The LayerTermination_ IOC includes attributes inherited from Top_ IOC (defined
in clause 4.3.8) and the following attributes:
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier **isReadable** **isWritable** **isInvariant**
**isNotifyable** layerProtocolNameList M M - - M T F F T direction M M - - M T
F F T ltType M M - - M T F F T index CM M - - M T F F T

### 4.3.8 _Top__
#### 4.3.8.1 Definition
The _Top__ is a logical construct representing the origin of definitions for
all classes defined for the converged network management purposes. All other
classes specified in this document and in other FNIM specifications must
inherit from _Top__ directly or indirectly.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Void
###### ## Annex B (informative): Void
###### ## Annex C (informative): Rationale and Usage of TPE/LT
This Annex provides the rationale and the usage of LT in conjunction with TPE.
**Rational**
A TPE is capable of encapsulating multiple transport functions (G.805 [19]
termination functions, adapters, points etc.) at many different layers where
the encapsulated transport functions are all related to the same signal flow.
See Figure 11: UIM related to TM Forum model and ITU-T concepts.
The TPE is used to both reduce the instances of objects required to represent
a given transport assembly and to also simplify the translation from
traditional environments where layering is not fully represented.
The encapsulation may be opaque, i.e. not exposing the layering, or semi-
transparent, exposing the explicit layering but compacted into a single TPE
instance. In the former case, TPE instance does not need to name-contain any
LT. In the latter case, TPE instance needs to name-contain instances of LT.
The TPE deals equivalently with unidirectional and bidirectional flows. A
bidirectional flow is where pairings of unidirectional flows have some shared
fate or are considered as related in some way such that all entities
associated with the whole bidirectional flow will be encapsulated in one TPE.
Where a bidirectional flow is encapsulated it is possible to connect to only
one of the two directions of flow and this can be represented through
parameters of the TPE.
**Usage**
The TPE provides a place against which to raise alarms, display parameters and
set attributes associated with the signal flow.
The TPE can be related:
\- Directly to one or more physical ports (i.e. that the signal is associated
directly with an externally visible connector)
\- Note that a physical port could also be related to more than one TPE;
\- To logical functions that anchor the signal flow (i.e. it is floating
between flexible functions in the equipment with no externally visible
connector);
\- To another supporting TPE to represent a client signal of the supporting
TPE where there may be many instances of client;
\- Note that there may be many instances of server TPE that feed a single
client (e.g., in the case of VCAT)
