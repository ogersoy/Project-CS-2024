# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

# 4 General descriptions
The stage 3 solution over Itf-N reuses the solution sets for PM IRP as
specified in 3GPP TS 32.416 [3]. The stage 3 solution over Ve-Vnfm-em reuses
the solutions for performance management interface as specified in ETSI GS NFV
SOL 002 [4].
# 5 Interface Solution Sets
## 5.1 Itf-N
For the stage 3 solution of Performance Management for mobile networks that
include virtualized network functions over Itf-N, the solution sets for PM IRP
specified in 3GPP TS 32.416 [3] are reused.
## 5.2 Os-Ma-nfvo
None.
## 5.3 Ve-Vnfm-em
For the stage 3 solution of Performance Management for mobile networks that
include virtualized network functions over Ve-Vnfm-em, the following shall be
used:
\- the RESTful API resource structure and methods specified in clause 4.2 of
ETSI GS NFV-SOL 002 [4], and
\- the RESTful API sequence diagrams specified in clause 6.3 of ETSI GS NFV-
SOL 002 [4], and
\- the RESTful API resources specified in clause 6.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 002
[4], and
\- the RESTful API data model specified in clause 6.5 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 002
[4].
