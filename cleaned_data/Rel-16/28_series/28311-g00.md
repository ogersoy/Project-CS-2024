In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Overview
NFV policy management system may have policy conflict problem, which is a
newly created policy may be conflict with an existing policy.
There are two potential policy conflict detection approaches, one is policy
conflict detection in the Policy Function (PF), which makes the policy
execution decisions, and the other one is policy conflict detection in the
Policy Administration Function (PAF), which defines the network policy. There
are multiple scenarios for policy conflict. For example, if the events are the
same and the same condition are triggered (e.g. scaling policy on a VNF), but
two policies have different actions, the conflict should be detected and
resolved. It is not easy for one PF to resolve all of scenarios of the policy
conflict. Hence, it is reasonable to enable PAF to resolve policy conflict,
while the conflict detected by PAF or PF based on different specific
scenarios, and the present document try to resolve the problem.
# 5 Policy management architecture
In order to delegate the support of policy control for virtualized NFs such as
automatic scale in/out under certain condition , 3GPP management system would
use the ETSI NFV defined related policy features/services. Consequently, two
important logical functions are needed for the definition of the 3GPP policy
management architecture.
1) Policy Administration Function (PAF) provides the services as follows:
\- Allows the operator to define and administrate the network policy
2) Policy Function (PF) makes the decision for policy execution and provides
the services as follows:
\- Activating/deactivating the network policy
\- Event subscription/notification of the network policy execution
\- Providing relevant data and parameters during the process of policy
execution (e.g. execution time consuming)
The 3GPP global policy management system would affect the behavior of all 3GPP
defined nodes and would delegate the support of policy for virtualized NFs in
ETSI MANO systems [2]. For NFV related policy management, 3GPP mainly focus on
NM acting as PAF and EM acted as PF, and the interface between the NM and EM
can be updated to support policy related operations. Hence, 3GPP policy
management architecture under NFV scenario is as follows.
Figure 5-1: NFV policy management architecture in reference point presentation
NFV related policy interfaces between 3GPP management system and MANO such as
Os-Ma-nfvo and Ve-Vnfm-em have been defined by ETSI.

# 8 Policy management procedures
## 8.1 General description for policy management procedures
There are two kinds of management procedures. The first kind includes those
operations that allow the NM to invoke policy management operations towards
the EM.
  * Policy Creation
  * Policy Deletion
  * Policy Update
  * Policy Query
  * Policy Activation
  * Policy Deactivation
The second kind includes the operation that the EM notifies NM policy
conflicts found in EM.
  * Policy Conflicts Notification.
## 8.2 Policy Creation
After the NM (IRP Manager) decides to create a policy (ies), it will send the
create request to the EM (IRP Agent).
Figure 8.2: policy creation message flow
## 8.3 Policy Deletion
After the NM (IRP Manager) decides to delete a policy (ies), it will send the
delete request to the EM (IRP Agent).
Figure 8.3: policy deletion message flow
## 8.4 Policy Update
After the NM (IRP Manager) decides to update a policy (ies), it will send the
update request to the EM (IRP Agent).
Figure 8.4: policy update message flow
## 8.5 Policy Query
After the NM (IRP Manager) decides to query a policy, it will send the query
request to the EM (IRP Agent). For the query request, the EM (IRP Agent) sends
back the response with the policy to the NM (IRP Manager).
Figure 8.5: policy query message flow
## 8.6 Policy Activation
After the NM (IRP Manager) decides to activate a policy (ies), it will send
the policy activation request to the EM (IRP Agent).
Figure 8.6: policy activation message flow
## 8.7 Policy Deactivation
After the NM (IRP Manager) decides to deactivate a policy (ies), it will send
the policy deactivation request to the EM (IRP Agent).
Figure 8.7: policy deactivation message flow
## 8.8 Policy Conflicts Notification
When the EM (IRP Agent) receives new or updated policy (ies) from NM (IRP
Manager), it will check whether the each received policy is conflicts with the
previous storage policy. If the conflict is detected, the EM (IRP Agent) will
notify the information to the NM (IRP Manager).

# 11 Solution Set (SS) definitions
The present document defines the following policy management Solution Set
Definitions:
\- Annex A provides the XML Definitions.
\- Annex B provides the SOAP Solution Set.
###### ## Annex A (normative): XML definitions
# A.1 General
This annex contains the XML definitions for the policy management Integration
Reference Point.
# A.2 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of policy management IRP is specified, this
clause specifies features that are specific to the Schema definitions.
The present document provides the main part of the XML file format definition
for the policy management IRP IS.
The other parts of this XML definition are NRM-specific parts. All NRM IRPs
that include SS-level XML definition are in the scope of the policy management
IRP.
# A.3 Mapping
## A.3.1 General mapping
An IOC maps to an XML element of the same name as the IOC\'s name in the
Information Model. An IOC attribute maps to a sub-element of the corresponding
IOC\'s XML element, and the name of this sub-element is the same as the
attribute\'s name in the Information Model.
## A.3.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
The mapping is not present in the current version of the present document.
# A.4 Solution Set definitions
## A.4.1 XML definition structure
Clause A.4.2 provides a graphical representation of the XML elements.
Clause A.4.3 provides the schema fragment for policy management (policy
creation/deletion/update/query/activation/deactivation/conflicts notification)
XML files.
## A.4.2 Graphical Representation
The graphical representation is not present in the current version of the
present document.
## A.4.3 XML Schema "PolicyManagement.xsd"
