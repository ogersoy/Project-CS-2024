# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
TS 32.421: \"Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace concepts and
requirements\";
TS 32.422: \"Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace control and configuration
management \";
**TS 32.423: \"Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace data definition and
management\";**
Subscriber and MS Trace provide very detailed information at call level on one
or more specific mobile(s). This data is an additional source of information
to Performance Measurements and allows going further in monitoring and
optimisation operations.
Contrary to Performance Measurements, which are a permanent source of
information, Trace is activated on user demand for a limited period of time
for specific analysis purpose
Trace plays a major role in activities such as determination of the root cause
of a malfunctioning mobile, advanced troubleshooting, optimisation of resource
usage and quality, RF coverage control and capacity improvement, dropped call
analysis, Core Network and TRAN end to end procedure validation.
The capability to log data on any interface at call level for a specific user
(e.g. IMSI or SUPI) or mobile type (e.g. IMEI or IMEISV) allows getting
information which cannot be deduced from Performance Measurements such as
perception of end-user QoS during his call (e.g. requested QoS vs. provided
QoS), correlation between protocol messages and RF measurements, or
interoperability with specific mobile vendors.
Moreover, Performance Measurements provide values aggregated on an observation
period, Subscriber and Equipment Trace give instantaneous values for a
specific event (e.g. call, location update, etc.).
If Performance Measurements are mandatory for daily operations, future network
planning and primary trouble shooting, Subscriber and MS Trace is the easy way
to go deeper into investigation and network optimisation.
In order to produce this data, Subscriber and MS trace are carried out in the
NEs, which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an
external system (e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for
further evaluation).
# 1 Scope
The present document describes Trace data definition and management. It covers
the trace records content, their format and transfer across UMTS networks, EPS
networks or 5GS networks. GSM Trace is outside of the scope of this
specification..
The present document also describes the data definition for Minimization of
Drive Tests (MDT) across UMTS networks or EPS networks.
The objectives of the present document are:
\- To provide the descriptions for a standard set of Trace and MDT data;
\- To define the common format of trace and MDT records; and
\- To define a method for the reporting of Trace and MDT results across the
management interfaces.
Clause 4 details the various Trace records content, Annex A provides Trace and
MDT report file format, Annex B provides the trace report file conventions and
transfer procedure, Annex C provides the trace reporting functional
architecture and Annex D provides some trace and MDT files examples. Trace and
MDT concepts and requirements are covered in TS 32.421 [2] while Trace control
and configuration management are described in 3GPP TS 32.422 [3].
The definition of Trace and MDT data is intended to result in comparability of
Trace and MDT data produced in a multi-vendor wireless UMTS and/or EPS
network.
The following is beyond the scope of the present document, and therefore the
present document does not describe:
\- Any notification mechanisms or IRPs for trace. Only file transfer mechanism
is specified for trace data transfer;
\- Any data compression mechanisms for trace data transfer;
\- Any Trace capability limitations (e.g. maximum number of simultaneous
traced mobiles for a given NE).
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions, which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 4 Trace record contents
## 4.1 General
The trace reference, trace type and operation system identification are all
provided on trace activation.\ Each record may contain an MSC Server, MGW,
SGSN, GGSN, S-CSCF, P-CSCF, UTRAN, HSS, MME, Serving GW, E-UTRAN, AUSF, AMF,
NEF, NRF, NSSF, PCF, SMF, SMSF, UDM, UPF, AF and , ng-eNB, gNB-CU-CP, gNB-CU-
UP and gNB-DU event record. A key is included in the table indicating whether
or not the field is mandatory.
The following table shows the template for trace record description for
minimum and medium trace depth:
* * *
Interface name Protocol name IE name Message name(s) Trace depth Notes  
**Min** **Med**
* * *
**Interface name** : Contains the name of the interface, where the IE is
available.
**Protocol name** : Contains the protocol name on the interface, where the IE
is available.
**IE name** : The name of the Information Element, which should be decoded.
**Message name(s):** The name of the message(s), where the IE is included.
**Trace depth** : Shows in which trace depth the IE should be recorded. It
also classifies whether the IE is mandatory in the trace record or not (M, O
or X: meaning described in the previous table)
* * *
**M** Mandatory This field must be in the trace record if it is available,
i.e. if the message appears during the trace recording session and the IE is
present in the message. **O** Optional This field is optional and its support
is a matter for agreement between equipment manufacturer and network operator.
**X** Not applicable This field is not required in this instance. **CM**

**Definitions:**
Global eNBID of traced eNB: The id of the eNB traced, e.g. the eNB which
handles the connection of the traced MS, during the Trace Recording Session.
The id corresponds to the "Global eNB ID", as defined in [16] and [17].
Global eNBID of neighbouring eNB: The ids of all Neighbouring eNB involved in
the X2 procedures during the Trace Recording Session. The id corresponds to
the "Global eNB ID", as defined in [16] and [17].
> Global gNBID of connected gNB-CU-CP node over X2 (for NSA): The ids of all
> connected NSA nodes involved during the Trace Recording Session. The id
> corresponds to the "Global gNB ID", as defined in [16] and [17].
cell Id: The cell Ids of the cells involved in the X2 procedures during the
Trace Recording Session. The cell Ids is provided with each X2AP messages for
which the cId is relevant.
E-RABId: Specific recorded IE that contains the E-RAB identifier.
Message name: Name of the protocol message
Record extensions: A set of manufacturer specific extensions to the record

# 5 Trace streaming format
## 5.1 Introduction
In Streaming Trace data reporting the individual trace records are carried in
payload of the transport protocol messages Figure 5.1-1 illustrates the
concept.
Figure 5.1-1: Transport of Trace Records
As depicted in the Figure 5.1-1, each streaming protocol-specific message
delivers one or more trace records from the MnS Producer to the MnS Consumer.
The header of the transport protocol message is protocol-specific. It may
contain protocol specific extensions and/or options related to the transport
stream. The payload of the transport protocol carries one or more Streaming
Trace Records. The format of the individual Streaming Trace Records is
specified in clause 5.2.
The procedures related to the connection establishment and meta-data exchange
between the Streaming Trace data reporting MnS Producer and MnS Consumer are
out of scope of the present document and are specified in TS 28.532 [43]
## 5.2 Streaming Trace Record
### 5.2.1 Introduction
The Streaming Trace Record comprises a header, a payload and an optional
common trace payload that contains the trace administrative message as shown
in Error: Reference source not found5.2.1-1.
{width="4.7243055555555555in" height="1.35625in"}
Figure 5.2.1.1: Streaming Trace Record
The format of the Header in Streaming Trace Record is specified in the clause
5.2.2. The format of the Payload and the Common Trace Payload carrying the
Trace Administrative Message in Streaming Trace Record is specified in the
clause 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 respectively.
The Streaming Trace Records may be used to carry the captured Trace data being
reported by the MnS Producer to the MnS Consumer or to convey various
administrative messages from the MnS Producer to the MnS Consumer. These cases
are further explained in clause 5.2.4. Cases where MnS Consumer may transfer
data or convey administrative messages to the MnS Producer are out of scope of
the present document.
### 5.2.2 Streaming Trace Record Header
The streaming trace record header contains the common fields as specified in
the Error: Reference source not found2.2-1, in addition it may also contain
vendor specific extensions.

### 5.2.4 Streaming Trace administrative messages
#### 5.2.4.1 Introduction
The following administrative messages are defined to for trace stream
management purposes:
\- Trace Session Start
\- Trace Session Stop
\- Trace Recording Session Start
\- Trace Recording Session Stop
\- Trace Stream Heartbeat
\- Trace Recording Session Not Started
\- Trace Recording Session Dropped Events
#### 5.2.4.2 Trace Session Start administrative message
The Trace Session Start administrative message shall be used to convey the
start of a Trace Session (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [3] for details). The Streaming
Trace Record in this case may have zero-size payload. The value of the
traceRecordTypeId field in the Streaming Trace Record Header is set to
\"TRACE_SESSION_START\". The start trace session administrative message is not
used for signalling based activation as there is no separate trigger for
starting the session and the trace recording session.
#### 5.2.4.3 Trace Session Stop administrative message
The Trace Session Stop administrative message shall be used to convey the stop
of a Trace Session (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [3] for details). The Streaming Trace
Record in this case may have zero-size payload. The value of the
traceRecordTypeId field in the Streaming Trace Record Header is set to
\"TRACE_SESSION_STOP\".The stop trace session administrative message is not
used for signalling based activation as there is no separate trigger for
stoping the session and the trace recording session.
#### 5.2.4.3a Trace Recording Session Start administrative message
The Trace Recording Session Start administrative message shall be used to
convey the start of a Trace Recording Session (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [3] for
details). The Streaming Trace Record in this case may have zero-size payload.
The value of the traceRecordTypeId field in the Streaming Trace Record Header
is set to \"TRACE_ RECORDING_SESSION_START\".
#### 5.2.4.3b Trace Recording Session Stop administrative message
The Trace Recording Session Stop administrative message shall be used to
convey the stop of a Trace Recording Session (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [3] for
details). The Streaming Trace Record in this case may have zero-size payload.
The value of the traceRecordTypeId field in the Streaming Trace Record Header
is set to \"TRACE_ RECORDING_SESSION_STOP\".
#### 5.2.4.4 Trace Stream Heartbeat administrative message
The Trace Stream Heartbeat administrative message may be used in absence of
the captured trace data and other administrative messages from the MnS
Producer to the MnS Consumer. The message is intended to indicate that a
streaming trace connection is alive and does not indicate whether there is an
ongoing Trace Session or not.
Transport protocol level keep-alive mechanisms may be used as an alternative
(e.g. use of Ping and Pong WebSocket frames in IETF RFC 6455 [40]) and are out
of scope of the present document.
#### 5.2.4.5 Trace Recording Session Not Started administrative message
The Trace Recording Session Not Started administrative message shall be used
to convey that a trace recording session could not be started. For example,
the number of simultaneous UE traces may be limited so that UE traces are not
started when this limit is reached. It includes the detailed reason as string
in the payload.
#### 5.2.4.6 Trace Recording Session Dropped Events administrative message
The Trace Recording Session Dropped Events administrative message shall be
used to convey the number of dropped trace records. The message provides
indication that trace records are dropped from a particular trace recording
session. It includes the number of trace records dropped in the payload.
### 5.2.5 Void
## 5.3 Void
###### ## Annex A (normative): Trace Report File Format
# A.0 Introduction
This annex describes the format of trace or MDT result files. Those files are
to be transferred from the network (NEs or EM) to the NM.
The following conditions have been considered for the definition of this file
format:
\- The trace data volume and trace duration is not predictable. Depending on
the data retrieval and storage mechanisms, several consecutive trace result
files could be generated for a single traced call. The file naming convention
shall allow rebuilding the temporal file sequences.
\- Since the files are transferred via a machine-machine interface, the files
should be machine-readable using standard tools.
\- The file format should be independent from the data transfer protocol used
to carry the file from one system to another.
\- The file format should be generic across UMTS and EPS systems.
\- The file format should be flexible enough to support further trace data
types and decoded IEs, as well as vendor specific trace data.
# A.1 Parameter description and mapping table

# A.2 XML file format definition
For encoding of the information content, XML (see Extensible Markup Language
(XML) 1.0, W3C Recommendation [5] , [6], [7], [8] and [9]) will be used. The
XML schema contains the mark-up declarations that provide a grammar for the
trace file format. The XML schema is defined below.
## A.2.1 XML trace/MDT file diagram
The following figure A.2.1-1 describes the XML element structure of a

NOTE: In case a trace only recording session, the elements/attributes (such as
\"meas\") which are specific to MDT but not used for trace should be excluded
from the file; In case a MDT only recording session, the elements/attributes
(such as \"msg\") which are specific to trace but not used for MDT should be
excluded from the file: In case of a combined trace and MDT recording session,
all the elements/attributes are included in the file.

###### ## Annex B (normative): Trace Report File Conventions and Transfer
Procedure
# B.0 Introduction
This annex describes naming conventions of files containing trace results and
the procedure to transfer these files from the network to the NM.
# B.1 File naming convention
The following convention shall be applied for trace result file naming:
\\.\‑\.\.[\].[\]
1) The Type field indicates if the file contains trace data for single or
multiple calls, where:
\- \"A\" means single Trace Recording Session, single sender NE;
\- \"B\" means multiple Trace Recording Sessions, single sender NE;
\- \"C\" means IMSI/IMEI (SV) information for cell traffic trace or IMEI-TAC
if area based MDT trace is involved (3GPP TS 32.422 [3] clause 4.4) .
2) The Startdate field indicates the date of the first record in the trace
file. The Startdate field is of the form YYYYMMDD, where:
\- YYYY is the year in four-digit notation;
\- MM is the month in two digit notation (01 - 12);
\- DD is the day in two digit notation (01 - 31).
3) The Starttime field indicates the time of the first record in the trace
file. The Starttime field is of the form HHMMSSshhmm, where:
\- HH is the two digit hour of the day (local time), based on 24 hour clock
(00 - 23);
\- MM is the two digit minute of the hour (local time) (00 -- 59);
\- SS is the two digit second of the minute (local time) (00 -- 59);
\- s is the sign of the local time differential from UTC (+ or -), in case the
time differential to UTC is 0 then the sign may be arbitrarily set to \"+\" or
\"-\";
\- hh is the two digit number of hours of the local time differential from UTC
(00-23);
\- mm is the two digit number of minutes of the local time differential from
UTC (00-59).
4) SenderType field is the type of NE defined by IOC attribute
managedElementType in 3GPP TS 32.622 [12] that recorded and sent the trace
file; SenderName field is the identifier of the NE that recorded and sent the
trace file.
5) TraceRecordingSessionReference field is set only if the type field is A,
and is represented in hexa-decimal format. TraceRecordingSessionReference is a
4 digit hexadecimal number and will not include filler digits for values less
than 4 digits in length. All hexadecimal letters (A thru F) are capitalized.
6) TraceReference field is set if the type field is A. For type B the Trace
Reference is optional and will be used when one trace file is created per
trace session with multiple trace recording session. Trace Reference is
represented in hexadecimal format. Trace Reference as defined in 3GPP TS
32.422 [3] is composed of PLMN ID (MCC, MNC) and Trace ID. The PLMN identity
consists of 3 digits for MCC followed by either - a filler digit plus 2 digits
from MNC (in case of 2 digit MNC) or 3 digits from MNC (in case of a 3 digit
MNC). MCC and MNC are in BCD format.
Example: If MCC: 405, MNC: 139
octet 1: 0x04 (MCC digit 2, MCC digit 1)
octet 2: 0x15 (MNC digit 1, MCC digit 3)
octet 3: 0x93 (MNC digit 3, MNC digit 2)
Also if the MNC is 2 digits (MCC: 405 and MNC 39)
octet 1: 0x04 (MCC digit 2, MCC digit 1)
octet 2: 0xF5 (MNC digit 1, MCC digit 3)
octet 3: 0x93 (MNC digit 3, MNC digit 2)
7) Trace Reference is set if the type field is C.
See bullet 6 above for details regarding the representation of the Trace
Reference.Some examples describing file naming convention:
1) file name: A20090928.231500+0200-MME.MME5. 13F23200056.125,
meaning: file produced by MME\ on September 28, 2009, first trace
record at 23:15:00 local time with a time differential of +2 hours against
UTC. The file contains trace data for the Trace Session with the Trace
reference 13F232000056 (where MCC is 312, MNC is 23, and Trace ID is 000056,
all in hexadecimal format) and for the Trace Recording Session with the
reference 125.
2) file name: B20030115.170000-0300-RNC.RNC02,
meaning: file produced by RNC\ on January 15, 2003, first trace record
at 17:00:00 local time with a time differential of -3 hours against UTC. The
file contains trace data for several Trace Recording Sessions.
3) file name: B20030115.170000-0300-RNC.RNC02. 4358070034D7,
meaning: file produced by RNC\ on January 15, 2003, first trace record
at 17:00:00 local time with a time differential of -3 hours against UTC. The
file contains trace 4358070034D7 (where MCC is 348, MNC is 570, and Trace ID
is 0034D7) data for Trace reference and several Trace Recording Sessions.
4) file name C20030115.170000-0300-MME.MME02. 26F452550021
Meaning: file produced by MME\ on January 15, 2003, first trace record
at 17:00:00 local time with a time differential of -3 hours against UTC. The
file contains IMSI/IMEI (SV) or IMEI-TAC information for one or more UEs
traced at eNB with Trace Reference26F452550021 (where MCC is 624, MNC is 25,
and Trace ID is 550021).

###### ## Annex G (normative): Trace Record Protocol Buffer (GPB)
# G.1 Transport Protocol Payload Format
The payload of one transport protocol message can carry one or more streaming
trace records as specified in clause 5.1. For GPB streaming trace payload, the
overall encoding format shall adhere to the following rules:
\- Each streaming trace record is encoded as a single TraceRecord GPBv3
message following the schema in clause G.Y.
\- Each TraceRecord message is preceded by a length field indicating the size
in bytes of the following GPB message. This length field is encoded using the
GPB 'varint' wire format.
\- If the transport message payload includes multiple trace records, the
length field for the next TraceRecord message shall immediately follow the
preceding message.
\- No extra padding (unused bytes) is allowed anywhere in the transport
message payload.
NOTE: The total length of the transport message payload is assumed to be
available but encoding of this value is specific to the transport protocol in
use.
