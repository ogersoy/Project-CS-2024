# Introduction
User Data Convergence (UDC) presents a layered architecture where user data is
accessible at a logically unique repository called User Data Repository (UDR).
One or more dataless applications access the user data that is stored in the
UDR. In this context, applications can be front ends, for example an HSS-FE or
an HLR-FE, or application servers. In order to support UDC, a Common Baseline
Information Model is defined in this specification.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies a Common Baseline Information Model for UDC
[2]. This information model denotes an abstract, formal representation of
entity types that are common to many applications using the UDR. CBIM
describes the basic IOCs of UDC, their properties and their relationships.
Detailed requirements for the specification of this Common Baseline
Information Model are given in 3GPP TR 22.985 [2] and 3GPP TS 22.101 [3].
From the Common Baseline Information Model specialized information models and
data models can be derived. All these derived models are out of the scope of
this specification.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Common Baseline Information Model:** an abstract, formal representation of
entity types common to many applications using the UDR. CBIM describes the
basic IOCs of UDC, their properties and their relationships, so that these
IOCs constitute the baseline for any given application. Therefore, CBIM
provides flexibility (in its data structure and content), extensibility and
multi-application approach. In particular, CBIM provides support for the
concepts of Subscription, Service Profile, End User, Identifiers, End User
Group, and End Device, among others. CBIM does not define the models that are
associated with each application and that are under their responsibility.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905
[1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TR
21.905 [1].

# 4 Modelling Approach
The CBIM is not an Integration Reference Point (IRP) as it is not used for a
management interface; however this specification follows the IRP IS template
specified in 3GPP TS 32.151 [4] and reuses the UML repertoire described in
3GPP TS 32.152 [5].
NOTE: The intention of CBIM is to provide the basic common IOCs of UDC,
including their definitions and relationships. Attributes of the IOCs are not
intended to be part of this specification.

## 5.3 Information Object Class Definitions
### 5.3.1 EndUser
#### 5.3.1.1 Definition
In this context this object class represents an End User (as per 3GPP TS
21.905 [1]). This class represents the view that the telecommunication network
has about the end user and contains the valid parameters that define the End
User from UDC point of view. An EndUser object class has an End-User Identity
attribute (EUI), which is described in 3GPP TS 21.905 [1].
### 5.3.2 Identifier
#### 5.3.2.1 Definition
This abstract object class represents an end user identifier that is used
within the network so that the different network functionalities can be used
(mobility management, authentication, and service usage). This is an abstract
IOC that can be inherited by the real identifier used in the network, like
IMSI, MSISDN, IMPI, IMPU, etc.
NOTE: This object does not include identities that are not associated to a
user, such as an IMEI, hostID, etc.
### 5.3.3 UdcServiceProfile
#### 5.3.3.1 Definition
This object class represents the data characterizing a service assigned to an
EndUser. It includes service preferences and settings chosen for an EndUser.
The service profile contains the permanent and temporary data pertaining to an
end user that is subscribed to a service. This IOC can be inherited by
different service profiles, such as CS, GPRS, EPS, IMS service profiles and so
on.
### 5.3.4 EndDevice
#### 5.3.4.1 Definition
This object class represents a composite of hardware and software that
implements service terminal functions and that the EndUser operates in order
to get access to telecommunication services.
### 5.3.5 UdcCsServiceProfile
#### 5.3.5.1 Definition
This object class represents the part of the UdcServiceProfile that contains
data related to Circuit-Switched services. An example of further
specialization of this object class, including attributes, is provided in 3GPP
TS 32.181 [12].
### 5.3.6 UdcGprsServiceProfile
#### 5.3.6.1 Definition
This object class represents the part of the UdcServiceProfile that contains
data related to Packet-Switched services. An example of further specialization
of this object class, including attributes, is provided in 3GPP TS 32.181
[12].
### 5.3.7 UdcEpsServiceProfile

Services Digital Network Number (as per 3GPP TS 23.003 [6]). An MSISDN is
allocated from an E.164 numbering plan.
### 5.3.10 IMSI
#### 5.3.10.1 Definition
In this context this object class represents an International Mobile
Subscriber Identity (as per 3GPP TS 23.003 [6]).
### 5.3.11 IMPI
#### 5.3.11.1 Definition
In this context this object class represents an IMS Private User Identity (as
per 3GPP TS 23.228 [7]). The Private User Identity takes the form of a Network
Access Identifier (NAI), which is defined in IETF RFC 4282 [9]. It is possible
for a representation of the IMSI to be contained within the NAI for the
private user identity.
### 5.3.12 IMPU
#### 5.3.12.1 Definition
In this context this object class represents an IMS Public User Identity (as
per 3GPP TS 23.228 [7]). An IMPU takes the form of either a SIP URI (see IETF
RFC 3261 [11]) or a Tel URI (see IETF RFC 3966 [10]). For UEs that are not
equipped with an ISIM application, it is possible to derive a temporary IMPU
from the IMSI (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [6] for details).
### 5.3.13 E164
#### 5.3.13.1 Definition
This object class represents a telephone number crafted according to ITU-T
Recommendation E.164 [8].
### 5.3.14 NAI

includes information that describes the grouping and criteria for membership.
Examples of UdcEndUserGroup may include the following: Closed User Group, VPN,
and market segments.
### 5.3.18 UdcSubscription
#### 5.3.18.1 Definition
This IOC represents common data shared by a group of UdcServiceProfile
instances. This IOC exists due to the relationship of a subscriber to the
service provider. The end user can be attached to different UDC subscriptions
through UDC Service Profiles for different service usage (e.g. for a private
and a professional service usage).
Editor's Note: The relationship between Identifier and UdcSubscription is left
for further study.
## 5.4 Information Relationship Definitions
