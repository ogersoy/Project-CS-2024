# 1 Scope
The present document is part of a series of Technical Specifications (TSs)
that specify charging functionality and charging management in GSM/UMTS
networks. The GSM/UMTS core network charging architecture and principles are
specified in TS 32.240 [1], which provides an umbrella for other charging
management TSs that specify:
\- the content of the CDRs per domain and subsystem (offline charging);
\- the content of real-time charging messages per domain / subsystem (online
charging);
\- the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains and
subsystems;
\- the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the
charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events).
The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240 [1].
The present document specifies the Offline Charging description for the 3GPP
Circuit Switched domain, based on the functional descriptions of the 3GPP
bearer-, tele- and supplementary services in TS 22.002 [200], TS 22.003 [201]
and TS 22.004 [202], respectively. This charging description includes the
offline charging architecture and scenarios specific to the CS domain, as well
as the mapping of the common charging architecture specified in TS 32.240 [1]
onto the CS domain. It further specifies the structure and content of the CDRs
for offline charging. The present document is related to other 3GPP charging
TSs as follows:
\- The common 3GPP charging architecture is specified in TS 32.240 [1];
\- The parameters, abstract syntax and encoding rules for these CDR types are
specified in TS 32.298 [51].
\- The file based mechanism used to transfer the CDRs from the network to the
operator\'s billing domain (e.g. the billing system or a mediation device) is
specified in TS 32.297 [52].
Note that online charging for the CS domain is solely based on CAMEL (TS
23.078 [207] and TS 29.078 [213]) and therefore outside the scope of the 32
series of charging specifications.
All terms, definitions and abbreviations used in the present document, that
are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in TR 21.905 [100]. Those that are
common across charging management in GSM/UMTS domains, services or subsystems
are provided in the umbrella document TS 32.240 [1] and are copied into clause
3 of the present document for ease of reading. Finally, those items that are
specific to the present document are defined exclusively in the present
document.
Furthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in TS
22.115 [101].

# 4 Architecture considerations
## 4.1 2High level CS domain architecture
Figure 4.1.1 shows the G logical architecture as2 described in TS 2.002 [103].
Refer to TS 23.002 [103] for a description of the reference points not covered
in the present document.
Figure 4.1.1: Overview of the 2G, 3G CS and PS and E-UTRAN PS logical
architecture
The 3^rd^ Generation Mobile system is logically implemented on the GSM/GPRS
structure through the addition of a new air interface supported by two network
nodes, the RNC and the Node B. No inference should be drawn about the physical
configuration on an interface from figure 4.1.1.
The CAMEL entities are not shown in figure 4.1.1. For the relationship ship of
the CAMEL entities to the core network entities illust2rated above, refer to
TS 2.002 [103].
Network architecture for service centralization and continuity is presented in
TS 22.002 [103].
## 4.2 CS domain offline charging architecture
Figure 4.2.1 illustrates the 3^rd^ Generation charging logical architecture,
which is subdivided by the two transmission planes, the Circuit Switched (CS)
domain and the Packet Switched (PS) domain. The entities of the CS domain are
encircled by the related box on the left hand side of the figure.
Figure 4.2.1 : 3G charging logical architecture
The components grouped in the grey boxes constitute what was referred to as
the \"MSC\" prior to 3GPP Rel-4. The boxes which show red lines are those that
are relevant for CS domain charging. While not shown explicitly in figure
4.2.1, the VLR may also generate CDRs (cf. figure 4.1.1 for the relationship
between VLR and MSC server). In addition, the gsmSCF may also produce CDRs,
however, these are not subject to 3GPP standardization.
Figure 4.2.2 specifies the mapping of the 3GPP common charging architecture,
as laid down in 3GPP TS 32.240 [1], onto the CS domain.
As depicted in figure 4.2.2, all charging functions (CTF, CDF and CGF) reside
within each CS Network Element (i.e. the MSC server, the VLR, and the HLR).
Thus, the CS nodes are connected directly to the Billing Domain via the Bc
reference point. This implies that there exists no separate CDF and CGF for
the CS domain, and no corresponding open interfaces between any such
functions, within the 3GPP standards.
However, vendors may choose to implement separate CDF and CGF for the CS
domain. In that case, the interfaces between these functions should comply
with the definition of the Rf and Ga reference points (TS 32.299 [50] and TS
32.295 [54], respectively) as much as possible.

Figure 4.2.2: CS offline charging architecture
## 4.3 CS domain online charging architecture
CS domain online charging is implemented by CAMEL techniques as described in
TS 23.078 [207] and TS 29.078 [212], i.e. outside the scope of this
specification.
NOTE: that the CDRs described in the present document do contain CAMEL
information. This is because some of that information is relevant to offline
charging in case of CAMEL control of (part of) the call, and thus needs to be
captured in the offline charging information. However, this is not related to
the online charging functions for the CS domain.
# 5 CS domain charging principles and scenarios
## 5.1 CS domain charging principles
### 5.1.0 General
The following high-level requirements summarize the more detailed requirements
of TS 22.115 [101].
1\. to provide a CDR for all charges incurred and requiring settlement between
the different commercial roles;
2\. to allow itemized billing for all services (including CAMEL) charged to
each subscription, including voice and data calls, and services offered by
home environments, taking into account:
\- information provided by the user (including authentication parameters,
etc.);
\- information provided by the serving network (including Serving Network Id,
timestamps, etc.);
\- information provided by the service (including charged party, long calling,
multimedia, etc.).
3\. to allow fraud control by the Home Environment and the Serving network.
### 5.1.1 General aspects of Charging Data
Charging Data Record (CDR) generation and contents should be flexible and
unnecessary redundancy in data should be avoided. Charging data are collected
for successful and selected unsuccessful subscriber transactions. The
subscriber transaction is seen as being successful in the MSC server (where
the CDR is generated) either if a call is answered or if the Short Message
Service Centre has confirmed the successful receipt of a mobile originated
short message.
Unsuccessful call attempts are recorded in the case of partial record
generation due to CAMEL FollowOnCalls. If in such a call constellation the
answer state is reached at least once, subsequent unsuccessful set-up of a
connection configuration is also recorded in order to provide a complete
sequence of FIRST, INTERMEDIATE and LAST records.
At termination of the subscriber transaction these data are formatted into
CDRs. These records are forwarded onto MSC server\'s CGF which constitutes the
source for further transportation of that data to the Billing Domain via the
Bc reference point, see TS 32.297 [52]. For the purpose of the present
document, the CDRs are considered to be collected, in near real-time, by the
following network elements: the MSC servers, MGWs, and location registers
(VLR/HLR).
The data collected by the network elements are sent to (\"pushed\"), or
collected by (\"pulled\"), the Billing Domain for storage and further
processing. The CDR transfer across the Bc reference point is specified in
detail in TS 32.297 [52].
Similarly, the tariff data required by the network elements to provide on-line
charging information are distributed by the appropriate management system.
This function, however, is outside the scope of 3GPP standardization.
### 5.1.2 Charging information
#### 5.1.2.0 Introduction
The MSC server and Gateway MSC server are responsible for the collection of
all charging relevant information for each MS and PSTN connection and for the
storage of this information in the form of CDRs.
Circuit switched calls can be charged in one MSC server (the anchor MSC
server) where all relevant data is available. That is guaranteed by routing
all signalling information though the anchor MSC server even if the traffic
channel of a call is routed through another MSC server due to handover.
The Gateway MSC server acts as a gateway into other PLMNs or fixed networks.
Within the PLMN, the GMSC server is responsible for the generation of CDRs for
calls routed from or into other networks.
If subscribed CAMEL services apply to MS, the (G)MSC servers contain CAMEL
subscription data providing the information required for invocation of the
CAMEL dialogues for controlling the MS terminating and MS originating calls.
Charging data record parameters resulting from the CAMEL treatment applying to
MS calls is derived from the CAMEL subscription data.
In addition to user subscribed services, specific dialled CAMEL services might
be invoked which also influence existing records or even trigger the
generation of separate records steered by service logic.
Each CDR captures all charging information relevant to the call, or in case of
partial CDRs (see clause 5.1.3.6), the portion of a call that the CDR covers.
Depending on the type of CDR and the node producing it, this includes
information on tele- and bearer services (which may include radio resource
usage) and supplementary service invocation / termination. As far as tele- and
bearer services are concerned, all service information is embedded in the
appropriate CS CDR, i.e. there are no specific \"service CDRs\" in the CS
domain. For Supplementary Services, the exact treatment is specified in clause
5.1.3.3.
In addition to the information collected from the network elements, network
management functions are required for the administration of on-line charging
data stored in the MSC servers. This data is employed to drive the charge
display in the Mobile Station (MS) as required by the Advice of Charge (AoC)
service and defined by TS 22.086 [204] and TS 22.024 [203].
In case of ICS will not all supplementary services handled also IMS-AS
therefore the MSC server enhanced with ICS can not add the services
information to CDR. (new phrase) MSC server will not cover the IMS invoked
services
NOTE: Service centralization and continuity charging part is generated at IM
subsystem side.
#### 5.1.2.1 Subscriber billing
The charging data collected from the HPLMN, interrogating PLMN, and/or VPLMN
network elements is employed to determine the network utilization charges for
the basic and supplementary services utilized by the home subscribers of the
PLMN. The charges calculated are then combined with the network access
(subscription) charges and billed to those customers directly serviced by the
PLMN.
For those subscribers handled by Service Providers, the billing information is
employed for both wholesale (Network Operator to Service Provider) and retail
(Service Provider to Subscriber) billing. Consequently, having been processed
by the PLMN Billing System, the charging data collected from the network
elements may also be sent to the Service Provider for further processing.
#### 5.1.2.2 Settlements of charges
##### 5.1.2.2.1 Inter-PLMN accounting
Inter-PLMN accounts for roaming traffic are determined in accordance with
ITU-T principles (see ITU-T Recommendation D.93 [300]) and are settled by
means of the GSM Association\'s Transferred Account Procedure (TAP).
##### 5.1.2.2.2 \"Visitors\" from other PLMNs
The CDRs collected from the network also include details of the services
employed by visiting (roaming) subscribers. The charges for Mobile Originated
Calls (MOCs) and for supplementary services used are calculated as for home
subscribers, converted to an agreed accounting currency and included in the
CDRs for the TAP. Even if Mobile Terminated Calls (MTCs) are zero-priced in
the visited network (VPLMN), in the absence of \"optimized routing\" the MTC
TAP records are still required by the home network (HPLMN) in order to
determine the re-routing charges from the HPLMN to the VPLMN.
The TAP records generated are exchanged with each HPLMN on a regular basis.
These TAP records form the basis of the invoice submitted by the VPLMN for the
traffic carried.
For traditional CS call, the operator has received all the information from
one CDR, MOC or TAP CDR.
After ICS/SRVCC the call is anchored in the home network, part of charging
information will be from visited PLMN by TAP CDR and other part of information
will be home PLMN directly by IMS CDR.
##### 5.1.2.2.3 \"Home\" subscribers roaming in other PLMNs
The HPLMN receives TAP records from each VPLMN for services employed by home
subscribers whilst roaming. These records are employed to verify the invoices
from the VPLMN and to bill the home subscribers for the services used. The
charges contained in the TAP records are converted from the accounting
currency to the local currency and a handling surcharge (mark-up) is added if
required. The TAP records are subsequently passed to the subscriber billing
process described in clause 5.1.2.1.
##### 5.1.2.2.4 Settlement with other networks
The settlement of accounts with the operators of other networks (fixed /
mobile) for traffic carried, is generally performed on a bulk basis according
to the principles outlined in the ITU-T Recommendations D-series.
The traffic accounted for in this manner may include:
\- outgoing (Mobile to Mobile/Land) traffic;
\- incoming (Land/Mobile to Mobile) traffic;
\- transit traffic, carried by intermediate networks;
\- signalling (MAP/SCCP, CAP/SCCP) traffic such as location updates.
Accounting information may also be required for the use of services provided
by other operators such as short message service centres and other Value Added
Service (VAS) providers.
The charges for the various traffic shares may be determined on the basis of
the CDRs generated by the network elements or on the basis of bulk counters
(accounting meter records) in the gateway MSC servers (GMSC servers). For the
purpose of the present document, the management information required is
assumed to be derived from CDRs. The management of accounting meters is
outside the scope of the present document.
In GSM, the radio resources used for various connection types are roughly
identical, hence no differentiation of the connection types is needed for the
purpose of inter-network accounting. In UMTS, however, the radio bandwidth
allocated to a connection may be much higher compared to GSM, even though the
connection looks identical from the perspective of the gateway MSC server.
Therefore it is necessary that the gateway CDRs capture the cases where
\"higher-than-normal\" radio bandwidth is occupied. An example of a narrow
band radio connection is the standard AMR voice call. An example of a wideband
service, using the same landline channel but much more radio resources, is the
use of BS30 for video telephony.
Given that - in contrast to the serving MSC server - the gateway MSC server
cannot distinguish the cases described above, the serving MSC server is
capable of returning information on the bearer capability back to the GMSC
server so that this information can be added to the gateway CDR for incoming
connections. For further details of this functionality, refer to TS 29.007
[213].
#### 5.1.2.3 Service Information
The charging data collected from the network elements may be used to provide
statistical information concerning the use of services, by both home and
visiting subscribers, within the network. In addition, the introduction of new
services and / or modifications to the tariffs of existing services may also
require the distribution of the appropriate tariff information to the network
elements for Advice of Charge purposes.
### 5.1.3 Special cases and considerations
#### 5.1.3.0 General
The following clauses provide detailed consideration on CS domain specific
items and topics.
#### 5.1.3.1 AoC service
In addition to the information collected from these Network Elements, network
management functions are required for the administration of on-line charging
data stored in the MSC server. Two levels of AoC service are available:
information level and charging level. The information level is used only to
provide AoC information to the user. For the charging level, if no approval of
the AoC information by the MS is received in the MSC server, the call is
released immediately.
This data is employed to drive the charge display in the Mobile Station (MS)
as required by the advice of charge (AoC) service and defined by TS 22.086
[64] and TS 22.024 [63]. Information used by the AoC service shall include a
combination of the following:
\- one or more basic services; and/or
\- one or more supplementary services; and/or
\- one or more network specific services; and/or
\- one or more power capability classes (MS classmark); and/or
\- the type of radio traffic channel used/ requested;
\- the transparency mode of the basic service employed (transparent/non-
transparent);
\- the type of call or connection (e.g. MOC/MTC).
This list may also be extended to include additional network specific
parameters.
Parameters sent to the mobile station during the operation of the AoC service
are recorded in the appropriate CDRs.
#### 5.1.3.2 CAMEL services
A CAMEL service can be activated for originating, forwarded and terminated
calls and originating SMS. Several fields describing CAMEL subscription and
free format data are recorded to appropriate CDR. For originating and
forwarded calls two different CAMEL services can be active and part of stored
information is different depending on the CAMEL call model and which triggers
occur. CAMEL fields describing usage level of service, CAMEL modified
parameters and CAMEL initiated call forwarding include information for one
call leg including impacts on all CAMEL services.
#### 5.1.3.3 Use of supplementary services
The recording of supplementary service usage permits the Billing Domain (BD)
to specify the supplementary service actions (invocation, registration, etc.).
In addition to specifying the actions to be recorded, the BD may also
determine how these events are to be recorded. Non-call related events, such
as the administration of supplementary services by the subscriber via the MMI
of the MS, shall result in the production of supplementary service action
records. Call related events (e.g. invocation of supplementary services) shall
be recorded \"in-line\" in the appropriate CDR and / or in a separate SS-
action record depending on the configuration specified by the BD.
Where the use of a supplementary service results in the production of further
connections (e.g. call forwarding, multi‑party service etc.) additional CDRs
shall be produced to describe the relevant connections. The use of such
services is described in more detail both in this clause and in the example
scenarios.
#### 5.1.3.4 Use of call forwarding
When one of the call forwarding services is used, the charging function of the
MSC server that forwards the call, shall produce the MOC record for the
forwarded part of the call.
For further information concerning the recording of call forwarding services
see the example scenarios in clauses 5.2.1.6 and 5.2.1.7.
#### 5.1.3.5 Use of call hold and multi-party services
The use of the call hold service shall be recorded either in-line in the
appropriate CDR or in a separate supplementary service \"invocation\" record
as described above. The duration for which the call is held, i.e. is inactive,
is not recorded.
The use of the multi-party service requires a minimum of three (3) subscribers
and the use of a conference circuit. For the purpose of the following
description the subscriber invoking the service is referred to as the
conference originator (\"A\") and the conference call is regarded as
consisting of a number of individual \"legs\" between the conference
originator and the other parties (\"B\", \"C\", etc.) in the call.
Normal MOC and MTC CDRs shall be generated for each party and each leg of the
call. In addition, if common equipment records are enabled, a common equipment
record shall be produced for the conference originator in order to record the
use of a conference bridge and to record the total duration of the conference
connection.
EXAMPLE: Subscriber \"C\" calls subscriber \"A\". Subscriber \"A\" places the
call from \"C\" on hold and makes a second call to subscriber \"B\".
Subscriber \"A\" then invokes the multi-party service in order to set‑up a
conference call with \"B\" and \"C\".
Assuming that the appropriate types of record are enabled, the following CDRs
shall be produced:
\- An MOC record for subscriber \"C\" and the \"C\"->\"A\" leg of the call;
\- An MTC record for subscriber \"A\" and the \"C\"->\"A\" leg of the call;
\- An MOC record for subscriber \"A\" and the \"A\"->\"B\" leg of the call;
\- An SS-Action record for the invocation of the call hold service by
subscriber \"A\";
\- An MTC record for subscriber \"B\" and the \"A\"->\"B\" leg of the call;
\- An SS-Action record for the invocation of the multi-party service by
subscriber \"A\";
\- A common equipment record for the use of the conference bridge by
subscriber \"A\".
Each of the MOC/MTC records for the conference originator (\"A\") shall
include the supplementary service code for the multi-party service.
Any subsequent action affecting only one leg of the connection shall be
recorded either in a separate supplementary service action record or in-line
in the appropriate CDR. Any action affecting the conference as a whole e.g.
the originator holding the conference shall be recorded either in a separate
supplementary service action record or in the common equipment usage record.
For further information concerning the recording of multi-party services see
the example scenario in clause 5.2.1.9.
#### 5.1.3.6 Partial records
In order to increase the security of the recording process and to simplify
post-processing, it may be desirable to generate a sequence of CDRs to
describe a single connection or transaction.
In case of connections of extended duration, the loss of a single CDR may
result in an unacceptable loss of revenue. If the connection is, for example,
recorded in a number of consecutive partial records generated at say hourly
intervals, then the maximum loss of revenue is the equivalent of a one hour
continuous connection.
Most modern billing systems employ some form of cumulative credit-limit
checking based on the stream of input CDRs. If however, a CDR is only produced
at the end of the connection then a subscriber may avoid such credit checking
by employing a connection for days, weeks or even months without a single CDR
being produced.
All of the records defined in the present document are of variable length and
some at least are potentially unlimited in size (SET OF, SEQUENCE OF, etc.).
However, the storage capacity of the internal records within the network
element is normally subject to strict size limitations. Under such conditions
a partial record may be required in order to circumvent internal resource
limitations. For example, if an internal MOC record can only support the use
of four supplementary service invocations then the use of a fifth may result
in the generation of a partial record.
Alternatively, for those manufacturers whose systems are based on fixed length
records, partial records may be employed instead of the various lists
contained within the present document definitions. In such cases a partial
record will be produced each time one of the key fields alters during the
connection.
Finally, in case of radio link failure and subsequent call re-establishment
partial records shall be generated to record the duration of the call prior to
the radio link failure and the subsequent duration of the call once the call
has been re-established.
To summarize, the following events may result in the generation of a partial
record:
\- expiry of the partial record timer;
\- change of basic service during a connection;
\- change of location (MCC+MNC+ LAC or Cell Id. or the Service Access Code,
for UMTS) during a connection;
\- change of MS classmark during a connection;
\- change of AoC Parameters during a call;
\- change of Radio Channel Type (full/half rate) during a call;
\- radio link failure and subsequent call re-establishment;
\- change of HSCSD Parameters (for GSM only) during a call;
\- change of CAMEL destination (CAMEL controlled/initiated) during a call;
\- CAMEL CPH operations on call legs.
All partial records for the same connection shall contain the same call
reference and shall be ordered via a running sequence number. The time stamps
involved shall apply to the individual partial records rather than the
connection as a whole i.e. the \"end\" time stamp (duration) of one record
shall, in general, coincide with the \"start\" time stamp (answer time) of the
next. Each time a new partial record is created the cause for termination
field of the previous record shall contain the value \"partial record\". The
cause for termination of the final partial record shall contain the true cause
for termination of the connection.
It should be noted that the records produced in case of call re-establishment
are not contiguous and that the value of the cause for term field in the
record that is closed on radio link failure contains the value \"partial
record call re-establishment\".
The partial records generated may repeat each of the non-varying fields
contained in the original record. Alternatively, a form of reduced partial
record may be generated which includes only those fields required to identify
the original record together with the field(s) that actually change.
#### 5.1.3.7 Use of circuit-switched data services
If data services are employed in conjunction with a Packet-Switched Public
Data Network (PSPDN) then an MOC/MTC CDR may be produced in the
originating/terminating MSC server and a gateway record in the
gateway/interworking MSC server. If the packet volume is not available within
the PLMN then this information may also be provided in the form of a CDR from
the PSPDN. In such cases the Billing System is responsible for the correlation
of the various records describing the connection. The definition of such PSPDN
CDRs is outside the scope of the present document.
#### 5.1.3.8 Inter-MSC server handover
In the case of an inter-MSC server handover the controlling MSC server, as
defined by TS 23.009 [65], remains in control of the connection and shall
therefore, produce the CDR. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not necessary to
produce CDRs in the subsequent MSC server(s).
#### 5.1.3.9 Call re-establishment
In case of radio link failure as described in TS 24.008 [68], the MS may
attempt to re-establish the call using the procedures described in TS 24.008
[68].
For the time period between the detection of the radio link failure by the
mobile station and the successful re‑establishment of the call, the advice of
charge function in the MS is suspended as described in TS 24.086 [222]. In
order to minimize the difference in charges between the on-line calculations
performed by the MS and the off‑line processing on the basis of the CDRs, it
is necessary to exclude the time taken for the re-establishment phase from the
chargeable duration stored in the CDRs.
If the re-establishment attempt fails then an ordinary CDR (MOC/MTC) shall be
produced with the cause for termination value \"stable call abnormal
termination\". The chargeable duration stored in this record covers the time
period from \"Answer\" to the detection of the radio link failure by the MSC
server.
If, the attempt to re-establish the call succeeds then the current CDR shall
be closed with the cause for termination value \"partial record call re-
establishment\" and a new partial record shall be opened for the re-
established call. The chargeable duration stored in the original record is
once again the time period from \"answer\" to detection of the radio link
failure by the MSC server. Both the \"seizure\" and \"answer\" times of the
subsequent partial record correspond to the time at which the new traffic
channel is allocated for the re-established call.
Further radio link failures during the re-established call may result in the
generation of additional partial records as described above. All of the
partial records belonging to the same connection are identified by the same
call reference and a running sequence number.
NOTE: As the MS and MSC server may detect the radio link failure at different
points in time, it is not possible to guarantee that the duration used for the
AOC display corresponds to that recorded in the CDRs. The purpose of the above
procedure is merely to minimize any discrepancies that may occur.
#### 5.1.3.10 Restricted directory numbers
In addition to the information pertaining to the served mobile subscriber
(IMSI, MSISDN, etc.), the CDRs defined in the present document also contain
the directory numbers of other parties involved in the recorded connections or
transactions. In order to comply with data protection legislation, it is
necessary to distinguish between those numbers that may be passed on to third
parties and those that needs to be handled confidentially. As a result, each
of the number fields (e.g. calling/connected number) contains the presentation
and screening information defined in both TS 24.008 [68] and ISUP signalling.
If this information is supported by the network, then even restricted numbers
may be included in the appropriate records and suppressed off-line by the
administration or billing system. If this information is not supported then
the entire directory number shall be suppressed by the MSC server/VLR.
#### 5.1.3.11 IMEI Observation
In order to provide the data required by the mobile equipment management
activities outlined in the previous clauses, the MSC server shall be capable
of producing IMEI tickets for each of the following events:
  * usage of a blacklisted IMEI;
  * usage of a greylisted IMEI;
  * usage of an IMEI not found on the white list.
An observed IMEI ticket is generated whenever greylisted, blacklisted or non-
white listed mobile equipment is detected during an IMEI check. The purpose of
the ticket is to link the mobile equipment under observation with its current
user (IMSI). The ticket also includes information describing when and where
the equipment was used to enable the tracking of such equipment. Finally, if
the ticket was triggered by a call attempt, a call reference is provided in
order to locate the corresponding CDR.
The IMEI tickets are generated by the MSC server performing the IMEI check.
#### 5.1.3.12 Triggers for LCS-MT-CDR, LCS-MO-CDR and LCS-NI-CDR Charging
Information Collection
The LCS CDRs (LCS-MT-CDR, LCS-MO-CDR and LCS-NI-CDR) are used to collect
charging information related to the LCS features that the PLMN provides in the
Packet-Switched domain.
These records include details such as Record Type, Served IMSI, Sequence
Number etc. The LCS records are generated based on the following trigger
conditions:
  * the LCS-MO-CDR, when the MSC receives the RANAP \"Location report\" > message from the RNC;
  * the LCS-MT-CDR, when the MSC receives the RANAP \"Location report\" > message from the RNC;
  * the LCS-NI-CDR, when the MSC receives the RANAP \"Location report\" > message from the RNC.
#### 5.1.3.13 BS30 Accounting
BS30 is an example where the serving network may use a substantially higher
radio bandwidth than for a standard voice call. While the invocation of this
service, including the used radio resources, can be captured in the serving
MSC server, this is not possible in the GMSC server. However, if the inter-
network accounting is done based on GMSC CDRs, this information is needed by
the GMSC server in order to provide the required CDR information. To that end,
the serving MSC server can provide this information back to the GMSC server.
See clause 5.1.2.2.4 for further details.
#### 5.1.3.14 CAMEL Call Party Handling service
The following applies to MSCs that are capable of CAMEL Call Party Handling
(CPH):
For calls where CAMEL CPH is involved, one separate record is generated per
call segment. The CAMEL CPH service may be applied to originating, forwarded
and terminated calls as well as SCP initiated calls.
For MO, MT and CF call attempts, the fields related to the incoming leg are
recorded in the main body. The fields related to the outgoing legs of that
call segment are recorded in the respective grouped field (CAMEL call leg
information) per outgoing leg. User Interactions (UI) are recorded in a
separate grouped field like outgoing legs.
Records for gsmSCF initiated call attempts differ to MO, MT and CF records in
the following way: no leg information shall be recorded in the main body.
Where the use of CPH result in the creation of further call legs in one call
segment, additional grouped fields shall be added to the respective CDR.
Where the use of CPH result in the creation of further call legs in a new call
segment, a further CDR shall be generated.
A CDR is closed when the last leg of the call segment disappeared (moved out,
disconnected, etc. ) from the call segment.
When a call leg is moved from one call segment to another, the grouped field
for that call leg is closed in the respective CDR and a new grouped field is
opened in the CDR of the call segment the call leg was moved to.
When the incoming leg (recorded in the main body), is moved from one call
segment to another, the grouped field(s) for the outgoing call leg(s) is/are
aligned to reflect the new call constellation.
User interactions (announcements etc.) are recorded in the CDR of the related
call segment as a separate grouped field similar to call legs.
The leg specific fields listed below shall be recorded in the grouped field
\'CAMEL Call Leg Information\' instead of using the counterpart in the main
body. The counterparts of those fields in the main body are maintained for
compatibility reasons to earlier releases.
\- CAMEL Destination Number
\- Translated Number
\- Connected Number
\- Roaming Number
\- Outgoing TKGP (in \'CAMLEL Call Leg Information\' this item is called\ MSC
outgoing TKGP)
\- Additional Chg. Info
\- Default call handling 2
\- GsmSCF address 2
\- Service key 2
\- Free format data 2 (in \'CAMEL Call Leg Information\' this item is called\
Free format data incoming 2)
\- Free format data append indicator 2 (in \'CAMEL Call Leg Information\' this
item is called\ Free format data append incoming 2)
Editor's note: both parameters from the second FCI operation should be
clarified, also in the CDR table
\- Location Routing Number (LRN)
\- LRN Source Indicator
\- LRN Query Status Indicator
\- JIP Parameter
\- JIP Source Indicator
\- JIP Query Status Indicator
#### 5.1.3.15 Service Change and Fallback
Service Change and UDI/RDI Fallback (SCUDIF) **provides the possibility of
changing the transport bearer capabilities for circuit switched multimedia
applications using 64 kbit/s UDI refer TS 23.172 [209].**
**It** allows users to achieve successful call establishment when end to end
circuit-switched (CS) multimedia is not possible (fallback to speech) or when
signalling of the feature is not possible in the network (fallback to
preferred service). Furthermore, it allows the users to swap between a
multimedia service and basic speech during an established call.
SCUDIF functionality encloses two sub-functionalities:
**\- Service-Change:** when two services (multimedia and speech) are available
during the active call, users may request a Service-Change to switch between
the two services.
**\- Fallback** : when two services (multimedia and speech and visa versa) are
proposed but only one of them is available or wanted, only the available
service is selected, e.g. fallback from multimedia to speech.
Editor's note: More details for the charging description are needed.
#### 5.1.3.16 CS Fallback and SMS over SGs
CS Fallback is defined in TS 23.272 [214] and provides a mechanism to move a
UE from EUTRAN PS only access to CS to deliver voice service i.e. over GSM or
UMTS access. As a result, charging procedures for call handling are performed
as per GSM and UMTS access.
Within SMS over SGs also defined in TS 23.272 [214], SMS is delivered in the
EUTRAN NAS signalling via the SGs interface between the MME and the MSC/VLR.
#### 5.1.3.17 Enhanced MSC server for SRVCC support
The standard MSC behaviour is enhanced for supporting Single Radio Voice Call
Continuity (SRVCC) between E‑UTRAN access and UTRAN/GERAN accesses, between
UTRAN (HSPA) access and UTRAN/GERAN accesses, for voice calls and emergency
calls anchored in the IMS, as defined in TS 23.216 [215]. Charging is provided
from the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC for successful calls/emergency calls
transfer.
When session transfer procedure from IMS to CS is performed by MSC server
enhanced for SRVCC interfacing IMS through a SIP interface, according to TS
23.237 [223], this MSC server enhanced for SRVCC behaves as an end-point of
the IMS domain, and as such, generates an IMS Charging Identifier (ICID) in
order to allow correlation. See TS 32.260 [20] for IMS Charging Identifier
(ICID) definition.
The Network provided Location information (NetLoc) is described in the TS
23.228 [211] and for emergency service request using PCC-based solutions for
the UE location in TS 23.167 [218].
Note: In case of SRVCC the "anchor MSC" is not aware of some relevant call
information e.g duration of the whole call, real called_number, because the
call previously started on PS side before the transfer to CS-side . Only the
IMS Charging is aware of whole duration of the call.
#### 5.1.3.18 Mobile Terminating Roaming Forwarding call after successful
Retrieval of Routeing Information (MTRF)
Mobile Terminating Roaming Forwarding call after successful Retrieval of
Routeing Information (MTRF) procedure is described in TS 23.018 [216] and
provides a mechanism to reroute a terminating call while the called mobile is
simultaneously moving from an old to a new MSC/VLR.
The charging procedures for call handling are performed as for a terminating
call in the new MSC/VLR to which the call is rerouted. Dedicated charging is
provided by the old MSC/VLR from which the call is rerouted as a result of
MTRF procedure, in order to complete the set of CDRs produced along the path
of the call and avoid charging duplication.
When the terminating call is rerouted towards a new MSC/VLR which is located
in a different PLMN than the Old MSC/VLR, a roaming CDR is produced by the Old
MSC/VLR, even when the new MSC/VLR resides in HPLMN.
The same charging behaviour applies for Roaming Forwarding for CS Fallback
defined in TS 23.272 [214].
#### 5.1.3.19 Enhanced MSC server for ICS support
The standard MSC behaviour is enhanced for supporting ICS for voice/video
calls, as defined in TS 23.292 [219]. Charging is provided from the MSC server
enhanced for ICS for voice/video call.
When session setup is performed by MSC server enhanced for ICS interfacing IMS
through a SIP interface, according to TS 23.292 [219], this MSC server
enhanced for ICS behaves as an end-point of the IMS domain, and as such,
generates an IMS Charging Identifier (ICID) in order to allow correlation.
Terminating case the IMS Charging Identifier (ICID) may be generated by one
IMS network element (e.g. the P-CSCF originating side) and forwarded to
another IMS network elements. Enhanced MSC server for ICS receives the ICID by
the INVITE from incoming side. The MSC server enhanced for ICS includes the
ICID to CDRs for correlation purpose.
In register case the MSC server also generates the Inter Operator Identifier
(IOI) for identifiying involved network in a REGISTER-transaction.
In addition to the standard MSC Server behaviour, an MSC Server that has been
enhanced for ICS shall provide the User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI)
and/or UE Time Zone for an identified ICS user as specified in\ TS 23.292
[219].
The MSC server shall include the ICID as specified in TS 32.260 [20].
## 5.2 CS domain offline charging scenarios
### 5.2.1 Basic principles
#### 5.2.1.0 Introduction
This clause contains a number of example scenarios illustrating the purpose
and practical usage of the various types of records defined in the previous
clauses. These examples are by no means exhaustive.
For the purpose of these examples, the following assumptions have been made:
\- that the MSC server and VLR are co-located;
\- that the records are sent to a post-processing system;
\- that the generation of all of the record types described in this clause has
been enabled;
\- that the HLR interrogation records are produced in the HLR and not the
interrogating MSC server;
\- that supplementary service actions are recorded in separate CDRs.
The following conventions have been used for the figures contained within this
clause:
1) Network connections and signalling transactions are illustrated by means of
solid lines and referenced by number e.g. (1);
2) Operation & Maintenance actions, such as the transfer of CDRs, are
represented by means of dotted lines and referenced by letter e.g. (A);
3) The Billing System has been included in some, but not all, of the examples.
The only reason for this decision is to simplify the resulting figures. The
presence of a Billing System is assumed even if not explicitly included.
The following examples are included:
1) Mobile to Land (outgoing) call;
2) Land to Mobile (incoming) call;
3) Mobile to Mobile call within the same network;
4) Incoming call to a roaming subscriber;
5) Incoming call to a PLMN Service Centre;
6) Call Forwarding Unconditional;
7) Call Forwarding conditional (on Busy);
8) Delivery of a Mobile Terminated Short Message;
9) Call Hold and Multi-party services;
10) Outgoing call handled by CAMEL;
11) Incoming call handled by CAMEL without redirection;
12) Incoming call to a roaming subscriber handled by CAMEL;
13) Incoming call handled by CAMEL with redirection decided and forwarding leg
handled by CAMEL;
14) Incoming call handled by CAMEL without redirection and forwarded early
using GSM SS but controlled by CAMEL;
15) Incoming call handled by CAMEL without redirection and forwarded late
using GSM SS but controlled by CAMEL;
16) Early forwarded call controlled by CAMEL;
17) Late forwarded call controlled by CAMEL;
18) Incoming call handled by CAMEL with redirection initiated by CAMEL
feature;
19) Incoming call handled by CAMEL in MSC Server without redirection;
20) Outgoing call handled by CAMEL Dialled CSI Trigger;
21) Incoming call handled by CAMEL with redirection decided and forwarding leg
handled by CAMEL;
22) gsmSCF initiated wake-up call handled by CAMEL CPH;
23) Three party conference handled by CAMEL CPH;
24) Mobile terminated location request;
25) Mobile originating by ICS register;
26) ICS user registration via CS access.
#### 5.2.1.1 Mobile to land (outgoing) call
Figure 5.2.1.1 illustrates a simple outgoing call from a PLMN subscriber \"A\"
to a fixed network subscriber \"B\" (1).
The originating MSC server (MSC-A) shall generate an MOC record for subscriber
\"A\".
The GMSC server shall create an outgoing gateway record for accounting with
the fixed network including details of the point at which the call left the
PLMN i.e. the GMSC server id. and outgoing trunk group. This record also
includes time stamps to determine both the holding time of the outgoing trunk
and the duration of the conversation.
Even if the MSC server and GMSC server are co-located both records shall be
produced.
The records generated are subsequently transferred to the Billing System of
the PLMN (A).
Figure 5.2.1.1: Mobile to land (outgoing) call
#### 5.2.1.2 Land to mobile (incoming) call
Figure 5.2.1.2 illustrates a simple incoming call from a fixed network
subscriber \"A\" to a PLMN subscriber \"B\".
The incoming call is first routed to a GMSC server (1). The GMSC server shall
create an incoming gateway record for fixed network accounting purposes to
record the point at which the call entered the network together with the time
stamps required to calculate the holding time of the incoming trunk and the
conversation duration. This gateway record shall contain the IMSI of the
called subscriber.
The GMSC server interrogates the HLR of the called subscriber in order to
determine his current location (2). The HLR shall create an HLR interrogation
CDR.
The GMSC server routes the call to the MSC server at which the subscriber is
currently registered (3). This terminating MSC server (MSC-B) shall create an
MTC record for subscriber \"B\".
Even if the MSC server and GMSC server are co-located both the MTC and gateway
records shall be produced.
The records generated are subsequently transferred to the Billing System of
the PLMN (A).
Figure 5.2.1.2: Land to mobile (incoming) call
#### 5.2.1.3 Mobile to mobile call within the same network
Figure 5.2.1.3 illustrates a simple mobile to mobile call from subscriber
\"A\" to subscriber \"B\" both within the same PLMN.
The originating MSC server (MSC-A) shall produce an MOC record for the call to
subscriber \"B\".
Having received a set-up request from subscriber \"A\" (1), MSC-A interrogates
the HLR of the called subscriber in order to determine his current location
(2). The HLR shall create an HLR interrogation CDR.
MSC-A routes the call to the MSC server at which subscriber is currently
registered (3). This terminating MSC server (MSC-B) shall create an MTC record
for subscriber \"B\". If MSC-A and MSC-B are co-located, then both the MOC and
the MTC records shall be produced in the same MSC for this call.
The records generated are subsequently transferred to the Billing System of
the PLMN.
Figure 5.2.1.3: Mobile to mobile call
#### 5.2.1.4 Incoming call to a roaming subscriber
Figure 5.2.1.4 illustrates an incoming call from a fixed network subscriber
\"A\" to a PLMN subscriber \"B\" who is currently roaming in another PLMN.
The call is first routed to a GMSC server (1) and the GMSC server shall create
an incoming gateway record for accounting purposes as described in clause
5.2.1.2. The GMSC server interrogates the HLR of the called subscriber in
order to determine his current location (2). The HLR shall create an
Interrogation event record.
The GMSC server routes the call to the VPLMN in which subscriber \"B\" is
currently located (3). The GMSC server shall create an outgoing gateway record
for accounting purposes. The GMSC server shall also create a roaming record.
This record includes the IMSI of the \"B\" subscriber and may be used as a
cross-check for the TAP information received from the VPLMN.
The call is then routed by the VPLMN to the MSC server at which the subscriber
is currently located (4). The GMSC server of the VPLMN shall produce an
incoming gateway record and the terminating MSC server shall create an MTC
record for the call to \"B\".
The records generated are subsequently transferred to the Billing System of
the appropriate PLMN (A). The MTC record generated by the terminating MSC
server shall be employed to create the appropriate MTC TAP record. The TAP
records shall be included in a TAP file and transmitted to the HPLMN (B).
Figure 5.2.1.4: Incoming call to a roaming subscriber
#### 5.2.1.5 Incoming call to a PLMN service centre
Figure 5.2.1.5 illustrates an incoming call from a fixed network subscriber
\"A\" to a Service Centre directly connected to an MSC server within a PLMN
network. Examples for services provided by such a Service Centre include Voice
Mail services, Operator services, etc.
The call is routed to a GMSC server within the PLMN (1). The GMSC server
analyses the dialled digits and routes the call directly to the MSC server to
which the Service Centre is connected (2).
As HLR interrogation is not required, there will be no HLR Interrogation
record. The GMSC server shall however, create an incoming gateway record based
on the point at which the call entered the network and the destination
(Service Centre) of the call.
The MSC server then connects the calling subscriber to the service centre. As
no mobile subscriber is involved, the MSC server will not create an MTC
record, however, the MSC server shall create a transit record describing the
destination of the call.
The records generated are subsequently transferred to the Billing System of
the PLMN (A).
It should be noted that without the transit record, the MSC server would not
generate a record for this connection.

#### 5.2.1.6 Call forwarding unconditional
Figure 5.2.1.6 illustrates an incoming call from a fixed network subscriber
\"A\" to a mobile subscriber \"B\" who has registered and activated Call
Forwarding Unconditional (CFU) for the appropriate service. The call is
subsequently forwarded to a second fixed network subscriber \"C\".
For simplicity the registration and activation of CFU have not been included
in the diagram. These actions shall of course be recorded in the appropriate
supplementary service records.
The incoming call is routed to a GMSC server (1). This part of the connection
is identical to the scenario outlined in clause 5.2.1.2.
The GMSC server interrogates the HLR of the called subscriber in order to
determine his current location (2). The HLR shall create an HLR interrogation
CDR. The HLR informs the GMSC server that \"B\" has activated CFU to
subscriber \"C\".
The GMSC server forwards the call to the fixed network subscriber \"C\" (3).
The GMSC server shall create an MTC record for the \"B\" subscriber for the
call from \"A\" and an MOC (call forwarding) record for the \"B\" subscriber
for the call to \"C\". Both records shall contain the supplementary service
employed (CFU). The GMSC server shall also produce an outgoing gateway record
as described in clause 5.2.1.1.
The records generated are subsequently transferred to the Billing System of
the HPLMN (A).
Figure 5.2.1.6: Call forwarding unconditional
#### 5.2.1.7 Call forwarding conditional (on busy)
Figure 5.2.1.7 illustrates a mobile originated call from subscriber \"A\" to a
second mobile subscriber \"B\" who has registered and activated Call
Forwarding on Busy (CFB) for the appropriate service. The call is subsequently
forwarded to a third mobile subscriber \"C\". In this example, all three
subscribers are currently located within the same (the home) network.
For simplicity the registration and activation of CFB have not been included
in the diagram.
Having received a set-up request from subscriber \"A\" (1), the originating
MSC server (MSC-A) interrogates the HLR of subscriber \"B\" in order to
determine his current location (1a). The call is then routed to MSC-B (2).
MSC-A shall create an MOC record for subscriber \"A\" containing details of
the call to \"B\". The HLR shall produce an HLR interrogation record.
On determining that subscriber \"B\" is busy and that CFB is active, the
forwarding MSC server/VLR (MSC-B) interrogates the HLR of subscriber \"C\" to
determine his current location (2a) and forwards the call accordingly (3).
MSC-B shall produce an MTC record for the \"B\" subscriber for the call from
\"A\" and an MOC record for the \"B\" subscriber for the call to \"C\". Both
records shall include the supplementary service employed (CFB). The HLR shall
produce an Interrogation record.
The terminating MSC server (MSC-C) shall create a normal MTC record for
subscriber \"C\".
The records generated are subsequently transferred to the Billing System of
the PLMN.

#### 5.2.1.8 Delivery of a mobile terminated short message
Figure 5.2.1.8 illustrates the delivery of a short message to a mobile
subscriber.
The short message service centre delivers the message to a GMSC server or
gateway function (1). The GMSC server shall create an SMS gateway MT record.
The GMSC server then interrogates the HLR of the subscriber to determine his
current location (2). The HLR shall create an HLR interrogation record.
The message is subsequently transmitted to the MSC server serving the mobile
subscriber and finally to the mobile station of that subscriber (3). The MSC
server shall create an SMS MT record.
The records generated are subsequently transferred to the post-processing
system of the HPLMN (A).
Figure 5.2.1.8: Delivery of a short message to a mobile subscriber
#### 5.2.1.9 Call hold and multi-party service
Figure 5.2.1.9 illustrates the use of the call hold and multi-party services.
A mobile subscriber (\"A\") sets up an outgoing call (1) to an ISDN subscriber
(\"B\"). This call is recorded as outlined in clause 5.2.1.1.
Subscriber \"A\" then invokes the call hold service. MSC-A shall produce a
supplementary service action record for the invocation.
Subscriber \"A\" then sets up a side-call (2) to a second mobile subscriber
(\"C\") within the same network. This call is recorded as outlined in clause
5.2.1.3.
Subscriber \"A\" subsequently invokes the multi-party service in order to set
up a three-party conference with \"B\" and \"C\". MSC-A shall produce a common
equipment record for the use of a conference circuit by subscriber \"A\". This
record shall record the duration of the whole conference irrespective of the
number of parties subsequently added to, or removed from the conference
connection.
Note that the MOC records produced by MSC-A for both the A -> B and A -> C
legs of the conference shall contain the supplementary service code for multi-
party.

#### 5.2.1.10 Outgoing call handled by CAMEL
Figure 5.2.1.10 illustrates an outgoing CAMEL call from a mobile CAMEL
subscriber \"A\" to a fixed network subscriber \"B\" (1).
The \"A\" subscriber has an active O-CSI (stored in the VLR). Therefore MSC
server-A requests instructions from the gsmSSF which passes the CAMEL service
key to the gsmSCF to indicate which service logic it should apply (2).
The gsmSCF may interrogate the HLR for subscriber information. As a network
option, the operator may refuse to provide the requested information.
When gsmSCF processing is complete the call control is returned to MSC-A.
MSC server-A generates an MOC record for the \"A\" subscriber. This record may
be linked to an optional SCF-record. The record includes O-CSI data.
The GMSC server routes the call to the \"B\" subscriber (3). The GMSC server
shall create an outgoing gateway record as described in clause 5.2.1.1.
The generated records are subsequently transferred to the Billing System of
the HPLMN (A).

The GMSC server routes the call to the VPLMN in which subscriber \"B\" is
currently located (5). The GMSC server shall create an outgoing gateway record
for accounting purposes. The GMSC server shall also create a roaming record.
This record includes the IMSI of the \"B\" subscriber and may be used as a
cross-check for the TAP information received from the VPLMN.
The call is then routed by the VPLMN to the MSC server at which the subscriber
is currently located (6). The GMSC server of the VPLMN shall produce an
incoming gateway record and the terminating MSC server shall create an MTC
record for the call to \"B\".
The records generated are subsequently transferred to the Billing System of
the appropriate PLMN (A). The MTC record generated by the terminating MSC
server shall be employed to create the appropriate MTC TAP record. The TAP

to a second fixed network subscriber \"C\" by CAMEL initiated redirection.
The incoming call is routed to the GMSC server (1). The GMSC server shall
create an incoming gateway record for fixed network accounting purposes.
The GMSC server interrogates the HLR of the called subscriber in order to
fetch the T-CSI (2) and the O-CSI (2). The HLR shall create an HLR
interrogation record.
Since subscriber \"B\" has an active T-CSI and the trigger criteria are met
the GMSC server requests instructions from the gsmSSF which passes the CAMEL
service key to a gsmSCF to indicate which service logic it should apply (3). A
terminating CAMEL interrogation record is generated in the GMSC server for
invoking the terminating CAMEL call handling.
The gsmSCF may interrogate the HLR for subscriber information. As a network
option, the operator may refuse to provide the requested information.
The gsmSCF returns a modified destination routing address to the GMSC server
(without the option \"apply O-CSI\"). Therefore for the redirection leg (B-C)
the CAMEL feature is not invoked.
The GMSC server redirects the call to the fixed network subscriber \"C\" (4).

\"A\" to a mobile CAMEL subscriber \"B\".
The incoming call is first routed to the GMSC (1). The GMSC shall create an
incoming gateway record for fixed network accounting purposes.
The GMSC interrogates the HLR (2) of the called subscriber. The HLR shall
create an HLR interrogation record. The call is routed to MSC-B(3). An MTC
record shall be generated in MSC-B.
The \"B\" subscriber has an active VT-CSI (stored in the VLR). For avoidance
of doubt in this scenario, the \"B\" subscriber does not have an active T-CSI
in the HLR. Therefore MSC-B requests instructions from the gsmSSF which passes
the CAMEL service key to the gsmSCF to indicate which service logic it should
apply (4).
The gsmSCF may interrogate the HLR for subscriber information. As a network
option, the operator may refuse to provide the requested information.
When gsmSCF processing is complete the call control is returned to the MSC-B.
The MSC-B shall generate a terminating CAMEL (TCR) record which contains VT-
CSI data.
The MSC-B routes the call to the \"B\" subscriber (5).
For avoidance of doubt, even if the MSC and GMSC are co-located both the
MTC/TCR and gateway records shall be produced.
The generated records are subsequently transferred to the OS (A) either as

The gsmSCF may interrogate the HLR for subscriber information. As a network
option, the operator may refuse to provide the requested information.
The gsmSCF modifies the Called Party number and sets the CAP parameter 'Apply
O-CSI\'. When gsmSCF processing is complete the call control is returned to
the GMSC server. The GMSC server shall generate a terminating CAMEL
interrogation record which contains T-CSI data.
The \"B\" subscriber has an active O-CSI. Therefore the GMSC server requests
instructions from the gsmSSF which passes the CAMEL service key to a gsmSCF to
indicate which service logic it should apply (4).
The gsmSCF may interrogate the HLR for subscriber information. As a network
option, the operator may refuse to provide the requested information.
The gsmSCF modifies the Called Party number. When gsmSCF processing is
complete the call control is returned to the GMSC server.
The \"B\" subscriber has an active D-CSI (modified Called Party number matches
D-CSI). Therefore the GMSC server requests instructions from the gsmSSF which
passes the CAMEL service key to a gsmSCF to indicate which service logic it
should apply (5).
The gsmSCF may interrogate the HLR for subscriber information. As a network
option, the operator may refuse to provide the requested information. When
gsmSCF processing is complete the call control is returned to the GMSC server.
The GMSC server redirects the call to the fixed network subscriber \"C\" (6).
The GMSC server shall generate an MTC record for the \"B\" subscriber for the
call from \"A\" and an MOC (call forwarding) record for the \"B\" subscriber
for the call to \"C\". The MOC record includes O-CSI data, the parameter
'CAMEL initiated CF indicator\' and D-CSI data. The GMSC server shall also
produce an outgoing gateway record as described in clause 5.2.1.1.
The generated records are subsequently transferred to the post-processing
system (A) either as event reports following the release of the connection or
when collected by the post-processing system.
The following records are generated in HPLMN in this call scenario.

Figure 5.2.1.22 illustrates general network positioning for LCS clients
external to the PLMN.
An external LCS client requests the current location of a target UE from a
GMLC (1). In this release the GMLC shall not create any LCS record.
The GMLC server then interrogates the HLR of the target UE to be located to
determine his current location (2). The HLR shall create an HLR interrogation
record.
The GMLC sends the location service request to the MSC indicated by the HLR.
The MSC sends a Location Request message to RAN that initiates the positioning
procedure (3). The MSC shall create an LCS-MT record.
The records generated are subsequently transferred to the Billing System of
the PLMN (A).

A mobile CAMEL subscriber \"A\" sets up an outgoing call (1) to an ISDN
subscriber (\"B\"). This call is recorded as outlined in clause 5.2.1.1.
gsmSCF then invokes CPH operation \'initiate call attempt\' (2). A new call
segment (CS#2) with an outgoing leg \"C\" is created in MSC-A.
MSC-A interrogates the HLR in order to determine the current location of
subscriber \"C\" (3). The HLR shall create an interrogation record.
MSC-A initiates set-up of an outgoing leg towards mobile subscriber \"C\" (4).
MSC-A shall create an MOC record for the leg towards mobile subscriber \"C\".
MSC-C shall create a MTC record for subscriber \"C\".
gsmSCF then invokes CPH operation \'MoveLeg\' to join all three legs in one
call segment (5). MSC-A shall close the MOC record for call segment CS#2 to
outgoing leg \"C\". The MOC record for the outgoing call of the mobile CAMEL
subscriber \"A\" to ISDN subscriber \"B\" shall be updated to cover the

If generation of these records is enabled then a transit record may be
generated for each incoming call attempt received by a Transit MSC i.e.
neither originating nor terminating. For the avoidance of doubt, a transit
record shall only be produced if no MOC or MTC record is produced for this
call attempt by this MSC. The transit records, produced in the TMSC, may be

#### 6.1.3.9 Supplementary service actions
A supplementary service record may be produced in the NEF of the appropriate
MSC or HLR for each supplementary service action (activation, deactivation,
invocation etc.) performed or initiated by the subscriber.
\- There are two fundamental types of SS-actions: Call related i.e. as a
result of a connection,\ e.g. Invocation of CLIP / CLIR / AoC, etc.
\- Non-call related i.e. as a result of Subscriber Controlled Input (SCI) e.g.
Registration of call forwarding.
Each supplementary service action shall be performed on one or more basic
service groups. If the action applies to all teleservices and all bearer
services (i.e. to all basic services) then the basic services field shall be
omitted.
SCI actions may be recorded in individual SS-action records. Call related
actions may be recorded in either the appropriate call record (MOC/MTC) or in
separate SS-action records.
Additional non-standard supplementary service actions may be made available
within some networks in the form of Unstructured Supplementary Service Data
(USSD). These actions may also be recorded in SS-action records. However, as
these actions are non-standard they may not include an appropriate action
type, supplementary service code or basic service code.

#### 6.1.3.19 IMEI observation ticket
An observed IMEI ticket is generated whenever greylisted, blacklisted or non-
white listed mobile equipment is detected during an IMEI check. The purpose of
the ticket is to link the mobile equipment under observation with its current
user (IMSI). The ticket also includes information describing when and where
the equipment was used to enable the tracking of such equipment. Finally, if
the ticket was triggered by a call attempt, a call reference is provided in
order to locate the corresponding call record.
The IMEI tickets are generated by the NEF of the MSC performing the IMEI
check.

#### 6.1.3.23 Mobile originated call attempt (CAMEL CPH adapted version)
If the MSC / gsmSCF is able to provide CAMEL CPH services, this kind of record
shall replace records according to clause 6.1.3.1 \"Mobile originated call
attempt\". This applies to all mobile originated call attempts, even if no CPH
operations are used in the individual call. Record fields that are specific to
individual outgoing legs are recorded in the grouped field \"CAMEL Call Leg
Information\".
If the generation of this kind of record is enabled then the MSC shall produce
one MOC record. The incoming leg is recorded in the main body. Whenever there
is a CAMEL dialogue, outgoing legs of the same call segment are recorded in
the grouped field \"CAMEL call leg information\". Further legs in new call
segments are recorded in CDRs of type \"6.1.3.25 New Call Segment in a MO, CF
or MT CAMEL Dialogue\".
Examples for call situations where this type of record applies are the
following:
\- Mobile originating call without CPH being involved,
\- Mobile originating call continuing after disconnect of the incoming leg in
case of no partial record generation.\ When partial records are generated,
they are of type \"6.1.3.25 New Call Segment in a MO, CF or MT CAMEL
Dialogue\",
\- Mobile originating call with more than one outgoing leg on this call
segment,
\- Mobile originating call in which the original outgoing leg has been
disconnected by gsmSCF.
Disconnect of the incoming leg is recorded by filling the related record
fields in the main body of the record. Optionally a partial record may be
generated. This partial record is of type \"6.1.3.24 gsmSSF initiated CAMEL
CPH call attempt\".
Disappearing (DisconnectLeg, SplitLeg, etc.) of an outgoing leg is recorded by
filling the related record fields in the \"CAMEL Call Leg Information\" field
for the disappearing leg. Optionally a partial record may be generated. This
partial record does not contain information of the leg that disappeared, i.e.
it does not contain a \"CAMEL Call Leg Information\" field for that leg.
Connection of a further leg to this call segment is recorded by adding a
further field \"CAMEL Call Leg Information\". Optionally a partial record may
be generated.

#### 6.1.3.24 gsmSCF initiated CAMEL CPH call attempt
If the generation of these records is enabled then an MOC record shall be
created for each gsmSCF initiated call attempt and for new parties in new call
segments, which are created in a new call dialogue. Examples for call
situations where this type of record applies are the following:
\- gsmSCF initiated call segment association (new call):\ There is only one
call segment. It contains the outgoing leg, which is created via CPH Initiate
Call Attempt operation (ICA).
\-- This outgoing leg can be connected to an SRF, which is recorded in the
same record in the field \"CAMEL Call Leg Information\".
\- gsmSCF initiated new party in an already established gsmSCF initiated CAP
dialogue (new leg):\ In a new call dialogue a further call leg in a new call
segment is initiated via ICA operation.
\-- This call segment contains one outgoing leg, which can be connected to an
SRF. This leg and if used the SRF are recorded in the record for this call
segment in the field \"CAMEL Call Leg Information\".
\-- This leg can be connected to the other outgoing leg. This would terminate
the call segment and thus the call record. The \"Cause for Termination\"
indicates the reason for disappearing of the leg in this call segment. The
Timestamps (\"Call Duration\", \"Release Time\", etc.) are filled in. The
record of the call segment the leg is moved to records the leg in a further
field \"CAMEL Call Leg Information\".
\-- The other leg could be connected to this leg which is recorded by adding a
further field \"CAMEL Call Leg Information\".
Record fields for an incoming leg do not exist, because there is no incoming
leg in the call segment this record is created for.

#### 6.1.3.25 New Call Segment in a MO, CF and MT CAMEL Dialogue
If the generation of these records is enabled then an MOC record shall be
created for call segments without incoming leg, generated by a CAMEL dialogue
for mobile originated, call forwarding or mobile terminating call attempts.
Examples for call situations where this type of record applies are the
following:
\- Additional call segment, which is created by means of a \"SplitLeg\"
operation or ICA (new party) operation.
\- This call segment contains one outgoing leg, which can be connected to an
SRF. This leg and if used the SRF are recorded in the record for this call
segment in the field \'Camel Call Leg Information\'.
\- This leg can be connected to the other outgoing leg. This would terminate
the call segment and thus the call record. The \"Cause for Termination\"
indicates the reason for disappearing of the leg in this call segment. The
Timestamps (\"Call Duration\", \"Release Time\", etc.) are filled in. The
record of the call segment the leg is moved to records the leg in a further
field \'Camel Call Leg Information\'.
\- The other leg could be connected to this leg which is recorded by adding a
further field \"CAMEL Call Leg Information\".
\- Call segment where the incoming leg disappeared (e.g. due to SplitLeg or
DisconnectLeg operation). A record of this type is generated if partial
records are generated.
Although an incoming leg does not exists, the \"IMSI\", the \"IMEI\" and the
\"Service Key\" is recorded in the main body.

#### 6.1.3.26 Mobile originated call forwarding attempt (CAMEL CPH adapted
version)
If the MSC / gsmSCF is able to provide CAMEL CPH services, this kind of record
shall replace records according to clause 6.1.3.3 \"Mobile originated call
forwarding attempt\". This applies to all mobile originated call forwarding
attempts, even if no CPH operations are used in the individual call.
If the generation of MOC records is enabled in the forwarding MSC then the
forwarding MSC shall produce an MOC record for the forwarded-leg of the call.
If further legs in new call segments are generated by this CAMEL dialogue,
they are recorded in CDRs of type \"6.1.3.25 New Call Segment in a MO, CF or
MT CAMEL Dialogue\".

#### 6.1.3.27 Terminating CAMEL call attempt (CAMEL CPH adapted version)
If the MSC / gsmSCF is able to provide CAMEL CPH services, this kind of record
shall replace records according to clause 6.1.3.18 \"Terminating CAMEL call
attempt\". This applies to all terminating CAMEL call attempts, even if no CPH
operations are used in the individual call.
If the generation of these records is enabled, a terminating CAMEL call
attempt record shall be generated for each call involving CAMEL CPH
operations. The record is generated in the GMSC/gsmSSF carrying out the
terminating CAMEL call handling and in the MSC server/gsmSSF carrying out the
visited terminating CAMEL call attempt.
If further legs in new call segments are generated by this CAMEL dialogue,
they are recorded in CDRs of type \"6.1.3.25 New Call Segment in a MO, CF or

## 6.2 Data description for CS domain online charging
### 6.2.0 General
CS domain charging is implemented by CAMEL techniques as described in TS
23.078 [67] and TS 29.078 [73], i.e. it is outside the scope of the 3GPP
32-series charging TSs.
### 6.2.1 Diameter message contents
Void (refer to clause 6.2.0).
###### ## Annex A (informative): CDR File Transfer compliant with earlier 3GPP
releases
This group of TMN functions is concerned with the bulk transfer of call and
event records from the NEF record filestore to the NEF.
The call and event records shall be transferred from the NEF to the OSF by the
use of FTAM protocol on X.25 or TCP/IP, and FTP or TFTP over TCP/IP. For
further details of the use of FTAM see GSM 12.01 [297] and of the use of FTP
see RFC 959 [400] and TFTP see [401].
In addition to the simple file transfer services provided by FTAM, peer-to-
peer application process communication may be also be supported. The use of
CMIS services for the uploading of files from the NEF to the OSF is specified
in GSM 12.00 [296].
###### ## Annex B (informative): Bibliography
This Annex is a placeholder for documents which are not explicitly cited in
this specification.
###### ##
###### ## Annex C (informative): Charging support for Voice Call Continuity
(VCC)
VCC is a home IMS application that provides capabilities to transfer voice
calls between the CS domain and the IMS. VCC provides functions for voice call
originations, voice call terminations and for domain transfers between the CS
domain and the IMS. This feature is defined in TS 23.206 [210].
The following principles apply to VMSC/GMSC that are capable of VCC:
In case of CS Origination call with anchoring in the IMS, the Access Leg is
charged as follows: Normal MOC CDR is generated by the VMSC with special
handling. One example of special handling is to zero rate the CS resource
usage. This can be performed using the \"Service Key\" parameter in the MOC
Record indicating a VCC call. The CDRs generated within the IMS domain to
complete the anchoring mechanism are handled as specified in TS 32.260 [55].
In case of IMS origination call, the Access Leg is charged as follows: Normal
IMS and IP-CAN (e.g. WLAN or GSM/GPRS) charging mechanism are applied. These
mechanisms are defined in TS 32.260 [55] and IP-CAN Middle Tier TS
respectively.
In case of Incoming call received via CS and routed to IMS, the Remote Leg is
charged as follows: Normal MTC CDRs are generated by the GMSC of the
terminating network with special handling. One example of special handling is
to zero rate the CS resource usage. This can be performed using the \"Service
Key\" parameter in the MTC Records indicating a VCC call. The CDRs generated
within the IMS domain to complete the domain selection procedure are handled
as specified in TS 32.260 [55].
In case of Incoming call received via CS and routed to CS with anchoring, the
Remote Leg is charged as follows: Normal MTC CDRs are generated by the GMSC
and the VMSC in the terminating network with special handling. One example of
special handling is to zero rate the CS resource usage. This can be performed
using the \"Service Key\" parameter in the MTC Records indicating a VCC call.
The CDRs generated within the IMS domain to complete the anchoring procedure
are handled as specified in TS 32.260 [55].
In case of Incoming call received via IMS and routed to IMS, the Remote Leg is
charged as follows: Normal IMS and IP-CAN (e.g. WLAN or GSM/GPRS) charging
mechanism are applied. These mechanisms are defined in TS 32.260 [55] and IP-
CAN middle tier TS respectively.
In case of Incoming call received via IMS and routed to CS with anchoring, the
Remote Leg is charged as follows: Normal MTC CDRs are generated by the GMSC or
the VMSC in ther terminating network with special handling. One example of
special handling is to zero rate the CS resource usage. This can be performed
using the \"Service Key\" parameter in the MTC Records indicating a VCC call.
The CDRs generated within the IMS domain to complete the domain selection
procedure are handled as specified in TS 32.260 [55].
In case of domain transfer from IMS to CS, the Access Leg is charged as
follows: Normal MOC CDR is generated by the VMSC of the new Access Leg with
special handling. One example of special handling is to zero rate the CS
resource usage. This can be performed using the \"Service Key\" parameter in
the MOC Record indicating a VCC call. The IMS CDRs generated to perfom domain
transfer are handled as specified in TS 32.260 [55].
In case of domain transfer from CS to IMS, the Access Leg is charged as
follows: The MOC CDRs of the Source-Access Leg (i.e. the Access leg previously
established over CS) are closed when the Source Acces Leg is released
following normal CDR closure associated with CS call release. The IMS CDRs
generated on the new access Leg are handled as specified in TS 32.260 [55].
