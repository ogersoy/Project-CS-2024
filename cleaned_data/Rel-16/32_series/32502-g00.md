# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.501: Self-Configuration of Network Elements; Concepts and Integration
Reference Point (IRP) Requirements
**32.502: Self-Configuration of Network Elements Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Information Service (IS)**
32.503: Self-Configuration of Network Elements Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set (SS)
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the Information Service (IS) part of the Self-
Configuration IRP (SCIRP).\ It describes the semantics of the information and
the interactions visible across Itf-N in a protocol independent way.\ The
information is specified by means of Information Object Classes (IOCs) and the
interactions by means of operations and notifications. The present document
does not specify the syntax (encoding) of the information.
The scope of this version of the TS is restricted to self-configuration of
eNBs.
The present documents also describes how already defined Itf-N functionalities
are used in the context of Self-Configuration.

## 5.3 Information object class definitions
### 5.3.1 ScManagementCapability
#### 5.3.1.1 Definition
This object class is a sub-class of swMCapability and represents the
IRPAgent's capabilities in support of self configuration.
It is created by the IRPAgent and cannot be modified by the IRPManager.\ A
ScManagementCapability object is valid for a certain NE type or a set of NE
types. For an NE there shall be no ambiguity which ScManagementCapability
object is valid for the NE.\ Multiple ScManagementCapability objects may be
instantiated in the IRPAgent.
The object identifies\ a) the sequence of the self-configuration steps\ and
for each step\ a.1) the NE behavior in case the step does not perform
normally\ a.2) the possibility, whether before the step a stop point can be
selected, such that the self-configuration step is suspended and waits for a
request by the IRPManager to resume.

### 5.3.2 ScManagementProfile
#### 5.3.2.1 Definition
This object class is a sub-class of swMProfile. It represents the IRPManager
decision related to self configuration.
A ScManagementProfile object is valid for a certain NE type or a set of NE
types.\ For an NE starting its self-configuration process (see ScProcess)
there shall be no ambiguity which ScManagementProfile is valid for the NE.\
Multiple ScManagementProfile objects may be instantiated in the IRPAgent.
By using this object the IRPManager decides which of the possible stop points
offered in scManagementCapability are used to suspend the self-configuration
process of the specified NE type (or set of NE types).

### 5.3.3 ScProcess
#### 5.3.3.1 Definition
This object class is a sub-class of genManProcess . It describes the Self
Configuration process for an NE. It allows the IRPManager to be informed about
the current progress of the Self Configuration process and where stop points
are set. No intervention of the IRPManager is foreseen except to provide
indication to resume after a stop point was reached or to abort the self-
configuration.
When the automated management process for an NE starts, an instance of the
scProcess is created automatically.
The id of the scProcess shall be identical to the identifier of the NE and
identify the scProcess instance uniquely.
The steps in the stepInfoList shall conform to the content of the relevant
scManagementProfile instance.\ Examples:\ 1\. If the
stepsAndSelectedStopPointList of scManagementProfile indicates
stopPointCanBeSetBeforeThisStep=No for step X, then the entry for step X in
the stepInfoList of scProcess can only have the value stopPointIsNotSet .\ 2\.
All steps within the stepInfoList shall have the same
sequenceNumberInScProcess as in the scStepList of scManagementProfile.
When there is no relevant scManagementProfile at creation time of scProcess,
then the IRPAgent creates the scProcess based on the relevant
scManagementCapability. In this case preferably no stop point shall be set in
the self configuration process.
When the last step of the self configuration process is completed
successfully, the scProcess instance is deleted automatically.
When self configuration process is terminated by the IRPManager, the scProcess
instance is deleted automatically.

## 6.2 Class diagram representing interfaces
The diagram reflects the definitions in the text of the following clauses. In
case of conflict text takes precedence.
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="4.270833333333333in"}
## 6.3 Generic rules
Rule 1: each operation with at least one input parameter supports a pre-
condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
Rule 2: Each operation with at least one optional input parameter supports a
set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_yyy where \"yyy\" is
the name of the optional input parameter and the\ pre-condition indicates that
the operation supports the named optional input parameter. Additionally, each
such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_yyy which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_yyy is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
Rule 3: each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem which is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.

This operation allows the IRPManager to determine on the Itf-N interface in
which sequence the self-configuration steps are performed in NEs of a certain
type, what is done by the NE in case a step does not perform normally and
before which steps a stop point can be set, such that the self-configuration
step halts and waits for a continuation request by the IRPManager.
This operation imports from operation listSwmCapabilities defined in
32.532[7]. It delivers instances of scManagementCapability.
