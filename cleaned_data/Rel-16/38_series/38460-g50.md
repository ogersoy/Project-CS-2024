within an NG-RAN, or for interconnecting a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP of an en-
gNB within an E-UTRAN.

# 4 General aspects
This clause captures the E1 interface principles and characteristics.
## 4.1 E1 interface general principles
The general principles for the specification of the E1 interface are as
follows:
\- the E1 interface is open;
\- the E1 interface supports the exchange of signalling information between
the endpoints;
\- from a logical standpoint, the E1 is a point-to-point interface between a
gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP.
NOTE 1: A point-to-point logical interface should be feasible even in the
absence of a physical direct connection between the endpoints.
\- the E1 interface separates Radio Network Layer and Transport Network Layer;
\- the E1 interface enables exchange of UE associated information and non-UE
associated information;
\- the E1 interface is future proof to fulfil different new requirements,
support of new services and new functions.
NOTE 2: The E1 interface is a control interface and is not used for user data
forwarding.
## 4.2 E1 interface specification objectives
The E1 interface specifications facilitate the following:
\- inter-connection of a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP supplied by different
manufacturers.
# 5 Functions of the E1 interface
## 5.1 General
The following clauses describe the functions supported over E1.
### 5.1.1 E1 interface management function
The error indication function is used by the gNB-CU-UP or gNB-CU-CP to
indicate to the gNB-CU-CP or gNB-CU-UP that an error has occurred.
The reset function is used to initialize the peer entity after node setup and
after a failure event occurred. This procedure can be used by both the gNB-CU-
UP and the gNB-CU-CP.
The E1 setup function allows to exchange application level data needed for the
gNB-CU-UP and gNB-CU-CP to interoperate correctly on the E1 interface. The E1
setup is initiated by both the gNB-CU-UP and gNB-CU-CP.
The gNB-CU-UP Configuration Update and gNB-CU-CP Configuration Update
functions allow to update application level configuration data needed between
the gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP to interoperate correctly over the E1
interface.
The E1 setup and gNB-CU-UP Configuration Update functions allow to inform NR
CGI(s), S-NSSAI(s), PLMN-ID(s), QoS information and NID(s) supported by the
gNB-CU-UP.
The E1 setup and gNB-CU-UP Configuration Update functions allow the gNB-CU-UP
to signal its capacity information to the gNB-CU-CP.
The E1 gNB-CU-UP Status Indication function allows to inform the overloaded or
non-overloaded status over the E1 interface.
### 5.1.2 E1 bearer context management function
The establishment of the E1 bearer context is initiated by the gNB-CU-CP and
accepted or rejected by the gNB-CU-UP based on admission control criteria
(e.g., resource not available).
The modification of the E1 bearer context can be initiated by either gNB-CU-CP
or gNB-CU-UP. The receiving node can accept or reject the modification. The E1
bearer context management function also supports the release of the bearer
context previously established in the gNB-CU-UP. The release of the bearer
context is triggered by the gNB-CU-CP either directly or following a request
received from the gNB-CU-UP.
This function is used to setup and modify the QoS-flow to DRB mapping
configuration. The gNB-CU-CP decides flow-to-DRB mapping and provides the
generated SDAP and PDCP configuration to the gNB-CU-UP. The gNB-CU-CP also
decides the Reflective QoS flow to DRB mapping. The function is also used to
send to the gNB-CU-UP the alternative QoS Parameters Sets when available for a
QoS flow. For each PDU Session Resource to be setup or modified, the S-NSSAI,
shall be provided in the E1 bearer context setup procedure and may be provided
in the E1 bearer context modification procedure by gNB-CU-CP to the gNB-CU-UP.
This function is used for the gNB-CU-CP to send the security information to
the gNB-CU-UP.
This function is used for the gNB-CU-CP to send to the gNB-CU-UP transport
layer information to be used for data forwarding e.g. during handovers.
This function is used for the gNB-CU-CP to send the parameters for header
compression for certain traffic types e.g. IP, Ethernet to the gNB-CU-UP.
This function is used for the gNB-CU-UP to notify the event of DL data arrival
detection to the gNB-CU-CP. With this function, the gNB-CU-UP requests gNB-CU-
CP to trigger paging procedure over F1 or Xn to support RRC Inactive state.
This function is used for the gNB-CU-UP to notify the gNB-CU-CP that a DL
packet including a QFI value not configured by the gNB-CU-CP or an UL packet
including a QFI value in the SDAP header of the default DRB not configured by
the gNB-CU-CP is received for the first time. The gNB-CU-CP can take further
action if needed.
This function is used for the gNB-CU-UP to notify the event of user inactivity
to the gNB-CU-CP. With this function, the gNB-CU-UP indicates that the
inactivity timer associated with a bearer, a PDU session or a UE expires, or
that user data is received for the bearer, the PDU session or the UE whose
inactivity timer has expired. The gNB-CU-CP consolidates all the serving gNB-
CU-UPs for the UE and takes further action.
This function is used for the gNB-CU-UP to report data volume to the gNB-CU-
CP.
This function is used for the gNB-CU-CP to notify the suspension and
resumption of bearer contexts to the gNB-CU-UP.
This function also allows to support CA based packet duplication as described
in TS 38.300 [6], i.e. one data radio bearer should be configured with at
least two GTP-U tunnels between gNB-CU-UP and a gNB-DU.
This function is used to support the enhanced mobility operations as described
in TS 38.300 [6] in the gNB-CU-UP.
### 5.1.3 Trace function
The Trace function provides means to control trace sessions for a UE over E1
interface.
### 5.1.4 Load management function
The load management function allows an gNB-CU-CP to request the reporting of
load measurements to gNB-DU and is used by gNB-CU-UP to report the result of
measurements admitted by gNB-CU-UP.
### 5.1.5 Measurement results transfer function
The measurement results transfer is used by the gNB-CU-CP to transfer UE
associated measurement results to the gNB-CU-UP.
### 5.1.6 Support for IAB
This function is used to update the DL/UL F1-U GTP-U tunnels for an IAB
network, and allow the gNB-CU-CP to send the security key info to the gNB-CU-
UP for the protection of the F1-U interface with IAB-DU.
## 5.2 TEIDs allocation
The gNB-CU-UP is responsible for the allocation of the F1-U UL GTP TEID for
each data radio bearer.
The gNB-CU-UP is responsible for the allocation of the S1-U DL GTP TEID for
each E-RAB and the NG-U DL GTP TEID for each PDU Session.
The gNB-CU-UP is responsible for the allocation of the X2-U DL/UL GTP TEID or
the Xn-U DL/UL GTP TEID for each data radio bearer.
