# 4 General description of NR positioning
**The 3GPP NR radio-technology is uniquely positioned to provide added value
in terms of enhanced location capabilities. The operation in low and high
frequency bands (i.e. below and above 6GHz) and utilization of massive antenna
arrays provides additional degrees of freedom to substantially improve the
positioning accuracy. The possibility to use wide signal bandwidth in low and
especially in high bands brings new performance bounds for user location for
well-known positioning techniques based DL-TDOA and UL-TDOA, Cell-ID or
E-Cell-ID etc., utilizing timing measurements to locate UE. The recent
advances in massive antenna systems (massive MIMO) can provide additional
degrees of freedom to enable more accurate user location by exploiting spatial
and angular domains of propagation channel in combination with time
measurements.**
A general description of location services and service requirements are given
in TS 22.071 [3].
**Rel-15 NR WI specified Cell-ID, inter-RAT and RAT-independent positioning
methods by reusing LPP, but NR standalone based RAT-dependent positioning was
excluded.**
**According to [4], the 5G system shall support the use of 3GPP and non-3GPP
technologies to achieve higher accuracy positioning.** The corresponding
positioning information shall be acquired in a timely fashion, be reliable,
and be available (e.g., it is possible to determine the position). **The 3GPP
system also presents 5G communication for automation in vertical domains
[5].** This is communication that is involved in the production of and working
on work pieces and goods, and/or the delivery of services in the physical
world. Such communication often necessitates low latency, high reliability,
and high communication service availability.
The SA1 HYPOS study [6] focused on positioning use cases in indoor and outdoor
environments. The technical report [7] complements existing work on 5G use
cases involving positioning needs in order to identify potential requirements
for 5G positioning services. The document further develops the identified use
cases by providing some considerations on the suitability of positioning
technologies to these use cases.
**The following requirements were captured in [8]. NR should enable, and
improve if suitable, state-of-art positioning techniques, such as RAN-embedded
(Cell-ID, E-Cell ID, DL-TDOA, UL-TDOA, etc.) and RAN-external (GNSS,
Bluetooth, WLAN, Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), sensors, etc.). NR
positioning shall exploit high bandwidth, massive antenna systems, network
architecture/ functionalities (e.g. heterogeneous networks, broadcast, MBMS)
and deployment of massive number of devices. NR positioning shall support
indoors and outdoors use cases.**
**NR shall support regulatory positioning requirements.**
**NR design targets for commercial positioning use cases include:**
1) Support for range of accuracy levels, latency levels and device categories
2) Support accuracy and latency as defined in TR 22.862 for some use cases
3) Reduced network complexity
4) Reduced device cost
5) Reduced device power consumption
6) Efficient signalling over the air interface and in the network
7) Support for hybrid positioning methods
8) Scalability (support for large number of devices)
9) High security
10) High availability
11) Support UE speed as defined in [9]
# 5 Rel-16 NR positioning requirements
Regulatory requirements are considered as a minimum performance targets for NR
Positioning studies. Additional requirements based on commercial use cases can
be used as input performance targets that are subject to further analysis in
terms of performance/ complexity tradeoffs in different evaluation scenarios.
For regulatory use cases, the following requirements are considered as a
minimum performance targets for NR positioning:

## 6.2 Performance metrics
For evaluating performance of NR positioning technologies, the following
metrics apply.
### 6.2.1 Horizontal accuracy
Horizontal accuracy is the difference between the calculated horizontal
position and the actual horizontal position of a UE. At least CDFs of
horizontal positioning errors are used as a performance metrics in NR
positioning evaluations. At least the following percentiles of positioning
error are analyzed 50%, 67%, 80%, 90%.
### 6.2.2 Vertical accuracy
Vertical accuracy is the difference between the calculated vertical position
and the actual vertical position of a UE. Vertical error is not necessarily
applicable to all solutions and/or scenarios. In terms of applicability, the
CDFs of vertical positioning errors are used as a performance metrics in NR
positioning evaluations. At least the following percentiles of positioning
error are analyzed 50%, 67%, 80%, 90%.
### 6.2.3 Other metrics
Physical layer latency, UE power consumption, scalability/capacity, network
deployment complexity, availability, UE and gNB complexity can be considered
as important design factors for NR positioning solutions and can be evaluated
analytically for the proposed solutions.
# 7 Studied NR positioning technologies
In this TR, RAT-dependent, RAT independent, and combination of RAT-dependent
and RAT-independent techniques are considered for NR positioning.
## 7.1 RAT-dependent NR positioning technologies
The RAT dependent solutions considered for study include:

Whether it is beneficial to support and if so, how to support, NR based
positioning for UEs in RRC-IDLE and/or RRC-INACTIVE states is left to future
specification work.
Broadcast of positioning assistance data has been proposed and is left for
further specification work.
Note: UEs in RRC-IDLE and/or RRC-INACTIVE states and broadcast of positioning
assistance data involve RAN2 aspects. Both methods can be applied to RAT
independent as well as RAT dependent positioning techniques.

FR1 and FR2.
\- NR should support angle (DL-AoD) based DL-only positioning techniques with
at least beam sweeping at least at the gNB in FR1 and FR2.
\- Note: This does not necessarily need different reference signals from the
timing based DL positioning techniques.

\- Received reference signal power based techniques
The following candidate techniques were identified for NR UL-based positioning
support:
\- NR should support timing (UL-TDOA) based UL-only positioning techniques in
FR1 and FR2.
\- UL-TDOA with two or more neighboring gNBs/TRPs for NR UL positioning should
be supported
\- NR should support UL-AoA based positioning techniques in FR1 and FR2
\- UL-AoA with one or more neighboring gNBs/TRPs for NR UL positioning should
be supported
### 7.1.3 Downlink and uplink based solutions
The following candidate techniques are considered for study of DL and UL
positioning:
\- Timing based techniques
\- Round trip time measurement including support for multiple TRPs
\- Combination of DL and UL techniques for NR positioning
\- e.g. E-CID like techniques (including one or multiple cells)
The following candidate techniques were identified for NR DL and UL-based
positioning support:
\- Round-trip time (RTT) with one or more neighbouring gNBs/TRPs for NR DL and
UL positioning should be supported for FR1 and FR2.
\- E-CID based positioning
\- E-CID downlink measurements should be supported based on at least RRM
measurements defined in NR Rel. 15
\- Support of NR Rel-16 signals, measurements and procedures for E-CID are
left to future specification work
\- NR Rel-15 signals may be used to define additional UE/gNB measurements to
facilitate E-CID support
The reference signals agreed for DL-only and UL-only positioning techniques
can be reused for DL+UL RTT positioning with multiple TPs/gNBs.
## 7.2 RAT-independent and hybrid NR positioning technologies
Studied RAT-independent and hybrid NR positioning technologies and aspects
includes:
\- Remaining attributes of GNSS SSR assistance data
\- Hybrid RAT independent and RAT dependent NR positioning
### 7.2.1 Remaining attributes of GNSS SSR assistance data
Support for GNSS OSR and parts of GNSS SSR assistance data was included in
Rel. 15 in TS 36.355, and a set of attributes \"GNSS SSR phase 2\" were
identified [30] for future addition due to lack of an open reference. Since
then, an open reference has been published, which means that the support for
GNSS SSR assistance data can be completed.
The remaining attributes are:
\- Satellite carrier phase bias
\- Ionospheric delay parameters
\- Tropospheric delay parameters
For details, see [37][39], and in particular the QZSS CLAS interface
specification [31].
### 7.2.2 Hybrid RAT dependent and RAT independent
Support for RAT independent positioning in NR was introduced in Rel. 15.
Hybridization between RAT independent and NR RAT dependent positioning methods
should be supported for NR.
### 7.2.3 Summary of RAT independent and hybrid positioning discussions
The source contributions are cited in references [37], [38], [39], [60]-[65].
In [37] and [38], GNSS performance results from field trials are presented.
In [61], several RAT independent methods are analyzed (GNSS, WLAN, Bluetooth,
TBS, IMU positioning). It is observed that RAT-independent positioning methods
have no impact on the NR physical layer design, although measurement impact
may happen in future specification work.
In [37] and [39], the topic of GNSS with PPP-RTK is discussed, and it is noted
that the remaining attributes from GNSS SSR of Rel 15 can now be completed due
to an open reference being available.
In [60][62][63][37][39][65], the topic of hybrid positioning (as in a
combination of RAT dependent and RAT independent methods) is discussed. It is
noted that issues such as network authorization for use of location
information from the network nodes should be studied. In [62] it is proposed
to study the usefulness of the joint utilization of the measurement
information from the UE sensors and RAT-dependent positioning technique(s). In
[39] UE-based positioning is discussed for all positioning methods included in
Rel-16.
In [61], hybrid positioning are categorized into 3 subcategories, standalone,
UE based and network based, depending on which of network terminal or UE
integrates the multiple measurements into a positioning result. In [61] the
procedures, protocols and messages developed for network-based and UE-based
LTE hybrid positioning are discussed. From NR legacy, [63] proposes that all
RAT-independent positioning techniques in NR rel.15 (including motion sensors)
should be considered for the NR hybrid positioning solutions.
In [64], the use of RAT independent assisting RAT dependent angle based
methods (with gyroscope measurements) are discussed together with the use of
UE orientation measurement via RAT-independent positioning.

Figure 8.3.1.5-1: Agreed evaluation setup for IOO scenario.
Figure 6 shows the agreed setup for the IOO scenario, FR1. As can be seen the
base stations are placed in two rows of six columns each. For the sake of ease
of discussions, numbers are assigned to the base stations in the Figure 6.
In this scenario, we investigate the performance of different configurations
of RTT and overhearing nodes. The following measurements and procedure
information cases are considered:
A) Positioning information from RTT procedures with all 12 nodes is considered
for each UE. This corresponds to 12 DL and 12 UL signals being transmitted in
the considered setup, where the DL signals can either be dedicated or common,
addressing additional information i, k or m in the list in section 3.
B) The RTT procedure is only configured for a boundary node (node 1 in Figure
6), but all other nodes are overhearing the signaling exchange. Here, only 1
DL and 1 UL signal is configured, corresponding to additional information f,
h, j, l.
C) The RTT procedure is only configured for a center node (node 5 in Figure
6), but all other nodes are overhearing the signaling exchange. Here, only 1
DL and 1 UL signal is configured, corresponding to additional information f,
h, j, l.
D) The RTT procedure is only configured for two center nodes (nodes 5 and 6 in
Figure 6), but all other nodes are overhearing the signaling exchange. Here,
only 2 DL and 2 UL signal is configured, corresponding to additional
information f, h, j, l.
E) The RTT procedure is configured with all nodes, and all nodes are
overhearing the signaling exchange, This corresponds to 12 DL and 12 UL
signals being transmitted in the considered setup, where the DL signals can
either be dedicated or common, addressing additional information f, h, j, m in
the list in section 3.
F) DL DL-TDOA for reference
The resulting positioning accuracy performance is summarized in Figure 7, and
the 80-percentile performance accuracy together with some signaling costs are
summarized in Table 8.3.1.5-2.

## 8.4 GNSS and Hybrid NR-GNSS Evaluations
### 8.4.1 Hybrid GNSS-DL-TDOA evaluation [37]
One source provided simulation results [37] for hybrid NR and GNSS
positioning. No GNSS models or scenarios have been agreed in 3GPP for
positioning evaluations. No conclusions can be drawn from the results in this
Section. This section captures these results, which are based on the agreed
RAT dependent simulation scenarios together with considered GNSS models and
scenarios.
#### 8.4.1.1 Scenarios and Methodology
For evaluating GNSS and hybrid positioning GNSS and DL-TDOA performance, only
outdoor scenarios are selected, namely UMa and UMi. In [37] the GNSS
conditions (signal attenuation, multipath, etc.) were modelled accordingly
ETSI TS 103 246-3 Operational Environments [27]: Urban Canyon and Asymmetric
Visibility. Furthermore, in order to evaluate GNSS and RAT-dependent under
same environmental conditions, in [37] the Operational Environments were
aligned to 3GPP UMa and UMi based on elevation mask profiles for the GNSS
satellites.
Code-based measurements have been generated for all four GNSS constellations
(GPS, Galileo, BeiDou, and GLONASS) on two frequency carriers, namely 1.575
GHz and 1.176 GHz. The DL-TDOA observables are simulated according to the
scenario parameters agreed by RAN1 and listed section 6.1. DL-TDOA observables
are obtained from 6 gNBs with a PRS system bandwidth of 100 MHz and ideal
muting pattern. The channel model as provided in the TR 38.901 is used as
baseline while results with modifications to the channel model adding a NLOS
bias are also presented.

## 9.2 Procedure and protocol aspects
In Rel-15, as specified in TS 38.305 [56], for UE positioning in NR, the LTE
Positioning Protocol (LPP) TS 36.355[28] is reused and is terminated between a
target device and a positioning server. A new NR Positioning Protocol A
(NRPPa) TS 38.455 [1] was introduced to carry the information between NG-RAN
and LMF.
LPP and NRPPa will be extended to support the NR RAT dependent positioning
methods in future specification work.
Note 1: the details on how to extend LPP and NRPPa are to be discussed when
the normative specifications are developed.
## 9.3 Architecture aspects
### 9.3.1 NG-RAN support for location management functionality
To achieve low latency and high-performance location estimates, different
solutions for the support of location management functionality in NG-RAN have
been discussed in SA2 and captured in TR 23.731[33].
An example [57] on support of location management functionality in NG-RAN is
shown in figure 9.3.1-1 and it involves a location management component (LMC)
in NG-RAN:
{width="7.050694444444445in" height="3.717361111111111in"}
Figure 9.3.1-1: Local LCS architecture
From RAN perspective the support of location management functionality in NG-
RAN impacts:
\- NG-C interface: signalling between NG-RAN and AMF;
\- Protocol/signalling between NG-RAN and UE;
\- Protocol/signalling between NG-RANs;
\- Architecture of location management component within NG-RAN;
During the study some sources raised the concern on whether there is security
risk to allow support for location management functionality in NG-RAN and
whether there are adequate latency gains to cater to new use cases. The
security aspects should be assessed by SA3 as it is out of RAN2 scope.
Further, the following issues need to be addressed when the normative
specifications are developed:
\- Impact of UE mobility in support of location management functionality in
NG-RAN
\- Co-existence of LMC in NG-RAN and LMF.
The impacts on architecture and network interface for location management
component within NG-RAN are out of RAN2 scope and should be checked by RAN3.
### 9.3.2 Architecture procedure and protocol High Layer aspects
The NR positioning architecture and signaling protocols of rel-15 should be
enhanced to support rel-16 regulatory requirements and commercial services.
Regarding NR positioning methods, the location of the transmission measurement
function under disaggregated architecture (CU-DU) should be further
considered.
Regarding location management functionality in the NG-RAN, the location of the
LMC function should be further considered, including possible new
interface(s), impact on existing protocols, and coordination with the LMF in
the 5GC. RAN3 could not reach a common understanding of the network
architecture complexity to introduce this functionality.
The NG-RAN acting as LCS client needs more justification in term of scenarios.
It was also identified the possibility to modify the signalling procedure
compared to the SA2 proposals. Also, the authorisation and privacy aspects
should be considered.
## 9.4 Additional Enhancement Identified for NR Positioning
### 9.4.1 Received Signal Waveform Reporting
The received signal waveform reporting was proposed as one of the mechanisms
for NR positioning. The main principle of this approach is to digitize and
record waveform of the received signals (e.g. at the configured time-
intervals) at UE side / gNB side or any other network entity and report
received signal waveform to the location server or gNB, so that location
server or gNB can utilize received signal waveform report and transmitted
signals (e.g. reference signals) to perform measurements of signal location
parameters required for UE positioning [40]-[41].
### 9.4.2 UE-Based Positioning
Performing the positioning estimation at the UE (UE-based positioning) using
RAT-dependent DL-only, UL-only, or DL+UL measurements and information related
to the gNBs (e.g., location of gNBs) was proposed during this study [42]-[43].
UE-based RAT-dependent positioning and their hybridization with e.g. RAT-
independent methods was also proposed. It was concluded that DL-only UE-based
positioning is feasible from a RAN1 perspective. System level aspects need
further consideration in other working groups.
### 9.4.3 Multipath Measurements
Multipath measurements for positioning were proposed [44]-[45]. The
measurements include delay and angle information from multiple paths. Such
measurements are needed to enable multi-path based positioning (e.g. using
single base station) as described in [45].
### 9.4.4 LOS Detection
LOS detection was proposed for NR positioning. In order to address this
problem the utilization of signal properties and measurements were proposed
(e.g. polarization properties [46]-[47])
### 9.4.5 Positioning for UEs in RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE States
Study was conducted on whether it is beneficial to support and if so, how to
support, NR based positioning for UEs in RRC-IDLE and/or RRC-INACTIVE states.
The solutions based on this approach are described in [48]-[50].
### 9.4.6 UL SRS Enhancements for NR Positioning
Multiple sources proposed a variety of UL SRS enhancements for NR positioning.
The following list of enhancements for UL SRS was proposed:
\- SRS physical structure (e.g. comb configuration, sequence design)
\- SRS resource enhancements (e.g. resource configuration settings, resource
set usage for positioning)
\- SRS beam alignment and beam sweeping procedures
\- SRS transmission power control
\- SRS timing advance procedure
\- SRS BW configuration enhancements w.r.t. to UL BWP
### 9.4.7 Carrier Phase Based Positioning
The NR carrier-phase based positioning technique was proposed in [51]-[52]. It
refers to the positioning method, where the transmitter (either the gNB or the
UE) transmits the positioning reference signals at the pre-configured carrier
frequency, and the receiver (either the UE or the gNB) obtains the carrier
phase measurements by tracking reference signals.
In [53], phase measurements are derived from the complex correlations at the
receiver side. The measurements combined with TDOA are used to estimate user
position.
### 9.4.8 Phase Difference of Arrival Based Positioning
Phase-based RSTD measurement (PDoA) was proposed in [54] to be applied for DL-
TDOA or RTT positioning techniques [55].
# 10\. Conclusions
This study focused on analysis of the 3GPP NR RAT dependent positioning
technologies and RAT-independent positioning technologies.
Regulatory and commercial target performance requirements for RAT dependent
solutions are captured in Section 5.
Three NR positioning evaluation scenarios were identified for system level
analysis of RAT-dependent positioning techniques as described in Section 6.1.
Evaluation results have shown that in considered evaluation scenarios it is
feasible to achieve regulatory and commercial target performance requirements
for horizontal positioning accuracy using RAT-dependent solutions as described
in Section 8.5 that provides summary of evaluations results from different
sources. The summary in Section 8.5 indicates which RAT-dependent solutions
can reach target performance requirements for each evaluation scenario.
Based on conducted analysis it is recommended to define reference signals to
be used for UE and gNB measurements to facilitate support of the following
positioning techniques:
\- DL based positioning
\- DL-TDOA and DL-AoD based positioning techniques
\- UL based positioning
\- UL-TDOA and UL-AoA based positioning techniques
\- DL and UL based positioning
\- RTT based positioning technique
\- E-CID based positioning technique
At least the following set of measurements was identified as necessary for NR
RAT dependent positioning solutions and recommended to be specified:
\- UE measurements based on reference signals from serving and neighbouring
gNBs
\- DL RSTD measurements
\- DL RSRP measurements
\- UE RX-TX time difference measurements
\- gNB measurements at serving and neighbouring gNBs
\- UL RTOA measurements
\- UL Angle of Arrival (AoA) measurements (including Azimuth and Zenith
Angles)
\- UL RSRP (reference signal received power) measurements
\- gNB RX-TX time difference measurements
It was identified that enhancements are necessary (e.g., based on extensions
to current reference signals or with new reference signals) to meet horizontal
accuracy requirements in some scenarios. In order to achieve target
performance characteristics, it is recommended to introduce new downlink
positioning reference signals (DL - PRS). As for UL reference signals, it was
identified that UL SRS can be used as a starting point for UL PRS for NR
positioning. A variety of enhancements for UL SRS were proposed by many
sources and were reported to be beneficial by these sources.
Enhancements identified in Section 9.4 can be considered for future
specification work.
The following is concluded for protocols in NR positioning:
\- LPP is reused and will be extended to support the NR RAT dependent
positioning methods;
\- NRPPa is reused and will be extended to support the NR RAT dependent
positioning methods
Conclusion for positioning architecture:
> \- Regarding NR positioning methods, the location of the transmission
> measurement function under disaggregated architecture (CU-DU) should be
> further considered.
>
> \- Regarding location management functionality in RAN, RAN3 could not reach
> a common understanding on any recommendation.
>
> \- Regarding NG-RAN acting as LCS client, RAN3 needs more justification in
> term of scenarios and foresee also further consideration on the
> authorization and privacy aspects.
The following is concluded for positioning architecture of NR positioning:
\- Regarding location management functionality in RAN, RAN2 conclude that this
option is recommended for normative work, provided the concerns (as described
