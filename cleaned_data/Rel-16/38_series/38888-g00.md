# 4 Background
## 4.1 Justification
In Release 15, 20 MHz is the supported maximum channel bandwidth for NR band
n28, but it significantly restricts the deployment options for operators who
have spectrum larger than 20MHz in NR band n28. In order to allow operators to
make more efficient use of their available spectrum, it is proposed to add
wider channel bandwidth for both BS and UE into NR band n28.
## 4.2 Objective
The objective of this WI is to add to NR band n28 the support of wider channel
bandwidths, with subcarrier spacing of 15kHz and 30kHz. Specifically, it
includes the following aspects:
Introduce 30MHz and 40MHz BS channel bandwidth.
Introduce 30MHz UE channel bandwidth.
Note: Used only to lowermost and uppermost channels in band n28.
Specify UE RF requirements if necessary, including the consideration of
MPR/A-MPR and RENSENS to address the potential impact on RF requirements.
Investigate whether it is possible and, if possible, enable UE support of
30MHz channel bandwidth in Rel-15 in a release independent manner [RAN2].
# 5 Study of UE and BS requirements
## 5.1 UE requirements
### 5.1.1 UE channel bandwidth
Legacy RF Front-End architecture for band 28 UEs is based on dual duplexer
approach, with B28A duplexer covering the range from 703 to 733 MHz, and B28B
duplexer covering the range from 718 to 748 MHz. Since each duplexer bandwidth
is 30MHz, only two carrier frequencies can be supported when cell is
configured for 30MHz CBW operation: 718 MHz for "28A" low duplexer, and 733
MHz for "28B" high duplexer. These restrictions are captured in footnote 7 in
Table 5.1.1-1. The channel bandwidths in Table 5.1.1-1 are specified for both
the TX and RX path.
Table 5.1.1-1 Channel bandwidths for band n28

NOTE 1: 90% spectrum utilization may not be achieved for 30kHz SCS. NOTE 2: 90% spectrum utilization may not be achieved for 60kHz SCS. NOTE 3: This UE channel bandwidth is applicable only to downlink. NOTE 4: This UE channel bandwidth is optional in this release of the specification. NOTE 5: For this bandwidth, the minimum requirements are restricted to operation when carrier is configured as an SCell part of DC or CA configuration. NOTE 6: For this bandwidth, the minimum requirements are restricted to operation when carrier is configured as an downlink SCell part of CA configuration. NOTE 7: For the 20 MHz bandwidth, the minimum requirements are specified for NR UL carrier frequencies confined to either 713-723 MHz or 728-738 MHz.For the 30MHz bandwidth, the minimum requirements are specified for NR UL transmission bandwidth configuration confined to either 703-733 or 718-748 MHz. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
### 5.1.2 Tx requirements
#### 5.1.2.1 MPR requirements
The relative channel bandwidth of n28 30MHz is around 4.1%. It's larger than
the 3% criteria of FDD bands. So it's necessary to specify the MPR
requirements for n28 30MHz. Referring to MPR simulation results [7], we can
find that the MPR requirements in the current spec can be met for UL 30MHz
channel bandwidth in band n28. But considering different implementations, the
delta MPR need to be considered as margin. The proposed delta MPR (dB) are
listed in Table 5.1.2.1-1.

For band n28 30MHz, the allowed maximum power reduction (MPR) is defined in
Table 5.1.2.1-2.

#### 5.1.2.2 AMPR requirements
There are two network signalling labels for n28 in current spec. For 30MHz
channel bandwidth, as announced by Japanese operators, it is concluded that
NS_17 extension is not needed at this stage because allocation of such wider
CBWs won\'t be foreseen in the near future in Japan.
In China, the TV system has own standard based on 8MHz bandwidth instead of
NS_18/NS_17's 6MHz MBW. Furthermore, additional spectrum emission requirements
for 700MHz haven't been specified in China. So NS_17 and NS_18 aren't
applicable to China.
It's possible for n28 30MHz deployment in EU.
Referring to the paper [8], Frequency range of UL transmission bandwidth
configuration placed at 703\~733MHz will require AMPR. The updated AMPR
simulation results are captured in the paper [9]. Based on the updated AMPR
simulation results, we propose the NS_18 AMPR requirements as below.

## 5.2 BS requirements
### 5.2.1 Channel bandwidth
30MHz and 40MHz BS channel bandwidth for band n28 will be introduced into TS
38.104[6] as specified in table 5.2.1-1.

### 5.2.2 BS-BS co-existence
Figure 5.2.2-1 shows the 3GPP spectrum around band n28. Band 5/V, Band 18,
Band 19/XIX, Band 26/XXVI and band 27 are legacy bands, and Band n5 is NR
band. thus impact in current performance needs to be specifically addressed.

Figure 5.2.2-1. 3GPP spectrum around band n28
Since the LTE band 28 is the refarming band of NR band n28, so the BS-BS co-
existence analysis and the consensus in section 7.2 in TR36.820 [4] can be
applied to the BS-BS co-existence studies for band n28 co-existence with band
5/X UL, band 26/XXVI UL, band 18 UL and band 19/XIX UL.
In TR36.820, for the co-existence between APT700MHz FDD (i.e. LTE band 28)
with some nearby 3GPP bands, the consensus are cited as follow:
BS-BS co-existence between Band 5/V and APT700 is not an issue
BS-BS co-existence between Band 26/XXVI and APT700 is not an issue
BS-BS co-existence between Band 18 and 19/XIX and APT700 is achievable.
It shall be noted the above consensus are applied for the while band,
regardless the supported channel bandwidth. The above consensus can be applied
for band n28 co-existence with band 5/X/n5 UL, band 26/XXVI UL, band 18 UL and
band 19/XIX UL. Hence there are no BS-BS co-existence issues to introduce
30MHz and 40MHz for band n28 co-existence with the above nearby 3GPP
bands.Regarding the BS co-existence issues between band n28 and band 27,
filter capability is an important factor. The band 27 Rx filter can provide
enough attenuation to fulfill ACS and in band-blocking regardless the
supported channel bandwidth of band n28. Although the duplexer gap between UL
and DL for band n28 is only 10MHz and the frequency gap between the band n28
with band 27 UL is only 4MHz, it is still possible to implement the RF filter
design with full band bandwidth to fulfill the co-existence requirements
between band 27 and band n28 but the filter volume could be larger.
In addition, from the analysis in [5], it can be concluded that there exists
some other possible solutions to solve the co-existence issues between band 27
and band n28. By using certain specific solutions, sub-band filters (40MHz Tx
bandwidth) as an example, band n28 can protect band 27 UL with the standard
level of -49dBm/MHz.
