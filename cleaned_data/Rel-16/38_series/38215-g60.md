# 4 Control of UE/NG-RAN measurements
In this clause the general measurement control concept of the higher layers is
briefly described to provide an understanding on how L1 measurements are
initiated and controlled by higher layers.
With the measurement specifications L1 provides measurement capabilities for
the UE and NG-RAN. These measurements can be classified in different reported
measurement types: intra-frequency, inter-frequency, inter-system, traffic
volume, quality and UE internal measurements.
In the L1 measurement definitions, see clause 5, the measurements are
categorised as measurements in the UE or measurements in the NG-RAN.

The following | | | terms are used in the tables: | | | | | | > RRC_IDLE; | | | > | | | > RRC_INACTIVE; | | | > | | | > RRC_CONNECTED; | | | | | | Intra-frequency appended to the RRC state: | | | | | | > Shall be possible to perform in the | | | > corresponding RRC state on an | | | > intra-frequency cell; | | | | | | Inter-frequency appended to the RRC state: | | | | | | > Shall be possible to perform in the | | | > corresponding RRC state on an | | | > inter-frequency cell | | | | | | Inter-RAT appended to the RRC state: | | | | | | > Shall be possible to perform in the | | | > corresponding RRC state on an inter-RAT | | | > cell. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
### 5.1.1 SS reference signal received power (SS-RSRP)
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | SS reference signal received power (SS-RSRP) | | | is defined as the linear average over the | | | power contributions (in [W]) of the resource | | | elements that carry secondary synchronization | | | signals. The measurement time resource(s) for | | | SS-RSRP are confined within SS/PBCH Block | | | Measurement Time Configuration (SMTC) window | | | duration. If SS-RSRP is used for L1-RSRP as | | | configured by reporting configurations as | | | defined in TS 38.214 [6], the measurement | | | time resources(s) restriction by SMTC window | | | duration is not applicable. | | | | | | For SS-RSRP determination demodulation | | | reference signals for physical broadcast | | | channel (PBCH) and, if indicated by higher | | | layers, CSI reference signals in addition to | | | secondary synchronization signals may be used. | | | SS-RSRP using demodulation reference signal | | | for PBCH or CSI reference signal shall be | | | measured by linear averaging over the power | | | contributions of the resource elements that | | | carry corresponding reference signals taking | | | into account power scaling for the reference | | | signals as defined in TS 38.213 [5]. If | | | SS-RSRP is not used for L1-RSRP, the | | | additional use of CSI reference signals for | | | SS-RSRP determination is not applicable. | | | | | | SS-RSRP shall be measured only among the | | | reference signals corresponding to SS/PBCH | | | blocks with the same SS/PBCH block index and | | | the same physical-layer cell identity. | | | | | | If SS-RSRP is not used for L1-RSRP and | | | higher-layers indicate certain SS/PBCH blocks | | | for performing SS-RSRP measurements, then | | | SS-RSRP is measured only from the indicated | | | set of SS/PBCH block(s). | | | | | | For frequency range 1, the reference point for | | | the SS-RSRP shall be the antenna connector of | | | the UE. For frequency range 2, SS-RSRP shall | | | be measured based on the combined signal from | | | antenna elements corresponding to a given | | | receiver branch. For frequency range 1 and 2, | | | if receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the | | | reported SS-RSRP value shall not be lower than | | | the corresponding SS-RSRP of any of the | | | individual receiver branches. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | If SS-RSRP is used for L1-RSRP, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency. | | | | | | Otherwise, | | | | | | RRC_IDLE intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_IDLE inter-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_INACTIVE intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_INACTIVE inter-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED inter-frequency | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
NOTE 1: The number of resource elements within the measurement period that are
used by the UE to determine SS-RSRP is left up to the UE implementation with
the limitation that corresponding measurement accuracy requirements have to be
fulfilled.
NOTE 2: The power per resource element is determined from the energy received
during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the CP.
### 5.1.2 CSI reference signal received power (CSI-RSRP)
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | CSI reference signal received power | | | (CSI-RSRP), is defined as the linear average | | | over the power contributions (in [W]) of the | | | resource elements of the antenna port(s) that | | | carry CSI reference signals configured for | | | RSRP measurements within the considered | | | measurement frequency bandwidth in the | | | configured CSI-RS occasions. | | | | | | For CSI-RSRP determination CSI reference | | | signals transmitted on antenna port 3000 | | | according to TS 38.211 [4] shall be used. If | | | CSI-RSRP is used for L1-RSRP, CSI reference | | | signals transmitted on antenna ports 3000, | | | 3001 can be used for CSI-RSRP determination. | | | | | | For intra-frequency CSI-RSRP measurements, if | | | the measurement gap is not configured, UE is | | | not expected to measure the CSI-RS resource(s) | | | outside of the active downlink bandwidth part. | | | | | | For frequency range 1, the reference point for | | | the CSI-RSRP shall be the antenna connector of | | | the UE. For frequency range 2, CSI-RSRP shall | | | be measured based on the combined signal from | | | antenna elements corresponding to a given | | | receiver branch. For frequency range 1 and 2, | | | if receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the | | | reported CSI-RSRP value shall not be lower | | | than the corresponding CSI-RSRP of any of the | | | individual receiver branches. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | If CSI-RSRP is used for L1-RSRP, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency. | | | | | | Otherwise, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED inter-frequency | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
NOTE 1: The number of resource elements within the considered measurement
frequency bandwidth and within the measurement period that are used by the UE
to determine CSI-RSRP is left up to the UE implementation with the limitation
that corresponding measurement accuracy requirements have to be fulfilled.
NOTE 2: The power per resource element is determined from the energy received
during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the CP.
### 5.1.3 SS reference signal received quality (SS-RSRQ)
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | Secondary synchronization signal reference | | | signal received quality (SS-RSRQ) is defined | | | as the ratio of N×SS-RSRP / NR carrier RSSI, | | | where N is the number of resource blocks in | | | the NR carrier RSSI measurement bandwidth. The | | | measurements in the numerator and denominator | | | shall be made over the same set of resource | | | blocks. | | | | | | NR carrier Received Signal Strength Indicator | | | (NR carrier RSSI), comprises the linear | | | average of the total received power (in [W]) | | | observed only in certain OFDM symbols of | | | measurement time resource(s), in the | | | measurement bandwidth, over N number of | | | resource blocks from all sources, including | | | co-channel serving and non-serving cells, | | | adjacent channel interference, thermal noise | | | etc. For cell selection, according to Clause | | | 4.1 of TS 38.211 [12], the measurement time | | | resources(s) for NR Carrier RSSI are not | | | constrained. Otherwise, the measurement time | | | resource(s) for NR Carrier RSSI are confined | | | within SS/PBCH Block Measurement Time | | | Configuration (SMTC) window duration. | | | | | | If indicated by higher-layers, if measurement | | | gap is not used, the NR Carrier RSSI is | | | measured in slots within the SMTC window | | | duration that are indicated by the higher | | | layer parameter _measurementSlots_ and in OFDM | | | symbols given by Table 5.1.3-1 and, if | | | measurement gap is used, the NR Carrier RSSI | | | is measured in slots within the SMTC window | | | duration that are indicated by the higher | | | layer parameter _measurementSlots_ and in OFDM | | | symbols given by Table 5.1.3-1 that are | | | overlapped with the measurement gap, which is | | | defined in TS38.133 [12]. | | | | | | > \- For intra-frequency measurements, NR | | | > Carrier RSSI is measured with timing | | | > reference corresponding to the serving cell | | | > in the frequency layer | | | > | | | > \- For inter-frequency measurements, NR | | | > Carrier RSSI is measured with timing | | | > reference corresponding to any cell in the | | | > target frequency layer | | | | | | Otherwise not indicated by higher-layers, if | | | measurement gap is not used, NR Carrier RSSI | | | is measured from OFDM symbols within SMTC | | | window duration and, if measurement gap is | | | used, NR Carrier RSSI is measured from OFDM | | | symbols corresponding to overlapped time span | | | between SMTC window duration and the | | | measurement gap. | | | | | | If higher-layers indicate certain SS/PBCH | | | blocks for performing SS-RSRQ measurements, | | | then SS-RSRP is measured only from the | | | indicated set of SS/PBCH block(s). | | | | | | For frequency range 1, the reference point for | | | the SS-RSRQ shall be the antenna connector of | | | the UE. For frequency range 2, NR Carrier RSSI | | | shall be measured based on the combined signal | | | from antenna elements corresponding to a given | | | receiver branch, where the combining for NR | | | Carrier RSSI shall be the same as the one used | | | for SS-RSRP measurements. For frequency range | | | 1 and 2, if receiver diversity is in use by | | | the UE, the reported SS-RSRQ value shall not | | | be lower than the corresponding SS-RSRQ of any | | | of the individual receiver branches. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | RRC_IDLE intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_IDLE inter-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_INACTIVE intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_INACTIVE inter-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED inter-frequency | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+

### 5.1.4 CSI reference signal received quality (CSI-RSRQ)
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | CSI reference signal received quality | | | (CSI-RSRQ) is defined as the ratio of | | | N×CSI-RSRP to CSI-RSSI, where N is the number | | | of resource blocks in the CSI-RSSI measurement | | | bandwidth. The measurements in the numerator | | | and denominator shall be made over the same | | | set of resource blocks. | | | | | | CSI Received Signal Strength Indicator | | | (CSI-RSSI), comprises the linear average of | | | the total received power (in [W]) observed | | | only in OFDM symbols of measurement time | | | resource(s), in the measurement bandwidth, | | | over N number of resource blocks from all | | | sources, including co-channel serving and | | | non-serving cells, adjacent channel | | | interference, thermal noise etc. The | | | measurement time resource(s) for CSI-RSSI | | | corresponds to OFDM symbols containing | | | configured CSI-RS occasions. | | | | | | For CSI-RSRQ determination CSI reference | | | signals transmitted on antenna port 3000 | | | according to TS 38.211 [4] shall be used. | | | | | | For intra-frequency CSI-RSRQ measurements, if | | | the measurement gap is not configured, UE is | | | not expected to measure the CSI-RS resource(s) | | | outside of the active downlink bandwidth part. | | | | | | For frequency range 1, the reference point for | | | the CSI-RSRQ shall be the antenna connector of | | | the UE. For frequency range 2, CSI-RSSI shall | | | be measured based on the combined signal from | | | antenna elements corresponding to a given | | | receiver branch, where the combining for | | | CSI-RSSI shall be the same as the one used for | | | CSI-RSRP measurements. For frequency range 1 | | | and 2, if receiver diversity is in use by the | | | UE, the reported CSI-RSRQ value shall not be | | | lower than the corresponding CSI-RSRQ of any | | | of the individual receiver branches. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED inter-frequency | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
### 5.1.5 SS signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SS-SINR)
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | SS signal-to-noise and interference ratio | | | (SS-SINR), is defined as the linear average | | | over the power contribution (in [W]) of the | | | resource elements carrying secondary | | | synchronisation signals divided by the linear | | | average of the noise and interference power | | | contribution (in [W]). If SS-SINR is used | | | for L1-SINR reporting with dedicated | | | interference measurement resources, the | | | interference and noise is measured over | | | resource(s) indicated by higher layers as | | | described in TS 38.214 [6]. Otherwise, the | | | interference and noise are measured over the | | | resource elements carrying secondary | | | synchronisation signals within the same | | | frequency bandwidth. The measurement time | | | resource(s) for SS-SINR are confined within | | | SS/PBCH Block Measurement Time Configuration | | | (SMTC) window duration. If SS-SINR is used for | | | L1-SINR as configured by reporting | | | configurations defined in TS 38.214 [6], the | | | measurement time resources(s) restriction by | | | SMTC window duration is not applicable. | | | | | | For SS-SINR determination demodulation | | | reference signals for physical broadcast | | | channel (PBCH) in addition to secondary | | | synchronization signals may be used. | | | | | | If SS-SINR is not used for L1-SINR and | | | higher-layers indicate certain SS/PBCH blocks | | | for performing SS-SINR measurements, then | | | SS-SINR is measured only from the indicated | | | set of SS/PBCH block(s). | | | | | | For frequency range 1, the reference point for | | | the SS-SINR shall be the antenna connector of | | | the UE. For frequency range 2, SS-SINR shall | | | be measured based on the combined signal from | | | antenna elements corresponding to a given | | | receiver branch. For frequency range 1 and 2, | | | if receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the | | | reported SS-SINR value shall not be lower than | | | the corresponding SS-SINR of any of the | | | individual receiver branches. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | If SS-SINR is used for L1-SINR, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency. | | | | | | Otherwise, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED inter-frequency | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
### 5.1.6 CSI signal-to-noise and interference ratio (CSI-SINR)
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | CSI signal-to-noise and interference ratio | | | (CSI-SINR), is defined as the linear average | | | over the power contribution (in [W]) of the | | | resource elements carrying CSI reference | | | signals divided by the linear average of the | | | noise and interference power contribution (in | | | [W]). If CSI-SINR is used for L1-SINR | | | reporting with dedicated interference | | | measurement resources, the interference and | | | noise is measured over resource(s) indicated | | | by higher layers as described in TS 38.214 | | | [6]. Otherwise, the interference and noise | | | are measured over the resource elements | | | carrying CSI reference signals within the same | | | frequency bandwidth. | | | | | | For CSI-SINR determination CSI reference | | | signals transmitted on antenna port 3000 | | | according to TS 38.211 [4] shall be used. If | | | CSI-SINR is used for L1-SINR, CSI reference | | | signals transmitted on antenna ports 3000, | | | 3001 can be used for CSI-SINR determination. | | | | | | For intra-frequency CSI-SINR measurements not | | | used for L1-SINR reporting, if the measurement | | | gap is not configured, UE is not expected to | | | measure the CSI-RS resource(s) outside of the | | | active downlink bandwidth part. | | | | | | For frequency range 1, the reference point for | | | the CSI-SINR shall be the antenna connector of | | | the UE. For frequency range 2, CSI-SINR shall | | | be measured based on the combined signal from | | | antenna elements corresponding to a given | | | receiver branch. For frequency range 1 and 2, | | | if receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the | | | reported CSI-SINR value shall not be lower | | | than the corresponding CSI-SINR of any of the | | | individual receiver branches. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | If CSI-SINR is used for L1-SINR, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency. | | | | | | Otherwise, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED inter-frequency | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+

For frame | | | structure 1 and 2, if the UE can reliably | | | detect that cell-specific reference signals | | | are present in other subframes, the UE may use | | | those subframes in addition to determine | | | E-UTRA RSRP. | | | | | | The reference point for the E-UTRA RSRP shall | | | be the antenna connector of the UE. | | | | | | If receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the | | | reported value shall not be lower than the | | | corresponding E-UTRA RSRP of any of the | | | individual diversity branches. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | RRC_IDLE inter-RAT, | | | | | | RRC_INACTIVE inter-RAT, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED inter-RAT | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+

### 5.1.16 E-UTRA RSRQ
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | E-UTRA Reference Signal Received Quality | | | (E-UTRA RSRQ) is defined as the ratio | | | _N_ ×E-UTRA RSRP/(E-UTRA carrier RSSI), where N | | | is the number of RBs of the E-UTRA carrier | | | RSSI measurement bandwidth.
