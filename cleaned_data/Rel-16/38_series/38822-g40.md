# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, certain modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
NOTE 1: The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
NOTE 2: The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as
substitutes for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a direct
citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain
continuity of style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a
referenced document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
NOTE 3: The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
NOTE 4: The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" shall not to be used as
substitutes for \"may\" and \"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
NOTE 5: The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

not been maintained after this date. The Release 16 UE feature list described
in clause 5 reflects the status of Release 16 in June 2021 and has not been
maintained after this date.

The leading/leftmost value corresponds to the band combination of the particular Uu band combination and the first intra-band PC5 band combination included in _BandCombinationListSidelinkEUTRA-NR_ which is indicated with value 1 by _supportedTxBandCombListPerBC-Sidelink-r16_ , the next value corresponds to the band combination of the particular Uu band combination and the second intra-band PC5 band combination included in _BandCombinationListSidelinkEUTRA-NR_ which is indicated with value 1 by _supportedTxBandCombListPerBC-Sidelink-r16_ and so on. If this power class is higher than the power class that the UE supports on the individual Uu or PC5 interface of this band combination, the latter determines maximum TX power available in each interface. |  | _IntrabandConcurrentOperationPowerClass-r16 SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxBandComb)) OF IntraBandPowerClass-r16_ _IntraBandPowerClass-r16 ENUMERATED {PC2, PC3}_ | _BandCombination-v1680_ | n/a | n/a |  | Optional with capability signalling  
###### ## Annex A (informative): URLLC capabilities
The Release 15 features listed in Table A-1 are some of the features for UEs
supporting services requiring ultra reliability and/or low latency, as defined
in TS 38.300 [16]. It should be noted that the list is not exhaustive and not
all features need to be supported at the same time for UEs supporting services
requiring ultra reliability and/or low latency.
