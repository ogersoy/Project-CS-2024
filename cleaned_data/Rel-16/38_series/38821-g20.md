z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The objectives for this document are, based on the outcomes of the TR 38.811
[2], to study a set of necessary features/adaptations enabling the operation
of the New Radio (NR) protocol in non-terrestrial networks for 3GPP Release 16
with a priority on satellite access. Access network based on Unmanned Aerial
System (UAS) including High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) could be
considered as a special case of non-terrestrial access with lower
delay/Doppler value and variation rate.
The objectives for the study are the following
● Consolidation of potential impacts on the physical layer and definition of
related solutions if needed
● Performance assessment of NR in selected deployment scenarios (LEO based
satellite access, GEO based satellite access) through link level (Radio link)
and system level (cell) simulations
● Study and define related solutions if needed on NR related Layer 2 and 3
● Study and define related solutions if needed on RAN architecture and related
interface protocols
NOTE: As far as architecture issues are concerned, this TR supersedes TR
38.811 [2]

# 3 Definitions of terms, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Terms
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Availability:** % of time during which the RAN is available for the targeted
communication. Unavailable communication for shorter period than [Y] ms shall
not be counted. The RAN may contain several access network components among
which an NTN to achieve multi-connectivity or link aggregation.

**Geostationary Earth orbit:** Circular orbit at 35,786 km above the Earth\'s
equator and following the direction of the Earth\'s rotation. An object in
such an orbit has an orbital period equal to the Earth\'s rotational period
and thus appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground
observers.
**Low Earth Orbit:** Orbit around the Earth with an altitude between 300 km,
and 1500 km.
**Medium Earth Orbit:** region of space around the Earth above low Earth orbit
and below geostationary Earth Orbit.
**Minimum Elevation angle** : minimum angle under which the satellite or UAS
platform can be seen by a terminal.
**Mobile Services:** a radio-communication service between mobile and land
stations, or between mobile stations
**Mobile Satellite Services:** A radio-communication service between mobile
earth stations and one or more space stations, or between space stations used
by this service; or between mobile earth stations by means of one or more
space stations
**Non-Geostationary Satellites:** Satellites (LEO and MEO) orbiting around the
Earth with a period that varies approximately between 1.5 hour and 10 hours.
It is necessary to have a constellation of several Non-Geostationary
satellites associated with handover mechanisms to ensure a service continuity.
**Non-terrestrial networks:** Networks, or segments of networks, using an
airborne or space-borne vehicle to embark a transmission equipment relay node
or base station.
**NTN-gateway:** an earth station or gateway is located at the surface of
Earth, and providing sufficient RF power and RF sensitivity for accessing to
the satellite (resp. HAPS). NTN Gateway is a transport network layer (TNL)
node.
**On Board processing:** digital processing carried out on uplink RF signals
aboard a satellite or an aerial.
**On board NTN gNB** : gNB implemented in the regenerative payload on board a
satellite (respectively HAPS).
**On ground NTN gNB** : gNB of a transparent satellite (respectively HAPS)
payload implemented on ground.
**One-way latency:** time required to propagate through a telecommunication
system from a terminal to the public data network or from the public data
network to the terminal. This is especially used for voice and video
conference applications.
**Regenerative payload:** payload that transforms and amplifies an uplink RF
signal before transmitting it on the downlink. The transformation of the
signal refers to digital processing that may include demodulation, decoding,
re-encoding, re-modulation and/or filtering.
**Round Trip Delay:** time required for a signal to travel from a terminal to
the sat-gateway or from the sat-gateway to the terminal and back. This is
especially used for web-based applications.
**Satellite:** a space-borne vehicle embarking a bent pipe payload or a
regenerative payload telecommunication transmitter, placed into Low-Earth
Orbit (LEO), Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO), or Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO).

# 4 Non-Terrestrial Networks overview and scenarios
## 4.1 Non-Terrestrial Networks overview
A non-terrestrial network refers to a network, or segment of networks using RF
resources on board a satellite (or UAS platform).
The typical scenario of a non-terrestrial network providing access to user
equipment is depicted below:
{width="6.216666666666667in" height="2.595833333333333in"}
Figure 4.1-1: Non-terrestrial network typical scenario based on transparent
payload
{width="7.470138888888889in" height="3.1243055555555554in"}
Figure 4.1-2: Non-terrestrial network typical scenario based on regenerative
payload
Non-Terrestrial Network typically features the following elements:
\- One or several sat-gateways that connect the Non-Terrestrial Network to a
public data network
\- a GEO satellite is fed by one or several sat-gateways which are deployed
across the satellite targeted coverage (e.g. regional or even continental
coverage). We assume that UE in a cell are served by only one sat-gateway
\- A Non-GEO satellite served successively by one or several sat-gateways at a
time. The system ensures service and feeder link continuity between the
successive serving sat-gateways with sufficient time duration to proceed with
mobility anchoring and hand-over
\- A Feeder link or radio link between a sat-gateway and the satellite (or UAS
platform)
\- A service link or radio link between the user equipment and the satellite
(or UAS platform).
\- A satellite (or UAS platform) which may implement either a transparent or a
regenerative (with on board processing) payload. The satellite (or UAS
platform) generate beams typically generate several beams over a given service
area bounded by its field of view. The footprints of the beams are typically
of elliptic shape. The field of view of a satellites (or UAS platforms)
depends on the on board antenna diagram and min elevation angle.
\- A transparent payload: Radio Frequency filtering, Frequency conversion and
amplification. Hence, the waveform signal repeated by the payload is un-
changed;
\- A regenerative payload: Radio Frequency filtering, Frequency conversion and
amplification as well as demodulation/decoding, switch and/or routing,
coding/modulation. This is effectively equivalent to having all or part of
base station functions (e.g. gNB) on board the satellite (or UAS platform).
\- Inter-satellite links (ISL) optionally in case of a constellation of
satellites. This will require regenerative payloads on board the satellites.
ISL may operate in RF frequency or optical bands.
\- User Equipment are served by the satellite (or UAS platform) within the
targeted service area.
There may be different types of satellites (or UAS platforms) listed here
under:
Table 4.1-1: Types of NTN platforms
* * *
Platforms Altitude range Orbit Typical beam footprint size Low-Earth Orbit
(LEO) satellite 300 -- 1500 km Circular around the earth 100 -- 1000 km
Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite 7000 -- 25000 km 100 -- 1000 km
Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite 35 786 km notional station keeping
position fixed in terms of elevation/azimuth with respect to a given earth
point 200 -- 3500 km UAS platform (including HAPS) 8 -- 50 km (20 km for HAPS)
5 - 200 km High Elliptical Orbit (HEO) satellite 400 -- 50000 km Elliptical
around the earth 200 -- 3500 km
* * *
Typically
● GEO satellite and UAS are used to provide continental, regional or local
service.
● a constellation of LEO and MEO is used to provide services in both Northern
and Southern hemispheres. In some case, the constellation can even provide
global coverage including polar regions. For the later, this requires
appropriate orbit inclination, sufficient beams generated and inter-satellite
links.
HEO satellite systems are not considered in this document.
## 4.2 Non-Terrestrial Networks reference scenarios
We shall consider in this document non-terrestrial networks providing access
to user equipment in six reference scenarios including
● Circular orbiting and notional station keeping platforms.
● Highest RTD constraint
● Highest Doppler constraint
● A transparent and a regenerative payload
● One ISL case and one without ISL. Regenerative payload is mandatory in the
case of inter-satellite links.
● Fixed or steerable beams resulting respectively in moving or fixed beam foot
print on the ground
Six scenarios are considered as depicted in Table 4.2-1 and are detailed in
Table 4.2-2.

# 5 NTN-based NG-RAN Architectures
The study has been carried out minimizing the need for new interfaces and
protocols in the NG-RAN to support non-terrestrial networks.
## 5.1 Transparent satellite based NG-RAN architecture
### 5.1.1 Overview
The satellite payload implements frequency conversion and a Radio Frequency
amplifier in both up link and down link direction. It corresponds to an
analogue RF repeater.
Hence the satellite repeats the NR-Uu radio interface from the feeder link
(between the NTN gateway and the satellite) to the service link (between the
satellite and the UE) and vice versa.
The Satellite Radio Interface (SRI) on the feeder link is the NR-Uu. In other
words, the satellite does not terminate NR-Uu.
The NTN GW supports all necessary functions to forward the signal of NR-Uu
interface.
Different transparent satellites may be connected to the same gNB on the
ground.
Figure 5.1-1: Networking-RAN architecture with transparent satellite
Note: Whilst several gNBs may access a single satellite payload, the
description has been simplified to a unique gNB accessing the satellite
payload, without loss of generality.
### 5.1.2 Detailed description of the architecture
The architecture of a transparent-satellite based NG-RAN is depicted in the
following figure. The mapping to QoS flows is also highlighted.
Figure 5.1-2: Transparent-satellite based NG-RAN with mapping to QoS flows
UE has access to the 5G system via a 3GPP NR based radio interface.
The user plane protocol stack is described hereafter.

Figure 5.1-3: User plane Protocol stack (Transparent satellite)
RF processing & Frequency Switching
The user data is transported between the UE and the 5GC, as usual, but via the
NTN Gateway.
The control plane protocol stack is described hereafter.
Figure 5.1-4: Control plane Protocol stack (Transparent satellite)
_RF processing & Frequency Switching_
The NAS (NAS-SM and NAS-MM) signalling from the UE and the NG-AP signalling
from the gNB are transported toward the 5GC and vice versa.
### 5.1.3 NG-RAN impacts
There is no need to modify the NG-RAN architecture to support transparent
satellite access.
NR-Uu timers may have to be extended to cope with the long delay of the feeder
link and service link.
In the context of a LEO scenario with ISL, the delay to be considered shall
encompass at least the feeder link (SRI) and one or several ISLs.
Both CP and UP protocol are terminated on the ground.
● With respect to CP, this scenario does not pose any particular issues but
the need to adapt to the much longer roundtrip times of the Uu. This can be
addressed by implementation
● Concerning UP, apart from issues arising from the longer roundtrip time for
UP packets, the UP protocol itself is unaffected. The longer delay on the Uu
interface will however require more buffering for the UP packets into the gNB.
## 5.2 Regenerative satellite based NG-RAN architectures
### 5.2.1 gNB processed payload
#### 5.2.1.1 Overview
The NG-RAN logical architecture as described in TS 38.401 is used as baseline
for NTN scenarios.
The satellite payload implements regeneration of the signals received from
Earth.
● NR-Uu radio interface on the service link between the UE and the satellite
● Satellite Radio Interface (SRI) on the feeder link between the NTN gateway
and the satellite.
SRI (Satellite Radio Interface) is a transport link between NTN GW and
satellite.
Figure 5.2.1-1: Regenerative satellite without ISL, gNB processed payload
NOTE: The satellite may embark additional traffic routing functions that are
out of RAN scope.
The satellite payload also provides Inter-Satellite Links (ISL) between
satellites
ISL (Inter-Satellite Links) is a transport link between satellites. ISL may be
a radio interface or an optical interface that may be 3GPP or non 3GPP defined
but this is out of the study item scope.
The NTN GW is a Transport Network Layer node, and supports all necessary
transport protocols.
Figure 5.2.1-2: Regenerative satellite with ISL, gNB processed payload
The figure above illustrates that UE served by a gNB on board a satellite
could access the 5GCN via ISL.
The gNB on board different satellites may be connected to the same 5GCN on the
ground.
If the satellite hosts more than one gNB, the same SRI will transport all the
corresponding NG interface instances.
#### 5.2.1.2 Detailed description of the architecture
The architecture of a regenerative-satellite based NG-RAN is depicted on the
following figure. The mapping to QoS flows is also highlighted.
Figure 5.2.1-3: Regenerative satellite based NG-RAN architecture (gNB on
board) with QoS flows
The UE user plane protocol stack for a PDU session is described hereafter.
Figure 5.2.1-4: NG-RAN protocol architecture for regenerative satellite (gNB
on board): User Plane
The Protocol stack of the Satellite Radio Interface (SRI) is used to transport
the UE user plane between satellite and NTN-Gateway.
The User PDUs are transported over GTP-U tunnels, as usual, between the 5GC
and the on-board gNB, but via the NTN Gateway.
The UE control plane protocol stack for a PDU session is described hereafter.
Figure 5.2.1-5: NG-RAN protocol architecture for regenerative satellite (gNB
on board): Control Plane
The NG-AP is transported over SCTP, between the 5GC and the on board gNB, as
usual, but via the NTN Gateway.
The NAS protocol is also transported by the NG-AP protocol, between the 5GC
and the on board gNB, via the NTN Gateway.
#### 5.2.1.3 NG-RAN impacts
NG Application Protocol timers may have to be extended to cope with the long
delay of the feeder link.
NG can experience longer latency (up to several hundreds of ms in case of a
GEO satellite) than in terrestrial networks, and this will affect both CP and
UP; this can be addressed by implementation.
In the context of a LEO scenario with ISL, the delay to be considered shall
encompass at least the feeder link (SRI) and one or several ISLs.
### 5.2.2 gNB-DU processed payload
#### 5.2.2.1 Overview
The NG-RAN logical architecture with CU/DU split as described in TS 38.401 is
used as baseline for NTN scenarios.
The satellite payload implements regeneration of the signals received from
Earth.
● NR-Uu radio interface on the service link between the satellite and the UE
● Satellite Radio Interface (SRI) on the feeder link between the NTN gateway
and the satellite. The SRI transports the F1 protocol.
The satellite payload may provide inter-satellite links between satellites.
SRI (Satellite Radio Interface) are transport links; the logical interface F1
that they transport are 3GPP-specified.
The NTN GW is a Transport Network Layer node, and supports all necessary
transport protocols.
DU on board different satellites may be connected to the same CU on ground.
If the satellite hosts more than one DU, the same SRI will transport all the
corresponding F1 interface instances.
Figure 5.2.2-1: NG-RAN with a regenerative satellite based on gNB-DU
#### 5.2.2.2 Detailed description of the architecture
The architecture of a regenerative-satellite based NG-RAN is depicted on the
following figures. The mapping to QoS flows is also highlighted.
The PDCP PDUs (Protocol Data Units) are transported by the SRI protocols
stack.
Figure 5.2.2-2: Regenerative satellite based NG-RAN architecture (gNB-DU on
board) with QoS flows
The UE user plane protocol stack for a PDU session is described hereafter.
Figure 5.2.2-3: NG-RAN protocol architecture for regenerative satellite (gNB-
DU on board): User Plane
The Protocol stack of the Satellite Radio Interface (SRI) is used to transport
the UE user plane between satellite and NTN-Gateway.
The User PDUs are transported over GTP-U tunnels between the 5GC and the gNB-
CU.
The User PDUs are transported over GTP-U tunnels between the gNB-CU and the on
board gNB-DU via the NTN Gateway.
The UE control plane protocol stack for a PDU session is described hereafter
Figure 5.2.2-4: NG-RAN protocol architecture for regenerative satellite (gNB-
DU on board): Control Plane
The NG-AP PDUs are transported over SCTP between the 5GC and the gNB-CU.
The RRC PDUs are transported over PDCP over the F1-C protocols stack between
the gNB-CU and the on board gNB-DU, via the NTN Gateway. The F1-C PDUs are
transported over SCTP over IP. IP packets are transported over SRI protocols
stack, at the SRI and over any L2/L1 layers at gNB-CU \-- NTN Gateway
interface.
The NAS protocols (NAS-MM, NAS-SM) are also transported by the NG-AP protocol,
between the 5GC, gNB-CU and the on board gNB-DU, via the NTN Gateway.
#### 5.2.2.3 NG-RAN impacts
RRC and other Layer3 processing are terminated in the gNB-CU on ground, and
are subject to stricter timing constraints.
The use of this architecture option for LEO (Low Earth Orbit) systems or even
for GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit) may impact current F1 implementation (e.g.
timer extensions). Such impact for LEO will be much less significant than for
GEO.
In this architecture, all CP interfaces toward terrestrial NG-RAN nodes are
terminated on the ground.
● With respect to CP, this scenario does not pose any particular issues apart
from the fact that F1AP will need to adapt to the much longer roundtrip times
of the SRI.
● Concerning UP, the instance running over Xn is unaffected by the presence of
the NTN, while the instance running over F1 (transported over the SRI) will
need to adapt to the much longer roundtrip times of the SRI. This, in turn,
will require more buffering for the UP packets into the gNB-CU.
### 5.2.3 gNB processed payload based on relay-like architectures (Optional)
How to apply the Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) proposed architecture
configuration resulting from the IAB SI reflected in the TR 38.874 document
[4] is for further study.
## 5.3 Multi connectivity involving NTN-based NG-RAN
### 5.3.1 Overview
This clause discusses multi connectivity [5], either for transparent or
regenerative NTN-based NG-RAN, and in combination or not with terrestrial-
based NG-RAN (NR or EUTRA). The focus is on dual connectivity with
simultaneous use of two radio access.
This may apply to transparent satellites as well as regenerative satellites
with gNB or gNB-DU function on board.
A number of service scenarios as described in TS 22.261 (e.g. user in
residential homes, in vehicles, in high speed trains or on board airplanes),
would benefit from the combination of terrestrial and non-terrestrial access
to meet the targeted service performances in terms of data rate and/or
reliability.
In underserved areas, the bandwidth provided by a terrestrial based access
(e.g. LTE) may be limited at cell edge. Adding a NTN based NG-RAN will be an
enable to achieve the targeted experience data rate.
Under some scenarios such as high speed trains, the service area may not be
fully homogeneous along the rail track and multi connectivity involving NTN-
based NG-RAN would enable to provide the targeted reliability.
Hence a UE may be connected and served simultaneously by at least:
● One NTN-based NG-RAN and one terrestrial-based access (NR or EUTRA)
● One NTN-based NG-RAN and another NTN-based NG-RAN
As for terrestrial access, connectivity combining can occur for either the
uplink or the downlink or both.
The same gNB could serve NR cells via the terrestrial access network and via
the satellite access network (e.g. with transparent payload on board the
satellite).
### 5.3.2 Architecture aspects
Multi connectivity involving transparent NTN-based NG-RAN
A User Equipment is connected to a 5GCN via simultaneously a transparent NTN-
based NG-RAN and a cellular NG-RAN. We assume that the NTN Gateway is located
in the PLMN area of the cellular access network.
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="2.248611111111111in"}
Figure 5.3.2-1: Multi connectivity involving transparent NTN-based NG-RAN and
cellular NG-RAN
Both gNB of the NTN-based NG-RAN or the gNB of the cellular NG-RAN could be
elected as master node.
Figure 5.3.2-2: Radio Protocol Architecture for MCG, SCG and split bearers
from a UE perspective in MR-DC with 5GC
Another case to be considered, refers to the combination of two Transparent
NTN-based NG-RANs either GEO or LEO based or a combination of both. This is of
interest to provide service to UEs in unserved areas. The LEO NTN-based NG-RAN
featuring relatively low latency can be used to support the delay sensitive
traffic while the GEO NTN-based NG-RAN would provide additional bandwidth to
meet the targeted throughput requirements. This is depicted in the figure
below.
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="2.248611111111111in"}
Figure 5.3.2-3: Multi connectivity between two transparent NTN-based NG-RAN
_Multi connectivity involving regenerative NTN-based NG-RAN (gNB-DU on board)_
Another case to be considered, refers to the combination of a regenerative
NTN-based NG-RAN (gNB-DU on board) and a cellular NG-RAN. This is of interest
to provide service to UEs in underserved areas. This is depicted in the figure
below.
{width="6.698611111111111in" height="2.3069444444444445in"}
Figure 5.3.2-4: Multi connectivity involving regenerative NTN-based NG-RAN
(gNB-DU) and cellular NG-RAN
Note that the multi connectivity may also involve two regenerative NTN-based
NG-RAN (gNB-DU on board)
_Multi connectivity involving regenerative NTN-based NG-RAN (gNB on board)_
The combination of two regenerative NTN-based NG-RAN (gNB on board) either GEO
or LEO based or a combination of both with Inter Satellite Links in between is
also worth to consider to provide service to UEs in unserved areas. This is
depicted in the figure below.
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="2.2284722222222224in"}
Figure 5.3.2-5: Multi connectivity between two regenerative NTN-based NG-RAN
(gNB on board)
Note that multi connectivity between regenerative NTN-based NG-RAN (gNB on
board) and cellular NG-RAN (NR or LTE based) is not addressed because the
transport of Xn protocol over the Feeder link (based on Satellite Radio
interface) is For Further Study.
### 5.3.3 NG-RAN impacts
In case of multi-connectivity involving transparent NTN-based NG-RAN (i.e. gNB
on the ground), all CP and UP interfaces toward terrestrial NG-RAN nodes are
terminated on the ground.
In case of multi-connectivity involving regenerative NTN-based NG-RAN with
gNB-CU on the ground and gNB-DU on board, all CP interfaces toward terrestrial
NG-RAN nodes are terminated on the ground.
● With respect to CP, this scenario does not pose any particular issues apart
from the fact that F1AP will need to adapt to the much longer roundtrip times
of the SRI.
● Concerning UP, the leg running over Xn is unaffected by the presence of the
NTN, while the leg running over F1 (transported over the SRI) will need to
adapt to the much longer roundtrip times of the SRI. Overall, UP buffering in
the node hosting PDCP will need to compensate for the difference between the
two interfaces. Therefore, there will be an impact on the terrestrial NG-RAN
node involved in DC if such NG-RAN node hosts the PDCP.
In case of multi Connectivity involving regenerative NTN-based NG-RAN with on
board gNB, setting up and maintaining Xn interfaces toward terrestrial gNBs
over the feeder link would require all the corresponding traffic (CP and UP)
to be transported over the SRI relevant to the satellite-hosted gNB. This may
be a challenge.
Prerequisites for NR-NR DC where both MN and SN are NTN-based are to have at
least a partial coverage area overlap, and to have Xn up and running through
the ISL between them. The Xn connection between the satellites will add to the
delay. NR-NR DC involving satellites whose orbital positions are close to one
is feasible.
The multi connectivity procedure as defined in [5] may require some
adaptations to support:
● Radio access technology featuring extended latency
● Radio access technology possibly suffering from variable latency within the
backhaul network (e.g. a Xn interface crossing multiple satellite located on
different orbital plane)
● Differentiated delay between both radio access technology involved
NG-RAN should allow the necessary flexibility to elect as master node either
the gNB of the NTN-based NG-RAN or the gNB of the cellular NG-RAN.
## 5.4 Service continuity between NTN and Terrestrial Networks
In TS 22.261 (Clause 6.2.3 Service continuity requirements), for a 5G system
with satellite access, the following requirements apply:
\- The 5G system shall support service continuity between 5G terrestrial
access network and 5G satellite access networks owned by the same operator or
owned by 2 different operators having an agreement.
{width="6.560416666666667in" height="3.8159722222222223in"}
Figure 5.4-1: Typical example of NTN-TN interworking
The NTN and TN could either operate in two different frequency bands (e.g. FR1
vs FR2), or in same frequency band (e.g. FR1 or FR2).
The NTN reference scenarios as listed in chapter 4.2 considers two types of
NTN UEs, a) UE with Omni directional antenna, b) UE with directive antenna.
For the support of NTN-TN service continuity use cases, assumptions on UE
characteristics considering NTN use cases are listed in the below table:
Table 5.4-1: NTN use cases mapped to TN-NTN service continuity use cases and
assumptions for frequency band and UE characteristics

### 5.4.1 Scope
The focus of the NTN-TN service continuity and mobility studies should be on
mechanisms to minimize specification impact for cases where UE\'s connectivity
changes from the NTN to TN (\'hand-in\') and where UE\'s connectivity changes
from the TN to NTN (\'hand-out\'). Coverage mechanisms, including inter-
frequency and intra-frequency service continuity and mobility mechanisms are
to be considered as baseline solutions. The NR Release 15-16 service
continuity and mobility mechanisms shall be considered also for the NTN-TN
service continuity and mobility studies.
### 5.4.2 Reference scenario
It is recommended to use a reference scenario for NTN-TN service continuity
and mobility studies, defined as follows:
● A multi-cell TN network-border coverage is available according to an outdoor
rural NR scenario (e.g. Table 6.1.3-1 in TR 38.913)
● One NTN LEO satellite provides multi-cell coverage with moving cells on
Earth (the satellite NR cells are modelled according to NTN assumptions, Table
6.1.1-1 & 4 in TR38.821)
● Outdoor handheld (pedestrian) UEs or VSAT (vehicular relay) UEs are capable
of TN and NTN connectivity (for NTN UE use Table 6.1.1-3 in TR 38.821)
### 5.4.3 Assumptions
The NTN-TN service continuity and mobility mechanisms targeted to minimizing
UE power consumption, e.g. DRX enhancement solutions are only a secondary
priority.
The study of dual-connectivity mechanisms between NTN and TN, in the baseline
NTN-TN service continuity and mobility solutions is a secondary priority.
# 6 Radio Layer 1 issues and related solutions
## 6.1 Link-Level and System-Level Evaluations
Both multi-satellite and single satellite simulations should be considered for
calibration and performance evaluation.
### 6.1.1 System level simulations
#### 6.1.1.1 Simulation assumptions
The following tables representing two sets of satellite parameters are
considered as the baseline for system level simulator calibration:

Traditionally, the wrap around mechanism used in system level simulations
refers to a mirroring effect of the surrounding cells/beams so that the
computational load of the simulations can be reduced. However, these types of
schemes are not applicable in NTN context except in the specific case of
central beam at nadir (90° elevation). Therefore, for the evaluation, all the
additional surrounding beams should be simulated independently.
As a consequence, a new wrap around mechanism is introduced in case of single
satellite simulation for intra-satellite interference modelling based on
additional bore-sight beam directions which should be computed based on the
methodology captured in Table 6.1.1.1-4.
In particular, the following wrap-around mechanism should be adopted for
calibration:
● For FRF = 1, two additional tiers of beams are considered in the simulation
surrounding the 19-beam layout (cf. Figure 6.1.1.1-1 -- FRF=1).
● For FRF > 1, four additional tiers of beams are considered in the simulation
surrounding the 19-beam layout (cf. Figure 6.1.1.1-1 -- FRF=3).
● Considering a UE attached to a beam, in the DL/UL all remaining beams are
treated as interference as long as these beams are sharing the same frequency
band/polarization (cf. Figure 6.1.1.1-2).
For the metrics statistic (e.g. coupling loss, geometry), only the UEs placed
in the inner-19 beams are considered.
Figure 6.1.1.1-1: Illustrations of the additional tiers of beams to be wrapped
around based on the FRF configurations
Figure 6.1.1.1-2: Definition of the interfering beams to be considered
The beam layout parameters captured in the following table are adopted as a
starting point for single satellite simulations.

For handheld terminal, the following association between antenna port and
antenna element is assumed for calibration, evaluations and link budgets
calculation:
● 1 TX with one antenna element associated to one Tx branch.
● 2 RX with each antenna element associated to one Rx branch.
NOTE: Implementations without the above association can be evaluated in
addition
As a consequence, the following considerations are assumed for handheld use
cases:
● For downlink transmission, a combination of the two Rx branches allows to
prevent depolarization loss. (cf. Figure 6.1.1.1-3)
● For uplink transmissions,
\- A 3dB depolarization loss should be taken into account assuming
polarization reuse is applied and satellite reception implements circular
polarization (e.g., when frequency reuse option 3 is considered) (cf. Figure
6.1.1.1-4 -- configuration A)
\- A 0dB depolarization loss can be assumed when satellite reception
implements dual polarization per beam (e.g., for the frequency reuse 1 and 3
cases) (cf. Figure 6.1.1.1-4 -- configuration B)
Figure 6.1.1.1-3: Example of DL RX/TX configuration for handheld use cases
Figure 6.1.1.1-4: Example of UL RX/TX configurations for handheld use cases
For VSAT use cases, calibration results and link budgets should be computed
assuming no depolarization loss.

### 6.1.4 Multiple satellites simulation
#### 6.1.4.1 Simulation cases
For multiple satellites simulation, the cases defined for single satellite in
Table 6.1.1.1-9 can be reused. Prioritization on the LEO can be considered for
multiple satellites simulation.
#### 6.1.4.2 Methodology for multiple satellites simulation
To emulate the effects of multiple satellites, the following two options can
be considered:
● Option-1: simulation based on the reference constellation
In this option, as mentioned in [22][25][26], a reference constellation should
be defined to construct the satellite and beam layout as shown in Figure
6.1.4.2-1, with corresponding parameters, e.g., number of orbit/satellites,
number of beam illustrated in Figure 6.1.4.2-2. Detailed parameters can be
determined jointly with consideration on the RF characteristic of beams
together with design principle for constellation, e.g., how to achieve global
coverage. Furthermore, the simulated area must be defined, because the
coverage of the constellation depends on where on earth users are located.

(e.g., polar orbit with clock-wise movement)
● Option-2: simulation based on the regional beam layouts for multiple
satellites
In this option, as mentioned in [27], regional beam layout for multiple
satellites can be constructed as shown in Figure 6.1.4.2-3, e.g., beam with
same colour belong to single satellite. Fixed orbit inclination can be assumed
for simplicity and additional parameters, e.g., number of orbit, satellite per
orbit, are introduced to enable the flexibility on the coverage for the
overall beam layout. Reuse of the same satellite RF parameters as the single
satellite simulation is feasible. Instead of using 7 satellites, a simpler
scenario focused on throughput can also be constructed using 3 satellites as
outlined in [28].

## 6.2 Physical layer control procedures
### 6.2.1 Timing relationships
The propagation delays in terrestrial mobile systems are usually less than 1
ms. In contrast, the propagation delays in NTN are much longer, ranging from
several milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds depending on the altitudes of
the spaceborne or airborne platforms and payload type in NTN. Dealing with
such long propagation delays requires modifications of many timing aspects in
NR from physical layer to higher layers, including the timing advance (TA)
mechanism.
In an NTN, a UE may need to apply a large TA value that leads to a large
offset in its DL and UL frame timing. Figure 6.2.1-1 illustrates a scenario,
where the UE applies a large TA and gNB\'s DL and UL frame timing are aligned.
Another solution proposed does not need the alignment between gNB\'s DL and UL
frame, illustrated in Figure 6.2.1-2, where the UE applies a UE specific
differential TA and a common TA offset in the gNB\'s DL and UL frame timing
exists. However, for the solution illustrated in Figure 6.2.1-2, additional
complexity is needed at network side to manage corresponding scheduling timing
for this scenario. Various NR physical layer timing relationships need to be
enhanced to cope with the large offset in the UE\'s DL and UL frame timing.

the gNB\'s DL and UL frame timing
#### 6.2.1.1 Background
The existing NR timing relationships are described as follows.
● **PDSCH reception timing:** When the UE is scheduled to receive PDSCH by a
DCI, the DCI indicates the slot offset {width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} among other things. The slot allocated for the
PDSCH is {width="1.03125in" height="0.2604166666666667in"}, where
{width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} is the slot
with the scheduling DCI, {width="0.17708333333333334in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}is based on the numerology of PDSCH, and
{width="0.40625in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} and {width="0.40625in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} are the subcarrier spacing configurations for
PDSCH and PDCCH, respectively. The value of {width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} is in the range of 0, ..., 32.
● **Transmission timing for PUSCH scheduled by DCI:** When the UE is scheduled
to transmit PUSCH by a DCI, the DCI indicates the slot offset
{width="0.14583333333333334in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} among other
things. The slot allocated for the PUSCH is {width="1.03125in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"}, where {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} is the slot with the scheduling DCI,
{width="0.14583333333333334in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} is based on the
numerology of PUSCH, and {width="0.40625in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}
and {width="0.40625in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} are the subcarrier
spacing configurations for PUSCH and PDCCH, respectively. The value of
{width="0.14583333333333334in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} is in the range
of 0, ..., 32.
● **Transmission timing for PUSCH scheduled by RAR grant:** With reference to
slots for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant, if a UE receives a
PDSCH with a RAR message ending in slot {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} for a corresponding PRACH transmission from
the UE, the UE transmits the PUSCH in slot {width="0.7395833333333334in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}, where {width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} and {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} are provided in TS 38.214.
● **Transmission timing for HARQ-ACK on PUCCH:** With reference to slots for
PUCCH transmissions, for a PDSCH reception ending in slot
{width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} or a SPS PDSCH
release through a PDCCH reception ending in slot
{width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}, the UE
provides corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within
slot {width="0.3958333333333333in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}, where
{width="0.14583333333333334in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} is a number of
slots and is indicated by the PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing-indicator field in the DCI
format, if present, or provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK. {width="0.40625in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} corresponds to the last slot of the PUCCH
transmission that overlaps with the PDSCH reception or with the PDCCH
reception in case of SPS PDSCH release.
● **MAC CE action timing:** When the HARQ-ACK corresponding to a PDSCH
carrying a MAC-CE command is transmitted in slot
{width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}, the
corresponding action and the UE assumption on the downlink configuration
indicated by the MAC-CE command shall be applied starting from the first slot
that is after slot {width="1.0104166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}{width="1.4791666666666667in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}, where {width="0.6875in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} denotes the number of slots per subframe for
subcarrier spacing configuration {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}.
● **Transmission timing for CSI on PUSCH:** The transmission timing of CSI on
PUSCH follows the general transmission timing for DCI scheduled PUSCH.
● **CSI reference resource timing:** The CSI reference resource for a CSI
report in uplink slot {width="0.125in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} is
defined by a single downlink slot {width="0.6875in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"}, where {width="0.8333333333333334in"
height="0.25in"}. Here, {width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} and {width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} are the subcarrier spacing configurations for
DL and UL, respectively. The value of {width="0.4375in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"} depends on the type of CSI report and is
defined in TS 38.214.
● **Aperiodic SRS transmission timing:** If a UE receives a DCI triggering
aperiodic SRS in slot n, the UE transmits aperiodic SRS in each of the
triggered SRS resource set(s) in slot {width="0.9791666666666666in"
height="0.25in"}, where k is configured via higher layer parameter slotOffset
for each triggered SRS resources set and is based on the subcarrier spacing of
the triggered SRS transmission, {width="0.25in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} and {width="0.40625in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} are the subcarrier spacing configurations for
triggered SRS and PDCCH carrying the triggering command respectively.
The existing NR timing definitions involving DL-UL timing interaction may not
hold when there is a large offset in the UE\'s DL and UL frame timing in NTN.
Thus, the timing relationships need to be enhanced.
#### 6.2.1.2 Enhancements
The PDSCH reception timing is defined solely from DL timing perspective. It is
not impacted by the large offset in the UE\'s DL and UL frame timing and thus
enhancement is not needed.
The other timing relationships described in Section 6.2.1.1involve DL-UL
timing interaction and thus need to be enhanced for NTN. The enhancement can
be to introduce an offset {width="0.40625in" height="0.17708333333333334in"}
and applying it to modify the relevant timing relationships.
● For the transmission timing of DCI scheduled PUSCH (including CSI on PUSCH),
the slot allocated for the PUSCH can be modified to be
{width="1.6041666666666667in" height="0.2604166666666667in"}.
● For the transmission timing of RAR grant scheduled PUSCH, the UE transmits
the PUSCH in slot {width="1.3125in" height="0.17708333333333334in"}.
● For the transmission timing of HARQ-ACK on PUCCH, the UE provides
corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within slot
{width="0.96875in" height="0.17708333333333334in"}.
● For the MAC CE action timing, the corresponding action and the UE assumption
on the downlink configuration indicated by the MAC-CE command shall be applied
starting from the first slot that is after slot {width="1.59375in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}{width="1.4791666666666667in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}, where the value of {width="9.375e-2in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} may depend on NTN UE capability and may not
necessarily be equal to {width="7.291666666666667e-2in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}. How to determine the value of
{width="9.375e-2in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} is for further study.
● For the CSI reference resource timing, the CSI reference resource is given
in the downlink slot {width="1.21875in" height="0.19791666666666666in"}.
● For the transmission timing of aperiodic SRS, the UE transmits aperiodic SRS
in each of the triggered SRS resource set(s) in slot {width="1.5625in"
height="0.3125in"}.
The values of {width="0.40625in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} may be
different for each of the identified timing relationships that need to be
modified for NTN.
The values of {width="0.40625in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} can be per
beam or per-cell. It is for further study whether {width="0.40625in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"} is derived from broadcast information or is
signalled by higher layers. The possibility of extending the range K~1~ and/or
K~2~ beyond what is supported in NR Rel-15 can be further discussed when the
specifications are developed.
### 6.2.2 Uplink power control
The following uplink power control solutions were discussed during the study
item phase:
● One source [29] proposed beam-specific configuration for power control
parameter {width="0.13541666666666666in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} and
common {width="0.46875in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} parameter for all
beams;
● Two sources ([30] and [31]) proposed UE prediction of its own transmission
power using other available information such as satellite ephemeris and UE
trajectory
● One source ([32]) proposed adaptive uplink power control based on adaptive
UE configuration of Layer 3 filter coefficients (i.e., configuring multiple
Layer 3 filter coefficients and letting UE select one of the Layer 3 filter
coefficients based on measured RSRP).
● One source [33] proposed that UE can be configured with different uplink
power control parameters such as P0 and alpha parameters for disabled and
enabled HARQ processes.
● One source [31] proposed that the transmission power of different UEs can be
adjusted as a group with a reference UE transmission power. In addition, the
source proposed a mechanism to disable closed loop power control.
The above optimizations were discussed without any convergence one particular
solution. As a result, it was concluded that NR Release-15 power control
schemes can be used for NTN.
### 6.2.3 AMC and delayed CSI feedback
Two sources ([32] and [34]) contributed link-level simulation results to show
the effect of increased CSI feedback delay (i.e., CSI aging) on throughput
performance. The observations from these results are summarized below:
● Observation 1: For NTN-TDL-C (LOS) channel model, the two sources ([32] and
[34]) show that the performance loss due to CSI aging is low to marginal. For
instance, at an SNR of 10 dB at a UE speed of 3 km/hr,
\- Source 1 [32] results show that there is a throughput loss of around 10% as
the feedback delay increases from 6 ms to 40 ms, and
\- Source 2 [34] results show that the spectral efficiency degrades by around
12% as the feedback delay increases from 6 ms to 46 ms.
● Observation 2: For NTN-TDL-A (NLOS) channel model, the two sources ([32] and
[34]) show that the performance loss is more significant. For instance, at an
SNR of 10 dB at a UE speed of 3 km/hr,
\- Source 1 [32] results show that there is a throughput loss of around 38% as
the feedback delay increases from 6 ms to 40 ms, and
\- Source 2 [34] results show that the spectral efficiency degrades by around
28% as the feedback delay increases from 6 ms to 46 ms.
● Observation 3: For NTN-TDL-A (NLOS) channel model, Source 1 [32] shows that
the performance loss saturates beyond a certain feedback delay for a given UE
speed. For instance, the throughput loss saturates beyond 40 ms feedback delay
at a UE speed of 3 km/hr.
● Observation 4: For both NTN-TDL-C (LOS) and NTN-TDL-A (NLOS) channel models,
Source 1 [32] shows that with a UE speed of 30 km/hr, there is almost no
observable performance loss as the feedback delay increases from 6 ms to 201
ms.
Based on the above results from the two sources ([32] and [34]), it is
concluded that the performance loss due to increased CSI feedback delay
depends on both the channel conditions as well as the UE speed:
● In LOS conditions, results from two sources show that the performance loss
due to CSI aging is low to marginal at a UE speed of 3 km/hr.
● In NLOS conditions, results from two sources show that the performance loss
due to CSI aging is significant at a UE speed of 3 km/hr.
● In both LOS and NLOS conditions, results from one source show that there is
no observable performance loss due to CSI aging at a UE speed of 30 km/hr.
One solution to address the issue of performance losses due to CSI aging that
was evaluated is based on CSI reporting with channel averaging to capture the
long-term fading. This solution was evaluated by two sources ([32] and [34])
to show the effect of channel averaging on the performance when there is large
CSI feedback delay. The evaluations results show the following observation:
● At 3 km/hr UE speed with ideal channel estimation, channel averaging to
capture long-term fading does not improve throughput compared to the case with
no channel averaging.
Based on the above results, the following is concluded regarding the effect of
channel averaging on the performance when there is large CSI feedback delay:
Based on results from two sources ([32] and [34]), channel averaging to
capture long-term fading does not improve throughput compared to the case with
no channel averaging at a UE speed of 3 km/hr with ideal channel estimation.
A second solution to address the issue of performance losses due to CSI aging
that was evaluated is uses CSI prediction-based link adaptation. Two sources
([35] and [34]) provided additional simulation results to show the effect of
CSI prediction on throughput performance. These evaluations show the following
observation:
● Performance gains can be achieved with the introduction of CSI feedback with
prediction when compared to CSI feedback without prediction.
\- For NTN-TDL-A (NLOS) channel model, Source 2 [34] results show that the
spectral efficiency can be improved by 10% at an SNR of 10 dB and a UE speed
of 3 km/hr.
\- For NTN-TDL-B (NLOS) channel model, Source 3 ([35]) results show a 10%
throughput improvement at an SNR of 10 dB and a UE speed of 3 km/hr.
During discussions related to prediction-based CSI, some sources were of the
view that this can be achieved via implementation without any specification
impact. One source was of the view that prediction-based CSI may involve
specification impact (e.g., UE reports additional parameters, e.g., variant
rate of CQI, in CSI). Based on the above results, the following is concluded
regarding the effect of prediction-based CSI on the performance when there is
large CSI feedback delay:
Based on results from two sources under NLOS conditions, CSI prediction
improves throughput compared to the case with no CSI prediction.
● CSI prediction can be achieved via implementation and there is no consensus
on specification changes with respect to CSI prediction enhancements for NTN.
A few other solutions were discussed but there were no evaluation results
available for these solutions. The solutions without evaluation results are
given below:
● Introduction of finer granularity of CQI to allow more accurate choice of
MCS on a stable LoS channel proposed by two sources ([36] and [37]).
● Introduction of new BLER targets for CQI reporting in order to limit number
of retransmissions and thereby latency proposed by three sources ([38], [39]
and [36]).
● Application of a lower modulation order and coding rate than that based on
the reported CQI values by the gNB to guarantee the reliability at the
potential cost of spectrum efficiency [31], [33]
● Introduction of a CQI report disabling mechanism based on certain conditions
such as satellite and/or UE location and speed, channel condition, etc. For
example, if the distance between the UE and the satellite is very large and/or
the propagation delay is larger than a certain threshold, CQI reporting is
disabled [31].
Based on the results and discussion, the following is concluded for AMC and
delayed CSI feedback:
The CSI framework specified in NR Rel-15 can be used for NTN link adaptation
at least for LOS scenarios. Further optimizations were discussed without any
convergence on particular solutions.
### 6.2.4 Beam management and polarization support
The proposals for beam management in NTN that were discussed during study
phase are summarized below:
● Two sources ([40], [34]) proposed that for frequency reuse 1, rel-15 beam
management can be used. For frequency reuse > 1, it was proposed that two
Rel-15 based schemes are possible: (1) where one BWP is used for each
satellite beam (proposed in [40] and [34]), and (2) where one component
carrier is used per satellite beam (proposed in [40]).
● One source [41] proposed to consider additional beam management CSI-RS
configurations to support different satellite implementation needs.
● One source [42] proposed to introduce a mechanism where the both the Uplink
and Downlink BWPs are switched simultaneously using a single DCI to support
fast satellite beam switching.
● One source [29] proposed that the concept of BWP can be used for frequency
resource allocation among NTN beams, and that the network may configure a
specific active BWP for UEs in a beam.
● One source [35] proposed to increase the number of BWPs for NTN.
The proposed solutions for beam management for NTN were quite diverse and
convergence to one particular solution was not possible at the conclusion of
the study phase. Hence, the following conclusion was drawn for NTN beam
management:
The rel-15/16 beam management and BWP operation are considered as baseline for
NTN. Beam management and BWP operation for NTN with frequency reuse should be
discussed further when specifications are developed.
Note that service link switching is seen as a part of beam management
mechanism in NR NTN.
Another issue raised several sources is on polarization mode
configuration/signalling. In NTN networks, neighbouring cells may use
different polarization modes (RHCP and LHCP) to mitigate inter-cell
interference. Furthermore, there may be UEs with different antenna types. Some
UEs may be equipped with linearly polarized antennas, while some other UEs may
be equipped with circularly polarized antennas. Three sources ([32], [35], and
[40]) proposed that it is beneficial to signal the polarization mode for NTN
in certain scenarios (particularly when the UE is capable of differentiating
RHCP and LHCP with the circularly or linearly polarized antennas). Based on
the discussion, the following is concluded:
Signalling of polarization mode is beneficial for NTN in certain scenarios.
Whether to support the signalling can be discussed further when specifications
are developed.
### 6.2.5 Impact of feeder link switch
For the issue of feeder link switch and its potential impact on PHY layer
procedures, the following conclusion is made:
Impacts of feeder link switch on physical layer procedures can be further
discussed when specifications are developed.
## 6.3 Uplink timing advance/RACH procedure
### 6.3.1 General
The following aspects have been studied based on NR Rel-15/16 design:
1) DL synchronization via SSB
2) Random access via PRACH
3) Maintenance for UL timing advance and frequency synchronization
The evaluations and analysis are conducted considering on characteristics of
satellite communication systems, e.g., possibly large cell coverage and high
Doppler. Meanwhile, the impacts due to some typical implementations in
existing satellite systems, e.g., partial frequency pre-compensation for DL
and timing post-compensation at satellite network side, are also taken into
account. According to the corresponding results, solutions and conclusions
along with some observations are presented.
### 6.3.2 DL synchronization
According to the simulation assumptions in Table 6.1.2-1, the performance
evaluation on the DL synchronization performance is conducted. The
corresponding results from [43], [44], [45], [46], [47] are summarized in
[48]. It is observed that for DL initial synchronization, robust performance
can be provided by the SSB design in Rel-15 in case of GEO and LEO with beam
specific pre-compensation of common frequency shift, e.g., conducted with
respect to the spot beam center at network side, respectively.
However, for the LEO without pre-compensation of the frequency offset,
additional complexity is needed at UE receiver to achieve robust DL initial
synchronization performance based on Rel-15 SSB. No further enhancement on the
SSB is needed.
Additionally, w.r.t the performance on the DL timing/frequency tracking, no
issues have been identified based on Rel-15/16 NR design. Potential
optimization can be further considered in potential normative phase if
necessary.
### 6.3.3 Random access
According to the simulation assumptions in Table 6.1.2-2, the performance of
Rel-15 PRACH design is verified in several typical scenarios for NTN as listed
in Table 6.1.2-3.
Based on the results summarized in [49], [50], it is observed that with
assumption on pre-compensation of timing and frequency offset (e.g., if UE
knowledge of geo-location of the UE at the requisite level of accuracy is
available) at UE side for UL transmission, existing Rel-15 PRACH formats and
preamble sequences can be reused. The necessity of additional enhancements,
e.g., repetitions and/or larger sub-carrier spacing, to ensure UL coverage can
be further discussed in the normative work.
However, in case pre-compensation of timing and frequency offset is not
performed at UE side for UL transmission, enhanced PRACH formats and/or
preamble sequences should be supported with following options:
● Option-1: A single Zadoff-Chu sequence based on larger SCS, repetition
number. Additional usage of CP and Ncs can be further determined in normative
work [51], [52], [53], [54].
● Option-2: A solution based on multiple Zadoff-Chu sequences with different
roots [54], [55], [56]
● Option-3: Gold/m-sequence as preamble sequence with additional process,
e.g., modulation and transform precoding [57], [51]
● Option-4: A single Zadoff-Chu sequence with combination of scrambling
sequence [58], [59], [51]
Further discussions to down select these candidates are needed in the
normative work.
### 6.3.4 Maintenance for UL timing advance and frequency synchronization
With consideration on the larger cell coverage, long round trip time (RTT) and
high Doppler, enhancements are considered to ensure the performance for timing
and frequency synchronization for UL transmission.
{width="6.430555555555555in" height="2.5694444444444446in"}
Figure 6.3.4-1: Illustration of the TA components in NTN (For simplicity, TA
offset {width="0.5333333333333333in" height="0.19166666666666668in"} is not
plotted.)
For the timing advance (TA) in the initial access and the subsequent TA
maintenance, the following solutions are identified with an illustration of
the definition of terminology given in Figure 6.3.4-1:
● Option 1: Autonomous acquisition of the TA at UE with UE known location and
satellite ephemeris.
> In this way, the required TA value for UL transmission including PRACH can
> be calculated by the UE. The corresponding adjustment can be done, either
> with UE-specific differential TA or full TA (consisting of UE specific
> differential TA and common TA).
>
> W.r.t the full TA compensation at the UE side, both the alignment on the UL
> timing among UEs and DL and UL frame timing at network side can be achieved.
> However, in case of satellite with transparent payload, further discussion
> on how to handle the impact introduced by feeder link will be conducted in
> normative work. Additional needs for the network to manage the timing offset
> between the DL and UL frame timing can be considered, if impacts introduced
> by feeder link is not compensated by UE in corresponding compensation.
>
> W.r.t the UE specific differential TA only, additional indication on a
> single reference point should be signalled to UEs per beam/cell for
> achieving the UL timing alignment among UEs within the coverage of the same
> beam/cell. Timing offset between DL and UL frame timing at the network side
> should also be managed by the network regardless of the satellite payload
> type.
>
> With concern on the accuracy on the self-calculated TA value at the UE side,
> additional TA signalling from network to UE for TA refinement, e.g., during
> initial access and/or TA maintenance, can be determined in the normative
> work.
● Option 2: Timing advanced adjustment based on network indication
> In this way, the common TA, which refers to the common component of
> propagation delay shared by all UEs within the coverage of same satellite
> beam/cell, is broadcasted by the network per satellite beam/cell. The
> calculation of this common TA is conducted by the network with assumption on
> at least a single reference point per satellite beam/cell.
>
> The indication for UE-specific differential TA from network as the Rel-15 TA
> mechanism is also needed. For satisfying the larger coverage of NTN,
> extension of value range for TA indication in RAR, either explicitly or
> implicitly, is identified. Whether to support negative TA value in
> corresponding indication will be determined in the normative phase.
>
> Moreover, indication of timing drift rate, from the network to UE, is also
> supported to enable the TA adjustment at UE side.
For calculation of common TA in the above two options, single reference point
per beam is considered as the baseline. Whether and how to support the
multiple reference points can be further discussed in the normative work.
For the UL frequency compensation, at least for LEO system, the following
solutions are identified with consideration on the beam specific post-
compensation of common frequency offset at the network side:
● Option-1: Both the estimation and pre-compensation of UE-specific frequency
offset are conducted at the UE side. The acquisition of this value can be done
by utilizing DL reference signals, UE location and satellite ephemeris.
● Option-2: The required frequency offset for UL frequency compensation at
least in LEO systems is indicated by the network to UE. The acquisition on
this value can be done at the network side with detection of UL signals, e.g.,
preamble.
Indication of compensated frequency offset values by the network is also
supported in case that compensation of the frequency offset is conducted by
the network in the uplink and/or the downlink respectively. However,
indication of Doppler drift rate is not necessary.
The detailed signalling design for the above enhancements will be determined
in the normative work.
## 6.4 More delay-tolerant re-transmission mechanisms
Two main aspects of more delay-tolerant re-transmission mechanisms have been
studied
● Disabling of HARQ in NR NTN
● HARQ optimization in NR-NTN
HARQ Round Trip Time in NR is of the order of several milliseconds. The
propagation delays in NTN are much longer, ranging from several milliseconds
to hundreds of milliseconds depending on the satellite orbit. The HARQ RTT can
be much longer in NTN. It was identified early in the study phase that there
would be a need to discuss potential impact and solutions on HARQ procedure.
RAN1 has focussed on physical layer aspects while RAN2 has focused on MAC
layer aspects.
### 6.4.1 Disabling of HARQ in NR NTN
RAN2 made recommendation in Section 7.2.1.4 HARQ. It was discussed that when
UL HARQ feedback is disabled, there could be issues if (i) MAC CE and RRC
signalling are not received by UE, or (ii) DL packets not correctly received
by UE for a long period of time without gNB knowing it.
The following were discussed without convergence on the necessity of
introducing such solutions for NTN when HARQ feedback is disabled
● Indicate HARQ disabling via DCI in new/re-interpreted field [60], [61]
● New UCI feedback for reporting DL transmission disruption and or requesting
DL scheduling changes [62], [63]
The following possible enhancements for slot-aggregation or blind repetitions
were considered. There is no convergence on the necessity of introducing such
enhancements for NTN.
● Greater than 8 slot-aggregation [64]
● Time-interleaved slot aggregation [65]
● New MCS table [66]
### 6.4.2 HARQ Optimization for NR NTN
Solutions to avoid reduction in peak data rates in NTN were discussed. One
solution is to increase the number of HARQ processes to match the longer
satellite round trip delay to avoid stop-and-wait in HARQ procedure. Another
solution is to disable UL HARQ feedback to avoid stop-and-wait in HARQ
procedure and rely on RLC ARQ for reliability. The throughput performance for
both types of solutions was evaluated at link level and system level by
several contributing companies.
The observations from the evaluations performed on the effect of the number of
HARQ processes on performance are summarized as follows:
● Three sources [72][64][70] provided link-level simulations of throughput
versus SNR with the following observations:
\- One source simulated with a TDL-D suburban channel with elevation angle of
30 degrees with BLER target of 1% for RLC ARQ with 16 HARQ processes, and BLER
targets 1% and 10% with 32/64/128/256 HARQ processes. There was no observable
gain in throughput with increased number of HARQ processes compared to RLC
layer re-transmission with RTT in {32, 64, 128, 256} ms.
\- One source simulated with a TDL-D suburban channel with elevation angle of
30 degrees with BLER targets of 0.1% for RLC ARQ with 16 HARQ processes, and
BLER targets 1% and 10% with 32 HARQ processes. An average throughput gain of
10% was observed with 32 HARQ processes compared to RLC ARQ with 16 HARQ
processes with RTT = 32 ms.
\- One source provides the simulation results in following cases with RTT = 32
ms, e.g., assuming BLER targets at 1% for RLC ARQ with 16 HARQ processes, BLER
targets 1% and 10% with 32 HARQ processes. There is no observable gain in
throughput with 32 HARQ processes compared to RLC ARQ with 16 HARQ processes
in case that channel is assumed as TDL-D with delay spread/ K-factor taken
from system channel model in suburban scenario with elevation angle 30.
Performance gain can be observed with other channels, especially, up to 12.5%
spectral efficiency gain is achieved in case that channel is assumed as TDL-A
in suburban with 30° elevation angle. Moreover, simulation based on the
simulation with consideration on other scheduling operations: (i) additional
MCS offset, (ii) MCS table based on lower efficiency (iii) slot aggregation
with different BLER targets are conducted. Significant gain can be observed
with enlarging the HARQ process number.
● One source [73] provided system level simulations for LEO=1200 km with 20%
resource utilisation, 16 and 32 HARQ processes, 15 and 20 UEs per cell,
proportional fair scheduling, and no frequency re-use. The spectral efficiency
gain per user with 32 HARQ processes compared to 16 HARQ processes depends on
the number of UEs. With 15 UEs per beam, an average spectral efficiency gain
of 12% at 50% per centile is observed. With 20 UEs per cell there is no
observable gain.
The following options were considered with no convergence on which option to
choose:
● Option 1: Keep 16 HARQ process IDs and rely on RLC ARQ for HARQ processes
with UL HARQ feedback disabled via RRC
● Option 2: Greater than 16 HARQ process IDs with UL HARQ feedback enabled via
RRC with following consideration
\- UE capability if greater than 16 HARQ process IDs
\- Keep 4-bit HARQ process ID field in DCI
The following solutions were considered for greater than 16 HARQ processes
keeping the 4-bit HARQ process ID field in DCI:
● Slot number based [62], [67], [68], [60], [69]
● Virtual process ID based with HARQ re-transmission timing restrictions [61]
● Reuse HARQ process ID within RTD (time window) [69]
● Re-interpretation of existing DCI fields with assistance information from
higher layers [70]
One source also considered solutions where the HARQ process ID field is
increased beyond 4 bits [65]
With regards to HARQ enhancements for soft buffer management and stop-and-wait
time reduction, the following options were considered with no convergence on
which, if any, of the options, to choose:
● Option 1: Pre-active/pre-emptive HARQ to reduce stop-and-wait time [71],
[66]
● Option 2: Enabling / disabling of HARQ buffer usage configurable on a per UE
and per HARQ process [67], [64], [69]
● Option 3: HARQ buffer status report from the UE [67]
The number of HARQ processes with additional considerations for HARQ feedback,
HARQ buffer size, RLC feedback, and RLC ARQ buffer size should be discussed
further when specifications are developed.

When several non-terrestrial network scenarios feature a maximum in terms of
delay constraints, it is sufficient to study only one of these scenarios.
● NTN Scenario based on GEO with transparent payload for RTD and delay
difference constraints
● NTN Scenario based on LEO with transparent payload and moving beams for the
delay variation related constraint
As per the duplex mode:
● Down-prioritize TDD in this study item
● There is no TDD-specific timing requirements and solutions on layer 2 due to
propagation delay.

{width="7.291666666666667e-2in" height="0.16597222222222222in"} is the random
access arrival rate per second.
The random access capacity can be calculated by looking at the random access
opportunities, the collision probability supported, the frequency used for
frequent multiplexing and how many preambles that are configured for each
random access opportunities.
If we denote the maximum number of PRACH opportunities per second as
{width="8.263888888888889e-2in" height="0.16597222222222222in"}, which is
given by the PRACH configuration, such as preamble format, PRACH configuration
index as well as whether the spectrum is paired/unpaired and whether it is for
FR1 or FR2, as shown in Table 6.3.3.2-2 to Table 6.3.3.2-4 in [TS 38.211].
Furthermore the PRACH occasions may be frequency multiplexed by up to
{width="0.34305555555555556in" height="0.16597222222222222in"} different
locations in frequency for the same PRACH occasion in time. Then the _M_ as
mentioned above is computed as:
{width="1.3645833333333333in" height="0.17708333333333334in"},
Where {width="0.6347222222222222in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} is the
number of configured preambles available, where the maximum value is 64.
The number of the random access arrival rate per second supported is thus:
{width="4.936805555555556in" height="0.19791666666666666in"}
The supported user densities UE density is thus given by:
{width="3.613888888888889in" height="0.32222222222222224in"}
As an example, for PRACH configuration 27 the slots that are available in an
SFN are the slots 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 giving 1000 PRACH opportunities
per second. In the table below some more examples are given for FR1 paired:
Note that all the PRACH format used in the calculation are given as an example

###### 7.2.1.1.1.2 4-step RACH enhancements for Non-Terrestrial Networks
**Enhancement to preamble detection**
[Problem Statement]{.underline}
**In NTN, differential delay could be experienced by two UEs within the same
cell.** As a result, the preambles sent by different UEs in the same RACH
occasion (RO) may reach the network at different time. As shown in Figure
7.2.1.1.1.2-1, to make sure the network can receive preambles from all the
UEs, the preamble receiving window should start from [RO timing + minimum one
way delay * 2] and end with [RO timing +maximum one way delay * 2].
Figure 7.2.1.1.1.2-1: Preamble receiving window in NTN
When a preamble is received, the network needs to know which RO the preamble
is related to in order to estimate the accurate timing advance. If the RO
periodicity is not long enough, as shown in Figure 7.2.1.1.1.2-2, the preamble
receiving windows for two consecutive ROs maybe overlapped with each other,
making it difficult for the network to link the received preamble to the
corresponding RO.
Figure 7.2.1.1.1.2-2: Ambiguity on preamble reception at the network side
[Possible solutions:]{.underline}
1) Proper PRACH configuration in the time domain. The interval between two
consecutive RO should be larger than 2 * the maximum delay difference within
the cell.
2) Preamble division. Preambles should be divided into groups and mapped to
different RO, such that ROs with timing separation less than 2 * maximum delay
difference are always assigned with different groups of preambles.
Frequency hopping can also be studied, e.g., network uses frequency hopping of
preambles to identify the RO based on the specific frequency band in which the
preamble is received.
Solutions related to 2-step RACH can also be studied when the 2-step RACH
procedure is more stable. For the case when 2-step RACH is used, assistance
information, e.g., SFN index can be included in MsgA to help network link the
received preamble to the corresponding RO.
Based on the current specs, the ambiguity of preamble reception can only be
avoided by solution (1), i.e. proper configuration of RACH resource, in which
case the time interval between two consecutive RO is larger than the maximum
delay difference*2 within the cell.
The typical cell size and the corresponding maximum delay difference*2 are
given as follows:
Table 7.2.1.1.1.2-1: Maximum delay difference*2 for typical GEO and LEO cell
+-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+ | | Typical cell size | Maximum delay difference*2 | +-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+ | GEO | 1000 km | 6.44ms | +-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+ | | 500km | 3.26ms | +-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+ | LEO | 200 km | LEO600:1.306ms | | | | | | | | LEO1200: 1.308ms | +-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+ | | 100 km | LEO600: 0.654ms | | | | | | | | LEO1200:0.654ms | +-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+
Referring to Table 6.3.3.2-2 to Table 6.3.3.2-3 in TS 38.211, only limited
PRACH configuration can meet the requirement on RO interval at time domain,
which can significantly impact the RACH density to be supported in time
domain.
For a typical GEO cell (1000km in size), the time interval between two
consecutive RO should be larger than 6.44ms. For a typical GEO cell (500km in
size), the time interval between two consecutive RO should be larger than
3.26ms. While for a typical LEO cell (200km or 100km in size), the time
interval between two consecutive RO should be larger than 1.308ms and 0.654ms,
respectively. Examples of potential PRACH configurations for a typical GEO or
LEO cell are given as follows:
Note that all the PRACH format used in the calculation are given as an example
and it is up to RAN1 to discuss and decide the applicable PRACH format in NTN.

**Enhancement to random access response window**
_Problem Statement_
After transmitting the Random Access Preamble (Msg1), the UE monitors the
PDCCH for the Random Access Response (RAR) message (Msg2). The response window
(_ra-ResponseWindow)_ starts at a determined time interval after the preamble
transmission. If no valid response is received during the _ra-ResponseWindow_
, a new preamble is sent. If more than a certain number of preambles have been
sent, a random access problem will be indicated to upper layers. [75]
In terrestrial communications, the RAR is expected to be received by the UE
within a few milliseconds after the transmission of the corresponding
preamble. In NTN the propagation delay is much larger and therefore, so the
RAR cannot be received by the UE within the specified time interval specified
for terrestrial communications. Therefore, the behaviour of _ra-
ResponseWindow_ should be modified to support NTN.
_Possible Solution_
Introduce an offset for the start of the _ra-ResponseWindow_ for NTN. The
offset shall be configurable to accommodate different scenarios.
In addition to delaying the start of _ra-ResponseWindow, it is worth
considering whether an extension of ra-ResponseWindow is necessary to support
NTN._ In NTN the propagation delay is much larger than in terrestrial
networks. Therefore, the RAR cannot be received by the UE within the time
interval, of _ra-ResponseWindow_ , having values specific to terrestrial
networks.
For UE with location information, if the exact round trip delay can be
estimated as an offset to delay the _ra-ResponseWindow_ , there appears to be
no need for extending the _ra-ResponseWindow_.
For UE without location information, the exact round trip delay cannot be
computed to deduct the accurate offset of the _ra-ResponseWindow_.
Figure 7.2.1.1.1.2-3 illustrates a worst case in which a UE with minimum one
way transmission delay and a UE with maximum one way transmission delay (e.g.
locates at cell edge) initiate random access using the same time-frequency
resource.
{width="5.285416666666666in" height="2.946527777777778in"}
Figure 7.2.1.1.1.2-3: RAR window in NTN
Assuming the configured offset to delay the start of the RAR window equals to
2 * minimum delay and neglecting the process delay between reception of
preamble and transmission of RA Response at gNB side, it can be observed that
the RAR monitoring duration shall cover at least **2 * maximum differential
delay**. Otherwise RAR for UE will fall out of RAR window. The maximum
differential delay is defined as maximum one way delay minus minimum one way
delay. Furthermore, time flexibility is required for the NW to schedule the
RARs which means several milliseconds should be added on top of the **2 *
maximum differential delay.**
Note that the maximum differential delay within one cell is 10.3ms for GEO and
3.18ms for LEO. For GEO case, **2 * maximum differential delay = 20.6ms >
10ms. For LEO, 2 * maximum differential delay = 6.36 ms \ 1 in downlink and pusch-
AggregationFactor > 1 in the uplink) according to NR Rel.15 are possible and
might be useful to lower the residual BLER, particularly in case HARQ feedback
is disabled. Soft combining of multiple transmissions according to NR Rel.15
is supported in the receiver. Multiple transmissions of the same TB (e.g. MAC
schedules the same TB on the same HARQ process without the NDI being toggled)
are possible and might also be useful to lower the residual BLER, particularly
in case HARQ feedback is disabled. For the uplink this behaviour can be
realised within the Rel.15 specification, minor changes on the UE procedure
might be needed for the downlink transmission. Soft combining of multiple
transmissions of the same TB by the MAC scheduler (e.g. MAC schedules the same
TB on the same HARQ process without the NDI being toggled) according to NR
Rel.15 is supported in the receiver.
If the feedback is disabled for a selective number (i.e. not all) of HARQ
processes, the configuration parameters for different HARQ processes may need
to be different.
#### 7.2.1.5 Uplink scheduling
##### 7.2.1.5.1 Assignment of uplink resources
_Problem Statement_
The typical procedure when data arrives in the buffer is to trigger a Buffer
Status Report and if the UE does not have any uplink resources for
transmitting the BSR, the UE will go on to do a Scheduling Request to ask for
resources. Since the scheduling request is only an indication telling the
network that the UE requires scheduling, the network will not know the full
extent of the resources required to schedule the UE, thus first the network
may typically schedule the UE with a grant large enough to send a BSR so that
the network may schedule the UE more accordingly as seen in Figure 7.2.1.5-1.
{width="4.160416666666666in" height="2.075in"}
Figure 7.2.1.5-1: Scheduling of UE transmission
In non-terrestrial networks the drawback of this procedure is that it would
take at least 2 Round-trip times from data arriving in the buffer at the UE
side until it can be properly scheduled with resources that would fit the data
and the required QoS. Due to the large propagation delays this may become
prohibitively large.
_Possible Solutions/options_
In order to mitigate the problem there may be a number of possible solutions.
In Table 7.2.1.5-1 some different options in terms of their pros, cons and
delays have been characterized. However the feasibility of the solutions has
not been discussed in detail and will be addressed during the work item phase.

### 7.2.2 RLC
#### 7.2.2.1 Status Reporting
_Problem Statement_
A status report can be triggered by the polling procedure or by detection of
reception failure of an AMD PDU which is indicated by the expiration of
t-Reassembly. This timer is started when an AMD PDU segment is received from
lower layer, is placed in the reception buffer, at least one byte segment of
the corresponding SDU is missing and the timer is not already running. The
procedure to detect loss of RLC PDUs at lower layers by expiration of timer
t-Reassembly is used in RLC AM as well as in RLC UM. [TS 38.322] The timer
t-Reassembly can be configured by fixed values between 0 and 200ms [76]. For
the terrestrial case this timer covers the largest time interval in which the
individual segments of the corresponding SDU have to arrive out of order at
the receiver due to SDU segmentation and/or HARQ retransmissions before a
status report and consequently an ARQ-retransmission is triggered. If HARQ is
supported by NTN, an extension of the t-Reassembly timer could become
necessary, because then the timer should cover the maximum time allowed for
HARQ transmission which will probably be a value larger than the RTD.
If HARQ is supported by NTN, the timer t-Reassembly should be modified to
support NTN.
_Possible Solution_
If HARQ is supported by NTN, the value range of _t-Reassembly_ should be
extended to support NTN.
One possible solution to extend _t-Reassembly_ would be to consider the UE-
specific round-trip delay, _RTD_ , the number of allowed HARQ-retransmission
attempts _nrof_HARQ_retrans_ , as well as a configurable offset to account for
possible delays on UE and network-side, _scheduling_offset_ :
_t-Reassembly_ = _RTD_ * _nrof_HARQ_retrans_ \+ _scheduling_offset_
This would ensure that the HARQ delay can be correctly accounted for
reassembling.
No modification of the t-PollRetransmit timer and of the t-statusProhibit
timer are needed to support NTN.
#### 7.2.2.2 RLC Sequence Numbers
_Problem statement_
12bit and 18bit are specified as possible RLC AM sequence number (_SN_) field
length in NR [TS 38.322]. The maximum _AM_Window_Size_ results in 131 072.
The sequence number space needed for a radio bearer depends on the data rate
that is to be supported, the retransmission time (i.e the RTD, the number of
retransmissions and the scheduling delay) as well as the average size of the
RLC SDUs.
The basic formula for calculating the supportable RLC bit rate for one radio
bearer is
_RLC_data_rate = RLC_SDU_size_ ∙ 2 \^ (_SN_length_ -1) / _RetransmissionTime_
,
For selecting reasonable values:
● RLC_SDU_size depends entirely on the specific traffic and it is difficult to
give a good estimate for a typical SDU size. For continuous data, it is
probably more likely that the RLC SDUs are bigger rather than small. Sizes of
500 and 1500 Bytes are considered here.
● SN_length: Selecting the SN field length depends on the application, but for
continuous and high-rate applications, the SN field length should be chosen to
be large.
● RetransmissionTime: In RLC, the retransmission time of RLC SDUs is dependent
on the time that it takes for the transmitting RLC entity to retransmit an RLC
SDU when it is lost. RLC retransmissions are based on RLC status reporting and
these need to be scheduled the way any data need to be scheduled, thus the
retransmission time may be difficult to characterize. One simplification for
the retransmission time would be retransmissionTime = (RTD ∙
(maxRetxThreshold+1). With RTD = (25.77 ms, 541.46 ms) and maxRetxThreshold =
(1, 4) we get retransmission times (51.54 ms, 128.85 ms, 1082.92 ms, 2707.3
ms) which rounded up to account for scheduling delays become (75 ms, 150 ms,
1.5 s, 3.0 s).
● RTD depends on the considered scenario. In GEO satellite systems 541.46ms is
assumed as maximum RTD for the transparent architecture, while in LEO
satellite systems with transparent architecture 25.77 ms is assumed.
● maxRetxThreshold: In NTN, HARQ may be disabled and therefore retransmissions
in the RLC layer are essential for a reliable communication link.
Nevertheless, the latency as seen by the core network or the application
becomes extremely large if too many retransmissions are being configured. The
maximum number of RLC retransmissions in NTN will be limited by interactions
with higher layer and will be smaller compared to terrestrial networks. 1 or 4
RLC retransmissions are considered here.
Table 7.2.2.2-1 and Table 7.2.2.2-2 presents supportable RLC bit rates for
different sets of parameter, for GEO satellite systems and LEO satellite
systems, respectively.

* * *
Considering Table B.2-1, it is observed that the airplanes connectivity which
targets an experience data rate of 360 Mbps for DL is the most challenging
usage scenario for NTN in terms of data rate.
Assuming a retransmission time of 3.0 s or 1.5 s, which represents a GEO
satellite system with transparent architecture and an RLC SDU size of 500
Byte, the NTN targeted experience data rate for usage scenario airplanes
connectivity cannot be achieved.
Assuming a retransmission time of 150 ms, which represents a LEO satellite
system with transparent architecture and an RLC SDU size of 500 Byte or larger
the NTN targeted experience data rate can be achieved for the considered usage
scenarios.
_Possible Solution_
There are three options identified to cope with this limitation:
Option 1: The current specification is applied for NTN without any changes.
The targeted experience data rate for usage scenario airplanes connectivity
may at least temporarily not be supported for the above mentioned
configurations of RLC SDU size, RLC SN field length and maximum number of RLC
retransmissions in case of GEO satellite systems with transparent
architecture.
Option 2: Extending the RLC SN length.
Option 3: Reducing the delays that it takes to perform an RLC retransmission.
### 7.2.3 PDCP
#### 7.2.3.1 SDU Discard
_Problem Statement_
The transmitting PDCP entity shall discard the PDCP SDU when the discardTimer
expires for a PDCP SDU or when a status report confirms the successful
delivery [TS 38.322]. The discardTimer can be configured between 10 ms and
1500 ms or can be switched off by choosing infinity [76].
The discardTimer mainly reflects the QoS requirements of the packets belonging
to a service. However, by choosing the expiration time of the discardTimer or
the QoS requirements, the RTD as well as the number of retransmissions on RLC
layer and/or HARQ shall be considered. By increasing the expiration time of
discardTimer, one should keep in mind that extended timer values will increase
the amount of required memory for the buffer.
Modification of the discardTimer can be discussed in the WI phase.
#### 7.2.3.2 Reordering and In-order Delivery
_Problem Statement_
In order to detect loss of PDCP Data PDUs, there is the timer t-Reordering
which is started or reset when a PDCP SDU is delivered to upper layers [TS
38.322]. The maximum configurable expiration time is 3000 ms [76]. This might
limit the overall number of retransmissions of the RLC AM ARQ protocol for
NTN.
Modification of the t-Reordering timer can be discussed in the WI phase.
#### 7.2.3.3 PDCP Sequence Number and Window Size
_Problem statement_
12bit and 18bit are specified as possible PDCP sequence number (SN) field
length in NR [TS 38.323]. Resulting in a maximum of 262 144 different SNs or a
Window_Size of 131 072.
The sequence number space needed for a radio bearer depends on the data rate
that is to be supported, the retransmission time as well as the average size
of the PDCP SDUs.
The basic formula for calculating the supportable PDCP bit rate for one radio
bearer is
_PDCP_data_rate = PDCP_SDU_size_ ∙ 2 \^ (pdcp-_SN-Size_ -1) /
_PDCP_RetransmissionTime_ ,
For selecting reasonable values:
● PDCP_SDU_size: As the RLC_SDU_size, it depends entirely on the specific
traffic and it is difficult to give a good estimate for a typical SDU size.
For continuous data, it is probably more likely that the PDCP SDUs are bigger
rather than small. In general, PDCP packets might be larger than RLC packets
because of possible segmentation in RLC layer, however, for large data rate it
is assumed that they are in the same range as RLC_SDU_size. Sizes of 500 and
1500 Bytes are considered here.
● pdcp-SN-Size: Selecting the SN field length depends on the application, but
for continuous and high-rate applications, the SN field length should be
chosen to be large.
● PDCP_RetransmissionTime is the time seen by the PDCP layer between creation
of the packet and registration of successful or failed transmission. If HARQ
is disabled, it mainly depends on the RLC RetransmissionTime. (75ms, 150ms,
1.5s, 3.0s) are considered here. These numbers result from a round trip delay
of RTD = (25.77ms, 541.46ms) and RLC maxRetxThreshold = (1,4), see section
7.2.2.2
Table 7.2.3.3-1 and Table 7.2.3.3-2 presents supportable PDCP bit rates for
different sets of parameter, for GEO satellite systems and LEO satellite
systems, respectively.

transparent architecture

Considering Table B.2-1, it is observed that the airplanes connectivity which
targets an experience data rate of 360 Mbps for DL is the most challenging
usage scenario for NTN in terms of data rate.
Assuming a PDCP retransmission time of 3.0 s or 1.5 s, which represents a GEO
satellite system with transparent architecture and a PDCP SDU size of 500
Byte, the NTN targeted experience data rate for usage scenario airplanes
connectivity cannot be achieved.
Assuming a PDCP retransmission time of 150 ms, which represents a LEO
satellite system with transparent architecture and an RLC SDU size of 500 Byte
or larger the NTN targeted experience data rate can be achieved for the
considered usage scenarios.
_Possible Solution_
There are three options identified to cope with this limitation:
Option 1: The current specification is applied for NTN without any changes.
The targeted experience data rate for usage scenario airplanes connectivity
may at least temporarily not be supported for the above mentioned
configurations of PDCP SDU size, PDCP SN field length and maximum number of
RLC retransmissions in case of GEO satellite systems with transparent
architecture.
Option 2: Extending the PDCP SN length.
Option 3: Reducing the delays that it takes to perform retransmissions.
### 7.2.4 SDAP
The SDAP layer is responsible for the mapping between QoS flows and DRBs [9].
It is not affected by the large round trip delays (RTD) occurring in NTN.
There are no modifications needed in the SDAP layer to support non-terrestrial
networks.
## 7.3 Control plane enhancements
Satellite beams or satellites are not considered to be visible from UE
perspective in NTN. This does not preclude differentiating at the PLMN level
the type of network (e.g. NTN vs. terrestrial).
NOTE: Rel-15 definitions are considered as a baseline for NTN
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="4.538194444444445in"}
Figure 7.3-1: Options for PCI mapping into satellite beams
Both options a) same PCI for several satellite beams and b) one PCI per
satellite beam, can be considered in NTN. A satellite beam can consist of one
or more SSB beams. One cell (PCI) can have maximum of L SSB beams, where L can
be 4, 8 or 64 depending on the band.
Similar to TN, one or several SSB index can be used per PCI to separate SSB
transmission on different beams.
In TN, the mapping of antenna ports or physical beams to SSB index is left for
implementation. In NTN, the association between satellite beams and SSBs index
is left for implementation (i.e. it will not be specified).
Two different type of UE categories are supported by NTN: 1) with GNSS
support, 2) without GNSS support.
The use of satellite ephemeris, time and UE location can be used in RAN for
mobility purposes.
As per tracking area:
● For GEO, the current tracking area management is assumed as a baseline
● For LEO with moving beams study fixed and moving tracking area solutions
### 7.3.1 Idle mode mobility enhancements
#### 7.3.1.1 General Tracking Area Issues [16]
Satellites may provide very large cells, covering hundreds of kilometres, and
consequently would lead to large tracking areas. In this scenario the tracking
area updates (TAUs) are minimal, however the paging load could be high because
it then relates to the number of devices in the tracking area.
Moving cells and consequently moving tracking areas would be difficult to
manage in the network as the contrast between the TAU and the paging
signalling load would be too extreme to find a practical compromise.
On one hand, small tracking Areas would lead to massive TAU signalling for UE
at the boundary between 2 TAs as illustrated in figure 7.3.1.1-1.
{width="5.909027777777778in" height="1.9069444444444446in"}
Figure 7.3.1.1-1: Moving Cells and Small tracking Areas leading to massive TAU
signalling
On the other hand, wide tracking Areas would lead to high paging load in the
satellite beams as illustrated in Figure 7.3.1.1-2.
{width="5.904166666666667in" height="1.78125in"}
Figure 7.3.1.1-2: Moving Cells and wide tracking Areas leading to higher
Paging load
However, Tracking areas must be dimensioned to minimise the TAUs as this is
more signalling-intensive than paging on the network.
In practical tracking area design, one of the criteria affecting the
performance and capacity is the limiting capabilities of MME/AMF platforms and
the radio channel capacity.
Ping-pong effect generating excessive TAU, and it can be minimised by ensuring
10-20% overlaps between the adjacent cells and appropriate allocation of TAI
List to UEs especially at the edge of cells/TAs.
#### 7.3.1.2 Moving Tracking Area for NTN LEO, Scenario C2 and D2 [17]
Moving tracking area means that the tracking area sweeps over the ground as
the cells move. Due to high speed movement of satellite, the satellite beam
and therefore the cell providing coverage for an earth stationary UE will be
changed frequently. As a result, a stationary UE would have to keep performing
Registration area update (can also be called as tracking area update, i.e.
TAU) in RRC_IDLE state. For each Registration area update, the UE needs to
initiate connection with the network. For Rel-15 NR this requires 4-steps of
the random access procedure followed by some RRC message exchange over the
service link. This can become a non-acceptable overhead if all IDLE mode UEs
in the registration area need to perform tracking area update (TAU) frequently
as the LEO satellite passes by. If the geographical area covered by the
Registration area is large, this issue may become slightly less severe.
However, size of the Registration area and paging capacity forms a trade-off
as the UE may need to be paged via all cells belonging to the Registration
area and thus the paging capacity may become an issue when network initiated
calls arrive.
#### 7.3.1.3 Fixed Tracking Area for NTN LEO, Scenario C2 and D2 [17]
##### 7.3.1.3.1 Approach 1: For the case when UE location information is
unavailable
In order not to have TAU performed frequently by the UE triggered by the
satellite motion, the tracking area may be designed to be fixed on ground. For
NTN LEO, this implies that while the cells sweep on the ground, the tracking
area code (i.e. TAC) broadcasted is changed when the cell arrives to the area
of next planned earth fixed tracking area location.
The TAC, or a list of TACs, broadcasted by the gNB needs to be updated as the
gNB enters to the area of next planned tracking area. When the UE detects
entering a tracking area that is not in the list of tracking areas that the UE
previously registered in the network, a mobility registration update procedure
will be triggered.
Figure 7.3.1.3.1-1: An example of updating TAC and PLMN ID in real-time for
scenario C2 and D2
As shown in Figure 7.3.1.3.1-1, network update the broadcast TAC in real time
according to the ephemeris and confirm the broadcast TAC is associated with
the geographical area covered by the satellite beam. UE listens to\ TAI = PLMN
ID + TAC and determines to trigger registration area update procedure based on
the broadcast TAC and PLMN ID when it moves out of the registration area.
This approach allows to use Rel-15 NR network procedures and can be applied to
UE with or without location information.
Two possible options should be studied to update the broadcast TAC:
\"hard switch\" option: one cell broadcast only one TAC per PLMN. The new TAC
replaces the old TAC and there may be some fluctuation at the border area. As
shown in Figure 7.3.1.3.1-2, the UE will see its TAC changing like TAC-2->
TAC-1-> TAC-2 from T1 to T3.
Figure 7.3.1.3.1-2: TAC fluctuation at the border area
\"soft switch\" option: one cell can broadcast more than one TACs per PLMN.
The cell adds the new TAC in its system information in addition to the old and
removes the old a bit later. If there is a chain of TAs, the TA list adds one
TA more and removes one old while the cell sweeps the ground. This also
reduces the amount of TAUs for UEs that happen to be located at the border
area. However, for the \"soft switch\" option, the more TACs a cell broadcast,
the heavier paging load it experiences, which usually leads to a significant
imbalance distribution of paging load among cells. Thus, there is a trade-off
between paging load and balancing the fluctuation of actual TA area enabled by
the soft switch to be considered in network planning and implementation.
In some area, the gNB may not be able to provide NTN service and thus not
broadcast TAC(s).
##### 7.3.1.3.2 Approach 2: For the case when UE location information is
available
One possible solution is to divide the earth into a lot of geographical areas
and each geographical area is mapped to a certain TAC. During initial
registration, UE derives the TAC based on its location information (the
mapping rule between the geographical area and the TAC value is kept both on
UE side and network side), forms the TAI based on the derived TAC and
broadcast PLMN ID and reports the TAI to network via Registration Request
message. The AMF confirms the reported TAI and includes a TAI list as a
registration area the UE is registered to in the Registration Accept message.
When UE moves to a new geographical area, UE derives the TAC based on the
location information and forms the TAI based on the derived TAC and PLMN ID.
If UE detects entering a tracking area that is not in the list of tracking
areas that the UE previously registered to, a mobility registration update
procedure will be triggered. UE reports the TAI derived by itself to network
via Registration Request message. The AMF confirms the reported TAI and
include a new TAI list for the UE in the Registration Accept message. The UE,
upon receiving a Registration Accept message, shall delete its old TAI list
and store the received TAI list.
##### 7.3.1.3.3 Tracking Area recommendation
Fixed Tracking Area is recommended for the WI phase
#### 7.3.1.4 Enhancements to idle/inactive UE mobility procedure
For the idle/inactive mode UE procedures in NTN, NR mechanism in TN system is
regarded as the baseline. Regarding the adaptation of existing procedures,
followings issues were considered.
● For too frequent SI update issue, no problematic case was identified. This
issue can be solved by network implementation.
● Under earth-fixed tracking area mechanism, cells sweeping the Earth do not
cause heavy signalling burden because of frequent TAU for the LEO satellites.
● For UEs with low transmission power camping on the cell with high altitude
issue, if UE is able to identify GEO cell, it can be left for UE
implementation to avoid this issue and no additional mechanism is needed.
#### 7.3.1.5 Mobility state estimation mechanism
For GEO satellites, the cell coverage is very large so that UE\'s mobility
will happen very rare. For LEO satellites, the UE\'s speed can be ignored
compared to the speed of LEO satellites. Therefore, as use case of MSE is not
clear in both GEO and LEO case, the MSE mechanism for NTN usage is left for
implementation decision.
#### 7.3.1.6 Using ephemeris information and UE location information
Ephemeris information and UE location information can be used to help UEs
perform measurement and cell selection/reselection, in addition to PCI and
frequency information included in the broadcast system information. How to
deliver and utilize the information can be defined in the WI phase.
#### 7.3.1.7 System information broadcast
As LEO satellites are moving in predictable path, so their neighbour cell list
is also predictable. The neighbour cell list can be provided via broadcast
system information, as is currently done in NR.
### 7.3.2 Connected mode mobility enhancements
For GEO NTN, mobility management procedures require adaptations to accommodate
large propagation delay. In particular radio link management may require
specific configuration.
For LEO NTN, mobility management procedures should be enhanced to take into
account satellite movement related aspects such as measurement validity, UE
velocity, movement direction, large and varying propagation delay and dynamic
neighbour cell set.
#### 7.3.2.1 Mobility Challenges for Non-Terrestrial Networks
##### 7.3.2.1.1 Latency associated with mobility signalling
Propagation delay in NTN is orders of magnitude higher than terrestrial
systems, introducing additional latency to mobility signalling such as
measurement reporting, reception of the HO command, and HO request/ACK (if the
target cell originates from a different satellite).
The basic handover procedure is illustrated in Figure 7.3.2.1.1-1, and the
processing delay in both gNB side and UE side are marked.
Figure 7.3.2.1.1-1: Handover procedure
The service interruption time is defined in TR 36.881 by the time between when
the UE stops transmission/reception with the source gNB and the time when
target gNB resumes transmission/reception. The interruption time is however
different regarding to uplink and downlink.
For the downlink the interruption time can be defined as the time from network
sending RRCReconfiguration with sync (Step 3) until the target gNB receives
the RRCReconfigurationComplete (Step 6). Since the gNB cannot send more data
after step 3, and it can continue after it receives
RRCReconfigurationComplete. For the uplink, the UE can potentially continue
sending data to the source gNB until RRCReconfiguration with sync is received,
the interruption time can be defined as the time from UE receiving
RRCReconfiguration with sync (Step 3) until the target gNB receives the
RRCReconfigurationComplete (Step 6).
Without considering latencies such as RRC processing delay and UE retuning its
frequency circuits (which is smaller than the RTT), the interruption time
would be 2 RTT (about 1080ms) for downlink and 1.5 RTT (about 810ms) for
uplink.
GEO scenarios are characterized by much larger propagation delay than LEO,
however the latter requires consideration of satellite movement. To avoid
extended service interruption, latency associated with mobility signalling
should be addressed with high priority in both cases. Solutions developed may
apply to both scenarios.
NOTE: Although such latency may result in a service interruption, it does not
necessarily mean the UE will miss the HO command.
##### 7.3.2.1.2 Measurement Validity
Extending Rel-15 measurement-based mobility mechanisms to NTN may introduce
the risk of outdated measurements given sufficient delay between transmission
of the measurement report and reception of the HO command. The measurements
may no longer be valid, possibly leading to an incorrect mobility action e.g.
early/late handover.
Although LEO scenarios exhibit less propagation delay, satellite movement may
have an impact on measurement validity. Satellite ephemeris and/or UE location
may be beneficial in addressing this challenge.
Measurement validity is not anticipated to be a challenge in GEO scenarios
given the large cell size/overlap, small signal variation, and relatively low
UE mobility. GEO scenarios may thus be addressed by suitable configuration
using exiting Rel-15 mechanisms.
##### 7.3.2.1.3 Cell overlap and reduced signal strength variation
In terrestrial systems, a UE can determine it is near a cell edge due to a
clear difference in RSRP as compared to cell center. Such an effect may not be
as pronounced in non-terrestrial deployments, resulting in a small difference
in signal strength between two beams in a region of overlap. As the Rel-15
handover mechanism is based on measurement events (e.g. A3), the UE may thus
have difficulty distinguishing the better cell.
{width="3.4145833333333333in" height="2.015972222222222in"}
Figure 7.3.2.1.3-1: A sketch of near-far effect in different scenarios: (a)
Terrestrial Network; (b) NTN
To avoid an overall reduction in HO robustness due to the UE ping-ponging
between cells, this challenge should be addressed with high priority for both
GEO and LEO scenarios.
Location information and/or satellite ephemeris would be useful in addition to
measurement results, and solutions may apply to both scenarios.
##### 7.3.2.1.4 Frequent and unavoidable handover
Satellites in non-GEO orbits move with high speed relative to a fixed position
on earth, leading to frequent and unavoidable handover for both stationary and
moving UEs. This may result in significant signalling overhead and impact
power consumption, as well as exacerbating other potential challenges related
to mobility e.g. service interruption due to signalling latency.
For a UE travelling at a constant speed and direction, the maximum time it can
remain connected to a cell is approximated by dividing the cell diameter by UE
speed. For NTN LEO deployments, the cell size is divided by the relative speed
between the satellite and the UE, where a UE moving in the same direction as
the satellite subtracts from the relative speed, and a UE moving in the
opposite direction increases relative speed, described by the equation below:
{width="4.276388888888889in" height="0.5263888888888889in"}
The scenario of cell diameter = one 50 km diameter beam will represent the
lower bound (i.e. worst-case scenario for HO frequency), and cell diameter =
1000 km will be taken as the upper bound (i.e. best-case scenario for HO
frequency).
Substituting reference values from 4.2-2 and 7.1-1 into the above equation,
the maximum time a UE can remain in an NTN cell (i.e. the UE connects
immediately at cell edge and leaves at the opposite cell edge) for the min/max
cell diameter and relative speed is listed in the table below:
Table 7.3.2.1.4-1: Time to HO for min/max cell diameter and varying UE speed
* * *
Cell Diameter Size (km) UE Speed (km/hr) Satellite Speed (km/s) Time to HO (s)
50 (lower bound) +500 7.56 (NOTE 1) 6.49 -500 6.74 +1200 6.33 \- 1200 6.92
Neglected 6.61 1000 (upper bound) +500 129.89 -500 134.75 +1200 126.69 \- 1200
138.38 Neglected 132.28
* * *
Neglecting UE movement, a UE served by an NTN LEO cell of diameter 50 km and
1000 km may remained connected for a maximum of 6.61 seconds and 132.38
seconds respectively due to satellite movement. Considering UE movement, this
will vary by approximately +/- 4%. By neglecting satellite speed and setting
UE speed to 500 km/hr as per table 7.1-1, this is equivalent to a terrestrial
UE being served by a cell diameter ranging from approximately 0.918 km (NOTE
2) to 18.39 km.
From the above analysis, it is concluded that HO frequency in LEO NTN can be
similar to that experienced by a terrestrial UE on a high-speed train, however
this represents a worst-case scenario and is not indicative of a typical
terrestrial network. It is not anticipated that frequent HO will occur in GEO
due to large cell size limiting the impact of UE speed. It is further assumed
in LEO scenarios UE speed is a negligible factor in HO frequency given the
relative speed of the satellite, and this will principally be an issue for LEO
with moving beams.
NOTE 1: This value may need to be updated further pending clarification from
satellite companies (e.g. if this is the ground speed, and what altitude this
value corresponds to).
NOTE 2: it is assumed that this is the minimum cell diameter possible (i.e.
the UE travels directly through the full cell diameter). Should the UE only
travel through an edge portion of the coverage the cell must be larger.
##### 7.3.2.1.5 Dynamic neighbour cell set
In non-GEO deployments satellites constantly move with respect to a fixed
point on earth. Such movement may have several implications to the UE, such as
how long a candidate cell will remain valid.
Given the deterministic movement of satellites in LEO, the network may be able
to compensate for the changing cell set via existing Rel-15 mechanisms,
possibly with the aid of UE location.
As GEO satellites are relatively static, dynamic neighbour cell set is not
anticipated to be a challenge.
[NOTE: Enhancements, if developed, should be coordinated with cell
selection/re-selection in the IDLE/INACTIVE section]
##### 7.3.2.1.6 Handover for a large number of UEs
Considering the large cell size of non-terrestrial networks, many devices may
be served within a single cell. Depending on constellation assumptions (e.g.
propagation delay and satellite speed) and UE density, a potentially very
large number of UEs may need to perform HO at a given time, leading to
possibly large signalling overhead and service continuity challenges.
Though the actual number of UEs performing HO at a given time will vary based
on UE density, a general approximation can be made by observing the time it
takes for the cell to move completely out of the original footprint (\"c)\" in
Figure 7.3.2.1.6-1), at which point all UEs served in the cell at time T
(\"a)\") must be handed over to a new cell. Dividing the total number of
connected UEs by the time it takes for the cell to perform this transition can
thus provide a general approximation of the average rate UEs must hand-out of
a cell for a given cell diameter.
{width="6.498611111111111in" height="1.770138888888889in"}
Figure 7.3.2.1.6-1: Transition of UEs as a cell moves completely out of
original coverage area
However, as UEs are \"handing-out\" from the area no longer served by the
cell, other UEs are also \"handing-in\" from the new area of coverage (as
shown in \"b)\"). Assuming for simplicity a relatively uniform distribution of
UEs, the rate of UEs leaving the cell will be approximately equal to the rate
of UEs entering the cell. Therefore, the total mobility for the cell (hand-in
+ hand-out) will be approximately 2x the rate of hand-out.

For the values provided in Table 7.3.2.1.6-1, the maximum number of UEs
possible with the current maximum C-RNTI value (i.e. 65519) (NOTE 1) will
remain connected to the cell at all times (e.g. the rate of UEs leaving a cell
is equal to the rate of UEs entering a cell) to estimate the worst-case
scenario, and UE movement is neglected.

It is anticipated that the continuous movement of satellites in LEO scenarios
with moving beams is the main challenge to be addressed with priority, and
that the GEO scenario will not be greatly affected due to the large cell
size/overlap and low relative UE speed.
NOTE 1: The above analysis assumes the current maximum C-RNTI value (i.e.
65519 connected UEs). This analysis may be updated should the C-RNTI value be
modified in NTN (e.g. to accommodate higher average UE densities for large
cell diameters).
NOTE 2: This value may need to be updated further pending clarification from
satellite companies (e.g. if this is the satellite speed on the ground, and
what altitude this value corresponds to).
FFS: An analysis of \"Peak HO rate\" e.g. should the satellite move over a
small area with many UEs, and how the HO rate would change considering
steerable satellite beams.
##### 7.3.2.1.7 Impact of Propagation Delay Difference on Measurements
Consider a UE served by a LEO satellite S1, however also within coverage of an
incoming LEO satellite S2. The UE should perform measurements of the
neighbouring cells originating from S2 for mobility purposes based on the
measurement configuration provided to the UE, however the propagation delay
difference from the UE to satellite S1 and the UE to satellite S2 may vary
significantly.
If the SMTC measurement gap configuration does not consider the propagation
delay difference, the UE may miss the SSB/CSI-RS measurement window and will
thus be unable to perform measurements on the configured reference signals.
This challenge is captured for both GEO and LEO scenarios, and is to be
addressed with priority for LEO scenarios.
FFS: The scale of this problem in GEO given the stationary nature of GEO
satellites.
#### 7.3.2.2 Mobility Enhancements for Non-Terrestrial Networks
##### 7.3.2.2.1 Enhancements to Measurement Configuration/Reporting
● Conditional triggering of measurement reporting: The triggering of
measurement reporting can be based on UE location. This may be based on UE
location vs a reference location, or a combination of location and RSRP/RSRQ.
● Inclusion of location information in the measurement report: Location
information may be piggy backed onto the measurement report to provide the
network additional information when determining whether to HO. Additional
design considerations (e.g. signalling overhead impacts and potential privacy
concerns) can be addressed in a work item phase.
● Network compensation of propagation delay difference between satellites: The
network can compensate for propagation delay differences in the UE measurement
window, e.g. via system information, or in a UE specific manner via dedicated
signalling. Other solutions to this issue are not precluded.
##### 7.3.2.2.2 Conditional Handover
● Measurement-based triggering: Agreements in the mobility enhancements WI are
to be taken as baseline. Configuration of triggering thresholds and/or which
measurement events to use as triggers should consider the NTN environment e.g.
the small variation of the cell quality measured in cell center and at cell
edge in NTN.
● Location (UE and Satellite) triggering: additional triggering conditions
based on UE and satellite location can be considered in NTN and may be
considered independently or jointly with another trigger (e.g. measurement
based). Location-based conditional HO in LEO scenarios should consider
deterministic satellite movement. For example, the location triggering
condition may be expressed as distance between the UE and the satellite.
● Time(r)-based triggering: Several triggering conditions considering the time
a region is served can be considered. This may be based on UTC time, or a
timer-based solution, and may be considered independently or jointly with
another trigger (e.g. measurement based). Time-based conditional HO in LEO
scenarios should consider deterministic satellite movement.
● Timing advance value based triggering: additional triggering conditions
based on timing advance value to the target cell can be considered in NTN and
may be considered independently or jointly with another trigger.
● Elevation angles of source and target cells based triggering: additional
triggering conditions based on elevation angles of source and target cells can
be considered in NTN and may be considered independently or jointly with

##### 7.3.2.2.3 Mobility Configuration
Broadcast configuration: common signalling in the HO configuration (e.g. T304
and spCellConfigCommon) can be broadcast, possibly via SIB. Although some
mobility information common to all UEs may be broadcast, further evaluation on
impact to signalling overhead is required given HO command is UE specific and
requires dedicated signalling.
The following criteria can to be used as baseline to evaluate the
impact/benefit of broadcast signalling:
1) Will enough UEs share the same value of common signalling to justify
broadcasting values vs. dedicated signalling?
2) Will these values remain valid for long enough such that they will not
require frequent modification (either via dedicated signalling or updated
broadcast message) thus reducing signalling overhead savings?
3) How long will it take for the UE to receive the minimum required
information for NTN access?
Further analysis may be performed to identify other possible signalling
applicable to broadcast transmission (e.g. common delay, other parameters of
the RRCReconfiguration message), whether certain areas of the network are more
suitable to broadcast signalling (e.g. at the edge of coverage between
terrestrial and non-terrestrial), or whether typical HO configurations
(possibly with additional delta configuration) can be provided via an index.
All signalling between the UE, source, and target gNB should be considered in
evaluation.
#### 7.3.2.3 Connected mode mobility for feeder link switch for LEO NTN [18]
Connected mode mobility for feeder link switch, or due to interface change,
from the network perspective is captured in Sections 8. 6 and 8.7. From Uu
perspective, there is difference between Architecture Option 1 that is
transparent payload and Architecture Options 2-5 (listed in Section 8.7.1)
that are regenerative payload. For further details, see Sec. 8.3.1.
#### 7.3.2.4 Connected mode mobility assumptions
RAN2 will prioritize analysis of mobility challenges/enhancements for
transparent GEO (A) and LEO with moving beam (C2, D2) architectures during the
study item phase.
NOTE 1: Only cell level mobility is considered from a RAN2 perspective
NOTE 2: Additional scenarios may be considered pending outcome of NTN study in
RAN1.
### 7.3.3 Paging issue
#### 7.3.3.1 Paging Capacity
Following parameters should be considered for calculation of paging capacity
\- Paging Frames (PF) per second: {width="0.23958333333333334in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}
\- Paging Occasions (PO) per PF: {width="0.5833333333333334in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}
\- Maximum number of paging records in paging message: {width="0.59375in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}
\- User density (UEs/km^2^)
\- Satellite beam diameter: in km
\- NO_Traffic: fraction of UEs in the cell with network originated traffic
\- Arrival session or call rate: average requested paging occasions per hour
and per UE
\- Number of cells in per tracking area: M
##### 7.3.3.1.1 Paging capacity of non-multibeam cell
In a non-multibeam scenario 4 out of 10 subframes per PF can be used for
paging that is there can be at most 4 PO per PF. A paging message can only be
sent in a PO. The paging message can at most include 32 paging records in the
paging message where each paging record includes the UE identities of the UEs
being paged. The theoretical paging capacity as maximum number of UEs paged
per second in an NR non-multibeam cell is thus limited by:
{width="4.030555555555556in" height="0.17708333333333334in"}.
As each RF can be configured to be a PF, the resulting maximum paging capacity
with 100 PF per second is thus {width="0.78125in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"} PO per second. This implies that
theoretically, an NR cell can page {width="1.0208333333333333in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"} UEs per second, or equivalently, more than 46
Million UEs per hour {width="1.0520833333333333in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"}.
The supported paging capacity should be compared with the required paging per
cell, which can be calculated as:\ {width="4.738888888888889in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}
If the tracking area is larger than one cell and the base station needs to
blindly page all the UEs that it want to reach in all cells, then in the worst
case the required arrival rate would be:
{width="4.947222222222222in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}
The paging capacity should also be considered together with the cell\'s
capacity to support UEs accessing the cell. After being paged, the UE accesses
the cell using a random-access procedure which starts by the UE transmitting a
random-access preamble on the physical random-access channel (PRACH). PRACH
capacity is calculated in Section X.
##### 7.3.3.1.2 Example of calculation
Given the cell area of a hexagonal cell has a radius of r as in Figure 1, the
cell area can be expressed as {width="1.8125in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"}. If the cell area is an ellipsoid the area can
be expressed as {width="0.8333333333333334in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}.
For example, for the cell radius of r = 250km, the area is A = 163 000km^2^.
{width="4.427083333333333in" height="2.7333333333333334in"}

Some examples of the paging channel load which is calculated as
{width="4.728472222222222in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} can be seen in
Table 7.3.3.1-1 with different deployments.

density

Furthermore the supported UE density given the UE arrival session rate per UE,
which is highly dependent on the size of the beam, can be calculated by:
{width="2.8222222222222224in" height="0.3125in"}

1 per 24 hours 1 250 \~6780
* * *
One can also compare the paging capacity requirements scale with the TA size
and different arrival rates, in the worst case considering that UE does not
know where any of the UEs are located and thus pages the same IDs across the
whole tracking area:
{width="4.395138888888889in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}
In the Figure 7.3.3-2 and Figure 7.3.3-3 the required paging capacity is shown
if the cell is circular with a radius of 200 km and 500 km, the UE density is
620 UE/km^2^, and arrival session rate is 1/24*x, where x is 0.2 and 0.5
leading to arrival session rate of 0.008 and 0.021.

### 7.3.5 PLMN identities deployment
Deployment of PLMNs with specific PLMN IDs for NTN cells and TN cells, or
between different type of NTN platforms (GEO or LEO), is considered as a
preferred option, however the configuration of common PLMN identities is not
precluded.
### 7.3.6 Ephemeris Data for NTN
#### 7.3.6.1 Representation of Complete Ephemeris Data
Ephemeris data contains the information about the orbital trajectories of
artificial satellites as described in Annex A. There are different possible
representations of ephemeris data. One possibility is to use orbital
parameters, e.g. semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right ascension
of the ascending node, argument of periapsis, mean anomaly at a reference
point in time, and the epoch. The first five parameters can determine an
orbital plane, and the other two parameters are used to determine exact
satellite location at a time. A description table for the orbital parameters
and the corresponding illustrations are as below.

NOTE: True anomaly is the actual measured angle in the orbital plane between
the vector extending from the focus to the point of periapsis and the vector
extending from the focus to the object\'s actual position. Mean anomaly is the
angle between the periapsis point and the imagined position of an object for
the same elapsed time since periapsis for a circular orbit around the same
body with the same orbital position. The key difference is that mean anomaly
always increases linearly with time. The true anomaly, in general, does not,
except if the orbital is circular, in which case the mean anomaly and true
anomaly are almost identical. True and mean anomaly can be linked together
thanks to the eccentric anomaly.

Figure 7.3.6-1: Satellite Orbit and Keplerian Elements
Another possible option is to provide the location of the satellite in
coordinates (x, y, z), e.g. ECEF coordinates. For anything else than GEO,
additionally a velocity vector (vx, vy, vz) and again a reference point in
time are needed.
NOTE::It seems that this option has the drawback that -- for LEO satellites --
it prevents the UE from extrapolating the satellite track for more than a very
short time into the future. Since a LEO satellite moves very fast, the given
position (x, y, z) may be outdated in a short period of time. And since the
satellite moves in an elliptical orbit, providing a velocity vector (vx, vy,
vz) does not help much; so it remains to be studied the required accuracy --to
determine the satellite location with acceptable precision. As a result, the
satellite would need to provide (e.g. broadcast) an updated location very
often, about every few minutes. Furthermore, for the same reason it is unclear
how to pre-provision a UE with ephemeris information in coordinates.
#### 7.3.6.2 Provision and Use of Ephemeris Data
In all cases, the minimum representation needs at least seven double-precision
floating point numbers, plus some overhead. This means that, for satellite
networks with many satellites, the ephemeris data can be quite substantial.
The exact data size for a LEO network depends on the number of satellites,
which may be several hundreds, and the accuracy of which the ephemeris
parameters are represented.
In a satellite network, the orbits of all satellites are however not
independent, as several satellites typically share a common orbital plane. To
reduce the amount of data needed, the ephemeris data could provide information
not for every single satellite, but only for the common orbital planes. Even
for a network with 100 orbital planes, the ephemeris data would then amount to
only a few kB. The ephemeris data may be provisioned a file containing the
ephemeris data in the uSIM of the UE or directly in UE itself.
As mentioned above, the size of the ephemeris data can be quite substantial
for networks with many satellites, and easily exceeds the capacity of a uSIM
which is one way for pre-provisioning the ephemeris data, which typically is
128 kB. The ephemeris data file on the uSIM may thus contain only information
about the orbital planes. In this case, the ephemeris data would not provide
the location of a specific satellite but describe an arc in the sky above the
UE which the UE would need to scan for a satellite. According to the
definitions of orbital parameters, the first five parameters, i.e. semi-major
axis, eccentricity, inclination, right ascension of the ascending node,
argument of periapsis, are used to determine the elliptical orbit. So these
parameters can be provisioned to UE as baseline ephemeris data.
These baseline ephemeris data or orbital planes may be indexed and further
quantized and sub-indexed. The indexes can then be used in RRC in an efficient
way to point to stored ephemeris data. The UE can be given information about
ephemeris data of other cells by using the ephemeris plane information. For
example, when a UE is asked to do RRM measurements, the UE is given the index
of the orbital plane where the cell to be measured can be found.
With the help of ephemeris data, a UE may search for the first NTN cell it
could connect to. After detecting PSS/SSS (SSB) of a cell broadcasted by a
satellite, the UE may be able to read the initial system information of that
cell. Ideally, before attempting to access the cell, the UE knows the RTT well
enough to be able to do random access. For this, the initial system
information may need to contain further ephemeris information on the exact
location of the cell (or the satellite broadcasting the cell). This
information can be given with respect to the orbital plane that the UE already
has information about.
Considering that the orbit-plane level orbital parameters are not sufficient
to derive the satellite position while the satellite level orbital parameters
is more helpful for UE to search for the first NTN cell and perform initial
access, it is worthwhile evaluating some other solutions to provide satellite
level orbital parameters. In addition to the first five orbital parameters for
orbital plane, the other two orbital parameters including mean anomaly at a
reference point in time and the epoch are used to determine the exact
satellite location at a time.
As mentioned above, the main concern for proving the satellite level orbital
parameters is about the size of such information. However, there is no need
for a UE to store orbital parameters for all the satellites. If the orbital
parameters per satellite are pre-provisioned, UE only needs to store the
ephemeris data for the satellites that may serve UE Another possible solution
to address the size concern of the satellite level orbital parameters is to
broadcast the orbital parameters of the serving satellite and several
neighbouring satellites which will be sufficient for initial access and
mobility handling at UE side. Thus, the following solutions can be considered
to provide orbital parameters per satellite:
● Pre-provision satellite level orbital parameters for all the satellites that
may serve the UE in uSIM/UE and the ephemeris data for each satellite can be
linked to a satellite ID or index. Broadcast the satellite ID or index of the
serving satellite in system information so that UE is able to find the
corresponding detailed ephemeris data stored in uSIM to derive the position
coordinates of the serving satellite. The satellite ID or index of neighbour
satellites can also be provided to UE via system information or dedicated RRC
signalling to assist mobility handling.
● Broadcast satellite level orbital parameters of the serving satellite in
system information and UE will derive the position coordinates of the serving
satellite. The ephemeris data of the neighbouring satellites can also be
provided to UE via system information or dedicated RRC signalling.. In case
the baseline orbital plane parameters are provisioned in uSIM/UE, only mean
anomaly at a reference point in time and the epoch need to be broadcasted to
UE, in this way signalling overhead can be reduced significantly.
#### 7.3.6.3 Updating Stored Ephemeris Data
For the solutions in which the orbital parameters for the common orbit planes
or for all the satellites that may serve the UE are pre-provisioned, the
accuracy of the prediction of a satellite orbit or the satellite position
decreases the further in the future one tries to extend the prediction. It
might thus be needed to update the ephemeris data stored in the UE. The
validity time of stored ephemeris data might depend on the orbital parameters
of the NTN satellite, and on the required accuracy of its prediction. Since
the validity time determines the frequency of the updates, it should be
studied further.
The main purpose of the ephemeris data provided by network is to provide the
UE with ephemeris data for initial access, e.g. if it is expected to be
switched off for a longer time; or in other words, as a replacement for the
data stored in the UE. As such, it may also contain information on orbital
plane level or on satellite level.
The UE should always use the most current ephemeris data. Once the UE has
obtained new ephemeris data, the parameters stored in the UE are thus obsolete
and should no longer be used or be overwritten with the newer values. Every
parameter in the UE has an associated priority statement. By giving the
parameters in the UE lower priority, the UE can be prevented from using the
obsolete values stored in the UE.
## 7.4 Earth fixed cells vs Earth moving cells
Compared to LEO based Earth moving cells scenario where cells are moving on
the ground, LEO based Earth fixed cells scenario refer to NTN that provide
cells fixed with respect to a certain location on the Earth during a certain
time duration. This can be achieved with NTN platforms generating steerable
beams which footprint is fixed on the ground.
The same solutions identified for Earth moving cell scenario can also be
applied for Earth fixed cell scenario, however whether specific solutions are
necessary (or preferred) for each scenario can be further evaluated in the
normative phase (See [74]).
# 8 Issues and related solutions for NG-RAN architecture and interface
protocols
## 8.1 Tracking area management
The concept of Registration and Tracking areas pertains in the context of Non-
Terrestrial networks, and is similar to NR based cellular system in following
aspects:
● a tracking area corresponds to a fixed geographical area.
● tracking areas (TA) is utilized for UE access control, location
registration, paging and mobility management.
● a registration area encompasses one or several tracking areas.
The objective is to track the UE, in order to minimize the use of radio
resources for paging.
### 8.1.1 NTN cells are fixed w.r.t the ground
For scenarios A, B, C1 and D1, the NTN cells are fixed on the ground. Hence a
tracking area may correspond to one or several NTN cells. The 3GPP-defined
tracking area management and paging procedures can apply as is. In case of C1
and D1, the LEO satellites generate beams with temporary Earth fixed
footprints. In other words, the beam footprints are stationary over a given
NTN cell on ground for a certain amount of time before they change their focus
area over another NTN cell. It is possible the assign each NTN cell to a
tracking area. This requires the satellite to change the broadcasted tracking
area code between two successive NTN cells covered.
NOTE 1: For scenarios C1, the TA list and paging messages could be sent by the
same gNB to the NTN cell via all satellites covering this NTN cell.
NOTE 2: For scenarios D1, the TA list and paging messages could be sent by the
gNB on board all satellites covering this NTN cell.
### 8.1.2 NTN cells are moving w.r.t the ground
For scenarios C2 and D2, the NTN cells move on the ground as the satellites
move on their orbital planes. This requires some adaptations to the TA
management and paging procedure.
Hence we shall focus the study on scenario C2 and D2 for the idle/inactive
mode mobility.
It is worth noting that, as long as the TA is always uniquely coupled with the
relevant cell(s), it may still be possible to apply legacy core network
procedures (e.g. paging) even to a moving TA. In such case, however, it seems
beneficial to differentiate such a TA from a fixed / \"non-NTN\" TA. In
principle, this could be done by reserving a range of identifier(s) for TAs
associated with NTN moving cells. However, this might restrict the possible TA
address space and might not be desirable from the operator\'s point of view.
Another alternative would be to extend the TAC IE signalled over NGAP and XnAP
with a TA Type IE, defined as e.g. ENUMERATED (NTN, NTN with moving cells,
...) so that the receiving node can identify that the cells associated with
this TA are related to a NTN, and/or are not stationary with respect to the
ground. Alternatively, this indication may be at cell level or gNB level.
The non-terrestrial and terrestrial networks could be assigned either same or
different PLMNs.
● In case of two different PLMNs for terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks,
both tracking area layouts can be independently defined preventing overlaps
between tracking areas of a given layout. This would be in line with the
current definition of TAs.
● In case of a shared PLMN, the operator is responsible for defining tracking
areas and assigning the TAIs to be used by the terrestrial network, and to be
used by the non-terrestrial network. Overlapping between these tracking areas
are possible.
The main idea is to decouple the TA management from the NTN cell pattern. In
that case, registration and tracking areas are arbitrary geographical areas
defined by the operator. (FFS)
It is assumed that not all UEs are capable of positioning.
The following applies to scenarios C2 and D2.
#### 8.1.2.1 Tracking Area defined on satellite
In this option, a NTN cell only have one TAI per PLMN ID, i.e. same as
terrestrial cell. This also allows the gNB to reuse current NGAP procedure,
i.e. the INITIAL UE MESSAGE contains one TAI of the serving cell.
In Scenario C2 and D2, when the LEO satellite moves, the coverage of the TAI
also changes. A stationary UE may see the TAI keeps changing. Some solutions
were described in the Section 8.3. Similar issue is also discussed in SA2, and
the related proposals are also captured in SA2 TR23.737, Solution #7.
#### 8.1.2.2 Tracking Area defined on earth
In this option, it keeps the principle that the TAI is related to a specific
geographical area, but a NTN cell may have to broadcast multiple TAIs per PLMN
ID, which does not align with the principle that a cell only have one TAI per
PLMN ID.
When the NTN cell covers multiple Tracking Areas (either fully, or partially),
the NTN cell will broadcast all related TAIs. From a UE perspective, the UE
recognizes the Tracking Area by the TAI broadcasted over the air. The
\"observed\" Tracking Area by the UE keeps changing. The following aspects
need to be further considered.
Which TAI is to be provided to CN on NG interface?
During the Initial UE Message procedure, the UE\'s location, i.e. TAI+CGI, is
provided to the CN. When a NTN cell broadcast multiple TAIs, one option is
provide all TAIs to the AMF. The AMF may have difficulty to provide an
effective Registration Area to the UE. The other option is to only provide one
TAI to the AMF. The gNB need to determine which TAI is to be provided to the
AMF when a NTN cell broadcast multiple TAIs.
How to enforce a regional/country policy?
If UE\'s location can be determined during (or before) the registration
procedure, the NG-RAN node provide the UE\'s location to the network during
the registration, and the regional/country policy will be enforced. Otherwise,
as soon as the UE enters in connected mode, the network will be able to
determine its location and regional/country policy will be enforced.
## 8.2 Registration Update and Paging Handling
In Non-Terrestrial non-GEO Network, the satellites moves across the
geographical area of interest, its antenna beams will cover different portions
of that area.
In a NTN beam with a foot print moving on earth, a fixed association between
the non-GEO NTN beam and TAI would lead to moving TAIs on ground. In
terrestrial RANs the geographical area for tracking the UE, also called
Tracking Area (TA) is associated to the TAI broadcasted by the RAN.
As in the terrestrial RAN, there is no one-to-one correspondence between
moving NTN beams and geo-area on Earth, i.e., the TAIs broadcasted by the Non-
GEO satellite will sweep over Earth. A stationary UE will see different NTN
beams/TAIs over the time. With current Registration Update procedure, the
stationary UE has to keep performing Registration Updates upon the change of
NTN beam. This brings a challenge to current Registration Update and Paging.
In the following, we study possible solutions based on whether the UE can
determine its location or not.
### 8.2.1 Option 1: UE is capable to determine its location
In the following it is assumed that the UE has the capability to determine its
location (e.g. by GNSS). In this case the satellite can page the UE based on
UE\'s location information.
In terrestrial network, the AMF is in charge of mapping a tracking area where
the UE is located to determine the list of gNBs that pages the UE. In NTN, one
can use the UE location to do an equivalent mapping and determine the list of
gNBs that page the UE.
The mapping could be made in the AMF. For this, the AMF is made aware of UE
location, along with some assistance information, e.g. UE type or UE speed
information. AMF has also to be aware of satellite ephemeris.
Alternatively, this mapping could be made in the RAN. When a UE has to be
paged, the AMF determines the RAN access node(s) where to send the paging
message from the TAI as usual. The NTN based NG- RAN can then select the
satellite beams where to broadcast the paging from its knowledge of UE last
location and satellites ephemeris. However this raises several issues as
paging failure coordination between RAN and CN and Idle UE context management
in RAN, and would require further studies.
#### 8.2.1.1 Mapping of UE location to gNB list in the AMF
The example procedure for UE location based paging could be illustrated by the
figure below:
Figure 8.2.1.1-1: UE location based paging (example)
● Step 1: UE report the location info to gNB1, the report may also include
some assistance info such as UE type, speed info, more details need to be
further studied.
● Step 2: Upon receiving of the UE location report, gNB1 forwards the location
info and the assistance info if have to AMF.
● Step 3: AMF stores the UE location info, the assistance info if any, and
also the corresponding time stamp. The information is kept in AMF when UE is
released to Idle.
● Step 4: When AMF wants to page the UE, it selects the gNB(s) which could
cover the UE location according to the stored info and ephemeris.
● Step 5: AMF sends the Paging message to the selected gNB(s), including the
location info and the assistance info if any. Upon reception of the Paging
message, the gNB may decide which satellite(s) or beam(s) to be paged and page
the UE accordingly.
NOTE: If the location based paging is failed, AMF may extend the paging area
and re-send the UE according to its paging policy, e.g. re-send the paging in
the whole registration area of the UE.
### 8.2.2 Option 2: UE is not capable to determine its location
In the following, it is assumed that the UE has no capability to determine its
location. Four potential solutions have been identified.
#### 8.2.2.1 Solution 1: Timing window based Registration update and paging
This solution assumes moving identifiers on ground.
The satellite can page the UE based on RA.
The following is one possible solution (details may be refined).
In this option, the Tracking Area is associated with the timing information
for how long it is valid related to a geo-area. For example, a geo-area will
be served by NTN beam#1 with TAC#1 during 10:01 -- 10:10, NTN beam#2 with
TAC#2 during 10:11 -- 10:20, etc. an example call flow is shown as below:
Figure 8.2.2-1: UE Registration procedure (example)
● Step 1: at 10:05, UE initiates Registration procedure. The REGISTRATION
REQUEST message is sent to AMF. Just like normal initial access, the CU
provides the TAC#1 to AMF with current NGAP procedure.
● Step 2: AMF replies with REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The AMF determines the
UE\'s location will be covered by TAC#1 during 10:01-10:10, TAC#2 during
10:11-10:20, etc. The determination is based on
\- The ephemeris information of the satellites, i.e. the information as to
which NTN beam covers a specific location.
\- The location of the UE, in terms of TAC/NTN beam ID of UE\'s current or
last 3GPP access. The UE may include its location information in the NAS
REGISTRATION REQUEST message, or other NAS message.
The determination may be performed by querying a database.
The REGISTRATION ACCEPT message includes enhanced Registration Area
information, consisting of a list of TAIs with timing information (in this
example, AMF would like the UE to initiate a Registration Update 10-min later)
\+ TAC#1 with (10:05 -- 10:10)
\+ TAC#2 with (10:11 -- 10:15)
Later, UE enters RRC_IDLE.
**Case 0: UE did not move during 10:05 -- 10:11**
● At 10:11, NTN beam#1 moved out of the UE\'s area. The UE\'s area is now
covered by NTN beam#2 with TAC#2. The UE detected the TAC of the serving cell
is changed to TAC#2. UE checks the TAC#2 against the enhanced Registration
Area received in Step 2 (see Figure 8.2.2-1). TAC#2 is in the Registration
Area assigned by the AMF in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message (Step 2), and the
timing information match (i.e. TAC#2 only for 10:11-10:15), this means the UE
is still in the Registration Area, thus no need to perform Registration
Update.
NOTE: This reuses the current Registration Update trigger.
**Case 1: at 10:12, the UE is paged.**
● Step 3 (see Figure 8.2.2-1): at 10:12, a DL data is received for the UE. AMF
determines the target tracking area based on the UE\'s last location (i.e.
TAC#1 at 10:05), and the Tracking area information for this area (i.e. TAC#1
during 10:01-10:10, and TAC#2 during 10:11-10:20). In this example, AMF knows
the UE\'s last location and will be served by NTN beam#2 with TAC#2 during
10:11-10:20. AMF sends the Paging message with TAC#2 to the NG-RAN.
Normal Service Request procedure is performed.
**Case 2: at 10:13, the UE move out of the Registration Area**
● Step 4 (see Figure 8.2.2-1): at 10:13, the UE detects current NTN beam
broadcasting TAC#1. Even TAC#1 is in the Registration Area assigned by the AMF
in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message (Step 2), but the timing information does
not match (i.e. TAC#1 only for 10:01-10:10, but not for 10:13), this means the
UE is moving out of current Registration Area. So the UE initiates a
Registration Update procedure.
Advantage for this option is:
● Reuse current Registration Update trigger, i.e. TS23.501, \"perform Mobility
Registration Update procedure if the current TAIs of the serving cell (see TS
37.340 [31]) is not in the list of TAIs that the UE has received from the
network;\"
● Reuse current TAC broadcast mechanism, i.e. NTN beam always broadcasts the
same TAC.
● Less changes to RAN and CN.
#### 8.2.2.2 Solution 2: UE assisted TA list report/registration and paging
This solution assumes stationary identifiers on ground.
The satellite pages the UE based on RA, i.e. TAI list.
The following is one potential solution. (Details may be refined)
In this option, the TAI is broadcast in system information in NTN cell based
on fixed TA planning area on ground:
Step 1: Setup a fixed TA map on the Earth\'s surface.
Step 2: Dynamically update the broadcast TAI according to the satellite\'s
position.
Step 3: UE monitors and reports list of received broadcast TAIs for
registration procedure.
Step 4: During the registration procedure, AMF provides a TAI list to the UE,
which defines the UE-specific registration area used for paging.
Step 5: UE measures and records the observed TAI list of the best cells with
respect to time.
Step 6: UE compares the TAI list assigned by AMF with the observed TAI from
Step 5 and determines whether it is still within the registration area or not
(details may be refined).
Step 7: If UE concludes that it has left the registration area, it initiates
the Registration Update procedure and reports the observed TAI list to AMF by
which AMF may assign a new UE-specific TAI list. The determination of the
observed TAI list in UE including adding or deleting a TAI is possible
alternative.
#### 8.2.2.3 Solution 3: Multi-Tracking Area ID based Registration update and
paging
Instead of broadcasting a single TAI, the satellite could broadcast a list of
TAIs of covered TAs, in order to allow for TAs to be a subset of the satellite
beam coverage area. The satellite could then adopt the list of TAIs with
respect to its beam coverage area. In case of transparent satellites, the gNB
on the ground may be preconfigured with the list of TAIs to be used. In case
of regenerative satellites, the network node on the satellite may be
preconfigured with the list of TAIs to be used, for example by using validity
time window information for each TAI list entry in a similar manner as
described in 8.3.2.1.
The advantage of this approach is that the Tracking Area (TA) definition as
non-overlapping areas on the ground is still valid and the current paging
mechanisms can be reused.
Figure 8.2.2-3 shows an example with countries that are equivalent to tracking
areas. Four TAs are defined: TA1: Germany, TA2: Austria, TA3: Switzerland and
TA4 Liechtenstein (Note that it is also possible to define multiple TAs per
country). Three satellites (red, green and blue) are covering parts of the
area shown as red beam, green beam and blue beam. In the top figure the red
satellite broadcasts three TAIs, i.e. TAI2, TAI3 and TAI4 as its beam
footprint is covering TA2, TA3, and TA4. Similarly, the green satellite
broadcasts TAI1 and TAI3, while the blue satellite broadcasts TAI1, TAI2, TAI3
and TAI4. The bottom figure shows the same TAs, while the satellites and their
respective coverage areas moved. Hence, the list of broadcasted TAIs for the
red and green satellites changed, but stayed the same for the blue satellite.
In the example, a UE located in Austria (TAI2), would be paged within both
blue and red satellite beams according to the upper figure. According to the
lower figure, it would be paged within both blue and green satellite beams.
{width="6.159722222222222in" height="4.1375in"} {width="6.139583333333333in"
height="3.8375in"}
Figure 8.2.2-3: Illustration of the solution using country areas as exemplary
tracking areas (two exemplary time instances are shown from top to bottom)
#### 8.2.2.4 Solution 4: UE location determined by NTN based NG-RAN
The earth footprint of a satellite beam depends on the satellite altitude and
the elevation angle, but may be quite large compared to usual terrestrial cell
size. Hence, the trade-off between TA size and registration update is
different for NTN compared to terrestrial networks.
When a UE registers initially, or makes registration area updates, or switches
to connected mode, the NTN based NG- RAN gets a UE location inform, from
serving beam identification for example. A periodic registration area update
could be sufficient to track a UE in idle mode, the RA update periodicity
being tuned according to UE type or observed mobility behaviour.
Moreover, the RAN could have other means to locate a UE.
Hence, even if the UE is not capable to determine its location on its own, it
could be assumed that the RAN has a knowledge of UE location. Then paging
methods based on UE location knowledge can apply.
## 8.3 Connected mode mobility
There are different types of hand-overs in Non-Terrestrial networks:
● Intra-satellite hand-over (between cells served by same satellite)
● Inter-satellite hand-over (between cells served by different satellite)
● Inter-access hand-over (between cellular and satellite access)
There can be some variants depending on whether the satellite is transparent
or regenerative (gNB or partial gNB on board the satellite)
The table identifies the applicable NG-RAN hand-over procedures for each of
the NTN hand-over scenarios.
Table 8.3-1: NG-RAN procedures versus NTN hand-over scenarios
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | NTN Hand-over | Transparent | Regenerative | Regenerative | | scenarios | satellite | satellite (gNB | satellite | | | | on board) | (gNB-DU on | | | | | board) | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Intra | Intra-gNB | intra gNB | Intra-gNB-CU | | satellite | handover | hand-over | Mobilit | | hand-over | procedure | procedure | y/Intra-gNB-DU | | | | | handover or | | | or Inter-gNB | | Inter-gNB-CU | | | handover | | handover (See | | | procedure | | clause 8.2.1.2 | | | | | in TS 38.401) | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Inter | Inter-gNB | inter gNB | Intra-gNB-CU | | satellite | handover | hand-over | Mobility/ | | hand-over | procedure or | procedure (See | Inter-gNB-DU | | | Intra-gNB | clause 9.2.3 | Mobility or | | | handover | in TR 38.300) | Inter-gNB-CU | | | procedure (See | | handover (See | | | clause 9.2.3 | | clause 8.2.1.1 | | | in TR 38.300) | | in TS 38.401) | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Inter access | | Inter AMF/UPF | Intra-gNB | | hand-over | | hand-over | handover | | | | procedure or | procedure | | | | Intra AMF/UPF | | | | | hand-over | or Inter-gNB | | | | procedure (out | handover | | | | of RAN scope) | procedure | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
In each case, the relevant mobility procedures may require some adaptations to
accommodate the extended latency of satellite access.
An inter-access hand-over (between cellular and satellite access) is
considered by utilizing an inter gNB procedure via the 5GCN (e.g. for
Satellite with on board processed payload) or via the Xn (e.g. for satellite
with transparent payload).
It is assumed that not all UEs are capable of positioning.
### 8.3.1 Architecture Classification
In the following sections, the architecture options previously described will
be referred to as follows:
1) Transparent based non-terrestrial access network (Sec. 5.1);
2) Regenerative satellite and split gNB (Sec. 5.2.2);
3) Regenerative satellite and on-board gNB(s) (Sec. 5.2.1);
4) Regenerative satellite with Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs), gNB processed
payload (Sec. 5.2.1);
5) gNB processed payload, Relay-like architecture (Sec. 5.2.3).
### 8.3.2 Intra-gNB Mobility (\"Monolithic gNB\")
In this case, all necessary signalling is confined to within the gNB, with no
signalling impact on NG or Xn. For the case of \"monolithic\" gNB, this is
supported without any standards impact by Architectures 1, 3, 4, and 5.
### 8.3.3 Intra-DU Mobility
In this case, all necessary signalling is confined to within the DU, with no
signalling impact on F1. This is supported by Architecture 2 without any
standards impact.
### 8.3.4 Intra-gNB/Inter-DU Mobility
This is supported by current inter-DU mobility. In Architecture option 2, the
F1 signalling is transferred over SRI.
Single logic DU across multiple satellites is precluded.
### 8.3.5 Inter-gNB Mobility
#### 8.3.5.1 Xn Mobility
For Architectures 1 and 2, Xn interfaces (if present) are terminated at the
ground station; in these cases, Xn mobility is possible without any standards
impact.
There is no Xn in Architecture 3, so in this case it is not possible to
support Xn mobility.
For Architecture 4, Xn mobility is only possible between satellite-hosted
gNBs.
Some further observations should be made on the issue of Xn mobility involving
NTNs. In current NG-RAN specifications, Xn mobility is the mechanism of choice
when moving between neighbour cells, ensuring the best performance and with
minimal core network involvement thanks to the use of a \"horizontal\"
interface, Xn. When considering NTNs, the concept of neighbour cells is going
to be different, and at least two different cases should be considered:
1) Two \"neighbour\" cells belonging to NTNs;
2) Two \"neighbour\" cells, of which one is served by a terrestrial RAN, and
the other by an NTN.
For the first case, if the two cells are served by two different logical nodes
(e.g. satellites) within the NTN, it seems possible to set up Xn and use it
for Xn mobility. This is indeed the case with Arch. 4, in which Xn would be
transported on ISLs.
For the second case, the Xn-based mobility is only possible if an Xn exists
between the NTN gNB and terrestrial gNB.
Architecture 5 (relay-like, Xn is terminated in the satellite but goes through
the NTN-donor) seems to suffer from this problem. Therefore, in theory Arch. 5
supports Xn mobility between satellite-gNBs and terrestrial gNBs, but its
performance seems questionable due to the above observations.
#### 8.3.5.2 Mobility through the 5GC
In Architectures 1 and 2, NG is terminated at the ground station; in these
cases, mobility through the CN is supported without any standards impact.
In Architectures 3, 4 and 5, NG is terminated at the satellite, so NG traffic
needs to be transported over the SRI: mobility through the CN is possible.
### 8.3.6 Mobility due to interface change
In this case, the UE mobility (hand-over) is due to the change of the
interface, for example, when the satellite moves out of the coverage of
current radio network node on the ground, and the UE connects to either a new
radio network node on the ground or a new network node on board the satellite.
● In Architecture Option 1, 3, 4 and 5, this means the change of AMF.
● In Architecture Option 2, this means the change of gNB-CU.
Due to the change of interface, all UEs need to be handover to new network
node (i.e. AMF in Architecture Option 1, 3, 4 and 5, gNB-CU in Option 2).
Handover all connected UEs in a short period can cause significant signalling
load. Further study is needed.
For Mobility due to interface change, it may cause significant signalling load
in all architecture options. Further study is needed.
#### 8.3.6.1 Architecture option with gNB on board satellite
To mitigate the signalling load issue during the mobility due to NG interface
change, a possible option is the Satellite implements two logical gNBs (e.g.
gNB1 and gNB2). gNB1 connect to AMF1, and gNB2 connect to AMF2. gNB1 and gNB2
can share the same resource and UE context.
Since gNB1 and gNB2 are collocated in the same satellite and can share the
resource, it can be assumed that same resource is used to serve the UE when
the UE is handover from gNB1 to gNB2. So it may be possible to avoid the
Handover Resource Allocation procedure. Current Handover Resource Allocation
procedure allows the target AMF to update some UE context, e.g. the NG-U UL
F-TEID. If Handover Resource Allocation procedure is not performed, the
updated UE context may need to be sent from AMF to gNB1, then to gNB2 via an
interface on board the satellite.
Using AMF re-allocation might be another option.
This clause illustrated one possible option to mitigate the interface change
with high load management, other implementation are not precluded.
#### 8.3.6.2 Architecture option with gNB-DU on board satellite
To mitigate the signalling load issue during the mobility due to F1 interface
change, a possible option is the satellite implements 2 logical DUs (e.g. DU1
and DU2). DU1 connect to CU1, and DU2 connect to CU2. DU1 and DU2 can share
the same resource and UE context.
Since DU1 and DU2 are collocated in the same satellite and can share the same
resource, it can be assumed that the same resource keeps serving the UE when
it is handover from DU1 to DU2. In that way it may be possible to avoid the F1
UE Context Setup procedure during inter-DU handover. Current F1 UE Context
Setup procedure allows the target CU to update some F1AP UE context, e.g. gNB-
CU UE F1AP ID, etc. If F1 UE Context Setup procedure is not performed, the
updated F1AP UE context may need to be sent from CU to DU1, then to DU2 via an
interface on board the satellite.
One possible call flow is shown as below.
Figure 8.3-1: CU change example
● DU1 setup F1 with CU1. DU2 setup F1 with CU2. UEs are served by DU1/CU1.
● Step 1: CU1 determines the need to initiate handover preparation procedure
for all connected UEs. CU1 send Xn Handover Request message to CU2. The Xn
Handover Request message includes an indication that the handover is triggered
due to CU switch, and a container for UE F1AP context. By this indication, CU2
will not send F1AP UE CONTEXT REQUEST to target DU.
● Step 2: The Xn Handover Request Acknowledge message includes a container for
the updated F1AP context, e.g. CU2 may allocate a new gNB-CU UE F1AP ID.
● Step 3: CU1 forward the RRC Reconfiguration message to DU1. CU1 also include
the new updated F1AP context. By implementation method, DU2 know the F1AP
context to be used with CU2.
● Step 4: DU1 forward the RRC Reconfiguration message to UE
● Step 5: UE send RRC Reconfiguration Complete message to DU2
● Step 6: DU2 forward the RRC Reconfiguration Complete message to CU2. The
normal handover procedure continues.
This clause illustrated one possible option to mitigate the interface change
with high load management, other implementation are not precluded.

different NTN architectures.

## 8.4 Transport aspects
In the transparent case, a NTN GW connects directly to one or several
satellites via SRI. In the regenerative case, a NTN GW can directly connect to
one or several satellites via SRI, or indirectly connect to one or several
satellites via ISL. Hence the NG protocol is transported over SRI, and may
also be transported over ISL.
A gNB is connected to the 5GCN. The transport of this logical interface can be
realized over SRI and possibly over ISL.
The satellite may embark additional transport routing functions that are out
of RAN scope.
SRI transports 3GPP-RAN specified protocols i.e., transmits the NG interface
signalling packets.
ISL can transport:
● Xn interface signalling packets and enable coordination between gNBs on
board adjacent satellites, and especially to support UE mobility, from a
source gNB to a target gNB.
● Data packets, in case traffic functions are hosted on board the satellites.
● NG interface signalling packets
● F1 interface signalling packets
### 8.4.1 Characteristics of transport links in NTN
#### 8.4.1.1 Characteristics of SRI on the feeder link
Transport over SRI may be subject to the following constraints:
1) Much longer propagation delay with respect to terrestrial transport links
-- the typical length for an Earth-satellite link can go from a few thousands
of km (LEO scenario) to several tens of thousands of km (GEO scenario) . Hence
the one way delay over the SRI ranges from 6 ms (LEO at 600 km and 10°
elevation) to \~136 ms (GEO at 35788 km and 10° elevation);
2) Possibly higher outage probability with respect to terrestrial transport
links when the SRI operates at mm-wave, which is heavily impacted by
atmospheric propagation impairments (e.g. rain attenuation). However this is
mitigated through Uplink power control, Adaptive Coding and Modulation and/or
space diversity schemes. Typically a feeder link is dimensioned to provide
availability up to 99.999% with site diversity;
3) The SRI may become unavailable
a. due to atmospheric attenuation when SRI operates at mm-wave
b. when the satellite disappears below the horizon in LEO constellation
Therefore mobility management is typically activated to ensure a seamless
service continuity and 0 ms interruption time, as described in Section
8.4.1.3.
In the transparent payload case,
● a GEO or a LEO satellite can be connected to several NTN-GW at a given time.
Each NTN-GW will address different radio resources of the satellite.
● a feeder link switch over can be performed using two distinct radio
resources simultaneously to ensure a packet loss less switch over. This
procedure is network originated.
In the regenerative payload case,
● a LEO satellite can be connected to only one NTN-GW at a time except during
feeder link switch over to ensure a seamless service continuity following the
make before break approach.
● a feeder link switch over can be based on a make before break strategy to
obtain a loss less switch over. This is transparent to the UE for layer 3 and
below NG-RAN procedures. This procedure is network originated.
#### 8.4.1.2 Characteristics of Inter Satellite link
In the LEO case, the one-way ISL propagation delay is constellation specific.
Values around 10ms may be considered as typical.
Inter Satellite Links in LEO constellations typical feature an availability
probability of 99.999%.
#### 8.4.1.3 Characteristics of NTN GW
In the case of transparent satellite, the NTN GW supports all necessary
functions to forward the signal of NR-Uu interface.
In the case of regenerative satellite, the NTN GW is a Transport Network Layer
node, and supports all necessary transport protocols, e.g. the NTN GW acts as
an IP router. The SRI provides IP trunk connections between the NTN GW and the
Satellite to transport respectively NG or F1 interfaces.
#### 8.4.1.4 Ephemeris
Satellite ephemeris information may be used to predict feeder link switchover
occurrences, mobility management events (idle and connected mode), radio
resource management, as well as pre/post compensation of common delay/Doppler
shift/variation in NTN based NG-RAN.
The satellite ephemeris information may also be beneficial to 5GC, e.g.
mobility management.
There may be an OAM requirement to configure the satellite ephemeris
information in the RAN and CN. The ephemeris information can be expressed in
an ASCII file using Two-Line Element (TLE) format, which is a de facto
standard.
### 8.4.2 Transporting F1 over the SRI
According to the definitions given in TS 38.401 [3], the CU hosts the RRC,
SDAP and PDCP protocols, and the DU hosts RLC, MAC and PHY layers; the CU
controls the operation of one or more DUs. When F1 is transported over the
SRI, the above functionality may be subject to the following constraints as
described in 8.4.1.1.
Long propagation delay might be addressed by setting appropriate timers (up to
implementation) so that operation in the various protocol layers is not
disrupted by the NTN use case. However, the fact that RRC is terminated in the
CU poses an additional criticality: if the CU is on the ground, the roundtrip
time for a single RRC message between the UE and the CU corresponds to twice
the Earth-satellite link (the RRC message travels through Uu over the NR air
interface and then, transported over F1, through the SRI). Regardless of
whether current NR RRC can withstand this additional constraint, this might
put any NTN architecture based on CU-DU split (described in Sec. 5.3.2) at a
disadvantage with respect to all others in terms of RRC latency.
The impact of outage probability might be analysed by comparing the typical
maximum outage duration for an Earth-satellite link at mm-wave frequency band
with the time it takes for a CU to declare a UE \"lost\" and start removing
the context (typically less than a minute). In case of an SRI outage, this
will negatively impact the CU operation.
In addition, the fact that there are two Earth-satellite paths involved
between the CU and the UE, may also negatively impacts all CU-DU-split-based
architecture options with respects to all others also in terms of outage: the
outage probability of these architectures depends on the combined outage
probability on both links. This will depend on the performance of the SRI.
Using multiple Earth-satellite links to transport the same F1 interface by
exploiting SCTP multi-homing, or multiple SCTP associations between CU and DU,
might possibly mitigate the SRI unavailability due to outage or gateway
switching at the cost of additional latency. This would be a trade-off between
link outage de-correlation and added latency: the further apart the Earth
stations are, the more the link outages would de-correlate, thereby decreasing
the combined link outage, but the total distance to the CU (hence the F1
latency) would increase, thereby increasing latency.
### 8.4.3 Applicability of Xn to NTNs
#### 8.4.3.1 List of Current Xn Functions
There was no contributions highlighting a restriction against the list of
function supported in TS 38.420 [11] during the Study item.
#### 8.4.3.2 Inter-Satellite Xn
UE mobility management for inter-satellite Xn seems beneficial, of course
under the assumption that both satellite-gNBs connect to the same AMF pool.
Purely from an architecture point of view, NR-NR DC is not precluded (with one
satellite acting as Master and the other as Secondary), although further
analysis would be needed (e.g. on RRC aspects, out of RAN3 scope) before
concluding that NR-NR DC is supported. Energy saving is also not precluded
purely from an architecture point of view, although in this case there seems
to be some benefit, with one satellite notifying another of cell
activation/deactivation as part of e.g. constellation reconfiguration.
Xn-U functions are applicable to mobility and DC, so the same considerations
apply.
From the above it descends that inter-satellite Xn seems beneficial, although
further analysis may be needed to assess the feasibility of NR-NR DC in such a
scenario.
From topology point of view, the Inter-Satellite Xn may be conveyed directly
over ISL or via SRI.
#### 8.4.3.3 On-ground NTN-terrestrial Xn
This would support Xn-based UE mobility and NR-NR DC features between on
ground NTN gNB and a terrestrial gNB, requires that both types of gNB connects
to the same AMF pool.
Another feature is the support of Earth-satellite cell activation/deactivation
notification over Xn. For example, a terrestrial gNB may notify a satellite
covering the same area that it is switching off one or more of its cells, and
the satellite may decide to \"take over\" the corresponding coverage area, and
vice versa.
However the benefits of these features was not evaluated.
#### 8.4.3.4 Transporting Xn over SRI
Transporting Xn over an Earth-satellite link between on board NTN gNB and
terrestrial gNB has challenges, but it can be configured if the transport
performance of SRI allows so.
For example, in a LEO scenario, when a satellite moves below the horizon, all
its Xn interfaces to terrestrial gNBs will become unavailable, and this may
trigger subsequent actions at application protocol and/or SCTP level in the
relevant terrestrial gNBs. The opposite will happen when the satellite appears
at the horizon: Xn setups may be triggered to some terrestrial gNBs. This
creates a technical issue, as it will lead to CP signalling surges
corresponding to changes in visibility of the LEO satellites.
Furthermore depending on the outage performance of the SRI, Xn may become
unavailable for some periods of time. This may trigger interface re-
establishment toward all corresponding terrestrial gNBs, generating CP
signalling surges at every outage event. This would happen for all Xn
interface terminated in the on board NTN -gNB impacted by the outage event.
Therefore the benefit of this configuration was not evaluated.
## 8.5 Network Identities Handling
### 8.5.1 General
One of the most basic assumptions in the design of terrestrial radio access
networks is that the RAN is stationary, and the UE moves. All network design
choices, from physical layer parameters to network identities, have been
specified with the above assumption in mind. When studying NTNs, however, the
RAN is not necessarily stationary any more, depending on the type of satellite
system (e.g. GEO vs. non-GEO). Examples of geometrical coverages of a
satellite are given in [TR 22.822 Rel-16].
### 8.5.2 GEO based NTN (Scenario A and B)
Geostationary satellites are closer to the case of terrestrial RAN since they
do not move with respect to their geographical coverage area. As far as
network identities are concerned (e.g. gNB IDs, cell IDs, TAC, etc.), they do
not seem to pose any additional issues with respect to the case of terrestrial
RAN.
### 8.5.3 Non-GEO based NTN (Scenario C and D)
Non-GEO satellites (LEO, MEO and HEO), on the other hand, may provide
additional challenges, because their coverage may move due to their orbital
movement. One of the consequences, for example, is that mobility actions by
the network will result from the combination of satellite movement and UE
movement.
As the satellite moves across the geographical area of interest, its satellite
beams will cover different portions of that area. The following scenarios
could be envisaged for associating _logical_ network identifiers to _physical_
satellite beams:
1) The association between physical satellite beams and logical cells is
continuously reconfigured so that the same gNB ID, cell ID and TAC are always
associated to the same geographical area (\"Stationary identifiers on
ground\");
2) The association between physical satellite beams and logical cells is
fixed, so that the gNB ID, cell ID and TAC follow the satellite beam(s) and
\"sweep\" across the coverage area (\"Moving identifiers on ground\").
Notice that in both cases the required configuration is internal to the gNB
(satellite system) serving the concerned cells.
In both cases, once the satellite moves out of coverage (e.g. below the
horizon), the corresponding cell network identifier(s) will become unavailable
in the coverage area. This may trigger multiple NG and/or Xn setup or
configuration update procedures toward the rest of the RAN. This may be
critical when comparing the different architecture options. Ephemeris
information could assist decisions to trigger interface setup and/or
configuration updates.
#### 8.5.3.1 Stationary Identifiers on ground
A stationary UE on the ground will always be covered by the same cell
identifiers in the same position (similarly to the terrestrial network
scenario). This is only possible for earth-fixed beams. Depending on how
closely the granularity of the satellite beams enables to contour the desired
coverage area, there could be slight variations in coverage. However, apart
from the frequent NG and/or Xn setup or configuration update, it seems there
would be no other impact.
#### 8.5.3.2 Moving Identifiers on ground
A stationary UE on the ground will be covered by different cell identifiers in
the same position, according to the satellite motion. The moving satellite is
likely to provide multiple cells, which will all move together; therefore,
their respective neighbour relations will remain unchanged with respect to the
satellite motion. However relative position between satellites may vary so
that PCI confusion is possible. If the same frequency is used by the NTN and
Terrestrial Network at a given location, then this may cause PCI confusion as
well.
#### 8.5.3.3 Possible Implications on Neighbour Relationships
One aspect to further consider is what happens with respect to fixed (e.g.
terrestrial) RAN nodes: in principle, the neighbour relation between two cells
belonging to respectively a fixed RAN and a moving RAN or to two different
moving RAN keeps changing reusing current mechanisms such as e.g. ANR between
a fixed RAN and a moving RAN.
#### 8.5.3.4 Possible PCI Conflicts
Moving cells can create PCI conflicts, namely PCI collisions (when two cells
with the same PCI become direct neighbours) and PCI confusion (when two cells
with same PCI become neighbours of one cell). The result of those PCI
conflicts can be radio link failures (PCI collision) or handover failures (PCI
confusion). Unfortunately, it is not always possible to detect that the root
cause of those failures were a PCI problem, and not another mobility problem.
PCI problems can be avoided by two principle methods
● If there are less cells than PCIs, then we can certainly assign unique PCIs.
Similarly, if we can partition the cells into groups, where we can guarantee
that groups are sufficiently spatially separated, we can partition the PCIs
appropriately and assign unique PCIs within the groups.
● In case it is difficult to assign unique PCIs within the groups, it may
require to regularly verify whether the PCI allocation is still appropriate
and re-plan PCIs otherwise. For NTN architecture with gNB-CU on ground, the Xn
interface can help the gNB-CU to detect the PCI collision and the PCI
confusion. For NTN architecture option with gNB on satellite, the Xn over ISL
or Xn over SRI, is needed for satellite gNB to detect the PCI collision and
the PCU confusion.
In some scenarios, the NTN cell may need to change PCI. For example, in case a
gNB-CU change with gNB-DU on satellite, the NTN cell may have to change PCI in
order to force a handover procedure, which is used to reconfigure the UE with
new parameters generated by the new gNB-CU. In these scenarios, a NTN cell may
need to be preconfigured with multiple PCIs, i.e. to be used with different
gNB-CUs. Alternatively, the gNB-CU may reconfigure the new PCI.
Existing Xn interface and F1 interface can be reused for distributed PCI
selection and PCI reconfiguration.
## 8.6 User Location
A non-terrestrial network may provide global, or multi-country coverage. This
imposes new challenges as compared to the terrestrial networks. For example,
different policies may apply in different countries. The policies are enforced
while the UE is in RRC CONNECTED mode.
The coverage area of one satellite beam may cover (parts of or) more than one
country at times, while the satellite field of view may be larger than a
country.
The User Location Information, i.e. NTN cell id, may not provide sufficient
accuracy to the network to ensure that the right, country-specific policies
can be applied. A more accurate UE location determination scheme for RRC
CONNECTED UE may be needed to enforce country-specific policies.
When the UE cannot report the exact position information for some reason, such
as GPS loss or do not have position capability, the national granularity can
be obtained from the PLMN of the terrestrial network. For example, the UE can
read and report the surrounding cells PLMN.
The UE location information could be report by several ways:
● Option 1: the UE can report the location information to the AMF through the
NAS message, e.g. during the Registration Procedure;
● Option 2: Upon the reception of the UE\'s location information from the UE,
the gNB forwards it to the AMF. In this manner, the network side can control
the UE report more strictly.
## 8.7 Feeder link switch over
### 8.7.1 Principles
During NTN operation, it may become necessary to switch the feeder link (SRI)
between different NTN GWs toward the same satellite. This may be due to e.g.
maintenance, traffic offloading, or (for LEO) due to the satellite moving out
of visibility with respect to the current NTN GW. The switchover should be
performed without causing service disruption to the served UEs. This can be
done in different ways according to the NTN architecture option deployed.
#### 8.7.1.1 Transparent Satellite
##### 8.7.1.1.1 Transparent LEO, Architecture Option 1, different gNBs
{width="6.69375in" height="2.566666666666667in"}
Figure 8.7.1.1-1: Feeder link switch for transparent LEO NTN
Figure 8.7.1.1-1 shows the feeder link switch for transparent LEO. As seen
from the figure, in the transparent case the gNB is on earth thus there will
be a switch from gNB1 to gNB2. If the satellite can be served by one feeder
link at a time it means that with Rel-15 NR assumptions the RRC connection for
all UEs served by the gNB1 (via GW1) needs to be dropped. After gNB2 (via GW2)
takes over, the UEs may be able to find the reference signals corresponding to
gNB2 and perform initial access on a cell belonging to gNB2.
Figure 8.7.1.1-2 shows one possible solution to enable service continuity for
feeder link switch. At time T1, the satellite is approaching the geographical
location where the transition to be served by next GW will happen. At time
T1.5, the satellite is served by two GWs and at time T2 the transition to next
GW is finished.
{width="6.622916666666667in" height="1.9159722222222222in"}
Figure 8.7.1.1-2: Feeder link switch over for LEO transparent satellite with
two feeder links serving the satellite during the switch
Assuming two feeder link connections serving via the same satellite during the
transition (time T1.5 in Figure 8.7.1.1-2), there exists a HO based solution
that should be feasible with Rel-15 or close to Rel-15 assumptions. This
assumes that it is possible to represent cells of two different gNBs over a
given area via the same satellite but via different NTN-GWs. The two gNBs may
utilize different radio resources of the transparent satellite to ensure both
gNBs are visible to the UE (overlapping coverage areas) simultaneously. During
the switch, the gNB2 which serves the satellite via GW2 may start transmitting
the CD-SSBs of its cells on synchronization raster points that are different
from those of the gNB1. UEs could be have a HO from PCI belonging to gNB1 to
PCI belonging to gNB2. This could be a blind HO (network decision without
measurement) or assisted with measurements. Alternatively, the gNB1 may be
present for a first time-period and configure a conditional handover to the
gNB2, after which the gNB2 is available for a second time-period where the UEs
can then perform the radio handover. Furthermore, the mobility solution may
need to also mitigate for the fact that the UEs may observe very similar
RSRP/RSRQ of the service links, provided by the source and target gNBs,
because the reference signals are transmitted from the same satellite. One
solution may be left to network implementation, e.g. setting proper event A5
thresholds for conditional handover to enable handover, or to rely on radio
propagation time instead or in combination with the RSRP/RSRQ radio
measurements. Relying on radio propagation time includes to take the RTT
experienced by the UE into account in handover decisions. Either as condition
in CHO or in network HO decision.
Figure 8.7.1.1-3 shows another possible solution to enable service continuity
for feeder link switch. At time T1, the satellite stops to transfer the
signalling from the serving GW1. At time T2, the satellite starts to transfer
the signalling from the target GW2.
{width="6.3in" height="1.8666666666666667in"}
Figure 8.7.1.1-3: Feeder link switch over for LEO transparent satellite with
one feeder links serving the satellite during the switch
Assuming only one feeder link connection serving via the same satellite is
applicable during the transition, which means the signal of the serving cell
will be not available during time T1 to time T2. To make the UE access to the
serving cell again, two potential options are listed below:
Solution 1: Feeder link hard switch procedure is based on accurate time
control
Assuming the old feeder link serves the satellite until to T1 and the new
feeder link begins to serve the satellite from T2. This assumes that the cells
of the source gNB(s) are represented over a given area at any time before T1,
and the new cells of the target gNB(s) are represented from time T2.
As there\'s no overlap of source cells and target cells from the gNB(s)
located at the old and the new NTN GWs, the switch over relies on accurate
time control. The handover command should be sent to all the UEs before T1,
e.g. CHO. The UE should not initiate the handover procedure immediately upon
receiving the Handover Command, instead, UE should initiate the handover
procedure after T2, and thus an activation time should be included in the
handover command to all the connected UEs.
Solution 2: Feeder link hard switch procedure is based on conditional RRC re-
establishment
Considering the large cell size of NTN, it might be an extremely difficult
problem for gNB1 to send HO commands to a large number of UEs respectively in
a short time. A part of UEs may not be able to perform HO in time, as a
result, radio link failure may be detected and then UEs initiate the RRC
reestablishment procedure. It will take a long time to restore RRC connection,
which may involve RLF detection, cell selection and potential reestablishment
failure, as a result it has an influence on the service continuity. Thus it
may be beneficial for network to provide assistance information (e.g. next
cell identity and/or reestablishment conditions) to trigger UE RRC
reestablishment instead. Besides, the assistance information can be sent to UE
via SIB instead of dedicated signalling respectively, as a result, the
signalling overhead caused by the large number of UEs can be effectively
reduced.
How to enable cells of two gNB via the transparent LEO satellite can be
defined in the WI phase.
##### 8.7.1.1.2 Transparent LEO NTN, Architecture Option 1, same gNB
It is also possible the transparent satellite is served before and after the
feeder link switch by the same gNB. In this case, both feeder links are
connected to the same gNB, but through different NTN-GWs.
Assuming two feeder link connections serving via the same satellite during the
transition, it could be possible for the gNB to keep the DL reference signals
and to keep the cell \"alive\".
Note: In this case, it may be possible to not to need a HO if the security
keys of gNB can be kept but there may merely be an interruption, or slight
discontinuity in DL transmissions. It should be also noted that the need for
reconfiguration with sync(HO), or without sync, depends on whether gNB
configuration remain the same or not during the switch.
Assuming only one feeder link connection serving via the same satellite during
the transition, the satellite will need to first stop relaying using the
feeder link connection with the NTN-GW1 and then start relaying using the
target NTN-GW2. In this scenario the cell cannot be kept \"alive\" without
interruption and there will be a discontinuity in DL transmissions as
illustrated in Figure 8.7.1.1-4.
For Feeder link hard switch, the solutions captured in 8.7.1.1.1 in different
gNBs scenario can be also applied to this same gNB scenario.
{width="2.2715277777777776in"

height="2.7527777777777778in"}
Figure 8.7.1.1-4: Using 1 gNB and 2 feeder links in a transparent satellite
At time A) the gNB A is connected with the source NTN-GW and serving the UE.
At time B) the gNB A is serving users via the target NTN-GW.
The switchover relies on the temporary overlap of cells from the gNBs located
at the old and the new NTN GWs. The UEs are then handed over from the old to
the new gNB, before the old gNB detaches from the satellite. It is a
prerequisite that the cells from the new gNB are seen as neighbours by the old
gNB, hence Xn needs to be up and running between the two gNBs. Furthermore,
the whole process (from UEs measuring the new cells to handover completion)
needs to take place before the old gNB detaches from the satellite
(potentially critical for the LEO case).
It may be beneficial for the two gNBs to exchange information at Xn Setup
and/or NG-RAN Node Configuration Update about the satellite(s) potentially
involved, for example:
● A list of satellites to which the gNB connects;
● For each satellite in the list, an ID, a list of cell(s) from the gNB which
is served through the satellite, and the ephemeris data for the satellite.
#### 8.7.1.2 Regenerative Satellite, Split gNB
The switchover can be supported for this architecture option only if the gNB-
CU on the ground is centralized. In this case, both NTN GWs are part of the
TNL transporting the F1 interface between the gNB-DU on the satellite and the
centralized gNB-CU. The switchover is then equivalent to adding/removing an
SCTP association between the CU and the DU. According to current
specifications, this is triggered from the gNB-CU.
Option A: The DU may signal, at F1 Setup and/or DU Configuration Update, the
relevant satellite information (e.g. satellite ID, ephemeris data); the CU may
take it into consideration when configuring the TNL.
Option B: The CU may take into consideration, the relevant satellite
information (e.g. satellite ID, ephemeris data) when configuring the TNL
transporting the F1 interface.
#### 8.7.1.3 Regenerative Satellite, with full gNB on board, Architecture
Options 3-5
In this architecture option, the full gNB is onboard of the satellite as
payload. If we consider the LEO case, from Uu perspective, this case is
considerably simpler than the transparent LEO NTN as the Uu is only
transmitted via service link as compared to being transmitted via service and
feeder links. The feeder link switch can be transparent at Uu interface as
long as the security keys of the gNB can be preserved. Figure 8.7.1.3-1
depicts the situation.
{width="6.507638888888889in" height="2.2131944444444445in"}
Figure 8.7.1.3-1: Feeder link switch over for regenerative LEO with full gNB
as payload with two feeder links serving the satellite during the switch
The other situation, when using full gNB and one feeder link during the switch
entails there will be a break in satellite -- NTN GW connectivity, when the
feeder link is switched from the source NTN GW to the target NTN GW. To
smoothen the feeder link switch, the configuration of transport association
for the target NTN-GW feeder link may be signalled before the source NTN-GW
feeder link breaks. In principle, the gNB may continue to broadcast system
information while the switch is ongoing, but refrain from scheduling any
users, since the feeder link connectivity to Earth is not available. In this
way, the cell(s) will not disappear from UE perspective. If the AMF does not
change, the switch is transparent to the UEs except for a U-plane delay,
because cell ID, MIB, SI remains the same. Figure 8.7.1.3-2 depicts this
situation.

##### 8.7.1.3.1 Regenerative LEO NTN with one gNB-DU as payload, Architecture
Options 3-5
In case of having a CU-DU split with one DU on the satellite, while the CU is
on the ground and one feeder link, the same gNB-CU may be connected to both
the source and the target NTN GW the F1 may be re-routed to the target NTN GW
at a specific point in time. In this case the switch may be transparent to the
UEs except a user-plane delay. The gNB-DU may continue to broadcast system
information, but not schedule UEs. Note that the gNB CU refers to a
combination of gNB CU user plane or gNB CU control plane.

Figure 8.7.1.3.1-1: Using 1 gNB-DU on the satellite and 1 feeder link
At time A) the gNB-DU is connected with the source NTN-GW and serving the UE.
At time B) the feeder link switch is taking place and the gNB-DU is not
connected with any NTN-GW. The gNB-DU may still broadcast system information
to the UE. At time C) the gNB-DU is serving users via the target NTN-GW. In
case the gNB-DU connect to a new gNB-CU at time C) the UE would need to
perform a handover or cell reselection.
If the gNB-CU is changed the gNB-DU will initiate the F1 setup procedure to
connect with the next gNB-CU (note a gNB-DU can only connect to one gNB-CU at
a time and thus the connection with the current gNB-CU must first be
terminated). When the connection between the new gNB-CU and the gNB-DU is
established through the target NTN GW the cell ID, MIB, and SI will need to be
updated to reflect the new gNB-CU configuration. This will imply a drop of the
connection for all UEs in the coverage area, who can reconnect to the new gNB-
CU after the switch. The scenario is illustrated in Figure 8.7.1.4-1
If the gNB-CU is changed the UEs will be disconnected with RLF, because a HO
requires both source to target CU to communicate with the DU on the satellite,
and this is not possible because a DU can only be connected to one CU at a
time.
In this case, both NTN GWs are part of the TNL transporting the F1 interface
between the gNB on the satellite and the AMF. The switchover is then
equivalent to adding/removing an SCTP association between the gNB and the AMF.
According to current specifications, this is triggered from the AMF. The gNB
may signal, at NG Setup and/or RAN Configuration Update, the relevant
satellite information (e.g. satellite ID, ephemeris data); the AMF may take it
into consideration when configuring the TNL.
##### 8.7.1.3.2 Regenerative LEO NTN with two gNBs, or gNB-DUs as payload,
Architecture Options 3-5
Having two gNB-DUs with individual feeder link connections entails the UEs may
perform intra-gNB-CU inter-gNB-DU mobility (in case the gNB-CU does not
change). This is significantly faster than a gNB-CU change, which corresponds
to a regular gNB-gNB handover, but also includes F1 communication and the
related delays.
### 8.7.2 Procedures
#### 8.7.2.1 Transparent payload case
The switchover may be predictable (e.g. based on the LEO satellite ephemeris
information and NTN GWs location) or event-triggered (e.g. for maintenance).
In this case, it could be beneficial to introduce a dedicated, non-UE-
associated Xn procedure (Satellite Connection Request) to signal from the old
to the new gNB that it should connect to the specified satellite, optionally
including the list of cells served through the satellite.
Figure 8.7.2.1-1: Feeder link switch over procedure for transparent LEO
satellite (Scenario C2)
This above described procedure allows a soft switch procedure.
Alternatively, a hard switch procedure could be considered to allow for no
simultaneous connectivity between satellite and the 2 NTN-GWs.
This would require to prepare and execute the hand-over precisely using
ephemeris data and accurate time information.
#### 8.7.2.2 Regenerative payload case (gNB on board)
As the LEO satellite moves out a specific geographic area, the satellite may
be out of the serving area of the NTN Gateway, and needs to connect to a new
NTN Gateway. There are two further cases:
Case 1: the satellite remains in the coverage area of current AMF.
> To use the new NTN Gateway for the SCTP with the current AMF, the
> satellite/gNB has to use a new IP address that is anchored in the NTN

Case 2: the satellite moves into a coverage of a new AMF.

#### 8.7.2.3 Regenerative payload case (gNB split)
As the LEO satellite moves out of a specific geographic area, the
satellite/gNB-DU loose the connection with current NTN Gateway, and needs to
connect to a new NTN Gateway. There are two further cases:
Case 1: the satellite remains in the coverage area of current gNB-CU.

Case 2: the satellite moves into a coverage of a new gNB-CU.

> some issues that need to be further studied:
Issue 1: How to handle the F1 connection with the old gNB-CU?

## 8.8 Operations & Maintenance (O&M)
The Non-Terrestrial Networks architecture shall fulfil the O&M requirements on
transport of O&M information between the Management System on the ground and
Non-Terrestrial Node(s) on the satellite.
If possible, the software (or upgrade) should be ensured.

# 9 Recommendations on the way forward
## 9.1 Recommendations from RAN1
Based on the evaluation results of this study, it can be concluded that:
● Class 3 UE can be served by LEO and GEO in S-band with appropriate beam
layout (including potential frequency reuse and/or polarization reuse).
● Other UE (e.g. VSAT and phase array) with high TX/RX antenna gains can be
served by LEO and GEO in both S-band and Ka-band with appropriate beam layout
(including potential frequency reuse and/or polarization reuse)
Existing Rel-15 and Rel-16 NR functionalities form a very good basis for
supporting NTN scenarios (LEO and GEO).
There are however issues due to long propagation delays, large Doppler
effects, and moving cells in NTN. To address the identified issues, for a
potential normative phase, it is proposed to focus on the following:
● Timing relationship enhancements
● Enhancements on UL time and frequency synchronization
● Enhancement on the PRACH sequence and/or format in the case pre-compensation
of timing and frequency offset is not done at UE side
In addition, the following topics should be discussed when specifications are
developed:
● Beam management and BWP operation for NTN with frequency reuse.
\- Including signalling of polarization mode
● Feeder link switch impact on physical layer procedures in case of LEO
scenarios
● Number of HARQ process with additional considerations such as HARQ
feedback/buffer size and RLC ARQ feedback/buffer size in the case of LEO and
GEO scenarios
● Support of enabling / disabling of HARQ feedback.
In addition, discussions identified in clauses 6.2 to 6.4 of the document
without conclusions, can be continued.
PAPR optimizations for downlink channels are not necessary to be specified for
NTN at least for Rel-17.
## 9.2 Recommendations from RAN2
Based on the study performed, Rel.15 and NR can support NTN scenarios with
enhancements identified below to be considered as part of the normative work.
In general,
● Offset based solutions for timer adaptations are preferred to support all
NTN scenarios.
● Earth fixed tracking area is recommended.
The Rel-15\'s user plane procedures apply to NTN with enhancements to the
following features
● MAC
\- Random access:
• Definition of an offset for the start of the ra-ResponseWindow for NTN and
extension of the ra-ResponseWindow duration to support UE without location
information.
• Introduction of an offset for the start of the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer
to resolve Random access contention
• Solutions for resolving preamble ambiguity and extension of RAR window.
• Adaptations for UEs with GNSS capabilities; timing advance and msg3
scheduling.
\- Timing advance: TA calculation and signaling adaptation to deal with NTN
maximum round trip delay in LEO and GEO scenarios for UE with and without UE
location information.
\- DRX:
• If HARQ feedback is enabled, an offset should be added for _drx-HARQ-RTT-
TimerDL_ and _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL_.
• If HARQ is turned off per HARQ process, adaptions in HARQ procedure may be
required
• Options for UE power saving for SR and CFRA can be discussed during work
item phase
\- Scheduling Request: Extension of the value range of _sr-ProhibitTimer_
\- HARQ
• enabling / disabling of uplink HARQ feedback for downlink transmission at
the UE receiver should be configurable per UE and per HARQ process.
• enabling / disabling of HARQ uplink retransmission should be configurable
per UE or per HARQ process. The LCP impact caused by disabling the HARQ uplink
retransmission configuration and its impact on UE\'s uplink transmission
should be discussed in the work item phase.
• Multiple transmission of the same TB to lower residual BLER should also be
configured.
● RLC
\- Status reporting: Extension of the value range of _t-Reassembly_
\- Sequence Numbers: extension of the SN space only for GEO scenarios will be
discussed during the work item phase
● PDCP
\- SDU discard: Extension of the value range of _discardTimer_ will be
discussed during the work item phase.
\- Sequence Numbers: extension of the SN space for GEO scenarios will be
discussed during the work item phase.
The Rel-15\'s control plane procedures apply to NTN with enhancements to the
mobility management procedures when considering Earth moving beam footprint
option.
● Idle mode:
\- Definition of additional assistance information for cell
selection/reselection (e.g. using UE location information, satellite Ephemeris
information)
\- Use earth-fixed tracking area to avoid frequent TAU
\- NTN cell specific information in SIB
● Connected mode:
\- Definition of schemes to reduce service interruption during Hand-Over due
to large propagation delay (especially in the case of GEO transparent)
\- Definition of schemes to tackle frequent handover and high handover rate
due to satellite movement (e.g. LEO NTN)
\- Definition of schemes to improve handover robustness due to small signal
strength variation in regions of beam overlap
\- Definition of schemes to compensate for propagation delay differences in
the UE measurement window between cells originating from different satellites,
especially for LEO NTN
● Other mobility enhancements:
\- Additional CHO triggering conditions (e.g. location/time based), and
adaptation of measurement-based thresholds and events to the NTN environment.
\- Possible enhancements to mobility configuration (e.g. to support broadcast
configuration)
\- Enhancements to measurement configuration/reporting (e.g. pre-triggering
based solutions)
\- Service continuity for mobility from TN to NTN and from NTN to TN systems
The Rel-16\'s user plane 2 step RACH procedure can be considered during the WI
phase with possible enhancements:
● The required adaptations will be discussed during the WI phase, such as
inclusion of assistance information, e.g., SFN index, in MsgA etc.
● The trade-off between latency gain and UL overhead impact caused in NTN
scenarios by the introduction of 2-step RACH procedure can be further
discussed during the normative work.
The same solutions identified for Earth moving cell scenario can also be
applied for Earth fixed cell scenario, however whether specific solutions are
necessary (or preferred) for each scenario can be further evaluated in the
normative phase.
## 9.3 Recommendations from RAN3
There are no showstoppers to support any identified architecture options in
clause 8:
● Transparent satellite based NG-RAN architecture
● Regenerative satellite based NG-RAN architectures
The Regenerative satellite based NG-RAN architectures with gNB processed
payload based on relay-like architecture was not studied due to the pending
work on IAB support (WI IAB_NR).
For a potential normative phase, it is proposed to focus on the following
● GEO based satellite access with transparent payloads
● LEO based satellite access with transparent or regenerative payloads
No specific issues have been identified to support the split regenerative
payload case (gNB-DU on board) ; some protocol adaptation may be needed in a
potential normative phase.
In case, the architecture option based on relay-like architecture (IAB) needs
to be supported in non-terrestrial networks, further study will be needed.
## 9.4 Other assumptions
The NTN study results apply to GEO scenarios as well as all NGSO scenarios
with circular orbit at altitude greater than or equal to 600 km.
For other NTN scenarios with orbits less than 600 km as UAS (including HAPS)
scenario, no specific analyses have been performed during this study item.
However, considering the characteristics of UAS such as delay (altitude),
footprint size (differential delay) and Doppler identified in this study item,
the same enhancements as LEO may be applicable for UAS because their values
and variation rates are lower than LEO. The enhancements for LEO are not
necessarily required for UAS scenarios when delay, footprint and Doppler can
be similar or equivalent values with those of terrestrial network, but the
detailed conditions were not discussed in this study item, as well.
###### ### Annex A: Satellite ephemeris
# A.1 Key parameters
Key parameters of orbital mechanics of all commercial satellites are publicly
available from multiple sources. This information is called ephemeris, which
is used by astronomers to describe the location and orbital behaviour of stars
and any other astronomic bodies.
Typically, ephemeris is expressed in an ASCII file using Two-Line Element
(TLE) format. The TLE data format encodes a list of orbital elements of an
Earth-orbiting object in two 70-column lines. The contents of the TLE table
are reproduced below.
Table A.1-1: First line of the ephemeris
* * *
Field Columns Content 1 01--01 Line number (1) 2 03--07 Satellite number 3 08
--08 Classification (U=Unclassified) 4 10--11 International Designator (Last
two digits of launch year) 5 12--14 International Designator (Launch number of
the year) 6 15--17 International Designator (piece of the launch) 7 19--20
Epoch Year (last two digits of year) 8 21--32 Epoch (day of the year and
fractional portion of the day) 9 34--43 First Time Derivative of the Mean

assumed) 12 63--63 The number 0 (originally this should have been \"Ephemeris
type\") 13 65--68 Element set number. Incremented when a new TLE is generated
for this object. 14 69--69 Checksum (modulo 10)

The TLE format is an expression of mean orbital parameters \"True Equator,
Mean Equinox\", filtering out short term perturbations.
From its TLE format data, the SGP4 (Simplified General Propagation) model [10]
is used to calculate the location of the space object revolving about the
earth in True Equator Mean Equinox (TEME) coordinate. Then it can be converted
into the Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) Cartesian x, y, z coordinate as a
function of time.
The instantaneous velocity at that time can also be obtained. In ECEF
coordinate, z-axis points to the true North, while x axis and y axis
intersects 0-degres latitude and longitude respectively as illustrated below.

latitude and longitude (source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECEF)

satellite is shown below as an example below.

Given a specific point in time, it is straightforward to calculate the
satellite location by interpolation. The example given above refers to a
geosynchronous (GEO) satellite, in which the epoch interval is 5 minutes. For
LEO satellites, the intervals may be much shorter, on the order of seconds.

Signalling (control plane) and data (User plane) interruption time should be
made as much as possible equivalent as in terrestrial systems except in the
case of handover between satellite and terrestrial access. In the latter case,
this interruption time will depend on the satellite orbit.
###### ### Annex C: Regulatory Aspects
In the ITU Radio Regulations (ITU, 2016) the interference to any GEO network
caused by a NGSO system is strictly constrained. One restriction to the system
is that a NGSO system shall not cause unacceptable interference into any GEO
network in the fixed satellite service for uplink and downlink in the same
frequency (in-line interference), shown in Figure C-1. For that reason, (ITU,
2016) limits the maximum equivalent power flux densities (EPFD) of the NGSO
system to values which are not sufficient to enable satellite communication.
This document will focus on both the service uplink from the UE to the NGSO
system (interfering the receiver on board of a GEO satellite) and the service
downlink from the NGSO system to the UE (interfering a GEO receive station on
earth).

Figure **C-1** : In-line interference caused by NGSO systems (MEO or LEO)
_Service uplink from UE to NGSO satellite:_
Satellite specific user terminals are partly equipped with a dish antenna to
reach high signal gains, due to its high directivity. Especially for
frequencies in the FR2 and the use of satellite specific user terminals on
ground with high directive antennas the problem of in-line interference arises
for the service uplink in satellite system.
We look at a scenario in which the UE uses a directive antenna to communicate
with a NGSO satellite. It may further be able to track the movement of the
NGSO satellite with its antenna. Given the high directivity it is possible
that the UE will glare a GEO satellite that is located in the same direction
as the NGSO from the UE\'s perspective. As the uplink transmission power could
exceed the ITU regulatory constraints for in-line interference of the
protected GEO satellites, this issue has to be addressed already in the
initial and random access phase. In the following we assume that the UE is
aware of its position as well as the network.
The problem with a heavy deployment of NGSO systems arises with so-called in-
line interference. This type of interference occurs, whenever a NGSO satellite
crosses the line of sight path of an Earth station and a GEO satellite as
depicted in Figure C-1.
To avoid that the cell of the NGSO satellite has to be switched off
completely, only the UE\'s with highly directive antennas, which are pointing
towards the GEO satellite should be disabled or hand over to other NGSO
satellites.
_Service downlink from NGSO satellite to UE:_
In this case, the downlink signal from a NGSO satellite is interfering a GEO
receive station on earth. The satellite beam pointing towards the GEO ground
station has either to be steered to another direction or has to be switched
off completely. The GEO receive station especially for FR2 are already
deployed and protected by ITU regulations.
As a conclusion, in-line interference between NGSO and GSO satellite systems
might occur especially when highly directive antennas are used in NTN
scenarios and solutions to comply with the ITU regulatory constraints for in-
line interference shall be specified for both uplink and downlink.
