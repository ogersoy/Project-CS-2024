# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report for the study item on 7.125 \--
24.250 GHz frequency range, covering the regulatory framework study, general
RF aspects, as well as BS- and UE-specific aspects.
During the NR study item in Rel-14, frequency range of 6 -- 24 GHz was
discussed as part of the RAN WG4 studies. This frequency range was included
within the Rel-14 study item objectives and the operational requirements for
Next Generation access technologies described in TR 38.913 [2].
As the frequencies below 7.125 GHz and above 24.25 GHz (i.e. up to 52.6 GHz)
were already addressed in Rel‑15 NR specifications, the discussion on the 7 -
24 GHz intermediate range was triggered at later stage.
NOTE 1: During Rel-15 work on NR frequency bands, the FR1 frequency range was
initially defined up to 6 GHz. At later stage of Rel-15, the FR1 was agreed at
RAN#82 meeting to be extended up to 7.125 GHz in order to incorporate the NR-U
work and potential licensed operation.
NOTE 2: For simplicity purposes, whenever the term "7 -- 24 GHz" will be used
in this technical report, the frequency range of 7.125 -- 24.250 GHz shall be
considered.
This TR intends to provide information on the feasibility of NR operation in 7
-- 24 GHz frequency range for set of potential deployment scenarios,
considering BS RF and UE RF technology capabilities taking into account
possible ranges for key requirements.
This TR does not intend to provide specific recommendations on NR system
parameter values to be defined, nor specific RF or EMC requirement values to
be defined for UE or BS operation in this frequency range, as those aspects
are considered to be covered by the follow-up WI.

### 4.2.1 Europe and CEPT
General information for usages in CEPT can be found in the European table of
frequency allocations and applications in the frequency range 8.3 kHz to 3000
GHz [23]. When it comes to Regulation about Short Range Devices additional
information can be found in Recommendation ERC/REC 70-03 "Relating to the use
of Short Range Devices (SRD)"(*) [32]. Where a corresponding EC decision
exists it is marked with (^+^). Unwanted emission limits can be found in ECC
Recommendation (02)/05 "Unwanted Emissions" [33] and ERC/RECOMMENDATION 74-01
"Unwanted emissions in the spurious domain" [34].

## 4.4 WRC-19 outcomes
In this clause summary of the WRC-19 conclusions related to the IMT in 7 \--
24 GHz range and applicable deployment scenarios is provided.
### 4.4.1 New agenda items for WRC-23
Based on the discussion on the new agenda items for WRC-23 conference,
resolution COM6/1 (i.e. _Agenda for the 2023 world radiocommunication
conference_) as in the WRC-19 Provisional Final Acts report [59] was agreed
during WRC‑19, including the following considerations:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | > _1.2 to consider identification of the frequency bands 3 300-3 400 | | > MHz, 3 600-3 800 MHz, 6 425-7 025 MHz, 7 025-7 125 MHz and | | > 10.0-10.5 GHz for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT), | | > including possible additional allocations to the mobile service on | | > a primary basis, in accordance with Resolution COM6/2 (WRC-19);_ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
Based on the above identified frequency ranges for IMT, possible additional
allocations to the mobile services on a primary basis are to be discussed for
7 -- 24 GHz range during WRC-23 in the following frequency range: 10.0 -- 10.5
GHz (Region 2).
Further referring to the resolution COM6/2 in [59] (i.e. _Studies on
frequency-related matters for the terrestrial component of International
Mobile Telecommunications identification in the frequency bands_), WRC-19
recognized to conduct and complete in time for WRC-23 the sharing and
compatibility studies with a view to ensuring protection of serviced to which
the frequency band is allocated on a primary basis, without imposing
additional regulatory or technical constraints on those services, and also, as
appropriate, on services in adjacent bands, for the above listed band 10.0 --
10.5 GHz.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | > _2 to conduct and complete in time for WRC-23 the sharing and | | > compatibility studies1, with a view to ensuring the protection of | | > services to which the frequency band is allocated on a primary | | > basis, without imposing additional regulatory or technical | | > constraints on those services, and also, as appropriate, on | | > services in adjacent bands, for the frequency bands:_ | | > | | > _\-- 3 600-3 800 MHz and 3 300-3 400 MHz (Region 2);_ | | > | | > _\-- 3 300-3 400 MHz (amend footnote in Region 1);_ | | > | | > _\-- 7 025-7 125 MHz (globally);_ | | > | | > _\-- 6 425-7 025 MHz (Region 1);_ | | > | | > _\-- 10 000-10 500 MHz (Region 2),_ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
### 4.4.2 IMT for fixed wireless broadband in fixed services bands
WRC-19 resolution COM6/1 in [59] concludes that WRC-23 shall consider and
approve the report of the Director of the Radiocommunication Bureau, including
the following:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | > _Study the use of International Mobile Telecommunication system | | > for fixed wireless broadband in the frequency bands allocated to | | > the fixed services on primary basis, in accordance with Resolution | | > COM6/18 (WRC-19);_ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
In particular the above resolution includes reference to the resolution
COM6/18 in [59] on study of IMT system for fixed wireless broadband in the
frequency bands allocated to the fixed services on primary basis:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | > _to conduct any necessary studies on the use of International | | > Mobile Telecommunication systems for fixed wireless broadband in | | > the frequency bands allocated to the fixed service on primary | | > basis,_ COM6/18 in [59]. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
The above referred resolution COM6/18 [59] further recognizes (among others)
that:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | > _that the ITU-R Handbook on "Fixed Wireless Access" addressed the | | > use of International Mobile Telecommunication (IMT) systems for | | > Fixed Wireless Access, and Recommendation ITU-R M.819 contains | | > specific requirements pertaining to fixed wireless access,_ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
It shall be observed, that the above referred ITU-R Handbook and ITU-R
recommendation M.819 [66] are Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) specific, while the
resolution COM6/18 refers to the "fixed wireless broadband". This terminology
inconsistency may require further clarifications and studies on their
applicability and deployment scenario assumptions. Such studies are considered
to be out of scope of this study item.
The above text from COM6/18 in [59] is found to be applicable to the 7 \-- 24
GHz range where multiple fixed wireless broadband systems were deployed as
fixed services on primary basis.
It is expected that results of the above studies will be reported to the
WRC-23 conference.
# 5 Study on general aspects
## 5.1 General
This clause provides discussion on general aspects of the 7 -- 24 GHz
frequency range study item applicable to both UE and BS studies, unless
otherwise stated.
## 5.2 Selection of frequency sub-ranges and example frequencies
The performance trends related to vital components and technologies to be used
within the frequency range 7 -- 24 GHz indicates that the frequency range
needs to be split up into frequency sub-ranges, each with one example
frequency selected. The intension with the example frequencies is that the
technology evaluation is supposed to be performed per example frequency. The
selected frequency sub-ranges and example frequencies are listed in table
5.2-1.
**Table 5.2-1: Frequency sub-ranges and examples frequencies selection in 7 --
24 GHz range**
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Frequency |** Frequency**|** Example | | sub-range**| | frequency** | | | **(GHz)** | | | | | **(GHz)** | +======================+======================+======================+ | 1 | 7.125 - | 10 | | | f~boundary,\ low~ | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 2 | f~boundary,\ low~ - | 15 | | | f~boundary,\ high~ | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 3 | f~boundary,\ high~ - | 20 | | | 24.250 | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Note 1: | | | | f~boundary,\ low~ is | | | | within the frequency | | | | range 10 - 13 GHz. | | | | | | | | Note 2: | | | | f~boundary,\ high~ | | | | is within the | | | | frequency range 16 - | | | | 18 GHz. | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
The above frequency sub-ranges were selected only for purpose of RF technology
analyses during this SI and shall not be confused with potential new NR
frequency range(s) (as compared to the existing FR1 or FR2 defined for NR) and
band plan which could be defined by RAN4 in harmonization with other services
for NR in future.
In case outcomes of the RF requirement analyses will be found as sufficiently
similar across adjacent example ranges, RAN4 may consider merging them towards
conclusion on FR1/FR2 extension and/or new FR range introduction, in the
follow-up WI.
## 5.3 Comparison of FR1 and FR2 characteristics
### 5.3.1 General
In a RAN4 context, there is a very substantial difference between the
technology characteristics and system behaviors for FR1 and FR2 spectrum.
Within RAN4, the understanding of what is meant with FR1 and FR2 differs
between the base station RF specifications, the UE RF specifications and the
RRM specifications. Furthermore, RAN1 and RAN2 have also used the terms FR1
and FR2 to refer to signaling concepts and types of UE and network behavior.
Thus, terms "FR1" and "FR2" imply certain characteristics or types of
behavior.
During related future WI when considering specific operating bands within 7 --
24 GHz range, other working groups besides RAN4 would need to confirm whether
FR1 or FR2 behavior and requirements can be reused or whether something new is
needed. RAN4 would need to consider the applicability of requirements, as well
as requirement values. If the requirements correspond sufficiently to FR1 or
FR2, extension of the FR may be preferred. Already now we have different RF
requirements within the same FR, e.g. different ACLR in 28 GHz and 39 GHz
frequencies. If there would be large deviations, a strategy for dealing with
the deviations would be needed (e.g. creation of sub-FR, defining new FR, or
similar) that could be applied consistently across the working groups to
develop the necessary descriptions of requirements, functionality, signaling,
etc.
#### 5.3.1.1 RAN1 specification impacts
The RAN1 specifications differentiate FR1 and FR2 in the following aspects:
\- TS 38.211 [13]: Random access configuration depends on FR1/FR2. Transition
times RXTX and TXRX depend on FR1/FR2. OffsetToPointA unit depends on FR1/FR2.
\- TS 38.213 [14]: SSB pattern and cell search depend on FR1/FR2. Power
control aspects for dual connectivity depend on FR1/FR2. BWP switching in RA
procedure depends on FR1/FR2. Actions related to bwp-InactivityTimer in BWP
switching depend on FR1/FR2. Type0-PDCCH monitoring behaviour depends on
FR1/FR2.
\- TS 38.214 [15]: Different behaviour w.r.t. overlapping reception of unicast
PDSCH and SI-PDSCH. FR2 supports TRS in single slot. PT-RS support is
different w.r.t. FR1/FR2. PDSCH and PUSCH processing capability 2 is only
defined for FR1. FR1 supports almost contiguous allocation for UL CP-OFDM
while FR2 does not.
An important question for 7 -- 24 GHz range is whether all of the impacted
RAN1 procedures are the same as for FR1 or FR2, or whether it is the case that
some procedures are like one of the FRs and other procedures are more like the
other FR, or different to either FR. If the latter is the case (i.e. not all
procedures can be inherited from an FR), then a new FR seems needed, whereas
if the latter is the case then from a RAN1 perspective the FR could be
extended.
#### 5.3.1.2 RAN2 specification impacts
FR1 and FR2 differ in terms of requirements and functionality. This implies
that if the total functionality in a band in the 7 -- 24 GHz range does not
correspond exactly to FR1 or to FR2 then the RRC signaling may need to differ.
Furthermore, signaling of parameters may need to differ in case the parameter
values do not correspond directly to FR1 or FR2 in all cases.
Based on input from RAN1 and RAN4, RAN2 distinguishes FR1 and FR2 both in the
(interpretation of) UE capability signaling as well as in the (interpretation
of) DL configuration messages. If the 7 -- 24 GHz range would be introduced as
e.g. a new FR3, RAN2 specifications would need to be updated. In some cases it
may just be and textual amendment ("in FR1 and FR3") but in other cases it
will require new fields or entire branches in RRC signaling. If most
properties of the new frequency range differ from FR1 and FR2 or if some are
like in FR1 and others like in FR2, a new term may anyway be preferable. In
case of the latter, RAN2 will have to discuss and incorporate many changes.
Planning of work items should account for that.
However, if the new frequency range would inherit most of its properties from
either FR1 or FR2, it would be preferably from signaling point of view to
reuse those existing terms (and hence the signaling structure). This would
minimize the changes to the RAN2 specifications and hence the work-load and
possibly also the time to market.
#### 5.3.1.3 RAN4 specification impacts
##### 5.3.1.3.1 General
The FR categorization has some impact on general system parameters in RAN4.
For example, the set of channel bandwidths and subcarrier spacings that can be
applicable. The specific BW~Channel~ and SCS are specified on a band specific
basis but must be a subset of the BS/SCS defined for the applicable frequency
range.
##### 5.3.1.3.2 BS RF
In the BS RF specifications (i.e. TS 38.104 [5], TS 38.141-1 [16], TS 38.141-2
[6]), apart from the frequencies of bands, the term frequency range
encompasses aspects of requirement concept and design, requirement levels and
test methodologies.
Requirement concept and design differs for the TDD OFF power requirement,
where a co-location type requirement is applicable for all FR1 bands and a
TRP/EIRP requirement for FR2 bands.
The concept for receiver requirements differs substantially. For all FR1
bands, RX requirements are based on base conducted values that are scaled with
a virtual gain. For FR2 bands, the reference sensitivity level is declared
within a specific range, and other interferer levels are relative to that
value.
For all FR1 bands, co-location requirements are specified, whereas for FR2
bands, there are no co-location requirements. The set of performance
requirements differ depending on whether the band is an FR1 or FR2 band.
##### 5.3.1.3.3 UE RF
In the UE RF specifications (TS 38.101-1 [17], TS 38.101-2 [18], TS 38.101-3
[19]), the major difference between FR1 and FR2 is that for FR1, requirements
are defined and tested as conducted, whereas for FR2 OTA definitions and tests
are applied. As a consequence of the OTA testing, in FR2 some additional
requirements on spherical coverage and beam correspondence are included that
are not applicable for FR1.
Apart from the OTA aspects, the requirement concept and applicability between
FR1 and FR2 is in general more similar for the UE than for the BS. FR1
includes some additional blocking requirements compared to FR2. Handling of
duty cycle and power back off for EMC & absorption regulatory compliance
differs between the two ranges.
Requirement values differ between FR1 and FR2. Some requirements are band
specific and others frequency range specific.
##### 5.3.1.3.4 RRM
The main difference in RRM specification TS 38.133 [20] between FR1 and FR2
UEs is that FR1 UEs are not assumed to perform RX beam sweeping, whereas RX
beam sweeping is necessary for FR2 handover which leads to longer delays in
requirements (larger multipliers for SMTC periodicity). In addition, the UE
cannot simultaneously perform analogue beamforming towards the serving cell
and RX beam sweeping so there are various scheduling restrictions specified in
TS 38.133 [20] for FR2 operations to allow the UE to beam sweep.
Thus, there is a need to consider both whether beam sweeping is required, and
how likely it is that the restriction is needed.
There are also differences in other aspects of RRM requirements such as UE
measurement capabilities (e.g. minimum number of SSB that the UE shall be
capable of measuring), however these are more a consequence of different
parameterization of the physical layer (up to L = 64 TX beams are possible in
FR2) rather than fundamentally different operations and requirements.
Hence, when considering a frequency band in the range 7 -- 24 GHz the
fundamental questions which need to be answered from an RRM perspective are:
\- Whether RX beam sweeping is used, and if so, how does it differ from the
existing RX beam sweeping operation assumed for FR2.
\- At what frequency is it feasible to operate a UE without RX beam sweeping.
The answers to these questions would determine the extent to which existing
FR1 or FR2 requirements could be reused in the 7 -- 24 GHz range, and how the
existing requirements could be modified to make them applicable to bands in 7
-- 24 GHz range.
### 5.3.2 Transmitter architecture
It is generally assumed that FR1 BS adopt a BB beam forming architecture in
addition to using digital adaptive pre-distortion to linearize the transmitter
and that FR2 BS use analogue, digital or hybrid beam forming and does not use
linearization. Whilst different architectures decisions may go together, they
are not dependent on each other but are both dependent on a similar set of
technical parameters.
Low frequencies lend themselves to both BB beam forming and digital
linearization as they have the following characteristics:
\- Antennas size and hence No of elements is limited by the physical size.
\- Power amplifiers can be high power.
\- Operating band widths are small (compared to FR2).
As such a separate transmitter chain from BB to antenna element is feasible.
For a base station the principle transmitter architecture is visualised in
figure 5.3.2-1.{width="6.695138888888889in" height="2.6284722222222223in"}

Based on the implementation the number of interfaces between the sub-systems
may vary. The parameters in the reference architecture is described in table
5.3.2-1.

regardless of semiconductor technology. In figure 5.4.3-2 the effect on
achievable ACLR of the efficiency -- linearity trade-off is investigated.
Three typical points from the maximum P1dB-PAE trajectory is chosen: P1dB = 10
dBm, 17 dBm and 20 dBm. For each point the ACLR is computed as function of
average output power. The PAE numbers given in the figure are indicative of
the average PAE resulting from the peak PAE for these example points (4%, 5%
and 6%) under the assumption that the amplifiers operate in class-A.

Figure 5.4.3-2: Average output power as function of ACLR with PAE as parameter
To verify the relations between output power vs. ACLR, we re-use to the
results and approach derived earlier in the work for FR2 based on simulations
of a GaN and a CMOS PA, both designed for operation around 30 GHz. Similar to
the FR2 approach where the PA models at 45 GHz and 70 GHz FR2 proxy
frequencies used the same nonlinear characteristics but with the output power
scaled as -20 dB/decade while PAE scaled as -6 dB/decade, the same approach
has been used for 7 -- 24 GHz example frequencies. The results for relation
between output power and ACLR as well as ACLR vs PAE for example frequencies
of 10 GHz, 15 GHz and 20 GHz are presented in figure 5.4.3-3 and figure
5.4.3-4 respectively, but now with PAE scaling as -5 dB/decade as supported by
the larger updated data set used in this work.

As discussed in clause 5.4.2, assuming the DC power as well as the RF power
associated with the Pas should be constant per antenna array unit area, the
PAE scaling of -5 dB/decade can be exploited to a yield a -10 dB/decade ACLR
scaling. Thus, from 30 GHz to 20, 15, 10 GHz, PAE should improve by 0.9, 1.5,
2.4 dB and consequently the ACLR can be improved by 1.8, 3.0, 4.8 dB.
5.4.4 Filtering aspects
In order to meet out of band emissions requirements, analogue filters are
typically needed. Filters are thus an important block in the transceiver
chain.
Due to limited size (area/volume) and level of integrations needed for AAS BS
types for 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range (i.e. _BS type x~FR~-H_ or _BS type
x~FR~-O_), filtering can pose a significant challenge. Traditional discrete
filters are likely to be far too bulky to be fitted in limited size and
difficult to embed into highly integrated systems (although may be suitable
for _BS type x~FR~-C_ implementations), and thus more advanced technologies
are needed. It is important to understand the properties of filter
technologies when considering the relationship between achievable output
power, spectrum usage and out of band requirements.
There are certain fundamental parameter dependencies for filters which it is
useful to consider, as follows:
\- Insertion Losses decreases with increasing BW (for fixed fc).
\- Insertion Losses increases with increasing fc (for fixed BW).
\- Insertion Losses decreases with increasing Q.
\- Insertion Losses increases with increasing N (number of poles).
To better understand the relationships between these parameters, some
estimations of the properties of example filters, with example bandwidths and
emissions requirements were considered.
\- For the example frequency of 20 GHz, attenuation around 20 - 25 dB was
considered.
\- For 15 GHz example frequency the corresponding attenuation level was 30 dB.
It is important to note that the analysis presented here represents very rough
estimates presented for understanding of the trends in filter performance and
the specific numbers should not be relied upon for future standardization
work. The exact attenuation level and filtering aspects can be further
evaluated when future WI based on specific possible frequency bands and the
adjacent systems are known.
In summary, the filter examples investigated imply the need to have reasonably
large guard-band taking to account the tolerances and drift in frequency due
to e.g. temperature etc.
The analysis is focused on LTCC filters as an example, but this is not the
only feasible filter technology. There are other filter technologies which
could be suitable for the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range such as ceramic wave-
guide filters and air cavity filters which can be further investigated when in
future band specific work items can be studied in detail.
Based on the example filter characteristics in annex B, filter parameters for
some possible technologies have been collected for example frequencies in
table 5.4.4-1.

The filter parameters can be used as input for decision for numerous RF
parameters relevant for exclusion zones for receiver blocking, emission and
other requirements. It is important to note that there are other filter
technologies which should be also taken into account in future work.
## 5.5 Key parameters over the 7 -- 24 GHz range
### 5.5.1 Noise figure
#### 5.5.1.1 General aspects for noise figure
Receiver Noise Figure (NF) is one of the essential metrics for determining
receiver requirements. For determining typical NF value some fundamental
principles should be considered:
\- The NF is not given by the LNA alone, but also by bandwidth, linearity and
dynamic range dependencies as there is a delicate balance which should be
considered when future requirements are specified.
\- A full RF receiver chain all the way up to radiating elements should be
addressed as all parts in the chain would contribute to the overall receiver
performance including switch (for TDD), routing and filter losses, etc.
**\- For some** compact and highly integrated building practices with many
transceivers and antennas, the power efficiency and heat dissipation in small
area/volume is necessary needs to be considered.
\- As an example, in the context of NF, it might be possible to reduce the
noise contribution from ADC by using more bits, but this would have
significant implication in terms of power consumption and heat dissipation
aspect as a single added bit to ADC would result in four times higher power
consumption. In general the ADC power consumption is proportional to
BW^2^ · DR~ACD~
> where DR~ACD~ is the ADC dynamic range.
For UE, the typical NF values considering the usage of similar technologies as
for BS, should be similar but slightly higher to allow more flexibility in the
implementation and taking to account the size limitations.

frequencies**

value could be revised for higher frequencies. NF value shall not be revised
to a value that is higher than the FR2 value.
#### 5.5.1.2 NF analysis for NR BS
Considering recent state-of-the-art LNA-only noise figure publications in [22
-- 27], figure 5.5.1.2-1 presents the LNA-only noise figure for different
semi-conductor technologies over frequency based on published data.
{width="3.6055555555555556in" height="3.0868055555555554in"}
Figure 5.5.1.2-1: LNA-only NF trend over frequency
The typical noise figure values presented in figure 5.5.1.2-1 are based on
assumption of pre-LNA noise figure of \~1.8 dB and per example frequency
calculation of losses such as routing losses, etc.
ETSI has published an update of TR 101 854 [46] on fixed radio systems in
April 2019, which contains a table on typical NF values and associated
industrial margins (IM~F~) of the radio receivers. This table is extracted
below in table 5.5.1.2-1. The IM~F~ considers various performance variations
of system elements over e.g. temperature extremes, voltage variations, or
aging by capturing production spread of RF circuits.
Table 5.5.1.2-1: Typical Noise Figures (NF) and associated Industrial Margins
(IMF)
+----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | Frequency band | Typical Noise Figure (NF) | Industrial margin (IMF) | | | | | | (GHz) | (dB) | (dB) | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 1,3 - 3 | \~4 | +3 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 3 - 5 | \~5 | +3 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 6 - 15 | \~5 | +3 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 18 - 23 | \~6 | +3 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 26 - 28 | \~7 | +3 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 32 | \~7 | +3 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 38 - 42 | \~8 | +3 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 48 - 50 | \~9 | +3 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 52 - 55 | \~10 | +3 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 71 - 76 | \~13 | +4 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+ | 81 - 86 | \~13 | +4 | +----------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+
NOTE: The above ETSI originated Industrial Margins (IM~F~) shall not be
confused with the Implementation Margins (IM) used in process of RAN4
conformance requirements derivation.
It can be seen from the table above that even though this TR is on fixed radio
systems, the NF and IM~F~ values of the radio receivers are similar to those
that RAN4 has adopted for mobile radio systems (considering different margins
for BS and UE). This would be explained by the fact that many underlying
components would be the same in both fixed and mobile radio receiver. Since
this TR has been officially published by ETSI, it is reasonable to use the
data in the table above as references for the typical BS NF over the whole 7
-- 24 GHz rang as shown in table 5.5.1.2-1.
#### 5.5.1.3 NF analysis for NR UE
##### 5.5.1.3.1 General
Receiver architecture (including antenna system) plays an important role in
calculating system NF. At higher frequencies, Active Antenna Systems (AAS)
with antenna arrays and beamforming networks become necessary to compensate
for higher path loss and maintain similar link performance as lower
frequencies [49]. Besides, at higher frequencies, AAS are integrated with the
rest of the receive chain in a way that antenna connectors are no longer
available.
It is well known that phase noise degrades at a rate of \~6 dB/octave with
frequency. Since in a zero-IF architecture, RF LO will be at a higher
frequency compared to a super-heterodyne architecture, it will have higher
phase noise and will contribute more to overall system noise. Note that IF LO
in a super-heterodyne architecture will have its own phase noise contribution.
But degradation of phase noise with frequency combined with other issues
related to generating RF LO for zero-IF architecture at higher frequencies,
generally makes RF+IF down-conversion a more attractive choice at higher
frequencies. On the other hand, a super-heterodyne architecture, even in the
absence of any jammers in the image band, suffers from image band noise and
requires either filtering before the first down conversion or image-reject
downconverter designs.
Other considerations include availability and necessity of analog filters in
RF and their placement in the RF chain.
##### 5.5.1.3.2 Frequency sub-range 1
Zero-IF or direct conversion is the reference architecture for all sub-7 GHz
LTE and NR applications [50] and is likely to be used for Frequency sub-range
1 as well.
NF for a reference 6 GHz TDD system is presented in R4-1904127 [51]. Since the
aim is to compare NF with a single-band mm-wave TDD system, no antenna switch
module for band selection or sub-band duplexing is accounted for. Furthermore,
it is assumed that ADC quantization noise contributes 0.4 dB to the overall
system NF.
But more importantly, the frond-end architecture has a pre-LNA filter for
rejecting out of band jammers and interferers. The presence of filter is
important since in the absence of antenna arrays and beamforming, it is more
likely than not that the UE picks up these types of jammer during field
operation.
"IM" refers to implementation margin of 2.5 dB which is added to account for
process and temperature variations.
Note that some passive technologies such as filters and matching networks used
in FR1, may have degraded performance above 7 GHz [52]. Additionally, the
above calculation assumes a single band UE, which is uncommon in sub-7 GHz.
While further refinement can be at later stages, we propose keeping the same
NF and using a NF of 9 dB for example frequency of 10 GHz. This value is
lowered from the original proposal of 10 dB from [6] due to concerns that the
implementation margin was too high.

##### 5.5.1.3.3 Frequency sub-range 2
The choice of front-end architecture for frequency sub-range 2 is less certain
than for frequency sub-ranges 1 or sub‑range 3:
1\. As far as synthesizer phase noise concerned, frequency sub-range can end
up using either zero-IF or super-heterodyne architectures.
2\. The performance of existing RF connectors is only cited up to 12 GHz [54]
and there may in fact be a breakpoint for current RF connector technologies
[55], forcing Fequency sub-range 2 to use OTA test methods.
3\. If link budget shows that antenna arrays are needed, then beamforming can
provide some level of spatial filtering of jammers and interferers, requiring
less or no filter rejection at all.
4\. Compared to frequency sub-range 3 or mm-wave, array elements and overall
size will increase in this frequency sub-range. For example, while mm-wave can
use a 2x8 array, frequency sub-range 2 may be limited to a 1x4 or smaller
array, reducing the array gain and hence effectiveness of beamforming to
reject jammers
5\. On the other hand, if omnidirectional antennas used instead, filtering
becomes necessary.
In either case, the NF will likely be worse than system NF values proposed for
frequency sub-range 1 and sub-range 3. Hence, for RAN4 standardization work, a
system NF of 10 dB is proposed for frequency sub-range 2. This is reduced from
the value in [6] on concerns that the implementation margin is too high.
##### 5.5.1.3.4 Frequency sub-range 3
In contrast to sub-7 GHz LTE and NR, at mm-wave frequencies, super-heterodyne
architecture can outperform zero-IF architecture due to lower LO frequency and
superior phase noise [50]. Frequency sub-range 3 is more likely to follow suit
and use an RF+IF architecture.
In RF+IF architectures, even in the absence of interferers at image frequency,
the thermal noise in the image band is down converted to IF and contributes to
overall system noise figure. If LNA and down-conversion gain are the same in
desired and image bands, thermal noise in the image band can degrade overall
system NF by as much as 3dB (even though this is unlikely to happen in
practice). Therefore, some mechanism, either in the form of pre-LNA filter or
image reject mixer is necessary to protect the receiver.
While integrated transmission line or LC filters can be used to provide some
rejection of out of band jammers and image band noise, placing then before the
LNA will result in higher NF. Another option is placing the filter after LNA
and before the downconverter. This architecture has better NF but cannot
protect LNA from strong out of band jammers. However, with beamforming, it is
unlikely to have a strong jammer in the direction of beam peak. So it may even
be possible to use no filter at all and use image reject mixer to protect the
receiver from image band noise. System NF calculations presented in the
following two tables are from [51] and are more likely to be used in frequency
sub‑range 3.

While the losses will probably be slightly lower at 20 GHz, in accordance with
approved NF values for FR2 [53], a NF of 10 dB is proposed for frequency sub-
range 3.
### 5.5.2 Power amplifiers
In clauses 5.4.1.1, 5.4.1.2, 5.4.2 and 5.4.3, the PA trends and saturated
output power, PAE trends, AAS power scaling principles and PA dependencies
respectively are described. The analysis resulted in example ACLR values
without linearization of \~33 dB, \~31 dB and \~30 dB for example frequencies
of 10, 15 and 20 GHz respectively. The example ACLR values do not fully cater
for the larger transmission bandwidths likely for spectrum within 7 -- 24 GHz
frequency range and do not include the effects of any possible linearization
applied to the transmitter chain which would have the effect of improving
ACLR.
For 10 GHz example frequency, where an AAS BS may possibly re-use the existing
deployment grid due to propagation condition it would benefit from higher PA
power and high PAE. To investigate the potential improvements achievable from
linearization three different PA's based on GaN technology from 3 different
vendors (vendor A, vendor B and vendor C) were investigated without and with
linearization. The measurements were performed at \~8 GHz for practical
reasons indicating that the measured results will be slightly worse for \~10
GHz.
Due to possible size of spectrum at higher frequencies, the bandwidth of 200
MHz and 400 MHz corresponding to 2 or 4 carriers, each 100 MHz was assumed.
The measurement results of the important characteristics are summarized in
table 5.5.2-1.
**Table 5.5.2-1: Measurement results**
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | | Power (dBm) | PAE (%) | ACLR (dB) | ACLR (dB) | | | | | | | | | 200 MHz / | 200 MHz / | Without | With | | | 400 MHz | 400 MHz | li | li | | | | | nearization | nearization | | | | | | | | | | | 200 MHz / | 200 MHz / | | | | | 400 MHz | 400 MHz | +=============+=============+=============+=============+=============+ | PA vendor A | 35 | 11.7 / 11.5 | 36.2 / 35.5 | 42.1 / 39.8 | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | PA vendor B | 37 / 36 (1 | 12.7 / 12.3 | 26.4/ 21.6 | 38.9 / 29.8 | | | dB back off | | | | | | to reach | | | | | | EVM) | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | PA vendor C | 33 | 16.8 / 17 | 32.7 / 23.2 | 42.8 / 24.3 | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
The measured PAE for different PA's are quite aligned with the PAE analysis in
clause 5.4.1.2. Note that the PAE needs to be further improved in the AAS BS
context given the need for fairly high power at these frequencies.
The result also shows the impact of bandwidth where the achievable ACLR is
lower for 400 MHz bandwidth (which is quite a reasonable bandwidth at these
frequencies), it is not clear if this is a limitation of the linearizer, the
Tx chain or the PA.
Considering the need for a fairly high power and efficiency for these
frequency ranges and the empirical analysis and measurement results, the
achieved ACLR value for 10 GHz example frequency with one example
linearization is around 33 to 35 dB, when the average performance of 200 MHz
and 400 MHz channel bandwidth is considered.
### 5.5.3 Phase noise
#### 5.5.3.1 General
Sufficiently low phase noise at the measurement interface is required to avoid
excessive EVM. Based on the available data [35 -- 40], a descriptive BS phase
noise profile is shown in figure 5.5.3.1-1. It shows performance for base
stations operating in 7 -- 24 GHz range based on current (i.e. as of 2019)
component data. In the figure each colour matches to a single component.
It should be noted that throughout this section phase noise is referred to the
observed level at a measurement interface. Noise levels internal to PLL and
clock distribution network may differ from this and implementation freedom is
not limited as described in clause 5.5.3.2. To account for different reference
source performances a range was set from 100 Hz to 1 kHz where reference
source can be dominant phase noise source, as described in clause 5.5.3.3.
For specific use cases where high data rates are targeted, the performance can
be better as shown by the examples of component data. On the other hand, in
cases where device size, power consumption and low cost are the highest
priorities, the phase noise performance may be worse.

Figure 5.5.3.1-1: A representative phase noise profile for 7 -- 24 GHz base
stations
In figure 5.5.3.1-1 the phase noise profile is shown at 20 GHz example
frequency. To adjust the model to a different frequency, the levels need to be
scaled according to Leeson's equation, i.e. halving the frequency reduces the
noise power to one quarter of the original. When the profile is given at
center frequency f~0~ and a given noise power P~0,~ the correct noise power P
at frequency f equals:
$$P = P_{0}20\log_{10}\left( \frac{f}{f_{0}} \right)$$
, where P and P~0~ describe the full single side-band noise profile for which
the unit is dBc/Hz.
#### 5.5.3.2 LO generation and distribution
Array antenna transceivers may be based on different strategies in
implementation of local oscillator (LO) signal generation and distribution.
Put simply, there are two options:
1\. Centralized LO generation with a single PLL for all transceivers,
2\. Distributed LO generation with one PLL per transceiver.
These are two extreme cases and one could envision a combination of the two
such that the transceivers are grouped together and where the transceivers
within each group shares a common LO generation, i.e. semi-distributed LO
generation.
#### 5.5.3.3 Performance of reference source
To highlight the problem of reference noise increase at lower reference
frequencies due to an increased effective frequency multiplication factor, the
investigation was focused on low power crystal oscillators at about 40 MHz. At
the time of creation of this technical report, there were not as many
publications on crystal oscillator circuits as on PLLs, but the few papers
from recent years in IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits were used to
represent state-of-the-art in CMOS low power crystal oscillators at about 40
MHz.
To span the design space, also the 491.25 MHz crystal oscillator is included
in the table 5.5.3.3-1 summarizing the crystal oscillator performance.

To translate the phase noise into equivalent phase noise at a PLL output, an
amount equal to $20log(f_{\text{PLL}}/f_{\text{ref}})$ dB should be added.
Given the above we assume that the crystal oscillator can be made non-dominant
above 1 kHz offset frequency, and that the PLL output phase noise will have a
slope of -30 dB/decade below that frequency. This is achievable with reference
frequencies ranging from 40 MHz to 491 MHz, and power consumptions below 1 mW,
using CMOS technologies as different as 28 nm and 180 nm.
#### 5.5.3.4 Noise floor
When it comes to the noise floor it is difficult to find published works that
include measurements in this region. Circuit simulations have therefore been
performed to find realistic levels of the noise floor. The noise floor is
typically set not by the oscillator of the PLL, but by buffers and LO
distribution. For this reason, the phase noise of a chain of inverters acting
as buffers was simulated. Three equal sized cascaded inverters were used for
each of the two differential signal halves, where minimum length devices in a
22 nm technology were used. The input signal was 1 V peak differential at 20
GHz, and different width of devices were investigated, corresponding to
different amounts of power consumption. The phase noise is shown in figure
5.5.3.4-1, where the lowest noise floor of close to -170 dBc/Hz was achieved
with a 13.4 mW power consumption, the second-best curve was for 7.5 mW, the
next was 4.2 mW, then 2.4 mW, and finally 1.3 mW. As can be seen -165 dBc/Hz
can be reached at about 5 mW buffer power consumption. Taking attenuation in
the LO distribution network into account, it is reasonable to add some margin
to this level.

**Figure 5.5.3.4-1: Phase noise of simulated differential LO buffers in 22 nm
technology, ranging from 1.3 mW to 13.4 mW power consumption**
### 5.5.4 Correlation of noise and emissions
With a centralized architecture, i.e. same input distributed to one or
multiple transmit antenna connectors or antenna elements, the transmitted
noise and emissions will be essentially the same, i.e. fully correlated. The
primary downside of this solution is that the performance requirements will be
high. When the composite output, the signal transmitted into air is formed by
more distributed architecture, i.e. multiple PLLs, multiple PAs and possible
non-identical input signal due to beamforming, each individual component of
the composite output will be partially uncorrelated. This is beneficial from
an EVM and emission requirements perspective as the noise and emissions
performance is improved up to 10log(M) where M is the number of non-correlated
signals.
This may be used to lower the EVM and emissions performance on the
transmitters when they are specified per antenna connector.
## 5.6 Deployment scenarios
Referring to the previous NR discussions, three high level use cases were
defined for NR: eMBB, URLLC and mMTC. Considering NR operation in 7 \-- 24 GHz
range, the following was observed:
\- eMBB: as 7 -- 24 GHz range is considered to be mostly a capacity booster,
the eMBB is a valid use case for 7 -- 24 GHz range NR operation.
\- URLLC: this use case includes such advanced services like e.g. factory
automation, autonomous driving, and remote surgery, including both indoor and
outdoor case. Therefore, applicability of the URLLC use cases in 7 -- 24 GHz
required case by case analysis, due to potential coverage limitation
restriction.
\- mMTC: this NR use case requires good penetration, including deep indoor and
wide area coverage. Due to propagation characteristics of 7 \-- 24 GHz
frequencies, the mMTC use case is not seen as well suited for 7 -- 24 GHz due
to potential coverage limitations.
Referring to the NR study item, range of deployment scenarios were considered
and documents in TR 38.913 [2], including both FR1 and FR2 spectrum
allocations. NR scenarios from TR 38.913 [2] were analysed for the 7 -- 24 GHz
applicability, considering the carrier frequency assumptions. Additionally,
IAB scenario was included based on related Rel-16 work item.
For the 7 -- 24 GHz deployment scenarios discussion it is valid to consider
their potential dependencies from the existing incumbent users and spectrum
environment in general. Therefore, for each of the potential deployment
scenarios, it is essential to also consider information on the (regional)
incumbent/neighbour systems information.
Below, brief description of the considered 7 -24 GHz deployment scenarios is
captured. It should be noted, that none of the below listed deployment
scenarios is considered to be 7 -- 24 GHz range specific.
### 5.6.1 Indoor hotspot
Indoor hotspot scenario addresses an indoor case with relatively small
coverage, high capacity and high user throughput driven by high density of
low-mobility users. For the NR study, the carrier frequencies of 4 GHz, 30 GHz
and 70 GHz were considered. Therefore, the whole 7 -- 24 GHz range (with all
three frequency sub-ranges being applicable) is seen as suitable for indoor
hotspot scenario. Indoor hotspot scenario is expected to be addressed by the
LA BS class.
### 5.6.2 Dense urban
Dense Urban scenario addresses outdoor and outdoor-to-indoor case in dense
urban, interference-limited scenarios, based on macro grid coverage with
continuous cellular layout, extended with randomly dropped micro sites, i.e.
two-layer layout (i.e. macro + micro). This scenario is characterized by high
user density of low and medium mobility, and high traffic loads. For the NR
study, the carrier frequencies of 4 GHz and 30 GHz were considered.
This scenario is expected to be addressed by the WA and MR BS classes. This
scenario is well suited for CA or DC application.
### 5.6.3 Urban macro
Urban macro scenario addresses an outdoor and indoor case with large cells and
continuous coverage, serving users of low and medium mobility.
For the NR study, the carrier frequencies of 2 GHz, 4 GHz and 30 GHz were
considered. Therefore, the whole 7 -- 24 GHz range (with all three sub-ranges
being applicable) is seen as suitable for urban macro scenario.
The difference to Dense urban scenario is that the Urban macro is a one layer
macro layout.
Urban macro scenario is expected to be addressed by the WA BS class. It shall
be noted, that WA BS class was defined also for FR2 operation.
### 5.6.4 IAB
A diverse range of deployment scenarios can be envisioned for IAB, including
support for outdoor small cell deployments, or indoors. For the IAB
performance evaluation, scenarios addressing outdoor and outdoor-to-indoor
case in dense urban, or urban micro case were considered, based on macro grid
IAB-donor coverage with continuous cellular layout, extended with randomly
dropped micro sites as IAB-nodes, i.e. two-layer layout (i.e. macro + micro).
The IAB WID in RP-193226 [65] also includes the multi-hop IAB network case,
which can be seen as interesting feature to achieve range extensions even at
higher frequency bands of the 7 -- 24 GHz range.
From the propagation point of view, consideration of 7 -- 24 GHz range brings
more challenging scenario due to higher (compared to FR1) attenuation, with
decreased cell range. On the other hand, provision of the LOS backhaul link
from the rooftop donor-IAB node shall alleviate propagation challenge.
Similar, for the multi-hop case of cascaded IAB-nodes, with the inter-IAB
backhauling links being LOS, does not seem to be a bottleneck for the IAB
deployments in 7 -- 24 GHz range. Similar to Dense Urban scenario, the IAB
scenario is characterized by high user density of low and medium mobility, and
high traffic loads. For the IAB study, the carrier frequencies of 4 GHz and 30
GHz were considered for the IAB-donor and IAB-node, respectively. The micro
layer of the IAB-nodes is considered as the capacity layer, where the IAB
study assumed 400 MHz channel bandwidth for IAB-nodes.
### 5.6.5 Summary
Table 5.6.5-1 below summarizes the NR deployment scenarios for the 7 -- 24 GHz
frequency range.
Referring to clause 4.4.2 on the WRC-19 conclusions, one can find the
information on the resolution COM6/18 for the IMT for fixed wireless broadband
in fixed services bands. This resolution refers the Fixed Wireless Access
(FWA) scenario, which can be considered as yet another deployment scenario
applicable to 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range.
Studies on relations and dependencies among the FWA, fixed wireless broadband,
and/or IAB scenarios are considered to be out of scope of this study item,
while all those cases are seen as applicable to 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range.
Other NR deployment scenarios such as high speed train, highway scenario or
urban grid for connected car were also considered during the 7 -- 24 GHz study
item, but no further analyses were provided for those.

## 5.7 NR system parameters analysis for 7 -- 24 GHz range
### 5.7.1 General
In this section, analysis for NR system parameters and background information
on how to determine the system parameters selection is captured. This analysis
and information can be used as guidance on whether FR1 and FR2 system
parameters can be re-used or new system parameters are defined for frequency
sub-ranges within the 7 -- 24 GHz range.
### 5.7.2 SCS
#### 5.7.2.1 General
SCS selection is done within RAN4 according to RAN1's candidate SCS design.
From the RAN4 perspective, the SCS is dependent on the phase noise
considerations and channel impairments, such as delay spread and Doppler
spread. For the mmWave range, phase noise in general is worse at higher
frequencies, therefore for the 7 -- 24 GHz range, phase noise should be
evaluated when selecting the SCS. The cyclic prefix must accommodate the
channel delay spread in which can be a function of implementation and several
frequency dependent factors, including path loss and scattering. The impact of
antenna arrays, such as increased range and beam selectivity, may affect SCS
selection. The SCS selection should consider the effects of Doppler on
demodulation performance and tracking.
#### 5.7.2.2 SCS for SSB
The SCS options for the SSB are generally based on the SCS used for the band
and the specified channel bandwidths in that band. For FR1, a trend is that 30
kHz SCS for the SSB tends to be used as the frequency of the bands increases.
In contrast, the 120 and 240 kHz SCS options for the SSB are allowed for the
FR2 bands.
The selection of the SCS of the SSB can occur once the SCS for the bands in
the 7 -- 24 GHz range and the channel bandwidths are determined.
#### 5.7.2.3 SCS for shared / control channels
The shared and control channels are scalable in SCS. However, the reference
signal considerations for those channels are dependent on frequency range. For
example, in FR2, a phase tracking reference signal (PT-RS) is mandatory. In
addition, the channel bandwidths for bands in the 7 -- 24 GHz range can
restrict the allowed SCS.
### 5.7.3 Channel bandwidth
The maximum channel bandwidth is related to the RF considerations and sampling
rate which is a function of FFT size and SCS selection. Additionally,
depending on spectrum allocation restrictions and operators' request,
additional channel bandwidths may be considered.
From a UE perspective, a requirement to support a large number of channel
bandwidths could increase the UE design complexity and conformance testing
time.
### 5.7.4 Spectrum utilization
Regarding spectrum utilization (SU) perspective, it depends on the Tx emission
mask defined for protecting the adjacent channel and Rx blocking requirements.
Due to a lack of regulatory requirements defined for 7 -- 24 GHz so far, the
SU decision needs to be deferred to the future WI phase.
However, the filter length or implementation difficulty should be taken into
account from both Tx side and Rx side. As the filter length will also have
impacts on the EVM window length, if there are any changes on the SU tables
for 7 -- 24 GHz, then the EVM window requirement should be revisited
correspondingly.
### 5.7.5 Channel raster
There are no refarming bands in 7 -24 GHz range, therefore the SCS-based
channel raster could be adopted for better spectrum utilization, especially
considering the intra-band contiguous CA scenario. Regarding the use of either
15 kHz, 30 kHz, 60 kHz or 120 kHz SCS-based raster for the 7 -- 24 GHz range,
it is dependent on the SCS selection.
### 5.7.6 Sync raster
The following basic principle for the sync raster design could be reused also
for 7 -- 24 GHz range:
sync raster ≤ BW~config~ + channel raster -- BW~SSB~
where BW~config~ accounts for the bandwidth of the operating band, minimum
bandwidth, and guardband, BW~SSB~ is the bandwidth of the SSB.
Once the minimum BW, channel raster and SCS for SSB are determined, the sync
raster for 7 -- 24 GHz range can be determined.
### 5.7.7 Channel spacing
For the channel spacing between adjacent carriers, a formula is used to ensure
nominal channel spacing between adjacent carriers is a multiple of channel
raster. Therefore values of 0, ±(1/3) channel raster are considered on all
possible cases. A similar spacing may be considered for the 7 -- 24 GHz range.
### 5.7.8 Aggregated system bandwidth
Referring to the TR 38.913 [2] on the NR deployment scenarios, values of the
aggregated system bandwidth were linked to the example carrier frequencies
(i.e. 700 MHz, 4 GHz, 30 GHz, or 70 GHz):
  * For the example carrier frequency of 4 GHz the aggregated system bandwidth was considered to be ≤ 200 MHz.
  * For the example carrier frequency of 30 GHz the aggregated system bandwidth was considered to be ≤ 1 GHz.
Considering the above NR aggregated system bandwidth values as approximation
of the corner cases for the 7 -- 24 GHz range, conclusion for 7 -- 24 GHz
range was derived. The range of the the (upper bound of the) aggregated system
bandwidth for 7 -- 24 GHz range is considered to be within 200 -- 1000 MHz
range.
#### 5.7.8.1 Single carrier operation
Based on the comparison of NR operating bands and channel bandwidths with the
widths of 7 -- 24 GHz frequency ranges of interest, it was observed that the
set of Rel-16 NR channel bandwidths (i.e. 5 MHz being the narrowest, and 400
MHz being the widest) shall be sufficient for potential NR applications in 7
-- 24 GHz range. This is motivated by the fact that the largest width of the 7
-- 24 GHz frequency range of interest are significantly narrower compared to
the largest width of Rel-15 FR2 operating band. Therefore, if the set of NR
channel bandwidths is considered as sufficient for Rel-15 FR2 operating bands,
it is also considered as sufficient for the NR operating in 7 -- 24 GHz range.
NOTE: The above does not preclude any additional NR channel bandwidth requests
in future, e.g. based on the operators request motivated by the spectrum
utilization optimisation.
#### 5.7.8.2 Carrier aggregation
As 7 -- 24 GHz range is considered to be a capacity booster due to its
propagation characteristics, a typical envisioned CA scenario is expected to
use component carriers from the 7 -- 24 GHz range as the Secondary Serving
Cells (while the Primary Serving Cells are expected to be allocated in FR1
operating bands). Therefore, carrier aggregation deployment is seen as
suitable and applicable to 7 -- 24 GHz deployment scenarios, considering both
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum allocations.
Referring to the NR UE specification in TS 38.101-3 [19], the inter-band CA
between FR1 and FR2 was also considered in Rel‑15. Such NR inter-band CA case
is including at least one component carrier from FR1 operating band, and at
least one component carrier from FR2 operating band. Extending such CA
arrangement with the 7 -- 24 GHz range, it can be envisioned that the
following inter-band CA combinations could be further considered:
\- FR1 component carrier(s) plus 7 -- 24 GHz component carrier(s), or
\- 7 -- 24 GHz component carrier(s) plus FR2 component carrier(s), or even
\- FR1 component carrier(s) plus 7 -- 24 GHz component carrier(s) plus FR2
component carrier(s).
NOTE: the above is valid irrespective of the future conclusions on potential
FR1/FR2 range extension(s).
Referring to the UE RF feature list [21], UE capability 2-2 (i.e. simultaneous
reception or transmission with same or different numerologies in CA) was
defined. Considering potentially different set of the supported numerologies
among the considered bands in any of the three options above, this UE RF
capability will also be applicable for the inter-band CA with the potential 7
-- 24 GHz range bands.
#### 5.7.8.3 Dual connectivity
Similar to the CA motivation being the capacity booster, the Dual Connectivity
deployment is seen as suitable and applicable to 7 -- 24 GHz deployment
scenarios.
Referring to TS 38.101-3 [19], large amount of inter-band DC configurations
between FR1 and FR2 was already defined in Rel-15, as listed below. It is
expected, that 7 -- 24 GHz range will further extend the list of inter-band DC
configurations.
  * Inter-band EN-DC (E-UTRA/NR Dual Connectivity) including FR1 and FR2, considering configurations up to six bands.
  * Inter-band NR-DC (New Radio Dual Connectivity) between FR1 and FR2, considering two bands configuration.
NOTE: Referring to applicability of minimum requirements in TS 38.101-3 [19],
NR UE that supports inter-band NR-DC between FR1 and FR2 configuration shall
meet the requirements for corresponding CA configuration, unless otherwise
specified.
Referring to the UE RF feature list [21], UE capability 2-4 (i.e. simultaneous
reception and transmission for inter-band EN-DC (TDD-TDD or TDD-FDD)) would
also be applicable for the inter-band EN-DC combinations including 7 -- 24 GHz
range carriers.
# 6 NR UE
## 6.1 NR UE architecture
### 6.1.1 Mixed UE transceiver architecture
Transceiver architecture and technology selection contribute to the overall
system performance. Unlike the FR1 and FR2, the 7 -- 24 GHz range presents
unique challenges to the transceiver architecture that covers the entire
frequency range. Two types of architectures are presented above. Homodyne
architecture was transceiver architecture of choice for frequency sub-range 1
while heterodyne architecture was selected for frequency sub-range 3. The IF
frequency of the heterodyne radio can be selected in 7 - 10 GHz range such IF
section of the heterodyne radio in 10 -- 24 GHz range uses similar circuits as
homodyne 7 -- 10 GHz radio as shown in figure 6.2-1. The 7 -- 24 GHz range may
requires both types to cover the entire frequency range. One possible way is
to apply the homodyne architecture for 7 to 10 GHz range while using
heterodyne architecture for 10 to 24 GHz range. Mixed transceiver architecture
maybe more appropriate for this frequency range since as an integrated device,
transceiver may contain both lower range 7 to 10 GHz homodyne architecture
portion as well as the IF transceiver for a higher range. The transceiver
would share much of the components for the RF/IF section. Additionally, it may
be suitable to extend the 7 to 10 GHz RF transceiver to cover sub 6 GHz range
as well. However, this may add complexity and cost to the UE transceiver.

**Figure 6.1.1-1: 7 -- 24 GHz UE transceiver architecture example**
### 6.1.2 Frequency sub-range 1
The homodyne or direct conversion architecture is widely used in sub-6 GHz,
although it has the drawback on the IQ-imbalance, DC offset and degradation of
transmitted signal resulting in degradation of EVM, the major advantage of
direct conversion architecture is that the image problem is avoided because of
the zero IF, and the requirement of a single LO realization is fulfilled.
Benefiting from the technology improvement on PLL design, real time I/Q
imbalance calibration and DC eliminating technology, the direct conversion
architecture becomes a mainstream architecture utilized by UE. For 10 GHz,
direct conversion architecture is highly possible be used. For LO generating,
one solution is to use transceiver-localized frequency multipliers (xLO) to
generate the target LO frequency by the frequency divider. It may become the
bottleneck for 10 GHz choosing direct conversion.
### 6.1.3 Frequency sub-range 3
For 20 GHz, considering the increased phase noise and difficulties on PLL
design for localized implementation, the UE reference architecture with IF
conversion is highly adopted for frequency sub-range 3. The heterodyne
architecture has an advantage in the phase noise requirements compared to
homodyne architecture, since the phase noise is logarithmically proportional
to the LO frequency having two sources of LO reduce the phase noise of the
system. However, the PLL implementation is also a problem for this frequency
point if direct conversion architecture is adopted.
## 6.2 NR UE requirements classification
NR UE RF requirement type is studied based on the frequency sub-ranges
specified in clause 5.2. The study starts from the feasibility of the current
RF technology and testability, e.g. antenna design, PA trends, filter, IC
process and RF connector for conduct test.
\- For the sub-range 1 (i.e. 7.125 -- f~boundary,\ low~; where f~boundary,\
low~ is within the frequency range 10 - 13 GHz, as in table 5.2-1), conducted
RF requirements (FR1-like) is expected to be defined considering the antenna
size and PA performance shown in clause 5.4.1.
\- For the sub-range 2 (i.e. f~boundary,\ low~ - f~boundary,\ high~; where
f~boundary,\ low~ is within the frequency range 10 - 13 GHz and f~boundary,\
high~ is within the frequency range 16 - 18 GHz, , as in table 5.2-1), PAs
could have the considerable performance as for the frequency sub-range 1 with
advanced IC process, and there is limited space for UE to place more antenna
elements. Depending on the frequency boundaries of the frequency sub-range 2,
more flexibility is envisioned:
\- If frequency sub-range 2 reaches to 16 GHz, the conducted RF requirements
(FR1-like) can be considered,
\- If frequency sub-range 2 reaches up to 18 GHz, the radiated RF requirements
(FR2-like) can be considered,
\- Some combination of both approaches is not precluded.
\- For the sub-range 3 (i.e. f~boundary,\ high~ -- 24.25 GHz; where
f~boundary,\ high~ is within the frequency range 16 - 18 GHz, , as in table
5.2-1), the PA performance (i.e. Psat and PAE) has reduced much compared with
Pas operating below 18 GHz. Beam forming which can provide high directional
gain on EIRP could be considered. The other ramification for the sub-range 3
is whether conducted RF requirement can be applied for this range. Since it is
provided with the acceptable RF connector parameter operating at 26 GHz, the
testability issue can be resolved. For antenna integration, Antenna-in-Package
(AiP) has become an attractive technology for mmWave designs. This antenna
integration technology is part of a System-in-Package (SiP), where the antenna
and other components are designed and manufactured in separate substrates that
are then integrated into the full system's package. The benefit of this
integration type is that it enables separate optimization and substrate
selection for each component in the system. As it is not possible to separate
the antenna from the UE and consider relevant transitions for this level of
integration, OTA conformance testing is required.
The NR UE requirements classification is summarized in figure 6.2-1.

## 6.3 UE RF requirements
### 6.3.1 UE RF technology aspects
The RF requirements for NR UEs are broadly classified based on whether the UE
is tested in the conducted domain ("FR1 like") or OTA ("FR2 like"). With a
mobile phone used as the typical UE example, some clear criteria may be found
to assess the "FR1 like" or "FR2 like" sub-ranges within 7.125 -- 24.25 GHz
regions. Nevertheless, other types of UE (CPE) may also need to be considered
and an exact frequency limit between "FR1 like" or "FR2 like" is harder to
define.
From UE point of view, RF system design must balance several considerations
such as antenna size and polarization, semiconductor NF and phase noise
associated, gain and linearity.
#### 6.3.1.1 Antenna technology
##### 6.3.1.1.1 Beamforming
Figure below shows the equivalent antenna array size in free space conditions
what has been used in earlier co-existence studies and referred among others
in [2]. From this Figure we can see that the antenna module doubles in size
going from 28 GHz to 20 GHz and further doubles at 14 GHz. Some handhelds are
bigger today so it is hard to set an absolute limit for the size and new
antenna implementations may also surface. At the same time, pathloss halves
from 28 to 20 and further halves when moving from 20 to 14 GHz.
**Figure 6.3.1.1.1-1: FR2 type antenna size (free space) vs. operating
frequency**
Another example that also takes the antenna substrate into account is shown
below. Taking the microstrip patch array design as an example, the patch width
and ground plane extension can be calculated based on a common Rogers
substrate: the element dimensions and array length (assuming 4 elements with
half-wavelength spacing) can be calculated, as shown in figure 6.3.1.1.1-2.
{width="4.103895450568679in" height="3.1955129046369204in"}
**Figure 6.3.1.1.1-2: Patch array dimensions vs. frequency**
Antenna size increases at lower frequencies it scales down at higher
frequencies and around 20 GHz the AIP technology is getting feasible and
similar RF architecture as used in FR2 could be used. However, the antenna
size at the highest frequencies of 7 -- 24 GHz range is still larger than
antennas of Rel-15 28 GHz solutions.
It is important to note that for frequencies close to 24 GHz the antenna array
dimensions are similar to the FR2 (24.25 -- 52.6 GHz) array dimensions:
especially if the UE is a multi-band design which co-locates 28 GHz and 39 GHz
antenna arrays in the same volume. Thus, in a handheld UE supporting both FR2
and 7 -- 24 GHz, an antenna array for the upper frequencies in the 7 -- 24 GHz
range competes for physical space in a handset with an FR2 antenna array, and
it is not likely that UE FR2 coverage performance can be traded off to support
beamforming arrays in the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range. As the wavelength
increases with decreasing frequency, the antenna array size becomes
prohibitively large, with the array at 7 GHz approaching a significant
percentage of the entire length of a handset. Thus, from the perspective of
potential array size, a radiated requirement with an antenna beamforming
assumption may be challenging in handset form factor.
Smaller antenna arrays, e.g. 2×1, or individual antenna element could be used.
However, taking the complexity of beam management into account, the benefit
from using a beam steering antenna system with such a small number of elements
need to be understood.
UEs that have possibilities to deploy larger antennas like CPE or cars can
possibly utilize technologies that are not feasible for handheld devices in
this 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range.
##### 6.3.1.1.2 MIMO
Using spatial multiplexing or MIMO antennas offers higher flexibility in terms
of antenna design than antenna arrays, since it does not require specific
antenna radiation pattern, polarization or inter-element distance. Such
flexibility also eases the multi-band antenna design. However, the performance
of spatial multiplexing is limited by the channel property, which requires
that the channel can offer a high number of ranks. In order to the investigate
the possibility of using spatial multiplexing/MIMO antenna system on the UE at
a medium frequency in 7 -- 24 GHz band, a measurement campaign, as described
below was carried out at 15 GHz.
The measurement was carried out in an indoor studio hall, where multiple
objects with different materials exist (see figure below). Two transmit points
(TPs) are mounted on the internal wall of the hall, and the UE is moved along
a closed route within the hall, as shown in figure 6.3.1.1.2-2. Two UEs with
smart-phone form factor and a reference UE are measured in this campaign,
where each of them has four antenna ports. The two UEs with smart-phone form
factor are identical, and are placed vertically and horizontally,
respectively. Each UE is equipped with 4 single polarized antenna elements
which point to four different directions, as shown in figure 6.3.1.1.2-1. The
UE with smart-phone form factor is placed both vertically and horizontally
during the measurement. The reference UE has omni-coverage with dual-
polarization on the horizontal plane. Each TP has two beams with dual
polarizations for each of them.

Figure 6.3.1.1.2-1: The measurement environment in the hall space and the
illustration of the UE antenna radiation patterns at 15 GHz
The measured channel rank is shown in figure 6.3.1.1.2-2. It can be observed
that for such an environment, regardless of the UE antenna configuration, the
rank of the channel is larger than 1 in most of the time, and in more than 60%
of the time the rank of the channel reaches 3 or higher. This measurement
result shows that the possibility that spatial multiplexing through UE pattern
diversity is valid, at least for 15 GHz band. Optimization of antenna design
on both UE and TP side may also further increase the rank of the channel.

distribution
#### 6.3.1.2 Propagation aspect for UE
##### 6.3.1.2.1 Indoor propagation at 15 GHz
In addition to the antenna configuration, the deployment scenario of mobile
networks is limited by the propagation channel as well. From the same
measurement as described above, we can also capture some insight on how to
deploy a cellular network at 15 GHz. The RSRP at the reference UE antennas is
also shown in figure 6.3.1.2.1-1. It can be observed that when the UE moves to
the NLOS region, the RSRP drops about 30 -- 40 dB.
{width="6.695138888888889in" height="2.4763888888888888in"}
Figure 6.3.1.2.1-1: The measured RSRP of the reference UE over the measurement
route in the hall
The user body shadowing effect is also critical. Therefore, we have also
measured the shadowing loss due to the user body blockage at 15 GHz.
Measurements were performed in an anechoic chamber, where a real user was
holding a UE in data mode portrait position. The measured far field radiation
pattern of antenna 2 in the UE is shown in figure 6.3.1.2.1-2. A clear user
body shadowing region can be observed, and a loss due to the user body
blockage around 20 -- 25 dB can be observed in this measurement.
This significant diffraction and shadowing losses due to the objects and user
body will limit the deployment scenario of cellular networks at 15 GHz.

radiation pattern with and without the user
##### 6.3.1.2.2 Outdoor propagation at 15 GHz
For outdoor scenario, buildings can imply a much more dramatic blockage loss
compared to the user body, and thus limit the coverage of the cell. An outdoor
measurement at 15 GHz is carried out in Kista, Stockholm, Sweden, which is an
urban environment with multiple office buildings. The outdoor coverage is
measured with a test system which consists of two transmit points (TPs) and
one mobile terminal. The mobile terminal antenna, installed on top of a van at
a height of 2.9 m (see Fig. 6.3.1.2.2-1), has roughly omni-directional
coverage in horizontal plane. The two TPs are installed on the walls of two
office buildings as shown in Fig. 6.3.1.2.2-1, at a height of 8.5 m (TP1) and
12 m (TP2), with an inter-TP distance of 82 m. Each TP has an antenna with a
maximum gain of 15 dBi, azimuth half power beam width (HPBW) of 90º, and
elevation HPBW of 8.6º. The detail of the measurement and more results can be
found in [47].

TPs' location [47]
Fig. 6.3.1.2.2-2 shows the received signal strength for each TP over streets
and a scanned square. As indicated by the yellow arrows, the coverage within
LOS is quite good where the signal strength is above -65 dBm. However, the
coverage is limited in NLOS conditions where the signal strength quickly
decreases towards the noise floor of the test system, i.e. -75 dBm.

The same scenario as described above has been modelled in order to carry out a
3D ray-tracing simulation including antenna designs in a smartphone form
factor UE device at both 15 GHz and 28 GHz. The radiation pattern of the UE
antennas used in the ray-tracing simulations comes from the measurements of
real mockups. The ray-tracing simulation setup is shown in Fig. 6.3.1.2.2.-3.
The ray-tracing simulation has been verified with measurements as reported in
[48]. The UE antenna configuration at 15 GHz is the same as presented in as in
Fig. 6.3.1.1.2-1, but antenna 3 is not used in here. The 28 GHz antenna
designs are the same, but scaled up to higher frequency. The device is placed
vertically without rotation during the simulation. The ray-tracing simulations
can offer a better dynamic range than the measurements and therefore better
can indicate feasible deployment scenarios.

Figure 6.3.1.2.4-4: The coverage overview with three different antenna design
in a mobile device at (a) 15 GHz and (b) 28 GHz [48]
The simulated coverages with UE antenna 1, 2, 4 at both 15 GHz and 28 GHz are
shown in Fig. 6.3.1.2.4-4, where, in this case, the base station antenna is
simplified as an omni-directional antenna located at the same position as the
TP1 above. Comparing 15 GHz to 28 GHz, it can be observed that the smaller
free space path loss at 15 GHz (5 dB) gives a better coverage in the LOS and
the LOS-NLOS transition regions.
In this ray-tracing simulation, there is neither roughness of the building
surface nor random scatters included. Therefore, the number of multiple
components in the channel is likely to be underestimated. Even so, it was
observed that there is a difference between the three antenna ports in the UE,
especially in the LOS-NLOS transition region. This means there is a large
potential for utilizing spatial diversity gain in the UE to increase the cell
coverage. In addition, for a rich scattering environment (which is likely to
be the case in dense urban micro), the number of multiple components may still
be high, which offers the possibility to use spatial multiplexing to increase
the data rate.
#### 6.3.1.3 RF front end technology
Current RF front-end technology used for > 3.3 GHz TDD bands and Wi-Fi can be
extended at least up to 12 GHz.
GaAs or Si based power amplifier technologies used in FR1 for NR and Wi-Fi can
support up to 1W peak power at reasonable gain thus enabling reasonable peak
currents. Still, some antenna gain via UL MIMO would be preferable as it would
lower the total power and higher EIRP are achieved.
Technology used for LNA and switches are already suitable for both FR1 and FR2
with only more aggressive lithography used at higher frequencies, these can
naturally support any approach within the 7.125 \-- 24.25 GHz range. Below 12
GHz it is feasible that a switch supporting branches for FR1 frequencies would
support one branch up to 12 GHz.
##### 6.3.1.3.1 Active technologies
SOI CMOS is currently the work horse for the switch and LNA RFFE functions in
FR1 for both cellular and Wi-Fi systems. Especially since it associates good
noise figure/Gain and good switch losses/isolation on the same die for the
main antenna Tx/Rx modules and also for the diversity and MIMO antennas Rx
modules. It should be noted that SOI CMOS is also used for PA / SWT / LNA /
phase shifter functions in FR2 with superior performance compared to bulk
CMOS. So the coverage of the LNA and switch functions in the 7.125 -- 24.25
GHz range is only a matter of picking the right node.
In order to illustrate the options that can be picked from, table 6.3.1.3.1-1
recapitulates the key figures of merit for LNA and switches versus nodes in
SOI CMOS:
\- F~max~ in GHz provides a measure of the achievable power gain which is
essential in LNA and PA designs. A ratio of 5 (and preferably > 10) between
F~max~ and the frequency of operation is desirable.
\- R~ON~ * C~off~ in fs is key for switch performance as R~ON~ dictates the
losses in ON state and C~off~ the isolation in off state, the lower the value,
the better and the higher frequency of operation can be targeted.
\- Transistor voltage is important to gage the output power capability for PAs
and power handling for switches. In general, the voltage capability reduces
with higher F~max~ which is consistent with lower output power capability at
higher frequencies of operation.
\- Gain and N~fmin~ at 5 GHz is regularly used as our benchmark for LNA
design, with typical values shown in the table not accounting for variation in
PVT.

CMOS device provides reasonable switches. LNAs can be implemented in either
HBT or CMOS depending on the linearity and NF trade-off. LNA implemented in
HBT has demonstrated NF similar to RF SOI technology. This technology has also
been widely used as a cellular RFFE technology in FR1 and FR2. In FR2 it has
capability to monolithically integrate TDD PA / switch / LNA / phase shifter /
VGA in HBT with 'light' digital functions like control interface, memory, DFX,
etc. in CMOS.
Similar to SOI CMOS, table 6.3.1.3.1-2 illustrates the key figure of merit for
BiCMOS technologies for different nodes:
\- F~max~ * BVCEO provides a measure of power capability and gain for PA
designs. It is a combination of the two first parameters of the SOI CMOS
table.
\- R~ON~ * C~off~ in fs is key for switch performance as RON dictates the
losses in ON state and C~off~ the isolation in off state, the lower the value,
the better and the higher frequency of operation can be targeted.
\- Gain and N~fmin~ at 5 GHz is regularly used as our benchmark for LNA
design, with typical values shown in the table not accounting for variation in
PVT.
\- State-of-the-art low noise transistors in SiGe HBT technology have nominal
minimum NF values of 0.25 dB, 0.55 dB, 0.8 dB and 1.1 dB at 10 GHz, 20 GHz, 30
GHz and 40 GHz, respectively.

voltage is available (12 V), GaAs HBT is on par with GaN which targets higher
power applications like small cells or infrastructure.**
One way to compare the different technologies is to look into achievable
average output power performance for Wi-Fi OFDM at 6 GHz and extrapolate to 12
GHz. The linearity level we would design for is -30 dB EVM which is quite
comparable to 30 dBc ACLR linearity level for NR with CP-OFDM:
\- Bulk CMOS: 16 dBm (3.3 V) [\@xx% peak PAE]
\- SiGe BiCMOS: 24 dBm (3.3-5 V) @ [37.5% peak PAE]
\- SOI CMOS: 20 dBm (3.3 V) [\@xx% peak PAE]
\- GaAs HBT: 26 dBm (3.3 -- 5 V) [\@xx% peak PAE]
\- GaN HEMT: 33 dBm (12 V), similar to GaAs HBT at 5 V [\@xx% peak PAE]
\- For DFT-s-OFDM QPSK output power capability is about 2 dB higher
III-V based Pas have at 10% higher efficiency and >6 dB higher power
capability, when compared to CMOS, which is essential for battery power
especially for applications with significant post-PA losses such as FR1 UE
supporting large number of bands and band combinations.
There is reported evidence that III-V based Pas can be designed inherently
broadband whilst preserving good efficiency, linearity and output power which
will thus address a wide range of perceivable band combinations without
needing too many separate PA devices. ACLR could be better than -35 dB at +26
dBm. The channel bandwidth of III-V based PA can be beyond 500 MHz while the
frequency coverage can be made larger than 40%.
SiGe HBT of BiCMOS has high Ft and F~max~ compared to GaAs HBT. In FR1 band,
PA in this technology has demonstrated performance comparable to that in GaAs
HBT between 3 and 7 GHz. SiGe HBT Pas have high gain and wideband response
because of high Ft/F~max~. Optimization in doping profile has enabled variants
with higher breakdown voltage. In FR1 band SiGe HBT technology based PA have
similar PAE as GaAs HBT for cellular and WiFi applications. At higher
frequency, e.g. 12 GHz, no significant degradation is expected from active
device because operating frequency is significantly lower than Ft/F~max~.
However, some degradation is expected from back-end technology due to higher
substrate losses at higher frequency. Minimum NF of LNA in this technology
lies between 0.25 dB and 0.65 dB in 7 -- 24 GHz range and a 2-stage LNA can
produce small signal gain in excess of 25 dB. TDD switch in RF SOI is better
than that in SiGe BiCMOS. At 12 GHz output power capability may be reduced by
1 dB but for technologies where power gain is reduced, the Power Added
Efficiency (PAE) would suffer as it accounts for the power delivered at the
input of the PA stages. If high power capability (>23 dBm) at 12 GHz is
needed, GaAs and SiGe BiCMOS are the preferred choice to control the battery
current to reasonable levels. At lower power levels, and when further
integration on the die is needed both SOI CMOS and SiGe BiCMOS offer good
performance/integration trade‑off.
III-V pHEMT based LNAs can achieve a NF below 2 dB within the 7 -- 24 GHz
frequency range, while the gain of a two stage LNA can be above 20 dB.
##### 6.3.1.3.2 Passive technologies
LC filters using printed elements in a module or a passive substrate should
also be feasible up to 12 GHz but would require special attention of the
ground design. High Q filtering is limited but diplexing and harmonic
rejection function should be feasible.
Technologies used in FR2 are obviously able to support the 7.125 -- 24.25 GHz
frequency range but at lower frequencies, integrating matching networks and
phase shifters has a significant impact on size and using more advanced
technologies, it may impact the cost negatively.
Although BAW filters are discussed above 10 GHz in literature, above 8 GHz
maintaining high Qs will be difficult as thinner acoustic layer (AlN has a
speed of \~10 km/s) or development of new material or modes would be needed.
With current technologies the piezo + electrodes stack thickness should be
smaller than 1um at 10 GHz. Thus, similar to the frequencies above 3.3 GHz in
FR1, filter performance should be relaxed compared to those used in FDD bands
to be essentially feasible with LC filter, while BAW can still be used to
provide notches at some particular frequencies.
Miniature ceramic dielectric filters or MEM cavity-based filters can operate
in the 7 -- 24 GHz range but are usually too bulky for a smartphone.
Above 7 GHz, the use of discrete passive components like inductors and
capacitors SMTs isn't an option for RF matching and decoupling due to self-
resonance issues. It can still be used for lower frequency like DC supply
decoupling, but it needs to rely on integrated passives technologies like LTCC
or IPD for critical RF passive functions.
Integrated Passive Device (IPD) LC designs are widely used in FR1 to integrate
critical harmonic filters or PA matching. IPD works reasonably well up to 12
GHz provided capacitor Qs are improved, which is feasible by adapting the MIM
(Metal Insulator Metal) capacitor dielectric thickness and/or material. Figure
illustrates an IPD LC filter design at 6-7 GHz providing 40 dB rejection for
cellular bands up to 5 GHz. It is also to be noted that transmission line
designs can also be realized on IPD which allows designs above 12 GHz,
furthermore some of these design techniques are also applicable on the active
dies but with lower Q.

Figure 6.3.1.3.2-1: Simulation of an IPD filter operating at 7 GHz
As an example on the other filter technology simulated S21 of the LTCC filter
is shown in figure below. The insertion loss is less than 2.5 dB for 2 GHz
wide bandwidth and also the stop band attenuations are better than -20 dB at
relative offset of \~5% (0.5 GHz) from the pass band edge. The level of stop-
band attenuation is still far from duplex-filter performance, but it should be
noted that the relative bandwidth of the designed filter is also several times
wider than band-width of the current duplex filters, which is usually no more
than 4% (100Meg/2.5GHz). The achieved attenuations are sufficient for
providing protection for adjacent frequency bands and for protecting own
receiver from interference from these bands. The results shown are based on
the simulations and are not fully taking into account the manufacturing
tolerances and ambient conditions.

For the 7 -- 24 GHz range, single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches are
expected to be used in many occasions of systems. Currently, the III-V based
switch component can achieve reported insertion loss figures of around 1 dB at
30 GHz in FR2. Therefore, an even better performance can be obtained in lower
frequencies. Insertion loss below 0.8 dB with isolation larger than 20 dB can
be achieved by III-V based SPDT switch within the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range.
#### 6.3.1.4 Testability considerations
FR2 UE requirements carry with them an additional layer of complexity
associated with beam management procedures both for the network and the UE,
and additionally antenna array RF architecture for the UE. This complexity
provides a motivation to determine whether conducted UE RF requirements over
the entire frequency range of 7.125 to 24.25 GHz are feasible.
A reasonable starting point for this analysis is in the form of a connector
and probe capability study, as shown in table 6.3.1.4-1.
Table 6.3.1.4-1: Antenna connector and probe capability
+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------+ | Supplier | Connector | Frequency | Insertion | VSWR | | | dimensions | range | loss | | | | | | | | | | (mm) | (GHz) | (dB) | | +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------+ | Supplier A | \2RX demodulation requirements is not feasible for FR1 or
FR2 and will not be feasible in 7 -- 24 GHz range. An assessment of the link
budget in applicable test chambers for the frequency in question is needed to
ensure OTA testability feasibility of demodulation requirements at
sufficiently high SINR at the BS receiver. BS demodulation requirements that
are not OTA tested may still be specified as conducted only. Within these
constraints, demodulation requirements are possibly for any BS type in 7 -- 24
GHz range. Therefore, discussion of further details of the BS demodulation
testing in 7 -- 24 GHz range is deferred to the related future WI._
### 7.2.3 Antenna topologies
The antenna array (AA) consists of _M_ x _N_ x 2 antenna elements (AE) placed
is a certain lattice, arranged in _M_ rows and _N_ columns of cross-polarized
elements. The signals from the AA are mapped in the RDN creating different
antenna topologies, as presented on examples in figure 7.2.3-1. The RDN
mapping is creating sub-arrays, where the radiating characteristics of a sub-
array is different to single antenna elements.

Figure 7.2.3-1: Example RDN mappings
Depending on intended coverage scenarios different types of RDN mappings are
foreseen for the frequency range 7 -- 24 GHz. For _BS type x~FR~-H_ and _BS
type x~FR~-O_ , the OTA RF characteristics defined for requirement set
category H and requirement set category O is declared by the base station
manufacturer in terms of full array capability as well as sub‑array or element
capability, see TS 38.141-2 [6], clause 4.6.
### 7.2.4 Array antenna model
In Table 7.2.4-1, the parameters used by the parameterized array antenna model
are described. Based on AAS base station architecture in clause 7.2.1 (i.e.
the BS type x~FR~-H and BS type x~FR~-O) and deployment scenarios envisioned
for the 7 -- 24 GHz range, different parameter sets are required to model an
AAS base station.

The parameterized antenna model is built around array antenna model where the
element factor, array factor and linear phase progressing is characterized as
described by equations in Table 7.2.4-2.

To conserve complexity the model is created so that the element is gain
normalized, instead of the composite array pattern. As a consequence,
parameters cannot be selected arbitrarily, since parameters are dependent on
each other. The intension with the model is to model absolute gain patterns
correctly without full pattern directivity normalization. To model absolute
gain, parameters must be selected carefully, if not the model produces
nonphysical and incorrect gain response.
When array antenna parameters are selected for the array antenna model it is
preferable to consider physical aspects such as the gain/area relation and
gain/beamwidth relations by checking following aspects in given order:
1\. The considered deployment scenario and coexistence situation will give the
appropriate coverage range requirement for the horizontal and vertical domain.
NOTE 1: For analysis of the NR deployment scenarios considered for the 7 \--
24 GHz range, refer to clause 5.6.
2\. From the coverage ranges and deployment scenario the required antenna gain
can be determined, from which the array antenna geometry can be determined in
terms of number of rows (_M_), the number of columns (_N_).
3\. From the coverage ranges the array antenna steering capability can be
determined in terms element separations (_d~v~_ , _d~h~_).
NOTE 2: The element separations _d~v~_ and _d~h~_ is the distance between
radiating elements in the array antenna. The RDN can be used to create sub-
arrays to optimize coverage. When sub-arrays are modelled, parameters can be
selected to model the sub-array as a radiating element, in this case _d~v~_
and _d~h~_ is the distance between sub-arrays in the antenna array.
4\. From the given array lattice the element parameters can be considered with
respect to the given area for a single element. The element peak gain
(_G~E,max~_) and half power beamwidth product (_ϕ~3dB\ ~_ and _θ~3dB~_) depend
on each other and must be selected together to maintain accurate model gain
response. The element loss (_L~E~_) needs to be included when the element peak
gain is determined. Select parameter values for beamwidth based on the
following two parameters checks:
a. Check the peak element directivity (_D~E,max~_) with the unit area
available for a single element in the array lattice, as described in Eq.
7.2.4-1.
b. Check the peak element directivity (_D~E,max~_) with the half-power beam
width product (_ϕ~3dB\ ~_ and _θ~3dB~_), as described in Eq. 7.2.4-2.
5\. The model gain is guaranteed by an element peak directivity normalization
directivity (_D~E,max~_) described in Eq. 7.2.4-3. The peak element gain
_G~E,max~_ is calculated based on Eq. 7.2.4-4.
The peak element directivity (assuming no losses for a given antenna aperture
area) can be expressed as:
$D_{E,max} \leq 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{4\pi d_{h}d_{v}}{\lambda^{2}} \right)$
(Eq. 7.2.4-1)
Also, the peak element directivity for a given wide symmetrical beam can be
approximated by:
$D_{E,max} \approx 10\log_{10}\left(
\frac{K}{\varphi_{3\text{dB}}\theta_{3dB}} \right)$ (Eq. 7.2.4-2)
, where _K_ is a factor that depends on the element properties. For single
elements with symmetrical large beamwidths, _K = 52525_ is appropriate, while
for sub-arrays with narrower beamwidth characteristics, _K = 32400_ is more
appropriate. Depending on the element characteristics the relation between
element peak gain and the half power beam width product is different as
described in [65].
_To be exact it is recommended to select element parameters, where the peak
element gain is determined by calculating the directivity from a given
geometry including beam widths._ The element directivity can be calculated
based on the pattern described by Table 7.2.4-1 in dBi as:
$D_{E,max} = 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{4\pi\left\lbrack A_{\text{lin}}\left(
\theta,\varphi \right) \right\rbrack_{\max}}{\int_{-
\pi}^{\pi}{\int_{0}^{\pi}{A_{\text{lin}}\left( \theta,\varphi
\right)\sin\left( \theta \right)d\theta d\varphi}}} \right)$ (Eq. 7.2.4-3)
, where _A~lin~(θ,ϕ)_ is defined in linear scale as:
$A_{\text{lin}}\left( \theta,\varphi \right) = 10^{\frac{A\left(
\theta,\varphi \right)}{10}}$ (Eq. 7.2.4-4)
## 7.3 BS classes
The BS to UE minimum coupling loss of each NR BS class as defined in TS 38.104
[5] is the same as that of UTRAN in TS 25.104 [60] or E-UTRA in TS 36.104
[24], while the BS to UE minimum distance of each NR BS class is calculated
using the path-loss formula in TR 25.951 [61]:
$$L = 38.25 + 20\log_{10}\left( d \right)$$
Which is derived from the free-space path-loss formula as in TR 25.942 [22]:
$$L = 20\log_{10}\left( \frac{4\pi df}{c} \right)$$
Where:
\- d is the BS to UE distance in meters,
\- c is the speed of light in m/s,
\- f is the carrier frequency in Hz.
For FR1 studies the carrier frequency was assumed to be 2 GHz. For FR2 it was
decided to use the same definition of BS classes using the same set of minimum
distances and minimum coupling losses as for FR1.
The considered base station classes are Wide Area Base Stations, Medium Range
Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations. The associated deployment
scenarios (as discussed in clause 5.6) for each class are exactly the same for
BS with and without connectors.
For _BS type x~FR~-O_ , BS classes are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 35 m.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 5 m.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to
2 m.
For _BS type x~FR~-C_ and _BS type x~FR~-H_ , BS classes are defined as
indicated below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53 dB.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB.
Considering the 7 - 24 GHz frequency range is between FR1 and FR2 in the
frequency domain, it is logical to use the same set of minimum distances and
minimum coupling losses for the BS classes within the 7 - 24 GHz frequency
range.
## 7.4 BS RF requirements
### 7.4.1 Transmitter requirements
#### 7.4.1.1 Tx requirements overview
Summary of the conducted and radiated Tx requirements specified in Rel-15 for
the NR BS is presented in this clause. More detailed elaboration on the
motivation on selected requirements is provided in dedicated clauses below.
All the findings captured for the conducted requirements in table 7.4.1.1-1
and related clauses below are considered to be applicable to the sub-range of
the 7 -- 24 GHz for which the conducted requirements will be found to be
feasible during related WI.
While radiated requirements are considered to be applicable to the whole 7 --
24 GHz range, their definitions, values and levels may differ across the 7 --
24 GHz range.

#### 7.4.1.2 Output power accuracy
##### 7.4.1.2.1 General
There are currently 3 types of output power accuracy requirement which applied
depends on the BS type:
\- Base station output power
Conducted requirement applicable to _BS type 1-C_ and _BS type 1-H_ normal and
extreme conditions
\- Radiated transmit power
Directional OTA requirement (EIRP) applicable to _BS type 1-H_ normal
conditions only and, _BS type 1-O_ and _BS type 2-O_ normal and extreme
conditions)
\- OTA base station output power
Total radiated power requirement (TRP) applicable to _BS type 1-O_ and _BS
type 2-O_ normal conditions only
In all cases the requirement is a power accuracy requirement in dB which is
applied to a declared power level.
The power accuracy requirements clearly have some interdependency, it has been
agreed that the following relationship exists between the requirements
$${\text{conducted}\ \text{power}}_{\text{accuracy}} \leq
\text{TRP}_{\text{accuracy}} \leq \ \text{EIRP}_{\text{accuracy}}$$
Also the requirements which apply to both FR1 and FR2 BS the accuracy levels
are different implying a frequency dependency, the correct accuracy value for
the 7 -- 24 GHz range is to be determined. The following relationships can
also be stated:
$$\text{EIRP}_{accuracy_ FR1} \leq \text{EIRP}_{accuracy_ 7to24GHz} \leq \
\text{EIRP}_{accuracy_ FR2}$$
$$\text{TRP}_{accuracy_ FR1} \leq \text{TRP}_{accuracy_ 7to24GHz} \leq \
\text{TRP}_{accuracy_ FR2}$$
And by implication:
$$P_{conducted_ ccuracy_ FR1} \leq P_{conducted_ ccuracy_ 7to24GHz}$$
When setting the power accuracy requirements both the impact on the network
performance and the practicality of implementation are considered. The goal of
setting an optimum output power variation requirement therefore is to have a
value which does not make implementation to restrictive but offers enough
control that networks can be planned.
##### 7.4.1.2.2 Conducted output power accuracy
Conducted output power accuracy is applicable to FR1 BS with a conducted
interface. For FR1 AAS BS there is the assumption that BB beam forming
architectures are dominant and hence for both _BS type 1-C_ and _BS type 1--H_
each BB chain drives a single transmitter/PA path. In this case the power
accuracy is dependent primarily on the detector accuracy and the variation
after the detector.
For _BS type x~FR~-C_ , the accuracy of these blocks should be examined once
the operating frequency bands are known.
For _BS type x~FR~-H_ the picture is not so clear as an _BS type x~FR~-H_ may
not be directly related to a _BS type x~FR~-C_ in the same way _BS type 1-H_
and _BS type 1-C_ systems are related in FR1;
\- If the _BS type x~FR~-H_ is based on an equivalent _BS type x~FR~-C_ then
the requirements will be the same as _BS type x~FR~-C_ .
\- If the _BS type x~FR~-H_ is derived from a _BS type x~FR~-O_ system then
the conducted accuracy will need to be investigated in a different manner.
However the _BS type x~FR~-H_ figures are determined however we can state:
$$2.0 \leq P_{conducted_ ccuracy_ 7to24GHz}$$
##### 7.4.1.2.3 TRP accuracy
TRP accuracy is the OTA equivalent of conducted power, however there are some
additional error factors which must be taken into account relating to
variation in loss of passive antenna elements, beam formers, distribution
networks etc.
For FR1 the additional errors were small (\ Interfering signal power level = -174dBm/Hz + 10*log~10~(BW) + NF + ICS
>
> Wanted signal power level = -174dBm/Hz + 10*log~10~(BW) + NF + SNR + IM + 3
> dB
The type of interfering signal is DFT-s-OFDM NR signal and BW is corresponding
to number of RBs and SCS.
25 dBc ICS is used based on 16 dB interference-over-thermal (IOT) and 9 dB SNR
considering the modulation and link level simulation.
For this conducted requirement, the modulation scheme for interfering signal
is assumed as 16QAM and modulation scheme for wanted signal is assumed as
QPSK.
For the OTA requirement, the OTA ICS for FR1 is based on conducted requirement
and an offset of Δ~minSENS~ is used for transferring the conducted requirement
to OTA requirement. However, for FR2 requirement there is no conducted
requirement to be referred to. Hence the OTA ICS for FR2 is derived using the
same equation as for conducted requirement, with additional offset for the
gain G:
> Interfering signal power level = -174dBm/Hz + 10*log~10~(BW) + NF + ICS - G,
>
> Wanted signal power level = -174dBm/Hz + 10*log10(BW) + NF + SNR + IM \+ 3dB
> - G;
14 dBc ICS is used based on the simulation result of IOT with 9 dB SNR and the
worst case is applied.
For radiated requirement, the modulation scheme for interfering signal is
assumed as 16QAM and modulation scheme for wanted signal is assumed as QPSK.
This is the same as the conducted requirement.
##### 7.4.2.7.2 In-channel selectivity for 7 - 24 GHz
For the FR1-like frequency range, the conducted requirements should not be
precluded. Hence, both conducted as well as radiated requirements need to be
considered in the WI phase.
The conducted in-channel selectivity for 7 -- 24 GHz will have to be re-
calculated with the following considerations:
\- The wanted and interfering signal levels of the ICS requirement will have
to be re-calculated to account for an updated NF values and the supported set
of bandwidths. For the wanted signal, the required SNR will be subject to the
simulation campaigns.
\- Similar to the FR1 requirements, BS class specific requirements for
conducted ICS need to be considered in the WI phase.
\- Selection of FRC to be used for the ICS requirement will depend on the set
of supported channel bandwidths and SCS in 7 -- 24 GHz. QPSK can be reused
from FR1.
The throughput threshold (i.e. 95%) to derive the required SNR for the wanted
signal can be reused for 7 -- 24 GHz range.
For the OTA in-channel selectivity the following was concluded:
\- For the OTA ICS, reuse the QPSK for the wanted signal (subject to the
supported channel bandwidths and SCS in 7 -- 24 GHz).
\- For the FR1-like sub-range of the 7 -- 24 GHz range:
\- BS class specific requirements for OTA ICS need to be considered in the WI
phase.
\- The same approach of deriving the OTA requirement from the conducted one
can be reused, i.e. conducted requirement plus Δ~minSENS~ offset for both the
wanted and interfering signals.
\- For the FR2-like sub-range of the 7 -- 24 GHz range:
\- The interfere signal and the wanted signal will be based on specific FRC,
SCS and also the OTA reference sensitivity requirements.
7.4.2.8 RX ACS
The following values of BS ACS and UE ACLR were defined for FR1 and FR2
frequency ranges:
Table 7.4.2.8-1: Overview of Rx ACS requirements for NR
+------+-------+--------------+--------------+-------+ | | FR1 | FR2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | +======+=======+==============+==============+=======+ | | 2 GHz | 24 to 33 GHz | 37 to 52 GHz | | +------+-------+--------------+--------------+-------+ | ACS | dB | 46 | 24 | 23 | +------+-------+--------------+--------------+-------+ | ACLR | dB | 31 | 17 | 16 | +------+-------+--------------+--------------+-------+ | ACIR | dB | 30.86 | 16.21 | 15.21 | +------+-------+--------------+--------------+-------+
To get accurate estimations on the ACIR for the range 7 -- 24 GHz the co-
existence simulations would need to be carried out. It will be done when the
bands are allocated. Based on the values in table 7.4.2.8-1 it can be
estimated that the BS ACS value for 7 -- 24 GHz range operation would be in
the range 24 to 46 dB. The split between UE ACLR and BS ACS should also be
decided on a frequency range specific basis based on the relative difficulty
in implementing each in the BS and UE respectively.
Hence we can conclude that the ACS value for the range 7 -- 24 GHz will be in
the range 24 dB to 46 dB. The exact requirement need to be decided based on
co-existence simulations during the follow-up WI.
#### 7.4.2.9 RX IMD
##### 7.4.2.9.1 RX IMD for FR1 and FR2
The blocking requirements capture the selectivity of the receiver, whilst the
receiver intermodulation given the two interferers condition would capture the
linearity of the receiver.
For FR1 both blocking and RX IMD levels were reused from E-UTRA, for FR2 the
in-band blocking requirements were investigated with blocking simulations. For
RX IMD more limited simulations were performed however the interferer RX IMD
interferer levels were a very similar and 8 -- 10 dB lower than the in-band
blocking levels (under the same assumptions). A level of 8 dB below the in-
band blocking levels was agreed for FR2.
For FR1 the conducted blocking interferer levels (and hence RX IMD interferer
levels) are absolute power levels, for OTA these absolute power levels are
offset by the difference between conducted reference sensitivity and OTA
REFSENS (i.e. Δ~OTAREFSENS~).
For FR2 the blocking interferer levels (and hence RX IMD interferer levels)
are offset from the declared sensitivity value EIS~REFSENS_50M~.
In addition to the level the interferer signal type and BW is also important.
For FR1 a CW and a modulated interferer are used with the modulated signals BW
being 5 or 20 MHz DFT-s-OFDM NR signal dependent on the wanted signal BW. For
FR2 a CW and modulated signal are also used with the modulated signal BW being
50 MHz DFT-s-OFDM NR signal.
##### 7.4.2.9.2 RX IMD for 7 - 24 GHz
The RX IMD is closely related to the in-band blocking, for both FR1 and FR2
the RX IMD levels have been between 8 to 9 dB lower than the in-band blocking
levels. It is likely that the same will be found in the 7 - 24 GHz frequency
range once operating frequencies are known and co-existence simulation
parameters have been defined.
As with the blocking the in-band interference requirements are dependent on
the sensitivity requirements, as the sensitivity is used as a metric of the
receiver performance under interference conditions. The RX IMD requirement for
7 - 24 GHz must therefore be consistent with the methodology used for
sensitivity. The proposed metrics for sensitivity are identified in clause
7.4.2.2.
The RX IMD interferer levels are offset from the blocking levels.
The interferer signal definition are the same for FR1 and FR2 with the
exception of the modulated signal BW, this will depend on the BW's defined for
the operating band and may vary in the 7 - 24 GHz range.
## 7.5 BS EMC requirements
### 7.5.1 General
The EMC requirements for the NR BS and ancillary equipment are defined in TS
38.113 [3], including emission requirements and immunity requirements.
Background on derivation of selected EMC requirements for the AAS BS
architecture was captured in the NR technical report TR 38.817-02 [4].
### 7.5.2 Emission requirements
#### 7.5.2.1 Conducted requirements
Irrespective of the BS architecture (i.e. non-AAS or AAS architecture)
considered for the NR operation in 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range, the following
EMC emission requirements can be directly reused from the existing NR BS
specification TS 38.113 [3]:
\- Conducted emission DC power input/output port
\- Conducted emissions, AC mains power input/output port
\- Conducted emissions, telecommunication port
\- Harmonic Current emissions (AC mains input port)
\- Voltage fluctuations and flicker (AC mains input port)
The only EMC emissions requirement which has dependency on the BS architecture
is the radiated emission requirement.
#### 7.5.2.2 Radiated emission requirements
Based on the discussion on EMC radiated emission requirements for the NR BS,
the following findings are also applicable to the NR BS operation in the 7 --
24 GHz frequency range:
1\. For AAS BS architecture not equipped with connectors the NR BS EMC
approach for _BS type 1-O_ and _BS type 2-O_ shall be reused:
a. EMC radiated emissions cannot be distinguished from the RF radiated
spurious emissions in the OTA test setup, therefore it becomes a single
emission requirement. This requirement is performed by measuring TRP emissions
at the enclosure of the DUT with the transmitters switched ON and not
terminated, radiating the output power subject to the antenna array gain.
b. The measurement is performed at the rated output power.
c. The core requirement shall be captured in the BS RF specification TS 38.104
[5] under the OTA transmitter spurious emission requirement, subject to
radiated conformance test specification TS 38.141-2 [6].
d. Emission limits shall be based on the ITU-R SM.329 [7] recommendation.
2\. For non-AAS BS architecture equipped with antenna connectors the NR BS EMC
approach for _BS type 1-C_ shall be reused.
NOTE: The above summary can be further updated once the decision on the BS
architecture will be taken for the 7 -- 24 GHz operation (e.g. in case the
non-AAS architecture will be excluded).
### 7.5.3 Immunity requirements
#### 7.5.3.1 Common EMC immunity requirements
Irrespective of the BS architecture (i.e. non-AAS or AAS architecture)
considered for the NR operation in 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range, the following
EMC immunity requirements can be directly reused from the existing NR BS
specification TS 38.113 [3]:
\- Electrostatic discharge
\- Fast transients common mode
\- RF common mode (0.15 MHz - 80 MHz)
\- Voltage dips and interruptions
\- Surges, common and differential mode
The only EMC immunity requirement which has dependency on the NR BS
architecture is the radiated immunity requirement.
#### 7.5.3.2 Radiated immunity
As of Rel-15 timeframe, the IEC 61000-4-3 [8] specification defines the
radiated immunity requirement up to 6 GHz. This frequency limit would also
apply to the EMC radiated immunity testing of the NR BS operating in the 7 --
24 GHz frequency range, until any future updates to the IEC specification are
released.
Based on the discussion on EMC radiated immunity requirements for the NR BS
with AAS BS architecture (i.e. no antenna connectors available), the findings
on solutions for the RF Rx chain protection from higher radiated power levels
in the OTA test chamber are considered to be also applicable to the NR
operation in the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range. The following alternative
solutions are applicable to NR BS for the purposes of the RF chain protection
during the EMC radiated immunity testing:
\- Spatial exclusion zone, as described in TS 38.113 [3], clause 9.2,
\- Extended frequency exclusion, as described in TS 38.113 [3], clause 4.4.2.
###### ### Annex A (informative): Example filter characteristics
# A.1 20 GHz example frequency filtering
## A.1.1 General
The filter characteristics and needed guard for state-of-the art LTCC
technology and PCB integrated filter providing Q value around 200 and 120
respectively at 20 GHz is further investigated in this annex. It should be
noted that LTCC is more difficult to integrate than PCB integrated filters.
Manufacturing tolerances and temperature drift will have a significant impact
on performance and must be accounted for by addition of a sufficient design
margin. It is assumed that individual tuning of filters, which is done in many
applications, is not feasible for array antennas operating at 20 GHz due to
the large amount, small size, and compact integration into an array without
test ports. A frequency tolerance around 250 MHz is assumed (i.e. the
frequency at which a filter provides the desired suppression can differ from a
nominal value by maximum 250 MHz), which represents what is achievable for
state-of-the-art LTCC filters. PCB integrated filters will generally need to
allow for a worse frequency tolerance than LTCC filters. It is for simplicity
assumed that the frequency tolerance appears as a plain frequency shift of the
filter characteristic by +/-250 MHz for LTCC filters in the worst case. This
corresponds to a case in which all resonators have the same frequency error.
In general, though errors will be uncorrelated to a certain degree and the
tolerance may not be quite as bad as this worst case.
Although the use of transmission zeros in general tends improve steepness of a
filter, the use of zeros has not been assumed in this example since it
increases the sensitivity to frequency errors and can even lead to worse
performance if the frequency tolerance is large compared to the size of the
guard band.
## A.1.2 LTCC example filter
An equivalent model based on RLC-resonators was used to estimate the
performance of an LTCC filter. The filter is assumed to be tuned under the
following conditions:
\- Q = 200
\- 250 MHz margin to frequency shift

Figure A.1.2-1: Estimated characteristics of a bandpass filter based on LTCC
for example frequency of 20 GHz
Considering a tolerance/drift-related frequency shift of +/-250 MHz for LTCC
filters, approximate estimates of the guard and insertion loss that would need
to be allowed for if the filter would be implemented and the assumed amount of
suppression would be required are:
  * Guard band: \~1.1 GHz
  * Insertion loss: \~3.5 dB (at edges, with worst case frequency error)
## A.1.3 PCB integrated example filter
For PCB integrated filters due to lower achievable Q-values compared to LTCC
technology and worse frequency tolerance, the guard is expected to be larger.
Typical characteristics of such filters can be found by looking at the
following design example:
\- 5-pole, coupled line, strip-line filter
\- Permittivity: 3.4
\- Dielectric thickness: 500 μm (ground to ground)
\- Unloaded Q: 120 (using low loss microwave laminate/prepreg)

Figure A.1.3-1: Layout of a strip line filter in PCB technology
The filter is assumed to be tuned for 16 dB return loss in the nominal case.
Margins are added to make room for variations in the manufacturing processes
of the PCB according to the following assumptions:
\- Tolerance on permittivity: 1.5 % (min/max with uniform distribution).
\- Tolerance on line width: 20 μm (min/max with uniform distribution).
\- Tolerance on thickness of dielectric: 7 % (min/max with uniform
distribution).
The resulting filter performance is shown in figure A.1.2-2 for the nominal
case (without variations). Dashed pink lines represent suggested requirement
levels for a PCB-based filter. Note that for this type of requirement it is
necessary to relax the required attentuation to 20 dB, compared to 25 dB for
LTCC.

iterations was conducted. Result are shown in figure A.1.3-3, in which the

Figure A.1.3-3: Estimated S21 representing transmission (left) and S11
representing return loss (right) of a bandpass filter based on PCB-technology,
taking fabrication tolerances into account
From this design example, estimates of key parameters for a PCB implementation
are as follows:
\- About 4 dB insertion loss at the band edge.
\- About 500 MHz frequency variation.
\- About 1.5-2 GHz guard band to get 20-25 dB suppression respectively.
\- Size: 25 mm^2^. This can be difficult to fit if there is one filter per
antenna element.
\- Return loss is relatively poor for many of the filters.
Several aspects were not considered in this analysis:
\- Temperature drift will lead to additional shift of the pass-band, mainly
through a change in the dielectric constant.
\- Some of the randomly picked filters will violate the suggested requirement
limits. The impact of this violation on the sum of unwanted emissions from all
branches (and filters) will depend on the exact distribution of the set of
filters used in a certain radio. For simplicity it was assumed that there is
no correlation between different filters in a certain radio. This is an over-
simplification in many cases.
\- The use of transmission zeroes will improve steepness but may on the other
hand increase tolerance sensitivity.
\- Comparing to previously reported results for filters at 26.5 GHz these
results are similar. When comparing one should note that the ratio between
guard band and pass-band for the 26.5 GHz results is smaller in the 20 GHz
case, and that more than 20 dB is targeted at 20 GHz.
In summary, approximate estimates of key parameters are:
\- Guard band: \~1.5 - 2 GHz for 20 - 25 dB suppression
\- Insertion loss: \~4.0 dB (at edges, with worst case frequency error)
Given the analysis for 20 GHz example frequency, the filter performance is
quite similar to what was observed during NR Rel-15 for mm-wave filter
analysis.
# A.2 15 GHz example frequency filtering
For 15 GHz example frequency considering the assumed attenuation requirements
of 30 dB, two example 6 pole LTCC filters with bandwidth of 1 GHz and 1.5 GHz
respectively were analyzed, assuming a Q-value of 190, and a tolerance/drift
related frequency shift of 1 % (150 MHz). Two transmission zeros were used in
an attempt to minimize the guard band. One should be aware that transmission
zeroes tend to increase the sensitivity to manufacturing errors and may
require more margin for tolerance/drift related frequency shift than what was
assumed here. Requiring a worst-case insertion loss of 3 dB (at the band edge
for a worst-case batch translation of the pass-band) the required guard band
is around 0.6 GHz in both cases. The filter response of the two example
filters is presented in figure A.2-1.

Figure A.2-1: Estimated characteristics of a bandpass filter based on LTCC for
example frequency of 15 GHz, 1.0 GHz bandwidth (left) and 1.5 GHz bandwidth
(right)
As shown in figure A.2-1, the key characteristics for the two example filters
are as following:
\- Guard is \~0.6 GHz, and
\- Insertion losses are \~3 dB.
# A.3 10 GHz example frequency filtering
For 10 GHz example frequency considering the assumed attenuation requirements
of 40 dB, several example filters were investigated with Q-value of 150, 300
and 600, without considering any particular technology. An attempt was first
made to meet very sharp slopes to handle a 0.2 GHz guard band, and achieve 2
dB insertion loss, and tested filter with 8 poles and 2 transmission zeroes,
with bandwidths of 0.6 GHz and 1 GHz. Figure A.3-1 shows the result of this
investigation. Different traces in the plots correspond to different Q-values.
For 0.6 GHz bandwidth it would require a Q-value of 600, or actually 1000 to
get the insertion loss down to 2 dB, and a frequency tolerance better than 60
MHz. For 1 GHz bandwidth the result is similar, except that the mid band
insertion loss is somewhat lower, while the required tolerances are even
tighter. From this investigation it appears that it is not feasible to have
0.2 GHz guard at 10 GHz with any established technology that is suitable in
array systems.

Figure A.3-1: Principle investigation of what it would take to achieve a 0.2
GHz guard band, indicating that it is not feasible, neither for 0.6 GHz
bandwidth (left) nor for 1 GHz bandwidth (right)
As a next step the guard band was increased to 0.5 GHz, and look at 6 pole
filter with 2 transmission zero with bandwidth of 1 GHz. This gives the filter
response shown in figure A.3-2. It is found that a frequency tolerance better
than 1 % (100 MHz) is required, and that the worst-case insertion loss is
close to 5 dB for a Q-value of 150 (the lowest blue trace). This is roughly
what could potentially be achieved with an LTCC filter in best case. Note that
the insertion loss does not meet the goal. To get the worst-case insertion
loss down to desired 2 dB one would have to find an implementation that
provides a Q-value better than approximately 400, which is very challenging in
array systems.

Figure A.3-2: Estimated characteristics of a LTCC filter with 1 GHz bandwidth
and 0.5 GHz guard band, for example frequency of 10 GHz
As a final step, filters with bandwidth increased to 2 GHz, still assuming 0.5
GHz and attenuation of 40 dB, were investigated, one 6-pole filter and one
8-pole filter. 2 transmission zeroes were used in both cases. The filter
characteristics are presented in figure A.3-3. The 6-pole filter requires a
frequency tolerance of 50 MHz, and a Q-value around 300 to get 2 dB insertion
loss in worst case, while the 8-pole filter requires a frequency tolerance of
1% (100 MHz), and the same Q-value. According to these estimations, a LTCC
filter could potentially achieve roughly the performance for the 8-pole
filter, for the case with a Q of 150, and would give up to 4 dB insertion loss
in worst case (at edge of the band for the worst sample/batch of filters).

Figure A.3-3: Estimated characteristics of a 2 GHz bandpass filter based on
LTCC for example frequency of 10 GHz, 6-poles /zero (left) and 8-pole /2 zero
(right)
The above predictions would have to be verified in experiments, considering
the uncertainty regarding impact of manufacturing tolerances, temperature
drift, and insertion loss.
One should also note that the degradation in return loss that appears due to
tolerance errors was ignored, especially for uncorrelated errors. This effect
can be significant but is difficult to model in a general and simple way.
Additional margins in terms of guard band should be considered to handle this.
To summarize, the following was observed:
\- A guard band of 0.2 GHz appears un-realistic for 10 GHz, for LTCC and PCB-
integrated stripline filters regardless of passband bandwidth, due to the
extreme requirements on frequency tolerance, and Q-value.
\- A guard band of 0.5 GHz is potentially feasible with a LTCC filter,
preferably with a relatively large bandwidth, around 1-2 GHz, in order to keep
insertion loss down below 4 dB close to the band edges.
Manufacturing tolerances and temperature drift will have a significant impact
on performance and must be accounted for by addition of sufficient design
margin.
In summary, the filter examples investigated, imply the need to have
sufficient guard-band taking to account the tolerances and drift in frequency
due to e.g. temperature etc.
