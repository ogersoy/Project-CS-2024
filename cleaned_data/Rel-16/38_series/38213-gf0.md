# 4 Synchronization procedures
## 4.1 Cell search
Cell search is the procedure for a UE to acquire time and frequency
synchronization with a cell and to detect the physical layer Cell ID of the
cell.
A UE receives the following synchronization signals (SS) in order to perform
cell search: the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and secondary
synchronization signal (SSS) as defined in [4, TS 38.211].
A UE assumes that reception occasions of a physical broadcast channel (PBCH),
PSS, and SSS are in consecutive symbols, as defined in [4, TS 38.211], and
form a SS/PBCH block. The UE assumes that SSS, PBCH DM-RS, and PBCH data have
same EPRE. The UE may assume that the ratio of PSS EPRE to SSS EPRE in a
SS/PBCH block is either 0 dB or 3 dB. If the UE has not been provided
dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE may assume that the ratio of PDCCH
DMRS EPRE to SSS EPRE is within -8 dB and 8 dB when the UE monitors PDCCHs for
a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, or RA-RNTI.
For a half frame with SS/PBCH blocks, the first symbol indexes for candidate
SS/PBCH blocks are determined according to the SCS of SS/PBCH blocks as
follows, where index 0 corresponds to the first symbol of the first slot in a
half-frame.
\- Case A - 15 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have
indexes of .
\- For operation without shared spectrum channel access:
\- For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz, .
\- For carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz, .
\- For operation with shared spectrum channel access, as described in [15, TS
37.213], $n = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4$_._
\- Case B - 30 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have
indexes . For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz, . For
carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz, .
\- Case C - 30 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have
indexes .
\- For operation without shared spectrum channel access
\- For paired spectrum operation
\- For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz, . For carrier
frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz, .
\- For unpaired spectrum operation
\- For carrier frequencies smaller than 1.88 GHz, . For carrier frequencies
within FR1 equal to or larger than 1.88 GHz, .
\- For operation with shared spectrum channel access, $n = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\
5,\ 6,\ 7,\ 8,\ 9$_._
\- Case D - 120 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks
have indexes . For carrier frequencies within FR2, $n = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 5,\
6,\ 7,\ 8,\ 10,\ 11,\ 12,\ 13,\ 15,\ 16,\ 17,\ 18$.
\- Case E - 240 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks
have indexes . For carrier frequencies within FR2, $n = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 5,\
6,\ 7,\ 8$.
From the above cases, if the SCS of SS/PBCH blocks is not provided by
_ssbSubcarrierSpacing_ , the applicable cases for a cell depend on a
respective frequency band, as provided in [8-1, TS 38.101-1] and [8-2, TS
38.101-2]. A same case applies for all SS/PBCH blocks on the cell. If a 30 kHz
SS/PBCH block SCS is indicated by _ssbSubcarrierSpacing_ , Case B applies for
frequency bands with only 15 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS as specified in [8-1, TS
38.101-1], and the case specified for 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS in [8-1, TS
38.101-1] applies for frequency bands with 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS or both 15
kHz and 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS as specified in [8-1, TS 38.101-1]. For a UE
configured to operate with carrier aggregation over a set of cells in a
frequency band of FR2 or with frequency-contiguous carrier aggregation over a
set of cells in a frequency band of FR1, if the UE is provided SCS values by
_ssbSubcarrierSpacing_ for receptions of SS/PBCH blocks on any cells from the
set of cells, the UE expects the SCS values to be same.
The candidate SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame are indexed in an ascending order
in time from 0 to ${\overline{L}}_{\max} - 1$_, where_ ${\overline{L}}_{\max}$
is determined according to SS/PBCH block patterns for Cases A through E.
$L_{\max}$ is a maximum number of SS/PBCH block indexes in a cell, and the
maximum number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks within a half frame is
$L_{\max}$.
_\- For_ operation without shared spectrum channel access, $L_{\max} =
{\overline{L}}_{\max}\ $
\- For operation with shared spectrum channel access, $L_{\max} = 8$ for
${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 10$ and 15 kHz SCS of SS/PBCH blocks and for
${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 20$ and 30 kHz SCS of SS/PBCH blocks
For ${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 4$, a UE determines the 2 LSB bits of a candidate
SS/PBCH block index per half frame from a one-to-one mapping with an index of
the DM-RS sequence transmitted in the PBCH as described in [4, TS 38.211].
For ${\overline{L}}_{\max} > 4$, a UE determines the 3 LSB bits of a candidate
SS/PBCH block index per half frame from a one-to-one mapping with an index of
the DM-RS sequence transmitted in the PBCH as described in [4, TS 38.211]
\- for ${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 10$, the UE determines the 1 MSB bit of the
candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bit ${\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} + 7}$
as described in [5, TS 38.212]
\- for ${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 20$, the UE determines the 2 MSB bits of the
candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bits ${\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} +
6},{\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} + 7}$ as described in [5, TS 38.212]
\- for ${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 64$, the UE determines the 3 MSB bits of the
candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bits ${\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} +
5},{\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} + 6},{\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} + 7}$ as described in [5, TS
38.212]
A UE can be provided per serving cell by _ssb-periodicityServingCell_ a
periodicity of the half frames for reception of the SS/PBCH blocks for the
serving cell. If the UE is not configured a periodicity of the half frames for
receptions of the SS/PBCH blocks, the UE assumes a periodicity of a half
frame. A UE assumes that the periodicity is same for all SS/PBCH blocks in the
serving cell.
For initial cell selection, a UE may assume that half frames with SS/PBCH
blocks occur with a periodicity of 2 frames.
For operation without shared spectrum channel access, an SS/PBCH block index
is same as a candidate SS/PBCH block index.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that
transmission of SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame is within a discovery burst
transmission window that starts from the first symbol of the first slot in a
half-frame. The UE can be provided per serving cell by
_discoveryBurstWindowLength_ a duration of the discovery burst transmission
window. If _discoveryBurstWindowLength_ is not provided, the UE assumes that
the duration of the discovery burst transmission window is a half frame. For a
serving cell, the UE assumes that a periodicity of the discovery burst
transmission window is same as a periodicity of half frames for receptions of
SS/PBCH blocks in the serving cell. The UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH
blocks indicated by _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ may be transmitted within the
discovery burst transmission window and have candidate SS/PBCH blocks indexes
corresponding to SS/PBCH block indexes provided by _ssb-PositionsInBurst_. If
MSB $k$, $k \geq 1$, of _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ is set to 1, the UE assumes
that SS/PBCH block(s) within the discovery burst transmission window with
candidate SS/PBCH block index(es) corresponding to SS/PBCH block index equal
to $k - 1$ may be transmitted; if MSB $k$ is set to 0, the UE assumes that the
SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that SS/PBCH
blocks in a serving cell that are within a same discovery burst transmission
window or across discovery burst transmission windows are quasi co-located
with respect to average gain, quasi co-location \'typeA\' and \'typeD\'
properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if a value of $\left( N_{\text{DM}
- \text{RS}}^{\text{PBCH}}\text{mod}N_{\text{SSB}}^{\text{QCL}} \right)$ is
same among the SS/PBCH blocks. $N_{\text{DM} - \text{RS}}^{\text{PBCH}}$ is an
index of a DM-RS sequence transmitted in a PBCH of a corresponding SS/PBCH
block, and $N_{\text{SSB}}^{\text{QCL}}$ is either provided by _ssb-
PositionQCL_ or, if _ssb-PositionQCL_ is not provided, obtained from a _MIB_
provided by a SS/PBCH block according to Table 4.1-1 with $k_{\text{SSB}}  23$ for FR1 or if $k_{\text{SSB}} > 11$ for
FR2; the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set may be provided by _PDCCH-
ConfigCommon_.
For a serving cell without transmission of SS/PBCH blocks, a UE acquires time
and frequency synchronization with the serving cell based on receptions of
SS/PBCH blocks on the PCell, or on the PSCell, or on an SCell if applicable as
described in [10, TS 38.133], of the cell group for the serving cell.
## 4.2 Transmission timing adjustments
A UE can be provided a value of a timing advance offset for a serving cell by
_n-TimingAdvanceOffset_ for the serving cell. If the UE is not provided _n-
TimingAdvanceOffset_ for a serving cell, the UE determines a default value of
the timing advance offset for the serving cell as described in [10, TS
38.133].
If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell, a same timing
advance offset value applies to both carriers.
Upon reception of a timing advance command for a TAG, the UE adjusts uplink
timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmission on all the serving cells in the TAG
based on a value that the UE expects to be same for all the serving cells in
the TAG and based on the received timing advance command where the uplink
timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmissions is the same for all the serving cells
in the TAG.
For a band with synchronous contiguous intra-band EN-DC in a band combination
with non-applicable maximum transmit timing difference requirements as
described in Note 1 of Table 7.5.3-1 of [10, TS 38.133], if the UE indicates
_ul-TimingAlignmentEUTRA-NR_ as \'required\' and uplink transmission timing
based on timing adjustment indication for a TAG from MCG and a TAG from SCG
are determined to be different by the UE, the UE adjusts the transmission
timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmission on all serving cells part of the band
with the synchronous contiguous intra-band EN-DC based on timing adjustment
indication for a TAG from a serving cell in MCG in the band. The UE is not
expected to transmit a PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH in one CG when the PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH is
overlapping in time, even partially, with random access preamble transmitted
in another CG.
For a SCS of kHz, the timing advance command for a TAG indicates the change of
the uplink timing relative to the current uplink timing for the TAG in
multiples of . The start timing of the random access preamble is described in
[4, TS 38.211].
A timing advance command [11, TS 38.321] in case of random access response or
in an absolute timing advance command MAC CE, , for a TAG indicates values by
index values of = 0, 1, 2, ..., 3846, where an amount of the time alignment
for the TAG with SCS of kHz is . is defined in [4, TS 38.211] and is relative
to the SCS of the first uplink transmission from the UE after the reception of
the random access response or absolute timing advance command MAC CE.
In other cases, a timing advance command [11, TS 38.321], , for a TAG
indicates adjustment of a current value, , to the new value, , by index values
of = 0, 1, 2,..., 63, where for a SCS of kHz, .
If a UE has multiple active UL BWPs, as described in clause 12, in a same TAG,
including UL BWPs in two UL carriers of a serving cell, the timing advance
command value is relative to the largest SCS of the multiple active UL BWPs.
The applicable value for an UL BWP with lower SCS may be rounded to align with
the timing advance granularity for the UL BWP with the lower SCS while
satisfying the timing advance accuracy requirements in [10, TS 38.133].
Adjustment of an value by a positive or a negative amount indicates advancing
or delaying the uplink transmission timing for the TAG by a corresponding
amount, respectively.
For a timing advance command received on uplink slot and for a transmission
other than a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant or a fallbackRAR UL grant as
described in clause 8.2A or 8.3, or a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in
response to a successRAR as described in clause 8.2A, the corresponding
adjustment of the uplink transmission timing applies from the beginning of
uplink slot where , is a time duration in msec of symbols corresponding to a
PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-
RS is configured, is a time duration in msec of symbols corresponding to a
PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 [6, TS 38.214], is the
maximum timing advance value in msec that can be provided by a TA command
field of 12 bits, is the number of slots per subframe, and is the subframe
duration of 1 msec. and are determined with respect to the minimum SCS among
the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all uplink carriers in the TAG and of
all configured DL BWPs for the corresponding downlink carriers. For , the UE
assumes [6, TS 38.214]. Slot and are determined with respect to the minimum
SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all uplink carriers in the
TAG. is determined with respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all
configured UL BWPs for all uplink carriers in the TAG and for all configured
initial UL BWPs provided by _initialUplinkBWP_. The uplink slot is the last
slot among uplink slot(s) overlapping with the slot(s) of PDSCH reception
assuming $T_{\text{TA}} = 0$, where the PDSCH provides the timing advance
command and $T_{\text{TA}}$ is defined in [4, TS 38.211].
If a UE changes an active UL BWP between a time of a timing advance command
reception and a time of applying a corresponding adjustment for the uplink
transmission timing, the UE determines the timing advance command value based
on the SCS of the new active UL BWP. If the UE changes an active UL BWP after
applying an adjustment for the uplink transmission timing, the UE assumes a
same absolute timing advance command value before and after the active UL BWP
change.
If the received downlink timing changes and is not compensated or is only
partly compensated by the uplink timing adjustment without timing advance
command as described in [10, TS 38.133], the UE changes accordingly.
If two adjacent slots overlap due to a TA command, the latter slot is reduced
in duration relative to the former slot.
## 4.3 Timing for secondary cell activation / deactivation
With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, when a UE receives in a PDSCH
an activation command [11, TS 38.321] for a secondary cell ending in slot _n_
, the UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later than
the minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133] and no earlier than slot ,
except for the following:
\- the actions related to CSI reporting on a serving cell that is active in
slot
\- the actions related to the _sCellDeactivationTimer_ associated with the
secondary cell [11, TS 38.321] that the UE applies in slot
\- the actions related to CSI reporting on a serving cell which is not active
in slot that the UE applies in the earliest slot after in which the serving
cell is active.
The value of is ${m + 3\ N}_{\text{slot}}^{\text{subframe},\mu} + 1$ where
slot _n_ +_m_ is a slot indicated for PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK
information for the PDSCH reception as described in clause 9.2.3 and is a
number of slots per subframe for the SCS configuration of the PUCCH
transmission as defined in [4, TS 38.211].
With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, if a UE receives a
deactivation command [11, TS 38.321] for a secondary cell ending in slot , the
UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later than the
minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133]_, except_ for the actions
related to CSI reporting on an activated serving cell which the UE applies in
slot _._
If _the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the secondary cell expires_ in
slot , the UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later
than the minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133]_, except_ for the
actions related to CSI reporting on an activated serving cell which the UE
applies in the first slot that is after slot where is the SCS configuration
for PDSCH reception on the secondary cell.
# 5 Radio link monitoring
The downlink radio link quality of the primary cell is monitored by a UE for
the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/in-sync status to higher layers. The UE
is not required to monitor the downlink radio link quality in DL BWPs other
than the active DL BWP, as described in clause 12, on the primary cell. If the
active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET
multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause 13, the UE is expected to
perform RLM using the associated SS/PBCH block when the associated SS/PBCH
block index is provided by _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_.
If the UE is configured with a SCG, as described in [12, TS 38.331], and the
parameter _rlf-TimersAndConstants_ is provided by higher layers and is not set
to release, the downlink radio link quality of the PSCell of the SCG is
monitored by the UE for the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/in-sync status
to higher layers. The UE is not required to monitor the downlink radio link
quality in DL BWPs other than the active DL BWP on the PSCell.
A UE can be configured for each DL BWP of a SpCell [11, TS 38.321] with a set
of resource indexes, through a corresponding set of _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ ,
for radio link monitoring by _failureDetectionResources_. The UE is provided
either a CSI-RS resource configuration index, by _csi-RS-Index_ , or a SS/PBCH
block index, by _ssb-Index_. The UE can be configured with up to
_RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ for link recovery procedures, as described in clause
6, and for radio link monitoring. From the _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ , up to
_RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ can be used for radio link monitoring depending on
$L_{\max}\ $ as described in _Table 5-1, wherein_ $L_{\max}$ is as defined in
_clause 4.1_ , and up to two _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ can be used for link
recovery procedures.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, when a UE is provided a
SS/PBCH block index by _ssb-Index_ , the UE is expected to perform radio link
monitoring using SS/PBCH block(s) in the discovery burst transmission window
as described in clause 4.1, where the SS/PBCH block(s) have candidate SS/PBCH
block index(es) corresponding to SS/PBCH block index provided by _ssb-Index_.
If the UE is not provided _RadioLinkMonitoringRS and the UE is provided for
PDCCH receptions TCI states that include one or more of a CSI-RS_
\- the UE uses for radio link monitoring the RS provided for the active TCI
state for PDCCH _reception_ if the active TCI state for PDCCH reception
includes only one RS
\- if the active TCI state for PDCCH reception includes two RS, the UE expects
that one RS is configured with _qcl-Type_ set to \'typeD\' [6, TS 38.214] and
the UE uses the RS configured with _qcl-Type_ set to \'typeD\' for radio link
monitoring; the UE does not expect both RS to be configured with _qcl-Type_
set to \'typeD\'
\- the UE is not required to use for radio link monitoring an aperiodic or
semi-persistent RS
\- For , the UE selects the RS provided for active TCI states for PDCCH
receptions in CORESETs associated with the search space sets in an order from
the shortest monitoring periodicity. If more than one CORESETs are associated
with search space sets having same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines
the order of the CORESET from the highest CORESET index as described in clause
10.1.
A UE does not expect to use more than _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ for radio link
monitoring when the UE is not provided _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_.
Values of and for different values of are given in Table 5-1.
Table 5-1: and as a function of _maximum number_ _of SS/PBCH blocks per half
frame_
* * *
4 2 2 8 6 4 64 8 8
For a CSI-RS resource configuration, _powerControlOffsetSS_ is not applicable
and a UE expects to be provided only \'noCDM\' from _cdm-Type,_ only \'one\'
and \'three\' from _density_ , and only \'1 port\' from _nrofPorts_ [6, TS
38.214].
If a UE is configured with multiple DL BWPs for a serving cell, the UE
performs RLM using the RS(s) corresponding to resource indexes provided by
_RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ for the active DL BWP or, if _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_
is not provided for the active DL BWP, using the RS(s) provided _for the
active TCI state for PDCCH receptions_ in CORESETs on the active DL BWP.
In non-DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE assesses once per
indication period the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous time
period defined in [10, TS 38.133] against thresholds (Q~out~ and Q~in~)
configured by _rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold_. The UE determines the indication
period as the maximum between the shortest periodicity for radio link
monitoring resources _and 10 msec._
In DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE assesses once per
indication period the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous time
period defined in [10, TS 38.133], against thresholds (Q~out~ and Q~in~)
provided by _rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold_. The UE determines the indication
period as the maximum between the shortest periodicity for radio link
monitoring resources _and the DRX period._
The physical layer in the UE indicates, in frames where the radio link quality
is assessed, out-of-sync to higher layers when the radio link quality is worse
than the threshold Q~out~ for all resources in the set of resources for radio
link monitoring. When the radio link quality is better than the threshold
Q~in~ for any resource in the set of resources for radio link monitoring, the
physical layer in the UE indicates, in frames where the radio link quality is
assessed, in-sync to higher layers.
# 6 Link recovery procedures
A UE can be provided, for each BWP of a serving cell, a set _of periodic CSI-
RS resource configuration indexes by failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList
and_ a set of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH
block indexes by _candidateBeamRSList_ or _candidateBeamRSListExt or_
_candidateBeamRSSCellList_ for radio link quality measurements on the BWP of
the serving cell. If the UE is not provided _by_
_failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList_ for a BWP of the serving cell _, the
UE determines the set_ _to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration
indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by_ _TCI-
State_ for respective CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH and, if
there are two RS indexes in a TCI state, the set includes RS indexes
configured with _qcl-Type_ set to \'typeD\' for the corresponding TCI states.
The UE expects the set to include up to two RS indexes. The UE expects single
port RS in the _set_ _._ The UE expects single-port or two-port CSI-RS with
frequency density equal to 1 or 3 REs per RB in the set
{width="0.19791666666666666in" height="0.19791666666666666in"}.
The thresholds Q~out,LR~ and Q~in,LR~ correspond to the default value of
_rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold_ , as described in [10, TS 38.133] for Q~out~,
and to the value provided by _rsrp-ThresholdSSB or rsrp-ThresholdBFR_ ,
respectively.
The physical layer in the UE assesses the radio link quality according to the
set of resource configurations against the threshold Q~out,LR~. For the set _,
the UE_ assesses the radio link quality only according to _SS/PBCH blocks on
the PCell or the PSCell or_ periodic _CSI-RS resource configurations that_ are
quasi co-located, as described in [6, TS 38.214], with the DM-RS of PDCCH
receptions monitored by the UE. The UE applies the Q~in,LR~ threshold to the
L1-RSRP measurement obtained from a SS/PBCH block. The UE applies the Q~in,LR~
threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained for a CSI-RS resource after
scaling a respective CSI-RS reception power with a value provided by
_powerControlOffsetSS_.
In non-DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE provides an indication
to higher layers when the radio link quality for all corresponding resource
configurations in the set _that the UE uses to assess the radio link quality_
is worse than the threshold Q~out,LR~. The physical layer informs the higher
layers when the _radio link quality_ is worse than the threshold Q~out,LR~
with a periodicity determined by the maximum between the shortest periodicity
among the SS/PBCH blocks _on the PCell or the PSCell_ and/or the periodic CSI-
RS configurations in the set _that the UE uses to assess the radio link
quality and 2 msec. In DRX mode operation, the physical layer_ provides an
indication to higher layers _when the radio link quality is worse than the
threshold Q~out,LR~ with a periodicity determined as described in [10, TS
38.133]._
For the PCell or the PSCell, upon request from higher layers, the UE provides
to higher layers the periodic CSI-RS configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH
block indexes from the set _and the corresponding L1-RSRP measurements that
are larger than or equal to the_ Q~in,LR~ _threshold._
For the SCell, upon request from higher layers, the UE indicates to higher
layers whether there is at least one periodic CSI-RS configuration index or
SS/PBCH block index from the set {width="0.19791666666666666in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} with corresponding L1-RSRP measurements that
is larger than or equal to the Q~in,LR~ threshold, and _provides_ the periodic
CSI-RS configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes from the set
{width="0.19791666666666666in" height="0.19791666666666666in"} _and the
corresponding L1-RSRP measurements that are larger than or equal to the_
Q~in,LR~ _threshold, if any._
For the PCell or the PSCell, a UE can be provided a CORESET through a link to
a search space set provided by _recoverySearchSpaceId,_ as described in clause
10.1, for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET. If the UE is provided
_recoverySearchSpaceId_ , the UE does not expect to be provided another search
space set for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET associated with the search space
set provided by _recoverySearchSpaceId_.
For the PCell or the PSCell, the UE can be provided, by _PRACH-
ResourceDedicatedBFR_ , a configuration for PRACH transmission as described in
clause 8.1. For PRACH transmission in slot and according to antenna port quasi
co-location parameters associated with periodic CSI-RS resource configuration
or with SS/PBCH block associated with index _provided by higher layers_ [11,
TS 38.321], the UE monitors PDCCH in a search space set provided by
_recoverySearchSpaceId_ for detection of a DCI format with CRC scrambled by
C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI starting from slot within a window configured by
_BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For PDCCH monitoring_ in a search space set
provided by _recoverySearchSpaceId_ _and for corresponding PDSCH reception,
the UE assumes the same antenna port quasi-collocation parameters as the ones
associated with_ index _until the UE receives by higher layers an activation
for a TCI state or any of the parameters tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-
StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList._ After the UE detects a DCI format with CRC
scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in the search space set provided by
_recoverySearchSpaceId_ , the UE continues to monitor PDCCH candidates in the
search space set provided by _recoverySearchSpaceId_ until the UE receives a
MAC CE activation command for a TCI state or _tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or
tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList._
_For the PCell or the PSCell, after 28 symbols from a last symbol of_ a first
PDCCH reception in a search space set provided by _recoverySearchSpaceId_ for
which the UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI
_and_ until the UE receives an activation command for _PUCCH-
SpatialRelationInfo_ [11, TS 38.321] or is provided _PUCCH-
SpatialRelationInfo_ for PUCCH resource(s), t _he UE transmits a PUCCH on a
same cell as the PRACH transmission using_
\- _a_ same spatial filter as for the last PRACH transmission
\- _a_ power determined as described in clause 7.2.1 with , , and
_For the PCell or the PSCell, after 28 symbols from a last symbol of a first
PDCCH reception in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceId where
a UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI, the UE
assumes same antenna port quasi-collocation parameters as the ones associated
with index_ _for PDCCH monitoring in a CORESET with index 0._
_For the PCell or the PSCell, if BFR MAC CE [11, TS 38.321] is transmitted in
Msg3 or MsgA of contention based random access procedure, and if a PUCCH
resource is provided with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, after 28 symbols from the
last symbol of the PDCCH reception that determines the completion of the
contention based random access procedure as described in clause 5.1.4a or in
clause 5.1.5 of [11, TS 38.321], the UE transmits the PUCCH on a same cell as
the PRACH transmission using_
\- a same spatial filter as for the last PRACH transmission
\- _a_ power determined as described in clause 7.2.1 with
{width="0.3854166666666667in" height="0.21875in"},
{width="0.6145833333333334in" height="0.22916666666666666in"}, and
{width="0.3020833333333333in" height="0.19791666666666666in"}, where _q_ ~new~
is the SS/PBCH block index selected for the last PRACH transmission.
A UE can be provided, by _schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell, a configuration for
PUCCH transmission with a link recovery request (LRR) as described in clause
9.2.4. The UE can transmit in a first PUSCH MAC CE providing index(es) for at
least corresponding SCell(s) with_ _radio link quality_ worse than Q~out,LR~_,
indication(s) of presence of_ $q_{\text{new}}$ _for corresponding SCell(s),
and_ index(es) $q_{\text{new}}$ for a periodic CSI-RS configuration or for a
SS/PBCH block _provided by higher layers, as described in_ [11, TS 38.321]_,
if any, for corresponding SCell(s). After 28 symbols from a last symbol of a
PDCCH reception with a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission with a same
HARQ process number as for the transmission of the first PUSCH and having a
toggled NDI field value, the UE_
\- monitors PDCCH in all CORESETs _on the SCell(s) indicated by the MAC CE_
using the _same antenna port quasi co-location parameters as the ones
associated with the corresponding index(es)_ $q_{\text{new}}$_, if any_
\- transmits PUCCH on a PUCCH-SCell using a same spatial domain filter as the
one corresponding to $q_{\text{new}}$_, if any,_ for periodic CSI-RS or
SS/PBCH block reception, as described in clause 9.2.2, and using a power
determined as described in clause 7.2.1 with $q_{\text{u}} = 0$,
${q_{\text{d}} = q}_{\text{new}}$, and $l = 0$_,_ _if_
\- _the UE is_ provided _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ for the PUCCH,
\- a PUCCH with the LRR was either not transmitted or was transmitted on the
PCell or the PSCell, and
\- the PUCCH-SCell is included in the SCell(s) indicated by the MAC-CE
where the SCS configuration for the 28 symbols is the smallest of the SCS
configurations of the active DL BWP for the PDCCH reception and of the active
DL BWP(s) of the at least one SCell.
# 7 Uplink Power control
Uplink power control determines a power for PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS, and PRACH
transmissions.
_A UE does not expect to simultaneously maintain more than four pathloss
estimates per serving cell for all PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions as described
in clauses 7.1.1, 7.2.1, and 7.3.1,_ except for SRS transmissions configured
by _SRS-PosResourceSet_ as described in clause 7.3.1 _. If the UE is provided
a number of RS resources for pathloss estimation for PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS
transmissions that is larger than 4, the UE maintains for pathloss estimation
RS resources corresponding to_ RS resource indexes $q_{d}$ _as described in
clauses 7.1.1, 7.2.1, and 7.3.1._ _If an RS resource updated by MAC CE, as
described in clauses 7.1.1, 7.2.1 and 7.3.1, is one from the RS resources the
UE maintains for pathloss estimation for PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions_ , the
UE applies the pathloss estimation based on the RS resources starting from the
first slot that is after slot $k + 3 \bullet N_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,\ \
\mu}$ where $k$ is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH or PUSCH with
HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the MAC CE and $\mu\text{\ \ }$is
the SCS configuration for the PUCCH or PUSCH, respectively _._
_A PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS/PRACH transmission occasion_ $i$ _is defined by a_ slot
index $n_{s,f}^{\mu}$ within a frame with system frame number $\text{SFN}$, a
first symbol $S$ within the slot, and a number of consecutive symbols $L$. For
a PUSCH transmission with repetition Type B, a PUSCH transmission occasion is
a nominal repetition [6, TS 38.214].
## 7.1 Physical uplink shared channel
For a PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP $\text{\ b}$_, as described in
clause 12, of_ carrier $f$ _of_ serving cell $c$_,_ a UE first calculates a
linear value ${\widehat{P}}_{\text{PUSCH},b,f,c}(i,j,q_{d},l)$ _of the_
transmit power $P_{\text{PUSCH},b,f,c}(i,j,q_{d},l)$_, with parameters as
defined in clause 7.1.1. For a_ PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format
other than DCI format 0_0, or configured by _ConfiguredGrantConfig_ or
_semiPersistentOnPUSCH_ , if _txConfig_ in _PUSCH-Config_ is set to
\'codebook\',
\- if _ul-FullPowerTransmission_ in _PUSCH-Config_ is provided, _the UE
scales_ ${\widehat{P}}_{\text{PUSCH},b,f,c}(i,j,q_{d},l)$ by $s$ _where:_
\- if _ul-FullPowerTransmission_ in _PUSCH-Config_ is set to _fullpowerMode1_
, and each SRS resource in the _SRS-ResourceSet_ with _usage_ set to
\'codebook\' has more than one SRS port, $s$ _is_ the ratio of a number of
antenna ports with non-zero PUSCH transmission power over the maximum number
of SRS ports supported by the UE in one SRS resource
\- if _ul-FullPowerTransmission_ in _PUSCH-Config_ is set to _fullpowerMode2_
,
> \- $s = 1$ for full power TPMIs _reported by the UE [16, TS 38.306], and_
> $s$ is the ratio of a number of antenna ports with non-zero PUSCH
> transmission power over a number of SRS ports _for remaining TPMIs_ , where
> the number of SRS ports is associated with an SRS resource indicated by an
> SRI field in a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission if more than one
> SRS resource is configured in the _SRS-ResourceSet_ with _usage_ set to
> \'codebook\', or indicated by Type 1 configured grant, or the number of SRS
> ports is associated with the SRS resource if only one SRS resource is
> configured in the _SRS-ResourceSet_ with _usage_ set to \'codebook\',
>
> \- $s = 1$, if an SRS resource with a single port is indicated by an SRI
> field in a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission when more than one
> SRS resource is provided in the _SRS-ResourceSet_ with _usage_ set to
> \'codebook\', or indicated by Type 1 configured grant, or if only one SRS

> _usage_ set to \'codebook\', and
\- if _ul-FullPowerTransmission_ in _PUSCH-Config_ is set to _fullpower_ , $s
= 1$
\- else, if each SRS resource in the _SRS-ResourceSet_ with _usage_ set to
\'codebook\' has more than one SRS port _, the UE scales the linear value_ by
the ratio of the number of antenna ports with a non-zero PUSCH transmission
power to the maximum number of SRS ports supported by the UE in one SRS
resource.
The UE splits the power equally across the antenna ports on which the UE
transmits the PUSCH with non-zero power.
### 7.1.1 UE behaviour
If a UE transmits a PUSCH on active UL BWP _of_ carrier _of_ serving cell
_using_ parameter set configuration _with index_ _and_ PUSCH power control
adjustment state with index , the UE determines the PUSCH transmission power
in PUSCH transmission occasion as
[dBm]
where,
\- is the UE configured maximum output power defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1],
[8-2, TS 38.101-2] and [8-3, TS 38.101-3] for carrier _of_ serving cell in

cell and a set of values are provided by a set of _p0_ in _P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet_

carrier _of_ serving cell
\- If the UE is provided by _SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl_ more than one values of
_p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId_ and if a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission
includes an SRI field, the UE obtains a mapping from _sri-PUSCH-
PowerControlId_ in _SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl_ between a set of values for the
SRI field in the DCI format [5, TS 38.212] and a set of indexes provided by
_p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId_ that map to a set of _P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet_ values and
determines the value of from the _p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId_ value that is mapped to
the SRI field value. If the DCI format also includes an open-loop power
control parameter set indication _field and a value of the_ open-loop power
control parameter set indication _field is \'1\', the UE determines_ a value
of from a first value in _P0-PUSCH-Set_ with a _p0-PUSCH-SetId_ value mapped
to the SRI field value.
\- If the PUSCH transmission except for the PUSCH retransmission corresponding
to a RAR UL grant is scheduled by a DCI format that does not include an SRI
field, or if _SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl_ is not provided to the UE, ,
\- If _P0-PUSCH-Set_ is provided to the UE and the DCI format includes an
open-loop power control parameter set indication _field, the UE determines_ a
value of from
\- a first _P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet_ in _p0-AlphaSets_ if _a value of the_ open-loop
power control parameter set indication _field is \'0\' or \'00\'_
\- a first value in _P0-PUSCH-Set_ with the lowest _p0-PUSCH-SetID_ value if
_a value of the_ open-loop power control parameter set indication _field is
\'1\' or \'01\'_
\- a second value in _P0-PUSCH-Set_ with the lowest _p0-PUSCH-SetID_ value if
_a value of the_ open-loop power control parameter set indication _field is
\'10\'_

\Delta_{\text{MsgA}_\text{PUSCH}}$ and _msgA-Alpha is provided_ ,
$\alpha_{b,f,c}(0)$ is the value of _msgA-Alpha_

SRI field in the DCI format [5, TS 38.212] and a set of indexes provided by
_p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId_ that map to a set of _P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet_ values and

signal (RS) index $q_{d}$ for the active DL BWP, as described in clause 12,
_of carrier_ $f$ _of_ serving cell $c$
\- If the UE is not provided _PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS_ and
_enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS_ , or before the UE is provided dedicated higher
layer parameters _, the UE calculates_ _using a RS resource from an SS/PBCH
block_ with same SS/PBCH block index as the one _the UE uses to obtain MIB_
\- If the UE is configured with a number of RS resource indexes, up to the
value of _maxNrofPUSCH-PathlossReferenceRSs_ , and a respective set of RS

of RS resource indexes to correspond either to a SS/PBCH block index or to a
CSI-RS resource index as provided by _pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id_ in _PUSCH-
PathlossReferenceRS_

PowerControlId_ in _SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl_ between a set of values for the
SRI field in a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission and a set of
_PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id_ values and determines the RS resource index
$q_{d}$ from the value of _PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id_ that is mapped to the
SRI field value where the RS resource is either on serving cell $c$ or, if
provided, on a serving cell indicated by a value of _pathlossReferenceLinking_

provided a spatial setting by _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ for a PUCCH resource
with a lowest index for active UL BWP $b$ of each carrier $f$ _and_ serving
cell $c$, as described in clause 9.2.2, _the UE uses the same RS resource
index_ $q_{d}$ _as for a PUCCH transmission in the PUCCH resource with the
lowest index_
\- If the PUSCH transmission is not scheduled by DCI format 0_0, and if the UE
is provided _enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS_ and is not provided _PUSCH-
PathlossReferenceRS_ and _PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-r16,_ the UE uses the same

Id_ value being equal to zero where the RS resource is either on serving cell
or, if provided, on a serving cell indicated by a value of

for active UL BWP of carrier of primary cell , where . is a size for a set of
values provided by _maxNrofPUCCH-P0-PerSet_. The set of values is provided by
_p0-Set_. If _p0-Set_ is not provided to the UE, ,

mapping, by an index provided by _p0-PUCCH-Id_ , between a set of _pucch-
SpatialRelationInfoId_ values and a set of _p0-PUCCH-Value_ values. If the UE
is provided more than one values for _pucch-SpatialRelationInfoId_ and the UE
receives _an_ activation command [11, TS 38.321] indicating a value of _pucch-
SpatialRelationInfoId_ , the UE determines the _p0-PUCCH-Value_ value through

command in the first slot that is after slot where is the slot where the UE
would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the

both of a set of SS/PBCH block indexes, each provided by _ssb-Index_ in
_PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS_ when a value of a corresponding _pucch-
PathlossReferenceRS-Id_ maps to a SS/PBCH block index, and a set of CSI-RS
resource indexes, each provided by _csi-RS-Index_ when a value of a
corresponding _pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id_ maps to a CSI-RS resource index.

values for _pucch-SpatialRelationInfoId_ and the UE receives _an_ activation

is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for
the PDSCH providing the activation command and is the SCS configuration for
the PUCCH

BWP of carrier _of_ serving cell
\- If the first symbol of the SRS transmission occasion occurs within
$T_{proc,2}$ after a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI
format providing the TPC command, the UE may postpone the application of the
TPC until the above condition is not valid. $T_{proc,2}$ is the PUSCH
preparation time for the corresponding UE processing capability [6, TS 38.214]
assuming $d_{2,1} = 0$_,_ and $\mu$ corresponds to the smallest SCS
configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH carrying the DCI
format and the SCS configuration of the SRS.

\- if the UE is not configured for PUSCH transmissions on active UL BWP of
carrier _of_ serving cell _, or_ if _srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates_
indicates separate power control adjustment states between SRS transmissions
and PUSCH transmissions, and _tpc-Accumulation_ is provided, and the UE
detects a DCI format 2_3 symbols before a first symbol of SRS transmission

beginning of the first transmitted SRS resource in the SRS resource set .
If a UE transmits SRS based on a configuration by _SRS-PosResourceSet_ on
active UL BWP $b$ of carrier $f$ _of_ serving cell $c$, the UE determines the
SRS transmission power $P_{SRS,b,f,c}\left( i,q_{s} \right)$ in SRS
transmission occasion $i$ as
[dBm]
where,
> \- $P_{O_ SRS,b,f,c}\left( q_{s} \right)$ and

> PosResourceSetId_ from _SRS-PosResourceSet_ , and
\- $\text{PL}_{b,f,c}\left( q_{d} \right)$ is a downlink pathloss estimate in
dB calculated by the UE, as described in clause 7.1.1 in case of an active DL
BWP _of_ a serving cell $c$, using RS resource indexed $q_{d}$ in a serving or
non-serving cell for SRS resource set $q_{s}$ [6, TS 38.214]. A configuration
for RS resource index $q_{d}$ associated with SRS resource set $q_{s}$ is
provided by _pathlossReferenceRS-Pos_
\- if a _ssb-IndexServing_ is provided _, referenceSignalPower_ is provided by
_ss-PBCH-BlockPower_

PBCH-BlockPower-r16_
\- if a _dl-PRS_ is provided, _referenceSignalPower_ is provided by _dl-PRS-
ResourcePower_
If the UE determines that the UE is not able to accurately measure
$\text{PL}_{b,f,c}\left( q_{d} \right)$, or the UE is not provided with
_pathlossReferenceRS-Pos, the UE calculates_ $\text{PL}_{b,f,c}\left( q_{d}
\right)$ using _a RS resource obtained from the SS/PBCH block of the serving
cell that the UE uses to obtain MIB_
The UE may indicate a capability for a number of pathloss estimates that the
UE can simultaneously maintain for all SRS resource sets provided by _SRS-
PosResourceSet_ in addition to the up to four pathloss estimates that the UE
maintains per serving cell for PUSCH/PUCCH transmissions and for SRS
transmissions configured by _SRS-Resource_.
## 7.4 Physical random access channel
A UE determines a transmission power for a physical random access channel
(PRACH), , on active UL BWP of carrier of serving cell based on DL RS for
serving cell in transmission occasion as
[dBm],
where is the UE configured maximum output power defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1],
[8-2, TS 38.101-2] and [8-3, TS 38.101-3] for carrier of serving cell within
transmission occasion , is the PRACH target reception power
_PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER_ provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321] for
the active UL BWP of carrier of serving cell , and is a pathloss for the
active UL BWP of carrier _based on_ the DL RS associated with the PRACH
transmission on the active DL BWP _of_ serving cell and calculated by the UE
in dB as _referenceSignalPower_ \-- higher layer filtered RSRP in dBm, where
RSRP is defined in [7, TS 38.215] and the higher layer filter configuration is
defined in [12, TS 38.331]. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for
SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause
13, the UE determines based on the SS/PBCH block associated with the PRACH
transmission.
If a PRACH transmission from a UE is not in response to a detection of a PDCCH
order by the UE, or is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order by the UE
that triggers a contention based random access procedure, or is associated
with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index _is associated with
a SS/PBCH block, as described in clause 6,_ _referenceSignalPower_ is provided
by _ss-PBCH-BlockPower_.
If a PRACH transmission from a UE is in response to a detection of a PDCCH
order by the UE that triggers a contention-free random access procedure and
depending on the DL RS that the DM-RS of the PDCCH order is quasi-collocated
with as described in clause 10.1, _referenceSignalPower_ is provided by _ss-
PBCH-BlockPower_ or, if the UE is configured resources for a periodic CSI-RS
reception or the PRACH transmission is associated with a link recovery
procedure where a corresponding index _is associated with a periodic CSI-RS
configuration_ _as described in clause 6_ , _referenceSignalPower_ is obtained
by _ss-PBCH-BlockPower_ and _powerControlOffsetSS_ where
_powerControlOffsetSS_ provides an offset of CSI-RS transmission power
relative to SS/PBCH block transmission power [6, TS 38.214]. If
_powerControlOffsetSS_ is not provided to the UE, the UE assumes an offset of
0 dB. If the active TCI state for the PDCCH that provides the PDCCH order
includes two RS, the UE expects that one RS is configured with _qcl-Type_ set
to \'typeD\' and the UE uses the one RS when applying a value provided by
_powerControlOffsetSS_.
If within a random access response window, as described in clause 8.2, the UE
does not receive a random access response that contains a preamble identifier
corresponding to the preamble sequence transmitted by the UE, the UE
determines a transmission power for a subsequent PRACH transmission, if any,
as described in [11, TS 38.321].
If prior to a PRACH retransmission, a UE changes the spatial domain
transmission filter, Layer 1 notifies higher layers to suspend the power
ramping counter as described in [11, TS 38.321].
If due to power allocation _to_ PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH _/SRS transmissions as
described in clause 7.5, or due to power allocation in EN-DC or NE-DC or NR-DC
operation, or due to slot format determination as described in clause 11.1, or
due to the_ PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH _/SRS transmission occasions are in the same
slot or the gap between a PRACH transmission and PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission
is small as described in clause 8.1, or due to DAPS operation as described in
clause 15,_ the UE does not transmit a PRACH _in a transmission occasion_ ,
Layer 1 notifies higher layers to suspend the corresponding power ramping
counter. If due to power allocation _to_ PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH _/SRS transmissions
as described in clause 7.5, or due to power allocation in EN-DC or NE-DC or
NR-DC operation,_ the UE transmits a PRACH with reduced power _in a
transmission occasion_ , Layer 1 may notify higher layers to suspend the
corresponding power ramping counter.
## 7.5 Prioritizations for transmission power reductions
For single cell operation with two uplink carriers or for operation with
carrier aggregation, if a _total UE transmit power for PUSCH or PUCCH or PRACH
or SRS transmissions on serving cells in a frequency range in a respective
transmission occasion_ _would exceed_ _, where_ _is the linear value of_ _in
transmission occasion_ _as defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1] for FR1_ and [8-2, TS
38.101-2] _for FR2, the UE allocates power to_ PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH _/SRS
transmissions according to the following priority order (in descending order)
so that the total UE transmit power for transmissions on serving cells in the
frequency range is smaller than or equal to_ _for that frequency range in
every symbol of transmission occasion_ _. When determining a total transmit
power for serving cells in a frequency range in a symbol of transmission
occasion_ _, the UE does not include power for transmissions starting after
the symbol of transmission occasion_ _. The total UE transmit power in a
symbol of a slot is defined as the sum of the linear values of UE transmit
powers for PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, and SRS in the symbol of the slot._
\- PRACH transmission on the PCell
\- PUCCH or PUSCH transmissions with higher priority index according to clause
9
\- For PUCCH or PUSCH transmissions with same priority index
\- PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, and/or SR, and/or LRR, or
PUSCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information
\- PUCCH transmission with CSI or PUSCH transmission with CSI
\- PUSCH transmission without HARQ-ACK information or CSI and, for Type-2
random access procedure, PUSCH transmission on the PCell
\- SRS transmission, with aperiodic SRS having higher priority than semi-
persistent and/or periodic SRS, or PRACH transmission on a serving cell other
than the PCell
In case of same priority order and for operation with carrier aggregation, the
UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on the primary cell of the
MCG or the SCG over transmissions on a secondary cell. In case of same
priority order and for operation with two UL carriers, the UE prioritizes
power allocation for transmissions on the carrier where the UE is configured
to transmit PUCCH. If _PUCCH_ is not configured for any of the _two UL
carriers, the UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on_ the non-
supplementary UL carrier.

E-UTRA and NR for EN-DC, the UE expects to be configured with reference TDD
configuration for E-UTRA by _tdm-PatternConfig_ in [13, TS 36.213].
### 7.6.1A NE-DC
If a UE is configured with an MCG using NR radio access and with a SCG using
E-UTRA radio access, the UE is configured a maximum power for transmissions in

36.213] without considering as the maximum transmission power
If a UE is configured with , where is the linear value of , is the linear

### 7.6.2 NR-DC
If a UE is configured with an MCG using NR radio access in FR1 or in FR2 and
with a SCG using NR radio access in FR2 or in FR1, respectively, the UE
performs transmission power control independently per cell group as described
in clauses 7.1 through 7.5.

PCmode-FR2, or semi-static-mode2 for nrdc-PCmode-FR1_ or for _nrdc-PCmode-FR2,

transmissions configured by higher layers and on transmissions scheduled by
DCI formats in PDCCH receptions with a last symbol that is at least
$T_{\text{offset}}$ before the first symbol of the transmission occasion on

## 7.7 Power headroom report
The types of UE power headroom reports are the following. A Type 1 UE power
headroom that is valid for PUSCH transmission occasion on active UL BWP of
carrier _of_ serving cell . A Type 3 UE power headroom that is valid for SRS
transmission occasion on active UL BWP of carrier _of_ serving cell .
A UE determines whether a power headroom report for an activated serving cell
[11, TS 38.321] is based on an actual transmission or a reference format based
on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and periodic/semi-
persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and downlink control
information the UE received until and including the PDCCH monitoring occasion
where the UE detects the first DCI format scheduling an initial transmission
of a transport block since a power headroom report was triggered if the power
headroom report is reported on a PUSCH triggered by the first DCI format.
Otherwise, a UE determines whether a power headroom report is based on an
actual transmission or a reference format based on the higher layer signalling
of configured grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal
transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until the first
uplink symbol of a configured PUSCH transmission minus _T\'~proc,2~_
=_T~proc,2~_ where _T~proc,2\ ~_ is determined according to [6, TS 38.214]
assuming _d~2,1\ ~_ = 1, _d~2,2~_ =0, and with _µ~DL~_ corresponding to the
subcarrier spacing of the active downlink BWP of the scheduling cell for a
configured grant if the power headroom report is reported on the PUSCH using
the configured grant.
If a UE
\- is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell, and
\- determines a Type 1 power headroom report and a Type 3 power headroom
report for the serving cell
the UE
\- provides the Type 1 power headroom report if both the Type 1 and Type 3
power headroom reports are based on respective actual transmissions or on
respective reference transmissions
\- provides the power headroom report that is based on a respective actual
transmission if either the Type 1 report or the Type 3 report is based on a
respective reference transmission
If a UE is configured with a SCG and if _phr-ModeOtherCG_ for a CG indicates
\'virtual\' then, for power headroom reports transmitted on the CG, the UE
computes _PH_ assuming that the UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH on any
serving cell of the other CG. For NR-DC when both the MCG and the SCG operate
either in FR1 or in FR2 and for a power headroom report transmitted on the MCG
or the SCG, the UE computes _PH_ assuming that the UE does not transmit
PUSCH/PUCCH on any serving cell of the SCG or the MCG, respectively.
If the UE is configured with a SCG,
\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to MCG, the term \'serving
cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the MCG.
\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to SCG, the term \'serving
cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the SCG. The term
\'primary cell\' in this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.
If the UE is configured with a PUCCH-SCell,
\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to primary PUCCH group,
the term \'serving cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to
the primary PUCCH group.
\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to secondary PUCCH group,
the term \'serving cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to
the secondary PUCCH group. The term \'primary cell\' in this clause refers to
the PUCCH-SCell of the secondary PUCCH group.
For a UE configured with EN-DC/NE-DC and capable of dynamic power sharing, if
E-UTRA Dual Connectivity PHR [14, TS 36.321] is triggered and,
\- if the duration of NR slot on active UL BWP is different from that of
E-UTRA subframe carrying the Dual Connectivity PHR, the UE provides power

\- if the duration of NR slot on active UL BWP is the same as that of E-UTRA
subframe carrying the Dual Connectivity PHR for asynchronous EN-DC/NE-DC [10,
TS 38.133], the UE provides power headroom of the first NR slot that overlaps
with the E-UTRA subframe.
### 7.7.1 Type 1 PH report
If a UE determines that a Type 1 power headroom report for an activated
serving cell is based on an actual PUSCH transmission then, for PUSCH
transmission occasion on active UL BWP _of_ carrier _of_ serving cell , the UE
computes the Type 1 power headroom report as

with the multiple slots of the nominal repetition on active UL BWP
{width="0.19791666666666666in" height="0.19791666666666666in"}.
For a UE configured with EN-DC/NE-DC and capable of dynamic power sharing, if
E-UTRA Dual Connectivity PHR [14, TS 36.321] is triggered, the UE provides
power headroom of the first PUSCH, if any, on the determined NR slot as
described in clause 7.7.
If a UE is configured with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions, the UE does
not consider for computation of a Type 1 power headroom report in a first
PUSCH transmission that includes an initial transmission of transport block on
active UL BWP _of_ carrier of serving cell _, a second_ PUSCH transmission on
active UL BWP _of_ carrier of serving cell _that overlaps with the first PUSCH
transmission if_

occasion where the UE detects the earliest DCI format scheduling an initial
transmission of a transport block after a power headroom report was triggered

and with _µ~DL~_ corresponding to the subcarrier spacing of the active
downlink BWP of the scheduling cell for a configured grant if the first PUSCH
transmission is on a configured grant after a power headroom report was
triggered.
If the UE determines that a Type 1 power headroom report for an activated
serving cell is based on a reference PUSCH transmission then, for PUSCH
transmission occasion on active UL BWP _of_ carrier of serving cell , the UE
computes the Type 1 power headroom report as
[dB]
where is computed assuming MPR=0 dB, A-MPR=0 dB, P-MPR=0 dB. ∆T~C~ = 0 dB.

determines a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell based on a
reference PUSCH transmission, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report
for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier
provided by _pusch-Config_. If the UE is provided _pusch-Config_ for both UL
carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell
assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the UL carrier provided by _pucch-
Config_. If _pucch-Config_ is not provided to the UE for any of the two UL
carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell
assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the non-supplementary UL carrier.

# 8 Random access procedure
Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1 receives
from higher layers a set of SS/PBCH block indexes and provides to higher
layers a corresponding set of RSRP measurements.
Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1 may
receive from higher layers an indication to perform a Type-1 random access
procedure, as described in clauses 8.1 through 8.4, or a Type-2 random access
procedure as described in clauses 8.1 through 8.2A.
Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1 receives
the following information from the higher layers:
\- Configuration of physical random access channel (PRACH) transmission
parameters (PRACH preamble format, time resources, and frequency resources for
PRACH transmission).
\- Parameters for determining the root sequences and their cyclic shifts in
the PRACH preamble sequence set (index to logical root sequence table, cyclic
shift (), and set type (unrestricted, restricted set A, or restricted set B)).
From the physical layer perspective, the Type-1 L1 random access procedure
includes the transmission of random access preamble (Msg1) in a PRACH, random
access response (RAR) message with a PDCCH/PDSCH (Msg2), and when applicable,
the transmission of a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant, and PDSCH for
contention resolution.
From the physical layer perspective, the Type-2 L1 random access procedure
includes the transmission of random access preamble in a PRACH and of a PUSCH
(MsgA) and the reception of a RAR message with a PDCCH/PDSCH (MsgB), and when
applicable, the transmission of a PUSCH scheduled by a fallback RAR UL grant,
and PDSCH for contention resolution.
If a random access procedure is initiated by a PDCCH order to the UE, a PRACH
transmission is with a same SCS as a PRACH transmission initiated by higher
layers.
If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE
detects a PDCCH order, the UE uses the UL/SUL indicator field value from the
detected PDCCH order to determine the UL carrier for the corresponding PRACH
transmission.
## 8.1 Random access preamble
Physical random access procedure is triggered upon request of a PRACH
transmission by higher layers or by a PDCCH order. A configuration by higher
layers for a PRACH transmission includes the following:
\- A configuration for PRACH transmission [4, TS 38.211].
\- A preamble index, a preamble SCS, , a corresponding RA-RNTI, and a PRACH
resource.
A PRACH is transmitted using the selected PRACH format with transmission power
, as described in clause 7.4, on the indicated PRACH resource.
For Type-1 random access procedure, a UE is provided a number $N$ of SS/PBCH
block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion and a number $R$ of
contention based preambles per SS/PBCH block index per valid PRACH occasion by
_ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB_.
For Type-2 random access procedure with common configuration of PRACH
occasions with Type-1 random access procedure, a UE is provided a number $N$
of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion by _ssb-perRACH-
OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB_ and a number $Q$ of contention based preambles
per SS/PBCH block index per valid PRACH occasion by _msgA-CB-PreamblesPerSSB-
PerSharedRO_. The PRACH transmission can be on a subset of PRACH occasions
associated with a same SS/PBCH block index within an SSB-RO mapping cycle for
a UE provided with a PRACH mask index by _msgA-SSB-SharedRO-MaskIndex_
according to [11, TS 38.321].
For Type-2 random access procedure with separate configuration of PRACH
occasions with Type-1 random access procedure, a UE is provided a number $N$
of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion and a number $R$
of contention based preambles per SS/PBCH block index per valid PRACH occasion
by _msgA-SSB-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB when provided; otherwise,
by ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB_.
For Type-1 random access procedure, or for Type-2 random access procedure with
separate configuration of PRACH occasions from Type 1 random access procedure,
if $N  \- second, in increasing order of DMRS resource indexes within a PUSCH

\- third, in increasing order of time resource indexes $t_{\text{id}}$ for

\- fourth, in increasing order of indexes for $N_{s}$ PUSCH slots
where $N_{\text{preamble}} = ceil\left(
\frac{T_{\text{preamble}}}{T_{\text{PUSCH}}} \right)$, $T_{\text{preamble}}$
is a total number of valid PRACH occasions per association pattern period
multiplied by the number of preambles per valid PRACH occasion provided by
_rach-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA_ , and $T_{\text{PUSCH}}$ is a total number of
valid PUSCH occasions per PUSCH configuration per association pattern period
multiplied by **the number of DMRS resource indexes per valid PUSCH occasion**
provided by _msgA-DMRS-Config_.
A PUSCH occasion is valid if it does not overlap in time and frequency with
any valid PRACH occasion associated with either a Type-1 random access
procedure or a Type-2 random access procedure. Additionally, for unpaired
spectrum and for SS/PBCH blocks with indexes provided by _ssb-
PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ or by _ServingCellConfigCommon_
\- if a UE is not provided _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , a PUSCH occasion
is valid if the PUSCH occasion
\- does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PUSCH slot, and
\- starts at least $N_{\text{gap}}$ symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol,
where $N_{\text{gap}}$ is provided in Table 8.1-2 and, if _channelAccessMode_
= \"_semiStatic_ \" is provided, does not overlap with a set of consecutive
symbols before the start of a next channel occupancy time where the UE does
not transmit [15, TS 37.213].
\- if a UE is provided _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , a PUSCH occasion is
valid if the PUSCH occasion
\- is within UL symbols, or
\- does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PUSCH slot, and
\- starts at least $N_{\text{gap}}$ symbols after a last downlink symbol and
at least $N_{\text{gap}}$ symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where
$N_{\text{gap}}$ is provided in Table 8.1-2 and, if _channelAccessMode_ =
\"_semiStatic_ \" is provided, does not overlap with a set of consecutive
symbols before the start of a next channel occupancy time where the UE does
not transmit [15, TS 37.213].
## 8.2 Random access response - Type-1 random access procedure
In response to a PRACH transmission, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format 1_0
with CRC scrambled by a corresponding RA-RNTI during a window controlled by
higher layers [11, TS 38.321]. The window starts at the first symbol of the
earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS
set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one symbol, after the last
symbol of the PRACH occasion corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where
the symbol duration corresponds to the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set as defined
in clause 10.1. The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS
for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by _ra-ResponseWindow_.
If the UE detects the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding
RA-RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and
applicable, are same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted
PRACH, and the UE receives a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH within
the window, the UE passes the transport block to higher layers. The higher
layers parse the transport block for a random access preamble identity (RAPID)
associated with the PRACH transmission. If the higher layers identify the
RAPID in RAR message(s) of the transport block, the higher layers indicate an
uplink grant to the physical layer. This is referred to as random access
response (RAR) UL grant in the physical layer.
If the UE does not detect the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding RA-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI format
1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window and LSBs
of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and applicable, are not same
as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted PRACH, or if the UE
does not correctly receive the transport block in the corresponding PDSCH
within the window, or if the higher layers do not identify the RAPID
associated with the PRACH transmission from the UE, the higher layers can
indicate to the physical layer to transmit a PRACH. If requested by higher
layers, the UE shall be ready to transmit a PRACH no later than msec after the
last symbol of the window, or the last symbol of the PDSCH reception, where is
a time duration of symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE
processing capability 1 assuming corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration
among the SCS configurations for the PDCCH carrying the DCI format 1_0, the
corresponding PDSCH when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured, and the
corresponding PRACH. For , the UE assumes [6, TS 38.214]. For a PRACH
transmission using 1.25 kHz or 5 kHz SCS, the UE determines assuming SCS
configuration .
If the UE detects a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-
RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and
applicable, are same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted
the PRACH, and the UE receives a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH, the
UE may assume same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties, as
described in [6, TS 38.214], as for a SS/PBCH block or a CSI-RS resource the
UE used for PRACH association, as described in clause 8.1, regardless of
whether or not the UE is provided _TCI-State_ for the CORESET where the UE
receives the PDCCH with the DCI format 1_0.
If the UE attempts to detect the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding RA-RNTI in response to a PRACH transmission initiated by a PDCCH
order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure for the SpCell
[11, TS 38.321], the UE may assume that the PDCCH that includes the DCI format
1_0 and the PDCCH order have same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location
properties. If the UE attempts to detect the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled
by the corresponding RA-RNTI in response to a PRACH transmission initiated by
a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure for a
secondary cell, the UE may assume the DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location
properties of the CORESET associated with the Type1-PDCCH CSS set for
receiving the PDCCH that includes the DCI format 1_0.
A RAR UL grant schedules a PUSCH transmission from the UE. The contents of the
RAR UL grant, starting with the MSB and ending with the LSB, are given in
Table 8.2-1.
If the value of the frequency hopping flag is 0, the UE transmits the PUSCH
without frequency hopping; otherwise, the UE transmits the PUSCH with
frequency hopping.
The UE determines the MCS of the PUSCH transmission from the first sixteen
indexes of the applicable MCS index table for PUSCH as described in [6, TS
38.214].
The TPC command value is used for setting the power of the PUSCH transmission,
as described in clause 7.1.1, and is interpreted according to Table 8.2-2.
The CSI request field is reserved.
The ChannelAccess-CPext field indicates a channel access type and CP extension
for operation with shared spectrum channel access [15, TS 37.213] as defined
in Table 7.3.1.1.1-4 in [5, TS 38.212] or Table 7.3.1.1.1-4A in [5, TS 38.212]
if _channelAccessMode_ = \"_semiStatic_ \" is provided.

Unless the UE is configured a SCS, the UE receives subsequent PDSCH using same
SCS as for the PDSCH reception providing the RAR message.
If the UE does not detect the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding RA-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI format
1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window and the
LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and applicable, are not
same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted the PRACH, or
the UE does not correctly receive a corresponding transport block within the
window, the UE procedure is as described in [11, TS 38.321].
## 8.2A Random access response - Type-2 random access procedure
In response to a transmission of a PRACH and a PUSCH, or to a transmission of
only a PRACH if the PRACH preamble is mapped to a valid PUSCH occasion, a UE
attempts to detect a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding
MsgB-RNTI during a window controlled by higher layers [11, TS 38.321]. The
window starts at the first symbol of the earliest CORESET the UE is configured
to receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is
at least one symbol, after the last symbol of the PUSCH occasion corresponding
to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the SCS
for Type1-PDCCH CSS set. The length of the window in number of slots, based on
the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by _msgB-ResponseWindow_.
In response to a transmission of a PRACH, if the PRACH preamble is not mapped
to a valid PUSCH occasion, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format 1_0 with CRC
scrambled by a corresponding MsgB-RNTI during a window controlled by higher
layers [11, TS 38.321]. The window starts at the first symbol of the earliest
CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as
defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one symbol, after the last symbol of
the PRACH occasion corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol
duration corresponds to the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set. The length of the
window in number of slots, based on the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is
provided by _msgB-ResponseWindow_.
If the UE detects the DCI format 1_0, with CRC scrambled by the corresponding
MsgB-RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if applicable, are
same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted PRACH, and the
UE receives a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH within the window, the
UE passes the transport block to higher layers. The higher layers indicate to
the physical layer
\- an uplink grant if the RAR message(s) is for fallbackRAR and a random
access preamble identity (RAPID) associated with the PRACH transmission is
identified, and the UE procedure continues as described in clauses 8.2, 8.3,
and 8.4 when the UE detects a RAR UL grant, or
\- transmission of a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information having ACK value if the
RAR message(s) is for successRAR, where
\- a PUCCH resource for the transmission of the PUCCH is indicated by PUCCH
resource indicator field of 4 bits in the successRAR from a PUCCH resource set
that is provided by _pucch-ResourceCommon_
\- a slot for the PUCCH transmission is indicated by a HARQ Feedback Timing
Indicator field of 3 bits in the successRAR having a value $k$ from {1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8} and, with reference to slots for PUCCH transmission having
duration $T_{\text{slot}}$, the slot is determined as $n + k +
\mathrm{\Delta}$, where $n$ is a slot of the PDSCH reception and
$\mathrm{\Delta}$ is as defined for PUSCH transmission in Table 6.1.2.1.1-5 of
[6, TS 38.214]
\- the UE does not expect the first symbol of the PUCCH transmission to be
after the last symbol of the PDSCH reception by a time smaller than $N_{T,1} +
0.5$ msec where $N_{T,1}$ is the PDSCH processing time for UE processing
capability 1 [6, TS 38.214]
\- for operation with shared spectrum channel access, a channel access type
and CP extension [15, TS 37.213] for a PUCCH transmission is indicated by a
ChannelAccess-CPext field in the successRAR as defined in Table 7.3.1.1.1-4 in
[5, TS 38.212] or Table 7.3.1.1.1-4A in [5, TS 38.212] if _channelAccessMode_
= \"_semiStatic_ \" is provided
\- the PUCCH transmission is with a same spatial domain transmission filter
and in a same active UL BWP **as a last PUSCH transmission**
If the UE detects the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI and a
transport block in a corresponding PDSCH within the window, the UE transmits a
PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information having ACK value if the UE correctly detects
the transport block or NACK value if the UE incorrectly detects the transport
block and the time alignment timer is running [11, TS 38.321].
If the UE detects a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding
MsgB-RNTI and receives a transport block within the window in a corresponding
PDSCH, the UE may assume same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties,
as described in [6, TS 38.214], as for a SS/PBCH block the UE used for PRACH
association, as described in clause 8.1, regardless of whether or not the UE
is provided _TCI-State_ for the CORESET where the UE receives the PDCCH with
the DCI format 1_0.
The UE does not expect to be indicated to transmit the PUCCH with the HARQ-ACK
information at a time that is prior to a time when the UE applies a TA command
that is provided by the transport block. If the UE does not detect the DCI
format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the
window, or if the UE detects the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI
format 1_0, if applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where
the UE transmitted the PRACH, or if the UE does not correctly receive the
transport block in the corresponding PDSCH within the window, or if the higher
layers do not identify the RAPID associated with the PRACH transmission from
the UE, the higher layers can indicate to the physical layer to transmit only
PRACH according to Type-1 random access procedure or to transmit both PRACH
and PUSCH according to Type-2 random access procedure [11, TS 38.321]. If
requested by higher layers, the UE shall be ready to transmit a PRACH no later
than $N_{\text{T,1}} + 0.75$ msec after the last symbol of the window, or the
last symbol of the PDSCH reception, where $N_{\text{T,1}}$ is a time duration
of $N_{1}$ symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing
capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured. For $\mu = 0$, the UE
assumes $N_{\text{1,0}} = 14$ [6, TS 38.214].
Unless the UE is configured a SCS, the UE receives subsequent PDSCH using same
SCS as for the PDSCH reception providing the RAR message.
If the UE does not detect the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the 1_0 with
CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window and LSBs of a
SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if applicable, are not same as corresponding
LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted the PRACH, or the UE does not
correctly receive a corresponding transport block within the window, the UE
procedure is as described in [11, TS 38.321].
## 8.3 PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant
An active UL BWP, as described in clause 12 and in [4, TS 38.211], for a PUSCH
transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant is indicated by higher layers.
If _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH_ is not provided by _BWP-UplinkCommon_ and _BWP-
UplinkDedicated_ , for determining the frequency domain resource allocation
for the PUSCH transmission within the active UL BWP
\- if the active UL BWP and the initial UL BWP have same SCS and same CP

active UL BWP is the initial UL BWP, the initial UL BWP is used
\- else, the RB numbering starts from the first RB of the active UL BWP and
the maximum number of RBs for frequency domain resource allocation equals the
number of RBs in the initial UL BWP
The frequency domain resource allocation is by uplink resource allocation type
1 [6, TS 38.214]. For an initial UL BWP size of $N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}$
RBs, a UE processes the frequency domain resource assignment field as follows
\- if $N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} \leq 180$, or for operation with shared
spectrum channel access if $N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} \leq 90$
\- truncate the frequency domain resource assignment field to its $\left\lceil
\text{log}_{2}\left( \frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} \bullet \left(
N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} + 1 \right)}{2} \right) \right\rceil$ least
significant bits and interpret the truncated frequency resource assignment
field as for the frequency resource assignment field in DCI format 0_0 as
described in [5, TS 38.212]
\- else
\- insert $\left\lceil \text{log}_{2}\left( \frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}
\bullet \left( N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} + 1 \right)}{2} \right)
\right\rceil - 14$ most significant bits, or for operation with shared
spectrum channel access insert $\left\lceil \text{log}_{2}\left(
\frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} \bullet \left( N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}
+ 1 \right)}{2} \right) \right\rceil - 12$ most significant bits, with value
set to \'0\' after the $N_{UL,hop}$ bits to the frequency domain resource
assignment field, where $N_{UL,hop} = 0$ if the frequency hopping flag is set
to \'0\' and $N_{UL,hop}$ is provided in Table 8.3-1 if the hopping flag bit
is set to \'1\', and interpret the expanded frequency resource assignment
field as for the frequency resource assignment field in DCI format 0_0 as
described in [5, TS 38.212]
\- end if
If _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH_ is provided by _BWP-UplinkCommon_ or _BWP-
UplinkDedicated_ , the frequency domain resource allocation is by uplink
resource allocation type 2 [6, TS 38.214]. A UE processes the frequency domain
resource assignment field as follows
\- truncate the frequency domain resource assignment field to the $X = 6$ LSBs
if $\mu = 0$, or to the $X = 5$ LSBs if $\mu = 1$
\- for interlace allocation of a PUSCH transmission, interpret the $X$ MSBs of
the truncated frequency domain resource assignment field for the active UL BWP
as for the $X$ MSBs of the frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI
format 0_0 [6, TS 38.214]
\- for RB set allocation of a PUSCH transmission, the RB set of the active UL
BWP is the RB set of the PRACH transmission associated with the RAR UL grant.
The UE assumes that the RB set is defined as when the UE is not provided
_intraCellGuardBandsUL-List_ [6, TS 38.214]_._
A UE determines whether or not to apply transform precoding as described in
[6, TS 38.214].
For a PUSCH transmission with frequency hopping scheduled by RAR UL grant or
for a Msg3 PUSCH retransmission, the frequency offset for the second hop [6,
TS 38.214] is given in Table 8.3-1.

The UE expects the PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions fulfill the conditions in
clause 9 and clause 9.2.5 for UCI multiplexing replacing the reference time of
\"end of PDSCH\" with \"end of the last symbol of a last PSFCH reception
occasion\" as described in 16.5 and _T~proc,~_ ~1~ with _T~prep~_.
A UE does not expect that a PUCCH carrying SL HARQ-ACK reports overlaps with
PUSCH with aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI reports.
A UE does not expect to be scheduled to transmit a PUCCH or a PUSCH with
smaller priority index that would overlap in time with a PUCCH of larger
priority index with HARQ-ACK information only in response to a PDSCH reception
without a corresponding PDCCH. A UE does not expect to be scheduled to
transmit a PUCCH of smaller priority index that would overlap in time with a
PUSCH of larger priority index with SP-CSI report(s) without a corresponding
PDCCH.
In the remaining of this clause, a UE multiplexes UCIs with same priority
index in a PUCCH or a PUSCH before considering limitations for UE transmission
as described in clauses 11.1, 11.1.1, 11.2A and 15. A PUCCH or a PUSCH is
assumed to have a same priority index as a priority index of UCIs a UE
multiplexes in the PUCCH or the PUSCH.
In the remaining of this clause, the multiplexing or prioritization for
overlapping channels are for overlapping channels with same priority index or
for overlapping channels with a PUCCH carrying SL HARQ-ACK information.
In the remaining of this clause, if a UE is provided _subslotLengthForPUCCH_ ,
a slot for an associated PUCCH resource of a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK
information includes a number of symbols indicated by _subslotLengthForPUCCH,
unless stated otherwise_.
If a UE would transmit on a serving cell a PUSCH without UL-SCH that overlaps
with a PUCCH transmission on a serving cell that includes positive SR
information, the UE does not transmit the PUSCH.
If a UE would transmit CSI reports on overlapping physical channels, the UE
applies the priority rules described in [6, TS 38.214] for the multiplexing of
CSI reports.
If a UE
\- would multiplex UCI in a PUCCH transmission that overlaps with a PUSCH
transmission, and
\- the PUSCH and PUCCH transmissions fulfil the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for
UCI multiplexing,
the UE
\- multiplexes only HARQ-ACK information, if any, from the UCI in the PUSCH
transmission and does not transmit the PUCCH if the UE multiplexes aperiodic
or semi-persistent CSI reports in the PUSCH;
\- multiplexes only HARQ-ACK information and CSI reports, if any, from the UCI
in the PUSCH transmission and does not transmit the PUCCH if the UE does not
multiplex aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI reports in the PUSCH.
A UE does not expect to multiplex in a PUSCH transmission in one slot with SCS
configuration $\mu_{1}$ UCI of same type that the UE would transmit in PUCCHs
in different slots with SCS configuration $\mu_{2}$ if $\mu_{1}  \- a first HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority index 0

If a UE receives a PDSCH without receiving a corresponding PDCCH, or if the UE
receives a PDCCH indicating a SPS PDSCH release, the UE generates one
corresponding HARQ-ACK information bit. If the UE generates two HARQ-ACK
codebooks, the UE is indicated by _harq-CodebookID_ , per SPS PDSCH
configuration, a HARQ-ACK codebook index for multiplexing the corresponding
HARQ-ACK information bit.
If a UE is provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback and the UE detects a_ DCI
format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion that includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK
request field with value 1
\- the UE includes the HARQ-ACK information in a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook, as
described in clause 9.1.4
\- the UE does not expect that the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator
field of the DCI format provides an inapplicable value from _dl-DataToUL-
ACK-r16_
In the remaining of this clause, reference is to one HARQ-ACK codebook and to
DCI formats that schedule PDSCH reception, or indicate SPS PDSCH release, or
indicate SCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH reception and are
associated with the HARQ-ACK codebook.
If a UE is required to receive SPS PDSCHs in a slot according to Clause 5.1 of
[6] and Clause 11.1 for SPS configurations that are indicated to be released
by a DCI format, the UE is not expected to receive the DCI format in the slot
if the end of the last symbol of the PDCCH reception is after the end of a
last symbol of any of the SPS PDSCH receptions. For a SPS configuration
subject to _pdsch-AggregationFactor_ or _pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16_ , the UE
is not expected to receive the DCI format in a slot containing a SPS PDSCH
transmission occasion other than the first transmission occasion required to
be received by the UE for a TB.
If a UE is configured to receive SPS PDSCHs in a slot for SPS configurations
that are indicated to be released by a DCI format, and if the UE receives the
PDCCH providing the DCI format in the slot, and if HARQ-ACK information for
the SPS PDSCH release and the SPS PDSCH receptions would be multiplexed in a
same PUCCH, the UE does not expect to receive the SPS PDSCHs, does not
generate HARQ-ACK information for the SPS PDSCH receptions, and generates a
HARQ-ACK information bit for the SPS PDSCH release.
If a UE is configured to receive SPS PDSCH(s) in a slot for SPS
configuration(s), the UE does not expect to receive a PDCCH providing a DCI
format in the slot to indicate SPS PDSCH release of these SPS
configuration(s), if HARQ-ACK information for the SPS PDSCH release and the
SPS PDSCH reception(s) would map to different PUCCHs.
If a UE detects a DCI format 1_1 indicating
\- SCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH reception, as described in clause
10.3, and
\- is provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic_ _or pdsch-HARQ-ACK-
Codebook-r16_
the UE generates a HARQ-ACK information bit as described in clause 9.1.3 for a
DCI format 1_1 indicating SCell dormancy and the HARQ-ACK information bit
value is ACK.
If a UE is not provided _PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission_ , the UE generates
one HARQ-ACK information bit per transport block.
For a HARQ-ACK information bit, a UE generates a positive acknowledgement
(ACK) if the UE detects a DCI format that provides a SPS PDSCH release or
correctly decodes a transport block, and generates a negative acknowledgement
(NACK) if the UE does not correctly decode the transport block. A HARQ-ACK
information bit value of 0 represents a NACK while a HARQ-ACK information bit
value of 1 represents an ACK.
In the following, the CRC for a DCI format is scrambled with a C-RNTI, an MCS-
C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI.
### 9.1.1 CBG-based HARQ-ACK codebook determination
If a UE is provided _PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission_ for a serving cell, the
UE receives a PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1_1, that includes code block
groups (CBGs) of a transport block. The UE is also provided
_maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock_ indicating a maximum number
{width="0.6375in" height="0.25277777777777777in"} of CBGs for generating
respective HARQ-ACK information bits for a transport block reception for the
serving cell.
For a number of code blocks (CBs) in a transport block, the UE determines a
number of CBGs according to clause 5.1.7.1 of [6, TS 38.214] and determines a
number of HARQ-ACK bits for the transport block as .
The UE generates an ACK for the HARQ-ACK information bit of a CBG if the UE
correctly received all code blocks of the CBG and generates a NACK for the
HARQ-ACK information bit of a CBG if the UE incorrectly received at least one
code block of the CBG. If the UE receives two transport blocks, the UE
concatenates the HARQ-ACK information bits for CBGs of the second transport
block after the HARQ-ACK information bits for CBGs of the first transport
block.
The HARQ-ACK codebook includes the HARQ-ACK information bits and, if for a
transport block, the UE generates a NACK value for the last HARQ-ACK
information bits for the transport block in the HARQ-ACK codebook.
If the UE generates a HARQ-ACK codebook in response to a retransmission of a
transport block, corresponding to a same HARQ process as a previous
transmission of the transport block, the UE generates an ACK for each CBG that
the UE correctly decoded in a previous transmission of the transport block.
If a UE correctly detects each of the CBGs and does not correctly detect the
transport block for the CBGs, the UE generates a NACK value for each of the
CBGs.
### 9.1.2 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook determination
This clause applies if the UE is configured with _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook =
semi-static_.
A UE does not expect to be configured with _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-
static_ for a codebook if a UE is provided _subslotLength-ForPUCCH for the
codebook_.
A UE reports HARQ-ACK information for a corresponding PDSCH reception or SPS
PDSCH release only in a HARQ-ACK codebook that the UE transmits in a slot
indicated by a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in a
corresponding DCI format or provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK_ or _dl-DataToUL-
ACK-r16_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2_ if the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing
indicator field is not present in the DCI format as described in clause 9.2.3.
The UE reports NACK value(s) for HARQ-ACK information bit(s) in a HARQ-ACK
codebook that the UE transmits in a slot not indicated by a value of a PDSCH-
to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in a corresponding DCI format.
If a UE is not provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback_ , the UE does not
expect to receive a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format that the UE detects in any
PDCCH monitoring occasion and includes a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing
indicator field providing an inapplicable value from _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16_.
If the UE is provided _pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16_ in _SPS-Config_ or _pdsch-
AggregationFactor_ in _PDSCH-Config_ and no entry in _pdsch-
TimeDomainAllocationList and pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListDCI-1-2 includes
repetitionNumber_ in _PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation-r16_ ,
$N_{\text{PDSCH}}^{repeat,max}$ is a maximum value of _pdsch-
AggregationFactor-r16_ in _SPS-Config_ or _pdsch-AggregationFactor_ in _PDSCH-
Config_ ; otherwise $N_{\text{PDSCH}}^{repeat,max} = 1$. The UE reports HARQ-
ACK information for a PDSCH reception
\- from DL slot ${n_{D} - N}_{\text{PDSCH}}^{\text{repeat}} + 1$ to DL slot
$n_{D}$, if $N_{\text{PDSCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ is provided by _pdsch-
AggregationFactor_ or _pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16_ [6, TS 38.214], or
\- from DL slot $\ n_{D} - repetitionNumber + 1$ to DL slot $n_{D}$, if the
_time domain resource assignment_ field in the DCI format scheduling the PDSCH
reception indicates an entry containing _repetitionNumber,_ or
\- in DL slot $n_{D}$, otherwise
only in a HARQ-ACK codebook that the UE includes in a PUCCH or PUSCH
transmission in slot $n + k$, where $n$ is the last UL slot overlapping with
DL slot $n_{D}$ and $k$ is a number of slots indicated by the PDSCH-to-
HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in a corresponding DCI format or provided
by _dl-DataToUL-ACK_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2_ if
the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field is not present in the DCI
format. If the UE reports HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH reception in a
slot other than slot $n + k$, the UE sets a value for each corresponding HARQ-
ACK information bit to NACK.
If a UE reports HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH only for
\- a SPS PDSCH release indicated by DCI format 1_0 with counter DAI field
value of 1, or
\- a PDSCH reception scheduled by DCI format 1_0 with counter DAI field value
of 1 on the PCell, or
\- SPS PDSCH reception(s)
within the occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions as determined in clause
9.1.2.1, the UE determines a HARQ-ACK codebook only for the SPS PDSCH release
or only for the PDSCH reception or only for one SPS PDSCH reception according
to corresponding occasion(s) on respective serving cell(s), where the value of
counter DAI in DCI format 1_0 is according to Table 9.1.3-1 and HARQ-ACK
information bits in response to more than one SPS PDSCH receptions that the UE
is configured to receive are ordered according to the following pseudo-code;
otherwise, the procedures in clause 9.1.2.1 and clause 9.1.2.2 for a HARQ-ACK
codebook determination apply.

#### 9.1.2.1 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink control channel
For a serving cell $c$, an active DL BWP, and an active UL BWP, as described
in clause 12, the UE determines a set of $M_{A,c}$ occasions for candidate
PDSCH receptions for which the UE can transmit corresponding HARQ-ACK
information in a PUCCH in slot $n_{U}$. If serving cell $c$ is deactivated,
the UE uses as the active DL BWP for determining the set of $M_{A,c}$
occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions a DL BWP provided by
_firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_. The determination is based:
a) on a set of slot timing values $K_{1}$ associated with the active UL BWP
a) If the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1_0 and is not
configured to monitor PDCCH for either DCI format 1_1 or DCI format 1_2 on
serving cell $c$, or the active DL BWP for serving cell $c$ is dormant BWP,
$K_{1}$ is provided by the slot timing values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
b) If the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1_1 and is not
configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1_2 for serving cell $c$, $K_{1}$
is provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16_
c) If the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1_2 and is not
configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1_1 for serving cell $c$, $K_{1}$
is provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2_
d) If the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1_1 and DCI format
1_2 for serving cell $c$, $K_{1}$ is provided by the union of _dl-DataToUL-ACK
or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16_ and _dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2_
e) If an inapplicable value in _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16_ is provided, the value is
excluded from $K_{1}$
b) on a set of row indexes $R$ of a table that is associated with the active
DL BWP and defining respective sets of slot offsets $K_{0}$, start and length
indicators _SLIV_ , and PDSCH mapping types for PDSCH reception as described
in [6, TS 38.214], where the row indexes $R$ of the table are provided by the
union of row indexes of time domain resource allocation tables for DCI formats
the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for serving cell $c$
a) if the UE is provided _referenceOfSLIVDCI-1-2_ , for each row index with
slot offset $K_{0} = 0$ and PDSCH mapping Type B in a set of row indexes of a
table for DCI format 1_2 [6, TS 38.214], for any PDCCH monitoring occasion in
any slot where the UE monitors PDCCH for DCI format 1_2 and with starting
symbol $S_{0} > 0$, if ${S + S}_{0} + L \leq 14$ for normal cyclic prefix and
${S + S}_{0} + L \leq 12$ for extended cyclic prefix, add a new row index in
the set of row indexes of the table by replacing the starting symbol $S$ of
the row index by ${S + S}_{0}$
c) on the ratio $2^{\mu_{\text{D}\text{L}} - \mu_{\text{U}\text{L}}}$ between
the downlink SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{D}\text{L}}$ and the uplink SCS
configuration $\mu_{\text{U}\text{L}}$ provided by _subcarrierSpacing_ in
_BWP-Downlink_ and _BWP-Uplink_ for the active DL BWP and the active UL BWP,
respectively
d) if provided, on _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ and _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationDedicated_ as described in clause 11.1
e) if _ca-SlotOffset is_ provided, on
$N_{\text{slot,offset,}\text{c}}^{\text{DL}}\ $_and_
$\mu_{\text{offset}\text{,}\text{DL}\text{,c}}$ provided by _ca-SlotOffset_
for serving cell $c$, _or on_ $N_{\text{slot,offset}}^{\text{UL}}\ $ and
$\mu_{\text{offset}\text{,}\text{U}\text{L}}$ provided by _ca-SlotOffset_ for
the primary cell, as described in [4, TS 38.211].
If a UE
\- is not provided _coresetPoolIndex_ or is provided _coresetPoolIndex_ with a
value of 0 for first CORESETs on active DL BWPs of serving cells, and
\- is provided _coresetPoolIndex_ with a value of 1 for second CORESETs on
active DL BWPs of the serving cells, and
\- is provided _ackNackFeedbackMode_ = _joint_
where
\- a serving cell is placed in a first set $S_{\text{0}}$ of
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,0}}$ serving cells if the serving cell includes a
first CORESET, and
\- a serving cell is placed in a second set $S_{\text{1}}$ of
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,1}}$ serving cells if the serving cell includes a
second CORESET, and
\- serving cells are placed in a set according to an ascending order of a
serving cell index
the UE generates a Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook for the set $S_{\text{0}}$ and the
set $S_{1}$ of serving cells separately by setting
${N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}} = N}_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,0}}$ and
${N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}} = N}_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,1}}$ in the
following pseudo-code. The UE concatenates the HARQ-ACK codebook generated for
the set $S_{\text{0}}$ followed by the HARQ-ACK codebook generated for the set
$S_{1}$ to obtain a total number of {width="0.3055555555555556in"
height="0.2013888888888889in"} HARQ-ACK information bits.
For the set of slot timing values , the UE determines a set of occasions for
candidate PDSCH receptions or SPS PDSCH releases according to the following
pseudo-code. A location in the Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook for HARQ-ACK
information corresponding to a single SPS PDSCH release is same as for a
corresponding SPS PDSCH reception. A location in the Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook
for HARQ-ACK information corresponding to multiple SPS PDSCH releases by a
single DCI format is same as for a corresponding SPS PDSCH reception with the
lowest SPS configuration index among the multiple SPS PDSCH releases.

#### 9.1.2.2 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink shared channel
If a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format that does not
include a DAI field, then
_\- if the_ UE has not received any PDSCH or SPS PDSCH release that the UE
transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH, based on a value of
a respective PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in a DCI format
scheduling the PDSCH reception or the SPS PDSCH release or on the value of
_dl-DataToUL-ACK_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16_ if the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback
timing indicator field is not present in DCI format 1_1 or on the value of
_dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2_ if the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field
is not present in DCI format 1_2, in any of the $M_{c}$ occasions for
candidate PDSCH receptions by a DCI format or SPS PDSCH on any serving cell
$c$, as described in clause 9.1.2.1 _,_ the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK
information in the PUSCH transmission
\- else the UE generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1.2.1,
except that _harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH_ is replaced by _harq-ACK-
SpatialBundlingPUSCH_ , unless the UE receives only a SPS PDSCH release, or
only SPS PDSCH reception, or only a PDSCH that is scheduled by DCI format 1_0
with a counter DAI field value of 1 on the PCell in the $M_{c}$ occasions for
candidate PDSCH receptions in which case the UE generates HARQ-ACK information
only for the SPS PDSCH release or only for the PDSCH reception as described in
clause 9.1.2.
A UE sets to NACK value in the HARQ-ACK codebook any HARQ-ACK information
corresponding to PDSCH reception or SPS PDSCH release that the UE detects in a
PDCCH monitoring occasion that starts after a PDCCH monitoring occasion where
the UE detects a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission.
A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format switching a DL BWP within $N_{2}$
symbols prior to a first symbol of a PUSCH transmission where the UE
multiplexes HARQ-ACK information, where $N_{2}$ is defined in [6, TS 38.214].
If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
scheduled by DCI format that includes a DAI field, the UE generates the HARQ-
ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1.2.1 when a value of the DAI field is
$V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 1$ except that _harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH_
is replaced by _harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH_. The UE does not generate a
HARQ-ACK codebook for multiplexing in the PUSCH transmission when
$V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 0$ unless the UE receives only a SPS PDSCH
release, or only SPS PDSCH(s), or only a PDSCH that is scheduled by DCI format
1_0 with a counter DAI field value of 1 on the PCell in the $M_{c}$ occasions
for candidate PDSCH receptions in which case the UE generates HARQ-ACK
information only for the SPS PDSCH release or only for the PDSCH reception as
described in clause 9.1.2. $V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 0$ if the PUSCH is
scheduled by a DCI format that includes a DAI field and the DAI field is set
to \'0\'; otherwise, $V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 1$.
### 9.1.3 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook determination
This clause applies if the UE is configured with _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook =
dynamic_ or with _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16_. Unless stated otherwise, a
PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field provides an applicable value.
A UE does not expect to multiplex in a Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook HARQ-ACK
information that is in response to a detection of a DCI format that does not
include a counter DAI field.
If a UE receives a first DCI format that the UE detects in a first PDCCH
monitoring occasion and includes a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator
field providing an inapplicable value from _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16_ ,
\- if the UE detects a second DCI format, the UE multiplexes the corresponding
HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission in a slot that is
indicated by a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the
second DCI format, where
\- if the UE is not provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16_ , the UE detects
the second DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion after the first one,
and where the slot indicated by the value of the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing
indicator field in the second DCI format is no later than a slot for HARQ-ACK
information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception, if any, received after the
PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI format.
\- if the UE is provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16_ , the UE detects the
second DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion after the first one, and
the second DCI format indicates a HARQ-ACK information report for a same PDSCH
group index as indicated by the first DCI format as described in clause
9.1.3.3, and where the slot indicated by the value of the PDSCH-to-
HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the second DCI format is no later than
a slot for HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception, if any,
received after the PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI format.
\- if the UE is provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16_ , the UE receives the
second DCI format later than the slot for HARQ-ACK information in response to
a SPS PDSCH reception received after the PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI
format, and the second DCI format indicates a HARQ-ACK information report for
a same PDSCH group index as indicated by the first DCI format as described in
clause 9.1.3.3.
\- if the UE is provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback, the first DCI format
does not indicate SPS PDSCH release or SCell dormancy, the UE detects_ the
second DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion after the first one, and
the second DCI format includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK request field with value 1,
the UE includes the HARQ-ACK information in a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook, as
described in clause 9.1.4, and where the slot indicated by the value of the
PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the second DCI format is no
later than a slot for HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH
reception, if any, received after the PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI format.
\- if the UE is provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback-r16_ , the first DCI
format does not indicate SPS PDSCH release or SCell dormancy, and the UE
receives the second DCI format later than the slot for HARQ-ACK information in
response to a SPS PDSCH reception received after the PDSCH scheduled by the
first DCI format, and the second DCI format includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK
request field with value 1, the UE includes the HARQ-ACK information in a
Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook, as described in clause 9.1.4.
\- otherwise, the UE does not multiplex the corresponding HARQ-ACK information
in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission.
#### 9.1.3.1 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink control channel
A UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format scheduling
PDSCH receptions or SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell dormancy on an
active DL BWP of a serving cell $c$, as described in clause 10.1, and for
which the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH in slot $n$ based
on
\- PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values or a _dl-DataToUL-ACK_
, or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16_ , or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2_ value if the PDSCH-
to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field is not present in a DCI format, for

AggregationFactor, or pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16, or_ _repetitionNumber_ ,
when provided.
The set of PDCCH monitoring occasions for a DCI format scheduling PDSCH
receptions or SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell dormancy is defined as the
union of PDCCH monitoring occasions across active DL BWPs of configured
serving cells. PDCCH monitoring occasions are indexed in an ascending order of
their start times. The cardinality of the set of PDCCH monitoring occasions
defines a total number $M$ of PDCCH monitoring occasions.
A value of the counter downlink assignment indicator (DAI) field in DCI
formats denotes the accumulative number of {serving cell, PDCCH monitoring
occasion}-pair(s) in which PDSCH reception(s), SPS PDSCH release or SCell
dormancy indication associated with the DCI formats, excluding the SPS
activation DCI, is present up to the current serving cell and current PDCCH
monitoring occasion,

associated with the corresponding activation DCI, in the PUCCH in slot $n$,
the UE generates the HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.1.2 and
appends it to the $O^{\text{ACK}}$ HARQ-ACK information bits.
For a PDCCH monitoring occasion with DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception or
SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell dormancy in the active DL BWP of a
serving cell, when a UE receives a PDSCH with one transport block or a SPS
PDSCH release or indicating SCell dormancy and the value of
_maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI_ is 2, the HARQ-ACK information is associated
with the first transport block and the UE generates a NACK for the second
transport block if _harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH_ is not provided and
generates HARQ-ACK information with value of ACK for the second transport
block if _harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH_ is provided.
If a UE is not provided _PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission_ for each of the
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}}$ serving cells, or for PDSCH receptions
scheduled by a DCI format that does not support CBG-based PDSCH receptions, or
for SPS PDSCH reception, or for SPS PDSCH release, or for SCell dormancy
indication, and if $O_{\text{ACK}} + O_{\text{SR}} + O_{\text{CSI}} \leq 11$,
the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits $n_{\text{HARQ-ACK}}$
for obtaining a transmission power for a PUCCH, as described in clause 7.2.1,
as
$n_{\text{HARQ-ACK}} = n_{\text{HARQ-ACK,TB}} = \left( \left(
V_{\text{DAI},m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{DL}} - \sum_{c =
0}^{N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}} - 1}U_{\text{DAI,}c} \right)\text{mod}\left(

where
\- if $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}} = 1$,
$V_{DAI,m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{DL}}$ is the value of the counter DAI in the

the at least one DCI format that includes a total DAI field
\- $V_{DAI,m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{DL}} = 0$ if the UE does not detect any DCI
format scheduling PDSCH reception, indicating SPS PDSCH release or indicating
SCell dormancy for any serving cell $c$ in any of the $M$ PDCCH monitoring
occasions.
\- $U_{\text{DAI,}\text{c}}$ is the total number of a DCI format scheduling
PDSCH reception, indicating SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell dormancy
that the UE detects within the $M$ PDCCH monitoring occasions for serving cell
$c$. $U_{\text{DAI,}\text{c}} = 0$ if the UE does not detect any DCI format
scheduling PDSCH reception, indicating SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell
dormancy for serving cell $c$ in any of the $M$ PDCCH monitoring occasions.
\- $N_{TB,max}^{\text{DL}} = 2$ if the value of
_maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI_ is 2 for any serving cell $c$ and _harq-ACK-
SpatialBundlingPUCCH_ is not provided; otherwise, $N_{TB,max}^{\text{DL}} =
1$.
\- $N_{m,c}^{\text{received}}$ is the number of transport blocks the UE
receives in a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format that the UE detects in PDCCH

format that the UE detects and indicate SPS PDSCH release in PDCCH monitoring
occasion $m$ for serving cell $c$, or the number of DCI format that the UE

\- $N_{\text{SPS,}\text{c}}$ is the number of SPS PDSCH receptions by the UE
on serving cell $c$ for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK

\- instead of generating one HARQ-ACK information bit per transport block for
a serving cell from the $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,CBG}}$ serving cells, the

#### 9.1.3.2 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink shared channel
If a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format that does not
include a DAI field, then
_\- if the_ UE has not received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for
DCI formats scheduling PDSCH receptions, or SPS PDSCH release, or DCI format
1_1 indicating SCell dormancy on any serving cell $c$ and the UE does not have
HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception to multiplex in the
PUSCH, as described in clause 9.1.3.1 _,_ the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK
information in the PUSCH transmission;
\- else, the UE generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause
9.1.3.1, except that _harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH_ is replaced by _harq-ACK-
SpatialBundlingPUSCH_.
If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
scheduled by a DCI format that includes a DAI field, the UE generates the
HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1.3.1, with the following
modifications:
\- For the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause 9.1.3.1,
after the completion of the $c$ and $m$ loops, the UE sets ${V_{temp2} = V}_{T
- \text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ where $V_{T - \text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ is the value
of the DAI field according to Table 9.1.3-2
\- For the case of first and second HARQ-ACK sub-codebooks, the DCI format
includes a first DAI field corresponding to the first HARQ-ACK sub-codebook
and a second DAI field corresponding to the second HARQ-ACK sub-codebook
_\- harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH_ is replaced by _harq-ACK-
SpatialBundlingPUSCH_.
If a UE is not provided _PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission_ and the UE is
scheduled for a PUSCH transmission by DCI format that includes a DAI field
with value $V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$ and the UE has not received any
PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format scheduling
PDSCH receptions or SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell dormancy on any
serving cell $c$ and the UE does not have HARQ-ACK information in response to
a SPS PDSCH reception to multiplex in the PUSCH, as described in clause
9.1.3.1, the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH
transmission.
If a UE is provided _PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission_ and the UE is scheduled
for a PUSCH transmission by DCI format that includes a DAI field with first
value $V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$ or with second value
$V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$ and the UE has not received any PDCCH
within the monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format scheduling PDSCH
receptions or SPS PDSCH release, or DCI format 1_1 indicating SCell dormancy,
on any serving cell $c$ and the UE does not have HARQ-ACK information in
response to a SPS PDSCH reception to multiplex in the PUSCH, as described in

#### 9.1.3.3 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook grouping and HARQ-ACK retransmission
If a UE is provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16,_ the UE determines HARQ-ACK
information for multiplexing in a PUCCH transmission occasion according to the
following procedure.
Set $g$ to the value of a PDSCH group index field in a last DCI format that
provides a value of $g$ and indicates a PUCCH transmission occasion.
Set $i(g)$ to denote a PUCCH transmission occasion for multiplexing HARQ-ACK
information
Set $k$ to the value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing field, if any, in a
DCI format providing a value of $g$
\- If the DCI format does not include a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing field,
set $k$ to the value provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16_
Set $h(g)$ to the value of a first **New feedback indicator** field in the
last DCI format providing the value of $g$
Set $h^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}(g)$ to a value of a second **New feedback
indicator** field in the last DCI format providing the value of $g$
Set $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}$ to the value of a total DAI
field for group $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$ in the last DCI format providing
the value of $g$
\- If $g = 1$ and the UE detects a DCI format that does not include a PDSCH
group index field in a PDCCH reception that is after the PDCCH reception for
the last DCI format detection providing the value of $g$ and indicating a same
slot for a PUCCH transmission occasion, set $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1
\right)mod2} = \varnothing$
Set $q$ to the value of a number of requested PDSCH group(s) field in the last
DCI format providing the value of _g_
A UE does not expect to detect DCI formats with respective
\- Number of requested PDSCH group(s) field values of 0, and
\- PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing field values that indicate a same PUCCH
transmission occasion, and
\- PDSCH group index field values that are different
Generate first HARQ-ACK information for PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$ in
a slot, as described in clause 9.1.3.1, where
\- the first HARQ-ACK information corresponds only to detections of DCI
formats each providing a same value of $g$, of $h(g)$, and to detections of
DCI formats that do not provide a value of $g$ and $h(g)$ and are associated
with a same value of $g$, of $h(g)$, and at least one of the DCI formats
providing a value of $k$ indicating the slot
\- at least one of the DCI formats provides a $h(g)$ value
\- $m = 0$ corresponds to a PDCCH monitoring occasion, where the UE detects a
DCI format that provides a value of $g$ or is associated with a value of $g$,
that is the first PDCCH monitoring occasion after a PDCCH monitoring occasion
where the UE detects another DCI format that provides a value different than
$h(g)$
The generation of the first HARQ-ACK information for PUCCH transmission
occasion $i\left( g \right)$ in a slot, as described in clause 9.1.3.1,
excludes the generation of HARQ-ACK information for SPS PDSCH receptions.
If $h^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}\left( g \right) = \varnothing$ or $h^{\left(
g + 1 \right)mod2}\left( g \right) = h(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$, generate
second HARQ-ACK information for PUCCH transmission occasion $i(\left( g + 1
\right)mod2)$ in a slot, as described in clause 9.1.3.1, where
\- the second HARQ-ACK information corresponds to detections of DCI formats
each providing a same value of $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$, of $h(\left( g + 1
\right)mod2)$ and to detections of DCI formats that do not provide a value of
$\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$, of $h(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$, but are
associated with a same value of $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$, of $h(\left( g + 1
\right)mod2)$
\- at least one of the DCI formats provides a $h(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$
value
\- $m = 0$ corresponds to a PDCCH monitoring occasion, where the UE detects a
DCI format that provides a value of $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$ or that is
associated with a value of $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$, that is the first PDCCH
monitoring occasion after a PDCCH monitoring occasion where the UE detects
another DCI format that provides a value different than $h(\left( g + 1
\right)mod2)$
\- the PUCCH transmission occasion $i(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$ is a last one
for multiplexing second HARQ-ACK information and it is not after PUCCH
transmission occasion $i(g)$
\- if $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2} \neq \varnothing$, after the
completion of the $c$ and $m$ loops for the pseudo-code for the second HARQ-
ACK codebook generation in clause 9.1.3.1, set $V_{temp2} =
V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}$. If the UE is provided _PDSCH-
CodeBlockGroupTransmission_ for $N_{\text{cells}}^{DL,CBG}$ serving cells, set
$V_{temp2} = V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}$ for both sub-codebooks
before appending the second sub-codebook to the first sub-codebook.
If $h^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}\left( g \right) \neq \varnothing$ and
$h^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}\left( g \right) \neq h(\left( g + 1
\right)mod2)$, generate second HARQ-ACK information as described in clause
9.1.3.1 by setting $M = 0$ and, after the completion of the $c$ and $m$ loops
for the pseudo-code for the second HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause
9.1.3.1, setting $V_{temp2} = V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}$.
The generation of the second HARQ-ACK information for PUCCH transmission
occasion $i(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$ in a slot, as described in clause
9.1.3.1, excludes the generation of HARQ-ACK information for SPS PDSCH
receptions.
If $q = 0$, the UE
includes only the first HARQ-ACK information for multiplexing in PUCCH
transmission occasion $i(g)$
elseif $q = 1$
if g = 1
> appends the first HARQ-ACK information to the second HARQ-ACK information
> for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$
else
> append the second HARQ-ACK information to the first HARQ-ACK information for
> multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$
end if
end if
The UE appends the HARQ-ACK information corresponding to SPS PDSCH receptions,
if any, as described in clause 9.1.3.1, after the first and second, if any,
HARQ-ACK information.
If the HARQ-ACK information is multiplexed in a PUSCH transmission, the HARQ-
ACK information is determined as
\- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, if the PUSCH
transmission is not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format
that does not include a DCI field with value $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$
\- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, if the PUSCH
transmission is scheduled by a DCI format without _ul-TotalDAI-Included_
configured except that for PDSCH group $g$, the DCI field with value
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ in the DCI format is used after the completion of
the $c$ and $m$ loops for the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation
in clause 9.1.3.1, and when the HARQ-ACK information multiplexed in the PUCCH
transmission occasion $i\left( g \right)$ does not include HARQ-ACK
information for PDSCH group $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$
\- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, if the PUSCH
transmission is scheduled by a DCI format without _ul-TotalDAI-Included_
configured except that for PDSCH group $g = 0$, the DCI field with value
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ in the DCI format is used after the completion of
the $c$ and $m$ loops for the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation
in clause 9.1.3.1, and when the HARQ-ACK information multiplexed in the PUCCH
transmission occasion $i\left( g \right)$ includes HARQ-ACK information for
PDSCH groups $g$ and $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$
\- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, if the PUSCH
transmission is scheduled by a DCI format without _ul-TotalDAI-Included_
configured except that for PDSCH group $g = 0$, the DCI field with value in
the DCI format is used after the completion of the $c$ and $m$ loops for the
pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause 9.1.3.1, and when
the UE has not detected any DCI format scheduling PDSCH receptions, and the UE
has not detected any DCI format with a request for HARQ-ACK information for
any PDSCH group
\- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, if the PUSCH
transmission is scheduled by a DCI format with _ul-TotalDAI-Included_
configured except that MSBs of the DCI field with value
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ in the DCI format are used for PDSCH group $g =
0$, and LSBs of DCI field with value $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ in the DCI
format are used for PDSCH group $g = 1$, after the completion of the $c$ and
$m$ loops for the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause
9.1.3.1.
If a UE is scheduled a PUSCH transmission by DCI format 0_1 having a DAI field
value $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$ for a PDSCH group index, and the UE has
not detected any DCI format scheduling PDSCH receptions for the PDSCH group
index, and the UE has not detected any DCI format with a request for HARQ-ACK
information for the PDSCH group index, the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK
information in the PUSCH transmission for the PDSCH group index.
If a UE detects DCI formats with respective PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing
field values indicating a same PUCCH transmission occasion and none of the DCI
formats that the UE detects after a last PUCCH transmission occasion for $g =
0$ includes a **New feedback indicator** field for $g = 0$, and at least one
of the DCI formats is DCI format 1_0, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information
only for PDSCH receptions scheduled by detections of DCI format 1_0 and SPS
PDSCH releases indicated by detections of DCI format 1_0, as described in
clause 9.1.3.1 or 9.1.3.2 for multiplexing in the PUCCH transmission occasion.
If a DCI format indicating a slot for a PUCCH transmission occasion does not
include a New feedback indicator field, a PDSCH reception scheduled by the DCI
format or a SPS PDSCH release indicated by the DCI format is associated with
PDSCH group 0 and a value of _h_(_g_) associated with the DCI format is set
only if _h_(_g_) is provided by another DCI format that provides a value of
_h_(_g_) for PDSCH group 0 and indicates the slot for the PUCCH transmission
occasion.
For PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, the UE determines a PUCCH or a PUSCH
transmission to multiplex the HARQ-ACK information according to the procedures
in clauses 9.2.3 and 9.2.5.
If $O_{\text{ACK}} + O_{\text{SR}} + O_{\text{CSI}} \leq 11$, the UE
determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits $n_{HARQ - ACK,g}\ $for group
$g\ $and a number of HARQ-ACK information bits $n_{HARQ - ACK,(g + 1)mod2}$
for group $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$ as described in clause 9.1.3.1 where
$N_{\text{SPS},c}$ is included in $n_{HARQ - ACK,g}$ and, if $q = 1$ and
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2} \neq \varnothing$, the UE
determines $n_{HARQ - ACK,(g + 1)mod2}$ by setting
${V_{DAI,m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{DL}} = V}_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1
\right)mod2}$. For obtaining a PUCCH transmission power, if $q = 0$, $n_{HARQ
- ACK}\ = \ n_{HARQ - ACK,\ \ g}$; else, $n_{HARQ - ACK}\ = \ n_{HARQ - ACK,g}
+ n_{HARQ - ACK,\ \ (g + 1)mod2}$.
### 9.1.4 Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook determination
If a UE is provided _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback,_ the UE determines
${\widetilde{o}}_{0}^{\text{ACK}},{\widetilde{o}}_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\ldots,{\widetilde{o}}_{O_{\text{ACK}}
- 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ HARQ-ACK information bits, for a total number of
$O_{\text{ACK}}$ HARQ-ACK information bits, of a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook
according to the following procedure.
Set $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}}$ to the number of configured serving cells
Set $N_{HARQ,c}^{\text{DL}}$ to the value of _nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH_ for
serving cell $c$, if provided; else, set $N_{HARQ,c}^{\text{DL}} = 8$
Set $N_{TB,c}^{\text{DL}}$ to the value of _maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI_
for serving cell $c$ if _harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH_ is provided and
$\text{NDI}_{\text{HARQ}} = 0$, or if _harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH_ is not
provided, or if _maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock_ is provided for serving
cell $c$; else, set $N_{TB,c}^{\text{DL}} = 1$
Set $N_{HARQ - ACK,c}^{CBG/TB,max}$ to the number of HARQ-ACK information bits
per TB for PDSCH receptions on serving cell $c$ as described in clause 9.1.1
if _maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock_ is provided for serving cell $c$ and
_pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedbackCBG_ is provided; else, set $N_{HARQ -
ACK,c}^{CBG/TB,max} = 0$
Set $\text{NDI}_{\text{HARQ}} = 0$ if _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedbackNDI_ is
provided; else set $\text{NDI}_{\text{HARQ}} = 1$
Set $c = 0$ -- serving cell index

If $N_{TB,c}^{\text{DL}} > 1$, when a UE receives a PDSCH with one transport
block, the HARQ-ACK information is associated with the first transport block.
If a UE receives a SPS PDSCH, or a PDSCH that is scheduled by a DCI format
that does not support CBG-based PDSCH receptions for a serving cell $c$ and if
_maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock_ is provided for serving cell $c$, and
_pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedbackCBG_ is provided, the UE repeats $N_{HARQ -
ACK,c}^{CBG/TB,max}$ times the HARQ-ACK information for the transport block in
the PDSCH.
If a UE detects a DCI format that includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK request field
with value 1, the UE determines a PUCCH or a PUSCH to multiplex a Type-3 HARQ-
ACK codebook for transmission in a slot as described in clauses 9.2.3 and
9.2.5. The UE multiplexes only the Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook in the PUCCH or
the PUSCH for transmission in the slot.
If
\- a UE detects a DCI format that includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK request field
with value 1, and
\- the CRC of the DCI is scrambled by a C-RNTI or an MCS-C-RNTI, and
\- _resourceAllocation_ = _resourceAllocationType0_ and all bits of the
frequency domain resource assignment field in the DCI format are equal to 0,
or
\- _resourceAllocation_ = _resourceAllocationType1_ and all bits of the
frequency domain resource assignment field in the DCI format are equal to 1,
or
\- _resourceAllocation = dynamicSwitch_ and all bits of the frequency domain
resource assignment field in the DCI format are equal to 0 or 1
the DCI format provides a request for a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report and
does not schedule a PDSCH reception. The UE is expected to provide HARQ-ACK
information in response to the request for the Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook after
$N$ symbols from the last symbol of a PDCCH providing the DCI format, where
the value of $N$ for $\mu = 0,1,2$ is provided in clause 10.2 by replacing
\"SPS PDSCH release\" with \"DCI format\".
If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission, the UE
generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in this clause except that _harq-
ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH_ is replaced by _harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH_.
## 9.2 UCI reporting in physical uplink control channel
UCI types reported in a PUCCH include HARQ-ACK information, SR, LRR, and CSI.
UCI bits include HARQ-ACK information bits, if any, SR information bits, if
any, LRR information bit, if any, and CSI bits, if any. The HARQ-ACK
information bits correspond to a HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1.
For the remaining of this clause, any reference to SR is applicable for SR
and/or for LRR.
A UE may transmit one or two PUCCHs on a serving cell in different symbols
within a slot. When the UE transmits two PUCCHs in a slot and the UE is not
provided _ackNackFeedbackMode_ = _separate_ , at least one of the two PUCCHs
uses PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 2.
If a UE is provided _ackNackFeedbackMode_ = _separate, the UE_ may transmit up
to two PUCCHs with HARQ-ACK information in different symbols within a slot.
In clauses 9.2.3, 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2, a UE assumes 11 CRC bits if a number of
respective UCI bits is larger than or equal to 360; otherwise, the UE
determines a number of CRC bits based on the number of respective UCI bits as
described in [5, TS 38.212].
### 9.2.1 PUCCH Resource Sets
If a UE does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, provided by
_PUCCH-ResourceSet_ in _PUCCH-Config_ , a PUCCH resource set is provided by
_pucch-ResourceCommon_ through an index to a row of Table 9.2.1-1 for
transmission of HARQ-ACK information on PUCCH in an initial UL BWP of
$N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}$ PRBs.
The PUCCH resource set includes sixteen resources, each corresponding to a
PUCCH format, a first symbol, a duration, a PRB offset
$\text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}}$, and a cyclic shift index set for a
PUCCH transmission.
The UE transmits a PUCCH using frequency hopping if not provided
_useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon_ ; otherwise, _the UE transmits a
PUCCH without frequency hopping_.
An orthogonal cover code with index 0 is used for a PUCCH resource with PUCCH
format 1 in Table 9.2.1-1 except when index 3, 7, or 11 is indicated by
_pucch-ResourceCommon_ and _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon_ is
provided.
The UE transmits the PUCCH using the same spatial domain transmission filter
as for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant as described in clause
8.3.
If a UE is not provided any of _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook_ , _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-
Codebook-r16_ , or _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback_ , the UE generates at most
one HARQ-ACK information bit.
If the UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission in response to
detecting a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release or
indicating SCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH reception, the UE
determines a PUCCH resource with index $r_{\text{PUCCH}}$, $0{\leq
r}_{\text{PUCCH}} \leq 15$, as $r_{\text{PUCCH}} = \left\lfloor \frac{2{\cdot
n}_{CCE,0}}{N_{\text{CCE}}} \right\rfloor + 2 \cdot
\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{PRI}}$, where $N_{\text{CCE}}$ is a number of CCEs in a
CORESET of a PDCCH reception with the DCI format, as described in clause 10.1,
$n_{CCE,0}$ is the index of a first CCE for the PDCCH reception, and
$\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{PRI}}$ is a value of the PUCCH resource indicator
field in the DCI format.
If $\left\lfloor \frac{r_{\text{PUCCH}}}{8} \right\rfloor = 0$ and a UE is
provided a PUCCH resource by _pucch-ResourceCommon_ and is not provided
_useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon_
\- the UE determines the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the first hop
as $\text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}} + \left\lfloor
\frac{r_{\text{PUCCH}}}{N_{\text{CS}}} \right\rfloor$ and the PRB index of the
PUCCH transmission in the second hop as ${N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} - 1 -
RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}} - \left\lfloor
\frac{r_{\text{PUCCH}}}{N_{\text{CS}}} \right\rfloor$, where $N_{\text{CS}}$
is the total number of initial cyclic shift indexes in the set of initial
cyclic shift indexes
\- the UE determines the initial cyclic shift index in the set of initial
cyclic shift indexes as $r_{\text{PUCCH}}\text{mod}N_{\text{CS}}$
If $\left\lfloor \frac{r_{\text{PUCCH}}}{8} \right\rfloor = 1$ and a UE is
provided a PUCCH resource by _pucch-ResourceCommon_ and is not provided
_useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon_
\- the UE determines the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the first hop
as ${N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} - 1 - RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}} -
\left\lfloor \frac{\left( r_{\text{PUCCH}} - 8 \right)}{N_{\text{CS}}}
\right\rfloor$ and the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the second hop
as $\text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}} + \left\lfloor \frac{\left(
r_{\text{PUCCH}} - 8 \right)}{N_{\text{CS}}} \right\rfloor$
\- the UE determines the initial cyclic shift index in the set of initial
cyclic shift indexes as
If a UE is provided a PUCCH resource by _pucch-ResourceCommon_ and is provided
_useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon_
\- the UE determines for the PUCCH resource an interlace index $m$ as $m =
\left( m_{0} + \left\lfloor \frac{r_{\text{PUCCH}}}{N_{\text{CS}}}
\right\rfloor \right)\text{mod}M$ where $M$ is a number of interlaces [4, TS
38.211] and $m_{0} = \text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}}$ is an interlace
index offset and $\text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}}$ is as given in Table
9.2.1-1
\- the UE determines an initial cyclic shift index in a set of initial cyclic
shift indexes as $r_{\text{PUCCH}}\text{mod}N_{\text{CS}}$, where
$N_{\text{CS}}$ is the total number of initial cyclic shifts indexes in the
set of initial cyclic shift indexes in Table 9.2.1-1
\- if _pucch-ResourceCommon_ indicates
\- index 0: the first symbol is 9 for a PUCCH resource with PUCCH format 0 if
$r_{\text{PUCCH}} \geq 10$
\- index 1 or 2: the first symbol is 9 for a PUCCH resource with PUCCH format
0 if $r_{\text{PUCCH}} = 15$
\- index 3, 7, or 11: an orthogonal cover code with index 1 is used for a
PUCCH resource with PUCCH format 1 if $r_{\text{PUCCH}} \geq 10$; otherwise,
an orthogonal cover code with index 0 is used for a PUCCH resource with PUCCH
format 1
\- the UE does not expect _pucch-ResourceCommon_ to indicate index 15

If a UE has dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, the UE is provided by
higher layers with one or more PUCCH resources.
A PUCCH resource includes the following parameters:
\- a PUCCH resource index provided by _pucch-ResourceId_
\- an index of the first PRB prior to frequency hopping or for no frequency
hopping by _startingPRB_ , if a UE is not provided _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in
BWP-UplinkDedicated_
\- an index of the first PRB after frequency hopping by _secondHopPRB_ , if a
UE is not provided _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated_
\- an indication for intra-slot frequency hopping by
_intraSlotFrequencyHopping_ , if a UE is not provided _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH
in BWP-UplinkDedicated_
\- an index of a first interlace by _interlace0_ , if a UE is provided
_useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated_
\- if provided, an index of a second interlace by _interlace1_ , if a UE is
provided _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated_
\- an index of an RB set by _rb-SetIndex_ , if a UE is provided
_useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated_
\- a configuration for a PUCCH format provided by _format_
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not expect that
two hops of a PUCCH transmission are in different RB sets.
The UE expects that _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon and
useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated are provided either in all UL
BWPs or in none of the UL BWPs for a serving cell_.
If a UE is provided _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated_ , the UE
determines available RBs for PUCCH transmissions within the active UL BWP as
the intersection of RBs _corresponding to an interlace index provided by
interlace0 and, if provided, interlace1, and RBs of an RB set provided by rb-
SetIndex. The intersection results in_ $M_{\text{interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$
_RBs in the first interlace and the UE expects that_
$M_{\text{interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ _is either 10 or 11. If interlace1 is
provided, the intersection results in_ $M_{\text{interlace,1}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$
_RBs in the second interlace and the UE expects that_
$M_{\text{interlace,1}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ _is either 10 or 11._
If the _format_ indicates _PUCCH-format0_ , the PUCCH format configured for a
PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 0, where the PUCCH resource also includes an
index for an initial cyclic shift provided by _initialCyclicShift_ , a number
of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by _nrofSymbols_ , a first symbol
for the PUCCH transmission provided by _startingSymbolIndex_.
If the _format_ indicates _PUCCH-format1_ , the PUCCH format configured for a
PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 1, where the PUCCH resource also includes an
index for an initial cyclic shift provided by _initialCyclicShift_ , a number
of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by _nrofSymbols_ , a first symbol
for the PUCCH transmission provided by _startingSymbolIndex_ , and an index
for an orthogonal cover code by _timeDomainOCC_.
If the _format_ indicates _PUCCH-format2_ or _PUCCH-format3_ , the PUCCH
format configured for a PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3,
respectively, where the PUCCH resource also includes a number of PRBs provided
by _nrofPRBs_ , a number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by
_nrofSymbols_ , and a first symbol for the PUCCH transmission provided by
_startingSymbolIndex_. If a UE is provided by _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-
UplinkDedicated,_ and the _format_ indicates _PUCCH-format2_ or _PUCCH-format3
and PUCCH-ResourceExt_ is provided, the PUCCH resource also includes an index
of a second interlace by _interlace1, if provided_ ; otherwise, _if
interlace1_ is not provided, the PUCCH resource also includes, if provided, an
orthogonal cover code length by _occ-Length_ and an orthogonal cover code
index by _occ-Index_. If the _format_ indicates _PUCCH-format3 and PUCCH-
ResourceExt_ is provided _, the UE assumes that the_
$M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PUCCH,}3}$ _[4, TS 38.211] PRBs with the lowest indexes
within the first, and if configured, second interlace are used for PUCCH
transmission._
If the _format_ indicates _PUCCH-format4_ , the PUCCH format configured for a
PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 4, where the PUCCH resource also includes a
number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by _nrofSymbols_ , an
orthogonal cover code length by _occ-Length_ , an orthogonal cover code index
by _occ-Index_ , and a first symbol for the PUCCH transmission provided by
_startingSymbolIndex_.
If a UE is provided _subslotLengthForPUCCH_ in a _PUCCH-Config_ , the first
symbol of a PUCCH resource provided by _PUCCH-ResourceSet_ or _SPS-PUCCH-AN-
List_ in _PUCCH-Config_ or by _n1PUCCH-AN_ in SPS-Config for multiplexing
HARQ-ACK in a PUCCH transmission is relative to the first symbol of the
_subslotLengthForPUCCH_ symbols [12, TS 38.331]. For the remaining cases, the
first symbol of a PUCCH resource is relative to the first symbol of a slot
with $N_{\text{sym}}^{\text{slot}}$ symbols [4, TS 38.211].
A UE can be configured up to four sets of PUCCH resources in a _PUCCH-Config_.
A PUCCH resource set is provided by _PUCCH-ResourceSet_ and is associated with
a PUCCH resource set index provided by _pucch-ResourceSetId_ , with a set of
PUCCH resource indexes provided by _resourceList_ that provides a set of
_pucch-ResourceId_ used in the PUCCH resource set, and with a maximum number
of UCI information bits the UE can transmit using a PUCCH resource in the
PUCCH resource set provided by _maxPayloadSize_. For the first PUCCH resource
set, the maximum number of UCI information bits is 2. A maximum number of
PUCCH resource indexes for a set of PUCCH resources is provided by
_maxNrofPUCCH-ResourcesPerSet_. The maximum number of PUCCH resources in the
first PUCCH resource set is 32 and the maximum number of PUCCH resources in
the other PUCCH resource sets is 8.
If the UE transmits $O_{\text{UCI}}$ UCI information bits, that include HARQ-
ACK information bits, the UE determines a PUCCH resource set to be
\- a first set of PUCCH resources with _pucch-ResourceSetId_ = 0 if
$O_{\text{UCI}} \leq 2$ including 1 or 2 HARQ-ACK information bits and a
positive or negative SR on one SR transmission occasion if transmission of
HARQ-ACK information and SR occurs simultaneously, or
\- a second set of PUCCH resources with _pucch-ResourceSetId_ = 1, if provided
by higher layers, if ${2  \- the PUCCH resource does not include an orthogonal cover code, or the UE
> is provided _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH_ in _BWP-UplinkDedicated_
\- PUCCH format 4 if
\- the transmission is over 4 or more symbols,
\- the number of UCI bits is more than 2,
\- the PUCCH resource includes an orthogonal cover code and the UE is not
provided _useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH_ in _BWP-UplinkDedicated_
A spatial setting for a PUCCH transmission is provided by _PUCCH-
SpatialRelationInfo_ if the UE is configured with a single value for _pucch-
SpatialRelationInfoId_ ; otherwise, if the UE is provided multiple values for
_PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ , the UE determines a spatial setting for the
PUCCH transmission as described in [11, TS 38.321]. **The UE applies
corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] and a corresponding setting for a
spatial domain filter to transmit PUCCH** in the first slot that is after slot
where is the slot **where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK
information with ACK value corresponding to a PDSCH reception providing the
_PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ , each slot** consists of
$N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{slot}}$ symbols as defined in [4, TS 38.211], and is
the SCS configuration for the PUCCH
\- If _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ provides _ssb-Index_ , the UE transmits the
PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a reception of a SS/PBCH block
with index provided by _ssb-Index_ for a same serving cell or, if
_servingCellId_ is provided, for a serving cell indicated by _servingCellId_
\- else if _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ provides _csi-RS-Index_ , the UE
transmits the PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a reception of a
CSI-RS with resource index provided by _csi-RS-Index_ for a same serving cell
or, if _servingCellId_ is provided, for a serving cell indicated by
_servingCellId_
\- else _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ provides _srs_ , the UE transmits the
PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a transmission of a SRS with
resource index provided by _resource_ for a same serving cell _and/or active
UL BWP_ or, if _servingCellId_ and/or _uplinkBWP_ are provided, for a serving
cell indicated by _servingCellId and/or for an UL BWP indicated by uplinkBWP_
If a UE
\- is not provided _pathlossReferenceRSs_ in _PUCCH-PowerControl,_
\- is provided _enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUCCH_ , and
\- is not provided _PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo_ , _and_
\- is not provided _coresetPoolIndex_ value of 1 for any CORESET, or is
provided _coresetPoolIndex_ value of 1 for all CORESETs, in
_ControlResourceSet_ and no codepoint of a TCI field, if any, in a DCI format
of any search space set maps to two TCI states [5, TS 38.212]
_a spatial setting for a PUCCH transmission from the UE is same as a_ spatial
setting for PDCCH receptions by the UE in the CORESET with the lowest ID on
the active DL BWP of the PCell. For a PUCCH transmission over multiple slots,
a same spatial setting applies to the PUCCH transmission in each of the
multiple slots.
A number of DMRS symbols for a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 3 or 4 is
provided by _additionalDMRS_.
Use of π/2-BPSK, instead of QPSK, for a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format
3 or 4 is indicated by _pi2BPSK_.
### 9.2.3 UE procedure for reporting HARQ-ACK
A UE does not expect to transmit more than one PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information
in a slot per priority index, if the UE is not provided _ackNackFeedbackMode =
separate_.
For DCI format 1_0, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values
map to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. For a DCI format, other than DCI format 1_0,
the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values, if present, map to
values for a set of number of slots provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK, dl-DataToUL-
ACK-r16,_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2_ , as defined in Table 9.2.3-1.
If the UE is provided _subslotLengthForPUCCH_ , $n$ is the last UL slot that
overlaps with the PDSCH reception or with the PDCCH reception in case of SPS
PDSCH release or in case of SCell dormancy indication or in case of the DCI
format that requests Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report and does not schedule a
PDSCH reception; otherwise, $n$ is the last UL slot that overlaps with the DL
slot $n_{D}$ for the PDSCH reception or with the DL slot $n_{D}\ $for the
PDCCH reception in case of SPS PDSCH release or in case of SCell dormancy
indication or in case of the DCI format that requests Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook
report and does not schedule a PDSCH reception.
For a SPS PDSCH reception ending in DL slot $n_{D}$, the UE transmits the
PUCCH in UL slot $n + k$ where $k$ is provided by the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback
timing indicator field, if present, in a DCI format activating the SPS PDSCH
reception.
If the UE detects a DCI format that does not include a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback
timing indicator field and schedules a PDSCH reception or activates a SPS
PDSCH reception ending in DL slot $n_{D}$, the UE provides corresponding HARQ-
ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within UL slot $n + k$ where $k$ is
provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK_ , or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16,_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-
DCI-1-2_.
If the UE detects a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH reception ending in DL slot
$n_{D}$ or if the UE detects a DCI format indicating a SPS PDSCH release or
indicating SCell dormancy through a PDCCH reception ending in DL slot $n_{D}$,
or if the UE detects a DCI format that requests Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook
report and does not schedule a PDSCH reception through a PDCCH reception
ending in DL slot $n_{D}$, as described in clause 9.1.4, the UE provides
corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within UL slot $n +
k$, where $k$ is a number of slots and is indicated by the PDSCH-to-
HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the DCI format, if present, or
provided by _dl-DataToUL-ACK_ , _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16,_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-
DCI-1-2_.
A PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information is subject to the limitations
for UE transmissions described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1.

For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, a UE determines a PUCCH
resource after determining a set of PUCCH resources for HARQ-ACK information
bits, as described in clause 9.2.1. The PUCCH resource determination is based
on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212], if present, in a last DCI
format, excluding the SPS activation DCI, among the DCI formats that have a
value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a
value of _dl-DataToUL-ACK_ , _or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16,_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-
DCI-1-2_ , indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that the UE
detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in
the PUCCH where, for PUCCH resource determination, detected DCI formats are
first indexed in an ascending order across serving cells indexes for a same
PDCCH monitoring occasion and are then indexed in an ascending order across
PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes. For indexing DCI formats within a serving
cell for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, if the UE is not provided
_coresetPoolIndex_ or is provided _coresetPoolIndex_ with value 0 for one or
more first CORESETs and is provided _coresetPoolIndex_ with value 1 for one or
more second CORESETs on an active DL BWP of a serving cell, and with
_ackNackFeedbackMode_ = _joint for the active UL BWP, detected DCI formats
from PDCCH receptions in the first CORESETs are indexed prior to detected DCI
formats from PDCCH receptions in the second CORESETs_.
The PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of PUCCH
resource indexes, as defined in Table 9.2.3-2 for a PUCCH resource indicator
field of 3 bits, provided by _resourceList_ for PUCCH resources from a set of
PUCCH resources provided by _PUCCH-ResourceSet_ with a maximum of eight PUCCH
resources. If the PUCCH resource indicator field includes 1 bit or 2 bits, the
values map to the first two values or the first four values, respectively, of
Table 9.2.3-2. If the last DCI format does not include a PUCCH resource
indicator field, the first value of Table 9.2.3-2 is used.
For the first set of PUCCH resources and when the size of _resourceList_ is
larger than eight, when a UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH
transmission in response to detecting a last DCI format in a PDCCH reception,
excluding the SPS activation DCI, among DCI formats with a value of the PDSCH-
to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a value of _dl-
DataToUL-ACK_ , _or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16,_ or _dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2_ ,
indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, the UE determines a PUCCH
resource with index , , as
where is a number of CCEs in CORESET of the PDCCH reception for the DCI format
as described in clause 10.1, is the index of a first CCE for the PDCCH
reception, and $\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{PRI}}$ is a value of the PUCCH resource
indicator field in the DCI format. If the DCI format does not include a PUCCH
resource indicator field, $\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{PRI}} = 0$.

If a UE determines a first resource for a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK
information corresponding only to a PDSCH reception without a corresponding
PDCCH or detects a first DCI format indicating a first resource for a PUCCH
transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a slot and also
detects at a later time a second DCI format indicating a second resource for a
PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the slot, the UE
does not expect to multiplex HARQ-ACK information corresponding to the second
DCI format in a PUCCH resource in the slot if the PDCCH reception that
includes the second DCI format is not earlier than from the beginning of a
first symbol of the first resource for PUCCH transmission in the slot where,
$\kappa$ and $T_{c}$ are defined in clause 4.1 of [4, TS 38.211] and
corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations of
the PDCCHs providing the DCI formats and the SCS configuration of the PUCCH.

corresponding HARQ-ACK information multiplexed in the PUCCH transmission in
the slot, for , for , for ; otherwise , for , for , for , for .
If a UE _is not provided SPS-PUCCH-AN-List and_ transmits HARQ-ACK information
corresponding only to a PDSCH reception without a corresponding PDCCH, which
includes the first SPS PDSCH reception associated with the corresponding
activation DCI, a PUCCH resource for corresponding PUCCH transmission with
HARQ-ACK information is provided by _n1PUCCH-AN_.
If a UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH format 0, the
UE determines values and for computing a value of cyclic shift [4, TS 38.211]
where is provided by _initialCyclicShift_ of _PUCCH-format0_ or, if
_initialCyclicShift_ is not provided, by the initial cyclic shift index as
described in clause 9.2.1 and is determined from the value of one HARQ-ACK
information bit or from the values of two HARQ-ACK information bits as in
Table 9.2.3-3 and Table 9.2.3-4, respectively.

If a UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH format 1, the
UE is provided a value for by _initialCyclicShift_ of _PUCCH-format1_ or, if
_initialCyclicShift_ is not provided, by the initial cyclic shift index as
described in clause 9.2.1.
If a UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information bits and bits using PUCCH
format 2 or PUCCH format 3 in a PUCCH resource that includes PRBs, the UE
determines a number of PRBs for the PUCCH transmission to be the minimum
number of PRBs, that is smaller than or equal to a number of PRBs provided
respectively by _nrofPRBs_ of _PUCCH-format2_ or _nrofPRBs_ of _PUCCH-format3_
and start from the first PRB from the number of PRBs, that results to and, if
, , where , , , and are defined in clause 9.2.5.2. For PUCCH format 3, if is
not equal according to [4, TS 38.211], is increased to the nearest allowed
value of _nrofPRBs_ for _PUCCH-format3_ [12, TS 38.331]. If , the UE transmits
the PUCCH over PRBs.
If a UE is provided a first interlace of
$M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ PRBs by _interlace0_ in
_InterlaceAllocation_ and transmits a PUCCH with $O_{\text{ACK}}$ HARQ-ACK
information bits and $O_{\text{CRC}}$ bits using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH
format 3, the UE transmits the PUCCH over the first interlace if $\left(
O_{\text{ACK}} + O_{\text{CRC}} \right) \leq
M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot N_{\text{sc,ctrl}}^{\text{RB}}
\cdot N_{\text{symb-UCI}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot Q_{m} \cdot r$; otherwise, if
the UE is provided a second interlace by _interlace1_ in _PUCCH-format2_ or
_PUCCH-format3_ , the UE transmits the PUCCH over the first and second
interlaces.
### 9.2.4 UE procedure for reporting SR
A UE can be configured by _SchedulingRequestResourceConfig_ a set of
configurations for SR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or
PUCCH format 1. A UE can be configured by _schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell_ a
configuration for LRR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or
PUCCH format 1. A UE can be configured by _schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell_ a
configuration for consistent LBT failure recovery, as described in [11, TS
38.321], in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format
1. The UE can be provided, by _phy-PriorityIndex_ in
_SchedulingRequestResourceConfig_ , a priority index 0 or a priority index 1
for the SR. If the UE is not provided a priority index for SR, the priority
index is 0.
The UE is configured a PUCCH resource by _SchedulingRequestResourceId_ , or by
_schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell_ , or by _schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell_ ,
providing a PUCCH format 0 resource or a PUCCH format 1 resource as described
in clause 9.2.1. The UE is also configured a periodicity in symbols or slots
and an offset in slots by _periodicityAndOffset_ for a PUCCH transmission
conveying SR. If is larger than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission
occasion in a PUCCH to be in a slot with number [4, TS 38.211] in a frame with
number if .
If is one slot, the UE expects that and every slot is a SR transmission
occasion in a PUCCH.
If is smaller than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a
PUCCH to start in a symbol with index [4, TS 38.211] if where is the value of
_startingSymbolIndex_.
If the UE determines that, for a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH, the
number of symbols available for the PUCCH transmission in a slot is smaller
than the value provided by _nrofSymbols_ , the UE does not transmit the PUCCH
in the slot.
SR transmission occasions in a PUCCH are subject to the limitations for UE
transmissions described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1.
The UE transmits a PUCCH in the PUCCH resource for the corresponding SR
configuration only when the UE transmits a positive SR. For a positive SR
transmission using PUCCH format 0, the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in
[4, TS 38.211] by obtaining as described for HARQ-ACK information in clause
9.2.3 and by setting . For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 1,
the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by setting .
### 9.2.5 UE procedure for reporting multiple UCI types
This clause is applicable to the case that a UE has resources for PUCCH
transmissions or for PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions that overlap in time and
each PUCCH transmission is over a single slot without repetitions. Any case
that a PUCCH transmission is with repetitions over multiple slots is described
in clause 9.2.6. If a UE is configured with multiple PUCCH resources in a slot
to transmit CSI reports
\- if the UE is not provided _multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList_ or if PUCCH
resources for transmissions of CSI reports do not overlap in the slot, the UE
determines a first resource corresponding to a CSI report with the highest
priority [6, TS 38.214]
\- if the first resource includes PUCCH format 2, and if there are remaining
resources in the slot that do not overlap with the first resource, the UE
determines a CSI report with the highest priority, among the CSI reports with
corresponding resources from the remaining resources, and a corresponding
second resource as an additional resource for CSI reporting
\- if the first resource includes PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4, and if
there are remaining resources in the slot that include PUCCH format 2 and do
not overlap with the first resource, the UE determines a CSI report with the
highest priority, among the CSI reports with corresponding resources from the
remaining resources, and a corresponding second resource as an additional
resource for CSI reporting
\- if the UE is provided _multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList_ and if any of the
multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports in a
resource from the resources provided by _multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList_ , as
described in clause 9.2.5.2.
A UE multiplexes DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, and CSI
report(s) in a same PUCCH if the UE is provided _simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI_ ;
otherwise, the UE drops the CSI report(s) and includes only DL HARQ-ACK
information, with or without SR, in the PUCCH. If the UE would transmit
multiple PUCCHs in a slot that include DL HARQ-ACK information and CSI
report(s), the UE expects to be provided a same configuration for
_simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI_ each of PUCCH formats 2, 3, and 4.
If a UE would multiplex CSI reports that include Part 2 CSI reports in a PUCCH
resource, the UE determines the PUCCH resource and a number of PRBs for the
PUCCH resource or a number of Part 2 CSI reports assuming that each of the CSI
reports indicates rank 1.
If a UE would transmit multiple overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or overlapping
PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot and, when applicable as described in clauses
9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2, the UE is configured to multiplex different UCI types in
one PUCCH, and at least one of the multiple overlapping PUCCHs or PUSCHs is in
response to a DCI format detection by the UE, the UE multiplexes all
corresponding UCI types if the following conditions are met. If one of the
PUCCH transmissions or PUSCH transmissions is in response to a DCI format
detection by the UE, the UE expects that the first symbol $S_{0}$ of the
earliest PUCCH or PUSCH, among a group overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs in the
slot, satisfies the following timeline conditions
\- $S_{0}$ is not before a symbol with CP starting after
$T_{proc,1}^{\text{mux}}$ after a last symbol of any corresponding PDSCH,
$T_{proc,1}^{\text{mux}}$ is given by maximum of $\left{
T_{proc,1}^{mux,1},\cdots,T_{proc,1}^{mux,i},\cdots \right}$ where for the
i-th PDSCH with corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission on a PUCCH which is in the
group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, $T_{proc,1}^{mux,i} = \left( N_{1} +
d_{1,1} + 1 \right) \cdot \left( 2048 + 144 \right) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{-
\mu} \cdot T_{C}$, $d_{1,1}$ is selected for the i-th PDSCH following [6, TS
38.214], $N_{1}$ is selected based on the UE PDSCH processing capability of
the i-th PDSCH and SCS configuration $\mu$, where $\mu$ corresponds to the
smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations used for the PDCCH
scheduling the i-th PDSCH, the i-th PDSCH, the PUCCH with corresponding HARQ-
ACK transmission for the i-th PDSCH, and all PUSCHs in the group of
overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs.
\- $S_{0}$ is not before a symbol with CP starting after
$T_{proc,release}^{\text{mux}}$ after a last symbol of any corresponding SPS
PDSCH release or of a DCI format 1_1 indicating SCell dormancy as described in
clause 10.3, or of a DCI format 1_1 indicating a request for a Type-3 HARQ-ACK
codebook report without scheduling PDSCH. $T_{proc,release}^{\text{mux}}$ is
given by maximum of $\left{
T_{proc,release}^{mux,1},\cdots,T_{proc,release}^{mux,i},\cdots \right}$ where
for the i-th PDCCH providing the SPS PDSCH release or the DCI format 1_1 with
corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission on a PUCCH which is in the group of
overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, $T_{proc,release}^{mux,i} = \left( N + 1
\right) \cdot \left( 2048 + 144 \right) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{- \mu} \cdot
T_{C}$, $N$ as described in clause 10.2, or DCI format 1_1 that requests
Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report as described in clause 10.2, or the DCI format
1_1 indicating SCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH reception as
described in clause 10.3, where $\mu$ corresponds to the smallest SCS
configuration among the SCS configurations used for the PDCCH providing the
i-th SPS PDSCH release or the DCI format 1_1, the PUCCH with corresponding
HARQ-ACK transmission for the i-th SPS PDSCH release or the DCI format 1_1,
and all PUSCHs in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs.
\- if there is no aperiodic CSI report multiplexed in a PUSCH in the group of
overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, $S_{0}$ is not before a symbol with CP starting
after $T_{proc,2}^{\text{mux}}$ after a last symbol of
\- any PDCCH with the DCI format scheduling an overlapping PUSCH, and
\- any PDCCH scheduling a PDSCH or SPS PDSCH release, or a DCI format 1_1

If a UE would transmit multiple overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or overlapping
PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot, one of the PUCCHs includes HARQ-ACK
information in response to an SPS PDSCH reception, and any PUSCH is not in
response to a DCI format detection, the UE expects that the first symbol of
the earliest PUCCH or PUSCH satisfies the first of the previous timeline
conditions with the exception that components associated to a SCS
configuration for a PDCCH scheduling a PDSCH or a PUSCH are absent from the
timeline conditions.
A UE does not expect a PUCCH or a PUSCH that is in response to a DCI format
detection to overlap with any other PUCCH or PUSCH that does not satisfy the
above timing conditions.
A UE that
\- is not provided _coresetPoolIndex_ or is provided _coresetPoolIndex_ with a
value of 0 for first CORESETs on active DL BWPs of serving cells, and
\- is provided _coresetPoolIndex_ with a value of 1 for second CORESETs on
active DL BWPs of the serving cells, and
\- is provided _ackNackFeedbackMode_ = _separate_
does not expect a PUCCH or a PUSCH transmission triggered by a detection of a
DCI format in a PDCCH received in a CORESET from the first CORESETs to overlap

If a UE would transmit multiple PUCCHs in a slot that include HARQ-ACK
information, and/or SR, and/or CSI reports and any PUCCH with HARQ-ACK
information in the slot satisfies the above timing conditions and does not
overlap with any other PUCCH or PUSCH in the slot that does not satisfy the
above timing conditions, the UE multiplexes the HARQ-ACK information, and/or
SR, and/or CSI reports and determines corresponding PUCCH(s) for transmission
in the slot according to the following pseudo-code. If the multiple PUCCHs do
not include HARQ-ACK information and do not overlap with any PUSCH
transmission by the UE in response to a DCI format detection by the UE, the
timing conditions do not apply.

#### 9.2.5.0 UE procedure for prioritization between SL HARQ-ACK information
in a PUCCH and DL HARQ-ACK or SR or CSI in a PUCCH
The priority value of a PUCCH transmission is as described in clause
16.2.4.3.1.
For prioritization between SL HARQ-ACK information in a first PUCCH and DL
HARQ-ACK or SR or CSI in a second PUCCH
\- if the second PUCCH has priority index 1,
\- if _sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC_ is provided
\- the UE transmits the first PUCCH if a smallest priority value of the first
PUCCH is smaller than _sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC;_ otherwise, the UE
transmits the second PUCCH
\- else
\- the UE transmits the second PUCCH
\- else
\- the UE transmits the first PUCCH if the smallest priority value of the
first PUCCH is smaller than _sl-PriorityThreshold;_ otherwise, the UE
transmits the second PUCCH
When the UE determines to transmit the second PUCCH, the UE determines a
single resource for multiplexing UCI in the second PUCCH as described in
clauses 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2.
#### 9.2.5.1 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK or CSI and SR in a PUCCH
In the following, a UE is configured to transmit $K$ PUCCHs for respective $K$
SRs in a slot, as determined by a set of _schedulingRequestResourceId_ , a
_schedulingRequestResourceId associated with_ _schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell_
, and a _schedulingRequestResourceId associated with_ _schedulingRequestID-
LBT-SCell_ , with SR transmission occasions that would overlap with a
transmission of a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information from the UE in the slot or
with a transmission of a PUCCH with CSI report(s) from the UE in the slot.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with positive SR and at most two HARQ-ACK
information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 0, the UE transmits the
PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 0 in PRB(s) for HARQ-ACK information
as described in clause 9.2.3. The UE determines a value of and for computing a
value of cyclic shift [4, TS 38.211] where is provided by _initialCyclicShift_
of _PUCCH-format0_ , and is determined from the value of one HARQ-ACK
information bit or from the values of two HARQ-ACK information bits as in
Table 9.2.5-1 and Table 9.2.5-2, respectively.
If the UE would transmit negative SR and a PUCCH with at most two HARQ-ACK
information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 0, the UE transmits the
PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 0 for HARQ-ACK information as
described in clause 9.2.3.
Table 9.2.5-1: Mapping of values for one HARQ-ACK information bit and positive
SR to sequences for PUCCH format 0

positive SR to sequences for PUCCH format 0
* * *
HARQ-ACK Value {0, 0} {0, 1} {1, 1} {1, 0} **Sequence cyclic shift**
* * *
If a UE would transmit SR in a resource using PUCCH format 0 and HARQ-ACK
information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 1 in a slot, the UE
transmits only a PUCCH with the HARQ-ACK information bits in the resource
using PUCCH format 1.
If the UE would transmit positive SR in a first resource using PUCCH format 1
and at most two HARQ-ACK information bits in a second resource using PUCCH
format 1 in a slot, the UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information bits in
the first resource using PUCCH format 1 as described in clause 9.2.3. If a UE
would not transmit a positive SR in a resource using PUCCH format 1 and would
transmit at most two HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource using PUCCH
format 1 in a slot, the UE transmits a PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH
format 1 for HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.2.3.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource
using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4 in a slot, as
described in clauses 9.2.1 and 9.2.3, bits representing a negative or positive
SR, in ascending order of the values of _schedulingRequestResourceId_ , a
_schedulingRequestResourceId associated with schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell_ ,
and a _schedulingRequestResourceId associated with_ _schedulingRequestID-LBT-
SCell_ , are appended to the HARQ-ACK information bits and the UE transmits
the combined UCI bits in a PUCCH using a resource with PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH
format 3 or PUCCH format 4 that the UE determines as described in clauses
9.2.1 and 9.2.3. If one of the SRs is a positive LRR, the value of the bits
indicates the positive LRR. An all-zero value for the bits represents a
negative SR value across all $K$ SRs.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with CSI report bits in a resource using PUCCH
format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4 in a slot, bits representing
corresponding negative or positive SR, in ascending order of the values of
_schedulingRequestResourceId_ , a _schedulingRequestResourceId associated with
schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell_ , and a _schedulingRequestResourceId associated
with_ _schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell_ , are prepended to the CSI information
bits as described in clause 9.2.5.2 and the UE transmits a PUCCH with the
combined UCI bits in a resource using the PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or
PUCCH format 4 for CSI reporting. If one of the SRs is a positive LRR, the
value of the bits indicates the positive LRR. An all-zero value for the bits
represents a negative SR value across all $K$ SRs.
If a UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information bits, SR bits, and CRC
bits using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 in a PUCCH resource that includes
PRBs, the UE determines a number of PRBs for the PUCCH transmission to be the
minimum number of PRBs, that is smaller than or equal to a number of PRBs
provided respectively by _nrofPRBs_ in _PUCCH-format2_ or _nrofPRBs_ in
_PUCCH-format3_ and starts from the first PRB from the number of PRBs, that
results to and, if , , where , , , and are defined in clause 9.2.5.2. For
PUCCH format 3, if is not equal according to [4, TS 38.211], is increased to
the nearest allowed value of _nrofPRBs_ for _PUCCH-format3_ [12, TS 38.331].
If , the UE transmits the PUCCH over the PRBs.
If a UE is provided a first interlace of
$M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ PRBs by _interlace0_ in
_InterlaceAllocation_ and transmits a PUCCH with $O_{\text{ACK}}$ HARQ-ACK
information bits, $O_{\text{SR}} = \left\lceil \log_{2}\left( K + 1 \right)
\right\rceil$ SR bits, and $O_{\text{CRC}}$ CRC bits using PUCCH format 2 or
PUCCH format 3, the UE transmits the PUCCH over the first interlace if $\left(
O_{\text{ACK}} + O_{\text{SR}} + O_{\text{CRC}} \right) \leq
M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot N_{\text{sc,ctrl}}^{\text{RB}}
\cdot N_{\text{symb-UCI}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot Q_{m} \cdot r$; otherwise, if
the UE is provided a second interlace by _interlace1_ in _PUCCH-format2_ or
_PUCCH-format3_ , the UE transmits the PUCCH over the first and second
interlaces.
#### 9.2.5.2 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK/SR/CSI in a PUCCH
For a transmission occasion of a single CSI report, a PUCCH resource is
provided by _pucch-CSI-ResourceList_. For a transmission occasion of multiple
CSI reports, corresponding PUCCH resources can be provided by _multi-CSI-
PUCCH-ResourceList_. If a UE is provided first and second _PUCCH-Config_ ,
_multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList_ is provided by the first  _PUCCH-Config_ , and
_PUCCH-ResourceId_ in _pucch-CSI-ResourceList_ or _multi-CSI-PUCCH-
ResourceList_ indicates a corresponding PUCCH resource in _PUCCH-Resource_
provided by the first _PUCCH-Config_.
If a UE is provided only one PUCCH resource set for transmission of HARQ-ACK
information in response to PDSCH reception scheduled by a DCI format or in
response to a SPS PDSCH release or in response to a SCell dormancy indication,
the UE does not expect to be provided _simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI_.
A UE is configured by _maxCodeRate_ a code rate for multiplexing HARQ-ACK, SR,
and CSI report(s) in a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 2, PUCCH format
3, or PUCCH format 4.
If a UE transmits CSI reports using PUCCH format 2, the UE transmits only
wideband CSI for each CSI report [6, TS 38.214]. In the following, a Part 1
CSI report refers either to a CSI report with only wideband CSI or to a Part 1
CSI report with wideband CSI and sub-band CSI.

For PUCCH formats 1, 3, or 4, a UE can be configured a number of slots,
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$, for repetitions of a PUCCH transmission by
respective _nrofSlots_. If a UE is provided a  _PUCCH-config_ that includes

$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots

slots has a same number of consecutive symbols, as provided by _nrofSymbols_
in _PUCCH-format1_ , _nrofSymbols_ in _PUCCH-format3_ , or _nrofSymbols_ in
_PUCCH-format4_
\- a PUCCH transmission in each of the $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$
slots has a same first symbol, as provided by _startingSymbolIndex_ in _PUCCH-
format1_ , _startingSymbolIndex_ in _PUCCH-format3_ , or _startingSymbolIndex_
in _PUCCH-format4_
\- the UE is configured by _interslotFrequencyHopping_ whether or not to
perform frequency hopping for PUCCH transmissions in different slots
\- if the UE is configured to perform frequency hopping for PUCCH
transmissions across different slots
\- the UE performs frequency hopping per slot
\- the UE transmits the PUCCH starting from a first PRB, provided by
_startingPRB_ , in slots with even number and starting from the second PRB,
provided by _secondHopPRB_ , in slots with odd number. The slot indicated to
the UE for the first PUCCH transmission has number 0 and each subsequent slot
until the UE transmits the PUCCH in $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots
is counted regardless of whether or not the UE transmits the PUCCH in the slot
\- the UE does not expect to be configured to perform frequency hopping for a
PUCCH transmission within a slot
\- If the UE is not configured to perform frequency hopping for PUCCH
transmissions across different slots and if the UE is configured to perform
frequency hopping for a PUCCH transmission within a slot, the frequency
hopping pattern between the first PRB and the second PRB is same within each
slot
If the UE determines that, for a PUCCH transmission in a slot, the number of
symbols available for the PUCCH transmission is smaller than the value
provided by _nrofSymbols_ for the corresponding PUCCH format, the UE does not
transmit the PUCCH in the slot.
A SS/PBCH block symbol is a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with candidate SS/PBCH
block index corresponding to the SS/PBCH block index indicated to a UE by
_ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ or _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in
_ServingCellConfigCommon, as described in clause 4.1_.
For unpaired spectrum, the UE determines the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots for a PUCCH transmission starting
from a slot indicated to the UE as described in clause 9.2.3 for HARQ-ACK
reporting, or a slot determined as described in clause 9.2.4 for SR reporting
or in clause 5.2.1.4 of [6, TS 38.214] for CSI reporting and having
\- an UL symbol, as described in clause 11.1, or flexible symbol that is not
SS/PBCH block symbol provided by _startingSymbolIndex_ in _PUCCH-format1_ , or
in _PUCCH-format3_ , or in _PUCCH-format4_ as a first symbol, and
\- consecutive UL symbols, as described in clause 11.1, or flexible symbols
that are not SS/PBCH block symbols, starting from the first symbol, equal to
or larger than a number of symbols provided by _nrofsymbols_ in _PUCCH-
format1_ , or in _PUCCH-format3_ , or in _PUCCH-format4_
For paired spectrum or supplementary uplink band, the UE determines the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots for a PUCCH transmission as the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ consecutive slots starting from a slot
indicated to the UE as described in clause 9.2.3 for HARQ-ACK reporting, or a
slot determined as described in clause 9.2.4 for SR reporting or in clause
5.2.1.4 of [6, TS 38.214] for CSI reporting.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over a first number
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}} > 1$ of slots and the UE would transmit a
PUSCH with repetition Type A over a second number of slots, and the PUCCH
transmission would overlap with the PUSCH transmission in one or more slots,
and the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for multiplexing the UCI in the PUSCH are
satisfied in the overlapping slots, the UE transmits the PUCCH and does not
transmit the PUSCH in the overlapping slots.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over a first number
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}} > 1$ of slots and the UE would transmit a
PUSCH with repetition Type B over a second number of slots, and the PUCCH
transmission would overlap with actual PUSCH repetitions in one or more slots,
and the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for multiplexing the UCI in the PUSCH are
satisfied for the overlapping actual PUSCH repetitions, the UE transmits the
PUCCH and does not transmit the overlapping actual PUSCH repetitions.
A UE does not multiplex different UCI types in a PUCCH transmission with
repetitions over $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}} > 1$ slots. If a UE would
transmit a first PUCCH over more than one slot and at least a second PUCCH
over one or more slots, and the transmissions of the first PUCCH and the
second PUCCH would overlap in a number of slots then, for each slot of the
number of slots and with UCI type priority of HARQ-ACK > SR > CSI with higher
priority > CSI with lower priority, the UE determines an earliest first PUCCH
in a slot with the order of earliest starting symbol followed by longest
duration and the second PUCCHs overlapping with the earliest first PUCCH, and
then performs the following
\- the UE does not expect more than one PUCCH from the first PUCCH and the
second PUCCHs to start at a same slot and include a UCI type with same
priority
\- if more than one PUCCH from the first PUCCH and the second PUCCHs include a
UCI type with the same highest priority, the UE transmits the PUCCH with the
highest priority starting at an earliest slot and does not transmit the other
PUCCHs, otherwise,
\- the UE transmits the PUCCH that includes the UCI type with the highest
priority and does not transmit the PUCCHs that include the UCI type with lower
priority
The UE repeats the above procedure until there is no PUCCH overlapping with
any PUCCH with repetitions in the slot.
A UE does not expect a PUCCH that is in response to a DCI format detection to
overlap with any other PUCCH that does not satisfy the corresponding timing
conditions in clause 9.2.5.
If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots
and the UE does not transmit the PUCCH in a slot from the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots due to overlapping with another PUCCH
transmission in the slot, the UE counts the slot in the number of
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots.
For DAPS operation, if a UE would transmit a PUCCH over
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots on the source MCG and the UE does not
transmit the PUCCH in a slot from the $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots
due to overlapping in time with UE transmission on the target MCG in the slot,
the UE counts the slot in the number of $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$
slots.
## 9.3 UCI reporting in physical uplink shared channel
Offset values are defined for a UE to determine a number of resources for
multiplexing HARQ-ACK information and for multiplexing CSI reports in a PUSCH.
Offset values are also defined for multiplexing CG-UCI [5, TS 38.212] in a CG-
PUSCH. The offset values are signalled to a UE either by a DCI format
scheduling the PUSCH transmission or by higher layers.
If a DCI format that does not include a beta_offset indicator field schedules
the PUSCH transmission from the UE and the UE is provided _betaOffsets =
\'semiStatic\' or betaOffsetsDCI-0-2 = \'semiStaticDCI-0-2\'_ , the UE applies
the , , and values that are provided by _betaOffsets = \'semiStatic\'_ for DCI
formats 0_0/0_1 or by _betaOffsetsDCI-0-2 = \'semiStaticDCI-0-2\'_ for DCI
format 0_2 for the corresponding HARQ-ACK information, Part 1 CSI reports and
Part 2 CSI reports.
If the PUSCH transmission is with a configured grant and the UE is provided
_CG-UCI-OnPUSCH= \'semiStatic\'_ , the UE applies the , , and values that are
provided by _CG-UCI-OnPUSCH = \'semiStatic\'_ for the corresponding HARQ-ACK
information, Part 1 CSI reports and Part 2 CSI reports.
If the PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0_0 and the UE is provided
_betaOffsets = \'dynamic\'_ , the UE applies the , , and values that are
determined from the first value of _betaOffsets = \'dynamic\'_.
If the PUSCH is a configured grant Type 2 PUSCH activated by DCI format 0_0
and the UE is provided _CG-UCI-OnPUSCH_ =_\'dynamic\'_ , the UE applies the ,
, and values that are determined from the first value of _CG-UCI-OnPUSCH =
\'dynamic\'_.
HARQ-ACK information offsets are configured to values according to Table
9.3-1. The _betaOffsetACK-Index1_ , _betaOffsetACK-Index2_ , and
_betaOffsetACK-Index3_ respectively provide indexes , , and for the UE to use
if the UE multiplexes up to 2 HARQ-ACK information bits, more than 2 and up to
11 HARQ-ACK information bits, and more than 11 bits in the PUSCH,
respectively.
Part 1 CSI report and Part 2 CSI report offsets and , respectively, are
configured to values according to Table 9.3-2. The _betaOffsetCSI-
Part1-Index1_ and _betaOffsetCSI-Part2-Index1_ respectively provide indexes
and for the UE to use if the UE multiplexes up to 11 bits for Part 1 CSI
reports or Part 2 CSI reports in the PUSCH. The _betaOffsetCSI-Part1-Index2_
and _betaOffsetCSI-Part2-Index2_ respectively provide indexes or for the UE to
use if the UE multiplexes more than 11 bits for Part 1 CSI reports or Part 2
CSI reports in the PUSCH.
If a DCI format that includes a beta_offset indicator field with one bit or
two bits, as configured by _UCI-OnPUSCH_ for DCI format 0_1 or by _UCI-
OnPUSCH-DCI-0-2_ for DCI format 0_2, schedules the PUSCH transmission from the
UE, the UE is provided by each of {_betaOffsetACK-Index1_ , _betaOffsetACK-
Index2_ , _betaOffsetACK-Index3_} a set of two or four indexes, by each of
{_betaOffsetCSI-Part1-Index1_ , _betaOffsetCSI-Part1-Index2_} a set of two or
four indexes, and by each of {_betaOffsetCSI-Part2-Index1_ , _betaOffsetCSI-
Part2-Index2_} a set of two or four indexes from Tables 9.3-1 and 9.3-2,
respectively, for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information, Part 1 CSI reports, and
Part 2 CSI reports, respectively, in the PUSCH transmission. The beta_offset
indicator field indicates a value, a value and a value from the respective
sets of values, with the mapping defined in Table 9.3-3 and in Table 9.3-3A.
For a PUSCH transmission that is configured by a _ConfiguredGrantConfig_ , and
includes CG-UCI, the UE multiplexes CG-UCI in the PUSCH transmission if the UE
is provided by _betaOffsetCG-UCI_ a $I_{\text{offset}}^{\text{CG-UCI}}$ value,
from a set of values, with the mapping defined in Table 9.3-1. If the UE
multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission, as described in
clause 9.2.5, the UE jointly encodes the HARQ-ACK information and the CG-UCI
[5, TS 38.212] and determines a number of resources for multiplexing the
combined information in a PUSCH using $\beta_{\text{offset}}^{HARQ - ACK}$
which provides indexes $I_{offset,1}^{HARQ - ACK}$ and $I_{offset,2}^{HARQ -
ACK}$ for the UE to use if the UE multiplexes up to 11, and more than 11
combined information bits, respectively.

# 10 UE procedure for receiving control information
If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures
described in this clause for both MCG and SCG except for PDCCH monitoring in
Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS sets where the UE is not required to apply the procedures
in this clause for the SCG
\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell, serving cells belonging to
the MCG respectively.
\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell), serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term \'primary cell\' in
this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.
A UE monitors a set of PDCCH candidates in one or more CORESETs on the active
DL BWP on each activated serving cell configured with PDCCH monitoring
according to corresponding search space sets where monitoring implies decoding
each PDCCH candidate according to the monitored DCI formats.
If a UE is provided _monitoringCapabilityConfig_ for a serving cell, the UE
obtains an indication to monitor PDCCH on the serving cell for a maximum
number of PDCCH candidates and non-overlapping CCEs
\- per slot, as in Tables 10.1-2 and 10.1-3, if _monitoringCapabilityConfig_ =
_r15monitoringcapability_ , or
\- per span, as in Tables 10.1-2A and 10.1-3A, if _monitoringCapabilityConfig_
= _r16monitoringcapability_
If the UE is not provided _monitoringCapabilityConfig_ , the UE monitors PDCCH
on the serving cell for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and non-
overlapping CCEs per slot.
A UE can indicate a capability to monitor PDCCH according to one or more of
the combinations $\left( X,Y \right)$ = (2, 2), (4, 3), and (7, 3) per SCS
configuration of $\mu = 0$ and $\mu = 1$. A span is a number of consecutive
symbols in a slot where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH. Each PDCCH
monitoring occasion is within one span. If a UE monitors PDCCH on a cell
according to combination $\left( X,Y \right)$, the UE supports PDCCH
monitoring occasions in any symbol of a slot with minimum time separation of
$X$ symbols between the first symbol of two consecutive spans, including
across slots. A span starts at a first symbol where a PDCCH monitoring
occasion starts and ends at a last symbol where a PDCCH monitoring occasion
ends, where the number of symbols of the span is up to $Y$.
If a UE indicates a capability to monitor PDCCH according to multiple $\left(
X,Y \right)$ combinations and a configuration of search space sets to the UE
for PDCCH monitoring on a cell results to a separation of every two
consecutive PDCCH monitoring spans that is equal to or larger than the value
of $X$ for one or more of the multiple combinations $\left( X,Y \right)$, the
UE monitors PDCCH on the cell according to the combination $\left( X,Y
\right)$, from the one or more combinations $\left( X,Y \right)$, that is
associated with the largest maximum number of $M_{\text{PDCCH}}^{max,\left(
X,Y \right),\mu}$ and $C_{\text{PDCCH}}^{max,\left( X,Y \right),\mu}$ defined
in Table 10.1-2A and Table 10.1-3A. The UE expects to monitor PDCCH according
to the same combination $\left( X,Y \right)$ in every slot on the active DL
BWP of a cell.
A UE capability for PDCCH monitoring per slot or per span on an active DL BWP
of a serving cell is defined by a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and non-
overlapped CCEs the UE can monitor per slot or per span, respectively, on the
active DL BWP of the serving cell.
For monitoring of a PDCCH candidate by a UE, if the UE
\- has received _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ and has not received _ssb-
PositionsInBurst_ in _ServingCellConfigCommon_ for a serving cell, and
\- does not monitor PDCCH candidates in a Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
\- at least one RE for a PDCCH candidate overlaps with at least one RE of a
candidate SS/PBCH block corresponding to a SS/PBCH block index provided by
_ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ ,
the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate.
For monitoring of a PDCCH candidate by a UE, if the UE
\- has received _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _ServingCellConfigCommon_ for a
serving cell, and
\- does not monitor PDCCH candidates in a Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
\- at least one RE for a PDCCH candidate overlaps with at least one RE of a
candidate SS/PBCH block corresponding to a SS/PBCH block index provided by
_ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _ServingCellConfigCommon_ ,
the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate.
If a UE monitors the PDCCH candidate for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the serving
cell according to the procedure described in clause 13, the UE may assume that
no SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used for monitoring the PDCCH candidate
on the serving cell.
If _at least one RE of a PDCCH candidate for a UE on the serving cell overlaps
with at least one RE of lte-CRS-ToMatchAround_ , _or_ of _LTE-CRS-PatternList_
, _the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate_.
If a UE is provided _availableRB-SetsPerCell,_ the UE is not required to
monitor PDCCH candidates that overlap with any RB from RB sets that are
indicated as unavailable for receptions by an available RB set indicator field
in DCI format 2_0 as described in clause 11.1.1. If the UE does not obtain the
available RB set indicator for a symbol, the UE monitors PDCCH candidates on
all RB sets in the symbol.
If a UE can support
\- a first set of $N_{\text{cells,0}}^{\text{DL}}$ serving cells where the UE
is either not provided _coresetPoolIndex_ or is provided _coresetPoolIndex_
with a single value for all CORESETs on all DL BWPs of each scheduling cell
from the first set of serving cells, and
\- a second set of $N_{\text{cells,1}}^{\text{DL}}$ serving cells where the UE
is not provided _coresetPoolIndex_ or is provided _coresetPoolIndex_ with a
value 0 for a first CORESET, and with a value 1 for a second CORESET on any DL
BWP of each scheduling cell from the second set of serving cells
the UE determines, for the purpose of reporting _pdcch-BlindDetectionCA_ , a
number of serving cells as $N_{\text{cells,0}}^{\text{DL}} + R \cdot
N_{\text{cells,1}}^{\text{DL}}$ where $R$ is a value reported by the UE.
If a UE indicates in _UE-NR-Capability_ a carrier aggregation capability
larger than 4 serving cells and the UE is not provided
_monitoringCapabilityConfig_ for any downlink cell or if the UE is provided
_monitoringCapabilityConfig_ = _r15monitoringcapability_ for all downlink
cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE includes in _UE-NR-Capability_ an
indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and for a maximum number
of non-overlapped CCEs the UE can monitor per slot when the UE is configured
for carrier aggregation operation over more than 4 cells. When a UE is not
configured for NR-DC operation, the UE determines a capability to monitor a
maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs
per slot that corresponds to $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}}$ downlink cells,
where
\- $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}}$ is $N_{\text{cells,0}}^{\text{DL}} + R
\cdot N_{\text{cells,1}}^{\text{DL}}$ if the UE does not provide _pdcch-
BlindDetectionCA_ where $N_{\text{cells,0}}^{\text{DL}} +
N_{\text{cells,1}}^{\text{DL}}$ is the number of configured downlink serving
cells
\- otherwise, $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}}$ is the value of _pdcch-
BlindDetectionCA_
When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE determines a capability to
monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-
overlapped CCEs per slot that corresponds to $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}} =
N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{MCG}}$ downlink cells for the MCG where
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{MCG}}$ is provided by _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for the
MCG and determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH
candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per slot that
corresponds to $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}} = N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{SCG}}$
downlink cells for the SCG where $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{SCG}}$ is provided
by _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for the SCG. When the UE is configured for carrier
aggregation operation over more than 4 cells, or for a cell group when the UE
is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to monitor per slot
a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger
than the maximum number as derived from the corresponding value of
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}}$.
When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation with a total of $N_{NR -
DC}^{DL,cells}$ downlink cells on both the MCG and the SCG, the UE expects to
be provided _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for the MCG and _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for
the SCG with values that satisfy
\- _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for the MCG + _pdcch-BlindDetection_ for the SCG \= pdcch-
BlindDetectionCA._
_Otherwise,_ if $N_{NR - DC,max}^{DL,cells}$ is a maximum total number of
downlink cells that the UE can be configured on both the MCG and the SCG for
NR-DC as indicated in _UE-NR-Capability_ ,
\- the value range of _pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE_ or of _pdcch-
BlindDetectionSCG-UE_ is [1, 2, 3], and
_\- pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE_ \+ _pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE >=_ $N_{NR -
DC,max}^{DL,cells}$.
If a UE indicates in _UE-NR-Capability_ a carrier aggregation capability
larger than two downlink cells, the UE includes in _UE-NR-Capability_ an
indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of
non-overlapped CCEs that the UE can monitor per span when the UE is configured
for carrier aggregation operation over more than two downlink cells with
_monitoringCapabilityConfig_ = _r16monitoringcapability_. When a UE is not
configured for NR-DC operation and the UE is provided
_monitoringCapabilityConfig_ = _r16monitoringcapability_ for all downlink cell
where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE determines a capability to monitor a
maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs
per span that corresponds to $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap} - r16}$ downlink
cells, where
\- $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap} - r16}$ is the number of configured downlink
cells if the UE does not provide _pdcch-MonitoringCA_
\- otherwise, $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap} - r16}$ is the value of _pdcch-
MonitoringCA_
When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation and the UE is provided
_monitoringCapabilityConfig_ = _r16monitoringcapability_ for all downlink
cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE determines a capability to monitor a
maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs
per span that corresponds to
\- $N_{\text{cells}}^{cap - r16} = \ N_{cells,\ r16}^{\text{MCG}}$ downlink
cells for the MCG where $N_{cells,\ r16}^{\text{MCG}}$ is provided by _pdcch-
BlindDetection2_ for the MCG, and
\- $N_{\text{cells}}^{cap - r16} = \ N_{cells,\ r16}^{\text{SCG}}$ downlink
cells for the SCG where $N_{cells,\ r16}^{\text{SCG}}$ is provided by _pdcch-
BlindDetection2_ for the SCG
When the UE is configured for carrier aggregation operation over more than 2
cells, or for a cell group when the UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the
UE does not expect to monitor per span a number of PDCCH candidates or a
number of non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as
derived from the corresponding value of $N_{\text{cells}}^{cap - r16}$.
When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation with a total of $N_{NR -
DC}^{DL,cells}$ downlink cells on both the MCG and the SCG and the UE is
provided _monitoringCapabilityConfig_ = _r16monitoringcapability_ for all
downlink cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE expects to be provided
_pdcch-BlindDetection2_ for the MCG and _pdcch-BlindDetection2_ for the SCG
with values that satisfy
\- _pdcch-BlindDetection2_ for the MCG + _pdcch-BlindDetection2_ for the SCG
\=
pdcch-MonitoringCA._
_Otherwise,_ if $N_{NR - DC,\ \ max,\ r16}^{DL,cells}$ is a maximum total
number of downlink cells for which the UE is provided
_monitoringCapabilityConfig_ = _r16monitoringcapability_ and the UE is
configured on both the MCG and the SCG for NR-DC as indicated in _UE-NR-
Capability_
\- the value of _pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE-r16_ or of _pdcch-
BlindDetectionSCG-UE-r16_ is 1,
_\- pdcch-BlindDetectionMCG-UE-r16_ \+ _pdcch-BlindDetectionSCG-UE-r16 >=_
$N_{NR - DC,\ \ max,\ r16}^{DL,cells}$.
If a UE indicates in _UE-NR-Capability_ a carrier aggregation capability
larger than one downlink cell with _monitoringCapabilityConfig_ =
_r15monitoringcapability_ or larger than one downlink cell with
_monitoringCapabilityConfig_ = _r16monitoringcapability_ , the UE includes in
_UE-NR-Capability_ an indication for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and

## 10.1 UE procedure for determining physical downlink control channel
assignment
A set of PDCCH candidates for a UE to monitor is defined in terms of PDCCH
search space sets. A search space set can be a CSS set or a USS set. A UE
monitors PDCCH candidates in one or more of the following search spaces sets
\- a Type0-PDCCH CSS set configured by _pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ in _MIB_ or by
_searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCH-ConfigCommon_ or by _searchSpaceZero_ _in PDCCH-
ConfigCommon_ for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI on the primary
cell of the MCG
\- a Type0A-PDCCH CSS set configured by _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_
_in PDCCH-ConfigCommon_ for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI on
the primary cell of the MCG
\- a Type1-PDCCH CSS set configured by _ra-SearchSpace_ _in PDCCH-
ConfigCommon_ for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a RA-RNTI, a MsgB-RNTI,
or a TC-RNTI on the primary cell
\- a Type2-PDCCH CSS set configured by _pagingSearchSpace_ _in PDCCH-
ConfigCommon_ for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a P-RNTI on the primary
cell of the MCG
\- a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by _SearchSpace_ in _PDCCH-Config_ with
_searchSpaceType_ = _common_ for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by INT-RNTI,
SFI-RNTI, TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, TPC-SRS-RNTI, or CI-RNTI and, only
for the primary cell, C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, CS-RNTI(s), or PS-RNTI and
\- a USS set configured by _SearchSpace_ in _PDCCH-Config_ with
_searchSpaceType_ = _ue-Specific_ for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by
C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, CS-RNTI(s), SL-RNTI, SL-CS-RNTI, or SL Semi-
Persistent Scheduling V-RNTI.
For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided _searchSpaceSIB1_ for Type0-PDCCH CSS
set by _PDCCH-ConfigCommon_ , the UE does not monitor PDCCH candidates for a
Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The Type0-PDCCH CSS set is defined by the
CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation
level given in Table 10.1-1. If the active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP have
same SCS and same CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the
CORESET with index 0, or the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, the CORESET
configured for Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set has search space set index 0.
For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ for
Type0A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set
on the DL BWP. The CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates
per CCE aggregation level for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.
For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided _ra-SearchSpace_ for Type1-PDCCH CSS
set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP _._
If the UE has not been provided a Type3-PDCCH CSS set or a USS set and the UE
has received a C-RNTI and has been provided a Type1-PDCCH CSS set, the UE
monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI format 0_0 and DCI format 1_0 with CRC
scrambled by the C-RNTI in the Type1-PDCCH CSS set.
If a UE is not provided _pagingSearchSpace_ for Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE
does not monitor PDCCH for Type2-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE
aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation
level for Type2-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.
If a UE is provided a zero value for _searchSpaceID in PDCCH-ConfigCommon_
_for_ a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring occasions for
PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set as described in clause 13,
and the UE is provided a C-RNTI, the UE monitors PDCCH candidates only at
monitoring occasions associated with a SS/PBCH block, where the SS/PBCH block
is determined by the most recent of
\- a MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state of the active BWP that
includes a CORESET with index 0, as described in [6, TS 38.214], where the
TCI-state includes a CSI-RS which is quasi-co-located with the SS/PBCH block,
or
\- a random access procedure that is not initiated by a PDCCH order that
triggers a contention-free random access procedure
If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by a
C-RNTI and the UE is provided a non-zero value for _searchSpaceID in PDCCH-
ConfigCommon_ _for_ a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines monitoring
occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set based on the
search space set associated with the value of _searchSpaceID_.
The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions
in the CORESET configured by _pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ in _MIB, the DM-RS antenna
port associated with_ corresponding PDSCH receptions, and the corresponding
SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-
location \'typeA\' and \'typeD\' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214],
if the UE is not provided a TCI state indicating quasi co-location information
of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for
the DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation
without shared spectrum channel access, a SCS is provided by
_subCarrierSpacingCommon_ in _MIB_. For operation with shared spectrum channel
access, a SCS is same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block.
For single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a same
frequency band, a UE does not expect to monitor a PDCCH in a
Type0/0A/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in a USS set if a DM-RS for monitoring a PDCCH
in a Type1-PDCCH CSS set is not configured with same _qcl-Type_ set to
\'typeD\' properties [6, TS 38.214] with a DM-RS for monitoring the PDCCH in
the Type0/0A/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in the USS set, and if the PDCCH or an
associated PDSCH overlaps in at least one symbol with a PDCCH the UE monitors
in a Type1-PDCCH CSS set or with an associated PDSCH.
If a UE is provided
\- one or more search space sets by corresponding one or more of
_searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ ,
_pagingSearchSpace_ , _ra-SearchSpace_ , and
\- a C-RNTI, an MCS-C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI
the UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI format 0_0 and DCI format 1_0 with
CRC scrambled by the C-RNTI, the MCS-C-RNTI, or the CS-RNTI in the one or more
search space sets in a slot where the UE monitors PDCCH candidates for at
least a DCI format 0_0 or a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, RA-
RNTI, MsgB-RNTI, or P-RNTI.
If a UE is provided
\- one or more search space sets by corresponding one or more of
_searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ ,
_pagingSearchSpace_ , _ra-SearchSpace_ , or a CSS set by _PDCCH-Config_ , and
\- a SI-RNTI, a P-RNTI, a RA-RNTI, a MsgB-RNTI, a SFI-RNTI, an INT-RNTI, a
TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, a TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, or a TPC-SRS-RNTI
then, for a RNTI from any of these RNTIs, the UE does not expect to process
information from more than one DCI format with CRC scrambled with the RNTI per
slot.

For same cell scheduling or for cross-carrier scheduling, a UE does not expect
a number of PDCCH candidates, and a number of corresponding non-overlapped
CCEs per slot or per span on a secondary cell to be larger than the
corresponding numbers that the UE is capable of monitoring on the secondary

capable of monitoring on the primary cell per span.
For cross-carrier scheduling, the number of PDCCH candidates for monitoring

multiple CORESETs that have been configured with same or different _qcl-Type_
set to \'typeD\' properties on active DL BWP(s) of one or more cells
the UE monitors PDCCHs only in a CORESET, and in any other CORESET from the
multiple CORESETs that have been configured with _qcl-Type_ set to same
\'typeD\' properties as the CORESET, on the active DL BWP of a cell from the
one or more cells
\- the CORESET corresponds to the CSS set with the lowest index in the cell
with the lowest index containing CSS, if any; otherwise, to the USS set with
the lowest index in the cell with lowest index
\- the lowest USS set index is determined over all USS sets with at least one
PDCCH candidate in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions
\- for the purpose of determining the CORESET, a SS/PBCH block is considered
to have different QCL \'typeD\' properties than a CSI-RS
\- for the purpose of determining the CORESET, a first CSI-RS associated with
a SS/PBCH block in a first cell and a second CSI-RS in a second cell that is
also associated with the SS/PBCH block are assumed to have same QCL \'typeD\'
properties
\- the allocation of non-overlapping CCEs and of PDCCH candidates for PDCCH
monitoring is according to all search space sets associated with the multiple
CORESETs on the active DL BWP(s) of the one or more cells
\- the number of active TCI states is determined from the multiple CORESETs
If a UE
\- is configured for single cell operation or for operation with carrier
aggregation in a same frequency band, and
\- monitors PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring occasions in
multiple CORESETs where none of the CORESETs has TCI-states configured with
_qcl-Type_ set to \'typeD\',
the UE is required to monitor PDCCH candidates in overlapping PDCCH monitoring
occasions for search space sets associated with different CORESETs.
For a scheduled cell and at any time, a UE expects to have received at most 16
PDCCHs for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, or MCS-C-RNTI
scheduling 16 PDSCH receptions for which the UE has not received any
corresponding PDSCH symbol and at most 16 PDCCHs for DCI formats with CRC
scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, or MCS-C-RNTI scheduling 16 PUSCH transmissions
for which the UE has not transmitted any corresponding PUSCH symbol.
If a UE is not provided _monitoringCapabilityConfig_ =
_r16monitoringcapability_ for any serving cell, and
\- is not configured for NR-DC operation and indicates through _pdcch-
BlindDetectionCA_ a capability to monitor PDCCH candidates for
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}} \geq 4$ downlink cells and the UE is configured

$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{UL}}$ uplink cells.
If a UE is provided _monitoringCapabilityConfig_ = _r16monitoringcapability
for at least one serving cell and is not provided monitoringCapabilityConfig_
= _r16monitoringcapability for at least one serving cell, and_
\- is not configured for NR-DC operation, and indicates a capability to
monitor PDCCH candidates for $N_{cells,r15}^{cap - r16} \geq 1$ downlink cells
and $N_{cells,r16}^{cap - r16} \geq 1$ downlink cells, and the UE is
configured with $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}} > 1$ downlink cell or
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{UL}} > 1$ uplink cell, _or_
\- is configured with NR-DC operation and for a cell group with
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}}$ downlink cells or

the UE expects to have respectively received
\- at most ${16 \bullet N}_{cells,r15}^{cap - r16}$ PDCCHs for DCI formats
with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI, or a MCS-C-RNTI scheduling ${16

\bullet N}_{cells,r16}^{cap - r16}$ PUSCH transmissions for which the UE has
not transmitted any corresponding PUSCH symbol over all serving cells that are
provided _monitoringCapabilityConfig_ = _r16monitoringcapability_
If a UE
\- is configured to monitor a first PDCCH candidate for a DCI format 0_0 and a
DCI format 1_0 from a CSS set and a second PDCCH candidate for a DCI format
0_0 and a DCI format 1_0 from a USS set in a CORESET with index zero on an
active DL BWP, and
\- the DCI formats 0_0/1_0 associated with the first PDCCH candidate and the
DCI formats 0_0/1_0 associated with the second PDCCH candidate have same size,
and
\- the UE receives the first PDCCH candidate and the second PDCCH candidate
over a same set of CCEs, and
\- the first PDCCH candidate and the second PDCCH candidate have identical
scrambling, and
\- the DCI formats 0_0/1_0 for the first PDCCH candidate and the DCI formats
0_0/1_0 for the second PDCCH candidate have CRC scrambled by either C-RNTI, or
MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI
the UE decodes only the DCI formats 0_0/1_0 associated with the first PDCCH
candidate.
If a UE detects a DCI format with inconsistent information, the UE discards
**all** the information in the DCI format.
A UE configured with a bandwidth part indicator in a DCI format determines, in
case of an active DL BWP or of an active UL BWP change, that the information
in the DCI format is applicable to the new active DL BWP or UL BWP,
respectively, as described in clause 12.
For unpaired spectrum operation, if a UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH
transmission on serving cell $c_{2}$, the UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH
on serving cell $c_{1}$ if the PDCCH overlaps in time with SRS transmission
(including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time [10, TS
38.133]) on serving cell $c_{2}$ and if the UE is not capable of simultaneous
reception and transmission on serving cell $c_{1}$and serving cell $c_{2}$.
If a UE is provided _resourceBlocks_ and s _ymbolsInResourceBlock_ in
_RateMatchPattern_ , or if the UE is additionally provided
_periodicityAndPattern_ in _RateMatchPattern_ , the UE can determine a set of
RBs in symbols of a slot that are not available for PDSCH reception as
described in [6, TS 38.214]. If a PDCCH candidate in a slot is mapped to one
or more REs that overlap with REs of any RB in the set of RBs in symbols of
the slot, the UE does not expect to monitor the PDCCH candidate.
A UE does not expect to be configured with _dci-FormatsSL_ and _dci-
FormatsExt_ in a same USS.
## 10.2 PDCCH validation for DL SPS and UL grant Type 2
A UE validates, for scheduling activation or scheduling release, a DL SPS
assignment PDCCH or a configured UL grant Type 2 PDCCH if
\- the CRC of a corresponding DCI format is scrambled with a CS-RNTI provided
by _cs-RNTI_ , and
\- the new data indicator field in the DCI format for the enabled transport
block is set to \'0\', and
\- the DFI flag field, if present, in the DCI format is set to \'0\', and
\- the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format indicates a row
with single SLIV, and
\- _if validation is for_ scheduling activation and if the PDSCH-to-
HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the DCI format is present, the PDSCH-
to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field does not provide an inapplicable value
from _dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16_.
If a UE is provided a single configuration for UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or for
SPS PDSCH, validation of the DCI format is achieved if all fields for the DCI
format are set according to Table 10.2-1 or Table 10.2-2.
If a UE is provided more than one configurations for UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or
for SPS PDSCH, a value of the HARQ process number field in a DCI format
indicates an activation for a corresponding UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or for a SPS
PDSCH configuration with a same value as provided by
_ConfiguredGrantConfigIndex_ or by _sps-ConfigIndex_ , respectively.
Validation of the DCI format is achieved if the RV field for the DCI format is
set as in Table 10.2-3.
If a UE is provided more than one configuration for UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or
for SPS PDSCH
\- if the UE is provided _ConfiguredGrantConfigType2DeactivationStateList_ or
_sps-ConfigDeactivationStateList_ , a value of the HARQ process number field
in a DCI format indicates a corresponding entry for scheduling release of one
or more UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or SPS PDSCH configurations
\- if the UE is not provided _ConfiguredGrantConfigType2DeactivationStateList_
or _sps-ConfigDeactivationStateList_ , a value of the HARQ process number
field in a DCI format indicates a release for a corresponding UL grant Type 2
PUSCH or for a SPS PDSCH configuration with a same value as provided by
_ConfiguredGrantConfigIndex_ or by _sps-ConfigIndex_ , respectively
Validation of the DCI format is achieved if all fields for the DCI format are
set according to Table 10.2-4.
If validation is achieved, the UE considers the information in the DCI format
as a valid activation or valid release of DL SPS or configured UL grant Type
2. If validation is not achieved, the UE discards all the information in the
DCI format.

A UE is expected to provide HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH
release after $N$ symbols from the last symbol of a PDCCH providing the SPS
PDSCH release. If _processingType2Enabled_ of _PDSCH-ServingCellConfig_ is set
to _enable_ for the serving cell with the PDCCH providing the SPS PDSCH
release, $N = 5$ for $\mu = 0$, $N = 5.5$ for $\mu = 1$, and $N = 11$ for $\mu
= 2$, otherwise, $N = 10$ for $\mu = 0$, $N = 12$ for $\mu = 1$, $N = 22$ for
$\mu = 2$, and $N = 25$ for $\mu = 3$, wherein $\mu$ corresponds to the
smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH
providing the SPS PDSCH release and the SCS configuration of a PUCCH carrying
the HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH release.
## 10.2A PDCCH validation for SL configured grant Type 2
A UE validates, for scheduling activation or scheduling release, a SL
configured grant Type 2 PDCCH if
\- the CRC of a corresponding DCI format 3_0 is scrambled with a SL-CS-RNTI
provided by _sl-CS-RNTI_ , and
\- the new data indicator field in the DCI format 3_0 for the enabled
transport block is set to \'0\'
Validation of the DCI format 3_0 is achieved if all fields for the DCI format
3_0 are set according to Table 10.2A-1 or Table 10.2A-2.
If validation is achieved, the UE considers the information in the DCI format
3_0 as a valid activation or valid release of SL configured grant Type 2. If
validation is not achieved, the UE discards all the information in the DCI
format 3_0.

## 10.3 PDCCH monitoring indication and dormancy/non-dormancy behaviour for
SCells
A UE configured with DRX mode operation [11, TS 38.321] can be provided the
following for detection of a DCI format 2_6 in a PDCCH reception on the PCell
or on the SpCell [12, TS 38.331]
\- a PS-RNTI for DCI format 2_6 by _ps-RNTI_
\- a number of search space sets, by _dci-Format2-6,_ to monitor PDCCH for
detection of DCI format 2_6 on the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell
according to a common search space as described in clause 10.1
\- a payload size for DCI format 2_6 by _sizeDCI-2-6_
\- a location in DCI format 2_6 of a Wake-up indication bit by _ps-
PositionDCI-2-6_
\- a \'0\' value for the Wake-up indication bit, when reported to higher
layers, indicates to not start the _drx-onDurationTimer_ for the next long DRX
cycle [11, TS 38.321]
\- a \'1\' value for the Wake-up indication bit, when reported to higher
layers, indicates to start the _drx-onDurationTimer_ for the next long DRX
cycle [11, TS 38.321]
\- a bitmap, when the UE is provided a number of groups of configured SCells
by _dormancyGroupOutsideActiveTime_ , where
\- the bitmap location is immediately after the Wake-up indication bit
location
\- the bitmap size is equal to the number of groups of configured SCells where
each bit of the bitmap corresponds to a group of configured SCells from the
number of groups of configured SCells
\- a \'0\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates an active DL BWP, provided
by _dormantBWP-Id_ , for the UE [11, TS 38.321] for each activated SCell in
the corresponding group of configured SCells
\- a \'1\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates
\- an active DL BWP, provided by _firstOutsideActiveTimeBWP-Id,_ for the UE
for each activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured SCells, if a
current active DL BWP is the dormant DL BWP
\- a current active DL BWP _,_ for the UE for each activated SCell in the
corresponding group of configured SCells, if the current active DL BWP is not
the dormant DL BWP
\- the UE sets the active DL BWP to the indicated active DL BWP
\- an offset by _ps-Offset_ indicating a time, where the UE starts monitoring
PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2_6 according to the number of search space
sets, prior to a slot where the _drx-onDurationTimer_ would start on the PCell
or on the SpCell [11, TS 38.321]
\- for each search space set, the PDCCH monitoring occasions are the ones in
the first $T_{\text{s}}$ slots indicated by _duration_ , or $T_{\text{s}} = 1$
slot if _duration_ is not provided, starting from the first slot of the first
$T_{\text{s}}$ slots and ending prior to the start of _drx-onDurationTimer_.
On PDCCH monitoring occasions associated with a same long DRX Cycle, a UE does
not expect to detect more than one DCI format 2_6 with different values of the
Wake-up indication bit for the UE or with different values of the bitmap for
the UE.
The UE does not monitor PDCCH for detecting DCI format 2_6 during Active Time
[11, TS 38.321].
If a UE reports for an active DL BWP a _MinTimeGap_ value that is X slots
prior to the beginning of a slot where the UE would start the _drx-
onDurationTimer_ , the UE is not required to monitor PDCCH for detection of
DCI format 2_6 during the X slots, where X corresponds to the _MinTimeGap_
value of the SCS of the active DL BWP in Table 10.3-1.
Table 10.3-1 Minimum time gap value X

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI
format 2_6 in the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell and the UE
detects DCI format 2_6, the physical layer of a UE reports the value of the
Wake-up indication bit for the UE to higher layers [11, TS 38.321] for the
next long DRX cycle.
If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI
format 2_6 in the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell and the UE does
not detect DCI format 2_6, the physical layer of the UE does not report a
value of the Wake-up indication bit to higher layers for the next long DRX
cycle.
If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI
format 2_6 in the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell and the UE
\- is not required to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2_6, as
described in clauses 10, 11.1, 12, and in clause 5.7 of [11, TS 38.321] for
all corresponding PDCCH monitoring occasions outside Active Time prior to a
next long DRX cycle, or
\- does not have any PDCCH monitoring occasions for detection of DCI format
2_6 outside Active Time of a next long DRX cycle
the physical layer of the UE reports a value of 1 for the Wake-up indication
bit to higher layers for the next long DRX cycle.
If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI
format 0_1 and DCI format 1_1 and if one or both of DCI format 0_1 and DCI
format 1_1 include a SCell dormancy indication field,
\- the SCell dormancy indication field is a bitmap with size equal to a number
of groups of configured SCells, provided by _dormancyGroupWithinActiveTime_ ,
\- each bit of the bitmap corresponds to a group of configured SCells from the
number of groups of configured Scells
\- if the UE detects a DCI format 0_1 or a DCI format 1_1 that does not
include a carrier indicator field, or detects a DCI format 0_1 or DCI format
1_1 that includes a carrier indicator field with value equal to 0, and if the
DCI format 0_1 does not indicate UL grant Type 2 release nor deactivate semi-
persistent CSI report(s) on PUSCH, or if the DCI format 1_1 does not indicate
SPS PDSCH release
\- a \'0\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates an active DL BWP, provided
by _dormantBWP-Id_ , for the UE for each activated SCell in the corresponding
group of configured SCells
\- a \'1\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates
\- an active DL BWP, provided by _firstWithinActiveTimeBWP-Id,_ for the UE for
each activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured SCells, if a
current active DL BWP is the dormant DL BWP
\- a current active DL BWP _,_ for the UE for each activated SCell in the
corresponding group of configured SCells, if the current active DL BWP is not
the dormant DL BWP
\- the UE sets the active DL BWP to the indicated active DL BWP
If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI
format 1_1, and if
\- the CRC of DCI format 1_1 is scrambled by a C-RNTI or a MCS-C-RNTI, and if
\- a one-shot HARQ-ACK request field is not present or has a \'0\' value, and
if
\- the UE detects a DCI format 1_1 on the primary cell that does not include a
carrier indicator field, or detects a DCI format 1_1 on the primary cell that
includes a carrier indicator field with value equal to 0, and if
\- _resourceAllocation_ = _resourceAllocationType0_ and all bits of the
frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI format 1_1 are equal to 0,
or
\- _resourceAllocation_ = _resourceAllocationType1_ and all bits of the
frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI format 1_1 are equal to 1,
or
\- _resourceAllocation = dynamicSwitch_ and all bits of the frequency domain
resource assignment field in DCI format 1_1 are equal to 0 or 1
the UE considers the DCI format 1_1 as indicating SCell dormancy, not
scheduling a PDSCH reception, and for transport block 1 interprets the
sequence of fields of
\- modulation and coding scheme
\- new data indicator
\- redundancy version
and of
\- HARQ process number
\- antenna port(s)
\- DMRS sequence initialization
as providing a bitmap to each configured SCell, in an ascending order of the
SCell index, where
\- a \'0\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates an active DL BWP, provided
by _dormantBWP-Id_ , for the UE for a corresponding activated SCell
\- a \'1\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates
\- an active DL BWP, provided by _firstWithinActiveTimeBWP-Id,_ for the UE for
a corresponding activated SCell, if a current active DL BWP is the dormant DL
BWP
\- a current active DL BWP _,_ for the UE for a corresponding activated SCell,
if the current active DL BWP is not the dormant DL BWP
\- the UE sets the active DL BWP to the indicated active DL BWP
If an active DL BWP provided by _dormantBWP-Id_ for a UE on an activated SCell
is not a default DL BWP for the UE on the activated SCell, as described in
clause 12, the BWP inactivity timer is not used for transitioning from the
active DL BWP provided by _dormantBWP-Id_ to the default DL BWP on the
activated SCell.
A UE is expected to provide HARQ-ACK information in response to a detection of
a DCI format 1_1 indicating SCell dormancy after $N$ symbols from the last
symbol of a PDCCH providing the DCI format 1_1. If _processingType2Enabled_ of
_PDSCH-ServingCellConfig_ is set to _enable_ for the serving cell with the
PDCCH providing the DCI format 1_1, $N = 7$ for $\mu = 0$, $N = 7.5$ for $\mu
= 1$, and $N = 15$ for $\mu = 2$; otherwise, $N = 14$ for $\mu = 0$, $N = 16$
for $\mu = 1$, $N = 27$ for $\mu = 2$, and $N = 31$ for $\mu = 3$, where $\mu$
is the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH
providing the DCI format 1_1 and the SCS configuration of a PUCCH with the
HARQ-ACK information in response to the detection of the DCI format 1_1.
## 10.4 Search space set group switching
A UE can be provided a group index for a respective Type3-PDCCH CSS set or USS
set by _searchSpaceGroupIdList_ for PDCCH monitoring on a serving cell. If the
UE is not provided _searchSpaceGroupIdList_ for a search space set, the
following procedures are not applicable for PDCCH monitoring according to the
search space set.
If a UE is provided _cellGroupsForSwitchList_ , indicating one or more groups
of serving cells, the following procedures apply to all serving cells within
each group; otherwise, the following procedures apply only to a serving cell
for which the UE is provided _searchSpaceGroupIdList_.
When a UE is provided _searchSpaceGroupIdList_ , the UE resets PDCCH
monitoring according to search space sets with group index 0, if provided by
_searchSpaceGroupIdList_.
A UE can be provided by _searchSpaceSwitchDelay_ a number of symbols
$P_{\text{switch}}$ where a minimum value of $P_{\text{switch}}$ is provided
in Table 10.4-1 for UE processing capability 1 and UE processing capability 2
and SCS configuration $\mu$. UE processing capability 1 for SCS configuration
$\mu$ applies unless the UE indicates support for UE processing capability 2.
Table 10.4-1: Minimum value of $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{\text{switch}}}$ [symbols]
+------------------+------------------------+------------------------+ | $$\mathbf{\mu}$$ | Minimum | Minimum | | | $\mathbf{P}_{\m | $\mathbf{P}_{\m | | | athbf{\text{switch}}}$ | athbf{\text{switch}}}$ | | | value for | value for | | | | | | | UE processing | UE processing | | | capability 1 | capability 2 | | | [symbols] | [symbols] | +------------------+------------------------+------------------------+ | 0 | 25 | 10 | +------------------+------------------------+------------------------+ | 1 | 25 | 12 | +------------------+------------------------+------------------------+ | 2 | 25 | 22 | +------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
A UE can be provided, by _searchSpaceSwitchTimer_ , a timer value for a
serving cell that the UE is provided _searchSpaceGroupIdList_ or, if provided,
for a set of serving cells provided by _cellGroupsForSwitchList_. The UE
decrements the timer value by one after each slot based on a reference SCS
configuration that is the smallest SCS configuration $\mu$ among all
configured DL BWPs in the serving cell, or in the set of serving cells. The UE
maintains the reference SCS configuration during the timer decrement
procedure.
If a UE is provided by _SearchSpaceSwitchTrigger a location of a search space
set group switching flag field for a serving cell in a DCI format 2_0_ , as
described in clause 11.1.1;
\- if the UE detects a DCI format 2_0 and a value of the search space set
group switching flag field in the DCI format 2_0 is 0, the UE starts
monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 0, and stops
monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 1, for the
serving cell at a first slot that is at least $P_{\text{switch}}$ symbols
after the last symbol of the PDCCH with the DCI format 2_0
\- if the UE detects a DCI format 2_0 and a value of the search space set
group switching flag field in the DCI format 2_0 is 1, the UE starts
monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 1, and stops
monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 0, for the
serving cell at a first slot that is at least $P_{\text{switch}}$ symbols
after the last symbol of the PDCCH with the DCI format 2_0, and the UE sets
the timer value to the value provided by _searchSpaceSwitchTimer_
\- if the UE monitors PDCCH for a serving cell according to search space sets
with group index 1, the UE starts monitoring PDCCH for the serving cell
according to search space sets with group index 0, and stops monitoring PDCCH
according to search space sets with group index 1, for the serving cell at the
beginning of the first slot that is at least $P_{\text{switch}}$ symbols after
a slot where the timer expires or after a last symbol of a remaining channel
occupancy duration for the serving cell if indicated by DCI format 2_0
If a UE is not provided _SearchSpaceSwitchTrigger for a serving cell_ ,
\- if the UE detects a DCI format by monitoring PDCCH according to a search
space set with group index 0, the UE starts monitoring PDCCH according to
search space sets with group index 1, and stops monitoring PDCCH according to
search space sets with group index 0, for the serving cell at a first slot
that is at least $P_{\text{switch}}$ symbols after the last symbol of the
PDCCH with the DCI format, the UE sets the timer value to the value provided
by _searchSpaceSwitchTimer_ if the UE detects a DCI format by monitoring PDCCH
in any search space set
\- if the UE monitors PDCCH for a serving cell according to search space sets
with group index 1, the UE starts monitoring PDCCH for the serving cell
according to search space sets with group index 0, and stops monitoring PDCCH
according to search space sets with group index 1, for the serving cell at the
beginning of the first slot that is at least $P_{\text{switch}}$ symbols after
a slot where the timer expires or, if the UE is provided a search space set to
monitor PDCCH for detecting a DCI format 2_0, after a last symbol of a
remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell if indicated by DCI
format 2_0
A UE determines a slot and a symbol in the slot to start or stop PDCCH
monitoring according to search space sets for a serving cell that the UE is
provided _searchSpaceGroupIdList_ or, if _cellGroupsForSwitchList_ is
provided, for a set of serving cells, based on the smallest SCS configuration
$\mu$ among all configured DL BWPs in the serving cell or in the set of
serving cells and, if any, in the serving cell where the UE receives a PDCCH
and detects a corresponding DCI format 2_0 triggering the start or stop of
PDCCH monitoring according to search space sets.
## 10.5 HARQ-ACK information for PUSCH transmissions
A UE can be configured a number of search space sets to monitor PDCCH for
detecting a DCI format 0_1 with a DFI flag field and CRC scrambled with a CS-
RNTI provided by _cs-RNTI_. The UE determines that the DCI format provides
HARQ-ACK information for PUSCH transmissions _based on when a DFI flag field
value is set to \'1\', if a_ PUSCH transmission is configured by
_ConfiguredGrantConfig._
_The HARQ-ACK information corresponds to transport blocks in PUSCH
transmissions for all HARQ processes for a serving cell of a PDCCH reception
that provides DCI format 0_1 or, if DCI format 0_1 includes a carrier
indicator field, for a serving cell indicated by a value of the carrier
indicator field._
_For a PUSCH transmission_ configured by _ConfiguredGrantConfig, HARQ-ACK
information for a transport block of a corresponding HARQ process number is
valid if a first symbol of the PDCCH reception is after a last symbol of the
PUSCH transmission, or of any repetition of the PUSCH transmission, by a
number of symbols provided by cg-minDFI-Delay._
For an initial transmission by a UE of a transport block in a PUSCH configured
by _ConfiguredGrantConfig, if the UE receives a CG-DFI that provides HARQ-ACK
information for the transport block, the UE assumes that the transport block
was correctly decoded if the HARQ-ACK information value is ACK; otherwise, the
UE assumes that the transport block was not correctly decoded._
_For a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format, if the UE receives a CG-
DFI that provides HARQ-ACK information for the transport block, the UE assumes
that the transport block was correctly decoded if the HARQ-ACK information
value is ACK; otherwise, the UE assumes that the transport block was not
correctly decoded._
_For a PUSCH transmission_ scheduled by a DCI format, _HARQ-ACK information
for a transport block of a corresponding HARQ process number is valid if a
first symbol of the PDCCH reception is after a last symbol of the PUSCH
transmission_ by a number of symbols provided by _cg-minDFI-Delay or, if the
PUSCH transmission is over multiple slots,_
\- after a last symbol of the PUSCH transmission in a first slot from the
multiple slots by a number of symbols provided by _cg-minDFI-Delay_ , if a
value of the HARQ-ACK information is ACK.
\- after a last symbol of the PUSCH transmission in a last slot from the
multiple slots by a number of symbols provided by _cg-minDFI-Delay_ , if a
value of the HARQ-ACK information is NACK.
UE does not expect to be configured with different _cg-minDFI-Delay-r16_ among
multiple _ConfiguredGrantConfig in one BWP_.
# 11 UE-group common signalling
If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures
described in this clause for both MCG and SCG
\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell, serving cells belonging to
the MCG respectively.
\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell), serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term \'primary cell\' in
this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.
## 11.1 Slot configuration
A slot format includes downlink symbols, uplink symbols, and flexible symbols.
The following are applicable for each serving cell.
If a UE is provided _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , the UE sets the slot
format per slot over a number of slots as indicated by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_.
The _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ provides
\- a reference SCS configuration by _referenceSubcarrierSpacing_
> \- a _pattern1_.
The _pattern1_ provides
\- a slot configuration period of msec by _dl-UL-TransmissionPeriodicity_
\- a number of slots with only downlink symbols by _nrofDownlinkSlots_
\- a number of downlink symbols by _nrofDownlinkSymbols_
\- a number of slots with only uplink symbols by _nrofUplinkSlots_
\- a number of uplink symbols by _nrofUplinkSymbols_
A value msec is valid only for . A value msec is valid only for or . A value
msec is valid only for , or , or .
A slot configuration period of msec includes slots with SCS configuration .
From the slots, a first slots include only downlink symbols and a last slots
include only uplink symbols. The symbols after the first slots are downlink
symbols. The symbols before the last slots are uplink symbols. The remaining
are flexible symbols.
The first symbol every periods is a first symbol in an even frame.
If _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ provides both _pattern1_ and _pattern2_ ,
the UE sets the slot format per slot over a first number of slots as indicated
by _pattern1_ and the UE sets the slot format per slot over a second number of
slots as indicated by _pattern2_.
The _pattern2_ provides
\- a slot configuration period of msec by _dl-UL-TransmissionPeriodicity_
\- a number of slots with only downlink symbols by _nrofDownlinkSlots_
\- a number of downlink symbols by _nrofDownlinkSymbols_
\- a number of slots with only uplink symbols by _nrofUplinkSlots_
\- a number of uplink symbols by _nrofUplinkSymbols_
The applicable values of are same as the applicable values for .
A slot configuration period of msec includes first slots and second slots.
From the slots, a first slots include only downlink symbols and a last include
only uplink symbols. The symbols after the first slots are downlink symbols.
The symbols before the last slots are uplink symbols. The remaining are
flexible symbols.
A UE expects that divides 20 msec.
The first symbol every periods is a first symbol in an even frame.
A UE expects that the reference SCS configuration is smaller than or equal to
a SCS configuration for any configured DL BWP or UL BWP. Each slot provided by
_pattern1_ or _pattern2_ is applicable to consecutive slots in the active DL
BWP or the active UL BWP where the first slot starts at a same time as a first
slot for the reference SCS configuration and each downlink or flexible or
uplink symbol for the reference SCS configuration corresponds to consecutive
downlink or flexible or uplink symbols for the SCS configuration .
If the UE is additionally provided _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , the
parameter _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ overrides only flexible symbols
per slot over the number of slots as provided by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_.
The _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ provides
\- a set of slot configurations by _slotSpecificConfigurationsToAddModList_
\- for each slot configuration from the set of slot configurations
\- a slot index for a slot provided by _slotIndex_
\- a set of symbols for a slot by _symbols_ where
\- if _symbols_ = _allDownlink_ , all symbols in the slot are downlink
\- if _symbols_ = _allUplink_ , all symbols in the slot are uplink
\- if _symbols_ = _explicit_ , _nrofDownlinkSymbols_ provides a number of
downlink first symbols in the slot and _nrofUplinkSymbols_ provides a number
of uplink last symbols in the slot. If _nrofDownlinkSymbols_ is not provided,
there are no downlink first symbols in the slot and if _nrofUplinkSymbols_ is
not provided, there are no uplink last symbols in the slot. The remaining
symbols in the slot are flexible
For each slot having a corresponding index provided by _slotIndex_ , the UE
applies a format provided by a corresponding _symbols_. The UE does not expect
_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ to indicate as uplink or as downlink a
symbol that _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ indicates as a downlink or as an
uplink symbol, respectively.
For each slot configuration provided by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , a
reference SCS configuration is the reference SCS configuration
{width="0.25277777777777777in" height="0.21944444444444444in"} provided by
_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_.
A slot configuration period and a number of downlink symbols, uplink symbols,
and flexible symbols in each slot of the slot configuration period are
determined from _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ and _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationDedicated_ and are common to each configured BWP.
A UE considers symbols in a slot indicated as downlink by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ to be available
for receptions and considers symbols in a slot indicated as uplink by _tdd-UL-
DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or by _tdd_ -_UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ to be
available for transmissions.
If a UE is not configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2_0, for a set of
symbols of a slot that are indicated as flexible by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ and _tdd_ -_UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ if provided, or
when _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ and _tdd_ -_UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_
are not provided to the UE
\- the UE receives PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE
receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format
\- the UE transmits PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the
slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format, a RAR UL
grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR
For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, if a UE is configured
by higher layers to receive a PDCCH, or a PDSCH, or a CSI-RS, or a DL PRS in a
set of symbols of a slot, the UE receives the PDCCH, the PDSCH, the CSI-RS, or
the DL PRS if the UE does not detect a DCI format that indicates to the UE to
transmit a PUSCH, a PUCCH, a PRACH, or a SRS in at least one symbol of the set
of symbols of the slot; otherwise, the UE does not receive the PDCCH, or the
PDSCH, or the CSI-RS, or the DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if a UE is provided _csi-
RS-ValidationWith-DCI_ , is not provided _CO-DurationsPerCell_ , and is not
provided _SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell_ , and if the UE is configured by
higher layers to receive a CSI-RS in a set of symbols of a slot, the UE
cancels the CSI-RS reception in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE does
not detect a DCI format indicating an aperiodic CSI-RS reception or scheduling
a PDSCH reception in the set of symbols of the slot.
If a UE is provided _channelAccessMode =\'dynamic\' and is provided
availableRB-SetsToAddModList_ and _availableRB-SetsToReleaseList_ , _the UE
expects to be provided co-DurationsPerCellToAddModList_ and _co-
DurationsPerCellToReleaseList_ and/or _slotFormatCombToAddModList_ and
_slotFormatCombToReleaseList._
For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, if a UE is configured
by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH, or PRACH in a set of
symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to
receive CSI-RS or PDSCH in a subset of symbols from the set of symbols, then
\- If the UE does not indicate the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE
does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH in
the set of symbols if the first symbol in the set occurs within $T_{proc,2\ }$
relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format;
otherwise, the UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of
the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], determined from clauses 9, 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or clause
6.1 of [6, TS 38.214], or the PRACH transmission in the set of symbols.
\- If the UE indicates the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE does
not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH in
symbols from the set of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a
last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels
the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214],
determined from clauses 9, 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214], or
the PRACH transmission in remaining symbols from the set of symbols.
\- The UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols from
the subset of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a last symbol
of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels the SRS
transmission in remaining symbols from the subset of symbols.
$T_{proc,2}$ is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE processing
capability [6, TS 38.214] assuming $d_{2,1} = 1$ and $\mu$ corresponds to the
smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH carrying
the DCI format and the SCS configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH or
$\mu_{r}$, where $\mu_{r}$ corresponds to the SCS configuration of the PRACH
if it is 15kHz or higher; otherwise $\mu_{r} = 0$.
For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as uplink by _tdd-
UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , the UE
does not receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS when the PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS
overlaps, even partially, with the set of symbols of the slot.
For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as uplink by _tdd-
UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , the UE
does not receive DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot, if the UE is not
provided with a measurement gap.
For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as downlink by _tdd-
UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , the UE
does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS when the PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or
SRS overlaps, even partially, with the set of symbols of the slot.
For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as flexible by _tdd-
UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , and _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ if
provided, the UE does not expect to receive both dedicated higher layer
parameters configuring transmission from the UE in the set of symbols of the
slot and dedicated higher layer parameters configuring reception by the UE in
the set of symbols of the slot.
For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, for a set of symbols
of a slot indicated to a UE by _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ or _ssb-
PositionsInBurst_ in _ServingCellConfigCommon_ , for reception of SS/PBCH
blocks, the UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH in the slot if a
transmission would overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols and the UE
does not transmit SRS in the set of symbols of the slot. The UE does not
expect the set of symbols of the slot to be indicated as uplink by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ , when provided
to the UE.
If a UE
\- is configured with multiple serving cells and is provided with
_directionalCollisionHandling-r16_ = \'enabled\' for a set of serving cell(s)
among the multiple serving cells, and
\- indicates support of _half-DuplexTDD-CA-SameSCS-r16_ capability, and
\- is not configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2_0 on any
of the multiple serving cells,
for a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to the UE for reception of
SS/PBCH blocks in a first cell of the multiple serving cells by _ssb-
PositionsInBurst_ in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ or by _ssb-
PositionsInBurst_ in _ServingCellConfigCommon_ , when provided to the UE, the
UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, or PRACH in the slot if a transmission
would overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols, and the UE does not
transmit SRS in the set of symbols of the slot in
\- any of the multiple serving cells if the UE is not capable of simultaneous
transmission and reception as indicated by _simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA_ among
the multiple serving cells, and
\- any one of the cells corresponding to the same band as the first cell,
irrespective of any capability indicated by _simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA_.
For a set of symbols of a slot corresponding to a valid PRACH occasion and
symbols before the valid PRACH occasion, as described in clause 8.1, the UE
does not receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS in the slot if a reception would
overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols. The UE does not expect the
set of symbols of the slot to be indicated as downlink by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_.
For a set of symbols of a slot indicated to a UE by _pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ in
_MIB_ for a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not expect the set of
symbols to be indicated as uplink by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or
_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_.
If a UE is scheduled by a DCI format to receive PDSCH over multiple slots, and
if _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ ,
indicate that, for a slot from the multiple slots, at least one symbol from a
set of symbols where the UE is scheduled PDSCH reception in the slot is an
uplink symbol, the UE does not receive the PDSCH in the slot.
If a UE is scheduled by a DCI format to transmit PUSCH over multiple slots,
and if _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_
, indicates that, for a slot from the multiple slots, at least one symbol from
a set of symbols where the UE is scheduled PUSCH transmission in the slot is a
downlink symbol, the UE does not transmit the PUSCH in the slot.
If a UE
\- is configured with multiple serving cells and is provided with
_directionalCollisionHandling-r16_ = \'enabled\' for a set of serving cell(s)
among the configured multiple serving cells, and
\- indicates support of _half-DuplexTDD-CA-SameSCS-r16_ capability, and
\- is not configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2_0 on any
of the multiple serving cells,
the UE determines a reference cell for a symbol as an active cell with the
smallest cell index among
\- the configured multiple serving cells if the UE is not capable of
simultaneous transmission and reception as indicated by
_simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA_ among the multiple serving cells, and
\- the cells of each band respectively if the UE is capable of simultaneous
transmission and reception by _simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA_ for the configured
multiple serving cells,
where the symbol is configured as
\- downlink, or uplink, as indicated by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ or
_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_
\- uplink, if the symbol is flexible and the UE is **configured to transmit**
SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH on the symbol
\- downlink, if the symbol is flexible and the UE is configured to receive
PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS on the symbol.
And if another cell among the cells configured with
**_directionalCollisionHandling-r16_** operates in the same frequency band as
the reference cell, the UE does not expect
\- a symbol to be indicated as downlink or uplink on the reference cell and as
uplink or downlink on another cell, respectively, by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ or by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ ,
\- _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ to
indicate a symbol as downlink on the reference cell and to detect a DCI format
scheduling a transmission on the symbol on another cell, and
\- to be configured by **higher layers to receive** PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS on
a flexible symbol on the reference cell and to detect a DCI format scheduling
a transmission on the symbol on another cell,
if the reference cell and another cell among the cells configured with
**_directionalCollisionHandling-r16_** operate in different frequency bands,
the UE
\- assumes symbol as flexible, is not required to receive higher layer
configured PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS and not expected to transmit higher layer
configured SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH, when _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_
or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ indicates symbol as downlink or uplink
on another cell and as uplink or downlink for the reference cell,
respectively,
\- transmits a signal/channel scheduled by a DCI format on a symbol of another
cell when the symbol is indicated as downlink by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ for the reference
cell,
\- is not required to receive a higher layer configured PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-
RS on flexible symbols on the reference cell in a set of symbols, if the UE
detects a DCI format scheduling a transmission on one or more symbols in the
set of symbols on another cell,
and regardless of whether the reference cell and another cell operate in same
or different frequency bands,
the UE
\- does not expect _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ or _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationDedicated_ for the reference cell to indicate a symbol as uplink
and to detect a DCI format scheduling a reception on the symbol on another
cell
\- does not expect to be configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, PUCCH,
PUSCH, or PRACH on a flexible symbol on the reference cell and to detect a DCI
format scheduling a reception on the symbol on another cell
\- does not transmit a PUCCH, PUSCH or PRACH that is configured by higher
layers on a set of symbols on another cell if at least one symbol from the set
of symbols is indicated as downlink by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ or
_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ or is a symbol corresponding to a PDCCH,
PDSCH, or CSI-RS reception that is configured by higher layers on the
reference cell
\- does not transmit a SRS that is configured by higher layers on a set of
symbols on another cell if the set of symbols is indicated as downlink by
_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ or
corresponds to a PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS reception that is configured by higher
layers on the reference cell
\- does not receive a PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS that is configured by higher
layers on a set of symbols on another cell if at least one symbol from the set
of symbols is indicated as uplink by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ or _tdd-
UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ or is a symbol corresponding to a SRS, PUCCH,
PUSCH, or PRACH transmission that is configured by higher layers on the
reference cell
\- assumes a symbol indicated as downlink or uplink by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ on another cell to
be flexible, if the UE is respectively configured by higher layers to transmit
SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH or to receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS on the
reference cell
\- does not expect to detect a first DCI format scheduling a transmission or
reception on a symbol on a first cell and a second DCI format scheduling a
reception or transmission on the symbol on a second cell, respectively.
After the UE applies the procedures described above for directional collision
handling within the set of cells that have been configured with
_directionalCollisionHandling-r16_ , the UE does not expect any directional
collision among the serving cells that the UE is not capable of simultaneous
transmission and reception.
### 11.1.1 UE procedure for determining slot format
This clause applies for a serving cell that is included in a set of serving
cells configured to a UE by _slotFormatCombToAddModList_ and
_slotFormatCombToReleaseList_ , _availableRB-SetsToAddModList_ and
_availableRB-SetsToReleaseList_ , _switchTriggerToAddModList_ and
_switchTriggerToReleaseList_ , or _co-DurationsPerCellToAddModList_ and _co-
DurationsPerCellToReleaseList_.
If a UE is configured by higher layers with parameter _SlotFormatIndicator_ ,
the UE is provided an SFI-RNTI by _sfi-RNTI_ and with a payload size of DCI
format 2_0 by _dci-PayloadSize_.
The UE is also provided in one or more serving cells with a configuration for
a search space set {width="0.13541666666666666in"
height="0.13541666666666666in"} and a corresponding CORESET $p$ for monitoring
$M_{p,s}^{\left( L_{\text{SFI}} \right)}$ PDCCH candidates for DCI format 2_0
with a CCE aggregation level of $L_{\text{SFI}}$ CCEs as described in clause
10.1. The $M_{p,s}^{\left( L_{\text{SFI}} \right)}$ PDCCH candidates are the
first $M_{p,s}^{\left( L_{\text{SFI}} \right)}$ PDCCH candidates _for CCE
aggregation level_ $L_{\text{SFI}}$ for search space set $s$ in CORESET $p$.
For each serving cell in the set of serving cells, the UE can be provided:
\- an identity of the serving cell by _servingCellId_
\- a location of a SFI-index field in DCI format 2_0 by _positionInDCI_
\- a set of slot format combinations by _slotFormatCombinations_ , where each
slot format combination in the set of slot format combinations includes
\- one or more slot formats indicated by a respective _slotFormats_ for the
slot format combination, and
\- a mapping for the slot format combination provided by _slotFormats_ to a
corresponding SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0 provided by
_slotFormatCombinationId_
\- for unpaired spectrum operation, a reference SCS configuration

_availableRB-SetsPerCell_ , where the field is
\- one bit, if _intraCellGuardBandsDL-List_ for the serving cell indicates no
intra-cell guard-bands are configured, where a value of \'1\' indicates that
the serving cell is available for receptions, a value of \'0\' indicates that
the serving cell is not available for receptions, and the serving cell remains
available or unavailable for reception until the end of the remaining channel
occupancy duration; or,
\- a bitmap having a one-to-one mapping with the RB sets [6, TS 38.214] of the
serving cell, if _intraCellGuardBandsDL-List_ for the serving cell indicates
intra-cell guard-bands are configured or if _intraCellGuardBandsDL-List_ is
not provided for the serving cell, where the bitmap includes $N_{RB,set,DL}$
bits and $N_{RB,set,DL}$ is the number of RB sets in the serving cell, a value
of \'1\' indicates that an RB set is available for receptions, a value of
\'0\' indicates that an RB set is not available for receptions, _and a RB set
remains available or unavailable for receptions until the end of the_
remaining _channel occupancy duration_
\- a location of a channel occupancy duration field in DCI format 2_0, by _CO-
DurationsPerCell_ , where the field indicates a remaining channel occupancy
duration for the serving cell starting from a first symbol of a slot where the
UE detects the DCI format 2_0 by providing a value from _co-DurationList_. The
channel occupancy duration field includes $\max\left{ \left\lceil
\log_{2}\left( \text{COdurationListSize} \right) \right\rceil,1 \right}$ bits,
where $\text{COdurationListSize}$ is the number of values provided by _co-
DurationList_. If _CO-DurationsPerCell_ is not provided, the remaining channel
occupancy duration for the serving cell is a number of slots, starting from
the slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2_0, that the SFI-index field
value provides corresponding slot formats
\- a reference SCS configuration for _co-DurationList_ , by
_subcarrierSpacing-r16_
\- a location of a search space set group switching flag field in DCI format
2_0, by _SearchSpaceSwitchTrigger_ , where the field indicates a group from
two groups of search space sets for PDCCH monitoring for scheduling for the
serving cell or the set of serving cells, provided by _CellGroupsForSwitching_
, as described in clause 10.4.
If neither _CO-DurationPerCell-r16_ nor  _SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell_ are
provided and if _channelAccessMode_ = _\"semiStatic\"_ is provided, the
procedures in this clause apply with assuming a channel occupancy time defined
in clause 4.3 of [15, TS 37.213] is the remaining channel occupancy duration
if a DL transmission burst(s) is detected within the channel occupancy time.
A SFI-index field value in a DCI format 2_0 indicates to a UE a slot format
for each slot in a number of slots for each DL BWP or each UL BWP starting
from a slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2_0. The number of slots is
equal to or larger than a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_0. The
SFI-index field includes bits where maxSFIindex is the maximum value of the
values provided by corresponding _slotFormatCombinationId_. A slot format is
identified by a corresponding format index as provided in Table 11.1.1-1 where
\'D\' denotes a downlink symbol, \'U\' denotes an uplink symbol, and \'F\'
denotes a flexible symbol.
If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_0, provided to a UE for the
search space set by _monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset_ , is smaller than a
duration of a slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring
occasion for DCI format 2_0 by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the
UE detects more than one DCI formats 2_0 indicating a slot format for a slot,
the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2_0 to indicate a same
format for the slot.
A UE does not expect to be configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2_0 on a
second serving cell that uses larger SCS than the serving cell.

255 UE determines the slot format for the slot based on _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ , or _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ and, if any, on
detected DCI formats
For unpaired spectrum operation for a UE on a serving cell, the UE is provided
by _subcarrierSpacing_ a reference SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{SFI}}$ for
each slot format in a combination of slot formats indicated by an SFI-index
field value in DCI format 2_0. The UE expects that for a reference SCS
configuration $\mu_{\text{SFI}}$ and for an active DL BWP or an active UL BWP
with SCS configuration $\mu$, it is $\mu \geq \mu_{\text{SFI}}$. Each slot
format in the combination of slot formats indicated by the SFI-index field
value in DCI format 2_0 is applicable to $2^{\left( \mu - \mu_{\text{SFI}}
\right)}$ consecutive slots in the active DL BWP or the active UL BWP where
the first slot starts at a same time as a first slot for the reference SCS
configuration $\mu_{\text{SFI}}$ and each downlink or flexible or uplink
symbol for the reference SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{SFI}}$ corresponds to
{width="0.5in" height="0.19791666666666666in"} consecutive downlink or
flexible or uplink symbols for the SCS configuration $\mu$.
For paired spectrum operation for a UE on a serving cell, the SFI-index field
in DCI format 2_0 indicates a combination of slot formats that includes a
combination of slot formats for a reference DL BWP and a combination of slot
formats for a reference UL BWP of the serving cell. The UE is provided by
_subcarrierSpacing_ a reference SCS configuration $\mu_{SFI,DL}$ for the
combination of slot formats indicated by the SFI-index field value in DCI
format 2_0 for the reference DL BWP of the serving cell. The UE is provided by
_subcarrierSpacing2_ a reference SCS configuration $\mu_{SFI,UL}$ for the
combination of slot formats indicated by the SFI-index field value in DCI
format 2_0 for the reference UL BWP of the serving cell. If $\mu_{SFI,DL} \geq
\mu_{SFI,UL}$ and for each $2^{\left( \mu_{SFI,DL} - \mu_{SFI,UL} \right)} +
1$ values provided by a value of _slotFormats_ , where the value of
_slotFormats_ is determined by a value of _slotFormatCombinationId_ in
_slotFormatCombination_ and the value of _slotFormatCombinationId_ is set by
the value of the SFI-index field value in DCI format 2_0, the first $2^{\left(
\mu_{SFI,DL} - \mu_{SFI,UL} \right)}$ values for the combination of slot
formats are applicable to the reference DL BWP and the next value is
applicable to the reference UL BWP. If $\mu_{SFI,DL}  \- If the UE does not indicate the capability of [partialCancellation], the
> UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH
> in the set of symbols if the first symbol in the set occurs within
> $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the

> repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], determined from clauses 9, 9.2.5 and
> 9.2.6 or clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214], or the PRACH transmission in the set
> of symbols.
\- If the UE indicates the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE does
not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH in
symbols from the set of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a
last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels
the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214],
determined from clauses 9, 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214], or
the PRACH transmission in remaining symbols from the set of symbols.
\- The UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols from
the subset of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a last symbol
of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels the SRS
transmission in remaining symbols from the subset of symbols.
$T_{proc,2}$ is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE processing
capability [6, TS 38.214] assuming $d_{2,1} = 1$ and $\mu$ corresponds to the
smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH carrying
the DCI format and the SCS configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH or
$\mu_{r}$, where $\mu_{r}$ corresponds to the SCS configuration of the PRACH
if it is 15kHz or higher; otherwise $\mu_{r} = 0$.
If a UE is configured by higher layers to receive a CSI-RS or detects a DCI
format 0_1 indicating to the UE to receive a CSI-RS in one or more RB sets and
a set of symbols of a slot, and the UE detects a DCI format 2_0 with bitmap
indicating that any RB set from the one or more RB sets is not available for
reception, the UE cancels the CSI-RS reception in the set of symbols of the
slot.
A UE assumes that flexible symbols in a CORESET configured to the UE for PDCCH
monitoring are downlink symbols if the UE does not detect an SFI-index field
value in DCI format 2_0 indicating the set of symbols of the slot as flexible
or uplink and the UE does not detect a DCI format indicating to the UE to
transmit SRS, PUSCH, PUCCH, or PRACH in the set of symbols.
For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated as flexible by _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_ , and _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ if provided, or
when _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , and _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_
are not provided to the UE, and if the UE does not detect a DCI format 2_0
providing a slot format for the slot
\- the UE receives PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE
receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format
\- the UE transmits PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the
slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format, a RAR UL
grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR
\- the UE receives PDCCH as described in clause 10.1
\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive PDSCH in the set of
symbols of the slot, the UE does not receive the PDSCH in the set of symbols
of the slot
\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive CSI-RS in the set of
symbols of the slot, the UE does not receive the CSI-RS in the set of symbols
of the slot, except when UE is provided _CO-DurationsPerCell_ and the set of
symbols of the slot are within the remaining channel occupancy duration.
\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive DL PRS in the set of
symbols of the slot, the UE receives the DL PRS
\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or
PUSCH, or PRACH in the set of symbols of the slot and the UE is not provided
_enableConfiguredUL_ , then
\- if the UE does not indicate the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE
does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an
actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], as determined in clauses 9,
9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or in clause 6.1 of [6. TS 38.214], or the PRACH in the slot
if the first symbol of the PUCCH or the PUSCH or actual repetition of the
PUSCH or the PRACH in the slot occurs within $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a last
symbol of a CORESET where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format
2_0; otherwise, the UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual
repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], as determined in clauses 9, 9.2.5 and
9.2.6 or in clause 6.1 of [6. TS 38.214], or the PRACH in the slot;
\- if the UE indicates the capability of [partialCancellation], the UE does
not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual
repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], as determined in clauses 9, 9.2.5 and
9.2.6 or in clause 6.1 of [6. TS 38.214], or the PRACH in symbols from the set
of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a last symbol of a
CORESET where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2_0. The UE
cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS
38.214], as determined in clauses 9, 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or in clause 6.1 of [6.
TS 38.214], or the PRACH transmission in remaining symbols from the set of
symbols;
\- the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols from
the set of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}\ $relative to a last symbol
of a CORESET where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2_0.
The UE cancels the SRS transmission in remaining symbols from the set of
symbols;
\- $T_{proc,2}$ is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE
processing capability [6, TS 38.214] assuming $d_{2,1} = 1$ and $\mu$
corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of
the PDCCH carrying the DCI format 2_0 and the SCS configuration of the SRS,
PUCCH, PUSCH or $\mu_{r}$, where $\mu_{r}$ corresponds to the SCS
configuration of the PRACH if it is 15kHz or higher; otherwise $\mu_{r} = 0$;
\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or
PUSCH, or PRACH in the set of symbols of the slot and the UE is provided
_enableConfiguredUL_ , the UE can transmit the SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH, or
PRACH, respectively.
For unpaired spectrum operation for a UE on a cell in a frequency band of FR1,
and when the scheduling restrictions due to RRM measurements [10, TS 38.133]
are not applicable, if the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to
transmit in a set of symbols, the UE is not required to perform RRM
measurements [10, TS 38.133] based on a SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS reception on a
different cell in the frequency band if the SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS reception
includes at least one symbol from the set of symbols.
## 11.2 Interrupted transmission indication
If a UE is provided _DownlinkPreemption_ , the UE is configured with an INT-
RNTI provided by _int-RNTI_ for monitoring PDCCH conveying DCI format 2_1 [5,
TS 38.212]. The UE is additionally configured with
\- a set of serving cells by _int-ConfigurationPerServingCell_ that includes a
set of serving cell indexes provided by corresponding _servingCellId_ and a
corresponding set of locations for fields in DCI format 2_1 by _positionInDCI_
\- an information payload size for DCI format 2_1 by _dci-PayloadSize_
\- an indication granularity for time-frequency resources by
_timeFrequencySet_
If a UE detects a DCI format 2_1 for a serving cell from the configured set of
serving cells, the UE may assume that no transmission to the UE is present in
PRBs and in symbols that are indicated by the DCI format 2_1, from a set of
PRBs and a set of symbols of the last monitoring period. The indication by the
DCI format 2_1 is not applicable to receptions of SS/PBCH blocks.
The set of PRBs is equal to the active DL BWP as defined in clause 12 and
includes PRBs.
If a UE detects a DCI format 2_1 in a PDCCH transmitted in a CORESET in a
slot, the set of symbols is the last symbols prior to the first symbol of the
CORESET in the slot where is the PDCCH monitoring periodicity provided by the
value of _monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset,_ as described in clause 10.1, is
the number of symbols per slot, is the SCS configuration for a serving cell
with mapping to a respective field in the DCI format 2_1, is the SCS
configuration of the DL BWP where the UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI
format 2_1. If the UE is provided _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ , symbols
indicated as uplink by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ are excluded from the
last symbols prior to the first symbol of the CORESET in the slot. The
resulting set of symbols includes a number of symbols that is denoted as .
The UE does not expect to be provided values of , , and resulting to a value
of that is not an integer. The UE does not expect to be configured by
_monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot_ with more than one PDCCH monitoring occasion for
DCI format 2_1 in a slot.
A UE is provided the indication granularity for the set of PRBs and for the
set of symbols by _timeFrequencySet_.
If the value of _timeFrequencySet_ is \'set0\', 14 bits from MSB of a field in
DCI format 2_1 have a one-to-one mapping with 14 groups of consecutive symbols
from the set of symbols where each of the first symbol groups includes
symbols, each of the last symbol groups includes symbols, a bit value of 0
indicates transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol group and a bit
value of 1 indicates no transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol
group.
If the value of _timeFrequencySet_ is \'set1\', 7 pairs of bits from MSB of a
field in the DCI format 2_1 have a one-to-one mapping with 7 groups of
consecutive symbols where each of the first symbol groups includes symbols,
each of the last symbol groups includes symbols, a first bit in a pair of bits
for a symbol group is applicable to the subset of first PRBs from the set of
PRBs, a second bit in the pair of bits for the symbol group is applicable to
the subset of last PRBs from the set of PRBs, a bit value of 0 indicates
transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol group and subset of PRBs,
and a bit value of 1 indicates no transmission to the UE in the corresponding
symbol group and subset of PRBs.
## 11.2A Cancellation indication
If a UE is provided _UplinkCancellation_ , the UE is provided, in one or more
serving cells, a search space set for monitoring the first PDCCH candidate
with a CCE aggregation level of $L_{\text{CI}}$ CCEs of the search space set
for detection of a DCI format 2_4 [5, TS 38.212] with a CI-RNTI provided by
_ci-RNTI_ as described in clause 10.1. _UplinkCancellation_ additionally
provides to the UE
\- a set of serving cells, by _ci-ConfigurationPerServingCell,_ that includes
a set of serving cell indexes and a corresponding set of locations for fields
in DCI format 2_4 by _positionInDCI_
\- a number of fields in DCI format 2_4, by _positionInDCI-forSUL_ , for each
serving cell for a SUL carrier, if the serving cell is configured with a SUL
carrier
\- an information payload size for DCI format 2_4 by _dci-PayloadSize-ForCI_
\- an indication for time-frequency resources by _timeFrequencyRegion_
For a serving cell having an associated field in a DCI format 2_4, for the
field denote by
\- $N_{\text{CI}}$ a number of bits provided by _ci-PayloadSize_
\- $B_{\text{CI}}$ a number of PRBs provided by _frequencyRegionforCI_ in
_timeFrequencyRegion_
\- $T_{\text{CI}}$ a number of symbols, excluding symbols for reception of
SS/PBCH blocks and DL symbols indicated by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ ,
from a number of symbols that
\- is provided by _timeDurationforCI_ in _timeFrequencyRegion,_ if the PDCCH
monitoring periodicity for the search space set with the DCI format 2_4 is one
slot and there are more than one PDCCH monitoring occasions in a slot, or
\- is equal to the PDCCH monitoring periodicity, otherwise.
\- $G_{\text{CI}}$ a number of partitions for the $T_{\text{CI}}$ symbols
provided by _timeGranularityforCI_ in _timeFrequencyRegion_
$G_{\text{CI}}$ sets of bits from the MSB of the $N_{\text{CI}}$ bits have a
one-to-one mapping with $G_{\text{CI}}$ groups of symbols where each of the
first $G_{\text{CI}} - T_{\text{CI}} + \left\lfloor
\frac{T_{\text{CI}}}{G_{\text{CI}}} \right\rfloor \cdot G_{\text{CI}}$ groups
includes $\left\lfloor \frac{T_{\text{CI}}}{G_{\text{CI}}} \right\rfloor$
symbols and each of the remaining $T_{\text{CI}} - \left\lfloor
\frac{T_{\text{CI}}}{G_{\text{CI}}} \right\rfloor \cdot G_{\text{CI}}$ groups
includes $\left\lceil \frac{T_{\text{CI}}}{G_{\text{CI}}} \right\rceil$
symbols. A UE determines a symbol duration with respect to a SCS configuration
of an active DL BWP where the UE monitors PDCCH for DCI format 2_4 detection.
For a group of symbols, $N_{\text{BI}} = \frac{N_{\text{CI}}}{G_{\text{CI}}}$
bits from MSB of each set of bits have a one-to-one mapping with
$N_{\text{BI}}$ groups of PRBs where each of the first $N_{\text{BI}} -
B_{\text{CI}} + \left\lfloor \frac{B_{\text{CI}}}{N_{\text{BI}}} \right\rfloor
\cdot N_{\text{BI}}$ groups includes $\left\lfloor
\frac{B_{\text{CI}}}{N_{\text{BI}}} \right\rfloor$ PRBs and each of the
remaining $B_{\text{CI}} - \left\lfloor \frac{B_{\text{CI}}}{N_{\text{BI}}}
\right\rfloor \cdot N_{\text{BI}}$ groups includes $\left\lceil
\frac{B_{\text{CI}}}{N_{\text{BI}}} \right\rceil$ PRBs. A UE determines a
first PRB index as ${N_{\text{RFR}}^{\text{start}} = O}_{\text{carrier}} +
\text{RB}_{\text{start}}$ and a number of contiguous RBs as ${B_{\text{CI}} =
L}_{\text{RB}}\ $ from _frequencyRegionforCI_ that indicates an offset
$\text{RB}_{\text{start}}$ and a length $L_{\text{RB}}$ as RIV according to
[6, TS 38.214], and from _offsetToCarrier_ in _FrequencyInfoUL-SIB_ or
_FrequencyInfoUL_ that indicates $O_{\text{carrier}}$ for a SCS configuration
of an active DL BWP where the UE monitors PDCCH for DCI format 2_4 detection.
An indication by a DCI format 2_4 for a serving cell is applicable to a PUSCH
transmission or an SRS transmission on the serving cell. If the PUSCH
transmission or the SRS transmission is scheduled by a DCI format, the
indication by the DCI format 2_4 is applicable to the PUSCH transmission or
SRS transmission only if the last symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the
DCI format is earlier than the first symbol of the PDCCH reception providing
the DCI format 2_4. For the serving cell, the UE determines the first symbol
of the $T_{\text{CI}}$ symbols to be the first symbol that is after
${T'}_{proc,2}$ from the end of a PDCCH reception where the UE detects the DCI
format 2_4, where ${T'}_{proc,2}$ is obtained from $T_{proc,2}$ for PUSCH
processing capability 2 [6, TS 38.214] assuming $d_{2,1} = d_{\text{offset}}
\cdot \frac{2^{- \mu_{\text{UL}}}}{2^{- \mu}}$ where $d_{\text{offset}}$ is
provided by _delta_Offset_ , $\mu$ being the smallest SCS configuration
between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH and the smallest _SCS
configuration_ $\mu_{\text{UL}}$ _provided in scs-SpecificCarrierList of
FrequencyInfoUL or FrequencyInfoUL-SIB_. The UE does not expect to cancel the
PUSCH transmission or the SRS transmission before a corresponding symbol that
is $T_{proc,2}$ assuming that $d_{2,1} = 0$ after a last symbol of a CORESET
where the UE detects the DCI format 2_4.
A UE that detects a DCI format 2_4 for a serving cell cancels a PUSCH
transmission or an actual repetition of a PUSCH transmission [6, TS 38.214] if
the PUSCH transmission is with repetition Type B, as determined in clauses 9
and 9.2.5 or in clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214], or an SRS transmission on the
serving cell if, respectively,
\- the transmission is PUSCH with priority 0, if the UE is provided
_uplinkCancellationPriority_ ,
\- a group of symbols, from the $T_{\text{CI}}$ symbols, has at least one bit
value of \'1\' in the corresponding set of $N_{\text{BI}}$ bits in the DCI
format 2_4 and includes a symbol of the (repetition of the) PUSCH transmission
or of the SRS transmission, and
\- a group of PRBs, from the $B_{\text{CI}}$ PRBs, has a corresponding bit
value of \'1\' in the set of bits corresponding to the group of symbols in the
DCI format 2_4 and includes a PRB of the (repetition of the) PUSCH
transmission or of the SRS transmission,
where
\- the cancellation of the (repetition of the) PUSCH transmission includes all
symbols from the earliest symbol of the (repetition of the) PUSCH transmission
that is in a group of symbols having corresponding bit values of \'1\' in the
DCI format 2_4;
\- the cancellation of the SRS transmission includes only symbols that are in
one or more groups of symbols having corresponding bit values of \'1\' in the
DCI format 2_4.
If, based on an indication by a DCI format 2_4, a UE cancels a PUSCH
transmission or an SRS transmission, the UE does not expect to be scheduled by
a second DCI format to transmit a PUSCH or an SRS over symbols that include
symbols of the cancelled PUSCH transmission or SRS transmission, where the
last symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the second DCI format is no
earlier than the first symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the DCI format
2_4.

The UE is also provided for the serving cell of the PDCCH reception for DCI
format 2_2 with a configuration for a search space set and a corresponding
CORESET for monitoring PDCCH candidates for DCI format 2_2 with CRC scrambled
by a TPC-PUSCH-RNTI as described in clause 10.1.
## 11.4 SRS switching
DCI format 2_3 is applicable for uplink carrier(s) of serving cells where a UE
is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission or for uplink carrier(s) of a
serving cell where _srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates_ indicates a separate
power control adjustment state between SRS transmissions and PUSCH

# 12 Bandwidth part operation
If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures
described in this clause for both MCG and SCG
\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell, serving cells belonging to
the MCG respectively.
\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary cell\',
\'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this clause refer
to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell), serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term \'primary cell\' in
this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.
A UE configured for operation in bandwidth parts (BWPs) of a serving cell, is
configured by higher layers for the serving cell a set of at most four
bandwidth parts (BWPs) for receptions by the UE (DL BWP set) in a DL bandwidth
by parameter _BWP-Downlink_ or by parameter _initialDownlinkBWP_ with a set of
parameters configured by _BWP-DownlinkCommon_ and _BWP-DownlinkDedicated_ ,
and a set of at most four BWPs for transmissions by the UE (UL BWP set) in an
UL bandwidth by parameter _BWP-Uplink_ or by parameter _initialUplinkBWP_ with
a set of parameters configured by _BWP-UplinkCommon_ and _BWP-
UplinkDedicated_.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE expects that the BWP
configured by the parameter _initialUplinkBWP_ provided in
_UplinkConfigCommonSIB_ is mapped to only a single RB set.
If a UE is not provided _initialDownlinkBWP_ , an initial DL BWP is defined by
a location and number of contiguous PRBs, starting from a PRB with the lowest
index and ending at a PRB with the highest index among PRBs of a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and a SCS and a cyclic prefix for PDCCH reception in the
CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set; otherwise, the initial DL BWP is provided by
_initialDownlinkBWP_. For operation on the primary cell or on a secondary
cell, a UE is provided an initial UL BWP by _initialUplinkBWP_. If the UE is
configured with a supplementary UL carrier, the UE can be provided an initial
UL BWP on the supplementary UL carrier by _initialUplinkBWP_.
If a UE has dedicated BWP configuration, the UE can be provided by
_firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ a first active DL BWP for receptions and by
_firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id_ a first active UL BWP for transmissions on a carrier
of the primary cell.
For each DL BWP or UL BWP in a set of DL BWPs or UL BWPs, respectively, the UE
is provided the following parameters for the serving cell as defined in [4, TS
38.211] or [6, TS 38.214]:
\- a SCS by _subcarrierSpacing_
\- a cyclic prefix by _cyclicPrefix_
\- a common RB and a number of contiguous RBs provided by
_locationAndBandwidth_ that indicates an offset and a length as RIV according
to [6, TS 38.214], setting , and a value provided by _offsetToCarrier_ for the
_subcarrierSpacing_
\- an index in the set of DL BWPs or UL BWPs by respective _BWP-Id_
\- a set of BWP-common and a set of BWP-dedicated parameters by _BWP-
DownlinkCommon_ and _BWP-DownlinkDedicated_ for the DL BWP, or _BWP-
UplinkCommon_ and _BWP-UplinkDedicated_ for the UL BWP [12, TS 38.331]
For unpaired spectrum operation, a DL BWP from the set of configured DL BWPs
with index provided by _BWP-Id_ is linked with an UL BWP from the set of
configured UL BWPs with index provided by _BWP-Id_ when the DL BWP index and
the UL BWP index are same. For unpaired spectrum operation, a UE does not
expect to receive a configuration where the center frequency for a DL BWP is
different than the center frequency for an UL BWP when the _BWP-Id_ of the DL
BWP is same as the _BWP-Id_ of the UL BWP.
For each DL BWP in a set of DL BWPs of the PCell, a UE can be configured
CORESETs for every type of CSS sets and for USS as described in clause 10.1.
The UE does not expect to be configured without a CSS set on the PCell in the
active DL BWP.
If a UE is provided _controlResourceSetZero_ and _searchSpaceZero_ in _PDCCH-
ConfigSIB1 or PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE determines a CORESET for a_ search
space set from _controlResourcesetZero_ as described in clause 13 and for
Tables 13-1 through 13-10, and determines corresponding PDCCH monitoring
occasions as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-11 through 13-15. If the
active DL BWP is not the initial DL BWP, t _he UE_ determines PDCCH monitoring
occasions _for the_ search space set only if the CORESET bandwidth _is within
the active DL BWP and the active DL BWP has same SCS configuration and same
cyclic prefix as the initial DL BWP_.
For each UL BWP in a set of UL BWPs of the PCell or of the PUCCH-SCell, the UE
is configured resource sets for PUCCH transmissions as described in clause
9.2.1.
A UE receives PDCCH and PDSCH in a DL BWP according to a configured SCS and CP
length for the DL BWP. A UE transmits PUCCH and PUSCH in an UL BWP according
to a configured SCS and CP length for the UL BWP.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format, the
bandwidth part indicator field value indicates the active DL BWP, from the
configured DL BWP set, for DL receptions as described in [5, TS 38.212]. If a
bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format, the bandwidth
part indicator field value indicates the active UL BWP, from the configured UL
BWP set, for UL transmissions as described in [5, TS 38.212]. If a bandwidth
part indicator field is configured in a DCI format and indicates an UL BWP or
a DL BWP different from the active UL BWP or DL BWP, respectively, the UE
shall
\- for each information field in the DCI format
\- if the size of the information field is smaller than the one required for
the DCI format interpretation for the UL BWP or DL BWP that is indicated by
the bandwidth part indicator, the UE prepends zeros to the information field
until its size is the one required for the interpretation of the information
field for the UL BWP or DL BWP prior to interpreting the DCI format
information fields, respectively
\- if the size of the information field is larger than the one required for
the DCI format interpretation for the UL BWP or DL BWP that is indicated by
the bandwidth part indicator, the UE uses a number of least significant bits
of the DCI format equal to the one required for the UL BWP or DL BWP indicated
by bandwidth part indicator prior to interpreting the DCI format information
fields, respectively
\- set the active UL BWP or DL BWP to the UL BWP or DL BWP indicated by the
bandwidth part indicator in the DCI format
If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format 0_1 and
indicates an active UL BWP with different SCS configuration $\mu$_,_ or with
different number $N_{RB - set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}$ of RB sets, than a current
active UL BWP, the UE determines an uplink frequency domain resource
allocation Type 2 based on $X'$ bits and $Y'$ bits that are generated by
independently truncating or padding the $X$ MSBs and the $Y$ LSBs [6, TS
38.214] of the frequency domain resource assignment field of DCI format 0_1,
where truncation starts from the MSBs of the X bits or the Y bits, zero-
padding prepends zeros to the X bits or the Y bits, and
\- if the indicated active UL BWP has SCS configuration $\mu = 1$ and the
current active BWP has SCS configuration $\mu = 0$_,_ the $X$ MSBs are
truncated to $X^{'} = X - 1$ bits, or
\- if the indicated active UL BWP has SCS configuration $\mu = 0$ and the
current active BWP has SCS configuration $\mu = 1$, the $X$ MSBs are zero-
padded to $X^{'} = X + 1$ bits
\- otherwise, the $X$ MSBs are unchanged
and
\- the $Y$ LSBs are truncated or zero-padded to $Y' = \left\lceil
\text{log}_{2}\left( \frac{N_{RB - set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}\left( N_{RB -
set,UL}^{\text{BWP}} + 1 \right)}{2} \right) \right\rceil$ bits where $N_{RB -
set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}$ is a number of RB sets configured for the indicated
active UL BWP
A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that
indicates an active DL BWP or an active UL BWP change with the corresponding
time domain resource assignment field providing a slot offset value for a
PDSCH reception or PUSCH transmission that is smaller than a delay required by
the UE for an active DL BWP change or UL BWP change, respectively [10, TS
38.133].
If a UE detects a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates an
active DL BWP change for a cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit
in the cell during a time duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot
where the UE receives the PDCCH that includes the DCI format in a scheduling
cell until the beginning of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the
time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format.
If a UE detects a DCI format with SCell dormancy indication that indicates an
active DL BWP change for an Scell in slot _n_ of primary cell, the UE is not
required to receive or transmit in the SCell during a time duration specified
in [10, TS 38.133].
If a UE detects a DCI format indicating an active UL BWP change for a cell,
the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time
duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot where the UE receives the
PDCCH that includes the DCI format in the scheduling cell until the beginning
of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource
assignment field in the DCI format.
A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format indicating an active DL BWP change
or an active UL BWP change for a scheduled cell within FR1 (or FR2) in a slot
other than the first slot of a set of slots for the DL SCS of the scheduling
cell that overlaps with a time duration where the UE is not required to
receive or transmit, respectively, for an active BWP change in a different
cell from the scheduled cell within FR1 (or FR2).
A UE expects to detect a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates
an active UL BWP change or an active DL BWP change only if a corresponding
PDCCH is received within the first 3 symbols of a slot.
For a serving cell, a UE can be provided by _defaultDownlinkBWP-Id_ a default
DL BWP among the configured DL BWPs. If a UE is not provided a default DL BWP
by _defaultDownlinkBWP-Id_ , the default DL BWP is the initial DL BWP.
If a UE is provided by _bwp-InactivityTimer_ a timer value for the serving
cell [11, TS 38.321] and the timer is running, the UE decrements the timer at
the end of a subframe for FR1 or at the end of a half subframe for FR2 if the
restarting conditions in [11, TS 38.321] are not met during the interval of
the subframe for FR1 or of the half subframe for FR2.
For a cell where a UE changes an active DL BWP due to a BWP inactivity timer
expiration and for accommodating a delay in the active DL BWP change or the
active UL BWP change required by the UE [10, TS 38.133], the UE is not
required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the
beginning of a subframe for FR1, or of half of a subframe for FR2, that is
immediately after the BWP inactivity timer expires until the beginning of a
slot where the UE can receive or transmit.
When a UE\'s BWP inactivity timer for a cell within FR1 (or FR2) expires
within a time duration where the UE is not required to receive or transmit for
an active UL/DL BWP change in the cell or in a different cell within FR1 (or
FR2), the UE delays the active UL/DL BWP change triggered by the BWP
inactivity timer expiration until a subframe for FR1 or half a subframe for
FR2 that is immediately after the UE completes the active UL/DL BWP change in
the cell or in the different cell within FR1 (or FR2).
If a UE is provided by _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ a first active DL BWP and
by _firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id_ a first active UL BWP on a carrier of a secondary
cell, the UE uses the indicated DL BWP and the indicated UL BWP as the
respective first active DL BWP on the secondary cell and first active UL BWP
on the carrier of the secondary cell.
A UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH when the UE performs RRM measurements
[10, TS 38.133] over a bandwidth that is not within the active DL BWP for the
UE.
# 13 UE procedure for monitoring Type0-PDCCH CSS sets
If during cell search a UE determines from _MIB_ that a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set is present, as described in clause 4.1, the UE determines
a number of consecutive resource blocks and a number of consecutive symbols
for the CORESET of the Type0-PDCCH CSS set from _controlResourceSetZero in_
_pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ , as described in Tables 13-1 through 13-10, for operation
without shared spectrum channel access, or as described in Tables 13-1A and
13-4A for operation with shared spectrum channel access, and determines PDCCH
monitoring occasions from _searchSpaceZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ , included in
_MIB_ , as described in Tables 13-11 through 13-15. and are the SFN and slot
index within a frame of the CORESET based on SCS of the CORESET and and are
the SFN and slot index based on SCS of the CORESET, respectively, where the
SS/PBCH block with index overlaps in time with system frame and slot . The
symbols of the CORESET associated with _pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ in _MIB_ or with
_searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCH-ConfigCommon have normal cyclic prefix._
For operation without shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that the
offset in Tables 13-1 through 13-10 is defined with respect to the SCS of the
CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, provided by _subCarrierSpacingCommon,_ from
the smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set to the smallest
RB index of the common RB overlapping with the first RB of the corresponding
SS/PBCH block. In Tables 13-7, 13-8, and 13-10 is defined in [4, TS 38.211].
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE determines an offset
from a smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set to a smallest
RB index of the common RB overlapping with a first RB of the corresponding
SS/PBCH block
\- _according to the offset in_ Table 13-1A or Table 13-4A, _if the_ frequency
position _of the_ SS/PBCH block corresponds to the GSCN of a synchronization
raster entry as defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], and
\- according to _a sum of a first offset and a second offset_ if the frequency
position of the SS/PBCH block is provided by _ssbFrequency_ in a measurement
configuration associated with a reporting configuration providing _reportCGI_
and does not correspond to the GSCN of a synchronization raster entry as
defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1]_, where_
\- the first offset is _provided in_ Table 13-1A or Table 13-4A, and
\- the second offset is determined as the offset from a smallest RB index of
the common RB overlapping with the first RB of the SS/PBCH block indicated in
the measurement configuration to a smallest RB index of the common RB
overlapping with the first RB of a SS/PBCH block hypothetically located at the
GSCN of a synchronization raster entry, where the single synchronization
raster entry is located in the same channel as the SS/PBCH block used for the
shared spectrum channel access procedure, as described in [15, TS 37.213]
where the offsets are defined with respect to the SCS of the CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set that is _same as the SCS of the corresponding SS/PBCH
block._
For operation without shared spectrum channel access and for the SS/PBCH block
and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, a UE monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set over two consecutive slots starting from slot . For SS/PBCH block with
index , the UE determines an index of slot as that is in a frame with system
frame number (SFN) satisfying if , or in a frame with SFN satisfying if . and
are provided by Tables 13-11 and 13-12, and based on the SCS for PDCCH
receptions in the CORESET [4, TS 38.211]. The index for the first symbol of
the CORESET in slots and is the first symbol index provided by Tables 13-11
and 13-12.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access and for the SS/PBCH block
and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, a UE monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set over slots that include Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions associated with
SS/PBCH blocks that are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block that provides
a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set with respect to average gain, quasi co-
location \'typeA\' and \'typeD\' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214].
For a candidate SS/PBCH block index $\overline{i}$, where $0 \leq \overline{i}
\leq {\overline{L}}_{\max} - 1$, two consecutive slots starting from slot
$n_{0}$ include the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions. The UE
determines an index of slot $n_{0}$ as $n_{0} = \left( O \cdot 2^{\mu} +
\left\lfloor \overline{i} \cdot M \right\rfloor \right)\text{\ mod\
}N_{\text{slot}}^{frame,\ \mu}$ that is in a frame with system frame number
(SFN) $\text{SFN}_{C}$ satisfying $\text{SFN}_{C}\ mod\ 2 = 0$ if
$\left\lfloor \left( O \cdot 2^{\mu} + \left\lfloor \overline{i} \cdot M
\right\rfloor \right)/N_{\text{slot}}^{frame,\ \mu} \right\rfloor\ mod\ 2 =
0$, or in a frame with SFN satisfying $\text{SFN}_{C}\ mod\ 2 = 1$ if
$\left\lfloor \left( O \cdot 2^{\mu} + \left\lfloor \overline{i} \cdot M
\right\rfloor \right)/N_{\text{slot}}^{frame,\ \mu} \right\rfloor\ mod\ 2 =
1$. $M$ and $O$ are provided by Table 13-11, and $\mu \in { 0,\ 1}$ based on
the SCS for PDCCH receptions in the CORESET [4, TS 38.211]. The index for the
first symbol of the CORESET in slots $n_{0}$ and $n_{0} + 1$ is the first
symbol index provided by Table 13-11. The UE does not expect to be configured
with $M = 1/2$, or with $M = 2$, when $N_{\text{SSB}}^{\text{QCL}} = 1$.
For the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, a UE monitors
PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over one slot with Type0-PDCCH CSS set
periodicity equal to the periodicity of SS/PBCH block. For the SS/PBCH block
and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, if the active DL BWP is the initial
DL BWP, the UE is expected to be able to perform radio link monitoring, as
described in clause 5, and measurements for radio resource management [10, TS
38.133] using a SS/PBCH block that provides a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set.
For a SS/PBCH block with index , the UE determines the slot index and based on
parameters provided by Tables 13-13 through 13-15.

If a UE detects a first SS/PBCH block and determines that a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present, and for for FR1 or for for FR2, the UE may
determine the nearest (in the corresponding frequency direction) global
synchronization channel number (GSCN) of a second SS/PBCH block having a
CORESET for an associated Type0-PDCCH CSS set as . is the GSCN of the first
SS/PBCH block and is a GSCN offset provided by Table 13-16 for FR1 and Table
13-17 for FR2. If the UE detects the second SS/PBCH block and the second
SS/PBCH block does not provide a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described
in clause 4.1, the UE may ignore the information related to GSCN of SS/PBCH
block locations for performing cell search.
If a UE detects a SS/PBCH block and determines that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH
CSS set is not present, and for for FR1 or for for FR2, the UE determines that
there is no SS/PBCH block having an associated Type0-PDCCH CSS set within a
GSCN range . and are respectively determined by _controlResourceSetZero_ and
_searchSpaceZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1._ If the GSCN range is , the UE

# 14 Integrated access-backhaul operation
Throughout this specification, unless otherwise noted, statements using the
term \"UE\" in clauses 4 through 13 are equally applicable to the IAB-MT of an
IAB node.
A procedure for an IAB-MT to perform cell search, system information
acquisition, or random access procedure is same as a corresponding one for a
UE except for the following.
For initial cell selection, an IAB-MT may assume that half frames with SS/PBCH
blocks occur with a periodicity of 16 frames.
For PRACH transmission, an IAB-MT determines frames and subframes/slots within
the frames containing PRACH occasions as described in [4, TS 38.211].
The IAB-MT determines an association period for mapping SS/PBCH blocks to
PRACH occasions based on a PRACH configuration period as described in clause
8.1 and according to Table 14-1 instead of Table 8.1-1. An association pattern
period includes one or more association periods and is determined so that a
pattern between PRACH occasions and SS/PBCH blocks repeats at most every 640
msec. A PRACH occasion in a PRACH slot is valid according to the conditions in
clause 8.1.
Table 14-1: Mapping between PRACH configuration period and SS/PBCH block to
PRACH occasion association period for an IAB-MT
PRACH configuration period (msec) Association period (number of PRACH
configuration periods)

2, 4, 8} 160 {1, 2, 4} 320 {1, 2} 640 {1}
If an IAB-node is provided an index $T_{\text{delta}}$ in a Timing Delta MAC
CE [11, TS 38.321] from a serving cell, the IAB-node may assume that $\left(
N_{\text{TA}}/2 + N_{\text{delta}} + T_{\text{delta}} \cdot G_{\text{step}}
\right) \cdot T_{\text{c}}$ _is a time difference between a DU transmission of
a signal from the serving cell and a reception of the signal by the IAB-MT_
when $N_{\text{TA}}/2 + N_{\text{delta}} + T_{\text{delta}} \cdot
G_{\text{step}} > 0$, where $N_{\text{TA}}$ is obtained as for a \"UE\" in
clause 4.2 **_for the TAG containing the serving cell and_**
$N_{\text{delta}}$ and $G_{\text{step}}$ are determined as
\- $N_{\text{delta}} = - 70528$ and $G_{\text{step}} = 64$, if the serving
cell providing the Timing Delta MAC CE operates in FR1,
\- $N_{\text{delta}} = - 17664$ and $G_{\text{step}} = 32$, if the serving
cell providing the Timing Delta MAC CE operates in FR2
The IAB-node may use the time difference to determine a DU transmission time.
A slot format for an IAB-DU or an IAB-MT includes downlink symbols, uplink
symbols, and flexible symbols.
For each cell of an IAB-DU, the IAB-DU can be provided an indication for a
slot format over a number of slots by _gNB-DU Cell Resource Configuration_
[16, TS 38.473].
For each serving cell, an IAB-MT can be provided an indication for a slot
format over a number of slots by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT_. If
the IAB-MT is provided _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT_ , the
statements in clause 11.1 that include \"_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated_ \"
apply to the IAB-MT of an IAB node by replacing \"_tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationDedicated_ \" with \"_tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT_ \"
for the IAB-MT, except that the _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT_
provides
\- a set of slot configurations by _slotSpecificConfigurationsToAddModList-
IAB-MT_
\- for each slot configuration from the set of slot configurations
\- a slot index for a slot provided by _slotIndex_
\- a set of symbols for a slot by _symbols-IAB-MT_ where
\- if _symbols-IAB-MT_ = _allDownlink_ , all symbols in the slot are downlink
\- if _symbols-IAB-MT_ = _allUplink_ , all symbols in the slot are uplink
\- if _symbols-IAB-MT_ = _explicit_ , _nrofDownlinkSymbols_ provides a number
of downlink first symbols in the slot and _nrofUplinkSymbols_ provides a
number of uplink last symbols in the slot. If _nrofDownlinkSymbols_ is not
provided, there are no downlink first symbols in the slot and if
_nrofUplinkSymbols_ is not provided, there are no uplink last symbols in the
slot. The remaining symbols in the slot are flexible.
\- if _symbols-IAB-MT_ = _explicit-IAB-MT_ , _nrofUplinkSymbols_ provides a
number of uplink first symbols in the slot and _nrofDownlinkSymbols_ provides
a number of downlink last symbols in the slot. If _nrofUplinkSymbols_ is not
provided, there are no uplink first symbols in the slot and if
_nrofDownlinkSymbols_ is not provided, there are no downlink last symbols in
the slot. The remaining symbols in the slot are flexible.
An IAB-MT can be provided, by _SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell_ , a list of slot
format combinations applicable for one serving cell and, by
_SlotFormatIndicator_ , a configuration for monitor a DCI format 2_0
indicating a slot format combination, from the list of slot format
combinations, over a number of slots as described in clause 11.1.1. In
addition to the slot formats in Table 11.1.1-1, an SFI field for an IAB-MT in
DCI format 2_0 can indicate to the IAB-MT a slot format from the slot formats
in Table 14-2.

For a serving cell of an IAB-MT, the IAB-MT can be provided by Provided Guard
Symbols MAC CE a number of symbols that will not be used for the IAB-MT in
slots where the IAB-node transitions between IAB-MT and IAB-node DU and a SCS
configuration for the number of symbols [11, TS 38.321].
With reference to slots of an IAB-DU cell, a symbol in a slot of an IAB-DU
cell can be configured to be of hard, soft, or unavailable type. When a
downlink, uplink, or flexible symbol is configured as hard, the IAB-DU cell
can respectively transmit, receive, or either transmit or receive in the
symbol.
When a downlink, uplink, or flexible symbol is configured as soft, the IAB-DU
cell can respectively transmit, receive or either transmit or receive in the
symbol only if
\- the IAB-MT does not transmit or receive during the symbol of the IAB-DU
cell, or
\- the IAB-MT would transmit or receive during the symbol of the IAB-DU cell,
and the transmission or reception during the symbol of the IAB-DU cell is not
changed due to a use of the symbol by the IAB-DU, or
\- the IAB-MT detects a DCI format 2_5 with an AI index field value indicating
the soft symbol as available
When a symbol is configured as unavailable, the IAB-DU neither transmits nor
receives in the symbol.
A symbol of a slot is equivalent to being configured as hard if an IAB-DU
would transmit a SS/PBCH block, PDCCH for Type0-PDCCH CSS sets configured by
_pdcchConfigSIB1,_ or a periodic CSI-RS in the symbol of the slot, or would
receive a PRACH or a SR in the symbol of the slot.
If an IAB-node is provided an _AvailabilityIndicator_ , the IAB-node is
provided an AI-RNTI by _ai-RNTI_ and a payload size of a DCI format 2_5 by
_dci-PayloadSizeAI_. The IAB-node is also provided a search space set
configuration, by **_SearchSpace, for monitoring PDCCH._**
For each cell of an IAB-DU in a set of cells of the IAB-DU, the IAB-DU can be
provided:
\- an identity of the IAB-DU cell by _iab-DU-CellIdentity_
\- a location of an availability indicator (AI) index field in DCI format 2_5
by _positionInDCI-AI_
\- a set of availability combinations by _availabilityCombinations_ , where
each availability combination in the set of availability combinations includes
\- _resourceAvailability_ indicating availability of soft symbols in one or
more slots for the IAB-DU cell, and
\- a mapping for the soft symbol availability combinations provided by
_resourceAvailability_ to a corresponding AI index field value in DCI format
2_5 provided by _availabilityCombinationId_
The IAB-DU can assume a same SCS configuration for _availabilityCombinations_
for a cell as an SCS configuration provided by _gNB-DU Cell Resource
Configuration_ for the cell.
An AI index field value in a DCI format 2_5 indicates to an IAB-DU a soft
symbol availability in each slot for a number of slots starting from the
earliest slot of the IAB-DU which overlaps in time with the slot of the IAB-MT
where the IAB-MT detects the DCI format 2_5. The number of slots is equal to
or larger than a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_5 as provided
by **_SearchSpace_**. The AI index field includes bits where maxAIindex is the
maximum of the values provided by corresponding _availabilityCombinationId_.
An availability for a soft symbol in a slot is identified by a corresponding
value _resourceAvailability_ as provided in Table 14-3.
Table 14-3: Mapping between values of _resourceAvailability_ elements and
types of soft symbol availability in a slot
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | Value | Indication | +=======+================================================================+ | 0 | No indication of availability for soft symbols | +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1 | DL soft symbols are indicated available | | | | | | No indication of availability for UL and Flexible soft symbols | +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | 2 | UL soft symbols are indicated available | | | | | | No indication of availability for DL and Flexible soft symbols | +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | 3 | DL and UL soft symbols are indicated available | | | | | | No indication of availability for Flexible soft symbols | +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | 4 | Flexible soft symbols are indicated available | | | | | | No indication of availability for DL and UL soft symbols | +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | 5 | DL and Flexible soft symbols are indicated available | | | | | | No indication of availability for UL soft symbols | +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | 6 | UL and Flexible soft symbols are indicated available | | | | | | No indication of availability for DL soft symbols | +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | 7 | DL, UL, and Flexible soft symbols are indicated available | +-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2_5 is smaller than a
duration of an availability combination of soft symbols over a number of slots
that the IAB-MT obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2_5 by a
corresponding AI index field value, and the IAB-MT detects more than one DCI
formats 2_5 indicating an availability combination of soft symbols in a slot,
the IAB-MT expects that each of the more than one DCI formats 2_5 indicates a
same value for the availability combination of the soft symbols in the slot.
An IAB-MT monitors PDCCH candidates for a DCI format 2_5 with CRC scrambled by
AI-RNTI in one or both of the following search space sets:
\- a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by _SearchSpace_ in _PDCCH-Config_ with
_searchSpaceType_ = _common_ ;
\- a USS set configured by _SearchSpace_ in _PDCCH-Config_ with
_searchSpaceType_ = ue-Specific.
# 15 Dual active protocol stack based handover
If a UE indicates a capability for dual active protocol stack based handover
(DAPS HO), the UE can be provided with a source MCG and a target MCG.
If a UE is configured with a target MCG using NR radio access in FR1 or in FR2
and with a source MCG using NR radio access in FR2 or in FR1, respectively,
the UE performs transmission power control independently per cell group as
described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5.
If a UE is configured with a target MCG using NR radio access in FR1 and a
source MCG using NR radio access in FR1, the UE is configured a maximum power
$P_{\text{MCG}}$ for transmissions on the target MCG by _p-DAPS-Target_ and a
maximum power $P_{\text{SCG}}$ for transmissions on the source MCG by _p-DAPS-
Source_ and with an inter-CG power sharing mode by _uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-
Mode_. The UE determines a transmission power on the target MCG and a
transmission power on the source MCG per frequency range.
If the UE indicates support for semi-static power sharing mode1 and is
provided _uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode_ = _Semi-static-mode1_ , the UE
determines a transmission power for the target MCG or for the source MCG as
described in clause 7.6.2 for **_nrdc-PCmode-FR1_** = _Semi-static-mode1_ by
considering the target MCG as the MCG and the source MCG as the SCG.
If the UE indicates support for semi-static power sharing mode2 and is
provided _uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode_ = _Semi-static-mode2_ , the UE
determines a transmission power for the target MCG or for the source SCG as
described in clause 7.6.2 for **_nrdc-PCmode-FR1_** = _Semi-static-mode2_ by
considering the target MCG as the MCG and the source MCG as the SCG. The UE
expects to be provided _uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode_ = _Semi-static-mode2_
only for synchronous DAPS HO operation [10, TS 38.133].
If the UE indicates support for dynamic power sharing and is provided
_uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode_ = _Dynamic_ , the UE determines a transmission
power for the target MCG or for the source MCG as described in clause 7.6.2
for **_nrdc-PCmode-FR1_** = _Dynamic_ by considering the target MCG as the MCG
and the source MCG as the SCG.
Intra-frequency DAPS handover is described in clause 6.1.3.2 of [10, TS
38.133].
For DAPS handover that is not intra-frequency, if
> \- the UE does not indicate support of _interFreqUL-
> TransCancellationDAPS-r16_ , and
>
> \- UE does not indicate a capability for power sharing between source and
> target MCG in DAPS handover or the UE is not provided with
> _uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode_ ,
the UE does not expect transmissions on the target and source cell in
overlapping time resources.
For DAPS handover that is not intra-frequency, if
> \- the UE indicates support of _interFreqUL-TransCancellationDAPS-r16_ , and
>
> \- UE does not indicate a capability for power sharing between source and
> target MCG in DAPS handover or the UE is not provided with
> _uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode_ , and
>
> \- UE transmissions on the target cell and the source cell are in
> overlapping time resources,
the UE transmits only on the target cell, and cancels the transmission to
source cell.
For intra-frequency DAPS handover, if
> \- UE transmissions on the target cell and the source cell are in
> overlapping time resources,
the UE transmits only on the target cell and cancels the transmission on the
source cell.
The UE does not expect to cancel a transmission on the source cell if a first
symbol of the transmission on the source cell is less than $T_{\text{proc,2}}
+ d$ after a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE receives a PDCCH providing
a DCI format scheduling a transmission on the target cell. $T_{\text{proc,2}}$
is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding PUSCH processing
capability [6, TS 38.214] assuming $d_{\text{2}\text{,1}} = 1$, $d$ is a time
duration corresponding to 2 symbols for SCS configuration $\mu$, and $\mu$ is
the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH
providing the DCI format and the SCS configuration for the transmission on the
source cell. If the UE transmits PRACH using 1.25 kHz or 5 kHz SCS on the
source cell, the UE determines $T_{\text{proc,2}}$ assuming SCS configuration
$\mu = 0$.
A UE does not expect to cancel a transmission on the source cell if the first
symbol of the source cell transmission occurs, relative to a last symbol of a
PDSCH reception conveying a RAR message with a RAR UL grant on the target
cell, after a number of symbols that is smaller than $N_{\text{T,1}} +
N_{\text{T,2}} + 0.5$ msec, where $N_{\text{T,1}}$ is a time duration of
$N_{\text{1}}$ symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE
processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured,
$N_{\text{T,2}}$ is a time duration of $N_{\text{2}}$ symbols corresponding to
a PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 [6, TS 38.214] and the
UE considers that $N_{\text{1}}$ and $N_{2}$ correspond to the smaller of the
SCS configurations for the PDSCH on the target cell and the transmission on
the source cell. For $\mu = 0$, the UE assumes $N_{\text{1,0}} = 14$ [6, TS
38.214].
For intra-frequency DAPS handover operation, the UE expects that an active DL
BWP and an active UL BWP on the target cell are within an active DL BWP and an
active UL BWP on the source cell, respectively.
If a UE is provided search space sets on both the target MCG and the source
MCG, in any slot the UE does not expect to have USS sets on both the target
MCG and the source MCG that result in the number of monitored PDCCH candidates
and the total number of non-overlapped CCEs in both cells that each exceed the
corresponding maximum numbers per slot defined in Table 10.1-2 and Table
10.1-3.
For DAPS operation in a same frequency band, a UE does not transmit
PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS to the source MCG in a slot overlapping in time with a PRACH
transmission to the target MCG or when a gap between a first or last symbol of
a PRACH transmission to the target MCG in a first slot would be separated by
less than $N$ symbols from a last or first symbol, respectively, of the
PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission to the source MCG in a second slot. For DAPS
operation in a same frequency band, a UE does not transmit PRACH on the source
MCG in a slot overlapping in time with a PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission on the
target MCG or when a gap between the first or last symbol of a PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS
transmission on the target MCG is separated by less than $N$ symbols from a
last or a first symbol, respectively, of a PRACH transmission on the source
MCG. $N = 2$ for $\mu = 0$ or $\mu = 1$, $N = 4$ for $\mu = 2$ or $\mu = 3$,
and $\mu$ is the SCS configuration of the active UL BWP for the
PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission. The PUSCH processing capability is the
processing capability of source cell.
# 16 UE **procedures for sidelink**
A UE is provided by _SL-BWP-Config_ or _SL-BWP-ConfigCommon_ a BWP for SL
transmissions (SL BWP) with numerology and resource grid determined as
described in [4, TS 38.211]. For a resource pool within the SL BWP, the UE is
provided by _sl-NumSubchannel_ a number of sub-channels where each sub-channel
includes a number of contiguous RBs provided by _sl-SubchannelSize_. The first
RB of the first sub-channel in the SL BWP is indicated by _sl-StartRB-
Subchannel_. Available slots for a resource pool are provided by _sl-
TimeResource_ and occur with a periodicity of 10240 ms. For an available slot
without S-SS/PSBCH blocks, SL transmissions can start from a first symbol
indicated by _sl-StartSymbol_ and be within a number of consecutive symbols
indicated by _sl-LengthSymbols_. For an available slot with S-SS/PSBCH blocks,
the first symbol and the number of consecutive symbols is predetermined.
The UE expects to use a same numerology in the SL BWP and in an active UL BWP
in a same carrier of a same cell. If the active UL BWP numerology is different
than the SL BWP numerology, the SL BWP is deactivated.
A priority of a PSSCH according to **NR radio access** or according to E-UTRA
**radio access** is indicated by a priority field in a respective scheduling
SCI format. A priority of a PSSS/SSSS/PSBCH according to E-UTRA radio access
is provided by _sl-SSB-PriorityEUTRA_ [13, TS 36.213]. A priority of an
S-SS/PSBCH block is provided by _sl-SSB-PriorityNR_. A priority of a PSFCH is
same as the priority of a corresponding PSSCH.
**A UE does not expect to be provided search space sets associated with
CORESETs on more than one cell to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format
3_0 or DCI format 3_1.**
## 16.1 Synchronization procedures
A UE receives the following SL synchronization signals in order to perform
synchronization procedures based on S-SS/PSBCH blocks: SL primary
synchronization signals (S-PSS) and SL secondary synchronization signals
(S-SSS) [4, TS 38.211].
A UE assumes that reception occasions of a physical sidelink broadcast channel
(PSBCH), S-PSS, and S-SSS are in consecutive symbols [4, TS 38.211] and form a
S-SS/PSBCH block.
For reception of a S-SS/PSBCH block, a UE assumes a frequency location
corresponding to the subcarrier with index 66 in the S-SS/PSBCH block [4, TS
38.211], is provided by _sl-AbsoluteFrequencySSB_. The UE assumes that a S-PSS
symbol, a S-SSS symbol, and a PSBCH symbol have a same transmission power. The
UE assumes a same numerology of the S-SS/PSBCH as for a SL BWP of the
S-SS/PSBCH block reception, and that a bandwidth of the S-SS/PSBCH is within a
bandwidth of the SL BWP. The UE assumes the subcarrier with index 0 in the
S-SS/PSBCH block is aligned with a subcarrier with index 0 in an RB of the SL
BWP.
A UE is provided, by _sl-NumSSB-WithinPeriod_ , a number $N_{\text{period}}^{S
- SSB}$ of S-SS/PSBCH blocks in a period of 16 frames. The UE assumes that a
transmission of the S-SS/PSBCH blocks in the period is with a periodicity of
16 frames. The UE determines indexes of slots that include S-SS/PSBCH block as
$N_{\text{offset}}^{S - SSB}$+$\left( N_{\text{interval}}^{S - SSB} + 1
\right) \cdot i_{S - SSB}$, where
\- index 0 corresponds to a first slot in a frame with SFN of the serving cell
satisfying $(SFN\ mod\ 16) = 0$ or DFN satisfying (DFN mod 16) = 0
\- $i_{S - SSB}$ is a S-SS/PSBCH block index within the number of S-SS/PSBCH
blocks in the period, with $0 \leq i_{S - SSB} \leq N_{\text{period}}^{S -
SSB} - 1$
\- $N_{\text{offset}}^{S - SSB}$ is a slot offset from a start of the period
to the first slot including S-SS/PSBCH block, provided by _sl-TimeOffsetSSB_
\- $N_{\text{interval}}^{S - SSB}$ is a slot interval between S-SS/PSBCH
blocks, provided by _sl-TimeInterval_
For paired spectrum, an S-SS/PSBCH block can be transmitted/received only in a
slot of an UL carrier. For unpaired spectrum, an S-SS/PSBCH block can be
transmitted/received only in a slot of which all OFDM symbols are configured
as UL by _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ of the serving cell if provided or
_sl-TDD-Configuration_ if provided or _sl-TDD-Config_ of the received PSBCH if
provided. Or if _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ and _sl-TDD-Configuration_ are
not provided for a spectrum indicated with only PC5 interface in Table
5.2E.1-1 in [TS 38.101-1], an S-SS/PSBCH block can be transmitted/received in
any slot of the spectrum.
For transmission of an S-SS/PSBCH block, a UE includes a bit sequence $a_{0},\
a_{1},\ a_{2},\ a_{3},\ \ldots,\ a_{11}$ in the PSBCH payload to indicate _sl-
TDD-Config_ and provide a slot format over a number of slots.
For paired spectrum, or if _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ and _sl-TDD-
Configuration_ are not provided for a spectrum indicated with only PC5
interface in Table 5.2E.1-1 in [TS 38.101-1],
\- $a_{0},\ a_{1},\ a_{2},\ a_{3},a_{4}{,\ a}_{5},\ a_{6},\ a_{7},a_{8},\
a_{9},\ a_{10},\ a_{11}$ are set to \'1\';
else
\- $a_{0} = 0$ if _pattern1_ is provided by _sl-TDD-Configuration or tdd-UL-
DL-ConfigurationCommon_ ; $a_{0} = 1$ if both _pattern1_ and _pattern2_ are
provided by _sl-TDD-Configuration or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ as
described in clause 11.1
\- $a_{1},\ a_{2},\ a_{3},a_{4}$ are determined based on
\- $P$ _in pattern1_ as described in Table 16.1-1 for $a_{0} = 0$
\- $P$ _in pattern1_ and $P_{2}$ _in pattern2_ as described in Table 16.1-2
for $a_{0} = 1$
where $P$ and $P_{2}$ are as described in clause 11.1
\- $a_{5},\ a_{6},\ a_{7},a_{8},\ a_{9},\ a_{10},\ a_{11}$ are the 7th to 1st
LSBs of $u_{\text{slots}}^{\text{SL}}$_, respectively_
\- for $a_{0} = 0$, $u_{\text{slots}}^{\text{SL}} = u_{\text{slots}}_2^{\mu -
\mu_{\text{ref}}} + \left\lfloor \frac{u_{\text{sym}}_ 2^{\mu -
\mu_{\text{ref}}}}{L} \right\rfloor + I_{1}$
\- for $a_{0} = 1$, $u_{\text{slots}}^{\text{SL}} = \left\lfloor
\frac{u_{slots,2}_2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}} + \left\lfloor \frac{u_{sym,2}_
2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}}}{L} \right\rfloor + I_{2}}{w} \right\rfloor
_\left\lceil \frac{{P_ 2}^{\mu} + 1}{w} \right\rceil + \left\lfloor
\frac{u_{\text{slots}}_2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}} + \left\lfloor
\frac{u_{\text{sym}}_ 2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}}}{L} \right\rfloor + I_{1}}{w}
\right\rfloor$
> where
\- $L$ is the number of symbols in a slot: $L = 12$ if _cyclicPrefix_ =
\"ECP\"; else, $L = 14$
\- $I_{1}$ is 1 if $u_{\text{sym}}*2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}}\ mod\ L \geq \ L
- Y$, else $I_{1}$ is 0
\- $I_{2}$ is 1 if $u_{sym,2}*2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}}\ mod\ L \geq L - Y$,
else $I_{2}$ is 0
\- $Y$ is the sidelink starting symbol index provided by _sl-StartSymbol_
\- $w$ is the granularity of slots indication as described in Table 16.1-2
\- $\mu_{\text{ref}}$_,_ $u_{\text{slots}}$, $u_{\text{sym}}$, $u_{slots,2}$,
$u_{sym,2}$ are the parameters of _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_ as described
in clause 11.1, or the parameters of _sl-TDD-Configuration_ as defined in [12,
TS 38.331]

### 16.2.4 Prioritization of transmissions/receptions
#### 16.2.4.1 Simultaneous NR and E-UTRA transmission/reception
If a UE
\- **would transmit a first channel/signal using** E-UTRA radio access **and
second channels/signals using NR radio access, and**
\- **a transmission of the first channel/signal would overlap in time with a
transmission of the second channels/signals, and**

access and NR radio access at the UE** $T$ **msec prior to the start of the
earliest of the two transmissions, where** $T \leq 4$ **and is based on UE
implementation,**
the UE transmits only the channels/signals of the radio access technology with
the highest priority as determined by the SCI formats scheduling the
transmissions or, in case of a S-SS/PSBCH block or a sidelink synchronization
signal using E-UTRA radio access, as indicated by higher layers or, in case of
PSFCH, equal to the priority of the corresponding PSSCH.
If a UE

E-UTRA radio access **and receive a second channel/signal or transmit second
channels/signals using NR radio access, and**
\- **a transmission or reception of the first channel/signal would
respectively overlap in time with a reception of the second channel/signal or
transmission of the second channels/signals, and**

synchronization signal using E-UTRA radio access, as indicated by higher
layers or, in case of PSFCH, equal to the priority of the corresponding PSSCH.

associated with the $N_{sch,Tx,PSFCH}$ PSFCHs and the $N_{sch,Rx,PSFCH}$

occasion,** the UE transmits $N_{Tx,PSFCH}$ PSFCHs corresponding to the
smallest $N_{Tx,PSFCH}$ priority field values indicated in all SCI formats 1-A
associated with the PSFCH transmission occasion.
#### 16.2.4.3 Simultaneous SL and UL transmissions/receptions
If a UE
\- **would simultaneously transmit on the UL and on the SL in a carrier or in
two respective carriers, and**
\- **the UE is not capable of simultaneous transmissions on the UL and on the
SL in the carrier or in the two respective carriers**
the UE transmits only on the link, UL or SL, with the higher priority.
If a UE

or
\- **would simultaneously transmit on the UL and receive on the SL in two
respective carriers and the UE is not capable of simultaneous transmission on

transmission**, if the UL transmission has higher priority than the SL
transmission** as determined in clause 16.2.4.3.1**, so that the total UE
transmission power would not exceed** $P_{\text{CMAX}}$
##### 16.2.4.3.1 Prioritizations for sidelink and uplink
transmissions/receptions
A UE performs prioritization between SL transmissions/receptions and UL
transmissions after performing the procedures described in clause 9, clause
9.2.5, and clause 9.2.6, and in clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214].
PSFCH transmissions in a slot have a same priority value as the smallest
priority value among PSSCH receptions with corresponding HARQ-ACK information
provided by the PSFCH transmissions in the slot.
PSFCH receptions in a slot have a same priority value as the smallest priority
value among PSSCH transmissions with corresponding HARQ-ACK information
provided by the PSFCH receptions in the slot.
A priority of S-SS/PSBCH block transmission or reception is provided by _sl-
SSB-PriorityNR._
For prioritization between SL transmission or PSFCH/S-SS/PSBCH block reception
and UL transmission other than a PRACH, or a PUSCH scheduled by an UL grant in
a RAR and its retransmission, or a PUSCH corresponding to Type-2 random access
procedure and its retransmission, or a PUCCH with sidelink HARQ-ACK
information report
\- if the UL transmission is for a PUSCH or for a PUCCH with priority index 1,
\- if _sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC_ is provided
\- the SL transmission or reception has higher priority than the UL
transmission if the priority value of the SL transmission or reception is
smaller than _sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC;_ otherwise, the UL transmission
has higher priority than the SL transmission or reception
\- else
\- the UL transmission has higher priority than the SL transmission or
reception
\- else
\- the SL transmission or reception has higher priority than the UL
transmission if the priority value of the SL transmission(s) or reception is
smaller than _sl-PriorityThreshold;_ otherwise, the UL transmission has higher
priority than the SL transmission or reception
A PRACH transmission, or a PUSCH scheduled by an UL grant in a RAR and its
retransmission, or a PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure and its
retransmission, or a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in response to
successRAR, or a PUCCH indicated by a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by a
corresponding TC-RNTI has higher priority than a SL transmission or reception.
A PUCCH transmission with a sidelink HARQ-ACK information report has higher
priority than a SL transmission if a priority value of the PUCCH is smaller
than a priority value of the SL transmission. The priority value of the PUCCH
transmission is as described in clause 16.5. If the priority value of the
PUCCH transmission is larger than the priority value of the SL transmission,
the SL transmission has higher priority.
A PUCCH transmission with a sidelink HARQ-ACK information report has higher
priority than a PSFCH/S-SS/PSBCH block reception if a priority value of the
PUCCH is smaller than a priority value of the SL reception. If the priority
value of the PUCCH transmission is larger than the priority value of the
PSFCH/S-SS/PSBCH block reception, the SL reception has higher priority.
When one or more SL transmissions from a UE overlap in time with multiple non-
overlapping UL transmissions from the UE, the UE performs the SL transmissions
if at least one SL transmission is prioritized over all UL transmissions
subject to the UE processing timeline with respect to the first SL
transmission and the first UL transmission.
When one or more UL transmissions from a UE overlap in time with multiple non-
overlapping SL transmissions, the UE performs the UL transmissions if at least
one UL transmission is prioritized over all SL transmissions subject to the UE
processing timeline with respect to the first SL transmission and the first UL
transmission.
When one SL transmission overlaps in time with one or more overlapping UL
transmissions, the UE performs the SL transmission if the SL transmission is
prioritized over all UL transmissions subject to both the UE multiplexing and
processing timelines with respect to the first SL transmission and the first
UL transmission, where the UE processing timeline with respect to the first SL
transmission and the first UL transmission is same as when one or more SL
transmissions overlap in time with multiple non-overlapping UL transmissions.
When one SL transmission overlaps in time with one or more overlapping UL
transmissions, the UE performs the UL transmission if at least one UL
transmission is prioritized over the SL transmission subject to both the UE
multiplexing and processing timelines with respect to the first SL
transmission and the first UL transmission, where the UE processing timeline
with respect to the first SL transmission and the first UL transmission is
same as when one or more SL transmissions overlap in time with multiple non-
overlapping UL transmissions.
## 16.3 UE procedure for reporting HARQ-ACK on sidelink
A UE can be indicated by an SCI format scheduling a PSSCH reception to
transmit a PSFCH with HARQ-ACK information in response to the PSSCH reception.
The UE provides HARQ-ACK information that includes ACK or NACK, or only NACK.
A UE can be provided, by _sl-PSFCH-Period_ , a number of slots in a resource
pool for a period of PSFCH transmission occasion resources. If the number is
zero, PSFCH transmissions from the UE in the resource pool are disabled.
A UE expects that a slot ${t'}_{k}^{\text{SL}}$ $(0 \leq k  if slot $n_{U}$ starts at a same time as or after a slot for an active UL
> BWP change on the PCell and slot $\left\lfloor \left( n_{U} - K_{1,k}
> \right) \cdot 2^{\mu_{\text{SL}} - \mu_{\text{UL}}} \right\rfloor + n_{S}$
> is before the slot for the active UL BWP change on the PCell
$n_{S} = n_{S} + 1$;
else
> if slot $\left\lfloor \left( n_{U} - K_{1,k} \right) \cdot
> 2^{\mu_{\text{SL}} - \mu_{\text{UL}}} \right\rfloor + n_{S}$ belongs to the
> sidelink resource pool and includes PSFCH resources as indicated by a
> sidelink resource pool bitmap and _sl-PSFCH-Period_ , where $K_{1,k}$ is the
> _k_ -th slot timing value in set $K_{1}$
Set $n_{F} = 0$ -- index of a SL slot within an PSFCH period
while $n_{F}  $M_{A} = M_{A} \cup j$;
>
> $j = j + 1$;
>
> $n_{F} = n_{F} + 1$;
end while
end if
$n_{S} = n_{S} + 1$;
end if
end while
end if
$k = k + 1$;
end while
The cardinality of the set $M_{A}$ defines a total number $M$ of occasions for
candidate PSSCH transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions
corresponding to the HARQ-ACK information bits. A UE determines
${\widetilde{o}}_{0}^{\text{ACK}},{\widetilde{o}}_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\ldots,{\widetilde{o}}_{O_{\text{ACK}}
- 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ HARQ-ACK information bits, for a total number of
$O_{\text{ACK}}$ HARQ-ACK information bits as
${\widetilde{o}}_{j}^{\text{ACK}}$ = HARQ-ACK information bit for candidate
PSSCH transmission with index $j$ with corresponding PSFCH reception, for $0\
\leq j  then in any of the set $M_{A}$ of occasions for candidate PSSCH
> transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions, as described in
> clause 16.5.1.1 _,_ the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the
> PUSCH transmission;
\- else the UE generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause
16.5.1.1, unless the UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for
_-_ PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions
corresponding to a SL configured grant, or
_-_ PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions that are
scheduled by DCI format 3_0 with a counter SAI field value of 1,
> in the set $M_{A}$ of occasions for candidate PSSCH transmissions with
> corresponding PSFCH reception occasions, in which case the UE generates
> HARQ-ACK information only for the PSFCH reception occasions as described in
> clause 16.5.1.
A UE sets to NACK value in the HARQ-ACK codebook any HARQ-ACK information
corresponding to PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions
scheduled by a DCI format 3_0 that the UE detects in a PDCCH monitoring
occasion that starts after a PDCCH monitoring occasion where the UE detects a
DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission.
If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
scheduled by a DCI format that includes a SAI field, the UE generates the
HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 16.5.1.1 when a value of the SAI
field in the DCI format is $V_{T - \text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 1$. The UE does
not generate a HARQ-ACK codebook for multiplexing in the PUSCH transmission
when $V_{T - \text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 0$ unless the UE generates HARQ-ACK
information only for
\- PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions corresponding
to a SL configured grant, or
\- PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions that are
scheduled by a DCI format 3_0 with a counter SAI field value of 1,
> in the set $M_{A}$ of occasions for candidate PSSCH transmissions with
> corresponding PSFCH reception occasions as described in clause 16.5.1.
$V_{T - \text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 0$ if the SAI field in the DCI format is set
to \'0\'; otherwise, $V_{T - \text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 1$.
### 16.5.2 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook determination
This clause applies if the UE is configured with _pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook =
dynamic_.
#### 16.5.2.1 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink control channel
A UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format 3_0 for
scheduling PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH reception occasions on an
active DL BWP of a serving cell $c$, as described in clause 10.1, and for
which the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH in slot $n$ based
on
\- PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field values, or a value provided
by _sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1,_ for PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK
information in slot $n$ in response to PSFCH receptions;
\- time gap field in DCI format 3_0 for scheduling PSSCH transmissions with
associated PSFCH receptions;
\- time resource assignment in DCI format 3_0 for scheduling PSSCH
transmissions with associated PSFCH receptions;
\- a configured sidelink resource pool bitmap;
\- a value of a period of PSFCH resources provided in _sl-PSFCH-Period;_
\- a value of a minimum time gap provided in _sl-MinTimeGapPSFCH._
The set of PDCCH monitoring occasions for DCI format 3_0 for scheduling PSSCH
transmissions with associated PSFCH reception occasions is defined as the
PDCCH monitoring occasions in the active DL BWP of the configured serving
cell, indexed in ascending order of start time of the associated search space
sets. The cardinality of the set of PDCCH monitoring occasions defines a total
number $M$ of PDCCH monitoring occasions. A UE is not expected to receive a
DCI format 3_0 with CRC scrambled by SL-RNTI and a DCI format 3_0 with CRC
scrambled by SL-CS-RNTI for scheduling retransmission corresponding to a SL
configured grant Type 1 or a sidelink configured grant Type 2 simultaneously
in a same monitoring occasion.
A value of a counter sidelink assignment indicator (SAI) field in DCI format
3_0, excluding DCI format 3_0 for the SL configured grant Type 2 activation,
denotes an accumulative number of PDCCH monitoring occasions where PSSCH
transmissions with associated PSFCH receptions are scheduled, up to a current
PDCCH monitoring occasion, in ascending order of PDCCH monitoring occasion
index $m$, where $0 \leq m  if PDCCH monitoring occasion $m$ is before an active UL BWP change on the
> PCell
$m = M$;
else
> if there is a PSFCH reception occasion associated with a PSSCH transmission
> scheduled by a DCI format in PDCCH monitoring occasion $m$
if $V_{C - \text{SAI},m}^{\text{SL}} \leq V_{\text{temp}}$
> $j = j + 1$;
end if
> $V_{\text{temp}} = V_{C - \text{SAI},m}^{\text{SL}}$
>
> ${\widetilde{o}}_{4j + V_{C - SAI,m}^{\text{SL}} - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ = HARQ-

> \right}$
end if
end if
$m = m + 1$;
end while
> $O_{\text{ACK}} = 4 \cdot j + V_{\text{temp}}$
${\widetilde{o}}_{i}^{\text{ACK}} = NACK$ for any $i\ \in \left{
0,1,\ldots,O_{\text{ACK}} - 1 \right}\backslash V_{s}\ $
> if a SL configured grant Type 1 is configured for a UE, or a SL configured
> grant Type 2 is configured and activated for a UE, and the SL configured
> grant provides a grant for PSSCH transmissions, including the PSSCH
> transmission(s) associated with the corresponding activation DCI format 3_0,
> with PSFCH reception occasions in a slot $n - K_{1}$, where $K_{1}$ is the
> $k$ value for the SL configured grant as described in clause 16.5
$O_{\text{ACK}} = O_{\text{ACK}} + 1$;
> ${\widetilde{o}}_{O_{\text{ACK}} - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$= HARQ-ACK information

end if
If $O_{\text{ACK}} \leq 11$, the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK
information bits $n_{\text{HARQ} - \text{ACK}}$ for obtaining a transmission
power for a PUCCH, as described in clause 7.2.1, as
$$n_{\text{HARQ-ACK}} = \left( V_{\text{SAI},m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{SL}} -
U_{\text{SAI}} \right)\text{mod}4 + \sum_{m = 0}^{M -
1}N_{m}^{\text{received}} + N_{\text{CG}}$$
where
\- $V_{\text{S}\text{AI},m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{S}\text{L}}$ is a value of a
counter SAI field in a last DCI format 3_0, excluding the DCI format 3_0
activating a SL configured grant, scheduling PSSCH transmissions associated
with PSFCH reception occasions that the UE detects within the $M$ PDCCH
monitoring occasions
\- $V_{\text{S}\text{AI},m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{S}\text{L}} = 0$ if the UE
does not detect any DCI format 3_0, excluding the DCI format 3_0 activating a
SL configured grant, scheduling PSSCH transmissions associated with PSFCH
reception occasions in any of the $M$ PDCCH monitoring occasions
\- $U_{\text{S}\text{AI}}$ is a total number of DCI format 3_0, excluding the
DCI format 3_0 activating a SL configured grant, scheduling PSSCH
transmissions associated with PSFCH reception occasions, that the UE detects
within the $M$ PDCCH monitoring occasions. $U_{\text{S}\text{AI}} = 0$ if the
UE does not detect any DCI format 3_0, excluding the DCI format 3_0 activating
a SL configured grant, scheduling PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH
reception occasions in any of the $M$ PDCCH monitoring occasions
\- $N_{m}^{\text{received}}$ is a number of DCI format 3_0, excluding the DCI
format 3_0 activating a SL configured grant, scheduling PSSCH transmissions
with associated PSFCH reception occasions that the UE detects in PDCCH
monitoring occasion $m$
\- $N_{\text{CG}}$ is a number of SL configured grants for which the UE
transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH as for HARQ-ACK
information corresponding to PSFCH reception occasions associated with _PSSCH
transmissions_ scheduled by a dynamic grant within the $M$ PDCCH monitoring
occasions

#### 16.5.2.2 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink shared channel
If a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format without an SAI
field, then
_\- if the_ UE
_-_ has not received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for DCI format
3_0 for scheduling PSSCH with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions on any
serving cell, and
_-_ does not have HARQ-ACK information in response to a PSSCH transmission
with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions associated with a SL configured
grant to multiplex in the PUSCH, as described in clause 16.5.2.1 _,_
> the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission;
\- else, the UE generates and multiplexes in the PUSCH transmission the HARQ-
ACK codebook as described in clause 16.5.2.1.
If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
scheduled by a DCI format that includes a SAI field, the UE generates the
HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 16.5.2.1, with the following
modifications:
\- For the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause
16.5.2.1, after the completion of the $m$ loop, the UE sets $V_{\text{temp}} =
V_{\text{T-}\text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ where
$V_{\text{T-}\text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ is the value of the SAI field in the DCI
format according to Table 16.5.2.2-1.
If a UE
\- is scheduled for a PUSCH transmission by a DCI format that includes a SAI
field with value $V_{\text{T-SAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$, and
\- has not received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for PDCCH with
DCI format 3_0 for scheduling PSSCH with corresponding PSFCH reception
occasions on a serving cell, and
\- does not have HARQ-ACK information in response to PSFCH reception occasions
associated with a SL configured grant to multiplex in the PUSCH, as described
in clause 16.5.2.1,
the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission.

## 16.6 UE procedure for LTE sidelink transmission
If the UE detects a DCI format 3_1 with CRC scrambled by SL Semi-Persistent
Scheduling V-RNTI in slot $n$, the DCI format 3_1 activates or releases an LTE
sidelink SPS configuration that is indicated by a SL SPS configuration index
field [5, TS 38.212]. If the DCI format 3_1 activates an SL SPS configuration,
the UE procedure for transmitting a PSCCH and a PSSCH is as described in [13,
TS 36.213] except that a transmission starts no earlier than $T_{\text{DCI}} -
\frac{N_{\text{TA}}}{2} \times T_{C} \times 10^{3} + X + \left( 4 + m \right)$
ms, where $T_{\text{DCI}}$ is a start time of slot $n$, $N_{\text{TA}}$ and
$T_{C}$ are defined in [4, TS 38.211], $X$ is a value indicated by a Timing
offset field in DCI format 3_1, and $m$ is a value indicated by SL index field
in DCI format 3_1 if the SL index field is present; otherwise, $m = 0$.
## 16.7 Operation for in-device coexistence
If a UE would transmit or receive a first channel/signal using E-UTRA radio
access and a second channel/signal using NR radio access, when
\- the first channel/signal and the second channel/signal are time-division
multiplexed, and
\- the UE knows the frame indexes of the first channel/signal and the frame
indexes of the second channel/signal,
the UE transmits or receives each channel/signal so that the subframe boundary
of the second channel/signal is aligned with the subframe boundary of the
first channel/signal where the subframe boundary alignment is achieved by UE
implementation means.
