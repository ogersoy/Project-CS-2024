In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document covers the assessment of NR Base Station (BS) and
ancillary equipment in respect of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC).
The present document specifies the applicable requirements, procedures, test
conditions, performance assessment and performance criteria for NR base
stations and associated ancillary equipment in the following categories:
\- BS equipped with antenna connectors or _TAB connectors_ which are possible
to be terminated during EMC testing, meeting the _BS type 1-C_ and _BS type_
_1-H_ RF requirements of TS 38.104 [2], with conformance demonstrated by
compliance to TS 38.141-1 [3].
\- BS not equipped with antenna connectors nor _TAB connectors_ , i.e. with
antenna elements radiating during the EMC testing, meeting the _BS type 1-O_
and _BS type_ _2-O_ RF requirements of TS 38.104 [2], with conformance
demonstrated by compliance to TS 38.141-2 [4].
Technical requirements related to the antenna and TAB connectors are not
included in the present document. These are found in the relevant product
standards [2-4].
The environment classification used in the present document refers to the
residential, commercial and light industrial environment classification used
in IEC 61000‑6-1 [7], IEC 61000-6-3 [8] and IEC 61000-6-8 [33].
The EMC requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of
compatibility for apparatus at residential, commercial and light industrial
environments. The levels, however, do not cover extreme cases which may occur
in any location but with low probability of occurrence.

# 4 Test conditions
## 4.1 General
Requirements throughout the EMC specifications are in some cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges FR1 and
FR2 are defined in subclause 5.1 of TS 38.104 [2].
The equipment shall be tested in normal test environment defined in the
corresponding BS conformance testing specification TS 38.141-1 [3] for _BS
type 1-C_ and _BS type 1-H_ , or TS 38.141-2 [4] for _BS type 1-O_ and _BS
type 2-O_. The test conditions shall be recorded in the test report.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirements in the present
document apply for each supported _operating band_ unless otherwise stated.
_Operating bands_ shall be activated according to the test configuration in
subclause 4.5. Tests shall be performed relating to each type of _port_ and
all _operating bands_ shall be assessed during the tests.
The manufacturer shall declare the supported _operating band(s)_ according to
the list of NR _operating bands_ defined in TS 38.104 [2].
NOTE 1: NR _operating bands_ for _BS type 1-C_ and _BS type 1-H_ , are
declared by the manufacturer according to the declaration D.3 specified in TS
38.141-1 [3], table 4.6-1.
NOTE 2: NR _operating bands_ for _BS type 1-O_ and _BS type 2-O,_ are declared
by the manufacturer according to the declaration D.4 specified in TS 38.141-2
[4], table 4.6-1.
## 4.2 Arrangements for establishing a communication link
The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency shall be selected by setting the
NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) to an appropriate
number, as defined in TS 38.104 [2], clause 5.4.2.3.
A communication link shall be set up with a suitable test system capable of
evaluating the required performance criteria (hereafter called \"the test
system\") at the radio interface and _telecommunication port(s)_ (the NG
interface). The test system shall be located outside of the test environment.
When the EUT is required to be in the transmit/receive mode, the following
conditions shall be met:
\- For the _BS type 1-C_ and _BS type 1-H_ testing, the EUT shall be commanded
to operate at rated transmit power;
\- For the _BS type 1-O_ and _BS type 2-O_ testing, the EUT transmit power
shall be configured as stated in subclause 8.1 for emission test and subclause
9.1 for immunity test accordingly;
\- Adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the unwanted signal
on the measuring equipment;
\- The wanted input signal level shall be set to a level where the performance
is not limited by the receiver noise floor or strong signal effects.
NOTE: 15 dB above the conducted reference sensitivity level has been used as
an example of wanted input signal level in legacy 3GPP EMC specifications for
establishing a communication link.
For immunity tests clause 4.3 shall apply and the conditions shall be as
follows.
## 4.3 Narrow band responses on receivers
Responses on receivers or duplex transceivers occurring during the immunity
test at discrete frequencies which are narrow band responses (spurious
responses), are identified by the following method:
\- if during an immunity test the quantity being monitored goes outside the
specified tolerances (clause 6), it is necessary to establish whether the
deviation is due to a narrow band response or to a wide band (EMC) phenomenon.
Therefore, the test shall be repeated with the unwanted signal frequency
increased, and then decreased by 2 x BW~Channel~ MHz, where BW~Channel~ is the
channel bandwidth as defined in TS 38.104 [2], clause 5.3;
\- if the deviation disappears in either one or both of the above MHz offset
cases, then the response is considered as a narrow band response;
\- if the deviation does not disappear, this may be due to the fact that the
offset has made the frequency of the unwanted signal correspond to the
frequency of another narrow band response. Under these circumstances the
procedure is repeated with the increase and decrease of the frequency of the
unwanted signal set to 2.5 x BW~Channel~ MHz;
\- if the deviation does not disappear with the increased and/or decreased
frequency, the phenomenon is considered wide band and therefore an EMC problem
and the equipment fails the test.
For immunity test narrow band responses are disregarded.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, all supported _operating bands_ shall
be considered for narrowband responses.
## 4.4 Exclusion bands
### 4.4.1 Transmitter exclusion band
The _transmitter exclusion band_ for BS is the frequency range over which no
tests of radiated immunity of a transmitter are made. The _transmitter
exclusion band only applies to BS type 1-O._
The _transmitter exclusion band_ is defined as:
F~DL,low~ -- Δf~OBUE~\
90 % instead of throughput > 95 %). After each test case BS shall operate as
intended with no loss of user control function, stored data and the
communication link shall be maintained.

## 6.2 Performance criteria for transient phenomena for BS
At the conclusion of the total test (comprising the series of individual
exposures to transient phenomena) the EUT shall operate as intended with no
user noticeable loss of control functions or stored data. At the conclusion of
each exposure the EUT shall operate with no user noticeable loss of the
communication link. The channel bandwidth, sub-carrier spacing and bearer
information data rate should be chosen based on manufacturers declaration and
defined according to table 6.1-1 and table 6.1-2.
Table 6.2-1: Void
Table 6.2-2: Void
## 6.3 Performance criteria for continuous phenomena for Ancillary equipment
The apparatus shall continue to operate as intended during and after the test.
No degradation of performance or loss of function is allowed below the
performance level specified by the manufacturer, when the apparatus is used as
intended. The performance level may be replaced by a permissible performance
loss. If the minimum performance level or the permissible performance loss is
not specified by the manufacturer, either of these may be derived from the
product description and documentation and what the user may reasonably expect
from the apparatus if used as intended.
## 6.4 Performance criteria for transient phenomena for Ancillary equipment
The apparatus shall continue to operate as intended after the test. No
degradation of performance or loss of function is allowed below the
performance level specified by the manufacturer, when the apparatus is used as
intended. The performance level may be replaced by a permissible performance
loss. During the test, degradation of performance is however allowed. If the
minimum performance level or the permissible performance loss is not specified
by the manufacturer, either of these may be derived from the product
description and documentation and what the user may reasonably expect from the
apparatus if used as intended.

\- The equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions as specified in
the functional standards;
\- The test configuration shall be as close to normal intended use as
possible;
\- If the equipment is part of a system, or can be connected to ancillary
equipment, then it shall be acceptable to test the equipment while connected
to the minimum configuration of _ancillary equipment_ necessary to exercise
the _port_ s;
\- If the equipment has a large number of _port_ s, then a sufficient number
shall be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and to ensure that
all the different types of termination are tested;
\- The test conditions, test configuration and mode of operation shall be
recorded in the test report;
\- _Port_ s which in normal operation are connected shall be connected to an

## 8.2 Radiated emission
### 8.2.1 Radiated emission, BS
This test is applicable to _BS type 1-C_ and _BS type 1-H_. This test shall be
performed on a representative configuration of BS.
For _BS type 1-O_ and _BS type 2-O_ , the radiated emission is covered by
radiated spurious emission requirement in TS 38.104 [2], conforming to the
test requirement in TS 38.141-2 [4].
#### 8.2.1.1 Definition
This test assesses the ability of BS to limit unwanted emission from the
_enclosure port_.
#### 8.2.1.2 Test method
a) A test site fulfilling the requirements of ITU-R SM.329 [24] shall be used.
The BS shall be placed on a non-conducting support and shall be operated from
a power source via a RF filter to avoid radiation from the power leads. One of
the following two alternative measurement methods shall be used:
1) Field strength method measurement
The test method shall be in accordance with CISPR 32 [11]. The field strength
measurements shall be performed on a test site that is validated according to
the methods and requirements of CISPR 16-1-4 [30].
Unless otherwise stated, measurements are conducted at 3 m or 10 m on an open
area test site (OATS) or semi anechoic chamber (SAC) for frequencies up to 1
GHz, or at 3 m on a free space open area test site (FSOATS) or fully-anechoic
room (FAR) for frequencies above 1 GHz. Unless otherwise stated, all
measurements are done with RMS detector and with the -3 dB bandwidth of the
measuring filter equal to the reference bandwidth in table 8.2.1.3-1.
NOTE 1: Test site validation methods for radiated emissions tests are defined
in CISPR 16-1-4 [30], clause 6 and 7. Examples of test site validation methods
are listed below:
\- 30 - 1000 MHz frequency range: Normalized Site Attenuation (NSA), Reference
Site Method (RSM).
\- 1 - 18 GHz frequency range: S~VSWR~ standard test procedure, S~VSWR~
reciprocal test procedure.
2) Substitution method measurement (also called a substitution method)
Mean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test antenna
and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser). At each frequency at which
a component is detected, the BS shall be rotated and the height of the test
antenna adjusted to obtain maximum response, and the effective radiated power
(e.r.p.) of that component determined by a substitution measurement. The
measurement shall be repeated with the test antenna in the orthogonal
polarization plane. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done as mean
power (RMS).
NOTE 2: Effective radiated power (e.r.p.) refers to the radiation of a half
wave tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a constant
difference of 2.15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p, as defined in ITU-R SM.329
annex 1 [24].
e.r.p. (dBm) = EIRP (dBm) − 2.15
b) The BS shall transmit with maximum power declared by the manufacturer with
all transmitters active. Set the base station to transmit a signal as stated
in clause 4.5.
c) The received power shall be measured over the frequency range from 30 MHz
to F~DL,low~ - Δf~OBUE~ and from F~DL,high~ + Δf~OBUE~ up to 12750 MHz. For
some _operating bands_ , the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to
comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink _operating band_ , as
specified in ITU-R SM.329 [24].The video bandwidth shall be approximately
three times the resolution bandwidth. If this video bandwidth is not available
on the measuring receiver, it shall be the maximum available and at least 1
MHz. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done as mean power (RMS).
#### 8.2.1.3 Limits
The frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed transitions
of the limits between the requirements for out of band emissions and spurious
emissions are based on ITU-R Recommendations SM.329 [24] and SM.1539 [26].
The _BS type 1-C_ and _BS type 1-H_ shall meet the limits below:

NOTE: If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in table 8.2.1.4-1, this equipment can still be
used, provided that an adjustment is made follows:
Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in
table 8.2.1.4-1 is used to tighten the test requirements, i.e. making the test
harder to pass.
This procedure will ensure that a test system not compliant with table
8.2.1.4-1 does not increase the probability of passing an EUT that would
otherwise have failed a test if a test system compliant with table 8.2.1.4-1
had been used.
### 8.2.2 Radiated emission, ancillary equipment
This test is only applicable to _ancillary equipment_ not incorporated in the
radio equipment and intended to be measured on a stand-alone basis, as
declared by the manufacturer. This test shall be performed on a representative
configuration of the _ancillary equipment_.
This test is not applicable for _ancillary equipment_ incorporated in the
radio equipment, or for _ancillary equipment_ intended to be measured in
combination with the radio equipment. In these cases, the requirements of the
relevant product standard for the effective use of the radio spectrum shall
apply.
#### 8.2.2.1 Definition
This test assesses the ability of _ancillary equipment_ to limit unwanted
emission from the _enclosure port_.
#### 8.2.2.2 Test method
The test method shall be in accordance with CISPR 32 [11].
#### 8.2.2.3 Limits
The _ancillary equipment_ shall meet the limits according to CISPR 32 [11]

This test is applicable to equipment which may have DC cables longer than 3 m.
If the DC power cable of the radio equipment is intended to be less than 3 m
in length, and intended only for direct connection to a dedicated AC to DC
power supply, then the measurement shall be performed only on the AC power
input of that power supply as specified in clause 8.4.

interface. In case of looping is used care have to be taken that the
throughput information doesn\'t change due to looping;
\- for NR BS capable of multi-band operation, communication links shall be
established in such a way that all _operating band_(s) are activated during
the test according to the applicable test configurations in clause 4.5.
Performance assessment may be done separately for each _operating band_.

## 9.2 RF electromagnetic field (80 MHz to 6000 MHz)
The test shall be performed on a representative configuration of the
equipment, the associated _ancillary equipment_ , or representative
configuration of the combination of radio and _ancillary equipment_.
### 9.2.1 Definition
This test assesses the ability of radio equipment and _ancillary equipment_ to
operate as intended in the presence of a radio frequency electromagnetic field
disturbance at the enclosure.
### 9.2.2 Test method and level
The test method shall be in accordance with IEC 61000‑4‑3 [18], which
specifies test methodology based on anechoic chamber. The use of reverberation
chamber test method according to IEC 61000-4-21 [29], clause 6.1 and Annex D
as alternative method is allowed.
The following requirements shall apply:
\- The test level shall be 3 V/m amplitude modulated to a depth of 80 % by a
sinusoidal audio signal of 1 kHz;
\- The stepped frequency increments shall be 1 % of the momentary frequency;
\- The test shall be performed over the frequency range 80 MHz - 6000 MHz;
with the exception of the exclusion band for receivers (see clause 4.4);
\- Responses in stand-alone receivers or receivers which are part of
transceivers occurring at discrete frequencies which are narrow band
responses, shall be disregarded, see clause 4.3;
\- The frequencies selected during the test shall be recorded in the test
report.
\- For the test method in accordance with IEC 61000-4-3[18], the _spatial
exclusion zone_ can be chosen to protect the base station receiver. For the
frequency range above 690 MHz (according to ETSI EN 301 489-50 [28]), the EMC
RF electromagnetic field immunity requirement with a level of 10 V/m applies
on the non-radiating faces of the _BS type 1-O_ or _BS type 2-O,_ as depicted
on figure 9.2.2-1.
NOTE: Depending on the BS implementation, application of the spatial exclusion
to all radiating faces of the BS may not allow proper execution of the RI
testing. In such cases, to protect the _BS type 1-O_ or _BS type 2-O_
receiver(s), exclusion bands shall be considered, as in table 4.4.2-1.
