This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present specifies document the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR Integrated access and backhaul: _IAB type 1-H_
, _IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type 2-O_. These have been derived from, and are
consistent with the radiated requirements for _IAB type 1-H_ , _IAB type 1-O_
and _IAB type 2-O_ in BS specification defined in TS 38.174 [2].
A _IAB type 1-H_ has both conducted and radiated requirements, so it requires
compliance to the applicable requirements of the present document and TS
38.176-1 [3].
_IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type 2-O_ have only radiated requirements, so they
require compliance to the present document only.

# 4 General radiated test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in TS 38.176-2
(the present document), i.e. to all radiated tests defined in FR1 for _IAB
type 1-H_ , _IAB type 1-O_ and radiated tests defined in FR2 for _IAB type
2-O_. The frequency ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of TS 38.174
[2].
The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.174 [2]. Test Tolerances for the
radiated test requirements (TT~OTA~) explicitly stated in the present document
are given in annex C.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. Test Tolerances are
used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.
The requirements are classified according to spatial characteristics as shown
in table 4.1.1-1 and table 4.1.1-2.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of OTA Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the OTA Test System is specified below
for each radiated test defined explicitly in the present specification, where
appropriate.
The OTA Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the EUT to be measured with an
uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and
uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level of 95
%, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For details on measurement uncertainty budget calculation, OTA measurement
methodology description (including calibration and measurement stage for each
test range), MU budget format and its contributions, refer to TR 37.941 [25].
#### 4.1.2.2 Measurement of transmitter
The maximum OTA Test System uncertainty for OTA transmitter tests minimum
requirements are given in tables 4.1.2.2-1 and 4.1.2.2-2. Details for
derivation of OTA Test System uncertainty are given in corresponding clauses
in TR 37.941 [25].
Table 4.1.2.2-1: Maximum OTA Test System uncertainty for FR1 OTA transmitter

physical channel parameters for IAB-MT-FR2-TM3.1 are defined in table
4.9.2.3.1-1 with all QPSK PUSCH PRBs replaced with selected modulation order
PUSCH PRBs according to the corresponding test procedure.
##### 4.9.2.3.4 FR2 test model 3.1a (IAB-MT-FR2-TM3.1a)

\- Output power dynamics
\- Total power dynamic range (upper TX PSD power limit at max power with all
256QAM PRBs allocated)
\- Transmitted signal quality
\- Frequency error (at max power)

physical channel parameters for IAB-MT-FR2-TM3.1a shall be defined in table
4.9.2.3.1-1 with all QPSK PUSCH PRBs replaced by 256QAM.
#### 4.9.2.3 Data content of physical channels and signals for IAB-MT-FR2-TM
Randomisation of the data content is obtained by utilizing a PN sequence
generator and the length-31 Gold sequence scrambling of TS 38.211 [7], clause
5.2.1 which is invoked by all physical channels prior to modulation and
mapping to the RE grid.
Initialization of the scrambler and RE-mappers as defined in TS 38.211 [7] use
the following additional parameters:
\- $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 1$
\- _q_ = 0 (single code word)
\- Rank 1, single layer
##### 4.9.2.3.1 PUSCH

\- $n_{\text{SCID}} = 0$
\- DM-RS mapping according to TS 38.211 [7], clause 6.4.1.1.3 with parameters
listed in table 4.9.2.2-3.
\- For NR-IAB-MT-FR2-TM PT-RS sequence generation according to TS 38.211 [7],
clause 6.4.1.2.1, with parameters listed in table 4.9.2.2-3.
\- For NR-IAB-MT-FR2-TM PT-RS mapping according to TS 38.211 [7], clause
6.4.1.2.2, with parameters listed in table 4.9.2.2-3.
## 4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
A spectrum allocation where an IAB operates can either be contiguous or non-
contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for IAB configured for both _contiguous spectrum_
operation and _non-contiguous spectrum_ operation.
For IAB operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , some requirements apply both
at the _IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges_ or _IAB-MT RF bandwidth edges_ and inside
the _sub-block gaps_. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits
apply relative to the _IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges_ or _IAB-MT RF bandwidth
edges_ and the _sub-block_ edges respectively.
### 4.11 Requirements for IAB capable of multi-band operation
For _multi-band_ _RIB_ , the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7 apply
separately to each supported _operating band_ unless otherwise stated. For
some requirements, it is explicitly stated that specific additions or
exclusions to the requirement apply at _multi-band RIB(s)_ as detailed in the
requirement clause.
_IAB type 1-O_ may be capable of supporting operation in multiple _operating
bands_ with one of the following implementations at the _radiated interface
boundary_ :
\- All RIBs are _single-band RIBs_.
\- All RIBs are _multi-band_ _RIBs_.
\- A combination of single-band _RIBs_ and _multi-band RIBs_ provides support
of the _IAB type 1-O_ capability of operation in multiple _operating bands_.
For _multi-band RIBs_ supporting the bands for TDD, the RF requirements in the
present specification assume no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between
the bands.
## 4.12 Co-location requirements
### 4.12.1 General
Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming the _IAB
type 1-O_ is co-located with another BS or IAB of the same base station class.
They ensure that both co-located systems can operate with minimal degradation
to each other.
The co-location requirements in table 4.12.1-1 rely on a _co-location
reference antenna_ used to mimic an IAB to base station or IAB co-location
scenario.
Table 4.12.1-1: Co-location requirements
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | **Clause | * |** Co-location | **Type** | | number**| *Requirement** | reference | | | | | antenna | | | | | operation** | | +================+================+================+================+ | 6.5 | OTA transmit | Measure | Mandatory | | | ON/OFF power | emission | | | | for FR1 | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 6.7.5.3 | OTA spurious | Measure | Optional based | | | emission: | emission | on declaration | | 6.7.5.5 | Protection of | | | | | the IAB | | | | | receiver of | | | | | own or | | | | | different BS | | | | | and IAB | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | | OTA spurious | | | | | emission: | | | | | Co-location | | | | | with other | | | | | base stations | | | | | and IAB-Nodes | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 6.8 | OTA | Inject the | Mandatory | | | transmitter | interferer | | | | i | signal | | | | ntermodulation | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 7.6 | OTA | Inject the | Optional based | | | out-of-band | interferer | on declaration | | | blocking: | signal | | | | Co-location | | | | | with other | | | | | base stations | | | | | or IAB-Nodes | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
The OTA transmit ON/OFF power requirement and OTA transmitter intermodulation
requirement are mandatory requirements where the test requirement is derived
using the _co-location reference antenna_ , which represents the worst-case
scenario.
The _co-location reference antenna_ is defined in TS 38.174 [2].
### 4.12.2 Co-location test antenna
#### 4.12.2.1 General
Co-location requirements are specified as power levels into or out of the
conducted interface of the _co-location reference antenna_. For conformance
testing the requirements are translated to the input or output of a _co-
location test antenna_ (CLTA).
A CLTA is a practical antenna which can be used to test conformance to the co-
location requirements.
#### 4.12.2.2 Co-location test antenna characteristics
A _co-location test antenna_ is a practical passive antenna that is used for
conformance testing of the co-location requirements and is based on the
definition of the _co-location reference antenna_. A CLTA shall comply with
the requirements specified in table 4.12.2.2-1.
Translation of the requirements to other test antennas are not precluded but
suitable translations between the co-location reference antenna and test
antenna must be provided to demonstrate that the method is within the
specified MU.
NOTE: The currently defined CLTAs are suitable for testing _IAB type 1-O_
implemented with a planar antenna array. The method for testing IAB with other
antenna array implementations is not covered by the present release of the
present document.

#### 4.12.2.3 Co-location test antenna alignment
The alignment between the NR IAB under test and the _co-location test antenna_
is described in table 4.12.2.3-1 and figure 4.12.2.3-1. The same physical
alignment applies to in-band and out-of-band co-location requirements.

## 4.13 Test efficiency optimization
When manufacture declares the same RF implementation for IAB-MT and IAB-DU
(D.IAB-1) and the declarations in table 4.13-1 are the same for IAB-DU and
IAB-MT, it is sufficient to test only IAB-MT or IAB-DU with the test
requirement applicability according to table 4.13-2 for Tx requirements and
table 4.13-3 for Rx requirements.
For _IAB type 1-H_ the test efficiency optimization for radiated requirements
apply only for radiated transmit power and OTA sensitivity. Test efficiency
optimization for conducted requirements is defined in TS 38.176-1 [3].
For _IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type 2-O_ it is required that the DUT selection
between requirements follows following rules:
\- out of radiated transmit power, OTA modulation quality and OTA frequency
error, IAB-DU and IAB-MT are required to be the DUT at least once,
\- out of OTA ACLR, OTA operating band unwanted emissions and OTA transmitter
general spurious emissions, are required to be the DUT at least once,
\- out of OTA reference sensitivity, OTA ACS, OTA receiver intermodulation,
IAB-DU and IAB-MT are required to be the DUT at least once.
In some cases, the test requirements are the same but the MU for the IAB-MT is
larger than for the IAB-DU. When the test efficiency optimization is
applicable for such cases, the lower MU value should be used.

core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.
**X.3 Test purpose**
This clause defines the purpose of the test.
**X.4 Method of test**
**X.4.1 General**
In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial conditions. In
such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and test procedures can be
applied are stated here. In the case only one test procedure is applicable,
that is stated here.
**X.4.2y First test method**
**X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions**

environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement set-up.
**X.4.2y.2 Procedure**
This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and provides
further details of the test definition like domain (e.g. frequency-span),
range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and algorithms (e.g. averaging). The
procedure may comprise data processing of the measurement result before
comparison with the test requirement (e.g. average result from several

## 4.15 Reference coordinate system
Radiated requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic characteristics
(e.g. EIRP and EIS) at certain angles with respect to the base station. To be
able to declare radiated characteristics part of radiated requirements a
reference coordinate system is required. The reference coordinate system is
should be associated to an identifiable physical feature on the base station
enclosure. The location of the origin and the orientation of the reference
coordinate system are for the base station manufacturer to declare.
The reference coordinate system is created of a Cartesian coordinate system
with rectangular axis (x** _,_** y** _,_** z) and spherical angles (θ, φ) as
showed in figure 4.15-1.
{width="3.9375in" height="4.069444444444445in"}
Figure 4.15-1: Reference coordinate system
φ is the angle in the x/y plane, between the x-axis and the projection of the
radiating vector onto the x/y plane and is defined between -180° and +180°,
inclusive. θ is the angle between the projection of the vector in the x**
_/_** y plane and the radiating vector and is defined between -90° and +90°,
inclusive. Note that θ is defined as positive along the down-tilt angle.
# 5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
For the IAB operation in NR operating bands specification, their channel
bandwidth configurations, channel spacing and raster, as well as
synchronization raster specification, refer to TS 38.174 [2], clause 5 and its
relevant clauses.
For radiated testing purposes in the present document, FR1 and FR2 operating
bands are considered.
# 6 Radiated transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. IAB
configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.
If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (D.13, D.14), only a
representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate conformance.
## 6.2 Radiated transmit power
### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability
_IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-H, IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-O_ and _IAB-DU and IAB-
MT type 2-O_ are declared to support one or more beams, as per manufacturer\'s
declarations. Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a
declared beam at a specific _beam peak direction_. Declarations are done for
IAB-DU and IAB-MT separately.
For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam identity,
_reference beam direction pair_ , beamwidth, _rated beam EIRP_ , _OTA peak
directions set_ , the _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering
directions and their associated _rated beam EIRP_ and beamwidth(s).
For a declared beam and _beam direction pair_ , the _rated beam EIRP_ level is
the maximum power that the IAB-DU or IAB-MT is declared to radiate at the
associated _beam peak direction_ during the _transmitter ON period_.
For each _beam peak direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within
the _OTA peak directions set_ , a specific _rated beam EIRP_ level may be
claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as
described below. _Rated beam EIRP_ is only required to be declared for the
_beam direction pairs_ subject to conformance testing.
NOTE 1: _OTA peak directions set_ is set of _beam peak directions_ for which
the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The _beam peak
directions_ are related to a corresponding contiguous range or discrete list
of _beam centre directions_ by the _beam direction pairs_ included in the set.
NOTE 2: A _beam direction pair_ is data set consisting of the _beam centre
direction_ and the related _beam peak direction._
NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer for
verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the manufacturer to
the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment and is not subject to
formal conformance testing.
> For _operating bands_ where the supported _fractional bandwidth_ (FBW) is
> larger than 6%, two rated carrier EIRP may be declared by manufacturer:
\- P~rated,c,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and
\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.
For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated carrier EIRP is:
\- P~rated,c,FBWlow,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \ NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply conditions also test extreme
> temperatures.
#### 6.2.4.2 Procedure
For normal test environment conditions in OTA domain, the test procedure is as
follows:
> 1) Place the IAB at the positioner.
>
> 2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of
> the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be tested
> aligns with the test antenna.
>
> 4) Configure the _beam peak direction_ of the IAB according to the declared
> _beam direction pair_.
>
> 5) Set the IAB to transmit according to the applicable test configuration in
> clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2.
>
> For a IAB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation use
> the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting
> specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in
> clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.
>
> 6) Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and
> calculate total radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_
> as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.
>
> 7) Test steps 3 to 6 are repeated for all declared beams (D.3) and their
> reference _beam direction pairs_ and _maximum steering directions_ (D.8 and
> D.10).
For multi-band capable IAB and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved _operating band_ where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.
For extreme conditions tests the methods in annex B.7 may be used.
### 6.2.5 Test requirement
#### 6.2.5.1 IAB-DU
For each declared conformance _beam direction pair_ , the EIRP measurement
results in clause 6.2.4.2 shall remain within the values provided in table
6.2.5.1-1, relative to the manufacturer\'s declared rated beam EIRP (D.11)
value:

> specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in
> clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.
>
> 5) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be tested
> aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be
> performed (see annex I).
>
> 6) Measure the radiated power for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted
> p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular beam
> direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.
>
> If the test chamber is a reverberation chamber measure TRP directly.
>
> 7) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement
> grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).
>
> 8) Calculate TRP using the EIRP measurements.
For _multi-band RIBs_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carriers activated in the other band.
### 6.3.5 Test requirement
#### 6.3.5.1 _IAB type 1-O_
The final TRP measurement result in clause 6.3.4.2 shall remain:
\- within +3.4 dB and -3.4 dB of the manufacturer\'s declared _rated carrier
TRP_ P~rated,c,TRP~ carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0 GHz;
\- within +3.5 dB and --3.5 dB of the manufacturer\'s declared _rated carrier
TRP_ P~rated,c,TRP~ for carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \ NOTE: The upper limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the IAB-DU
> maximum carrier EIRP (P~max,c,EIRP~) when transmitting on all RBs. The lower
> limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the average EIRP for single RB
> transmission in the same direction using the same beam. The OFDM symbols
> shall carry PDSCH and not contain PDCCH, RS or SSB.

### 6.6.4 OTA time alignment error
#### 6.6.4.1 Definition and applicability
For IAB-DU, this requirement shall apply to frame timing in MIMO transmission,
carrier aggregation and their combinations. There\'s no time alignment error
requirement for IAB-MT.
Frames of the NR signals present in the radiated domain are not perfectly
aligned in time. In relation to each other, the RF signals present in the
radiated domain may experience certain timing differences.
For a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode, the
OTA Time Alignment Error (OTA TAE) is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two different NR signals. The OTA time alignment error requirement
is defined as a _directional requirement_ at the RIB and shall be met within
the _OTA coverage range._
#### 6.6.4.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _IAB-DU type 1-O_ is in TS 38.174 [2], clause
9.6.3.1.
The minimum requirement for _IAB-DU type 2-O_ is in TS 38.174 [2], clause
9.6.3.1.
#### 6.6.4.3 Test purpose
To verify that the OTA time alignment error is within the limit specified by
the minimum requirement.
#### 6.6.4.4 Method of test
##### 6.6.4.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

\- B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see clause
4.9.1.
Directions to be tested: OTA coverage range reference direction (D.35).
Polarizations to be tested: For dual polarized systems the requirement shall
be tested and met considering both polarisations. If the measurement antenna
does not support dual polarization, time alignment error shall be measured
under the condition that measurement antenna is aligned between the IAB-DU
polarisations such that it receives half the power from each polarisation.

## 6.7 OTA unwanted emissions
### 6.7.1 General
Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 [10]. In ITU terminology,
out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the _channel
bandwidth_ resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the
transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions
which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission,
parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion
products, but exclude out of band emissions.
The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the _IAB-MT type 1-O. IAB-DU
type 1-O, IAB-DU type 1-O_ and _IAB-DU type 2-O_ transmitter is specified both
in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating band
unwanted emissions (OBUE). OTA Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency
range are limited by an OTA spurious emissions requirement.
The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from the
_operating band_ edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table
6.7.1-1 _IAB-DU type 1-O_ and _type 2-O_ and in table 6.7.1-2 _IAB-MT type
1-O_ and _type 2-O_ for NR _operating bands_.

>
> 2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of
> the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be tested
> aligns with the test antenna..
>
> 4) Configure the beam peak direction of the IAB according to the declared
> beam direction pair.
>
> 5) Set the IAB to transmit signal.
>
> 6) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at least
> the number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in table
> 6.7.2.4.2-1 and table 6.7.2.4.2-2. The selected resolution bandwidth (RBW)
> filter of the analyser shall be 30 kHz or less.
NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyser will not have any effect on
the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW power are the same
as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected to have the Rayleigh
distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In any case where the
statistics are not the same, though, the detection mode is power responding.
There are at least two ways to be power responding. The spectrum analyser can
be set to \"sample\" detection, with its video bandwidth setting at least
three times its RBW setting. Or the analyser may be set to respond to the
average of the power (root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement
cell.

### 6.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)
#### 6.7.3.1 Definition and applicability
OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean
power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The measured power is TRP.
The requirement shall be applied per RIB during the _transmitter ON period_.
#### 6.7.3.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-MT type 1-O_ is in TS
38.174 [2], clause 9.7.3.2.
The minimum requirement for _IAB-DU type 2-O and Wide Area IAB-MT type 2-O_ is
in TS 38.174 [2], clause 9.7.3.3.
#### 6.7.3.3 Test purpose
To verify that the OTA adjacent channel leakage ratio requirement shall be met
as specified by the minimum requirement.
#### 6.7.3.4 Method of test
##### 6.7.3.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B and T; see clause 4.9.1.
_IAB RF Bandwidth_ positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:
\- B~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;
\- B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see clause
4.9.1.
Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be
set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I) as long as the
required TRP level is achieved.
##### 6.7.3.4.2 Procedure
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power
measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to measure TRP is
to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber if so follow steps
1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.
> 1) Place the IAB at the positioner.
>
> 2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of
> the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:
>
> \- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.7.3.5.
>
> \- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.
>
> 4) For single carrier operation, set the IAB to transmit according to the

>
> 5) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be tested
> aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be
> performed (see annex I).
>
> 6) Measure the absolute power of the assigned channel frequency and the
> (adjacent channel frequency).
>
> 7) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement
> grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex I).
>
> 8) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ for the absolute total radiated power of the
> wanted channel and the adjacent channel using the measurements made in Step
> 7.
>
> 9) Calculate relative ACLR estimate.
NOTE 1: ACLR is calculated by the ratio of the absolute TRP of the assigned
channel frequency and the absolute TRP of the adjacent frequency channel.

> frequency as specified in table 6.7.3.5.1-1 for _IAB type 1-O_ or table
> 6.7.3.5.2-1for _IAB type 2-O_ respectively. In multiple carrier case only
> offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier frequency
> used shall be measured.
>
> 11) For the OTA ACLR requirement applied inside sub-block gap for non-
> contiguous spectrum operation or inside _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ for multi-
> band operation:
>
> a) Measure OTA ACLR inside sub-block gap or _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ , if
> applicable.
>
> b) Measure OTA CACLR inside sub-block gap or _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ , if

>
> 12) Repeat the test with the channel set-up using IAB- FR1-TM1.2 defined in
> clause 4.9.2 in TS 38.176-1 [3] for _IAB type 1-O_.
In addition, for _multi-band RIB_ , the following steps shall apply:
> 13) For _IAB type 1-O_ and _multi-band RIB_ and single band tests, repeat
> the steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
> test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
#### 6.7.3.5 Test requirements
##### 6.7.3.5.1 _IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-MT type 1-O_
For the OTA ACLR requirement either the OTA ACLR limits in tables
6.7.3.5.1-1/3 or the OTA ACLR absolute limits in table 6.7.3.5.1-2 shall
apply, whichever is less stringent. The OTA CACLR limits in table 6.7.3.5.1-4
or the OTA CACLR absolute limits in table 6.7.3.5.1-5 shall apply, whichever
is less stringent.
The CACLR in a sub-block gap and Inter RF Bandwidth gap is the ratio of:
a) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block gap or
the Inter RF Bandwidth gap, and
b) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to one of
the respective sub-block edges or Base Station RF Bandwidth edges.
The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in table
6.7.3.5.1-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in table
6.7.3.5.1-6.
For operation in paired and unpaired spectrum, the OTA ACLR measurement result
shall not be less than the OTA ACLR limit specified in table 6.7.3.5.1-1.

#### 6.7.5.3 Void
#### 6.7.5.4 Additional spurious emissions requirements
##### 6.7.5.4.1 Definition and applicability
These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems operating in
frequency ranges other than the IAB downlink operating band. The limits may
apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the IAB-Node, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR operating band. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or
under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by
local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the
present document is given in clause 4.4.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, NR, etc.).
The requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
_operating band_.
All additional spurious requirements are TRP unless otherwise stated.
##### 6.7.5.4.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement for _IAB type 1-O_ is specified in TS 38.174 [2],
clause 9.7.5.2.3.
The minimum requirement for _IAB type 2-O_ is specified in TS 38.174 [2],
clause 9.7.5.3.3.
##### 6.7.5.4.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the radiated spurious emissions from the IAB at
the RIB are within the specified additional spurious emissions requirements.
##### 6.7.5.4.4 Method of test

Directions to be tested: As the requirements are TRP the beam pattern(s) may
be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I) as long as
the required TRP level is achieved.
##### 6.7.5.4.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-9 .H6}
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power
measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to measure TRP is
to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber if so follow steps
1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10.
> 1) Place the IAB-Node at the positioner.
>
> 2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of
> the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
> conditions in clause 6.7.5.4.5.
>
> 4) The measurement device characteristics shall be:
\- Detection mode: True RMS.
> 5) Set the IAB-Node to transmit:
\- For RIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set the
RIB to transmit a signal according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model in clause 4.9.2 (IAB-DU-
FR1-TM1.1 for _IAB-DU type 1-O, IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1_ for _IAB-MT type 1-O, IAB-
DU-FR2-TM1.1_ for _IAB-DU type 2-O_ or IAB-MT-FR2-TM1.1 for _IAB-MT type
2-O_), at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power P~rated,c,TRP~.
\- For a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation, set
the RIB to transmit according to IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 for _IAB-DU type 1-O, IAB-
MT-FR1-TM1.1_ for _IAB-MT type 1-O, IAB-DU-FR2-TM1.1_ for _IAB-DU type 2-O_ or
IAB-MT-FR2-TM1.1 for _IAB-MT type 2-O_ in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power
setting specified in clause 4.7.2 and 4.8.
> 6) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be tested
> aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be
> performed (see annex I).
>
> 7) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
> measurement bandwidth.
>
> 8) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement
> grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).
NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.
NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be done in
any order.
> 9) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
> measurements.
In addition, for _multi-band RIB(s)_ , the following steps shall apply:
> 10) For _multi-band RIBs_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
> involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
> apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
##### 6.7.5.4.5 Test requirement
##### 6.7.5.4.5.1 Test requirement for _IAB type 1-O_ {#test-requirement-for-
iab-type-1-o-1 .H6}
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the test limits in table
6.7.5.4.5-1 for a IAB where requirements for co-existence with the system
listed in the first column apply. For a _multi-band RIB_ , the exclusions and
conditions in the Note column of table 6.7.5.4.5-1 apply for each supported
_operating band_.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause the co-
existence requirements in table 6.7.5.4.5.1-1do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~
frequency range immediately outside the downlink _operating band_ (see table
5.2-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by
local or regional requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.7.5.4.5.1-1 assumes that two _operating bands_ , where the
frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
#### 6.7.5.5 Co-location requirements
##### 6.7.5.5.1 Definition and applicability
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS, IAB-DU or
IAB-MT receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD,
UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU or IAB-MT are co-located with IAB-MT and/or
IAB-DU.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with same class.
##### 6.7.5.5.2 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirement for _IAB type 1-O_ is defined in TS 38.174 [2], clause
9.7.5.2.
##### 6.7.5.5.3 Test purpose
For OTA co-locate spurious emission, the test purpose is to verify that the
emission is within the specified requirement limits at the CLTA conducted
output(s).
##### 6.7.5.5.4 Method of test
##### 6.7.5.5.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-14 .H6}
Test environment: normal; see clause B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.
_IAB RF Bandwidth_ positions to be tested for multi-carrier:
\- M~RFBW~ in _single-band RIB_ , see clause 4.9.1;
\- B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in _multi-band RIB_ , see clause
4.9.1.
In addition, for _multi-band RIB_ :
\- For B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~, emission testing above the highest operating band
may be omitted.
\- For B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~, emission testing below the lowest operating band may
be omitted.
Directions to be tested: The FR1 requirement is specified as co-location
requirement. For general description of co-location requirements, refer to
clause 4.12.
The co-location spurious emission is measured at the CLTA conducted output(s).
##### 6.7.5.5.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-10 .H6}
> 1) Select and place the IAB-Node and CLTA as described in clause 4.12, with
> parameters as specified in table 4.12.2.2-1 and table 4.12.2.3-1.
>
> 2) Several CLTAs might be required to cover the whole co-location spurious
> emission frequency ranges.
>
> 3) Place test antenna in reference direction at far-field distance, aligned
> in all supported polarizations (single or dual) with the IAB-Node as
> depicted in annex E.1.3.
>
> 4) The test antenna shall be dual (or single) polarized with the same
> frequency range as the IAB-Node for co-location spurious emission test case.
>
> 5) Connect test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as depicted in
> annex E.1.3.
>
> 6) OTA co-location spurious emission is measured as the power sum over all
> supported polarizations at the CLTA conducted output(s).
>
> 7) The measurement device (signal analyser) characteristics shall be:
\- Detection mode: True RMS.
> 8) Set the _IAB type 1-O_ to transmit:
\- Set the IAB-Node to transmit maximum power according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of
physical channels in clause 4.9.2.
\- For the IAB-Node declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the IAB-Node to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.7.2 and
4.8 using the corresponding test models on all carriers configured.
> 9) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
> measurement bandwidth.
In addition, for _multi-band RIB_ , the following steps shall apply:
> 10) For _multi-band RIB_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
> involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
> apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
##### 6.7.5.5.5 Test requirements
##### 6.7.5.5.5.1 Test requirement for _IAB type 1-O_ {#test-requirement-for-
iab-type-1-o-2 .H6}
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other IAB receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA
and/or NR BS are co-located with a IAB Node.
The requirements assume co-location with base stations of the same class.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.
This requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9, in TS
38.174 [2], the power levels are specified at the CLTA output.
The output of the CLTA of any spurious emission shall not exceed the test
limit in table 6.7.5.5.5.1-1.
For a _multi-band RIB_ , the exclusions and conditions in the notes column of
table 6.7.5.5.5.1-1 apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 do not apply for the frequency
range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit frequency range of a
IAB-MT and IAB-DU. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a
single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum coupling loss. However, there
are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 [15].
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case
of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical
area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.
## 6.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation
### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna array from a co-located
base station. The requirement applies during the _transmitter ON period_ and
the _transmitter transient period_.
The requirement applies at each RIB supporting transmission in the operating
band.
The transmitter intermodulation level is the total radiated power of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the CLTA.
For _IAB type 1-O_ , the transmitter intermodulation requirement is captured
by the co-location transmitter intermodulation scenario case, in which the
interfering signal is injected into the CLTA.
### 6.8.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _IAB -DU type 1-O_ and _IAB -MT type 1-O_ is
defined in TS 38.174 [2], clause 9.8.2.
The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is not applicable for _IAB
type 2-O_.
### 6.8.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units associated
with the _RIB_ under test to restrict the generation of intermodulation

### 6.8.5 Test requirements
#### 6.8.5.1 Requirement for _IAB type 1-O_
The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the TRP unwanted
emission limits specified for OTA transmitter spurious emission in clause
6.7.5 (except co-location with other base stations), OTA out-of-band emissions
in clause 6.7.4 and OTA ACLR in clause 6.7.3 in the presence of a wanted
signal and an interfering signal, defined in table 6.8.5.1-1.
The requirement is applicable outside the _IAB RF Bandwidth edges_. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _IAB RF Bandwidth_
_edges_ or _Radio Bandwidth_ edges.
For RIBs supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the requirement
is also applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ for interfering signal offsets
where the interfering signal falls completely within the _sub-block gap_. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _sub-block_ edges.
For RIBs supporting operation in multiple _operating bands_ , the requirement
shall apply relative to the _IAB RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ of each _operating
band_. In case the inter RF Bandwidth gap is less than 3*BW~Channel~ MHz
(where BW~Channel~ is the minimal _IAB channel bandwidth_ of the band), the
requirement in the gap shall apply only for interfering signal offsets where
the interfering signal falls completely within the inter RF Bandwidth gap.

# 7 Radiated receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
General test conditions for receiver tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. IAB
configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.
Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for radiated
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:
\- Requirements apply during the IAB receive period.
\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.
\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver characteristics
do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
\- When IAB is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative offsets
of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower _IAB RF Bandwidth_ edge
or _sub-block_ edge inside a _sub-block gap_ , and the positive offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the upper _IAB RF Bandwidth_ edge or
_sub-block_ edge inside a _sub-block gap_.
NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the IAB in TDD operation is configured
to TX OFF power during _receive period_.
Each requirement, except OTA receiver spurious emissions, shall be met over
the RoAoA specified.
For FR1 requirements which are to be met over the _OTA REFSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB) for the
reference direction.
And
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB) for all
other directions.
For requirements which are to be met over the _minSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)
For FR2 requirements which are to be met over the _OTA REFSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Δ~FR2_REFSENS~ = -3 dB for the reference direction
and
Δ~FR2_REFSENS~ = 0 dB for all other directions
## 7.2 OTA sensitivity
### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or more
_OTA sensitivity direction declarations_ (OSDD), related to a IAB _type 1-H_
and IAB _type 1-O_ _receiver_.
The _IAB type 1-H_ and IAB _type 1-O_ _receiver_ may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the _receiver target_ by means of adjusting BS settings
resulting in multiple _sensitivity RoAoA_. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting
from the current BS settings is the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the IAB is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the OSDD
then the OSDD shall include:
\- IAB _channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level applicable to any
active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target redirection range_ in
the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the BS.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TR 37. 941 [29].
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
NOTE 2: In addition to the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ , several _sensitivity
RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver target redirection range_
without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
If the _IAB_ is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to
the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- IAB _channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level applicable to the
_sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- One declared active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
\- The receiver target reference direction.
NOTE 3: For _BS_ without target redirection capability, the declared (fixed)
_sensitivity RoAoA_ is always the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 7.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _IAB-DU type 1-H_ and _IAB-DU type 1-O_ is in TS
38.174 [2], clause 10.2.1.
The minimum requirement for _IAB-MT type 1-H_ and _IAB-MT type 1-O_ is in TS
38.174 [2], clause 10.2.2.
### 7.2.3 Test purpose

for a specified measurement channel at the EIS level and the range of angles
of arrival declared in the OSDD.

involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carriers activated in the other band.
### 7.2.5 Test requirements

## 7.7 OTA receiver spurious emissions
### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA RX spurious emission is the power of the emissions radiated from the
antenna array from a receiver unit.
Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.
The OTA receiver spurious emission limits for FR1 shall apply from 30 MHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_ , up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_ , where the
Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause [6.7.1]. For some _operating bands_ , the upper
limit of the spurious range might be higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply
with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the uplink _operating band_ , as specified in
Recommendation ITU-R SM.329 [10].
For _multi-band RIB_ the above exclusion applies for each supported _operating
band_.
The OTA receiver spurious emission limits for FR2 shall apply from 30 MHz to
2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the uplink _operating band_ ,
excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each
supported downlink _operating band_ , up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_ , where the Δf~OBUE~ is
defined in clause [6.7.1].
For a IAB operating in TDD, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirement shall
apply during the _transmitter OFF period_ only.
The metric used to capture OTA receiver spurious emissions for _IAB type 1-O_
and _IAB type 2-O_ is total radiated power (TRP), with the requirement defined
at the RIB.
### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _IAB-DU type 1-O_ is specified in TS 38.174 [2],
clause 10.7.1.2.
The minimum requirement for _IAB-DU type 2-O_ is specified in TS 38.174 [2],
clause 10.7.2.2.
The minimum requirement for _IAB-MT type 1-O_ is specified in TS 38.174 [2],
clause 10.7.3.1.
The minimum requirement for _IAB-MT type 2-O_ is specified in TS 38.174 [2],
clause 10.7.3.2.
### 7.7.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify if the receiver radiated spurious emissions from
the IAB at the RIB are within the specified minimum requirements.
### 7.7.4 Method of test

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be
set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I) as long as the
required TRP level is achieved.
#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power
measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to measure TRP is
to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber if so follow steps
1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10.
> 1) Place the IAB at the positioner.
>
> 2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of
> the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
> conditions in clause 7.7.5.
>
> 4) The measurement device characteristics shall be:
>
> \- Detection mode: True RMS.
>
> 5) Set the TDD IAB to receive only.
>
> 6) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be tested
> aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be
> performed (see annex I).
>
> 7) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
> measurement bandwidth
>
> 8) Repeat step 6-9 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement
> grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).
NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.
NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be done in
any order
> 9) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
> measurements.
In addition, for _multi-band RIB(s)_ , the following steps shall apply:
> 10) For _IAB type 1-O_ and _multi-band RIB(s)_ and single band tests, repeat
> the steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
> test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

## 7.8 OTA receiver intermodulation
### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver unit to
receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
two interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the
wanted signal. The requirement is defined as a directional requirement at the
_RIB_.
The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization, under
the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirements for _IAB-DU type 1-O_ are in TS 38.174 [2], clause
10.8.2.
The minimum requirements for _IAB-DU type 2-O_ are in TS 38.174 [2], clause
10.8.3.
The minimum requirements for _IAB-MT type 1-O_ are in TS 38.174 [2], clause
10.8.4.
### 7.8.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the IAB receiver to inhibit the
generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements caused by
the presence of two high-level interfering signals at frequencies with a
specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted signal.

### 7.9.5 Test requirement
#### 7.9.5.1 _IAB-DU type 1-O_
The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
the received signal and the interfering signal are the same direction and are
within the _minSENS RoAoA_
The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of _polarization match._
For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the RIB, the following

#### 8.1.1.2 OTA demodulation branches
Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2 _demodulation
branches_.
If the _IAB type 1-O_ , or the _IAB type 2-O_ uses polarization diversity and
has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals for each of the
_demodulation branches_ , then radiated performance requirements can be tested
for up to two _demodulation branches_ (i.e. 1RX or 2RX test setups). When
tested for two _demodulation branches_ , each demodulation branch maps to one
polarization.
If the _IAB type 1-O_ , or the _IAB type 2-O_ does not use polarization
diversity then radiated performance requirements can only be tested for a
single _demodulation branch_ (i.e. 1RX test setup).
#### 8.1.1.3 Applicability rule

Unless otherwise stated, for a IAB-DU declared to support more than 2
demodulation branches (for _IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type 2-O_), the performance
requirement tests for 2 demodulation branches shall apply, and the mapping
between connectors and demodulation branches is up to BS implementation.

#### 8.1.2.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding
enabled
##### 8.1.2.2.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.2.
##### 8.1.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement
For _IAB type 1-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2], clause
11.1.2.1.2.
For _IAB type 2-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2], clause
11.1.2.2.2.
##### 8.1.2.2.3 Test Purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.1.2.3 Performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH
##### 8.1.2.3.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH is determined by two
parameters: block error probability (BLER) of CSI part 1 and block error
probability of CSI part 2. The performance is measured by the required SNR at
block error probability of CSI part 1 not exceeding 0.1 %, and the required
SNR at block error probability of CSI part 2 not exceeding 1 %.
The CSI part 1 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the
CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1 information is sent.
The CSI part 2 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the
CSI part 2 information when the CSI part2 information is sent.
In the test of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only contains CSI
part 1 and CSI part 2 information, there is no HACK/ACK information
transmitted.
The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two cases as
follows:
\- 7 bits: 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2
\- 40 bits: 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2
The 7 bits UCI information case is further defined with the bitmap [c0 c1 c2
c3 c4] = [0 1 0 1 0] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is mapping to the RI
information, and with the bitmap [c0 c1] = [1 0] for CSI part 2 information.
The 40 bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit selection.
In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 are transmitted
simultaneously.
Which specific test(s) is applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rule defined in clause 8.1.1.3.2.
##### 8.1.2.3.2 Minimum Requirement
For _IAB type 1-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2] clause
11.1.2.1.3.
For _IAB type 2-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2] clause
11.1.2.2.3.
##### 8.1.2.3.3 Test Purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI with CSI part 1
and CSI part 2 bits multiplexed on PUSCH under multipath fading propagation
conditions for a given SNR.
##### 8.1.2.3.4 Method of test
##### 8.1.2.3.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-27 .H6}
Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1
Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS _receiver target reference direction_ (see
D.54 in table 4.6-1).
##### 8.1.2.3.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-23 .H6}
> 1) Place the IAB-DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test system, as
> shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the IAB-
> DU with the test system.
>
> 3) Set the IAB-DU in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4) Connect the IAB-DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
> simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network in
> OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation branch
> signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured to the
> corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A, and
> according to additional test parameters listed in table 8.1.2.3.4.2-1. The
> UCI information bit payload per slot is equal to 7bits with CSI part 1
> 5bits, CSI part 2 2bits, and the UCI information bit payload per slot is
> equal to 40 bits with CSI part 1 20bits, CSI part 2 20 bits.

### 8.1.3 Performance requirements for PUСCH
#### 8.1.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0
##### 8.1.3.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection
of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The
probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 [16] clause 6.3.3.1 and TS
38.101-2 [17] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for performance
requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e.
intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.3.
##### 8.1.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement
For _IAB type 1-O_ , the minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 [2] clause
11.3.1.1 and 11.1.3.1.2.
For _IAB type 2-O_ , the minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 [2] clause
11.3.2.1 and 11.1.3.2.2.
##### 8.1.3.1.3 Test Purpose

##### 8.1.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection
##### 8.1.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-
applicability-33 .H6}
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection equal to 0.1% or
less. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular bit position when
input is only noise. Each false bit detection is counted as one error.
The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an ACK
bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK bit
erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously detected
NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are mapped from
DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 [16] and TS 38.101-2 [17]
clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for performance requirement testing,
where the RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.3.
##### 8.1.3.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement {#minimum-requirement-32 .H6}
For BS type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2], clause
11.1.3.1.3.
For BS type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2], clause

##### 8.1.3.2.2 ACK missed detection
##### 8.1.3.2.2.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-
applicability-34 .H6}
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of
false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 [16] and TS 38.101-2 [17]
clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for performance requirement testing,
where the RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

##### 8.1.3.4.1 Definition and applicability
The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error probability
not exceeding 1%.
The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is sent. The
UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 [16] clause 6.3.3.1 and TS
38.101-2 [17] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for performance
requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e.
intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.

##### 8.1.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-
applicability-39 .H6}
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection equal to 0.1% or
less. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular bit position when
input is only noise. Each false bit detection is counted as one error.
The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an ACK
bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK bit
erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously detected
NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are mapped from
DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.3.

### 8.1.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
#### 8.1.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection
##### 8.1.4.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is determined by
the two parameters: total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa)
and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd). The performance is measured
by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1%
or less.
Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of
the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only
noise.
Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the
signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases --
detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that was sent, not detecting
any preamble at all, or detecting the correct preamble but with the out-of-
bounds timing estimation value. For AWGN, TDLC300-100 and TDLA30-300, a timing
estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest
path is larger than the time error tolerance values given in table
8.1.4.1.1-1.

## 8.2 IAB-MT performance requirements
### 8.2.1 General
#### 8.2.1.1 Scope and definitions
Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the _IAB-MT type 1-O_
and _IAB-MT type 2-O_ to correctly demodulate signals in various conditions
and configurations. Radiated performance requirements are specified at the
RIB.
Radiated performance requirements for the IAB-MT are specified for the fixed
reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation conditions in annex
J. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the IAB-MT.
The radiated performance requirements for _IAB-MT type 1-O_ and for _IAB-MT
type 2-O_ are limited to two OTA _demodulations branches_ as described in
clause 8.1.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2
_demodulation branches_ depending on the number of polarizations supported by
the IAB-MT, with the required SNR applied separately per polarization.
NOTE: IAB-MT can support more than 2 _demodulation branches_ , however OTA
conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 _demodulation branches_.
The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined
as:
> SNR = S / N
Where:
> S is the total signal energy in the slot on a single _TAB connector_ (for
> _IAB-MT type 1-H_).
>
> N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
> bandwidth over the duration of a slot on a single TAB connector (for _IAB-MT
> type 1-H_).
### 8.2.2 Demodulation performance requirements
#### 8.2.2.1 General
##### 8.2.2.1.1 Applicability rule for IAB-MT
##### 8.2.2.1.1.1 General {#general-23 .H6}
Unless otherwise stated, for an IAB-MT declared to support more than 2
demodulation branches (for _IAB-MT type 1-O_ and _IAB-MT type 2-O_), the
performance requirement tests for 2 demodulation branches shall apply, and the
mapping between connectors and demodulation branches is up to IAB-MT
implementation.
The tests requiring more than [20] dB SNR level are set to N/A in the test
requirements.
##### 8.2.2.1.1.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier
spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings-3
.H6}
Unless otherwise stated, the tests shall apply only for each subcarrier
spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).
##### 8.2.2.1.1.3 Applicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL
patterns {#applicability-of-requirements-for-tdd-with-different-ul-dl-
patterns-1 .H6}
Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported,
if IAB-MT supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of the supported TDD
UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.
##### 8.2.2.1.1.4 Applicability of requirements for IAB-MT features
{#applicability-of-requirements-for-iab-mt-features .H6}
Unless otherwise stated, for _IAB type 1-O_ , the PDSCH 256QAM tests (Test 1-1
of Clause 8.2.2.2.5.1) shall apply only for the 256QAM for PDSCH for FR1
declared to be supported (see D.200 in table 4.6-1, _pdsch-256QAM-FR1_).
Unless otherwise stated, for both _IAB type 1-O and IAB type 2-O_ , the PDSCH
tests shall apply only in case the PDSCH MIMO rank in the test case does not
exceed the maximum number of PDSCH MIMO layers declared to be supported (see
D.202 in table 4.6-1, _maxNumberMIMO-LayersPDSCH_).
Unless otherwise stated, for _IAB type 2-O_ , the PDSCH tests shall apply only
for the PT-RS option declared to be supported (see D.203 in table 4.6-1,
_onePortsPTRS_ (MSB)).
Note: Applicability information may be obtained based on vendor declaration
(Section 4.6) or alternatively from reading capability signaling.
#### 8.2.2.2 Performance requirements for PDSCH
##### 8.2.2.2.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PDSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-MT is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.2.2.1.1.
##### 8.2.2.2.2 Minimum requirements
For _IAB type 1-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2], clause
11.2.2.1.1.
For _IAB type 2-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2], clause
11.2.2.2.1.
##### 8.2.2.2.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.
##### 8.2.2.2.4 Method of test
##### 8.2.2.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-38 .H6}
Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.
RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~; see
clause 4.9.1.
Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS _receiver target reference direction_ (see
D.54 in table 4.6-1).
##### 8.2.2.2.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure .H6}
> 1) Place the IAB-MT with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test system, as
> shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the IAB-
> MT with the test system.
>
> 3) Set the IAB-MT in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4) Connect the IAB-MT tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
> simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network in
> OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation branch
> signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
> the corresponding DL reference measurement channel defined in annex A, and
> according to additional test parameters listed in table 8.2.2.2.4.2-1.

##### 8.2.3.2.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of CSI reporting is determined by the reporting
variance and the BLER performance using the transport format indicated by the
reported CQI. The purpose is to verify that the reported CQI values are in
accordance with the CQI definition given in TS 38.214 [27]. To account for
sensitivity of the input SNR the reporting definition is considered to be
verified if the reporting accuracy is met for at least one of two SNR levels
separated by an offset of 1 dB.
##### 8.2.3.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _IAB-MT type 1-O_ is in TS 38.174 [2] clause
11.2.3.1.1
The minimum requirement for _IAB-MT type 2-O_ is in TS 38.174 [2] clause
11.2.3.2.2.
##### 8.2.3.2.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to report correct median CQI and
expected BLER performance under AWGN conditions.

#### 8.2.3.3 Reporting of Precoding Matrix Information (PMI)
##### 8.2.3.3.1 Definition and applicability
The minimum performance requirements of PMI reporting are defined based on the
precoding gain, expressed as the relative increase in throughput when the
transmitter is configured according to the IAB-MT reported PMI compared to the
case when the transmitter is using random precoding, respectively. When the
transmitter uses random precoding, for each PDSCH allocation a precoder is
randomly generated with equal probability of each applicable i~1~ and i~2~
combination and applied to the PDSCH. A fixed transport format (FRC) is
configured for all requirements.
The requirements for transmission mode 1 with higher layer parameter
_codebookType_ set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' are specified in terms of the
ratio:
In the definition of _γ_ , for 4TX, 8TX PMI requirements, is 90 % of the
maximum throughput obtained at using the precoders configured according to the
IAB-MT reports, and is the throughput measured at with random precoding.
##### 8.2.3.3.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _IAB-MT type 1-O_ is in TS 38.174 [2] clause
11.2.3.1.2.
The minimum requirement for _IAB-MT type 2-O_ is in TS 38.174 [2] clause
11.2.3.2.3.

###### ## Annex B (normative): Environmental requirements for the BS equipment
# B.1 General
For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions under
which the IAB is to be tested are defined.
For OTA requirements where it is not possible to environmentally control the
entire calibrated OTA chamber either localised control of the IAB hardware or
alternative OTA measurements which are then related to the original
specification are acceptable, see annex B.7.
# B.2 Normal test environment
When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should be
performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions stated in
table B.1.
Table B.1: Limits of conditions for normal test environment
Condition Minimum Maximum
* * *
Barometric pressure 86 kPa 106 kPa Temperature 15 °C 30 °C Relative humidity
20 % 85 % Power supply Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer  
Vibration Negligible
The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent the
maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within the
specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test report.
NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.
# B.3 Extreme test environment
## B.3.1 General
The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:
> 1) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the IEC
> 60 721-3-3 [19];
>
> 2) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the IEC
> 60 721-3-4 [20];
>
> 3) The equipment that does not comply with the mentioned classes, the
> relevant classes from IEC 60 721 [21] documentation for temperature,
> humidity and vibration shall be declared.
NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the standard
operational conditions is not tested in the present document. These may be
stated and tested separately.
## B.3.2 Extreme temperature
When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum operating temperatures
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
Minimum temperature:
The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 [22].
Maximum temperature:
The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 [23].
NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational prior to
the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.
# B.4 Vibration
When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as defined
by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test. This shall
use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing the required
environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to the test procedure
of IEC 60 068-2-6 [24]. Other environmental conditions shall be within the
ranges specified in annex B.2.
NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in to
equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should only
vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.
# B.5 Power supply
When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test shall
be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating voltage
defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
Upper voltage limit:
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to
the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 [10] Test Ab/Ad and IEC 60 068-2-2
[11] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.
Lower voltage limit:
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to
the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 [10] Test Ab/Ad and IEC 60 068-2-2
[11] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.
# B.6 Measurement of test environments
The measurement accuracy of the IAB test environments defined in annex B shall
be:
Pressure: ±5 kPa
Temperature: ±2 degrees
Relative humidity: ±5 %
DC voltage: ±1.0 %
AC voltage: ±1.5 %
Vibration: 10 %
Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz
The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.
# B.7 OTA extreme test methods
## B.7.1 Direct far field method
The IAB under test is placed inside a sealed RF transparent environmental
enclosure, as showed in Figure B.7.1-1. This is connected to an environment
control system which regulates the temperature inside the enclosure. The
remaining equipment inside the OTA chamber (any suitable antenna test range
chamber type is acceptable) is outside the environmental control and is at
nominal temperature. Positioners, test antennas and all other OTA test
equipment do not need to be specified over the extreme temperature range.
{width="6.69375in" height="2.9084765966754156in"}
Figure B.7.1-1: Measurement set up for extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy
using direct far field method
The presence of the environmental chamber inside the OTA chamber may affect
the measurement accuracy due to additional reflections and refractions, also
the loss through the environmental enclosure may not be consistent with
direction as the path through the radome may vary with angle. Hence the system
should be calibrated in all tested directions, frequencies and temperatures if
necessary.
NOTE: Currently only a single direction is specified for extreme testing so a
single calibration direction is sufficient.
Conformance may be demonstrated by measuring the difference between the
nominal measurement and the extreme measurement (Δ~sample~) or by measuring
P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ directly.
Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and
calculate total radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_
as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.
## B.7.2 Relative method
The IAB under test is placed inside a small (compared to a far field chamber)
anechoic chamber which is both RF a screened and suitable for environmental
conditioning. The RF conditions inside the chamber are absorptive and capable
of dissipating the power of the IAB when radiating. A sample antenna or RF
probe are placed in a location which gives a sample of the main beam EIRP but
does not have to accurately measure the EIRP directly, instead the near-field
response is measured. For this method test components are exposed to the full
temperature range for example the test antenna/probe, cables, absorbers etc.
may change as a function of temperature.
Using the relative method it is also necessary to measure the EIRP under
nominal conditions using an appropriately calibrated far field (or near filed)
test range to obtain P~max,c,EIRP~.
{width="5.121527777777778in" height="2.661111111111111in"}
Figure B.7.2-1: Measurement set up for extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy
using difference method
Measurements from the test antenna/probe are taken under nominal conditions
and extreme conditions to calculate (Δ~sample~). The difference between the
nominal and extreme conditions (Δ~sample~) is then used along with the nominal
EIRP measurement (P~max,c,EIRP~) made in the appropriate far field or near
field chamber and compared against the extreme requirement. As follows:
P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ = P~max,c,EIRP~ + Δ~sample~.
Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and
calculate total radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_

requirements
The test requirements explicitly defined in the present document have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification TS
38.174 [2] using the test tolerances (TT) defined here. When the TT value is
zero, the test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When
the TT value is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum
requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the
following tables.
The TT~OTA~ values are derived from OTA Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the TT~OTA~
values may sometimes be set to zero.
The TT~OTA~ values should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known OTA Test System errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).
Note that a formula for applying TT~OTA~ values is provided for all OTA tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where
the OTA Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2.
In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined TT~OTA~
value in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as defined
in this annex.

###### ## Annex F (normative): Void
###### ## Annex G (informative): Transmitter spatial emissions declaration
# G.1 General
The transmitter spatial emission declaration is an optional declaration which
provides additional information on the power level of emission in the intended
(in cell) spatial directions and the unintended (out of cell) spatial
directions. The declarations are only valid when the beam is configured in one
of the EIRP conformance directions.

Figure G.1-1: Example of out of cell directions set and declared single beam
at a single extreme steering direction
The declaration of unwanted spatial emission may in many circumstances not
directly relate to system performance on its own. This is because it is often
not possible to differentiate wanted and unwanted radiation, and furthermore
because the benefits of optimizing beamforming performance may outweigh the
impacts of \"unwanted\" radiation, leading to systems with apparently higher
unwanted radiation also providing superior throughput performance. System
performance should additionally be characterized taking all factors into
account.

NOTE 1: The declaration of unwanted spatial emission may in many circumstances
not directly relate to system performance on its own. This is because it is
often not possible to differentiate wanted and unwanted radiation, and
furthermore because the benefits of optimizing beamforming performance may
outweigh the impacts of \"unwanted\" radiation, leading to systems with
apparently higher unwanted radiation also providing superior throughput
performance. System performance should additionally be characterized taking
all factors into account.
NOTE 2: The average out of cell power level reflects the impact of out of cell
radiation on other cells more accurately than the out of cell power level for
individual test beams.

# J.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:
\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized by a
number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile can be
further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum delay spanned
by the taps.
\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay profile
and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical spectrum shape
and a maximum Doppler frequency.
\- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz
-- 52.6 GHz).
## J.2.1 Delay profiles
The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 [26] TDL models. The
simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps are only
used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay profiles
specified in annex J.2.1.1 and J.2.1.2 can be used as such.
> Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 [26].
>
> Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.
>
> Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in clause
> 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 [26].
>
> Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is done
> simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the delay
> resolution.
>
> Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge them by
> calculating their linear power sum.
>
> Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge the
> taps as follows:
\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered)
\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the weakest,
select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.
\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows:
\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of the
weakest tap and the second delay tap.
\- Remove the second delay tap.
> \- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows:
\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.
\- Remove the second-to-last tap.
> \- Otherwise:
>
> \- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has the
> smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.
>
> \- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
> neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the weakest
> tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.
>
> \- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.
>
> \- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference for
> merging.
>
> \- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power of
> the weakest tap and the selected tap.
>
> \- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged tap is
> the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.
>
> \- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap is
> the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.
>
> \- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average delay
> of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on the sampling
> grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay. Otherwise, the
> location of the merged tap is rounded towards the direction of the selected
> tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns 20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or
> equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher power). The weakest tap and the
> selected tap are removed.
>
> \- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.
>
> Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB -8.8 dB)
>
> Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap merge,
> adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the power of the
> last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.
>
> Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.
NOTE 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification steps
may differ from the values in tables J.2.1.1-2, J.2.1.1-3, J.2.1.1-4, and
J.2.1.2-2 for the corresponding model.
NOTE 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the linear
domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the linear domain.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are defined in
tables J.2.3.1.2-2, J.2.3.1.2-3 and J.2.3.1.2-4 as below.
The values in table J.2.3.1.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4 high
correlation cases to ensure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite
after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using the equation:
{width="2.0in" height="0.3055555555555556in"}
Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value is used
to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high correlation case,
a=0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a=0.00012.
The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in table
J.2.3.1.2-3 to ensure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite after
round-off to 4 digit precision with a =0.00012.

### J.2.3.2 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas
The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in J.2.3.2 apply to two cases as
presented below:
\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized antennas
used at gNB
\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at both UE and gNB
The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization slant
angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna element with +90
degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For multiple TX antennas
case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0 degrees polarization slant
angles are deployed at UE.
For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for the
other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number of TX or
RX antennas.

# J.3 Physical signals, channels mapping and precoding
## J.3.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the transmission on antenna port(s) is defined by
using a precoder matrix of size , where is the number of physical transmit
antenna elements configured per test , is the number of ports for a reference
signal or physical channel configured per test, and is the first port for that
reference signal or physical channel as defined in clauses 7.3 and 7.4 in TS
38.211 [9]. This precoder takes as an input a block of signals for antenna
port(s) , , , with being the number of modulation symbols per antenna port
including the reference signal symbols, and generates a block of signals the
elements of which are to be mapped onto the frequency-time index pair as per
the test configuration but transmitted on different physical antenna elements:
For Clause 6 and 8, the transmission of PDCCH and PDCCH DMRS on antenna port
is defined by using a precoder matrix of size 2x1. This precoder takes as an
input a block of signals for antenna port(s) , and generates a block of
signals the elements of which are to be mapped onto the frequency-time index
pair as per the test configuration but transmitted on different physical
antenna elements:
The precoder matrix is specific to the test case configuration is defined in
Clause 5.2.2.2 of TS 38.214 [24].
The transmission on PT-RS antenna port is associated (using same precoder)
with the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port among the DM-RS antenna ports
assigned for the PDSCH.
The physical antenna elements are identified by indices, where is the number
of physical antenna elements configured per test.
Modulation symbols with (i.e. PSS, SSS, PBCH and DM-RS for PBCH) are directly
mapped to first physical antenna element.
_Modulation symbols for CSI-RS resources which configured for tracking with

_Modulation symbols for CSI-RS resources which configured for beam refinement

are _mapped to the physical antenna index_ where is the number of NZP CSI-RS
ports configured per test.
###### ## Annex K (informative): Measuring noise close to noise-floor
As the emission level seen by the measurement receiver (_P~UEM~_) for co-
location requirements are very low, it is suggested to measure relative noise
change instead of absolute noise level. For the situation where the noise
level is stable, the noise level change can be identified by a relative noise
measurement method. This method measures the relative noise change extracted
from when the test object is operating and when the power is disconnected.
From the two measured noise levels the relative noise change can be
determined. The relations between measured noise change _δ~1~_ , noise floor
N~0~ and the relation to _P~UEM~_ with respect to the noise floor denoted
_δ~2~_ is visualized in the left drawing in figure K-1.
{width="2.75in" height="1.5104166666666667in"} {width="2.8958333333333335in"
height="2.1770833333333335in"}
Figure K-1: Relative noise measurement
The absolute emission level in decibel scale is determined from a relative
measurement of _δ~1\ ~_ as:
$P_{\text{UEM}} = N_{0} - \delta_{2}$
where _N~0~_ is the noise floor of the measurement receiver and _δ~2~_ is
plotted as function of _δ~1~_ at the right in figure K-1. The absolute noise
floor of the measurement receiver, including probe antenna, cables, filter and
LNA is determined by a calibration procedure. The calibration will determine
the absolute emission level (_N~0~_) accuracy of measuring out-of-band
unwanted emission close to the thermal noise floor.
###### ## Annex L (normative): In-channel TX tests for IAB-DU
The Annex H in TS 38.141-2 [6] applies to FR1 and FR2 IAB-DU.
###### ## Annex M (normative): In-channel TX tests for IAB-MT
# M.0 Applicability
IAB-MT EVM can be determined by the process according to following
alternatives:
\- Alternative 1: Annex E in TS 38.521-1 [28] for FR1 IAB-MT and Annex E in TS
38.521-2 [29] for FR2 IAB-MT . Only CP-OFDM waveform of PUSCH is measured for
IAB-MT; or
\- Alternative 2: from Annex M.1 to Annex M.7.
# M.1 General
The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant parameters that
describe the In-channel quality of the output signal of the TX under test in a
single measurement process.
The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter, however,
are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for description inside
this annex places particular emphasis on the exclusion of all
interdependencies among the parameters.
# M.2 Basic principles
The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of the TX
under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal, that is
generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal error free
received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent (generally complex)
baseband signals.
The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only. These
numbers are taken from a TDD frame structure with normal CP length, 120 kHz
SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 400 MHz (_N_ ~RB~ = 264).
The application of the text below, however, is not restricted to this
parameter set.
## M.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring equipment
and stored for further processing. It is sampled at a sampling rate which is
the product of the SCS and the _FFT size_ , and it is named $z\left( \upsilon
\right)$.
For FR1, _FFT size_ is determined by the transmission bandwidth in TS 38.176-1
[3] table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table
6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS.
For FR2, _FFT size_ is determined by the transmission bandwidth in table
6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5.2‑3 for 120 kHz SCS. In the time
domain it comprises at least 10 ms. It is modelled as a signal with the
following parameters:
\- demodulated data content,
\- carrier frequency,
\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
For the example in the annex, the _FFT size_ is 4096 based on table
6.6.3.5.2-3. The sampling rate of 491.52 Msps is the product of the _FFT size_
and SCS.
## M.2.2 Ideal signal
Two types of ideal signals are defined:
The first ideal signal $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by the
measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters:
\- demodulated data content,
\- nominal carrier frequency,
\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate determined
from annex M.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the signal is described
in the test models.
The second ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by the
measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters for FR1 and FR2:
\- nominal demodulation reference signal and nominal PT-RS if present (all
other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),
\- nominal carrier frequency,
\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,
\- nominal timing.
It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate determined
from annex M.2.1 in the time domain.
## M.2.3 Measurement results
The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the following:
\- Carrier frequency error.
\- EVM.
\- Resource element TX power.
\- OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP).
Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX chain
after equalisation.
## M.2.4 Measurement points
The resource element TX power is measured after the FFT box as described in
figure M.2.4-1 for FR1 and in figure M.2.4.2. The EVM shall be measured at the
point after the FFT and a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as
depicted in for FR1 in figure M.2.4-1 and for FR2 in figure M.2.4-2. The FFT
window of _FFT size_ samples out of (_FFT size_ \+ cyclic prefix length)
samples in the time domain is selected in the \"Remove CP\" box.
For FR1, The _FFT size_ and the cyclic prefix length are obtained from TS
38.176-1 [3] table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS
and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS.
For FR2, _FFT size_ and the cyclic prefix length is determined from table
6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5.2‑3 for 120 kHz SCS.
In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic prefix
larger than the values listed in TS 38.176-1 [3] tables 6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3
and 6.5.3.5-4 for FR1 and table 6.6.3.5.2-2 and table 6.6.3.5.2-3 for FR2.
Table M.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol number and the formula how
to compute the length of cyclic prefix for those two symbols according to the
sampling rate.
Table M.2.4-1: Slot number and symbol number identifying the longer CP length
for normal CP
* * *
**SCS (kHz)** **Frequency Range** **# slots in subframe** **Symbol # and slot
# with longer CP** **Longer CP length**
* * *
15 FR1 1 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 128 (symbol 7, slot 0)
30 2 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 64 (symbol 0, slot 1)
60 4 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 32 (symbol 0, slot 2)
60 FR2 4 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 32 (symbol 0, slot 2)
120 8 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 16 (symbol 0, slot 4)
* * *
For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096 samples
out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 4 has 256 more samples in the
cyclic prefix than the other symbols (the longer CP length = 544).

# M.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
Sample timing, carrier frequency in $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are varied in
order to minimise the difference between $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$, after the amplitude ratio of $z\left( \upsilon
\right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ has been scaled. Best fit (minimum
difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value between $z\left(
\upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is an absolute minimum.
The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier frequency
error.
From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.
NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be supported by
post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process defined in the pre-FFT
domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it does not exclude the samples
in-between the FFT widths and it does not exclude the bandwidth outside the
transmission bandwidth configuration).
NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and sample
frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there are no
requirements for sample frequency error. Hence the algorithm models the RF and
the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It returns one error and
does not distinguish between both.
After this process the samples $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are called
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$.
# M.4 Timing of the FFT window
The FFT window length is _FFT size_ samples per OFDM symbol. For TDD, the
number of FFTs performed is the number of uplink symbols in the measurement
interval.
The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.
In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic prefix
without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the window. The EVM
requirements shall be met within a window _W_ \ 1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the distinct
> borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are also spread and
> the timing is not obvious.
>
> 2\. In the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$, the timing is known.
>
> Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation peak.
> The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse
> response\" of the TX filter.
>
> 3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation of
> the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is a Dirac peak and that the
> correlation between the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and the
> data in the measured signal is 0\. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in
> case of more than one highest, the earliest) indicates the timing in the
> measured signal.
The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to $z^{0}\left(
\upsilon \right)$. This subset of samples is called $z'\left( \upsilon
\right)$.
From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.
The timing of the centre $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ is determined
according to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal CP,
there are two values for $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ in a 1 ms period:
\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = length of cyclic prefix / 2,
\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = Longer CP length - length of cyclic prefix
/ 2,
Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from TS 38.176-1 [3] table
6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4
for 60 kHz SCS for FR1, and table 6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table
6.6.3.5.2-3 for 120 kHz SCS for FR2, and the longer CP length is obtained from
table M.2.4-1.
As per the example values.
\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c} = 144$ within the CP of length 288 for most
OFDM symbols in 1 ms,
\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c} = 400$ (= 544 -- 144) within the CP of length
544 for OFDM symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 4.
# M.5 Resource element TX power
Perform FFT on $z'\left( \nu \right)$ with the FFT window timing
$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$.
The result is called $Z'\left( t,f \right)$. The RE TX (RETP) power is then
defined as:
$$\text{RETP} = \left| Z'\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}\text{SCS}$$
where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.
From RETP, the OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:
$$\text{OSTP} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{sym}}}\sum_{}^{}\text{RETP}$$
Where the summation accumulates $N_{\text{RB}}N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$
values of all _N~sym~_ OFDM symbols that carry PUSCH and not containing PUCCH,
SRS or PRACH within a slot.
$\ N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}} = 12$.
For TDD, $N_{ul}$ is the number of slots with downlink symbols in a 10 ms
measurement interval and is computed according to the values in table
4.9.2.2-1.
For the example used in the annex, $N_{ul} = 64$ and $N_{\text{RB}} = 264$.
# M.6 Post-FFT equalisation
Perform $14N_{ul}$ FFTs on $z'\left( \nu \right)$, one for each OFDM symbol
within 10 ms measurement interval with the FFT window timing to produce an
array of samples, $14N_{ul}$ in the time axis _t_ by _FFT size_ in the
frequency axis _f_.
For the example in the annex, 1120 FFTs are performed on $z'\left( \nu
\right)$. The result is an array of samples, 1120 in the time axis by 4096 in
the frequency axis.
The equalizer coefficients $\widetilde{a}\left( f \right)$ and
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ are determined as follows:
> 1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
> acquired signal $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ and the post-FFT ideal signal
> $I_{2}\left( t,f \right)$, for each demodulation reference signal, over 10
> ms measurement interval. This process creates a set of complex ratios:
$a\left( t,f \right)e^{\text{jφ}\left( t,f \right)} = \frac{Z'\left( t,f
\right)}{I_{2}\left( t,f \right)}$

# M.7 EVM
## M.7.0 General
For EVM create two sets of $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$, according to
the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and $\left(
\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$, using the equalizer coefficients from M.6.
The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from $i_{1}\left( \upsilon
\right)$ (annex M.2.2) and are called $I\left( t,f \right)$.
The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized measured
signal.
$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i
\right)}^{}\left| Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right) - I\left( t,f \right)
\right|^{2}}}{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left|
I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}}$
Where:
\- _T_ is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,
\- $F\left( t \right)$ is the set of subcarriers within the resource blocks
with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol _t_ ,
\- $I\left( t,f \right)$ _is_ the ideal signal reconstructed by the
measurement equipment in accordance with relevant test models,
\- $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$ is the equalized signal under test.
NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer is
calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals.
## M.7.1 Averaged EVM (TDD)
Let $N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with uplink symbols
within a 10 ms measurement interval. For TDD, the averaging in the time domain
can be calculated from $N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}$ slots of different 10 ms
measurement intervals and should have a minimum of $N_{\text{ul}}$ slots
averaging length where $N_{\text{ul}}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval.
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the EVM results
in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide the sum by the
number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient (RMS).
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i =
1}^{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i =
1}^{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$
_Where_ $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot _i_.
The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$at the window _W_ extremities. Thus
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using $\widetilde{t}
= \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using$\widetilde{t} =
\mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (_l_ and _h_ , low and high; where low is
the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).
$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max_{}\left(
{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}
\right)$
In order to unite at least $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots, consider the minimum integer
number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where $N_{\text{frame}}$ is determined
by
$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times
N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$
And for FR1, $N_{\text{slot}} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{\text{slot}} = 2$ for
30 kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP. For FR2,
$N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 8$ for 120 kHz
SCS.
Unite by RMS.
$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k =
1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{\text{frame},k}^{2}}$
The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$is compared against the limit.
