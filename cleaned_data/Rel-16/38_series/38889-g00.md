# Introduction
A study item, \"Study on NR-based Access to Unlicensed Spectrum\", was
approved at 3GPP TSG RAN #77 [2] and revised in 3GPP TSG RAN #80 [30]. This
study is to determine a single global solution for NR-based access to
unlicensed spectrum, to be compatible with the NR concepts.
The objectives of the study include:
\- Study NR-based operation in unlicensed spectrum (RAN1, RAN2, RAN4)
including
> \- Physical channels inheriting the choices of duplex mode, waveform,
> carrier bandwidth, subcarrier spacing, frame structure, and physical layer
> design made as part of the NR study and avoiding unnecessary divergence with
> decisions made in the NR WI
>
> \- Consider unlicensed bands below 7GHz
>
> \- Consider similar forward compatibility principles made in the NR WI
>
> \- Initial access, channel access. Scheduling/HARQ, and mobility including
> connected/inactive/idle mode operation and radio-link monitoring/failure
>
> \- Coexistence methods within NR-based and between NR-based operation in
> unlicensed and LTE-based LAA and with other incumbent RATs in accordance
> with regulatory requirements in e.g., 5GHz , 6GHz bands
>
> \- Coexistence methods already defined for 5GHz band in LTE-based LAA
> context should be assumed as the baseline for 5GHz operation. Enhancements
> in 5GHz over these methods should not be precluded. NR-based operation in
> unlicensed spectrum should not impact deployed Wi-Fi services (data, video
> and voice services) more than an additional Wi-Fi network on the same
> carrier
The above study will address the following architectural scenarios (RAN2):
\- An NR-based LAA cell(s) connects with an LTE or NR anchor cell operating in
licensed spectrum
\- The study assumes the techniques for linking between Pcell (LTE or NR
licensed CC) and Scell (NR unlicensed CCs) according to the NR WI
\- An NR-based cell operating standalone in unlicensed spectrum, connected to
a 5G-CN network, e.g., for private network deployments;
\- Study how to ensure from a RAN level that connection and security
management can be integrated with the E-UTRAN, NG RAN and 5G CN architecture,
including service continuity requirements for users moving between cells of
licensed and unlicensed frequency bands, liaising with SA2 as required
The results and findings of the study are documented in this technical report.

# 4 Regulatory requirements
## 4.1 Regulatory requirements for 5GHz band
The range 5150-5925 MHz, or parts thereof, is potentially available for
license-assisted access to unlicensed operation. This represents a significant
amount of spectrum that can be used by operators to augment their service
offerings in licensed bands. The range above can be operated under a license-
exempt regime or ISM but must be shared with existing mobile services and
other incumbent services. The quality of service offered by a licensed regime
can therefore not be matched. Hence, unlicensed access is viewed as
complementary, and does not reduce the need for additional allocations for
licensed operation in view of the increased demand for wireless broadband
access.
It is relevant to consider the global (International) ITU-R allocations and
technical provisions first. These could be basis for defining globally
harmonised bands for LAA and starting points for requirements and limits
before the local variations are considered.
**[5150-5350 and 5470-5725 MHz]{.underline}**
WRC 2003 allocated the bands 5 150-5 350 MHz and 5 470-5 725 MHz on a co-
primary basis to the mobile service for the implementation of \"wireless
access systems (WAS), including radio local area networks (RLANs)\". This was
subject to technical and regulatory provisions included in the radio
regulations given in Resolution 229 (WRC-03), which was subsequently revised
at WRC-12 to Resolution 229 (Rev. WRC-12) [38]. These provisions are followed
by many Administrations and resolves:
1) that the use of these bands by the mobile service will be for the
implementation of WAS, including RLANs, as described in the most recent
version of Recommendation ITU‑R M.1450;
2) that in the band 5 150-5 250 MHz, stations in the mobile service shall be
restricted to indoor use with a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 200 mW and a maximum
mean e.i.r.p. density of 10 mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band or equivalently 0.25
mW/25 kHz in any 25 kHz band;
3) that administrations may monitor whether the aggregate pfd levels given in
Recommendation ITU‑R S.1426 have been, or will be exceeded in the future, in
order to enable a future competent conference to take appropriate action;
4) that in the band 5 250-5 350 MHz, stations in the mobile service shall be
limited to a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 200 mW and a maximum mean e.i.r.p.
density of 10 mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band. Administrations are requested to take
appropriate measures that will result in the predominant number of stations in
the mobile service being operated in an indoor environment. Furthermore,
stations in the mobile service that are permitted to be used either indoors or
outdoors may operate up to a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 1 W and a maximum mean
e.i.r.p. density of 50 mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band, and, when operating above a
mean e.i.r.p. of 200 mW, these stations shall comply with the following
e.i.r.p. elevation angle mask where θ is the angle above the local horizontal
plane (of the Earth):

**[Interference to Weather Radars]{.underline}**
Interference to Weather Radars is also a hot topic in the EU. The two last
versions of EN 301 893 (1.6.1 and 1.7.1) have included amendments to better
protect these radars, like the prohibition to give the user access to the
configuration control settings that would allow him to disconnect the DFS
functionality.
The use of the band 5.60-5.65 GHz by WLANs is allowed in Europe, and a Market
Surveillance campaign on WLANs 5 GHz has been led at EU level by the ADCO
R&TTE Group. The report [20] of the campaign has proposed specific
recommendations to improve the situation. These recommendations do not require
amendments to the last version of EN 301 893.
#### 4.1.1.2 Israel
In Israel the bands 5150-5250 MHz and 5250-5350 MHz are open to RLANs.
#### 4.1.1.3 Russia
In the Russian Federation the bands 5150-5350 MHz, the band 5470-5725 MHz
above 5650 MHz and the band 5725-5825 MHz [20] are allowed to RLANs. Use of
DFS is not mandated.
#### 4.1.1.4 South Africa
In South Africa the bands 5150-5250 MHz and 5250-5350 MHz are available to
RLANs but restricted to indoor use. The band 5470-5725 MHz is also open to
RLANs.
#### 4.1.1.5 Turkey
In Turkey the bands 5150-5250 MHz and 5250-5350 MHz are restricted to indoor
use. DFS and TPC are mandated in the band 5470-5725 MHz.
### 4.1.2 ITU Region 2
#### 4.1.2.1 USA
The use of unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum in USA is governed by FCC part 15
regulations [3]. In Feb 2013, potential new rules were proposed in FCC 13-22
[4]. Figure 4.1.2.1-1 summarizes the relevant part 15 rules for 5GHz
unlicensed spectrum usage:
{width="6.6819444444444445in" height="1.0583333333333333in"}
Figure 4.1.2.1-1 : Summary of existing and proposed new FCC part 15 rules for
5GHz unlicensed spectrum usage
In Figure 4.1.2.1-1, U-NII-x bands denote frequency bands for Unlicensed
National Information Infrastructure devices usage that are governed by §15.407
[3]. As shown in the figure, there is also an overlapping ruling of §15.247
from 5.725 to 5.85 GHz. A device could choose to follow either U-NII rulings
or §15.247 rulings when operating within the frequency range.
In the rest of this section, we summarize FCC paragraphs 15.407 and 15.247
rules. In general either frequency hopping or digital modulation techniques
are permitted under part 15 rules. Since LTE is not designed as a frequency
hopping system, the rest of the document will focus on regulations related to
digital modulation.
Paragraph 15.247 rules relevant for LTE point to multi-point communications
are summarized in 4 aspects:
\- Transmission Bandwidth:
\- The minimum 6 dB bandwidth shall be at least 500 kHz.
\- Maximum Transmit Power:
\- Peak conducted output power shall not exceed 1 W. An alternative to peak
power measurements is maximum conducted output power, which is the total
transmit power over all antennas and antenna elements when the transmitter is
operating at its maximum power control level.
\- Note that, the conducted output power limit is based on the use of antennas
with directional gains that do not exceed 6 dBi. If transmitting antennas of
directional gain greater than 6 dBi are used, the conducted output power from
the intentional radiator shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the
directional gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
\- Out of Band Emission:
\- In any 100 kHz bandwidth outside the frequency band, the radio frequency
power that is produced by the intentional radiator shall be at least 20 dB
below that in the 100 kHz bandwidth within the band that contains the highest
level of the desired power, based on either an RF conducted or a radiated
measurement. If the transmitter complies with the conducted power limits based
on the use of RMS averaging over a time interval, the attenuation required
under this paragraph shall be 30 dB instead of 20 dB.
\- Power Spectrum Density:
\- The power spectral density conducted from the intentional radiator to the
antenna shall not be greater than 8 dBm in any 3 kHz band during any time
interval of continuous transmission. The same method of determining the
conducted output power shall be used to determine the power spectral density.

#### 4.1.3.6 Singapore
In Singapore the bands 5150-5250 MHz, 5250-5350 MHz, 5470-5725MHz and
5725-5850 MHz are open to RLANs.
#### 4.1.3.7 Australia
In Australia the band bands 5150-5250 MHz, 5250-5350 MHz and 5470-5725 MHz,
except the sub-band 5600-5650 MHz, are open to RLANs. DFS and TPC are
mandatory in the bands 5250-5350 MHz and 5470-5725 MHz.
### 4.1.4 Applicability of DFS requirements
The concept surfaced around 2001 in the ECC for handling uniform spread of
WLAN interference into satellite and radar services, but was soon extended to
include methods for discovery and avoidance of frequencies used by the radar
service in the preparation work for WRC 2003.
Use of DFS in accordance with Annex 1 of ITU-R Recommendation M.1652 [39] is
mandated as per Resolution 229 [38]. The 5 GHz Harmonized European Standard
developed by ETSI TC BRAN was the first to include these DFS rules (EN 301 893
V1.2.3 in 2003), the DFS test specification included in this standard
therefore became the basis for the development of the FCC DFS test
specification and other test specifications in other countries.
For NR-U, it appears that conformance testing would only have to be performed
for the BS. Already at the outset in ITU-R M.1652 it was made clear that full
DFS functionality may not have to be implemented in all devices, only those
controlling the transmission [39]:
**2.1 Detection requirements**
The DFS mechanism should be able to detect interference signals above a
minimum DFS detection threshold of --62 dBm for devices with a maximum
e.i.r.p. of \ (2) Radar Detection Function of Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS). U-NII
> devices operating with any part of its 26 dB emission bandwidth in the
> 5.25-5.35 GHz and 5.47-5.725 GHz bands shall employ a DFS radar detection
> mechanism to detect the presence of radar systems and to avoid co-channel
> operation with radar systems. Operators shall only use equipment with a DFS
> mechanism that is turned on when operating in these bands. The device must
> sense for radar signals at 100 percent of its emission bandwidth. The
> minimum DFS detection threshold for devices with a maximum e.i.r.p. [...]
>
> (i) Operational Modes. The DFS requirement applies to the following
> operational modes:
>
> (A) The requirement for channel availability check time applies in the
> master operational mode.
>
> (B) The requirement for channel move time applies in both the master and
> slave operational modes.
>
> (ii) Channel Availability Check Time. A U-NII device shall check if there is
> a radar system already operating on the channel before it can initiate a
> transmission on a channel and when it has to move to a new channel. The
> U-NII device may start using the channel if no radar signal with a power
> level greater than the interference threshold values listed in paragraph
> (h)(2) of this section, is detected within 60 seconds.
>
> (iii) Channel Move Time. After a radar\'s presence is detected, all
> transmissions shall cease on the operating channel within 10 seconds.
> Transmissions during this period shall consist of normal traffic for a
> maximum of 200 ms after detection of the radar signal. In addition,
> intermittent management and control signals can be sent during the remaining
> time to facilitate vacating the operating channel.
Similar to the ETSI BRAN harmonized standard, there is also a requirement that
\"the device must sense for radar signals at 100 percent of its emission
bandwidth\". In deriving the minimum DFS detection threshold for the WAS
receiver, it was assumed that above this threshold the emissions within the
RLAN bandwidth would desensitize the radar receiver. Reciprocity was thus
assumed, the WAS should be able to detect a radar within its emission
bandwidth. The bandwidth of the WAS affects the probability of detecting a
radar signal and its side lobes and the probability of causing interference
(the WAS emissions).
## 4.2 Regulatory requirements for 6GHz band
Currently, CEPT and FCC have started initiatives to investigate potentialities
for deployment of IMT services in the 5.925-7.125 GHz frequency range (e.g. US
5925 -- 7125 MHz, or European 5925 -- 6425 MHz, or parts thereof), with
considerations for all or part of this range being made available for
unlicensed operation [32].
# 5 Spectrum considerations
For the NR-U study item, different unlicensed bands or shared bands have been
discussed, such as 2.4 GHz band, 3.5 GHz band, 5 GHz band, and 6 GHz band.
Some bands are available globally and some bands are only available in some
specific regions, and some bands may be made available after the completion of
this study [32].
Follow the NR design principles, from RAN1 design perspective, this NR-U study
is not limited to a particular unlicensed band. Instead, the target NR-U
design is applicable to a set of frequency ranges to be further defined. There
is no prioritization between unlicensed bands. On the other hand, the NR-U
study does not target sub-1 GHz unlicensed bands, due to the lack of spectrum
in the band to support efficient NR-U operation.
# 6 Deployment scenarios
This section describes possible deployment scenarios for NR-U.
Five deployment scenarios have been identified:
\- Scenario A: Carrier aggregation between licensed band NR (PCell) and NR-U
(SCell)
> \- NR-U SCell may have both DL and UL, or DL-only.
\- Scenario B: Dual connectivity between licensed band LTE (PCell) and NR-U
(PSCell)
\- Scenario C: Stand-alone NR-U
\- Scenario D: An NR cell with DL in unlicensed band and UL in licensed band
\- Scenario E: Dual connectivity between licensed band NR (PCell) and NR-U
(PSCell)
# 7 Design targets, functionalities and solutions
In the discussions in the NR-U study item, references to sub-7 GHz are
intended to include unlicensed bands in the 6 GHz region that are being
discussed in regulatory discussions which may have some region exceeding 7 GHz
(e.g., 7.125 GHz).
## 7.1 Design targets and functionalities
The NR-U study targets identification of additional functionality needed for a
PHY layer design (except channel access procedures) for operation in
unlicensed spectrum that may be applicable over a particular frequency range
(e.g., sub-7 GHz, 7-52.6 GHz, > 52.6 GHz). The definition of the frequency
ranges is to be further defined. On the other hand, the optimizations for a
particular frequency band may be necessary due to different requirements, such
as PSD limitation or OCB requirement, for each band. Channel bandwidths below
5 MHz are not targeted in this study.
The study targets the design of channel access procedures for frequency bands
based on coexistence and regulatory considerations applicable to the band. The
study includes identification of procedures for technology neutral channel
access for frequency bands that may become available subject to regulations.
The study assumes regulation will provide the framework concerning the
protection for the technologies not using unlicensed access in those bands.
## 7.2 Solutions for operation in unlicensed spectrum
### 7.2.1 Physical layer aspects
According to the study item description [30], physical channels inheriting the
choices of duplex mode, waveform, carrier bandwidth, subcarrier spacing, frame
structure, and physical layer design made as part of the NR study and avoiding
unnecessary divergence with decisions made in the NR WI.
NR-U supports both Type-A and Type-B mapping already supported in NR.
Initial active DL/UL BWP is approximately 20MHz for 5GHz band, though the
final value will be quantized to number of PRBs. Initial active DL/UL BWP is
approximately 20MHz for 6GHz band if similar channelization as 5GHz band is
used for 6GHz band.
#### 7.2.1.1 Frame structure
Single and multiple DL to UL and UL to DL switching points within a shared gNB
COT is identified to be beneficial and can be supported. LBT requirements to
support single or multiple switching points has been identified (Section
7.2.1.3.1).
For NR-U DL operation, it is identified that being able to operate all DL
signal/channels with the same numerology for a carrier and at least for intra-
band CA on serving cells on unlicensed bands has at least the following
benefits (at least for standalone operation)
\- Lower implementation complexity (e.g., a single FFT, no switching gaps)
\- Lower specification impact
\- No need for gaps for measurements on frequencies with a configured serving
cell in unlicensed bands
For NR-U UL operation, it is identified that being able to operate all UL
signal/channels (except PRACH) with the same numerology for a carrier and at
least for intra-band CA on serving cells on unlicensed bands has at least the
following benefits:
\- Lower implementation complexity (e.g., a single FFT, no switching gaps)
\- Lower specification impact
\- Common interlace structure
\- No need for gaps for transmission of SRS on a configured serving cell in
unlicensed bands
For unlicensed PCell, the UE assumes single SSB numerology per band.
It has been identified to be beneficial for the NR-U design to not require the
gNB to change a pre-determined TBS for a PDSCH transmission depending on the
LBT outcome, at least when the PDSCH is transmitted at the beginning of the
gNB\'s COT.
The following options have been identified as possible candidates for PDSCH
transmission in the partial slot at least for the first PDSCH(s) transmitted
in the DL transmission burst. The options are not mutually exclusive.
\- Option 1: PDSCH(s) as in Rel-15 NR
\- Option 2: Punctured PDSCH depending on LBT outcome
\- Option 3: PDSCH mapping type B with durations other than 2/4/7 symbols
\- Option 4: PDSCH across slot boundary
In addition to the functionalities provided by DCI format 2_0 in Rel-15 NR,
indication of the COT structure in the time domain has been identified as
being beneficial.
It has been identified to be beneficial for the NR-U design to not require the
UE to change a granted TBS for a PUSCH transmission depending on the LBT
outcome.
The following options have been identified as possible candidate at least for
the first PUSCH(s) transmitted in the UL transmission burst.
\- Option 1: PUSCH(s) as in Rel-15 NR
\- Option 2: Multiple starting positions in one or multiple slot(s) are
allowed for PUSCH(s) scheduled by a single UL grant (i.e., not a configured
grant) and one of the multiple PUSCH starting positions can be decided
depending on LBT outcome.
It is noted that for above options, the ending position of the PUSCH is fixed
as indicated by the UL grant.
It is noted that above options are not mutually exclusive.
It has been identified that FBE operation for the scenario where it is
guaranteed that LBE nodes are absent on a long term basis (e.g., by level of
regulation) and FBE gNBs are synchronized can achieve the following: Ability
to use frequency reuse factor 1; Lower complexity for channel access due to
lack of necessity to perform random backoff.
It is noted that this does not imply that LBE does not have benefits in
similar scenarios although there are differences between the two modes of
operation. It is also noted that FBE may also have some disadvantages compared
to other modes of operation such as LBE, e.g., a fixed overhead for idle time
during a frame.
For wideband operation for both DL and UL,
\- Bandwidth larger than 20 MHz can be supported with multiple serving cells.
\- NR-U should support that a serving cell can be configured with bandwidth
larger than 20 MHz.
For DL operation, the following options for BWP-based operation within a
carrier with bandwidth larger than 20 MHz can be considered.
\- Option 1a: Multiple BWPs configured, multiple BWPs activated, transmission
of PDSCH on one or more BWPs
\- Option 1b: Multiple BWPs configured, multiple BWPs activated, transmission
of PDSCH on single BWP
\- Option 2: Multiple BWPs can be configured, single BWP activated, gNB
transmits PDSCH on a single BWP if CCA is successful at gNB for the whole BWP
\- Option 3: Multiple BWPs can be configured, single BWP activated, gNB
transmits PDSCH on parts or whole of single BWP where CCA is successful at gNB
For UL operation, the following options for BWP-based operation within a
carrier with bandwidth larger than 20 MHz can be considered.
\- Option 1a: Multiple BWPs configured, multiple BWPs activated, transmission
of PUSCH on one or more BWPs
\- Option 1b: Multiple BWPs configured, multiple BWPs activated, transmission
of PUSCH on single BWP
\- Option 2: Multiple BWPs can be configured, single BWP activated, UE
transmits PUSCH on a single BWP if CCA is successful at UE for the whole BWP
\- Option 3: Multiple BWPs can be configured, single BWP activated, UE
transmits PUSCH on parts or whole of single BWP where CCA is successful at UE
It is noted that CCA is declared to be successful or not in multiples of 20
MHz.
Detailed design and potential selection from the above options can be further
discussed when specifications are developed considering protocol and RF
aspects.
#### 7.2.1.2 Physical layer channel designs
For physical layer channel design, NR design will be used as baseline, and the
following potential design changes are to be studied to support the following
channels/signals in NR-U.
\- PDCCH/PDSCH
\- PUCCH/PUSCH
\- PSS/SSS/PBCH
\- PRACH
\- DL and UL reference signals applicable to the operational frequency range
For SS/PBCH block transmission, extended CP is not supported for NR-U
operation.
For PSS/SSS/PBCH transmission, NR-U should have a signal that contains at
least SS/PBCH block burst set transmission. The design of this signal should
consider the following characteristics specific to unlicensed band operation:
\- There are no gaps within the time span the signal is transmitted at least
within a beam
\- The occupied channel bandwidth is satisfied (although this may not be a
requirement)
\- Strive to minimize the channel occupancy time of the signal
\- Characteristics that may facilitate fast channel access
Inclusion of the CSI-RS and RMSI-CORESET(s)+PDSCH(s) (carrying RMSI)
associated with SS/PBCH block(s) in addition to the SS/PBCH burst set in one
contiguous burst (referred to as the NR-U DRS) can be beneficial for
\- Meeting OCB requirement
\- Compacting signals in time domain to limit the required number of channel
access and for short channel occupancy
\- Support of stand-alone NR-U deployments
\- Support of automatic neighbour relations (ANR) functionality in an NR-U
deployment
\- Resolution of PCI confusion in an NR-U deployment
The transmission of additional signals such as OSI and paging within the NR-U
DRS is allowed and can be beneficial.
Support of Pattern 1 is recommended for multiplexing of SS/PBCH block(s) and
CORESET(s)#0 in NR-U, where Pattern 1 is understood as CORESET#0 and an
SS/PBCH block occuring in different time instances, and the CORESET#0
bandwidth overlaping with the transmission bandwidth of the SS/PBCH block.
As one element to facilitate a NR-U DRS design without gaps in the time
domain, the CORESET#0 configuration(s) and/or Type0-PDCCH common search space
configuration(s) may need enhancements compared to NR Rel-15, such as
additional time domain configurations of the common search space(s).
The detection of a gNB\'s transmission burst by the UE has been studied, and
concerns on the UE power consumption required for Tx burst detection e.g. if
the UE needs to frequently detect/monitor the PDCCH have been raised. The
proposals that have been made by contributions regarding these topics include
existing NR signal(s) with potential enhancement(s), a channel such as PDCCH
with potential enhancement(s), and the 802.11a/802.11ax preamble with
potential enhancement(s); consensus was not achieved on any of these
proposals. The detection/decoding reliability of each of the proposals has not
been sufficiently evaluated for a complete evaluation of the proposals against
each other. The power consumption and detection/decoding complexity of each of
the proposals have not been sufficiently evaluated for a complete evaluation
of the proposals against each other. The relation of a proposal with C-DRX
and/or measurement gap(s) may need further consideration when specifications
are being developed.
Compared to NR Rel-15, it has been identified to be beneficial if the time
domain instances in which the UE is expected to receive PDCCH can change
dynamically, e.g. by implicit determination related to the gNB\'s COT, or
explicitly signalled by the gNB.
For UL waveform for PUSCH, PUCCH, and PRACH, it has been identified that an
interlaced waveform can have benefits in some scenarios including link budget
limited cases with given PSD constraint, and as one option to efficiently meet
the occupied channel bandwidth requirement.
On the other hand, it is RAN1\'s understanding that the temporal allowance of
not meeting occupied channel bandwidth by regulation can be exploited if the
minimum bandwidth requirement, e.g., 2 MHz, is satisfied. Therefore, a
waveform contiguous in frequency may be adequate in some scenarios, which
implies that Release 15 NR contiguous allocation designs can be used for NR-U
as well.
Support for Rel-15 NR PUSCH can be considered. However, it has been identified
that block-interlaced based PUSCH can be beneficial.
Support for Rel-15 NR PUCCH formats can be considered, however, not
necessarily all Release 15 NR PUCCH formats are applicable to NR-U. It has
been identified that legacy PUCCH formats PF2 and PF3 are beneficial for NR-U
for the scenario of contiguous allocations due to the fact that they may be
configured with bandwidth that meets the minimum temporal allowance of 2 MHz
(12/6/3 PRBs for 15/30/60 kHz SCS). It has been identified that legacy PUCCH
formats PF0/1/4 are not well-suited for NR-U for the scenario of contiguous
allocations since they support only single PRB.
When new block interlace waveform for PUCCH is to be defined, it is beneficial
to use the same block interlace structure for PUCCH and PUSCH.
It has been identified that enhancement of one or more legacy PUCCH formats is
feasible to support block interlaced PUCCH transmission. There is consensus
that enhanced PUCCH with both short and long duration is beneficial for NR-U;
however, no consensus has been achieved about which legacy PUCCH format(s)
should be the starting point for an enhanced PUCCH design. Some sources
suggest introducing just one or two new enhanced PUCCH formats, while other
sources suggest enhancing all or almost all legacy PUCCH formats
(PF0,1,2,3,4). Regardless of which format(s) is(are) chosen as a starting
point for enhancement, the following common aspects have been identified as
important to consider in the detailed design of the enhanced PUCCH format(s)
when specifications are developed:
\- Flexible number of OFDM symbols
\- Short duration, e.g., 1 or 2 OFDM symbols
\- Long duration, e.g., 4 -- 14 OFDM symbols
\- Flexible UCI payload
\- Small payload, e.g., 1 or 2 bit
\- Larger payloads, e.g., > 2 bits
\- Coding of UCI payload, e.g.,
\- Extend legacy (NR Rel-15) PUCCH encoder to handle small payloads
\- Repetition of coded UCI bits across PRBs of an interlace
\- UCI Codebits over all PRBs, i.e. no repetition coding.
\- Number of supported PUCCH formats
\- Support for user multiplexing of both UCI payload and DMRS on an interlace,
e.g.,
\- OCCs
\- Cyclic shifts
\- FDM within an interlace
\- Multiplexing method of UCI payload and DMRS, e.g,
\- TDM
\- FDM
\- Mechanism to control PAPR, e.g.,
\- OCC cycling
\- Bit level processing
\- PRB level processing
\- Sequence hopping
\- PUCCH waveform, e.g.,
\- CP-OFDM
\- DFT-s-OFDM
\- Performance, e.g.,
\- Required SNR to achieve a target BLER
\- Required SNR to achieve target ACK to NACK rate, NACK to ACK rate and DTX
to ACK rate
\- Coverage considering CM/PAPR
Support for Rel-15 NR PRACH formats can be considered, however, not
necessarily all Release 15 NR PRACH formats are applicable to NR-U. It is
RAN1\'s understanding that certain formats do not meet the minimum bandwidth
requirement by regulation. Exclusion of the support of certain formats is to
be identified.
It is identified that interlaced based PRACH can be beneficial.
It has been identified that enhancement of one or more legacy PRACH formats is
feasible for NR-U. Four potential design alternatives, including no
interlacing, have been identified for the frequency mapping of PRACH sequences
for NR-U, where consensus on which one(s) to support for NR-U has not yet been
achieved:
\- Alt-1: Uniform PRB-level interlace mapping
\- In this approach a PRACH sequence for a particular PRACH occasion is mapped
to all of the PRBs of one or more of the interlaces in the PRB-based block
interlace structure. Within a PRB, either all or a subset of REs are used.
Different PRACH occasions are defined using an orthogonal set of PRBs, or an
orthogonal set of REs within the PRBs, from one or more same/different
interlaces.
\- It has been identified that a uniform mapping (equal spacing of PRBs) in
the frequency domain produces a zero-autocorrelation zone, of which the
duration is inversely proportional to the frequency spacing between the PRBs.
\- Alt-2: Non-uniform PRB-level interlace mapping
\- In this approach a PRACH sequence for a particular PRACH occasion is mapped
to some or all of the PRBs of one or more of the interlaces in the same PRB-
based block interlace structure used for PUSCH/PUCCH. Within a PRB, either all
or a subset of REs are used. Different PRACH occasions are defined using an
orthogonal set of PRBs, or an orthogonal set of REs within the PRBs, from one
or more same/different interlaces.
\- It has been identified that an irregular mapping (non-equal spacing of
PRBs/REs) in the frequency domain reduces the false peaks in the PRACH
preamble auto-correlation function.
\- Alt-3: Uniform RE-level interlace mapping
\- In this approach, a PRACH sequence for a particular PRACH occasion consists
of a \"comb-like\" mapping in the frequency domain with equal spacing between
all used REs. Different PRACH occasions are defined by way of different comb
offsets.
\- Since this approach does not fit with the common PUSCH/PUCCH interlace
structure, one source suggests that only TDM multiplexing of PUSCH/PUCCH and
PRACH should be supported. Another source suggests that puncturing/rate
matching PUSCH/PUCCH around the used PRACH REs may be used.
\- Alt-4: Non-interlaced mapping
\- In this approach, a PRACH sequence for a particular PRACH occasion is
mapped to a number of contiguous PRBs, same or similar to NR Rel-15.
\- Some sources propose that to fulfill the minimum OCB requirement, that the
PRACH sequence is mapped to a set of contiguous PRBs, and the PRACH sequence
mapping is repeated across the frequency domain, potentially with guard
RE(s)/PRB(s) between repetitions. For each repetition, a different cyclic
shift or different base sequence may or may not be applied.
It has been identified that the long PRACH sequence length defined in NR
Rel-15 (L = 839) is not beneficial for NR-U, since PRACH formats based on this
length are tailored toward large cells not expected in an NR-U deployment.
However, when it comes to shorter sequence lengths, some sources propose
reusing the short sequence length (L = 139) defined in NR-Rel-15, whereas
other sources propose defining new sequence lengths depending on which of the
4 alternatives above is supported.
It has been identified that the following common design attributes need to be
considered in the detailed design of an interlaced PRACH waveform for 4-step
random access for NR-U when specifications are developed:
\- Multiplexing of PRACH and PUSCH/PUCCH, considering block interlaced
structure used for PUSCH/PUCCH, e.g.,
\- FDM
\- TDM
\- Supported PRACH sequence and PRACH sequence length(s)
\- PRACH capacity
\- Number of PRACH preambles per cell
\- Number of root sequences
\- Number of cyclic shifts
\- Number of PRACH occasions
\- Maximum supported Tx power
\- PAPR/CM
\- Number of PRACH formats
\- Simulation assumptions for evaluation of performance, e.g.,
\- Single vs. multi-cell assumptions
\- Performance metrics
\- Timing estimation error
\- Miss-detection probability
\- False-detection probability
\- False-alarm probability
For scenarios in which a block-interlaced waveform is used for PUCCH/PUSCH, it
has been identified that from FDM-based user-multiplexing standpoint it can be
beneficial to have UL channels on a common interlace structure, at least for
PUSCH, PUCCH, associated DMRS, and potentially PRACH
On the other hand, for scenarios in which a contiguous allocation for PUSCH
and PUCCH is used, it is beneficial to use contiguous resource allocation for
PRACH
For scenarios in which a block-interlaced waveform is used for UL
transmission, a PRB-based block-interlace design has been identified as
beneficial at least for 15 and 30 kHz SCS, and potentially for 60 kHz SCS. One
identified benefit is better link budget with given PSD constraint. However,
it has been observed that power boosting gains decrease with increasing SCS.
Another identified benefit is as one option to efficiently meet the occupied
channel bandwidth requirement. Compared with sub-PRB interlace design, the
PRB-based block-interlace design has comparatively less specification impact.
For sub-PRB block interlace designs, in some scenarios, sub-PRB block
interlacing can be beneficial in terms of power boosting. However, the sub-PRB
block interlace design has at least the following specification impacts:
Reference signal design (e.g., DMRS); Channel estimation aspects; Resource
allocation.
Both PRB and sub-PRB interlacing for 60 kHz have been studied. For sub-PRB
interlacing the following aspects have been considered:
\- Power boosting potential depending on resource allocation size
\- PUSCH DMRS configuration aspects
\- Channel estimation performance
\- Number of REs per interlace unit
It has been identified as beneficial to support a block-interlaced structure
in which the number of interlaces (M) decreases with increasing SCS, and the
nominal number of PRBs per interlace (N) is similar for each SCS (in a given
bandwidth) at least for 15 and 30 kHz SCS, and potentially 60 kHz depending on
supported interlace design.
From a RAN1 perspective it has been identified that supporting a non-uniform
interlace structure in which the number of PRBs per interlace is allowed to be
different for different interlaces is beneficial from a spectrum utilization
point of view. It is up to RAN4 to investigate whether or not the non-uniform
interlace structure has an impact on MPR/A-MPR requirements for PUSCH.
Within a 20 MHz bandwidth, the following candidate PRB-based interlace designs
have been identified where M is the number of interlaces and N is the number
of PRBs per interlace in a 20 MHz bandwidth. Where two values are listed for
N, it means that some interlaces have one more PRB than others (non-uniform
interlace design)
SCS M N
* * *
15 kHz 12 8 or 9 10 10 or 11 8 13 or 14 30 kHz 6 8 or 9 5 10 or 11 4 12 or 13
60 kHz 4 6 3 8 2 12 60 kHz (if 26 PRBs is supported in a 20 MHz bandwidth) 4 6
or 7 2 13 3 8 or 9
For carriers with bandwidth larger than 20 MHz, two candidate interlace
designs have been identified:
\- Alt-1: Same interlace spacing for all interlaces regardless of carrier BW.
This alternative uses Point A as a reference for the interlace definition
\- Alt-2: Interlacing defined on a sub-band (20 MHz) basis. (Note: Possible
interlace spacing discontinuity at edges of sub-band).
Additional candidates have been identified, but consensus has not been
achieved, e.g., (1) for carriers with bandwidth larger than 20 MHz, retain the
same number of PRBs per interlace (N) for all interlaces regardless of carrier
BW; (2) Partial interlace allocation. Detailed design can be further discussed
when specifications are developed taking RF aspects into account.
It has been identified that support of different numerology candidates at
least has the following specification impacts:
\- For PRB-based block-interlace design for 15, 30, and 60 kHz SCS, the
following spec impacts have been identified: Number of interlaces and number
of PRBs per interlace need to be defined; the resource allocation mechanism
needs to be defined; channel estimation aspects need to be considered, such as
impact on PRG. In addition to the above impact, for sub-PRB-based block-
interlace design for 60 kHz SCS, reference signal design (such as DMRS) needs
to be revisited and alternative resource allocation mechanism is needed.
\- For NR-U DRS design for 15 and 30 kHz SCS, the SS/PBCH block time domain
pattern is already supported in Rel-15. For 60 kHz SCS, there is no SS/PBCH
block time domain pattern defined in Rel-15. SS/PBCH block to CORESET
configuration tables (38.213 Section 13) need to be defined as well.
\- For PRACH design for 15, 30, and 60 kHz SCS, signalling mechanism of RACH
configuration indicating PRACH numerology may need modification to support
more than two numerologies for PRACH for NR-U.
It has been identified as beneficial for NR-U to introduce additional
flexibility in configuring/triggering SRS compared to NR Rel-15. The following
candidate enhancements have been discussed; design details can be further
discussed when specifications are developed:
\- Additional OFDM symbol locations for an SRS resource within a slot other
than the last 6 symbols
\- Interlaced waveform
\- Additional flexibility in frequency domain configuration
It may be beneficial to apply restrictions on the use of DFT-s-OFDM in NR-U to
avoid significant design efforts specific to operation in unlicensed spectrum.
#### 7.2.1.3 Physical layer procedure designs
##### 7.2.1.3.1 Channel access procedures
If absence of Wi-Fi cannot be guaranteed (e.g. by regulation) in the band
(sub-7 GHz) where NR-U is operating, the baseline assumption is, the NR-U
operating bandwidth is an integer multiple of 20MHz.
Channel access mechanisms need to comply with regulations and may therefore
need to be adapted for particular frequency ranges.
For channel access mechanism, LTE-LAA LBT mechanism is adopted as baseline for
5GHz band and adopted as the starting point of the design for 6GHz band. At
least for band where absence of Wi-Fi cannot be guaranteed (e.g. by
regulation), LBT can be performed in units of 20 MHz.
For 5GHz band, having a 16 µs gap to accommodate for the transceiver
turnaround before the immediate transmission of the responding node is
beneficial for NR-U, such as for supporting fast A/N feedback, and is
permitted per regulation. Restrictions/conditions on when this option can be
used will be further identified, e.g., in consideration of fair coexistence.
A 16 µs gap to accommodate for the transceiver turnaround before the immediate
transmission of the responding node can also be applied to 6GHz band if
allowed by regulation, and restrictions/conditions on when this option can be
used will be further identified, if fair coexistence criterion is defined for
6GHz band.
For CWS adjustment procedure in NR-U, in addition to aspects considered in LTE
LAA, NR-U may additionally consider at least the following aspects: CBG based
HARQ-ACK operation, NR scheduling and HARQ-feedback delays and processing
times, wideband (>20 MHz) operation including BWPs, Configured grant
operation.For initiation of a COT by the gNB (operating as an LBE device), the
channel access schemes in Table 7.2.1.3.1-1 are used.
Table 7.2.1.3.1-1: Channel access schemes for initiating a COT by gNB as LBE
device
                                                                           Cat 2 LBT                                                                                                  Cat 4 LBT

DRS alone or multiplexed with non-unicast data (e.g. OSI, paging, RAR) When
the DRS duty cycle ≤1/20, and the total duration is up to 1 ms: 25 µs Cat 2

Note below Channel access priority class is selected according to the
multiplexed data PDCCH and PDSCH N/A except for the cases discussed in the
Note below Channel access priority class is selected according to the

Note: Applicability of an LBT scheme other than Cat 4 LBT for control messages
related to initial/random access, mobility, paging, reference signals only,
and PDCCH-only transmissions, e.g. \"RACH message 4\", handover command, GC-
PDCCH, or short message paging transmitted either alone or when multiplexed
with DRS have been discussed. Further details related to exceptions in this
note can be determined when specifications are developed.
At least for the case where a DL burst follows a UL burst within a gNB-
initiated COT and there is no gap larger than 25 µs between any two
transmissions in the COT, the channel access schemes in Table 7.2.1.3.1-2
apply for the DL burst following a UL burst.
Table 7.2.1.3.1-2: Channel access schemes for a DL burst follows a UL burst
within a gNB-initiated COT as LBE device

* * *
When the gap from the end of the scheduled UL transmission to the beginning of
the DL burst is up to 16 μsec When the gap from the end of the scheduled UL
transmission to the beginning of the DL burst is larger than 16 μsec but not
more than 25 µsec
Note: a DL burst is defined as a set of transmissions from a given gNB having
no gaps or gaps of no more than 16 µs. Transmissions from a gNB having a gap
of more than 16 µs are considered as separate DL bursts.
Within a gNB-initiated COT, an UL burst for a UE consisting of one or more of
PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, and SRS follows the channel access schemes in Table
7.2.1.3.1-3.
Table 7.2.1.3.1-3: Channel access schemes for a UL burst within a gNB-

Note: An UL burst is defined as a set of transmissions from a given UE having
no gaps or gaps of no more than 16 µs. Transmissions from a UE having a gap of
more than 16 µs are considered as separate UL bursts. The number of LBT
attempts within a COT should be determined when specifications are developed.
For initiation of a COT by the UE, the channel access schemes in Table
7.2.1.3.1-4 are used.

PUSCH (including at least UL-SCH with user plane data) N/A except for the
cases discussed in Note 2 below Channel access priority class is selected
according to the data SRS-only N/A Cat4 with lowest channel access priority
class value (as in LTE eLAA) RACH-only (see Note 2) Cat4 with lowest channel
access priority class value PUCCH-only (see Note 2) Cat4 with lowest channel
access priority class value
Note 1: If the COT includes multiple signals/channels with different channel
access categories / priority classes, the highest channel access priority
class value and highest channel access category among the channel access
priority classes and channel access categories corresponding to the multiple
signals/channels applies.
Note 2: Applicability of a channel access scheme other than Cat 4 for the
following signals / channels have been discussed and details are to be
determined when the specifications are developed:
\- UL control information including UCI only on PUSCH, e.g. HARQ-ACK,
Scheduling Request, and Channel State Information
\- Random Access
For FBE mode of operation, gNB acquires COT with Cat2 immediately prior to the
fixed frame period. Within the gNB acquired COT, if a gap is \ 16 μs, Cat 2 channel access scheme should be
used by the gNB and associated UEs. Note this channel access mechanisms are
intended to be aligned with any regulations for FBE operation.
Means to reduce or mitigate the impact of interference e.g. from hidden nodes
with UE assistance have been studied. Possible mechanisms include at least
enhancements to L1 measurement and reporting of interference observed by a UE,
and handshaking procedures between transmitter and the receiver. Further
consideration is required regarding the detailed solutions and their benefits
for mitigation of impact of interference on NR-U when the specifications are
to be developed.
Means to facilitate spatial reuse, or frequency reuse 1 operation of NR-U have
been studied. Possible mechanisms include at least: alignment of starting
points for transmission (and consequently time instances for at least the last
CCA); exchange and coordination of LBT related parameters amongst different
NR-U gNBs or UEs; means to determine whether interference originates from
other NR-U nodes; enhancements to L1 measurement and reporting of interference
observed by a UE; and adjustment of energy/signal detection thresholds.
Further consideration is required regarding the detailed solutions and their
benefits for facilitating spatial reuse in NR-U when the specifications are to
be developed, taking into account regulations.
Channel access mechanisms for beamformed transmissions have been studied. It
has been identified that omni-directional LBT should be supported. Using
directional LBT for beamformed transmissions, i.e. LBT performed in the
direction of the transmitted beam has also been studied. Further consideration
is required regarding directional LBT and its benefits for beamformed
transmissions when the specifications are to be developed, taking into account
regulations and fair co-existence with other technologies.
##### 7.2.1.3.2 Initial access and mobility
For initial access and mobility procedures, the main issue identified for NR
operation in unlicensed band is the reduced transmission opportunities for
different signals and channels due to LBT failure.
The following modifications to initial access procedures have been identified
as beneficial:
\- Modifications to initial access procedures considering limitations on
access to the channel based on LBT. NR-U needs to develop techniques to handle
reduced SS/PBCH block and RMSI transmission opportunities due to LBT failure.
\- Enhancement to 4-step RACH, including developing mechanisms to handle
reduced msg 1/2/3/4 transmission opportunities due to LBT failure.
It is also identified that a 2-step RACH procedure potentially has benefit for
channel access.
For SS/PBCH block transmission, it is recommended to define a mechanism to
transmit SS/PBCH blocks dropped due to LBT failure. It is also recommended to
define a mechanism when specifications are developed for UE(s) to determine
the frame timing and QCL assumptions from the detected SS/PBCH block. The
feasibility and benefits of beam repetition for soft combining reception of
SSBs within the same DRS transmission may be further considered.
For SS/PBCH block transmissions as part of DRS, it is considered beneficial to
expand the maximum number of candidate SS/PBCH block positions within the DRS
transmission window to Y, for e.g., Y ≤ 64, where the choice of Y may depend
on the numerology of the SS/PBCH blocks. The transmitted SS/PBCH blocks do not
overlap and the maximum number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks is X within DRS
transmission window with X ≤ 8. The time-domain positions of the actually
transmitted SS/PBCH blocks are selected from a set of Y candidate SS/PBCH
block positions. Proposals for shift granularity between candidate time domain
SSB positions/candidate groups of SSBs, duration of DRS transmission window,
and duration of the transmitted DRS within the window including SSBs and other
multiplexed signals/channels, were discussed without reaching consensus, and
can be considered further when specifications are developed.
Modifications to paging procedures due to reduced transmission opportunities
for paging due to LBT failure are beneficial and have been identified and
studied. It is therefore considered beneficial to enhance paging opportunities
using the following mechanism:
\- Increased time-domain paging occasions or paging monitoring occasions.
\- This can enable additional paging occasions outside of DRS.
Note: Parts or all of the above enhancement may fall under the purview of
higher-layer enhancements and may not require any further study from a L1
perspective
For potential RACH resource enhancements, the following options have been
identified for NR-U, beyond the flexibility already available in Rel-15, but
consensus was not achieved. These options may be further considered when
specifications are developed:
\- Frequency-domain enhancement: Multiple PRACH resources across multiple LBT
sub-bands/carriers for both contention-free and contention-based RA
\- Time-domain enhancements:
\- For connected mode UE, scheduling of PRACH resources via DCI.
\- Triggered PRACH within gNB acquired COT can use a new resource indicated by
the DCI
\- For idle mode UE, scheduling of PRACH resources via paging
\- Note: potential inefficiency in network resource due to paging across
multiple cells
\- Additional, new RACH resources are used immediately following detection of
DRS transmission
\- Multiple PRACH transmissions before Msg2 reception in RAR window for
initial access
\- Number of allowed transmissions is pre-defined or indicated, e.g., in RMSI
\- Group wise SSB-to-RO mapping by frequency first-time second manner, where
grouping is in time domain
For msg1 transmission of 4-step RACH procedure, if preamble transmissions are
dropped due to LBT failure, then from RAN1 perspective, it is recommended that
preamble power ramping is not performed and that the preamble transmission
counter is not incremented.
For msg 2 transmission in the 4-step RACH procedure, in some scenarios it is
beneficial for the maximum RAR window size to be extended beyond 10 ms to
improve robustness to DL LBT failure for RAR transmission. Other candidate
mechanisms that were identified without reaching consensus include
preconfigured/pre-indicated/scheduled multiple opportunities in time and/or
frequency domain in different LBT subbands for message 2/3/4 transmissions
and/or reducing the latency of the RACH procedure and can be considered
further when specifications are to be developed.
Potential modifications to RLM/RRM procedures due to reduced transmission
opportunities for DL signals and channels due to LBT failure have been
identified and studied.
For RLM on an unlicensed SpCell and RRM, it is considered beneficial to
configure DMTCs (DRS Measurement Time Configuration) in which UEs can perform
measurements. It is considered beneficial that these time-domain measurement
windows for RRM measurements and RLM can be different. RLM DMTC may coincide
with DRS transmission window. For RLM, the following recommendations are
considered beneficial for further design when the specifications are
developed:
\- Identifying a set of RLM-RS, e.g., DRS, SS/PBCH blocks, CSI-RS. The
transmission of the RS in a COT may be subject to LBT.
\- Identifying which set(s) of RLM-RS are used for in-sync and out-of-sync
evaluations. For example, determining which RLM-RS within or outside the RLM
measurement window can be utilized for in-sync and out-of-sync evaluations.
\- Potential definition of a metric, e.g., Rel-15 out-of-sync indication or
new metric, to accurately identify instances of unsuccessful detection of RLM-
RS. Whether/how to report such a metric to higher layers is determined when
the specifications are developed.
It is beneficial to support reporting of RSSI. Furthermore, it is considered
beneficial to report a metric to represent channel occupancy or medium
contention in addition to RSSI, as also noted from a higher-layer perspective
in Section 7.2.2.3.1. The exact definition of the metric(s) can be considered
when specifications are developed.
##### 7.2.1.3.3 Potential HARQ enhancements
NR-U uses NR HARQ feedback mechanisms as baseline, and enhancements can be
identified.
Transmission of HARQ A/N for the corresponding data in the same shared COT is
identified as beneficial. For NR-U, the design strives to support transmitting
all HARQ A/N for the corresponding data in the same shared COT, if possible,
considering the current NR UE processing time required. A gap of up to 16 μs
should be allowed between the end of the DL transmission and the immediate
transmission of feedback to accommodate for the hardware turnaround time. It
is beneficial to be able to support transmissions (e.g. CSI reporting or SRS,
or other PUSCH, or CSI-RS, or other PDSCH) in the time between one DL data
transmission for a UE and the corresponding UL transmission of DL HARQ
feedback for the same UE within a shared COT. Potential enhancements for such
type of operation, e.g. by possibly pre-configured or pre-determined uplink
transmissions for reducing signaling overhead for these transmissions, may be
beneficial.
However, it is understood in some cases, the HARQ A/N has to be transmitted in
a separate COT from the one the corresponding data was transmitted.
**Introduce** signaling a value of the **PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing-indicator in the
DCI scheduling the PDSCH that tells the UE that the timing and resource for
HARQ-ACK feedback for the corresponding PDSCH will be determined later.**
Techniques to handle reduced HARQ A/N transmission opportunities for a given
HARQ process due to LBT failure are identified as beneficial. Potential
techniques include mechanisms to provide multiple and/or supplemental time
and/or frequency domain transmission opportunities.
When UL HARQ feedback is transmitted on unlicensed band, NR-U considers
mechanisms to support flexible triggering and multiplexing of HARQ feedback
for one or more DL HARQ processes
NR-U should support both the HARQ feedback corresponding to some or all the
PDSCHs of a channel occupancy can be reported in the same channel occupancy
and HARQ feedback corresponding to PDSCHs of a channel occupancy can be
reported outside of that channel occupancy.
To support the HARQ feedback corresponding to some or all the PDSCHs of a
channel occupancy to be reported in the same channel occupancy, **it is found
beneficial to extend the PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing to support indicating timings up
to the end of the longest COT allowed by regulations. One or more of the
following would be needed: Allow values larger than 15 by RRC signalling;
Allow more bits for the PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing-indicator.**
To support HARQ feedback corresponding to PDSCHs of a channel occupancy can be
reported outside of that channel occupancy, the following possible candidate
solutions can be considered:
\- Alt1: gNB requests/triggers feedback for PDSCH from earlier COT(s)
\- Alt2: UE is configured to report HARQ feedback for PDSCH from earlier
COT(s) without an explicit request/trigger
\- Alt3: by PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing-indicator in the DCI scheduling the PDSCH
**The alternatives above are at least applicable for the case where there is
no HARQ feedback expected in the same channel occupancy as the PDSCH.**
Further details on potential solutions to allow cross-COT HARQ-ACK feedback
and multiple opportunities for HARQ-ACK feedback are provided in Table
7.2.1.3.3-1.
Table 7.2.1.3.3-1: Possible alternatives to support multiple HARQ-ACK

**A possible enhancement for dynamic HARQ codebook is to support a larger DAI
field to accommodate for possibly missing more than 4 PDSCH transmissions,
which is more likely to occur on unlicensed spectrum.** Enhancements are
necessary for aligning the dynamic HARQ codebook between UE and gNB**. Alt.
1** in Table 7.2.1.3.3-1 allows triggering/requesting a report for missed or
unreported HARQ-ACK feedback in case of LBT failure for PUCCH/PUSCH
transmission, or in case of PUCCH/PUSCH detection failure at gNB, or in case
of PDCCH detection failure at UE, or in case of HARQ-ACK feedback pending from
earlier COT(s)**.** Alt. 2 in the table allows reporting unreported HARQ-ACK
feedback in case of LBT failure for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission, or in case of
HARQ-ACK feedback pending from earlier COT(s).
Scheduling multiple TTIs for PUSCH each using a separate UL grant in the same
PDCCH monitoring occasion is identified as beneficial. Scheduling multiple
TTIs for PUSCH, i.e., scheduling multiple TBs with different HARQ process IDs
over multiple slots, using a single UL grant, is identified as beneficial and
should be supported in NR-U.
In case of CBG-based HARQ and LBT category 4, enhancements for defining how to
adjust the contention window size (CWS) based on TB-level HARQ-ACK and CBG-
level HARQ-ACK would be beneficial.
##### 7.2.1.3.4 Potential enhancements to configured grant
NR already defined Type-1 and Type-2 configured grant mechanism. For NR-U,
there is no necessity to exclude Type-1 or Type-2 configured grant mechanism
for operation of NR in unlicensed spectrum.
The following modifications to the configured grant procedures are beneficial.
\- Removing dependencies of HARQ process information to the timing. This can
be achieved by introducing UCI on PUSCH to carry HARQ process ID, NDI, RVID
\- Additional information fields can be considered to be included in the UCI,
e.g. UE-ID, COT sharing information, PUSCH duration, etc.
\- It was identified that the resources utilized by the UCI, and multiplexing
of UCI and data information of PUSCH require consideration of DMRS placement
and starting and ending symbols of the configured grant based transmissions.
Details on multiplexing UCI and data information of configured grant PUSCH can
be determined when specifications are developed.
\- Introducing Downlink Feedback Information (DFI) including HARQ feedback for
configured grant transmission
\- Increased flexibility on time domain resource allocation for the configured
grant transmissions
\- As for potential solutions to providing flexibility on time domain resource
allocation, bitmap based approach and NR Rel-15 based time domain resource
allocation approach, which includes {periodicity, offset in the frame, start
symbol and length of PUSCH and K-repetition signaling}, are identified as
potential candidates. Additional aspects such as finer granularity of resource
allocation, and multiple resources within a period may be considered for
enhancing flexibility on time domain resource allocation.- Supporting
retransmissions without explicit UL grant
_Allowing consecutive configured grant resources in time without any gaps in
between the resources and non-consecutive configured grant resources (not
necessarily periodic) with gaps in between the resources is beneficial and
should be considered for NR in unlicensed spectrum_
UE selects the HARQ process ID from an RRC configured set of HARQ IDs for NR-
unlicensed configured grant transmission.
It is identified to be beneficial to support DFI to include pending HARQ ACK
feedback for prior configured grant transmissions from the same UE.
It was identified that it is problematic for the UE to assume ACK in absence
of reception of feedback, which may include explicit feedback or feedback in
the form of uplink grants. It was additionally identified that assuming NACK
upon timer expiration can be a candidate solution to avoid LBT impact on
reception of feedback. It was also identified that possible conflicts, with
respect to NDI and RNTI for the same HARQ process, between configured grant
transmission and scheduled grant transmission may have to be addressed.
Details can be determined when specifications are developed.
For the retransmission of a HARQ process that was initially transmitted via
configured grant resource, both retransmission via same configured grant
resource and retransmission via resource scheduled by UL grant are supported.
UE may autonomously initiate retransmission for a HARQ process that was
initially transmitted via configured grant mechanism for NR-unlicensed when it
receives NACK feedback via DFI for the corresponding HARQ process.
It is identified to be beneficial to consider UE multiplexing and collision
avoidance mechanisms between configured grant transmissions and between
configured grant and scheduled grant transmissions.
NR-unlicensed configured grant transmission is not allowed during the time
when it overlaps with occasions configured for potential NR-U DRS of the
serving cell irrespective of the configured time domain resource for
configured grant transmission.
It was identified that CBG based retransmissions for configured grant based
transmissions is beneficial. Details on which CBG related control information
is transmitted as part of DFI and UCI, and how such control information is
conveyed through DFI and UCI can be determined when specifications are
developed.
It was identified that collision avoidance between configured grant and
scheduled grant based transmission can be achieved by management of starting
point of the transmission for configured grant and scheduled grant based
transmission. Further details on the management of the starting point of the
transmission can be determined when specifications are developed.
It was identified that sharing resources with gNB within COT(s) that is
acquired by UE(s) as part of configured grant based transmissions should be
supported. It was also identified that allowing configured grant based
transmissions within a gNB acquired COT should be supported. Details of
identification of situations when COT(s) sharing is possible and the details
of potential resource sharing mechanisms and rules can be determined when
specifications are developed.
### 7.2.2 Higher layer aspects
#### 7.2.2.1 Inactive and Idle procedures (38.304 related)
For Inactive and Idle mode procedures, Rel-15 NR design is considered as the
baseline. As such, NR licensed measurement framework (cell and beam quality
derivation for RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR, filtering and combining multiple beams)
is also used as the baseline.
The UE measurements in Idle/Inactive mode will assume recurring transmissions
of SSB/PBCH and RMSI but possibly with reduced opportunities due to LBT. The
impact of LBT on Idle/Inactive measurement is not captured in RAN2
specifications.
In unlicensed bands, multiple PLMNs can use the same carriers without any
coordination. Therefore, the best cell found by a UE on a frequency may not
belong the registered PLMN. In this case, the UE should be enabled to camp on
a non-best cell on a carrier if the best cell does not belong to the
registered PLMN (or E-PLMN), where the non-best cell would still be the best
cell of the registered PLMN.
For paging, it may be beneficial to introduce more opportunities per DRX cycle
for the UE to receive the page. The additional locations can be provided in
time domain by configuring an extended paging occasion (i.e. a paging window)
or configuring multiple paging occasions to a UE. In any specified solution(s)
based on additional paging opportunities, the UE power consumption should also
be taken into account; to this end, it is beneficial that the paging occasions
are transmitted in close time to or overlap with the reference signals.
#### 7.2.2.2 L2 impacts
##### 7.2.2.2.1 RACH (4-step, 2-step)
Both 4-step and 2-step RACH will be supported for NR-U. Here 2-step RACH
refers to the procedure which can complete contention-based RACH (CBRA) in two
steps as explained below. One additional benefit of 2-step RACH is due to less
LBT impact with the reduced number of messages. However, in order to alleviate
the impact of LBT failures further, additional opportunities for the RACH
messages may be introduced, e.g. in time or frequency domain, for both 4-step
and 2-step RACH. The additional opportunities for 4-step RACH will be
applicable to both msg1 and msg3.
NR-U will support contention-free RACH (CFRA) and CBRA for both 2-step and
4-step RACH. On SCells, CFRA is supported as a baseline while both CBRA and
CFRA are supported on SpCells.
For 4-step RACH, the messages in time order are named as msg1, msg2, msg3,
msg4 and for 2-step RACH, they are named msgA and msgB.
A single RACH procedure i will be used and thus multiple RACH procedures in
parallel will not be supported for NR-U.As a baseline, the random-access
response to msg1 will be on SpCell and msg3 is assumed to use a predetermined
HARQ ID.
In legacy RACH, the counters for preamble transmission and power ramping are
increased with every attempt. In NR-U, power ramping is not applied when
preamble is not transmitted due to LBT failure. This will require an
indication from the physical layer to the MAC. In addition, ra-ResponseWindow
is not started when the preamble is not transmitted due to LBT failure.
It is assumed that ra-ContentionResolutionTimer may need to be extended with
larger values to overcome the LBT impact.
For 2-step RACH, the msgA is a signal to detect the UE and a payload while the
second message is for contention resolution for CBRA with a possible payload.
msgA will at least include the equivalent information which is transmitted in
msg3 for 4-step RACH.
NOTE: Further input from RAN1 will be needed for the payload size of msgA.
As a baseline, all the triggers for 4-step RACH are also applicable to 2-step
RACH; however further analysis is needed on SI request and BFR as well as how
timing advance and grants can be obtained for msgA.
The contention resolution in 2-step RACH will be performed by including a UE
identifier in the first message which is echoed in the second message. The
type of UE identifier(s) is FFS.
Fall-back from 2-step RACH to 4-step RACH will be supported. The fallback
after msgA transmission is feasible only if detection of the UE without the
decoding of the payload is possible and thus relies on such support at the
physical layer.
If 2-step RACH is used for initial access, the parameters for 2-step RACH
procedure including resources for msgA will be broadcasted.
NOTE: 2-step RACH if applied to licensed operation would not take into account
LBT.
##### 7.2.2.2.2 MAC (except RACH)
For scheduling request (SR), a prohibit timer as in NR licensed can be used.
However, this should not prevent the UE from attempting to transmit an SR
again if the triggered SR was not transmitted due to LBT failure.
##### 7.2.2.2.3 Other
For channel access and transmissions in NR-U the mechanisms and associated
signaling adopted by LTE LAA (e.g. standardized QCI to access priority mapping
for DL and UL, how access priority per logical channel is determined for
scheduled UL and AUL transmissions etc) are used as the baseline. Any changes
due to new physical layer design and channel access mechanisms for NR-U (e.g.
introduction of PRACH, support of FBE) can also be introduced.
In addition, access priority for control signaling (transmissions over SRBs)
over unlicensed carriers should be introduced for stand-alone and DC NR-U. In
this case, it is assumed that control signaling will have the highest access
priority.
#### 7.2.2.3 Control plane impacts
##### 7.2.2.3.1 RLM/RLF and mobility (conn mode)
For non-standalone NR-U deployments, connected mode mobility is supported on
licensed spectrum using the baseline mobility procedure specified for the
concerned licensed radio access technology (LTE or NR).
For standalone NR-U deployments, the following mobility scenarios shall be
supported:
\- Inter-cell handover between NR-U and NR-U;
\- Inter-cell handover between NR-U and NR.
In addition, the following mobility scenarios shall be supported based on the
mobility between NR-U and NR and and the mobility between NR and (e)LTE,
however further optimizations to this scenarios will be considered possibly
with lower priority:
\- Inter-RAT handover between NR-U and LTE connected to EPC;
\- Inter-RAT handover between NR-U and LTE connected to 5GC.
For connected mode mobility, the main issue identified for NR operation in
unlicensed band is the reduced transmission opportunities for different
signalings due to LBT failure.
The following modifications to mobility-related procedures have been
identified as beneficial to study:
\- Modifications to mobility-related measurements considering limitations to
the transmission of reference signals due to LBT. NR-U needs to consider
techniques to handle reduced RS (e.g. SS/PBCH block and CSI-RS) transmission
opportunities due to LBT failure.
\- Modifications to mobility-related measurements and/or triggers considering
limitations related to high channel occupancy. NR-U needs to consider
techniques to handle increased interference levels in the unlicensed channel
for mobility-related decisions.
\- Modifications to mobility-related procedures and/or triggers considering
limitations related to the transmission of control plane signalling due to
LBT. NR-U needs to consider whether NR-U specific techniques to handle
additional signaling delays due to LBT failure are required, if not resolved
by general mobility enhancement solutions [RP-181433].
Potential modifications to the measurement reporting quantities, to the
measurement reporting triggers and to the condition used by the UE when
delaying the time at which it applies a reconfiguration for mobility that are
based at least on channel occupancy and RSSI should be studied.
For RRM, RLM, and mobility procedures, NR licensed specification in Rel-15 are
considered as a baseline for NR-U. However, changes to these due to new
physical layer design and LBT for the unlicensed operation can be introduced.
These will support both synchronous and, except for LAA case, asynchronous
deployments.
The RRM and RLM framework for NR-U will also support multiple beam operation.
The measurement of multiple beams in NR-U will use the framework in TS 38.300
Section 9.2.4 as a baseline and the measurement model captured in Figure
9.2.4-1 is also applicable for NR-U.
For UE measurements, it is assumed that recurring transmissions of SSB/PBCH
and RMSI will be available with possibly reduced opportunities due to LBT. The
NR licensed measurement framework (cell and beam quality derivation for RSRP,
RSRQ, and SINR, filtering and combining multiple beams) is used as a baseline.
The handling of missing measurements due to LBT are expected to be captured at
physical layer specifications.
In addition to the existing measurement quantities, channel occupancy and
RSSI, similar to adopted for LTE LAA, are considered useful.
In unlicensed spectrum, multiple PLMNs from different operators can share the
same channel and coordination between different operators may not happen. This
may cause PCI collisions or confusion. As one possible solution, the gNBs can
scan different frequencies to identify the PCIs of neighbour cells and use
this information in setting the PCIs of their own cells in order to avoid PCI
collisions. In addition, ANR can be used, as in NR licensed, to detect and
solve PCI collision and confusion.
##### 7.2.2.3.2 Other
Since System Information (SI) transmissions will be subject to LBT, it is
beneficial to add more transmission opportunities in time domain for SI
transmission, e.g. by configuring a longer SI window.
If there is need to have multiple SI messages then with existing NR design,
different SI messages require separate LBT procedures. It may be beneficial
not to require multiple LBTs for different SI messages to increase the success
probability of the transmission.
In response to a RAN2 LS requesting study of system level aspects of NR-U, SA2
has discussed this topic and concluded as follows:
\- Based on SA2 analysis, only system impact identified specifically for NR-U
is the need for introducing RAT type for NR-U, if desired, for \"subscription
based access restriction\", policy and charging purpose.
\- If a non-public network operator wants to leverage NR-U, Network
Identification & Network selection aspects for operators with no globally
unique PLMN ID are already being addressed within FS_Vertical_LAN study
ongoing in SA2. Thus NR-U is not resulting in additional system impacts work.
\- The same impact identified for 5GS applies also for EPS. SA2 understanding
is that for NR-U in EPS it is only for NR-U as secondary RAT (ENDC case)
following similar approach in terms of subscription based access restriction,
policy and charging as LAA/LWA. As such, similar solution can be adopted as
the one that already exists in EPS.
Based on the SA2 analysis and response, there is no impact to RAN for the
possible changes to 5GS and EPS for NR-U. The support for \"subscription based
access restriction\", policy and charging is contained to CN signalling and
the support for non-public operator network identification will not result in
additional work specific to NR-U.
# 8 Performance evaluations
For performance evaluation, coexistence with other networks will be
evaluation, such as Wi-Fi, LTE-LAA, or other NR-U network.
When coexistence with Wi-Fi is evaluated, following the study item description
[2], NR-based operation in unlicensed spectrum should not impact deployed Wi-
Fi services (data, video and voice services) more than an additional Wi-Fi
network on the same carrier, where the deployed Wi-Fi includes 11ac in 5GHz
band.
For sub-7 GHz bands other than 5GHz band, though it is not in the scope of
this study to define a fairness criterion with other RATs, a fairness
criterion for coexistence has been discussed but no conclusions were reached.
Coexistence simulations with other RATs have been performed using technology
neutral assumptions (eg. channel access mechanism) at an arbitrary carrier
frequency in 5GHz band for application to bands other than 5GHz which may
become available subject to regulations. The study assumes regulation will
provide the framework concerning the protection for the technologies not using
unlicensed access in those bands. For this coexistence evaluation, as the
regulations on channel access is not yet available, companies have provided
description on the assumptions used for technology neutral channel access
mechanism when providing simulation results.
## 8.1 Scenarios and methodology
For the NR-U study evaluation, to reuse the simulation platform already
developed for NR study, the 5GCM in [29] is used for NR-U simulation
evaluation. The evaluation deployment scenarios are derived from NR evaluation
deployment scenarios as defined in [28] with proper modifications to introduce
the second operator. For coexistence evaluations below 7GHz, for parameters
not provided in this section, the evaluations assumptions specified for LTE
(e)LAA coexistence evaluations [31] apply. The base metrics for NR-U
evaluation are the same as in LTE-LAA in [31].
NR-U simulation evaluation considers the following layout scenarios:
\- Indoor sub-7GHz, 2 operators
\- Outdoor Sub-7 GHz, 2 operators
\- Stadium scenario for sub-7GHz, 2 operators, can be optionally considered by
interested companies.
The following deployment scenarios for simulation are identified:
\- CA between NR licensed cell and NR unlicensed cell
\- DC (with LTE and with NR)
\- SA
\- An NR cell with DL in unlicensed band and UL in licensed band
In the simulations, only unlicensed cell(s) is to be simulated. The licensed
cell may not be explicitly modelled in the simulation. Necessary assumptions
regarding the presence of the licensed carriers can be made and provided.
It was also noted that a single set of evaluations may be applicable to
multiple deployment scenarios. For example, DC and SA deployment scenarios can
share the same set of simulations, possibly with some minor differences on how
the overhead (say for system information delivery) is captured in the result.
### 8.1.1 Sub7 GHz indoor scenario
For sub7 GHz indoor simulation evaluation, two operators each with 3 gNBs are
deployed in a room of size 120 meters by 80 meters as shown in Figure 1. In
the figure, the gNB of the same color belongs to the same operator. The
parameters are of value a=20 meters, b=40 meters, c=20 meters, and d=40
meters. The deployment scenario is selected to achieve a target serving link
RSSI distribution with 10%-15% serving link below -72dBm.
Figure 1: Indoor sub7 simulation office layout
Additional evaluation parameters are provided in Annex A.1.1.
### 8.1.2 Sub7GHz outdoor scenario
For sub 7 GHz outdoor simulation evaluation, two scenarios are considered. The
two scenarios differ in the inter-gNB distance within the same macro cell.
\- Scenario 1: Within each macro cell coverage, two operators each drop one
micro gNB with a maximum distance of 30 meters between the gNBs
\- Scenario 2: Within each macro cell coverage, two operators each drop one
micro gNB with no limitation on the inter-gNB distance.
The layout of the gNBs are defined as follows:
\- Macro deployment with ISD=200×A meters
> \- A=1.0 for scenario 1
\- A=1.5 for scenario 2- Each operator randomly drops 1 micro-layer TRP within
each macro cell sector with minimum distance between micro-layer TRPs equals
57.9×A meters
\- Independent dropping between two operators
\- Use 10 meters as the inter-operator micro-layer TRP minimum distance
\- For the inter-operator micro-layer TRP maximum distance
\- Outdoor scenario 1: 30
\- Outdoor scenario 2: No limit as long as the TRP is within the macro cell
The layout of UEs are defined as follows:
\- UE randomly dropped within macro cell sector with a minimum serving cell
RSSI of -82dBm
\- All UEs dropped outdoor
Additional evaluation parameters are provided in Annex A.1.2.
## 8.2 Channel access schemes
The channel access schemes for NR-based access for unlicensed spectrum can be
classified into the following categories:
_\- Category 1: Immediate transmission after a short switching gap_
\- This is used for a transmitter to immediately transmit after a switching
gap inside a COT.
\- The switching gap from reception to transmission is to accommodate the
transceiver turnaround time and is no longer than 16 µs.
_\- Category 2: LBT without random back-off_
\- The duration of time that the channel is sensed to be idle before the
transmitting entity transmits is deterministic.
_\- Category 3: LBT with random back-off with a contention window of fixed
size_
\- The LBT procedure has the following procedure as one of its components. The
transmitting entity draws a random number N within a contention window. The
size of the contention window is specified by the minimum and maximum value of
N. The size of the contention window is fixed. The random number N is used in
the LBT procedure to determine the duration of time that the channel is sensed
to be idle before the transmitting entity transmits on the channel.
_\- Category 4: LBT with random back-off with a contention window of variable
size_
\- The LBT procedure has the following as one of its components. The
transmitting entity draws a random number N within a contention window. The
size of contention window is specified by the minimum and maximum value of N.
The transmitting entity can vary the size of the contention window when
drawing the random number N. The random number N is used in the LBT procedure
to determine the duration of time that the channel is sensed to be idle before
the transmitting entity transmits on the channel.
For different transmissions in a COT and different channels/signals to be
transmitted, different categories of channel access schemes can be used.

### 8.3.1 Coexistence evaluation results for 5GHz
Key findings of the evaluation results in Annex B.1 for 5GHz band are
discussed in this section. The single carrier scenario with stand-alone
deployment and LAA deployment for NR-U were both evaluated.
#### 8.3.1.1 Detailed findings for indoor scenarios
Key findings from Tables in Annex B.1, which captured the results for an
indoor deployment with one shared unlicensed carrier and FTP traffic are
summarized below.
\- Nine sources evaluated NR-U with a category 4 LBT scheme with CCA-ED
threshold of -72dBm for NR-U.
\- Five sources evaluated licensed assisted access scheme.
\- One source provided results for two subcarrier spacing settings and
reported an improvement in all measured metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi
operator.
\- Two sources reported an improvement in all measured metrics for the non-
replaced Wi-Fi operator while one source reported an improvement in 44 of the
48 metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.
\- One source also provided results for DL only traffic and UL only traffic on
the unlicensed carrier and reported an improvement in all measured metrics for
the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.
\- One source also provided results with mixed traffic for Wi-Fi operator and

operator. The source also reported improvement in VoIP performance for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.
\- One source also provided results comparing coexistence performance for
three cases, NR-U node using CCA-ED threshold of -72, -82 and third case where
NR-U node enables Wi-Fi preamble detection and reported that all 3 schemes co-
exist fairly with Wi-Fi and that using ED threshold of -82dBm provides better
coexistence performance for both NR-U and Wi-Fi nodes than enabling Wi-Fi
preamble detection.
\- One source provided results for mixed traffic with two LBT modes (category
1 immediate transmission and category 2 ) for scheduled UL in gNB acquired
COT. The source provided results only for high buffer occupancy and reported a
degradation in most metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator for both
cases. The source also provided results with Wi-Fi preamble detection enabled
a the NR-U node and reported an improvement in 15 out of the16 metrics (only
high buffer occupancy metrics) for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator. The source
reported a degradation in VoIP performance for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator
for all three cases.
\- Four sources evaluated for a stand-alone NR-U deployment on an unlicensed
carrier.
\- One source reported an improvement in 47 of the 48 measured metrics for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi operator with a maximum degradation under 5%.
\- One source reported an improvement in 35 of the 48 measured metrics for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.
\- One source provided results with RTS/CTS enabled for Wi-Fi operator, DRS
modelled with DRS using category 2 LBT for channel access in the DMTC window
for the NR-U operator and reported an improvement in 40 of the 48 measured
metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator with a maximum degradation under
10%. The source also provided results for the case where HARQ-ACK feedback is
sent within a gap of 16us after the end of DL transmission and showed
improvements in the coexistence performance compared to the case where the
HARQ-ACK feedback is sent at a gap of 24us after the end of DL transmission
using category 2 LBT.
\- One source provided results with RTS/CTS enabled, DRS modelled with DRS
using category 2 LBT for channel access in the DMTC window, and with multiple
switching points with switching gaps no longer than 16 µs in the COT used for
control information transmission and reported an improvement in all of the
measured metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator. The source also provided
results with RTS/CTS enabled and DRS modelling enabled for a second COT
structure that utilized a preparation stage for fast CSI exchange and reported
an improvement in all of the measured metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi
operator.
\- One source also provided results comparing NRU-WiFi coexistence performance
for two cases, NR-U node using CCA-ED threshold of -77, and second case where
NR-U node enables Wi-Fi preamble detection and reported that enabling Wi-Fi
preamble detection degrades the coexistence performance as compared to using
ED threshold of -77dBm
\- One source also provided results comparing NRU-NRU coexistence performance
for two cases, NR-U node using CCA-ED threshold of -72, and second case where
NR-U node enables Wi-Fi preamble detection and reported that enabling Wi-Fi
preamble detection degrades the coexistence performance as compared to using
ED threshold of -72dBm.
\- One source provided results with DRS with transmit duration of 1ms using
category 2 LBT for channel access in the 6ms DRS transmission window for the
NR-U operator and reported an improvement in 47 of the 48 measured metrics for
the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.
\- One source provided results for the case where NR-U follows COT sharing
procedure as permitted by EN 301 893 (category 1 LBT for gaps \
16us, for scheduled UL in gNB acquired COT, for DRS transmission, and for
PRACH transmission. Companies evaluated the three agreed scenarios defined in
Section 8.1. The parameters listed in Section 8.3 were left for companies to
choose, and are provided together with the evaluation results in Annex B.
Eight out of nine sources showed combinations of DL and UL LBT schemes for
NR-U with CCA-ED of -72dBm and no CCA-PD do not impact Wi-Fi more than another
Wi-Fi network in any of the measured performance metrics in all three
evaluated scenarios. One of nine sources indicated degradation of Wi-Fi
performance when coexist with NR-U in some scenarios (Section 8.3.1.1).
Three sources submitted results with NR-U transmitting and receiving Wi-Fi
802.11a preamble and showed combinations of DL and UL LBT schemes for NR-U
with CCA-ED of -62dBm and CCA-PD of -82dBm do not impact Wi-Fi more than
another Wi-Fi network in any of the measured performance metrics in all
evaluated scenarios.
Three sources submitted results with NR-U transmitting and receiving Wi-Fi
802.11a preamble. For indoor scenario, two sources indicated fair coexistence
with mostly improved performance for both Wi-Fi and NR-U when NR-U with CCA-ED
of -62dBm and CCA-PD of -82dBm compared with NR-U with CCA-ED of -72dBm and no
Wi-Fi 802.11a preamble. For outdoor scenario 1, one source indicated fair
coexistence with mostly degraded performance for both Wi-Fi and NR-U when NR-U
with CCA-ED of -62dBm and CCA-PD of -82dBm compared with NR-U with CCA-ED of
-72dBm and no Wi-Fi 802.11a preamble.
Two sources submitted results for indoor scenario and one source submitted
results for outdoor scenario 1 with NR-U transmitting and receiving Wi-Fi
802.11a preamble for NR-U and NR-U coexistence in the absence of Wi-Fi, and
showed combinations of DL and UL LBT schemes for NR-U with CCA-ED of -62dBm
and CCA-PD of -82dBm degrades NR-U performance compared with NR-U with CCA-ED
of -72dBm and no Wi-Fi 802.11a preamble.
Two sources submitted results for indoor scenario with NR-U with CCA-ED
reduced below -72dBm for all NR-U devices. The sources indicated fair
coexistence with mostly improved performance for both Wi-Fi and NR-U when NR-U
with CCA-ED reduced below -72dBm compared with NR-U with CCA-ED of -62dBm and
CCA-PD of -82dBm Wi-Fi 802.11a preamble.
For the case where an NR-U network coexists with an 802.11ac network in the
indoor scenario and a NR-U DL/UL switching gap less than 16 μs, and NR-U UL
data transmission after the gap with Category 1 channel access without any
additional restrictions on duration other than the MCOT limits, one source has
shown that there is a degradation to the throughput and VoIP outage
performance of 802.11ac, while another source has shown that the throughput
and VoIP outage performance of 802.11ac improves, when compared to the case
where two 802.11ac networks coexist.
### 8.3.2 Coexistence evaluation results for 6GHz
Key findings of the evaluation results in Annex B.1 for 6GHz band are
discussed in this section. Due to its greenfield nature, coexistence
evaluations were performed using technology neutral assumptions (eg. channel
access mechanism) and the companies provided simulation results along with
their assumptions on technology neutral channel access schemes and coexistence
performance metrics.
#### 8.3.2.1 Detailed findings for indoor scenarios
Key findings from Tables in Annex B.1 which captured the results for an indoor
deployment with one shared unlicensed carrier and FTP traffic are summarized
below.
\- Two sources provided evaluation results for a stand-alone NR-U deployment
on an unlicensed carrier specifically for 6GHz.
\- One source provided results of Wi-Fi operator with RTS/CTS disabled using
CCA-ED of -72dBm and PD of -82dBm and reported an improvement in 37 of the 48
metrics (agreed to be used for the 5GHz bands) for the non-replaced Wi-Fi
operator with the maximum degradation being \ Tdoc/Source

| **Additional Comments** **Wi-Fi 802.11ac** : DL and UL transmissions use independent CAT4 LBT. No COT sharing between AP and Client, since it is not allowed by 802.11ac. Only ACK transmitted with no-LBT within 16us of the corresponding data transmission. Short guard interval, beam-forming and closed loop link adaptation based on channel reciprocity, MCS and rank update based on measured and target error, spatial probing and Null Data Packets. **Licensed Assisted NR-U** : UL always transmitted within a shared COT won by the gNB. The gNB COT won with CAT4 LBT and UL transmissions occur within 16us of the preceding DL transmission. DRS transmitted with CAT4 LBT with the access priority of Voice. **Configuration 1:** NR-U LBT is ED-only with ED = -72dBm and no LBT in the 16us gap before UL transmission within the gNB COT. **Configuration 2:** NR-U LBT is ED-only with ED = -72dBm and fixed duration LBT with ED = -72dBm in the 16us gap before UL transmission within the gNB COT. **Configuration 3:** NR-U LBT consists of ED = -62dBm and PD = -82dBm and fixed duration LBT with ED = -62dBm in the 16us gap before UL transmission within the gNB COT. NR-U assumptions: SCS 30KHz, MCOT 6ms for UL and 8ms for DL for best effort, and 2ms for DL/UL for VoIP. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
