Identity_ in _plmn-IdentityList_ in SIB1.
**Information element:** A structural element containing single or multiple
fields is referred as information element.
**NPN-only Cell** : A cell that is only available for normal service for
NPNs\' subscriber. An NPN-capable UE determines that a cell is NPN-only Cell
by detecting that the _cellReservedForOtherUse_ IE is set to true while the
_npn-IdentityInfoList_ IE is present in _CellAccessRelatedInfo_.
**NR sidelink communication** : AS functionality enabling at least V2X
Communication as defined in TS 23.287 [55], between two or more nearby UEs,

## 4.2 Architecture
### 4.2.1 UE states and state transitions including inter RAT
A UE is either in RRC_CONNECTED state or in RRC_INACTIVE state when an RRC
connection has been established. If this is not the case, i.e. no RRC
connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE state. The RRC states can
further be characterised as follows:
**\- RRC_IDLE** :
\- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers;
\- UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;
\- The UE:
\- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5);
\- Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
\- Acquires system information and can send SI request (if configured);
\- Performs logging of available measurements together with location and time
for logged measurement configured UEs;
\- Performs idle/inactive measurements for idle/inactive measurement
configured UEs.
**\- RRC_INACTIVE** :
\- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers or by RRC layer;
\- UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;
\- The UE stores the UE Inactive AS context;
\- A RAN-based notification area is configured by RRC layer;
The UE:
\- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5);
\- Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI and RAN paging
using fullI-RNTI;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
\- Performs RAN-based notification area updates periodically and when moving
outside the configured RAN-based notification area;
\- Acquires system information and can send SI request (if configured);
\- Performs logging of available measurements together with location and time
for logged measurement configured UEs;
\- Performs idle/inactive measurements for idle/inactive measurement
configured UEs.
**\- RRC_CONNECTED:**
\- The UE stores the AS context;
\- Transfer of unicast data to/from UE;
\- At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX;
\- For UEs supporting CA, use of one or more SCells, aggregated with the
SpCell, for increased bandwidth;
\- For UEs supporting DC, use of one SCG, aggregated with the MCG, for
increased bandwidth;
\- Network controlled mobility within NR, to/from E-UTRA, and to UTRA-FDD;
\- The UE:
\- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5),
if configured;
\- Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to
determine if data is scheduled for it;
\- Provides channel quality and feedback information;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting;
\- Acquires system information;
\- Performs immediate MDT measurement together with available location
reporting.
Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates an overview of UE RRC state machine and state
transitions in NR. A UE has only one RRC state in NR at one time.

### 4.2.2 Signalling radio bearers
\"Signalling Radio Bearers\" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RBs) that
are used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically,
the following SRBs are defined:
\- SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;
\- SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as
well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH
logical channel;
\- SRB2 is for NAS messages and for RRC messages which include logged
measurement information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower
priority than SRB1 and may be configured by the network after AS security
activation;
\- SRB3 is for specific RRC messages when UE is in (NG)EN-DC or NR-DC, all
using DCCH logical channel.
In downlink, piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e.
with joint success/failure) procedure: bearer
establishment/modification/release. In uplink piggybacking of NAS message is
used only for transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup and
connection resume.
NOTE 1: The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC
messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.
Once AS security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2 and SRB3,
including those containing NAS messages, are integrity protected and ciphered
by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the
NAS messages, see TS 24.501 [23].
Split SRB is supported for all the MR-DC options in both SRB1 and SRB2 (split
SRB is not supported for SRB0 and SRB3).
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, SRB0, SRB1 and SRB3 are
assigned with the highest priority Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC), (i.e.
CAPC = 1) while CAPC for SRB2 is configurable.
## 4.3 Services
### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers
The RRC protocol offers the following services to upper layers:
\- Broadcast of common control information;
\- Notification of UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. about a mobile terminating call;

\- Transfer of dedicated signalling;
\- Broadcast of positioning assistance data.
### 4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers
In brief, the following are the main services that RRC expects from lower
layers:
\- Integrity protection, ciphering and loss-less in-sequence delivery of
information without duplication;
## 4.4 Functions
The RRC protocol includes the following main functions:
\- Broadcast of system information:
\- Including NAS common information;

information);
\- Including ETWS notification, CMAS notification;
\- Including positioning assistance data.

the UE, i.e. allocation of a priority and a prioritised bit rate (PBR) for
each RB of UE and logical channel of IAB-MT.
\- Recovery from radio link failure.
\- Inter-RAT mobility including e.g. AS security activation, transfer of RRC
context information;

# 5 Procedures
## 5.1 General
### 5.1.1 Introduction
This clause covers the general requirements.
### 5.1.2 General requirements
The UE shall:
1> process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the
processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing of a
subsequent message;
NOTE: Network may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the UE\'s
response of a previously initiated procedure.
1> within a clause execute the steps according to the order specified in the
procedural description;
1> consider the term \'radio bearer\' (RB) to cover SRBs and DRBs unless
explicitly stated otherwise;
1> set the _rrc-TransactionIdentifier_ in the response message, if included,
to the same value as included in the message received from the network that
triggered the response message;
1> upon receiving a choice value set to _setup_ :
2> apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the
associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;
1> upon receiving a choice value set to _release_ :
2> clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated
resources;
1> in case the size of a list is extended, upon receiving an extension field
comprising the entries in addition to the ones carried by the original field
(regardless of whether the network signals more entries in total); apply the
following generic behaviour unless explicitly stated otherwise:
2> create a combined list by concatenating the additional entries included in
the extension field to the original field while maintaining the order among
both the original and the additional entries;
2> for the combined list, created according to the previous, apply the same
behaviour as defined for the original field.
### 5.1.3 Requirements for UE in MR-DC
In this specification, the UE considers itself to be in:
\- EN-DC, if and only if it is configured with _nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig_
according to TS 36.331[10], and it is connected to EPC,
\- NGEN-DC, if and only if it is configured with _nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig_
according to TS 36.331[10], and it is connected to 5GC,
\- NE-DC, if and only if it is configured with _mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup_ set
to _eutra-SCG_ ,
\- NR-DC, if and only if it is configured with _mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup_ set
to _nr-SCG_ ,
\- MR-DC, if and only if it is in (NG)EN-DC, NE-DC or NR-DC.
NOTE: This use of these terms deviates from the definition in TS 37.340 [41]
and other specifications. In TS 37.340, these terms include also the case
where the UE is configured with E-UTRA or NR MCG only (i.e. no NR or E-UTRA
SCG) but with one or more bearers terminated in a secondary node (i.e. using
NR PDCP).
The UE in (NG)EN-DC only executes a subclause of clause 5 in this
specification when the subclause:
\- is referred to from a subclause under execution, either in this
specification or in TS 36.331 [10]; or
\- applies to a message received on SRB3 (if SRB3 is established); or
\- applies to field(s), IE(s), UE variable(s) or timer(s) in this
specification that the UE is configured with.
When executing a subclause of clause 5 in this specification, the UE follows
the requirements in clause 5.1.2 and in all subclauses of this specification
applicable to the messages (including processing time requirements), fields,
IEs, timers and UE variables indicated in the subclause under execution.
## 5.2 System information
### 5.2.1 Introduction
System Information (SI) is divided into the _MIB_ and a number of SIBs and
posSIBs where:
\- the _MIB_ is always transmitted on the BCH with a periodicity of 80 ms and
repetitions made within 80 ms (TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.1) and it includes
parameters that are needed to acquire _SIB1_ from the cell. The first
transmission of the _MIB_ is scheduled in subframes as defined in TS 38.213
[13], clause 4.1 and repetitions are scheduled according to the period of SSB;
NOTE 1: If the period of SSB is larger than 80 ms, the MIB is transmitted with
the same periodicity as that of SSB.
\- the _SIB1_ is transmitted on the DL-SCH with a periodicity of 160 ms and
variable transmission repetition periodicity within 160 ms as specified in TS
38.213 [13], clause 13. The default transmission repetition periodicity of
_SIB1_ is 20 ms but the actual transmission repetition periodicity is up to
network implementation. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, _SIB1_
repetition transmission period is 20 ms. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing
pattern 2/3, _SIB1_ transmission repetition period is the same as the SSB
period (TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). _SIB1_ includes information regarding the
availability and scheduling (e.g. mapping of SIBs to SI message, periodicity,
SI-window size) of other SIBs with an indication whether one or more SIBs are
only provided on-demand and, in that case, the configuration needed by the UE
to perform the SI request. _SIB1_ is cell-specific SIB;
\- SIBs other than _SIB1_ and posSIBs are carried in _SystemInformation_ (SI)
messages, which are transmitted on the DL-SCH. Only SIBs or posSIBs having the
same periodicity can be mapped to the same SI message. SIBs and posSIBs are
mapped to different SI messages, _i.e. an SI message contains either only SIBs
or only posSIBs_. Each SI message is transmitted within periodically occurring
time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows with same length for all SI
messages). Each SI message is associated with an SI-window and the SI-windows
of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only
the corresponding SI message is transmitted. An _SI message may be repeated
with the same content a number of times within the SI-window._ Any SIB or
posSIB except _SIB1_ can be configured to be cell specific or area specific,
using an indication in _SIB1_. The cell specific SIB is applicable only within
a cell that provides the SIB while the area specific SIB is applicable within
an area referred to as SI area, which consists of one or several cells and is
identified by s _ystemInformationAreaID_ ;
\- The mapping of SIBs to SI messages is configured in _schedulingInfoList_ ,
while the mapping of posSIBs to SI messages is configured in
_posSchedulingInfoList.\_ Each SIB and each posSIB is mapped to a single SI
message. posSIBs of the same _posSibType_ carrying GNSS Generic Assistance
Data for different GNSS/SBAS (identified by _gnss-id/sbas-id_ , see **TS
37.355** [49]) are mapped to different SI messages.\ Each SIB and posSIB is
contained at most once in an SI message.\ For SIBs and posSIBs with segments,
the segments contained in SI messages are transmitted according to the SI
message periodicity, with one segment of a particular _sibType_ /_posSibType_
in each SI message;
\- For a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, the network can provide system information
through dedicated signalling using the **_RRCReconfiguration message, e.g. if
the UE has an active BWP with no common search space configured to monitor
system information, paging, or upon request from the UE_**.
\- For PSCell and SCells, the network provides the required SI by dedicated
signalling, i.e. within an **_RRCReconfiguration message_**. Nevertheless, the
UE shall acquire _MIB_ of the PSCell to get SFN timing of the SCG (which may
be different from MCG). Upon change of relevant SI for SCell, the network
releases and adds the concerned SCell. For PSCell, the required SI can only be
changed with Reconfiguration with Sync.
NOTE 2: The physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take.
The maximum _SIB1_ or _SI message_ size is 2976 bits.
### 5.2.2 System information acquisition
#### 5.2.2.1 General UE requirements
Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition
The UE applies the SI acquisition procedure to acquire the AS, NAS- and
positioning assistance data information. The procedure applies to UEs in
RRC_IDLE, in RRC_INACTIVE and in RRC_CONNECTED.
The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE shall ensure having a valid version of (at
least) the _MIB_ , _SIB1_ through _SIB4,_ _SIB5_ (if the UE supports E-UTRA),
_SIB11_ (if the UE is configured for idle/inactive measurements), _SIB12_ (if
UE is capable of NR sidelink communication and is configured by upper layers
to receive or transmit NR sidelink communication), and _SIB13_ , _SIB14_ (if
UE is capable of V2X sidelink communication and is configured by upper layers
to receive or transmit V2X sidelink communication).
The UE shall ensure having a valid version of the posSIB requested by upper
layers.
#### 5.2.2.2 SIB validity and need to (re)-acquire SIB
##### 5.2.2.2.1 SIB validity
The UE shall apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3
upon cell selection (e.g. upon power on), cell-reselection, return from out of
coverage, after reconfiguration with sync completion, after entering the
network from another RAT, upon receiving an indication that the system
information has changed, upon receiving a PWS notification, upon receiving
request (e.g., a positioning request) from upper layers; and whenever the UE
does not have a valid version of a stored SIB or posSIB or a valid version of
a requested SIB.
When the UE acquires a _MIB_ or a _SIB1_ or an SI message in a serving cell as
described in clause 5.2.2.3, and if the UE stores the acquired SIB, then the
UE shall store the associated _areaScope_ , if present, the first _PLMN-
Identity_ in the _PLMN-IdentityInfoList for non-NPN-only cells or the first
NPN identity (SNPN identity in case of SNPN, or PNI-NPN identity in case of
PNI-NPN) in the NPN-IdentityInfoList for NPN-only cells_ , the _cellIdentity_
, the _systemInformationAreaID_ , if present, and the _valueTag_ , if present,
as indicated in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ for the SIB. If the UE stores the
acquired posSIB, then the UE shall store the associated _areaScope_ , if
present, the _cellIdentity_ , the _systemInformationAreaID_ , if present, the
_valueTag_ , if provided in _assistanceDataSIB-Element_ , and the
_expirationTime_ if provided in _assistanceDataSIB-Element_. The UE may use a
valid stored version of the SI except _MIB_ , _SIB1_ , _SIB6_ , _SIB7_ or
_SIB8_ e.g. after cell re-selection, upon return from out of coverage or after
the reception of SI change indication. The _valueTag_ and _expirationTime_ for
posSIB is optionally provided in _assistanceDataSIB-Element_ , as specified in
TS 37.355 [49].
NOTE: The storage and management of the stored SIBs in addition to the SIBs
valid for the current serving cell is left to UE implementation.
The UE shall:
1> delete any stored version of a SIB after 3 hours from the moment it was
successfully confirmed as valid;
1> for each stored version of a SIB:
2> if the _areaScope_ is associated and its value for the stored version of
the SIB is the same as the value received in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ for that
SIB from the serving cell:
3> if the UE is NPN capable and the cell is an NPN-only cell:
4> if the first NPN identity included in the _NPN-IdentityInfoList_ , the
_systemInformationAreaID_ and the v _alueTag_ that are included in the _si-
SchedulingInfo_ for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to
the NPN identity, the _systemInformationAreaID_ and the _valueTag_ associated
with the stored version of that SIB:
5> consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
3> else if the first _PLMN-Identity_ included in the _PLMN-IdentityInfoList_ ,
the _systemInformationAreaID_ and the v _alueTag_ that are included in the
_si-SchedulingInfo_ for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical
to the _PLMN-Identity_ , the _systemInformationAreaID_ and the _valueTag_
associated with the stored version of that SIB:
4> consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
2> if the _areaScope_ is not present for the stored version of the SIB and the
_areaScope_ value is not included in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ for that SIB from
the serving cell:
3> if the UE is NPN capable and the cell is an NPN-only cell:
4> if the first NPN identity in the _NPN-IdentityInfoList,_ the _cellIdentity_
and _valueTag_ that are included in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ for the SIB
received from the serving cell are identical to the NPN identity _,_ the
_cellIdentity_ and the _valueTag_ associated with the stored version of that
SIB:
5> consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
3> else if the first _PLMN-Identity_ in the _PLMN-IdentityInfoList,_ the
_cellIdentity_ and _valueTag_ that are included in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ for
the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the _PLMN-Identity,_
the _cellIdentity_ and the _valueTag_ associated with the stored version of
that SIB:
4> consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
1> for each stored version of a posSIB:
2> if the _areaScope_ is associated and its value for the stored version of
the posSIB is the same as the value received in the _posSIB-MappingInfo_ for
that posSIB from the serving cell and the _systemInformationAreaID_ included
in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ is identical to the _systemInformationAreaID_
associated with the stored version of that posSIB:
3> if the _valueTag_ (see TS 37.355 [49]) for the posSIB received from the
serving cell is identical to the _valueTag_ associated with the stored version
of that posSIB; or if the _expirationTime_ (see TS 37.355 [49]) associated
with the stored posSIB has not been expired:
4> consider the stored posSIB as valid for the cell;
2> if the _areaScope_ is not present for the stored version of the posSIB and
the _areaScope_ value is not included in the _posSIB-MappingInfo_ for that
posSIB from the serving cell and the _cellIdentity_ for the posSIB received
from the serving cell is identical to the _cellIdentity_ associated with the
stored version of that posSIB:
3> if the _valueTag_ (see TS 37.355 [49]) for the posSIB received from the
serving cell is identical to the _valueTag_ associated with the stored version
of that posSIB; or if the _expirationTime_ (see TS 37.355 [49]) associated
with the stored posSIB has not been expired:
4> consider the stored posSIB as valid for the cell;
##### 5.2.2.2.2 SI change indication and PWS notification
A modification period is used, i.e. updated SI message (other than SI message
for ETWS, CMAS and positioning assistance data) is broadcasted in the
modification period following the one where SI change indication is
transmitted. The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for
which SFN mod m = 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the
modification period. The modification period is configured by system
information. The UE receives indications about SI modifications and/or PWS
notifications using Short Message transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause
6.5). Repetitions of SI change indication may occur within preceding
modification period. SI change indication is not applicable for SI messages
containing posSIBs.
UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE shall monitor for SI change indication in
its own paging occasion every DRX cycle. UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor
for SI change indication in any paging occasion at least once per modification
period if the UE is provided with common search space, including
_pagingSearchSpace_ , _searchSpaceSIB1_ and
_searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ , on the active BWP to monitor paging, as
specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 13.
During a modification period where ETWS or CMAS transmission is started or
stopped, the SI messages carrying the posSIBs scheduled in
_posSchedulingInfoList_ may change, so the UE might not be able to
successfully receive those posSIBs in the remainder of the current
modification period and next modification period according to the scheduling
information received prior to the change.
ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE shall monitor for
indications about PWS notification in its own paging occasion every DRX cycle.
ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor for indication about
PWS notification in any paging occasion at least once every
_defaultPagingCycle_ if the UE is provided with common search space, including
_pagingSearchSpace_ , _searchSpaceSIB1_ and
_searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation,_ on the active BWP to monitor paging.
For Short Message reception in a paging occasion, the UE monitors the PDCCH
monitoring occasion(s) for paging as specified in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 38.213
[13].
If the UE receives a Short Message, the UE shall:
1> if the UE is ETWS capable or CMAS capable, the _etwsAndCmasIndication_ bit
of Short Message is set, and the UE is provided with _searchSpaceSIB1_ and
_searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ on the active BWP or the initial BWP:
2> immediately re-acquire the _SIB1_ ;
2> if the UE is ETWS capable and _si-SchedulingInfo_ includes scheduling
information for _SIB6_ :
3> acquire _SIB6_ , as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
2> if the UE is ETWS capable and _si-SchedulingInfo_ includes scheduling
information for _SIB7_ :
3> acquire _SIB7_ , as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
2> if the UE is CMAS capable and _si-SchedulingInfo_ includes scheduling
information for _SIB8_ :
3> acquire _SIB8_ , as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
NOTE: In case _SIB6_ , _SIB7_ , or _SIB8_ overlap with a measurement gap it is
left to UE implementation how to immediately acquire _SIB6_ , _SIB7_ , or
_SIB8_.
1> if the _systemInfoModification_ bit of Short Message is set:
2> apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 from the
start of the next modification period.
#### 5.2.2.3 Acquisition of System Information
##### 5.2.2.3.1 Acquisition of _MIB_ and _SIB1_
The UE shall:
1> apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;
1> if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
2> acquire the _MIB,_ which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2> if the UE is unable to acquire the _MIB_ ;
3> perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
2> else:
3> perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.1.
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space
configured by _searchSpaceSIB1_ and _pagingSearchSpace_ and has received an
indication about change of system information; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space
configured by _searchSpaceSIB1_ and the UE has not stored a valid version of a
SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required
SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1, and, UE has not
acquired SIB1 in current modification period; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space
configured by _searchSpaceSIB1_ , and, the UE has not stored a valid version
of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several
required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1, and, _si-
BroadcastStatus_ for the required SIB(s) or _posSI-BroadcastStatus_ for the
required posSIB(s) is set to _notbroadcasting_ in acquired _SIB1_ in current
modification period; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
2> if _ssb-SubcarrierOffset_ indicates _SIB1_ is transmitted in the cell (TS
38.213 [13]) and if _SIB1_ acquisition is required for the UE:
3> acquire the _SIB1,_ which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
3> if the UE is unable to acquire the _SIB1_ :
4> perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
3> else:
4> upon acquiring _SIB1_ , perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.2.
2> else if _SIB1_ acquisition is required for the UE and _ssb-
SubcarrierOffset_ indicates that _SIB1_ is not scheduled in the cell:
3> perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5.
NOTE: The UE in RRC_CONNECTED is only required to acquire broadcasted _SIB1_
if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the
broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.
##### 5.2.2.3.2 Acquisition of an SI message
For SI message acquisition PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) are determined
according to _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_. If
_searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions
for SI message reception in SI-window are same as PDCCH monitoring occasions
for _SIB1_ where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is
specified in TS 38.213[13]. If _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ is not set
to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message are determined based on
search space indicated by _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_. PDCCH
monitoring occasions for SI message which are not overlapping with UL symbols
(determined according to _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_) are sequentially
numbered from one in the SI window. The [x×N+K]^th^ PDCCH monitoring occasion
(s) for SI message in SI-window corresponds to the K^th^ transmitted SSB,
where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, ...N, N is the number of actual transmitted
SSBs determined according to _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ and X is equal
to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in SI-window/N). The actual
transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of
their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the SI window, PDCCH for an SI
message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding
to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception SI
messages is up to UE implementation.
When acquiring an SI message, the UE shall:
1> determine the start of the SI-window for the concerned SI message as
follows:
2> if the concerned SI message is configured in the _schedulingInfoList_ :
3> for the concerned SI message, determine the number _n_ which corresponds to
the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by
_schedulingInfoList_ in _si-SchedulingInfo_ in _SIB1_ ;
3> determine the integer value _x = (n -- 1) × w_ , where _w_ is the _si-
WindowLength_ ;
3> the SI-window starts at the slot #_a_ , where _a_ = _x_ mod N, in the radio
frame for which SFN mod _T_ = FLOOR(_x_ /N), where _T_ is the _si-Periodicity_
of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as
specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2> else if the concerned SI message is configured in the
_posSchedulingInfoList_ and _offsetToSI-Used_ is not configured:
3> create a concatenated list of SI messages by appending the
_posSchedulingInfoList_ in _posSI-SchedulingInfo_ in _SIB1 to
schedulingInfoList_ in _si-SchedulingInfo_ in _SIB1;_
3> for the concerned SI message, determine the number _n_ which corresponds to
the order of entry in the concatenated list;
3> determine the integer value _x = (n -- 1) × w_ , where _w_ is the _si-
WindowLength_ ;
3> the SI-window starts at the slot #_a_ , where _a_ = _x_ mod N, in the radio
frame for which SFN mod _T_ = FLOOR(_x_ /N), where _T_ is the _posSI-
Periodicity_ of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a
radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2> else if the concerned SI message is configured by the
_posSchedulingInfoList_ and _offsetToSI-Used_ is configured:
3> determine the number _m_ which corresponds to the number of SI messages
with an associated _si-Periodicity_ of 8 radio frames (80 ms), configured by
_schedulingInfoList_ in _SIB1_ ;
3> for the concerned SI message, determine the number _n_ which corresponds to
the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by
_posSchedulingInfoList_ in _SIB1_ ;
3> determine the integer value _x_ = _m_ _× w +_ (_n_ \-- 1 _)_ _× w_ , where
_w_ is the _si-WindowLength;_
3> the SI-window starts at the slot #_a_ , where _a_ = _x_ mod N, in the radio
frame for which SFN mod _T_ = FLOOR(_x_ /N) +8, where _T_ is the _posSI-
Periodicity_ of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a
radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
1> receive the PDCCH containing the scheduling RNTI, i.e. SI-RNTI in the PDCCH
monitoring occasion(s) for SI message acquisition, from the start of the SI-
window and continue until the end of the SI-window whose absolute length in
time is given by _si-WindowLength_ , or until the SI message was received;
1> if the SI message was not received by the end of the SI-window, repeat
reception at the next SI-window occasion for the concerned SI message in the
current modification period;
1> if all the SIB(s) and/or posSIB(s) requested in _DedicatedSIBRequest_
message have been acquired:
2> stop timer T350, if running;
NOTE 1: The UE is only required to acquire broadcasted SI message if the UE
can acquire it without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast
and unicast beams are quasi co-located.
NOTE 2: The UE is not required to monitor PDCCH monitoring occasion(s)
corresponding to each transmitted SSB in SI-window.
NOTE 3: If the concerned SI message was not received in the current
modification period, handling of SI message acquisition is left to UE
implementation.
NOTE 4: A UE in RRC_CONNECTED may stop the PDCCH monitoring during the SI
window for the concerned SI message when the requested SIB(s) are acquired.
NOTE 5: A UE capable of NR sidelink communication and configured by upper
layers to perform NR sidelink communication on a frequency, may acquire
_SIB12_ or _SystemInformationBlockType28_ from a cell other than current
serving cell (for RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE) or current PCell (for
RRC_CONNECTED), if _SIB12_ of current serving cell (for RRC_INACTIVE or
RRC_IDLE) or current PCell (for RRC_CONNECTED) does not provide configuration
for NR sidelink communication for the frequency, and if the other cell
providing configuration for NR sidelink communication for the frequency meets
the S-criteria as defined in TS 38.304 [20] or TS 36.304 [27].
1> perform the actions for the acquired SI message as specified in clause
5.2.2.4.
##### 5.2.2.3.3 Request for on demand system information

## 5.3 Connection control
### 5.3.1 Introduction
#### 5.3.1.1 RRC connection control
RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. The network
completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment
of the NG connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from
the 5GC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase
of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the
network may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting, but the UE only
sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful AS security
activation. However, the UE only accepts a re-configuration with sync message
when AS security has been activated.
Upon receiving the UE context from the 5GC, the RAN activates AS security
(both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial AS security
activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate AS security (command and
successful response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only
after completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used
to activate AS security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g.
used to establish SRB2 and DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered.
After having initiated the initial AS security activation procedure, the
network may initiate the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. the network may
do this prior to receiving the confirmation of the initial AS security
activation from the UE. In any case, the network will apply both ciphering and
integrity protection for the RRC reconfiguration messages used to establish
SRB2 and DRBs. The network should release the RRC connection if the initial AS
security activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails. A
configuration with SRB2 without DRB or with DRB without SRB2 is not supported
(i.e., SRB2 and at least one DRB must be configured in the same RRC
Reconfiguration message, and it is not allowed to release all the DRBs without
releasing the RRC Connection). For IAB-MT, a configuration with SRB2 without
DRB is supported.
The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by the network. The
procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an NR frequency or an E-UTRA
carrier frequency.
The suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by the network. When the RRC
connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS context and any
configuration received from the network, and transits to RRC_INACTIVE state.
The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and
ciphered.
The resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when
the UE needs to transit from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED state or by
RRC layer to perform a RNA update or by RAN paging from NG-RAN. When the RRC
connection is resumed, network configures the UE according to the RRC
connection resume procedure based on the stored UE Inactive AS context and any
RRC configuration received from the network. The RRC connection resume
procedure re-activates AS security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s).
In response to a request to resume the RRC connection, the network may resume
the suspended RRC connection and send UE to RRC_CONNECTED, or reject the
request to resume and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE (with a wait timer), or directly
re-suspend the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE, or directly release
the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_IDLE, or instruct the UE to initiate NAS
level recovery (in this case the network sends an RRC setup message).
NOTE: In case the UE receives the configurations for NR sidelink communication
via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in _SIB12_
and _sl-ConfigDedicatedNR_ within _RRCReconfiguration_ used in clause 5.3 are
provided by the configurations in _SystemInformationBlockType28_ and _sl-
ConfigDedicatedForNR_ within _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ as specified in TS
36.331[10], respectively.
#### 5.3.1.2 AS Security
AS security comprises of the integrity protection and ciphering of RRC
signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).
RRC handles the configuration of the AS security parameters which are part of
the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering
algorithm, if integrity protection and/or ciphering is enabled for a DRB and
two parameters, namely the _keySetChangeIndicator_ and the
_nextHopChainingCount_ , which are used by the UE to determine the AS security
keys upon reconfiguration with sync (with key change), connection re-
establishment and/or connection resume.
The integrity protection algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if
configured) and DRBs configured with integrity protection, with the same
_keyToUse_ value. The ciphering algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if
configured) and DRBs configured with the same _keyToUse_ value. For MR-DC,
integrity protection is not enabled for DRBs terminated in eNB. Neither
integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.
NOTE 0: All DRBs related to the same PDU session have the same enable/disable
setting for ciphering and the same enable/disable setting for integrity
protection, as specified in TS 33.501 [11].
RRC integrity protection and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in
one message/procedure. RRC integrity protection and ciphering for SRBs are
never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a \'_NULL_ \'
ciphering algorithm (_nea0_).
The \'_NULL_ \' integrity protection algorithm (_nia0_) is used only for SRBs
and for the UE in limited service mode, see TS 33.501 [11] and when used for
SRBs, integrity protection is disabled for DRBs. In case the ′ _NULL_ \'
integrity protection algorithm is used, \'_NULL_ \' ciphering algorithm is
also used.
NOTE 1: Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity protection
check has failed and indicate the integrity protection verification check
failure to RRC.
The AS applies four different security keys: one for the integrity protection
of RRC signalling (K~RRCint~), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling
(K~RRCenc~), one for integrity protection of user data (K~UPint~) and one for
the ciphering of user data (K~UPenc~). All four AS keys are derived from the
K~gNB~ key. The K~gNB~ key is based on the K~AMF~ key (as specified in TS
33.501 [11]), which is handled by upper layers.
The integrity protection and ciphering algorithms can only be changed with
reconfiguration with sync. The AS keys (K~gNB~, K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~, K~UPint~
and K~UPenc~) change upon reconfiguration with sync (if _masterKeyUpdate_ is
included), and upon connection re-establishment and connection resume.
For each radio bearer an independent counter (_COUNT_ , as specified in TS
38.323 [5]) is maintained for each direction. For each radio bearer, the
_COUNT_ is used as input for ciphering and integrity protection.
It is not allowed to use the same _COUNT_ value more than once for a given
security key. As specified in TS 33.501 clause 6.9.4.1 [11], the network is
responsible for avoiding reuse of the _COUNT_ with the same RB identity and
with the same key, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release
and establishment of new RBs, and multiple termination point changes for RLC-
UM bearers and multiple termination point changes for RLC-AM bearer with SN
terminated PDCP re-establishment (COUNT reset) due to SN only full
configuration whilst the key stream inputs (i.e. bearer ID, security key) at
MN have not been updated. In order to avoid such re-use, the network may e.g.
use different RB identities for RB establishments, change the AS security key,
or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and then to RRC_CONNECTED
transition.
In order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets
include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). In
addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (_HFN_
, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the
UE and the network.
For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit
BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is
the value of the corresponding _srb-Identity_ with the MSBs padded with
zeroes.
For a UE provided with an _sk-counter_ , _keyToUse_ indicates whether the UE
uses the master key (K~gNB~) or the secondary key (S-K~eNB~ or S-K~gNB~) for a
particular DRB. The secondary key is derived from the master key and _sk-
Counter_ , as defined in TS 33.501[11]. Whenever there is a need to refresh
the secondary key, e.g. upon change of MN with K~gNB~ change or to avoid COUNT
reuse, the security key update is used (see 5.3.5.7). When the UE is in NR-DC,
the network may provide a UE configured with an SCG with an _sk-Counter_ even
when no DRB is setup using the secondary key (S-K~gNB~) in order to allow the
configuration of SRB3. The network can also provide the UE with an _sk-
Counter_ , even if no SCG is configured, when using SN terminated MCG bearers.
### 5.3.2 Paging
#### 5.3.2.1 General
Figure 5.3.2.1-1: Paging
The purpose of this procedure is:
\- to transmit paging information to a UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.
#### 5.3.2.2 Initiation
The network initiates the paging procedure by transmitting the _Paging_
message at the UE\'s paging occasion as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. The
network may address multiple UEs within a _Paging_ message by including one
_PagingRecord_ for each UE.
#### 5.3.2.3 Reception of the _Paging_ _message_ by the UE
Upon receiving the _Paging_ message, the UE shall:
1> if in RRC_IDLE, for each of the _PagingRecord_ , if any, included in the
_Paging_ message:
2> if the _ue-Identity_ included in the _PagingRecord_ matches the UE identity
allocated by upper layers:
3> forward the _ue-Identity_ and _accessType_ (if present) to the upper
layers;
1> if in RRC_INACTIVE, for each of the _PagingRecord_ , if any, included in
the _Paging_ message:
2> if the _ue-Identity_ included in the _PagingRecord_ matches the UE\'s
stored _fullI-RNTI_ :
3> if the UE is configured by upper layers with Access Identity 1:
4> initiate the RRC connection resumption procedure according to 5.3.13 with
_resumeCause_ set to _mps-PriorityAccess_ ;
3> else if the UE is configured by upper layers with Access Identity 2:
4> initiate the RRC connection resumption procedure according to 5.3.13 with
_resumeCause_ set to _mcs-PriorityAccess_ ;
3> else if the UE is configured by upper layers with one or more Access
Identities equal to 11-15:
4> initiate the RRC connection resumption procedure according to 5.3.13 with
_resumeCause_ set to _highPriorityAccess_ ;
3> else:
4> initiate the RRC connection resumption procedure according to 5.3.13 with

identity allocated by upper layers:
3> forward the _ue-Identity_ to upper layers and _accessType_ (if present) to
the upper layers;
3> perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11 with
release cause \'other\'.
### 5.3.3 RRC connection establishment
#### 5.3.3.1 General
Figure 5.3.3.1-1: RRC connection establishment, successful
Figure 5.3.3.1-2: RRC connection establishment, network reject
The purpose of this procedure is to establish an RRC connection. RRC
connection establishment involves SRB1 establishment. The procedure is also
used to transfer the initial NAS dedicated information/ message from the UE to
the network.
The network applies the procedure e.g.as follows:
\- When establishing an RRC connection;
\- When UE is resuming or re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network
is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context. In this case, UE receives
_RRCSetup_ and responds with _RRCSetupComplete_.
#### 5.3.3.1a Conditions for establishing RRC Connection for NR sidelink
communication/V2X sidelink communication
For NR sidelink communication, an RRC connection establishment is initiated
only in the following cases:
1> if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication and
related data is available for transmission:
2> if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink
communication is included in _sl-FreqInfoList_ within _SIB12_ provided by the
cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of _SIB12_ does not
include _sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal_ for the concerned frequency;
For V2X sidelink communication, an RRC connection is initiated only when the
conditions specified for V2X sidelink communication in clause 5.3.3.1a of TS
36.331 [10] are met.
NOTE: Upper layers initiate an RRC connection. The interaction with NAS is
left to UE implementation.
#### 5.3.3.2 Initiation

2> if upper layers provide a 5G-S-TMSI:
3> set the _ue-Identity_ to _ng-5G-S-TMSI-Part1_ ;
2> else:
3> draw a 39-bit random value in the range 0..2^39^-1 and set the _ue-
Identity_ to this value;
NOTE 1: Upper layers provide the _5G-S-TMSI_ if the UE is registered in the TA
of the current cell.
1> if the establishment of the RRC connection is the result of release with
redirect with _mpsPriorityIndication_ (either in NR or E-UTRAN):
2> set the _establishmentCause_ to _mps-PriorityAccess_ ;
1> else:
2> set the _establishmentCause_ in accordance with the information received
from upper layers;
The UE shall submit the _RRCSetupRequest_ message to lower layers for
transmission.

3> if available, set the _measResultNeighCells,_ in order of decreasing
ranking-criterion as used for cell re-selection, to include neighbouring cell
measurements for at most the following number of neighbouring cells: 6 intra-
frequency and 3 inter-frequency neighbours per frequency as well as 3 inter-
RAT neighbours, per frequency/ set of frequencies per RAT and according to the
following:
4> for each neighbour cell included, include the optional fields that are

The UE may discard the connection establishment failure or connection resume
failure information, i.e. release the UE variable _VarConnEstFailReport_ , 48
hours after the last connection establishment failure is detected.
#### 5.3.3.8 Abortion of RRC connection establishment
If upper layers abort the RRC connection establishment procedure, due to a NAS
procedure being aborted as specified in TS 24.501 [23], while the UE has not
yet entered RRC_CONNECTED, the UE shall:
1> stop timer T300, if running;
1> reset MAC, release the MAC configuration and re-establish RLC for all RBs
that are established.
### 5.3.4 Initial AS security activation
#### 5.3.4.1 General
Figure 5.3.4.1-1: Security mode command, successful
Figure 5.3.4.1-2: Security mode command, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to activate AS security upon RRC connection
establishment.
#### 5.3.4.2 Initiation
The network initiates the security mode command procedure to a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED. Moreover, the network applies the procedure as follows:
\- when only SRB1 is established, i.e. prior to establishment of SRB2 and/ or
DRBs.
#### 5.3.4.3 Reception of the _SecurityModeCommand_ by the UE
The UE shall:
1> derive the K~gNB~ key, as specified in TS 33.501 [11];
1> derive the K~RRCint~ key associated with the _integrityProtAlgorithm_
indicated in the _SecurityModeCommand_ message, as specified in TS 33.501
[11];
1> request lower layers to verify the integrity protection of the
_SecurityModeCommand_ message, using the algorithm indicated by the
_integrityProtAlgorithm_ as included in the _SecurityModeCommand_ message and
the K~RRCint~ key;
1> if the _SecurityModeCommand_ message passes the integrity protection check:
2> derive the K~RRCenc~ key and the K~UPenc~ key associated with the
_cipheringAlgorithm_ indicated in the _SecurityModeCommand_ message, as
specified in TS 33.501 [11];
2> derive the K~UPint~ key associated with the _integrityProtAlgorithm_
indicated in the _SecurityModeCommand_ message, as specified in TS 33.501
[11];
2> configure lower layers to apply SRB integrity protection using the
indicated algorithm and the K~RRCint~ key immediately, i.e. integrity
protection shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by
the UE, including the _SecurityModeComplete_ message;
2> configure lower layers to apply SRB ciphering using the indicated
algorithm, the K~RRCenc~ keyafter completing the procedure, i.e. ciphering
shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by the UE,
except for the _SecurityModeComplete_ message which is sent unciphered;
2> consider AS security to be activated;
2> submit the _SecurityModeComplete_ message to lower layers for transmission,
upon which the procedure ends;
1> else:
2> continue using the configuration used prior to the reception of the
_SecurityModeCommand_ message, i.e. neither apply integrity protection nor
ciphering.
2> submit the _SecurityModeFailure_ message to lower layers for transmission,
upon which the procedure ends.
### 5.3.5 RRC reconfiguration
#### 5.3.5.1 General
Figure 5.3.5.1-1: RRC reconfiguration, successful
Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC reconfiguration, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to
establish/modify/release RBs/BH RLC channels, to perform reconfiguration with
sync, to setup/modify/release measurements, to add/modify/release SCells and
cell groups, to add/modify/release conditional handover configuration, to
add/modify/release conditional PSCell change configuration. As part of the
procedure, NAS dedicated information may be transferred from the Network to
the UE.
RRC reconfiguration to perform reconfiguration with sync includes, but is not
limited to, the following cases:
\- reconfiguration with sync and security key refresh, involving RA to the
PCell/PSCell, MAC reset, refresh of security and re-establishment of RLC and
PDCP triggered by explicit indicators;
\- reconfiguration with sync but without security key refresh, involving RA to
the PCell/PSCell, MAC reset and RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery
(for AM DRB) triggered by explicit indicators.
\- reconfiguration with sync for DAPS and security key refresh, involving RA
to the target PCell, establishment of target MAC, and
\- for non-DAPS bearer: refresh of security and re-establishment of RLC and
PDCP triggered by explicit indicators;
\- for DAPS bearer: establishment of RLC for the target PCell, refresh of
security and reconfiguration of PDCP to add the ciphering function, the
integrity protection function and ROHC function of the target PCell;
\- for SRB: refresh of security and establishment of RLC and PDCP for the
target PCell;
\- reconfiguration with sync for DAPS but without security key refresh,
involving RA to the target PCell, establishment of target MAC, and:
\- for non-DAPS bearer: RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery (for AM
DRB) triggered by explicit indicators.
\- for DAPS bearer: establishment of RLC for target PCell, reconfiguration of
PDCP to add the ciphering function, the integrity protection function and ROHC
function of the target PCell;
\- for SRB: establishment of RLC and PDCP for the target PCell.
In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, SRB3 can be used for measurement configuration and
reporting, for UE assistance (re-)configuration and reporting for power
savings, for IP address (re-)configuration and reporting for IAB-nodes, to
(re-)configure MAC, RLC, BAP, physical layer and RLF timers and constants of
the SCG configuration, and to reconfigure PDCP for DRBs associated with the
S-K~gNB~ or SRB3, and to reconfigure SDAP for DRBs associated with S-K~gNB~ in
NGEN-DC and NR-DC, and to add/modify/release conditional PSCell change
configuration, provided that the (re-)configuration does not require any MN
involvement, and to transmit RRC messages between the MN and the UE during
fast MCG link recovery. In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, only _measConfig_ ,
_radioBearerConfig, conditionalReconfiguration, bap-Config_ , _iab-IP-
AddressConfigurationList, otherConfig_ and/or _secondaryCellGroup_ are
included in _RRCReconfiguration_ received via SRB3, except when
_RRCReconfiguration_ is received within _DLInformationTransferMRDC_.
#### 5.3.5.2 Initiation
The Network may initiate the RRC reconfiguration procedure to a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED. The Network applies the procedure as follows:
\- the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during RRC
connection establishment) is performed only when AS security has been
activated;
\- the establishment of BH RLC Channels for IAB is performed only when AS
security has been activated;
\- the addition of Secondary Cell Group and SCells is performed only when AS
security has been activated;
\- the _reconfigurationWithSync_ is included in _secondaryCellGroup_ only when
at least one RLC bearer or BH RLC channel is setup in SCG;
\- the _reconfigurationWithSync_ is included in _masterCellGroup_ only when AS
security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or, for IAB, SRB2,
are setup and not suspended;
\- the _conditionalReconfiguration_ for CPC is included only when at least one
RLC bearer is setup in SCG;
\- the _conditionalReconfiguration_ for CHO is included only when AS security
has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are
setup and not suspended.

channel with another radio bearer. Hence _servedRadioBearer_ is not present in
this case. If a radio bearer is released and another is added with the same
radio bearer identity, it is considered as a new (different) radio bearer.
Hence, the network also releases the RLC bearer(s) associated with the
released radio bearer.

as indicated in _keyToUse_ , i.e. the ciphering configuration shall be applied
to all subsequent messages received and sent by the UE, including the message
used to indicate the successful completion of the procedure;

NOTE 1: Void.
NOTE 2: When determining whether a _drb-Identity_ value is part of the current
UE configuration, the UE does not distinguish which _RadioBearerConfig_ and
_DRB-ToAddModList_ that DRB was originally configured in. To re-associate a
DRB with a different key (K~eNB~ to S-K~gNB~, K~gNB~ to S-K~eNB~, K~gNB~ to
S-K~gNB~, or vice versa), the network provides the _drb-Identity_ value in the
(target) _drb-ToAddModList_ and sets the _reestablishPDCP_ flag. The network
does not list the _drb-Identity_ in the (source) _drb-ToReleaseList_.
NOTE 3: When setting the _reestablishPDCP_ flag for a radio bearer, the
network ensures that the RLC receiver entities do not deliver old PDCP PDUs to
the re-established PDCP entity. It does that e.g. by triggering a
reconfiguration with sync of the cell group hosting the old RLC entity or by
releasing the old RLC entity.
NOTE 4: In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters
configured by NR RRC unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 5: Ciphering and integrity protection can be enabled or disabled for a
DRB. The enabling/disabling of ciphering or integrity protection can be
changed only by releasing and adding the DRB.
NOTE 6: In DAPS handover, the UE may perform PDCP entity re-establishment (if
_reestablishPDCP_ is set) or the PDCP data recovery (if _recoverPDCP_ is set)
for a non-DAPS bearer when indication of successful completion of random
access towards target cell is received from lower layers as specified in TS
38.321 [3]. In this case, the UE suspends data transmission and reception for
all non-DAPS bearers in the source MCG for duration of the DAPS handover.
#### 5.3.5.7 AS Security key update
The UE shall:
1> if UE is connected to E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC:
2> upon reception of _sk-Counter_ as specified in TS 36.331 [10]:
3> update the S-K~gNB~ key based on the K~eNB~ key and using the received _sk-

using the _nextHopChainingCount_ value indicated in the received
_masterKeyUpdate_ , as specified in TS 33.501 [11];
2> store the _nextHopChainingCount_ value;
2> derive the keys associated with the K~gNB~ key as follows:
3> if the _securityAlgorithmConfig_ is included in _SecurityConfig_ :
4> derive the K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~ keys associated with the
_cipheringAlgorithm_ indicated in the _securityAlgorithmConfig,_ as specified
in TS 33.501 [11];
4> derive the K~RRCint~ and K~UPint~ keys associated with the
_integrityProtAlgorithm_ indicated in the _securityAlgorithmConfig,_ as
specified in TS 33.501 [11];
3> else:
4> derive the K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~ keys associated with the current
_cipheringAlgorithm,_ as specified in TS 33.501 [11];
4> derive the K~RRCint~ and K~UPint~ keys associated with the current
_integrityProtAlgorithm,_ as specified in TS 33.501 [11].
NOTE 1: Ciphering and integrity protection are optional to configure for the
DRBs.
1> else if this procedure was initiated due to reception of the _sk-Counter_
(UE is in NE-DC, or NR-DC, or is configured with SN terminated bearer(s)):
2> derive or update the secondary key (S-K~gNB~ or S-KeNB) based on the KgNB
key and using the received _sk-Counter_ value, as specified in TS 33.501 [11];
2> derive the K~RRCenc~ key and the K~UPenc~ key as specified in TS 33.501
[11] using the ciphering algorithms indicated in the _RadioBearerConfig_
associated with the secondary key (S-K~gNB~ or S-KeNB) as indicated by
_keyToUse_ ;
2> derive the K~RRCint~ key and the K~UPint~ key as specified in TS 33.501
[11] using the integrity protection algorithms indicated in the
_RadioBearerConfig_ associated with the secondary key (S-K~gNB~ or S-KeNB) as
indicated by _keyToUse_ ;
NOTE 2: If the UE has no radio bearer configured with _keyToUse_ set to
_secondary_ and receives the _sk-Counter_ without any _RadioBearerConfig_ with
_keyToUse_ set to _secondary_ , the UE does not consider it as an invalid
reconfiguration.
#### 5.3.5.8 Reconfiguration failure
##### 5.3.5.8.1 Void
##### 5.3.5.8.2 Inability to comply with _RRCReconfiguration_
NOTE 00: The UE behaviour specified in this clause does not apply to the
fields in _ServingCellConfigCommon_ that are defined in release-16 and later.
The UE ignores, i.e. does not take an action on and does not store, the fields
that it does not support or does not comprehend.

3> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in TS
36.331 [10], clause 5.3.7, upon which the connection reconfiguration procedure
ends.
1> else if _RRCReconfiguration_ is received via NR (i.e., NR standalone, NE-
DC, or NR-DC):
2> if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in

2> else if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration
included in the _RRCReconfiguration_ message received over the SRB1 or if the
upper layers indicate that the _nas-Container_ is invalid:
NOTE 0a: The compliance also covers the SCG configuration carried within octet
strings e.g. field _mrdc-SecondaryCellGroupConfig_. I.e. the failure behaviour
defined also applies in case the UE cannot comply with the embedded SCG
configuration or with the combination of (parts of) the MCG and SCG
configurations.
NOTE 0b: The compliance also covers the V2X sidelink configuration carried
within an octet string, e.g. field _sl-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA_. I.e. the failure
behaviour defined also applies in case the UE cannot comply with the embedded
V2X sidelink configuration.

specifications applicable for the other RAT.
NOTE 1: The UE may apply above failure handling also in case the
_RRCReconfiguration_ message causes a protocol error for which the generic
error handling as defined in clause 10 specifies that the UE shall ignore the
message.
NOTE 2: If the UE is unable to comply with part of the configuration, it does
not apply any part of the configuration, i.e. there is no partial
success/failure.
NOTE 3: It is up to UE implementation whether the compliance check for an
_RRCReconfiguration_ received as part of _ConditionalReconfiguration_ is
performed upon the reception of the message or upon CHO and CPC execution
(when the message is required to be applied).

5.3.10.19 to release the E-UTRA SCG;
#### 5.3.5.11 Full configuration
The UE shall:
1> release/ clear all current dedicated radio configurations except for the
following:
\- the MCG C-RNTI;
\- the AS security configurations associated with the master key;
\- the SRB1/SRB2 configurations and DRB configurations as configured by
_radioBearerConfig_ or _radioBearerConfig2_.
NOTE 1: Radio configuration is not just the resource configuration but
includes other configurations like _MeasConfig_. Radio configuration also
includes the RLC bearer configurations as configured by _RLC-BearerConfig_. In
case NR-DC or NE-DC is configured, this also includes the entire NR or E-UTRA
SCG configuration which are released according to the MR-DC release procedure
as specified in 5.3.5.10.
NOTE 1a: For NR sidelink communication, the radio configuration includes the
sidelink RRC configuration received from the network, but does not include the
sidelink RRC reconfiguration and sidelink UE capability received from other
UEs via PC5-RRC. In addition, the UE considers the new NR sidelink
configurations as full configuration, in case of state transition and change
of system information used for NR sidelink communication.
NOTE 1b: To establish the RLC bearer of SRB(s) after release due to
_fullConfig_ , the network can include the _srb-Identity_ within _srb-
ToAddModList_ (i.e. the UE applies RLC default configuration) and/or provide
_rlc-BearerToAddModList_ of concerned SRB(s) explicitly.
\- the logged measurement configuration;
1> if the _spCellConfig_ in the _masterCellGroup_ includes the
_reconfigurationWithSync_ :
2> release/ clear all current common radio configurations;
2> use the default values specified in 9.2.3 for timers T310, T311 and
constants N310, N311;
1> else (full configuration after re-establishment or during RRC resume):
2> use values for timers T301, T310, T311 and constants N310, N311, as
included in _ue-TimersAndConstants_ received in _SIB1_ ;
1> apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding
physical layer specifications except for the following:
\- parameters for which values are provided in _SIB1_ ;
1> apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
1> for each _srb-Identity_ value included in the _srb-ToAddModList_ (SRB
reconfiguration):
2> establish an RLC entity for the corresponding SRB;
2> apply the default SRB configuration defined in 9.2.1 for the corresponding
SRB;
NOTE 2: This is to get the SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2 for reconfiguration with sync
and SRB2 for resume and reconfiguration after re-establishment) to a known
state from which the reconfiguration message can do further configuration.
1> for each _pdu-Session_ that is part of the current UE configuration:
2> release the SDAP entity (clause 5.1.2 in TS 37.324 [24]);
2> release each DRB associated to the _pdu-Session_ as specified in 5.3.5.6.4;
NOTE 3: This will retain the _pdu-Session_ but remove the DRBs including _drb-
identity_ of these bearers from the current UE configuration. Setup of the
DRBs within the AS is described in clause 5.3.5.6.5 using the new
configuration. The _pdu-Session_ acts as the anchor for associating the
released and re-setup DRB. In the AS the DRB re-setup is equivalent with a new
DRB setup (including new PDCP and logical channel configurations).
1> for each _pdu-Session_ that is part of the current UE configuration but not
added with same _pdu-Session_ in the _drb-ToAddModList_ :
2> if the procedure was triggered due to reconfiguration with sync:
3> indicate the release of the user plane resources for the _pdu-Session_ to
upper layers after successful reconfiguration with sync;
2> else:
3> indicate the release of the user plane resources for the _pdu-Session_ to
upper layers immediately;

2> if _bap-Address_ is included:
3> configure the BAP entity to use the _bap-Address_ as this node\'s BAP
address;
2> if _defaultUL-BAP-RoutingID_ is included:
3> configure the BAP entity to apply the default UL BAP routing ID according
to the configuration;
2> if _defaultUL-BH-RLC-Channel_ is included
3> configure the BAP entity to apply the default UL BH RLC channel according
to the configuration;
2> if _flowControlFeedbackType_ is included:
3> configure the BAP entity to apply the flow control feedback according to
the configuration;
1> if the _bap-Config_ is set to _release_ :

the corresponding _condTriggerConfig_ within _VarConditionalReconfig_ , is
fulfilled for the applicable cells for all measurements after layer 3
filtering taken during the corresponding _timeToTrigger_ defined for this
event within the _VarConditionalReconfig_ :
4> consider the event associated to that _measId_ to be fulfilled;
3> if the _measId_ for this event associated with the _condReconfigId_ has
been modified; or
3> if the leaving condition(s) applicable for this event associated with the
_condReconfigId_ , i.e. the event corresponding with the _condEventId(s)_ of
the corresponding _condTriggerConfig_ within _VarConditionalReconfig_ , is

measurement configuration.
NOTE: The UE is expected to update the mapping between the Destination Layer-2
ID and the destination index for the stored NR sidelink measurement
configuration after the UE updates the destination list and reports to the
gNB.
### 5.3.6 Counter check
#### 5.3.6.1 General
Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure
The counter check procedure is used by the network to request the UE to verify
the amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is
requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT
match with the values indicated by the network.
NOTE: The procedure enables the network to detect packet insertion by an
intruder (a \'man in the middle\').
#### 5.3.6.2 Initiation
The network initiates the procedure by sending a _CounterCheck_ message.
NOTE: The network may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values
reaches a specific value.
#### 5.3.6.3 Reception of the _CounterCheck_ message by the UE
Upon receiving the _CounterCheck_ message, the UE shall:
1> for each DRB that is established:
2> if no COUNT exists for a given direction (uplink or downlink) because it is
a uni-directional bearer configured only for the other direction:
3> assume the COUNT value to be 0 for the unused direction;
2> if the _drb-Identity_ is not included in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ :
3> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of TX_NEXT -- 1 and RX_NEXT -- 1 (specified in TS
38.323 [5]), respectively;
2> else if, for at least one direction, the most significant bits of the COUNT
are different from the value indicated in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ :
3> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of TX_NEXT -- 1 and RX_NEXT -- 1 (specified in TS
38.323 [5]), respectively;
1> for each DRB that is included in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ in the
_CounterCheck_ message that is not established:
2> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ with the most significant bits set identical to the corresponding
values in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ and the least significant bits set to
zero;
1> submit the _CounterCheckResponse_ message to lower layers for transmission
upon which the procedure ends.
### 5.3.7 RRC connection re-establishment
#### 5.3.7.1 General
Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful
Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC re-establishment, fallback to RRC establishment,
successful
The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection. A UE in
RRC_CONNECTED, for which AS security has been activated with SRB2 and at least
one DRB setup or, for IAB, SRB2, may initiate the procedure in order to
continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds if the
network is able to find and verify a valid UE context or, if the UE context
cannot be retrieved, and the network responds with an _RRCSetup_ according to
clause 5.3.3.4.
The network applies the procedure e.g as follows:
\- When AS security has been activated and the network retrieves or verifies
the UE context:
\- to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms;
\- to re-establish and resume the SRB1;
\- When UE is re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not able
to retrieve or verify the UE context:
\- to discard the stored AS Context and release all RBs and BH RLC channels;
\- to fallback to establish a new RRC connection.
If AS security has not been activated, the UE shall not initiate the procedure
but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause \'other\'. If AS
security has been activated, but SRB2 and at least one DRB or, for IAB, SRB2,
are not setup, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead moves to
RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause \'RRC connection failure\'.

RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE; or to transit a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_INACTIVE
only if SRB2 and at least one DRB or, for IAB, SRB2, is setup in
RRC_CONNECTED; or to transit a UE in RRC_INACTIVE back to RRC_INACTIVE when
the UE tries to resume; or to transit a UE in RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE when
the UE tries to resume. The procedure can also be used to release and redirect
a UE to another frequency.

## 5.4 Inter-RAT mobility
### 5.4.1 Introduction
Network controlled inter-RAT mobility between NR and E-UTRA, where E-UTRA can
be connected to either EPC or 5GC, and from NR to UTRA-FDD is supported.
### 5.4.2 Handover to NR
#### 5.4.2.1 General
Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to NR, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network,
transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g.
E-UTRAN) to NR.
The handover to NR procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination with
DRBs, are established in another RAT. Handover from E-UTRA to NR applies only
after integrity has been activated in E-UTRA.
#### 5.4.2.2 Initiation
The RAN using another RAT initiates the handover to NR procedure, in
accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT, by sending
the _RRCReconfiguration_ message via the radio access technology from which
the inter-RAT handover is performed.
The network applies the procedure as follows:
\- to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated
in the other RAT;
\- to re-establish SRBs and one or more DRBs;
#### 5.4.2.3 Reception of the _RRCReconfiguration_ by the UE
The UE shall:
1> apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding
physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values are
provided in _SIB1_ ;
1> apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
1> perform RRC reconfiguration procedure as specified in 5.3.5;
NOTE: If the UE is connected to 5GC of the source E-UTRA cell, the delta
configuration for PDCP and SDAP can be used for intra-system inter-RAT
handover. For other cases, source RAT configuration is not considered when the
UE applies the reconfiguration message of target RAT.
### 5.4.3 Mobility from NR
#### 5.4.3.1 General
Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Mobility from NR, successful
Figure 5.4.3.1-2: Mobility from NR, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to move a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to a cell using
other RAT, e.g. E-UTRA, UTRA-FDD. The mobility from NR procedure covers the
following type of mobility:
\- handover, i.e. the _MobilityFromNRCommand_ message includes radio resources
that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell;
#### 5.4.3.2 Initiation
The network initiates the mobility from NR procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED,
possibly in response to a _MeasurementReport_ or an _MCGFailureInformation_
message, by sending a _MobilityFromNRCommand_ message. The network applies the
procedure as follows:
\- the procedure is initiated only when AS security has been activated, and
SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
\- the procedure is not initiated if any DAPS bearer is configured;
#### 5.4.3.3 Reception of the _MobilityFromNRCommand_ by the UE
The UE shall:
1> stop timer T310, if running;
1> stop timer T312, if running;
1> if T316 is running:
2> stop timer T316;
2> clear the information included in _VarRLF-Report_ , if any;
1> if T390 is running:
2> stop timer T390 for all access categories;
2> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
1> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _eutra_ :
2> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;
2> forward the _nas-SecurityParamFromNR_ to the upper layers, if included;
1> else if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _utra-fdd_ :
2> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards UTRA-FDD;
2> forward the _nas-SecurityParamFromNR_ to the upper layers, if included;
1> access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance
with the specifications of the target RAT.
#### 5.4.3.4 Successful completion of the mobility from NR
Upon successfully completing the handover, at the source side the UE shall:
1> reset MAC;
1> stop all timers that are running except T325, T330 and T400;
1> release _ran-NotificationAreaInfo_ , if stored;
1> release the AS security context including the K~RRCenc~ key, the K~RRCint~
key, the K~UPint~ key and the K~UPenc~ key, if stored;
1> release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity and the
MAC configuration;
1> release the associated PDCP entity and SDAP entity for all established RBs;
NOTE : PDCP and SDAP configured by the source RAT prior to the handover that
are reconfigured and re-used by target RAT when delta signalling (i.e., during
inter-RAT intra-system handover when _fullConfig_ is not present) is used, are
not released as part of this procedure.
1> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _eutra_ and the _nas-SecurityParamFromNR_
is included: or
1> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _utra-fdd_ :
2> indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together with
the release cause \'other\'.
#### 5.4.3.5 Mobility from NR failure
The UE shall:
1> if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target
radio access technology:
2> if the _targetRAT-Type_ in the received _MobilityFromNRCommand_ is set to
_eutra_ and the UE supports Radio Link Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO EUTRA:
3> store handover failure information in _VarRLF-Report according to
5.3.10.5;_
2> if _voiceFallbackIndication_ is included in the _MobilityFromNRCommand
message_ :
3> attempt to select an E-UTRA cell:
4> if a suitable E-UTRA cell is selected:
5> perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11, with
release cause \'RRC connection failure\';
4> else:
5> revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell;

5.3.7;
2> else:
3> revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell;
3> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in clause
5.3.7;
1> else if the UE is unable to comply with any part of the configuration
included in the _MobilityFromNRCommand_ message; or
1> if there is a protocol error in the inter RAT information included in the
_MobilityFromNRCommand_ message, causing the UE to fail the procedure
according to the specifications applicable for the target RAT:
2> if the _targetRAT-Type_ in the received _MobilityFromNRCommand_ is set to
_eutra_ and the UE supports Radio Link Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO EUTRA:

## 5.5 Measurements
### 5.5.1 Introduction
The network may configure an RRC_CONNECTED UE to perform measurements. The
network may configure the UE to report them in accordance with the measurement
configuration or perform conditional reconfiguration evaluation in accordance
with the conditional reconfiguration. The measurement configuration is
provided by means of dedicated signalling i.e. using the _RRCReconfiguration_
or _RRCResume._
The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of
measurements:
\- NR measurements;
\- Inter-RAT measurements of E-UTRA frequencies.
\- Inter-RAT measurements of UTRA-FDD frequencies.
The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement
information based on SS/PBCH block(s):
\- Measurement results per SS/PBCH block;
\- Measurement results per cell based on SS/PBCH block(s);
\- SS/PBCH block(s) indexes.
The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement
information based on CSI-RS resources:
\- Measurement results per CSI-RS resource;
\- Measurement results per cell based on CSI-RS resource(s);
\- CSI-RS resource measurement identifiers.
The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of
measurements for NR sidelink and V2X sidelink:
\- CBR measurements.
The network may configure the UE to report the following CLI measurement
information based on SRS resources:
\- Measurement results per SRS resource;
\- SRS resource(s) indexes.
The network may configure the UE to report the following CLI measurement
information based on CLI-RSSI resources:
\- Measurement results per CLI-RSSI resource;
\- CLI-RSSI resource(s) indexes.
The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:
**1\. Measurement objects:** A list of objects on which the UE shall perform
the measurements.
\- For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object
indicates the frequency/time location and subcarrier spacing of reference
signals to be measured. Associated with this measurement object, the network
may configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of \'blacklisted\' cells
and a list of \'whitelisted\' cells. Blacklisted cells are not applicable in
event evaluation or measurement reporting. Whitelisted cells are the only ones
applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
\- The _measObjectId_ of the MO which corresponds to each serving cell is
indicated by _servingCellMO_ within the serving cell configuration.
\- For inter-RAT E-UTRA measurements a measurement object is a single E-UTRA
carrier frequency. Associated with this E-UTRA carrier frequency, the network
can configure a list of cell specific offsets and a list of \'blacklisted\'
cells. Blacklisted cells are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement
reporting.
\- For inter-RAT UTRA-FDD measurements a measurement object is a set of cells
on a single UTRA-FDD carrier frequency.
\- For CBR measurement of NR sidelink communication, a measurement object is a
set of transmission resource pool(s) on a single carrier frequency for NR
sidelink communication.
\- For CLI measurements a measurement object indicates the frequency/time
location of SRS resources and/or CLI-RSSI resources, and subcarrier spacing of
SRS resources to be measured.
**2\. Reporting configurations:** A list of reporting configurations where
there can be one or multiple reporting configurations per measurement object.
Each measurement reporting configuration consists of the following:
\- Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a
measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event
description.
\- RS type: The RS that the UE uses for beam and cell measurement results
(SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).
\- Reporting format: The quantities per cell and per beam that the UE includes
in the measurement report (e.g. RSRP) and other associated information such as
the maximum number of cells and the maximum number beams per cell to report.
In case of conditional reconfiguration, each configuration consists of the
following:
\- Execution criteria: The criteria the UE uses for conditional
reconfiguration execution.
\- RS type: The RS that the UE uses for obtaining beam and cell measurement
results (SS/PBCH block-based or CSI-RS-based), used for evaluating conditional
reconfiguration execution condition.
**3\. Measurement identities:** For measurement reporting, a list of
measurement identities where each measurement identity links one measurement
object with one reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement
identities, it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the
same reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting
configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity is also
included in the measurement report that triggered the reporting, serving as a
reference to the network. For conditional reconfiguration triggering, one
measurement identity links to exactly one conditional reconfiguration trigger
configuration. And up to 2 measurement identities can be linked to one
conditional reconfiguration execution condition.
**4\. Quantity configurations:** The quantity configuration defines the
measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and related
reporting, and for periodical reporting of that measurement. For NR
measurements, the network may configure up to 2 quantity configurations with a
reference in the NR measurement object to the configuration that is to be
used. In each configuration, different filter coefficients can be configured
for different measurement quantities, for different RS types, and for
measurements per cell and per beam.
**5\. Measurement gaps:** Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements.
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED maintains a measurement object list, a reporting
configuration list, and a measurement identities list according to signalling
and procedures in this specification. The measurement object list possibly
includes NR measurement object(s), CLI measurement object(s) and inter-RAT
objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes NR and inter-RAT
reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any
reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting configurations
may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some measurement objects
may not be linked to a reporting configuration.
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1\. The NR serving cell(s) -- these are the SpCell and one or more SCells.
2\. Listed cells -- these are cells listed within the measurement object(s).
3\. Detected cells -- these are cells that are not listed within the
measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the SSB frequency(ies) and
subcarrier spacing(s) indicated by the measurement object(s).
For NR measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on the serving
cell(s), listed cells and/or detected cells. For inter-RAT measurements
object(s) of E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and detected
cells and, for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements, the UE measures and
reports on the configured resources on the indicated frequency. For inter-RAT
measurements object(s) of UTRA-FDD, the UE measures and reports on listed
cells. For CLI measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on
configured measurement resources (i.e. SRS resources and/or CLI-RSSI
resources).
Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in clause 5.5.2,
refers to a field it concerns a field included in the _VarMeasConfig_ unless
explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration procedure
covers the direct UE action related to the received _measConfig_.
In NR-DC, the UE may receive two independent _measConfig_ :
\- a _measConfig_ , associated with MCG, that is included in the
_RRCReconfiguration_ message received via SRB1; and
\- a _measConfig_ , associated with SCG, that is included in the
_RRCReconfiguration_ message received via SRB3, or, alternatively, included
within a _RRCReconfiguration_ message embedded in a _RRCReconfiguration_
message received via SRB1.
In this case, the UE maintains two independent _VarMeasConfig_ and
_VarMeasReportList_ , one associated with each _measConfig_ , and
independently performs all the procedures in clause 5.5 for each _measConfig_
and the associated _VarMeasConfig_ and _VarMeasReportList_ , unless explicitly
stated otherwise.
The configurations related to CBR measurements are only included in the
_measConfig_ associated with MCG.
### 5.5.2 Measurement configuration
#### 5.5.2.1 General
The network applies the procedure as follows:
\- to ensure that, whenever the UE has a _measConfig associated with a CG_ ,
it includes a _measObject_ for the SpCell and for each NR SCell of the CG to
be measured;
\- to configure at most one measurement identity across all CGs using a
reporting configuration with the _reportType_ set to _reportCGI;_
\- to configure at most one measurement identity per CG using a reporting
configuration with the _ul-DelayValueConfig;_
_-_ to ensure that, in the _measConfig_ associated with a CG:
\- for all SSB based measurements there is at most one measurement object with
the same _ssbFrequency_ ;
_\- an smtc1_ included in any measurement object with the same _ssbFrequency_
has the same value and that an _smtc2_ included in any measurement object with
the same _ssbFrequency_ has the same value and that an _smtc3list_ included in
any measurement object with the same _ssbFrequency_ has the same value;
\- to ensure that all measurement objects configured in this specification and
in TS 36.331 [10] with the same _ssbFrequency_ have the same
_ssbSubcarrierSpacing_ ;
\- to ensure that, if a measurement object associated with the MCG has the
same _ssbFrequency_ as a measurement object associated with the SCG:
\- for that _ssbFrequency_ , the measurement window according to the _smtc1_
configured by the MCG includes the measurement window according to the _smtc1_
configured by the SCG, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the maximum receive
timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
\- if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in
_measurementSlots_ in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to
the same value. Also, the _endSymbol_ is the same in both objects.
\- to ensure that, if a measurement object has the same _ssbFrequency_ as a
measurement object configured in TS 36.331 [10]:
\- for that _ssbFrequency_ , the measurement window according to the _smtc_
configured in TS 36.331 [10] includes the measurement window according to the
_smtc1_ configured in TS 38.331, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the
maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
\- if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in
_measurementSlots_ in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to
the same value. Also, the _endSymbol_ is the same in both objects.
\- when the UE is in NE-DC, NR-DC, or NR standalone, to configure at most one
measurement identity across all CGs using a reporting configuration with the
_reportType_ set to _reportSFTD_ ;
For CSI-RS resources, the network applies the procedure as follows:
> \- to ensure that all CSI-RS resources configured in each measurement object
> have the same center frequency, (_startPRB_ +floor(_nrofPRBs_ /2))
\- to ensure that the total number of CSI-RS resources configured in each
measurement object does not exceed the maximum number specified in TS 38.214
[19].

The UE shall setup the first SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration
(SMTC) in accordance with the received _periodicityAndOffset_ parameter
(providing _Periodicity_ and _Offset_ value for the following condition) in
the _smtc1_ configuration. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at

SFN mod _T_ = (FLOOR (_Offset_ /10));
if the _Periodicity_ is larger than _sf5_ :
subframe = _Offset_ mod 10;
else:
subframe = _Offset_ or (_Offset_ +5);

If _smtc2_ is present, for cells indicated in the _pci-List_ parameter in
_smtc2_ in the same _MeasObjectNR_ , the UE shall setup an additional SS/PBCH
block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received
_periodicity_ parameter in the _smtc2_ configuration and use the _Offset_

condition as _smtc1_ to identify the SFN and the subframe for SMTC occasion)
in each SSB-MTC3 configuration and use the duration and _ssb-ToMeasure_
parameters from each SSB-MTC3 configuration.
On the indicated _ssbFrequency_ , the UE shall not consider SS/PBCH block
transmission in subframes outside the SMTC occasion for RRM measurements based
on SS/PBCH blocks and for RRM measurements based on CSI-RS except for SFTD
measurement (see TS 38.133 [14], clause 9.3.8).
#### 5.5.2.10a RSSI measurement timing configuration
The UE shall setup the RSSI measurement timing configuration (RMTC) in
accordance with the received _rmtc-Periodicity_ and, if configured, with
_rmtc-SubframeOffset_ i.e. the first symbol of each RMTC occasion occurs at
first symbol of an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the following
condition:
SFN mod _T_ = FLOOR(_rmtc-SubframeOffset_ /10);
subframe = _rmtc-SubframeOffset_ mod 10;
with _T_ = _rmtc-Periodicity_ /10;
On the frequency configured by _rmtc-Frequency_ , the UE shall not consider
RSSI measurements outside the configured RMTC occasion which lasts for
_measDurationSymbols_ for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements.
_The UE derives the RSSI measurement duration from a combination of
measDurationSymbols and ref-SCS-CP. At least for RSSI measurement confined
within the active DL BWP, the UE performs RSSI measurement using the
numerology of the active DL BWP during the derived measurement duration.
Otherwise, the numerology used by the UE for measurements is up to UE
implementation._

2> release the per UE measurement gap sharing configuration.
### 5.5.3 Performing measurements
#### 5.5.3.1 General
An RRC_CONNECTED UE shall derive cell measurement results by measuring one or
multiple beams associated per cell as configured by the network, as described
in 5.5.3.3. For all cell measurement results, except for RSSI, and CLI
measurement results in RRC_CONNECTED, the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as
specified in 5.5.3.2, before using the measured results for evaluation of
reporting criteria, measurement reporting or the criteria to trigger
conditional reconfiguration execution. For cell measurements, the network can
configure RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, RSCP or EcN0 as trigger quantity. For CLI
measurements, the network can configure SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI as trigger
quantity. For cell and beam measurements, reporting quantities can be any
combination of quantities (i.e. only RSRP; only RSRQ; only SINR; RSRP and
RSRQ; RSRP and SINR; RSRQ and SINR; RSRP, RSRQ and SINR; only RSCP; only EcN0;
RSCP and EcN0), irrespective of the trigger quantity, and for CLI
measurements, reporting quantities can be either SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI. For
conditional reconfiguration execution, the network can configure up to 2
quantities, both using same RS type. The UE does not apply the layer 3
filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 to derive the CBR measurements.
The network may also configure the UE to report measurement information per
beam (which can either be measurement results per beam with respective beam
identifier(s) or only beam identifier(s)), derived as described in 5.5.3.3a.
If beam measurement information is configured to be included in measurement
reports, the UE applies the layer 3 beam filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2. On
the other hand, the exact L1 filtering of beam measurements used to derive
cell measurement results is implementation dependent.

each serving cell for which _servingCellMO_ is configured as follows:

communication in _SIB12_ , _sl-ConfigDedicatedNR_ within _RRCReconfiguration_
used in this clause are provided by the configurations in
_SystemInformationBlockType28_ , _sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR_ within
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ as specified in TS 36.331[10], respectively.
NOTE 3: If a UE that is configured by upper layers to transmit V2X sidelink
communication is configured by NR with transmission resource pool(s) and the
measurement objects concerning V2X sidelink communication (i.e. _by sl-
ConfigDedicatedEUTRA-Info_), it shall perform CBR measurement as specified in
clause 5.5.3 of TS 36.331 [10], based on the transmission resource pool(s) and
the measurement object(s) concerning V2X sidelink communication configured by
NR.
NOTE 4: For V2X sidelink communication, each of the CBR measurement results is
associated with a resource pool, as indicated by the _poolReportId_ (see TS
36.331 [10]), that refers to a pool as included in _sl-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA-
Info_ or _SIB13_.
#### 5.5.3.2 Layer 3 filtering
The UE shall:
1> for each cell measurement quantity, each beam measurement quantity, each
sidelink measurement quantity as needed in clause 5.8.10, and for each CLI
measurement quantity that the UE performs measurements according to 5.5.3.1:
2> filter the measured result, before using for evaluation of reporting
criteria or for measurement reporting, by the following formula:
**_F_ ~n~ = (1 -- _a_)*_F_ ~n-1~ + _a_ *_M_ ~n~**
where
**_M~n~_** is the latest received measurement result from the physical layer;
**_F~n~_** is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for
evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting;
**_F~n-1~_** is the old filtered measurement result, where **_F~0~_** is set
to **_M~1~_** when the first measurement result from the physical layer is
received; and for _MeasObjectNR_ , **_a_** = 1/2^(**_ki_** /4)^, where
**_k~i~_** is the _filterCoefficient_ for the corresponding measurement
quantity of the i:th _QuantityConfigNR_ in _quantityConfigNR-List_ , and _i_
is indicated by _quantityConfigIndex_ in _MeasObjectNR;_ for _other
measurements_ , **_a_** = 1/2^(**_k_** /4)^, where **_k_** is the
_filterCoefficient_ for the corresponding measurement quantity received by the
_quantityConfig; for UTRA-FDD, a = 1/2^(k/4),^ where k is the
filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity received by
quantityConfigUTRA-FDD in the QuantityConfig;_
2> adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are
preserved at different input rates, observing that the _filterCoefficient k_
assumes a sample rate equal to X ms; The value of X is equivalent to one
intra-frequency L1 measurement period as defined in TS 38.133 [14] assuming
non-DRX operation, and depends on frequency range.
NOTE 1: If **_k_** is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
NOTE 2: The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for evaluation
of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e., logarithmic
filtering for logarithmic measurements.
NOTE 3: The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the
performance requirements set in TS 38.133 [14]. For further details about the
physical layer measurements, see TS 38.133 [14].
NOTE 4: For CLI-RSSI measurement, it is up to UE implementation whether to
reset filtering upon BWP switch.
#### 5.5.3.3 Derivation of cell measurement results

(_rsType_ to be measured, SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).
The network may configure the UE in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE to derive RSRP

scale average of the highest beam measurement quantity values above

### 5.5.6 Location measurement indication
#### 5.5.6.1 General
Figure 5.5.5.1-1: Location measurement indication
The purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE is
going to start/stop location related measurements towards E-UTRA or NR
(_eutra-RSTD, nr-RSTD, nr-UE-RxTxTimeDiff, nr-PRS-RSRP_) which require
measurement gaps or start/stop detection of subframe and slot timing towards
E-UTRA (_eutra-FineTimingDetection)_ which requires measurement gaps. UE shall
initiate this procedure only after successful AS security activation.
NOTE: It is a network decision to configure the measurement gap.
#### 5.5.6.2 Initiation
The UE shall:
1> if and only if upper layers indicate to start performing location
measurements towards E-UTRA or NR or start subframe and slot timing detection
towards E-UTRA, and the UE requires measurement gaps for these operations
while measurement gaps are either not configured or not sufficient:
2> initiate the procedure to indicate start;
NOTE 1: The UE verifies the measurement gap situation only upon receiving the
indication from upper layers. If at this point in time sufficient gaps are
available, the UE does not initiate the procedure. Unless it receives a new
indication from upper layers, the UE is only allowed to further repeat the
procedure in the same PCell once per frequency of the target RAT if the
provided measurement gaps are insufficient.
1> if and only if upper layers indicate to stop performing location
measurements towards E-UTRA or NR or stop subframe and slot timing detection
towards E-UTRA:
2> initiate the procedure to indicate stop.
NOTE 2: The UE may initiate the procedure to indicate stop even if it did not
previously initiate the procedure to indicate start.
#### 5.5.6.3 Actions related to transmission of
_LocationMeasurementIndication_ message
The UE shall set the contents of _LocationMeasurementIndication_ message as
follows:
1> if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of location related
measurements:
2> if the procedure is initiated for RSTD measurements towards E-UTRA:
3> set the _measurementIndication_ to the _eutra-RSTD_ according to the
information received from upper layers;
2> else if the procedure is initiated for positioning measurement towards NR:
3> set the _measurementIndication_ to the _nr-PRS-Measurement_ according to
the information received from upper layers;
1> else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of location related
measurements:
2> set the _measurementIndication_ to the value _release_ ;
1> if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of subframe and slot timing
detection towards E-UTRA:
2> set the _measurementIndication_ to the value _eutra-FineTimingDetection_ ;
1> else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of subframe and slot
timing detection towards E-UTRA:
2> set the _measurementIndication_ to the value _release_ ;
1> submit the _LocationMeasurementIndication_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends.

#### 5.6.1.4 Setting band combinations, feature set combinations and feature
sets supported by the UE
The UE invokes the procedures in this clause if the NR or E-UTRA network
requests UE capabilities for _nr_ , _eutra-nr_ or _eutra_. This procedure is
invoked once per requested _rat-Type_ (see clause 5.6.1.3 for capability
enquiry by the NR network; see TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.3.3 for capability
enquiry by the E-UTRA network). The UE shall ensure that the feature set IDs
are consistent across feature sets, feature set combinations and band
combinations in all three UE capability containers that the network queries
with the same fields with the same values, i.e. _UE-
CapabilityRequestFilterNR,_ _UE-CapabilityRequestFilterCommon_ and fields in
_UECapabilityEnquiry_ message (i.e. _requestedFreqBandsNR-MRDC,
requestedCapabilityNR, eutra-nr-only_ flag, and _requestedCapabilityCommon_)
as defined in TS 36.331, where applicable.
NOTE 1: Capability enquiry without _frequencyBandListFilter_ is not supported.
NOTE 2: In (NG)EN-DC, the gNB needs the capabilities for RAT types _nr_ and
_eutra-nr_ and it uses the _featureSets_ in the _UE-NR-Capability_ together
with the _featureSetCombinations_ in the _UE-MRDC-Capability_ to determine the
NR UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Similarly, the
eNB needs the capabilities for RAT types _eutra_ and _eutra-nr_ and it uses
the _featureSetsEUTRA_ in the _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ together with the
_featureSetCombinations_ in the _UE-MRDC-Capability_ to determine the E-UTRA
UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Hence, the IDs used
in the _featureSets_ must match the IDs referred to in
_featureSetCombinations_ across all three containers. The requirement on
consistency implies that there are no undefined feature sets and feature set
combinations.
NOTE 3: If the UE cannot include all feature sets and feature set combinations
due to message size or list size constraints, it is up to UE implementation
which feature sets and feature set combinations it prioritizes.
The UE shall:
1> compile a list of \"candidate band combinations\" according to the filter
criteria in _capabilityRequestFilterCommon_ (if included), only consisting of
bands included in _frequencyBandListFilter_ , and prioritized in the order of
_frequencyBandListFilter_ (i.e. first include band combinations containing the
first-listed band, then include remaining band combinations containing the
second-listed band, and so on), where for each band in the band combination,
the parameters of the band do not exceed _maxBandwidthRequestedDL_ ,
_maxBandwidthRequestedUL_ , _maxCarriersRequestedDL_ ,
_maxCarriersRequestedUL_ , _ca-BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA_ or _ca-
BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA_ , whichever are received;
1> for each band combination included in the list of \"candidate band
combinations\":
2> if the network (E-UTRA) included the _eutra-nr-only_ field, or
2> if the requested _rat-Type_ is _eutra_ :
3> remove the NR-only band combination from the list of \"candidate band
combinations\";
NOTE 4: The (E-UTRA) network may request capabilities for _nr_ but indicate
with the _eutra-nr-only_ flag that the UE shall not include any NR band
combinations in the _UE-NR-Capability_. In this case the procedural text above
removes all NR-only band combinations from the candidate list and thereby also
avoids inclusion of corresponding feature set combinations and feature sets
below.
2> if it is regarded as a fallback band combination with the same capabilities
of another band combination included in the list of \"candidate band
combinations\", and
2> if this fallback band combination is generated by releasing at least one
SCell or uplink configuration of SCell or SUL according to TS 38.306 [26]:
3> remove the band combination from the list of \"candidate band
combinations\";
NOTE 5: Even if the network requests (only) capabilities for _nr_ , it may
include E-UTRA band numbers in the _frequencyBandListFilter_ to ensure that
the UE includes all necessary feature sets needed for subsequently requested
_eutra-nr_ capabilities. At this point of the procedure the list of
\"candidate band combinations\" contains all NR- and/or E-UTRA-NR band
combinations that match the filter (_frequencyBandListFilter_) provided by the
NW and that match the _eutra-nr-only_ flag (if RAT-Type _nr_ is requested by
E-UTRA). In the following, this candidate list is used to derive the band
combinations, feature set combinations and feature sets to be reported in the
requested capability container.
1> if the requested _rat-Type_ is _nr_ :
2> include into _supportedBandCombinationList_ as many NR-only band
combinations as possible from the list of \"candidate band combinations\",
starting from the first entry;
3> if _srs-SwitchingTimeRequest_ is received:
4> if SRS carrier switching is supported;
5> include _srs-SwitchingTimesListNR_ for each band combination;
4> set _srs-SwitchingTimeRequested_ to _true_ ;
2> include, into _featureSetCombinations_ , the feature set combinations
referenced from the supported band combinations as included in
_supportedBandCombinationList_ according to the previous;
2> compile a list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" referenced from
the list of \"candidate band combinations\" excluding entries (rows in feature
set combinations) with same or lower capabilities;
2> if _uplinkTxSwitchRequest_ is received:
3> include into _supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch_ as many NR-only

5> set _srs-SwitchingTimeRequested_ to true;
3> include, into _featureSetCombinations_ , the feature set combinations
referenced from the supported band combinations as included in s
_upportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch_ according to the previous;
NOTE 6: This list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" contains the
feature set combinations used for NR-only as well as E-UTRA-NR band
combinations. It is used to derive a list of NR feature sets referred to from
the feature set combinations in the _UE-NR-Capability_ and from the feature
set combinations in a _UE-MRDC-Capability_ container.
2> include into _featureSets_ the feature sets referenced from the \"candidate
feature set combinations\" and may exclude the feature sets with the
parameters that exceed any of _maxBandwidthRequestedDL_ ,
_maxBandwidthRequestedUL_ , _maxCarriersRequestedDL_ or
_maxCarriersRequestedUL_ , whichever are received;
1> else, if the requested _rat-Type_ is _eutra-nr_ :
2> include into _supportedBandCombinationList_ and/or
_supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only_ as many E-UTRA-NR band combinations as
possible from the list of \"candidate band combinations\", starting from the
first entry;
3> if _srs-SwitchingTimeRequest_ is received:
4> if SRS carrier switching is supported;
5> include _srs-SwitchingTimesListNR_ and _srs-SwitchingTimesListEUTRA_ for
each band combination;
4> set _srs-SwitchingTimeRequested_ to _true_ ;
2> include, into _featureSetCombinations_ , the feature set combinations
referenced from the supported band combinations as included in
_supportedBandCombinationList_ according to the previous;
2> if _uplinkTxSwitchRequest_ is received:
3> include into _supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch_ as many E-UTRA-
NR band combinations that supported UL TX switching as possible from the list
of \"candidate band combinations\", starting from the first entry;
4> if _srs-SwitchingTimeRequest_ is received:
5> if SRS carrier switching is supported;
6> include _srs-SwitchingTimesListNR_ and _srs-SwitchingTimesListEUTRA_ for
each band combination;
5> set _srs-SwitchingTimeRequested_ to true;
3> include, into _featureSetCombinations_ , the feature set combinations
referenced from the supported band combinations as included in
_supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch_ according to the previous;
1> else (if the requested _rat-Type_ is _eutra_):
2> compile a list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" referenced from
the list of \"candidate band combinations\" excluding entries (rows in feature
set combinations) with same or lower capabilities;
NOTE 7: This list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" contains the
feature set combinations used for E-UTRA-NR band combinations. It is used to
derive a list of E-UTRA feature sets referred to from the feature set
combinations in a _UE-MRDC-Capability_ container.
2> include into _featureSetsEUTRA_ (in the _UE-EUTRA-Capability)_ the feature
sets referenced from the \"candidate feature set combinations\" and may
exclude the feature sets with the parameters that exceed _ca-BandwidthClassDL-
EUTRA_ or _ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA_ , whichever are received;

## 5.8 Sidelink
### 5.8.1 General
NR sidelink communication consists of unicast, groupcast and broadcast. For
unicast, the PC5-RRC connection is a logical connection between a pair of a
Source Layer-2 ID and a Destination Layer-2 ID in the AS. The PC5-RRC
signalling, as specified in clause 5.8.9, can be initiated after its
corresponding PC5 unicast link establishment (TS 23.287 [55]). The PC5-RRC
connection and the corresponding sidelink SRBs and sidelink DRB(s) are
released when the PC5 unicast link is released as indicated by upper layers.
For each PC5-RRC connection of unicast, one sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB0) is
used to transmit the PC5-S message(s) before the PC5-S security has been
established. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB1) is used to transmit the PC5-S
messages to establish the PC5-S security. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB2) is
used to transmit the PC5-S messages after the PC5-S security has been
established, which is protected. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB3) is used to
transmit the PC5-RRC signalling, which is protected and only sent after the
PC5-S security has been established.
For unicast of NR sidelink communication, AS security comprises of integrity
protection of PC5 signalling (SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3) and user data (SL-
DRBs), and it further comprises of ciphering of PC5 signaling (SL-SRB1 only
for the Direct Link Security Mode Complete message as specified in TS
24.587[57], SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3) and user data (SL-DRBs). The ciphering and
integrity protection algorithms and parameters for a PC5 unicast link are
exchanged by PC5-S messages in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536
[60], and apply to the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in the AS. Once AS
security is activated for a PC5 unicast link in the upper layers as specified
in TS 33.536 [60], all messages on SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3 and/or user data on SL-
DRBs of the corresponding PC5-RRC connection are integrity protected and/or
ciphered by the PDCP.
For unicast of NR sidelink communication, if the change of the key is
indicated by the upper layers as specified in TS 24.587 [57], UE re-
establishes the PDCP entity of the SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2, SL-SRB3 and SL-DRBs on
the corresponding PC5-RRC connection.
NOTE 1: In case the configurations for NR sidelink communication are acquired
via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in _SIB12_
and _sl-ConfigDedicatedNR_ within _RRCReconfiguration_ used in clause 5.8 are
provided by the configurations in _SystemInformationBlockType28_ and _sl-
ConfigDedicatedForNR_ within _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ as specified in TS
36.331 [10], respectively.
NOTE 2: In this release, there is one-to-one correspondence between the
PC5-RRC connection and the PC5 unicast link as specified in TS 38.300[2].
NOTE 3: All SL-DRBs related to the same PC5-RRC connection have the same
activation/deactivation setting for ciphering and the same
activation/deactivation setting for integrity protection as in TS 33.536 [60].
NOTE 4: When integrity check failure concerning SL-SRB1 for a specific
destination is detected, the UE sends an indication to the upper layers [57].
NOTE 5: The selection of NULL algorithms means that the PC5 messages are
considered protected for the purposes of being allowed to be sent or received.
### 5.8.2 Conditions for NR sidelink communication operation
The UE shall perform NR sidelink communication operation only if the
conditions defined in this clause are met:
1> if the UE\'s serving cell is suitable (RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or
RRC_CONNECTED); and if either the selected cell on the frequency used for NR
sidelink communication operation belongs to the registered or equivalent PLMN
as specified in TS 24.587 [57] or the UE is out of coverage on the frequency
used for NR sidelink communication operation as defined in TS 38.304 [20] and
TS 36.304 [27]; or
1> if the UE\'s serving cell (RRC_IDLE or RRC_CONNECTED) fulfils the
conditions to support NR sidelink communication in limited service state as
specified in TS 23.287 [55]; and if either the serving cell is on the
frequency used for NR sidelink communication operation or the UE is out of
coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication operation as
defined in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 36.304 [27]; or
1> if the UE has no serving cell (RRC_IDLE);
### 5.8.3 Sidelink UE information for NR sidelink communication
#### 5.8.3.1 General
Figure 5.8.3.1-1: Sidelink UE information for NR sidelink communication
The purpose of this procedure is to inform the network that the UE:
\- is interested or no longer interested to receive or transmit NR sidelink
communication,
\- is requesting assignment or release of transmission resource for NR
sidelink communication,
\- is reporting QoS parameters and QoS profile(s) related to NR sidelink
communication,
\- is reporting that a sidelink radio link failure or sidelink RRC
reconfiguration failure has been detected,
\- is reporting the sidelink UE capability information of the associated peer
UE for unicast communication,
\- is reporting the RLC mode information of the sidelink data radio bearer(s)
received from the associated peer UE for unicast communication.
#### 5.8.3.2 Initiation
A UE capable of NR sidelink communication that is in RRC_CONNECTED may
initiate the procedure to indicate it is (interested in) receiving or
transmitting NR sidelink communication in several cases including upon
successful connection establishment or resuming, upon change of interest, upon
changing QoS profiles, upon receiving _UECapabilityInformationSidelink_ from
the associated peer UE, upon RLC mode information updated from the associated
peer UE or upon change to a PCell providing _SIB12_ including _sl-
ConfigCommonNR_. A UE capable of NR sidelink communication may initiate the
procedure to request assignment of dedicated sidelink DRB configuration and
transmission resources for NR sidelink communication transmission. A UE
capable of NR sidelink communication may initiate the procedure to report to
the network that a sidelink radio link failure or sidelink RRC reconfiguration
failure has been declared.
Upon initiating this procedure, the UE shall:
1> if _SIB12_ including _sl-ConfigCommonNR_ is provided by the PCell:
2> ensure having a valid version of _SIB12_ for the PCell;
2> if configured by upper layers to receive NR sidelink communication on the
frequency included in _sl-FreqInfoList_ in _SIB12_ of the PCell:
3> if the UE did not transmit a _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message since last
entering RRC_CONNECTED state; or
3> if since the last time the UE transmitted a _SidelinkUEInformationNR_
message the UE connected to a PCell not providing _SIB12_ including _sl-
ConfigCommonNR_ ; or
3> if the last transmission of the _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message did not
include _sl-RxInterestedFreqList_ ; or if the frequency configured by upper
layers to receive NR sidelink communication on has changed since the last
transmission of the _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message:
4> initiate transmission of the _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message to indicate
the NR sidelink communication reception frequency of interest in accordance
with 5.8.3.3;
2> else:
3> if the last transmission of the _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message included
_sl-RxInterestedFreqList_ :
4> initiate transmission of the _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message to indicate
it is no longer interested in NR sidelink communication reception in
accordance with 5.8.3.3;
2> if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication on the
frequency included in _sl-FreqInfoList_ in _SIB12_ of the PCell:
3> if the UE did not transmit a _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message since last
entering RRC_CONNECTED state; or
3> if since the last time the UE transmitted a _SidelinkUEInformationNR_
message the UE connected to a PCell not providing _SIB12_ including _sl-
ConfigCommonNR_ ; or
3> if the last transmission of the _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message did not
include _sl-TxResourceReqList_ ; or if the information carried by the _sl-
TxResourceReqList_ has changed since the last transmission of the
_SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message:
4> initiate transmission of the _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message to indicate
the NR sidelink communication transmission resources required by the UE in
accordance with 5.8.3.3;
2> else:
3> if the last transmission of the _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message included
_sl-TxResourceReqList_ :
4> initiate transmission of the _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message to indicate
it no longer requires NR sidelink communication transmission resources in
accordance with 5.8.3.3.
#### 5.8.3.3 Actions related to transmission of _SidelinkUEInformationNR_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message as
follows:
1> if the UE initiates the procedure to indicate it is (no more) interested to
receive NR sidelink communication or to request (configuration/ release) of NR
sidelink communication transmission resources or to report to the network that
a sidelink radio link failure or sidelink RRC reconfiguration failure has been
declared (i.e. UE includes all concerned information, irrespective of what

### 5.8.10 Sidelink measurement
#### 5.8.10.1 Introduction
The UE may configure the associated peer UE to perform NR sidelink measurement
and report on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in accordance with the NR
sidelink measurement configuration for unicast by _RRCReconfigurationSidelink_
message.
The NR sidelink measurement configuration includes the following parameters
for a PC5-RRC connection:
**1\. NR sidelink measurement objects:** Object(s) on which the associated
peer UE shall perform the NR sidelink measurements.
\- For NR sidelink measurement, a NR sidelink measurement object indicates the
NR sidelink frequency of reference signals to be measured.
**2\. NR sidelink reporting configurations:** NR sidelink measurement
reporting configuration(s) where there can be one or multiple NR sidelink
reporting configurations per NR sidelink measurement object. Each NR sidelink
reporting configuration consists of the following:
\- Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a NR
sidelink measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event
description.
\- RS type: The RS that the UE uses for NR sidelink measurement results. In
this release, only DMRS is supported for NR sidelink measurement.
\- Reporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement
report. In this release, only RSRP measurement is supported.
**3\. NR sidelink measurement identities:** A list of NR sidelink measurement
identities where each NR sidelink measurement identity links one NR sidelink
measurement object with one NR sidelink reporting configuration. By
configuring multiple NR sidelink measurement identities, it is possible to
link more than one NR sidelink measurement object to the same NR sidelink
reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one NR sidelink
reporting configuration to the same NR sidelink measurement object. The NR
sidelink measurement identity is also included in the NR sidelink measurement
report that triggered the reporting, serving as a reference to the network.
**4\. NR sidelink quantity configurations:** The NR sidelink quantity
configuration defines the NR sidelink measurement filtering configuration used
for all event evaluation and related reporting, and for periodical reporting
of that NR sidelink measurement. In each configuration, different filter
coefficients can be configured for different NR sidelink measurement
quantities.
Both UEs of the PC5-RRC connection maintains a NR sidelink measurement object
list, a NR sidelink reporting configuration list, and a NR sidelink
measurement identities list according to signalling and procedures in this
specification.

#### 5.8.10.3 Performing NR sidelink measurements
##### 5.8.10.3.1 General
A UE shall derive NR sidelink measurement results by measuring one or multiple
DMRS associated per PC5-RRC connection as configured by the peer UE
associated, as described in 5.8.10.3.2. For all NR sidelink measurement
results the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in clause 5.5.3.2,
before using the measured results for evaluation of reporting criteria and
measurement reporting. In this release, only NR sidelink RSRP can be
configured as trigger quantity and reporting quantity.
The UE shall:
1> for each _sl-MeasId_ included in the _sl-MeasIdList_ within
_VarMeasConfigSL_ :
2> if the _sl-MeasObject_ is associated to NR sidelink and the _sl-RS-Type_ is

_sl-EventId_ of the corresponding _sl-ReportConfig_ within _VarMeasConfigSL_ ,
is fulfilled for NR sidelink frequency not included in the _sl-
FrequencyTriggeredList_ for all NR sidelink measurements after layer 3
filtering taken during _sl-TimeToTrigger_ defined for this event within the
_VarMeasConfigSL_ (a subsequent NR sidelink frequency triggers the event):
3> set the _sl-NumberOfReportsSent_ defined within the _VarMeasReportListSL_
for this _sl-MeasId_ to 0;
3> include the concerned NR sidelink frequency in the _sl-
FrequencyTriggeredList_ defined within the _VarMeasReportListSL_ for this _sl-

_VarMeasReportListSL_ for this _sl-MeasId_ for all NR sidelink measurements
after layer 3 filtering taken during _sl-TimeToTrigger_ defined within the
_VarMeasConfigSL_ for this event:
3> remove the concerned NR sidelink frequency in the _sl-
FrequencyTriggeredList_ defined within the _VarMeasReportListSL_ for this _sl-
MeasId_ ;
3> if _sl-ReportOnLeave_ is set to _true_ for the corresponding reporting
configuration:

5.8.10.5, immediately after the quantity to be reported becomes available for
the NR sidelink frequency:
2> upon expiry of the periodical reporting timer for this _sl-MeasId_ :
3> initiate the NR sidelink measurement reporting procedure, as specified in

##### 5.8.10.4.2 Event S1 (Serving becomes better than threshold)
The UE shall:
1> consider the entering condition for this event to be satisfied when
condition S1-1, as specified below, is fulfilled;
1> consider the leaving condition for this event to be satisfied when
condition S1-2, as specified below, is fulfilled;

corresponding to the associated _sl-MeasObject_ associated with this event.
Inequality S1-1 (Entering condition)
_Ms -- Hys > Thresh_
Inequality S1-2 (Leaving condition)
_Ms + Hys \  consider the entering condition for this event to be satisfied when
condition S2-1, as specified below, is fulfilled;
1> consider the leaving condition for this event to be satisfied when
condition S2-2, as specified below, is fulfilled;
1> for this NR sidelink measurement, consider the NR sidelink frequency
indicated by the _sl-MeasObject_ associated to this event.
Inequality S2-1 (Entering condition)
_Ms + Hys \  Thresh_
The variables in the formula are defined as follows:
**_Ms_** is the NR sidelink measurement result of the NR sidelink frequency,
not taking into account any offsets.
**_Hys_** is the hysteresis parameter for this event (i.e. _sl-Hysteresis_ as
defined within _sl-ReportConfig_ for this event).
**_Thresh_** is the threshold parameter for this event (i.e. _s2-Threshold_ as
defined within _sl-ReportConfig_ for this event).
**_Ms_** is expressed in dBm in case of RSRP.
**_Hys_** is expressed in dB.
**_Thresh_** is expressed in the same unit as **_Ms_**.
#### 5.8.10.5 Sidelink measurement reporting
##### 5.8.10.5.1 General
Figure 5.8.10.5.1-1: NR sidelink measurement reporting
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer measurement results from the UE
to the peer UE associated.
For the _sl-MeasId_ for which the NR sidelink measurement reporting procedure
was triggered, the UE shall set the _sl-MeasResults_ within the
_MeasurementReportSidelink_ message as follows:
1> set the _sl-MeasId_ to the measurement identity that triggered the NR
sidelink measurement reporting;
1> if the _sl-ReportConfig_ associated with the _sl-MeasId_ that triggered the
NR sidelink measurement reporting is set to _sl-EventTriggered_ or _sl-
Periodical_ :
2> set _sl-ResultDMRS_ within _sl-MeasResult_ to include the NR sidelink DMRS
based quantity indicated in the _sl-ReportQuantity_ within the concerned _sl-
ReportConfig_ ;
1> increment the _sl-NumberOfReportsSent_ as defined within the
_VarMeasReportListSL_ for this _sl-MeasId_ by 1;
1> stop the periodical reporting timer, if running;
1> if the _sl-NumberOfReportsSent_ as defined within the _VarMeasReportListSL_
for this _sl-MeasId_ is less than the _sl-ReportAmount_ as defined within the
corresponding _sl-ReportConfig_ for this _sl-MeasId_ :
2> start the periodical reporting timer with the value of _sl-ReportInterval_
as defined within the corresponding _sl-ReportConfig_ for this _sl-MeasId_ ;
1> else:
2> if the _sl-ReportType_ is set to _sl-Periodical_ :
3> remove the entry within the _VarMeasReportListSL_ for this _sl-MeasId_ ;
3> remove this _sl-MeasId_ from the _sl-MeasIdList_ within _VarMeasConfigSL_ ;
1> submit the _MeasurementReportSidelink_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
### 5.8.11 Zone identity calculation
The UE shall determine an identity of the zone (i.e. Zone_id) in which it is
located using the following formulae, if _sl-ZoneConfig_ is configured:
_x_ ~1~= Floor (_x_ / _L_) Mod 64;
_y_ ~1~= Floor (_y_ / _L_) Mod 64;
Zone_id = _y_ ~1~ * 64 + _x_ ~1~.
The parameters in the formulae are defined as follows:
**L** is the value of _sl-ZoneLength_ included in _sl-ZoneConfig_ ;
**x** is the geodesic distance in longitude between UE\'s current location and
geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [58] and it is
expressed in meters;
**y** is the geodesic distance in latitude between UE\'s current location and
geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [58] and it is
expressed in meters.
NOTE: How the calculated zone_id is used is specified in TS 38.321 [3].
### 5.8.12 DFN derivation from GNSS
When the UE selects GNSS as the synchronization reference source, the DFN, the
subframe number within a frame and slot number within a frame used for NR
sidelink communication are derived from the current UTC time, by the following
formulae:
_DFN_ = Floor (0.1*(_Tcurrent_ \--_Tref--OffsetDFN_)) mod 1024
_SubframeNumber_ = Floor (_Tcurrent_ \--_Tref--OffsetDFN_) mod 10
_SlotNumber_ = Floor ((_Tcurrent_ \--Tref--_OffsetDFN_)*2^μ^) mod (10*2^μ^)
Where:
**_Tcurrent_** is the current UTC time obtained from GNSS. This value is
expressed in milliseconds;
**_Tref_** is the reference UTC time 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1
January, 1900 (midnight between Thursday, December 31, 1899 and Friday,
January 1, 1900). This value is expressed in milliseconds;
**_OffsetDFN_** is the value _sl-OffsetDFN_ if configured, otherwise it is
zero. This value is expressed in milliseconds.
μ=0/1/2/3 corresponding to the 15/30/60/120 kHz of SCS for SL, respectively.
NOTE 1: In case of leap second change event, how UE obtains the scheduled time
of leap second change to adjust _Tcurrent_ correspondingly is left to UE
implementation. How UE handles to avoid the sudden discontinuity of DFN is
left to UE implementation.
NOTE 2: Void.
# 6 Protocol data units, formats and parameters (ASN.1)
## 6.1 General
### 6.1.1 Introduction
The contents of each RRC message is specified in clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to
specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further
detailed information about the fields specified in the message syntax. The
syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone abstract
types is further specified in a similar manner in clause 6.3.
Usage of the text \"Network always configures the UE with a value for this
field\" in the field description indicates that the network has to provide a
value for the field in this or in a previous message based on delta
configuration (for an optional field with Need M). It does not imply a
mandatory presence of the field.
### 6.1.2 Need codes and conditions for optional fields
The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the
ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1),
is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the OPTIONAL statement
in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available for use in the
downlink direction for RRC message and in the sidelink for PC5 RRC message.
The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1.2-1.
If conditions are used, a conditional presence table is provided for the
message or information element specifying the need of the field for each
condition case. The table also specifies whether UE maintains or releases the
value in case the field is absent. The conditions clarify what the UE may
expect regarding the setting of the message by the network for the RRC message
or by the peer UE in the sidelink RRC message. Violation of conditions is
regarded as invalid network behaviour when transmitting downlink RRC message
or invalid UE behavior when transmitting PC5 RRC message, which the UE is not
required to cope with. Hence the general error handling defined in 10.4 does
not apply in case a field is absent although it is mandatory according to the
CondC or CondM condition.
For guidelines on the use of need codes and conditions, see Annex A.6 and A.7.
Table 6.1.2-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields to
be present
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Abbreviation | Meaning | +====================+================================================+ | Cond conditionTag | _Conditionally present_ | | | | | | Presence of the field is specified in a | | | tabular form following the ASN.1 segment. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | CondC conditionTag | _Configuration condition_ | | | | | | Presence of the field is conditional to other | | | configuration settings. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | CondM conditionTag | _Message condition_ | | | | | | Presence of the field is conditional to other | | | fields included in the message. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Need S | _Specified_ | | | | | | Used for (configuration) fields, whose field | | | description or procedure **specifies** the UE | | | behavior performed upon receiving a message | | | with the field absent (and not if field | | | description or procedure specifies the UE | | | behavior when field is not configured). | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Need M | _Maintain_ | | | | | | Used for (configuration) fields that are | | | stored by the UE i.e. not one-shot. Upon | | | receiving a message with the field absent, the | | | UE maintains the current value. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Need N | _No action (one-shot configuration that is not | | | maintained)_ | | | | | | Used for (configuration) fields that are not | | | stored and whose presence causes a one-time | | | action by the UE. Upon receiving message with | | | the field absent, the UE takes no action. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Need R | _Release_ | | | | | | Used for (configuration) fields that are | | | stored by the UE i.e. not one-shot. Upon | | | receiving a message with the field absent, the | | | UE releases the current value. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
NOTE: In this version of the specification, the condition tags CondC and CondM
are not used.
Any field with Need M or Need N in system information shall be interpreted as
Need R.
The need code used within a CondX definition only applies for the case (part
of the condition) where it is defined: A condition may have different need
codes for different parts of the condition. In particular, the CondX
definition may contain the following \"otherwise the field is absent\" parts:
\- \"Otherwise, the field is absent\": The field is not relevant or should not
be configured when this part of the condition applies. In particular, the UE
behaviour is not defined when the field is configured via another part of the
condition and is reconfigured to this part of the condition. A need code is
not provided when the transition from another part of the condition to this
part of the condition is not supported, when the field clearly is a one-shot
or there is no difference whether UE maintains or releases the value (e.g., in
case the field is mandatory present according to the other part of the
condition).
\- \"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need R\": The field is released if absent
when this part of the condition applies. This handles UE behaviour in case the
field is configured via another part of the condition and this part of the
condition applies (which means that network when transmitting downlink RRC
message or peer UE transmitting PC5 RRC message can assume UE releases the
field if this part of the condition is valid).
\- \"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need M\": The UE retains the field if it
was already configured when this part of the condition applies. This means the
network when transmitting downlink RRC message or the peer UE when
transmitting PC5 RRC message cannot release the field , but UE retains the
previously configured value.
Use of different Need codes in different parts of a condition should be
avoided.
For downlink RRC message and sidelink PC5 RRC messages, the need codes,
conditions and ASN.1 defaults specified for a particular (child) field only
apply in case the (parent) field including the particular field is present.
Thus, if the parent is absent the UE shall not release the field unless the
absence of the parent field implies that.
For (parent) fields without need codes in downlink RRC messages or sidelink
PC5 RRC message, if the parent field is absent, UE shall follow the need codes
of the child fields. Thus, if parent field is absent, the need code of each
child field is followed (i.e. Need R child fields are released, Need M child
fields are not modified and the actions for Need S child fields depend on the
specified conditions of each field). Examples of (parent) fields in downlink
RRC messages and sidelink PC5 RRC message without need codes where this rule
applies are:
\- _nonCriticalExtension_ fields at the end of a message using empty SEQUENCE
extension mechanism,
\- groups of non-critical extensions using double brackets (referred to as
extension groups), and
\- non-critical extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a
structure, contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent
extension fields).
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by
means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1 OPTIONAL, -- Need M
field2 InformationElement2 OPTIONAL, -- Need R
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v1570-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-1570-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need M
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v1640-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v1640-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field4 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need R
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
InformationElement1 ::= SEQUENCE {

field14 InformationElement14 OPTIONAL -- Need M
]]
}
InformationElement2 ::= SEQUENCE {
field21 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, -- Need M
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:
\- if _field1_ in _RRCMessage-IEs_ is absent, UE does not modify or take
action on any child fields configured within _field1_ (regardless of their
need codes);
\- if _field2_ in _RRCMessage-IEs_ is absent, UE releases the _field2_ (and
also its child field _field21_);
\- if _field1_ or _field2_ in _RRCMessage-IEs_ is present, UE retains or
releases their child fields according to the child field presence conditions;
\- if _field1_ in _RRCMessage-IEs_ is present but the extension group
containing _field13_ and _field14_ is absent, the UE releases _field13_ but
does not modify _field14_ ;
\- if _nonCriticalExtension_ defined by IE _RRCMessage-v1570-IEs_ is absent,
the UE does not modify _field3_ but releases _field4_ ;
### 6.1.3 General rules
In the ASN.1 of this specification, the first bit of a bit string refers to
the leftmost bit, unless stated otherwise.
Upon reception of a list not using ToAddModList and ToReleaseList structure,
the UE shall delete all entries of the list currently in the UE configuration
before applying the received list and shall consider each entry as newly
created. This applies also to lists whose size is extended (i.e. with a second
list structure in the ASN.1 comprising additional entries), unless otherwise
specified. This implies that Need M should not be used for fields in the
entries of these lists; if used, UE will handle such fields equivalent to a
Need R.

For | | operation with shared spectrum channel access (see 37.213 [48]), | | this field corresponds to ${\overline{k}}_{\text{SSB}}$, and k~SSB~ | | is obtained from ${\overline{k}}_{\text{SSB}}$ (see TS 38.211 | | [16], clause 7.4.3.1); the LSB of this field is used also for | | deriving the QCL relation between SS/PBCH blocks as specified in TS | | 38.213 [13], clause 4.1. | | | | The value range of this field may be extended by an additional most | | significant bit encoded within PBCH as specified in TS 38.213 | | [13]. | | | | This field may indicate that this cell does not provide _SIB1_ and | | that there is hence no CORESET#0 configured in _MIB_ (see TS 38.213 | | [13], clause 13). In this case, the field _pdcch-ConfigSIB1_ may | | indicate the frequency positions where the UE may (not) find a | | SS/PBCH with a control resource set and search space for _SIB1_ (see | | TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_subCarrierSpacingCommon_** | | | | Subcarrier spacing for _SIB1_ , Msg.2/4 and MsgB for initial access, | | paging and broadcast SI-messages. If the UE acquires this _MIB_ on | | an FR1 carrier frequency, the value _scs15or60_ corresponds to 15 | | kHz and the value _scs30or120_ corresponds to 30 kHz. If the UE | | acquires this _MIB_ on an FR2 carrier frequency, the value | | _scs15or60_ corresponds to 60 kHz and the value _scs30or120_ | | corresponds to 120 kHz. For operation with shared spectrum channel | | access (see 37.213 [48]), the subcarrier spacing for _SIB1_ , | | Msg.2/4 and MsgB for initial access, paging and broadcast | | SI-messages is same as that for the corresponding SSB and this field | | instead is used for deriving the QCL relation **between SS/PBCH | | blocks as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1**. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_systemFrameNumber_** | | | | The 6 most significant bits (MSB) of the 10-bit System Frame Number | | (SFN).

#### \-- _BWP_
The IE _BWP_ is used to configure generic parameters of a bandwidth part as
defined in TS 38.211 [16], clause 4.5, and TS 38.213 [13], clause 12.
For each serving cell the network configures at least an initial downlink
bandwidth part and one (if the serving cell is configured with an uplink) or
two (if using supplementary uplink (SUL)) initial uplink bandwidth parts.
Furthermore, the network may configure additional uplink and downlink
bandwidth parts for a serving cell.
The uplink and downlink bandwidth part configurations are divided into common
and dedicated parameters.

_CIF-PRESENCE_ The field is mandatory present if the _cif-Presence_ is set to
_true_. The field is absent otherwise.
#### \-- _CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList_
The _CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList_ IE is used to configure the UE with a list
of aperiodic trigger states. Each codepoint of the DCI field \"CSI request\"
is associated with one trigger state (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 6.1.3.13).
Upon reception of the value associated with a trigger state, the UE will
perform measurement of CSI-RS, CSI-IM and/or SSB (reference signals) and
aperiodic reporting on L1 according to all entries in the
_associatedReportConfigInfoList_ for that trigger state.

#### \-- _PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList_
The IE _PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation_ is used to configure a time domain
relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. The _PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList_
contains one or more of such _PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocations_. The
network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain
allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. The UE determines the
bit width of the DCI field based on the number of entries in the _PDSCH-
TimeDomainResourceAllocationList_. Value 0 in the DCI field refers to the
first element in this list, value 1 in the DCI field refers to the second
element in this list, and so on.

#### \-- _ReportConfigNR_
The IE _ReportConfigNR_ specifies criteria for triggering of an NR measurement
reporting event or of a CHO or CPC event. For events labelled AN with N equal
to 1, 2 and so on, measurement reporting events and CHO or CPC events are
based on cell measurement results, which can either be derived based on
SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS.
Event A1: Serving becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event A2: Serving becomes worse than absolute threshold;
Event A3: Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than PCell/PSCell;
Event A4: Neighbour becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event A5: PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND
Neighbour/SCell becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
Event A6: Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than SCell;
CondEvent A3: Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes amount of offset
better than PCell/PSCell;
CondEvent A5: PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND
Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes better than another absolute
threshold2;
For event I1, measurement reporting event is based on CLI measurement results,
which can either be derived based on SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI.
Event I1: Interference becomes higher than absolute threshold.

The most significant (left) bit represents the first | | OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit | | represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) | | set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource | | set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to | | extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be | | ignored by the UE or IAB-MT. | | | | For DCI format 2_0, the first one symbol applies if the _duration_ | | of CORESET (in the IE _ControlResourceSet_) identified by | | _controlResourceSetId_ indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols | | apply if the _duration_ of CORESET identified by | | _controlResourceSetId_ indicates 2 symbols, and the first three | | symbols apply if the _duration_ of CORESET identified by | | _controlResourceSetId_ indicates 1 symbol. | | | | See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10. | | | | For IAB-MT: For DCI format 2_0 or DCI format 2_5, the first one | | symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE | | _ControlResourceSet_) identified by _controlResourceSetId_ indicates | | 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the _duration_ of CORESET | | identified by _controlResourceSetId_ indicates 2 symbols, and the | | first three symbols apply if the _duration_ of CORESET identified by | | _controlResourceSetId_ indicates 1 symbol. | | | | See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_nrofCandidates-CI_** | | | | The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-4 for the | | configured aggregation level. If an aggregation level is absent, the | | UE does not search for any candidates with that aggregation level. | | The network configures only one aggregationLevel and the | | corresponding number of candidates (see TS 38.213 [13], clause | | 10.1). | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_nrofCandidates-SFI_** | | | | The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-0 for the | | configured aggregation level. If an aggregation level is absent, the | | UE does not search for any candidates with that aggregation level. | | The network configures only one aggregationLevel and the | | corresponding number of candidates (see TS 38.213 [13], clause | | 11.1.1). For a search space configured with | | _freqMonitorLocations-r16_ , only value ′n1′ is valid. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_nrofCandidates_** | | | | Number of PDCCH candidates per aggregation level. The number of | | candidates and aggregation levels configured here applies to all | | formats unless a particular value is specified or a format-specific | | value is provided (see inside _searchSpaceType_). If configured in | | the _SearchSpace_ of a cross carrier scheduled cell, this field | | determines the number of candidates and aggregation levels to be | | used on the linked scheduling cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause | | 10). | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_searchSpaceGroupIdList_** | | | | List of search space group IDs which the search space is associated | | with. The network configures at most 2 search space groups per BWP | | where the group ID is either 0 or 1. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_searchSpaceId_** | | | | Identity of the search space. SearchSpaceId = 0 identifies the | | _searchSpaceZero_ configured via PBCH (MIB) or | | _ServingCellConfigCommon_ and may hence not be used in the | | _SearchSpace_ IE. The _searchSpaceId_ is unique among the BWPs of a | | Serving Cell. In case of cross carrier scheduling, search spaces | | with the same _searchSpaceId_ in scheduled cell and scheduling cell | | are linked to each other. The UE applies the search space for the | | scheduled cell only if the DL BWPs in which the linked search spaces | | are configured in scheduling cell and scheduled cell are both | | active. | | | | For an IAB-MT, the search space defines how/where to search for | | PDCCH candidates for an IAB-MT. Each search space is associated with | | one ControlResearchSet. For a scheduled cell in the case of cross | | carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the optional | | fields are absent. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_searchSpaceType_** | | | | Indicates whether this is a common search space (present) or a UE | | specific search space as well as DCI formats to monitor for. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_ue-Specific_** | | | | Configures this search space as UE specific search space (USS).

#### \-- _ServingCellConfigCommon_
The IE _ServingCellConfigCommon_ is used to configure cell specific parameters
of a UE\'s serving cell. The IE contains parameters which a UE would typically
acquire from SSB, MIB or SIBs when accessing the cell from IDLE. With this IE,
the network provides this information in dedicated signalling when configuring
a UE with a SCells or with an additional cell group (SCG). It also provides it
for SpCells (MCG and SCG) upon reconfiguration with sync.

#### \-- _FeatureSetCombination_
The IE _FeatureSetCombination_ is a two-dimensional matrix of _FeatureSet_
entries.
Each _FeatureSetsPerBand_ contains a list of feature sets applicable to the
carrier(s) of one band entry of the associated band combination. Across the
associated bands, the UE shall support the combination of _FeatureSets_ at the
same position in the _FeatureSetsPerBand_. All _FeatureSetsPerBand_ in one
_FeatureSetCombination_ must have the same number of entries.
The number of _FeatureSetsPerBand_ in the _FeatureSetCombination_ must be
equal to the number of band entries in an associated band combination. The
first _FeatureSetPerBand_ applies to the first band entry of the band
combination, and so on.
Each _FeatureSet_ contains either a pair of NR or E-UTRA feature set IDs for
UL and DL.
In case of NR, the actual feature sets for UL and DL are defined in the
_FeatureSets_ IE and referred to from here by their ID, i.e., their position
in the _featureSetsUplink_ / _featureSetsDownlink_ list in the FeatureSet IE.
In case of E-UTRA, the feature sets referred to from this list are defined in
TS 36.331 [10] and conveyed as part of the _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ container.
The _FeatureSetUplink_ and _FeatureSetDownlink_ referred to from the
_FeatureSet_ comprise, among other information, a set of
_FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Ids_ and _FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Ids_. The number of
these per-CC IDs determines the number of carriers that the UE is able to
aggregate contiguously in frequency domain in the corresponding band. The
number of carriers supported by the UE is also restricted by the bandwidth
class indicated in the associated _BandCombination_ , if present.
In feature set combinations the UE shall exclude entries with same or lower
capabilities, since the network may anyway assume that the UE supports those.
NOTE 1: The UE may advertise fallback band-combinations in which it supports
additional functionality explicitly in two ways: Either by setting FeatureSet
IDs to zero (inter-band and intra-band non-contiguous fallback) and by
reducing the number of FeatureSet-PerCC Ids in a Feature Set (intra-band
contiguous fallback). Or by separate _BandCombination_ entries with associated
_FeatureSetCombinations_.
NOTE 2: The UE may advertise a _FeatureSetCombination_ containing only
fallback band combinations. That means, in a _FeatureSetCombination,_ each
group of _FeatureSets_ across the bands may contain at least one pair of
_FeatureSetUplinkId_ and _FeatureSetDownlinkId_ which is set to 0/0.
NOTE 3: The Network configures serving cell(s) and BWP(s) configuration to
comply with capabilities derived from the combination of FeatureSets at the
same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand, regardless of activated/deactivated
serving cell(s) and BWP(s).

#### \-- _FeatureSets_
The IE _FeatureSets_ is used to provide pools of downlink and uplink features
sets. A _FeatureSetCombination_ refers to the IDs of the feature set(s) that
the UE supports in that _FeatureSetCombination_. The _BandCombination_ entries
in the _BandCombinationList_ then indicate the ID of the
_FeatureSetCombination_ that the UE supports for that band combination.
The entries in the lists in this IE are identified by their index position.
For example, the _FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id_ = 4 identifies the 4^th^ element
in the _featureSetsUplinkPerCC_ list.
NOTE: When feature sets (per CC) IEs require extension in future versions of
the specification, new versions of the _FeatureSetDownlink_ ,
_FeatureSetUplink_ , _FeatureSets_ , _FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC_ and/or
_FeatureSetUplinkPerCC_ will be created and instantiated in corresponding new
lists in the _FeatureSets_ IE. For example, if new capability bits are to be
added to the _FeatureSetDownlink_ , they will instead be defined in a new
_FeatureSetDownlink-rxy_ which will be instantiated in a new
_featureSetDownlinkList-rxy_ list. If a UE indicates in a
_FeatureSetCombination_ that it supports the _FeatureSetDownlink_ with ID #5,
it implies that it supports both the features in _FeatureSetDownlink_ #5 and
_FeatureSetDownlink-rxy_ #5 (if present). The number of entries in the new
list(s) shall be the same as in the original list(s).

With this filter a UE may report a band combination n1A-n7A-n78A | | for NR-DC only if it supports that serving cells for n1 and n7 are | | in the MCG and a serving cell for n78 is in the SCG. The UE may also | | report a band combination n41C-n261M for NR-DC provided that it | | supports a serving cell for n41 in the MCG and a serving cell for | | n261 in the SCG. | | | | Example 2: One _requestedCellGrouping_ is set to _mcg_ =[n1, n7, | | n41, n66] and s _cg_ =[n78, n261] and another | | _requestedCellGrouping_ is set to _mcg_ =[n1, n7, n66] and s _cg_ =[ | | n41, n78, n261]. This assumes that the NW uses sometimes CA among | | n1, n7, n41 and n66 (as in example 1) and sometimes CA among n1, n7 | | and n66 but DC towards one or several of n41, n78, n261. If a UE | | supports n1A-n41A-n78A only if n41A and n78A are in the same cell | | group, this UE may only indicate cell grouping ID#1 (not #0) in | | its BC. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_uplinkTxSwitchRequest_** | | | | **_Only if this field is present, the UE supporting dynamic UL Tx | | switching shall indicate support for UL Tx switching in band | | combinations which are applicable to inter-band UL CA, SUL and | | (NG)EN-DC._** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

## 7.4 UE variables
NOTE: To facilitate the specification of the UE behavioural requirements, UE
variables are represented using ASN.1. Unless explicitly specified otherwise,
it is however up to UE implementation how to store the variables. The
optionality of the IEs in ASN.1 is used only to indicate that the values may
not always be available.

# 8 Protocol data unit abstract syntax
## 8.1 General
The RRC PDU contents in clause 6 and clause 10 are described using abstract
syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680 [6] and X.681
[7]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by
use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [8].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in
X.691:
\- When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to
15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the
leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value
shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field;
NOTE: The terms \'leading bit\' and \'trailing bit\' are defined in ITU-T Rec.
X.680. When using the \'bstring\' notation, the leading bit of the bit string
value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the
right.
\- When decoding types constrained with the ASN.1 Contents Constraint
(\"CONTAINING\"), automatic decoding of the contained type should not be
performed because errors in the decoding of the contained type should not
cause the decoding of the entire RRC message PDU to fail. It is recommended
that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that contains the OCTET
STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint, and then decodes the
contained type that is nested within the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING as a
separate step;
\- When decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a
Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents
Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are
extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC message PDU,
BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
## 8.2 Structure of encoded RRC messages
An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer
entities/across the radio interface contains the basic production as defined
in X.691.
RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC SDUs
(in case of PCCH, BCCH or CCCH) upon transmission and reception as follows:
\- when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for
transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first
bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and
\- when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for transmission,
the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the RLC
SDU and onwards; and
\- upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of the
PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards; and
\- upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the RLC
SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.
## 8.3 Basic production
The \'basic production\' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the abstract
syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It always contains
a multiple of 8 bits.
## 8.4 Extension
The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol extensions:
\- A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall,
unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the extension
part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may send non-empty
extensions;
\- A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall set
spare bits to zero.
## 8.5 Padding
If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC layer
shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH and BCCH.
Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a multiple of
8.
Figure 8.5-1: RRC level padding
# 9 Specified and default radio configurations
Specified and default configurations are configurations of which the details
are specified in the standard. Specified configurations are fixed while
default configurations can be modified using dedicated signalling. The default
value for the parameters not listed in following clauses shall be set such as
the corresponding features are not configured, i.e. _release_ or _false_
unless explicitly stated otherwise.
NOTE: The UE applies the default values specified in the field description of
ASN.1 parameters only when the parent IE is present. Hence, the UE does not
apply all default values in field descriptions when it applies the \"default
radio configuration\" in accordance with this clause.

### 9.1.2 Void
## 9.2 Default radio configurations
The following clauses only list default values for REL-15 parameters included
in protocol version v15.3.0. For all fields introduced in a later protocol
version, the default value is \"released\" or \"false\" unless explicitly
specified otherwise. If the UE is to apply default configuration while it is
configured with some critically extended fields, the UE shall apply the
original version of those fields with only default values.
NOTE 1: In general, the signalling should preferably support a \"release\"
option for fields introduced after v15.3.0. The \"value not applicable\"
should be used restrictively, mainly limited to for fields which value is
relevant only if another field is set to a value other than its default.
NOTE 2: For parameters in _ServingCellConfig_ , the default values are
specified in the corresponding specification.

# 10 Generic error handling
## 10.1 General
The generic error handling defined in the subsequent clauses applies unless
explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error
handling.
The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
\- to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer
syntax supported by the UE;
\- to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific
behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved
value.
The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
\- as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour
that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved field.
## 10.2 ASN.1 violation or encoding error
The UE shall:
1> when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, CCCH or PCCH or a PC5 RRC
message on SBCCH for which the abstract syntax is invalid [6]:
2> ignore the message.
NOTE: This clause applies in case one or more fields is set to a value, other
than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version of the
transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a field defined
as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may not be possible to reliably
detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message
level.
## 10.3 Field set to a not comprehended value
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message or PC5 RRC message on any logical
channel:
1> if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not
comprehend:
2> if a default value is defined for this field:
3> treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
2> else if the concerned field is optional:
3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the
need code for absence of the concerned field;
2> else:
3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with clause
10.4.
## 10.4 Mandatory field missing
The UE shall:
1> if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message
(e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field
is absent or treated as absent:
2> if the RRC message was not received on DCCH or CCCH; or
2> if the PC5 RRC message was not received on SCCH:
3> if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a SEQUENCE
OF):
4> treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended
field was absent;
3> else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as the
\'parent\' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to the
erroneous field:
4> consider the \'parent\' field to be set to a not comprehended value;
4> apply the generic error handling to the subsequent \'parent\' field(s),
until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;
3> else (field at message level):
4> ignore the message.
NOTE 1: The error handling defined in these clauses implies that the UE
ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not comprehended
value.
NOTE 2: The nested error handling for messages received on logical channels
other than DCCH, CCCH and SCCH applies for errors in extensions also, even for
errors that can be regarded as invalid network operation e.g. the network not
observing conditional presence.
NOTE 3: UE behaviour on receipt of an RRC message on DCCH or CCCH or a PC5 RRC
message on SCCH that does not include a field that is mandatory (e.g. because
conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) is unspecified.
The following ASN.1 further clarifies the levels applicable in case of nested
error handling for errors in extension fields.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
\-- Example with extension addition group
ItemInfoList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..max)) OFItemInfo
ItemInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
itemIdentity INTEGER (1..max),
field1 Field1,
field2 Field2 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...
[[
field3-r9 Field3-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Cond Cond1
field4-r9 Field4-r9 OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}
\-- Example with traditional non-critical extension (empty sequence)
BroadcastInfoBlock1 ::= SEQUENCE {
itemIdentity INTEGER (1..max),
field1 Field1,
field2 Field2 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
nonCriticalExtension BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs OPTIONAL
}
BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs::= SEQUENCE {
field3-r9 Field3-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Cond Cond1
field4-r9 Field4-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL -- Need S
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The UE shall, apply the following principles regarding the levels applicable
in case of nested error handling:
\- an extension addition group is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in
the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the conditionality of
_field3_ would result in the entire itemInfo entry to be ignored (rather than
just the extension addition group containing _field3_ and _field4_);
\- a traditional _nonCriticalExtension_ is not regarded as a level on its own.
E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, an error regarding the
conditionality of _field3_ would result in the entire _BroadcastInfoBlock1_ to
be ignored (rather than just the non-critical extension containing _field3_
and _field4_).
## 10.5 Not comprehended field
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1> if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
2> treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent.
NOTE: This clause does not apply to the case of an extension to the value
range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in
clause 10.3.
# 11 Radio information related interactions between network nodes
## 11.1 General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network nodes.
These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another Radio
Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar characteristics
as the RRC messages that are transferred across the NR radio interface, i.e.
the same transfer syntax and protocol extension mechanisms apply.
## 11.2 Inter-node RRC messages
### 11.2.1 General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2-, Xn- or
the NG-interface, either to or from the gNB, i.e. a single \'logical channel\'
is used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information
could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

### 11.2.3 Mandatory information in inter-node RRC messages
For the _AS-Config_ transferred within the _HandoverPreparationInformation_ :
\- The source node shall include all fields necessary to reflect the current
AS configuration of the UE, except for the fields _sourceSCG-NR-Config_ ,
_sourceSCG-EUTRA-Config_ and _sourceRB-SN-Config_ , which can be omitted in
case the source MN did not receive the latest configuration from the source
SN. For _RRCReconfiguration_ included in the field _rrcReconfiguration_ ,
_ReconfigurationWithSync_ is included with only the mandatory subfields (e.g.
_newUE-Identity_ and _t304_) and _ServingCellConfigCommon_ ;
\- Need codes or conditions specified for subfields according to IEs defined
in clause 6 do not apply. I.e. some fields shall be included regardless of the
\"Need\" or \"Cond\" e.g. _discardTimer_ ;
\- Based on the received AS configuration, the target node can indicate the
delta (difference) to the current AS configuration (as included in
_HandoverCommand_)to the UE. The fields _newUE-Identity_ and _t304_ included
in _ReconfigurationWithSync_ are not used for delta configuration purpose.
The _candidateCellInfoListSN_(-_EUTRA_) in _CG-Config_ and the
_candidateCellInfoListMN_(_-EUTRA_)/_candidateCellInfoListSN_(-_EUTRA_) in
_CG-ConfigInfo_ need not be included in procedures that do not involve a
change of node.
For fields _scg-CellGroupConfig, scg-CellGroupConfigEUTRA and scg-RB-Config_
in _CG-Config (sent upon SN initiated SN change or_ other conditions as
specified in field descriptions _)_ and fields _mcg-RB-Config_ , _scg-RB-
Config_ and _sourceConfigSCG_ in _CG-ConfigInfo_ (_sent_ upon change of SN):
\- The source node shall include all fields necessary to reflect the current
AS configuration of the UE, unless stated otherwise in the field description.
For _RRCReconfiguration_ included in the field _scg-CellGroupConfig in CG-
Config_ , _ReconfigurationWithSync_ is included with only the mandatory
subfields (e.g. _newUE-Identity_ and _t304_) and _ServingCellConfigCommon_ ;
\- Need codes or conditions specified for subfields according to IEs defined
in clause 6 do not apply;
\- Based on the received AS configuration, the target node can indicate the
delta (difference) as compared to the current AS configuration to the UE. The
fields _newUE-Identity_ and _t304_ in _ReconfigurationWithSync_ are always
included by the target node, i.e. they are not used for delta configuration
purpose to UE.
For fields in _CG-Config_ and _CG-ConfigInfo_ listed below, absence of the
field means that the receiver maintains the values informed via the previous
message. Note that every time there is a change in the configuration covered
by a listed field, the MN or SN shall include the field and it shall provide
the full configuration provided by that field unless stated otherwise.
Otherwise, if there is no change, the field can be omitted:
\- _configRestrictInfo_ ;
\- _gapPurpose;_
\- _measGapConfig_ (for which delta signaling applies);
_\- measGapConfigFR2_ (for which delta signaling applies);
\- _measResultCellListSFTD_ ;
_\- measResultSFTD-EUTRA_ ;
\- _sftdFrequencyList-EUTRA_ ;
_\- sftdFrequencyList-NR;_
\- _ue-CapabilityInfo;_
_\- servFrequenciesMN-NR._
For other fields in CG-Config and CG-ConfigInfo, the sender shall always
signal the appropriate value even if same as indicated in the previous inter-
node message, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

# 12 Processing delay requirements for RRC procedures
The UE performance requirements for RRC procedures are specified in the
following tables. The performance requirement is expressed as the time in [ms]
from the end of reception of the network -> UE message on the UE physical
layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for
the UE -> network response message with no access delay other than the TTI-
alignment (e.g. excluding delays caused by scheduling, the random access
procedure or physical layer synchronisation). In case the RRC procedure
triggers BWP switching, the RRC procedure delay is the value defined in the
following table plus the BWP switching delay defined in TS 38.133 [14], clause
8.6.3.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1
# A.1 Introduction
The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol
data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
# A.2 Procedural specification
## A.2.1 General principles
The procedural specification provides an overall high level description
regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception
of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU
specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details
of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be
done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU clause e.g.
general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple
fields.
Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements
regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are sent to the
network i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
## A.2.2 More detailed aspects
The following more detailed conventions should be used:
\- Bullets:
\- Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the
procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are
part of the sentence starting with \'The UE shall:\'
\- All bullets, including the last one in a clause, should end with a semi-
colon i.e. an \';.
\- Conditions:
\- Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end
of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in \'if cond1,
or cond2.
# A.3 PDU specification
## A.3.1 General principles
### A.3.1.1 ASN.1 sections
The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract
syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [6], X.681 [7].
The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in the
specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1
code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins with the following:
\- a first text paragraph consisting entirely of an _ASN.1 start tag_ , which
consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string
\"ASN1START\" (in all upper case letters);
\- a second text paragraph consisting entirely of a _block start tag_ is
included, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the
text string \"TAG-NAME-START\" (in all upper case letters), where the \"NAME\"
refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters).
Similarly, each ASN.1 section ends with the following:
\- a first text paragraph consisting entirely of a _blockstop tag_ , which
consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string
\"TAG-NAME-STOP\" (in all upper-case letters), where the \"NAME\" refers to
the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters);
\- a second text paragraph consisting entirely of an _ASN.1 stop tag_ , which
consists of a double hyphen followed by a singlespace and the text
\"ASN1STOP\" (in all upper case letters).
This results in the following tags:
\-- ASN1START
\-- TAG-NAME-START
\-- TAG-NAME-STOP
\-- ASN1STOP
The text paragraphs containing either of the start and stop tags should not
contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU
contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text
paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the
order they appear, throughout the specification.
NOTE: A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists
of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the
entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed
by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the
occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.
### A.3.1.2 ASN.1 identifier naming conventions
The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should
be based on the following guidelines:
\- Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without
hyphenation. These identifiers, _e.g._ , the
_RRCConnectionModificationCommand_ , should be used for reference in the
procedure text. Abbreviations should be avoided in these identifiers and
abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.
\- Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case,
with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a
capital, _e.g._ , _EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since
the \"d\" in \"Selected\" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-
TimeDifference_.
\- Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case
thereafter, _e.g._ , _establishmentCause_. If a field identifier begins with
an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is
lowercase (_plmn-Identity_ , not _pLMN-Identity_). The acronym is set off with
a hyphen (_ue-Identity_ , not _ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a
consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers_.
\- Identifiers should convey the meaning of the identifier and should avoid
adding unnecessary postfixes (e.g. abstractions like \'Info\') for the name.
\- Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially
widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent
possible.
\- Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should
be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which
should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use \'Meas\' instead of
\'Measurement\' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are
given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.
\- _For future extension:_ When an extension is introduced a suffix is added
to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/or type. A suffix of the
form \"‑rX\" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types
introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/first
release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a
revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, _e.g._
, _Foo-r9_ for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type _Foo_. A suffix of the form
\"‑rXb\" is used for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same
release (X) as the original version of the field, \"‑rXc\" for a second intra-
release revision and so on. A suffix of the form \"‑vXYZ\" is used for ASN.1
fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding earlier field or
type (see clause A.4), e.g., _AnElement-v10b0_ for the extension of the ASN.1
type _AnElement_ introduced in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number
_0...9, 10, 11, etc._ is used to represent the first part of the version
number, indicating the release of the protocol. Lower case letters _a, b, c,
etc._ are used to represent the second (and third) part of the version number
if they are greater than 9\. In the procedural specification, in field
descriptions as well as in headings suffices are not used, unless there is a
clear need to distinguish the extension from the original field.
\- More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants
of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the
identifiers e.g. _MeasObjectUTRA_ , _ConfigCommon_. When there is no
particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included
in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be
attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the
different variants.
\- It should be avoided to use field identifiers with the same name within the
elements of a CHOICE, including using a CHOICE inside a SEQUENCE (to avoid
certain compiler errors).
Table A.3.1.2-1: Examples of typical abbreviations used in ASN.1 identifiers
Abbreviation Abbreviated word
* * *
Config Configuration DL Downlink Ext Extension Freq Frequency Id Identity Ind
Indication Meas Measurement MIB MasterInformationBlock Neigh Neighbour(ing)
Param(s) Parameter(s) Phys Physical PCI Physical Cell Id Proc Process Reconfig
Reconfiguration Reest Re-establishment Req Request Rx Reception Sched
Scheduling SIB SystemInformationBlock Sync Synchronisation Thr Threshold Tx
Transmission UL Uplink
NOTE: The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be
used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.
### A.3.1.3 Text references using ASN.1 identifiers
A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the
specification is made using the ASN.1 field identifier of the referenced type.
The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text references should be in the
_italic font style_. The \"do not check spelling and grammar\" attribute in
Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., \"\") should not be used around the
ASN.1 field or type identifier.
A reference to an RRC PDU should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field
identifier followed by the word \"message\", e.g., a reference to the
_RRCRelease_ message.
A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any
other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field
identifier followed by the word \"field\", e.g., a reference to the
_prioritisedBitRate_ field in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {
priority Priority,
prioritisedBitRate PrioritisedBitRate,
bucketSizeDuration BucketSizeDuration,
logicalChannelGroup INTEGER (0..3)
} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
NOTE: All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 sections, used as examples in this
annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to
include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted
from the specification.
A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym \"IE\", e.g., a
reference to the IE _LogicalChannelConfig_ in the example above.
References to a specific type of information element should only be used when
those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the
specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a
particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information
element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be
used in the text reference.
A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the ASN.1
value, e.g., \'if the _status_ field is set to value _true_ \'.
## A.3.2 High-level message structure
Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types are
alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
message DL-DCCH-MessageType
}
DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE {
dlInformationTransfer DLInformationTransfer,
handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
mobilityFromEUTRACommand MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
rrcConnectionReconfiguration RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
rrcConnectionRelease RRCConnectionRelease,
securityModeCommand SecurityModeCommand,
ueCapabilityEnquiry UECapabilityEnquiry,
spare1 NULL
},
messageClassExtension SEQUENCE {}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU types
are alternatives within the inner level _c1_ CHOICE.
Spare alternatives (i.e., _spare1_ in this case) may be included within the
_c1_ CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare
alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an
integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).
Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated using
the _messageClassExtension_ alternative in the outer level CHOICE.
## A.3.3 Message definition
Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one
shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8 RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Enter the IEs here.
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Hooks for _critical_ and _non-critical_ extension should normally be included
in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further described
in clause A.4.
Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents
and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between
the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented
from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not
comprehended by the decoder.
Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE
structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the
inner level _c1_ CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., _spare3_ down to _spare1_
in this case) may be included within the _c1_ CHOICE. The number of spare
alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be
decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the
future releases of the protocol.
Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original
specifications are used up, is facilitated using the
_criticalExtensionsFuture_ in the outer level CHOICE.
In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases
of the protocol, the inner level _c1_ CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be
excluded, as shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Enter the fields here.
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information
to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-
critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still
able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.
Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or
other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are
facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker \"...\". The original
specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at
the end of the sequence of information elements contained.
Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field
that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING may be facilitated by use of an
empty sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2,
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a
_field description_ table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic
properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is
shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case
there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g.
because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for
each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that
needs to be specified.
+-------------------------------------------+ | _%PDU-TypeIdentifier%_ field descriptions | +===========================================+ | **_%field identifier%_** | | | | Field description. | +-------------------------------------------+ | **_%field identifier%_** | | | | Field description. | +-------------------------------------------+
The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the
ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.
The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall
include a first paragraph with a _field identifier_ (in **_bold and italic_**
font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The
following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style),
e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/or
specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of
the PDU.
The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be
omitted from the field description table.
## A.3.4 Information elements
Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to
the one shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PRACH-ConfigSIB ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo
}
PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL -- Need N
}
PRACH-ConfigInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
prach-ConfigIndex ENUMERATED {ffs},
highSpeedFlag ENUMERATED {ffs},
zeroCorrelationZoneConfig ENUMERATED {ffs}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the same
set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break
down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.
A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs _PRACH-ConfigSIB_
and _PRACH-Config_ in this example, are preferably placed together in a common
ASN.1 section. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base,
defined as the _generic type identifier_. It may be complemented by a suffix
to distinguish the different variants. The \"_PRACH-Config_ \" is the generic
type identifier in this example, and the \"_SIB_ \" suffix is added to
distinguish the variant. The clause heading and generic references to a group
of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type
identifier.
The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of
an existing IE is created for _critical_ or _non-critical_ extension of the
protocol (see clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of the
IE is included in the same ASN.1 section defining the original. A suffix is
added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in clause
A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new version, or
extension version, was introduced.
Local IE type definitions, like the IE _PRACH-ConfigInfo_ in the example
above, may be included in the ASN.1 section and be referenced in the other IE
types defined in the same ASN.1 section. The use of locally defined IE types
should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type
definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a
benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these
IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data
elements, to be used in the software implementation.
An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE _PRACH-ConfigInfo_ , should
not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 sections in the RRC specification.
An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 section should be
defined in a separate clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1
section (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs
_PRACH-ConfigSIB_ and _PRACH-Config_ in the example above). Such IE types are
also referred to as \'global IEs\'.
NOTE: Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the
context of another ASN.1 section, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation
error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE
type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline
level of the specification. It should be avoided.
The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the
example above, may be followed by a _field description_ table, where a further
description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information
elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in
clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of the
_field description_ table is the same as shown in clause A.3.3 for the
specification of the PDU type.
## A.3.5 Fields with optional presence
A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It
identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a
value for that field in the encoding:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PreambleInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
numberOfRA-Preambles INTEGER (1..64) DEFAULT 1,
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword
OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted. The omission
carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of the field:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL -- Need N
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted,
should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword
OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need code. The need code includes
the keyword \"Need\", followed by one of the predefined semantics tags (S, M,
N or R) defined in clause 6.1. If the semantics tag S is used, the semantics
of the absent field are further specified either in the field description
table following the ASN.1 section, or in procedure text.
The addition of OPTIONAL keywords for capability groups is based on the
following guideline. If there is more than one field in the lower level IE,
then OPTIONAL keyword is added at the group level. If there is only one field
in the lower level IE, OPTIONAL keyword is not added at the group level.
## A.3.6 Fields with conditional presence
A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In
addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the paragraph
including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the keyword
\"Cond\", followed by a condition tag associated with the field (\"UL\" in
this example):
\-- /example/ ASN1START
LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {
priority INTEGER (0),
...
} OPTIONAL -- Cond UL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 section, the field
description table after the ASN.1 section shall be followed by a _conditional
presence_ table. The conditional presence table specifies the conditions for
including the fields with conditional presence in the particular ASN.1
section.
Conditional presence Explanation
* * *
UL Specification of the conditions for including the field associated with the
condition tag = \"UL\". Semantics in case of optional presence under certain
conditions may also be specified.
The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading:
\"Conditional presence\") contains the condition tag (in _italic_ font style),
which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 section to an entry
in the table. The second column (heading: \"Explanation\") contains a text
specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of the
field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an optional
presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined
tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.
Conditional presence should primarily be used when presence of a field depends
on the presence and/or value of other fields within the same message. If the
presence of a field depends on whether another feature/function has been
configured, while this function can be configured independently e.g. by
another message and/or at another point in time, the relation is best
reflected by means of a statement in the field description table.
If the ASN.1 section does not include any fields with conditional presence,
the conditional presence table shall not be included.
Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of
conditional presence should be considered.
## A.3.7 Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF construct
in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE data type, an
information element shall be defined for the list elements even if it would
not otherwise be needed.
For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as in
the following example:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityInfo
PLMN-IdentityInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,
cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated code
to contain types with unpredictable names:
\-- /bad example/ ASN1START
PLMN-IdentityList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {
plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,
cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
## A.3.8 Guidelines on use of parameterised SetupRelease type
The usage of the parameterised _SetupRelease_ type is like a function call in
programming languages where the element type parameter is passed as a
parameter. The parameterised type only implies a textual change in abstract
syntax where all references to the parameterised type are replaced by the
compiler with the release/setup choice. Two examples of the usage are shown
below:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field-rX SetupRelease { IE-rX } OPTIONAL, -- Need M
...
}
RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field-rX SetupRelease { Element-rX }
} OPTIONAL, -- Need M
Element-rX ::= SEQUENCE {
field1-rX IE1-rX,
field2-rX IE2-rX OPTIONAL -- Need N
} OPTIONAL, -- Need M
\-- /example/ ASN1STOP
The _SetupRelease_ is always be used with only named IEs, i.e. the example
below is not allowed:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field-rX SetupRelease { SEQUENCE { -- Unnamed SEQUENCEs are not allowed!
field1-rX IE1-rX,
field2-rX IE2-rX OPTIONAL -- Need N
}
} OPTIONAL, -- Need M
}
\-- /example/ ASN1STOP
If a field defined using the parameterized SetupRelease type requires
procedural text, the field is referred to using the values defined for the
type itself, namely, \"setup\" and \"release\". For example, procedural text
for field-rX above could be as follows:
1> if _field-rX_ is set to \"setup\":
2> do something;
1> else (_field-rX_ is set to \"release\"):
2> release _field-rX_ (if appropriate).
## A.3.9 Guidelines on use of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList
In order to benefit from delta signalling when modifying lists with many
and/or large elements, so-called add/mod- and release- lists should be used.
Instead of a single list containing all elements of the list, the ASN.1
provides two lists. One list is used to convey the actual elements that are to
be added to the list or modified in the list. The second list conveys only the
identities (IDs) of the list elements that are to be released from the list.
In other words, the ASN.1 defines only means to signal modifications to a list
maintained in the receiver (typically the UE). An example is provided below:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
AnExampleIE ::= SEQUENCE {
elementsToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element OPTIONAL,
-- Need N
elementsToReleaseList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF ElementId
OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...
}
Element ::= SEQUENCE {
elementId ElementId,
aField INTEG ER (0..16777215),
anotherField OCTET STRING,
...
}
ElementId ::= INTEGER (0..maxNrofElements-1)
maxNrofElements INTEGER ::= 50
maxNrofElements-1 INTEGER ::= 49
\-- /example/ ASN1STOP
As can be seen, the elements of the list must contain an identity (INTEGER)
that identifies the elements unambiguously upon addition, modification and
removal. It is recommended to define an IE for that identifier (here
ElementId) so that it can be used both for a field inside the element as well
as in the _elementsToReleaseList_.
Both lists should be made OPTIONAL and flagged as \"Need N\". The need code
reflects that the UE does not maintain the received lists as such but rather
updates its configuration using the information therein. In other words, it is
not possible to provide via delta signalling an update to a previously
signalled _elementsToAddModList_ or elementsToReleaseList (which Need M would
imply). The update is always in relation to the UE\'s internal configuration.
Note that the release of a field (a list element as well as any other field)
releases all its sub-fields (sub-fields configured by elementsToAddModList and
any other sub-field).
If no procedural text is provided for a set of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList,
the following generic procedure applies:
The UE shall:
1> for each _ElementId_ in the _elementsToReleaseList_ ,:
2> if the current UE configuration includes an _Element_ with the given
_ElementId_ :
3> release the _Element_ from the current UE configuration;
1> for each _Element_ in the _elementsToAddModList_ :
2> if the current UE configuration includes an _Element_ with the given
_ElementId_ :
3> modify the configured _Element_ in accordance with the received _Element_ ;
2> else:
3> add received _Element_ to the UE configuration.
## A.3.10 Guidelines on use of lists (without ToAddModList and ToReleaseList)
As per clause 6.1.3, when using lists without the ToAddModList and
ToReleaseList structure, the contents of the lists are always replaced. To
illustrate this, an example is provided below:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
\-- TAG_EXAMPLE_LISTS_START
AnExampleIE ::= SEQUENCE {
elementList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element OPTIONAL, \-- Need
M
...,
[[
elementListExt-v2030 SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElementsExt)) OF Element
OPTIONAL, -- Need M
]]
}
Element ::= SEQUENCE {
useFeatureX BOOLEAN,
aField INTEGER (0..127) OPTIONAL, -- Need M
anotherField INTEGER (0..127) OPTIONAL, -- Need R
...
}
maxNrofElements INTEGER ::= 8
maxNrofElements-1 INTEGER ::= 7
maxNrofElementsExt INTEGER ::= 8
maxNrofElementsExt-1 INTEGER ::= 7
\-- TAG_EXAMPLE_LISTS_STOP
\-- /example/ ASN1STOP
As can be seen, the _elementList_ list itself uses Need M, but each list entry
_Element_ contains mandatory, Need M and Need R fields. If the list is first
signalled to UE with 3 entries, and subsequently again with 2 entries, UE
shall retain only the latter list, i.e. the list with 2 elements will
completely replace the list with 3 elements. That also means that the field
_aField_ will be treated as if it was newly created, i.e. network must include
it if it wishes UE to utilize the field even if it was previously signalled.
This also implies that the Need M field (_aField_) will be treated in the same
way as the Need R field (_anotherField_), i.e. delta signalling is not applied
and the network has to signal the field to ensure UE does not release the
value (which is why Need M should not normally be used in the entries of these
lists).
# A.4 Extension of the PDU specifications
## A.4.1 General principles to ensure compatibility
It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect
interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on different
versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In particular, this
requirement applies for the following kind of protocol extensions:
\- Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected
behaviour or damage).
\- Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it should be
possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the handling of
the other parts of the message).
\- Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If used,
the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.
It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical
channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may
be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring
of extensions may not be required.
The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for introducing
protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is used merely when
there is a need to introduce a \'clean\' message version. Such a need appears
when the last message version includes a large number of non-critical
extensions, which results in issues like readability, overhead associated with
the extension markers. The critical extension mechanism may also be considered
when it is complicated to accommodate the extensions by means of non-critical
extension mechanisms.
## A.4.2 Critical extension of messages and fields
The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There are
both \"outer branch\" and \"inner branch\" mechanisms available. The \"outer
branch\" consists of a CHOICE having the name _criticalExtensions_ , with two
values, _c1_ and _criticalExtensionsFuture_. The _criticalExtensionsFuture_
branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the \"inner
branch\" mechanism.
The \"inner branch\" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form
\"_MessageName-rX-IEs_ \" (e.g., \"_RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs_ \")
or \"_spareX_ \", with the spare values having type NULL. The \"-rX-IEs\"
structures contain the _complete_ structure of the message IEs for the
appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10
version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not
obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional
Rel-10 fields.
The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to
introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an \'outer branch\', or an
\'outer branch\' in combination with an \'inner branch\' including a certain
number of spares:
\- For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on
a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.
\- An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.
\- The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that
the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release
with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values).
The estimation of the critical extension likelihood may be based on the
number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.
\- In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all
spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions
are added using the outer branch.
The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism
by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Original release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcMessage-r8 RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Later release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcMessage-r8 RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
rrcMessage-r10 RRCMessage-r10-IEs,
rrcMessage-r11 RRCMessage-r11-IEs,
rrcMessage-r14 RRCMessage-r14-IEs
},
later CHOICE {
c2 CHOICE{
rrcMessage-r16 RRCMessage-r16-IEs,
spare7 NULL, spare6 NULL, spare5 NULL, spare4 NULL,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
It is important to note that critical extensions may also be used at the level
of individual fields i.e. a field may be replaced by a critically extended
version. When sending the extended version, the original version may also be
included (e.g. original field is mandatory, E-UTRAN is unaware if UE supports
the extended version). In such cases, a UE supporting both versions may be
required to ignore the original field. The following example illustrates the
use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original
and of a later release.
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Original release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcMessage-r8 RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCMessage-rN-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1-rN ENUMERATED {
value1, value2, value3, value4} OPTIONAL, -- Need N
field2-rN InformationElement2-rN OPTIONAL, -- Need N
nonCriticalExtension RRCConnectionReconfiguration-vMxy-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCConnectionReconfiguration-vMxy-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field2-rM InformationElement2-rM OPTIONAL, -- Cond NoField2rN
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Conditional presence Explanation
* * *
_NoField2rN_ The field is optionally present, need N, if field2-rN is absent.
Otherwise the field is absent
Finally, it is noted that a critical extension may be introduced in the same
release as the one in which the original field was introduced e.g. to correct
an essential ASN.1 error. In such cases a UE capability may be introduced, to
assist the network in deciding whether or not to use the critical extension.
In the case of list fields (SEQUENCE OF types in ASN.1) using the
ToAddMod/ToRelease construction, the use of critical extensions to increase
the size of a list should be avoided; that is, replacing the original list
field by a new field also used to signal entries previously covered by the
original field (i.e. extensions done according to the following example)
should be avoided:
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Discouraged example
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {
listElementToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...,
[[
listElementToAddModList-rN SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements-rN)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}-- ASN1STOP
Instead, a non-critical list extension mechanism should typically be used,
such that the extension field only adds the new entries of the list. This
approach is further described in clause A.4.3.6.
If the critical extension mechanism for a list is used, it should be clarified
in the field description that the two versions of the list are not configured
together, and that the network should release the contents of the original
version when configuring the replacement version.
## A.4.3 Non-critical extension of messages
### A.4.3.1 General principles
The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in
A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional
guidelines apply:
\- When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has been
critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in earlier
critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.
\- The extension marker (\"...\") is the primary non-critical extension
mechanism that is used but empty sequences may be used if length determinant
is not required. Examples of cases where a length determinant is not required:
\- at the end of a message;
\- at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
\- When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are
preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned parameter
belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as the \'_default
extension location_ \').
\- It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version of
the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest possible
level.
\- In specific cases it may be preferable to place extensions elsewhere
(referred to as the \'_actual extension location_ \') e.g. when it is possible
to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group should
be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message.
\- In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier
critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following higher
level in the message should be considered.
\- In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an IE
should be defined. The IE\'s ASN.1 definition should be placed in the same
ASN.1 section as the default extension location. In case there are
intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension location,
an IE may be defined for each level. Intermediate levels are primarily
introduced for readability and overview. Hence intermediate levels need not
always be introduced e.g. they may not be needed when the default and the
actual extension location are within the same ASN.1 section.
### A.4.3.2 Further guidelines
Further to the general principles defined in the previous section, the
following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension markers:
\- Extension markers within SEQUENCE:
\- Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the
higher nesting levels.
\- Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields
as well as for information elements whose extension would result in complex
structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list).
\- Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important
information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT.
\- Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages
on BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully.
\- The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the
specification are grouped together using double brackets.
\- Extension markers within ENUMERATED:
\- Spare values may be used until the number of values reaches the next power
of 2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit, given
that the use of spare values in a later Release is possible without any error
cases.
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new value,
e.g. \"value-vXYZ\".
\- Extension markers within CHOICE:
\- Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when
comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for
the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g.
ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the
behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is not
required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports the
extended value.
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new choice
value, e.g. \"choice-vXYZ\".
Non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an
OCTET or BIT STRING:
\- When a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a \"Need\" code should not be
provided for the field, which always is a group including at least one
extension and a field facilitating further possible extensions. For
simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a \"Need\" code when the field is
not actually used either.
Further, more general, guidelines:
\- In case a need code is not provided for a group, a \"Need\" code is
provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e. including
for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to clarify the
action upon absence of the whole group.
### A.4.3.3 Typical example of evolution of IE with local extensions
The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a number
of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also
illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension mechanism
is used.
NOTE In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n while
the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the release n
receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more advanced
mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.
\-- /example/ ASN1START

Some remarks regarding the extensions of _InformationElement1_ as shown in the
above example:
\-- The _InformationElement1_ is initially extended with a number of non-
critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced
for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of the IE
_InformationElement1_ (i.e. _InformationElement1-r10_) is defined in which the
earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the
original field.
\-- The _value4-v880_ is replacing a spare value defined in the original
protocol version for _field1_. Likewise _value6-v1170_ replaces _spare3_ that
was originally defined in the r10 version of _field1._
\-- Within the critically extended release 10 version of _InformationElement1_
, the names of the original fields/IEs are not changed, unless there is a real
need to distinguish them from other fields/IEs. E.g. the _field1_ and
_InformationElement4_ were defined in the original protocol version (release
8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the _field3-r9_ is introduced in release 9
and not re-tagged; although, the _InformationElement3_ is also critically
extended and therefore tagged _InformationElement3-r10_ in the release 10
version of InformationElement1.
### A.4.3.4 Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a message
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the
end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or
OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2,
field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v860-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v860-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field4-v860 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need S
field5-v860 BOOLEAN OPTIONAL, -- Cond C54
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v940-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v940-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field6-v940 InformationElement6-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Need R
nonCriticalExtensions SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
\-- The _InformationElement4_ is introduced in the original version of the
protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.
### A.4.3.5 Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default
extension location
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case
an extension is not placed at the default extension location.
#### \-- _ParentIE-WithEM_
The IE _ParentIE-WithEM_ is an example of a high level IE including the
extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level
IEs _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ and _ChildIE2-WithoutEM_ which not include the
extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have
to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.
The example illustrates how the two extension IEs _ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0_
and _ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0_ (both in release N) are used to connect non-
critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs
to the actual extension location in this IE.
**_ParentIE-WithEM_** information element
\-- /example/ ASN1START
ParentIE-WithEM ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Root encoding, including:
childIE1-WithoutEM ChildIE1-WithoutEM OPTIONAL, -- Need N
childIE2-WithoutEM ChildIE2-WithoutEM OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...,
[[
childIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
childIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
\-- The fields _childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0_ may not really need to be optional
(depends on what is defined at the next lower level).
\-- In general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields
should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.
#### _\-- ChildIE1-WithoutEM_
The IE _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ is an example of a lower level IE, used to control
certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be
setup or released using the local IE _ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature_. The example
illustrates how the new field _chIE1-NewField_ is added in release N to the
configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the
following assumptions:
\-- When initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the
original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as
if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.
\-- When the configurable feature is released, the new field should be
released also.
\-- When omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE
continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling
for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).
\-- When omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases
the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may
be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an
eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).
The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may
not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.
**_ChildIE1-WithoutEM_** information element
\-- /example/ ASN1START
ChildIE1-WithoutEM ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Root encoding, including:
chIE1-ConfigurableFeature ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature OPTIONAL -- Need N

ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature-vNx0 ::= SEQUENCE {

Conditional presence Explanation
* * *
_ConfigF_ The field is optional present, need R, in case of
chIE1-ConfigurableFeature is included and set to \"setup\"; otherwise the
field is absent and the UE shall delete any existing value for this field.
#### _\-- ChildIE2-WithoutEM_
The IE _ChildIE2-WithoutEM_ is an example of a lower level IE, typically used
to control certain radio configurations. The example illustrates how the new
field _chIE1-NewField_ is added in release N to the configuration of the
configurable feature.
**_ChildIE2-WithoutEM_** information element
\-- /example/ ASN1START
ChildIE2-WithoutEM ::= CHOICE {
release NULL,

\-- Root encoding

ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 ::= SEQUENCE {
chIE2-NewField-rN INTEGER (0..31) OPTIONAL -- Cond ConfigF

_ConfigF_ The field is optional present, need R, in case of
chIE2-ConfigurableFeature is included and set to \"setup\"; otherwise the
field is absent and the UE shall delete any existing value for this field.
A.4.3.6 Non-critical extensions of lists with ToAddMod/ToRelease
When the size of a list using the ToAddMod/ToRelease construction is extended
and/or fields are added to the list element structure, the list should be non-
critically extended in accordance with the following general principles:
\-- When only the size of the list is extended, this extension is reflected in
a non-critical extension of the list, with a \"SizeExt\" suffix added to the
end of the field name (before the -vNxy suffix). The differential size of the
extended list uses the suffix \"Diff\". A new ToRelease list is needed, and
its range should include only the increase in list size. In many cases,
extending the list size will also require an extended list element ID type to
account for the increased size of the list; in these cases the element type
will need to be extended to include the extended element ID, resulting in a
more complex extension (see example 3 for further discussion of this case).
The field description table should indicate that the UE considers the original
list and the extension list as a single list; thus entries added with the
original list can be modified by the extension list (or removed by the
extension of the ToRelease list), or vice versa. The result is as shown in the
following example:
\-- /example 1/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {
listElementToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N
listElementToReleaseList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElementId OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...,
[[
\-- Non-critical extension lists
listElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE
(1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N
listElementToReleaseListSizeExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE
(1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElementId OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}
\-- ASN1STOP
\-- When fields are added to the list element structure, an extension marker
should normally be used if available. If no extension marker is available or
if overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an
extension structure should be created for the new fields, with the suffix
\"Ext\" added to the end of the field name and the element structure type name
(before the -vNxy suffix), and a parallel ToAddMod list introduced to hold the
new structures, also with the \"Ext\" suffix. The field description table
should indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries,
and in the same order, as the original list. No new ToRelease list is
typically needed (unless the list element ID type changes). It should
typically be ensured that the contained fields in the \"Ext\" elements are
releasable without release and add of the entire list element; this can, for
instance, be ensured by having the new fields be OPTIONAL Need R. If multiple
extensions of the same list are needed, the version suffix should distinguish
the lists (e.g. _listElementToAddModListExt-vNwz_ added after
_listElementToAddModListExt-vNxy_). The result is as shown in the following
example:
\-- /example 2/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {
listElementToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N
listElementToReleaseList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElementId OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...,
[[
\-- Parallel list
listElementToAddModListExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElementExt-vNxy OPTIONAL -- Need N
]],
[[
\-- Second parallel list from a later spec version
listElementToAddModListExt-vNwz SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElementExt-vNwz OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}
ListElement ::= SEQUENCE {
elementId ListElementId,
field1 INTEGER (0..3),
field2 ENUMERATED { value1, value2, value3 }
}
ListElementExt-vNxy ::= SEQUENCE {
field3-rN BIT STRING (SIZE (8)) OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
ListElementExt-vNwz ::= SEQUENCE {
field4-rN INTEGER (0..255) OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
\-- ASN1STOP
\-- When the size of a list is extended and fields are added to the list
element structure, an extension marker should normally be used for the added
fields if available, and the list extended with the non-critical mechanism as
described in example 1 above _._ Note that if the list element ID type changes
in this case, the new ID can be added after the extension marker, and the
entries of the size-extended ToRelease list should have the type of the new ID
(e.g. _ListElementId-vNxy_). If no extension marker is available or if
overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an
extension structure should be created for the new fields and a parallel list
with ToAddMod introduced to hold the extension structures, as in the second
example above, for entries of the original list and for entries of the
extension list holding new entries. The field description table should
indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries, and in
the same order, as the concatenation of the original list and the extension
list. An extended ToRelease list is needed, but no additional parallel
ToRelease list is needed (i.e. there is no _listElementToReleaseListExt-vNxy_
in the example below), as the original and extended ToRelease lists suffice to
release any element of the combined list. The extended element ID type should
be captured as a non-critical extension of the original element ID type, with
the field description indicating that if the extended ID is present, the
original ID is ignored. The result is as shown in the following example:
\-- /example 3/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {
listElementToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N
listElementToReleaseList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF

...,
[[

\-- Parallel list with maxNrofListElements-rN = maxNrofListElements +
maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN
listElementToAddModListExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements-rN)) OF
ListElementExt-vNxy OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}
ListElement ::= SEQUENCE {
elementId ListElementId,
field1 INTEGER (0..3),
field2 ENUMERATED { value1, value2, value3 }
}
ListElementExt-vNxy ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Field description should indicate that if the elementId-vNxy is present,
the elementId (without suffix) is ignored
elementId-vNxy ListElementId-vNxy OPTIONAL, -- Need S
field3-rN BIT STRING (SIZE (8)) OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
ListElementId ::= INTEGER (0..maxNrofListElements-1)
ListElementId-vNxy ::= INTEGER (maxNrofListElements..maxNrofListElements-1-rN)
\-- ASN1STOP
\-- When different extensions are made to a list in separate releases, the
extension mechanisms described above may interact. In case fields are added in
Rel-M (_listElementToAddModListExt-vMxy_) and later the list size is extended
in Rel-N (_listElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNwz_), the size-extended list in
Rel-N should be a single list extending the combination of
_listElementToAddModList_ and _listElementToAddModListExt-vMxy_. This requires
creating a new type (_ListElement-rN_) to contain the combined fields of
_ListElement_ and _ListElementExt-vMxy_. A corresponding ToRelease list is
needed. The result is as shown in the following example:
\-- /example 4/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {
listElementToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N

# A.5 Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC
messages
The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a
Transaction identifier
1: DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-Idle should not include the RRC
transaction identifier.
2: All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC
transaction identifier.
3: All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC
Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4: All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an
RRC transaction identifier.
5: All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a
corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction
identifier.
# A.6 Guidelines regarding use of need codes
The following rule provides guidance for determining need codes for optional
downlink fields:
\- if the field needs to be stored by the UE (i.e. maintained) when absent:
\- use Need M (=Maintain);
\- else, if the field needs to be released by the UE when absent:
\- use Need R (=Release);
\- else, if UE shall take no action when the field is absent (i.e. UE does not
even need to maintain any existing value of the field):
\- use Need N (=None);
\- else (UE behaviour upon absence does not fit any of the above conditions):
\- use Need S (=Specified);
\- specify the UE behaviour upon absence of the field in the procedural text
or in the field description table.
# A.7 Guidelines regarding use of conditions
Conditions are primarily used to specify network restrictions, for which the
following types can be distinguished:
\- Message Contents related constraints e.g. that a field B is mandatory
present if the same message includes field A and when it is set value X.
\- Configuration Constraints e.g. that a field D can only be signalled if
field C is configured and set to value Y. (i.e. regardless of whether field C
is present in the same message or previously configured).
The use of these conditions is illustrated by an example.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
fieldA FieldA OPTIONAL, -- Need M
fieldB FieldB OPTIONAL, -- Cond FieldAsetToX
fieldC FieldC OPTIONAL, -- Need M
fieldD FieldD OPTIONAL, -- Cond FieldCsetToY
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- /example/ ASN1STOP
_Conditional presence_ _Explanation_
* * *
_FieldAsetToX_ The field is mandatory present if fieldA is included and set to
valueX. Otherwise the field is optionally present, need R. _FieldCsetToY_ The
field is optionally present, need M, if fieldC is configured and set to
valueY. Otherwise the field is absent and the UE does not maintain the value
# A.8 Miscellaneous
The following miscellaneous convention should be used:
\- UE capabilities: TS 38.306 [26] specifies that the network should in
general respect the UE\'s capabilities. Hence there is no need to include
statement clarifying that the network, when setting the value of a certain
configuration field, shall respect the related UE capabilities unless there is
a particular need e.g. particularly complicated cases.

1) Configure _BWP-DownlinkCommon_ and _BWP-UplinkCommon_ in
_ServingCellConfigCommon_ , but do not configure dedicated configurations in
_BWP-DownlinkDedicated_ or _BWP-UplinkDedicated_ in _ServingCellConfig_.
2) Configure both _BWP-DownlinkCommon_ and _BWP-UplinkCommon_ in
_ServingCellConfigCommon_ and configure dedicated configurations in at least
one of _BWP-DownlinkDedicated_ or _BWP-UplinkDedicated_ in
_ServingCellConfig_.
The same way of configuration is used for UL BWP#0 and DL BWP#0 if both are
configured.
With the first option (illustrated by figure B2-1 below), the BWP#0 is not
considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP can
still be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this
configuration. The BWP#0 can still be used even if it does not have the
dedicated configuration, albeit in a more limited manner since only the
SIB1-defined configurations are available. For example, only DCI format 1_0
can be used with BWP#0 without dedicated configuration, so changing to another
BWP requires RRCReconfiguration since DCI format 1_0 doesn\'t support DCI-
based switching.
Figure B2-1: BWP#0 configuration without dedicated configuration
With the second option (illustrated by figure B2-2 below), the BWP#0 is
considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP cannot
be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this configuration.
However, UE supporting more than one BWP can still switch to and from BWP#0
e.g. via DCI normally, and there are no explicit limitations to using the
BWP#0 (compared to the first option).
Figure B2-2: BWP#0 configuration with dedicated configuration
For BWP#0, the _BWP-DownlinkCommon_ and _BWP-UplinkCommon_ in
_ServingCellConfigCommon_ should match the parameters configured by MIB and
SIB1 (if provided) in the corresponding serving cell.
###### ## Annex C (normative): List of CRs Containing Early Implementable
Features and Corrections
This annex lists the Change Requests (CRs) whose changes may be implemented by
a UE of an earlier release than which the CR was approved in (i.e. CRs that
contain on their coversheets the sentence \"Implementation of this CR from
Rel-N will not cause interoperability issues\").

###### ## Annex D (normative): UE requirements on ASN.1 comprehension
This clause specifies UE requirements regarding the ASN.1 transfer syntax
support, i.e. the ASN.1 definitions to be comprehended by the UE.
A UE that indicates release X in field _accessStratumRelease_ shall comprehend
the entire transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X, in particular at least the
first version upon ASN.1 freeze. The UE is however not required to support
dedicated signalling related transfer syntax associated with optional features
it does not support.
In case a UE that indicates release X in field _accessStratumRelease_ supports
a feature specified in release Y, which is later than release X, (i.e. early
UE implementation) additional requirements apply. The UE obviously also has to
support the ASN.1 parts related to indicating support of the feature (in UE
capabilities).
**Critical extensions (dedicated signaling)**
If the early implemented feature involves one or more critical extensions in
dedicated signalling, the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax
(ASN.1) of release Y that are related to the feature implemented early. This,
in particular, concerns the ASN.1 parts related to configuration of the
feature.
If configuration of an early implemented feature introduced in release Y
involves a message or field that has been critically extended, the UE shall
support configuration of all features supported by the UE that are associated
with sub-fields of this critical extension. Apart from the early implemented
feature(s), the UE needs, however, not to support functionality beyond what is
defined in the release the UE indicates in access stratum release.
Let\'s consider the example of a UE indicating value X in field
_accessStratumRelease_ that supports the features A1, A3, and A5, associated
with fields _fieldA1_ , _fieldA3_ and _fieldA5_ of _InformationElementA_ (see
ASN.1 below).
The feature A5 implemented early is associated with _fieldA5_ , and can only
be configured by the --rY version of _InformationElementA_. In such case, the
UE should support configuration of all the features A1, A3 and A5 associated
with fields _fieldA1_ , _fieldA3_ and _fieldA5_ by the --rY version of
_InformationElementA_.
If, however, one of the features was modified, e.g. the feature A3 associated
with _fieldA3_ , the network should assume the UE only supports the feature A3
according to the release it indicated in field _accessStratumRelease_ (i.e.
X).
The UE is neither required to support the additional code-point (_n80-vY0_)
nor the additional sub-field (_fieldA3c-rY_).
InformationElementA-rX ::= SEQUENCE {
fieldA1-rX InformationElementA1-rX OPTIONAL, -- Need N
fieldA2-rX InformationElementA2-rX OPTIONAL, -- Need R
fieldA3-rX InformationElementA3-rX OPTIONAL -- Need R

fieldA5-rY InformationElementA5-rY OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
InformationElementA3-rX ::= SEQUENCE {

fieldA3b-rY ENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40, n80-vY0} OPTIONAL, -- Need R
fieldA3c-rY InformationElementA3c-rY OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
**Non-critical extensions (dedicated and broadcast signaling)**
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions,
the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release Y
that are related to the feature implemented early.
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions
in dedicated signaling, the network does not include extensions introduced
after the release X that are not the parts related to the feature which the UE
indicates early support of in UE capabilities. The UE shall anyway comprehend
the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) which indicate absence of such
extensions.
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions
in system information, the SIB(s) containing the release Y fields related to
the early implemented features may also include other extensions introduced
after the release X that are not the parts related to the feature which the UE
supports. The UE shall comprehend such intermediate fields (but again is not
required to support the functionality associated with these intermediate
fields, in case this concerns optional features not supported by the UE).
