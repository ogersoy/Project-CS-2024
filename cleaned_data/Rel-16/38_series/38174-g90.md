# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship with other core specifications
The present document is a single-RAT specification for an IAB-DU and IAB-MT,
covering RF characteristics and minimum performance requirements and RRM
requirements for the IAB-MT. Conducted and radiated core requirements are
defined for the IAB node architectures and IAB node types defined in subclause
4.3.
The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 4.6.
## 4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the
test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS 38.176-1 [25]
and TS 38.176-2 [26].
The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.176-1 [25] and TS
38.176-2 [26] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum
requirements in this specification to create test requirements. For some
requirements, including regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to
zero.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the test requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITU‑R M.1545 [18].
## 4.3 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
### 4.3.2 IAB type 1-H
For _IAB type 1-H_ , the requirements are defined for two points of reference,
signified by radiated requirements and conducted requirements.
Figure 4.3.2-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for _IAB type 1-H_
Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the _operating
band_ specific radiated interface is referred to as the _Radiated Interface
Boundary_ (RIB). Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA
requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements
apply are detailed for each requirement.
Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of _TAB
connectors_ at the _transceiver array boundary_ , which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.
The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver functionality
generating modulated transmit signal structures and performing receiver
combining and demodulation.
The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver units.
Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into transceiver units.
The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to transmit/receive parallel
independent modulated symbol streams.
The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the RF
power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array, and/or
distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to the
transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.
How a conducted requirement is applied to the _transceiver array boundary_ is
detailed in the respective requirement subclause.
### 4.3.3 IAB type 1-O and IAB type 2-O
For _IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type 2-O_ , the radiated characteristics are
defined over the air (OTA), where the _operating band_ specific radiated
interface is referred to as the _Radiated Interface Boundary_ (RIB). Radiated
requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial)
characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each
requirement.
Figure 4.3.3-1: Radiated reference points for _IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type
2-O_
For an _IAB-DU type 1-O_ the transceiver unit array must contain at least 8
transmitter units and at least 8 receiver units. Transmitter units and
receiver units may be combined into transceiver units. The
transmitter/receiver units have the ability to transmit/receive parallel
independent modulated symbol streams.
## 4.4 IAB classes
### 4.4.1 IAB-DU classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area IAB-DU, Medium Range
IAB-DU and Local Area IAB-DU unless otherwise stated. The associated
deployment scenarios for each class are exactly the same for IAB-DU with and
without connectors.
For IAB _type 1-O_ and 2-O, IAB-DU classes are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Macro Cell
scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to 35 m.
\- Medium Range IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Micro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to 5 m.
\- Local Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Pico Cell
scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to 2 m.
For _IAB type_ 1-H, IAB-DU classes are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Macro Cell
scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB.
\- Medium Range IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Micro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53 dB.
\- Local Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Pico Cell
scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB.
### 4.4.2 IAB-MT classes
_The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area IAB-MT and Local
Area IAB-MT classes unless otherwise stated._
_For IAB type 1-H, 1-O, and 2-O, IAB-MT classes are defined as indicated
below:_
\- Wide Area IAB-MT are characterised by requirements derived from Macro Cell
and/or Micro Cell scenarios.
\- Local Area IAB-MT are characterised by requirements derived from Pico Cell
and /or Micro Cell scenarios.
## 4.5 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements set by local and
regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances the regional requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.5-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may be
applied differently in different regions.

## 4.7 Applicability of RRM requirements in this specification
### 4.7.1 Applicability of signalling characteristics related RRM requirements
The RRM requirements on the signalling characteristics for IAB MTs specified
in section 12.3 shall apply only for the local area IAB class defined in
section 4.4.
4.7.2 Applicability of RRM requirements in non-DRX
All the RRM requirements for IAB MT specified in section 12 shall apply when
no DRX is used. The IAB-MT shall assume that no DRX is used provided the
following conditions are met:
\- DRX parameters are not configured or
\- DRX parameters are configured and
\- drx-InactivityTimer is running or
\- drx-RetransmissionTimerDL is running or
\- drx-RetransmissionTimerUL is running or
\- ra-ContentionResolutionTimer is running or
\- a Scheduling Request sent on PUCCH is pending or
\- a PDCCH indicating a new transmission addressed to the C-RNTI of the MAC
entity has not been received after successful reception of a Random Access
Response for the preamble not selected by the MAC entity
## 4.8 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
A spectrum allocation where an IAB-DU or IAB-MT operates can either be
contiguous or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the
present specification apply for IAB-DU and IAB-MT configured for both
_contiguous spectrum_ operation and _non-contiguous spectrum_ operation.
For IAB-DU or IAB-MT operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , some
requirements apply both at the _IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges_ or _IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth edges_ , and inside the _sub-block gaps_. For each such requirement,
it is stated how the limits apply relative to the _IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges_
and _IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges_ and the _sub-block_ edges respectively.
## 4.9 Requirements for IAB-DU and IAB-MT capable of multi-band operation
For _multi-band connector_ or _multi-band_ _RIB_ , the RF requirements in
clause 6, 7, 9 and 10 apply separately to each supported _operating band_
unless otherwise stated. For some requirements, it is explicitly stated that
specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at _multi-band
connector(s)_ , and _multi-band RIB(s)_ as detailed in the requirement clause.
For _IAB-DU or IAB-MT_ capable of multi-band operation, various structures in
terms of combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations
(multi-band or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more _TAB
connectors_ for _IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-H_ in different ways are possible.
For _multi-band connector(s)_ the exclusions or provisions for multi-band
apply. For _single-band connector(s)_ , the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, _operating band_ unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to this _connector_ that is mapped to single-band.
\- If the IAB-DU or IAB-MT is configured for single-band operation, single-
band requirements shall apply to this _connector_ configured for single-band
operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable _IAB-DU_ or
_IAB-MT_ are applicable. Single-band requirements are tested separately at the
_connector_ configured for single-band operation, with all other _antenna
connectors_ terminated.
A _IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-H_ may be capable of supporting operation in
multiple _operating bands_ with one of the following implementations of _TAB
connectors_ in the _transceiver array boundary_ :
\- All _TAB connectors_ are _single-band connectors_.
\- Different sets of _single-band connectors_ support different _operating
bands_ , but each _TAB connector_ supports only operation in one single
_operating band_.
\- Sets of _single-band connectors_ support operation in multiple _operating
bands_ with some _single-band connectors_ supporting more than one _operating
band_.
\- All _TAB connectors_ are multi-band _connectors_.
\- A combination of single-band sets and multi-band sets of _TAB connectors_
provides support of the type _IAB-DU type 1-H_ capability of operation in
multiple _operating bands_.
Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an _operating band_
apply only to the set of _TAB connectors_ supporting that _operating band_.
In the case of an _operating band_ being supported only by _single-band
connectors_ in a _TAB connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min
cell group_ , _single-band requirements_ apply to that set of _TAB
connectors_.
In the case of an _operating band_ being supported only by _multi-band
connector_ s supporting the same _operating band_ combination in a _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ , _multi-
band requirements_ apply to that set of _TAB connectors_.
The case of an _operating band_ being supported by both _multi-band
connectors_ and _single-band connectors_ in a _TAB connector TX min cell
group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ is not covered by the present
release of this specification.
The case of an _operating band_ being supported by _multi-band connectors_
which are not all supporting the same _operating band_ combination in a _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ is not
covered by the present release of this specification.
_IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-O_ may be capable of supporting operation in
multiple _operating bands_ with one of the following implementations at the
_radiated interface boundary_ :
\- All RIBs are _single-band RIBs_.
\- All RIBs are _multi-band_ _RIBs_.
\- A combination of single-band _RIBs_ and _multi-band RIBs_ provides support
of the _IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-O_ capability of operation in multiple
_operating bands_.
For _multi-band connectors_ and _multi-band RIBs_ supporting the bands for
TDD, the RF requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous
uplink and downlink occur between the bands.
## 4.10 OTA co-location with other base stations
Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming the
_IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-O_ is co-located with another BS or IAB of the same
base station class, they ensure that both co-located systems can operate with
minimal degradation to each other.
Unwanted emission and out of band blocking co-location requirements are
optional requirements based on declaration. TX OFF and TX IMD are mandatory
requirements and have the form of a co-location requirement as it represents
the worst-case scenario of all the interference cases.
NOTE: Due to the low level of the unwanted emissions for the spurious
emissions and TX OFF level co-location is the most suitable method to show
conformance.
The _co-location reference antenna_ shall be a single column passive antenna
which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h), frequency range,
polarization, as the composite antenna of the _IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-O_
and nominal 65° horizontal half-power beamwidth (suitable for 3-sector
deployment) and is placed at a distance _d_ from the edge of the _IAB-DU_ or
_IAB-MT type 1-O_ , as shown in figure 4.10-1.
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="4.061111111111111in"}
Figure 4.10-1: Illustration of _IAB-DU_ and _IAB-MT type 1-O_ enclosure and
co-location reference antenna
Edge-to-edge separation _d_ between the _IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-O_ and the
_co-location reference antenna_ shall be set to 0.1 m.
The _IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-O_ and the _co-location reference antenna_
shall be aligned in a common plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight
direction, as shown in figure 4.10-1.
The _co-location reference antenna_ and the _IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-O_ can
have different width.
The vertical radiating regions of the _co-location reference antenna_ and the
_IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-O_ composite antenna shall be aligned.
For co-location requirements where the frequency range of the signal at the
_co-location reference antenna_ is different from the _IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type
1-O_ , a _co-location reference antenna_ suitable for the frequency stated in
the requirement is assumed.
OTA co-location requirements are based on the power at the conducted interface
of a _co-location reference antenna_ , depending on the requirement this
interface is either an input or an output. For _IAB-DU_ or _IAB-MT type 1-O_
with dual polarization _the co-location reference antenna_ has two conducted
interfaces each representing one polarization.
# 5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
## 5.1 General
The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the _operating
bands_ and _IAB-DU or IAB-MT channel bandwidths_ defined in the present
release of specifications.
NOTE: Other _operating bands_ and _IAB-DU or IAB-MT channel bandwidth_ s may
be considered in future releases.
Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges in which
NR can operate according to the present version of the specification are
identified as described in table 5.1-1.

## 5.3 Channel bandwidth
### 5.3.1 General
The IAB-DU channel bandwidth supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink or
downlink at the IAB node. Different UE or IAB-MT channel bandwidths may be
supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving from UEs
or IAB-MT connected to the IAB-DU. The placement of the UE or IAB-MT channel
bandwidth is flexible but can only be completely within the IAB-DU channel
bandwidth. The IAB-DU shall be able to transmit to and/or receive from one or
more UE or IAB-MT Bandwidth parts that are smaller than or equal to the number
of carrier resource blocks on the RF carrier, in any part of the carrier
resource blocks.
The IAB-MT channel bandwidth supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink or
downlink at the IAB-MT. From a BS or IAB-DU perspective, different IAB-MT
channel bandwidths may be supported within the same spectrum for transmitting
to and receiving from UEs or IAB-MT connected to the IAB-DU. Transmission of
multiple carriers to the same IAB-MT (CA) or multiple carriers to different
UEs or IAB-MT within the IAB-DU channel bandwidth can be supported.
From a IAB-MT perspective, the IAB-MT is configured with one or more BWP /
carriers, each with its own IAB-MT channel bandwidth. The IAB-MT does not need
to be aware of the BS or IAB-DU channel bandwidth or how the BS or IAB-DU
allocates bandwidth to different UEs or IAB-MT.
The placement of the IAB-MT channel bandwidth for each IAB-MT carrier is
flexible but can only be completely within the IAB-donor or IAB-DU channel
bandwidth.
The relationship between the IAB-DU or IAB-MT channel bandwidth, the guardband
and the transmission bandwidth configuration is shown in Figure 5.3.1-1.

# 6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics are
specified at the _TAB connector_ for _IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-H_ , with a
full complement of transceiver units for the configuration in normal operating
conditions.
_For IAB-DU and IAB-MT_ _type 1-H the manufacturer shall declare the minimum
number of supported geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas c_ overed by
beams _). The declaration is done separately for IAB-DU and IAB-MT. The
minimum number of supported geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the
setting with the minimum amount of cell splitting supported with transmission
on all TAB connectors supporting the operating band,_ or with minimum amount
of transmitted beams _._
_For IAB-DU and IAB-MT_ _type 1-H manufacturer shall also declare TAB
connector TX min cell groups. The declaration is done separately for IAB-DU
and IAB-MT._ Every _TAB connector_ of the _IAB-DU type 1-H_ and IAB-MT type
1-H supporting transmission in an _operating band_ shall map to one _TAB
connector_ _TX min cell group_ supporting the same _operating band_ , where
_mapping of TAB connectors to cells/beams is implementation dependent._
_The number of active transmitter units that are considered when calculating
the conducted TX emissions limits (N~TXU,counted~) for IAB-DU and IAB-MT type
1-H is calculated as follows:_
N~TXU,counted~ = _min(N~TXU,active~ , 8×N~cells~)_
N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of _basic limits_ and is derived as
N~TXU,countedpercell~ = _N~TXU,counted~ / N~cells~_
NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of _active transmitter unit_
s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified reference
condition.
For _IAB-DU type 1-H_ this requirement shall apply at each _TAB connector_
supporting transmission in the _operating band_.
NOTE: The upper limit of the dynamic range is the OFDM symbol power for a BS
when transmitting on all RBs at maximum output power. The lower limit of the
total power dynamic range is the average power for single RB transmission. The
OFDM symbol shall carry PDSCH and not contain RS or SSB.
##### 6.3.1.3.2 Minimum requirement for IAB-DU _type 1-H_
The total power dynamic range is specified the same as the total power dynamic
range requirement for BS _type 1-H_ in TS 38.104 [2], subclause 6.3.3.2, where
references to _BS channel bandwidth_ apply to _IAB-DU channel bandwidth_.
### 6.3.2 IAB-MT Output Power Dynamics
#### 6.3.2.1 Total power dynamic range
##### 6.3.2.1.1 General
The IAB-MT total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum and
the minimum controlled transmit power in the channel bandwidth for a specified
reference condition. The maximum and minimum output powers are defined as the
mean power in at least one sub-frame 1ms.
NOTE: The specified reference condition(s) are specified in the conformance
specification Changes in the controlled transmit power in the channel
bandwidth due to changes in the specified reference condition are not included
as part of the dynamic range.

shall be larger than or equal to 10 dB.
### 6.3.3 Power control
#### 6.3.3.1 Relative power tolerance for local area IAB-MT type 1-H

output power in a target sub-frame (1 ms) relatively to the power of the most
recently transmitted reference sub-frame (1 ms) if the transmission gap
between these sub-frames is less than or equal to 20 ms.
The minimum requirements specified for each _TAB-connector_ in Table 6.3.3.1-1
apply only when the output power is within the limits set by declared maximum
output power and specified dynamic range.
2 exceptions are allowed for each of two test patterns. The test patterns are
a monotonically increasing power sweep and a monotonically decreasing power
sweep. For those exceptions, the power tolerance limit is a maximum of [± 6.0
dB] in Table 6.3.3.1-1.

1-H_ in TS 38.104[2], subclause 7.7.2, where references to _BS channel
bandwidth_ apply to _IAB-MT channel bandwidth_.
Interfering signal for IAB-MT _type 1-H_ should be CP-OFDM
## 7.8 In-channel selectivity
### 7.8.1 General
In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to receive a
wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations _TAB connector_ for
_IAB-DU type 1-H_ in the presence of an interfering signal received at a
larger power spectral density. In this condition a throughput requirement
shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel. The interfering
signal shall be an NR signal which is time aligned with the wanted signal.
### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement for _IAB-DU type 1-H_
The wide area IAB-DU receiver in-channel selectivity requirement is specified
the same as the wide area receiver in-channel selectivity requirement for BS
_type 1-H_ in TS 38.104[2], subclause 7.8.2, where references to _BS channel
bandwidth_ apply to _IAB-DU channel bandwidth_.
The medium range IAB-DU receiver in-channel selectivity requirement is
specified the same as the medium range BS receiver in-channel selectivity
requirement for BS _type 1-H_ in TS 38.104[2], subclause 7.8.2, where
references to _BS channel bandwidth_ apply to _IAB-DU channel bandwidth_.
The local area IAB-DU receiver in-channel selectivity requirement is specified
the same as the local area BS receiver in-channel selectivity requirement for
BS _type 1-H_ in TS 38.104[2], subclause 7.8.2, where references to _BS
channel bandwidth_ apply to _IAB-DU channel bandwidth_.
Referenced requirements applying to NB-IoT are not applicable to the IAB-DU
# 8 Conducted performance requirements
## 8.1 IAB-DU performance requirements
### 8.1.1 General
Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the IAB type 1-H to
correctly demodulate signals in various conditions and configurations.
Conducted performance requirements are specified at the TAB connector(s).
Conducted performance requirements for the IAB-DU are specified for the fixed
reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation conditions in annex
I. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the IAB-DU.
Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single carrier
only. Performance requirements for an IAB-DU supporting carrier aggregation
are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.
The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined
as:
SNR = S / N
Where:
S is the total signal energy in the slot on a single TAB connector.
N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the duration of a slot on a single TAB connector.
### 8.1.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
#### 8.1.2.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled
##### 8.1.2.1.1 General
The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

#### 8.1.2.3 Requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH
##### 8.1.2.3.1 General
In the tests for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only contains
CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, and there is no HACK/ACK information
transmitted.
The CSI part 1 block error probability (BLER) is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1
information is sent as follow:
$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 1} = \ \frac{#(false\ CSI\ part\ 1)}{#(CSI\ part\
1)}$
where:
\- #(false CSI part 1) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI part 1
information transmitted occasions
\- #(CSI part 1) denotes the number of CSI part 1 information transmitted
occasions.
The CSI part 2 block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part 2
information is sent as follows:
$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 2} = \ \frac{#(false\ CSI\ part\ 2)}{#(CSI\ part\
2)}$
where:
\- #(false CSI part 2) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI part 2
information transmitted occasions
\- #(CSI part 2) denotes the number of CSI part 2 information transmitted
occasions.
The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two cases as
follows:
\- 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2
\- 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2
The 7bits UCI case is further defined with the bitmap [c0 c1 c2 c3 c4] = [0 1
0 1 0] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is mapping to the RI information,
and with the bitmap [c0 c1] = [1 0] for CSI part2 information.
The 40bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit selection.
In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information are
transmitted simultaneously.

### 8.1.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
#### 8.1.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability
##### 8.1.4.1.1 General
The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas, for
any channel bandwidth.
The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of erroneous
detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when
input is only noise.
##### 8.1.4.1.2 Minimum requirement
The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.
#### 8.1.4.2 PRACH detection requirements
##### 8.1.4.2.1 General
The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several error
cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not
detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong
timing estimation. A timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of
the timing of the strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance given
in Table 8.1.4.2.1-1.

The test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.2.5-1 and the test
parameter _msg1-FrequencyStart_ is set to 0.
##### 8.1.4.2.2 Minimum requirements for normal mode

## 8.2 IAB-MT requirements
### 8.2.1 General
Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the _IAB-MT type
1-H_ to correctly demodulate signals in various conditions and configurations.
Conducted performance requirements are specified at the _TAB connector(s)_
(for _IAB-MT type 1-H_).
Conducted performance requirements for the IAB-MT are specified for the fixed
reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation conditions in annex
I. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the IAB-MT.
The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined
as:
SNR = S / N
Where:
S is the total signal energy in the slot on a single _TAB connector_ (for
_IAB-MT type 1-H_).
N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the duration of a slot on a single TAB connector (for _IAB-MT
type 1-H_).
### 8.2.2 Demodulation performance requirements
#### 8.2.2.1 Performance requirements for PDSCH
##### 8.2.2.1.1 General
The performance requirement of PDSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

#### 8.2.3.2 Reporting of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)
##### 8.2.3.2.1 General
The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under frequency
non-selective conditions is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER
performance using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.
The purpose is to verify that the reported CQI values are in accordance with
the CQI definition given in TS 38.214 [11]. To account for sensitivity of the
input SNR the reporting definition is considered to be verified if the
reporting accuracy is met for at least one of two SNR levels separated by an
offset of 1 dB.

##### 8.2.3.2.2 Minimum requirements
For the parameters specified in Table 8.2.3.2.1-1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in Annex A, the minimum requirements are specified
by the following:
> a) The reported CQI value according to the reference channel shall be in the
> range of ±1 of the reported median more than 90% of the time.
>
> b) If the PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by median CQI is
> less than or equal to 0.1, then the BLER using the transport format
> indicated by the (median CQI+1) shall be greater than 0.1. If the PDSCH BLER
> using the transport format indicated by the median CQI is greater than 0.1,
> then the BLER using transport format indicated by (median CQI-1) shall be
> less than or equal to 0.1.
#### 8.2.3.3 Reporting of Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI)
##### 8.2.3.3.1 General
The minimum performance requirements of PMI reporting are defined based on the
precoding gain, expressed as the relative increase in throughput when the
transmitter is configured according to the IAB-MT reported PMI compared to the
case when the transmitter is using random precoding, respectively. When the
transmitter uses random precoding, for each PDSCH allocation a precoder is
randomly generated with equal propability of each applicable i~1~ and i~2~
combination and applied to the PDSCH. A fixed transport format (FRC) is
configured for all requirements.
The requirements for transmission mode 1 with higher layer parameter
_codebookType_ set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' are specified in terms of the
ratio:
In the definition of _γ_ , for 4TX, 8TX PMI requirements, is 90 % of the
maximum throughput obtained at using the precoders configured according to the
IAB-MT reports, and is the throughput measured at with random precoding.

# 9 Radiated transmitter characteristics
## 9.1 General
Radiated transmitter characteristics requirements apply on the _IAB-DU and
IAB-MT type 1-H_ , _IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-O_ , or _IAB-DU and IAB-MT type
2-O_ including all its functional components active and for all foreseen modes
of operation unless otherwise stated.
_For IAB-MT_ _type 1-O manufacturer shall also declare N~TXU,active~.
N~TXU,active~_ active transmitter units supporting the same _operating band_
_is implementation dependent._
_The number of active transmitter units that are considered when calculating
the radiated TX emissions limits (N~TXU,counted~) for IAB-MT type 1-O is
calculated as follows:_
N~TXU,counted~ = _min(N~TXU,active~ , 8)_
N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of _basic limits_ and is derived as
N~TXU,countedpercell~ = _N~TXU,counted~_
NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of _active transmitter unit_
s.
## 9.2 Radiated transmit power
### 9.2.1 General
_IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-H, IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-O_ and _IAB-DU and IAB-
MT type 2-O_ are declared to support one or more beams, as per manufacturer\'s
declarations. Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a
declared beam at a specific _beam peak direction_. Declarations are done for
IAB-DU and IAB-MT separately.
For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam identity,
_reference beam direction pair_ , beamwidth, _rated beam EIRP_ , _OTA peak
directions set_ , the _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering
directions and their associated _rated beam EIRP_ and beamwidth(s).
For a declared beam and _beam direction pair_ , the _rated beam EIRP_ level is
the maximum power that the base station is declared to radiate at the
associated _beam peak direction_ during the _transmitter ON period_.
For each _beam peak direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within
the _OTA peak directions set_ , a specific _rated beam EIRP_ level may be
claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as
described below. _Rated beam EIRP_ is only required to be declared for the
_beam direction pairs_ subject to conformance testing.
NOTE 1: _OTA peak directions set_ is set of _beam peak directions_ for which
the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The _beam peak
directions_ are related to a corresponding contiguous range or discrete list
of _beam centre directions_ by the _beam direction pairs_ included in the set.
NOTE 2: A _beam direction pair_ is data set consisting of the _beam centre
direction_ and the related _beam peak direction._
NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer for
verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the manufacturer to
the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment and is not subject to
formal conformance testing.
For _operating bands_ where the supported _fractional bandwidth_ (FBW) is
larger than 6%, two rated carrier EIRP may be declared by manufacturer:
\- P~rated,c,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and
\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.
For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated carrier EIRP is:
\- P~rated,c,FBWlow,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \ \- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
> measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the OTA wanted
> signal is identified in subclause 10.3.2 and subclause 10.3.3 for each _IAB
> Node channel bandwidth_.

### 10.6.4 Co-location minimum requirement for IAB-MT type 1-O and IAB-DU type
1-O
This additional OTA out-of-band blocking requirement may be applied for the
protection of IAB receivers when NR, E‑UTRA BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS , GSM/EDGE BS
or IAB-DU and/or IAB-MT operating in a different frequency band are co-located
with an IAB-Node.
The requirement is a co-location requirement. The interferer power levels are
specified at the _co-location reference antenna_ conducted input. The
interfering signal power is specified per supported polarization.
The requirement is valid over the _minSENS RoAoA_.
For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.4-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the OTA wanted
signal is identified in clause 10.3 for each _IAB channel bandwidth_ and
further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal
is further specified in annex F.
For _IAB type 1-O_ the OTA blocking requirement for co-location with BS or
IAB-Node in other frequency bands is applied for all _operating bands_ for
which co-location protection is provided.

## 10.7 OTA receiver spurious emissions
### 10.7.1 General
The OTA RX spurious emission is the power of the emissions radiated from the
antenna array from a receiver unit.
The metric used to capture OTA receiver spurious emissions for IAB-MT and IAB-
DU for _IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type 2-O_ is _total radiated power_ (TRP), with
the requirement defined at the RIB.
For _IAB-MT type 1-O_ manufacturer shall declare _N~RXU,active\ ~_.
_N~RXU,active\ ~_ active receiver units supporting the same _operating band_
is implementation dependent.
The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating the
radiated RX spurious emission limits (N~RXU,counted~) for _IAB-MT type 1-O_ is
calculated as follows:
> N~RXU,counted~ = _min(N~RXU,active~ , 8)_
N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of _basic limits_ and is derived as
N~RXU,countedpercell~ = _N~RXU,counted~._
NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units.

Minimum requirement is the same as specified for BS type 2-O in TS 38.104[2],
subclause 10.7.3.
### 10.7.3 IAB-MT OTA receiver spurious emissions
#### 10.7.3.1 Minimum requirement for IAB-MT type 1-O
For an IAB-MT operating in TDD, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirement
shall apply during the _transmitter OFF period_ only.
For RX only _multi-band RIB_ , the OTA RX spurious emissions requirements are
subject to exclusion zones in each supported _operating band_.
The OTA RX spurious emissions requirement for _IAB-MT type 1-O_ is that for
each _basic limit_ specified in table 10.7.3.1‑1 _,_ the power sum of
emissions at the RIB shall not exceed limits specified as the _basic limit_ \+
X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~) dB, unless stated differently in
regional regulation.

requirement for BS _type 2-O_ in TS 38.104[2], subclause 10.9.3, where
references to _BS channel bandwidth_ apply to _IAB-DU channel bandwidth_.
The local area IAB-DU receiver in-channel selectivity requirement is specified
the same as the local area BS receiver in-channel selectivity requirement for
BS _type 2-O_ in TS 38.104[2], subclause 10.9.3, where references to _BS
channel bandwidth_ apply to _IAB-DU channel bandwidth_.
# 11 Radiated performance requirements
## 11.1 IAB-DU performance requirements
### 11.1.1 General
Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the _IAB-DU type 1-O_
or _IAB-DU type 2-O_ to correctly demodulate radiated signals in various
conditions and configurations. Radiated performance requirements are specified
at the RIB.
Radiated performance requirements for the IAB-DU are specified for the fixed
reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation conditions in annex
I. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the IAB-DU.
The radiated performance requirements for _IAB-DU type 1-O_ and for _IAB-DU
type 2-O_ are limited to two OTA _demodulation branches_ as described in
clause 11.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2
_demodulation branches_ depending on the number of polarizations supported by
the IAB-DU, with the required SNR applied separately per polarization.
NOTE 1: The IAB-DU can support more than 2 _demodulation branches_ , however
OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 _demodulation
branches_.
Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for a IAB-DU supporting CA are
defined in terms of single carrier requirements.
In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may be
provided from the IAB-DU to the signal generator, to enable correct timing of
the wanted signal.
Whenever the \"RX antennas\" term is used for the radiated performance
requirements description, it shall refer to the _demodulation branches_ (i.e.
not physical antennas of the antenna array).
The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined
as:
SNR = S / N
Where:
S is the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.
N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the _transmission
bandwidth_ over the duration of a slot on a RIB.
### 11.1.2 OTA demodulation branches
Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2 _demodulation
branches_.
If the _IAB-DU type 1-O_ , or the _IAB-DU type 2-O_ uses polarization
diversity and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals for
each of the _demodulation branches_ , then radiated performance requirements
can be tested for up to two _demodulation branches_ (i.e. 1RX or 2RX test
setups). When tested for two _demodulation branches_ , each demodulation
branch maps to one polarization.
If the _IAB-DU type 1-O_ , or the _IAB-DU type 2-O_ does not use polarization
diversity then radiated performance requirements can only be tested for a
single _demodulation branch_ (i.e. 1RX test setup).
### 11.1.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
#### 11.1.2.1 Performance requirements for _IAB type 1-O_
##### 11.1.2.1.1 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding
disabled
Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.1.2.1 for 2Rx.
##### 11.1.2.1.2 Performance requirmements for PUSCH with transform precoding
enabled
Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.1.2.2 for 2Rx.
##### 11.1.2.1.3 Performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH
Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.1.2.3 for 2Rx.
#### 11.1.2.2 Performance requirements for IAB type 2-O
##### 11.1.2.2.1 Performance requirmements for PUSCH with transform precoding
disabled
##### 11.1.2.2.1.1 General {#general-85 .H6}
The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of the maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

The CSI part 1 block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoded the CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1 information
is sent as follow:
$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 1} = \ \frac{#(false\ CSI\ part\ 1)}{#(CSI\ part\
1)}$
where:
\- #(false CSI part 1) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI part 1
information transmitted occasions
\- #(CSI part 1) denotes the number of CSI part 1information transmitted
occasions.
The CSI part 2 block error probability (BLER) is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoded the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part 2 information
is sent as follows:
$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 2} = \ \frac{#(false\ CSI\ part\ 2)}{#(CSI\ part\
2)}$
where:
\- #(false CSI part 2) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI part 2
information transmitted occasions
\- #(CSI part 2) denotes the number of CSI part 2 information transmitted
occasions.
The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two cases as
follows:
\- 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2
\- 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2
The 7bits UCI case is further defined with the bitmap [c0 c1 c2 c3 c4] = [0 1
0 1 0] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is mapping to the RI information,
and with the bitmap [c0 c1] = [1 0] for CSI part2 information.
The 40bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit selection.
In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information are
transmitted simultaneously.

##### 11.1.4.2.1.1 General {#general-95 .H6}
The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas, for
any channel bandwidth.
The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of erroneous
detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when
input is only noise.
##### 11.1.4.2.1.2 Minimum requirement {#minimum-requirement-6 .H6}
The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.
##### 11.1.4.2.2 PRACH missed detection requirements
##### 11.1.4.2.2.1 General {#general-96 .H6}
The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several error
cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not
detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong
timing estimation. For AWGN and TDLA30-300, a timing estimation error occurs
if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the
time error tolerance given in Table 11.1.4.2.2.1-1.

## 11.2 IAB-MT performance requirements
### 11.2.1 General
Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the _IAB-MT type 1-O_
or the _IAB-MT type 2-O_ to correctly demodulate radiated signals in various
conditions and configurations. Radiated performance requirements are specified
at the RIB.
Radiated performance requirements for the IAB-MT are specified for the fixed
reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation conditions in annex
I. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the IAB-MT.
The radiated performance requirements for the _IAB-MT type 1-O_ and for the
_IAB-MT type 2-O_ are limited to two OTA _demodulation branches_ as described
in clause 11.2.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2
_demodulation branches_ depending on the number of polarizations supported by
the IAB-MT, with the required SNR applied separately per polarization.
NOTE 1: The IAB-MT can support more than 2 _demodulation branches_ , however
OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 _demodulation
branches_.
Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only.
Whenever the \"RX antennas\" term is used for the radiated performance
requirements description, it shall refer to the _demodulation branches_ (i.e.
not physical antennas of the antenna array).
The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined
as:
SNR = S / N
Where:
S is the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.
N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the _transmission
bandwidth_ over the duration of a slot on a RIB
Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2 _demodulation
branches_.
### 11.2.2 OTA demodulation branches
If the _IAB-MT type 1-O_ , or the _IAB-MT type 2-O_ uses polarization
diversity and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals for
each of the _demodulation branches_ , then radiated performance requirements
can be tested for up to two _demodulation branches_ (i.e. 1RX or 2RX test
setups). When tested for two _demodulation branches_ , each demodulation
branch maps to one polarization.
If the _IAB-MT type 1-O_ , or the _IAB-MT type 2-O_ does not use polarization
diversity then radiated performance requirements can only be tested for a
single _demodulation branch_ (i.e. 1RX test setup).
### 11.2.2 Demodulation performance requirements
#### 11.2.2.1 Performance requireements for IAB type 1-O
##### 11.2.2.1.1 Performance requirements for PDSCH
##### 11.2.2.1.1.1 General {#general-98 .H6}
The performance requirement of PDSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

##### 11.2.3.2.2 Reporting of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)
##### 11.2.3.2.2.1 General {#general-103 .H6}
The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under frequency
non-selective conditions is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER
performance using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.
The purpose is to verify that the reported CQI values are in accordance with
the CQI definition given in TS 38.214 [11]. To account for sensitivity of the
input SNR the reporting definition is considered to be verified if the
reporting accuracy is met for at least one of two SNR levels separated by an
offset of 1 dB.

For the parameters specified in Table 11.2.3.2.1.1-1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in Annex A, the minimum requirements are specified
by the following:
> a) The reported CQI value according to the reference channel shall be in the
> range of ±1 of the reported median more than 90% of the time.
>
> b) If the PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by median CQI is
> less than or equal to 0.1, then the BLER using the transport format
> indicated by the (median CQI+1) shall be greater than 0.1. If the PDSCH BLER
> using the transport format indicated by the median CQI is greater than 0.1,
> then the BLER using transport format indicated by (median CQI-1) shall be
> less than or equal to 0.1.
##### 11.2.3.2.3 Reporting of Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI)
##### 11.2.3.2.3.1 General {#general-104 .H6}
The minimum performance requirements of PMI reporting are defined based on the
precoding gain, expressed as the relative increase in throughput when the
transmitter is configured according to the IAB-MT reports compared to the case
when the transmitter is using random precoding, respectively. When the
transmitter uses random precoding, for each PDSCH allocation a precoder is
randomly generated and applied to the PDSCH. A fixed transport format (FRC) is
configured for all requirements.
The requirements for transmission mode 1 with 2TX and higher layer parameter
_codebookType_ set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' are specified in terms of the

##### 11.2.3.2.4 Reporting of Rank Indicator (RI)
##### 11.2.3.2.4.1 General {#general-105 .H6}
The purpose of this test is to verify that the reported rank indicator
accurately represents the channel rank. The accuracy of RI reporting is
determined by the relative increase of the throughput obtained when
transmitting based on the reported rank compared to the case for which a fixed
rank is used for transmission.
The minimum performance requirement in Table 11.2.3.2.4.2-1 is defined as
a) The ratio of the throughput obtained when transmitting based on IAB-MT
reported RI and that obtained when transmitting with fixed rank 1 shall be ≥
γ~1~;
b) The ratio of the throughput obtained when transmitting based on IAB-MT
reported RI and that obtained when transmitting with fixed rank 2 shall be ≥
γ~2~;

# 12 Radio Resource Management requirements
## 12.1 RRC_CONNECTED state mobility for IAB-MTs
### 12.1.1 RRC Connection Mobility Control
#### 12.1.1.1 SA: RRC Re-establishment
##### 12.1.1.1.1 Introduction
This clause contains requirements on the IAB-MT regarding RRC connection re-
establishment procedure. RRC connection re-establishment is initiated when an
IAB-MT in RRC_CONNECTED state loses RRC connection due to any of failure
cases, including radio link failure, handover failure, and RRC connection
reconfiguration failure. The RRC connection re-establishment procedure is
specified in clause 5.3.7 of TS 38.331 [15].
The requirements in this clause are applicable for RRC connection re-
establishment to NR cell.
##### 12.1.1.1.2 Requirements
In RRC_CONNECTED state the IAB-MT shall be capable of sending
_RRCReestablishmentRequest_ message within T~re-establish_delay~ seconds from
the moment it detects a loss in RRC connection. The total RRC connection delay
(T~re-establish_delay~) shall be less than:
$$T_{re - establish_ delay} = T_{IAB - MT_ re - establish_ delay} + T_{UL_
grant}$$
T~UL_grant~: It is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from
the target PCell. The uplink grant is required to transmit
_RRCReestablishmentRequest_ message.
The IAB-MT re-establishment delay (T~IAB-MT_re-establish_delay~) is specified
in clause 12.1.1.1.2.1.
###### 12.1.1.1.2.1 IAB MT Re-establishment delay requirement
The IAB-MT re-establishment delay (T~IAB-MT_re-establish_delay~) is the time
between the moments when any of the conditions requiring RRC re-establishment
as defined in clause 5.3.7 in TS 38.331 [15] is detected by the IAB-MT and
when the IAB-MT sends PRACH to the target PCell. The IAB-MT re-establishment
delay (T~IAB-MT_re-establish_delay~) requirement shall be less than:
$$T_{IAB - MT_ re - establish_ delay} = 400\ \text{ms} + T_{identify_ intra_
NR} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{identify_ inter_ NR,i} + T_{SI -
NR} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$
The intra-frequency target NR cell shall be considered detectable if each
relevant SSB can satisfy that:
\- the conditions of SSB_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex H.1.1.1 for a
corresponding IAB-MT class and IAB type are fulfilled.
The inter-frequency target NR cell shall be considered detectable when for
each relevant SSB:
\- the conditions of SSB_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex H.1.1.2 for a
corresponding IAB-MT class and IAB type are fulfilled.
T~identify_intra_NR~: It is the time to identify the target intra-frequency NR
cell and it depends on whether the target NR cell is known cell or unknown
cell and on the frequency range (FR) of the target NR cell. If the IAB-MT is
not configured with intra-frequency NR carrier for RRC re-establishment then
T~identify_intra_NR~=0; otherwise T~identify_intra_NR~ shall not exceed the
values defined in Table 12.1.1.1.2.1-1.
T~identify_inter_NR,i~: It is the time to identify the target inter-frequency
NR cell on inter-frequency carrier _i_ configured for RRC re-establishment and
it depends on whether the target NR cell is known cell or unknown cell and on
the frequency range (FR) of the target NR cell. T~identify_inter_NR,i~ shall
not exceed the values defined in Table 12.1.1.1.2.1-2.
T~SMTC~: It is the periodicity of the SMTC occasion configured for the intra-
frequency carrier. If the IAB-MT has been provided with higher layer signaling
of _smtc2 [15]_ and is not capable of 4 SMTC configurations per frequency
[15], then T~SMTC~ follows _smtc1_ or _smtc2_ according to the physical cell
ID of the target cell. If the IAB-MT has been provided with higher layer
signaling of _smtcj_ , where 1≤ _j_ ≤4 [15] and is also capable of 4 SMTC
configurations per frequency [15], then T~SMTC~ follows _smtcj_ according to
the physical cell ID of the target cell.
T~SMTC,i~: It is the periodicity of the SMTC occasion configured for the
inter-frequency carrier _i_. If the IAB-MT is not capable of 4 SMTC
configurations per frequency [15], then the requirements shall apply provided
that the IAB-MT is configured with only one SMTC configuration for each inter-
frequency carrier _i_ according to the physical cell ID of the target cell. If
the IAB-MT has been provided with higher layer signaling of _smtcj_ , where 1≤
_j_ ≤4 [15] and is also capable of 4 SMTC configurations per frequency [15],
then T~SMTC~ follows _smtcj_ configured for the inter-frequency carrier _i_
according to the physical cell ID of the target cell. If the IAB-MT is not
provided with SMTC configuration then the IAB-MT may assume that the target
SSB periodicity is no larger than 160 ms.
T~SI-NR~: It is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay
of system information blocks defined in TS 38.331 [15] for the target NR cell.
T~PRACH:~ It is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH
occasion in the target NR cell. T~PRACH~ can be up to the summation of SSB to
PRACH occasion association period and 10 ms. SSB to PRACH occasion associated
period is defined in clause 14 of TS 38.213 [10].
_N~freq~_ : It is the total number of NR frequencies to be monitored for RRC
re-establishment; N~freq~ = 1 if the target intra-frequency NR cell is known,
else N~freq~ = 2 and T~identify_intra_NR~ = 0 if the target inter-frequency NR
cell is known.
There is no requirement if the target cell does not contain the IAB-MT context
or if the SSB transmission periodicity is larger than 160 ms.
In the requirement defined in the below tables, the target FR1 cell is known
if it has been meeting the relevant cell identification requirement during the
last 5 seconds otherwise it is unknown.

If the IAB-MT is not capable of 4 SMTC configurations per frequency [15], and
is provided with higher layer signaling of smtcj, where 1≤ _j_ ≤2 [15], then
T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtcj~max~ where j~max~ is the maximum value of all j
for which smtcj has been configured.
If the IAB-MT is capable of 4 SMTC configurations per frequency [15], and is
provided with higher layer signaling of smtcj, where 1≤ _j_ ≤4 [15], then
T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtcj~max~ where j~max~ is the maximum value of all j
for which smtcj has been configured.
> NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for RLM and SMTC means that CSI-RS based
> RLM is within the SMTC window duration.
Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource and SMTC occasionconfigurations does not meet previous conditions.
The values of M~out~ and M~in~ used in Table 12.3.1.3.2-1 and Table
12.3.1.3.2-2 are defined as:
\- M~out~ = 20 and M~in~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource configured for RLM is

##### G.2.1.1.1.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.1.4.1-test-purpose-
and-environment .H6}
The purpose is to verify that the NR intra-frequency RRC re-establishment
delay in FR2 without serving cell timing is within the specified limits. These
tests will verify the requirements in clause 12.1.1.1. This test case is
applicable only for local area IAB-MT and for IAB type 2-O.
The test parameters are given in table G.2.1.1.1.4.1-1, table G.2.1.1.1.4.1-2
and table G.2.1.1.1.4.1-3 below. The test consists of 3 successive time
periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of
time period T2, cell 1, which is the active cell, is deactivated. The time
period T3 starts after the occurrence of the radio link failure.

##### G.2.1.1.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.2.1.1-test-purpose-
and-environment .H6}
This test is to verify RRC connection release with redirection from NR to NR
requirements specified in clause 12.1.1.3.
##### G.2.1.1.2.1.2 Test Parameters {#g.2.1.1.2.1.2-test-parameters .H6}
Supported test configurations are shown in table G.2.1.1.2.1.2-1. The time
delay is tested by using the parameters in table G.2.1.1.2.1.2-2, and
G.2.1.1.2.1.2-3.
The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1,
and T2 respectively. The _RRCRelease_ message shall be sent to the IAB-MT
during period T1 and the start of T2 is the instant when the last TTI
containing the RRC message is sent to the IAB-MT. Prior to time duration T2,
the IAB-MT shall not have any timing information of Cell 2. Cell 2 is powered
up at the beginning of the T2.

##### G.2.1.1.2.1.3 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.2.1.3-test-requirements .H6}
The IAB-MT shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 7480 ms from
the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct RRC connection release redirection to NR observed during
repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
> NOTE: The redirection delay can be expressed as:
T~connection_release_redirect_NR~ = T~RRC_procedure_delay~ + T~identify-NR~ +
T~SI-NR~ + T~RACH~,
> where:
>
> T~RRC_procedure_delay~ = 110 ms in the test.
>
> T~identify-NR~ = 5440 ms in the test.
>
> T~SI-NR~ = 1280 ms, it is the time required for receiving all the relevant
> system information.
>
> T~RACH~ = 650 ms in the test.
>
> This gives a total of 7480 ms.

##### G.2.1.1.2.2.3 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.2.2.3-test-requirements .H6}
The IAB-MT shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 9080 ms from
the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct RRC connection release redirection to NR observed during
repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
> NOTE: The redirection delay can be expressed as:
T~connection_release_redirect_NR~ = T~RRC_procedure_delay~ + T~identify-NR~ +
T~SI-NR~ + T~RACH~,
> where:
>
> T~RRC_procedure_delay~ = 110 ms **in the test**.
>
> T~identify-NR~ = 7040 ms in the test.
>
> T~SI-NR~ = 1280 ms, it is the time required for receiving all the relevant
> system information.
>
> T~RACH~ = 650 ms in the test.
This gives a total of 9080 ms.

##### G.2.3.1.1.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.1.1.2-test-requirements .H6}
The IAB-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3 shall be
as follows:
During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall transmit
uplink signal at least in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission
according to the configured periodic CSI reporting.
The IAB-MT shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time point C
(D1 second after the start of the time duration T3).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
##### G.2.3.1.2 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured
with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode
##### G.2.3.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.2.1-test-purpose-and-
environment .H6}
The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects the out
of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality
of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 radio link monitoring
requirements in clause 12.3.1.
In the test, IAB-MT is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
_detectionResource_ included in _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ set to SSB#0 and
SSB#1, and _purpose_ set to '_rlf_ '. Supported test configurations are shown
in table G.2.3.1.2.1-1. The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.2.1-2,
and G.2.3.1.2.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell 1), which is the active cell,
in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.2.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and
in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT shall
be fully synchronized to Cell 1. Prior to the start of the time duration T1,
the IAB-MT shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be
configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 5 ms.

The IAB-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
shall be as follows:
During the period from time point A to time point F (D1 second after the start
of time duration T5) the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink signal at least in all
uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to the configured
periodic CSI reporting.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
##### G.2.3.1.3 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR2 PCell
configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode
##### G.2.3.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.3.1-test-purpose-and-
environment .H6}
The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects the out
of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality
of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR2 radio link monitoring
requirements in clause 12.3.1.
In the test, IAB-MT is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
_detectionResource_ included in _RadioLinkMonitoringRS_ set to SSB#0 and
SSB#1, and _purpose_ set to '_rlf_ '. Supported test configurations are shown
in table G.2.3.1.3.1-1. The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.3.1-2
and G.2.3.1.3.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell 1), which is the active NR
cell, in the test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.3.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and
in-sync states, and Figure G.2.3.1.3.1-2 shows the Time multiplexed downlink
transmissions from each Angle of Arrival. Prior to the start of the time
duration T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. The IAB-MT
shall be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of
5 ms.

configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode
##### G.2.3.1.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.5.1-test-purpose-and-
environment .H6}
The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects the out
of sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based radio link quality
of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 PCell CSI-RS Out-of-sync
radio link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.3. This test case is
applicable only for local area IAB-MT and for IAB type 1-H.
The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.5.1-1, G.2.3.1.5.1-2 and
G.2.3.1.5.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the PCell, in the
test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.5.1-1 shows the variation of the
downlink SNR in the PCell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to
the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully synchronized to
cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a
reporting periodicity defined in CSI-RS configuration. In the test, SSB0 is
configured as the BFD-RS.

with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode
##### G.2.3.1.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.8.1-test-purpose-and-
environment .H6}
The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects the in
sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based radio link quality of
the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR2 PCell CSI-RS In-sync radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.3. This test case is applicable
only for local area IAB-MT and for IAB type 2-O.
The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.8.1-1, G.2.3.1.8.1-2 and
G.2.3.1.8.1-3 below. There is one cells, cell 1which is the PCell, in the
test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.8.1-1 shows the variation
of the downlink SNR in the PCell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of 10 ms. In the test, SSB0 and SSB1
are configured as BFD-RS.

90%.
#### G.2.3.2 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Procedure
##### G.2.3.2.1 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR1 PCell
configured with SSB-based BFD and LR
##### G.2.3.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.2.1.1-test-purpose-and-
environment .H6}
The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects SSB-
based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell and that the
IAB-MT performs correct SSB-based link recovery based on beam candidate set
q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for beam failure
detection within the IAB-MTs active DL BWP, during the evaluation period, and
link recovery. This test will partly verify the SSB based beam failure
detection and link recovery for an FR1 serving cell requirements in clause
12.3.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.1.1-1, G.2.3.2.1.1-2 and
G.2.3.2.1.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active cell, in
the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure G.2.3.2.1.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR of the SSB in set q~0~ in the active cell to
emulate SSB based beam failure. Figure G.2.3.2.1.1-1 additionally shows the
variation of the downlink L1-RSRP of the SSB in set q~1~ of the candidate beam
used for link recovery. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT
shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured for
periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. The IAB-MT is
configured to perform inter-frequency measurements using GP ID #0 (40ms) in
test 1.

##### G.2.3.2.1.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.2.1.2-test-requirements .H6}
The IAB-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall be as
follows:
During the time duration T1 and T2, the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell 1.
During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall transmit
uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission
according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell 1.
During T3 the IAB-MT shall detect beam failure and initiate link recovery.
During T4 and T5 the IAB-MT measures and evaluate beam candidate from beam
candidate set q~1~.
No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 120+10 ms after the
start of T5, the IAB-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam associated with the
candidate beam set q~1~. The IAB-MT shall not transmit preamble on a beam
associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time point B.

transmission from the IAB-MT. The rate of correct events observed during
repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
##### G.2.3.2.2 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR2 PCell
configured with SSB-based BFD and LR
##### G.2.3.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.2.2.1-test-purpose-and-
environment .H6}
The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects SSB-
based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell and that the
IAB-MT performs correct SSB-based link recovery based on beam candidate set
q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for beam failure
detection within the IAB-MT active DL BWP, during the evaluation period, and
link recovery, when no DRX is used. This test will partly verify the SSB based
beam failure detection and link recovery for an FR2 serving cell requirements
in clause 12.3.2.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.2.1-1, G.2.3.2.2.1-2 and
G.2.3.2.2.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active cell, in
the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure G.2.3.2.X.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR of the SSB in set q~0~ in the active cell to
emulate SSB based beam failure. Figure G.2.3.2.2.1-1 additionally shows the
variation of the downlink L1-RSRP of the SSB in set q~1~ of the candidate beam
used for link recovery. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT
shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured for
periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. In the test, DRX
configuration is not enabled.

##### G.2.3.2.2.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.2.2.2-test-requirements .H6}
The IAB-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall be as
follows:
During the time duration T1 and T2, the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell 1.
During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall transmit
uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission
according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell 1.
During T3 the IAB-MT shall detect beam failure and initiate link recovery.
During T4 and T5 the IAB-MT measures and evaluate beam candidate from beam
candidate set q~1~.
No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 560+650 ms after the
start of T5, the IAB-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam associated with the
candidate beam set q~1~. The IAB-MT shall not transmit preamble on a beam
associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time point B.
Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial preamble
transmission from the IAB-MT. The rate of correct events observed during
repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
##### G.2.3.2.3 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR1 PCell
configured with CSI-RS-based BFD and LR
##### G.2.3.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.2.3.1-test-purpose-and-
environment .H6}
The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects CSI-RS-
based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell and that the
IAB-MT performs correct CSI-RS-based link recovery based on beam candicate set
q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for beam failure
detection within the IAB-MTs active DL BWP, during the evaluation period, and
link recovery. This test will partly verify the CSI-RS based beam failure
detection and link recovery for an FR1 serving cell requirements in clause
12.3.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.3.1-1, G.2.3.2.3.1-2 and
G.2.3.2.3.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active cell, in
the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure G.2.3.2.3.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR of the CSI-RS in set q~0~ in the active cell to
emulate CSI-RS based beam failure. Figure G.2.3.2.3.1-1 additionally shows the
variation of the downlink L1-RSRP of the CSI-RS in set q~1~ of the candidate
beam used for link recovery. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the
IAB-MT shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured
for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of [2] ms.

##### G.2.3.2.3.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.2.3.2-test-requirements .H6}
The IAB-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall be as
follows:
During the time duration T1 and T2, the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell 1.
During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall transmit
uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission
according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell 1.
During T3 the shall detect beam failure and initiat link recovery. During T4
and T5 the IAB-MT measures and evaluate beam candidate from beam candidate set
q~1~.
No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 30+10 ms after the
start of T5, the IAB-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam associated with the
candidate beam set q~1~. The IAB-MT shall not transmit preamble on a beam
associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time point B.
Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial preamble
transmission from the IAB-MT. The rate of correct events observed during
repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
##### G.2.3.2.4 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR2 PCell
configured with CSI-RS-based BFD and LR in non-DRX mode
##### G.2.3.2.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.2.4.1-test-purpose-and-
environment .H6}
The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects CSI-RS-
based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell and that the
IAB-MT performs correct CSI-RS-based link recovery based on beam candicate set
q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for beam failure
detection within the IAB-MT's active DL BWP, during the evaluation period, and
link recovery, when no DRX is used. This test will partly verify the CSI-RS
based beam failure detection and link recovery for an FR2 serving cell
requirements in clause 12.3.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.4.1-1, G.2.3.2.4.1-2, and
G.2.3.2.4.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active cell, in
the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure G.2.3.2.4.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR of the CSI-RS in set q~0~ in the active cell to
emulate CSI-RS based beam failure. Figure G.2.3.2.4.1-1 additionally shows the
variation of the downlink L1-RSRP of the CSI-RS in set q~1~ of the candidate
beam used for link recovery. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the
IAB-MT shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured
for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of [2] ms. In the
test, DRX configuration is not enabled.

###### ## Annex I (normative): Propagation conditions
## I.1 Static propagation condition
The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist for this
propagation model.

## I.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
### I.2.1 General
The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:
> \- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized by
> a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile can be
> further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum delay
> spanned by the taps.
>
> \- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay profile
> and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical spectrum shape
> and a maximum Doppler frequency.
>
> \- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25
> GHz -- 52.6 GHz).
### I.2.2 Delay profiles
#### I.2.2.1 General
The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 [27] TDL models. The
simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps are only
used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay profiles
specified in I.2.2.1 can be used as such.
\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 [27].
\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.
\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 [27].
\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is done
simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the delay
resolution.
\- Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge them by
calculating their linear power sum.
\- Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge the
taps as follows:
\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered):
> \- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the weakest,
> select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.
\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows:
\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of the
weakest tap and the second delay tap.
\- Remove the second delay tap.
\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows:
\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.
\- Remove the second-to-last tap.
\- Otherwise:
\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has the
smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.
\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the weakest tap
and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.
\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.
\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference for
merging.
\- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power of the
weakest tap and the selected tap.
\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged tap is
the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.
\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap is
the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.
\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average delay of
the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on the sampling
grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay. Otherwise, the
location of the merged tap is rounded towards the direction of the selected
tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns 20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or
equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher power). The weakest tap and the
selected tap are removed.
\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.
\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB -8.8 dB)
\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap merge,
adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the power of the
last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.
\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.
Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification steps
may differ from the values in tables I.2.2.2-2, I.2.2.2-3, and I.2.1.1-4 for
the corresponding model.
Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the linear
domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the linear domain.
#### I.2.2.2 Delay profiles for FR1
The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low, medium
and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters are
specified in I.2.2.2-1 and the tapped delay line models are specified in
tables I.2.2.2-2 \~ table I.2.2.2-4.

**Low correlation** **Medium correlation** **High correlation**
* * *
α β α β α β 0 0 0.9 0.3 0.9 0.9
The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are defined in
table I.2.4.2.3-2, I.2.4.2.3-3 and I.2.4.2.3-4 as below.
The values in table I.2.4.2.3-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4 high
correlation cases to ensure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite
after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using the equation:
{width="2.0in" height="0.2798611111111111in"}
Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value is used
to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high correlation case,
a = 0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a = 0.00012.
The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in table
I.2.4.2.3-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite after
round-off to 4 digit precision with a = 0.00012.

#### I.2.4.3 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas
##### I.2.4.3.1 General
The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex I.2.4.3 apply to two
cases as presented below:
\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized antennas
used at IAB-DU/gNB
\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at IAB-MT/UE
The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization slant
angles are deployed at IAB. For one TX antenna case, antenna element with +90
degree polarization slant angle is deployed at IAB-MT/UE. For multiple TX
antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0 degrees
polarization slant angles are deployed at IAB-MT/UE.
For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for the
other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number of TX or
RX antennas.
##### I.2.4.3.2 Definition of MIMO correlation matrices using cross polarized
antennas
For the channel spatial correlation matrix, the following is used:
{width="1.9277777777777778in" height="0.21597222222222223in"}
Where
\- {width="0.30416666666666664in" height="0.2in"} is the spatial correlation
matrix at the UE (IAB-DU requirements) or IAB-MT (IAB-MT requirements) with
same polarization,
\- {width="0.42430555555555555in" height="0.2798611111111111in"} is the

## I.3 Physical signals, channels mapping and precoding
### I.3.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the transmission on antenna port(s) $p = p_{0},\
p_{0} + 1,...,\ p_{0} + N_{p} - 1$ is defined by using a precoder matrix of
size $N_{\text{ANT}} \times N_{p}$, where $N_{\text{ANT}}\ $is the number of
physical transmit antenna elements configured per test , $N_{p}$ is the number
of ports for a reference signal or physical channel configured per test, and
$p_{0}$ is the first port for that reference signal or physical channel as
defined in clauses 7.3 and 7.4 in TS 38.211 [8]. This precoder takes as an
input a block of signals for antenna port(s) $p = p_{0},p_{0} + 1,...,p_{0} +
N_{p} - 1$, $y^{\left( p \right)}\left( i \right) = \left\lbrack y^{\left(
p_{0} \right)}\left( i \right)\text{\ \ }y^{\left( p_{0} + 1 \right)}\left( i
\right)\ \ldots\ \ \ y^{\left( p_{0} + N_{p} - 1 \right)}\left( i \right)
\right\rbrack^{T}$, , with being the number of modulation symbols per antenna
port including the reference signal symbols, and generates a block of signals
$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = \left\lbrack
y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( 0 \right)}\left( i \right)\text{\ \
}y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( 1 \right)}\left( i \right)\ \ldots\ \ \
y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( N_{\text{ANT}} - 1 \right)}\left( i \right)
\right\rbrack^{T}$ the elements of which are to be mapped onto the frequency-
time index pair as per the test configuration but transmitted on different
physical antenna elements:
$$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = W\left( i
\right)y^{\left( p \right)}(i)$$
For Clause 8.2.3 and 11.2.3, the transmission of PDCCH and PDCCH DMRS on
antenna port $p = p_{0}$ is defined by using a precoder matrix of size 2x1.
This precoder takes as an input a block of signals for antenna port(s) $p =
p_{0}$, $y^{\left( p \right)}\left( i \right) = y^{\left( p_{0} \right)}\left(
i \right)$ and generates a block of signals $y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q
\right)}\left( i \right) = \left\lbrack y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( 0 \right)}\left(
i \right)\text{\ \ }y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( \frac{N_{\text{ANT}}}{2}
\right)}\left( i \right) \right\rbrack^{T}$ the elements of which are to be
mapped onto the frequency-time index pair as per the test configuration but
transmitted on different physical antenna elements:
$$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = W\left( i
\right)y^{\left( p \right)}(i)$$
The precoder matrix is specific to the test case configuration. is defined in
Clause 5.2.2.2 of TS 38.214 [11].
The transimison on PT-RS antenna port is associated (using same precoder) with
the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port among the DM-RS antenna ports assigned
for the PDSCH.
The physical antenna elements are identified by indices, where is the number
of physical antenna elements configured per test.
Modulation symbols $y^{\left( p \right)}(i)$ with $p \in \left{ 4000 \right}$
(i.e. PSS, SSS, PBCH and DM-RS for PBCH) are directly mapped to first physical
antenna element.
_Modulation symbols for CSI-RS resources which configured for tracking with
one port_ are directly mapped to first physical antenna element.
_Modulation symbols for CSI-RS resources which configured for beam refinement
with one port_ are directly mapped to first physical antenna element.
_Modulation symbols for NZP CSI-RS which configured for CSI acquisition with_
are _mapped to the physical antenna index_ where is the number of NZP CSI-RS
ports configured per test.
