# 1 Scope
The objective of this study is to define the over the air (OTA) testing
methodology for UE RF, UE RRM, and UE demodulation requirements for New Radio,
the associated measurement uncertainty budget(s), and the related test
tolerances.
The testing methodology development targets frequencies in FR2, and the work
is prioritized according to the frequency ranges that are included in the NR
work item.
For mmWave NR UEs, RF requirements are specified as OTA requirements, using
the applicable metrics. The definitions of these requirements are expected to
align the spatial coverage of the requirement with the UE\'s working condition
acceptable in expected directions. NR is expected to be used in more than one
type of UEs, and different spatial coverage requirements may apply to
different UE types.

## 4.1 Device types and UE power classes
In accordance to the study item objectives the following device types are
considered in the scope of this study:
\- Smartphone
\- Laptop mounted equipment (such as plug-in devices like USB dongles)
\- Laptop embedded equipment
\- Tablet
\- Wearable devices
\- Vehicular mounted device
\- Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) terminal
\- Fixed mounted devices (e.g. sensors, automation etc.)
\- Other UE types are not precluded for discussion as a second priority
\- The development of test methodology aspects shall initially focus on the
FWA, tablet, and smart phone device types
Four different FR2 UE Power Classes are defined in the Rel-15 scope in TS
38.101-2 [16]. Different UE power classes are characterized by different UE
antenna design assumptions and have different UE maximum output power and
reference sensitivity requirements.
The test methods defined in this document are introduced for handheld UEs and
applicable to FR2 UE Power Class 3 unless otherwise stated. The test methods
can be applicable for other device types such as FWA, tablets, vehicle mounted
UE etc. in case they comply with UE power class 3 requirements.
The test methods can be further extended to other FR2 UE power classes (i.e.
UE power classes 1, 2 and 4). At least the following test methods components
are specific to different FR2 UE power classes and shall be adjusted:
\- Measurement grids used for the UE RF Tx and Rx measurements.
\- Noise power level (Noc) and feasible SNR range for UE demodulation and RRM
test methodologies.
## 4.2 Testing configuration
The free space (FS) testing configuration is utilized in this study.
## 4.3 Test interface
A Test Interface (TI) is needed for certain control and measurement functions.
Detailed functions and implementation of the TI are as follows:
\- All UEs supporting NR and operating in frequency range 2 (FR2) shall
support the following:
\- A mandatory UE beam lock function (UBF) to simplify the test method
complexity, such that
\- The UBF can disable changes to the UE beamforming configuration when in
NR_RRC_CONNECTED state
\- The measurement and reporting of synchronization signals reference signal
received power per branch (SS-RSRPB) [14], such that
\- These reporting requirements apply to all FR2 UEs in the context of a test
loop
\- The signalling associated with reporting SS-RSRPB is in a format which
allows the UE to report a vector of values, where the number of the reported
values equals to the number of receiver branches on the UE
\- Additional TI functionality is not precluded

test to prove equivalence.
> 1) Multiple test methods may exist for each requirement.
>
> 2) Each test method will require its own test procedure.
>
> 3) A single conformance requirement applies for each core requirement,
> regardless of test procedure.
>

> budget) is established.
>
> 8) Establish budget format examples for each addressed test method in the
> form of lists of uncertainty contributions. Contributions that may be
> negligible with some DUT and substantial with others should be in this list.
> For each combination of measurement method and test parameter develop a list
> with measurement uncertainties.
>
> 9) Describe potential OTA test methods. The description requires information
> about the test range architecture and test procedure. Addressing each item
> in each uncertainty budget with respect to the expected distribution of the
> errors, the mechanism creating the error and how it interacts with
> properties of the DUT.
>
> 10) Providing example uncertainty budgets in the TR will be useful in order
> to demonstrate the way a budget should be defined and how calculating its
> resulting measurement uncertainty is done, but the figures used in the
> examples will clearly be only examples and not applicable in general.
>
> 11) Each test method is required to provide technical documentation showing

# 5 UE RF testing methodology
## 5.1 General
It is reasonable to expect a high level of integration of high-frequency NR
devices (e.g., devices operating in FR2). Such highly integrated architectures
may feature innovative front-end solutions, multi-element antenna arrays,
passive and active feeding networks, etc. that may not be able to physically
expose a front-end cable connector to the test equipment.
For UE RF test methodology in FR2, the following general aspects apply:
\- OTA measurement is the testing methodology for UE RF in FR2
\- Permitted test methods are defined in clause 5.2 and shall demonstrate
equivalence to the far field environment.
## 5.2 Permitted test methods
A permitted test method meets the equivalence criteria to the far field
environment by having an MU less than or equal to the threshold MU for at
least one test case. The applicability of methods is described in clause 5.3.
### 5.2.1 Direct far field (DFF)
#### 5.2.1.1 Description
The DFF measurement setup of UE RF characteristics in FR2 is capable of centre
and off centre of beam measurements and is shown in Figure 5.2.1.1-1 below.
{width="3.0in" height="2.2847222222222223in"}
Figure 5.2.1.1-1: DFF measurement setup of UE RF characteristics
The key aspects of the DFF setup are:
\- Far-field measurement system in an anechoic chamber
\- The criterion for determining the far-field distance is described in
5.2.1.2
\- A positioning system such that the angle between the dual-polarized
measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of freedom and maintains
a polarization reference.
\- A positioning system such that the angle between the link antenna and the
DUT has at least two axes of freedom and maintains a polarization reference;
this positioning system for the link antenna is in addition to the positioning
system for the measurement antenna and provides for an angular relationship
independently controllable from the measurement antenna.
\- **For setups intended for measurements of UE RF characteristics in non-
standalone (NSA) mode with 1 UL configuration, an LTE link antenna is used to
provide the LTE link to the DUT.** The LTE link antenna provides a stable LTE
signal without precise path loss or polarization control.
\- **For setups intended for measurements in NR CA mode with FR1 and FR2
inter-band NR CA, test setup provides NR FR1 link to the DUT.** The NR FR1
link has a stable and noise-free signal without precise path loss or
polarization control.
The applicability criteria of the DFF setup are:
\- The DUT radiating aperture is D ≤ 5 cm
\- Either a single radiating aperture, multiple non-coherent apertures or
multiple coherent apertures DUTs can be tested
\- If multiple antenna panels that are phase coherent are defined as a single
array, the criterion on DUT radiating aperture applies to this single array
\- D is based on the MU assessment in Annex B.1.1.3
\- The measurement distance larger than the far-field criteria defined in
clause 5.2.1.2 is not precluded
\- If the uncertainties can be further optimized, the MU may be reduced or D
may be increased
\- A manufacturer declaration on the following elements is needed:
\- Manufacturer declares antenna array size
\- EIRP, TRP, EIS, EVM, spurious emissions and blocking metrics can be tested.
#### 5.2.1.2 Far-field criteria
The minimum far-field distance R for a traditional far field anechoic chamber
can be calculated based on the following equation: , where D is the diameter
of the smallest sphere that encloses the radiating parts of the DUT. The
near/far field boundary for different antenna sizes and frequencies is shown
in Table 5.2.1.2-1.
Table 5.2.1.2-1: Near field/far field boundary for different frequencies and
antenna sizes for a traditional far field anechoic chamber

As can be seen in the table, the distance can be very large for larger antenna
sizes and higher frequencies. This could lead to very large chambers that
would be prohibitively expensive.
Generally, the exact antenna size of the DUT is unknown since the device will
be in its own casing during the test and this also depends on other factors
such as ground coupling effects that depend on the design. The largest device
size (e.g. diagonal) could be used; however, this would lead to very large
chambers even for relatively small devices. A practical way to determine the
far field distance is needed.
It has been proposed to determine the testing distance based on a manufacturer
declaration. One of the risks of this approach is that a distance shorter than
the actual far field is chose. It should be further studied whether this could
lead to underperforming devices passing the tests due to measurement
inaccuracies (e.g. whether a shorter distance will lead to better measurement
results than the actual far field distance).
Additionally, an experimental method was proposed to determine the far field
distance based on path loss measurements. This method is based on the fact
that the path loss exponent is different in the near field and the far field.
By measuring the path loss gradient over a certain distance, the near/far
field boundary could be found. The results of an experiment conducted on a
Band 3 LTE device are shown in Figure 5.2.1.2-1. The minimum far field
distance can be found at the regression intercept point.
{width="4.0in" height="2.6041666666666665in"}
Figure 5.2.1.2-1: LTE UE FDD band 3 measurements to determine the minimum far-
field distance
The figure shows an example result for the case where the frequency is 1.85
GHz. The approximate device dimensions were 13 x 8 cm. Under these conditions,
the canonical minimum far-field distance would be 28.7 cm. According to this
method, the minimum measurement distance would be 13.8 cm. Further work is
required to determine whether this technique provides valid results for much
higher frequencies and general device types.
Methods to reduce measurement distance for AAS BS are Compact Antenna Test
Range, One Dimensional Compact Range, and Near Field Test Range which are all
listed in TR 37.842 [9]. These may be used for NR provided they meet the
equivalence criteria relative to the baseline measurement setup. Other methods
are not precluded.
The minimum range length of a DFF system, i.e., the minimum distance between
the centre of the quiet zone and the measurement antenna, needs to take into
account the unknown offset of the antenna aperture from the centre of quiet
zone in order to guarantee far-field conditions for any antenna array
integrated inside the DUT. The distance between the centre of the quiet zone
to the measurement antenna is referenced as R~DFF~, while the radius of the
quiet zone is R~QZ~ as illustrated in Figure 5.2.1.2-2. The minimum distance
between the antenna array integrated anywhere within the DUT and the
measurement antenna needs to meet the far-field distance, R~FF~ = 2D^2^/λ.

Figure 5.2.1.2-2: Illustration of DFF System for range length definition
The setup in Figure 5.2.1.2-3 is used to derive the minimum range length for
NR FR2 DFF systems where the sphere enclosing the DUT matches the QZ and the
DUT antenna with radiating aperture diameter D located in the corner of the
DUT. With this setup, the minimum range length, R~DFF~, can be determined as
R~DFF~ = R~QZ~ -- D/2 + R~FF~ = R~QZ~ -- D/2 + 2D^2^/λ
which is tabulated in Table 5.2.1.2-1 for two different QZ sizes assuming
D=5cm.

#### 5.2.1.3 Testing and calibration aspects
##### 5.2.1.3.1 Calibration Measurement Procedure
The calibration measurement is done by using a reference calibration antenna
with known gain values. For the calibration measurement, the reference antenna
is placed in the centre of the quiet zone. If an antenna with moving phase
centre is used, a multi-segmented approach could be chosen where for multiple
frequency segments the respective phase centre of the calibration antenna is
placed in the centre of quiet zone. The calibration process determines the
composite loss, L~path,pol~, of the entire transmission and receiver chain
path gains (measurement antenna, amplification) and losses (switches,
combiners, cables, path loss, etc.). The calibration measurement is repeated
for each measurement path (two orthogonal polarizations and each signal path).
Additional details of the calibration procedure are outlined in [13].
##### 5.2.1.3.2 Peak EIRP Measurement Procedure
The TX beam peak direction is where the maximum total component of EIRP is
found, including the respective polarization of the measurement antenna used
to form the TX beam, according to 5.2.1.3.7.
The measurement procedure includes the following steps:
1) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables C.2-1
through C.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.
2) If the re-positioning concept is not applied to the TX test cases, position
the device in DUT Orientation 1. If the re-positioning concept is applied to
the TX test cases,
a) position the device in DUT Orientation 1 from Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 if
the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular range 0^o^≤ θ ≤90^o^
for the alignment option selected in step 1;
b) position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) from
Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith
angular range 90^o^\ 1) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables C.2-1
> through C.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.
>
> 2) If the re-positioning concept is not applied to the TX test cases,
> position the device in DUT Orientation 1. If the re-positioning concept is
> applied to the TX test cases,
a) position the device in DUT Orientation 1 from Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 if
the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular range 0^o^≤ θ ≤90^o^
for the alignment option selected in step 1.
b) position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) from
Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith
angular range 90^o^\ 10) Calculate the resulting averaged EIS as:
EIS = 2*[1/EIS(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~=θ) +1/EIS(Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~=φ)]^-1^
The RX beam peak direction is where the minimum EIS is found.
The EIS results from the RX beam peak search using the minimum number of grid
points as described in Annex G.2 can be re-used for EIS spherical coverage. In
case a **coarse beam peak grid is used for RX beam peak search with an EIS
metric, using the minimum number of grid points defined in Annex G.3.3.2.3,
the EIS results can be re-used for EIS spherical coverage.** In case a
separate test is performed for spherical coverage, the procedure above should
be followed using the minimum number of grid points defined in Annex G.3.3.2.3
for spherical coverage.
The EIS~target-CDF~ is then obtained from the Cumulative Distribution Function
(CDF) computed using total EIS for all grid points. When using constant step
size measurement grids, a theta-dependent correction shall be applied, i.e.,
the PDF probability contribution for each measurement point is scaled by
sin(θ).
##### 5.2.1.3.9 Beam Correspondence Tolerance
The beam correspondence requirement is fulfilled if the DUT satisfies one of
the following conditions, depending on the beam correspondence capability, as
defined in TS38.306 [19]:
\- If [bit-1], the DUT shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement and
spherical coverage requirement with its autonomously chosen UL beams and
without uplink beam sweeping. Such a DUT is considered to have met the beam
correspondence tolerance requirement.
\- If [bit-0], the DUT shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement and
spherical coverage requirement with uplink beam sweeping. Such a DUT shall
meet the beam correspondence tolerance requirement and shall support uplink
beam management, as defined in TS 38.306 [19].
Thus, the beam correspondence tolerance test is only applicable to the DUT
that has beam correspondence capability as [bit-0] (which shall match OEM
declaration), such that DUT relies on uplink beam sweeping to fulfil the
minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirements.
ΔEIRP~BC~ is introduced for beam correspondence tolerance based on two EIRP
measurements (EIRP~1~ and EIRP~2~). EIRP~1~ is the measured total EIRP based
on the beam which DUT chooses autonomously (corresponding beam) to transmit in
the direction of the incoming DL signal, which is based on beam correspondence
without relying on UL beam sweeping. EIRP~2~ is the measured total EIRP based
on the beam yielding highest EIRP in a given direction, which is based on beam
correspondence with relying on UL beam sweeping. ΔEIRP~BC~ shall be calculated
over the link angles spanning a subset of the spherical coverage grid points
which are corresponding to the top N^th^ percentile of the EIRP~2~ measurement
points in the grid, where the value of N is according to EIRP spherical
coverage requirement of DUT's power class defined in TS 38.101-2 [16] clause
6.2.1, e.g., N=50 for power class 3 DUT.
For each of the points in the grid:
1) Follow the test procedures specified in clause 5.2.1.3.7 with uplink beam
sweeping disabled, obtain total EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=θ) and total
EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=φ). EIRP~1~ is calculated by EIRP~1~ =
maximum(EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=θ), EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=φ)).
2) Follow the test procedures specified in clause 5.2.1.3.7, with uplink beam
sweeping enabled (SS does not configure the _spatialRelationInfo_ to DUT)
during DUT TX beam refinement, obtain total EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=θ) and total
EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=φ). EIRP~2~ is calculated by EIRP~2~ =
maximum(EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=θ), EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=φ)).
3) Calculate the ΔEIRP~BC~ = EIRP~2~ -- EIRP~1~.
The ΔEIRP~target-CDF~ is then obtained from the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) computed using ΔEIRP~BC~ for each of all top N^th^ percentile
of the EIRP~2~ measurement points in the grid. When using constant step size
measurement grids, a theta-dependent correction shall be applied, i.e., the
PDF probability contribution for each measurement point is scaled by sin(θ).
_Editor's Note: The side conditions for downlink reference signals SSB and
CSI-RS in beam correspondence tolerance test are FFS._
### 5.2.2 Direct far field (DFF) setup simplification for centre of beam
measurements
#### 5.2.2.1 Description
The DFF setup in 5.2.1 can be simplified in the following way to perform
centre of the beam measurements:
\- The measurement and the link antenna can be combined so that the single
antenna is used to steer the beam and to perform UE RF measurements.
The measurement setup of UE RF characteristics in FR2 capable of centre of
beam measurements is shown in Figure 5.2.1.1-1 below.

measurements are defined in 5.2.1.2.

(CATR). Refer to Annex E for additional information.

\- Indirect Far field of Compact Antenna Test Range as the one used in [9]
with quiet zone diameter at least D.
\- A positioning system such that the angle between the dual-polarized
measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of freedom and maintains
a polarization reference.
\- Before performing the UBF, the measurement probe acts as a link antenna
maintaining polarization reference with respect to the DUT. Once the beam is
locked then the link is to be passed to the link antenna which maintains
reliable signal level with respect to the DUT.
\- For setups intended for measurements of UE RF characteristics in non-
standalone (NSA) mode with 1UL configuration, an LTE link antenna is used to
provide the LTE link to the DUT. The LTE link antenna provides a stable LTE
signal without precise path loss or polarization control.
\- **For setups intended for measurements in NR CA mode with FR1 and FR2
inter-band NR CA, test setup provides NR FR1 link to the DUT.** The NR FR1
link has a stable and noise-free signal without precise path loss or
polarization control.
The applicability criteria of this test method are:
\- The total test volume is a cylinder with diameter d and height h.
\- DUT must fit within the total test volume for the entire duration of the
test.
\- Either a single radiating aperture, multiple non-coherent apertures or
multiple coherent apertures DUTs can be tested.
\- EIRP, TRP, EIS, EVM, spurious emissions and blocking metrics can be tested.
\- No manufacturer declaration is needed.
#### 5.2.3.2 Far-field criteria
The CATR system does not require a measurement distance of to achieve a plane
wave as in a standard far field range.
The Table 5.2.3.2-1 and Table 5.2.3.2-2 below show the paths losses which can
be expected for the CATR compared to a Fraunhofer limit distance ().

CATR specific implementation
For CATR, the FF distance is seen as the focal length, distance between the
feed and reflector for a CATR, which can be calculated as shown below (as a
rule of thumb although it can vary depending on system implementation):
\- D =x [m]
\- size of reflector = 2*D
\- R = focal length = 3.5*size of reflector = 3.5*(2*D)
In a CATR, from the reflector to the quiet zone, there is a plane wave with no
space loss.
For both direct FF and CATR, free space path loss is calculated by applying
the Free Space Loss formula with R = FF distance:

#### 5.2.3.3 Testing and calibration aspects
##### 5.2.3.3.1 Calibration Measurement Procedure
The calibration measurement is done by using a reference antenna (SGH used in
Figure 5.2.3.3.1-1) with known efficiency or gain values. In the calibration
measurement the reference antenna is measured in the same place as the DUT,
and the attenuation of the complete transmission path (C↔A, as in Figure
5.2.3.3.1-1) from the DUT to the measurement receiver (EIRP), and from the RF
source to DUT (EIS) is calibrated out. Figure 5.2.3.3.1-1 presents a setup of
a typical compact antenna test range for EIRP calibration:
{width="6.0in" height="5.020833333333333in"}

##### 5.2.3.3.2 Peak EIRP Measurement Procedure
The TX beam peak direction is where the maximum total component of EIRP is
found, including the respective polarization of the measurement antenna used
to form the TX beam, according to 5.2.1.3.7.
1) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables C.2-1
through C.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.
2) If the re-positioning concept is not applied to the TX test cases, position
the device in DUT Orientation 1. If the re-positioning concept is applied to
the TX test cases,
a) position the device in DUT Orientation 1 from Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 if
the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular range 0^o^≤ θ ≤90^o^
for the alignment option selected in step 1.
b) position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) from
Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith
angular range 90^o^\ 5 cm.
A permitted test method will have applicability to at least one test case.
Applicability is a function of DUT Antenna Configuration as defined in Table
5.3-1 DUT Antenna Configuration can be chosen by an optional declaration from
a manufacturer.

The detailed applicability of any test method for any test will be a function
of DUT Antenna Configuration, D, the actual testing distance and the resulting
calculated MU. If the calculated MU is lower than the threshold MU, then that
test method is applicable to the test.
# 6 UE RRM testing methodology
## 6.1 General
Testability aspects of the UE have been considered. Unless otherwise indicated
below, device under test (DUT) refers to UE nodes. The exact list of RRM tests
for UE can only be determined once the core requirements are settled.
For frequency bands in FR2 (e.g. mm-wave), conducted antenna connectors are
assumed not to be available at DUT and the OTA testing is considered as the
baseline approach for NR UE RRM testing methodology.
The possibility of performing conducted tests using an intermediate frequency
(IF) were evaluated. It was decided that this approach would be challenging to
standardise for various reasons since IF is an internal interface in the DUT
and using a standardised IF (signal level, number of IF ports, IF frequency
etc.) would preclude many different DUT implementations including direct
conversion receivers. In addition, IF testing excludes all components which
operate at the radio frequency such as RF filters, duplexers, transmit receive
switch, low noise amplifier (LNA), power amplifier (PA), analogue beamforming
phase shifting elements etc., and the algorithms which control such components
from the test.
Further details of a suitable OTA test environment are to be discussed in the
work item, and may have impact to the core requirements which are defined. For
example, side conditions for the applicability of core requirements should be
defined in a way in which they can be ensured in an OTA environment.
## 6.2 Measurement setup
### 6.2.1 Baseline setup
#### 6.2.1.1 Description
The baseline measurement setup of UE RRM characteristics for frequency bands
in FR2 is capable of establishing an OTA link between the DUT and a number of
emulated gNB sources as shown in Figure 6.2.1.1-1.
{width="3.7444444444444445in" height="3.7020833333333334in"}
Figure 6.2.1.1-1: Baseline measurement setup of RRM characteristics
The absolute position of the probes is left up to implementation. The relative
angular relationship between two AoAs can be achieved using any combination of
probes. The relative orientation of the coordinate system is defined with
respect to one probe, referred to as the reference probe P0 along which the
z-axis is defined. The test conditions in Annex C.2 and the positioning
guidelines in C.3 apply to the RRM baseline setup. The quality of quiet zone
validation defined in Annex D only needs to be performed with the reference
probe P0 and only to assess the single-directional EIRP and EIS metrics.
The UE RRM baseline measurement setup shall fulfil the following capabilities:
\- The following permitted test setups are considered for OTA RRM testing:
\- DFF test setup as described in Clause 5.
\- Simplified DFF test setup as described in Clause 5.
\- IFF test setup as described in Clause 5.
\- TRxPs and Cells:
\- Up to 2 NR transmission reception points TRxPs are emulated.
\- Support of interworking scenarios
\- For test scenarios involving both, LTE and NR FR2 carriers, the test setup
shall be capable to provide LTE link to the DUT. The emulated LTE cell
provides a stable LTE signal without precise propagation modelling or path
loss control between it and the DUT. No performance verification for and
relative to LTE carriers is supported.
\- For test scenarios involving both, NR FR1 and NR FR2 carriers, the test
setup shall be capable to provide NR FR1 link to the DUT. The NR FR1 link has
a stable and noise-free signal without precise path loss or polarization
control. No performance verification for and relative to NR FR1 carriers is
supported.
\- Antennas, polarization, simultaneously active AoAs:
\- N dual-polarized antennas transmitting the signals from the emulated gNB
sources to the DUT.
\- The antennas transmit into the test zone in such a way that signal
polarization does not prevent the DUT receiving a consistent, predictable
power level.
\- N ≥ N~MAX_AoAs~, where N~MAX_AoAs~ is the maximum number of simultaneously
active (emulating signal) angles of arrival AoAs.
\- For the scope of Rel-15 testing N~MAX_AoAs~ = 2.
\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on DFF, the supported
N~MAX_AoAs~ = 2.
\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on simplified DFF, the
supported N~MAX_AoAs~ = 1.
\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on IFF, the supported
N~MAX_AoAs~ = 1.
\- Angular Relationship:
\- A positioning system such that an angular relationship with two axes of
freedom is provided between the DUT and the test system antennas (or the setup
should provide equivalent functionality).
\- For N~MAX_AoAs~ = 2 the setup shall enable following relative angular
relationships between the N~MAX_AoAs~ simultaneously active AoAs: 30°, 60°,
90°, 120° and 150°.
\- For single active probe scenarios, in case that step change of AoA is
required, the setup shall enable following relative angular change between
initial and target AoA: 30°, 60°, 90°, 120° and 150°.
\- Wanted and noise (AWGN) signals can be transmitted from one or both active
probes. Test description will define the exact signal/noise/SNR/SINR level per
TRxP at the reference point.
\- Multiple DL transmission antenna ports:
\- In case of multiple DL transmission antenna ports are required for RRM
testing, the different antenna ports are mapped to different polarizations.
\- Propagation Conditions
\- Test method shall allow modelling of the following propagation conditions
between the DUT and the emulated gNB sources
\- Multi-path fading propagation conditions
\- Multi-path fading propagation conditions between the DUT and the emulated
gNB sources are modelled as Single probe channel models as described in clause
8.2.
\- The Single probe channel models for RRM testing adopts the same framework
of Demodulation. Detailed channel parameterization should be defined in the NR
WI performance part.
\- Static propagation conditions
\- Measurement Uncertainty:
\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on DFF, it is likely that the
measurement uncertainty budget for the RRM setup may contain additional
measurement uncertainty elements relative to the setup defined in clause
5.2.1. These have been defined in Annex B.2.1.
\- Applicability Criteria:
\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on DFF, the applicability
criteria defined for the DFF UE RF test method described in clause 5.2.1 can
be applied.
\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on simplified DFF, the
applicability criteria defined for the DFF UE RF test method described in
clause 5.2.2 can be applied.
\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on IFF, the applicability
criteria defined for the IFF UE RF test method described in clause 5.2.3 can
be applied.
Note: Using UE Demodulation baseline setup in clause 7.2 to perform selected
RRM metrics testing is not precluded. Feasibility and applicability of this
condition should be investigated in the NR WI performance part.
#### 6.2.1.2 Far-field criteria and Quiet Zone
For RRM baseline measurement setup based on DFF:
\- The Far-field criteria defined for the DFF UE RF test method described in
clause 5.2.1 can be applied.
\- A DFF measurement setup has the centre of the Quiet Zone (QZ) located at
the centre of the rotational axes (of DUT and measurement antenna). For the
RRM measurement baseline setup based on DFF, the vertices of the N probes have
to be aligned to the resulting centre of the QZ. The centre of the QZ is taken
as the reference point for MU definition for each probe. The same QZ size as
for DFF UE RF test method described in clause 5.2.1 applies.
For RRM baseline measurement setup based on simplified DFF:
\- The Far-field criteria defined for the simplified DFF UE RF test method
described in clause 5.2.2 can be applied.
\- The same QZ size and definition as for simplified DFF UE RF test method
described in clause 5.2.2 applies.
For RRM baseline measurement setup based on IFF:
\- The Far-field criteria defined for the IFF UE RF test method described in
clause 5.2.3 can be applied.
\- The Quiet Zone definition for the IFF UE RF test method described in clause
5.2.3 can be applied.
#### 6.2.1.3 Testing and calibration aspects
The calibration method defined for the DFF UE RF test method described in
clause 5.2.1 can be applied for UE RRM testing based on DFF [for each
probe/AoA]. The calibration method defined for the IFF test method described
in clause 5.2.3 can be applied for the UE RRM testing based on IFF. The
calibration method defined for the simplified DFF UE RF test method described
in clause 5.2.2 can be applied for UE RRM testing based on simplified DFF.
#### 6.2.1.4 Test parameters and metrics
##### 6.2.1.4.1 Test parameters and metrics required for UE RRM testing
The following test parameters and metrics need to be supported for UE RRM
testing.

\- Timing measurement of UL events caused by events on the DL
##### 6.2.1.4.2 Radiated requirements Reference point and Testing directions
For RRM baseline measurement setup based on DFF and IFF, the reference point
is located at the centre of the QZ. From the UE perspective the reference
point is the input of UE antenna array.
Calibration of power level and relative power level test parameters and RRM
metrics (at the required AoAs) is required and shall be provided by the test
system.
Appropriate timing and relative timing test parameters and RRM metrics (at the
required AoAs) shall be provided by the test system within declared
uncertainties.
The following Modes for useful signals (S) and noise signals (N) configuration
have been identified and can be supported by the NR RRM Test Methods:
\- Mode 1 (SNR emulation): Test system transmits useful signals (S) and noise
signals (N) to emulate target SNR condition.
\- Mode 2 (noise-free transmission): Test system transmits only useful signals
(S).
The test cases in core specification TS 38.133 [17] will be specified at the
reference point, according to the following principles:
\- Mode 1
\- Specify absolute Noc level at the Reference point per angle of arrival
(AoA)
\- Noc level may have different value according to operating band and UE power
class
\- Specify SNR at the Reference point per angle of arrival (AoA)
\- SNR is a test-specific value
\- The angle(s) of arrival (AoA(s)) will be specified in each test case.

Figure 6.2.1.4.2-1: DL SNR reference point for RRM testing methodology
The following Scenarios for RRM requirements have been identified and can be
supported by the NR RRM test methods:
\- Scenario 1: RRM requirement with single Angle of Arrival (1 AoA) with
signal coming from RX beam peak direction.
\- Scenario 2: RRM requirement with single Angle of Arrival (1 AoA) with
signal coming from RX non-beam peak direction.
\- The test can be performed in any single direction which is covered by N^th^
percentile EIS spherical coverage of the DUT
\- Value of N is according to FR2 UE power class, as defined in TS 38.101-2
[16] clause 7.3.4.
\- Scenario 3: RRM requirement with two Angle of Arrivals (2 AoAs).
\- Test directions:
\- Both signals come from the directions covered by the N% percentile EIS
spherical coverage of the DUT
\- The angle between two probes should match the relative probe spacing of 30,
60, 90, 120, 150 deg and UE is in the directions in which the UE RRM test
cases can be performed.
\- Value of N is according to FR2 UE power class, as defined in TS 38.101-2
[16] clause 7.3.4.
\- The following sub-cases are considered
\- Case 1: TDM transmissions from 2 probes (i.e. each probe transmits both
signal and/or artificial noise in TDM manner).
\- Case 2: Simultaneous transmission of signals from 2 probes
\- The details on how to control the SINR for Case 1 and Case 2 are provided
in Annex H.
Note: No conclusions on the feasibility of generating the testable side
conditions made for Case 2. The feasibility of generating the testable side
conditions for Case 2 can be further studied in the future releases.
The following Types of RRM requirements have been identified and can be
supported by the NR RRM test methods:
\- Type 1:
\- RRM requirements defined under the assumption that the UE is using \"Fine\"
UE RX beams.
\- \"Fine\" UE RX beams are the beams used by the UE to perform PDSCH
reception and used to define UE RF requirements (e.g. EIS, EIS spherical
coverage)
\- Type 2:
\- Requirements defined under the assumption that the UE is using \"Rough\" UE
RX beams.
\- \"Rough\" UE RX beams are the beams which the UE is using for RRM
measurements (e.g. for SSB measurements)
For selecting the testing direction (AoA to test the requirement) fulfilling
certain preconditions, two methods are feasible from the perspective of RRM
baseline measurement setup, as follows:
\- Method 1: Run a pretest in the RRM baseline measurement system to identify
all the directions (with a given spatial granularity) at which the UE fulfils
a given precondition (e.g. spherical coverage EIS). The testing directions are
then chosen out of the valid directions, following a given rule. The
precondition to be fulfilled, and the rule how to select the testing direction
out of the valid directions, are specified in the test description.
\- Method 2: For each given potential direction, test first a given
precondition (e.g. minimum TP for a given power), which validates the
direction as valid for testing or not. If the direction is valid, test the
requirement, if not, jump to the next potential direction following a given
rule. The rule how to select the potential directions and the precondition to
validate them as testing direction, are specified in the test description.
##### 6.2.1.4.3 Scenario 1 (1AoA RX beam peak) for Type 1 Requirements
(\"Fine\" RX beams) and Mode 1 Configuration (S+N)
Conditions chosen for conducted RRM Test cases assume that the noise
contribution of the UE front end is negligible. For over-the-air testing it is
not feasible in practice to use signal levels high enough to make the noise of
the UE front end negligible. A number of scenarios occur in the design of RRM
test cases:
a) One or more side conditions are deliberately set near a lower limit, for
example some RSRP reporting accuracy tests
b) A test is designed to check an event at a specific SNR, for example Radio
Link Monitoring
c) The SNR is not critical provided it is high enough for the test purpose
For test cases where the SNR seen by the UE at baseband is critical:
\- Set wanted noise to give a maximum of 1dB difference between Reference
point SNR and Baseband SNR, so SNR~RP~ - SNR~BB~ ≤ 1dB
_Figure 6.2.1.4.3-1 shows the principle for UE power class 3 in Band n260,
with an example SNR value._
_The Noc values are based on Refsens for the Operating band and on the UE
Power class, and taking a baseline of UE Power class 3 in Band n260._

_where:_
\- Refsens~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~ is the Refsens value in dBm specified for Power
Class 3 in Band n260 for 50MHz Channel bandwidth in TS 38.101-2 [16] Table
7.3.2.3-1, [dBm/Hz]
\- SCS~Refsens~ is a subcarrier spacing associated with N~RB~ for 50MHz in TS
38.101-2 [16] Table 5.3.2-1, chosen as 120kHz., [Hz]
\- PRBs~Refsens~ is N~RB~ associated with subcarrier spacing 120 kHz for 50MHz
in TS 38.101-2 [16] Table 5.3.2-1 and is 32.
\- 12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB
\- SNR~Refsens~ is the SNR used for simulation of Refsens, and is -1dB
\- ∆~thermal~ is the amount of dB that the wanted noise is set above UE
thermal noise, giving a rise in total noise of **∆~BB~**. ∆~thermal~ is chosen
as 6dB, giving a rise in total noise of 1dB**.**

**Figure 6.2.1.4.3-1: Reference point SNR~RP~ and Baseband SNR~BB~**
The following methodology to define the minimum Noc level for power class X
(PC_X) and operating band Y (Band_Y) is used for the single carrier case and a
single band device:
Noc(PC_X, Band_Y) = -155 dBm/Hz + Refsens~PC_X,\ Band_Y,\ 50MHz~ --
Refsens~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~
_where:_
\- _Refsens values are specified in TS 38.101-2_ [16] Tables 7.3.2.1-1,
7.3.2.2-1, 7.3.2.3-1 and 7.3.2.4-1 _._
_The Noc values derived by the above equations are the minimum that should be
used in an RRM test case to ensure that_ SNR~BB~ ≥ SNR~RP~ -1dB.
Depending on the test purpose, each RRM test case should decide whether to use
a band and/or UE power class dependent Noc value, or whether a single Noc
value is adequate.

\- Noc~SB~ is the Noc derived by assuming UE supports single band and defined
in clauses 6.2.1.4.3 - 6.2.1.4.7.

# 7 UE demodulation and CSI testing methodology
## 7.1 General
This clause describes the testing methodology for NR UE demodulation and CSI
reporting for FR2. Unless otherwise indicated below, device under test (DUT)
refers to UE nodes. The exact list of demodulation and CSI reporting tests for
the UE can only be determined once the core requirements are settled and the
test methodologies are considered in generic way to allow testing of typical
UE demodulation CSI metrics.
For frequency bands in FR2 (e.g. mm-wave), conducted antenna connectors are
assumed not to be available at DUT and the OTA testing is considered as the
baseline approach for NR UE demodulation and CSI test methodology.
The possibility of performing conducted tests using an intermediate frequency
(IF) were evaluated. It was decided that this approach would be challenging to
standardise for various reasons since IF is an internal interface in the DUT
and using a standardised IF (signal level, number of IF ports, IF frequency
etc.) would preclude many different DUT implementations including direct
conversion receivers. In addition, IF testing excludes all components which
operate at the radio frequency such as RF filters, duplexers, transmit receive
switch, low noise amplifier (LNA), power amplifier (PA), analogue beamforming
phase shifting elements etc., and the algorithms which control such components
from the test.
## 7.2 Measurement setup
### 7.2.1 Baseline setup
#### 7.2.1.1 Description
The baseline measurement setup of NR UE demodulation and CSI characteristics
for frequency bands in FR2 is capable of establishing an OTA link between the
DUT and a number of emulated gNB sources with one angle of arrival (AoA) to
the UE, and is shown in Figure 7.2.1.1-1 below.
{width="2.6041666666666665in" height="1.3402777777777777in"}
Figure 7.2.1.1-1: Baseline measurement setup for UE demodulation and CSI\
characteristics testing
The key aspects of the baseline setup are:
\- Test is conducted in an anechoic chamber
> \- The test shall be performed in the radiative near field or in the far
> field
>
> \- The minimum measurement distance is described in 7.2.1.2
\- The following permitted test setups are considered

>
> \- Simplified DFF test setup as described in Clause 5.
>
> \- IFF test setup as described in Clause 5.
>
> \- Direct near field (DNF) test setup.
>
> \- Note: No final conclusions on the feasibility of DNF setup were made.
\- One TRxP with a dual-polarized measurement antenna directed at the DUT
\- Propagation Conditions
> \- Test method shall allow modelling of the following propagation conditions
> between the DUT and the emulated gNB sources
>
> \- Multi-path fading propagation conditions
>
> \- Multi-path fading propagation conditions between the DUT and the emulated
> gNB sources are modelled as Single probe channel models as described in
> clause 8.2.
>
> \- Static propagation conditions
\- A positioning system such that the angle between the dual-polarized
measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of freedom
\- The test method shall achieve isolation between two nominally orthogonal
paths from the dual-polarised TRxP to the DUT, enabling independent control of
the signals reaching each baseband receiver
\- Test method supports up to DL MIMO rank 2 transmissions
\- DUTs shall support power measurement per receiver port (SS-RSRPB).
Measurement equipment may use SS-RSRPB reporting from the DUT to achieve
isolation and to enable independent control of the signals reaching each
baseband receiver.
\- SS-RSRPB measurements and reporting are done under noise-free conditions
and use static channel conditions.
\- Once established, the setup is expected to be fixed and to be used with UE
Tx/Rx beamlock to allow testing of DUT baseband features under a \"virtually
cabled\" scenario.
\- Baseline setup includes a capability to select the best UE RX beam during
initial call setup.
\- Support of **UE demodulation and CSI** requirements verification for
interworking scenarios
\- For setups intended for measurements of UE demodulation and CSI
characteristics in non-standalone (NSA) mode, an LTE link antenna is used to
provide the LTE link to the DUT. The LTE link antenna provides a stable and
noise-free LTE signal without precise path loss or polarization control. No
performance verification for LTE carriers is supported.
\- For setups intended for measurements of UE demodulation and CSI
characteristics in NR CA mode with FR1 and FR2 inter-band NR CA, test setup
provides NR FR1 link to the DUT. The NR FR1 link has a stable and noise-free
signal without precise path loss or polarization control. No performance
verification for NR FR1 carriers is supported.
\- The test system shall allow the following modes of noise emulation for UE
demodulation testing:
\- Mode 1: Emulation of fixed SNR conditions at the DUT
\- Mode 2: Emulation of noise-free conditions at the DUT
\- Measurement system shall support the TX EVM (transmit signal error vector
magnitude) not worse than 6% for QPSK/16QAM/64QAM performance requirements.
\- The baseline setup shall allow identification of the DUT RX beam peak
direction
\- Note: RX beam peak search procedure for the DNF setup is undefined.
\-- Applicability Criteria:
In case a DNF test setup is used, the system applies at least to DUTs with a
device size of D ≤ 15cm with no manufacturer declaration and corresponding SNR
calculations in Annex B.3.1 need to be used.
\- In case a DFF or IFF test system is used that leverages the permitted
methods for UE RF, the same applicability criteria as in Clause 5.2 apply and
corresponding SNR calculations in Annex B.3.2 and B.3.3 respectively need to
be used.
#### 7.2.1.2 Measurement distance
The test shall be performed in the radiative near field (limit of the Fresnel
region) or in the far field. The minimum measurement distance _R_ is defined
according to the following formula:
$R > 0.62\sqrt{\frac{D^{3}}{\lambda}}$
where _D_ is the DUT radiating aperture, and _λ_ is the wavelength.
In case a test system is used that leverages the permitted methods for UE RF,
the same measurement distance as in Clause 5 apply.
#### 7.2.1.3 Test parameters
The following main test parameters shall be controlled by measurement
equipment for UE Demodulation and CSI reporting testing.
\- SNR of DL signal at reference point
\- Faded DL channel
For a DNF setup the reference point for SNR of DL signal is defined as the
interclause of the axes of rotation of the positioning system(s). For a DFF or
IFF setups the reference point for SNR of DL signal is defined as the
geometrical center of the QZ. From the UE perspective the reference point is
the input of UE antenna array.

**Figure 7.2.1.3-1: DL SNR reference point for UE Demodulation and CSI testing
methodology**
The performance requirements in TS 38.101-4 [18] will be specified at the
reference point, according to the following principles:
\- Mode 1 (fixed SNR emulation)
\- Test system will transmit the useful signal and noise signals to emulate
target SNR condition.
\- Specify absolute Noc level at the reference point
\- Noc level may have different value according to operating band and UE Power
class
\- Specify SNR~RP~ at the reference point
\- SNR~RP~ is a test-specific value
\- Mode 2 (noise-free emulation)
\- Test system will transmit the useful signal only
\- Specify absolute Es level at the reference point
\- Downlink signal and noise are aligned to the direction with the following
criteria:
Select the known Rx beam peak direction reused from RF testing if available,
as far as it satisfies minimum isolation requirement defined in TS 38.521-4
[21] and rank number in TS 38.521-4 [21] corresponding to the test cases
Otherwise select one direction which satisfied the REFSENS defined in TS
38.101-2 [16], minimum isolation requirement defined in TS 38.521-4 [21] and
rank number in TS 38.521-4 [21] corresponding to the test cases.
##### 7.2.1.3.1 Test parameters for Mode 1
Simulations for UE demodulation and CSI are normally run at baseband, with
results expressed as SNR~BB~, and do not take into account the noise of the UE
RF front end. For over-the-air testing it is not feasible in practice to use
signal levels high enough to make the noise of the UE RF front end negligible.
The approach below has been agreed:
\- Set wanted noise to give 1dB difference between Reference point SNR and
Baseband SNR, using agreed UE requirements, so SNR~RP~ = SNR~BB~ + 1dB
\- Figure 7.2.1.3-2 shows the principle
_The Noc values are based on REFSENS for the operating band and on the UE
Power class, and taking a baseline of UE Power Class 3 in band n260._
_Noc = RESFENS~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~ -10log~10~(SCS_ ~REFSENS~ _x PRB_ ~REFSENS~
_x 12) - SNR_ ~REFSENS~ _\+ ∆~thermal~_
_where:_
\- REFSENS~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~ is the REFSENSvalue in dBm specified for Power
Class 3 UE in band n260 for 50MHz channel bandwidth in TS 38.101-2 [16] Table
7.3.2.3-1 _, [dBm/Hz]_
\- SCS~REFSENS~ is a subcarrier spacing associated with N~RB~ for 50MHz in TS
38.101-2 [16] Table 5.3.2-1, chosen as 120kHz.
\- PRB~REFSENS~ is N~RB~ associated with subcarrier spacing 120kHz for 50MHz
in TS 38.101-2 [16] Table 5.3.2-1 and is 32.
\- 12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB
\- SNR~REFSENS~ = -1 dB is the SNR used for simulation of REFSENS
\- ∆~thermal~ is the amount of dB that the wanted noise is set above UE
thermal noise, giving a rise in total noise of **∆~BB~**. ∆~thermal~ = 6dB,
giving a rise in total noise of 1dB**.**

Figure 7.2.1.3-2: Reference point SNR~RP~ and Baseband SNR~BB~
_The calculated Noc value for the baseline of UE Power class 3 in Band n260 is
rounded to -155dBm/Hz._
The following methodology to define the minimum Noc level for power class X
(PC_X) and operating band Y (Band_Y) is used for the single carrier case and a
single band device:
Noc(PC_X, Band_Y) = -155 dBm/Hz + REFSENS~PC_X,\ Band_Y,\ 50MHz~ --
REFSENS~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~
_where REFSENS values are specified in TS 38.101-2_ [16] Table 7.3.2.3-1 _._
The following methodology to define the minimum Noc level for a multi-band
device:
Noc~MB~ = Noc~SB~ + ΣMB~P~
\- Noc~SB~ is the Noc defined above for a single band device;
\- ΣMB~P~ values are specified in TS 38.101-2 [16].
For CA case, the Noc power level (Noc~CA~) shall increase by a relaxation
factor defined in TS 38.101-2 [16] Table 7.3A.2.1-1.
> Noc~CA~ = Noc~SC~ + ΔR~IB~
\- Noc~SC~ is derived by assuming UE supports single carrier.
\- ΔR~IB~ values are specified in TS 38.101-2 [16].
UE Demodulation and CSI requirements can be defined for any SNR range.
The test system shall be able to determine whether it can provide the SNR
necessary for a specific test case. If required SNR is larger than the SNR
upper bound that can be emulated by test system, the corresponding requirement
can currently not be tested.
The upper bound SNR (SNR~max~) for Mode 1 at the baseband can be estimated as
follows:
> SNR~max~ = P~s,max~ / P~noise,Σ~
>
> P~noise,Σ~ = Noc * BW + _N~noiseRF~_ * BW
>
> P~total,max~ = P~s,max~ + Noc * BW
>
> SNR~max~ = (P~total,max~ - Noc * BW) / ((Noc + _N~noiseRF~_) * BW)
where,
\- P~noise,Σ~: Total equivalent UE receive noise power level at reference
point
\- _N~noiseRF~_ : UE RF noise power spectrum density at reference point for
the particular scenario which can be derived similar to the Noc power level
except the fact that _∆~thermal~_ offset shall not be added (_N~noiseRF~ = Noc
/ ∆~thermal~)._
\- P~s,max~: Maximum power level of the desired RX signal at the reference
point
\- BW: Channel bandwidth, Hz (i.e. test specific parameter)
\- P~total,max~: Maximum power level of the desired RX signal at the reference
point which can be supported by the test equipment
> Note: In the above, all symbols are represented as linear (non-dB) values.
Example assessment of testable DL SNR range for Mode 1 is provided in Annex
B.3.
##### 7.2.1.3.2 Test parameters for Mode 2
For Mode 2 the test system shall transmit the wanted signal with power level
Es which is the best achievable power level by the test system.
The test system shall be able to determine achievable Es level for the noise
free tests for all test cases.
For sustained data rate tests, the test system shall be also capable to
determine the upper bound SNR which will be observed at the UE taking into
account the UE RF characteristics. The upper bound SNR (SNR~max~) for Mode 2
at the baseband can be estimated as follows:
> SNR~max~ = P~s,max~ / P~noise,Σ~
>
> P~noise,Σ~ = _N~noiseRF~_ * BW
>
> P~total,max~ = P~s,max~
>
> SNR~max~ = P~total,max~ / (_N~noiseRF~_ * BW)
where,
\- P~noise,Σ~: Total equivalent UE receive noise power level at reference
point
\- _N~noiseRF~_ : UE RF noise power spectrum density at reference point for
the particular scenario which can be derived similar to the Noc power level
for Mode 1 except the fact that _∆~thermal~_ offset shall not be added
(_N~noiseRF~ = Noc / ∆~thermal~)._
\- P~s,max~: Maximum power level of the desired RX signal at the reference
point
\- BW: Channel bandwidth, Hz (i.e. test specific parameter)
\- P~total,max~: Maximum power level of the desired RX signal at the reference
point which can be supported by the test equipment
Note: In the above, all symbols are represented as linear (non-dB) values.
#### 7.2.1.4 Test metrics
The test method shall allow testing of typical UE Demodulation and CSI metrics
similar to the metrics used of LTE, including at least:
\- Absolute PDSCH throughput
\- Block-error rate performance for different DL physical channels (e.g.
PDCCH)
\- CSI statistics (e.g. CQI accuracy, throughput ratio for different CSI or
test settings, etc.)
7.3 Summary of initial uncertainty assessment
The detailed analysis of MU factors affecting DL SNR accuracy/range
measurement uncertainty is provided in Annex B.3.1.
# 8 Propagation conditions
## 8.1 General
Test methods shall allow modelling of the following propagation conditions
between the DUT and the emulated gNB sources:
\- Multi-path fading propagation conditions
\- Fading propagation conditions between the DUT and the emulated gNB sources
are modelled as Single probe channel models as described in clause 8.2.
\- Applicable to the UE RRM testing methodology and UE Demodulation and CSI
testing methodology.
\- Static propagation conditions
\- Model is described in clause 8.3.
\- Applicable to the UE RRM testing methodology and UE Demodulation and CSI
testing methodology.
## 8.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
Multi-path fading propagation conditions between the DUT and the emulated gNB
sources are modelled as Single probe channel models.
### 8.2.1 Single probe channel modelling methodology
Two options for Single probe channel modelling methodology were identified as
described in clause 8.2.1.1 and 8.2.1.2, including details on generating each
single probe channel option.
Both Option 1 and Option 2 methodologies were concluded as feasible from test
equipment perspective. Selection between the methodologies and the selection
of specific parameters (e.g. power delay profile) are to be done in the scope
of Rel. 15 NR UE performance requirements work.
FR2 measurement system is expected to support modelling of multi-path fading
for single carrier scenarios with channel bandwidth of at least 200 MHz. The
support of channel modelling for CA scenarios is not precluded.
#### 8.2.1.1 Channel model Option 1
Channel model option 1 is based on the TDL methodology in the TR 38.901 [10]:
\- The multi-path propagation conditions model consists of several parts:
\- A power delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\" (TDL),
characterized by a number of taps with certain power at fixed positions on a
sampling grid.
\- The channel model parameters include the Delay spread scaling factor and
the maximum Doppler frequency. The test system shall allow flexible control of
the respective parameters.
\- Each tap is modeled based on the Jakes fading model.
\- Generation of TDL channel models and power delay profiles from CDL channel
models by including spatial filters to capture Tx and Rx antenna patterns is
not precluded and based on the procedure described in the TR 38.901 [10].
The method to generate fading coefficients (Jakes fading model) satisfying the
target parameters is not specified in [10]. Traditionally, there has been two
methods to implement this type of tapped delay line models:
\- The first alternative is to use the noise filtering, where the Doppler
power spectrum is realized by Doppler spectrum shaping filtering of i.i.d.
complex Gaussian noise sample sequences. This step is followed by generating
the MIMO correlations between sequences by multiplying them with factored
target MIMO correlation matrix. The matrix has dimensions US x US, where U and
S denote the number of Rx and Tx antennas, respectively.
\- The second alternative is the sum-of-sinusoids method, where the temporal
characteristics (Doppler power spectrum) are generated by summing a number of
sinusoids with specific phase, amplitude and frequency characteristics. This
step is followed by generating the MIMO correlations between sequences by
multiplying them with factored target MIMO correlation matrix. The matrix has
dimensions US x US, where U and S denote the number of Rx and Tx antennas,
respectively.
#### 8.2.1.2 Channel model Option 2
This clause considers channel model methodology with non-Jakes spectrum.
Multi-path fading propagation conditions between the gNB emulator and test
chamber probe is modelled based on Clustered Delay Line (CDL) methodology in
TR 38.901 [10]. Doppler Spread and MIMO correlation related to such
methodology is defined in clauses 8.2.1.2.1 and 8.2.1.2.2 respectively.
To generate the multi-path fading propagation conditions, the following step
by step procedure modified from [10] should be used to generate channel
coefficients using the CDL models:
[Step 1:]{.underline} Generate cluster delays (from clause 7.7.3 in [10])
The RMS delay spread values of CDL models are normalized and they must be
scaled in delay so that a desired RMS delay spread can be achieved. The scaled
delays can be obtained according to the following equation:
(8.2.1.2-1)
in which
> \- is the normalized delay value of the _n_ th cluster in a CDL in Tables
> 7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 of [10]
>
> \- is the new delay value (in [ns]) of the _n_ th cluster
>
> \- is the wanted delay spread (in [ns]) and it must be specified as a
> channel model parameter
[Step 1.1:]{.underline} In the case of LOS models (D and E) scale cluster the
powers as specified in clause 7.7.6 of [10]. The target Ricean K-factor values
_K_ ~desired~ must be specified.
[Step 2:]{.underline} Generate departure and arrival angles (based on clause
7.7.1 step 1 in [10] combining 7.7-5 and part of step 7 in clause 7.5 in [10]
adding some clarifications to the parameters considered)
Generate arrival angles of azimuth using the following equation
, (8.2.1.2-2)
where
_\- φ~n,~_ ~AOA~ and _c_ ~ASA~ are the cluster AOA and the cluster-wise rms
azimuth spread of arrival angles (cluster ASA), respectively, in Tables
7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 of [10]
_\- α~m~_ denotes the ray offset angles within a cluster given by Table 7.5-3
of [10],
_-_ is the mean angle of the original channel model table in NLOS case
(equation is specified in Annex A.2 of [10]) and the LOS angle in LOS case,
_-_ are the angular spreads. derived^1)^ from the original CDL Tables 7.7.1.1
-- 7.7.1.5 of [10], they are listed in Table 8.2.1.2-1
_-_ is the wanted angular spread. It must be specified.
The angular scaling according to eq. (2) is applied to the ray angles and no
further scaling is performed. The generation of AOD (), ZSA (), and ZSD ()
follows a procedure similar to AOA as described above.
Note: The azimuth angles may need to be wrapped around to be within [0, 360]
degrees, while the zenith angles may need to be clipped to be within [0, 180]
degrees.
^1)^ _The angular spread in this case is the rms angular spread without
finding the minimum value over angular rotations._

CDL-D 19.0 21.1 3.0 1.9 CDL-E 13.2 37.6 1.5 2.5
Table 8.2.1.2-1 contains the angle spread values of the original CDL models of
38.901 ([2]) before any angular scaling. The values are calculated for the
angles AOD, AOA, ZOD, and ZOA angles after removing the mean angle following
the definition of rms angular spread in TR25.997, without finding the minimum
over circular shifts.
[Step 3:]{.underline} Coupling of rays within a cluster for both azimuth and
elevation (based on step 2 in 7.7.1 in [10] assuming fix coupling instead of
random)
Couple AOD angles to AOA angles within a cluster _n_. Couple ZOD angles with
ZOA angles using the same procedure. Couple AOD angles with ZOD angles within
a cluster _n_. Instead of random procedure, the coupling is performed using
the fixed coupling pattern. It must be specified.
[Step 4:]{.underline} Generate the cross-polarization power ratios (from
clause 7.7.1 step 3 in [10])
Calculate the linear cross polarization power ratios (XPR) _κ_ for each ray
_m_ of each cluster _n_ as
, (8.2.1.2-3)
where _X_ is the per-cluster XPR in dB and must be specified.
[Step 5:]{.underline} Specify gNB beam pattern (based on clause 7.3 of [10]
plus assumptions for gNB antenna)
With definitions and symbols of clause 7.3 of [10] (except substitute
N:=_N~e~_ , M:=_M~e~_ to avoid ambiguity), specify parameters (_M~g~_ ,
_N~g~_ ,  _M~e~_ ,  _N~e~_ ,  _P_) and (_d~H~_ , _d~V~)._
Antenna element radiation patterns, including orientation of the element main
polarization components as well as orientation of the antenna array should be
specified.
It is assumed the co-polarized elements of the array are combined to a single
RF port, i.e. they compose an antenna array that can form beams by setting
certain weights per element. Weight vector for the first polarization and for
the second polarization is
(8.2.1.2-4)
where is the location vector of transmit antenna element and .
[Step 6]{.underline}: Specify initial phases
Instead of drawing initial phases {width="1.4861111111111112in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} randomly for each ray _m_ of each cluster _n_
and for four different polarisation combinations (_θθ_ , _θϕ,_ _ϕθ,_ _ϕϕ_),
initial phases must be specified.
[Step 7:]{.underline} Coefficient generation (based on step 4 in [10])
Follow the same procedure as in Steps 10 and 11 in Subclause 7.5 in [10], with
the exception that all clusters are treated as \"weaker cluster\", i.e. no
further sub-clusters in delay should be generated^2)^. Additional clusters
representing delay spread of the stronger clusters are already provided in
Tables 7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 in [10]. Once weight vector in equation 4 is
combined with eq. (7.5-22) and eq. (7.5-29) in [10], the following equations
apply respectively:
(8.2.1.2-5)
(8.2.1.2-6)
where s goes from 1 to S, being S the number of gNB RF ports
^2)^ _Note: This may need to be changed such that the three rows of CDL tables
containing equal angular parameters are treated as a single cluster with three
mid-paths as in Step 11 of Subclause 7.5 in [10]._
As shown above, this model is using following parameters
\- Base CDL model from CDL models defined in [10, Subclause 7.7.1]
characterized by normalized delay, power, AOA, AOD, ZOA and ZOD for each
cluster; delay spread, angular spread and mean angle for AOA, AOD, ZOA and
ZOD. Further simplification of CDL models in [10, Subclause 7.7.1] can be
defined in UE demodulation performance discussion.
\- Emulated gNB related parameters: gNB antenna field pattern, gNB antenna
orientation and polarization
\- Emulated UE related parameters: UE antenna field pattern, UE antenna
orientation and polarization, UE speed and direction
\- Initial phases {width="1.4861111111111112in" height="0.2638888888888889in"}
for each ray _m_ of each cluster _n_ for NLOS paths and distance d~3D~
(explained in [10, Figure 7.4.1-1] to model LOS path loss) for LOS path.
\- Tx/Rx beam selection procedure between emulated gNB and emulated UE antenna
\- Ricean K factor for LOS CDL base models
\- Carrier Frequency
\- Fixed pairing between angles of arrival and angles of departure in Step 2
described in [10, Subclause 7.7.1].
##### 8.2.1.2.1 MIMO Correlation
From equation 7.5-22 in [10], fading coefficients are generated per Tx per Rx
for each cluster. Therefore, MIMO correlation matrix can be computed from
those coefficients for each cluster. So, MIMO correlation matrix spectrum is
implicit in the way we generate the fading channel coefficients and does not
need to be modelled explicitly.
It is noted that the MIMO correlation can be controlled by introducing Ricean
K-factor to all model scenarios and setting the K-factor properly.
Alternatively, the MIMO correlation can be controlled by modifying the XPR
parameter. However, this depends on the selected antenna model.
### 8.2.2 Path Delay grid for channel models
The path delay grid for the channel models is defined as equidistant delay
grid n*∆T with n∈N~0.~ From the test methodology perspective it is feasible to
support ∆T≤1/ F~sample~.
For single carrier scenarios with channel bandwidth up to 200MHz, the
F~sample~ is defined as 200 MHz and ∆T ≤ 5 ns. For the channel models
definition for the requirements definition a fixed quantization grid can be
used (e.g. ∆T = 5ns).
For intra-band CA scenarios the F~sample~ requires further studies. The
F~sample~ used for these scenarios will be discussed and decided as part of
the NR work item performance part.
In case multiple taps of the original delay profile end up with the same
delay, the powers of the individual taps are added, resulting in a single path
with the combined power.
Each tap of the scaled delay profile shall be mapped to the closest point of
the delay grid defined by n*∆T. In case a tap in the delay profile lies
equidistant between two points of the delay grid, it shall be mapped to the
larger delay grid point.
An example for mapping the delays for a scaled power delay profile to the
equidistant delay grid is given in clause 8.2.2.1.
#### 8.2.2.1 Example for determining the resulting delay profile
A power delay profile after delay spread scaling is given as follows in Table
8.2.2.1-1.
Table 8.2.2.1-1: Original power delay profile
**Tap _k_** **Power** $\sigma_{k}^{2}$ **_σ~k~^2^_ (linear)** **Delay _τ_**

_σ~6~^2^_ 33
With the assumption of ∆T = 1/(200 MHz) = 5 ns the taps from Table 8.2.2.1-1
can be mapped onto an equidistant delay grid as shown in Table 8.2.2.1-2.
Table 8.2.2.1-2: Power delay profile after mapping to delay grid
**Tap _k_** **Power** $\sigma_{k}^{2}$ **_σ~k~^2^_ (linear)** **Delay**

## 8.3 Static propagation conditions
The test methods shall allow emulation of the following static propagation
conditions for the UE with 2RX antenna port as follows.
For 1 port transmission the emulated channel matrix is defined in the
frequency domain by

For 2 port transmission the emulated channel matrix is defined in the
frequency domain by

Note: Channel matrices above for static propagation conditions are the channel
matrices generated by the channel emulator.
###### ## Annex A: Environment conditions
# A.1 Operating voltage
All nominal voltage test cases shall be performed with the DUT operated in
stand-alone battery powered mode except for DUTs whose power is provided only
from AC mains. For extreme voltage test cases, the UE shall fulfil all the
requirements in the full voltage range, i.e. the voltage range between the
extreme voltages. When those test cases require an external power source with
cables connected to the DUT that could adversely affect the device
performance, it shall be demonstrated that there is negligible impact to
performance with the device operated in stand-alone battery powered mode
compared to the device operated in external power mode first before performing
the extreme voltage test cases.
###### ## Annex B: Measurement uncertainty
# B.1 Measurement uncertainty budget for UE RF testing methodology
## B.1.1 Direct far field (DFF) setup
### B.1.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle
The uncertainty tables should be presented with two stages:
\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose absolute
gain is known at the frequencies of measurement
\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the transmitter or
receiver is performed.
The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:
1) The uncertainty source,
2) Uncertainty value,
3) Distribution of the probability,
4) Divisor based on distribution shape,
5) Calculated standard uncertainty (based on uncertainty value and divisor).

### B.1.1.3 Uncertainty assessment
The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:
\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna aperture
of the DUT is denoted as D, and the uncertainty assessment has been derived
for the case of D = 5 cm
\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP and TRP, assuming D = 5 cm, is provided
in Table B.1.1.3-1
\- The uncertainty assessment for EIS, assuming D = 5 cm, is provided in Table
B.1.1.3-2

### B.1.1.4 Measurement error contribution descriptions
#### B.1.1.4.1 Positioning misalignment
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing direction
and the beam peak direction of the receiving antenna due to imperfect rotation
operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in both azimuth and vertical
directions and the effect of the misalignment depends highly on the beamwidth
of the beam under test. The same level of misalignment results in a larger
measurement error for a narrower beam.
#### B.1.1.4.2 Measure distance uncertainty
The cause of this uncertainty contributor is due to the reduction of distance
between the measurement antenna and the DUT. If the distance of separation is
2D^2^/lambda based on D being the entire device size, then the phase variation
is 22.5deg. Whether this is the minimum acceptable criteria of phase taper
over the entire DUT is FFS and shall be assessed during final MU definition
for the test method. Any reduction in the distance of separation increases the
phase variation and creates an error which is DUT dependant. Determination of
limit of the error shall be done during final MU definition for the test
method.
#### B.1.1.4.3 Quality of quiet zone
The quality of the quiet zone procedure characterizes the quiet zone
performance of the anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of reflections
within the anechoic chamber including any positioners and support structures.
The MU term additionally includes the amplitude variations effect of
offsetting the directive antenna array inside a DUT from the centre of the
quiet zone as well as the directivity MU, i.e., the variation of antenna gains
in the different direct line-of-sight links. An additional MU term related to
phase variation and phase ripple effects which depends on measurement distance
is FFS and shall be assessed during final MU definition for the test method.
This might require an augmentation of the quality of the quiet zone validation
procedure.
#### B.1.1.4.4 Mismatch
Mismatch uncertainty occurs when;
\- Changing the signal path between the measurement and calibration procedure
\- Evaluating the insertion loss of a signal path
The mismatch uncertainty for a system consisting of a generator, a load and a
component in between is defined as
$\text{Mismatch\ contribution\ }\left( \text{standard\ deviation} \right) =
\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{generator}} \right| \cdot \left|
\Gamma_{\text{load}} \right| \cdot \left| S_{21} \right| \cdot \left| S_{12}
\right| \cdot 100}{\sqrt{2} \cdot 11.5}\ \text{dB}$,
Where $\Gamma$ denotes the reflection coefficient and $S_{21}$ is the
transmission coefficient, both in linear voltage ratios.
For a cascade of several components, the interactions between all components
have to be evaluated. For example, for four devices in a row (shown in Figure
B.1.1.4.4-1) the following contributions have to be accounted for: AB, BC, CD,
ABC, BCD, ABCD. The term ABCD represents the interaction between A and D
(generator and load) with the components B and C in between.
Figure B.1.1.4.4-1: Cascade of components
The combined mismatch uncertainty is given by the root sum square of the
individual contributions:
$combined\ mismatch\ uncertainty = \sqrt{\left( \text{AB} \right)^{2} + \left(
\text{BC} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{CD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{ABC}
\right)^{2} + \left( \text{BCD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{ABCD} \right)^{2}\
}$
In an optimized test procedure, the overall mismatch uncertainty is smaller
when matching pairs of mismatches exist in the calibration and measurement
stage since these pairs cancel each other out. Figure B.1.1.4.4-2 displays a
calibration setup, where device D is replaced by device F. The mismatch
contributions for this path are AB, BC, CE, ABC, BCE and ABCE. For a result
based on the measurement and calibration stage, the mismatch contributions AB,
BC, and ABC are matching pairs as they occur both in the measurement and
calibration stage. Thus, they can be eliminated [11], and the system mismatch
uncertainty is obtained as
$\sqrt{\left( \text{CD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{CE} \right)^{2} + \left(
\text{BCD} \right)^{2} + (BC{E)}^{2} + \left( \text{ABCD} \right)^{2} + \left(
\text{ABCE} \right)^{2}}$
Figure B.1.1.4.4-2: Sketch of a calibration path
In the following, an example mismatch uncertainty calculation for a TX/RX
patch from the measurement equipment to the measurement antenna is performed
for a frequency of 43.5GHz. The example path under investigation consists of
four SPDT switches, one SP6T switch and one DPDT switch and microwave cable
interconnects with PC2.4 mm connectors. The attenuation and reflectance of
typical components suitable for frequencies ranging up to 43.5 GHz have been
considered in the calculation of the mismatch uncertainty.
Figure B1.1.4.4-3 shows a sample system setup for an EIRP/EIS test case with
rather simple complexity of the switch box similar to a current FR1 test
setup. It should be noted that the switch unit is significantly less complex
than a state-of-the-art switch unit currently used for conformance tests.

The calculation of the overall mismatch uncertainty for a frequency of 43.5
GHz results in a value of 2.7 dB for the standard deviation, i.e., the
expanded uncertainty is 5.3 dB.
Figure B.1.1.4.4-4 depicts a possible calibration for a part of the setup.

Figure B.1.1.4.4-4: Block Diagram of the calibration stage
For the VNA a return loss of 30 dB is assumed after a full two-port
calibration. The calculation of the system mismatch uncertainty applying the
elimination of matching pairs results in a value of 1.0 dB (standard
deviation) with an expanded value of 1.9 dB.
Since the overall mismatch uncertainty value is already a standard deviation,
which is RSS of values divided by the divisor (√2), the overall mismatch
uncertainty value should be divided by actual divisor 1 when calculating total
mismatch.
#### B.1.1.4.5 Absolute antenna gain uncertainty of the measurement antenna
This contribution originates from differences in gain of the calibration
antenna versus the measurement antenna. In practice, the calibration antenna
is used as the measurement antenna so the uncertainty contribution is 0.00.
#### B.1.1.4.6 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment
The receiving device is used to measure the received signal level in the EIRP
tests as an absolute level. These receiving devices are spectrum analysers,
communication analysers, or power meters. The uncertainty value will be
indicated in the manufacturer\'s data sheet. It needs to be ensured that
appropriate manufacturer\'s uncertainty contributions are specified for the
settings used such as bandwidth and absolute level. If a power meter is used
zero offset, zero drift and measurement noise need to be included.
#### B.1.1.4.7 Phase curvature
This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the antenna of UE/reference antenna. At a
measurement distance of 2D^2^/lambda the phase curvature is 22.5 degrees. The
impact of this factor shall be assessed during final MU definition for the
test method.
#### B.1.1.4.8 Amplifier uncertainties
Any components in the setup can potentially introduce measurement uncertainty.
It is then needed to determine the uncertainty contributors associated with
the use of such components. For the case of external amplifiers, the following
uncertainties should be considered but the applicability is contingent to the
measurement implementation and calibration procedure.
\- Stability
\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the output level stability of the
amplifier. Even if the amplifier is part of the system for both measurement
and calibration, the uncertainty due to the stability shall be considered.
This uncertainty can be either measured or determined by the manufacturers'
data sheet for the operating conditions in which the system will be required
to operate.
\- Linearity
\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the linearity of the amplifier since
in most cases calibration and measurements are performed at two different
input/output power levels. This uncertainty can be either measured or
determined by the manufacturers' data sheet.
\- Noise Figure
\- When the signal goes into an amplifier, noise is added so that the SNR at
the output is reduced with regard to the SNR of the signal at the input. This
added noise introduces error on the signal which affects the Error Rate of the
receiver thus the EVM (Error Vector Magnitude). An uncertainty can be
calculated through the following formula:
{width="2.013888888888889in" height="0.3611111111111111in"}
\- Where SNR is the signal to noise ratio in dB at the signal level used
during the sensitivity measurement.
\- Mismatch
\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be considered
systematic and constant -> 0dB. If it is not the case, the mismatch
uncertainty at its input and output shall be either measured or determined by
the method described in [12].
\- Gain
\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be considered
systematic and constant -> 0dB. If it is not the case, this uncertainty shall
be considered.
#### B.1.1.4.9 Random uncertainty
This contribution is used to account for all the unknown, unquantifiable, etc.
uncertainties associated with the measurements.
Random uncertainty MU contributions are normally distributed. [Note: this is
different from \"Miscellaneous uncertainty\" or \"Residual uncertainty\" which
can include unknown systematic errors which may not be normally distributed.]
The random uncertainty term, by definition, cannot be measured, or even
isolated completely. However, past system definitions provide an empirical
basis for a value. Current LTE SISO OTA measurements have random uncertainty
contributions of \~0.2dB. A value of 0.5dB is suggested due to increased
sensitivity to random effects in more complex, higher frequency NR test
systems.
#### B.1.1.4.10 Influence of the XPD
This factor takes into account the uncertainty caused due to the finite cross
polar discrimination (XPD) between the two polarization ports of the
measurement probe. The XPD of the probe antenna shall be take into account
during final MU definition for the test method..
A typical probe antenna can have XPD of 30dB.
For example if a linearly-polarized sine wave is input to the measurement
antenna with a gradient of 45 degrees like the case in the following figure,
then a signal level of V-antenna and H antenna are equal.
When we consider a leakage from V to H, or H to V, they can be described with
the following equations.
{width="4.694444444444445in" height="0.2013888888888889in"}
$ReceivedSignal@Ant\left( V \right) = A \bullet sin\left( 2\pi ft \right) +
LeakageComponentFromH$(B.1.1.4.10-1)
$ReceivedSignal@Ant\left( H \right) = A \bullet sin\left( 2\pi ft \right) +
LeakageComponentFromV${width="4.694444444444445in"
height="0.2013888888888889in"} (B.1.1.4.10-2)
Worst case can be assumed as the case that the phase of signal and leakage are
same, and it can be shown as follows
$LeakageComponentFromH = \ A \bullet sin\left( 2\pi ft \right) \bullet
10^{\frac{\text{XPD}}{20}}${width="3.625in" height="0.2708333333333333in"}
(B.1.1.4.10-3)
{width="3.6041666666666665in" height="0.2986111111111111in"} (B.1.1.4.10-4)
If we put equations (3) in (1) and (4) in (2), we get following 2 equations.
{width="3.5416666666666665in" height="0.3472222222222222in"} (B.1.1.4.10-5)
{width="3.5416666666666665in" height="0.3680555555555556in"} (B.1.1.4.10-6)
Difference of amplitude between the case that there is a leakage and not can
be calculated as follows.
\- Amplitude when there is not the leakage: {width="0.1527777777777778in"
height="0.18055555555555555in"}
\- Amplitude when there is the leakage (Worst): {width="0.9722222222222222in"
height="0.3611111111111111in"}$A \bullet \left( 1 + 10^{\frac{\text{XPD}}{20}}
\right)$
{width="4.194444444444445in" height="0.6944444444444444in"}
For example, if the XPD = -30dB, the calculated value can be as follows.
{width="3.1319444444444446in" height="0.3541666666666667in"}
#### B.1.1.4.11 Reference antenna positioning misalignment
This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and pointing
error. In this measurement if the maximum gain directions of the reference
antenna and the receiving antenna are aligned to each other, this contribution
can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
#### B.1.1.4.12 Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer
This contribution originates from all uncertainties involved transmission
magnitude measurement (including drift and frequency flatness) with a network
analyser. The uncertainty value will be indicated in the manufacturer\'s data
sheet. It needs to be ensured that appropriate manufacturer\'s uncertainty
contribution is specified for the absolute levels measured.
#### B.1.1.4.13 Reference antenna feed cable loss measurement uncertainty
Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss have
to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer to measure
its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced. This contribution should be set as
zero.
#### B.1.1.4.14 Uncertainty of an absolute gain of the calibration antenna
The calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the gain
uncertainty has to be taken into account. This uncertainty will come from a
calibration report with traceability to a National Metrology Institute with
measurement uncertainty budgets generated following the guidelines outlined in
internationally accepted standards.
#### B.1.1.4.15 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference
antenna and the receiving antenna
This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and pointing
error. In this measurement if the maximum gain direction of the reference
antenna and the transmitting antenna are aligned to each other, this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
#### B.1.1.4.16 gNB emulator uncertainty
gNB emulator is used to drive a signal to the horn antenna (via multiple
external components such as a switch box, an amplifier and a circulator, etc.)
in sensitivity tests either as an absolute level or as a relative level.
Receiving device used is typically a UE/phablet/tablet/FWA. Generally there
occurs uncertainty contribution from absolute level accuracy, non-linearity
and frequency characteristic of the gNB emulator.
For practical reasons, in a case that a VNA is used as a calibration
equipment, gNB emulator is connected to the system after the calibration
measurement (Stage 2) is performed by the VNA. Hence, the uncertainty on the
absolute level of gNB emulator (transmitter device) cannot be assumed as
systematic. This uncertainty should be calculated from the manufacturer's data
in logs with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed.
Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity is included in the absolute
level uncertainty.
#### B.1.1.4.17 Phase centre offset of calibration
Gain is defined at the phase centre of the antenna. If the phase centre of the
calibration antenna is not aligned at the centre of the set up during the
calibration, then there will be uncertainty related to the measurement
distance.
The phase centre of a horn antenna moves with frequency along the taper length
of the antenna therefore during the calibration the phase centre of all
frequencies will not be aligned with the setup centre. The associated
uncertainty term can be estimated using the following formula [15]:
{width="1.5416666666666667in" height="0.5416666666666666in"}
Where d~m~ is the measurement distance and d~p~ is the maximum positional
uncertainty. For a Horn antenna this is equal to 0.5 the length of the taper.
This uncertainty is considered to have a rectangular distribution so the
standard uncertainty is calculated by dividing the uncertainty by √3.
The same equation applies to log periodic antennas with d~m~ being 0.5 the
length of the boom.
For a dipole antenna, given that the phase centre of the antenna is easily
aligned with the centre of the set up the measurement uncertainty is zero.
If the calibration antenna (i.e. horn) is adjusted during the calibration to
align the phase centre to the setup centre then this uncertainty term can be
considered to be zero.
As an example a horn with a taper length of 50 mm, at 43.5 GHz and a
measurement distance of 72.55 cm the uncertainty term is 0.62, with a
rectangular distribution the standard uncertainty is 0.358 dB.
#### B.1.1.4.18 Quality of quiet zone for calibration process
During the calibration process the calibration antenna will be placed at the
centre of the quiet zone. Therefore, only point P1 from the procedure outlined
in B.1.1.4.3 needs to be considered for the quality of the quiet zone
validation measurement.
For gain calibrations, the standard uncertainty of the EIRP results obtained
following the method outlined in 2.10 shall be used. For efficiency
calibrations, the standard uncertainty of the TRP result obtained following
the method outlined in 2.9 shall be used.

See B.1.1.4.1
#### B.1.3.4.2 Quality of Quiet Zone
See B.1.1.4.3
#### B.1.3.4.3 Standing wave between DUT and measurement antenna
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between DUT and measurement antenna. This
value can be captured by sliding (lambda/4) the DUT towards the measurement
antenna as the standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in
measured gain. DUT scattering/interaction can also cause standing wave.
#### B.1.3.4.4 Mismatch
See B.1.1.4.4
#### B.1.3.4.5 Insertion loss variation of receiver chain
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the measurement Stage 2, the
uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the measurement
stage.
#### B.1.3.4.6 RF leakage (from measurement antenna to receiver/transmitter)
This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s) between
measurement antenna and receiving/transmitting equipment. The contribution
also includes the noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between
reference antenna and transmitting equipment for the calibration phase.

See B.1.1.4.10
#### B.1.3.4.11 Misalignment positioning system
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to maximum this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.

See B.1.1.4.12.
#### B.1.3.4.13 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna
See B.1.1.4.14.
#### B.1.3.4.14 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable (Flexing
cables, adapters, attenuators, connector repeatability)
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna (SGH) and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured.
This is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary
joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as the
uncertainty.
#### B.1.3.4.15 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference
antenna and the receiving antenna
See B.1.1.4.15
#### B.1.3.4.16 Standing wave between reference calibration antenna and
measurement antenna
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between SGH and measurement antenna. This
value can be captured by sliding (lambda/4) the SGH towards the measurement
antenna as the standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in
measured gain. SGH scattering/interaction can also cause standing wave.

### B.1.4.4 Measurement error contribution descriptions
#### B.1.4.4.1 Axes Alignment
Includes the following mechanical alignment errors:
\- The uncertainty related with the lateral displacement between the
horizontal and vertical axes of the DUT positioner.
\- The differences from 90° of the angle between the horizontal and vertical
axes.
\- The horizontal mis-pointing of the horizontal axis to the probe reference
point for Theta=0°.
These mechanical errors can result in sampling the field on a non-ideal
sphere. This uncertainty can be considered to have a normal distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.2 Probe XPD
Refer to B.1.1.4.10 [7]. If the Probe Polarization Amplitude and Phase is
measured and corrected for then this uncertainty term can be considered to be
zero.
#### B.1.4.4.3 Probe Polarization Amplitude and Phase
The amplitude and phase of the probe polarization coefficients should be
measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.4 Probe Array Uniformity (for multi -probe systems only)
This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used for
each physical position. Different probes have different radiation patterns.
Generally, the probe array is calibrated so that the uniformity of the probes
is achieved. This uncertainty term must be considered if the amplitude and
phase of each probe is not identical or corrected for. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a normal distribution
#### B.1.4.4.5 Probe Pattern Effect
The probe/s pattern/s is assumed to be known so that the DUT measurement in
near field can be corrected when performing the near field to far field
transform. If the probe pattern is known, then the uncertainty term is zero.
There is no direct dependence between the DUT pattern and the probe pattern in
near field measurements. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal
distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.6 Multiple Reflections: Coupling Measurement Antenna and DUT
The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna and re-
reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving antenna. This
uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of the DUT when at
different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
normal distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.7 Quality of the Quiet Zone
See B.1.1.4.3
#### B.1.4.4.8 Measurement Distance
See B.1.1.4.2
#### B.1.4.4.9 NF to FF truncation
The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical modes. The
number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering effect generated
by the finite number of modes can improve measurement results by removing
signals from outside the physical area of the DUT. Care must be taken in order
to make sure the removed signals are not from the DUT itself. This term also
includes the uncertainty related to the scan area truncation. This uncertainty
is usually negligible. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal
distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.10 Mismatch of receiver chain
See B.1.1.4.4
#### B.1.4.4.11 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment
See B.1.1.4.6.
#### B.1.4.4.12 Amplifier uncertainties
See B.1.1.4.8
#### B.1.4.4.13 Phase Recovery Non-Linearity over signal bandwidth
This uncertainty originates from the non-linearity of the phase recovery for
wide band signal. The phase recovery can be due to either phase non-linearity
of the receiver and/or the DUT itself. The method to quantify the non-
linarites is not defined.
#### B.1.4.4.14 Phase Drift and Noise
This uncertainty is due to the noise level and drift of the test range and
should be determined or measured at the DUT location. The noise level is
usually measured with a Spectrum Analyzer. This uncertainty is assumed to have
a normal distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.15 Leakage and Crosstalk
This uncertainty can be addressed by measurements on the actual system setup.
The leakage and crosstalk cannot be separated from the random amplitude and
phase errors so that the relative importance should be determined. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.
#### B.1.4.4.16 Random uncertainty

#### B.1.4.4.17 Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer
See B.1.1.4.12

B.2.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle
The uncertainty tables cover the actual measurement using the DUT. In some
cases, uncertainty may also arise from a calibration or alignment process
before the measurements.
When a calibration process is used before the measurements, the uncertainty
tables should be presented with two stages:
\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose absolute
gain is known at the frequencies of measurement

### B.2.1.5 Assessment of testable SNR range for D=5cm
The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated by
the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise provided by
the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and potentially
limiting the testable SNR range.
For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set much
higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible. However for
over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically be delivered into
the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test point is likely to be
closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation is allowable.
#### B.2.1.5.1 Method and Parameters
The initial rational in this clause is elaborated for Scenario 1 (1 Angle of
Arrival with signal coming from the RX beam peak direction) for Type 1
Requirements (\"Fine\" RX beam) and Mode 1 Configuration (TE generating S and
N).
For RRM tests, DL SNR is given as a test parameter. Such SNR environment is
generated by the test system by injecting both desired signal and artificial
AWGN noise. To fulfil the purpose of the test, the configured SNR should be
accurate enough at the UE receiver. If the absolute power level of the signal
and noise from the test system is too low, then the SNR would be degraded due
to the UE's internal noise.
The calculation of Noc level is shown in clause 6.2.1.4.
The possible transmitted signal and noise strengths from the test antenna
depend on the capability of the test system. The feasible transmit power
depends on the conducted cable losses, the Test system transmit antenna gain
and the final amplifier characteristic, especially the P1dB compression point.
Considering the cable losses, probe antenna gain of 12dB and commercially
available mmWave Amplifiers, and the crest factor of the downlink signal (not
to cause additional EVM error from test system side), the feasible transmit
power from the probe antenna is calculated below, which in turn sets the SNR
range.

B.2.1.5.4 SNR range for SNR~RP~ - SNR~BB~ ≤ 1dB
The initial rational in this clause is elaborated for Scenario 1 (1 Angle of
Arrival with signal coming from the RX beam peak direction) for Type 1
Requirements (\"Fine\" RX beam) and Mode 1 Configuration (TE generating S and
N).
Based on the method of setting the noise from the Test system to give a
maximum of 1dB degradation in overall SNR between reference point and
baseband, we can then work back through the signal chain to determine how high
the SNR can be set. As the noise is set to a fixed level, the maximum SNR is
set by the test system power amplifier and the channel bandwidth to be tested.
The SNR upper bound depends on the type of test system. For the Direct far
field (DFF) setup the diagram below illustrates the principle, and is based on
the \"DFF 100MHz\" tab of the accompanying spreadsheet.
The process works back through the signal chain, from left to right in the
diagram.
Figure B.2.1.5.4-1: Estimation of multi band UE SNR range for Direct far field
(DFF), fine beam, Rx Beam peak direction
The test equipment must supply at least the wanted noise level at the
reference point. If the noise was lower, the degradation in SNR would be
greater than 1dB, and may cause a conformant UE to fail.
The accuracy of setting the signal and noise levels has been taken as
+/-[6.0]dB. It is subject to further analysis by RAN5.
During conformance test, the test system will need to find the UE Rx beam
peak. At present an allowance of [0.5] dB has been included, but is subject to
further analysis by RAN5.
An allowance of 2 dB has been made for UE multi-band relaxation factor ∑MBp
from Table 6.2.1.3-4 of TS 38.101-2 [16].
Inclusion of these three contributions directly reduces the maximum SNR that
can be measured by a test system for a given channel bandwidth. To find the
maximum SNR that can be measured by a test system with a specific Channel BW,
the baseband SNR in the spreadsheet is increased until the value \"Wanted
signal + headroom, dBm/Ch BW\" is just below the \"TE Power amplifier 1dB
compression, dBm\" value. The resulting values are given in Table B.2.1.5.4-1.
Table B.2.1.5.4-1: Predicted SNR upper bound values for Direct far field

Rx Beam peak Fine 24 [22.2 dB] 66 [17.8 dB] Rough 24 [15.1 dB] 66 [10.5 dB]
Spherical coverage Fine 24 [9.8 dB] 66 [4.7 dB] Rough 24 [1.0 dB] 66 Not
usable
Note that these are UE baseband SNR values, so the Reference point figures
used in RRM test cases may be 1dB higher. Values are based on UE parameters
and currently foreseen test equipment limitations, and could be improved in
future.

The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated by
the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise provided by
the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and potentially
limiting the testable SNR range.
For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set much
higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible. However for
over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically be delivered into
the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test point is likely to be
closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation is allowable.

### B.3.1.4 Measurement error contribution descriptions
#### B.3.1.4.1 gNB emulator SNR uncertainty
This contribution originates from setting the ratio of signal and noise in the
conducted part of the test system. It is estimated to be the same as for LTE
conducted testing in TS 36.521-1 Annex F, which is ±0.3dB. The default for
values in 36.521-1 Annex F is 95% confidence interval, normal distribution.
#### B.3.1.4.2 gNB emulator Downlink EVM
When simulations of demodulation performance are run, the downlink signal is
modelled with a defined EVM, representing imperfections in the signal
transmitted by the gNB. This EVM value is agreed across companies to align
simulations, and is normally lower than the gNB EVM requirement, to represent
\"typical\" conditions. The EVM used for simulations is therefore built in to
the requirement points, normally specified as the SNR required to meet a
specified throughput, with a defined modulation and Reference channel, under
defined propagation conditions.
For a conformance test, the EVM defined for the simulations is taken as a
maximum allowed value for the test system, as a worse gNB emulator EVM would
make the signal harder to demodulate, and disadvantage the UE. In a test
system the EVM cannot normally be set to a specific value, but is specified to
be no higher than a defined value.
Following this approach, the uncertainty from gNB emulator Downlink EVM is a
one-sided distribution, with beneficial effect. Without treating the positive
and negative uncertainties separately, and as it would not make the SNR worse,
the effective uncertainty is 0dB.
#### B.3.1.4.3 gNB emulator fading model impairments
This contribution originates from imperfections in the gNB emulator fading
model, compared to the applied fading model. It is estimated to be the same as
for LTE conducted testing in TS 36.521-1 Annex F, which is ±0.5dB. The default
for values in 36.521-1 Annex F is 95% confidence interval, normal
distribution.
### B.3.1.5 Assessment of testable DL SNR range and accuracy for D=15cm
The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated by
the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise provided by
the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and potentially
limiting the testable SNR range. The calculations and graphs in this clause
allow this SNR degradation to be assessed over a range of scenarios.
For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set much
higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible. However for
over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically be delivered into
the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test point is likely to be
closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation is allowable.
#### B.3.1.5.1 Method and Parameters
The method is the same as B.2.1.5.1, but some values related to the test
system are different, and provided in Table B.3.1.5.1-1. The calculation of
noise level is in clause 7.2.1.3.

B.3.1.5.4 SNR range for SNR~RP~ - SNR~BB~ ≤ 1dB
Based on the method of setting the noise from the Test system to give a
maximum of 1dB degradation in overall SNR between reference point and
baseband, we can then work back through the signal chain to determine how high
the SNR can be set. As the noise is set to a fixed level, the maximum SNR is
set by the test system power amplifier and the channel bandwidth to be tested.
The SNR upper bound depends on the type of test system. For the Direct Near
field (DNF) setup the diagram below illustrates the principle, and is based on
the \"DNF 100MHz\" tab of the accompanying spreadsheet.
The process works back through the signal chain, from left to right in the
diagram.
Figure B.3.1.5.4-1: Estimation of single band UE SNR range for Direct near
field (DNF)
The test equipment must supply at least the wanted noise level at the
reference point. If the noise was lower, the degradation in SNR would be
greater than 1dB, and may cause a conformant UE to fail.
The accuracy of setting the signal and noise levels has been taken as
+/-[6.0]dB. The uncertainty is subject to further analysis by RAN5.
During conformance test, the test system will need to find the UE Rx beam
peak. At present an allowance of [0.5] dB has been included, but is subject to
further analysis by RAN5.
Inclusion of these two contributions directly reduces the maximum SNR that can
be measured by a test system for a given channel bandwidth. To find the
maximum SNR that can be measured by a test system with a specific Channel BW,
the baseband SNR in the spreadsheet is increased until the value \"Wanted
signal + headroom, dBm/Ch BW\" is just below the \"TE Power amplifier 1dB
compression, dBm\" value. The resulting values are given in Table B.3.1.5.4-1.
Single band UE values are obtained by setting the UE multi-band relaxation
factor to 0 dB.

used in TS 38.101-4 [18] will be 1 dB higher. Values are based on UE
parameters and currently foreseen test equipment limitations, and could be
improved in future.
Note that for the DNF method, values may need to be adjusted to take account
of near-field effects.

#### B.3.3.5.1 Method and Parameters
The method is the same as B.2.1.5.1, but the values related to the test system
are different. The calculation of noise level is in clause 7.2.1.3.
#### B.3.3.5.2 Void
#### B.3.3.5.3 Void
#### B.3.3.5.4 SNR range for SNR~RP~ - SNR~BB~ ≤ 1dB
Based on the method of setting the noise from the Test system to give a
maximum of 1dB degradation in overall SNR between reference point and
baseband, we can then work back through the signal chain to determine how high
the SNR can be set. As the noise is set to a fixed level, the maximum SNR is
set by the test system power amplifier and the channel bandwidth to be tested.
The SNR upper bound depends on the type of test system. For the Indirect Far
field (IFF) setup the diagram below illustrates the principle, and is based on
the \"IFF 100MHz\" tab of the accompanying spreadsheet.
The process works back through the signal chain, from left to right in the
diagram.
Figure B.3.3.5.4-1: Estimation of single band UE SNR range for Indirect far
field (IFF)
The test equipment must supply at least the wanted noise level at the
reference point. If the noise was lower, the degradation in SNR would be
greater than 1dB, and may cause a conformant UE to fail.
The accuracy of setting the signal and noise levels has been taken as
+/-[6.0]dB. The uncertainty is subject to further analysis by RAN5.
During conformance test, the test system will need to find the UE Rx beam
peak. At present an allowance of [0.5] dB has been included, but is subject to
further analysis by RAN5.
Inclusion of these two contributions directly reduces the maximum SNR that can
be measured by a test system for a given channel bandwidth. To find the
maximum SNR that can be measured by a test system with a specific Channel BW,
the baseband SNR in the spreadsheet is increased until the value \"Wanted
signal + headroom, dBm/Ch BW\" is just below the \"TE Power amplifier 1dB
compression, dBm\" value. The resulting values are given in Table B.3.3.5.4-1.
Single band UE values are obtained by setting the UE multi-band relaxation
factor to 0 dB.

###### ## Annex C: UE coordinate system
# C.1 Reference coordinate system
This annex defines the measurement coordinate system for the NR UE. The
reference coordinate system as defined in [20] is provided in Figure C.1-1
below while Figure C.1.-2 shows the DUT in the default alignment, i.e., the
DUT and the reference coordinate systems are aligned with α = 0^o^ and β =
0^o^ and γ = 0^o^ where α, β, and γ describe the relative angles between the
two coordinate systems.

Figure C.1-2: DUT default alignment to coordinate system
The following aspects are necessary:
\- A basic understanding of the top and bottom of the device is needed in
order to define unambiguous DUT positioning requirements for the test, e.g.,
in the drawings used in this annex, the three buttons are on the bottom of the
device (front) and the camera is on the top of the device (back).
\- An understanding of the origin and alignment the coordinate system inside
the test system, i.e. the directions in which the x, y, z axes point inside
the test chamber, is needed in order to define unambiguous DUT orientation,
DUT beam, signal, interference, and measurement angles.
# C.2 Test conditions and angle definitions
Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 below provide the test conditions and angle
definitions for three permitted device alignment for the default test
condition, DUT orientation 1, and two different options for each permitted
device alignment to re-position the device for DUT Orientation 2 as outlined
in Figures C.2-1 and C.2-3.

For each UE requirement and test case, each of the parameters in Tables C.2-1
through C.2-3 need to be recorded, such that DUT positioning, DUT beam
direction, and angles of the signal, link/interferer, and measurement are
specified in terms of the fixed coordinate system.
Due to the non-commutative nature of rotations, the order of rotations is
important and needs to be defined when multiple DUT orientations are tested.
The rotations around the x, y, and z axes can be defined with the following
rotation matrices
and
.
with the respective angles of rotation, _α_ , _β_ , _γ_ and
Additionally, any translation of the DUT can be defined with the translation
matrix
with offsets t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively and with
The combination of rotations and translation is captured by the multiplication
of rotation and translation matrices.
For instance, the matrix M
{width="2.611111111111111in" height="0.3125in"}
describes an initial rotation of the DUT around the x axis with angle _α_ , a
subsequent rotation around the y axis with angle _β_ , and a final rotation
around the z axis with angle _γ_. After those rotations, the DUT is translated
by t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively.
# C.3 DUT positioning guidelines
The centre of the reference coordinate system shall be aligned with the
geometric centre of the DUT in order to minimize the offset between antenna
arrays integrated at any position of the UE and the centre of the quiet zone.
Near-field coupling effects between the antenna and the
pedestals/positioners/fixtures generally cause increased signal ripples. Re-
positioning the DUT by directing the beam peak away from those areas can
reduce the effect of signal ripple on EIRP/EIS measurements. Figure C.3-1 and
C.3-2 illustrate how to reposition the DUT in distributed axes and combined
axes system, when the beam peak is directed to the DUTs upper hemisphere (DUT
orientation 1) or the DUTs lower hemisphere (DUT orientation 2). While these
figures are examples of different positioning systems and other
implementations are not precluded, the relative orientation of the coordinate
system with respect to the antennas/reflectors and the axes of rotation shall
apply to any measurement setup.

{width="6.6875in" height="2.5833333333333335in"}
Figure C.3-2: DUT re-positioning for an example of combined-axes system
For EIRP/EIS measurements, re-positioning the DUT makes sure the pedestal is
not obstructing the beam path and that the pedestal is not in closer proximity
to the measurement antenna/reflector than the DUT. For TRP measurements, re-
positioning the DUT makes sure that the beam peak direction is not obstructed
by the pedestal and the pedestal is in the measurement path only when
measuring the back-hemisphere. No re-positioning during the TRP measurement is
required.
###### ## Annex D: Quality of the quiet zone validation
# D.1 General
This annex describes the procedures for validating the quality of the quiet
zone for the permitted far-field methods outlined in clause 5.2.1 (DFF), in
clause 5.2.2 (simplified DFF), and in clause 5.2.3 (IFF).
# D.2 Procedure to characterize the quality of the quiet zone for the
permitted far field methods
This procedure is mandatory before the test system is commissioned for
certification tests and characterizes the quiet zone performance of the
anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of reflections within the anechoic
chamber including any positioners and support structures. Additionally, it
includes the effect of offsetting the directive antenna array inside a DUT
from the centre of the quiet zone, i.e., the centre of rotation of the DUT and
measurement antenna positioning systems as well as the directivity MU, i.e.,
the variation of antenna gains in the different direct line-of-sight links.
The quiet zone is illustrated in Figure D.2-1 which includes the definitions
of centre of quiet zone range, i.e., the geometric centre of the positioning
systems, and the range length, i.e., the distance between the centre of the
quiet zone and the aperture of the measurement antenna.
{width="5.0in" height="2.2916666666666665in"}
Figure D.2-1: Quiet Zone Illustration
The outcome of the procedures can be used to predict the
\- variation of the TRP measurements, spherical surface integrals of EIRP/EIS,
when the DUT is placed anywhere within the quiet zone and with the beam formed
in any arbitrary direction inside the chamber
\- variation of the EIRP/EIS measurements when the DUT is placed anywhere
within the quiet zone and with the beam formed in any arbitrary direction
inside the chamber
The reference coordinate system defined in Appendix C applies to this
procedure.
## D.2.1 Equipment used
The reference antenna under test (AUT) that is placed at various locations
within the quiet zone shall be a directive antenna with similar properties of
typical antenna arrays integrated in DUTs. The characteristics in terms of
Directivity and Half Power Beamwidth (HPBW) of the reference AUT are shown in
Figure D.2.1-1, D.2.1-2, and D.2.1-3.

Figure D.2.1-3: 2xHPBW-H mask
AUT shall be symmetric on E and H planes.
The above masks for the reference antenna are met based on antenna vendors'
calibration report.
For the measurement, a combination of signal generator and spectrum analyser
or a network analyser can be used. The multi-port (with three ports) network
analyser is most suitable to reduce test time as both polarizations of the
measurement antenna can be measured simultaneously and multiple frequencies
can be measured in a sweep.
## D.2.2 Test frequencies
The frequencies to be used to characterize the quality of the quiet zone shall
be identified during final test method definition in RAN5 WG. The quiet zone
validation analysis is performed for each frequency individually.
## D.2.3 Reference measurements
The quality of the quiet measurements for integrated RF parameters such as TRP
shall use 3D pattern measurements of the reference antenna patterns as they
most closely resemble the 3D/spherical surface measurements/integrals of EIRP
or EIS. Therefore, the quality of the quiet zone measurements for TRP metrics
shall be based on efficiency measurements. On the other hand, the quality of
the quiet zone measurements for single-directional EIRP and EIS metrics shall
be based on gain measurements of the direct line-of-sight link between the
reference AUT and the measurement antenna.
The grid types for the TRP measurements shall match those outlined in G.1.2
and the minimum number of grid points (including quadratures for constant step
size grids and implementation of constant density grids) shall meet the 0.25
dB maximum standard uncertainty summarized in G.1.4.
## D.2.4 Size of the quiet zone
The size of the quiet zone within which the variations of measurements are
evaluated depends on the size of the DUT. For smartphones, the quiet zone
shall be considered a sphere with radius of R=7.5cm. . For larger smartphones
and tablet type devices, the quiet zone shall be considered a sphere with
radius of R=15cm. Alternate quiet zone sizes can be defined for even larger
DUTs.
The quality of quiet zone procedure for systems supporting larger quiet zone
sizes can be performed for the largest quiet zone radius only and the results
can be applied to the smaller quiet zone radius. Performing separate sets of
quality of quiet zone measurements for different radii is not precluded.
## D.2.5 Minimum range length
The minimum range length depends on the size of the DUT and the minimum far-
field distance of typical antenna arrays integrated in DUTs.
## D.2.6 Reference AUT positions
The reference AUT shall be positioned in a total of 7 different reference
positions, shown in Figure D.2.6.1-1 and D.2.6.2-1
While position 1, P1, is the centre of the quiet zone, the remaining
positions, 2 through 7, are off-centre positions each displaced by the radius
of the quiet zone, R. The coordinates of the respective test points are shown
in Table D.2.6-1.

## D.2.7 Reference AUT orientations
As different areas within the chamber could yield variations in the field
uniformity inside the quiet zone caused by reflections, it is important to
characterize the electromagnetic fields with the reference antennas uniformly
illuminating the anechoic chamber.
### D.2.7.1 Distributed-axes system
In order to keep the quality of the quiet zone characterization manageable in
terms of test times, it is suggested to perform the reference measurements for
the reference AUT placed at the 7 antenna positions with the antenna rotated
around the y axis with 5 different angles _β_ , i.e., _β_ = 0^o^, 45^o^,
90^o^, 135^o^, and 180^o^, and rotated around the z axis with 8 different _γ *
= 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 135^o^, 180^o^, 225^o^, 270^o^, and 315^o^. A graphical
illustration of the some sample reference AUT orientations is shown in Figure
D.2.7.1-1 with a reference AUT placed at position 6, P6, for reference antenna
polarization_ γ _~pol~ = 0^o^; Figure D.2.7.1-2 illustrates the reference AUT
orientations for the reference polarization_ γ*~pol~ = 90^o^.
The matrix operation for the rotations and translation is defined as
for the distributed-axes system.

Figure D.2.7.1-2: Sample reference AUT orientations for position 6, P6, for
reference antenna polarization γ~pol~ = 90^o^.
When facing the z-axis, _β_ = 0^o^ and _β_ = 180^o^, the antenna does not need
to be evaluated for the 8 different rotations around the z axis. A single
orientation is sufficient since those orientations are unique. Due to the
pedestal, distributed-axes systems are not able to measure towards the _β_
=180^o^ direction; for those systems, the reference measurements at this
reference AUT orientation can be skipped.
If the device re-positioning approach outlined in Annex C.3 is adopted for the
EIRP/EIS/TRP based conformance test cases, the quality of quiet zone analysis
is sufficient only for *β * = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^~.~
### D.2.7.2 Combined-axes system
In order to keep the quality of the quiet zone characterization manageable in
terms of test times, it is suggested to perform the reference measurements for
the reference AUT placed at the 7 antenna positions with the antenna rotated
around the x axis with 5 different angles α, i.e., α = -90^o^, -45^o^, 0^o^,
45^o^, and 90^o^ and rotated around the y axis with 8 different angles _β_ =
0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 135^o^, 180^o^, 225^o^, 270^o^, and 315^o^. A graphical
illustration of some sample reference AUT orientations is shown in Figure
D.2.7.2-1 with a reference AUT placed at position 4, P4, for reference antenna
polarization _γ_ ~pol~ = 0^o^; Figure D.2.7.2-2 illustrates the reference AUT
orientations for the reference polarization _γ_ ~pol~ = 90^o^.
The matrix operation for the rotations and translation is defined as
for the combined-axes system.

Figure D.2.7.2-2: Sample reference AUT orientations for position 4, P4, for
reference antenna polarization γ~pol~ = 90^o^.
When facing the y axis, _α_ = 90^o^ and _α_ = -90^o^, the antenna does not
need to be evaluated for the 8 different rotations around the y axis. A single
rotation is sufficient since those orientations are unique. Due to the
pedestal of the 2-axis positioner, combined-axes systems are not able to
measure towards the _β_ = 180^o^ direction; for those systems, the reference
measurements at this reference AUT orientation can be skipped.
If the device re-positioning approach outlined in Annex C.3 is adopted for all
EIRP/EIS/TRP based conformance test cases, the quality of quiet zone analysis
is sufficient only for *β * = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 270^o^, and 315^o^~.~
## D.2.8 Quality of quiet zone measurement uncertainty calculations for TRP
The combined MU element related to the quality of the quiet zone for TRP and
offset between UE antenna array and centre of quiet zone is the standard
deviation of the various efficiency measurement results that are based on the
7 different reference AUT positions, the respective reference AUT
orientations, and the two reference AUT polarization orientations..
## D.2.9 Quality of quiet zone measurement uncertainty for EIRP/EIS
The MU for the quality of the quiet zone for EIRP/EIS includes the additional
MU element of the directivity of the DUT and measurement antennas as shown in
Figure D.2.9-1. The EIRP/EIS measurements are taking the peak gains of the
respective antennas into account with the reference AUT placed in the centre
of the quiet zone. Once the antenna is displaced in directions other than the
measurement antenna, the direct line-of-sight link is taking reduced antenna
gains into account. The type of reference AUT should therefore have similar
pattern properties as typical UE antennas. For systems with very large range
lengths, the directivity MU will be insignificant.
The combined MU element related to the quality of the quiet zone for EIRP/EIS,
offset between UE antenna array and centre of quiet zone, and directivity is
the standard deviation of the single-point gain measurement results that are
based on the 7 different reference AUT positions, the respective reference AUT
orientations, and the two reference AUT polarization orientations.

###### ## Annex E: Rationale behind IFF method 1
# E.1 IFF method 1 -- working principle
A CATR (Compact Antenna Test Range) is a collimator system in which the
spherical wave is transformed in plane wave within the desired quiet zone
(QZ). In other words, a compact range project the measurement (range) antenna
infinitely far away thus making it a far-field range. Figure E.1-1 does show
this concept:
{width="2.986111111111111in" height="3.0in"}{width="3.236111111111111in"
height="2.5in"}
Figure E.1-1: Compact Range -- working principle
This is a reciprocal system setup. For TX measurements, the device under test
will radiate a spherical wavefront to the range collimator which focalises
into the feed antenna only the propagation vector which matches with the
boresight direction of the reflector. On the other hand, for RX measurements,
the feed antenna would radiate a spherical wavefront to the range reflector
which is collimated towards the DUT. In other words, the spherical wavefront
is transformed into a plane wavefront when at the DUT.
In order to meet the requirements, the following parameters are mainly
considered when designing a CATR:
\- Quiet Zone
\- Focal length
\- Offset angle
\- Feed location
Figure E.1-2 does introduce the concept of quiet zone (QZ). Basically, the
plane wavefront (uniform amplitude and phase) is guaranteed in a certain
cylinder volume:
{width="3.3333333333333335in" height="3.0in"}
Figure E.1-2: CATR -- Quiet Zone concept
Quiet Zone size would depend on mainly the reflector, feed taper, anechoic
chamber design. In figure E.1-3 is shown the phase distribution in the QZ for
a state of the art CATR designed for 3m QZ size at 18GHz:
{width="5.236111111111111in" height="3.0in"}
Figure E.1-3: Phase curvature within the CATR QZ
It has to be noted that the total phase variation in the QZ for a CATR is much
lower than the phase variation (22.5deg) for a typical direct FF range.
# E.2 IFF method 1 - a far field system
In this clause the CATR key points are reported.
## E.2.1 Quiet zone
Quiet zone quality can be impacted by amplitude uniformity, phase planarity
and polarization purity.
Amplitude uniformity is mainly due to feed pattern, alignment and reflector
design while phase planarity is due to feed alignment and reflector design.
The polarization purity is mainly due to the parabolic system geometry
considering high polarization purity feeds.
The test procedure defined in TR 38.810 Annex D.2 for determining the MU
contribution from the quiet zone quality applies equally well to both direct
far-field and CATR systems.
Plots in Figure E.2.1-1 and E.2.1-2 show the amplitude and phase taper plots
of the in the quiet zone of a CATR system.

Figure E.2.1-2 that
\- The overall amplitude variation within the quiet zone is less than 1.2 dB
\- The overall phase variation within the quiet zone is less than 10˚
## E.2.2 Implementation Requirements
When it comes of CATR implementations, the reflector design is one of the key
point to be considered. Another important piece is the feed antenna location
in the system setup. Different implementations may exist based on the test
system frequency range and quite zone requirements.
### E.2.2.1 Reflector(s) Type
The reflector design does play an important role when designing a CATR.
A Compact Range is a geometrical optical design, for which the reflector(s) is
large in wavelength. Edges diffraction (edges are like cylindrical sources)
needs to be minimized using edge treatment.
The lower frequency limit of a compact range depends on the edge treatment.
The Quality of the Quiet Zone is characterized for CATR ranges and always
includes the reflections off the edges of the reflector. The example
specifications for a CATR system can be seen in Table E.2.2.1-1. These
specifications should show that the impact of these reflections is minor. In
order to meet such specifications, the reflector must be designed in a way to
reduce the reflection off the edges (the edges are either curved or have
serrated edges).
Table E.2.2.1-1: Example of CATR system specifications
Frequency Range (GHz) 1.5 -- 100
* * *
Quiet Zone Dimensions [H x W x L] (m) 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 Cross Polarization (dB)
-30
#### E.2.2.1.1 Serrated Edge
The direction of the edge is designed such that minimum diffraction enters the
quiet zone sources. With serrations, there is a smooth transition between
parabolic surface of the reflector and free space, thus reducing the
diffraction effects and directing the diffracted field away from the QZ. The
length of serrations defines the lowest frequency of operation. Typical
serrations length is 5λ.
#### E.2.2.1.2 Rolled edge
The edges of the compact range reflector are no longer cut off abruptly but
are smoothly bent backwards thus reducing the energy at the edges of the
reflector. With well-designed rolled edge, diffraction reduces compared to
serrated edge at the low and middle end of the frequency spectrum.
### E.2.2.2 Feed Antenna location
The following are the feed locations most commonly used when designing a CATR:
\- Side-fed
\- Floor-fed
\- Diagonal-fed
For a side-fed system, the feed is placed on one side of the chamber at the
same height as the centre of the quiet zone so that the ray from the feed to
the reflector to the centre of the quiet zone spans a horizontal plane. For a
floor-fed system, the feed in placed on the floor between the reflector and
the quiet zone so that the ray from the feed to reflector to the centre of the
quite zone spans a vertical plane. In case of diagonal-fed (corner-fed)
system, the feed is in a corner between side wall and floor so that the ray
from the feed to the reflector to the centre of the quiet zone spans a
diagonal plane. Typically the diagonal fed-system allows for size reduction of
the anechoic chamber of approximately √2.
# E.3 IFF method 1 -- reciprocity
CATR systems are inherently reciprocal, i.e. they support device
characterization in both transmit and receive modes and it has been already
used as such within 3GPP: TR 37.842 for testing active antenna systems
describes base station conformance testing for radiated transmit power (EIRP)
in clause 10.3.1 as well as for OTA sensitivity (EIS) in clause 10.3.2.
The theoretical analysis behind this statement can be as follows:
C.A. Balanis (in his book \"Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design,\" Ch. 3, pp.
127-132) provides a thorough discussion of reciprocity and its consequences
for radiation patterns: In brief, it shows that, due to reciprocity, the
antenna patterns measured by a receiving probe antenna with the DUT
transmitting will be identical to those measured by the DUT in receive mode
when the probe antenna is transmitting. It is further explained that
reciprocity holds whenever certain conditions are met, e.g. the device
materials and propagation medium are linear.
These are the conditions met in a CATR:
As the nominally spherical wave from the feed antenna propagates toward the
mirror, it's power density per area, , falls off with the square of the
distance from the feed antenna so that at the mirror,
, (E.3-1)
where is the power transmitted from the feed antenna, is the gain of the feed
antenna, and is approximately the focal length of the mirror. The precise
distance from the feed antenna to the centre of the mirror is typically
slightly longer than the focal length due to the off-axis illumination and
parabolic curvature of the mirror.
does not change as the beam propagates to the DUT since the beam is
collimated. For a DUT in the quiet zone, the power received by the DUT is the
product of and the DUT's effective aperture, . This effective aperture depends
on the orientation of the DUT relative to the beam, indicated by the DUT's
elevation angle, , and its azimuth angle, . The DUT's gain, is related to this
aperture according to the formula
(E.3-2)
Thus, the ratio of received power to transmitted power, is
(E.3-3)
From this derivation, it is clear that the path-loss for a CATR does not
depend on the total distance between the feed antenna and the DUT but on the
focal length of the mirror instead.
Less intuitive is the derivation of the path loss when the DUT is in transmit
mode. In that case, the DUT's radiation pattern can be treated as a
superposition of plane waves propagating in different directions. This
superposition concept is valid whether the mirror is in the near or far-field
of the DUT. As shown in Figure E.3.1-1, the mirror captures plane waves
propagating in a range of directions, but the different directions are focused
to different points by the mirror. Only those plane waves propagating along
the optical axis of the mirror (indicated in pink) are focused into the feed
antenna for measurement; in this mode, the feed antenna is receiving the
signal from the DUT. Plane waves at larger angles not captured by the mirror
are instead absorbed by the anechoic chamber. The particular angle measured by
the feed antenna can be varied by rotating the DUT. For example, a rotation of
the DUT in this figure could align the blue plane wave with the optical axis
allowing measurement of the transmitted power in that direction.
{width="4.159722222222222in" height="3.3541666666666665in"}
Figure E.3-1: CATR when DUT is in transmit mode
The feed antenna can only capture radiation from the relatively small range of
angles that converge to a point within its aperture. The maximum angular
deviation from the optical axis that can be accepted by the feed antenna is
given by
$\tan\left( \varphi_{\max} \right) \approx \varphi_{\max} = \frac{r}{f}$
(E.3-4)
where is the radius of the aperture, is the focal length of the mirror, and
the small angle approximation - a very good approximation for typical CATR
geometries - has been invoked for simplicity.
The radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle), , emitted by the DUT is
the total power emitted divided by radians and multiplied by the gain of the
DUT;
(E.3-5)
The total power accepted by feed antenna is the integral of over the range of
angles that converge within its aperture. Using the small angle approximation,
the integral gives
(E.3-6)
Substituting for using (4), and with the aperture of the feed antenna as , the
ratio of power received by the feed antenna to power transmitted by the DUT is
(E.3-7)
Equation (7) shows that the transmission losses from the DUT to the feed are
identical to the transmission losses from the feed to the DUT, given by Eq.
(3), thus proving reciprocity.
This reciprocity result, which holds true regardless of DUT orientation,
assures identical antenna pattern measurements for DUTs in both transmit and
receive modes. Beyond pattern measurements, this result also has implications
for other device tests. EIRP and EIS tests are both possible in a CATR system
as the same path losses are present in both directions. Likewise, EVM in
transmit and receive are supported since both will experience the same
predicted path losses given in Eqs. (7) and (3).
Reporting measurement results in order to further detail the reciprocity of a
CATR by showing the comparison between the s12, and s21 coefficients of the
scattering matrix have been obtained as follows:
\- Measurement results are from a commercial CATR at mmWave. This range is
capable of measuring DUTs within 24GHz to 40GHz frequency range. The CATR is
designed for a 1.5m QZ and the results are from a QZ ripple test (field
distribution) activity done on the setup. In figure E.3-2 the QZ ripple test
setup is shown:
{width="4.888888888888889in" height="3.2222222222222223in"}
Figure E.3-2: CATR- QZ ripple test (field distribution) set up
\- A Standard Gain Horn (SGH) is used as reference antenna. Since it is a
field distribution measurement where the ability of the CATR to emulate a
plane wave in the QZ is tested, for all the measurements the SGH aperture was
pointing the CATR's reflector. The reference antenna has been swept on the X
and Y-axis when at different Z positions. Especially, Vertical cut means that
the scan is done long the Y-axis while Horizontal Cut means that the scan is
long the X-axis. In both cases, Vertical and Horizontal components of the
field are measured in amplitude, and phase (complex quantity). The aim is to
define the amplitude and phase taper in the QZ. For our measurements, s21 and
s12 coefficients have been measured and compared for each Y axis positions
(Vertical Cut) when the SGH is at Z=0, centre of the QZ.
\- Comparison between s21 and s12 complex coefficients (amplitude and phase)
is reported for 26.5GHz and Vertical Cut. Figure E.3.1-3 and E.3.1-4 show the
reciprocity in terms of amplitude and phase

# E.4 IFF method 1 -- DUT offset from the QZ centre
The uncertainty due to the DUT offset from the QZ centre can vary based on the
knowledge of antenna array position embedded in the DUT. In this clause, an
analysis of the impact of this uncertainty for CATR is provided when measuring
single points quantities such as both EIRP (TX measurements) and EIS (RX
measurements).
In figure E.4-1, and E.4-2 the test scenarios A1 and A2 are reported for RX
tests and TX tests respectively:
{width="6.847222222222222in" height="2.0902777777777777in"}
Figure E.4-1: CATR -- RX tests scenarios A1 and A2
The QZ is within the collimated beam. There are no free space losses between
the reflector and DUT. The only path loss is between the feed and the
reflector so since this distance is fixed, this path loss can be easily
calibrated. The final spatial attenuation is equal to 1/F~L,eff~\^2, where
F~L,eff~=effective focal length =(2*F~L~)/(1+cos(offset)). It means that the
distance from the QZ to the reflector is longer than the F~L~=focal length. In
a state of the art CATR, the offset is typically set to 27deg by design, so
that the F~L,eff~=1.058*F~L~.
As a consequence of this, if DUT is moved within the QZ, there is no change in
the path loss so the power received in A1 is equal to power received in A2.
The associated uncertainty is then 0dB.
However, due to diffraction from the reflector, the field distribution in the
Quiet Zone is not perfectly uniform. Therefore, there will be some variation
for the amplitude and phase of the received field. Typical amplitude
variations are less than 1 dB within the Quiet Zone and can be estimated by
the QZ characterization process.
{width="6.847222222222222in" height="2.0625in"}
Figure E.4-2: CATR -- TX tests scenarios A1 and A2
The following assumptions can be considered:
\- Reciprocity
\- For a CATR the reciprocity is valid
\- Path loss calculation is identical to the RX case
\- DUT will have a radiation pattern which can be described as a series of
plane wave propagating in different directions. The particular plane wave
propagating along the reflector centreline will be focused on the reflector
feed. Figure E.4-3 does show this:
{width="5.895833333333333in" height="3.1041666666666665in"}
Figure E.4-3: CATR -- Radiation Pattern measurement when TX by DUT
\- By rotating the DUT in the QZ, the reflector moves a particular point of
the FF pattern along the CATR feed
\- No matter what the distances from the reflector are, the power received
from the feed is the same.
\- The final spatial attenuation at the feed is equal to 1/F~L,eff~\^2, where
F~L,eff~=effective focal length.
Based on the above assumptions the associated uncertainty is 0dB.
To better understand the above, mainly for the TX case -- DUT transmitting, in
Figure E.4-4 the CATR power transfer function is given:
{width="5.201388888888889in" height="2.3055555555555554in"}
Figure E.4-4: CATR -- Power Transfer Function
Blue and Red lines are representing the DUT receiving and transmitting
respectively. It is assumed that all sources are isotropic point sources. This
assumption can be generalized to real sources since any real source can be
expanded in a number of isotropic sources.
When transmitting from the QZ (TX case -- DUT transmitting) the spherical
wavefront is imaged by the lens/reflector in the focal point with the general
magnification factor so that the below equations are valid:
\- Loss up to the reflector -> 1/R\^2
\- Gain up to the reflector -> (R/F~L,eff~)\^2 -> magnification factor
(R/F~L,eff~) where F~L,eff~=effective focal length
\- Total gain -> 1/R\^2*(R/F~L,eff~)\^2=1/F~L,eff~\^2
When transmitting from the focal point -- Fp (RX case -- DUT receiving) the
spherical wavefront from the feed is become a \"perfect\" plane wave after the
lens/reflector. The final attenuation is equal to 1/F~L,eff~\^2.
It was shown that in both cases the attenuation in the system is proportional
to the free space path loss provided by the distance from the feed and
lens/reflector. The attenuation is independent from the distance to the QZ.

Figure E.5-1. Example frequency specification for a CATR
# E.6 IFF method 1 -- positioning system
CATR is provided with a positioning system such that the angle between the
dual-polarized measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of
freedom and maintains a polarization reference. In the CATR case, positioner
is placed at the quiet zone area where the DUT is.
# E.7 IFF method 1 -- link antennas
CATR for NR RF FR2 requirements includes a NR link antenna to allow off centre
beam measurements. Together with the UE beam lock test function, this link
antenna allows to measure the whole radiation pattern.
The way it is used is described below:
\- Before performing the UE beam lock test function, the measurement probe
acts as a link antenna maintaining polarization reference with respect to the
DUT. Once the beam is locked then the link is to be passed to the link antenna
which maintains reliable signal level with respect to the DUT. Then UE can be
rotated to measure the whole radiation pattern without losing the connection
with the system simulator.
Hence, thanks to the link antennas and the UE Beam lock test function, CATR is
capable of centre and off centre of beam measurements.
Additionally, for setups intended for measurements of UE RF characteristics in
non-standalone (NSA) mode with 1UL configuration, an LTE link antenna is used
to provide the LTE link to the DUT
\- The LTE link antenna provides a stable LTE signal without precise path loss
or polarization control
CATR is provided with such LTE link antenna.
###### ## Annex F: Rationale behind NFTF method
# F.1 NFTF method -- working principle
A NFTF (Near Field to Far Field Transform) system measures the amplitude and
phase on a surface (spherical in this case) around he DUT. The 3D far field
pattern is obtained by using a modal spherical wave expansion. The Near Field
to Far Field Transform is based on the Huygen's principle. A direct solution
of the Helmholtz equations is found by applying boundary conditions on the
surface at an infinite distance away from the DUT. From the tangential fields
over the surface, the modal coefficients can be determined using the
orthogonality of the modal expansion.
The Near to Far field transform is performed in two steps:
\- Expansion (or projection) of the measured Near Field over a set of
orthogonal basis functions to evaluate the transformed spectrum
> _E~meas~(r) = Spectrum * F~basis~(r)_
\- FF (EFF) computation using a the previously calculated spectrum and with
the basis functions evaluated at r∞ :
> _E~FF~ = Spectrum * F~basis~(r∞)_
The Nyquist sampling criterion must be met to obtain enough measurement points
for the near field to far field transform to be valid. The equations for the
sampling criterion are below:
{width="1.0in" height="0.5465277777777777in"}{width="4.0in"
height="3.5555555555555554in"}
Figure F.1-1: Sampling Criterion
The method outlined above is normally performed on antennas which are fed from
a signal source but can also apply to DUTs which are transmitting by using the
phase recovery technique.
# F.2 NFTF -- Spherical Scan
A circular probe array as shown in Figure F.3-1 can measure the full 3D
pattern with a rotation in azimuth only. Through use of electronic switching
between the probe array elements the points in elevation can be measured
without rotating the DUT in the elevation plane. Alternatively, by connecting
each probe to a receiver, it is possible to simultaneously measure the points
in elevation without the need to rotate the DUT in the elevation plane.
# F.3 NFTF -- Implementation for Self-Transmitting DUTs
## F.3.1 Phase Recovery Technique
{width="6.395833333333333in" height="3.625in"}
Figure F.3-1: Typical Test System using Phase Recovery Technique
Figure F.3-1 shows the block diagram of a Near Field Range with the Phase
Recovery Unit.
The technique is based on the synchronous reception of two signals, the
measurement and reference. The signal transmitted by the DUT is measured
simultaneously with two probes, one being the measurement probe and the other
being the reference probe. These two signals are fed into the PRU (Phase
Recovery Unit) and the amplitude and absolute phase are acquired.
## F.3.2 Obtaining EIRP and TRP
During the near field to far field transformation process, the calibration is
applied so that the transmitted power (EIRP) is transformed from dB to dBm.
Because the full 3D pattern is measured the TRP can be calculated using the
EIRP results. The EIRP results at beam peak can be also easily obtained.
# F.4 NFTF -- Measurement Uncertainty due to Phase Variation
During the near field to far field transform the DUT's offset from the
reference coordinate system is corrected for. This is can be achieved because
the absolute phase is measured.
{width="3.3680555555555554in" height="2.0in"} {width="3.0069444444444446in"
height="2.0in"}
Figure F.4-1: Spherical Wave Coefficients (SWC) graphical representation
Figure 4.1 shows the Spherical Wave Coefficients of a horn measured at three
different distances away from the center of the reference coordinate system.
As can be seen in the figures:
\- The DUT far field pattern remains the same
\- The DUT far field phase changes with a vector component defined by the
displacement of the reference coordinate system
\- The number of spherical wave that are needed to fully represent the antenna
increases as the DUT moves further away from the center of the reference
coordinate system.
\- As the minimum sphere increases the number of field samples increases.
If the criteria above are respected during the near field acquisition, there
is no uncertainty due to the DUT offset from the reference coordinate system
(center of the QZ).
###### ## Annex G: Measurement Grids
This appendix describes the assumptions and definition of the minimum number
of measurement grid points for various grid types.
A total of three measurement grids are considered:
\- Beam Peak Search Grid: using this grid, the TX and RX beam peak direction
will be determined. 3D EIRP scans are used to determine the TX beam peak
direction and 3D Throughput/RSRP/EIS scans for RX beam peak directions.
\- Spherical Coverage Grid: using this grid, the CDF of the EIRP/EIS
distribution in 3D is calculated to determine the spherical coverage
performance.
\- TRP Measurement Grid: using this grid, the total power radiated by the DUT
in the TX beam peak direction is determined by integrating the EIRP
measurements taken on the sampling grid.
# G.1 TRP Measurement Grids
This sub-clause describes the assumptions and derives the minimum number of
TRP measurement grid points for various grid types.
## G.1.1 Assumptions
For non-sparse antenna arrays used for smartphone UEs, an 8 x 2 antenna array
was used for the measurement grid analyses. Table G.1.1-1 and Table G.1.1-2
outline the adapted equations from [9] that are used to simulate the UE
antenna patterns for in-band measurements.

The relative orientation of the simulated antenna array and the measurement
grid is altered randomly and the standard deviation between TRPs for each
measurement grid is derived from a set of 10000 random orientations.
In Figure G.1.1-2, three rotations used for the simulation analyses are
illustrated, i.e., the antenna pattern are rotated in φ and θ but also along
its beam peak axis.

The randomization of the various rotations is illustrated in Figure G.1.1-3.
The rotations in φ and α can be handled in a completely random fashion, e.g.,
phi_rot = 360*rand(10000,1). For the rotations around θ, the number of
rotations near the poles should be the same compared to the equator since the
surface area near the poles is much smaller than around the equator, i.e., the
distribution needs to be scaled by sin(θ).

## G.1.2 TRP Integration for Constant Step Size Grid Type
Different approaches to perform the TRP integration from the respective EIRP
measurements are outlined in the next sub clauses for the constant step size
grid type.
### G.1.2.1 TRP Integration using Weights
In many engineering disciplines, the integral of a function needs to be solved
using numerical integration techniques, commonly referred to as
\"quadrature\". Here, the approximation of the integral of a function is
usually stated as a weighted sum of function values at specified points within
the domain of integration. The derivation from the closed surface TRP integral
{width="2.8333333333333335in" height="0.4722222222222222in"}
to the classical discretized summation equation used for OTA
{width="5.416666666666667in" height="0.6111111111111112in"}
has been derived in [15]. The weights for this integral are based on the
sinθ⋅∆θ weights. More accurate implementations are based on the Clenshaw-
Curtis quadrature integral approximation based on an expansion of the
integrand in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This implementation does not
ignore the measurement points at the poles (θ=0^o^ and 180^o^) where sinθ = 0.
The discretized TRP can be expressed as
{width="4.152777777777778in" height="0.6111111111111112in"}
which the sinθ⋅∆θ weights replaced by a weight function W(θ) and extends the
sum over I to include the poles. The Clenshaw-Curtis weights are compared to
the classical sin θ⋅∆θ weights in Tables G.1.2.1-1 and G.1.2.1-2 for two
different numbers of latitudes. The TRP measurement grid consists of N+1
latitudes and M longitudes with
$\theta_{i} = i\mathrm{\Delta}\theta\ \text{where}\ \mathrm{\Delta}\theta =
\frac{\pi}{N}$
and
$\phi_{j} = j\mathrm{\Delta}\phi\ \text{where}\ \mathrm{\Delta}\phi =
\frac{2\pi}{M}$

### G.1.2.2 TRP Surface Integral using the Jacobian Matrix
Total Radiated Power is given by the integral of the Effective Isotropic
Radiated Power over the closed spherical surface S:
$TRP = ∯_{S}^{}{\frac{EIRP(\overrightarrow{r})}{4\pi\ }\text{\ \ d}S}$
Given any surface parameterization of
$\overrightarrow{r}\left( u_{1},u_{2} \right) = {\lbrack\begin{matrix}
x(u_{1},u_{2}) & y(u_{1},u_{2}) & z(u_{1},u_{2}) \ \end{matrix}\rbrack}^{T}$
The explicit general TRP surface integral is
$TRP = ∯ _{S}^{}{\frac{EIRP(\overrightarrow{r}\left( u_{1},u_{2}
\right))}{4\pi\ }\ \ \bullet \sqrt{det(J^{T}J)} \bullet
\text{du}_{1}}\text{du}_{2}$
where J is the Jacobian Matrix defined at$\text{\ i}$ row and $j$ column is
$\ J_{i,j} = \frac{{\partial r}_{i}}{{\partial x}_{j}}$
The differential surface area element, in its most general form, is
$dS = \sqrt{det(J^{T}J)} \bullet \text{du}_{1}\text{du}_{2}$
The standard surface parameterization used in 3GPP to date is based on the
definition of Spherical Coordinate System parameterization $\left( u_{1} =
\theta,u_{2} = \varnothing \right)\ $on a constant radius sphere where
$\overrightarrow{r}\left( u_{1} = \theta,u_{2} = \varnothing \right) =
\begin{bmatrix} x \ y \ z \ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\sin\theta\cos\varnothing \ \sin\theta\sin\varnothing \ \cos\theta \
\end{bmatrix}$
which yields the Jacobian Matrix
$J = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial x}{\partial\theta} & \frac{\partial
x}{\partial\varnothing} \ \frac{\partial y}{\partial\theta} & \frac{\partial
y}{\partial\varnothing} \ \frac{\partial z}{\partial\theta} & \frac{\partial
z}{\partial\varnothing} \ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos{\theta\cos\varnothing} & {- sin}\theta\sin\varnothing \
\cos\theta\sin\varnothing & \sin\theta\cos\varnothing \ \- \sin\theta & 0 \
\end{bmatrix}$.
Hence, the differential surface area is the familiar
$dS = \sqrt{det(J^{T}J)}d\theta d\varnothing = \sin\theta d\theta
d\varnothing$
The Total Radiated Power under a Spherical Coordinate parameterization is the
familiar 3GPP equation [4][5]
$TRP = ∯_{S}^{}{\frac{EIRP(\theta,\varnothing)}{4\pi\ }\ \ \bullet \sin\theta
\bullet d\theta}d\varnothing$
This form of the integral is exact in the continuous case but prone to
uncertainty for finite discrete uniform grid spacing
$TRP \approx \frac{\pi}{2\ NM}\sum_{i = 1}^{N - 1}{\sum_{j = 0}^{M -
1}{EIRP(\theta_{i},\ \phi_{j})\sin\left( \theta_{i} \right)}}$
The Spherical Coordinate system is not the only possible parameterization of
the surface. One alternative, by definition to alleviate the sin θ = 0
$\sin\theta = 0$problem at the sampling poles, is to consider the surface S as
composed of a set of infinitesimal triangles. This triangulation method is
commonly used in Finite Element Analysis and is based on Barycentric
coordinates. The Barycentric parametrization $\left( u_{1} = \xi,u_{2} = \eta
\right)$ with the domain $\xi \in \left\lbrack 0,1 \right\rbrack$ and $\eta
\in \left\lbrack 0,1 \right\rbrack$ is
$\overrightarrow{r}\left( u_{1} = \xi,u_{2} = \eta \right) = \begin{bmatrix} x
\ y \ z \ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \left( x_{1} - x_{0} \right)\xi +
\left( x_{2} - x_{0} \right)\eta + x_{0} \ \left( y_{1} - y_{0} \right)\xi +
\left( y_{2} - y_{0} \right)\eta + y_{0} \ \left( z_{1} - z_{0} \right)\xi +
\left( z_{2} - z_{0} \right)\eta + z_{0} \ \end{bmatrix}$
The Jacobian Matrix for the Barycentric parameterization is
$J = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial x}{\partial\xi} & \frac{\partial
x}{\partial\eta} \ \frac{\partial y}{\partial\xi} & \frac{\partial
y}{\partial\eta} \ \frac{\partial z}{\partial\xi} & \frac{\partial
z}{\partial\eta} \ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} {\overrightarrow{J}}_{0} &
{\overrightarrow{J}}_{1} \ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \left( x_{1} -
x_{0} \right) & \left( x_{2} - x_{0} \right) \ \left( y_{1} - y_{0} \right) &
\left( y_{2} - y_{0} \right) \ \left( z_{1} - z_{0} \right) & \left( z_{2} -
z_{0} \right) \ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \left(
{\overrightarrow{r}}_{1} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) & \left(
{\overrightarrow{r}}_{2} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) \ \end{bmatrix}$
and by Lagrange\'s identity $\sqrt{det(J^{T}J)} =$ $\left\|
{\overrightarrow{J}}_{0} \times {\overrightarrow{J}}_{1} \right\|$, the
differential surface element is
$dS = \sqrt{det(J^{T}J)}d\text{ξdη} = \left\| \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{1}
- {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) \times \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{2} -
{\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) \right\| d\text{ξdη}$
Hence, the TRP integral expressed in Barycentric coordinates is
$TRP = ∯ _{S}^{}{\frac{EIRP(\xi,\eta)}{4\pi\ }\ \ \bullet \left\| \left(
{\overrightarrow{r}}_{1} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) \times \left(
{\overrightarrow{r}}_{2} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) \right\| \bullet
d\xi}\text{dη}$
and is approximated by the sum over all triangles $\mathrm{\Delta}_{i}$
_composing the closed surface S_
$4\pi TRP \approx \sum_{i}^{}{\int_{\eta = 0}^{1}{\int_{\xi = 0}^{1 -
\eta}{\text{EIRP}_{i}(\xi,\eta)\left\| \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{1,i} -
{\overrightarrow{r}}_{0,i} \right) \times \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{2,i} -
{\overrightarrow{r}}_{0,i} \right) \right\|\text{dξdη}}}}$
The notation of explicitly adding the subscript to the
$\text{EIRP}_{i}(\xi,\eta)$ _explicitly states the double integral of EIRP
over each independent i^th^ triangle_ has the identical bounds of integration;
$\xi = \lbrack 0,1 - \eta\rbrack$ and $\xi = \lbrack 0,1\rbrack$ which is
accomplished by mapping to the standard triangle via a change of coordinates.
In Barycentric coordinates, this coordinate transform is trivially
accomplished knowing only the sample points at the vertices of the triangle as
$\text{EIRP}_{i}(\xi,\eta) = \text{EIRP}_{0,i} + \left( \text{EIRP}_{1,i} -
\text{EIRP}_{0,1} \right)\xi + \left( \text{EIRP}_{2,i} - \text{EIRP}_{0,i}
\right)\eta$
Every EIRP value in the interior of the triangle is computed as
$\text{EIRP}_{i}(\xi,\eta)$ _knowing only the three measured samples
[EIRP~0,i~, EIRP~1,i~, EIRP~2,i~] within the triangle domain_ $\xi = \lbrack
0,1 - \eta\rbrack$ and $\xi = \lbrack 0,1\rbrack$ _as illustrated in Figure
G.1.2.2-1._
{width="6.0in" height="1.6909722222222223in"}
Figure G.1.2.2-1: Illustration of the triangulated sphere including the
triangle formed by three measurements points
The cross product term, ${2A}_{i} \equiv \left\| \left(
{\overrightarrow{r}}_{1,i} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0,i} \right) \times \left(
{\overrightarrow{r}}_{2,i} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0,i} \right) \right\|$, is
constant relative to the integration variables so the TRP approximation
further simplifies to
$4\pi TRP \approx \sum_{i}^{}{{2A}_{i}\int_{\eta = 0}^{1}{\int_{\xi = 0}^{1 -
\eta}{\left\lbrack \text{EIRP}_{0,i} + \left( \text{EIRP}_{1,i} -
\text{EIRP}_{0,1} \right)\xi + \left( \text{EIRP}_{2,i} - \text{EIRP}_{0,i}
\right)\eta \right\rbrack\text{dξdη}}}}$
The double integral therefore is computed explicitly yielding
$4\pi TRP \approx \sum_{i}^{}{2A_{i} \bullet \left( \frac{\text{EIRP}_{0,i} +
\text{EIRP}_{1,i} + \text{EIRP}_{2,i}}{6} \right)\ }$
The final form of the TRP approximation based on Barycentric surface
parameterization is
$TRP \approx \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{i}^{}{A_{i} \bullet \left(
\frac{\text{EIRP}_{0,i} + \text{EIRP}_{1,i} + \text{EIRP}_{2,i}}{3} \right)\
}$
This yields an intuitive geometrical description of TRP approximation as
simply the sum of all discrete triangle areas composing the closed spherical
surface S, with each triangle scaled by the mean value of EIRP at the three
measurement vertices. Guaranteed non-zero terms inside the sum mitigate
possible numerical approximation issue at the poles, unlike the _sin_ θ
$\sin\theta$based TRP approximation. Notice that no particular definition of
sample type is required for this Barycentric-based definition of TRP. This
formulation can be applied to uniform grid sampling, as well as uniform
density sampling, or even completely random sampling.
The mean offset can be optimized by explicitly computing the surface area of
the sphere's polyhedral approximation ($4\pi \approx \sum_{i}^{}{A_{i}\ }$)
using
$TRP \approx \frac{\sum_{i}^{}{A_{i} \bullet \left( \frac{\text{EIRP}_{0,i} +
\text{EIRP}_{1,i} + \text{EIRP}_{2,i}}{3} \right)\ }}{\sum_{i}^{}{A_{i}\ }}$
The Jacobian integration technique is based on subdividing the sphere into
triangles and estimating the TRP integral as the sum of all triangles mean
value of EIRP sampled at the triangle vertices. Given identical set of sampled
points on the sphere (uniform grid spacing in both φ and θ), there is not a
single unique representation of interconnections between the samples. In the
limit as the grid spacing becomes infinitesimally small, there is no
difference in TRP estimation, but the reverse is not strictly true. For small
but finite angular grid sampling, there can be differences in the statistical
TRP properties depending on the differences in mesh triangulation. Two
different Matlab triangulations are illustrated in Figure G.1.2.2-2 on the
left, Matlab's default convex hull triangulation, and on the right, a
symmetric \"ferromagnetic\" triangulation implementation.

## G.1.3 TRP Integration for Constant Density Grid Types
For constant density grid types, the TRP integration should ideally take into
account the area of the Voronoi region surrounding each grid point. Assuming
an ideal constant density configuration of the grid points, the TRP can be
approximated using
{width="4.881944444444445in" height="0.5763888888888888in"}
where N is the number of grid points of the constant density grid type.

The following observations can be made:
\- The standard deviation and the spread in TRP results is largest with the
sin(θ) quadrature
\- The smallest standard deviation and the smallest spread in TRP results is
obtained with the Clenshaw-Curtis, and the Jacobian quadrature utilizing the
ferromagnetic triangulation (from best to worst)
\- The triangulation approach has an impact on the standard deviation and the
spread in TRP results with the \"ferromagnetic\" approach outperforming the
non symmetric triangulation approach
\- All four quadratures meet the 0.25dB standard deviation for the 15^o^ step
size measurement grid.
\- With the Clenshaw Curtis, spherical integration quadrature, and the
Jacobian quadrature with ferromagnetic triangulation, a constant-step size
measurement grid with 12 latitudes and 19 longitudes is sufficient to meet the
maximum standard deviation of 0.25dB.
The results for two different constant-density grid implementations (charged
particle and golden spiral) are summarized in Table G.1.4-2 for the 8x2

## G.1.5 Interpolation at or near the Pole
As illustrated in Figure G.1.5-1, for systems that either do not allow
measurements at the pole (θ=180^o^), e.g., using distributed-axes positioners,
or systems that have the positioners/support structures block the radiation
towards the pole (θ=180^o^), e.g., combined-axes positioners, the measurements
in the region close to the pole at θ=180^o^ can be skipped and interpolated
instead.
{width="5.5in" height="3.1666666666666665in"}
Figure G.1.5-1: Illustration of areas around the pole that either cannot be
reached by the measurement antenna or are blocked by the positioner.
The results tabulated in Tables G.1.5-1 and G.1.5-2 outline the results of a
statistical analyses similar to those in Annex G.1.4 for the 8x2 antenna
array. However, in these analyses, the positioning concept was considered,
i.e., the analyses were performed with the assumption that the beam peak
direction is oriented away from the hemisphere towards the pole at θ = 180^o^.
Additionally, the standard deviations are presented when ranges of pattern
values are disregarded (zeroed out). For the constant-step size measurement
grids, three cases were investigated, i.e., no pattern values are disregarded,
values only at one latitude at θ=180^o^, and the values at the bottom two
latitudes are disregarded. For the constant density measurement grids, a
similar investigation was performed using the Charged Particle implementation.
Since there are no latitudes defined, the three cases investigated were: no
pattern values are disregarded, values between 165^o^ ≤ θ ≤ 180^o^, and values
between 150^o^ ≤ θ ≤ 180^o^ are disregarded.
These results clearly show that for the measurement grids proposed in G.1.4
and with the re-positioning concept considered, the measurements beyond 165^o^
in θ can be skipped and interpolated instead. However, alternate measurement
grids listed in Tables G.1.5-1 and G.1.5-2 with larger number of grid points
than those proposed in G.1.4 are not precluded where the measurements beyond
150^o^ in θ can be skipped and interpolated instead provided that the standard
deviation of 0.25 dB is met.

# G.2 Beam Peak Search Measurement Grids
## G.2.1 Assumptions
The simulation assumptions for the beam peak measurement grids are the same as
outlined in Annex G.1.1.
## G.2.2 Grid Types
Same grids as in G.1.2 are considered.
## G.2.3 Simulation results
The most realistic approach is to analyse the statistical distribution of the
beam peak error for a large number of random orientations.
For the simulations, the relative orientation of the simulated antenna array
and the measurement grid was altered randomly. The statistical results from
simulations using 50,000 random orientations are then used to determine mean
error, standard deviation and percentile analysis on CDF curve of all maximum
EIRPs for each measurement grid. The EIRPs are normalized by the known 8x2
antenna peak antenna gain.
Sample histograms and CDF distributions for the beam peak error for constant
step-size measurement grids are shown in Figure G.2.3-1 and for the constant
density measurement grid (based on the charged particle implementation) in
Figure G.2.3-2. The histograms show a half-normal distribution.
Given the half-normal distribution, the MU term should be based on the
determination of the offset from the beam peak that contains 95% of the
distribution (alternatively, the value at which the CDF is 5%). This offset
shall be considered a systematic error in the MU budget. The various
statistical metrics are illustrated in Figure G.2.3-3.

Figure G.2.3-6: Offset from the beam peak at which the CDF is 5% of the 50k

It can be seen that practical measurement grids of less than 1000 unique
measurement points yield mean errors of less than 0.2dB and standard
deviations of less than 0.2dB, and offsets from beam peak at which CDF is 5%
of less than about 0.5dB.
In Table G.2.3-3, the minimum number of unique grid points are listed for each
grid type investigated for sample systematic errors of 'Beam Peak Search' of
0.2 to 0.7dB. The option with the 0.5dB seems to be best compromise in terms
of MU and test points/test time.

Taking into account simulation results above and in order to make a reasonable
trade-off with measurement uncertainties, it is recommended to use for beam
peak search the following measurement grids leading to a systematic error of
\"Beam Peak Search\" of 0.5 dB:
\- Constant density grid (using the charged particle implementation) with at
least 800 grid points.
\- Constant step size grid with at least 1106 grid points, corresponding to an
angular step size of 7.5º.
The metric using a single, fine grid for the TX beam peak search is EIRP and
for the RX beam peak search it is EIS.
## G.2.4 Coarse and fine measurement grids
The baseline beam peak search is based on a single and fine beam peak search
grid to determine the TX/RX beam peak of the DUT in any given direction. This
means that even in sectors where poor EIRP/EIS performance is observed, a very
fine grid is used to search for the TX/RX beam peak.
An optimized approach, based on an initial coarse search followed by a
subsequent fine search could reduce the number of beam peak search grid points
significantly. The basis for this approach is to use a coarse grid with fewer
number of points than the ones described in clause G.2.3 in the first stage to
identify candidate regions that contain the global beam peak and search for
the global beam peak with the fine grid in the second stage with a minimum
number of points described in clause G.2.3.
As an example, Figure G.2.4-1 illustrates the coarse and fine measurement grid
approach applied to TX beam search; while this illustration is for EIRP, it
can easily be extended to RX beam peak search using EIS or throughput metrics
For simplification purposes, 2D coarse and fine searches are illustrated but
the concept can be extended to 3D easily. The UE is assumed to form a total of
six beams in the 2D plane as illustrated on the left of Figure G.2.4-1. In the
centre of Figure G.2.4-1, the 36 coarse beam peak search grid points in the 2D
plane are illustrated. On the right, the grey circles on the respective
antenna patterns illustrate the measured EIRP values towards each coarse grid
point direction based on the respective beam steering directions. This
illustration shows that the EIRP beam peak of the coarse search, EIRP~CSBP~,
is found to be the peak of the orange beam while the global TX beam peak (red
beam) was not identified due to the coarse sampling of the grid points.

Search. Left: Antenna Pattern assumptions in 2D, Centre: Coarse beam peak
search grid points/discrete antenna measurement positions, Right: TX beam EIRP
measurements per grid point
The proposed fine search approach is illustrated further in Figure G.2.4-2. A
fine search region starting from the beam peak identified in the coarse
search, EIRP~CSBP~, over a range of ∆~FS~ is used to identify the regions that
need to be investigated more closely with the fine search algorithm. The fine
search range ∆~FS~ is a function of the angular spacing of the coarse beam
peak search grid as well as the beam width of the reference antenna pattern
considered for smartphone UEs.

measurement grids while Figure G.2.4-4 illustrates the same for constant
density grid.

The metric using a coarse & fine grid approach for the TX beam peak search is
EIRP for both grids. For RX beam peak search either EIS or Throughput could be
used for coarse grids while only EIS for fine grid,
# G.3 Spherical coverage Measurement Grids
## G.3.1 Assumptions
The simulation assumptions for the spherical coverage grids are the same as
outlined in Annex G.1.1.
Regarding the antenna implementation and beamformer, the following assumptions
have been made (refer to Figure G.3.1-1):
\- Two 8x2 antenna arrays are integrated in the UE for the spherical coverage
analyses
\- The implementation loss for the antenna near the front is 5dB less than
that for the antenna near the back
\- For Beam Steering Assumptions
\- In the xz plane, 45^o^ beam steering granularity (from 45^o^ to 135^o^) has
been used
\- In the xy plane, 22.5^o^ beam steering granularity (from -90^o^ to 90^o^)
has been used

height="2.3618055555555557in"}
Figure G.3.1-1: Illustration of the two antenna arrays integrated in the UE.
Regarding UE Orientations/Rotations, the following assumptions were made for
the analyses:
\- 10000 random relative orientations between the simulated UE and the
respective measurement grids
\- The rotations of UE/grid will be along θ and φ as well as around the beam
peak
\- The rotations along θ will utilize a sin(θ) weighting to assume a uniform
sampling on the surface.
When using constant step size measurement grids, a theta-dependent correction
shall be applied, i.e., the PDF probability contribution for each measurement
point is scaled by sin(theta).
## G.3.2 Grid Types
Same grids as in G.1.2 are considered.
## G.3.3 Simulation results
### G.3.3.1 EIRP spherical coverage
The reference CDF curve was determined with a very fine constant step size
measurement grid using a 1^o^ step size in θ and φ. The need for scaling the
PDFs by sin(θ) is highlighted in Figure G.3.3.1-1 for an EIRP spherical
coverage CDF analysis based on 10000 random UE orientations with a 1^o^
constant step size grid. While the CDF curves in Figure G.3.3.1-1a are based
on the PDF scaled by sin(θ), the curves in Figure G.3.3.1-1b were not using
the θ dependent scaling. Clearly, the sin(θ) scaling makes the CDF curves
converge to the reference CDF curve for this very fine measurement grid, while
the simulated CDFs without the sin(θ) scaling of the PDF are spread rather
wide and can therefore not be used for CDF analyses.

At the 50%-tile CDF, i.e., the target CDF for PC3 [5], statistical analyses of
all 10000 EISs, EIS~50%CDF~, is performed. For the example of the 1^o^

for a very fine 1^o^ constant step size measurement grid.
While EIRP is measured with a seemingly infinitesimal power accuracy by the
test equipment, EIS is determined for finite DL power levels which has to be
taken into account for the analyses. For instance, if the \"true\" EIS in a
direction was -90.65dBm, the EIS following EIS values would be measured:
\- -90.6dBm for a 0.1dB DL power step size
\- -90.5dBm for a 0.5dB DL power step size
\- -90dBm for a 1dB DL power step size
The analyses in this contribution are taking an unrealistic infinitesimal DL
power step size as well as finite 0.1, 0.5, and 1dB step sizes into account.

Figure G.3.4-1: Sample CDF Curve for a coarse measurement grid
While for very fine measurement grids, the definition of the min EIRP at the
target CDF, EIRP~target-CDF,~ is pretty clear since the CDF curve is smooth,
the definition of the EIRP value at the respective CDF target should be
clarified for coarse grids with staggered CDF curves. Two scenarios are
outlined in Figure G.3.4-2; Figure G.3.4-2a shows the case where the CDF is
not met with any EIRP value while in Figure G.3.4-2b, the target CDF is met
with one (or more, as illustrated) EIRP values.
For the case shown in Figure G.3.4-2a, min. EIRP at the target CDF shall be
determined based on an interpolation of the CDF curve between the top of
raising edges located right above the CDF target (blue circle) and right below
the target (green circle).
For the case where the target CDF is met with one or more EIRP value, as

Figure G.3.4-2: Illustration of CDF scenarios, a) CDF target is not met with
any EIRP value, b) CDF target is met with one or more EIRP values.
It can be concluded that, for the case when the target CDF is not met with any
EIRP values, the min. EIRP at the target CDF is determined based on an
interpolation of the CDF curve between the raising edges located right above
the CDF target and right below the target. For the case where the target CDF
is met with one more or EIRP value, define the min. EIRP at the target CDF as
the min. EIRP value that meets the CDF target.
# G.4 Combined Beam Peak and Spherical Coverage Analyses
Since the beam peak does not have to be aligned on the spherical coverage grid
for spherical coverage analyses (as described in clause G.3), the EIRP/EIS
results from the EIRP/EIS beam peak search using single fine grids (as
described in clause G.2) could be re-used for EIRP/EIS spherical coverage
which could further reduce the EIRP/EIS spherical coverage MU.
Coarse EIRP/EIS beam peak searches (as described in clause G.2.3) can be used
for EIRP/EIS spherical coverage analyses as long as they meet the minimum
number of measurement points (200 grid points for constant density using the
charged particle implementation and 266 for constant step size). As the fine
grid points in the coarse & fine grid approach are localized near maximum beam
peaks, only the results from the coarse search grid can be used for the CDF
analyses.
Subsequent fine search approaches using constant step size grids used to
determine the EIRP/EIS beam peaks require a minimum step size of 7.5º.
Subsequent fine search approaches using constant density grids used to
determine the EIRP/EIS beam peaks require at least 6 points around the peak
identified with the coarse grid, with a spacing corresponding to a constant
density (using the charged particle implementation) over the whole sphere of
at least 800 points.
Therefore, EIRP/EIS spherical coverage requirement can be verified using the
results from the corresponding EIRP/EIS coarse beam peak search.
###### ## Annex H: SINR control for Scenario 3 RRM Test with two Angles of
Arrival (2 AoAs)
# H.1 Case 1: TDM transmissions from 2 probes
For Scenario 3 with 2AoA for both Mode 1 and Mode 2, the methods are same as
the Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 with 1AoA.
# H.2 Case 2: Simultaneous transmission of signals from 2 probes
## H.2.1 Mode 1
For Mode 1, the SINR equation for signal from probe 1 at baseband is given as
follows:
${SINR1}_{\text{BB}} = \frac{S1 _G1_ Loss}{\left( S2 + N \right)G2 _Loss + N_
G1*Loss + Noise_ floor}$
Where S1 and S2 are signal level for probe 1 and probe 2 respectively. G1 and
G2 are the antenna gain for probe 1 and probe 2 respectively. Loss is the
pathloss between probe 1&2 and DUT. Noise_floor is the total noise at DUT
baseband receiver. N is the artificial noise at the reference point for probe
1 and 2 (artificial noise level is identical for probe 1 and probe 2).
Since the wanted noise is set 6dB above UE thermal noise, therefore the total
noise of baseband Noise_floor can be ignored when calculating the SINR. And
the SINR can be rewritten as:
${SINR1}_{\text{BB}} \approx \frac{S1 _G1_ Loss}{\left( S2 + N \right)G2 _Loss
+ N_ G1 _Loss} = \frac{1}{\left( \frac{S2}{S1} + \frac{1}{\text{SNR}1}
\right)_ \frac{G2}{G1} + \frac{1}{\text{SNR}1}}$
Where SNR1 is the SNR from probe 1, and the key parameter affecting the SINR
at baseband is G2/G1.
However, it is difficult to obtain the exact G2/G1 value since it depends on
UE implementation, relative probe spacing, and relative probe and DUT
orientation. The lower bound of SINR can be derived under assumption on
maximum antenna gains difference G2/G1 is determined. For power class 3 UE in
Band n260, the lower bound of G1/G2 can be roughly assessed to be below [-10]
dB.
## H.2.1 Mode 2
For Mode 2, the SINR for signal from probe 1 at baseband is given as follows:
${SINR1}_{\text{BB}} = \frac{S1 _G1_ Loss}{S2 _G2_ Loss + Noise_ floor}$
If we set the signal level from interfering probe at reference point is 6dB
higher than UE thermal noise, then the approximate SINR can be rewritten as
follows:
$SINR1 \approx \frac{S1}{S2*G2/G1}$
Same as for Mode 1, for power class 3 UE in Band n260, the lower bound of
G1/G2 can be roughly assessed to be below [-10] dB.
