The present document is part 2 of a multi-part deliverable covering the 5G
System (5GS) User Equipment (UE) protocol conformance specification, as
identified below:
\- 3GPP TS 38.508-1 [11]: \"5GS; User Equipment (UE) conformance
specification; Part 1: Common test environment \".
\- 3GPP TS 38.508-2: \"**5GS; User Equipment (UE) conformance specification;
Part 2: Common Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS) proforma** \" (the
present document).
# 1 Scope
The present document provides the Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS)
proforma for 5G New Radio (NR) User Equipment (UE), in compliance with the
relevant requirements.
Special conformance testing functions can be found in 3GPP TS 38.509 [12] and
3GPP TS 36.509 [14] and the common test environments are included in 3GPP TS
