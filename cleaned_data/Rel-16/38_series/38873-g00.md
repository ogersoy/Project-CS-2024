# 4 Background
On April 21^st^ 2015, the FCC released a Report and Order (R&O) and Second
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Second FNPRM) to establish new rules
for commercial use of the 3550-3700 MHz band. This framework creates a
contiguous 150 MHz block at 3550 -- 3700 MHz (3.5 GHz) for mobile broadband
that FCC calls \"Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS)\" and regulated under
new Part 96 of FCC's Rules. On May 2^nd^ 2016, a second R&O and Order on
Reconsideration was released by FCC to finalize the rules. On October 24,
2018, the FCC released an Order revising the licensing and technical rules in
the CBRS band.
**The objective of the Work Item is to specify a new NR TDD operating band
(3550 -- 3700** MHz) with support of the following SCS and bandwidths (for PC3
power class only):
NR Band | SCS kHz | 5 MHz | 10 MHz | 15 MHz | 20 MHz | 40 MHz | 50 MHz | 60 MHz | 80 MHz | 90 MHz | 100 MHz  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

| 60 |  | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes1 | Yes1 | Yes1 | Yes1 | Yes1  
Note 1: This UE channel bandwidth is applicable only to DL Note 2: Only symmetric UL/DL bandwidths are defined for non-CA operation |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
# 5 Frequency band arrangements and regulatory background
The 3550 -- 3700 MHz band plan is shown in Figure 5.1. The adjacent 3700 \--
4200 MHz band is used by C-Band Fixed Satellite Services Earth Stations. On
the lower side, the band 3100-3550MHz is used by US Department of Defense
(DoD) for operating various types of shipborne, land-based, and aeronautical
mobile radar systems.

Figure 5.1: Band plan
Summary of the FCC's rules relevant to RAN4 work to define a new band for US
3.5GHz band are provided below:
_3.5 GHz Emissions and Interference Limits:_
(1) _General protection levels._ Except as otherwise specified below, for CBSD
channel and frequency assignments, the conducted power of any CBSD emission
outside the fundamental emission (whether in or outside of the authorized
band) shall not exceed -13 dBm/MHz within 0-10 megahertz above the upper
assigned channel edge and within 0-10 megahertz below the lower assigned
channel edge. At all frequencies greater than 10 megahertz above the upper
assigned channel edge and less than 10 MHz below the lower assigned channel
edge, the conducted power of any CBSD emission shall not exceed -25 dBm/MHz.
The upper and lower assigned channel edges are the upper and lower limits of
any channel assigned to a CBSD, or in the case of multiple contiguous
channels, the upper and lower limits of the combined contiguous channels.
For channel and frequency assignments made by a CBSD to End User Devices, the
conducted power of any End User Device emission outside the fundamental
emission (whether in or outside of the authorized band) shall not exceed -13
dBm/MHz within 0 to B megahertz (where B is the bandwidth in megahertz of the
assigned channel or multiple contiguous channels of the End User Device) above
the upper CBSD-assigned channel edge and within 0 to B megahertz below the
lower CBSD-assigned channel edge. At all frequencies greater than B megahertz
above the upper CBSD assigned channel edge and less than B megahertz below the
lower CBSD-assigned channel edge, the conducted power of any End User Device
emission shall not exceed -25 dBm/MHz. Notwithstanding the emission limits in
this paragraph, the Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio for End User Devices shall
be at least 30 dB.
(2) _Addi_ tional protection levels: the conducted power of emissions below
3540 MHz or above 3710 MHz shall not exceed -25 dBm/MHz, and the conducted
power of emissions below 3530 MHz or above 3720 MHz shall not exceed
-40dBm/MHz.

Figure 5.2: CBSD & EUD Emission Limits
(3) _Measurement procedure_ :
(i) Compliance with this provision is based on the use of measurement
instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 megahertz or greater.
However, in the 1 megahertz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the
licensee\'s authorized frequency channel, a resolution bandwidth of no less
than one percent of the fundamental emission bandwidth may be employed. A
narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement
accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full reference
bandwidth (_i.e.,_ 1 MHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified).
The fundamental emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal
between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the
carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at
least 26 dB below the transmitter power.
# 6 Operating band, channel bandwidths, channel numbering
**5.2 Operating bands**
Because in this case E-UTRA band 48 is re-farmed the band number is re-used.

**5.3 UE channel bandwidth**
From the WID we can determine the Channel bandwidths. Channel bandwidth of 5
MHz can be used only as a part of DC or CA-configuration as it is not
discoverable in initial acquisition because the synchronization raster does
not support 15 kHz. Channel bandwidths of 50 MHz -- 100 MHz are listed in WID
as applicable only for DL. Furthermore, the WID states that only symmetric
UL/DL bandwidths are defined for non-CA operation, therefore channel
bandwidths of 50 MHz -- 100 MHz can be used only as Scell in CA-configuration.
NR band / SCS / UE Channel bandwidth |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
NR Band | SCS kHz | 5 MHz | 101,2 MHz | 152 MHz | 202 MHz | 252 MHz | 30 MHz | 40 MHz | 50 MHz | 60 MHz | 80 MHz | 90 MHz | 100 MHz

NOTE 3: This UE channel bandwidth is applicable only to downlink. NOTE 4: For this bandwidth, the minimum requirements are restricted to operation when carrier is configured as an Scell part of DC or CA configuration. NOTE 5: For this bandwidth, the minimum requirements are restricted to operation when carrier is configured as an downlink SCell part of CA configuration |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**6.2.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction**
NS- signalling is needed due to FCC emission requirements. NS_27 is copied
from E-UTRA band 48. NS_100 or NS_27U is not needed as UTRA is not deployed in
this band.

### 7.1.1 A-MPR
#### 7.1.1.1 Vendor A
**Simulation assumptions were as follows**
IQ-Image and LO leakage = 28 dBc
CIM3 = 60 dBc
PA calibration point was 20 MHz, 15 kHz, QPSK, DFT-S-OFMA, 100 RB at lower
channel edge with 0.5 dB MPR
**A-MPR concept and results**
FCC emission requirements are tighter outside of the band compared to inside
the band with an exception that first 10 MHz on high side of that band has
same -13 dBm requirement as within the band. Therefore, it would be beneficial
to define two different A-MPRs firstly the band edge A-MPR which has higher
-25 dBm...-40 dBm emission requirement on IMD3 region and secondly an inner-
band A-MPR which would have lower A-MPR as -13 dBm requirement would apply on
IMD3 region. This concept is presented in Figure.

As can be seen from results presented in Table 7.1.1.1-2 our results indicate
there is no need to specify A-MPR for A1, A2, A4, A6 inner and A8 inner
scenarios. A-MPR needed for A6 and A8 outer allocations is limited to only few
modulations. For A5 there is an A-MPR need for many modulations but additive
backoff compared to MPR is 1.5 -- 3 dB. A8 requires always substantial A-MPR.

**6.6.4.2.5.3 Additional operating band unwanted emissions limits for Band
n48**
The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band n48 in certain
regions. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in Table
6.6.4.2.5.3-1.

Note: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to
the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy,
sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the
measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the

bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement
bandwidth.
