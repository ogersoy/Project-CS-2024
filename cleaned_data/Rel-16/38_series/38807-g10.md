# 1 Scope
This documents is to provide uses cases and deployment scenarios for NR system
operation in carriers between 52.6 GHz and 100 GHz and also provide
operational and system design requirements, which can facilitate 3GPP\'s
future enhancements to NR beyond 52.6GHz. NR physical layer channels in
Release 15 were designed to be optimized for uses under 52.6 GHz and with the
potential to be used for above 52.6 GHz. In general, high frequencies are
faced with more challenges, such as higher phase noise, larger propagation
loss, and lower power amplifier efficiency, compared to low frequency bands.
Additionally, the frequency ranges above 52.6 GHz potentially contain larger
spectrum allocations and larger bandwidths that are not available for bands
lower than 52.6 GHz and may support widely ranging use cases, such as V2X,
IAB, NR licensed and unlicensed, fixed wireless access, Wireless HDMI,
Industrial Automation/IoT, and non-terrestrial operations. With the aim of
enabling and optimizing 3GPP NR systems for operation in above 52.6 GHz, as
originally planned during the NR SI (TR 38.913 [4]), 3GPP should further work
on physical layer channels including potential introduction of new waveform,
procedures, and requirements, etc., where the operation is applicable for
operations in licensed and unlicensed spectrum, to WAN operation, private
networks, Integrated Access Backhaul (IAB), ITS application using vehicular
communications (V2X), etc.
The objectives of the study item are the following [2]:
\- identify target spectrum ranges, including survey on global spectrum
availability, regulatory requirements, channelization, and licensing regimes,
\- identify potential use cases and deployment scenarios,
\- identify NR design requirements and considerations on top of regulatory
requirements.

## 4.1 Overview of Global Spectrum Availability
In 2015, the international telecommunication union (ITU) proposed 11
millimetre-wave bands between 24 and 86 GHz to be studied towards WRC-19 for
possible identification for IMT (see Table 4.1-1). The WRC-19 [5] concluded
that the following frequency bands should have an IMT identification to enable
5G deployments: 24.25-- 27.5 GHz, 37--43.5 GHz, 45.5--47 GHz, 47.2--48.2 GHz,
66--71 GHz.

Within the range 52.6 to 116 GHz, the frequency bands 66-76 GHz (including
66-71 and 71-76 GHz) and 81-86 GHz were studied under WRC-19 Agenda Item 1.13
for potential IMT identification. The frequency band 66-71 GHz is identified
for use by administrations wishing to implement the terrestrial component of
International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT). This identification does not
preclude the use of this frequency band by any application of the services to
which this frequency band is allocated and does not establish priority in the
Radio Regulations. Resolution 241 (WRC-19) applies.
For 71-76 GHz, studies were carried out for the FS, RLS and FSS (space-to-
Earth) indicating that sharing with FS and FSS is feasible. However,
additional limits of the IMT BS and UE unwanted emissions is needed to protect
RLS in the adjacent frequency band 76-81 GHz.
For 81-86 GHz, studies were carried out for the FS, FSS (Earth-to-space), RAS
(in band and adjacent band), EESS (passive) and RLS. Studies are not needed
for the SRS (passive), as this service is dealing with sensors around other
planets and no interference issue is expected. Studies were also not carried
out for the MSS. The results of those studies indicate that sharing with FS,
FSS and RAS (in band and adjacent band) is feasible. Notice that additional
limits of the IMT BS and UE unwanted emissions would be needed to ensure
protection of EESS (passive) in the adjacent frequency band 76-81 GHz and RLS
in the adjacent frequency band 86-82 GHz. Table 4.1-3 and Table 4.1-4 depicts
the limits of the IMT BS and UE maximum unwanted emissions levels according to
the individual compatibility studies.

## 4.2 Country / Regional Specific Spectrum Availability and Spectrum
Regulatory Requirements
### 4.2.1 Country / Regional Specific Licensing situation
Table 4.2-1 and 4.2-2 provide an overall summary of the current licensing
situation for data communication (Mobile and Fixed, excluding radar-based
telemetry) between frequencies 52.6GHz and 100GHz for various
countries/regions under ITU region 1, 2, and 3. Symbol \'U\', and \'L\',
represent unlicensed spectrum and licensed spectrum (including light licensing
and other licensing forms), respectively. Notice that Table 4.2-1 and 4.2-2
does not include information about the service allocated to each frequency
band. It neither includes information about the frequency bands currently
studied in AI 1.13 WRC-19 which are listed in Table 4.1-1. Also, it is
worthwhile noticing that type of licensing for each frequency band is a
national decision.

### 4.2.2 ITU Region 1
#### 4.2.2.1 Europe and CEPT
General information for usages in CEPT can be found in [41]. When it comes to
Regulation about Short Range Devices additional information can be found in
[42]. Unwanted emission limits can be found in [43] and [44]. The 57-71 GHz
range, encompassing the 66-71 GHz range, which has been identified by the
WRC-19 for IMT, is subject to a permanent European Commission mandate to CEPT
covering Short-Range Devices (SRD). ERC Recommendation 70-03 and EC Decision
for SRDs (EU) 2019/1345 have provisions to allow higher powered Wideband Data
Transmission use in the 57-71 GHz band. The spectrum regulatory deliverables
were both revised and updated during the study period for WRC-19 to include
both increased power and spectrum availability to allow use of the band by a
more diverse set of uses and applications.
ECC CEPT Report 78 [57] concluded the following:
The existing technical conditions contained in both EC Decision for SRD (EU)
2019/1345 and ERC Recommendation 70-03 allow next generation (5G) wireless
broadband electronic communication services to have access to the 66-71 GHz
frequency band. The current regulations have been developed recognising the
CEPT Roadmap for 5G with the assumptions that 5G services in this band would
operate under the current general authorisation framework and would implement
the appropriate technical conditions to co-exist with other usage in the band
including current Fixed and mobile Wideband technologies operating under the
current regulations.
Table 4.2.2.1-1 and Table 4.2.2.1-2 provide summary of frequency allocations
in the range of 52.6 and 114.25 GHz and regulatory requirements for existing
Mobile and Fixed services in the frequency bands between 52.6 GHz and 114.25
GHz, respectively.

Among the spectrum allocations for U.S.A., frequency ranges 57GHz to 71GHz are
available for mobile use as part of unlicensed spectrum regulated by Title 47
Part 15 of the FCC regulations. Frequency ranges 71GHz to 74GHz and 81GHz to
86GHz are available for fixed use as part of licensed spectrum using universal
licensing system regulated by Title 47 Part 101 of the FCC regulations.
Frequency ranges 92GHz to 95GHz (TBC) are available for fixed indoor wireless
use as part of licensed spectrum using universal licensing system regulated by
Title 47 Part 101 of the FCC regulations.
The 70/80/90GHz bands in US are licensed on the basis of non-exclusive
nationwide licenses. There is no limit to the number of non-exclusive
nationwide licenses that may be granted for these bands, and these licenses
will serve as a prerequisite for registering individual links. An entity may
request any portion of the 71-76GHz and 81-86GHz bands, up to 5 gigahertz in
each segment for a total of 10 gigahertz. Licensees are also permitted to
register smaller segments. The 92-95GHz band is divided into three segments:
92.0-94.0GHz and 94.1-95.0 GHz for non-government and government users, and
94.0-94.1 GHz for Federal Government use. Pairing is allowed and segments may
be aggregated without limit (possible 12.9 gigahertz maximum aggregation).
Licensees may use the 70GHz, 80GHz and 90GHz bands for any point-to-point,
non-broadcast service. The segments may be unpaired or paired, but paring will
be permitted only in a standardized manner (e.g., 71-72.25GHz may be paired
only with 81-82.25GHz, and so on).
Table 4.2.3.1-2 shows regulatory requirements for frequency ranges that are
designed for mobile use between 52.6GHz and 100GHz in U.S. It should be noted
that no channel occupancy time, occupied channel bandwidth, and listen-before-
talk requirements exist for unlicensed operations in above 52.6GHz.

Canada has designed frequency bands 71-76GHz, 81-86GHz, and 92-95GHz for use
by fixed service. Frequency bands 71-76GHz, 81-86GHz are subject to licensing
and frequency band 92-95GHz will be subject to future revision of the
Canada\'s Standard Radio System Plan (SRSP). Figure 4.2.3.2-1 illustrates the
band plan and associated usage for the bands 71-76 and 81-86GHz. The channel
center frequencies are also described in Table 4.2.3.2-2 and 4.2.3.2-3. The
frequency ranges 71.125 to 74.375 GHz and 81.125 to 84.375GHz provide for
thirteen pairs of 250MHz channels (A1/A1\' to A13/A13\') for systems employing
FDD. The frequency ranges 74.375GHz to 75.875GHz and 84.375GHz to 85.875GHz
provide for 6 pairs of 250MHz channels (A14/A14\' to A19/A19\') for systems
employing either FDD or TDD.

#### 4.2.4.5 Taiwan
Table 4.2.4.5-1 shows the spectrum allocations for Taiwan for frequencies
between 52.6GHz and 114.25GHz based on [32]. For the frequencies above 52.6
GHz, the power requirements, spectrum access, modulation and occupied
bandwidth remain undefined. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) releases the plan of spectrum supply and allocation every year
typically, and the next frequency allocation will be after WRC-19. [
]{.underline} The Taiwanese Association of Information and Communication
Standards (TAICS) has a proposal the paired band 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz,
which is currently allocated to High Speed Wireless Transmission (Fixed) on
licensed basis, would also be used by IMT services on light licensing scheme
basis.

Figure 4.2.4.6-1: Singapore spectrum allocation between 52.6GHz and 114.25GHz
(from [34])
In Singapore, IMDA (Info-communications Media Development Authority) shows
that 57-66 GHz is considered for Wireless LAN and broadband access application
[27]. On the other hand, short range radar systems, such as automatic cruise
control and collision warning systems for vehicle, are applied from76 to
77GHz. Moreover, details of their regulatory requirements can be found in
Annex. Furthermore, it is notable that both spectrum band, 71 -- 76 GHz paired
with 81 -- 86 GH, will be available for short-term commercial use in fixed-
wireless backhaul and inter-building fixed-wireless network.

ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) publishes sensors using
radar which can be applied in some different bands from 52.6GHz to 85GHz in
Australia [28]. Moreover, details of their regulatory requirements can be
found in Table 4.2.4.7-2. In August 2019, ACMA released a new update to low
interference potential devices [56], in which the 57-71GHz range has been
allocated for Frequency hopping, WiFi and RLAN transmitters.

# 5 Use Cases and Deployment Scenarios
## 5.1 Use Cases
The relatively underutilized millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum offers
excellent opportunities to provide high speed data rate, low latency, and high
capacity due to the enormous amount of available contiguous bandwidth.
However, operation on bands in frequencies above 52.6GHz will be limited by
the performance of devices, for example, poor power amplifier (PA) efficiency
and larger phase noise impairment, the increased front-end insertion loss
together with the low noise amplifier (LNA) and analog-to-digital converter
(ADC) noise. In addition, bands in frequencies above 52.6GHz have high
propagation and penetration losses challenge. Even so, various use cases are
envisioned for NR operating in frequencies between 52.6GHz and 114.25GHz. Some
of the use cases are illustrated in Figure 5.1-1 and following section provide
detailed description of the uses cases. It should be noted that there is not a
1-to-1 mapping of use cases and wireless interfaces, e.g. Uu, slidelink, etc.
Various wireless interfaces could be applicable to various uses cases
described.
{width="5.529861111111111in" height="2.1680555555555556in"}
Figure 5.1-1: Use Cases for NR above 52.6GHz
### 5.1.1 High data rate eMBB
The use case serves high-definition multimedia and high user density by
cellular network, which will increase in many indoor and outdoor open areas,
such as stadium, main event for entertainment, sport and so on; and media
delivery will be both to individuals and to groups of users. Moreover, user
devices will get enhanced media consumption capabilities, such as Ultra-High
Definition display, multi-view High Definition display, mobile 3D projections,
immersive video conferencing, and augmented reality and mixed reality display
and interface. This will all lead to a demand for significantly higher data
rates and wide bandwidth from 52.6GHz to **114.25 GHz**.
The increased demand for high data rates from MBB application in dense urban
and indoor hotspots deployments is one of the main drivers for using the
higher frequency spectrum. Frequencies above 52.6GHz are interesting for these
use case classes due to vast availability of spectrum. The large availability
of spectrum permits system bandwidth of the order of _GHz_ and high spatial
reuse. **_An overview of use cases with high data rate requirements is
illustrated in Figure 5.1.1-1._**
{width="2.604861111111111in" height="1.84375in"}
Figure 5.1.1-1: High data rate use cases
The requirements for MBB services are provided in Table 5.1.1-1. These
services are:
\- Indoor hotspot: this scenario covers users/devices in
residential/commercial complexes, e.g., offices and homes. The wireless
connection of surveillance cameras is an example of an indoor commercial use
cases.
\- Dense urban: this scenario includes outdoor to outdoor as well as outdoor
to indoor coverage. For example, outdoor users in shopping strips and city
centers, indoor user in residential/commercial complex, or even users in low
speed urban vehicles can be served by gNB.
\- Provisional hotspots: this scenario covers broadband access in a crowd,
e.g., in stadiums or at concerts. In this case, in addition to high density of
users, the data rate requirements in the uplink connections are more demanding
than the corresponding requirements in the downlink connections as the users
are interested in sharing what they see/hear.

### 5.1.2 Mobile data offloading
The use of complementary network technologies, such as NR-U, with much wider
spectrum for delivering data originally targeted for cellular networks, which
has met heavily traffic load, in both indoor and outdoor open area eMBB usage
scenario. Operators may leverage bands to offload data from macro cell at hot
spots. In such scenarios, high band may be dual connectivity (DC) or carrier
aggregation (CA) with low band for mobility purposes. Coverage for this
scenario may not be chosen as optimization target.
Given that more than 10GHz of bandwidth is available for short range
communications in unlicensed spectrum above 52.6GHz, UEs could significantly
mitigate eMBB data congestion with use of these spectrum. Users requiring
enhanced media reception in hotspot areas or utilizing other high bandwidth
applications in hotspot areas could be serviced with available licensed or
unlicensed spectrum without impacting network load in lower frequencies.
### 5.1.3 Short-range high-data rate D2D communications
Wireless docking at office has attracted much interest for future wireless
office environment. For wireless application at smart home and office meeting,
data transmission from UE to large screen or projector also needs energy
efficient transmission mechanisms. Bands above 52.6GHz provide great potential
for such low latency and high data rate transmission.
Productivity docking, such as Monitor 8K UHD docking, is one of the typical
short-range high-data rate D2D use case. The directional transmission, which
results in highly local beam characteristics, and high capacity from wide
bandwidths can satisfy the requirement of this use case. Additionally, due to
high pathloss, NFC-like use cases including personal identification, digital
key, wireless USB, and cable-free are suitable. This service requires high
capacity and low latency to exchange security data or encrypted data between
devices.
Wireless display transfer to smart TVs, augmented reality (AR), virtual
reality (VR) headsets, monitors, and video distribution screens (e.g.
screens/monitors at in-flight entertainment, classrooms, high-speed rail,
exhibitions, etc) can be performed using licensed/unlicensed spectrum.
{width="2.9791666666666665in" height="2.051388888888889in"}
Figure 5.1.3-1: Short range high data rate person area communications
In today's home, office and factory, there are lots of cables between devices
(e.g., the HDMI cables between the monitors and set-top boxes, cables to
connect racks and cabinets in data centers) to provide very high data rate
connection. Due to the capability of providing high speed data transmission,
frequency band above 52.6GHz can also be used for this kind of high speed D2D
connection, and this cable-less high speed connection is promising to enable
new smart home/office/factory applications.
### 5.1.4 Vertical industry factory application
There is not only a single class of services, but there are various services
of different requirement need to support in this use case: such as motor
control, mobile control, motor robot, Augmented Reality (AR), and etc, thus
resulting in the need for a high adaptability and scalability of the system.
Some services of industrial-grade quality have stringent requirements in terms
of end-to-end latency, communication service availability and jitter, and some
services, such as AR, requires high data rate transmission, high reliability,
and low latency, and some applications have stringent requirements on safety,
security, and privacy. The millimeter wave technique is quite suited for
vertical industry application networks or other private/security networks due
to its highly local characteristic and wide bandwidth.
### 5.1.5 Broadband distribution network
{width="6.08125in" height="2.8743055555555554in"}
Figure 5.1.5-1: PtP and PtMP outdoor fixed broadband transmissions
Today, wireless Ethernet networks (a.k.a. 802.11 based) offer broadband
connectivity to confined outdoor venues such as university campuses, stadiums,
malls etc. When operating in carrier frequency above 52.6GHz NR should offer
feature parity (if not exceed) to such wireless Ethernet based networks to
serve either as replacement or complimentary network. Here, the expectation is
for a single node (e.g. gNB) to offer broadband service (in order of roughly
above 20Gbps) to a few fixed (non-mobile) devices (e.g. UE) over a distance of
approximately 300m to 500m. The resulting network could either be public or
non-public. Both point to point, and point-to-multipoint transmissions should
be supported.
{width="2.8958333333333335in" height="1.5625in"}
Figure 5.1.5-2: Wireless to the home (WTTH) distribution network
The last mile distribution of wideband internet access (e.g. fiber) using
fixed wireless licensed/unlicensed spectrum available for above 52.6 GHz could
be useful. Backhauling of wireless to the home/building/curb/neighborhood
(WTTx) distribution networks would require high data rates to be supported in
both downlink and uplink. The access nodes could be specialized UE that
enables home/building networking via Wi-Fi or Ethernet networks, or could be
an Integrated Access Backhaul (IAB) that enables NR using either licensed or
unlicensed spectrum within the home/building area.
### 5.1.6 Integrated access backhaul (IAB)
The use case mainly is applied for backhauling deployment when optical or
dedicated wireless backhaul is unavailable or inconvenient. Such backhauling
can take advantage from the currently developed NR Integrated Access Backhaul
(IAB), where some nodes serve both backhaul and access. In this use case,
devices operate with LOS under most conditions, though obstruction of the LOS
may occur occasionally, so directional transmission can extend the distance
between the gNBs.
There are already lots of commercial deployments of backhaul applications
using the bands above 52.6GHz. Compared with the lower frequency bands, the
abundance of available spectrum can support higher capacity for both wireless
access link and backhaul link. Low latency requirement can also be satisfied
by NR flexible frame structure.
Where a wired connection is not a feasible option, various wireless
technologies e.g. point to point (PTP) microwave links are used to offer
backhaul / relay service. 3GPP Rel-16 offers backhaul / relay service under
the IAB umbrella. However, this service is presently limited to carrier
frequency below 52.6GHz. NR operating in carrier frequency above 52.6GHz NR
should extend such capabilities to this higher frequency range. Here, the
expectation is for a single node (e.g. gNB) to offer broadband services to a
few devices (e.g. UE) or to offer relay services (up to certain hops) to a few
devices (e.g. other nodes) or a combination thereof. The expected coverage
range is approximately 300m to 500m.
{width="4.029166666666667in" height="2.3125in"}
Figure 5.1.6-1: Integrated access backhaul
A distributed architecture including the flexible deployment of access points
using IAB can be used to support both intra-RAN local breakout/edge computing
services on a private network and MBB/voice services on a public network with
a common control plane/management framework. This architecture can apply to
multiple use cases, especially for the ease of deploying cost-effective
enterprise and industrial Private Networks. An illustration is shown in Figure
5.1.6-1, where FR1 refers to wireless link using carrier frequencies below 7
GHz and \"FR2/4\" terminology in the figure refers to wireless link using
carrier frequency above 7 GHz.
Abundance of millimeter wave spectrum along with the native deployment of
massive MIMO or multi-narrow-beam systems in NR creates an opportunity to
develop and deploy IAB links. The benefits of IAB are crucial during network
rollout and MBB network growth. SA1 has already established service
requirements for wireless self-backhauling (TS 22.261, Service requirement for
the 5G System, Section 6.12.2). These requirements are:
\- The 5G network shall enable operators to support wireless self-backhaul
using NR and E-UTRA.
\- The 5G network shall support flexible and efficient wireless self-backhaul
both for indoor and outdoor scenarios.
\- The 5G network shall support flexible partitioning of radio resources
between access and backhaul functions.
\- The 5G network shall support the autonomous configuration of access and
wireless self-backhaul functions.
\- The 5G network shall support multi-hop wireless self-backhauling to enable
a flexible extension of range and coverage area.
\- The 5G network shall support autonomous adaptation on wireless self-
backhaul network topologies to minimize service disruptions.
\- The 5G network shall support topologically redundant connectivity on the
wireless self-backhaul to enhance reliability and capacity, and reduce
latency.
### 5.1.7 Factory automation/Industrial IoT (IIoT)
{width="6.695833333333334in" height="4.042361111111111in"}
Figure 5.1.7-1: IIoT factory robots
This set of use-cases is expected to target indoor industrial automation
applications over a distance of approximately 50 to 100m, with speed below
5km/hr, and other characteristics such as latency, and packet error rate in
accordance with performance requirements mentioned in Annex E of TS 22.261,
"Service requirements for next generation new services and markets".
{width="2.904166666666667in" height="2.073611111111111in"}
Figure 5.1.7-2: Indoor industrial IoT and private network use cases
Industrial IoT is one of the key enablers of cost-efficient industrial mass
production with high quality in factory automation. In the factories of the
future, static sequential production systems will be more and more replaced by
novel modular production systems offering a high flexibility and versatility.
This involves a large number of increasingly mobile production assets, for
which powerful wireless communication and localization services are required.
The corresponding applications are often characterized by very high
requirements on the underlying connectivity of the infrastructure, especially
in terms of latency and reliability. High resolution time synchronization, low
delay jitter, guaranteed delay constraints are important characteristics of
industrial IoT operations.
The challenge with indoor-to-outdoor dampening in millimeter wave bands will,
in these scenarios, become a benefit as the band offers good isolation from/to
outside world. In such scenarios, controlled interference and the wide
spectrum can be utilized to meet high reliability and low latency in a
factory.
### 5.1.8 Augmented reality/virtual reality headsets and other high-end
wearables
For high-end augmented reality or virtual reality wearables like glasses, they
typically demand large data rate and low transmission power. For AR/VR
application, due to small latency requirement, those video may not be
compressed and thus require larger than 10Gbps data rate. They may also have
low transmission power since high transmission power would require large
battery and increase weight of the wearable. Additionally, augmented reality
relies on substantial sensor information to process and resolve the
environment. The higher bandwidths may improve both sensor resolution and
reduce latency.
### 5.1.9 Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and V2X
{width="2.917361111111111in" height="2.0409722222222224in"}
Figure 5.1.9-1: Outdoor V2X, backhauling, and fronthauling use cases
ITS supports transportation of good and humans in order to efficiently and
safely use transport infrastructure and transport means. Wireless connectivity
for inter-vehicle and vehicle to roadside communication applications was
deemed suitable to be operated in frequencies above 52.6GHz. These networks
operate over a short range with very wideband communications using a variety
of directional medium and high gain antennas to enable a high degree of
spectrum reuse, and may use a flexible bandwidth scheme under which they
normally operate in a wideband mode, and periodically reduce their bandwidth
(e.g. for antenna training and other activities). The wide millimeter wave
spectrum can be exploited for providing low latency, high reliability, and
often high data requirements in various short range ITS and V2X scenarios.
Extended sensors: this service enables the exchange of raw/processed data
gathered through local sensors or live video data among vehicles, pedestrians,
and V2X application servers. This service helps vehicles to enhance the
perception of their environment beyond what their own sensors can detect. This
leads to a more holistic view of their local situation.
Precise positioning for automated driving: automated driving systems require
highly resolved and dynamic maps to maneuver the vehicles safely, in
particular as a means of providing decimeter localization which is not
achieved by typical consumer-grade satellite navigation equipment. Exchanging
high definition (HD) dynamic map information between vehicles is required to
widen the visibility area of HD maps to enhance positioning accuracy. The
V2V/V2X communication targeting automated driving requires high data rate, low
latency, and high reliability within a communication range of 150m to 300m,
which can be done in millimeter wave.
### 5.1.10 Data Center Inter-rack Connectivity
{width="2.8847222222222224in" height="1.3534722222222222in"}
Figure 5.1.10-1: Inter-rack wireless connectivity within Data Centers
Wireless connectivity may be used as a secondary interface in lieu of fiber
optic failure for links between racks within a data center. A backup network
relying on wireless technology can be used to increase maximum communication
service availability. Some inter-rack links could be replaced with high
bandwidth and high reliable NR communications. Although use of unlicensed
spectrum could be possible, due to high bandwidth and reliability required for
inter-rack communications use of licensed spectrum, which typically has higher
EIRP allowance, could be useful. The use of wireless communications for some
links within the data center, could potentially reduce cabling complexity and
allow flexible on-demand re-organization of equipment within the facility.
### 5.1.11 Smart grid automation
Electricity distribution possesses high requirements on service availability.
In power **distribution system, while** lower frequencies are more suitable
for long distance wireless inter-substation communication, short range intra-
substation wireless communication can be performed in millimeter wave. The
communication requirements for factory automation and medium and high voltage
electricity distribution are summarized in Table 5.1.11-1.

### 5.1.12 Radar/Positioning
**High positioning accuracy (e.g., error standard deviations of 0.5m or
lower)** in both outdoor and indoor deployments services are critical. Unlike
lower carrier frequencies, where transmission is position agnostic, in
millimeter wave carrier frequencies, positioning information is required to
avoid blocking. In addition, positioning information can also enhance the
process of beam alignment. Beam-related information can be used to localize a
user within a beam or within the intersection of multiple beams, or to enhance
positioning accuracy of existing position systems. In addition, applications
that require high positioning accuracy can benefit from a wide bandwidth,
which facilitates accurate estimation of the time of arrival (ToA) of signals.
Also, the multipath sparsity characteristic of millimeter wave channels,
together with narrow beam antenna systems, contribute to improve angle of
arrival (AoA) estimation, which can in turn be used to enhance the positioning
accuracy.
Radar-like operations (motion detection, positioning, and tracking) integrated
together with access point can provide wide range of services including
security, medical care, and automation.
In automated factories, powerful wireless localization services are often
required for low speed moving objects (including indoor and outdoor), which
can be performed in millimeter wave systems. For example, on the factory
floor, it is desirable to be able to locate moving objects such as forklifts,
or parts to be assembled. This could be achieved with positioning and/or
environmental sensing. Environmental sensing is support for radar applications
identifying objects in the environment and their respective motion. Use of
millimeter wave carrier frequency may allow radar operations that may be
useful for various network operations.
Indoor spaces and dense deployments will benefit from greater spatial
resolution allowing operators and private networks to offer new targeted
services and solutions.
### 5.1.13 Private Networks
Enable easy and cost-effective deployment of industrial private networks
including non-public and closed group access, allowing regional deployment of
closed or semi-closed access such as industrial IoT, in-building network, and
factory areas.
5.1.14 Critical medical communication
As described in TR 22.826 [38], various critical medical use cases require
very high data rates and very low latencies. The huge bandwidths offered by 5G
NR above 52.6 GHz could prove to be essential in order to meet the required
KPIs. One of the primary examples includes a wirelessly connected operating
room that enables real-time streaming of lossless compressed Ultra High
Definition video (from devices, such as an endoscope), and real-time streaming
of uncompressed medical imaging data (from devices, such as 3D UltraSound).
These streams need to be displayed on 4K/8K displays, and possibly be combined
into augmented reality video streams to help a surgeon perform precise
procedures. This typically requires datarates ranging from 4 Gbit/s up to 48
Gbit/s and very low latencies of preferably less than 1ms. Compression is
often not allowed by medical regulations, in order to not generate any
artifacts and enable the most accurate representation to be available to a
surgeon.
Despite the low latency and high datarates required, medical data in general
needs to be transported in a highly secure manner, including being fully
integrity protected as required by medical data protection and privacy
regulations. And of course, the connection has to be highly reliable and very
robust.
## 5.2 Deployment Scenarios
This section describes deployment scenarios applicable for NR operating in
between 52.6GHz and 114.25GHz. The listed deployment scenarios are indoor
hotspot, dense urban, urban micro, urban macro, rural, factory hall, and

### 5.2.1 Indoor hotspot
The indoor hotspot deployment scenario focuses on small coverage per site/TRxP
(transmission and reception point) and high user throughput or user density in
buildings. The key characteristics of this deployment scenario are high
capacity, high user density and consistent user experience indoor. Some
attributes that could be used for evaluation purposes are listed in Table
5.2.1-1.
Table 5.2.1-1: Attributes for indoor hotspot

### 5.2.2 Dense urban
The dense urban microcellular deployment scenario focuses on macro TRxPs with
or without micro TRxPs and high user densities and traffic loads in city
centres and dense urban areas. The key characteristics of this deployment
scenario are high traffic loads, high user density, small coverage, and
outdoor and outdoor-to-indoor coverage for mobile UEs, where UE is provided
with continuous cellular connectivity using a lower frequency while being
served with high traffic loads using frequencies above 52.6 GHz. Additionally,
this deployment scenario can serve outdoor fixed wireless UEs or IABs with
high traffic loads to mimic the last mile distribution networks. This scenario
will be interference-limited, using macro TRxPs with or without micro TRxPs. A
continuous cellular layout and the associated interference shall be assumed.
Some attributes that could be used for evaluation purposes are listed in Table
5.2.2-1.

### 5.2.3 Urban micro
In the Urban micro deployment scenario, the sparse environment with no closely
spaced high buildings are described, such as park areas, university campuses,
stadiums, outdoor festivals, city squares or even rural areas, as transmitted
with mostly LOS is mainly typical in the deployment scenario. Some attributes
that could be used for evaluation purposes are listed in Table 5.2.3-1.

+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Attributes | Values or assumptions | +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Aggregated system bandwidth | Up to 12GHz | +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Layout | Single layer: | | | | | | - Hex.

### 5.2.4 Urban macro
The urban macro deployment scenario focuses on large cells for fixed wireless
UE/IABs. The key characteristics of this scenario are supporting fixed nodes
in urban areas. This scenario will be interference-limited, using macro TRxPs
(i.e. radio access points above rooftop level). Some attributes that could be
used for evaluation purposes are listed in Table 5.2.4-1.
Table 5.2.4-1: Attributes for urban macro
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Attributes | Values or assumptions | +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Aggregated system bandwidth | Up to 12GHz | +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Layout | Single layer: | | | | | | - Hex. Grid | +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | ISD | 500m | +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | User distribution and UE speed | 100% Outdoor (>3km/h), 10 users per TRxP | +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
### 5.2.5 Rural
The rural deployment scenario focuses on larger coverage for fixed wireless
UE/IABs. Although the bands above 52.6GHz have higher propagation loss,
relatively long coverage can still be achieved with line-of-sight transmission
condition and high gain antenna. Therefore, Rural could also be a deployment
scenario for the fixed wireless access and backhaul applications, which have
LOS transmission conditions. The key characteristics of this scenario are wide
area coverage supporting fixed nodes. This scenario will be noise-limited
and/or interference-limited, using macro TRxPs. Some attributes that could be
used for evaluation purposes are listed in Table 5.2.5-1.
Table 5.2.5-1: Attributes for rural scenario
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Attributes | Values or assumptions | +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Aggregated system bandwidth | Up to 12GHz | +--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Layout | Single layer: | | | | | | - Hex.

### 5.2.6 Factory Hall
Similar to the indoor hotspot deployment scenario, factory hall deployment
scenario focuses on medium coverage per site/TRxP and high user throughput and
high user density inside the buildings. The key characteristics of this
deployment scenario are high capacity, high user density and reliable
communications. Some attributes that could be used for evaluation purposes are
listed in Table 5.2.6-1.

distribution and UE speed 100% indoor (\< 3 km/h), 5 \~ 40 user per TRxP.

### 5.2.7 Indoor D2D
In this deployment scenario, usually the low cost device is involved, so the
transmit power is lower and the antenna elements is much smaller compared with
regular UE. The distance between the communicating devices is likely less than
5m and the typical device is pedestrian in this deployment. The system
bandwidth varies depending on the particular services/application. Some
attributes that could be used for evaluation purposes are listed in Table
5.2.7-1.

# 6 System Design Requirements
This section describe some of the system design considerations and
requirements that are important for NR system operating in frequencies between
52.6 GHz and 114.25 GHz.
a) Waveform
\- Power efficiency of power amplifier (PA): PA efficiency at higher frequency
is expected to degrade and low PAPR waveforms designed to minimize PA backoff
and maximize efficiency should be considered. At higher frequencies and
especially in millimetre wave frequencies, output power per transistor as well
as power added efficiency decrease. Waveform with high power back-off to
support EVM and out-of-band emission requirements could dramatically reduce PA
efficiency even further.
\- Dynamic range of ADC and DAC: The increase in PA back-off also affects the
other device requirements, for example, the dynamic range of the ADC and DAC.
A higher Tx DAC effective number of bits (ENOB) is required to accommodate
higher PAPR, and extra oversampling in the baseband DSP, and Tx DAC may be
needed to accommodate wider channel bandwidth. All of these are impacted by
waveform, and therefore should be carefully evaluated.
\- Modulated signal accuracy and out-of-band emission: Power amplifier is
designed and adjusted to meet RF requirements, such as spectral mask emission
(SEM), adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR), in-band emission (IBE) and out-
of-band emission (OBE) requirements, and error vector magnitude (EVM)
requirements. Proper RF requirements are needed to determine appropriate in-
band signal quality characteristics, minimize adjacent channel interference
and impact to signals in adjacent channels. Occupied signal bandwidth and
guardband for a given channel bandwidth in high carrier frequencies above 52.6
GHz require further investigation.
\- Complexity and performance of waveform: Given the high data rate and high
sampling rates the system is expected to operate, the complexity and
performance tradeoff for waveform generation/modulation and
reception/demodulation should be considered.
\- Spectrum flexibility of waveform: Use cases and frequency allocations by
various government bodies may require various bandwidth to be supported.
Therefore, flexibility to support different system bandwidth should be
considered in the design.
\- Robustness to frequency offset and phase noise: Carrier frequency offset
and phase noise is much higher in spectrum beyond 52.6GHz because of
imperfection of PA and crystal oscillator is more severe than that of lower
bands. In addition, Doppler shift/spread is also larger with the carrier
frequency increasing. As a result, robustness on frequency offset and phase
noise is one of the key requirements for systems operating on bands above
52.6GHz. Increasing the subcarrier spacing for CP-OFDM waveform to better cope
with increased phase noise could be investigated. For other potential
waveforms impact from phase noise and ability to robustly handle phase noise
should be investigated.
\- Feature re-usability and design commonality with existing NR specification:
It would be good to be able to support features for FR1 and FR2 as defined in
NR with minimal change (if possible) and support a common design structure
that could support various use cases. To that extent further considerations of
using an integer ratio between clock rates of NR below and NR above 52.6 GHz
should be investigated. One possibility to achieve this would be to maintain
the NR numerology scaling principle but extend to higher numerologies, i.e. Δf
= 2^μ^ × 15 kHz with an appropriate range of possible integer values for μ.
b) MIMO
\- Multi-antenna technology with beamforming: Depending on deploying site and
also applications, various antennas can be used in millimetre communication.
Concerning implementation (e.g., cost, form factor), various type of antennas
can be considered for developing NR above 52.6 GHz. There are four types of
antennas can be considered in this frequency range: Parabolic, lens, waveguide
array, and patch array. Some examples of types of antennas are shown in Figure
6-1 and brief comparison notes are provided in Table 6-1. The design of NR
above 52.6 GHz should not limit the type of antennas and corresponding
beamformed channel should be considered to design physical-layers.

distance PTP Lens Outdoor small cell AP for short/mid-distance PTP Waveguide
array Small cell AP, indoor AP for short/mid-distance PTP Patch array Mobile

* * *
\- Maximum supported layers: Up to two spatial layer could be supported using
polarization diversity. Further study on maximum supported spatial layers
taking into account support for even larger bandwidths and RF design
challenges is needed.
\- Enhanced beam management: Larger antenna arrays is expected to support
certain link budgets in high frequencies due to poorer free space pass loss,
oxygen absorption, and the obstruction loss, even from people or foliage. This
results in pencil-thin beams that require improvements in beam management
robustness and overhead. Methods for managing narrower beams and greater
number of beams should be studied. It should be noted depending on form factor
and device, number of beams supported and beam codebook space could vary.
Therefore, enhancement on discovery and tracking to support various beam
assumptions should be investigated.
\- Enhanced path diversity: The narrow beams achieved with the larger arrays
may result in a higher reliance on LOS paths. To improve coverage at these
frequencies, methods for improving path diversity---increasing the probability
of LOS paths---should be studied. Some examples may include collaborate MIMO
techniques or same frequency multi-connectivity techniques.
\- Multi-cell/panel operation for high reliability and mobility: Considering
propagation characteristics, it may be beneficial to support the near-LOS
condition to UEs by position and angle tracking, and point-beamforming using
massive antenna arrays.
c) Power consumption
\- Compared to NR FR2, operation in the bands beyond 52.6 GHz may pose even
more burden on UE power consumption due to potential large number of beams,
low latency and high data rate transmission/reception (i.e., continuous
processing of large code block, high order modulation, and security related
processing [39]), and PA efficiency losses caused by RF components.
\- Power efficiency in baseband: Power consumption is one of the biggest
problems in millimetre band communication. In addition to the process losses
to the RF devices, the power dissipation in the ADCs is also very large.
Widening the dynamic range required by the ADC when receiving high order
modulation can consume high power. Therefore, power efficiency in both
transmitter and receiver baseband should be considered for NR design above
52.6GHz. Improvement in uplink can be considered to reduce additional power
consumption. For example, a low-power transmit scheme, advanced DTX, and a
low-power beamforming scheme can be considered.
d) Channelization and Bandwidth
\- Bandwidths for the system: Different regulatory bodies are already provide
licensed band allocation with certain bandwidth. For example, 250MHz blocks
that can be aggregated to up to 5 GHz in Europe, South Africa, and Canada,
4.75 GHz blocks in UK, up to 5 GHz and 0.9 GHz blocks in US. Additionally,
802.11ad/ay systems currently support multiple of 2.16 GHz block in unlicensed
spectrum. NR system operating in above 52.6 GHz should consider the above
bandwidths in the system design. Supported bandwidth should weigh in various
considerations, including channelization, and hardware complexity. Wideband
implementation has various implementation challenges, such as IF conversion,
I/Q mismatch, increase of noise power, flatness of filter, and ADC, DAC
performance.
\- Support of configurable bandwidth: NR beyond 52.6 GHz is anticipated to
operate in different bands with different maximum possible bandwidths. NR
beyond 52.6 GHz should therefore -- as NR does -- support configurable
transmission bandwidths. NR should also support relatively narrow bandwidth
smaller than the configured transmission bandwidth to improve RF and baseband
power consumption and potentially to improve coverage with peak power
efficiency. Additionally, support of narrow bandwidth that is smaller than the
configured transmission bandwidth in the UL would help benefit transmission of
HARQ feedback and small payload sizes.
\- Channelization: Supported bandwidths for the system should be considered
during the channelization of NR above 52.6 GHz. The channel definitions may
need to factor into account co-existence with other RAT, such as IEE
802.11ad/ay systems, and various uses cases, such as ITS, IAB, and V2X.
e) Range, availability, and connectivity
\- Use cases for NR above 52.6 GHz can be divided into three classes, a class
for outdoor mid / long-distance such as backhaul or relay, a class for short /
mid-distance such as indoor or outdoor small cell, and a class for adjacent,
near-field device or isolated area. Long distance classes, which include
backhaul, can support up to 1 to 3 km range under LOS conditions and weather
conditions. The inter-cell distance for outdoor small cells is assumed to be
within a few hundred meters and the size of a floor or a room is assumed to be
within tens of meters. Between devices or servers, less than 5 m range would
be sufficient to minimize link interference.
\- Services provided by backhaul, the reliability of the wired network should
be guaranteed. For indoor scenario, can guarantee higher availability as it is
not effected by weather condition but it should consider the availability
depending on the application services. For example, IIoT services may require
URLLC-like (e.g. low BLER of 10^-5^) availability.
\- Table 6-2 show a summary of range, availability, and connectivity for NR
above 52.6GHz. P-to-P in the connectivity column refers to point to point
connection, and P-to-MP in the connectivity column refers to point to multi-
point connection.
Table 6-2: Range, availability, and connectivity
* * *
                          Target range (m)   Availability (%)    Connectivity
Backhaul/fronthaul \< 500-3000 m 99.99 -- 99.999 % P-to-P Outdoor small cell
\< 100 m 99. 9 -- 99.99 % P-to-MP Indoor hotspot/IoT \<20 m 99.9 -- 99.9999 %
P-to-MP Personal area network \< 5 m 99.9 -- 99.99 % P-to-P
* * *
f) Spectrum regime considerations
\- Frequency range above 52.6 GHz covers not only unlicensed spectrum but also
licensed spectrum. Additionally, ECC/CEPT has set 63- 64 GHz as harmonized
implementation of ITS. The licensed spectrum in the range is often dedicated
to fixed links and could be used by IAB. So spectrum for 52.6 GHz would need
to support systems that enable various target use cases spanning from
unlicensed operation to V2X, IAB, and eMBB. Additionally, coexistence with
802.11ad and 802.11ay on the 60GHz unlicensed spectrum may need to be
considered.
\- It would be preferred if similar system framework supports wide range of
uses cases without significant specification effort or at the least the
initial system framework support forward compatibility that allows extension
to address various and different use cases.
g) Other design considerations
\- Latency: For some uses cases and application services, the overall latency
should be small enough to facilitate nominal operation of the application
services. NR above 52.6GHz should support low latency operations.
\- Mobility support: For many use cases and deployment scenarios, low mobility
is common assumption. Even for ITS/V2X use cases, low relative speed between
the Tx and the Rx can be expected. Support for high mobility may not need to
be prioritized as high layer mobility procedures could rely on low frequency
bands with CA/DC operations.
\- Standalone and Non-standalone operations: Some use cases may not require
standalone operation at bands beyond 52.6 GHz. For example, high data rate
eMBB and mobile data offloading scenarios where wide area coverage is provided
via another frequency band (e.g. lower band in FR1/FR2). Also some uses cases
are suitable for standalone operations. For example, short-range high-data
rate D2D communications and/or Industrial IoT. In scenarios that require
standalone operations, initial access and related procedure should be studied
including study on whether existing NR features and functionality are
sufficient.
# 7 Conclusion
This study focused on three aspects, (i) survey of regulatory requirements for
spectrum between 52.6 GHz and 114.25GHz, (ii) identification of deployment
scenarios and uses cases for the same frequency, and (iii) identification of
