# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Dormant BWP:** The dormant BWP is one of downlink BWPs configured by the
network via dedicated RRC signalling. In the dormant BWP, the UE stop
monitoring PDCCH on/for the SCell, but continues performing CSI measurements,
Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and beam management, if configured.
**DRX group:** **A group of Serving Cells that is configured by RRC and that
have the same DRX Active Time.**
**HARQ information:** HARQ information for DL-SCH, for UL-SCH, or for SL-SCH
transmissions consists of New Data Indicator (NDI), Transport Block Size
(TBS), Redundancy Version (RV), and HARQ process ID.
**IAB-donor:** gNB that provides network access to UEs via a network of
backhaul and access links.
**IAB-node:** RAN node that supports NR access links to UEs and NR backhaul
links to parent nodes and child nodes.
**Listen Before Talk** : A procedure according to which transmissions are not
performed if the channel is identified as being occupied, see TS 37.213 [18].
**Msg3** : Message transmitted on UL-SCH containing a C-RNTI MAC CE or CCCH
SDU, submitted from upper layer and associated with the UE Contention
Resolution Identity, as part of a Random Access procedure.
**NR backhaul link:** NR link used for backhauling between an IAB-node and an
IAB-donor, and between IAB-nodes in case of a multi-hop backhauling.
**NR sidelink communication** : AS functionality enabling at least V2X
Communication as defined in TS 23.287 [19], between two or more nearby UEs,
using NR technology but not traversing any network node.
**PDCCH occasion** : A time duration (i.e. one or a consecutive number of
symbols) during which the MAC entity is configured to monitor the PDCCH.
**Serving Cell:** A PCell, a PSCell, or an SCell in TS 38.331 [5].
**Sidelink transmission information:** Sidelink transmission information
included in an SCI for an SL-SCH transmission as specified in clause 8.3 and
8.4 of TS 38.212 [9] consists of Sidelink HARQ information including NDI, RV,
Sidelink process ID, HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator, Sidelink
identification information including cast type indicator, Source Layer-1 ID
and Destination Layer-1 ID, and Sidelink other information including CSI
request, a priority, a communication range requirement and Zone ID.
**Special Cell:** For Dual Connectivity operation the term Special Cell refers
to the PCell of the MCG or the PSCell of the SCG depending on if the MAC
entity is associated to the MCG or the SCG, respectively. Otherwise the term
Special Cell refers to the PCell. A Special Cell supports PUCCH transmission
and contention-based Random Access, and is always activated.
**Timing Advance Group:** A group of Serving Cells that is configured by RRC
and that, for the cells with a UL configured, using the same timing reference
cell and the same Timing Advance value. A Timing Advance Group containing the
SpCell of a MAC entity is referred to as Primary Timing Advance Group (PTAG),
whereas the term Secondary Timing Advance Group (STAG) refers to other TAGs.
**V2X sidelink communication** : AS functionality enabling V2X Communication
as defined in TS 23.285 [20], between nearby UEs, using E-UTRA technology but
not traversing any network node.
NOTE 1: A timer is running once it is started, until it is stopped or until it
expires; otherwise it is not running. A timer can be started if it is not
running or restarted if it is running. A Timer is always started or restarted
from its initial value. The duration of a timer is not updated until it is
stopped or expires (e.g. due to BWP switching). When the MAC entity applies
zero value for a timer, the timer shall be started and immediately expire
unless explicitly stated otherwise.
NOTE 2: In this version of the specification, the SRS in the procedural
description includes Positioning SRS and Positioning SRS is treated the same
as SRS by the UE unless explicitly stated otherwise.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Introduction
The objective of this clause is to describe the MAC architecture and the MAC
entity of the UE from a functional point of view.
## 4.2 MAC architecture
### 4.2.1 General
This clause describes a model of the MAC i.e. it does not specify or restrict
implementations.
RRC is in control of the MAC configuration.
### 4.2.2 MAC Entities
The MAC entity of the UE handles the following transport channels:
\- Broadcast Channel (BCH);
\- Downlink Shared Channel(s) (DL-SCH);
\- Paging Channel (PCH);
\- Uplink Shared Channel(s) (UL-SCH);
\- Random Access Channel(s) (RACH).
When the UE is configured with SCG, two MAC entities are configured to the UE:
one for the MCG and one for the SCG.
When the UE is configured with DAPS handover, two MAC entities are used by the
UE: one for the source cell (source MAC entity) and one for the target cell
(target MAC entity).
The functions of the different MAC entities in the UE operate independently
unless otherwise specified. The timers and parameters used in each MAC entity
are configured independently unless otherwise specified. The Serving Cells,
C-RNTI, radio bearers, logical channels, upper and lower layer entities, LCGs,
and HARQ entities considered by each MAC entity refer to those mapped to that
MAC entity unless otherwise specified.
If the MAC entity is configured with one or more SCells, there are multiple
DL-SCH and there may be multiple UL-SCH as well as multiple RACH per MAC
entity; one DL-SCH, one UL-SCH, and one RACH on the SpCell, one DL-SCH, zero
or one UL-SCH and zero or one RACH for each SCell.
If the MAC entity is not configured with any SCell, there is one DL-SCH, one
UL-SCH, and one RACH per MAC entity.
Figure 4.2.2-1 illustrates one possible structure of the MAC entity when SCG
is not configured and for each MAC entity during DAPS handover.
Figure 4.2.2-1: MAC structure overview
Figure 4.2.2-2 illustrates one possible structure for the MAC entities when
MCG and SCG are configured.
Figure 4.2.2-2: MAC structure overview with two MAC entities
In addition, the MAC entity of the UE handles the following transport channel
for sidelink:
\- Sidelink Shared Channel (SL-SCH);
\- Sidelink Broadcast Channel (SL-BCH).
Figure 4.2.2-3 illustrates one possible structure for the MAC entity when
sidelink is configured.

## 4.3 Services
### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers
The MAC sublayer provides the following services to upper layers:
\- data transfer;
\- radio resource allocation.
### 4.3.2 Services expected from physical layer
The MAC sublayer expects the following services from the physical layer:
\- data transfer services;
\- signalling of HARQ feedback;
\- signalling of Scheduling Request;
\- measurements (e.g. Channel Quality Indication (CQI)).
## 4.4 Functions
The MAC sublayer supports the following functions:
\- mapping between logical channels and transport channels;
\- multiplexing of MAC SDUs from one or different logical channels onto
transport blocks (TB) to be delivered to the physical layer on transport
channels;
\- demultiplexing of MAC SDUs to one or different logical channels from
transport blocks (TB) delivered from the physical layer on transport channels;
\- scheduling information reporting;
\- error correction through HARQ;
\- logical channel prioritization;
\- priority handling between overlapping resources of one UE;
\- radio resource selection.
The relevance of MAC functions for uplink, downlink, and sidelink is indicated
in Table 4.4-1.

## 4.5 Channel structure
### 4.5.1 General
The MAC sublayer operates on the channels defined below; transport channels
are SAPs between MAC and Layer 1, logical channels are SAPs between MAC and
RLC.

### 4.5.3 Logical Channels
The MAC sublayer provides data transfer services on logical channels. To
accommodate different kinds of data transfer services, multiple types of
logical channels are defined i.e. each supporting transfer of a particular
type of information.
Each logical channel type is defined by what type of information is
transferred.
The MAC sublayer provides the control and traffic channels listed in Table
4.5.3-1 below.

# 5 MAC procedures
## 5.1 Random Access procedure
### 5.1.1 Random Access procedure initialization
The Random Access procedure described in this clause is initiated by a PDCCH
order, by the MAC entity itself, or by RRC for the events in accordance with
TS 38.300 [2]. There is only one Random Access procedure ongoing at any point
in time in a MAC entity. The Random Access procedure on an SCell shall only be
initiated by a PDCCH order with _ra-PreambleIndex_ different from 0b000000.
NOTE 1: If a new Random Access procedure is triggered while another is already
ongoing in the MAC entity, it is up to UE implementation whether to continue
with the ongoing procedure or start with the new procedure (e.g. for SI
request).
NOTE 2: If there was an ongoing Random Access procedure that is triggered by a
PDCCH order while the UE receives another PDCCH order indicating the same
Random Access Preamble, PRACH mask index and uplink carrier, the Random Access
procedure is considered as the same Random Access procedure as the ongoing one
and not initialized again.
RRC configures the following parameters for the Random Access procedure:
\- _prach-ConfigurationIndex_ : the available set of PRACH occasions for the
transmission of the Random Access Preamble for Msg1. These are also applicable
to the MSGA PRACH if the PRACH occasions are shared between 2-step and 4-step
RA types;

_BeamFailureRecoveryConfig_ IE;
\- _rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS_ : an RSRP threshold for the selection of CSI-RS for
4-step RA type. If the Random Access procedure is initiated for beam failure
recovery, _rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS_ is equal to _rsrp-ThresholdSSB_ in
_BeamFailureRecoveryConfig_ IE;

upper layers.
## 5.2 Maintenance of Uplink Time Alignment
RRC configures the following parameters for the maintenance of UL time
alignment:
\- _timeAlignmentTimer_ (per TAG) which controls how long the MAC entity
considers the Serving Cells belonging to the associated TAG to be uplink time
aligned.
The MAC entity shall:
1> when a Timing Advance Command MAC CE is received, and if an N~TA~ (as
defined in TS 38.211 [8]) has been maintained with the indicated TAG:
2> apply the Timing Advance Command for the indicated TAG;
2> start or restart the _timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with the indicated
TAG.
1> when a Timing Advance Command is received in a Random Access Response
message for a Serving Cell belonging to a TAG or in a MSGB for an SpCell:
2> if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity among the
contention-based Random Access Preamble:
3> apply the Timing Advance Command for this TAG;
3> start or restart the _timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with this TAG.
2> else if the _timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with this TAG is not running:
3> apply the Timing Advance Command for this TAG;
3> start the _timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with this TAG;
3> when the Contention Resolution is considered not successful as described in
clause 5.1.5; or
3> when the Contention Resolution is considered successful for SI request as
described in clause 5.1.5, after transmitting HARQ feedback for MAC PDU
including UE Contention Resolution Identity MAC CE:
4> stop _timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with this TAG.
2> else:
3> ignore the received Timing Advance Command.
1> when an Absolute Timing Advance Command is received in response to a MSGA
transmission including C-RNTI MAC CE as specified in clause 5.1.4a:
2> apply the Timing Advance Command for PTAG;
2> start or restart the _timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with PTAG.
1> when a _timeAlignmentTimer_ expires:
2> if the _timeAlignmentTimer_ is associated with the PTAG:
3> flush all HARQ buffers for all Serving Cells;
3> notify RRC to release PUCCH for all Serving Cells, if configured;
3> notify RRC to release SRS for all Serving Cells, if configured;
3> clear any configured downlink assignments and configured uplink grants;
3> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting;
3> consider all running _timeAlignmentTimer_ s as expired;
3> maintain N~TA~ (defined in TS 38.211 [8]) of all TAGs.
2> else if the _timeAlignmentTimer_ is associated with an STAG, then for all
Serving Cells belonging to this TAG:
3> flush all HARQ buffers;
3> notify RRC to release PUCCH, if configured;
3> notify RRC to release SRS, if configured;
3> clear any configured downlink assignments and configured uplink grants;
3> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting;
3> maintain N~TA~ (defined in TS 38.211 [8]) of this TAG.
When the MAC entity stops uplink transmissions for an SCell due to the fact
that the maximum uplink transmission timing difference between TAGs of the MAC
entity or the maximum uplink transmission timing difference between TAGs of
any MAC entity of the UE is exceeded, the MAC entity considers the
_timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with the SCell as expired.
The MAC entity shall not perform any uplink transmission on a Serving Cell
except the Random Access Preamble and MSGA transmission when the
_timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with the TAG to which this Serving Cell
belongs is not running. Furthermore, when the _timeAlignmentTimer_ associated
with the PTAG is not running, the MAC entity shall not perform any uplink
transmission on any Serving Cell except the Random Access Preamble and MSGA
transmission on the SpCell.
## 5.3 DL-SCH data transfer
### 5.3.1 DL Assignment reception
Downlink assignments received on the PDCCH both indicate that there is a
transmission on a DL-SCH for a particular MAC entity and provide the relevant
HARQ information.
When the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, Temporary C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, the MAC entity
shall for each PDCCH occasion during which it monitors PDCCH and for each
Serving Cell:
1> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion and this Serving Cell has
been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, or Temporary Câ€‘RNTI:
2> if this is the first downlink assignment for this Temporary C-RNTI:
3> consider the NDI to have been toggled.
2> if the downlink assignment is for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, and if the
previous downlink assignment indicated to the HARQ entity of the same HARQ
process was either a downlink assignment received for the MAC entity\'s CS-
RNTI or a configured downlink assignment:
3> consider the NDI to have been toggled regardless of the value of the NDI.
2> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment and deliver the associated
HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
1> else if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been received for
this Serving Cell on the PDCCH for the MAC entity\'s CS-RNTI:
2> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 1:
3> consider the NDI for the corresponding HARQ process not to have been
toggled;
3> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment for this Serving Cell and
deliver the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
2> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 0:
3> if PDCCH contents indicate SPS deactivation:
4> clear the configured downlink assignment for this Serving Cell (if any);
4> if the _timeAlignmentTimer_ , associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is running:
5> indicate a positive acknowledgement for the SPS deactivation to the
physical layer.
3> else if PDCCH content indicates SPS activation:
4> store the downlink assignment for this Serving Cell and the associated HARQ
information as configured downlink assignment;
4> initialise or re-initialise the configured downlink assignment for this
Serving Cell to start in the associated PDSCH duration and to recur according
to rules in clause 5.8.1;
For each Serving Cell and each configured downlink assignment, if configured
and activated, the MAC entity shall:
1> if the PDSCH duration of the configured downlink assignment does not
overlap with the PDSCH duration of a downlink assignment received on the PDCCH
for this Serving Cell:
2> instruct the physical layer to receive, in this PDSCH duration, transport
block on the DL-SCH according to the configured downlink assignment and to
deliver it to the HARQ entity;
2> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PDSCH
duration;
2> consider the NDI bit for the corresponding HARQ process to have been
toggled;
2> indicate the presence of a configured downlink assignment and deliver the
stored HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
For configured downlink assignments without _harq-ProcID-Offset_ , the HARQ
Process ID associated with the slot where the DL transmission starts is
derived from the following equation:
HARQ Process ID = [floor (CURRENT_slot Ã— 10 / (_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã—
_periodicity_))] modulo _nrofHARQ-Processes_
where CURRENT_slot = [(SFN Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_) + slot number in the
frame] and _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ refers to the number of consecutive slots
per frame as specified in TS 38.211 [8].
For configured downlink assignments with _harq-ProcID-Offset_ , the HARQ
Process ID associated with the slot where the DL transmission starts is
derived from the following equation:
HARQ Process ID = [floor (CURRENT_slot Ã— 10 / (_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã—
_periodicity)_)] modulo _nrofHARQ-Processes_ \+ _harq-ProcID-Offset_
where CURRENT_slot = [(SFN Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_) + slot number in the
frame] and _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ refers to the number of consecutive slots
per frame as specified in TS 38.211 [8].
NOTE 1: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of
the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the HARQ Process ID used for
configured downlink assignments.
NOTE 2: CURRENT_slot refers to the slot index of the first transmission
occasion of a bundle of configured downlink assignment.
When the MAC entity needs to read BCCH, the MAC entity may, based on the
scheduling information from RRC:
1> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been received on the
PDCCH for the SI-RNTI;
2> indicate a downlink assignment and redundancy version for the dedicated
broadcast HARQ process to the HARQ entity.
### 5.3.2 HARQ operation
#### 5.3.2.1 HARQ Entity
The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell, which maintains a
number of parallel HARQ processes. Each HARQ process is associated with a HARQ
process identifier. The HARQ entity directs HARQ information and associated
TBs received on the DL-SCH to the corresponding HARQ processes (see clause
5.3.2.2).
The number of parallel DL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in TS
38.214 [7]. The dedicated broadcast HARQ process is used for BCCH.
The HARQ process supports one TB when the physical layer is not configured for
downlink spatial multiplexing. The HARQ process supports one or two TBs when
the physical layer is configured for downlink spatial multiplexing.
When the MAC entity is configured with _pdsch-AggregationFactor_ > 1, the
parameter _pdsch-AggregationFactor_ provides the number of transmissions of a
TB within a bundle of the downlink assignment. Bundling operation relies on
the HARQ entity for invoking the same HARQ process for each transmission that
is part of the same bundle. After the initial transmission, _pdsch-
AggregationFactor_ \-- 1 HARQ retransmissions follow within a bundle.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if a downlink assignment has been indicated:
2> allocate the TB(s) received from the physical layer and the associated HARQ
information to the HARQ process indicated by the associated HARQ information.
1> if a downlink assignment has been indicated for the broadcast HARQ process:
2> allocate the received TB to the broadcast HARQ process.
#### 5.3.2.2 HARQ process
When a transmission takes place for the HARQ process, one or two (in case of
downlink spatial multiplexing) TBs and the associated HARQ information are
received from the HARQ entity.
For each received TB and associated HARQ information, the HARQ process shall:
1> if the NDI, when provided, has been toggled compared to the value of the
previous received transmission corresponding to this TB; or
1> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process, and this is the
first received transmission for the TB according to the system information
schedule indicated by RRC; or
1> if this is the very first received transmission for this TB (i.e. there is
no previous NDI for this TB):
2> consider this transmission to be a new transmission.
1> else:
2> consider this transmission to be a retransmission.
The MAC entity then shall:
1> if this is a new transmission:
2> attempt to decode the received data.
1> else if this is a retransmission:
2> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:
3> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the data
currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the combined
data.
1> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was successfully
decoded for this TB; or
1> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:
2> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process:
3> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
2> else if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this TB:
3> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing entity.
1> else:
2> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer for this
TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.
1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a
Temporary C-RNTI and the Contention Resolution is not yet successful (see
clause 5.1.5); or
1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a
MSGB-RNTI and the Random Access procedure is not yet successfully completed
(see clause 5.1.4a); or
1> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process; or
1> if the _timeAlignmentTimer_ , associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped or
expired:
2> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data
in this TB.
1> else:
2> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in
this TB.
The MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all downlink assignments on PDCCH
for its Temporary C-RNTI when determining if NDI on PDCCH for its C-RNTI has
been toggled compared to the value in the previous transmission.
NOTE: If the MAC entity receives a retransmission with a TB size different
from the last TB size signalled for this TB, the UE behavior is left up to UE
implementation.
### 5.3.3 Disassembly and demultiplexing
The MAC entity shall disassemble and demultiplex a MAC PDU as defined in
clauses 6.1.2 and 6.1.5a.
## 5.4 UL-SCH data transfer
### 5.4.1 UL Grant reception
Uplink grant is either received dynamically on the PDCCH, in a Random Access
Response, configured semi-persistently by RRC or determined to be associated
with the PUSCH resource of MSGA as specified in clause 5.1.2a. The MAC entity
shall have an uplink grant to transmit on the UL-SCH. To perform the requested
transmissions, the MAC layer receives HARQ information from lower layers. An
uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI = 0 is considered as a configured
uplink grant. An uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI = 1 is considered
as a dynamic uplink grant.
If the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, a Temporary C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, the MAC entity
shall for each PDCCH occasion and for each Serving Cell belonging to a TAG
that has a running _timeAlignmentTimer_ and for each grant received for this
PDCCH occasion:
1> if an uplink grant for this Serving Cell has been received on the PDCCH for
the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI or Temporary C-RNTI; or
1> if an uplink grant has been received in a Random Access Response:
2> if the uplink grant is for MAC entity\'s C-RNTI and if the previous uplink
grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same HARQ process was either an
uplink grant received for the MAC entity\'s CS-RNTI or a configured uplink
grant:
3> consider the NDI to have been toggled for the corresponding HARQ process
regardless of the value of the NDI.
2> if the uplink grant is for MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, and the identified HARQ
process is configured for a configured uplink grant:
3> start or restart the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ
process, if configured.
3> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process, if
running.
2> deliver the uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.
1> else if an uplink grant for this PDCCH occasion has been received for this
Serving Cell on the PDCCH for the MAC entity\'s CS-RNTI:
2> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 1:
3> consider the NDI for the corresponding HARQ process not to have been
toggled;
3> start or restart the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ
process, if configured;
3> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process, if
running;
3> deliver the uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.
2> else if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 0:
3> if PDCCH contents indicate configured grant Type 2 deactivation:
4> trigger configured uplink grant confirmation.
3> else if PDCCH contents indicate configured grant Type 2 activation:
4> trigger configured uplink grant confirmation;
4> store the uplink grant for this Serving Cell and the associated HARQ
information as configured uplink grant;
4> initialise or re-initialise the configured uplink grant for this Serving
Cell to start in the associated PUSCH duration and to recur according to rules
in clause 5.8.2;
4> stop the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process, if
running;
4> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process, if
running.
For each Serving Cell and each configured uplink grant, if configured and
activated, the MAC entity shall:
1> if the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , and the
PUSCH duration of the configured uplink grant does not overlap with the PUSCH
duration of an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or with the
PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or the PUSCH
duration of a MSGA payload for this Serving Cell; or
1> if the MAC entity is not configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , and
the PUSCH duration of the configured uplink grant does not overlap with the
PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or in a Random Access
Response or the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload for this Serving Cell:
2> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PUSCH
duration;
2> if, for the corresponding HARQ process, the _configuredGrantTimer_ is not
running and _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ is not configured (i.e. new
transmission):
3> consider the NDI bit for the corresponding HARQ process to have been
toggled;
3> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to
the HARQ entity.
2> else if the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process is
configured and not running, then for the corresponding HARQ process:
3> if the _configuredGrantTimer_ is not running, and the HARQ process is not
pending (i.e. new transmission):
4> consider the NDI bit to have been toggled;
4> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to
the HARQ entity.
3> else if the previous uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same
HARQ process was a configured uplink grant (i.e. retransmission on configured
grant):
4> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to
the HARQ entity.
For configured uplink grants neither configured with _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ nor
with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ , the HARQ Process ID associated with the first
symbol of a UL transmission is derived from the following equation:
HARQ Process ID = [floor(CURRENT_symbol/_periodicity_)] modulo _nrofHARQ-
Processes_
For configured uplink grants with _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ , the HARQ Process ID
associated with the first symbol of a UL transmission is derived from the
following equation:
HARQ Process ID = [floor(CURRENT_symbol / _periodicity_)] modulo _nrofHARQ-
Processes_ \+ _harq-ProcID-Offset2_
where CURRENT_symbol = (SFN Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã—
_numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \+ slot number in the frame Ã—
_numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \+ symbol number in the slot), and
_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ and _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ refer to the number of
consecutive slots per frame and the number of consecutive symbols per slot,
respectively as specified in TS 38.211 [8].
For configured uplink grants configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ , the UE
implementation selects an HARQ Process ID among the HARQ process IDs available
for the configured grant configuration. For HARQ Process ID selection, the UE
shall prioritize retransmissions before initial transmissions. The UE shall
toggle the NDI in the CG-UCI for new transmissions and not toggle the NDI in
the CG-UCI in retransmissions.
NOTE 1: CURRENT_symbol refers to the symbol index of the first transmission
occasion of a bundle of configured uplink grant.
NOTE 2: A HARQ process is configured for a configured uplink grant where
neither _harq-ProcID-Offset_ nor _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ is configured, if the
configured uplink grant is activated and the associated HARQ process ID is
less than _nrofHARQ-Processes_. A HARQ process is configured for a configured
uplink grant where _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ is configured, if the configured
uplink grant is activated and the associated HARQ process ID is greater than
or equal to _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ and less than sum of _harq-ProcID-Offset2_
and _nrofHARQ-Processes_ for the configured grant configuration.
NOTE 3: If the MAC entity receives a grant in a Random Access Response (i.e.
MAC RAR or fallbackRAR), or addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or determines a
grant as specified in clause 5.1.2a for MSGA payload and if the MAC entity
also receives an overlapping grant for its C-RNTI or CS-RNTI, requiring
concurrent transmissions on the SpCell, the MAC entity may choose to continue
with either the grant for its RA-RNTI/Temporary C-RNTI/MSGB-RNTI/the MSGA
payload transmission or the grant for its C-RNTI or CS-RNTI.
NOTE 4: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of
the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the HARQ Process ID used for
configured uplink grants.
> NOTE 5: If _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ is not configured, a HARQ process is not
> shared between different configured grant configurations in the same BWP.
For the MAC entity configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , priority of an
uplink grant is determined by the highest priority among priorities of the
logical channels that are multiplexed (i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is already
stored in the HARQ buffer) or have data available that can be multiplexed
(i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is not stored in the HARQ buffer) in the MAC
PDU, according to the mapping restrictions as described in clause 5.4.3.1.2.
The priority of an uplink grant for which no data for logical channels is
multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU is lower than either the
priority of an uplink grant for which data for any logical channels is
multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU or the priority of the
logical channel triggering an SR.
For the MAC entity configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , if the
corresponding PUSCH transmission of a configured uplink grant is cancelled by
CI-RNTI as specified in clause 11.2A of TS 38.213 [6] or cancelled by a high
PHY-priority PUCCH transmission as specified in clause 9 of TS 38.213 [6],
this configured uplink grant is considered as a de-prioritized uplink grant.
If this de-prioritized uplink grant is configured with _autonomousTx_ , the
_configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of this de-
prioritized uplink grant shall be stopped if it is running.
When the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , for each
uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity and whose associated PUSCH can be
transmitted by lower layers, the MAC entity shall:
1> if this uplink grant is received in a Random Access Response (i.e. in a MAC
RAR or fallback RAR), or addressed to Temporary C-RNTI, or is determined as
specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload:
2> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant.
1> else if this uplink grant is addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI = 1 or C-RNTI:
2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of a configured uplink grant
which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP whose priority is higher
than the priority of the uplink grant; and
2> if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was
not already de-prioritized and the priority of the logical channel that
triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:
3> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant;
3> consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized
uplink grant(s);
3> consider the other overlapping SR transmission(s), if any, as a de-
prioritized SR transmission(s).
1> else if this uplink grant is a configured uplink grant:
2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of another configured uplink
grant which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is
higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and
2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to
CS-RNTI with NDI = 1 or C-RNTI which was not already de-prioritized, in the
same BWP, whose priority is higher than or equal to the priority of the uplink
grant; and
2> if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was
not already de-prioritized and the priority of the logical channel that
triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:
3> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant;
3> consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized
uplink grant(s);
3> if the de-prioritized uplink grant(s) is a configured uplink grant
configured with _autonomousTx_ whose PUSCH has already started:
4> stop the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of the
de-prioritized uplink grant(s).
3> consider the other overlapping SR transmission(s), if any, as a de-
prioritized SR transmission(s).
NOTE 6: If the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ and if
there is overlapping PUSCH duration of at least two configured uplink grants
whose priorities are equal, the prioritized uplink grant is determined by UE
implementation.
NOTE 7: If the MAC entity is not configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ and
if there is overlapping PUSCH duration of at least two configured uplink
grants, it is up to UE implementation to choose one of the configured uplink
grants.
NOTE 8: If the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization,_ the
MAC entity does not take UCI multiplexing according to the procedure specified
in TS 38.213 [6] into account when determining whether the PUSCH duration of
an uplink grant overlaps with the PUCCH resource for an SR transmission.
### 5.4.2 HARQ operation
#### 5.4.2.1 HARQ Entity
The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell with configured
uplink (including the case when it is configured with _supplementaryUplink_),
which maintains a number of parallel HARQ processes.
The number of parallel UL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in TS
38.214 [7].
Each HARQ process supports one TB.
Each HARQ process is associated with a HARQ process identifier. For UL
transmission with UL grant in RA Response or for UL transmission for MSGA
payload, HARQ process identifier 0 is used.
NOTE: When a single DCI is used to schedule multiple PUSCH, the UE is allowed
to map generated TB(s) internally to different HARQ processes in case of LBT
failure(s), i.e. UE may transmit a new TB on any HARQ process in the grants
that have the same TBS, the same RV and the NDIs indicate new transmission.
The maximum number of transmissions of a TB within a bundle of the dynamic
grant or configured grant is given by _REPETITION_NUMBER_ as follows:
\- For a dynamic grant, _REPETITION_NUMBER_ is set to a value provided by
lower layers, as specified in clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 38.214 [7];
\- For a configured grant, _REPETITION_NUMBER_ is set to a value provided by
lower layers, as specified in clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [7].
If _REPETITION_NUMBER_ > 1, after the first transmission within a bundle, at
most _REPETITION_NUMBER_ \-- 1 HARQ retransmissions follow within the bundle.
For both dynamic grant and configured uplink grant, bundling operation relies
on the HARQ entity for invoking the same HARQ process for each transmission
that is part of the same bundle. Within a bundle, HARQ retransmissions are
triggered without waiting for feedback from previous transmission according to
_REPETITION_NUMBER_ for a dynamic grant or configured uplink grant unless they
are terminated as specified in clause 6.1 of TS 38.214 [7]. Each transmission
within a bundle is a separate uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity.
For each transmission within a bundle of the dynamic grant, the sequence of
redundancy versions is determined according to clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 38.214
[7]. For each transmission within a bundle of the configured uplink grant, the
sequence of redundancy versions is determined according to clause 6.1.2.3 of
TS 38.214 [7].
For each uplink grant, the HARQ entity shall:
1> identify the HARQ process associated with this grant, and for each
identified HARQ process:
2> if the received grant was not addressed to a Temporary C-RNTI on PDCCH, and
the NDI provided in the associated HARQ information has been toggled compared
to the value in the previous transmission of this TB of this HARQ process; or
2> if the uplink grant was received on PDCCH for the C-RNTI and the HARQ
buffer of the identified process is empty; or
2> if the uplink grant was received in a Random Access Response (i.e. in a MAC
RAR or a fallback RAR); or
2> if the uplink grant was determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the
transmission of the MSGA payload; or
2> if the uplink grant was received on PDCCH for the C-RNTI in _ra-
ResponseWindow_ and this PDCCH successfully completed the Random Access
procedure initiated for beam failure recovery; or
2> if the uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant, and
may be used for initial transmission according to clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214
[7], and if no MAC PDU has been obtained for this bundle:
3> if there is a MAC PDU in the MSGA buffer and the uplink grant determined as
specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload was
selected; or
3> if there is a MAC PDU in the MSGA buffer and the uplink grant was received
in a fallbackRAR and this fallbackRAR successfully completed the Random Access
procedure:
4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the MSGA buffer.
3> else if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was
received in a fallbackRAR:
4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Msg3 buffer.
3> else if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was
received in a MAC RAR; or
3> if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was received
on PDCCH for the C-RNTI in _ra-ResponseWindow_ and this PDCCH successfully
completed the Random Access procedure initiated for beam failure recovery:
4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Msg3 buffer.
4> if the uplink grant size does not match with size of the obtained MAC PDU;
and
4> if the Random Access procedure was successfully completed upon receiving
the uplink grant:
5> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include MAC subPDU(s)
carrying MAC SDU from the obtained MAC PDU in the subsequent uplink
transmission;
5> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly entity.
3> else if this uplink grant is a configured grant configured with
_autonomousTx_ ; and
3> if the previous configured uplink grant, in the BWP, for this HARQ process
was not prioritized; and
3> if a MAC PDU had already been obtained for this HARQ process; and
3> if the uplink grant size matches with size of the obtained MAC PDU; and
3> if none of PUSCH transmission(s) of the obtained MAC PDU has been
completely performed:

and

from lower layers:

Cell; or

4> if the uplink grant is addressed to C-RNTI, and the identified HARQ process
is configured for a configured uplink grant:

corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure
indication is not received from lower layers.
4> if the uplink grant is a configured uplink grant:
5> if the identified HARQ process is pending:
6> start or restart the _configuredGrantTimer, if configured,_ for the
corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure
indication is not received from lower layers;
5> start or restart the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ , if configured, for the
corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure
indication is not received from lower layers.
4> if the identified HARQ process is pending and the transmission is performed
and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers:
5> consider the identified HARQ process as not pending.
When determining if NDI has been toggled compared to the value in the previous
transmission the MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all uplink grants on
PDCCH for its Temporary C-RNTI.
When _configuredGrantTimer_ or _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ is started or
restarted by a PUSCH transmission, it shall be started at the beginning of the
first symbol of the PUSCH transmission.
#### 5.4.2.2 HARQ process
Each HARQ process is associated with a HARQ buffer.
New transmissions are performed on the resource and with the MCS indicated on
PDCCH or indicated in the Random Access Response (i.e. MAC RAR or
fallbackRAR), or signalled in RRC or determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for MSGA payload. Retransmissions are performed on the resource and, if
provided, with the MCS indicated on PDCCH, or on the same resource and with
the same MCS as was used for last made transmission attempt within a bundle,
or on stored configured uplink grant resources and stored MCS when _cg-
RetransmissionTimer_ is configured. If _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ is configured,
retransmissions with the same HARQ process may be performed on any configured
grant configuration if the configured grant configurations have the same TBS.
When _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ is configured and the HARQ entity obtains a MAC
PDU to transmit and LBT failure indication is received from lower layer, the
corresponding HARQ process is considered to be pending. For a configured
uplink grant, configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer,_ each associated HARQ
process is considered as not pending when:
\- a transmission is performed on that HARQ process and LBT failure indication
is not received from lower layers; or
\- the configured uplink grant is initialised and this HARQ process is not
associated with another active configured uplink grant; or
\- the HARQ buffer for this HARQ process is flushed.
If the HARQ entity requests a new transmission for a TB, the HARQ process
shall:
1> store the MAC PDU in the associated HARQ buffer;
1> store the uplink grant received from the HARQ entity;
1> generate a transmission as described below.
If the HARQ entity requests a retransmission for a TB, the HARQ process shall:
1> store the uplink grant received from the HARQ entity;
1> generate a transmission as described below.
To generate a transmission for a TB, the HARQ process shall:
1> if the MAC PDU was obtained from the Msg3 buffer; or
1> if the MAC PDU was obtained from the MSGA buffer; or
1> if there is no measurement gap at the time of the transmission and, in case
of retransmission, the retransmission does not collide with a transmission for
a MAC PDU obtained from the Msg3 buffer or the MSGA buffer:
2> if there are neither transmission of NR sidelink communication nor
transmission of V2X sidelink communication at the time of the transmission; or
2> if the transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over sidelink
transmission or can be simultaneously performed with sidelink transmission:
3> instruct the physical layer to generate a transmission according to the
stored uplink grant.
If a HARQ process receives downlink feedback information, the HARQ process
shall:
1> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ , if running;
1> if acknowledgement is indicated:
2> stop the _configuredGrantTimer_ , if running.
If the _configuredGrantTimer_ expires for a HARQ process, the HARQ process
shall:
1> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ , if running.
The transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over sidelink transmission or
can be performed simultaneously with sidelink transmission if one of the
following conditions is met:
\- if there are both a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink
communication and configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink
communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22]
at the time of the transmission, and neither the transmission of NR sidelink
communication is prioritized as determined in clause 5.22.1.3.1a nor the
transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication is prioritized as determined in
clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22]; or
\- if there are both a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink
communication and configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink
communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22]
at the time of the transmission, and the MAC entity is able to perform this UL
transmission simultaneously with the transmission of NR sidelink communication
and/or the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication; or
\- if there is only configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink
communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22]
at the time of the transmission, and either none of the transmission(s) of V2X
sidelink communication is prioritized as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS
36.321 [22] or the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission
simultaneously with the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication; or
\- if there is only a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink
communication at the time of the transmission, and if the transmission of NR
sidelink communication is not prioritized as determined in clause 5.22.1.3.1a,
or there is a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink communication at
the time of the transmission and the MAC entity is able to perform this UL
transmission simultaneously with the transmission of NR sidelink
communication; or
\- if there are both a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink
communication and configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink
communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22]
at the time of the transmission, and either only the transmission of NR
sidelink communication is prioritized as determined in clause 5.22.1.3.1a or
only the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication is prioritized as
determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] and the MAC entity is able
to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the prioritized
transmission of NR sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication:
NOTE 1: Among the UL transmissions where the MAC entity is able to perform the
transmission of NR sidelink communication prioritized simultaneously, if there
are more than one UL transmission which the MAC entity is not able to perform
simultaneously, it is up to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is
performed.
NOTE 2: Among the UL transmissions that the MAC entity is able to perform
simultaneously with all transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication
prioritized, if there are more than one UL transmission which the MAC entity
is not able to perform simultaneously, it is up to UE implementation whether
this UL transmission is performed.
NOTE 3: Among the UL transmissions where the MAC entity is able to perform the
transmission of NR sidelink communication prioritized simultaneously with all
transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication prioritized, if there are more
than one UL transmission which the MAC entity is not able to perform
simultaneously, it is up to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is
performed.
NOTE 4: If there is configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink
communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22]
at the time of the transmission, and the MAC entity is not able to perform
this UL transmission simultaneously with the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink
communication, and prioritization-related information is not available prior
to the time of the transmission due to processing time restriction, it is up
to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is performed.
### 5.4.3 Multiplexing and assembly
#### 5.4.3.1 Logical Channel Prioritization
##### 5.4.3.1.1 General
The Logical Channel Prioritization (LCP) procedure is applied whenever a new
transmission is performed.
RRC controls the scheduling of uplink data by signalling for each logical
channel per MAC entity:
\- _priority_ where an increasing priority value indicates a lower priority
level;
\- _prioritisedBitRate_ which sets the Prioritized Bit Rate (PBR);
\- _bucketSizeDuration_ which sets the Bucket Size Duration (BSD).
RRC additionally controls the LCP procedure by configuring mapping
restrictions for each logical channel:
\- _allowedSCS-List_ which sets the allowed Subcarrier Spacing(s) for
transmission;
\- _maxPUSCH-Duration_ which sets the maximum PUSCH duration allowed for
transmission;
\- _configuredGrantType1Allowed_ which sets whether a configured grant Type 1
can be used for transmission;
\- _allowedServingCells_ which sets the allowed cell(s) for transmission;
\- _allowedCG-List_ which sets the allowed configured grant(s) for
transmission;
\- _allowedPHY-PriorityIndex_ which sets the allowed PHY priority index(es) of
a dynamic grant for transmission.
The following UE variable is used for the Logical channel prioritization
procedure:
\- _Bj_ which is maintained for each logical channel _j_.
The MAC entity shall initialize _Bj_ of the logical channel to zero when the
logical channel is established.
For each logical channel _j_ , the MAC entity shall:
1> increment _Bj_ by the product PBR Ã— T before every instance of the LCP
procedure, where T is the time elapsed since _Bj_ was last incremented;
1> if the value of _Bj_ is greater than the bucket size (i.e. PBR Ã— BSD):
2> set _Bj_ to the bucket size.
NOTE: The exact moment(s) when the UE updates _Bj_ between LCP procedures is
up to UE implementation, as long as _Bj_ is up to date at the time when a
grant is processed by LCP.
##### 5.4.3.1.2 Selection of logical channels
The MAC entity shall, when a new transmission is performed:
1> select the logical channels for each UL grant that satisfy all the
following conditions:
2> the set of allowed Subcarrier Spacing index values in _allowedSCS-List_ ,
if configured, includes the Subcarrier Spacing index associated to the UL
grant; and
2> _maxPUSCH-Duration_ , if configured, is larger than or equal to the PUSCH
transmission duration associated to the UL grant; and
2> _configuredGrantType1Allowed_ , if configured, is set to _true_ in case the
UL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and
2> _allowedServingCells_ , if configured, includes the Cell information
associated to the UL grant. Does not apply to logical channels associated with
a DRB configured with PDCP duplication within the same MAC entity (i.e. CA
duplication) when CA duplication is deactivated for this DRB in this MAC
entity; and
2> _allowedCG-List_ , if configured, includes the configured grant index
associated to the UL grant; and
2> _allowedPHY-PriorityIndex_ , if configured, includes the priority index (as
specified in clause 9 of TS 38.213 [6]) associated to the dynamic UL grant.
NOTE: The Subcarrier Spacing index, PUSCH transmission duration, Cell
information, and priority index are included in Uplink transmission
information received from lower layers for the corresponding scheduled uplink
transmission.
##### 5.4.3.1.3 Allocation of resources
Before the successful completion of the Random Access procedure initiated for
DAPS handover, the target MAC entity shall not select the logical channel(s)
corresponding to non-DAPS DRB(s) for the uplink grant received in a Random
Access Response or the uplink grant for the transmission of the MSGA payload.
The source MAC entity shall select only the logical channel(s) corresponding
to DAPS DRB(s) during DAPS handover.
The MAC entity shall, when a new transmission is performed:
1> allocate resources to the logical channels as follows:
2> logical channels selected in clause 5.4.3.1.2 for the UL grant with _Bj_ >
0 are allocated resources in a decreasing priority order. If the PBR of a
logical channel is set to _infinity_ , the MAC entity shall allocate resources
for all the data that is available for transmission on the logical channel
before meeting the PBR of the lower priority logical channel(s);
2> decrement _Bj_ by the total size of MAC SDUs served to logical channel _j_
above;
2> if any resources remain, all the logical channels selected in clause
5.4.3.1.2 are served in a strict decreasing priority order (regardless of the
value of _Bj_) until either the data for that logical channel or the UL grant
is exhausted, whichever comes first. Logical channels configured with equal
priority should be served equally.
NOTE 1: The value of _Bj_ can be negative.
If the MAC entity is requested to simultaneously transmit multiple MAC PDUs,
or if the MAC entity receives the multiple UL grants within one or more
coinciding PDCCH occasions (i.e. on different Serving Cells), it is up to UE
implementation in which order the grants are processed.
The UE shall also follow the rules below during the scheduling procedures
above:
\- the UE should not segment an RLC SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or
retransmitted RLC PDU) if the whole SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or
retransmitted RLC PDU) fits into the remaining resources of the associated MAC
entity;
\- if the UE segments an RLC SDU from the logical channel, it shall maximize
the size of the segment to fill the grant of the associated MAC entity as much
as possible;
\- the UE should maximise the transmission of data;
\- if the MAC entity is given a UL grant size that is equal to or larger than
8 bytes (when eLCID is not used) or 10 bytes (when eLCID is used) while having
data available and allowed (according to clause 5.4.3.1) for transmission, the
MAC entity shall not transmit only padding BSR and/or padding.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the MAC entity is configured with _enhancedSkipUplinkTxDynamic_ with
value _true_ and the grant indicated to the HARQ entity was addressed to a
C-RNTI, or if the MAC entity is configured with
_enhancedSkipUplinkTxConfigured_ with value _true_ and the grant indicated to
the HARQ entity is a configured uplink grant:
2> if there is no UCI to be multiplexed on this PUSCH transmission as
specified in TS 38.213 [6]; and
2> if there is no aperiodic CSI requested for this PUSCH transmission as
specified in TS 38.212 [9]; and
2> if the MAC PDU includes zero MAC SDUs; and
2> if the MAC PDU includes only the periodic BSR and there is no data
available for any LCG, or the MAC PDU includes only the padding BSR:
3> not generate a MAC PDU for the HARQ entity.
1> else if the MAC entity is configured with _skipUplinkTxDynamic_ with value
_true_ and the grant indicated to the HARQ entity was addressed to a C-RNTI,
or the grant indicated to the HARQ entity is a configured uplink grant:
2> if there is no aperiodic CSI requested for this PUSCH transmission as
specified in TS 38.212 [9]; and
2> if the MAC PDU includes zero MAC SDUs; and
2> if the MAC PDU includes only the periodic BSR and there is no data
available for any LCG, or the MAC PDU includes only the padding BSR:
3> not generate a MAC PDU for the HARQ entity.
Logical channels shall be prioritised in accordance with the following order
(highest priority listed first):
\- C-RNTI MAC CE or data from UL-CCCH;
\- Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE or MAC CEs for BFR or Multiple Entry
Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE;
\- Sidelink Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE;
\- LBT failure MAC CE;
\- MAC CE for SL-BSR prioritized according to clause 5.22.1.6;
\- MAC CE for BSR, with exception of BSR included for padding;
\- Single Entry PHR MAC CE or Multiple Entry PHR MAC CE;
\- MAC CE for the number of Desired Guard Symbols;
\- MAC CE for Pre-emptive BSR;
\- MAC CE for SL-BSR, with exception of SL-BSR prioritized according to clause
5.22.1.6 and SL-BSR included for padding;
\- data from any Logical Channel, except data from UL-CCCH;
\- MAC CE for Recommended bit rate query;
\- MAC CE for BSR included for padding;
\- MAC CE for SL-BSR included for padding.
NOTE 2: Prioritization among Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE, Multiple
Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE, and MAC CEs for BFR is up to UE
implementation.
The MAC entity shall prioritize any MAC CE listed in a higher order than
\'data from any Logical Channel, except data from UL-CCCH\' over transmission
of NR sidelink communication.
#### 5.4.3.2 Multiplexing of MAC Control Elements and MAC SDUs
The MAC entity shall multiplex MAC CEs and MAC SDUs in a MAC PDU according to
clauses 5.4.3.1 and 6.1.2.
NOTE: Content of a MAC PDU does not change after being built for transmission
on a dynamic uplink grant, regardless of LBT outcome.
### 5.4.4 Scheduling Request
The Scheduling Request (SR) is used for requesting UL-SCH resources for new
transmission.
The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An
SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different
BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see
clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at
most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP.
Each SR configuration corresponds to one or more logical channels and/or to
SCell beam failure recovery and/or to consistent LBT failure recovery. Each
logical channel, SCell beam failure recovery, and consistent LBT failure
recovery, may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured
by RRC. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered a BSR
(clause 5.4.5) or the SCell beam failure recovery or the consistent LBT
failure recovery (clause 5.21) (if such a configuration exists) is considered
as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR. Any SR configuration
may be used for an SR triggered by Pre-emptive BSR (clause 5.4.7).
RRC configures the following parameters for the scheduling request procedure:
\- _sr-ProhibitTimer_ (per SR configuration);
\- _sr-TransMax_ (per SR configuration).
The following UE variables are used for the scheduling request procedure:
\- _SR_COUNTER_ (per SR configuration).
If an SR is triggered and there are no other SRs pending corresponding to the
same SR configuration, the MAC entity shall set the _SR_COUNTER_ of the
corresponding SR configuration to 0.
When an SR is triggered, it shall be considered as pending until it is
cancelled.
All pending SR(s) for BSR triggered according to the BSR procedure (clause
5.4.5) prior to the MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled and each respective
_sr-ProhibitTimer_ shall be stopped when the MAC PDU is transmitted and this
PDU includes a Long or Short BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to
(and including) the last event that triggered a BSR (see clause 5.4.5) prior
to the MAC PDU assembly. All pending SR(s) for BSR triggered according to the
BSR procedure (clause 5.4.5) shall be cancelled and each respective _sr-
ProhibitTimer_ shall be stopped when the UL grant(s) can accommodate all
pending data available for transmission.
The MAC entity shall for each pending SR not triggered according to the BSR
procedure (clause 5.4.5) for a Serving Cell:
1> if this SR was triggered by Pre-emptive BSR procedure (see clause 5.4.7)
prior to the MAC PDU assembly and a MAC PDU containing the relevant Pre-
emptive BSR MAC CE is transmitted; or
1> if this SR was triggered by beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) of an
SCell and a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a BFR MAC CE or a
Truncated BFR MAC CE which contains beam failure recovery information for this
SCell; or
1> if this SR was triggered by beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) of an
SCell and this SCell is deactivated (see clause 5.9); or
1> if this SR was triggered by consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause
5.21) of an SCell and a MAC PDU is transmitted and the MAC PDU includes an LBT
failure MAC CE that indicates consistent LBT failure for this SCell; or
1> if this SR was triggered by consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause
5.21) of an SCell and all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) for this
SCell are cancelled:
2> cancel the pending SR and stop the corresponding _sr-ProhibitTimer, if
running_.
Only PUCCH resources on a BWP which is active at the time of SR transmission
occasion are considered valid.
As long as at least one SR is pending, the MAC entity shall for each pending
SR:
1> if the MAC entity has no valid PUCCH resource configured for the pending
SR:
2> initiate a Random Access procedure (see clause 5.1) on the SpCell and
cancel the pending SR.
1> else, for the SR configuration corresponding to the pending SR:
2> when the MAC entity has an SR transmission occasion on the valid PUCCH
resource for SR configured; and
2> if _sr-ProhibitTimer_ is not running at the time of the SR transmission
occasion; and
2> if the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion does not overlap
with a measurement gap:
3> if the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion overlaps with
neither a UL-SCH resource nor an SL-SCH resource; or
3> if the MAC entity is able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously
with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource; or
3> if the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , and the
PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion does not overlap with the
PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or with
the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or with
the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload, and the PUCCH resource for the SR
transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause
5.4.5 overlaps with any other UL-SCH resource(s), and the physical layer can
signal the SR on one valid PUCCH resource for SR, and the priority of the
logical channel that triggered SR is higher than the priority of the uplink
grant(s) for any UL-SCH resource(s) where the uplink grant was not already de-
prioritized, and the priority of the uplink grant is determined as specified
in clause 5.4.1; or
3> if both _sl-PrioritizationThres_ and _ul-PrioritizationThres_ are
configured and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the
pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 overlaps with any UL-SCH
resource(s) carrying a MAC PDU, and the value of the priority of the triggered
SR determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 is lower than _sl-
PrioritizationThres_ and the value of the highest priority of the logical
channel(s) in the MAC PDU is higher than or equal to _ul-PrioritizationThres_
and any MAC CE prioritized as described in clause 5.4.3.1.3 is not included in
the MAC PDU and the MAC PDU is not prioritized by upper layer according to TS
23.287 [19]; or
3> if an SL-SCH resource overlaps with the PUCCH resource for the SR
transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause
5.4.5, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this SR transmission
simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource, and either
transmission on the SL-SCH resource is not prioritized as described in clause
5.22.1.3.1a or the priority value of the logical channel that triggered SR is
lower than _ul-PrioritizationThres_ , if configured; or
3> if an SL-SCH resource overlaps with the PUCCH resource for the SR
transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause
5.22.1.5, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this SR transmission
simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource, and the priority
of the triggered SR determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 is higher than
the priority of the MAC PDU determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a for
the SL-SCH resource:
4> consider the SR transmission as a prioritized SR transmission.
4> consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized
uplink grant(s);
4> if the de-prioritized uplink grant(s) is a configured uplink grant
configured with _autonomousTx_ whose PUSCH has already started:
5> stop the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of the
de-prioritized uplink grant(s).
4> if _SR_COUNTER_ \ instruct the physical layer to signal the SR on one valid PUCCH resource
for SR;
5> if LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers:
6> increment _SR_COUNTER_ by 1;
6> start the _sr-ProhibitTimer_.
5> else if _lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig_ is not configured:
6> increment _SR_COUNTER_ by 1.
4> else:
5> notify RRC to release PUCCH for all Serving Cells;
5> notify RRC to release SRS for all Serving Cells;
5> clear any configured downlink assignments and uplink grants;
5> clear any PUSCH resources for semi-persistent CSI reporting;
5> initiate a Random Access procedure (see clause 5.1) on the SpCell and
cancel all pending SRs.
3> else:
4> consider the SR transmission as a de-prioritized SR transmission.
NOTE 1: Except for SR for SCell beam failure recovery, the selection of which
valid PUCCH resource for SR to signal SR on when the MAC entity has more than
one overlapping valid PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion is left
to UE implementation.
NOTE 2: If more than one individual SR triggers an instruction from the MAC
entity to the PHY layer to signal the SR on the same valid PUCCH resource, the
_SR_COUNTER_ for the relevant SR configuration is incremented only once.
NOTE 3: When the MAC entity has pending SR for SCell beam failure recovery and
the MAC entity has one or more PUCCH resources overlapping with PUCCH resource
for SCell beam failure recovery for the SR transmission occasion, the MAC
entity considers only the PUCCH resource for SCell beam failure recovery as
valid.
NOTE 4: For a UE operating in a semi-static channel access mode as described
in TS 37.213 [18], PUCCH resources overlapping with the set of consecutive
symbols where the UE does not transmit before the start of a next channel
occupancy time are not considered valid.
NOTE 5: If the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization,_ the
MAC entity does not take UCI multiplexing according to the procedure specified
in TS 38.213 [6] into account when determining whether the valid PUCCH
resource for the SR transmission can be signalled by the physical layer and
the SR transmission occasion overlaps with the PUSCH duration of an uplink
grant of a MSGA payload.
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for BSR, which was initiated by the MAC entity prior to the MAC PDU
assembly and which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
\- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by
Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes a BSR MAC CE
which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that
triggered a BSR (see clause 5.4.5) prior to the MAC PDU assembly; or
\- the UL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for
transmission.
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for SL-BSR and/or SL-CSI reporting, which was initiated by the MAC
entity prior to the sidelink MAC PDU assembly and which has no valid PUCCH
resources configured, if:
\- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by
Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes an SL-BSR MAC
CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that
triggered an SL-BSR (see clause 5.22.1.6) prior to the MAC PDU assembly; or
\- the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available and/or SL-CSI
reporting MAC CE for transmission.
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for BFR of an SCell, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured,
if:
\- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by
Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU contains a BFR MAC CE
or a Truncated BFR MAC CE which includes beam failure recovery information of
that SCell; or
\- the SCell is deactivated (as specified in clause 5.9) and all triggered
BFRs for SCells are cancelled.
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for consistent LBT failure recovery, which has no valid PUCCH
resources configured, if:
\- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by
Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes an LBT failure
MAC CE that indicates consistent LBT failure for all the SCells that triggered
consistent LBT failure; or
\- all the SCells that triggered consistent LBT failure recovery are
deactivated (see clause 5.9).
### 5.4.5 Buffer Status Reporting
The Buffer Status reporting (BSR) procedure is used to provide the serving gNB
with information about UL data volume in the MAC entity.
RRC configures the following parameters to control the BSR:
\- _periodicBSR-Timer_ ;
\- _retxBSR-Timer_ ;
\- _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied_ ;
\- _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_ ;
\- _logicalChannelSR-Mask_ ;
\- _logicalChannelGroup_.
Each logical channel may be allocated to an LCG using the
_logicalChannelGroup_. The maximum number of LCGs is eight.
The MAC entity determines the amount of UL data available for a logical
channel according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [3]
and 38.323 [4].
A BSR shall be triggered if any of the following events occur:
\- UL data, for a logical channel which belongs to an LCG, becomes available
to the MAC entity; and either
\- this UL data belongs to a logical channel with higher priority than the
priority of any logical channel containing available UL data which belong to
any LCG; or
\- none of the logical channels which belong to an LCG contains any available
UL data.
in which case the BSR is referred below to as \'Regular BSR\';
\- UL resources are allocated and number of padding bits is equal to or larger
than the size of the Buffer Status Report MAC CE plus its subheader, in which
case the BSR is referred below to as \'Padding BSR\';
\- _retxBSR-Timer_ expires, and at least one of the logical channels which
belong to an LCG contains UL data, in which case the BSR is referred below to
as \'Regular BSR\';
\- _periodicBSR-Timer_ expires, in which case the BSR is referred below to as
\'Periodic BSR\'.
NOTE 1: When Regular BSR triggering events occur for multiple logical channels
simultaneously, each logical channel triggers one separate Regular BSR.
For Regular BSR, the MAC entity shall:
1> if the BSR is triggered for a logical channel for which _logicalChannelSR-
DelayTimerApplied_ with value _true_ is configured by upper layers:
2> start or restart the _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_.
1> else:
2> if running, stop the _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_.
For Regular and Periodic BSR, the MAC entity shall:
1> if more than one LCG has data available for transmission when the MAC PDU
containing the BSR is to be built:
2> report Long BSR for all LCGs which have data available for transmission.
1> else:
2> report Short BSR.
For Padding BSR, the MAC entity shall:
1> if the number of padding bits is equal to or larger than the size of the
Short BSR plus its subheader but smaller than the size of the Long BSR plus
its subheader:
2> if more than one LCG has data available for transmission when the BSR is to
be built:
3> if the number of padding bits is equal to the size of the Short BSR plus
its subheader:
4> report Short Truncated BSR of the LCG with the highest priority logical
channel with data available for transmission.
3> else:
4> report Long Truncated BSR of the LCG(s) with the logical channels having
data available for transmission following a decreasing order of the highest
priority logical channel (with or without data available for transmission) in
each of these LCG(s), and in case of equal priority, in increasing order of
LCGID.
2> else:
3> report Short BSR.
1> else if the number of padding bits is equal to or larger than the size of
the Long BSR plus its subheader:
2> report Long BSR for all LCGs which have data available for transmission.
For BSR triggered by _retxBSR-Timer_ expiry, the MAC entity considers that the
logical channel that triggered the BSR is the highest priority logical channel
that has data available for transmission at the time the BSR is triggered.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least one BSR
has been triggered and not cancelled:
2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH
resources can accommodate the BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of
logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the BSR MAC
CE(s) as defined in clause 6.1.3.1;
3> start or restart _periodicBSR-Timer_ except when all the generated BSRs are
long or short Truncated BSRs;
3> start or restart _retxBSR-Timer_.
2> if a Regular BSR has been triggered and _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_ is
not running:
3> if there is no UL-SCH resource available for a new transmission; or
3> if the MAC entity is configured with configured uplink grant(s) and the
Regular BSR was triggered for a logical channel for which _logicalChannelSR-
Mask_ is set to _false_ ; or
3> if the UL-SCH resources available for a new transmission do not meet the
LCP mapping restrictions (see clause 5.4.3.1) configured for the logical
channel that triggered the BSR:
4> trigger a Scheduling Request.
NOTE 2: UL-SCH resources are considered available if the MAC entity has been
configured with, receives, or determines an uplink grant. If the MAC entity
has determined at a given point in time that UL-SCH resources are available,
this need not imply that UL-SCH resources are available for use at that point
in time.
A MAC PDU shall contain at most one BSR MAC CE, even when multiple events have
triggered a BSR. The Regular BSR and the Periodic BSR shall have precedence
over the padding BSR.
The MAC entity shall restart _retxBSR-Timer_ upon reception of a grant for
transmission of new data on any UL-SCH.
All triggered BSRs may be cancelled when the UL grant(s) can accommodate all
pending data available for transmission but is not sufficient to additionally
accommodate the BSR MAC CE plus its subheader. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC
PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU
includes a Long or Short BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and
including) the last event that triggered a BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly.
NOTE 3: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant
reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. BSR and SR can
be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains a BSR MAC CE, but
before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, BSR and SR can be
triggered during MAC PDU assembly.
NOTE 4: Void
NOTE 5: If a HARQ process is configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ and if
the BSR is already included in a MAC PDU for transmission on configured grant
by this HARQ process, but not yet transmitted by lower layers, it is up to UE
implementation how to handle the BSR content.
### 5.4.6 Power Headroom Reporting
The Power Headroom reporting procedure is used to provide the serving gNB with
the following information:
\- Type 1 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum
transmit power and the estimated power for UL-SCH transmission per activated
Serving Cell;
\- Type 2 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum
transmit power and the estimated power for UL-SCH and PUCCH transmission on
SpCell of the other MAC entity (i.e. E-UTRA MAC entity in EN-DC, NE-DC, and
NGEN-DC cases);
\- Type 3 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum
transmit power and the estimated power for SRS transmission per activated
Serving Cell;
\- MPE P-MPR: the power backoff to meet the MPE FR2 requirements for a Serving
Cell operating on FR2.
RRC controls Power Headroom reporting by configuring the following parameters:
\- _phr-PeriodicTimer_ ;
\- _phr-ProhibitTimer_ ;
\- _phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange_ ;
\- _phr-Type2OtherCell_ ;
\- _phr-ModeOtherCG_ ;
\- _multiplePHR_ ;
\- _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ ;
\- _mpe-ProhibitTimer_ ;
\- _mpe-Threshold_.
A Power Headroom Report (PHR) shall be triggered if any of the following
events occur:
\- _phr-ProhibitTimer_ expires or has expired and the path loss has changed
more than _phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange_ dB for at least one activated Serving
Cell of any MAC entity of which the active DL BWP is not dormant BWP which is
used as a pathloss reference since the last transmission of a PHR in this MAC
entity when the MAC entity has UL resources for new transmission;
NOTE 1: The path loss variation for one cell assessed above is between the
pathloss measured at present time on the current pathloss reference and the
pathloss measured at the transmission time of the last transmission of PHR on
the pathloss reference in use at that time, irrespective of whether the
pathloss reference has changed in between. The current pathloss reference for
this purpose does not include any pathloss reference configured using
pathlossReferenceRS-Pos in TS 38.331 [5].
\- _phr-PeriodicTimer_ expires;
\- upon configuration or reconfiguration of the power headroom reporting
functionality by upper layers, which is not used to disable the function;
\- activation of an SCell of any MAC entity with configured uplink of which
_firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ is not set to dormant BWP;
\- addition of the PSCell (i.e. PSCell is newly added or changed);
\- _phr-ProhibitTimer_ expires or has expired, when the MAC entity has UL
resources for new transmission, and the following is true for any of the
activated Serving Cells of any MAC entity with configured uplink:
\- there are UL resources allocated for transmission or there is a PUCCH
transmission on this cell, and the required power backoff due to power
management (as allowed by P-MPR~c~ as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS
38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16]) for this cell has changed more than _phr-
Tx-PowerFactorChange_ dB since the last transmission of a PHR when the MAC
entity had UL resources allocated for transmission or PUCCH transmission on
this cell.
\- Upon switching of activated BWP from dormant BWP to non-dormant DL BWP of
an SCell of any MAC entity with configured uplink;
\- if _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is configured, and _mpe-ProhibitTimer_ is not
running:
\- the measured P-MPR applied to meet FR2 MPE requirements as specified in TS
38.101-2 [15] is equal to or larger than _mpe-Threshold_ for at least one
activated FR2 Serving Cell since the last transmission of a PHR in this MAC
entity; or
\- the measured P-MPR applied to meet FR2 MPE requirements as specified in TS
38.101-2 [15] has changed more than _phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange_ dB for at least
one activated FR2 Serving Cell since the last transmission of a PHR due to the
measured P-MPR applied to meet MPE requirements being equal to or larger than
_mpe-Threshold_ in this MAC entity.
in which case the PHR is referred below to as \'MPE P-MPR report\'.
NOTE 2: The MAC entity should avoid triggering a PHR when the required power
backoff due to power management decreases only temporarily (e.g. for up to a
few tens of milliseconds) and it should avoid reflecting such temporary
decrease in the values of P~CMAX,f,c~/PH when a PHR is triggered by other
triggering conditions.
NOTE 3: If a HARQ process is configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ and if
the PHR is already included in a MAC PDU for transmission on configured grant
by this HARQ process, but not yet transmitted by lower layers, it is up to UE
implementation how to handle the PHR content.
If the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for a new transmission the MAC
entity shall:
1> if it is the first UL resource allocated for a new transmission since the
last MAC reset:
2> start _phr-PeriodicTimer_.
1> if the Power Headroom reporting procedure determines that at least one PHR
has been triggered and not cancelled; and
1> if the allocated UL resources can accommodate the MAC CE for PHR which the
MAC entity is configured to transmit, plus its subheader, as a result of LCP
as defined in clause 5.4.3.1:
2> if _multiplePHR_ with value _true_ is configured:
3> for each activated Serving Cell with configured uplink associated with any
MAC entity of which the active DL BWP is not dormant BWP; and
3> for each activated Serving Cell with configured uplink associated with
E-UTRA MAC entity:
4> obtain the value of the Type 1 or Type 3 power headroom for the
corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] for
NR Serving Cell and clause 5.1.1.2 of TS 36.213 [17] for E-UTRA Serving Cell;
4> if this MAC entity has UL resources allocated for transmission on this
Serving Cell; or
4> if the other MAC entity, if configured, has UL resources allocated for
transmission on this Serving Cell and _phr-ModeOtherCG_ is set to _real_ by
upper layers:
5> obtain the value for the corresponding P~CMAX,f,c~ field from the physical
layer.
5> if _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is configured and this Serving Cell operates on FR2
and this Serving Cell is associated to this MAC entity:
6> obtain the value for the corresponding MPE field from the physical layer.
3> if _phr-Type2OtherCell_ with value _true_ is configured:
4> if the other MAC entity is E-UTRA MAC entity:
5> obtain the value of the Type 2 power headroom for the SpCell of the other
MAC entity (i.e. E-UTRA MAC entity);
5> if _phr-ModeOtherCG_ is set to _real_ by upper layers:
6> obtain the value for the corresponding P~CMAX,f,c~ field for the SpCell of
the other MAC entity (i.e. E-UTRA MAC entity) from the physical layer.
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate and transmit
the Multiple Entry PHR MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.9 based on the values
reported by the physical layer.
2> else (i.e. Single Entry PHR format is used):
3> obtain the value of the Type 1 power headroom from the physical layer for
the corresponding uplink carrier of the PCell;
3> obtain the value for the corresponding P~CMAX,f,c~ field from the physical
layer;
3> if _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is configured and this Serving Cell operates on FR2:
4> obtain the value for the corresponding MPE field from the physical layer.
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate and transmit
the Single Entry PHR MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.8 based on the values
reported by the physical layer.
2> if this PHR report is an MPE P-MPR report:
3> start or restart the _mpe-ProhibitTimer_ ;
3> cancel triggered MPE P-MPR reporting for Serving Cells included in the PHR
MAC CE.
2> start or restart _phr-PeriodicTimer_ ;
2> start or restart _phr-ProhibitTimer_ ;
2> cancel all triggered PHR(s).
### 5.4.7 Pre-emptive Buffer Status Reporting
The Pre-emptive Buffer Status reporting (Pre-emptive BSR) procedure is used by
an IAB-MT to provide its parent IAB-DU(s) or IAB-donor-DU(s) with the
information about the amount of the data expected to arrive at the IAB-MT from
its child node(s) and/or UE(s) connected to it.
If configured, Pre-emptive BSR may be triggered for the specific case of an
IAB-MT if any of the following events occur:
\- UL grant is provided to child IAB node or UE;
\- BSR is received from child IAB node or UE.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the Pre-emptive Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at
least one Pre-emptive BSR has been triggered and not cancelled:
2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH
resources can accommodate the Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a
result of logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the Pre-
emptive BSR MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.1.
2> else:
3> trigger a Scheduling Request.
A MAC PDU shall contain at most one Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE, even when multiple
events have triggered a Pre-emptive BSR.
All triggered Pre-emptive BSR(s) shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is
transmitted and this PDU includes the corresponding Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE.
NOTE: Pre-emptive BSR may be used for the case of dual-connected IAB node. It
is up to network implementation to work out the associated MAC entity or
entities which report the Pre-emptive BSR, and the associated expected amount
of data reported by any such entity or entities. For the case of dual-
connected IAB node, if two ingress BH RLC channels belonging to the same
ingress LCG are mapped to two different egress Cell Groups (corresponding to
different parent nodes), there may be ambiguity in Pre-emptive BSR
calculations and interpretation by the receiving parent node(s) and the IAB
node reporting pre-emptive BSR.
## 5.5 PCH reception
When the MAC entity needs to receive PCH, the MAC entity shall:
1> if a PCH assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the P-RNTI:
2> attempt to decode the TB on the PCH as indicated by the PDCCH information;
2> if the TB on the PCH has been successfully decoded:
3> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
## 5.6 BCH reception
When the MAC entity needs to receive BCH, the MAC entity shall:
1> receive and attempt to decode the BCH;
1> if a TB on the BCH has been successfully decoded:
2> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
## 5.7 Discontinuous Reception (DRX)
The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a DRX functionality that controls
the UE\'s PDCCH monitoring activity for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, CI-RNTI, CS-
RNTI, INT-RNTI, SFI-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, TPC-
SRS-RNTI, and AI-RNTI. When using DRX operation, the MAC entity shall also
monitor PDCCH according to requirements found in other clauses of this
specification. When in RRC_CONNECTED, if DRX is configured, for all the
activated Serving Cells, the MAC entity may monitor the PDCCH discontinuously
using the DRX operation specified in this clause; otherwise the MAC entity
shall monitor the PDCCH as specified in TS 38.213 [6].
NOTE 1: If Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 is configured by RRC, a DRX
functionality is not configured.
RRC controls DRX operation by configuring the following parameters:
\- _drx-onDurationTimer_ : the duration at the beginning of a DRX cycle;
\- _drx-SlotOffset_ : the delay before starting the _drx-onDurationTimer_ ;
\- _drx-InactivityTimer_ : the duration after the PDCCH occasion in which a
PDCCH indicates a new UL or DL transmission for the MAC entity;
\- _drx-RetransmissionTimerDL_ (per DL HARQ process except for the broadcast
process): the maximum duration until a DL retransmission is received;
\- _drx-RetransmissionTimerUL_ (per UL HARQ process): the maximum duration
until a grant for UL retransmission is received;
\- _drx-LongCycleStartOffset_ : the Long DRX cycle and _drx-StartOffset_ which
defines the subframe where the Long and Short DRX cycle starts;
\- _drx-ShortCycle_ (optional): the Short DRX cycle;
\- _drx-ShortCycleTimer_ (optional): the duration the UE shall follow the
Short DRX cycle;
\- _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL_ (per DL HARQ process except for the broadcast
process): the minimum duration before a DL assignment for HARQ retransmission
is expected by the MAC entity;
\- _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL_ (per UL HARQ process): the minimum duration before a
UL HARQ retransmission grant is expected by the MAC entity;
\- _ps-Wakeup_ (optional): the configuration to start associated _drx-
onDurationTimer_ in case DCP is monitored but not detected;
\- _ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI_ (optional): the configuration to report
periodic CSI that is not L1-RSRP on PUCCH during the time duration indicated
by _drx-onDurationTimer_ in case DCP is configured but associated _drx-
onDurationTimer_ is not started;
\- _ps-TransmitPeriodicL1-RSRP_ (optional): the configuration to transmit
periodic CSI that is L1-RSRP on PUCCH during the time duration indicated by
_drx-onDurationTimer_ in case DCP is configured but associated _drx-
onDurationTimer_ is not started.
Serving Cells of a MAC entity may be configured by RRC in two DRX groups with
separate DRX parameters. W _hen RRC does not configure a secondary DRX group,
there is only one DRX group_ _and all Serving Cells belong to that one DRX
group. When two DRX groups are configured, e_ ach Serving Cell is uniquely
assigned to either of the two groups. The DRX parameters that are separately
configured for each DRX group are: _drx-onDurationTimer_ , _drx-
InactivityTimer. The DRX parameters that are common to the DRX groups are:
drx-SlotOffset_ , _drx-RetransmissionTimerDL_ , _drx-RetransmissionTimerUL_ ,
_drx-LongCycleStartOffset_ , _drx-ShortCycle_ (optional), _drx-
ShortCycleTimer_ (optional), _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL_ , and _drx-HARQ-RTT-
TimerUL_.
When DRX is configured, the Active Time for Serving Cells in a DRX group
includes the time while:
\- _drx-onDurationTimer_ or _drx-InactivityTimer_ configured for the DRX group
is running; or
_\- drx-RetransmissionTimerDL_ or _drx-RetransmissionTimerUL_ is running on
any Serving Cell in the DRX group; or
\- _ra-ContentionResolutionTimer_ (as described in clause 5.1.5) or _msgB-
ResponseWindow_ (as described in clause 5.1.4a) is running; or
\- a Scheduling Request is sent on PUCCH and is pending (as described in
clause 5.4.4); or
\- a PDCCH indicating a new transmission addressed to the C-RNTI of the MAC
entity has not been received after successful reception of a Random Access
Response for the Random Access Preamble not selected by the MAC entity among
the contention-based Random Access Preamble (as described in clauses 5.1.4 and
5.1.4a).
When DRX is configured, the MAC entity shall:
1> if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment:
2> start the _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL_ for the corresponding HARQ process in the
first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL
HARQ feedback;
2> stop the _drx-RetransmissionTimerDL_ for the corresponding HARQ process.
1> if a MAC PDU is transmitted in a configured uplink grant and LBT failure
indication is not received from lower layers:
2> start the _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL_ for the corresponding HARQ process in the
first symbol after the end of the first transmission (within a bundle) of the
corresponding PUSCH transmission;
2> stop the _drx-RetransmissionTimerUL_ for the corresponding HARQ process at
the first transmission (within a bundle) of the corresponding PUSCH
transmission.
1> if a _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL_ expires:
2> if the data of the corresponding HARQ process was not successfully decoded:
3> start the _drx-RetransmissionTimerDL_ for the corresponding HARQ process in
the first symbol after the expiry of _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL_.
1> if a _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL_ expires:
2> start the _drx-RetransmissionTimerUL_ for the corresponding HARQ process in
the first symbol after the expiry of _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL_.
1> if a DRX Command MAC CE or a Long DRX Command MAC CE is received:
2> stop _drx-onDurationTimer_ _for each DRX group_ ;
2> stop _drx-InactivityTimer for each DRX group_.
1> if _drx-InactivityTimer_ for a DRX group expires:
2> if the Short DRX cycle is configured:
3> start or restart _drx-ShortCycleTimer_ for this DRX group in the first
symbol after the expiry of _drx-InactivityTimer_ ;
3> use the Short DRX cycle for this DRX group.
2> else:
3> use the Long DRX cycle for this DRX group.
1> if a DRX Command MAC CE is received:
2> if the Short DRX cycle is configured:
3> start or restart _drx-ShortCycleTimer_ for each DRX group in the first
symbol after the end of DRX Command MAC CE reception;
3> use the Short DRX cycle for each DRX group.
2> else:
3> use the Long DRX cycle for each DRX group.
1> if _drx-ShortCycleTimer_ for a DRX group expires:
2> use the Long DRX cycle for this DRX group.
1> if a Long DRX Command MAC CE is received:
2> stop _drx-ShortCycleTimer_ for each DRX group;
2> use the Long DRX cycle for each DRX group.
1> if the Short DRX cycle is used for a DRX group, and [(SFN Ã— 10) + subframe
number] modulo (_drx-ShortCycle_) = (_drx-StartOffset_) modulo (_drx-
ShortCycle_):
2> start _drx-onDurationTimer_ for this DRX group after _drx-SlotOffset_ from
the beginning of the subframe.
1> if the Long DRX cycle is used for a DRX group, and [(SFN Ã— 10) + subframe
number] modulo (_drx-LongCycle_) = _drx-StartOffset_ :
2> if DCP monitoring is configured for the active DL BWP as specified in TS
38.213 [6], clause 10.3:
3> if DCP indication associated with the current DRX cycle received from lower
layer indicated to start _drx-onDurationTimer_ , as specified in TS 38.213
[6]; or
3> if all DCP occasion(s) in time domain, as specified in TS 38.213 [6],
associated with the current DRX cycle occurred in Active Time considering
grants/assignments/DRX Command MAC CE/Long DRX Command MAC CE received and
Scheduling Request sent until 4 ms prior to start of the last DCP occasion, or
during a measurement gap, or when the MAC entity monitors for a PDCCH
transmission on the search space indicated by _recoverySearchSpaceId_ of the
SpCell identified by the C-RNTI while the _ra-ResponseWindow_ is running (as
specified in clause 5.1.4); or
3> if _ps-Wakeup_ is configured with value _true_ and DCP indication
associated with the current DRX cycle has not been received from lower layers:
4> start _drx-onDurationTimer_ after _drx-SlotOffset_ from the beginning of
the subframe.
2> else:
3> start _drx-onDurationTimer_ for this DRX group after _drx-SlotOffset_ from
the beginning of the subframe.
NOTE 2: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of
the SpCell is used to calculate the DRX duration.
1> if a DRX group is in Active Time:
2> monitor the PDCCH on the Serving Cells in this DRX group as specified in TS
38.213 [6];
2> if the PDCCH indicates a DL transmission:
3> start the _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL_ for the corresponding HARQ process in the
first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL
HARQ feedback;
NOTE 3: When HARQ feedback is postponed by PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing
indicating an inapplicable k1 value, as specified in TS 38.213 [6], the
corresponding transmission opportunity to send the DL HARQ feedback is
indicated in a later PDCCH requesting the HARQ-ACK feedback.
3> stop the _drx-RetransmissionTimerDL_ for the corresponding HARQ process.
3> if the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicate an inapplicable k1 value as
specified in TS 38.213 [6]:
4> start the _drx-RetransmissionTimerDL_ in the first symbol after the (end of
the last) PDSCH transmission (within a bundle) for the corresponding HARQ
process.
2> if the PDCCH indicates a UL transmission:
3> start the _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL_ for the corresponding HARQ process in the
first symbol after the end of the first transmission (within a bundle) of the
corresponding PUSCH transmission;
3> stop the _drx-RetransmissionTimerUL_ for the corresponding HARQ process.
2> if the PDCCH indicates a new transmission (DL or UL) on a Serving Cell in
this DRX group:
3> start or restart _drx-InactivityTimer_ for this DRX group in the first
symbol after the end of the PDCCH reception.
NOTE 3a: A PDCCH indicating activation of SPS or configured grant type 2 is
considered to indicate a new transmission.
2> if a HARQ process receives downlink feedback information and
acknowledgement is indicated:
3> stop the _drx-RetransmissionTimerUL_ for the corresponding HARQ process.
1> if DCP monitoring is configured for the active DL BWP as specified in TS
38.213 [6], clause 10.3; and

2> if the MAC entity would not be in Active Time considering
grants/assignments/DRX Command MAC CE/Long DRX Command MAC CE received and
Scheduling Request sent until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX
Active Time conditions as specified in this clause:
3> not transmit periodic SRS and semi-persistent SRS defined in TS 38.214 [7];
3> not report semi-persistent CSI configured on PUSCH;
3> if _ps-TransmitPeriodicL1-RSRP_ is not configured with value _true_ :
4> not report periodic CSI that is L1-RSRP on PUCCH.
3> if _ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI_ is not configured with value _true_ :
4> not report periodic CSI that is not L1-RSRP on PUCCH.
1> else:
2> in current symbol n, if a DRX group would not be in Active Time considering
grants/assignments scheduled on Serving Cell(s) in this DRX group and DRX
Command MAC CE/Long DRX Command MAC CE received and Scheduling Request sent
until 4 ms prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as
specified in this clause:
3> not transmit periodic SRS and semi-persistent SRS defined in TS 38.214 [7]
in this DRX group;
3> not report CSI on PUCCH and semi-persistent CSI configured on PUSCH in this
DRX group.
2> if CSI masking (_csi-Mask_) is setup by upper layers:
3> in current symbol n, if _drx-onDurationTimer_ of a DRX group would not be
running considering grants/assignments scheduled on Serving Cell(s) in this
DRX group and DRX Command MAC CE/Long DRX Command MAC CE received until 4 ms
prior to symbol n when evaluating all DRX Active Time conditions as specified
in this clause; and
4> not report CSI on PUCCH in this DRX group.
NOTE 4: If a UE multiplexes a CSI configured on PUCCH with other overlapping
UCI(s) according to the procedure specified in TS 38.213 [6] clause 9.2.5 and
this CSI multiplexed with other UCI(s) would be reported on a PUCCH resource
either outside DRX Active Time of the DRX group in which this PUCCH is
configured or outside the on-duration period of the DRX group in which this
PUCCH is configured if CSI masking is setup by upper layers, it is up to UE
implementation whether to report this CSI multiplexed with other UCI(s).
Regardless of whether the MAC entity is monitoring PDCCH or not on the Serving
Cells in a DRX group, the MAC entity transmits HARQ feedback, aperiodic CSI on
PUSCH, and aperiodic SRS defined in TS 38.214 [7] on the Serving Cells in the
DRX group when such is expected.
The MAC entity needs not to monitor the PDCCH if it is not a complete PDCCH
occasion (e.g. the Active Time starts or ends in the middle of a PDCCH
occasion).
## 5.8 Transmission and reception without dynamic scheduling
### 5.8.1 Downlink
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) is configured by RRC for a Serving Cell per
BWP. Multiple assignments can be active simultaneously in the same BWP.
Activation and deactivation of the DL SPS are independent among the Serving
Cells.
For the DL SPS, a DL assignment is provided by PDCCH, and stored or cleared
based on L1 signalling indicating SPS activation or deactivation.
RRC configures the following parameters when the SPS is configured:
\- _cs-RNTI_ : CS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;
\- _nrofHARQ-Processes_ : the number of configured HARQ processes for SPS;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset_ : Offset of HARQ process for SPS;
\- _periodicity_ : periodicity of configured downlink assignment for SPS.
When the SPS is released by upper layers, all the corresponding configurations
shall be released.
After a downlink assignment is configured for SPS, the MAC entity shall
consider sequentially that the N^th^ downlink assignment occurs in the slot
for which:
(_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— SFN + slot number in the frame) =\
[(_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— SFN~start\ time~ + slot~start\ time~) + N Ã—
_periodicity_ Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ / 10] modulo (1024 Ã—
_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_)
where SFN~start\ time~ and slot~start\ time~ are the SFN and slot,
respectively, of the first transmission of PDSCH where the configured downlink
assignment was (re-)initialised.
NOTE: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the
concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the occurrences of configured
downlink assignments.
### 5.8.2 Uplink
There are two types of transmission without dynamic grant:
\- configured grant Type 1 where an uplink grant is provided by RRC, and
stored as configured uplink grant;
\- configured grant Type 2 where an uplink grant is provided by PDCCH, and
stored or cleared as configured uplink grant based on L1 signalling indicating
configured uplink grant activation or deactivation.
Type 1 and Type 2 are configured by RRC for a Serving Cell per BWP. Multiple
configurations can be active simultaneously in the same BWP. For Type 2,
activation and deactivation are independent among the Serving Cells. For the
same BWP, the MAC entity can be configured with both Type 1 and Type 2.
RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 1 is
configured:
\- _cs-RNTI_ : CS-RNTI for retransmission;
\- _periodicity_ : periodicity of the configured grant Type 1;
\- _timeDomainOffset_ : Offset of a resource with respect to SFN =
_timeReferenceSFN_ in time domain;
\- _timeDomainAllocation_ : Allocation of configured uplink grant in time
domain which contains _startSymbolAndLength_ (i.e. _SLIV_ in TS 38.214 [7]) or
_startSymbol_ (i.e. _S_ in TS 38.214 [7]);
\- _nrofHARQ-Processes_ : the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant for
operation with shared spectrum channel access;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant;
\- _timeReferenceSFN_ : SFN used for determination of the offset of a resource
in time domain. The UE uses the closest SFN with the indicated number
preceding the reception of the configured grant configuration.
RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 2 is
configured:
\- _cs-RNTI_ : CS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;
\- _periodicity_ : periodicity of the configured grant Type 2;
\- _nrofHARQ-Processes_ : the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant for
operation with shared spectrum channel access;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant.
RRC configures the following parameter when retransmissions on configured
uplink grant is configured:
\- _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ : the duration after a configured grant
(re)transmission of a HARQ process when the UE shall not autonomously
retransmit that HARQ process.
Upon configuration of a configured grant Type 1 for a BWP of a Serving Cell by
upper layers, the MAC entity shall:
1> store the uplink grant provided by upper layers as a configured uplink
grant for the indicated BWP of the Serving Cell;
1> initialise or re-initialise the configured uplink grant to start in the
symbol according to _timeDomainOffset_ , _timeReferenceSFN_ , and _S_ (derived
from _SLIV_ or provided by _startSymbol_ as specified in TS 38.214 [7]), and
to reoccur with _periodicity_.
After an uplink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 1, the MAC
entity shall consider sequentially that the N^th^ (N >= 0) uplink grant occurs
in the symbol for which:
[(SFN Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_) + (slot number in
the frame Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_) + symbol number in the slot] =\
(_timeReferenceSFN_ Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \+
_timeDomainOffset_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \+ S + N Ã— _periodicity_) modulo
(1024 Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_).
After an uplink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 2, the MAC
entity shall consider sequentially that the N^th^ (N >= 0) uplink grant occurs
in the symbol for which:
[(SFN Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_) + (slot number in
the frame Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_) + symbol number in the slot] =\
[(SFN~start\ time~ Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \+
slot~start\ time~ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \+ symbol~start\ time~) + N Ã—
_periodicity_] modulo (1024 Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã—
_numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_).
where SFN~start\ time~, slot~start\ time~, and symbol~start\ time~ are the
SFN, slot, and symbol, respectively, of the first transmission opportunity of
PUSCH where the configured uplink grant was (re-)initialised.
If _cg-nrofPUSCH-InSlot_ or _cg-nrofSlots_ is configured for a configured
grant Type 1 or Type 2, the MAC entity shall consider the uplink grants occur
in those additional PUSCH allocations as specified in clause 6.1.2.3 of TS
38.214 [7].
NOTE: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the
concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the occurrences of configured
uplink grants.
When the configured uplink grant is released by upper layers, all the
corresponding configurations shall be released and all corresponding uplink
grants shall be cleared.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if at least one configured uplink grant confirmation has been triggered and
not cancelled; and
1> if the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for new transmission:
2> if, in this MAC entity, at least one configured uplink grant is configured
by _configuredGrantConfigToAddModList_ :
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Multiple
Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.31.
2> else:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Configured
Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.7.
2> cancel all triggered configured uplink grant confirmation(s).
For a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall clear the configured
uplink grant(s) immediately after first transmission of Configured Grant
Confirmation MAC CE or Multiple Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE
which confirms the configured uplink grant deactivation.
Retransmissions use:
\- repetition of configured uplink grants; or
\- received uplink grants addressed to CS-RNTI; or
\- configured uplink grants with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ configured.
### 5.8.3 Sidelink
There are two types of transmission without dynamic sidelink grant:
\- configured grant Type 1 where an sidelink grant is provided by RRC, and
stored as configured sidelink grant;
\- configured grant Type 2 where an sidelink grant is provided by PDCCH, and
stored or cleared as configured sidelink grant based on L1 signalling
indicating configured sidelink grant activation or deactivation.
Type 1 and/or Type 2 are configured with a single BWP. Multiple configurations
of up to 8 configured grants (including both Type 1 and Type 2, if configured)
can be active simultaneously on the BWP.
RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 1 is
configured, as specified in TS 38.331 [5] or TS 36.331 [21]:
\- _sl-ConfigIndexCG_ : the identifier of a configured grant for sidelink;
\- _sl-CS-RNTI_ : SL-CS-RNTI for retransmission;
\- _sl-NrOfHARQ-Processes_ : the number of HARQ processes for configured
grant;
\- _sl-PeriodCG_ : periodicity of the configured grant Type 1;
\- _sl-TimeOffsetCG-Type1_ : Offset of a resource with respect to reference
logical slot defined by _sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Type1_ in time domain, referring
to the number of logical slots in a resource pool;
\- _sl-TimeResourceCG-Type1_ : time resource location of the configured grant
Type 1;
\- _sl-CG-MaxTransNumList_ : the maximum number of times that a TB can be
transmitted using the configured grant;
_\- sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant Type
1;
\- _sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Type1_ : SFN used for determination of the offset of a
resource in time domain. If it is present, the UE uses the first logical slot
of associated resource pool after the starting time of the closest SFN with
the indicated number preceding the reception of the sidelink configured grant
configuration Type 1 as reference logical slot. If it is absent, the indicated
reference SFN is zero.
RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 2 is
configured, as specified in TS 38.331 [5]:
\- _sl-ConfigIndexCG_ : the identifier of a configured grant for sidelink;
\- _sl-CS-RNTI_ : SL-CS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;
\- _sl-NrOfHARQ-Processes_ : the number of HARQ processes for configured
grant;
\- _sl-PeriodCG_ : periodicity of the configured grant Type 2;
\- _sl-CG-MaxTransNumList_ : the maximum number of times that a TB can be
transmitted using the configured grant;
_\- sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant Type
2.
Upon configuration of a configured grant Type 1, the MAC entity shall for each
configured sidelink grant:
1> store the sidelink grant provided by RRC as a configured sidelink grant;
1> initialise or re-initialise the configured sidelink grant to determine
PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) according to _sl-TimeOffsetCG-Type1_
and _sl-TimeResourceCG-Type1_ , and to reoccur with _sl-periodCG_ for
transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs according to clause 8.1.2 of TS 38.214 [7].
NOTE 1: If the MAC entity is configured with multiple configured sidelink
grants, collision among the configured sidelink grants may occur. How to
handle the collision is left to UE implementation.
After a sidelink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 1, the MAC
entity shall consider sequentially that the first slot of the S^th^ sidelink
grant occurs in the logical slot for which:
_CURRENT_slot_ = (_sl-ReferenceSlotCG-Type1_ \+ _sl-TimeOffsetCG-Type1 +_ S Ã—
_PeriodicitySL)_ modulo _T\'~max~_
where CURRENT_slot refers to current logical slot in the associated resource
pool,$\ PeriodicitySL = \left\lceil \frac{{T'}_{\max}\ }{10240\ ms} \times
sl\text{-}P\text{eriodCG} \right\rceil$ and T\'~max~ is the number of slots
that belongs to the associated resource pool as defined in clause 8 of TS
38.214[7]. _sl-ReferenceSlotCG-Type1_ refers to reference logical slot defined
by _sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Type1_.
After a sidelink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 2, the MAC
entity shall consider sequentially that the first slot of S^th^ sidelink grant
occurs in the logical slot for which:
_CURRENT_slot = (sl-StartSlotCG-Type2 +_ S Ã— _PeriodicitySL)_ modulo
_T\'~max~_
where _sl-StartSlotCG-Type2_ refers to the logical slot of the first
transmission opportunity of PSSCH where the configured sidelink grant was
(re)initialised.
When a configured sidelink grant is released by RRC, all the corresponding
configurations shall be released and all corresponding sidelink grants shall
be cleared.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the configured sidelink grant confirmation has been triggered and not
cancelled; and
1> if the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for new transmission:
2> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Sidelink
Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.34;
2> cancel the triggered configured sidelink grant confirmation.
For a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall clear the corresponding
configured sidelink grant immediately after first transmission of Sidelink
Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE triggered by the configured sidelink
grant deactivation.
## 5.9 Activation/Deactivation of SCells
If the MAC entity is configured with one or more SCells, the network may
activate and deactivate the configured SCells. Upon configuration of an SCell,
the SCell is deactivated unless the parameter _sCellState_ is set to
_activated_ for the SCell by upper layers.
The configured SCell(s) is activated and deactivated by:
\- receiving the SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause
6.1.3.10;
\- configuring _sCellDeactivationTimer_ timer per configured SCell (except the
SCell configured with PUCCH, if any): the associated SCell is deactivated upon
its expiry;
\- configuring _sCellState_ per configured SCell: if configured, the
associated SCell is activated upon SCell configuration.
The MAC entity shall for each configured SCell:
1> if an SCell is configured with _sCellState_ set to _activated_ upon SCell
configuration, or an SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received
activating the SCell:
2> if the SCell was deactivated prior to receiving this SCell
Activation/Deactivation MAC CE; or
2> if the SCell is configured with _sCellState_ set to _activated_ upon SCell
configuration:
3> if _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ is not set to dormant BWP:
4> activate the SCell according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [6] for MAC
CE activation and according to the timing defined in TS 38.133 [11] for direct
SCell activation; i.e. apply normal SCell operation including:
5> SRS transmissions on the SCell;
5> CSI reporting for the SCell;
5> PDCCH monitoring on the SCell;
5> PDCCH monitoring for the SCell;
5> PUCCH transmissions on the SCell, if configured.
3> else (i.e. _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ is set to dormant BWP):
4> stop the _bwp-InactivityTimer_ of this Serving Cell, if running.
3> activate the DL BWP and UL BWP indicated by _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ and
_firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id_ respectively.
2> start or restart the _sCellDeactivationTimer_ associated with the SCell
according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [6] for MAC CE activation and
according to the timing defined in TS 38.133 [11] for direct SCell activation;
2> if the active DL BWP is not the dormant BWP:
3> (re-)initialize any suspended configured uplink grants of configured grant
Type 1 associated with this SCell according to the stored configuration, if
any, and to start in the symbol according to rules in clause 5.8.2;
3> trigger PHR according to clause 5.4.6.
1> else if an SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received deactivating
the SCell; or
1> if the _sCellDeactivationTimer_ associated with the activated SCell
expires:
2> deactivate the SCell according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [6];
2> stop the _sCellDeactivationTimer_ associated with the SCell;
2> stop the _bwp-InactivityTimer_ associated with the SCell;
2> deactivate any active BWP associated with the SCell;

Type 2 associated with the SCell respectively;
2> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting associated with
the SCell;
2> suspend any configured uplink grant Type 1 associated with the SCell;
2> flush all HARQ buffers associated with the SCell;
2> cancel, if any, triggered consistent LBT failure for the SCell.
1> if PDCCH on the activated SCell indicates an uplink grant or downlink
assignment; or
1> if PDCCH on the Serving Cell scheduling the activated SCell indicates an
uplink grant or a downlink assignment for the activated SCell; or
1> if a MAC PDU is transmitted in a configured uplink grant and LBT failure
indication is not received from lower layers; or
1> if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment:
2> restart the _sCellDeactivationTimer_ associated with the SCell.
1> if the SCell is deactivated:
2> not transmit SRS on the SCell;
2> not report CSI for the SCell;
2> not transmit on UL-SCH on the SCell;
2> not transmit on RACH on the SCell;
2> not monitor the PDCCH on the SCell;
2> not monitor the PDCCH for the SCell;
2> not transmit PUCCH on the SCell.
HARQ feedback for the MAC PDU containing SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE
shall not be impacted by PCell, PSCell and PUCCH SCell interruptions due to
SCell activation/deactivation in TS 38.133 [11].
When SCell is deactivated, the ongoing Random Access procedure on the SCell,
if any, is aborted.
## 5.10 Activation/Deactivation of PDCP duplication
If one or more DRBs are configured with PDCP duplication, the network may
activate and deactivate the PDCP duplication for all or a subset of associated
RLC entities for the configured DRB(s).
The PDCP duplication for the configured DRB(s) is activated and deactivated
by:
\- receiving the Duplication Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in
clause 6.1.3.11;
\- receiving the Duplication RLC Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in
clause 6.1.3.32;
\- indication by RRC.
The PDCP duplication for all or a subset of associated RLC entities for the
configured DRB(s) is activated and deactivated by:
\- receiving the Duplication RLC Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in
clause 6.1.3.32;
\- indication by RRC.
The MAC entity shall for each DRB configured with PDCP duplication:
1> if a Duplication Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received activating the
PDCP duplication of the DRB:
2> indicate the activation of PDCP duplication of the DRB to upper layers.
1> if a Duplication Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received deactivating
the PDCP duplication of the DRB:
2> indicate the deactivation of PDCP duplication of the DRB to upper layers.
1> if a Duplication RLC Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received activating
PDCP duplication for associated RLC entities of a DRB configured with PDCP
duplication:
2> indicate the activation of PDCP duplication for the indicated secondary RLC
entity(ies) of the DRB to upper layers.
1> if a Duplication RLC Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received
deactivating PDCP duplication for associated RLC entities of a DRB configured
with PDCP duplication:
2> indicate the deactivation of PDCP duplication for the indicated secondary
RLC entity(ies) of the DRB to upper layers.
## 5.11 MAC reconfiguration

entity shall:
1> initialize the corresponding HARQ entity upon addition of an SCell;
1> remove the corresponding HARQ entity upon removal of an SCell;
1> apply the new value for timers when the timer is (re)started;
1> apply the new maximum parameter value when counters are initialized;
1> apply immediately the configurations received from upper layers for other
parameters.
## 5.12 MAC Reset
If a reset of the MAC entity is requested by upper layers, the MAC entity
shall:
1> initialize _Bj_ for each logical channel to zero;
1> initialize _SBj_ for each logical channel to zero if Sidelink resource

When a MAC entity receives a MAC PDU for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI or CS-RNTI,
or by the configured downlink assignment, containing a Reserved LCID or eLCID
value, or an LCID or eLCID value the MAC Entity does not support, the MAC
entity shall at least:
1> discard the received subPDU and any remaining subPDUs in the MAC PDU.
When a MAC entity receives a MAC PDU for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI or CS-RNTI,

## 5.15 Bandwidth Part (BWP) operation
### 5.15.1 Downlink and Uplink
In addition to clause 12 of TS 38.213 [6], this clause specifies requirements
on BWP operation.
A Serving Cell may be configured with one or multiple BWPs, and the maximum
number of BWP per Serving Cell is specified in TS 38.213 [6].
The BWP switching for a Serving Cell is used to activate an inactive BWP and
deactivate an active BWP at a time. The BWP switching is controlled by the
PDCCH indicating a downlink assignment or an uplink grant, by the _bwp-
InactivityTimer_ , by RRC signalling, or by the MAC entity itself upon
initiation of Random Access procedure or upon detection of consistent LBT
failure on SpCell. Upon RRC (re-)configuration of _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_
and/or _firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id_ for SpCell or activation of an SCell, the DL
BWP and/or UL BWP indicated by _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ and/or
_firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id_ respectively (as specified in TS 38.331 [5]) is
active without receiving PDCCH indicating a downlink assignment or an uplink
grant. The active BWP for a Serving Cell is indicated by either RRC or PDCCH
(as specified in TS 38.213 [6]). For unpaired spectrum, a DL BWP is paired
with a UL BWP, and BWP switching is common for both UL and DL.
For each SCell a dormant BWP may be configured with _dormantBWP-Id_ _by_ RRC
signalling as described in TS 38.331 [5]_._ Entering or leaving dormant BWP
for SCells is done by BWP switching per SCell or per dormancy SCell group
based on instruction from PDCCH (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]). The dormancy
SCell group configurations are configured by RRC signalling as described in TS
38.331 [5]. Upon reception of the PDCCH indicating leaving dormant BWP, the DL
BWP indicated by _firstOutsideActiveTimeBWP-Id_ or by
_firstWithinActiveTimeBWP-Id_ (as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and TS 38.213
[6]) is activated. Upon reception of the PDCCH indicating entering dormant
BWP, the DL BWP indicated by _dormantBWP-Id_ (as specified in TS 38.331 [5])
is activated. The dormant BWP configuration for SpCell or PUCCH SCell is not
supported.
For each activated Serving Cell configured with a BWP, the MAC entity shall:
1> if a BWP is activated and the active DL BWP for the Serving Cell is not the
dormant BWP:
2> transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;
2> transmit on RACH on the BWP, if PRACH occasions are configured;
2> monitor the PDCCH on the BWP;
2> transmit PUCCH on the BWP, if configured;
2> report CSI for the BWP;
2> transmit SRS on the BWP, if configured;
2> receive DL-SCH on the BWP;
2> (re-)initialize any suspended configured uplink grants of configured grant
Type 1 on the active BWP according to the stored configuration, if any, and to
start in the symbol according to rules in clause 5.8.2;
2> if _lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig_ is configured:
3> stop the _lbt-FailureDetectionTimer_ , if running;
3> set _LBT_COUNTER_ to 0;
3> monitor LBT failure indications from lower layers as specified in clause
5.21.2.
1> if a BWP is activated and the active DL BWP for the Serving Cell is dormant
BWP:
2> stop the _bwp-InactivityTimer_ of this Serving Cell, if running.
2> not monitor the PDCCH on the BWP;
2> not monitor the PDCCH for the BWP;
2> not receive DL-SCH on the BWP;
2> not report CSI on the BWP, report CSI except aperiodic CSI for the BWP;
2> not transmit SRS on the BWP;
2> not transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;
2> not transmit on RACH on the BWP;
2> not transmit PUCCH on the BWP;
2> clear any configured downlink assignment and any configured uplink grant
Type 2 associated with the SCell respectively;
2> suspend any configured uplink grant Type 1 associated with the SCell;
2> if configured, perform beam failure detection and beam failure recovery for
the SCell if beam failure is detected.
1> if a BWP is deactivated:
2> not transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;
2> not transmit on RACH on the BWP;
2> not monitor the PDCCH on the BWP;
2> not transmit PUCCH on the BWP;
2> not report CSI for the BWP;
2> not transmit SRS on the BWP;
2> not receive DL-SCH on the BWP;
2> clear any configured downlink assignment and configured uplink grant of
configured grant Type 2 on the BWP;
2> suspend any configured uplink grant of configured grant Type 1 on the
inactive BWP.
Upon initiation of the Random Access procedure on a Serving Cell, after the
selection of carrier for performing Random Access procedure as specified in
clause 5.1.1, the MAC entity shall for the selected carrier of this Serving
Cell:
1> if PRACH occasions are not configured for the active UL BWP:
2> switch the active UL BWP to BWP indicated by _initialUplinkBWP_ ;
2> if the Serving Cell is an SpCell:
3> switch the active DL BWP to BWP indicated by _initialDownlinkBWP_.
1> else:
2> if the Serving Cell is an SpCell:
3> if the active DL BWP does not have the same _bwp-Id_ as the active UL BWP:
4> switch the active DL BWP to the DL BWP with the same _bwp-Id_ as the active
UL BWP.
1> stop the _bwp-InactivityTimer_ associated with the active DL BWP of this
Serving Cell, if running.
1> if the Serving Cell is SCell:
2> stop the _bwp-InactivityTimer_ associated with the active DL BWP of SpCell,
if running.
1> perform the Random Access procedure on the active DL BWP of SpCell and
active UL BWP of this Serving Cell.
If the MAC entity receives a PDCCH for BWP switching of a Serving Cell, the
MAC entity shall:
1> if there is no ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving
Cell; or
1> if the ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving Cell is
successfully completed upon reception of this PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI (as
specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.4a, and 5.1.5):
2> cancel, if any, triggered consistent LBT failure for this Serving Cell;
2> perform BWP switching to a BWP indicated by the PDCCH.
If the MAC entity receives a PDCCH for BWP switching for a Serving Cell(s) or
a dormancy SCell group(s) while a Random Access procedure associated with that
Serving Cell is ongoing in the MAC entity, it is up to UE implementation
whether to switch BWP or ignore the PDCCH for BWP switching, except for the
PDCCH reception for BWP switching addressed to the C-RNTI for successful
Random Access procedure completion (as specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.4a, and
5.1.5) in which case the UE shall perform BWP switching to a BWP indicated by
the PDCCH. Upon reception of the PDCCH for BWP switching other than successful
contention resolution, if the MAC entity decides to perform BWP switching, the
MAC entity shall stop the ongoing Random Access procedure and initiate a
Random Access procedure after performing the BWP switching; if the MAC decides
to ignore the PDCCH for BWP switching, the MAC entity shall continue with the
ongoing Random Access procedure on the Serving Cell.
Upon reception of RRC (re-)configuration for BWP switching for a Serving Cell
while a Random Access procedure associated with that Serving Cell is ongoing
in the MAC entity, the MAC entity shall stop the ongoing Random Access
procedure and initiate a Random Access procedure after performing the BWP
switching.
Upon reception of RRC (re-)configuration for BWP switching for a Serving Cell,
cancel any triggered LBT failure in this Serving Cell.
The MAC entity shall for each activated Serving Cell configured with _bwp-
InactivityTimer_ :
1> if the _defaultDownlinkBWP-Id_ is configured, and the active DL BWP is not
the BWP indicated by the _defaultDownlinkBWP-Id, and the active DL BWP is not
the BWP indicated by the dormantBWP-Id_ if configured; or
1> if the _defaultDownlinkBWP-Id_ is not configured, and the active DL BWP is
not the _initialDownlinkBWP, and the active DL BWP is not the BWP indicated by
the dormantBWP-Id_ if configured:
2> if a PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI or CS-RNTI indicating downlink assignment or
uplink grant is received on the active BWP; or
2> if a PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI or CS-RNTI indicating downlink assignment or
uplink grant is received for the active BWP; or
2> if a MAC PDU is transmitted in a configured uplink grant and LBT failure

## 5.16 SUL operation
The Supplementary UL (SUL) carrier can be configured as a complement to the
normal UL (NUL) carrier. Switching between the NUL carrier and the SUL carrier
means that the UL transmissions move from one carrier to the other carrier,
which is done by:
\- an indication in DCI;
\- the Random Access procedure as specified in clause 5.1.1.
If the MAC entity receives a UL grant indicating an SUL switch while a Random
Access procedure is ongoing, the MAC entity shall ignore the UL grant.
The Serving Cell configured with _supplementaryUplink_ belongs to a single
TAG.
## 5.17 Beam Failure Detection and Recovery procedure
The MAC entity may be configured by RRC per Serving Cell with a beam failure
recovery procedure which is used for indicating to the serving gNB of a new
SSB or CSI-RS when beam failure is detected on the serving SSB(s)/CSI-RS(s).
Beam failure is detected by counting beam failure instance indication from the
lower layers to the MAC entity. If _beamFailureRecoveryConfig_ is reconfigured
by upper layers during an ongoing Random Access procedure for beam failure
recovery for SpCell, the MAC entity shall stop the ongoing Random Access
procedure and initiate a Random Access procedure using the new configuration.
RRC configures the following parameters in the _BeamFailureRecoveryConfig_ ,
_BeamFailureRecoverySCellConfig_ , and the _RadioLinkMonitoringConfig_ for the
Beam Failure Detection and Recovery procedure:
\- _beamFailureInstanceMaxCount_ for the beam failure detection;
\- _beamFailureDetectionTimer_ for the beam failure detection;
\- _beamFailureRecoveryTimer_ for the beam failure recovery procedure;
\- _rsrp-ThresholdSSB_ : an RSRP threshold for the SpCell beam failure
recovery;
\- _rsrp-ThresholdBFR_ : an RSRP threshold for the SCell beam failure
recovery;

recovery;
\- _scalingFactorBI_ : _scalingFactorBI_ for the SpCell beam failure recovery;
\- _ssb-perRACH-Occasion_ : _ssb-perRACH-Occasion_ for the SpCell beam failure
recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;
\- _ra-ResponseWindow_ : the time window to monitor response(s) for the SpCell
beam failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;
\- _prach-ConfigurationIndex_ : _prach-ConfigurationIndex_ for the SpCell beam
failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;
\- _ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex_ : _ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex_ for the SpCell beam
failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;
\- _ra-OccasionList_ : _ra-OccasionList_ for the SpCell beam failure recovery
using contention-free Random Access Resources;
\- _candidateBeamRSList_ : list of candidate beams for SpCell beam failure
recovery;
\- _candidateBeamRSSCellList_ : list of candidate beams for SCell beam failure
recovery.
The following UE variables are used for the beam failure detection procedure:
\- _BFI_COUNTER_ (per Serving Cell): counter for beam failure instance
indication which is initially set to 0.
The MAC entity shall for each Serving Cell configured for beam failure
detection:
1> if beam failure instance indication has been received from lower layers:
2> start or restart the _beamFailureDetectionTimer_ ;
2> increment _BFI_COUNTER_ by 1;
2> if _BFI_COUNTER_ >= _beamFailureInstanceMaxCount_ :
3> if the Serving Cell is SCell:
4> trigger a BFR for this Serving Cell;
3> else:
4> initiate a Random Access procedure (see clause 5.1) on the SpCell.
1> if the _beamFailureDetectionTimer_ expires; or
1> if _beamFailureDetectionTimer_ , _beamFailureInstanceMaxCount_ , or any of
the reference signals used for beam failure detection is reconfigured by upper
layers associated with this Serving Cell:
2> set _BFI_COUNTER_ to 0.
1> if the Serving Cell is SpCell and the Random Access procedure initiated for
SpCell beam failure recovery is successfully completed (see clause 5.1):
2> set _BFI_COUNTER_ to 0;
2> stop the _beamFailureRecoveryTimer_ , if configured;
2> consider the Beam Failure Recovery procedure successfully completed.
1> else if the Serving Cell is SCell, and a PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI
indicating uplink grant for a new transmission is received for the HARQ
process used for the transmission of the BFR MAC CE or Truncated BFR MAC CE
which contains beam failure recovery information of this Serving Cell; or
1> if the SCell is deactivated as specified in clause 5.9:
2> set _BFI_COUNTER_ to 0;
2> consider the Beam Failure Recovery procedure successfully completed and
cancel all the triggered BFRs for this Serving Cell.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the Beam Failure Recovery procedure determines that at least one BFR has
been triggered and not cancelled for an SCell for which evaluation of the
candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11]
has been completed:
2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and if the UL-SCH
resources can accommodate the BFR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of
LCP:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the BFR MAC
CE.
2> else if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and if the
UL-SCH resources can accommodate the Truncated BFR MAC CE plus its subheader
as a result of LCP:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the Truncated
BFR MAC CE.
2> else:
3> trigger the SR for SCell beam failure recovery for each SCell for which BFR
has been triggered, not cancelled, and for which evaluation of the candidate
beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [11] has been
completed.
All BFRs triggered for an SCell shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is
transmitted and this PDU includes a BFR MAC CE or Truncated BFR MAC CE which
contains beam failure information of that SCell.

## 5.21 LBT operation
### 5.21.1 General
The lower layer may perform an LBT procedure, see TS 37.213 [18], according to
which a transmission is not performed by lower layers if the channel is
identified as being occupied. When lower layer performs an LBT procedure
before a transmission and the transmission is not performed, an LBT failure
indication is sent to the MAC entity from lower layers. Unless otherwise
specified, when LBT procedure is performed for a transmission, actions as
specified in this specification are performed regardless of if an LBT failure
indication is received from lower layers. When LBT is not performed by the
lower layers, LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers.
### 5.21.2 LBT failure detection and recovery procedure
The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a consistent LBT failure recovery
procedure. Consistent LBT failure is detected per UL BWP by counting LBT
failure indications, for all UL transmissions, from the lower layers to the
MAC entity.
RRC configures the following parameters in the _lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig_ :
\- _lbt-FailureInstanceMaxCount_ for the consistent LBT failure detection;
\- _lbt-FailureDetectionTimer_ for the consistent LBT failure detection;
The following UE variable is used for the consistent LBT failure detection
procedure:
\- _LBT_COUNTER (per Serving Cell)_ : counter for LBT failure indication which
is initially set to 0.
For each activated Serving Cell configured with _lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig_ ,
the MAC entity shall:
1> if LBT failure indication has been received from lower layers:
2> start or restart the _lbt-FailureDetectionTimer_ ;
2> increment _LBT_COUNTER_ by 1;
2> if _LBT_COUNTER_ >= _lbt-FailureInstanceMaxCount_ :
3> trigger consistent LBT failure for the active UL BWP in this Serving Cell;
3> if this Serving Cell is the SpCell:
4> if consistent LBT failure has been triggered in all UL BWPs configured with
PRACH occasions on same carrier in this Serving Cell:
5> indicate consistent LBT failure to upper layers.
4> else:
5> stop any ongoing Random Access procedure in this Serving Cell;
5> switch the active UL BWP to a UL BWP, on same carrier in this Serving Cell,
configured with PRACH occasion and for which consistent LBT failure has not
been triggered;
5> initiate a Random Access Procedure (as specified in clause 5.1.1).
1> if _all triggered consistent_ LBT failures are cancelled in this Serving
Cell; or
1> if the _lbt-FailureDetectionTimer_ expires; or
1> if _lbt-FailureDetectionTimer_ or _lbt-FailureInstanceMaxCount_ is
reconfigured by upper layers:
2> set _LBT_COUNTER_ to 0.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if consistent LBT failure has been triggered, and not cancelled, in the
SpCell; and
1> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission in the SpCell and
these UL-SCH resources can accommodate the LBT failure MAC CE plus its
subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:
2> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the LBT
failure MAC CE.
1> else if consistent LBT failure has been triggered, and not cancelled, in at
least one SCell:
2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission in a Serving Cell
for which consistent LBT failure has not been triggered and these UL-SCH
resources can accommodate the LBT failure MAC CE plus its subheader as a
result of logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the LBT
failure MAC CE.
2> else:
3> trigger a Scheduling Request for LBT failure MAC CE.
1> if a MAC PDU is transmitted and LBT failure indication is not received from
lower layers and this PDU includes the LBT failure MAC CE:
2> cancel all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) in SCell(s) for which
consistent LBT failure was indicated in the transmitted LBT failure MAC CE.
1> if consistent LBT failure is triggered and not cancelled in the SpCell; and
1> if the Random Access procedure is considered successfully completed (see
clause 5.1) in the SpCell:
2> cancel all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) in the SpCell.
1> if _lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig_ is reconfigured by upper layers for a
Serving Cell:
2> cancel all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) in this Serving Cell.
## 5.22 SL-SCH Data transfer
### 5.22.1 SL-SCH Data transmission
#### 5.22.1.1 SL Grant reception and SCI transmission

shall have a sidelink grant on an active SL BWP to determine a set of PSCCH
duration(s) in which transmission of SCI occurs and a set of PSSCH duration(s)
in which transmission of SL-SCH associated with the SCI occurs. A sidelink
grant addressed to SL-CS-RNTI with NDI = 1 is considered as a dynamic sidelink

slot of an SL transmission is derived from the following equation:
HARQ Process ID = [floor(CURRENT_slot / _PeriodicitySL_)] modulo _sl-NrOfHARQ-
Processes_ \+ _sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset_
where CURRENT_slot refers to current logical slot in the associated resource
pool, and _PeriodicitySL_ is defined in clause 5.8.3.

equal to _sl-ReselectAfter_ ; or
1> if the selected sidelink grant cannot accommodate a RLC SDU by using the
maximum allowed MCS configured by RRC in _sl-MaxMCS-PSSCH_ associated with the
selected MCS table and the UE selects not to segment the RLC SDU; or
NOTE 1: If the selected sidelink grant cannot accommodate the RLC SDU, it is
left for UE implementation whether to perform segmentation or sidelink
resource reselection.
1> if transmission(s) with the selected sidelink grant cannot fulfil the
remaining PDB of the data in a logical channel, and the MAC entity selects not
to perform transmission(s) corresponding to a single MAC PDU:
NOTE 2: If the remaining PDB is not met, it is left for UE implementation
whether to perform transmission(s) corresponding to single MAC PDU or sidelink
resource reselection.
NOTE 3: It is left for UE implementation whether to trigger the TX resource
(re-)selection due to the latency requirement of the MAC CE triggered
according to clause 5.22.1.7.

multiplexing and assembly entity is re-evaluated by physical layer at _T~3~_
before the slot where the SCI indicating the resource(s) is signalled at first
time as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7].
A resource(s) of the selected sidelink grant which has been indicated by a
prior SCI for a MAC PDU to transmit from multiplexing and assembly entity
could be checked for pre-emption by physical layer at _T~3~_ before the slot
where the resource(s) is located as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214
[7].
NOTE 1: It is up to UE implementation to re-evaluate or pre-empt before \'m --
_T~3~_ \' or after \'m -- _T~3~_ \' but before \'m\'. For re-evaluation, m is
the slot where the SCI indicating the resource(s) is signalled at first time
as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214. For pre-emption, m is the slot
where the resource(s) is located as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214.
If the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2
to transmit using pool(s) of resources in a carrier as indicated in TS 38.331

retransmissions and the remaining PDB of either SL data available in the
logical channel(s) by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected
resources of the selected sidelink grant in case that PSFCH is configured for
this pool of resources, and that a resource can be indicated by the time
resource assignment of an SCI for a retransmission according to clause 8.3.1.1
of TS 38.212 [9];
NOTE 2: If retransmission resource(s) cannot be selected by ensuring that the
resource(s) can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI,
how to select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission
opportunities from the available resources is left for UE implementation by
ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected â€Žresources in case that
PSFCH is configured for this pool of â€Žresources.
2> replace the removed or dropped resource(s) by the selected resource(s) for
the selected sidelink grant.
NOTE 3: It is left for UE implementation to reselect any pre-selected but not
reserved resource(s) other than the resource(s) indicated for pre-emption or
re-evaluation by the physical layer during reselection triggered by re-
evaluation or pre-emption indicated by the physical layer.

due to deprioritization as specified in clause 16.2.4 of TS 38.213 [6], clause
5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] and clause 5.22.1.3.1a.
NOTE 6: For the selected sidelink grant corresponds to transmissions of
multiple MAC PDU, it is up to UE implementation whether to apply re-evaluation
check to the resources in non-initial reservation period that have been
signalled neither in the immediate last nor in the current period.

2> if the HARQ Process ID corresponding to the sidelink grant received on
PDCCH, the configured sidelink grant or the selected sidelink grant is
associated to a Sidelink process of which HARQ buffer is empty; or
2> if the HARQ Process ID corresponding to the sidelink grant received on
PDCCH is not associated to any Sidelink process:
3> ignore the sidelink grant.
2> else:
3> identify the Sidelink process associated with this grant, and for the
associated Sidelink process:
4> deliver the sidelink grant of the MAC PDU to the associated Sidelink
process;
4> instruct the associated Sidelink process to trigger a retransmission.
##### 5.22.1.3.1a Sidelink process
The Sidelink process is associated with a HARQ buffer.
New transmissions and retransmissions are performed on the resource indicated
in the sidelink grant as specified in clause 5.22.1.1 and with the MCS
selected as specified in clause 8.1.3.1 of TS 38.214 [7] and clause 5.22.1.1.
If the Sidelink process is configured to perform transmissions of multiple MAC
PDUs with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2, the process maintains a counter
_SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER_. For other configurations of the Sidelink
process, this counter is not available.
Priority of a MAC PDU is determined by the highest priority of the logical
channel(s) or a MAC CE in the MAC PDU.
If the Sidelink HARQ Entity requests a new transmission, the Sidelink process
shall:
1> store the MAC PDU in the associated HARQ buffer;
1> store the sidelink grant received from the Sidelink HARQ Entity;
1> generate a transmission as described below.
If the Sidelink HARQ Entity requests a retransmission, the Sidelink process
shall:
1> store the sidelink grant received from the Sidelink HARQ Entity;
1> generate a transmission as described below.
To generate a transmission, the Sidelink process shall:
1> if there is no uplink transmission; or
1> if the MAC entity is able to simultaneously perform uplink transmission(s)
and sidelink transmission at the time of the transmission; or
1> if the other MAC entity and the MAC entity are able to simultaneously
perform uplink transmission(s) and sidelink transmission at the time of the
transmission respectively; or
1> if there is a MAC PDU to be transmitted for this duration in uplink, except
a MAC PDU obtained from the Msg3 buffer, the MSGA buffer, or prioritized as
specified in clause 5.4.2.2, and the sidelink transmission is prioritized over
uplink transmission:
2> instruct the physical layer to transmit SCI according to the stored
sidelink grant with the associated Sidelink transmission information;
2> instruct the physical layer to generate a transmission according to the
stored sidelink grant;
2> if HARQ feedback has been enabled for the MAC PDU according to clause
5.22.1.4.2:
3> instruct the physical layer to monitor PSFCH for the transmission and
perform PSFCH reception as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.2.
2> if _sl-PUCCH-Config_ is configured by RRC for the stored sidelink grant:
3> determine transmission of an acknowledgement on the PUCCH as specified in
clause 5.22.1.3.2.
1> if this transmission corresponds to the last transmission of the MAC PDU:
2> decrement _SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER_ by 1, if available.
NOTE 1: If the number of HARQ retransmissions selected by the MAC entity has
been reached, or if a positive acknowledgement to a transmission of the MAC
PDU has been received, or if a negative-only acknowledgement was enabled in
the SCI and no negative acknowledgement was received for the transmission of
the MAC PDU, the MAC entity determines this transmission corresponds to the
last transmission of the MAC PDU for Sidelink resource allocation mode 2. How
to determine the last transmission in other cases is up to UE implementation.
1> if _sl-MaxTransNum_ corresponding to the highest priority of the logical
channel(s) in the MAC PDU has been configured in _sl-CG-MaxTransNumList_ for
the sidelink grant by RRC and the number of transmissions of the MAC PDU has
been reached to _sl-MaxTransNum_ ; or
1> if a positive acknowledgement to this transmission of the MAC PDU was
received according to clause 5.22.1.3.2; or
1> if negative-only acknowledgement was enabled in the SCI and no negative
acknowledgement was received for this transmission of the MAC PDU according to
clause 5.22.1.3.2:
2> flush the HARQ buffer of the associated Sidelink process.
The transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over uplink transmission(s) of
the MAC entity or the other MAC entity if the following conditions are met:
1> if the MAC entity is not able to perform this sidelink transmission
simultaneously with all uplink transmission(s) at the time of the
transmission, and
1> if none of the uplink transmission(s) is prioritized by upper layer
according to TS 23.287 [19], and
1> if none of the NR uplink MAC PDU(s) includes any MAC CE prioritized as
described in clause 5.4.3.1.3, and
1> if _ul-PrioritizationThres_ is configured and if the value of the highest
priority of logical channel(s) of all the NR uplink transmission(s) is not
lower than _ul-PrioritizationThres_ , and
1> if _sl-PrioritizationThres_ is configured and if the value of the highest
priority of logical channel(s) or a MAC CE in the MAC PDU is lower than _sl-
PrioritizationThres_.
NOTE 2: If the MAC entity is not able to perform this sidelink transmission
simultaneously with all uplink transmissions as specified in clause 5.4.2.2 of
TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the transmission, and prioritization-related
information is not available prior to the time of this sidelink transmission
due to processing time restriction, it is up to UE implementation whether this
sidelink transmission is performed.
##### 5.22.1.3.2 PSFCH reception
The MAC entity shall for each PSSCH transmission:
1> if an acknowledgement corresponding to the PSSCH transmission in clause
5.22.1.3.1a is obtained from the physical layer:
2> deliver the acknowledgement to the corresponding Sidelink HARQ entity for
the Sidelink process;
1> else:
2> deliver a negative acknowledgement to the corresponding Sidelink HARQ
entity for the Sidelink process;
1> if the PSSCH transmission occurs for a pair of Source Layer-2 ID and
Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC connection which has been
established by upper layers:
2> perform the HARQ-Based Sidelink RLF Detection procedure as specified in
clause 5.22.1.3.3.
If _sl-PUCCH-Config_ is configured by RRC, the MAC entity shall for a PUCCH
transmission occasion:
1> if the _timeAlignmentTimer_ , associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped or
expired:
2> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data
in this TB.
1> else if a MAC PDU has been obtained for a sidelink grant associated to the
PUCCH transmission occasion in clause 5.22.1.3.1, the MAC entity shall:
2> if the most recent transmission of the MAC PDU was not prioritized as
specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a:
3> instruct the physical layer to signal a negative acknowledgement on the
PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6].
2> else if HARQ feedback has been disabled for the MAC PDU and next
retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU is not required:
3> instruct the physical layer to signal a positive acknowledgement
corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS
38.213 [6].
2> else if HARQ feedback has been disabled for the MAC PDU, and no sidelink
grant is available for next retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU (including
immediately after all PSSCH duration(s) in an _sl-PeriodCG_ for the sidelink
grant, the number of transmissions of the MAC PDU has not reached _sl-
MaxTransNum_ corresponding to the highest priority of the logical channel(s)
in the MAC PDU, if configured in _sl-CG-MaxTransNumList_ for the sidelink
grant by RRC), if any:
3> instruct the physical layer to signal a negative acknowledgement
corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS
38.213 [6].
2> else:
3> instruct the physical layer to signal an acknowledgement corresponding to
the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6]
1> else:
2> instruct the physical layer to signal a positive acknowledgement on the
PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6].
##### 5.22.1.3.3 HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection
The HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection procedure is used to detect Sidelink RLF
based on a number of consecutive DTX on PSFCH reception occasions for a
PC5-RRC connection.
RRC configures the following parameter to control HARQ-based Sidelink RLF
detection:
\- _sl-maxNumConsecutiveDTX_.
The following UE variable is used for HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection.
\- _numConsecutiveDTX_ , which is maintained for each PC5-RRC connection.
The Sidelink HARQ Entity shall (re-)initialize _numConsecutiveDTX_ to zero for
each PC5-RRC connection which has been established by upper layers, if any,
upon establishment of the PC5-RRC connection or (re)configuration of _sl-
maxNumConsecutiveDTX_.
The Sidelink HARQ Entity shall for each PSFCH reception occasion associated to
the PSSCH transmission:
1> if **PSFCH reception is absent on the PSFCH reception occasion** :
2> increment _numConsecutiveDTX_ by 1;
2> if _numConsecutiveDTX_ reaches _sl-maxNumConsecutiveDTX_ :
3> indicate HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection to RRC.
1> else:
2> re-initialize _numConsecutiveDTX_ to zero.
#### 5.22.1.4 Multiplexing and assembly
##### 5.22.1.4.0 General
For PDU(s) associated with one SCI, MAC shall consider only logical channels
with the same Source Layer-2 ID-Destination Layer-2 ID pair for one of
unicast, groupcast and broadcast which is associated with the pair. Multiple
transmissions for different Sidelink processes are allowed to be independently
performed in different PSSCH durations.
##### 5.22.1.4.1 Logical channel prioritization
###### 5.22.1.4.1.1 General
The sidelink Logical Channel Prioritization procedure is applied whenever a
new transmission is performed.
RRC controls the scheduling of sidelink data by signalling for each logical
channel:
\- _sl-Priority_ where an increasing priority value indicates a lower priority
level;
\- _sl-PrioritisedBitRate_ which sets the sidelink Prioritized Bit Rate
(sPBR);
\- _sl-BucketSizeDuration_ which sets the sidelink Bucket Size Duration
(sBSD).
RRC additionally controls the LCP procedure by configuring mapping
restrictions for each logical channel:
\- _sl-configuredGrantType1Allowed_ which sets whether a configured grant Type
1 can be used for sidelink transmission;
\- _sl-AllowedCG-List_ which sets the allowed configured grant(s) for sidelink
transmission;
\- _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ which sets whether the logical channel is allowed
to be multiplexed with logical channel(s) with _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ set
to _enabled_ or _disabled_.
The following UE variable is used for the Logical channel prioritization
procedure:
\- _SBj_ which is maintained for each logical channel _j_.
The MAC entity shall initialize _SBj_ of the logical channel to zero when the
logical channel is established.
For each logical channel _j_ , the MAC entity shall:
1> increment _SBj_ by the product sPBR Ã— T before every instance of the LCP
procedure, where T is the time elapsed since _SBj_ was last incremented;
1> if the value of _SBj_ is greater than the sidelink bucket size (i.e. sPBR Ã—
sBSD):
2> set _SBj_ to the sidelink bucket size.
NOTE: The exact moment(s) when the UE updates _SBj_ between LCP procedures is
up to UE implementation, as long as _SBj_ is up to date at the time when a
grant is processed by LCP.
###### 5.22.1.4.1.2 Selection of logical channels
The MAC entity shall for each SCI corresponding to a new transmission:
1> select a Destination associated to one of unicast, groupcast and broadcast,
having at least one of the MAC CE and the logical channel with the highest
priority, among the logical channels that satisfy all the following conditions
and MAC CE(s), if any, for the SL grant associated to the SCI:
2> SL data is available for transmission; and
2> _SBj_ > 0, in case there is any logical channel having _SBj_ > 0; and
2> _sl-configuredGrantType1Allowed_ , if configured, is set to _true_ in case
the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and
2> _sl-AllowedCG-List_ , if configured, includes the configured grant index
associated to the SL grant; and
2> _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ is set to _disabled_ , if PSFCH is not configured
for the SL grant associated to the SCI.
NOTE 1: If multiple Destinations have the logical channels satisfying all
conditions above with the same highest priority or if multiple Destinations
have either the MAC CE and/or the logical channels satisfying all conditions
above with the same priority as the MAC CE, which Destination is selected
among them is up to UE implementation.
1> select the logical channels satisfying all the following conditions among
the logical channels belonging to the selected Destination:
2> SL data is available for transmission; and
2> _sl-configuredGrantType1Allowed_ , if configured, is set to _true_ in case
the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and.
2> _sl-AllowedCG-List_ , if configured, includes the configured grant index
associated to the SL grant; and
2> _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ is set to the value that satisfies the following
conditions:
3> if PSFCH is configured for the sidelink grant associated to the SCI:
4> _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ is set to _enabled_ , if _sl-HARQ-
FeedbackEnabled_ is set to _enabled_ for the highest priority logical channel
satisfying the above conditions; or
4> _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ is set to _disabled_ , if _sl-HARQ-
FeedbackEnabled_ is set to _disabled_ for the highest priority logical channel
satisfying the above conditions.
3> else:
4> _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ is set to disabled.
NOTE 2: HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator is set to disabled for the
transmission of a MAC PDU only carrying CSI reporting MAC CE.
###### 5.22.1.4.1.3 Allocation of sidelink resources
The MAC entity shall for each SCI corresponding to a new transmission:
1> allocate resources to the logical channels as follows:
2> logical channels selected in clause 5.22.1.4.1.2 for the SL grant with
_SBj_ > 0 are allocated resources in a decreasing priority order. If the sPBR
of a logical channel is set to _infinity_ , the MAC entity shall allocate
resources for all the data that is available for transmission on the logical
channel before meeting the sPBR of the lower priority logical channel(s);
2> decrement _SBj_ by the total size of MAC SDUs served to logical channel _j_
above;
2> if any resources remain, all the logical channels selected in clause
5.22.1.4.1.2 are served in a strict decreasing priority order (regardless of
the value of _SBj_) until either the data for that logical channel or the SL
grant is exhausted, whichever comes first. Logical channels configured with
equal priority should be served equally.
NOTE: The value of _SBj_ can be negative.
The UE shall also follow the rules below during the SL scheduling procedures
above:
\- the UE should not segment an RLC SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or
retransmitted RLC PDU) if the whole SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or
retransmitted RLC PDU) fits into the remaining resources of the associated MAC
entity;
\- if the UE segments an RLC SDU from the logical channel, it shall maximize
the size of the segment to fill the grant of the associated MAC entity as much
as possible;
\- the UE should maximise the transmission of data;
\- if the MAC entity is given a sidelink grant size that is equal to or larger
than 12 bytes while having data available and allowed (according to clause
5.22.1.4.1) for transmission, the MAC entity shall not transmit only padding;
\- A logical channel configured with _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ set to
_enabled_ and a logical channel configured with _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ set
to _disabled_ cannot be multiplexed into the same MAC PDU.
The MAC entity shall not generate a MAC PDU for the HARQ entity if the
following conditions are satisfied:
\- there is no Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE generated for this PSSCH
transmission as specified in clause 5.22.1.7; and
\- the MAC PDU includes zero MAC SDUs.
Logical channels shall be prioritised in accordance with the following order
(highest priority listed first):
\- data from SCCH;
\- Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE;
\- data from any STCH.
##### 5.22.1.4.2 Multiplexing of MAC Control Elements and MAC SDUs
The MAC entity shall multiplex a MAC CE and MAC SDUs in a MAC PDU according to
clauses 5.22.1.4.1 and 6.1.6.
#### 5.22.1.5 Scheduling Request
In addition to clause 5.4.4, the Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for
requesting SL-SCH resources for new transmission when triggered by the
Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) or the SL-CSI reporting (clause 5.22.1.7). If
configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this
clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical
channel or for SL-CSI reporting, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is
configured per UL BWP.
The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered the Sidelink BSR
(clause 5.22.1.6) (if such a configuration exists) is also considered as
corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR (clause 5.4.4). The value
of the priority of the triggered SR corresponds to the value of priority of
the logical channel that triggered the SR.
Each sidelink logical channel may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration,
which is configured by RRC. If the SL-CSI reporting procedure is enabled by
RRC, the SL-CSI reporting is mapped to one SR configuration for all PC5-RRC
connections. The SR configuration of the SL-CSI reporting triggered according
to 5.22.1.7 is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered
SR (clause 5.4.4). The value of the priority of the triggered SR corresponds
to the value of the priority of the Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE.
All pending SR(s) triggered according to the Sidelink BSR procedure (clause
5.22.1.6) prior to the MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled and each respective
_sr-ProhibitTimer_ shall be stopped when the MAC PDU is transmitted and this
PDU includes an SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and
including) the last event that triggered a Sidelink BSR (see clause 5.22.1.4)
prior to the MAC PDU assembly.
All pending SR(s) triggered according to the Sidelink BSR procedure (clause
5.22.1.6) shall be cancelled and each respective _sr-ProhibitTimer_ shall be
stopped when the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for
transmission in sidelink.
The pending SR triggered according to the SL-CSI reporting for a destination
shall be cancelled and each respective _sr-ProhibitTimer_ shall be stopped
when the SL grant(s) can accommodate the Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE when
the SL-CSI reporting that has been triggered but not cancelled or when the
triggered SL-CSI reporting is cancelled due to latency non-fulfilment as
specified in 5.22.1.7. All pending SR(s) triggered by either Sidelink BSR or
Sidelink CSI report shall be cancelled, when RRC configures Sidelink resource
allocation mode 2.
#### 5.22.1.6 Buffer Status Reporting
The Sidelink Buffer Status reporting (SL-BSR) procedure is used to provide the
serving gNB with information about SL data volume in the MAC entity.
RRC configures the following parameters to control the SL-BSR:
\- _sl-periodicBSR-Timer_ , configured by _periodicBSR-Timer_ in _sl-BSR-
Config_ ;
\- _sl-retxBSR-Timer_ , configured by _retxBSR-Timer_ in _sl-BSR-Config_ ;
\- _sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied_ ;
\- _sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_ , configured by _logicalChannelSR-
DelayTimer_ in _sl-BSR-Config_ ;
\- _sl-logicalChannelGroup_.
Each logical channel which belongs to a Destination is allocated to an LCG as
specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The maximum number of LCGs is eight.
The MAC entity determines the amount of SL data available for a logical
channel according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [3]
and 38.323 [4].
An SL-BSR shall be triggered if any of the following events occur:
1> if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation
mode 1:
2> SL data, for a logical channel which belongs to an LCG of a Destination,
becomes available to the MAC entity; and either
3> this SL data belongs to a logical channel with higher priority than the
priorities of the logical channels containing available SL data which belong
to any LCG belonging to the same Destination; or
3> none of the logical channels which belong to an LCG belonging to the same
Destination contains any available SL data.
in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to as \'Regular SL-BSR\';
2> UL resources are allocated and number of padding bits remaining after a
Padding BSR has been triggered is equal to or larger than the size of the SL-
BSR MAC CE plus its subheader, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to
as \'Padding SL-BSR\';
2> _sl-retxBSR-Timer_ expires, and at least one of the logical channels which
belong to an LCG contains SL data, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below
to as \'Regular SL-BSR\';
2> _sl-periodicBSR-Timer_ expires, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below
to as \'Periodic SL-BSR\'.
1> else:
2> Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 is configured by RRC and SL data is
available for transmission in the RLC entity or in the PDCP entity, in which
case the Sidelink BSR is referred below to as \"Regular SL-BSR\".
For Regular SL-BSR, the MAC entity shall:
1> if the SL-BSR is triggered for a logical channel for which _sl-
logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied_ with value _true_ is configured by RRC:
2> start or restart the _sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_.
1> else:
2> if running, stop the _sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_.
For Regular and Periodic SL-BSR, the MAC entity shall:
1> if _sl-PrioritizationThres_ is configured and the value of the highest
priority of the logical channels that belong to any LCG and contain SL data
for any Destination is lower than _sl-PrioritizationThres_ ; and
1> if _ul-PrioritizationThres_ is configured and the value of the highest
priority of the logical channels that belong to any LCG and contain UL data is
equal to or higher than _ul-PrioritizationThres_ according to clause 5.4.5:
2> prioritize the LCG(s) for the Destination(s).
1> if the Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least one BSR
has been triggered and not cancelled according to clause 5.4.5 and the UL
grant cannot accommodate an SL-BSR MAC CE containing buffer status only for
all prioritized LCGs having data available for transmission plus the subheader
of the SL-BSR according to clause 5.4.3.1.3, in case the SL-BSR is considered
as not prioritized:
2> prioritize the SL-BSR for logical channel prioritization specified in
clause 5.4.3.1;
2> report Truncated SL-BSR containing buffer status for as many prioritized
LCGs having data available for transmission as possible, taking the number of
bits in the UL grant into consideration.
1> else if the number of bits in the UL grant is expected to be equal to or
larger than the size of an SL-BSR containing buffer status for all LCGs having
data available for transmission plus the subheader of the SL-BSR according to
clause 5.4.3.1.3:
2> report SL-BSR containing buffer status for all LCGs having data available
for transmission.
1> else:
2> report Truncated SL-BSR containing buffer status for as many LCGs having
data available for transmission as possible, taking the number of bits in the
UL grant into consideration.
For Padding SL-BSR:
1> if the number of padding bits remaining after a Padding BSR has been
triggered is equal to or larger than the size of an SL-BSR containing buffer
status for all LCGs having data available for transmission plus its subheader:
2> report SL-BSR containing buffer status for all LCGs having data available
for transmission;
1> else:
2> report Truncated SL-BSR containing buffer status for as many LCGs having
data available for transmission as possible, taking the number of bits in the
UL grant into consideration.
For SL-BSR triggered by _sl-retxBSR-Timer_ expiry, the MAC entity considers
that the logical channel that triggered the SL-BSR is the highest priority
logical channel that has data available for transmission at the time the SL-
BSR is triggered.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the sidelink Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least
one SL-BSR has been triggered and not cancelled:
2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH
resources can accommodate the SL-BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of
logical channel prioritization according to clause 5.4.3.1:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure in clause 5.4.3 to
generate the SL-BSR MAC CE(s);
3> start or restart _sl-periodicBSR-Timer_ except when all the generated SL-
BSRs are Truncated SL-BSRs;
3> start or restart _sl-retxBSR-Timer_.
2> if a Regular SL-BSR has been triggered and _sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_
is not running:
3> if there is no UL-SCH resource available for a new transmission; or
3> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH
resources cannot accommodate the SL-BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result
of logical channel prioritization according to clause 5.4.3.1; or
3> if the set of Subcarrier Spacing index values in _sl-AllowedSCS-List_ , if
configured for the logical channel that triggered the SL-BSR, does not include
the Subcarrier Spacing index associated to the UL-SCH resources available for
a new transmission; or
3> if _sl-MaxPUSCH-Duration_ , if configured for the logical channel that
triggered the SL-BSR, is smaller than the PUSCH transmission duration
associated to the UL-SCH resources available for a new transmission:
4> trigger a Scheduling Request.
NOTE 1: UL-SCH resources are considered available if the MAC entity has been
configured with, receives, or determines an uplink grant. If the MAC entity
has determined at a given point in time that UL-SCH resources are available,
this need not imply that UL-SCH resources are available for use at that point
in time.
A MAC PDU shall contain at most one SL-BSR MAC CE, even when multiple events
have triggered an SL-BSR. The Regular SL-BSR and the Periodic SL-BSR shall
have precedence over the padding SL-BSR.
The MAC entity shall restart _sl-retxBSR-Timer_ upon reception of an SL grant
for transmission of new data on any SL-SCH.
All triggered SL-BSRs may be cancelled when the SL grant(s) can accommodate
all pending data available for transmission. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC
PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU
includes an SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including)
the last event that triggered an SL-BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly. All
triggered SL-BSRs shall be cancelled, and _sl-retx-BSR-Timer_ and _sl-
periodic-BSR-Timer_ shall be stopped, when RRC configures Sidelink resource
allocation mode 2.
NOTE 2: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant
reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. SL-BSR and SR
can be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains an SL-BSR MAC
CE, but before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, SL-BSR and SR
can be triggered during MAC PDU assembly.
#### 5.22.1.7 CSI Reporting
The Sidelink Channel State Information (SL-CSI) reporting procedure is used to
provide a peer UE with sidelink channel state information as specified in
clause 8.5 of TS 38.214 [7].
RRC configures the following parameters to control the SL-CSI reporting
procedure:
\- _sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report_ , which is maintained for each PC5-RRC
connection.
The MAC entity maintains an _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_ for each pair of the Source
Layer-2 ID and the Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC
connection. _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_ is used for an SL-CSI reporting UE to follow
the latency requirement signalled from a CSI triggering UE. The value of _sl-
CSI-ReportTimer_ is the same as theâ€Ž latency requirement of the SL-CSI
reporting in _sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report_ configured by RRC.
The MAC entity shall for each pair of the Source Layer-2 ID and the
Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC connection which has been
established by upper layers:
1> if the SL-CSI reporting has been triggered by an SCI and not cancelled:
2> if the _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_ for the triggered SL-CSI reporting is not
running:
3> start the _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_.
2> if the _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_ for the triggered SL-CSI reporting expires:
3> cancel the triggered SL-CSI reporting.
2> else if the MAC entity has SL resources allocated for new transmission and
the SL-SCH resources can accommodate the SL-CSI reporting MAC CE and its
subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Sidelink CSI
Reporting MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.35;
3> stop the _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_ for the triggered SL-CSI reporting;
3> cancel the triggered SL-CSI reporting.
2> else if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource
allocation mode 1:
3> trigger a Scheduling Request.
NOTE: The MAC entity configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 may
trigger a Scheduling Request if transmission of a pending SL-CSI reporting
with the sidelink grant(s) cannot fulfil the latency requirement associated to
the SL-CSI reporting.
### 5.22.2 SL-SCH Data reception
#### 5.22.2.1 SCI reception
SCI indicates if there is a transmission on SL-SCH and provide the relevant
HARQ information. An SCI consists of two parts: the 1^st^ stage SCI on PSCCH
and the 2^nd^ stage SCI on PSSCH as specified in clause 8.1 of TS 38.214 [7].
The MAC entity shall:
1> for each PSCCH duration during which the MAC entity monitors PSCCH:
2> if a 1^st^ stage SCI has been received on the PSCCH:
3> determine the set of PSSCH durations in which reception of a 2^nd^ stage
SCI and the transport block occur using the received part of the SCI;
3> if the 2^nd^ stage SCI for this PSSCH duration has been received on the
PSSCH:
4> store the SCI as a valid SCI for the PSSCH durations corresponding to
transmission(s) of the transport block and the associated HARQ information and
QoS information;
1> for each PSSCH duration for which the MAC entity has a valid SCI:
2> deliver the SCI and the associated Sidelink transmission information to the
Sidelink HARQ Entity.
#### 5.22.2.2 Sidelink HARQ operation
##### 5.22.2.2.1 Sidelink HARQ Entity
There is at most one Sidelink HARQ Entity at the MAC entity for reception of
the SL-SCH, which maintains a number of parallel Sidelink processes.
Each Sidelink process is associated with SCI in which the MAC entity is
interested. This interest is determined by the Sidelink identification
information of the SCI. The Sidelink HARQ Entity directs Sidelink transmission
information and associated TBs received on the SL-SCH to the corresponding
Sidelink processes.
The number of Receiving Sidelink processes associated with the Sidelink HARQ
Entity is defined in TS 38.306 [5].
For each PSSCH duration, the Sidelink HARQ Entity shall:
1> for each SCI valid for this PSSCH duration:
2> if the NDI has been toggled compared to the value of the previous received
transmission corresponding to the Sidelink identification information and the
Sidelink process ID of the SCI or this is the very first received transmission
for the pair of the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink
process ID of the SCI:
3> if there is a Sidelink process associated with the Sidelink identification
information and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI:
4> consider the Sidelink process as unoccupied;
4> flush the soft buffer for the Sidelink process.
3> allocate the TB received from the physical layer and the associated
Sidelink identification information and Sidelink process ID to an unoccupied
Sidelink process;
3> associate the Sidelink process with the Sidelink identification information
and the Sidelink process ID of this SCI and consider this transmission to be a
new transmission.
NOTE 1: When a new TB arrives, the Sidelink HARQ Entity allocates the TB to
any unoccupied Sidelink process. If there is no unoccupied Sidelink process in
the Sidelink HARQ entity, how to manage receiving Sidelink processes is up to
UE implementation.
NOTE 1a: If the NDI has not been toggled compared to the value of the previous
received transmission corresponding to the Sidelink identification information
and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI, and if there is no Sidelink process
associated with the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink
process ID of the SCI, it is up to UE implementation to handle the
corresponding TB.
1> for each Sidelink process:
2> if the NDI has not been toggled compared to the value of the previous
received transmission corresponding to the Sidelink identification information
and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI for the Sidelink process according to
its associated SCI:
3> allocate the TB received from the physical layer to the Sidelink process
and consider this transmission to be a retransmission.
NOTE 2: A single sidelink process can only be (re-)associated to a single
combination of Sidelink identification information and Sidelink process ID at
a time and a single combination of Sidelink identification information and
Sidelink process ID can only be (re-)associated to a single sidelink process
at a time.
##### 5.22.2.2.2 Sidelink process
For each PSSCH duration where a transmission takes place for the Sidelink
process, one TB and the associated HARQ information is received from the
Sidelink HARQ Entity.
For each received TB and associated Sidelink transmission information, the
Sidelink process shall:
1> if this is a new transmission:
2> attempt to decode the received data.
1> else if this is a retransmission:
2> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:
3> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the data
currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the combined
data.
1> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was successfully
decoded for this TB; or
1> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:
2> if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this TB:
3> if this TB is associated to unicast and the DST field of the decoded MAC
PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of any of the Source Layer-2 ID(s) of the
UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to the Destination ID in the corresponding
SCI:
4> if the SRC field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 16 MSB of
any of the Destination Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 8 LSB are equal
to the Source ID in the corresponding SCI; or
4> if this TB is corresponding to the logical channel with LCID equal to 0 or
1 and determined to be the first TB:
5> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing entity.
3> if this TB is associated to groupcast or broadcast and the DST field of the
decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of any of the Destination
Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to the Destination ID
in the corresponding SCI:
4> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing entity;
NOTE: Whether the TB is the first TB can be determined based on the Source
Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID pair.
2> consider the Sidelink process as unoccupied.
1> else:
2> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer for this
TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.
1> if HARQ feedback is enabled by the SCI:
2> if negative-only acknowledgement is indicated by the SCI according to
clause 8.4.1 of TS 38.212 [9]:
3> if UE\'s location information is available and distance beteween UE\'s
location and the central location of the nearest zone that is calculated based
on the _Zone_id_ in the SCI and the value of _sl-ZoneLength_ corresponding to
the communication range requirement in the SCI as specified in TS 38.331 [5]
is smaller or equal to the communication range requirement in the SCI; or
3> if none of _Zone_id_ and communication range requirement is indicated by
the SCI; or
3> if UE\'s location information is not available:
4> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was not successfully
decoded for this TB and the data for this TB was not successfully decoded
before:
5> instruct the physical layer to generate a negative acknowledgement of the
data in this TB.
2> if negative-positive acknowledgement or unicast is indicated by the SCI
according to clause 8.4.1 of TS 38.212 [9]:
3> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was successfully
decoded for this TB or the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:
4> instruct the physical layer to generate a positive acknowledgement of the
data in this TB.
3> else:
4> instruct the physical layer to generate a negative acknowledgement of the
data in this TB.
#### 5.22.2.3 Disassembly and demultiplexing
The MAC entity shall disassemble and demultiplex a MAC PDU as defined in
clause 6.1.6.
## 5.23 SL-BCH data transfer
### 5.23.1 SL-BCH data transmission
When instructed to send SL-BCH, the MAC entity shall:
1> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from SBCCH;
1> deliver the MAC PDU to the physical layer and instruct it to generate a
transmission.
### 5.23.2 SL-BCH data reception
When the MAC entity needs to receive SL-BCH, the MAC entity shall:
1> receive and attempt to decode the SL-BCH;
1> if a TB on the SL-BCH has been successfully decoded:
2> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
# 6 Protocol Data Units, formats and parameters
## 6.1 Protocol Data Units
### 6.1.1 General
A MAC PDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in
length. In the figures in clause 6, bit strings are represented by tables in
which the most significant bit is the leftmost bit of the first line of the
table, the least significant bit is the rightmost bit on the last line of the
table, and more generally the bit string is to be read from left to right and
then in the reading order of the lines. The bit order of each parameter field
within a MAC PDU is represented with the first and most significant bit in the
leftmost bit and the last and least significant bit in the rightmost bit.
A MAC SDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in
length. A MAC SDU is included into a MAC PDU from the first bit onward.
A MAC CE is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in
length.
A MAC subheader is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits)
in length. Each MAC subheader is placed immediately in front of the
corresponding MAC SDU, MAC CE, or padding.
The MAC entity shall ignore the value of the Reserved bits in downlink MAC
PDUs.
### 6.1.2 MAC PDU (DL-SCH and UL-SCH except transparent MAC and Random Access
Response)
A MAC PDU consists of one or more MAC subPDUs. Each MAC subPDU consists of one
of the following:
\- A MAC subheader only (including padding);
\- A MAC subheader and a MAC SDU;
\- A MAC subheader and a MAC CE;
\- A MAC subheader and padding.
The MAC SDUs are of variable sizes.
Each MAC subheader corresponds to either a MAC SDU, a MAC CE, or padding.
A MAC subheader except for fixed sized MAC CE, padding, and a MAC SDU
containing UL CCCH consists of the header fields R/F/LCID/(eLCID)/L. A MAC
subheader for fixed sized MAC CE, padding, and a MAC SDU containing UL CCCH
consists of the two header fields R/LCID/(eLCID).
Figure 6.1.2-1: R/F/LCID/(eLCID)/L MAC subheader with 8-bit L field
Figure 6.1.2-2: R/F/LCID/(eLCID)/L MAC subheader with 16-bit L field
Figure 6.1.2-3: R/LCID/(eLCID) MAC subheader
MAC CEs are placed together. DL MAC subPDU(s) with MAC CE(s) is placed before
any MAC subPDU with MAC SDU and MAC subPDU with padding as depicted in Figure
6.1.2-4. UL MAC subPDU(s) with MAC CE(s) is placed after all the MAC subPDU(s)
with MAC SDU and before the MAC subPDU with padding in the MAC PDU as depicted
in Figure 6.1.2-5. The size of padding can be zero.
Figure 6.1.2-4: Example of a DL MAC PDU
Figure 6.1.2-5: Example of a UL MAC PDU
A maximum of one MAC PDU can be transmitted per TB per MAC entity.
### 6.1.3 MAC Control Elements (CEs)
#### 6.1.3.1 Buffer Status Report MAC CEs
Buffer Status Report (BSR) MAC CEs consist of either:
\- Short BSR format (fixed size); or
\- Long BSR format (variable size); or
\- Short Truncated BSR format (fixed size); or
\- Long Truncated BSR format (variable size).
Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE consists of:
\- Pre-emptive BSR format (variable size).
The BSR formats are identified by MAC subheaders with LCIDs as specified in
Table 6.2.1-2.
The Pre-emptive BSR format is identified by MAC subheaders with eLCID as
specified in Table 6.2.1-2b.
The fields in the BSR MAC CE are defined as follows:
\- LCG ID: The Logical Channel Group ID field identifies the group of logical
channel(s) whose buffer status is being reported. The length of the field is 3
bits;
\- LCG~i~: For the Long BSR format and Pre-emptive BSR format, this field
indicates the presence of the Buffer Size field for the logical channel group
i. The LCG~i~ field set to 1 indicates that the Buffer Size field for the
logical channel group I is reported. The LCG~i~ field set to 0 indicates that
the Buffer Size field for the logical channel group i is not reported. For the
Long Truncated BSR format, this field indicates whether logical channel group
i has data available. The LCG~i~ field set to 1 indicates that logical channel
group i has data available. The LCG~i~ field set to 0 indicates that logical
channel group i does not have data available;
\- Buffer Size: The Buffer Size field identifies the total amount of data
available according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [3]
and 38.323 [4] across all logical channels of a logical channel group after
the MAC PDU has been built (i.e. after the logical channel prioritization
procedure, which may result the value of the Buffer Size field to zero). The
amount of data is indicated in number of bytes. The size of the RLC headers
and MAC subheaders are not considered in the buffer size computation. The
length of this field for the Short BSR format and the Short Truncated BSR
format is 5 bits. The length of this field for the Long BSR format and the
Long Truncated BSR format is 8 bits. The values for the 5-bit and 8-bit Buffer
Size fields are shown in Tables 6.1.3.1-1 and 6.1.3.1-2, respectively. For the
Long BSR format and the Long Truncated BSR format, the Buffer Size fields are
included in ascending order based on the LCG~i~. For the Long Truncated BSR
format the number of Buffer Size fields included is maximised, while not
exceeding the number of padding bits. For the Pre-emptive BSR format, the
Buffer Size field identifies the total amount of the data expected to arrive
at the IAB-MT of the node where the Pre-emptive BSR is triggered and does not
include the volume of data currently available in the IAB-MT. Pre-emptive BSR
format is identical to the Long BSR format.
NOTE 1: For the Pre-emptive BSR, if configured, the LCGs to be reported, the
expected data volume calculation, the exact time to report Pre-emptive BSR and
the associated LCH are left to implementation.
NOTE 2: The mapping of LCGs between the ingress and egress links of an IAB
node for purposes of determining expected change in occupancy of IAB-MT
buffers (to be reported as Pre-emptive BSR) is left to implementation.
NOTE 3: The number of the Buffer Size fields in the Long BSR and Long
Truncated BSR format can be zero.

#### 6.1.3.2 C-RNTI MAC CE
The C-RNTI MAC CE is identified by MAC subheader with LCID as specified in
Table 6.2.1-2.
It has a fixed size and consists of a single field defined as follows (Figure
6.1.3.2-1):

#### 6.1.3.9 Multiple Entry PHR MAC CE
The Multiple Entry PHR MAC CE is identified by a MAC subheader with LCID as
specified in Table 6.2.1-2.
It has a variable size, and includes the bitmap, a Type 2 PH field and an
octet containing the associated P~CMAX,f,c~ field (if reported) for SpCell of
the other MAC entity, a Type 1 PH field and an octet containing the associated
P~CMAX,f,c~ field (if reported) for the PCell. It further includes, in
ascending order based on the _ServCellIndex_ , one or multiple of Type X PH
fields and octets containing the associated P~CMAX,f,c~ fields (if reported)
for Serving Cells other than PCell indicated in the bitmap. X is either 1 or 3
according to TS 38.213 [6] and TS 36.213 [17].
The presence of Type 2 PH field for SpCell of the other MAC entity is
configured by _phr-Type2OtherCell_ with value _true_.
A single octet bitmap is used for indicating the presence of PH per Serving
Cell when the highest _ServCellIndex_ of Serving Cell with configured uplink
is less than 8, otherwise four octets are used.
The MAC entity determines whether PH value for an activated Serving Cell is
based on real transmission or a reference format by considering the configured
grant(s) and downlink control information which has been received until and
including the PDCCH occasion in which the first UL grant for a new
transmission that can accommodate the MAC CE for PHR as a result of LCP as
defined in clause 5.4.3.1 is received since a PHR has been triggered if the
PHR MAC CE is reported on an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or until the
first uplink symbol of PUSCH transmission minus PUSCH preparation time as
defined in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] if the PHR MAC CE is reported on a
configured grant.
For a band combination in which the UE does not support dynamic power sharing,
the UE may omit the octets containing Power Headroom field and P~CMAX,f,c~
field for Serving Cells in the other MAC entity except for the PCell in the
other MAC entity and the reported values of Power Headroom and P~CMAX,f,c~ for
the PCell are up to UE implementation.
The PHR MAC CEs are defined as follows:
\- C~i~: This field indicates the presence of a PH field for the Serving Cell
with _ServCellIndex_ i as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The C~i~ field set to 1
indicates that a PH field for the Serving Cell with _ServCellIndex_ i is
reported. The C~i~ field set to 0 indicates that a PH field for the Serving
Cell with _ServCellIndex_ i is not reported;
\- R: Reserved bit, set to 0;
\- V: This field indicates if the PH value is based on a real transmission or
a reference format. For Type 1 PH, the V field set to 0 indicates real
transmission on PUSCH and the V field set to 1 indicates that a PUSCH
reference format is used. For Type 2 PH, the V field set to 0 indicates real
transmission on PUCCH and the V field set to 1 indicates that a PUCCH
reference format is used. For Type 3 PH, the V field set to 0 indicates real
transmission on SRS and the V field set to 1 indicates that an SRS reference
format is used. Furthermore, for Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 PH, the V field
set to 0 indicates the presence of the octet containing the associated
P~CMAX,f,c~ field and the MPE field, and the V field set to 1 indicates that
the octet containing the associated P~CMAX,f,c~ field and the MPE field is
omitted;
\- Power Headroom (PH): This field indicates the power headroom level. The
length of the field is 6 bits. The reported PH and the corresponding power
headroom levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-1 (the corresponding measured
values in dB for the NR Serving Cell are specified in TS 38.133 [11] while the
corresponding measured values in dB for the E-UTRA Serving Cell are specified
in TS 36.133 [12]);
\- P: If _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is configured and the Serving Cell operates on
FR2, the MAC entity shall set this field to 0 if the applied P-MPR value, to
meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15], is less than P-MPR_00
as specified in TS 38.133 [11] and to 1 otherwise. If _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is
not configured or the Serving Cell operates on FR1, this field indicates
whether power backoff is applied due to power management (as allowed by
P-MPR~c~ as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3
[16]). The MAC entity shall set the P field to 1 if the corresponding
P~CMAX,f,c~ field would have had a different value if no power backoff due to
power management had been applied;
\- P~CMAX,f,c~: If present, this field indicates the P~CMAX,f,c~ (as specified
in TS 38.213 [6]) for the NR Serving Cell and the P~CMAX,c~ or PÌƒ~CMAX,c~ (as
specified in TS 36.213 [17]) for the E-UTRA Serving Cell used for calculation
of the preceding PH field. The reported P~CMAX,f,c~ and the corresponding
nominal UE transmit power levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-2 (the
corresponding measured values in dBm for the NR Serving Cell are specified in
TS 38.133 [11] while the corresponding measured values in dBm for the E-UTRA
Serving Cell are specified in TS 36.133 [12]);
