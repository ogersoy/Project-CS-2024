# Introduction
The basic multiple access scheme for NR is orthogonal for both downlink and
uplink data transmissions, e.g., time and frequency physical resources of
different users are not overlapped. On the other hand, non-orthogonal
multiple-access schemes recently gained wide interest.
Non-orthogonal transmission can be applied to both grant-based and grant-free
transmission. The benefits of non-orthogonal multiple access, particularly
when enabling grant-free transmission, may encompass a variety of use cases or
deployment scenarios, including eMBB, URLLC, mMTC etc. In RRC_CONNECTED state,
it saves the scheduling request procedure assuming UE is already uplink
synchronized. In RRC_INACTIVE state, data can be transmitted even without RACH
procedure or with 2-step RACH. The saving of the signalling naturally also
saves UE\'s power consumption, reduces latency and increases system capacity.
# 1 Scope

# 5 Uplink NOMA transmission side processing
NOMA transmitter processing can be summarized as shown in the figure below,
where the blocks in black and white reuse the current NR design, while new
blocks with specification impact are highlighted in green. It should be noted
that, the initialization seed for the legacy bit-scrambling sequence
generation can be updated which may involve certain specification impact.

Figure 5.1: General structure of NOMA transmitter processing
NOMA transmission side processing is characterized by multiple access (MA)
signature and auxiliary features. MA signature is typically used to
differentiate users. In this subclause, MA signatures are described more from
the perspective of traffic data.
## 5.1 Candidate MA signatures
### 5.1.1 Bit level processing based
The bit-level processing for NOMA achieves the user separation by randomizing
the signals from other users [6][7][10][12][13][18][22][32][35]. There are two
ways of randomization, i.e. scrambling or interleaving.
**_UE-specific bit-level scrambling:_**
Bit-level scrambling based NOMA schemes such as LCRS [25] and NCMA [24]
utilize the same transmitter processing procedure as Rel-15 NR PUSCH including
channel encoding, rate matching, bit-level scrambling and then modulator, as
shown in Figure 5.1-1.
Bit-level scrambling function defined in TS 38.211 Subclause 6.3.1.1 [34] can
be the MA signature as it is defined in a UE-specific manner.
{width="6.26875in" height="0.7090277777777778in"}
Figure 5.1‑1: Transmitter procedure for bit-level processing (modules with
dash blocks are optional).
**_UE-specific bit-level interleaving:_**
Bit-level interleaving based NOMA schemes such as IDMA [18][22][29] and IGMA
[26][35] share the same transmitter processing at bit-level as in Figure
5.1-1. UE-specific interleaving pattern can be the MA signature. For example,
UE specific interleaver based on NR LDPC block interleaver can replace the
common block interleaver in rate matching module, i.e. the starting position
of reading could be cyclically shifted with different offsets for different
UEs as shown in Figure 5.1-2 [26][30].
{width="2.7909722222222224in" height="0.9701388888888889in"}
Figure 5.1-2: UE specific block interleaver design
Another example for the realization of user-specific interleaving is depicted
in Figure 5.1-3, where a user-specific cyclic shift is introduced, allowing
the same user-independent interleaving operation to be executed by _K_ users.
The combination of user-specific cyclic shift and non-user-specific
interleaving is equivalent to user-specific interleaving [36].
{width="4.283333333333333in" height="1.7465277777777777in"}
Figure 5.1-3: An example of user specific interleaving.
### 5.1.2 Symbol level processing
MA signatures applied at symbol level can have the following types: UE-
specific spreading with NR legacy modulation, UE-specific spreading with
modified modulation, scrambling, and UE-specific interleaving with zero-
padding.
**_UE-specific symbol-level spreading with NR legacy modulation._**
Symbol-level spreading sequences of low cross-correlation or low density are a
type of MA signature and can be used to separate different users
[3][4][5][8][9][11][14][15][27][33]. Symbols may be drawn from BPSK [21],
QPSK, or higher order QAM constellations to adjust spectral efficiency. For
BPSK, e.g., {(1+j)/sqrt(2), (-1-j)/sqrt(2)}, it can be considered for CP-OFDM
waveform. The transmitter processing procedure can be found in Figure 5.1-4.
{width="6.447916666666667in" height="0.5743055555555555in"}
Figure 5.1-4: Transmitter procedure for symbol-level spreading with NR legacy
modulation
Various designs of symbol-level spreading sequences are proposed for NOMA.
**1) WBE sequences**
> In Welch bound equality (WBE) based spreading schemes such as WSMA [17] and
> RSMA [31], the design metric for the signature vectors is the total squared
> cross-correlation${T_{c} \triangleq
> \sum_{i,j}^{}{\mathbf{|s}_{i}^{H}\mathbf{s}_{j}|}}^{2}$. The lower bound on
> the total squared cross-correlation of any set of _K_ vectors of length _N_
> , is $K^{2}/N \leq T_{c}$. The WBE sequences are designed to meet the bound
> on the total squared cross-correlations of the vector set _with equality_
> $B_{\text{Welch}} \triangleq K^{2}/N$. Some examples of sequence generation
> method for the construction of WBE spreading sequences can be found in
> _Annex A.4.1_ and _Annex A.4.2_.
**2) Complex-valued sequences with quantized elements**
> The elements of spreading sequences can be drawn from quantized
> constellations as seen in MUSA [16]. Examples of QPSK and 9-QAM
> constellations are illustrated in Figure 5.1-5. The total numbers of
> sequences are 4 _^N^_ and 9 _^N^_ , respectively where _N_ is the spreading
> factor. Example subsets of such sequences can be found in _Annex A.4.3_.

(a) 9-QAM (b) QPSK
Figure 5.1-5: Constellation of complex-valued spreading sequence.
**3) ETF/Grassmannian sequences**
A stricter Welch-bound equality is to minimize the maximum value of the cross-
correlations among any of the two sequences, which is known as Equiangular
Tight Frames (ETF) [17] or Grassmannian sequences, as seen in NCMA [24].
a) Grassmannian Sequence
i) Each complex spreading sequence of this sequence set is generated by
Grassmannian line packing problem. Let the Grassmannian sequence set be
defined by
$\mathbf{G} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{s}^{\mathbf{(1)}} & \ldots &
\mathbf{s}^{\mathbf{(}\mathbf{K}\mathbf{)}} \ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
s_{1}^{(1)} & \ldots & s_{1}^{(K)} \ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \ s_{N}^{(1)} &
\ldots & s_{N}^{(K)} \ \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{,\ G\
\subset}\mathbf{C}^{\mathbf{N}\mathbf{\times}\mathbf{K}}$,
where _N_ is the spreading factor and _K_ is the superposition factor, the
sequence design problem can be posed as maximizing the minimum chordal
distance between sequence pairs:
$\underset{\mathbf{G}}{\mathbf{\min}}\left( \underset{\mathbf{1} \leq

Note:
In the figures in this subclause, SF denotes for $N_{\text{sf}}$, N denotes
for $N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{adj}}$, and Niter denotes for
$N_{\text{iter}}^{\text{IC}}$ as used in Table 6.2-1.
For MMSE hard IC receiver, Source 1 [64] and Source 5 [68] assume
$N_{\text{RE}}^{adj,SINR}$ = 144, Source 2 [65] assumes
$N_{\text{RE}}^{adj,SINR}$ = 4. Source 3 [66] assumes
$N_{\text{RE}}^{adj,SINR}$= 48.
For complexity of MMSE-IRC receiver provided by Source 1, the MMSE is
implemented in joint code and spatial domain, and
$N_{\text{iter}}^{\text{IC}}$ is 1.
The impact of $N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{adj}}$ on the BLER performance for MMSE
hard IC receiver is analysed by Source 1 [64], Source 2 [65], Source 4 [69],
and in [70] and [71]. Details can be found in Annex A.6.

# 7 Procedures related to NOMA
UL data transmission and detection procedures of Rel-15 configured grant is
the starting point for NOMA study. Synchronous UL data transmission should be
the starting point.
This study also considers the asynchronous transmission, where timing offset
is within [0, y] as starting point. y has two values at least for the purpose
of evaluation: 1) NCP/2; 2) 1.5*NCP. Channel structure consisting of preamble
and data can be considered for supporting the asynchronous transmission, where
reusing Rel-15 NR preamble design can be considered as the starting point.
Additional components can be included if necessary, e.g., the UL channel for
assisting the UE detection or GP.
# 8 Link level performance evaluation
## 8.1 Performance and implementation related metrics
Performance metrics are at least:
\- BLER vs. per UE SNR at a given pair of {per UE SE, # of UEs}
\- Sum throughput vs. SNR at given BLER level, for a given pair of {per UE SE,
# of UEs}
\- MCL
Implementation related metrics are at least:
\- PAPR/cubic metric
\- RX complexity and processing latency
## 8.2 Evaluation results
Three templates were agreed to capture the link level simulation results of
NOMA. In particular, Template 1 was formatted with the purpose to provide more
detailed description of link performance, e.g., in terms of BLER vs. SNR
curves. Total of 35 cases, together with the number of UEs to be simulated,
are defined in Template 1. As complementary, more exhaustive combinations of
scenarios, TBS, channel model, waveform, equal/unequal SNR, etc. can be found
in Template 2 where a required SNR value for certain target BLER would be
filled in for each case, instead of a BLER curve. Template 3 is used to
collect PAPR statistics of different schemes/MA signatures.
### 8.2.1 Case-by-case evaluations on BLER vs. SNR
The 35 cases collected for the evaluation of BLER vs. SNR at link level are
listed in Table 8.2-1.

results under unequal SNR distributions:
\- For Case 6 with 6 or 12 UEs, ideal channel estimation, unequal SNR (SNR
offset is within +/-3dB), TO is within [0, 0.5*NCP], and non-zero FO, the LLS
results for simulated schemes show a similar performance for most of curves
provided, at target BLER = 0.1, with appropriate configurations.
\- For Case 8 with 12 or 24 UEs, ideal channel estimation, unequal SNR (SNR

results for simulated schemes show a similar performance for most of curves
provided, at target BLER = 0.1, with appropriate configurations.
\- For Case 9 with 6 or 12 UEs, ideal channel estimation, unequal SNR (SNR

Observations:
\- For LLS in the simulated cases 32/33/34/35 with ideal channel estimation,
under unequal SNR, and fixed MA signature allocation, as long as the
simulation configuration is appropriate, the performance difference between
NOMA schemes/MA signatures is small, even when different receiver types are
used.

Observations:
\- For case 11 with realistic channel estimation and random selection with
potential MA signature collision (timing offset is within [0, 1.5*NCP], non-
zero FO, and SNR offset is within +/-3dB)
\- When the TBS is small (i.e. 20 bytes), with 6 simultaneous activated UEs,
based on the realistic UE detection by using 2-slot transmission time (e.g.,
50% overhead for legacy preamble as the RS, without DMRS, preamble and data
have the same BW, without assuming guard-band, with the pool size of 48 and
64), there is around 3.5 dB performance loss at 10% BLER, compared to random
activation with no DMRS/MA signature collision and timing offset is within [0,
0.5*NCP] and 1-slot transmission.
Note: this observation is based on single company\'s results
\- When the TBS is small (i.e. 20 bytes), 10% BLER cannot be achieved for 4
and 6 UEs, with random selection (DMRS overhead of 2/7 for pool size 24), for
both realistic and ideal UE detection, with 1-slot transmission time.
\- When the TBS is small (i.e. 20 bytes), with random activation (with
realistic UE detection, DMRS overhead of 2/7 for pool size 24, without DMRS/MA
signature collision) of 1-slot transmission, the performance degradation at
10% BLER for 4, 6 and 8 UEs is about 1 dB compared to random activation
without timing offset (with realistic UE detection, DMRS overhead of 1/7 for
pool size 24, without DMRS/MA signature collision)
\- Note: this observation is based on single company\'s results
### 8.2.2 Observations from the LLS results
Some general observations can be drawn from the simulated cases:
\- For LLS in mMTC/eMBB/URLLC scenarios with ideal channel estimation, equal
SNR, zero TO/FO and fixed MA signature allocation
\- For low TBS (per UE SE is less than 0.15 bps/Hz and total SE is less than
1.8 bps/Hz), as long as the simulation configuration, e.g., reasonable code
rate, is appropriate, the performance difference between NOMA schemes/MA
signatures is small, even when different receiver types are used.
\- For LLS in the simulated case 15/17/19/20/26/27 with ideal channel
estimation, equal SNR, zero TO/FO and fixed MA signature allocation
\- For medium to high TBS (per UE SE is within [0.3, 0.55] bps/Hz, and total
SE is less than 3.6 bps/Hz), as long as the simulation configuration, e.g.,
reasonable code rate, is appropriate, the performance difference between NOMA
schemes/MA signatures is small.
\- Results with lower code rate (e.g. LDPC coding rate \
0.5).
By comparing the evaluation results between realistic channel estimation and
ideal channel estimation based on cases 1\~5 and 14\~20, the following
observations are made.
\- For LLS with realistic channel estimation, equal SNR distribution, zero
TO/FO and fixed MA signature allocation
\- Up to 2\~4 dB performance degradation is observed compared to ideal channel
estimation for mMTC/eMBB scenario.
\- Up to 5 dB performance degradation is observed compared to ideal channel
estimation for URLLC scenario.
\- Different performance degradation levels may be due to different channel
estimation algorithm and DMRS extension methods.
\- The lower the SNR operation point is, the larger the performance
degradation due to realistic CE can be observed
\- Higher number of UEs have larger performance degradation than lower number
of UEs under the same channel condition and the same TBS for each individual
case.
# 9 System level performance evaluation
## 9.1 Performance metrics
The following performance metrics are used for NOMA study from system level
point of view.
**1) mMTC**
Evaluation of NOMA in mMTC scenario should focus on normal coverage.
\- The performance metrics for mMTC include the following:
\- Higher layer packet drop rate (PDR) vs. offered load. The definition of PDR
is FFS:
\- Offered load can be at least
\- Higher layer packet arrival rate (PAR) per cell for massive connectivity
\- CDF of packet drop rate per UE is optional.
\- CDF of transmission latency is optional.
\- CDF of the inter-cell interference-over-thermal (IOT) is optional.
\- Note: companies are encouraged to provide the curve of resource utilization
(RU) vs. offered load.
_\- The baseline for system-level performance comparison is_
\- UL transmission with configured grant type 1 or type 2 in Rel.15 NR.
\- Companies to report the link adaptation assumptions, if any.
\- The DMRS collision, if any, should be taken into account.
_\- For the evaluation of NOMA schemes_
\- UL transmission with configured grant type 1 or type 2 in Rel.15 NR as
staring point
\- Companies to report the link adaptation assumptions, if any.
\- The MA signature (including DMRS) is semi-statically configured.
\- The MA signature collision, if any, should be taken into account.
\- FFS: to demonstrate the potential NOMA gain under grant-free transmission
with random selection of MA signatures, where collision of MA signature should
be considered.
\- The grant-free definition follows NR SI.
**2) URLLC**
\- The performance metrics for URLLC include at least the following:
\- Percentage of users satisfying reliability and latency requirements vs.
packet arrival rate (PAR).
\- CDF of reliability per UE is optional.
\- CDF of the inter-cell interference-over-thermal (IOT) is optional.
\- Note: companies are encouraged to provide the curve of resource utilization
(RU) vs. PAR.
\- The baseline for performance comparison is UL transmission without dynamic
link adaptation (i.e., using configured grant type 1 or type 2)
_\- Simplified system-level evaluations can be used for URLLC scenario as
detailed as follows:_
\- Mean BLER of a UE can be used to represent the reliability of the UE.
\- Note: Further considerations can be reviewed, e.g. the deviation of BLER
about the mean BLER.
**3) eMBB**
\- The performance metrics for eMBB include the following:
\- Metric 1: Higher layer packet drop rate (PDR) vs. offered load. The
definition of PDR is FFS:
\- Offered load can be at least
\- Higher layer packet arrival rate (PAR) per cell
\- CDF of packet drop rate per UE is optional.
\- CDF of transmission latency is optional.
\- CDF of the inter-cell interference-over-thermal (IOT) is optional.
\- Note: companies are encouraged to provide the curve of resource utilization
(RU) vs. offered load.
\- Metric 2: UPT vs. offered load.
\- CDF of the inter-cell interference-over-thermal (IOT) is optional.
\- CDF of UE perceived throughput is optional
\- FFS whether or not to have signalling overhead as one performance metric.
_\- The baseline for system-level performance comparison can be_
\- Configured grant type 1 or type 2 in Rel.15 NR.
\- The DMRS collision, if any, should be taken into account.
\- Companies to report the link adaptation assumptions, if any.
\- UL transmission with dynamic grant
\- Details to be reported.
\- The signalling overhead should be reported.
_\- For the evaluation of NOMA schemes_
\- Configured grant type 1 or type 2 in Rel.15 NR.
\- The MA signature (including DMRS) is semi-statically configured.
\- The MA signature collision, if any, should be taken into account.
\- Companies to report the link adaptation assumptions, if any.
\- UL transmission with dynamic grant
\- Details to be reported.
\- The signalling overhead should be reported.
\- FFS: to demonstrate the potential NOMA gain under grant-free transmission
with random selection of MA signatures, where collision of MA signature should
be considered.
\- The grant-free definition follows NR SI.
## 9.2 Evaluation results
### 9.2.1 Simulation results for mMTC
For mMTC scenario, under the system-level evaluation assumptions as detailed
in Table 9.2-1, relative to the evaluated OFDM waveform (using configured
grant with multiple users in the same time and frequency resources) with MMSE-
IRC or advanced receiver, the evaluated NOMA schemes with configured grant
(without DMRS collision) can provide the results in Table 9.2-1:
\- In some simulated cases,
\- time and frequency resource configuration per UE for the baseline is
different from that per UE for evaluated NOMA schemes;
\- Receivers used for the baseline and for the evaluated NOMA schemes are in
some cases different and in other cases the same.
\- Resource utilization of simulated NOMA schemes is 3 to 5 times than
baseline.
\- In some other simulated cases,
\- the time and frequency resource configuration per UE for the baseline is
the same as that per UE for the evaluated NOMA scheme
\- the same type of receiver is assumed for the baseline and the evaluated
NOMA schemes
\- Resource utilization of simulated NOMA schemes is comparable to baseline.
\- Different L2S mappings are used.
\- Within source 1, the ideal assumptions of inter-cell interference
covariance matrix (non-block diagonal and genie-known to the receiver) is
assumed.
\- Different baselines, different amount of optimization, and different choice
of receiver types are used within different sources

0.5).
\- Based simulations of some cases (i.e., cases 1\~5, cases 14\~20), for LLS
with realistic channel estimation, equal SNR distribution, zero TO/FO and
fixed MA signature allocation, it is observed that
\- Up to 2\~4 dB performance degradation is observed compared to ideal channel
estimation for mMTC/eMBB scenario.
\- Up to 5 dB performance degradation is observed compared to ideal channel
estimation for URLLC scenario.
\- Different performance degradation levels may be due to different channel
estimation algorithm and DMRS extension methods.
\- The lower the SNR operation point is, the larger the performance
degradation due to realistic CE can be observed
\- Higher number of UEs have larger performance degradation than lower number
of UEs under the same channel condition and the same TBS for each individual
case.
\- Based simulations of some cases (i.e., 32/33/34/35) with larger standard
deviation of SNR difference, for LLS with ideal channel estimation, under
unequal SNR, and fixed MA signature allocation, it is observed that as long as
the simulation configuration is appropriate, the performance difference
between NOMA schemes/MA signatures is small, even when different receiver
types are used
\- Performance loss of 1.1-3.2 dB can be observed with real channel estimation
in multipath, where the losses are greater for the larger number of UEs or
with greater SNR variation with for link level simulations.
\- For the case with realistic channel estimation and random selection with
potential MA signature collision (timing offset is within [0, 1.5*NCP], non-
zero FO, and SNR offset is within +/-3dB)
\- When the TBS is small (i.e. 20 bytes), with 6 simultaneous activated UEs,
based on the realistic UE detection by using 2-slot transmission time (e.g.,
50% overhead for legacy preamble as the RS, without DMRS, preamble and data
have the same BW, without assuming guard-band, with the pool size of 48 and
64), there is around 3.5 dB performance loss at 10% BLER, compared to random
activation with no DMRS/MA signature collision and timing offset is within [0,
0.5*NCP] and 1-slot transmission.
Note: this observation is based on single company\'s results
\- When the TBS is small (i.e. 20 bytes), 10% BLER cannot be achieved for 4
and 6 UEs, with random selection (DMRS overhead of 2/7 for pool size 24), for
both realistic and ideal UE detection, with 1-slot transmission time.
\- When the TBS is small (i.e. 20 bytes), with random activation (with
realistic UE detection, DMRS overhead of 2/7 for pool size 24, without DMRS/MA
signature collision) of 1-slot transmission, the performance degradation at
10% BLER for 4, 6 and 8 UEs is about 1 dB compared to random activation
without timing offset (with realistic UE detection, DMRS overhead of 1/7 for
pool size 24, without DMRS/MA signature collision)
Note: this observation is based on single company\'s results
For system level performance evaluation of configured grant transmission
(without DMRS collision and where different baselines, different amount of
optimization, and different choice of receiver types are used by companies.

## A.2 Link-to-system modelling
Link-to-system modelling, also known as PHY abstraction, should reflect the
key signal processing at the receiver, such as detection, channel decoding,
channel estimation, etc. For NOMA study, multi-user link level simulations are
needed to verify the validity of the PHY abstraction. The link-to-system
modelling should also take into account of potential MA signature collision.
Alternatively, system-level evaluation can be based on using an embedded link-
level receiver model. In such an approach, the system-level portion of the
simulator generates the user traffic, corresponding channel model parameters,
assigns users to cells, etc. The link level portion of the simulator is used
for the explicit modeling of the actual packet transmission and reception for
the generated interference environment.
### A.2.1 Link-to-system mapping for MMSE-Hard IC receiver
**_1) Basic PHY abstraction method_**
PHY abstraction method for MMSE-Hard IC receiver is shown in Figure 2.1-1. The
interference cancellation can be conducted successively (SIC), in parallel
(PIC), or with hybrid process (HIC). The modeling adopts an iterative
processing procedure and includes three steps, which are described as below.

**Step 1: Calculation of** **post-processing (pp)-SINR**
Assuming that _N_ users share the same resource element group with the
spreading factor of _L_ , the received signal with _R_ antenna ports can be
written as
_(A._ 2.1-_1)_
where _y~k\ ~_ with the size of is the received symbol vector on the _k_ ^th^
resource element group, is a vector of transmitted symbols. denotes the
effective channel of the _i^th^_ user, taking into account the transmitted
power _P~k,i~,_ the channel response of each receive antenna _h~k,i,r\ ~_ and
the _L*1_ spreading sequence _s~i~_ , as . _n~k\ ~_ is the additive white
Gaussian noise plus inter-cell interferences, with the power of , and the
covariance matrix of $R_{n_{k}n_{k}}$. For each of the _i_ ^th^ target user,
the received signal in (A.2.1-1) can be rewritten as
_(A._ 2.1-_2)_
where represents the noise plus intra-cell and inter-cell interferences
experienced by the _i_ ^th^ user. The weight of linear MMSE receiver is then
calculated as
(A.2.1-3)
with the covariance of _z~i~_
$\mathbf{R}_{\mathbf{z,i}}\mathbf{=}\sum_{\mathbf{m = 1,m \neq
i}}^{\mathbf{N}}{{\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{\mathbf{k,m}}{\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{\mathbf{k,m}}^{\mathbf{*}}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{R}_{\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{k}}}$
(A.2.1-4)
where (.)* denotes Hermitian transpose and $R_{n_{k}n_{k}}$is the covariance
matrix of noise plus inter-cell interference. It should be noticed that the
real estimated channel should be used in (A.2.1-3), as described in (A.2.1-7).
The corresponding pp-SINR of the _i_ ^th^ user can be calculated as
(A.2.1-5)
The _j_ ^th^ user\'s data with the highest averaged pp-SINR over _K_ resource
elements, i.e., will be treated in each loop of the MMSE-SIC receiver.
Therefore, the analytical SINR mapping in SLS starts from the _j_ ^th^ user.
**Step 2:** **Effective SINR mapping**
As link level curves are normally generated assuming frequency flat channel at
given SINR, an effective SINR, $\text{SINR}^{\text{eff}}$ is required to
accurately map SINR at system level onto the link level curves to determine
the BLER, when the actual channel at system level is frequency selective.
Assuming that the _j_ ^th^ user has the highest pp-SINR. The effective SINR is
calculated as
(A.2.1-6)
where _K_ is the number of modulation symbols (or resource elements) in a code
block, is a non-linear invertible function that defines Received Bit Mutual
Information Rate (RBIR). The block error rate value of the _j_ ^th^ user is
determined by looking up the BLER vs. SNR tables for AWGN channel, with the
input of the effective SINR.
**Step 3:** **Interference cancellation**
Since the BLER of the user with highest pp-SINR has been calculated, a random
variable _X_ \~Uniform [0 1] is generated to decide whether the user\'s data
is decoded correctly or not. If the user\'s data is considered as correctly
decoded, then the interference cancellation procedure is performed.
**_2) Modeling for realistic channel estimation_**
In the case with realistic channel estimation, channel estimation error can be
modelled for link-to-system mapping.
Channel estimation error, denoted as, is the difference between the realistic
channel estimation (RCE) and the ideal channel estimation (ICE). It can be
modelled as a Gaussian distributed random variable with the mean value of 0
and the variance as .
$H_{R} = H + \mathrm{\Delta}H \bullet \left| H \right|$ (A.2.1-7)
$\sigma_{e}^{2} = \frac{1}{{a \bullet N}_{s} \bullet SNR}$ (A.2.1-8)
In Eq. (A.2.1-7), SNR is the instantaneous received SNR (per RE DMRS power
divided by per RE noise power plus DMRS contamination from other cell on the
active transmission bandwidth of the UE) and can be time-varying in fading
channels. _N~s~_ is the total number of DMRS samples used for estimating a
channel coefficient, which is equal to 4 for the NR DMRS design. And _a_ is a
scaling factor that takes into account the effect of interpolation and
smoothing for different channel coefficients, which can be tuned differently
for different fading channel and channel estimation algorithms.
Figure A.2.1-2 shows the channel estimation error validation results in a
single-user simulation case, for different channel conditions and DMRS types,
where the solid curves show the statistics of collected normalized channel
estimation error which is calculated is $\frac{\left| H_{R} - H
\right|^{2}}{\left| H \right|^{2}}$. It can be observed that the variance
predicted by the error model matches well the variance of the actual
estimation.

Figure A.2.1-2: Channel estimation error model (TDL-C 300ns)
So for PHY abstraction for realistic channel estimation, we can replace the
channel by _H~R~_ in Eq. (A.2.1-7), where the channel estimation error is
modelled based on Eq. (A.2.1-8). Then we can use _H~R~_ to calculate the
weight of the linear MMSE receiver with Eq. (A.2.1-3). Finally the
corresponding pp-SINR can be calculated based on Eq. (A.2.1-5), where ideal
channel is still used for the target signal and the interfering signal.
The _H~R~_ should also be used in the interference cancellation(IC) procedure
to model the non-perfect IC, which is described as follows assuming a receiver
using codeword IC:
_If the j^th^ user\'s data is correctly decoded, channel estimation error of
jth user is used as residual interference,_ _where H~R,j~ and H~I~,~j~ refers
the modelled realistic channel estimation and the ideal channel_ _estimation
value of jth user, respectively, and is modelled based on Eq. (A.2.1-8)._
**_3) Validation results_**
In Figure 2.1-4, BLER performances of DMRS-based realistic channel estimation
(RCE) are compared with the BLERs of above PHY abstraction with fixed MA
signature allocation. The results indicate that the proposed PHY abstraction
can closely match the performance of actual MMSE-SIC receiver with realistic
channel estimation. For the number of UE larger than 12, larger FDM comb is
applied for DMRS extension.

Figure A.2.1-4: BLER of realistic channel estimation (RCE) vs BLER of PHY
abstraction for MMSE-SIC receiver
### A.2.2 Link-to-system mapping for ESE-SISO receiver
**_1) PHY abstraction method_**
The effective SNR mapping (ESM) PHY abstraction is used in SLS. Generally, for
ESM, the effective SNR is calculated as
$\text{SNR}_{\text{eff}} = f^{- 1}(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 0}^{N -
1}{f(SINR_{n})})$ (A.2.2-1)
where $N$ is the symbol block size, $\text{SIN}R_{n}$ is the SINR for the _n_
-th sub-carrier, $\text{SNR}_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective SNR for the entire
block and function $f( \bullet )$ is an invertible function. Based on this
effective SNR, the corresponding BLER can be obtained based on SNR-BLER
mapping table under AWGN channel for specific MCS.
To facilitate the PHY abstraction and avoid receiver modeling, an
approximation approach is applied and is summarized as follows:
**_Step 1_** : Calculate the upper bound post-processing SINR.
For non-orthogonal multiple access, the optimal performance can be achieved if
the signals from multiple UEs can be separated completely. In this sense, the
post-processing SINR of PIC detector is regarded as upper bound. If per-RE
power of transmitted signal is normalized to 1, the post-processing SINR after
PIC detection for the _n_ -th sub-carrier of the _k_ -th UE is expressed as
$\text{SINR}_{k,n}^{\text{PIC}} = \frac{\left| \mathbf{h}_{k,n}
\right|^{2}}{\sigma^{2} + I_{n}}\ $(A.2.2-2)
where $\mathbf{h}_{k,n}$ denotes the frequency domain channel coefficient
vector of the _n_ -th sub-carrier of the _k_ -th UE, $\sigma^{2}$ denotes the
noise power and $I_{n}$ denotes the power of inter-cell interference on the
_n_ -th sub-carrier.
**_Step 2_** : Approximate the real post-processing SINR based the upper
bound.
Although by using advanced receiver, such as chip-by-chip MAP detector, multi-
user interference can be mitigated or even eliminated, there still will be
some performance degradation, especially when the number of serviced UEs is
large. A scaling factor $\beta$ is used to emulate this performance
degradation. Denote $C_{\text{PIC}}^{k,n} = \log_{2}{(1 +
\text{SINR}_{k,n}^{\text{PIC}})}$ as the capacity for PIC detector and for
non-orthogonal multiple access, the achievable capacity is a scaled version
which is expressed as follows
$C_{\text{NoMA}}^{k,n} = \log_{2}{(1 + \ SINR_{k,n})} = \beta
C_{\text{PIC}}^{k,n}$ (A.2.2-3)
where $\text{SIN}R_{k,n}$ denotes the approximated SINR for _n_ -th sub-
carrier of the _k_ -th UE and based on this scaled capacity,
$\text{SIN}R_{k,n}$ can be calculated as
$\text{SIN}R_{k,n} = \left( 1 + \text{SINR}_{k,n}^{\text{PIC}} \right)^{\beta}
- 1$ (A.2.2-4)
The parameter $\beta$ can describe the capacity loss due to the superposition
of multiple UEs and should be optimized by off-line link level simulations for
different number of UEs under different cases.
**_Step 3_** : Calculate the effective SNR.
The approximated SINR for _n_ -th sub-carrier of the _k_ -th UE obtained in
step 2 is used for the mapping of effective SNR. Several methods can be
applied and the received-bit information rate (RBIR) for SNR mapping is used
due to its simplicity. The effective SNR is expressed as
$\text{SNR}_{\text{eff},k} = RBIR^{- 1}\left(
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n}^{}{\text{RBIR}\left( \text{SIN}R_{k,n},Q \right)} \right)$
(A.2.2-5)
where $\text{SNR}_{\text{eff},k}$ denotes the effective SNR for the _k_ -th UE
and _Q_ denotes the modulation order. The function $\text{RBIR}\left( SNR,Q
\right)$ denotes the RBIR metric given _SNR_ and modulation order _Q_ and
$\text{RBI}R^{- 1}( \bullet )$ is its inverse function given RBIR metric to
find corresponding SNR. The RBIR metric function is pre-calculated off-line
and stored as a look-up table.
**_Step 4_** : Obtain BLER according to the SNR-BLER mapping.
After getting the effective SNR for the _k_ -th UE, the corresponding BLER is
obtained according to the SNR-BLER mapping relationship which is pre-
calculated for given MCS under AWGN channel.
The only parameter that should be optimized is the scaling factor $\beta$ and
the optimization can be completed by solving a minimum mean square error
problem.
**_2) Validation results_**
In Fig. A.2.2-1, the performance comparison between the L2S mapping and LLS
evaluation under ideal channel estimation. mMTC scenario with TDL-C channel is
considered. TBS is set as 40 bytes. As can be observed from Fig. A.2.2-1, by
chosing appropriate $\beta$ value, the performance obtained by L2S mapping
method described above is quite aligned with evaluation results, especially
for high SNR region.

Fig. A.2.2-2 shows the performance comparison between L2S mapping and LLS
results for realistic channel estimation. Similary with Fig. A.2.2-1, mMTC
scenario with TDL-C channel is considered and TBS is set as 40 bytes. For
channel estimation, LMMSE is applied. We can observe that even with larger
number of UEs, the L2S mapping can still match the LLS results with realistic
channel estimation, if proper $\beta$ value is selected.

### A.2.3 Link-to-system mapping for EPA-hybrid IC and MMSE-Hard IC receiver
**_1) PHY abstraction method_**
**Step 1: Calculation of post-processing (pp)-SINR**
Let $N_{r}$ denote the receiver antenna number and $\mathbf{S}_{n}\ $be the
signature of the $n^{\text{th}}$ user. The UL transmission model with _N_ non-
orthogonal users of the _k^th^_ RE group (each group contains $N_{F}$ REs,
where $N_{F}$ is the spreading factor, i.e. for spreading-based NOMA
transmission schemes, $N_{F} > 1$; for other NOMA transmission schemes, $N_{F}
= 1$) is as below:
$\mathbf{y}_{k} = \sum_{n = 1}^{N}{{\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{k,n}x_{k,n}} +
\mathbf{w}_{k} = \mathbf{H}_{k}\mathbf{x}_{k} + \mathbf{w}_{k}\mathbf{,}$
(A.2.3-1)
where $\mathbf{y}_{k}$ is a $N_{F}N_{r} \times 1$ received symbol vector and
$\mathbf{x}_{k}$ is a $N \times 1$ vector of transmitted symbols.
${\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{k,n}$ denotes the effect channel of the
$n^{\text{th}}$ user, taking into account both channel realizations and MA
signatures such that ${\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{k,n}\mathbf{=}\left(
{\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{k,n,1}^{T}\mathbf{,}\mathbf{\
\cdots,}{\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{k,n,N_{r}}^{T} \right)^{\mathbf{T}}\mathbf{,\
}$where ${\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{k,n,r} =$ $\mathbf{h}_{k,n,r} \odot
\mathbf{S}_{n}\ \text{and\ }\mathbf{\odot}$_denotes the component-wise
multiplication_ , and therefore $\mathbf{H}_{k} =
\lbrack{\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{k,1},\
\cdots,{\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{k,N}\rbrack$. $\mathbf{w}_{k}$ represents the
AWGN noise plus inter-cell interference vector with covariance matrix
$\mathbf{R}_{k,ww}$.
The post-processing pp-SINR of the _k^th^_ RE group with perfect interference
cancellation (PIC) bound for the $n^{\text{th}}$ user/data layer is as follows
$\gamma_{k,n}^{\text{PIC}} =
{\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{k,n}^{H}\mathbf{R}_{k,ww}^{-
1}{\widehat{\mathbf{h}}}_{k,n}$ (A.2.3-2)
**Step 2: Effective SINR mapping**
The effective SNR can be obtained by using the pp-SINRs and the curve fitting
parameter α and $\beta$, as following
$\gamma_{n}^{\text{eff}} = f^{- 1}\left( \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k = 1}^{K}{f\left(
\left( \beta\gamma_{k,n}^{\text{PIC}} \right)^{a} \right)} \right)$ **_(_**
A.2.3-**_3)_**
where f(∙) is the model specific function, which can be e.g. Shannon capacity
formula, Received bit mutual information rate (RBIR), etc., and f^-1^(∙) is
its inverse. The curve fitting parameters $\alpha = 10^{\delta}$ represents
the slope bias between multi-user and single-user performance, while $\beta$
represents the SNR loss from the multi-user to single-user performance.
Generally, when the multiplexed UE number is not very large, only the fitting
parameter $\beta$ is required, i.e. $\alpha = 1$. The effective SNR mapping
formula in this case can be rewritten as below, which is the one as agreed and
captured in TR 38.802
$\gamma_{n}^{\text{eff}} = f^{- 1}\left( \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k = 1}^{K}{f\left(
\beta\gamma_{k,n}^{\text{PIC}} \right)} \right)$ **_(_** A.2.3-**_4)_**
The fitting parameter(s) $\alpha_{\text{opt}}$ and $\beta_{\text{opt}}\
$should be chosen to minimize the mean square errors (MSE) between the BLERs
derived from real multi-user UL LLS evaluation and the ones from the PHY
abstraction prediction, under given number of active users and given MCSs.
**Step 3: Lookup AWGN table**
Get the BLER value by looking up the SISO AWGN link performance table with the
derived effective SINR value in step 2 as the input.
**_2) Validation results_**
**Equal SNR**
The BLER performance comparisons between real UL LLS evaluation based on
realistic channel estimation and the BLER based on the described PHY
abstraction method are shown in Figures A.2.3-1 to A.2.3-9 for different NOMA
schemes, TB size and active users. The best fitting parameters
$\delta_{\text{opt}}$, $\beta_{\text{opt}}$, and the corresponding MSE are
given in Tables A.2.3-1,2,3.
It should be noted that, the best fitting parameter(s) $\delta_{\text{opt}}$
and $\beta_{\text{opt}}$ given in Tables A.2.3-1,2,3 may vary with each
company\'s simulation platform. Therefore, each company may optimize the
fitting parameters $\delta_{\text{opt}}$ and $\beta_{\text{opt}}$ based on
their own implementation of the simulation platform.
In addition, it is noted that realistic channel estimation error has already
been considered in the PHY abstraction since the real LLS with realistic
channel estimation is used. Therefore, channel estimation error does not need
to be remodeled in SLS.

Note: other values can be considered.
\- For SLS in mMTC and eMBB, the packet drop rate (PDR) is defined as (the
number of packets in outage) / (the number of packets generated), where a
packet is in outage if this packet failed to be successfully decoded by the
receiver beyond
\- \"packet dropping timer\", or
\- The packet dropping timer can be set to 1 second as the starting point.
\- \"maximum number of HARQ transmission(s)\"
\- 1 and 8 as starting point
\- The HARQ timing is FFS
\- The target higher layer system PDR to be used to evaluate the supported
system capability in terms of high layer system PAR for mMTC or eMBB scenarios
is 1%
\- For URLLC, the target reliability is 99.999% and the target delay
requirement is 1ms (for 60 bytes) and 4ms (for 200bytes) as starting point.
\- The target percentage of users satisfying reliability and latency
requirements to be used to evaluate the supported system capability in terms
per UE PAR for URLLC scenario is 95%
### A.3.2 Traffic model for system-level evaluations
\- For mMTC scenario
\- Packet arrival per UE: Poisson arrival with arrival rate λ;
\- Packet size: 20\~200 bytes Pareto + higher layer protocol overhead of 29
bytes, as defined in TR 45.820 to be the starting point
\- Other packet sizes are not precluded.
_\- For URLLC scenario:_
\- Packet arrival per UE can be based on either option 1 or option 2
\- Option 1: FTP Model 3 with Poisson arrival;
\- Option 2: Periodic packet arrivals.
\- Packet size:
\- Single fixed value per simulation: 60 bytes and 200 bytes
\- higher layer protocol overhead included
_\- For eMBB scenario:_
\- Packet arrival per UE: FTP Model 3 with Poisson arrival
\- Packet size:
\- 50\~ 600 bytes Pareto distribution, with shaping parameter alpha = 1.5 as
starting point.
\- In the case of packet segmentation, use 5 bytes packet segmentation
overhead for each TB

## A.4 MA signature designs for NOMA schemes
### A.4.1 Generation method for the construction of WBE spreading sequences
For a user $k$, let $b_{k}$ be the transmitted symbol that modulates a unit
norm spreading sequence (SS) vector $\mathbf{s}_{k}$. The Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) signal model may be given as $\mathbf{y = Sb + z}$,
where $\mathbf{z}$ is the zero-mean AWGN vector with a covariance matrix
$\mathbf{I}$, i.e., an Identity matrix. the overall SS matrix with an SS
codeword (CW) in each of its columns is $\mathbf{S}$, the transmit symbol
vector is $\mathbf{b}$. The transmit power of each user is set to unity, so
the power control problem is not addressed here. A unit norm receive filter
$\mathbf{f}_{k}$, such as a Matched Filter (MF) or a linear Minimum Mean
Squared Error (MMSE) filter, may be employed by the receiver to obtain an
estimate ${\widehat{b}}_{k}$ for the transmitted symbol $b_{k}$. The post
processed SINR $\gamma_{k}$ of a user $k$ is given as
$\gamma_{k} = \frac{\left| \mathbf{f}_{k}^{H}\mathbf{s}_{k}
\right|^{2}}{\sum_{j = 1,j \neq k}^{K}\left| \mathbf{f}_{k}^{H}\mathbf{s}_{j}
\right|^{2} + \left| \mathbf{f}_{k}^{H}\mathbf{z} \right|^{2}} =
\frac{\mathbf{f}_{k}^{H}({\mathbf{s}_{k}\mathbf{s}}_{k}^{H})\mathbf{f}_{k}}{\mathbf{f}_{k}^{H}(\sum_{j
= 1,j \neq k}^{K}{\mathbf{s}_{j}\mathbf{s}}_{j}^{H} +
\mathbf{I})\mathbf{f}_{k}}\overset{\mathbf{f}_{k} =
\mathbf{s}_{k}}{\Rightarrow}\frac{1}{\text{trace}\left( \left(
\mathbf{S}\mathbf{S}^{T} \right)^{2} \right) - 1 + \nu_{k}},$
where $\text{trace}\left( \bullet \right)$ is the trace operator, $\nu_{k}$ is
the noise component in the SINR $\gamma_{k}$. The $\text{trace}\left( \bullet
\right)$ term in the denominator is the total squared correlation (TSC), which
also contains the desired unit signal power. So an additional unity term
arises in the denominator. If the post processed noise is white, i.e., the
noise power of each $\nu_{k}$ is the same, then the TSC can directly be used
as a performance metric.
From the center part of the SINR equation, let $\mathbf{R}_{k} = (\sum_{j =
1,j \neq k}^{K}{\mathbf{s}_{j}\mathbf{s}}_{j}^{H} + \mathbf{I})$, which is the
correlation matrix of the interference plus noise. It can be identified that
minimizing the denominator (or equivalently maximizing $\gamma_{k}$) is a well
known Rayleigh-Quotient problem. From this, the Eigen vector corresponding to
the minimum Eigen value of $\mathbf{R}_{k}$ may be considered as CW for UE
$k$, if it is assumed that $\mathbf{f}_{k}$ is matched to $\mathbf{s}_{k}$.
The fixed-point iterations start from the users choosing a random CW,
preferably with a unit norm. In a given sequential user order, say $k =
1,2,\ldots K$, each user updates its SS $\mathbf{s}_{k}$ by solving the Eigen
value problem while other SS, $\mathbf{s}_{j},\ j \neq k,$ are kept fixed,
i.e. After user $k$, the next user updates it\'s CW in the same way by
assuming the other CWs to be fixed. The iterations progress up to the final
user in the given order, such that in each iteration there are $K$ updates,
one for each CW (a signature vector) in $\mathbf{S}$. After the final update
in the given iteration, the first user in the order restarts the updates. This
repeats until convergence. Note that matrices that minimize the TSC are not
unique.
Again, from the center part of the SINR equation, the solution to
$\mathbf{f}_{k}$ can also be identified as the well known Generalized Eigen
Value Problem (GEVP), i.e., finding a common Eigen value for the matrix pair
($\mathbf{I,R}_{k}$). The solution to which is the linear MMSE vector given as
$\frac{\mathbf{R}_{k}^{- 1}\mathbf{s}_{k}}{\left(
{\mathbf{s}_{k}^{H}\mathbf{R}}_{k}^{- 2}\mathbf{s}_{k} \right)^{1/2}}$, in its
normalized form. Sequential iterations as mentioned before can be used, except
that instead of solving the Eigen value problem, the normalized linear MMSE
expression is used during updates. For this SINR maximization problem (or
equivalently a TSC minimization), the obtained solution for $\mathbf{S}$ from
both the MMSE iterations and the Eigen vector iterations is the same fixed-
point. These methods are classified as Interference Avoidance (IA) techniques.
The obtained TSC value is bounded from below by the Welch Bound (WB). For
theoretically optimal system performance in certain conditions, it is required
that the bound be satisfied by equality, in which case it is called the Welch
Bound Equality (WBE). At the WBE, various metrics (such as the System
Capacity, Sum MSE) in the system are simultaneously optimized. So the main
objective of the IA technique here is to obtain a matrix S, such that the TSC
from the constituent vectors achieve the WBE.
A Kronecker product based approach may be employed to obtain (or construct)
higher dimensional Welch bound equality (WBE) SS, i.e., higher $N$ values,
from lower dimensional WBE SS.
Signature grouping can also be applied to have low or no correlation between
signature sequences within the group targeting to reduce the complexity of the
receiver while not decreasing the performance. One such approach is to have
orthogonality between certain subset of vectors within a given Welch Bond (WB)
set. Such a set of vectors are said to form a subspace-packing based codebook.
In addition, these vectors also satisfy the Welch Bound (WB). So, the codebook
is a subset of general WB codebook.

### A.4.2 WBE based on modified Chirp sequence
Assuming the spreading factor is _K_ and the number of distinct spreading
codes is _N_ , the _n_ -th spreading code can be denoted by
$S_{n} \triangleq \left\lbrack s_{n}\left( 1 \right)\text{\ \ }s_{n}\left( 2
\right)\ \ \ \ \ \ \cdots\ \ \ \ s_{n}\left( K \right) \right\rbrack\ ;\ \ \ \
\ 1 \leq n \leq N,\ \ N > K \geq 2$ (A.4.2-1)
One example of closed-form construction would be
$s_{n}\left( k \right) \triangleq \frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}\exp\left( j\pi\left(
\frac{\left( k + n \right)^{2}}{N} \right) \right)w\left( k \right)$; $1 \leq
k \leq K,\ 1 \leq n \leq N$ (A.4.2-2)
where $w(k)$ is a perfect sequence of period _K_ , that is
$\sum_{k = 1}^{K}{w\left( k \right)w^{*}\left( k + l \right) = \text{Kδ}\left(
l \right).}$ (A.4.2-3)
It can be shown that the spreading code generated above is a WBE set, which
achieves the WB on sum squared correlations for arbitrary _K_ and _N_
satisfying $N > K \geq 2$.

### A.4.8 MUI based sequence generation method
MUI is calculated using Equation 1. Where $M$ represents the number of code
words [ ]{dir="rtl"} in a pool, $v_{i}$ is a single code word that MUI
parameter is evaluated toward. $N$ is the length of the codeword.
$\mathbf{\text{MU}}\mathbf{I}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{=}\frac{\mathbf{N\ \bullet
M}}{\sum_{\mathbf{j = 0,j \neq i}}^{\mathbf{M - 1}}\left| \left\langle
\mathbf{v}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{,}\mathbf{v}_{\mathbf{j}} \right\rangle
\right|}$ (A.4.8-1)
To create a spreading code, it is first required to set the length of the
spreading code. For an $N$-length code, we can create $N$ orthogonal
sequences. This will span the space of the spreading code. We will generate
the code using complex Hadamard codes in normalized de-phased form. The
construction equation is showed as Eq. (A.4.8-2) below.
$\left\lbrack F_{N} \right\rbrack = e^{\frac{jk2\pi}{N}}$ (A.4.8-2)
After we create the orthogonal base, we start the creation of the non-
orthogonal set.
First, we construct the hereby defined _hyperplanes_ \-- we choose pairs of
orthogonal vectors from the base set $F_{N}$. Each pair of orthogonal vectors
defines a hyperplane. Therefore, for a set of $N$ vectors we can define $K
\equiv \begin{pmatrix} N \ 2 \ \end{pmatrix}$ orthogonal hyperplanes, as seen
in Eq. (A.4.8-3).
$K = \begin{pmatrix} N \ 2 \ \end{pmatrix} = \frac{N!}{2!\left( N - 2
\right)!} = \frac{N}{2} \bullet (N - 1)$ (A.4.8-3)
Second, we construct non-orthogonal vectors in each hyperplane. To do so, we
need to decide how many non-orthogonal vectors we would like to create.
Considering K hyperplanes, N orthogonal sequences and M required sequence pool
size, the number of non-orthogonal vectors per hyperplanes $L$ is calculated
by Eq. (A.4.8-4). Looking at Eq. (A.4.8-4) it is seen that there is a
flexibility at the size of the sequence pool that is dependent on L.
$L = \left\lceil \frac{M - N}{K} \right\rceil$ (A.4.8-4)
To generate the new sequences, we will generate linear combination in each
hyperplane by setting minimum cross correlation between the new vector and its
building hyperplanes. This is called the _constraint of least projection_
which is defined by $\min\left\langle A,B \right\rangle$. [ ]{dir="rtl"}
Let us see an example of such an operation. Assume two orthogonal vectors
$\overrightarrow{A},\overrightarrow{B}$ defined as in Eq. (A.4.8-5). It is
possible to see that using $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we create a linear combination
to generate the new spreading sequence. To generate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we
use $\theta_{s} ≔ \frac{\pi*s}{2(L + 1)}$ for $s = { 1,\ldots,L}$ so that:
$\alpha_{s} = cos(\theta_{s})$ and $\beta_{s} = \sin\left( \theta_{s}

### A.4.11 Method of bit level interleaving and symbol level interleaving with
zero padding
**_\- UE specific bit level interleaving_**
The data matrix has X column(s) and Y row(s), the input bit sequence is
**_a_** and output bit sequence **_x_** ，the starting position of the bit
level interleaving for _k_ ~th~ UE is configured as CS _~k-bit,~_
_b_ =0;
for _j_ = 0 to X-1
for _i_ = 0 to Y-1
$$x_{i + j \bullet Y} = a_{b \bullet X + mod(j + \text{CS}_{k - bit},X)}$$
_b=b+1_
end for
end for
**_\- UE specific symbol level interleaving with zero padding_**
The zero row index set is $I = \ { i_{0},..,i_{z}}$，e.g., if the zero pattern
is [1,0,1,0], then the I={1,3}. The data symbol matrix has X column(s) and Y
row(s)，the input symbol sequence is **_S_** and output symbol sequence
**_S\'_** ，and the interleaver starting position of the symbol level
interleaving for _k_ ~th~ UE is configured as CS _~k-symbol~_ (in addition, CS
_~k-symbol~_ can be equal to CS _~k-bit~_),
_b_ =0
for _j_ = 0 to X-1
for _i_ = 0 to Y-1
if $i \in I$
$${S'}_{i + j \bullet Y} = 0$$
else
$${S'}_{i + j \bullet Y} = S_{b \bullet X + mod(j + \text{CS}_{k - symbol},\
X)}$$
b= b+1
end for
end for
### A.4.12 Sequence grouping method
For any sequences pool with _L_ sequences, the sequences pool can be divided
into _G_ groups for interference reduction and performance enhancement. For
unequal received powers, only the cross-correlations among sequences in groups
with lower received powers matter. Therefore, the optimal sequences in group
$g$ should satisfy
$\min_{\mathbf{S}_{g}}{\sum_{m,n \geq g}^{}{\sum_{i \in
\mathcal{K}_{m}}^{}{\sum_{j \in
\mathcal{K}_{n}}^{}{{\widetilde{P}}_{m}{\widetilde{P}}_{n}\left|
\mathbf{s}_{i}^{H}\mathbf{s}_{j} \right|^{2}}}}}$, (A.4.12-1)
where $\mathbf{S}_{g}$ is composed by sequences for group $g$,
$\mathcal{K}_{m}$ and ${\widetilde{P}}_{m}$ denote the set of sequences
indices and average received power of group _m_ , respectively, and
${\widetilde{P}}_{1} \geq \cdots \geq {\widetilde{P}}_{G}$ without loss of
generality. Based on Eq. (A.4.12-1), the sequences for the _G_ groups can be
obtained from the original sequence pool $\mathbf{S =}\left\lbrack
\mathbf{s}_{1}\mathbf{,\cdots,}\mathbf{s}_{L} \right\rbrack$.
Considering the complexity of implementation and large storage requirement of
optimal sequence grouping for any multi-level received powers, sub-optimal
sequence grouping algorithm ignoring the exact power setup shown in Table
A.4.12-1 and Table A.4.12-2 can be considered.
Table A.4.12-1: Algorithm for sequence grouping (For small power offset
between adjacent groups)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1: Let $g = 1$ and $\mathbf{S}^{\left( 1 \right)} = \mathbf{S}$ | | //Initialization | +======================================================================+ | 2: **loop** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 3: **if** $g 
_N__ SF, _N__ SF _= 2 or 4_ ,
\- the value of $N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{adj}}$ as large as 24, 48 at UE speed
higher than 3 km/h, e.g. 60km/h or 120 km/h, can cause significant BLER
performance degradation for larger TBS, e.g. 75 bytes or 150 bytes;
\- the value of $N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{adj}}$ as large as 144, can cause
significant BLER performance degradation even for 20 bytes TBS at 3km/h;
\- The analysis from Source 4 indicates that for $N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{adj}}\
$ _=48_ and _N__ SF _= 4_ , negligible or 0.15 dB performance loss is observed
for 20 bytes TBS at 30 km/h or 120km/h respectively;
\- The analysis in [70] indicates that the impact of
$N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{adj}}$on BLER performance depends on both time and
frequency selectivity of the channel, and the evaluation shows that
\- no clear performance degradation is observed for
$N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{adj}}$ _= 24 or 144_ at UE speed of 3km/h
\- 0.3 dB \~0.9 dB loss is observed for $N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{adj}}$ _= 24 or
144_ , respectively at UE speed of 30 km/h
\- severe performance degradation is observed at UE speed of 60 km/h
\- The analysis in [71] indicates that the practical implementation should
consider to use $N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{adj}}$_=N__ SF
