# 4 General
## 4.1 Procedure specification principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional
behaviour of the terminating NG-RAN node exactly and completely. Any rule that
specifies the behaviour of the originating NG-RAN node shall be possible to be
verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure
text in clause 8:
\- The procedure text discriminates between:
1) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports
procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the initiating
message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message
used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an
appropriate cause value.
2) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if supported,\"
perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node
shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting
node about the not supported functionality.
\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not
explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response
message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including
_Criticality Diagnostics_ IE, see section 10.
## 4.2 Forwards and backwards compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related
IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format
that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded
regardless of the standard version.
## 4.3 Specification notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the
Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case
characters followed by the word \"procedure\", e.g. Handover Preparation
procedure.
Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is
written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word
\"message\", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.
IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the
_Information Element Name_ is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the
abbreviation \"IE\", e.g. _PDU Session ID_ IE.
Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in
the specification the \"Value\" is written as it is specified in sub clause
9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. \"Value\".
# 5 XnAP services
The present clause describes the services an NG-RAN node offers to its
neighbours.
## 5.1 XnAP procedure modules
The Xn interface XnAP procedures are divided into two modules as follows:
1\. XnAP Basic Mobility Procedures;
2\. XnAP Global Procedures;
The XnAP Basic Mobility Procedures module contains procedures used to handle
the UE mobility within NG-RAN.
The Global Procedures module contains procedures that are not related to a
specific UE. The procedures in this module are in contrast to the above module
involving two peer NG-RAN nodes.
## 5.2 Parallel transactions
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any instance in
time one protocol peer shall have a maximum of one ongoing XnAP procedure
related to a certain UE.
# 6 Services expected from signalling transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of XnAP messages.
XnAP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
Xn signalling transport is specified in TS 38.422 [4].
# 7 Functions of XnAP
The functions of XnAP are specified in TS 38.420 [3].
# 8 XnAP procedures
## 8.1 Elementary procedures
In the following tables, all EPs are divided into Class 1 and Class 2 EPs.

## 8.2 Basic mobility procedures
### 8.2.1 Handover Preparation
#### 8.2.1.1 General
This procedure is used to establish necessary resources in an NG-RAN node for
an incoming handover. If the procedure concerns a conditional handover,
parallel transactions are allowed. Possible parallel requests are identified
by the target cell ID when the source UE AP IDs are the same.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.1.2-1: Handover Preparation, successful operation
The source NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER REQUEST
message to the target NG-RAN node. When the source NG-RAN node sends the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, it shall start the timer TXn~RELOCprep.~
If the _Conditional Handover Information Request_ IE is contained in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall consider that the
request concerns a conditional handover and shall include the _Conditional
Handover Information_ _Acknowledge_ IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message.
If the _Target NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID_ IE is contained in the _Conditional
Handover Information Request_ IE included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message,
then the target NG-RAN node shall remove the existing prepared conditional HO
identified by the _Target NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID_ IE and the _Target Cell
Global ID_ IE. It is up to the implementation of the target NG-RAN node when
to remove the HO information.
Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the source NG-RAN
node shall stop the timer TXn~RELOCprep~ and terminate the Handover
Preparation procedure. If the procedure was initiated for an immediate
handover, the source NG-RAN node shall start the timer TXn~RELOCoverall~. The
source NG-RAN node is then defined to have a Prepared Handover for that Xn UE-
associated signalling.
For each _E-RAB ID_ IE included in the _QoS Flow To Be Setup List_ IE in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store
the content of the IE in the UE context and use it for subsequent inter-system
handover.
If the _Masked IMEISV_ IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message the
target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it to determine the
characteristics of the UE for subsequent handling.
At reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST message the target NG-RAN node shall
prepare the configuration of the AS security relation between the UE and the
target NG-RAN node by using the information in the _UE Security Capabilities_
IE and the _AS Security Information_ IE in the _UE Context Information_ IE, as
specified in TS 33.501 [28].
Upon reception of the _PDU Session Resource Setup List_ IE, contained in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall behave the same as
specified in TS 38.413 [5] for the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure. The
target NG-RAN node shall report in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message
the successful establishment of the result for all the requested PDU session
resources. When the target NG-RAN node reports the unsuccessful establishment
of a PDU session resource, the cause value should be precise enough to enable
the source NG-RAN node to know the reason for the unsuccessful establishment.
For each PDU session if the _PDU Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is
included in the _PDU Session Resources To Be Setup List_ IE contained in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall store the received PDU
Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context and use it when enforcing
traffic policing for Non-GBR QoS flows for the concerned UE as specified in TS
23.501 [7].
For each QoS flow for which the source NG-RAN node proposes to perform
forwarding of downlink data, the source NG-RAN node shall include the _DL
Forwarding_ IE set to \"DL forwarding proposed\" within the _Data Forwarding
and_ _Offloading Info from source NG-RAN node_ IE in the _PDU Session
Resources To Be Setup List_ IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message. The source NG-
RAN node shall include the _DL Forwarding_ IE set to \"DL forwarding
proposed\" for all the QoS flows mapped to a DRB, if it requests a DAPS
handover for that DRB.
For each PDU session, for which the target NG-RAN node decides to admit the
data forwarding for at least one QoS flow, the target NG-RAN node may include
the _PDU Session level DL data forwarding UP TNL Information_ IE within the
_Data Forwarding Info from target NG-RAN node_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource
Admitted Info_ IE contained in the _PDU Session Resources Admitted List_ IE in
the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.
For each QoS flow for which the source NG-RAN node has not yet received the
SDAP end marker packet if QoS flow re-mapping happened before handover, the
source NG-RAN node shall include the _UL Forwarding_ _Proposal_ IE within the
_Data Forwarding and Offloading Info from source NG-RAN node_ IE in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, and if the target NG-RAN node decides to admit
uplink data forwarding for at least one QoS flow, the target NG-RAN node may
include the _PDU Session Level UL Data Forwarding UP TNL Information_ IE in
the _Data Forwarding Info from target NG-RAN node_ IE in the _PDU Session
Resources Admitted Item_ IE contained in the _PDU Session Resources Admitted
List_ IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to indicate that it
accepts the uplink data forwarding.
For each PDU session resource successfully setup at the target NG-RAN, the
target NG-RAN node may allocate resources for additional Xn-U PDU session
resource GTP-U tunnels, indicated in the _Secondary Data Forwarding Info from
target NG-RAN node List_ IE.
For each PDU session in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, if the _Alternative QoS
Parameters Set List_ IE is included in the _GBR QoS Flow Information_ IE in
the _PDU Session Resources To Be Setup List_ IE, the target NG-RAN node may
accept the setup of the involved QoS flow when notification control has been
enabled if the requested QoS parameters set or at least one of the alternative
QoS parameters sets can be fulfilled at the time of handover as specified in
TS 23.501 [7]. In case the target NG-RAN node accepts the handover fulfilling
one of the alternative QoS parameters it shall indicate the alternative QoS
parameters set which it can currently fulfil in the _Current QoS Parameters
Set Index_ IE within the _PDU Session Resources Admitted List_ IE of the
HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message while setting the QoS parameters towards
the UE according to the requested QoS parameters set as specified in TS 23.501
[7].
For each DRB for which the source NG-RAN node proposes to perform forwarding
of downlink data, the source NG-RAN node shall include the _DRB ID_ IE and the
mapped _QoS Flows List_ IE within the _Source DRB to QoS Flow Mapping List_ IE
contained in the _PDU Session Resources To Be Setup List_ IE in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message. The source NG-RAN node may include the _QoS Flow Mapping
Indication_ IE in the _Source DRB to QoS Flow Mapping List_ IE to indicate
that only the uplink or downlink QoS flow is mapped to the DRB. If the target
NG-RAN node decides to use the same DRB configuration and to map the same QoS
flows as the source NG-RAN node, the target NG-RAN node includes the _DL
Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint_ IE within the _Data Forwarding Response DRB
List_ IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to indicate that it
accepts the proposed forwarding of downlink data for this DRB.
The target NG-RAN node may additionally include the _Redundant DL Forwarding
UP TNL Information_ IE if at least one of the QoS flow mapped to the DRB is
eligible to the redundant transmission feature as indicated in the _Redundant
QoS Flow Indicator_ IE within the _PDU Session Resource To Be Setup List_ IE
received in the HANDOVER REQUEST message for the QoS flow.
If the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message contains the _UL Forwarding UP TNL
Information_ IE for a given DRB in the _Data Forwarding Response DRB List IE
within Data Forwarding Info from target NG-RAN node_ IE in the _PDU Session
Resources Admitted List_ IE and the source NG-RAN node accepts the data
forwarding proposed by the target NG-RAN node _,_ the source NG-RAN node shall
perform forwarding of uplink data for the DRB.
If the HANDOVER REQUEST includes PDU session resources for PDU sessions
associated to S-NSSAIs not supported by target NG-RAN, the target NG-RAN shall
reject such PDU session resources. In this case, and if at least one _PDU
Session Resource To Be Setup Item_ IE is admitted, the target NG-RAN shall
send the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message including the **_PDU Session
Resources Not Admitted List_ IE listing corresponding PDU sessions rejected at
the target NG-RAN.**
If the _Mobility Restriction List_ IE is
\- contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall
\- store the information received in the _Mobility Restriction List_ IE in the
UE context;
\- use this information to determine a target for the UE during subsequent
mobility action for which the NG-RAN node provides information about the
target of the mobility action towards the UE, except when one of the PDU
sessions has a particular ARP value (TS 23.501 [7]) in which case the
information shall not apply;
\- use this information to select a proper SCG during dual connectivity
operation.
\- use this information to select proper RNA(s) for the UE when moving the UE
to RRC_INACTIVE.
\- not contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall
\- consider that no roaming and no access restriction apply to the UE except
for the PNI-NPN mobility as described in TS 23.501 [7].
The target NG-RAN node shall consider that roaming or access to CAG cells is
only allowed if the _Allowed PNI-NPN ID List_ IE is contained in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message, as described in TS 23.501 [7].
If the _Trace Activation_ IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message the
target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, initiate the requested trace function
as specified in TS 32.422 [23].
If the _Index to RAT/Frequency Selection Priority_ IE is contained in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall store this information
and use it as defined in TS 23.501 [7].
If the _UE Context Reference at the S-NG-RAN_ IE is contained in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message the target NG-RAN node may use it as specified in TS 37.340
[8]. In this case, the source NG-RAN node may expect the target NG-RAN node to
include the _UE Context Kept Indicator_ IE set to \"True\" in the HANDOVER
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, which shall use this information as specified in
TS 37.340 [8].
For each PDU session, if the _Network Instance_ IE is included in the _PDU
Session Resource To Be Setup List_ IE and the _Common Network Instance_ IE is
not present, the target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it when selecting
transport network resource as specified in TS 23.501 [7].
Redundant transmission:
\- For each PDU session, if the _Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information at UPF_
IE is included in the _PDU Session Resource To Be Setup List_ IE, the target
NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it as the uplink termination point for
the user plane data for the redundant transmission for the concerned PDU
session.
\- For each PDU session, if the _Additional Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL
Information at UPF List_ IE is included in the _PDU Session Resource To Be
Setup List_ IE, the target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use them as the
uplink termination points for the user plane data for the redundant
transmission for the concerned PDU session.
\- For each PDU session, if the _Redundant Common Network Instance_ IE is
included in the _PDU Session Resource To Be Setup List_ IE, the target NG-RAN
node shall, if supported, use it when selecting transport network resource for
the redundant transmission as specified in TS 23.501 [7].
\- For each PDU session, if the _Redundant PDU Session Information_ IE is
included in the _PDU Session Resource To Be Setup List_ IE contained in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store
the received information in the UE context and set up the redundant user plane
for the concerned PDU session, as specified in TS 23.501 [7].
If the _TSC Traffic Characteristics_ IE is included in the _QoS Flows To Be
Setup_ List in the _PDU Session Resource To Be Setup List_ IE, the target NG-
RAN node shall, if supported, use it as specified in TS 23.501 [7].
For each PDU session, if the _Common_ _Network Instance_ IE is included in the
_PDU Session Resource To Be Setup List_ IE or in the _Additional UL NG-U UP
TNL Information at UPF List_ IE, or in the _Additional Redundant UL NG-U UP
TNL Information at UPF List_ IE, the target NG-RAN node shall, if supported,
use it when selecting transport network resource for the concerned NG-U
transport bearer as specified in TS 23.501 [7].

### 8.2.2 SN Status Transfer
#### 8.2.2.1 General
The purpose of the SN Status Transfer procedure is to transfer the uplink PDCP
SN and HFN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN and HFN transmitter status
either, from the source to the target NG-RAN node during an Xn handover,
between the NG-RAN nodes involved in dual connectivity, or after retrieval of
a UE context for RRC reestablishment, for each respective DRB of the source
DRB configuration for which PDCP SN and HFN status preservation applies.
In case that the Xn handover is a DAPS handover, the SN Status Transfer
procedure may also be used to transfer the uplink PDCP SN and HFN receiver
status, or the downlink PDCP SN and HFN transmitter status for a DRB
associated with RLC-UM and configured with DAPS as described in TS 38.300 [9].
If the SN Status Transfer procedure is applied in the course of dual
connectivity or RRC connection re-establishment in the subsequent
specification text
\- the behaviour of the NG-RAN node from which the DRB context is transferred,
i.e. the NG-RAN node involved in dual connectivity or RRC connection re-
establishment, from which data is forwarded, is specified by the behaviour of
the \"source NG-RAN node\",
\- the behaviour of the NG-RAN node to which the DRB context is transferred,
i.e., the NG-RAN node involved in dual connectivity or RRC connection re-
establishment, to which data is forwarded, is specified by the behaviour of
the \"target NG-RAN node\".
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.2.2-1: SN Status Transfer, successful operation
The source NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by stop assigning PDCP SNs to
downlink SDUs and stop delivering UL SDUs towards the 5GC and sending the SN
STATUS TRANSFER message to the target NG-RAN node at the time point when it
considers the transmitter/receiver status to be frozen. The target NG-RAN node
using full configuration for this handover as per TS 38.300 [9] or for the MR-
DC operations as per TS 37.340 [8] shall ignore the information received in
this message. In case of MR-DC, if the target NG-RAN node performs PDCP SN
length change or RLC mode change for a DRB as specified in TS 37.340 [8], it
shall ignore the information received for that DRB in this message.
In case that the Xn handover is a DAPS handover, the source NG-RAN node may
continue assigning PDCP SNs to downlink SDUs and delivering uplink SDUs toward
the 5GC when initiating this procedure for DRBs not configured with DAPS as in
TS 38.300 [9].
For each DRB in the _DRBs Subject to Status Transfer List_ IE, the source NG-
RAN node shall include the _DRB ID_ IE, the _UL COUNT Value_ IE and the _DL
COUNT Value_ IE.
The source NG-RAN node may also include in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message the
missing and the received uplink SDUs in the _Receive Status of UL PDCP SDUs_
**IE for each DRB for which the source NG-RAN node has accepted the request
from the target NG-RAN node for uplink forwarding.**
For each DRB in the **_DRBs Subject to Status Transfer List_** IE, the target
NG-RAN node shall not deliver any uplink packet which has a PDCP-SN lower than
the value contained within the _UL COUNT Value_ IE.
For each DRB in the **_DRBs Subject to Status Transfer List_** IE, the target
NG-RAN node shall use the value of the _PDCP SN_ contained within the _DL
COUNT Value_ IE for the first downlink packet for which there is no PDCP-SN
yet assigned.
If the _Receive Status of UL PDCP SDUs_ **IE is included for at least one DRB
in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message, the target NG-RAN node may use it in a
Status Report message sent to the UE over the radio interface.**
If the SN STATUS TRANSFER message contains in the _DRBs Subject To Status
Transfer List_ IE the _Old QoS Flow List - UL End Marker expected_ IE, the
target NG-RAN shall be prepared to receive the SDAP end marker for the QoS
flow via the corresponding DRB, as specified in TS 38.300 [8].
#### 8.2.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.2.2.4 Abnormal Conditions

handover exists at the target NG-RAN node, the target NG-RAN node shall ignore
the message.
### 8.2.3 Handover Cancel
#### 8.2.3.1 General
The Handover Cancel procedure is used to enable a source NG-RAN node to cancel
an ongoing handover preparation or an already prepared handover.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.3.2-1: Handover Cancel, successful operation
The source NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER CANCEL
message to the target NG-RAN node. The source NG-RAN node shall indicate the
reason for cancelling the handover by means of an appropriate cause value.
If the _Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled List_ IE is included in the HANDOVER
CANCEL message, the target NG-RAN node shall consider that the source NG-RAN
node is cancelling only the handover associated to the candidate cells
identified by the included NG-RAN CGI and associated to the same UE-associated
signaling connection identified by the _Source NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID IE_ and,
if included, also by _the Target NG-RAN nod_ e _UE XnAP ID IE_.
#### 8.2.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.2.3.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the HANDOVER CANCEL message refers to a context that does not exist, the
target NG-RAN node shall ignore the message.
If the _Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled List_ IE is included in the HANDOVER
CANCEL message and the handover is not associated to a conditional handover,
the target NG-RAN node shall ignore the _Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled List_
IE.
If one or more candidate cells in the _Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled List_
IE included in the HANDOVER CANCEL message were not prepared using the same
UE-associated signaling connection, the target NG-RAN node shall ignore those
non-associated candidate cells.
### 8.2.4 Retrieve UE Context
#### 8.2.4.1 General
The purpose of the Retrieve UE Context procedure is to either retrieve the UE
context from the old NG-RAN node and transfer it to the NG-RAN node where the
UE RRC Connection has been requested to be established, or to enable the old
NG-RAN node to forward an RRC message to the UE via the new NG-RAN node
without context transfer.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

### 8.2.7 UE Context Release
#### 8.2.7.1 General
For handover, the UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the target NG-
RAN node to indicate to the source NG-RAN node that radio and control plane
resources for the associated UE context are allowed to be released.
For dual connectivity, the UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the
M-NG-RAN node to initiate the release the UE context at the S-NG-RAN node. For
dual connectivity specific mobility scenarios specified in TS 37.340 [8],
where SCG radio resources in the S-NG-RAN node are kept, only resources
related to the UE-associated signalling connection between the M-NG-RAN node
and the S-NG-RAN node are released.
For UE context retrieval, the UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the
new NG-RAN node to indicate to the old NG-RAN node that radio and control
plane resources for the associated UE context are allowed to be released.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.7.2 Successful Operation

**Handover**
The UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the target NG-RAN node. By
sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message the target NG-RAN node informs the
source NG-RAN node of Handover success and triggers the release of resources.
Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the source NG-RAN node may
release radio and control plane related resources associated to the UE
context. If data forwarding has been performed, the source NG-RAN node should
continue forwarding of user plane data as long as packets are received at the
source NG-RAN node.
**Dual Connectivity**
The UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the M-NG-RAN node. By sending
the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message the M-NG-RAN node informs the S-NG-RAN node
that the UE Context can be removed.
Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the S-NG-RAN node may
release radio and control plane related resources associated to the UE
context. If data forwarding has been performed, the S-NG-RAN node should
continue forwarding of user plane data as long as packets are received at the
S-NG-RAN node.

node from any prepared NG-RAN node before the expiry of the timer
TXn~RELOCoverall~, the source NG-RAN node shall request the AMF to release the
UE context.
If the UE returns to source NG-RAN node before the reception of the UE CONTEXT
RELEASE message or the expiry of the timer TXn~RELOCoverall~, the source NG-
RAN node shall stop the TXn~RELOCoverall~ and continue to serve the UE.
### 8.2.8 Handover Success
#### 8.2.8.1 General
The Handover Success procedure is used during a conditional handover or a DAPS
handover to enable a target NG-RAN node to inform the source NG-RAN node that
the UE has successfully accessed the target NG-RAN node.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.8.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.8.2-1: Handover Success, successful operation

message to the source NG-RAN node.
If late data forwarding was configured for this UE, the source NG-RAN node
shall start data forwarding using the tunnel information related to the global
target cell ID provided in the HANDOVER SUCCESS message.
When the source NG-RAN node receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message, it shall
consider all other CHO preparations accepted for this UE under the same UE-
associated signalling connection in the target NG-RAN node as cancelled.
**Interactions with other procedures**
If a CONDITIONAL HANDOVER CANCEL message was received for this UE prior the
reception of the HANDOVER SUCCESS message, the source NG-RAN node shall
consider that the UE successfully executed the handover.
The source NG-RAN node may initiate Handover Cancel procedure towards the
other signalling connections or other candidate target NG-RAN nodes for this
UE, if any.
#### 8.2.8.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.2.8.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the HANDOVER SUCCESS message refers to a context that does not exist, the
source NG-RAN node shall ignore the message.
### 8.2.9 Conditional Handover Cancel
#### 8.2.9.1 General
The Conditional Handover Cancel procedure is used to enable a target NG-RAN
node to cancel an already prepared conditional handover.

HANDOVER CANCEL message to the source NG-RAN node. The target NG-RAN node
shall indicate the reason for cancelling the conditional handover by means of
an appropriate cause value.
At the reception of the CONDITIONAL HANDOVER CANCEL message, the source NG-RAN
node shall consider that the target NG-RAN node is about to remove any
reference to, and release any resources previously reserved for candidate
cells associated to the UE-associated signalling identified by the _Source NG-
RAN node UE XnAP ID_ IE and the _Target NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID_ IE. If the
_Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled List_ IE is included in CONDITIONAL HANDOVER
CANCEL message, the source NG-RAN node shall consider that only the resources
reserved for the cells identified by the included NG-RAN CGI are about to be
released.
#### 8.2.9.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.2.9.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the CONDITIONAL HANDOVER CANCEL message refers to a context that does not
exist, the source NG-RAN node shall ignore the message.
If one or more candidate cells in the _Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled List_
IE included in the CONDITIONAL HANDOVER CANCEL message were not prepared using
the same UE-associated signaling connection, the source NG-RAN node shall
ignore those non-associated candidate cells.
### 8.2.10 Early Status Transfer
#### 8.2.10.1 General
The purpose of the Early Status Transfer procedure is to transfer the COUNT of
the first downlink SDU that the source NG-RAN node forwards to the target NG-
RAN node or the COUNT for discarding of already forwarded downlink SDUs for
respective DRB during DAPS Handover or Conditional Handover.
For MR-DC with 5GC, the Early Status Transfer procedure is also used from the
source S-NG-RAN node to the source M-NG-RAN node during a Conditional Handover
as specified in TS 37.340 [8].
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

STATUS TRANSFER message contains the DRB ID(s) corresponding to the DRB(s)
subject to be simultaneously served by the source and the target NG-RAN nodes
during DAPS Handover or the DRB(s) transferred during Conditional Handover.
For each DRB in the _DRBs Subject To Early Status Transfer List_ IE, the
target NG-RAN node shall use the value of the _FIRST DL COUNT Value_ IE as the
COUNT of the first downlink SDU that the source NG-RAN node forwards to the
target NG-RAN node.
For each DRB in the _DRBs Subject To Early Status Transfer List_ IE for which
the _DISCARD DL COUNT Value_ IE is received in the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER
message, the target NG-RAN node does not transmit forwarded downlink SDUs to
the UE whose COUNT is less than the provided and discards them if transmission
has not been attempted.
**From source S-NG-RAN node to source M-NG-RAN node, the source NG-RAN node
for Conditional Handover**
The _DRBs Subject To Early Status Transfer List_ IE included in the EARLY
STATUS TRANSFER message contains the DRB ID(s) corresponding to the DRB(s)
transferred during Conditional Handover.

Capacity Assistance Information E-UTRA_ IE is present in the XN SETUP RESPONSE
message from the candidate NG-RAN node~2~, the NG-RAN node~1~ shall, if
supported, store the collected information to be used for future NG-RAN node
interface management.
If the _CSI-RS Transmission Indication_ IE is contained in the XN SETUP
REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node~2~ shall, if supported, take this IE into
account for neighbour cell's CSI-RS measurement.
If the _CSI-RS Transmission Indication_ IE in the XN SETUP RESPONSE message,
the NG-RAN node~1~ shall, if supported, take this IE into account for
neighbour cell's CSI-RS measurement.
The initiating NG-RAN node~1~ may include the _PRACH Configuration_ IE (for
served E-UTRA cells) or the _NR Cell PRACH Configuration_ IE (for served NR
cells) or the _NPRACH Configuration_ IE (for served NB-IoT cells) in the XN
SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate NG-RAN node~2~ may also include the
_PRACH Configuration_ IE (for served E-UTRA cells) or _NR Cell PRACH
Configuration_ IE (for served NR cells) or the _NPRACH Configuration_ IE (for
served NB-IoT cells) in the XN SETUP RESPONSE message. The NG-RAN node

the initiating node shall, if supported, deduce that the failure is due to a
too large XN SETUP REQUEST message and ensure that the total number of served
cells in following XN SETUP REQUEST message is equal to or lower than the
value of the _Maximum Cell List Size_ IE.
#### 8.4.1.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the first message received for a specific TNL association is not an XN
SETUP REQUEST, XN SETUP RESPONSE, or XN SETUP FAILURE message then this shall
be treated as a logical error.
If the initiating NG-RAN node~1~ does not receive either XN SETUP RESPONSE
message or XN SETUP FAILURE message, the NG-RAN node~1~ may reinitiate the Xn
Setup procedure towards the same NG-RAN node, provided that the content of the
new XN SETUP REQUEST message is identical to the content of the previously
unacknowledged XN SETUP REQUEST message.
If the initiating NG-RAN node~1~ receives an XN SETUP REQUEST message from the
peer entity on the same Xn interface:
\- In case the NG-RAN node~1~ answers with an XN SETUP RESPONSE message and
receives a subsequent Xn SETUP FAILURE message, the NG-RAN node~1~ shall
consider the Xn interface as non operational and the procedure as

the same NG-RAN node~2~, provided that the content of the new NG-RAN NODE
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the content of the previously
unacknowledged NG-RAN NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.
### 8.4.3 Cell Activation
#### 8.4.3.1 General
The purpose of the Cell Activation procedure is to enable an NG-RAN node to
request a neighbouring NG-RAN node to switch on one or more cells, previously
reported as inactive due to energy saving.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.4.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.3.2-1: Cell Activation, successful operation
The NG-RAN node~1~ initiates the procedure by sending the CELL ACTIVATION
REQUEST message to the peer NG-RAN node~2~.
Upon receipt of this message, the NG-RAN node~2~ should activate the cell/s
indicated in the CELL ACTIVATION REQUEST message and shall indicate in the
CELL ACTIVATION RESPONSE message for which cells the request was fulfilled.
If case of network sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast with shared Xn-C
signalling transport, as specified in TS 38.300 [9], the CELL ACTIVATION
REQUEST message and the CELL ACTIVATION RESPONSE message shall include the
_Interface Instance Indication_ IE to identify the corresponding interface
instance.
**Interactions with NG-RAN Configuration Update procedure:**
The NG-RAN node~2~ shall not send the NG-RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to
the NG-RAN node~1~ just for the reason of the cell/s indicated in the CELL
ACTIVATION REQUEST message changing cell activation state, as the receipt of
the CELL ACTIVATION RESPONSE message by the NG-RAN node~1~ is used to update
the information about the activation state of NG-RAN node~2~ cells in the NG-
RAN node~1~.
#### 8.4.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation

signalling transport, as specified in TS 38.300 [9], the CELL ACTIVATION
REQUEST message and the CELL ACTIVATION FAILURE message shall include the
_Interface Instance Indication_ IE to identify the corresponding interface
instance.
#### 8.4.3.4 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.4.4 Reset
#### 8.4.4.1 General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to align the resources in the NG-RAN
node~1~ and the NG-RAN node~2~ in the event of an abnormal failure. The
procedure either resets the Xn interface or selected UE contexts. This
procedure doesn't affect the application level configuration data exchanged
during, e.g., the Xn Setup procedure.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.4.4.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.4.2-1: Reset, successful operation
The procedure is initiated with the RESET REQUEST message sent from the NG-RAN
node~1~ to the NG-RAN node~2~. Upon receipt of this message,
\- if the RESET REQUEST message indicates full reset the NG-RAN node~2~ shall
abort any other ongoing procedures over Xn between the NG-RAN node~1~ and the
NG-RAN node~2.~ The NG-RAN node~2~ shall delete all the context information
related to the NG-RAN node~1~, except the application level configuration data
exchanged during the Xn Setup or the NG-RAN node Configuration Update
procedures and release the corresponding resources. After completion of
release of the resources, the NG-RAN node~2~ shall respond with the RESET
RESPONSE message.
\- if the RESET REQUEST message indicates partial reset, the NG-RAN node~2~
shall abort any other ongoing procedures only for the indicated UE associated
signalling connections identified either by the _NG-RAN node1 UE XnAP ID_ IE
or the _NG-RAN node1 UE XnAP ID_ IE or both, for which the NG-RAN node~2~
shall delete all the context information related to the NG-RAN node~1~ and
release the corresponding resources. After completion of release of the
resources, the NG-RAN node~2~ shall respond with the RESET RESPONSE message
indicating the UE contexts admitted to be released. The NG-RAN node~2~
receiving the request for partial reset does not need to wait for the release
or reconfiguration of radio resources to be completed before returning the
RESET RESPONSE message. The NG-RAN node~2~ receiving the request for partial
reset shall include in the RESET RESPONSE message, for each UE association to
be released, the same list of UE-associated logical Xn-connections over Xn.
The list shall be in the same order as received in the RESET REQUEST message
and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical Xn-connections.
If case of network sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast with shared Xn-C
signalling transport, as specified in TS 38.300 [9], the RESET REQUEST message
and the RESET RESPONSE message shall include the _Interface Instance
Indication_ IE to identify the corresponding interface instance.
**Interactions with other procedures:**
If the RESET REQUEST message indicates full reset, the NG-RAN node~2~ shall
abort any other ongoing procedure (except for a Reset procedures).
If the RESET REQUEST message indicates partial reset, the NG-RAN node~2~ shall
abort any other ongoing procedure (except for a Reset procedures) on the same
Xn interface related to a UE associated signalling connection indicated in the
RESET REQUEST message.
#### 8.4.4.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Void.
#### 8.4.4.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the RESET REQUEST message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except
another Reset procedure) on the same Xn interface shall be aborted.
If the Reset procedure is ongoing and the responding node receives the RESET
REQUEST message from the peer entity on the same Xn interface, it shall
respond with the RESET RESPONSE message as specified in 8.4.4.2.
If the initiating node does not receive the RESET RESPONSE message, the
initiating node may reinitiate the Reset procedure towards the same NG-RAN
node, provided that the content of the new RESET REQUEST message is identical
to the content of the previously unacknowledged RESET REQUEST message.
### 8.4.5 Error Indication
#### 8.4.5.1 General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by an NG-RAN node to report
detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by
an appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE
associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE-associated
signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.4.5.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.5.2-1: Error Indication, successful operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication
procedure is initiated by the ERROR INDICATION message sent from the node
detecting the error situation.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the _Cause_ IE or
the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE.
In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by UE associated
signalling, in the course of handover signalling and signalling for dual
connectivity, the _Old NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID_ IE and the _New NG-RAN node UE
XnAP ID_ IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If any of the
_Old NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID_ IE and the _New NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID_ IE is not
correct, the cause shall be set to an appropriate value.
If case of network sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast with shared Xn-C
signalling transport, as specified in TS 38.300 [9], the ERROR INDICATION
message shall include the _Interface Instance Indication_ IE to identify the
corresponding interface instance.
#### 8.4.5.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.4.5.4 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.4.6 Xn Removal
#### 8.4.6.1 General
The purpose of the Xn Removal procedure is to remove the interface instance
between two NG-RAN nodes in a controlled manner. If successful, this procedure
erases any existing application level configuration data in the two nodes.
NOTE: In case the signalling transport is shared among several Xn-C interface
instances, and the TNL association is still used by one or more Xn-C interface
instances, the initiating NG-RAN node should not initiate the removal of the
TNL association.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signaling.
#### 8.4.6.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.6.2-1: Xn Removal, successful operation
An NG-RAN node~1~ initiates the procedure by sending the XN REMOVAL REQUEST
message to a candidate NG-RAN node~2~. Upon reception of the XN REMOVAL
REQUEST message the candidate NG-RAN node~2~ shall reply with the XN REMOVAL
RESPONSE message. After receiving the XN REMOVAL RESPONSE message, the
initiating NG-RAN node~1~ shall initiate removal of the TNL association
towards NG-RAN node~2~ and may remove all resources associated with that
interface instance. The candidate NG-RAN node~2~ may then remove all resources
associated with that interface instance.
If the _Xn Removal Threshold_ IE is included in the XN REMOVAL REQUEST
message, the candidate NG-RAN node~2~ shall, if supported, accept to remove
the interface instance with NG-RAN node~1~ if the Xn Benefit Value of the
interface instance determined at the candidate NG-RAN node~2~ is lower than
the value of the _Xn Removal Threshold_ IE.
If case of network sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast with shared Xn-C
signalling transport, as specified in TS 38.300 [9], the XN REMOVAL REQUEST
message and the XN REMOVAL RESPONSE message shall include the _Interface
Instance Indication_ IE to identify the corresponding interface instance.
#### 8.4.6.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.4.6.3-1: Xn Removal, unsuccessful operation
If the candidate NG-RAN node~2~ cannot accept to remove the interface instance
with NG-RAN node~1~ it shall respond with an XN REMOVAL FAILURE message with
an appropriate cause value.
If case of network sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast with shared Xn-C
signalling transport, as specified in TS 38.300 [9], the XN REMOVAL REQUEST
message and the XN REMOVAL FAILURE message shall include the _Interface
Instance Indication_ IE to identify the corresponding interface instance.
#### 8.4.6.4 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.4.7 Failure Indication
#### 8.4.7.1 General
The purpose of the Failure Indication procedure is to transfer information
regarding RRC re-establishment attempts, or received RLF Reports, between NG-
RAN nodes. The signalling takes place from the NG-RAN node at which a re-
establishment attempt is made, or an RLF Report is received, to an NG-RAN node
to which the UE concerned may have previously been attached prior to the
connection failure. This may aid the detection of radio link failure, handover
failure cases.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.4.7.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.7.2-1: Failure Indication, successful operation
NG-RAN node~2~ initiates the procedure by sending the FAILURE INDICATION
message to NG-RAN node~1~, following a re-establishment attempt or an RLF
Report reception from a UE at NG-RAN node~2~, when NG-RAN node~2~ considers
that the UE may have previously suffered a connection failure at a cell
controlled by NG-RAN node~1~.
If the _UE RLF Report Container_ IE is included in the FAILURE INDICATION
message, NG-RAN node~1~ shall use it to derive failure case information.
#### 8.4.7.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.4.7.4 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.4.8 Handover Report
#### 8.4.8.1 General
The purpose of the Handover Report procedure is to transfer mobility related
information between NG-RAN nodes.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.4.8.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.8.2-1: Handover Report, successful operation
NG-RAN node~1~ initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER REPORT message
to NG-RAN node~2~. When receiving the message NG-RAN node~2~ shall assume that
a mobility-related problem was detected.
If the _Handover Report Type_ IE is set to \"HO too early\" or \"HO to wrong
cell\", then NG-RAN node~1~ indicates to NG-RAN node~2~ that, following a
successful handover from a cell of NG-RAN node~2~ to a cell of NG-RAN node~1~,
a radio link failure occurred and the UE attempted RRC Re-establishment or re-
connected either at the original cell of NG-RAN node~2~ (Handover Too Early),
or at another cell (Handover to Wrong Cell). The detection of Handover Too
Early and Handover to Wrong Cell events is made according to TS 38.300 [9].
The HANDOVER REPORT message may include:
\- the _Mobility Information_ IE, if the _Mobility Information_ IE was sent
for this handover from NG-RAN node~2~;
\- the _Source cell C-RNTI_ IE.
If received, NG-RAN node~2~ uses the above information according to TS 38.300
[9].
If the _Handover Report Type_ IE is set to \"Inter-system ping-pong\", then
NG-RAN node~2~ shall deduce that a completed handover from a cell of NG-RAN
node~2~ to a cell in another system might have resulted in an inter-system
ping-pong and the UE was successfully handed over to a cell of NG-RAN node~1~
(indicated with _Target cell CGI_ IE).
**Interaction with the Failure Indication procedure:**
If NG-RAN node~1~ receives a UE RLF Report from an NG-RAN node via the FAILURE
INDICATION message, as described in TS 38.300 [9], NG-RAN node~1~ may also
include it in the _UE RLF Report Container_ IE included in the HANDOVER REPORT
message.

NG-RAN node~2~ is not able to complete the procedure, NG-RAN node~2~ shall
send the MOBILITY CHANGE FAILURE message with the _Cause_ IE set to an
appropriate value. NG-RAN node~2~ may include the _Mobility Parameters
Modification Range_ IE in the MOBILITY CHANGE FAILURE message, for example in
cases when the proposed change is out of the permitted range.
#### 8.4.9.4 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.4.10 Resource Status Reporting Initiation
#### 8.4.10.1 General
This procedure is used by an NG-RAN node to request the reporting of load
measurements to another NG-RAN node.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.4.10.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.10.2-1: Resource Status Reporting Initiation, successful operation
NG-RAN node~1~ initiates the procedure by sending the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST
message to NG-RAN node~2~ to start a measurement, stop a measurement or add
cells to report for a measurement. Upon receipt, NG-RAN node~2~:
\- shall initiate the requested measurement according to the parameters given
in the request in case the _Registration Request_ IE set to \"start\"; or
\- shall stop all cells measurements and terminate the reporting in case the
_Registration Request_ IE is set to \"stop\"; or
\- shall add cells indicated in the _Cell To Report List_ IE to the
measurements initiated before for the given measurement IDs, in case the
_Registration Request_ IE is set to \"add\". If measurements are already
initiated for a cell indicated in the _Cell To Report_ _List_ IE, this
information shall be ignored.
If the _Registration Request_ IE is set to \"start\" in the RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST message and the _Report Characteristics_ IE indicates cell specific
measurements, the _Cell To Report List_ IE shall be included.
If _Registration Request_ IE is set to \"add\" in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST
message, the _Cell To Report_ _List_ IE shall be included.
If NG-RAN node~2~ is capable to provide all requested resource status
information, it shall initiate the measurement as requested by NG-RAN node~1~
and respond with the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message.
**Interaction with other procedures**
When starting a measurement, the _Report Characteristics_ IE in the RESOURCE
STATUS REQUEST indicates the type of objects NG-RAN node~2~ shall perform
measurements on. For each cell, NG-RAN node~2~ shall include in the RESOURCE
STATUS UPDATE message:
\- the _Radio_ _Resource Status_ IE, if the first bit, \"PRB Periodic\" of the
_Report Characteristics_ IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is
set to \"1\". If NG-RAN node~2~ is a gNB and if the cell for which _Radio_
_Resource Status_ IE is requested to be reported supports more than one SSB,
the _Radio_ _Resource Status_ IE for such cell shall include the **_SSB Area
Radio Resource Status Item_ IE** for all SSB areas supported by the cell. If
the _SSB To Report List_ IE is included for a cell, the _Radio_ _Resource
Status_ IE for such cell shall include the requested **_SSB Area Radio
Resource Status List_ IE;**
\- the **_TNL Capacity Indicator_** IE, if the second bit, \"TNL Capacity Ind
Periodic\" of the _Report Characteristics_ IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST message is set to \"1\". The received **_TNL Capacity Indicator_** IE
represents the lowest TNL capacity available for the cell.
\- the _Composite Available Capacity Group_ IE, if the third bit, \"Composite
Available Capacity Periodic\" of the _Report Characteristics_ IE included in
the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to \"1\". If the _Cell Capacity
Class Value_ IE is included within the _Composite_ _Available Capacity Group_
IE, this IE is used to assign weights to the available capacity indicated in
the _Capacity Value_ IE. If NG-RAN node~2~ is a gNB and if the cell for which
_Composite Available Capacity Group_ IE is requested to be reported supports
more than one SSB, the _Composite Available Capacity Group_ IE for such cell
shall include the **_SSB Area Capacity Value List for all SSB areas supported
by the cell,_ providing the SSB area capacity with respect to the _Cell
Capacity Class Value_.** If the _SSB To Report List_ IE is included for a
cell, the _Composite Available Capacity Group_ IE for such cell shall include
the requested **_SSB Area Capacity Value List_ IE.**
If the cell for which _Composite Available Capacity Group_ IE is requested to
be reported supports more than one slice, and if the _Slice To Report List_ IE
is included for a cell, the _Slice Available Capacity_ IE for such cell shall
include the requested _Slice Available Capacity Value Downlink_ IE and _Slice
Available Capacity_ _Value Uplink_ IE**, providing the slice capacity with
respect to the Cell Capacity Class Value.**
\- the _Number of Active UEs_ IE, if the fourth bit, \"Number of Active UEs\"
of the _Report Characteristics_ IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST
message is set to \"1\";
\- the _RRC Connections_ IE, if the fifth bit, \"RRC Connections\" of the
_Report Characteristics_ IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is
set to \"1\".
If the _Reporting Periodicity_ IE in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST is present,
this indicates the periodicity for the reporting of periodic measurements. the
NG-RAN node~2~ shall report only once, unless otherwise requested within the
_Reporting Periodicity_ IE.
#### 8.4.10.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.4.10.3-1: Resource Status Reporting Initiation, unsuccessful
operation
If any of the requested measurements cannot be initiated, NG-RAN node~2~ shall
send the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value.
#### 8.4.10.4 Abnormal Conditions
For the same Measurement ID, if the initiating NG-RAN node~1~ does not receive
either the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message or the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE
message, the NG-RAN node~1~ may reinitiate the Resource Status Reporting
Initiation procedure towards the same NG-RAN node, provided that the content
of the new RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is identical to the content of the
previously unacknowledged RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message.
If the NG-RAN node**~2~** receives a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message which
includes the _Registration Request_ IE set to \"add\" or \"stop\" and if the
NG-RAN node**~2~** Measurement ID value received in the RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST message is not used, the NG-RAN node**~2~** shall initiate RESOURCE
STATUS FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value.
If the **_Report Characteristics_ IE bitmap is set to** \"**0** \" **(all bits
are set to** \"**0** \"**) in the** RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message **then**
NG-RAN node**~2~ shall initiate a** RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message with an
appropriate cause value.
If the NG-RAN node~2~ receives a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message which
includes the _Registration Request_ IE set to \"start\" and the _NG-RAN
node1Measurement ID_ IE corresponding to an existing on-going load measurement
reporting, **then** NG-RAN node**~2~ shall initiate a** RESOURCE STATUS
FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value.
### 8.4.11 Resource Status Reporting
#### 8.4.11.1 General
This procedure is initiated by an NG-RAN node to report the result of
measurements admitted by the NG-RAN node following a successful Resource
Status Reporting Initiation procedure.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.4.11.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.11.2-1: Resource Status Reporting, successful operation
NG-RAN node~2~ shall report the results of the admitted measurements in
RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message. The admitted measurements are the measurements
that were successfully initiated during the preceding Resource Status
Reporting Initiation procedure.

## 9.2 Information Element definitions
### 9.2.0 General
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit
strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of
the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to
the ordering of bits:
\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
\- When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the
bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.

The meaning of the different cause values is specified in the following table.
In general, \"not supported\" cause values indicate that the related
capability is missing. On the other hand, \"not available\" cause values
indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources
were available to perform the requested action.
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Radio Network Layer cause | Meaning | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Cell not Available | The concerned cell is not | | | available. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Handover Desirable for Radio | The reason for requesting | | Reasons | handover is radio related. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Handover Target not Allowed | Handover to the indicated target | | | cell is not allowed for the UE | | | in question. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Invalid AMF Set ID | The target NG-RAN node doesn't | | | belong to the same AMF Set of | | | the source NG-RAN node, i.e. NG | | | handovers should be attempted | | | instead. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | No Radio Resources Available in | The target cell doesn't have | | Target Cell | sufficient radio resources | | | available. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Partial Handover | Provides a reason for the | | | handover cancellation.

## 9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
### 9.3.1 General
XnAP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.680 [16] and ITU-T Rec. X.681
[17].
Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the XnAP protocol with ASN.1.
In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause
and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take
precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of
conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of XnAP messages.
XnAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for
that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by
ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall
construct an XnAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the
following additional rules:
\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.
\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall
appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there
is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements
reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears
as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may
contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE: In the above, \"IE\" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID.
If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different
occurrences have different IE IDs.
If an XnAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled
as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
### 9.3.2 Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
\- for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be
part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a
complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor
inter-operability.
\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such
functionality shall be standardised.
