# 4 Introduction
In Release 15 the basic support for URLLC was introduced with TTI structures
for low latency as well as methods for improved reliability. Further use cases
with tighter requirements have been identified as important for NR evolution,
in addition to the need for enhancing the Release 15 enabled use cases.
The follow key use cases were identified to be considered:
\- Release 15 enabled use case improvements
\- Such as AR/VR (Entertainment industry)
\- New Release 16 use cases with higher requirements
\- Factory automation
\- Transport Industry, including the remote driving use case
\- Electrical Power Distribution
The objective of this study item is to investigate enhancements to URLLC
(Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications), considering both FR1 and FR2 as
well as TDD and FDD, with the already existing solutions for NR as the
baseline. The TR reports the results and findings from the study item, mainly
on baseline performance achievable with Rel-15 NR URLLC, layer 1 enhancements
(including PDCCH enhancements, UCI enhancements, PUSCH enhancements and
enhancements to scheduling/HARQ/CSI processing timeline), UL inter UE Tx
prioritization/multiplexing and enhanced UL configured grant (grant free)
transmissions.
# 5 Baseline performance achievable with Rel-15 NR URLLC
## 5.1 Performance metric
The performance metric for the system level evaluations in this study item,
including evaluation of the baseline performance achievable with Rel-15 NR
URLLC and evaluation of the performance achievable with potential
enhancement(s) for Rel-16 URLLC, is either option 1 or option 2 as below:
\- **Option 1** : Percentage of users satisfying reliability and latency
requirements
\- Intend for the case with fixed number of UEs and fixed traffic model per UE
\- **Option 2** : URLLC capacity and URLLC/eMBB multiplexing capacity
\- Definition: URLLC system capacity is calculated as follows:
\- C(L, R) is the maximum offered cell load under which Y% of URLLC UEs in a
cell operate with target link reliability R under L latency bound
\- X= (100 -- Y) % is the percentage of UEs in outage
\- A UE in outage is defined as the UE cannot meet both latency L and link
reliability R bound
\- Companies report their assumption on X (either \~5% or 0%)
\- Companies report their assumption on the number of eMBB UEs deployed
together with the URLLC UEs
\- Intend for the case that the number of UEs and/or the data arrival rate is
adjustable
\- Adjusting the number of UEs should be applied to periodic deterministic
traffic model
## 5.2 Evaluation results and findings
One objective of this study item is to e**stablish the baseline performance
achievable with Release 15 URLLC** considering the prioritized URLLC use cases
(i.e. Rel-15 enabled use case, factory automation, transport industry and
electrical power distribution) [3]. This section presents the evaluation
results and the corresponding findings for each prioritized use case.
Throughout this section, unless otherwise noted, system-level simulation
assumptions in Appendix A.2 are assumed. Note that 5% Q-value (dB) is obtained
by system-level simulation assuming full buffer for a given evaluation
scenario.

As shown in section A.2.4, Rel-15 enabled use case with urban macro
(applicable data packet size 32 bytes and 200 bytes) and Rel-15 enabled use
case with indoor hot-spot are defined.
Four sources evaluate the baseline performance achievable with Rel-15 NR for
Rel-15 enabled use case with urban macro, with the evaluation results as shown
in Table 5.2.3-1.

ms) and reliability (i.e. 99.999%) requirements by Rel-15 NR is lower than 95%
with resource utilization of 3.2% or 6.4% for downlink transmission for Rel-15
enabled use case with urban macro assuming 10 URLLC users per cell, realistic
channel estimation, up to 4 Tx/4 Rx at gNB size and 2 Tx/4 Rx at the UE side,
700 MHz and FDD.
\- One source shows that the percentage of UEs satisfying the latency (i.e. 1
ms) and reliability (i.e. 99.999%) requirements by Rel-15 NR is lower than 95%
with resource utilization of 7.3% or 16.2% for uplink transmission for Rel-15
enabled use case with urban macro assuming 10 URLLC users per cell, realistic
channel estimation, up to 4 Tx/4 Rx at gNB size and 2 Tx/4 Rx at the UE side,
700 MHz and FDD.
\- One source shows that the percentage of UEs satisfying the latency (i.e. 1
ms) and reliability (i.e. 99.999%) requirements by Rel-15 NR is higher than
95% for both downlink and uplink transmission for Rel-15 enabled use case with
urban macro assuming 5 URLLC users per cell, ideal channel estimation, 8Tx/8Rx
at the gNB size and 2Tx/2Rx at the UE side, 4 GHz and FDD.

latency (i.e. 1 ms air interface latency) and reliability (i.e. 99.999%)
requirements by Rel-15 NR is lower than 95% for uplink transmission for Rel-15
enabled use case with urban macro assuming 10 URLLC users per cell, realistic
channel estimation, 4Rx at the gNB size and 1Tx at the UE side, 4 GHz and FDD.
\- One source (R1-1903449) shows that the percentage of UEs satisfying the
latency (i.e. 1 ms air interface latency) and reliability (i.e. 99.999%)
requirements by Rel-15 NR is lower than 95% for uplink transmission for Rel-15
enabled use case with urban macro assuming 10 URLLC users per cell, ideal

In addition, three sources (R1-1900170/R1-1900171, R1-1900976 and R1-1812996)
also evaluate the baseline performance achievable with Rel-15 NR for factory
automation from link level simulation perspective.
\- From link-level simulation perspective, reliability requirement of 99.9999%
within 1 ms one-way latency for factory automation for a single UE by Rel-15
NR URLLC can be achieved under some certain transmission configurations at
carrier frequency of 4 GHz.
\- From link-level simulation perspective, it seems challenging to meet the
reliability requirement of 99.9999% within 1 ms one-way latency for factory
automation for a single UE by Rel-15 NR URLLC with single-shot transmission at
least with duration less than 8os at carrier frequency of 30 GHz.
# 6 Layer 1 enhancements
## 6.1 PDCCH enhancements
### 6.1.1 Rel-15 NR PDCCH evaluation
PDCCH evaluations include evaluation of PDCCH reliability and evaluation of
PDCCH blocking. In order to investigate the necessity of potential PDCCH
enhancements for NR Rel-16 URLLC, Rel-15 NR PDCCH evaluations were performed.
**[Rel-15 NR PDCCH reliability]{.underline}**
For link-level PDCCH evaluation, the target operating BLER of DCI(s)
scheduling HARQ-less PDSCH/PUSCH should be smaller than 1e-x in Rel-16 NR
URLLC, at the 5%-tile SINR geometry, where x is the reliability requirement
given in the table of representative use case for evaluation as shown in Table
A.2-1, and the 5%-tile SINR geometry is obtained by system-level simulation
assuming full buffer for a given evaluation scenario.
16 sources evaluate PDCCH reliability with evaluation results as shown in
Table 6.1.1-1, where 14 sources provide the evaluation results on Rel-15 NR
PDCCH reliability.
\- For carrier frequency 4 GHz with antenna configuration of 4 Tx/4 Rx,
channel model of TDL-C 300 ns and a CORESET with 1 or 2 symbols, 6 sources
show that Rel-15 NR PDCCH (e.g. DCI payload size 40 bits and AL=16) can meet
the reliability of 99.9999% at the 5%-tile SINR geometry.
\- For carrier frequency 700MHz with antenna configuration of 2 Tx/2 Rx,
channel model of TDL-C 300 ns, 20 MHz and a CORESET with 2 symbols, six
sources show that Rel-15 NR PDCCH (e.g. DCI payload size 40 bits and AL=16)
can meet the reliability of 99.9999% at the 5%-tile SINR geometry, and two
sources show that Rel-15 NR PDCCH (e.g. DCI payload size 40 bits and AL=16)
cannot meet the reliability of 99.9999% at the 5%-tile SINR geometry.

### 6.1.2 Compact DCI
A DCI format with a size potentially smaller than that of DCI formats 0_0 and
1_0 is studied for scheduling URLLC data transmissions. Several aspects are
considered in this study including targeting a reduction of at least 10 to 16
bits for the DCI format size compared to the size of DCI formats 0_0 and 1_0,
the link level performance gain from PDCCH reliability perspective, PDCCH
resource utilization considering all UEs in the cell, PDCCH blocking
probability, performance impact to PDSCH/PUSCH capacity, impact on PDCCH blind
decoding and DCI size budget, and impact on PDSCH/PUSCH scheduling
flexibility. Note that it is concluded that there would be no change of DCI
format 0_0 and 1_0 in common search space in this study.
**[Link level performance gain from compact DCI]{.underline}**
As shown in Table 6.1.1-1, 12 sources evaluate the link level performance gain
from compact DCI.
\- Eight sources show that compact DCI targeting a reduction of 16 bits
compared to (e.g. 40 bits) Rel-15 DCI can provide 0.6dB \~ 1 dB gain for AL=16
assuming 4 GHz, 1e-5 or 1e-6 target BLER, 4 Rx at UE side, TDL-C and a CORESET
with 1 or 2 symbols in time domain and 40 MHz in frequency domain.
\- Three sources show that compact DCI targeting a reduction of 16 bits
compared to (e.g. 40 bits) Rel-15 DCI can provide 0.7dB \~ 1 dB gain for AL=16
assuming 700 MHz, 1e-6 target BLER, 2 Rx at UE side, TDL-C and a CORESET with
2 symbols in time domain and 20 MHz in frequency domain.
**[Evaluation on PDCCH resource utilization]{.underline}**
4 sources (R1-1900208, R1-1900043, R1-1900591 and R1-1900176) evaluate PDCCH
resource utilization of compact DCI, where the average number of CCEs derived
based on aggregation level distribution are compared between payload size of
40 and payload size of 24. The detailed evaluation results can be found in
Table 6.1.2-1.
\- Two sources show that compact DCI targeting a reduction of 16 bits compared
to (e.g. 40 bits) Rel-15 DCI can save 14 % \~ 20% PDCCH resource used for
URLLC UEs assuming 700 MHz, 1e-5 or 1e-6 target BLER for single PDCCH
transmission, 2 Rx at UE side, TDL-C and a CORESET with 2 symbols in time
domain, 20 MHz in frequency domain.
\- Three sources show that compact DCI targeting a reduction of 16 bits
compared to (e.g. 40 bits) Rel-15 DCI can save 14 % \~ 16% PDCCH resource used
for URLLC UEs assuming 4 GHz, 1e-5 or 1e-6 target BLER for single PDCCH
transmission, 4Tx/4Rx at gNB side and 4 Rx at UE side, TDL-C and a CORESET
with 1 or 2 symbols in time domain, 40 MHz in frequency domain.
\- One source shows that compact DCI targeting a reduction of 16 bits compared

UEs assuming 4 GHz, 1e-5 target BLER for single PDCCH transmission, 16 Tx/16
Rx at gNB side and 2 Tx/4 Rx at UE side for SINR CDF geometry, 2 Tx/4 Rx for

**[Evaluation on other aspects]{.underline}**
PDCCH evaluations on other aspects are also studied, e.g. PDCCH blocking and
impact on PDCCH blind decoding and/or DCI size budget. The summary of the
corresponding evaluation can be found in R1-1903532, which summarizes the
views and/or evaluations from companies.
**[Design of DCI format scheduling Rel-16 NR URLLC]{.underline}**
Design of DCI format scheduling Rel-16 NR URLLC are studied. The summary of
the candidate options and corresponding pros and cons can be found in
R1-1903532, which summarizes the views and/or evaluations from companies. It
is observed that the support of configurable sizes for some fields can provide
flexibility, enabling a DCI size target a reduction of 10\~16 bits less than
the DCI format size of Rel-15 fallback DCI can further ensure the requirement
of PDCCH reliability and may reduce PDCCH blocking, and providing the
possibility to align with the size of the Rel-15 fallback DCI (including
possible zero padding if any) can reduce the impact on blind decoding and/or
DCI size budget. It is concluded that for the DCI format(s) scheduling Rel-16
NR URLLC,
\- Support configurable sizes for some fields, while
\- The maximum DCI size can be larger than Rel-15 fallback DCI
\- The minimum DCI size target a reduction of 10\~16 bits less than the DCI
format size of Rel-15 fallback DCI
\- Provide the possibility to align with the size of the Rel-15 fallback DCI
(including possible zero padding if any)
\- Support potential reduction of the number of bits for at least one of the
following fields compared to Rel-15 DCI:
\- Frequency domain resource assignment
\- Time domain resource assignment
\- Modulation and coding scheme
\- HARQ process number
\- Redundancy version
\- PUCCH resource indicator
\- PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator
\- Downlink assignment index
\- Note that reduction of other fields are not precluded
\- Support at least one of the following configurable fields:
\- Antenna port(s) [0\~2 bits]
\- Transmission configuration indication [0\~3 bits]
\- Rate matching indicator [0\~2 bits]
\- SRS request [0\~3 bits]
\- PRB bundling size indicator [0\~1 bit]
\- Carrier indicator [0\~3 bits]
\- CSI request [0\~3 bit]
\- ZP CSI-RS triggering [0\~2 bits]
\- Beta offset indicator [0\~2 bits]
\- SRS resource indicator [0\~4 bits]
\- Repetition factor [0\~2 bits]
\- Priority indication [0\~3 bits]
\- Note: Other field(s) can be considered if needed
Note that the DCI format scheduling Rel-16 NR URLLC may or may not be new
format, which is to be finalized in the work item phase. The set of
configurable field(s) including bitwidths is to be finalized in work item
phase depending on DL assignment or UL grant. Note that the conclusion here on
DCI format scheduling Rel-16 NR URLLC doesn\'t imply the necessity to increase
the DCI size budget (i.e. \"3+1\") compared to Rel-15.
### 6.1.3 Increased PDCCH monitoring capability
Increased PDCCH monitoring capability is studied and identified to be
beneficial. However, it may increase UE complexity and thus some
restriction(s) may be needed. It is concluded to support increased PDCCH
monitoring capability on at least the maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs
per slot for channel estimation for Rel-16 NR URLLC for at least one SCS
subject to the following restrictions:
\- Explicit limitation on the maximum number of BDs/non-overlapping CCEs per
monitoring occasion and/or per monitoring span, and
\- The set of applicable SCS(s) to be finalized during the WI phase
\- Additional restrictions (e.g. impact on the number of CCs if any, potential
limitations on PDSCH/PUSCH processing, impact of wideband RS for CCE counting
if any, etc.) can be considered during the WI phase
Enhancements for PDCCH monitoring capability on the maximum number of
monitored PDCCH candidates per slot (with potential restrictions) for Rel-16
NR URLLC can be further considered in work item phase.
### 6.1.4 PDCCH repetition
PDCCH repetition is studied. The summary of analysis and evaluation on PDCCH
repetition can be found in R1-1901459, which summarizes the views from
companies. It is concluded that PDCCH repetition is not further considered in
this study item.
## 6.2 UCI enhancements
### 6.2.1 Enhanced HARQ feedback
Enhanced HARQ feedback are studied from several aspects, including enabling
more than one PUCCH for HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot and enabling
enhanced reporting procedure/feedback for HARQ-ACK.
#### 6.2.1.1 More than one PUCCH for HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot
In NR Rel-15, only one PUCCH for HARQ-ACK transmission is supported within a
slot. Enabling more than one PUCCH for HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot is
beneficial as it may enable fast HARQ-ACK feedback to reduce the latency and
facilitate separate HARQ-ACK feedback for URLLC and eMBB. It is concluded that
more than one PUCCH for HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot should be
supported in Rel-16.
#### 6.2.1.2 Enhanced reporting procedure/feedback for HARQ-ACK
Enhanced reporting procedure/feedback for HARQ-ACK are studied from several
aspects, including enhanced HARQ-ACK multiplexing on PUSCH and PUCCH and finer
indication for HARQ feedback timing (e.g. symbol-level or half-slot).
It is concluded that at least two HARQ-ACK codebooks can be simultaneously
constructed for a Rel-16 UE, intended for supporting different service types
for a UE. Rules for the two HARQ-ACK codebooks for supporting different
service types should be specified in R16, if the two HARQ-ACK codebooks are
due to be transmitted in resources overlapping in time. When at least two
HARQ-ACK codebooks are simultaneously constructed for supporting different
service types for a UE, a HARQ-ACK codebook can be identified based on some
PHY indications/properties.
### 6.2.2 Enhanced CSI feedback
Enhanced CSI feedback are studied from several aspects, including DMRS based
CSI measurement, A-CSI on PUCCH (e.g. triggering by DL assignment), enhanced
CSI reporting mode.
The following options have been identified as potential candidates for A-CSI
on PUCCH:
\- Option 1: A-CSI report on PUCCH triggered by DL-scheduling DCI
\- Option 2: A-CSI report on PUCCH based on group-common PDCCH
Regarding the benefit of A-CSI,
\- One source (R1-1902297) observed that compared to link adaptation only
using wideband CSI, 0.1% \~ 8.8% gain on average throughput and -0.7% \~ 20.1%
gain on 5% throughput can be obtained by using A-CSI for link adaptation,
depending on different cell loadings and code-book-based or ideal precoding is
assumed.
\- Two other sources questioned the value of A-CSI for URLLC considering
reliability of CSI reception and impact of measurement and quantization.
Regarding the performance gain of DMRS/PDSCH/PDCCH-based A-CSI measurement,
\- One source (R1-1901910) observed that CSI estimation based on DMRS+CSI-RS
showed 15% and 45% link-level spectrum efficiency improvement at SINR=10dB
over conventional CSI estimation based on CSI-RS, with 10 msec and 20 msec
reporting period respectively.
\- One source (R1-1903530) observed that the gain of DMRS/PDSCH/PDCCH-based is
beneficial in very limited cases (it depends on specific settings of packet
size, bandwidth, initial BLER, traffic pattern and load (e.g. in case of a
periodic traffic pattern, requests for initial transmissions from four UE\'s
arrive at the same OS from period to period. Each initial transmission have
BLER=3%)).
Regarding the performance gain of CSI-RS-based A-CSI reporting on PUCCH
triggered by DL-scheduling,
\- One source (R1-1903234) observed that 12.7% (with 100p/s packet frequency)
or 15.7% (with 200p/s packet frequency) more users can satisfy the 4 ms
latency over R15 P-CSI reporting, and 3.1% (with 100p/s packet frequency) or
9.4% (with 200p/s packet frequency) more users can satisfy the 4ms latency
requirement over R15 A-CSI reporting on PUSCH.
Regarding the benefits of the CQI report mode of wideband CQI combined with
worst-M CQI, one source evaluated and observed that it leads to reduction of
latency and BLER for 1^st^ transmission over standard frequency-selective CQI.
There is no consensus in RAN1 for supporting A-CSI on PUCCH in R16.
## 6.3 PUSCH enhancements
Whether to allow one PUSCH transmission instance to cross the slot boundary
when the remaining symbols within one slot is not enough for one PUSCH
transmission instance was studied. The conclusion is that one PUSCH
transmission instance is not allowed to cross the slot boundary for grant-
based PUSCH.
Potential enhancements for grant-based PUSCH and configured grant based PUSCH
are studied and the conclusion achieved in RAN1#95 meeting is to support at
least one of the following options:
\- Option 1 (Mini-slot level repetition): One UL grant scheduling two or more
PUSCH repetitions that can be in one slot, or across slot boundary in
consecutive available slots
\- Option 2 (Multi-segment transmission): One UL grant scheduling two or more
PUSCH repetitions in consecutive available slots, with one repetition in each
slot with possibly different starting symbols and/or durations
\- Option 3: N (N>=2) UL grants scheduling N PUSCH repetitions on consecutive
available slots, with one repetition in each slot, and the i-th UL grant can
be received before the end of the PUSCH transmission scheduled by the (i-1)th
UL grant
7 sources evaluated the performance of mini-slot level repetition and multi-
segment transmission by link level simulations for 4 GHz, with evaluation
results as shown in Table 6.3-1. In addition, one source evaluated the
performance of mini-slot level repetition and multi-segment transmission by
link level simulations for 30 GHz, with evaluation results as shown in Table
6.3-2.

Based on the discussion of the above option 1 and option 2, three more options
(i.e. option 4, option 5 and option 6) are added. It is concluded that the
details regarding how to use \"option 1\" vs. \"option 2\" is to be finalized
during the WI phase using options 4, 5 and 6 as a starting point.
More details of some of the options are provided in the following sections.
### 6.3.1 Option 1: Mini-slot level repetition
For time domain resource determination for mini-slot level repetition, for
grant based PUSCH, the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI
indicates the resource for the first repetition. The time domain resources for
the remaining repetitions are derived based at least on the resources for the
first repetition and the UL/DL direction of the symbols. Each repetition
occupies contiguous symbols.
For frequency hopping for mini-slot level repetition, support at least inter-
PUSCH-repetition hopping and inter-slot hopping.
### 6.3.2 Option 2: Multi-segment transmission
For time domain resource determination for multi-segment transmission, for
grant based PUSCH, the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI
indicates the starting symbol and the transmission duration of all the
repetitions.
For the transmission within one slot for multi-segment transmission, if there
are more than one UL period within a slot, where each UL period is the
duration of a set of contiguous symbols within a slot for potential UL
transmission as determined by the UE, one repetition is within one UL period
and each repetition occupies contiguous symbols. Otherwise, a single PUSCH
repetition is transmitted within a slot following Rel-15 behavior.
For frequency hopping for multi-segment transmission, support at least inter-
slot frequency hopping.
### 6.3.3 Option 4
One or more actual PUSCH repetitions in one slot, or two or more actual PUSCH
repetitions across slot boundary in consecutive available slots, is supported
using one UL grant for dynamic PUSCH, and one configured grant configuration
for configured grant PUSCH. It further consists of:
\- The number of the repetitions signalled by gNB represents the \"nominal\"
number of repetitions. The actual number of repetitions can be larger than the
nominal number.
\- FFS dynamically or semi-statically signalled for dynamic PUSCH and type 2
configured grant PUSCH
\- The time domain resource assignment (TDRA) field in the DCI or the TDRA
parameter in the type 1 configured grant indicates the resource for the first
\"nominal\" repetition.
\- The time domain resources for the remaining repetitions are derived based
at least on the resources for the first repetition and the UL/DL direction of
the symbols.
\- FFS the detailed interaction with the procedure of UL/DL direction
determination
\- If a \"nominal\" repetition goes across the slot boundary or DL/UL
switching point, this \"nominal\" repetition is splitted into multiple PUSCH
repetitions, with one PUSCH repetition in each UL period in a slot.
\- Handling of the repetitions under some conditions, e.g., when the duration
is too small due to splitting, is to be further investigated in the WI phase.
\- No DMRS sharing across multiple PUSCH repetitions
\- The maximum TBS size is not increased compared to Rel-15.
\- FFS: L > 14
\- S+L can be larger than 14
\- FFS: The bitwidth for TDRA is up to 4 bits.
\- Note: different repetitions may have the same or different RV.
Some examples of option 4 are shown in Figure 6.3.3-1.

### 6.3.4 Option 5
One or more actual PUSCH repetitions in one slot, or two or more actual PUSCH
repetitions across slot boundary in consecutive available slots, is supported
using one UL grant for dynamic PUSCH, and one configured grant configuration
for configured grant PUSCH. It further consists of:
\- The number of the repetitions signalled by gNB represents the \"nominal\"
number of repetitions. The actual number of repetitions can be larger or
smaller than the nominal number.
\- FFS dynamically or semi-statically signalled for dynamic PUSCH and type 2
configured grant PUSCH
\- The time domain resource assignment (TDRA) and the number of repetitions K
are used to determine the overall resources for all the repetitions (L*K).
\- If the overall resources go across the slot boundary or DL/UL switching
point, one repetition is transmitted in each UL period in a slot.
\- Otherwise, the nominal number of repetitions are transmitted, each
repetition with the transmission duration indicated in the TDRA.
\- The TDRA is indicated in the DCI for dynamic grant or type 2 configured
grant, or RRC configured for type 1 configured grant.
\- No DMRS sharing across multiple PUSCH repetitions
\- No special handling of orphan symbols
\- The maximum TBS size is not increased compared to Rel-15.

### 6.4.3 Non-periodic SR enhancement
A non-periodic SR scheme has been discussed in R1-1901589 and R1-1900015 for
latency reduction and overhead reduction.
# 7 UL inter UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing
## 7.1 Performance evaluation
Performance evaluations are performed to evaluate the enhanced UL inter UE Tx
prioritization/multiplexing mechanisms using Rel-15 mechanisms as the
performance benchmark. Requirements and assumptions given in Annex A are
considered for the evaluation of UL inter UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing
unless otherwise noted. Other factors such as overhead and capability are also
considered.
### 7.1.1 Link level simulation
3 sources evaluated the required SNR for single URLLC transmission with 1e-4
BLER target with evaluation results as shown in Table 7.1.1-1. Note that 1e-4
BLER target used here is only for evaluation comparison purpose because the
requirement of reliability is higher than 99.99% for most cases as shown in
Annex A.
\- For URLLC with low MCS level
\- Three sources (source 1/2/3 in Table 7.1.1-1) show 0.2dB\~1dB required SNR
loss for URLLC BLER target 1e-4 when URLLC PUSCH uses MCS#0 and collides with
another eMBB PUSCH transmission, compared to the baseline with URLLC only
PUSCH transmission using MCS#0, assuming MMSE-IRC receiver is used at the gNB
and 0dB power offset.
\- Two sources (source 2/3 in Table 7.1.1-1) show that the loss can be reduced
to 0.2dB\~0.5dB, when URLLC power is 3dB higher than eMBB
\- One source (source 1 in Table 7.1.1-1) shows that the loss can be
negligible if MMSE-SIC receiver is used at the gNB (eMBB and URLLC are decoded
with two hypothesis) and 0 dB power offset assuming orthogonal DMRS between
eMBB and URLLC
\- One source (source 5 in Table 7.1.1-1) observed 1.5dB required SNR loss for
URLLC BLER target 10^-4^ when URLLC PUSCH uses MCS#3 and collides with another
eMBB PUSCH transmission, compared to the baseline with URLLC only PUSCH
transmission using MCS#3, assuming MMSE-IRC receiver is used at the gNB and
0dB power offset, and the loss can be reduced to 0.7dB when URLLC power is 3dB
higher than eMBB.
\- For URLLC with medium MCS level
\- Three sources (source 2/3/4 in Table 7.1.1-1) show 1.8dB\~6dB required SNR
loss for URLLC BLER target 1e-4 when URLLC PUSCH uses MCS#6 and collides with
another eMBB PUSCH transmission, compared to the baseline with URLLC only
PUSCH transmission using MCS#6, assuming MMSE-IRC receiver (source 2/3 in
Table 7.1.1-1) or MMSE receiver (source 4 in Table 7.1.1-1) is used at the gNB
\- Two sources (source 2/3 in Table 7.1.1-1) show that the loss can be reduced
to 0.4dB\~2dB, when URLLC power is 3dB higher than eMBB
\- One source (source 4 in Table 7.1.1-1) observed the loss cannot be reduced
if MMSE-SIC receiver is used assuming case 1 DMRS assumption between eMBB and
URLLC.
\- For URLLC with higher MCS level
\- One source (source 1 in Table 7.1.1-1) shows about 3.2dB required SNR loss
for URLLC BLER target 1e-4 when URLLC PUSCH uses MCS#14 and collides with
another eMBB PUSCH transmission using MCS#14 or 23 (for the higher SE table),
compared to the baseline with URLLC only PUSCH transmission using MCS#14,
assuming MMSE receiver is used at the gNB and 0dB power offset
\- One source (source 1 in Table 7.1.1-1) shows that when no power offset is
applied to the URLLC, if MMSE-SIC receiver is used at the gNB (eMBB and URLLC
are decoded with two hypothesis), the loss can be reduced to 0.5dB for the
case with URLLC MCS#14 and eMBB MCS#14, assuming orthogonal DMRS between eMBB
and URLLC. However, the loss cannot be reduced by MMSE-SIC receiver for the
case with URLLC MCS#14 and eMBB MCS#23
\- Two sources (source 3/5 in Table 7.1.1-1) shows that URLLC error floor at
10^-1\~^10^-3^ when URLLC PUSCH uses MCS#10 or 14 and collides with another
eMBB PUSCH transmission using 16QAM or 64 QAM, compared to the baseline with
URLLC only PUSCH transmission using MCS#10 or 14, assuming
MMSE[-IRC]{.underline} receiver is used at the gNB and 0dB or 3dB power offset
between URLLC and eMBB
Note that for SIC receiver, if eMBB transmission ends later than URLLC, the
latency performance of URLLC may be impacted if the eMBB is decoded first. In
Table 7.1.1-1 and Table 7.1.1-2, case-1 DMRS assumption means orthogonal DMRS
for the collided users and no interference on DMRS of one UE caused by data
from another colliding UE, case-2 DMRS assumption means there is interference
on DMRS of one UE caused by data from another colliding UE.
3 sources evaluated the required SNR for single eMBB transmission with 1e-1
BLER target with evaluation results as shown in Table 7.1.1-2.
\- For eMBB with low MCS level (QPSK modulation)
\- Two sources (source 1/3 in Table 7.1.1-2) show up to 0.5dB required SNR
loss for eMBB BLER target 1e-1 when eMBB PUSCH uses MCS#0 or 2 and collides
with another URLLC PUSCH transmission, compared to the baseline with eMBB only
PUSCH transmission assuming MMSE-IRC (source 1 in Table 7.1.1-2) or MMSE
(source 3 in Table 7.1.1-2) receiver is used at the gNB and 0dB power offset.
\- One source (source 1 in Table 7.1.1-2) shows that the loss can be
negligible, if MMSE-SIC receiver (eMBB and URLLC are decoded with two
hypothesis) is used assuming case-1 DMRS between eMBB and URLLC.
\- One source (source 3 in Table 7.1.1-2) shows that 0.3dB\~2dB required SNR
loss for eMBB BLER target 1e-1 when eMBB PUSCH uses MCS#6 and collides with
another URLLC PUSCH transmission, compared to the baseline with eMBB only
PUSCH transmission assuming MMSE receiver is used at the gNB and 0dB power
offset.
\- For eMBB with higher MCS level (16QAM or 64QAM)
\- Three sources (source 1/13/19 in Table 7.1.1-2) show that 0.9dB\~1.6dB
required SNR loss for eMBB BLER target 1e-1 when eMBB PUSCH uses MCS#10, 12,
14 or 23 and collides with another URLLC PUSCH transmission, compared to the
baseline with eMBB only PUSCH transmission assuming MMSE-IRC receiver (source
1/19 in Table 7.1.1-2) or MMSE receiver (source 13 in Table 7.1.1-2) is used
at the gNB and 0dB power offset. Another source (source 2 in Table 7.1.1-2)
observed 8dB loss. One source (source 19 in Table 7.1.1-2) observed 2.5dB loss
for eMBB when URLLC has 3dB higher power than eMBB. One source (source 19 in
Table 7.1.1-2) observed eMBB error floor, (i.e. 10^-1^ BLER cannot be reached)
when eMBB using MCS#12 has a full bandwidth collision with URLLC using MCS#3
during 2 OFDM symbols.
\- Two sources (source 1/13 in Table 7.2.1-2) show that the loss can be
reduced to 0.2\~0.3dB, if MMSE-SIC receiver is used at the gNB (eMBB and URLLC
are decoded with two hypothesis), assuming case-1 DMRS between eMBB and URLLC.

In addition, three sources (R1-1902129, R1-1902420 and R1-1903008) provided
the link level evaluation for the signalling of UL cancelation.
### 7.1.2 System level simulation
8 sources performed system-level simulation on the potential enhancements with
evaluation results as shown in Table 7.1.2-1.
\- From URLLC perspective
\- Comparing the potential enhancements with Rel-15 baseline scheme
\- Two sources (source 2/7 in Table 7.1.2-1) show better URLLC performance
(URLLC capacity or percentage of URLLC UEs satisfying the requirement) in UMa
scenario for UL cancelation scheme, compared to a Rel-15 baseline scheme using
semi-static power setting of eMBB and URLLC. One source (source 5 in Table
7.1.2-1) shows almost the same performance between the two cases. One source
(source 7 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows degraded URLLC performance (percentage of
URLLC UEs satisfying the requirement) in InH scenario for UL cancelation
scheme, compared to a Rel-15 baseline case where URLLC has 8dB higher power
than eMBB using semi-static power setting.
\- One source(source 3 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows better URLLC performance (URLLC
capacity or percentage of URLLC UEs satisfying the requirement) for the
potential enhanced schemes (i.e. UL cancellation and enhanced dynamic power
control), compared to a Rel-15 baseline scheme using orthogonal scheduling of
eMBB and URLLC in UMa scenario. One source (source 1 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows
almost the same URLLC performance for enhanced schemes compared to a Rel-15
baseline scheme using orthogonal scheduling of eMBB and URLL in UMa scenario.
\- Two sources (source 6/7 in Table 7.1.2-1) show that 100% URLLC UE
satisfying the requirement can only be achieved when the URLLC traffic load is
low and the colliding eMBB transmission power is 5dB or 8dB lower than URLLC
using semi-static power setting, while for higher URLLC traffic loads, source
6 shows that it is not possible to reach the URLLC performance requirement
without removing the colliding eMBB transmission.
\- One source (source 4 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows almost the same URLLC
performance for enhanced schemes, compared to a Rel-15 baseline using TPC. The
percentage of packets satisfying reliability and latency requirements is used
as the URLLC performance metric, which is different from the agreed URLLC
performance metric option 1 or option 2 as shown in section 5.1.
\- Comparing UL cancelation scheme and enhanced power control scheme
\- One source (source 3 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows better URLLC performance
(URLLC capacity or percentage of URLLC UEs satisfying the requirement) for UL
cancelation scheme than enhanced dynamic power control scheme using enhanced
TPC range of up to 6 dB. The URLLC performance metric include throughput or
percentage of URLLC UEs fulfilling the requirement.
\- One source (source 1 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows almost the same URLLC
performance (percentage of URLLC UEs satisfying the requirement) between UL
cancelation scheme and enhanced UL power control scheme. In the evaluation by
source 1, the enhanced UL power control is such that URLLC is always power
boosted by 6dB higher than eMBB since eMBB and URLLC are assumed to always
collide in the evaluation.
\- From eMBB perspective
\- Comparing the potential enhancements with Rel-15 baseline scheme
\- Two sources (source 1/3/7 in Table 7.1.2-1) show degraded eMBB throughput
in UMa scenario for UL cancelation, compared to orthogonal scheduling of eMBB
and URLLC when TB-level retransmission is used for eMBB.
\- One (source 3 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows degraded eMBB throughput in UMa
scenario for enhanced dynamic power control using enhanced TPC range of up to
6 dB, compared to Rel-15 baseline.
\- One source (source 7 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows improved eMBB throughput in
InH scenario for UL cancelation with CBG-level retransmission, compared to
Rel-15 baseline using orthogonal scheduling of eMBB and URLLC, or semi-static
power setting.
\- One source (source 7 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows improved eMBB throughput in
UMa scenario for UL cancelation with CBG-level retransmission, compared to
semi-static power setting.
\- Comparing UL cancelation scheme and enhanced power control scheme
\- One sources (source 1 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows better eMBB throughput for
enhanced dynamic power control, compared to UL cancelation. In the evaluation
by source 1, then enhanced UL power control is such that URLLC is always power
boosted by 6 dB higher than eMBB since eMBB and URLLC are assumed to always
collide in the evaluation.
\- One source (source 3 in Table 7.1.2-1) shows better eMBB throughput for UL
cancelation, compared to enhanced dynamic power control, using enhanced TPC
range of up to 6 dB.
Note that in the above observations, the corresponding additional overhead to
support the enhanced scheme(s) was not reported.

## 7.2 Potential enhancements
In the following sub-sections, potential enhancements for UL inter UE Tx
prioritization/multiplexing are presented. It is recommended to specify both
UL cancelation scheme and enhanced UL power control scheme in the work item
phase.
### 7.2.1 UE UL cancelation mechanisms
UE UL cancelation mechanisms are considered as one potential enhancement for
UL inter-UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing and are studied from several
aspects, including the potential mechanisms (e.g. UE UL cancelation/pausing
indication, UL continuation indication, UL re-scheduling indication), physical
channel/signal used for the UL cancelation indication, UE processing timeline
for the UL cancelation indication, UE monitoring behaviours for the UL
cancelation indication, UE PDCCH monitoring capability if the UL cancelation
indication is by PDCCH, methods to ensure the reliability of the indication
for UE UL cancelation.
Either PDCCH or sequence can be considered as potential options for the UL
cancelation indication. If PDCCH is used, either group common DCI or UE-
specific DCI can be considered as potential options. If sequence is used,
either group common sequence or UE-specific sequence can be considered.
The monitoring periodicity for the UL cancelation indication should be
configurable by the gNB and UE supporting UL cancelation indication should be
able to support more than one monitoring occasions for the UL cancelation
indication in a slot. If PDCCH is used, whether the UE PDCCH monitoring
capability (number of CCEs/BDs per slot) should be increased is to be further
investigated.
The UE processing time for UL cancelation indication should be equal or
shorter than N2 defined in Rel-15 UE capability#2.
Upon detecting an UL cancelation indication, UE cancels the corresponding UL
transmission. The corresponding UL transmission may include an on-going UL
transmission, or an UL transmission that has not been started. After
cancelation, the UE may resume the transmission afterwards as one option, or
may not resume the transmission afterwards as another option.
### 7.2.2 Enhanced UL power control
Enhanced UL power control is considered as one potential enhancement for UL
inter-UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing and the study mainly focuses on
enhanced dynamic power boost for URLLC UE, including dynamic change of power
control parameters (e.g. P0 and alpha without SRI configured) and enhanced TPC
(e.g. increased TPC range and finer granularity). The need of URLLC UE power
change during one transmission instance is not envisioned. It is assumed that
there is no change of eMBB UE power control scheme in this study item.
Enhanced dynamic power boost for URLLC UE are studied from several aspects,
including feasibility of boosting UE power in power limited or interference
limited scenarios, physical channel/signal used for the signalling, UE
processing timeline for the signalling, UE monitoring behaviours for the
signalling, UE PDCCH monitoring capability if the signalling is by PDCCH and
methods to ensure the reliability of the signalling.
It is concluded that the potential enhanced UL power control may include UE
determining the power control parameter set (e.g. P0, alpha) based on
scheduling DCI indication without using SRI, or based on group-common DCI
indication. Increased TPC range compared to Rel-15 may also be considered.
Power boosting is not applicable to power limited UEs.
# 8 Enhanced UL configured grant (grant free) transmissions
## 8.1 Performance evaluation
Requirements and assumptions given in Annex A are considered for the
evaluation of enhanced UL configured grant (grant free) transmissions.
As discussed in section 8.2.4, link-level simulation evaluations are performed
to evaluate gNB\'s missed detection performance, with evaluation results as
shown in Table 8.1-1 below. The corresponding observations can be found in
section 8.2.4.

## 8.2 Potential enhancements
In the following sub-sections, potential enhancements for UL configured grant
(grant free) transmissions are presented.
Whether to allow one PUSCH transmission instance to cross the slot boundary
when the remaining symbols within one slot is not enough for one PUSCH
transmission instance was studied. The conclusion is that one PUSCH
transmission instance is not allowed to cross the slot boundary for UL
configured grant transmission.
### 8.2.1 Multiple active configured grants
Multiple active configured grants for a BWP of a serving cell are studied. It
is concluded that multiple active configured grant configurations for a given
BWP of a serving cell should be supported at least for different
services/traffic types and/or for enhancing reliability and reducing latency.
Potential specification impacts for both type 1 and type 2 grant free
transmission are studied from several aspects, including
activation/deactivation mechanism for type 2 grant free transmission, support
of repetitions with multiple configurations for a BWP of a serving cell.
As to repetitions with multiple configurations for a BWP of a serving cell, it
is concluded that in Rel-16, for both Type 1 and Type 2 configured grant and
when multiple active configurations are configured in a BWP, transmission of a
TB based on the configured grant is associated with a single active
configuration, even if the transmission is repeated.
### 8.2.2 Enhancing reliability and reducing latency
Mechanisms to ensure a sufficient number of repetitions to meet the latency
and reliability requirements were studied, including multiple active
configured grant configurations for a BWP of a serving cell and repetition(s)
across the boundary of a period P. **Multiple configured grant configurations
has been considered to be used for enhancing reliability and reducing latency.
In addition, using single configured grant configuration to enhance
reliability and reduce latency was discussed and may be further considered.**
### 8.2.3 PUSCH repetitions within a slot for grant free transmission
It is understood that the potential enhancements for dynamically scheduled
PUSCH and configured grant PUSCH should be studied jointly. Details can be
found in section 6.3.
### 8.2.4 Explicit HARQ-ACK for UL configured grant transmission
gNB\'s missed detection performance of the PUSCH under configured grant is
considered as one aspect for evaluating whether to support explicit HARQ-ACK
for UL configured grant transmission, with a set of parameters to be reported
by companies for the study, including false alarm target, DMRS configuration
assumptions, the number of Tx/Rx and the number of UEs sharing the
time/frequency-domain grant free resource. The simulation results are shown in
section 8.1.
It is observed that PUSCH miss detection performance highly depends on the
PUSCH configurations such as DMRS configuration, resource allocation and
false-alarm target setting.
If a configured grant PUSCH resource is not shared by multiple UEs, 8 sources
(R1-1900075, R1-1902007, R1-1900132, R1-1902396, R1-1900498, R1-1903009,
R1-1900974, R1-1903502) show that if the reliability requirement is to be met
by a single transmission, PUSCH miss detection probability is lower than the
PUSCH target BLER under the respective evaluation assumptions (e.g. MCS
levels, etc.).
If the overall PUSCH BLER target requirement is to be met by uplink grant
based HARQ re-transmission for the configured grant PUSCH, the BLER of the
configured grant PUSCH transmission can be higher than the overall PUSCH BLER
target such that the residual BLER after the re-transmission achieves the
overall PUSCH BLER target. However, even in this case, miss detection
probability for configured grant PUSCH should not be higher than the overall
PUSCH BLER target.
It is concluded that there is no consensus on the necessity of explicit HARQ-
ACK for configured grant PUSCH for this study item.
# 9 Conclusion and recommendation
## 9.1 Conclusion
**[PDCCH enhancements]{.underline}**
For the DCI format(s) scheduling Rel-16 NR URLLC, it is identified to be
beneficial to support configurable sizes for some fields and potential
reduction of the number of bits for some field(s) compared to Rel-15 DCI, to
enable a minimum DCI size target a reduction of 10\~16 bits less than the DCI
format size of Rel-15 fallback DCI, and to provide the possibility to align
with the size of the Rel-15 fallback DCI. The maximum DCI size can be larger
than Rel-15 fallback DCI. It is also concluded on the potential list of fields
with reduction of the number of bits and the potential list of configurable
fields.
Increased PDCCH monitoring capability is identified to be beneficial while it
may increase UE complexity. It is concluded to support increased PDCCH
monitoring capability on at least the maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs
per slot for channel estimation for Rel-16 NR URLLC for at least one SCS
subject to some restrictions as shown in section 6.1.3. Enhancements for PDCCH
monitoring capability on the maximum number of monitored PDCCH candidates per
slot (with potential restrictions) for Rel-16 NR URLLC can be further
considered in work item phase.
It is concluded that PDCCH repetition is not further considered in this study
item.
**[UCI enhancements]{.underline}**
Enabling more than one PUCCH for HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot is
identified to be beneficial and it is concluded that more than one PUCCH for
HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot should be supported in Rel-16.
Intended for supporting different service types for a UE, it is concluded that
at least two HARQ-ACK codebooks can be simultaneously constructed for a Rel-16
UE. Rules for the HARQ-ACK codebooks for supporting different service types
should be specified in Rel-16, if at least two HARQ-ACK codebooks are due to
be transmitted in resources overlapping in time. When at least two HARQ-ACK
codebooks are simultaneously constructed for supporting different service
types for a UE, a HARQ-ACK codebook can be identified based on some PHY
indications/properties.
Enhanced CSI feedback is studied with observations as shown in section 6.2.2.
There is no consensus in RAN1 for supporting A-CSI on PUCCH in Rel-16.
**[PUSCH enhancements]{.underline}**
It is identified to be beneficial to support enhancements for both grant-based
PUSCH and configured grant based PUSCH in Rel-16, to enable one UL grant
scheduling two or more PUSCH repetitions that can be in one slot, or across
slot boundary in consecutive available slots. Candidate solutions are as shown
in section 6.3. It is concluded to finalize the details regarding how to use
\"option 1\" vs. \"option 2\" during the work item phase using option 4, 5 and
6 as shown in section 6.3 as a starting point.
**[Enhancements to scheduling/HARQ/CSI processing timeline]{.underline}**
Enhancements to scheduling/HARQ processing timeline are studied with
conclusions as provided in section 6.4.1.4.
Out-of-order HARQ and scheduling is studied and is identified to be
beneficial. It is concluded to support out-of-order HARQ-ACK and out-of-order
PUSCH scheduling as defined in section 6.4.2.
**[Inter UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing]{.underline}**
It is identified to be beneficial to support enhancements for inter UE Tx
prioritization/multiplexing, and it is recommended to support UL cancelation
scheme and enhanced UL power control scheme in Rel-16.
**[Configured grant transmission]{.underline}**
Multiple active configured grants for a BWP of a serving cell is identified to
be beneficial. It is concluded that multiple active configured grant
configurations for a given BWP of a serving cell should be supported at least
for different services/traffic types and/or for enhancing reliability and
reducing latency. As to repetitions with multiple configurations for a BWP of
a serving cell, it is concluded that transmission of a TB based on the
configured grant is associated with a single active configuration for both
Type 1 and Type 2 configured grant and when multiple active configurations are
configured in a BWP in Rel-16, even if the transmission is repeated.
It is concluded that there is no consensus on the necessity of explicit HARQ-
ACK for configured grant PUSCH for this study item.
## 9.2 Recommendation
For PDCCH enhancement, it is recommended to support the following in Rel-16:
\- DCI format(s) with configurable sizes for some fields and potential
reduction of the number of bits for some field(s) compared to Rel-15 DCI,
while enabling the minimum DCI size target a reduction of 10\~16 bits less
than the DCI format size of Rel-15 fallback DCI and the maximum DCI size can
be larger than Rel-15 fallback DCI, and provide the possibility to align with
the size of the Rel-15 fallback DCI (including possible zero padding if any).
\- Increased PDCCH monitoring capability on at least the maximum number of
non-overlapped CCEs per slot for channel estimation for Rel-16 NR URLLC for at
least one SCS subject to some restrictions, including at least explicit
limitation on the maximum number of BDs/non-overlapping CCEs per monitoring
occasion and/or per monitoring span, and the set of applicable SCS(s).
For UCI enhancement, it is recommended to support the followings in Rel-16:
\- More than one PUCCH for HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot.
\- At least two HARQ-ACK codebooks can be simultaneously constructed for a
Rel-16 UE, intended for supporting different service types for a UE.
For PUSCH enhancements, it is recommended to support enhancements for both
grant-based PUSCH and configured grant based PUSCH in Rel-16, to enable one UL
grant scheduling two or more PUSCH repetitions that can be in one slot, or
across slot boundary in consecutive available slots.
For enhancements to scheduling/HARQ, it is recommended to support the
following in Rel-16:
\- Out-of-order HARQ-ACK: HARQ-ACK associated with the second PDSCH with HARQ
process ID x received after the first PDSCH with HARQ process ID y (x != y)
can be sent before the HARQ-ACK of the first PDSCH on the active BWP of a
given serving cell
\- Out-of-order PUSCH scheduling: A UE can be scheduled with a second PUSCH
associated with HARQ process x starting earlier than the ending symbol of the
first PUSCH associated with HARQ process y (x != y) with a PDCCH that does not
end earlier than the ending symbol of first scheduling PDCCH on the active BWP
of a given serving cell
For inter UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing, it is recommended to support UL
cancelation scheme and enhanced UL power control scheme in Rel-16.
For enhanced UL configured grant transmission, it is recommended to support
multiple active configured grant type 1 and type 2 configurations for a given
BWP of a serving cell in Rel-16.
