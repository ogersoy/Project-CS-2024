# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the stage 2 of the UE Positioning function of
NG-RAN which provides the mechanisms to support or assist the calculation of
the geographical position of a UE. UE position knowledge can be used, for
example, in support of Radio Resource Management functions, as well as
location-based services for operators, subscribers, and third-party service
providers. The purpose of this stage 2 specification is to define the NG-RAN
UE Positioning architecture, functional entities and operations to support
positioning methods. This description is confined to the NG-RAN Access
Stratum. It does not define or describe how the results of the UE position
calculation can be utilised in the Core Network (e.g., LCS) or in NG-RAN
(e.g., RRM).
UE Positioning may be considered as a network-provided enabling technology
consisting of standardised service capabilities that enable the provision of
location applications. The application(s) may be service provider specific.
The description of the numerous and varied possible location applications
which are enabled by this technology is outside the scope of the present
document. However, clarifying examples of how the functionality being
described may be used to provide specific location services may be included.
This stage 2 specification covers the NG-RAN positioning methods, state
descriptions, and message flows to support UE Positioning.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
As used in this document, the suffixes \"-based\" and \"-assisted\" refer
respectively to the node that is responsible for making the positioning
calculation (and which may also provide measurements) and a node that provides
measurements (but which does not make the positioning calculation). Thus, an
operation in which measurements are provided by the UE to the LMF to be used
in the computation of a position estimate is described as \"UE-assisted\" (and
could also be called \"LMF-based\"), while one in which the UE computes its
own position is described as \"UE-based\".

# 4 Main concepts and requirements
## 4.1 Assumptions and Generalities
The stage 1 description of LCS at the service level is provided in TS 22.071
[3]; the stage 2 LCS functional description, including the LCS system
architecture and message flows, is provided in TS 23.501 [2], TS 23.502 [26]
and TS 23.273 [35].
Positioning functionality provides a means to determine the geographic
position and/or velocity of the UE based on measuring radio signals. The
position information may be requested by and reported to a client (e.g., an
application) associated with the UE, or by a client within or attached to the
core network. The position information shall be reported in standard formats,
such as those for cell-based or geographical co-ordinates, together with the
estimated errors (uncertainty) of the position and velocity of the UE and, if
available, the positioning method (or the list of the methods) used to obtain
the position estimate.
Restrictions on the geographic shape encoded within the \'position
information\' parameter may exist for certain LCS client types. The 5GS,
including NG-RAN, shall comply with any shape restrictions defined in 5GS and,
in a particular country, with any shape restrictions defined for a specific
LCS client type in relevant national standards. For example, in the US,
national standard J-STD-036-C-2 restricts the geographic shape for an
emergency services LCS client to minimally either an \"ellipsoid point\" or an
\"ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle\" as defined in TS 23.032 [4].
It shall be possible for the majority of the UEs within a network to use the
LCS feature without compromising the radio transmission or signalling
capabilities of the NG-RAN.
The uncertainty of the position measurement shall be network-implementation-
dependent, at the choice of the network operator. The uncertainty may vary
between networks as well as from one area within a network to another. The
uncertainty may be hundreds of metres in some areas and only a few metres in
others. In the event that a particular position measurement is provided
through a UE-assisted process, the uncertainty may also depend on the
capabilities of the UE. In some jurisdictions, there is a regulatory
requirement for location service accuracy that is part of an emergency
service. Further details of the accuracy requirements can be found in TS
22.071 [3].
The uncertainty of the position information is dependent on the method used,
the position of the UE within the coverage area and the activity of the UE.
Several design options of the NG-RAN system (e.g., size of cell, adaptive
antenna technique, pathloss estimation, timing accuracy, ng-eNB and gNB
surveys) shall allow the network operator to choose a suitable and cost-
effective UE positioning method for their market.
There are many different possible uses for the positioning information. The
positioning functions may be used internally by the 5GS, by value-added
network services, by the UE itself or through the network, and by \"third
party\" services. The feature may also be used by an emergency service (which
may be mandated or \"value-added\"), but the location service is not
exclusively for emergencies.
Design of the NG-RAN positioning capability as documented in this
specification includes position methods, protocols and procedures that are
either adapted from capabilities already supported for E-UTRAN, UTRAN and
GERAN, or created separately from first principles. In contrast to GERAN and
UTRAN but similarly to E-UTRAN, the NG-RAN positioning capabilities are
intended to be forward compatible to other access types and other position
methods, in an effort to reduce the amount of additional positioning support
needed in the future. This goal also extends to user plane location solutions
such as OMA SUPL ([15], [16]), for which NG-RAN positioning capabilities are
intended to be compatible where appropriate.
As a basis for the operation of UE Positioning in NG-RAN, the following
assumptions apply:
\- both TDD and FDD will be supported;
\- the provision of the UE Positioning function in NG-RAN and 5GC is optional
through support of the specified method(s) in the ng-eNB, gNB and the LMF;
\- UE Positioning is applicable to any target UE, whether or not the UE
supports LCS, but with restrictions on the use of certain positioning methods
depending on UE capability (e.g. as defined within the LPP protocol);
\- the positioning information may be used for internal system operations to
improve system performance;
\- the UE Positioning architecture and functions shall include the option to
accommodate several techniques of measurement and processing to ensure
evolution to follow changing service requirements and to take advantage of
advancing technology.
## 4.2 Role of UE Positioning Methods
The NG-RAN may utilise one or more positioning methods in order to determine
the position of an UE.
Positioning the UE involves two main steps:
\- signal measurements; and
\- position estimate and optional velocity computation based on the
measurements.
The signal measurements may be made by the UE or by the serving ng-eNB or gNB.
The basic signals measured for terrestrial position methods are typically the
LTE or NR radio transmissions; however, other methods may make use of other
transmissions such as general radio navigation signals including those from
Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSSs).
The positioning function should not be limited to a single method or
measurement. That is, it should be capable of utilising other standard methods
and measurements, as such methods and measurements are available and
appropriate, to meet the required service needs of the location service
client. This additional information could consist of readily available E-UTRAN
or NG-RAN measurements.
The position estimate computation may be made by the UE or by the LMF.
## 4.3 Standard UE Positioning Methods
### 4.3.1 Introduction
The standard positioning methods supported for NG-RAN access are:
\- network-assisted GNSS methods;
\- observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA) positioning based on LTE
signals;
\- enhanced cell ID methods based on LTE signals;
\- WLAN positioning;
\- Bluetooth positioning;
\- terrestrial beacon system (TBS) positioning;
\- sensor based methods:
\- barometric Pressure Sensor;
\- motion sensor.
\- NR enhanced cell ID methods (NR E-CID) based on NR signals;
\- Multi-Round Trip Time Positioning (Multi-RTT based on NR signals);
\- Downlink Angle-of-Departure (DL-AoD) based on NR signals;
\- Downlink Time Difference of Arrival (DL-TDOA) based on NR signals;
\- Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (UL-TDOA) based on NR signals;
\- Uplink Angle-of-Arrival (UL-AoA), including A-AoA and Z-AoA based on NR
signals.
Hybrid positioning using multiple methods from the list of positioning methods
above is also supported.
Standalone mode (e.g. autonomous, without network assistance) using one or
more methods from the list of positioning methods above is also supported.
These positioning methods may be supported in UE-based, UE-assisted/LMF-based,
and NG-RAN node assisted versions. Table 4.3.1-1 indicates which of these
versions are supported in this version of the specification for the
standardised positioning methods.

Sensor, WLAN, Bluetooth, and TBS positioning methods based on MBS signals are
also supported in standalone mode, as described in the corresponding clauses.
### 4.3.2 Network-assisted GNSS methods
These methods make use of UEs that are equipped with radio receivers capable
of receiving GNSS signals. In 3GPP specifications the term GNSS encompasses
both global and regional/augmentation navigation satellite systems.
Examples of global navigation satellite systems include GPS, Modernized GPS,
Galileo, GLONASS, and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). Regional
navigation satellite systems include Quasi Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)
while the many augmentation systems, listed in 8.1.1, are classified under the
generic term of Space Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) and provide regional
augmentation services.
In this concept, different GNSSs (e.g. GPS, Galileo, etc.) can be used
separately or in combination to determine the location of a UE.
The operation of the network-assisted GNSS methods is described in clause 8.1.
### 4.3.3 OTDOA positioning
The OTDOA positioning method makes use of the measured timing of downlink
signals received from multiple TPs, comprising eNBs, ng-eNBs and PRS-only TPs,
at the UE. The UE measures the timing of the received signals using assistance
data received from the positioning server, and the resulting measurements are
used to locate the UE in relation to the neighbouring TPs.
The operation of the OTDOA method is described in clause 8.2.
### 4.3.4 Enhanced Cell ID methods
In the Cell ID (CID) positioning method, the position of an UE is estimated
with the knowledge of its serving ng-eNB, gNB and cell. The information about
the serving ng-eNB, gNB and cell may be obtained by paging, registration, or
other methods.
Enhanced Cell ID (E‑CID) based on LTE signals positioning refers to techniques
which use additional UE measurements and/or NG-RAN radio resource and other
measurements to improve the UE location estimate. In the case of a serving ng-
eNB, uplink E-CID may be supported based on NR, GERAN, UTRA or WLAN signals.
Although E-CID based on LTE signals positioning may utilise some of the same
measurements as the measurement control system in the RRC protocol, the UE
generally is not expected to make additional measurements for the sole purpose
of positioning; i.e., the positioning procedures do not supply a measurement
configuration or measurement control message, and the UE reports the
measurements that it has available rather than being required to take
additional measurement actions.
In cases with a requirement for close time coupling between UE and ng-eNB
measurements (e.g., T~ADV~ type 1 and UE E-UTRA Rx-Tx time difference), the
ng-eNB configures the appropriate RRC measurements and is responsible for
maintaining the required coupling between the measurements.
The operation of the Enhanced Cell ID based on LTE signals method is described
in clause 8.3.
### 4.3.5 Barometric pressure sensor positioning
The barometric pressure sensor method makes use of barometric sensors to
determine the vertical component of the position of the UE. The UE measures
barometric pressure, optionally aided by assistance data, to calculate the
vertical component of its location or to send measurements to the positioning
server for position calculation.
This method should be combined with other positioning methods to determine the
3D position of the UE.
The operation of the Barometric pressure sensor positioning method is
described in clause 8.4.
### 4.3.6 WLAN positioning
The WLAN positioning method makes use of the WLAN measurements (AP identifiers
and optionally other measurements) and databases to determine the location of
the UE. The UE measures received signals from WLAN [21] access points,
optionally aided by assistance data, to send measurements to the positioning
server for position calculation. Using the measurement results and a
references database, the location of the UE is calculated.
Alternatively, the UE makes use of WLAN measurements and optionally WLAN AP
assistance data provided by the positioning server, to determine its location.
The operation of the WLAN positioning method is described in clause 8.5.
### 4.3.7 Bluetooth positioning
The Bluetooth positioning method makes use of Bluetooth measurements (beacon
identifiers and optionally other measurements) to determine the location of
the UE. The UE measures received signals from Bluetooth [22] beacons. Using
the measurement results and a references database, the location of the UE is
calculated. The Bluetooth methods may be combined with other positioning
methods (e.g. WLAN) to improve positioning accuracy of the UE.
The operation of the Bluetooth positioning method is described in clause 8.6.
### 4.3.8 TBS positioning
A Terrestrial Beacon System (TBS) consists of a network of ground-based
transmitters, broadcasting signals only for positioning purposes. The current
type of TBS positioning signals are the MBS (Metropolitan Beacon System)
signals [23] and Positioning Reference Signals (PRS) (TS 36.211 [24]). The UE
measures received TBS signals, optionally aided by assistance data, to
calculate its location or to send measurements to the positioning server for
position calculation.
The operation of the TBS positioning method based on MBS signals is described
in clause 8.7.
TBS positioning based on PRS signals is part of OTDOA positioning and
described in clause 8.2.
### 4.3.9 Motion sensor positioning
The motion sensor method makes use of different sensors such as
accelerometers, gyros, magnetometers, to calculate the displacement of UE. The
UE estimates a relative displacement based upon a reference position and/or
reference time. UE sends a report comprising the determined relative
displacement which can be used to determine the absolute position.
This method should be used with other positioning methods for hybrid
positioning.
The operation of the sensor positioning method is described in clause 8.8.
### 4.3.10 NR Enhanced Cell ID methods
NR Enhanced Cell ID (NR E‑CID) positioning refers to techniques which use
additional UE measurements and/or gNB measurements to improve the UE location
estimate.
Although NR E-CID positioning may utilise some of the same measurements as the
measurement control system in the RRC protocol, the UE generally is not
expected to make additional measurements for the sole purpose of positioning;
i.e., the positioning procedures do not supply a measurement configuration or
measurement control message, and the UE reports the measurements that it has
available rather than being required to take additional measurement actions.
The operation of the NR Enhanced Cell ID method is described in clause 8.9.
### 4.3.11 Multi-RTT positioning
The Multi-RTT positioning method makes use of the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurements and DL-PRS-RSRP of downlink signals received from multiple TRPs,
measured by the UE and the measured gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements and
UL-SRS-RSRP at multiple TRPs of uplink signals transmitted from UE.
The UE measures the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements (and optionally DL-
PRS-RSRP of the received signals) using assistance data received from the
positioning server, and the TRPs measure the gNB Rx-Tx time difference
measurements (and optionally UL-SRS-RSRP of the received signals) using
assistance data received from the positioning server. The measurements are
used to determine the RTT at the positioning server which are used to estimate
the location of the UE.
The operation of the Multi-RTT positioning method is described in clause 8.10.
### 4.3.12 DL-AoD positioning
The DL-AoD positioning method makes use of the measured DL-PRS-RSRP of
downlink signals received from multiple TPs, at the UE. The UE measures the
DL-PRS-RSRP of the received signals using assistance data received from the
positioning server, and the resulting measurements are used along with other
configuration information to locate the UE in relation to the neighbouring
TPs.
The operation of the DL-AoD positioning method is described in clause 8.11.
### 4.3.13 DL-TDOA positioning
The DL-TDOA positioning method makes use of the DL RSTD (and optionally DL-
PRS-RSRP) of downlink signals received from multiple TPs, at the UE. The UE
measures the DL RSTD (and optionally DL-PRS-RSRP) of the received signals
using assistance data received from the positioning server, and the resulting
measurements are used along with other configuration information to locate the
UE in relation to the neighbouring TPs.
The operation of the DL-TDOA positioning method is described in clause 8.12.
### 4.3.14 UL-TDOA positioning
The UL-TDOA positioning method makes use of the UL-RTOA (and optionally UL-
SRS-RSRP) at multiple RPs of uplink signals transmitted from UE. The RPs
measure the UL-RTOA (and optionally UL-SRS-RSRP) of the received signals using
assistance data received from the positioning server, and the resulting
measurements are used along with other configuration information to estimate
the location of the UE.
The operation of the UL-TDOA positioning method is described in clause 8.13.
### 4.3.15 UL-AoA
The UL-AoA positioning method makes use of the measured azimuth angle of
arrival (A-AoA) and zenith angle of arrival (Z-AoA) at multiple RPs of uplink
signals transmitted from the UE. The RPs measure A-AoA and Z-AoA of the
received signals using assistance data received from the positioning server,
and the resulting measurements are used along with other configuration
information to estimate the location of the UE.
The operation of the UL-AoA positioning method is described in clause 8.14.
# 5 NG-RAN UE Positioning Architecture
## 5.1 Architecture
Figure 5.1-1 shows the architecture in 5GS applicable to positioning of a UE
with NR or E-UTRA access.
The AMF receives a request for some location service associated with a
particular target UE from another entity (e.g., GMLC or UE) or the AMF itself
decides to initiate some location service on behalf of a particular target UE
(e.g., for an IMS emergency call from the UE) as described in TS 23.502 [26]
and TS 23.273 [35]. The AMF then sends a location services request to an LMF.
The LMF processes the location services request which may include transferring
assistance data to the target UE to assist with UE-based and/or UE-assisted
positioning and/or may include positioning of the target UE. The LMF then
returns the result of the location service back to the AMF (e.g., a position
estimate for the UE. In the case of a location service requested by an entity
other than the AMF (e.g., a GMLC or UE), the AMF returns the location service
result to this entity.
An NG-RAN node may control several TRPs/TPs, such as remote radio heads, or
DL-PRS-only TPs for support of PRS-based TBS.
An LMF may have a proprietary signalling connection to an E-SMLC which may
enable an LMF to access information from E‑UTRAN (e.g. to support the OTDOA
for E-UTRA positioning method using downlink measurements obtained by a target
UE of signals from eNBs and/or PRS-only TPs in E-UTRAN). Details of the
signalling interaction between an LMF and E-SMLC are outside the scope of this
specification.
An LMF may have a proprietary signalling connection to an SLP. The SLP is the
SUPL entity responsible for positioning over the user plane. Further details
of user-plane positioning are provided in [15][16]. Details of the signalling
interaction between an LMF and SLP are outside the scope of this
specification.
Figure 5.1-1: UE Positioning Overall Architecture applicable to NG-RAN
NOTE 1: Void
NOTE 2: Void
NOTE 3: Void
In case of split gNB architecture, a gNB-DU may include TRP functionality
where the TRP functionality may support functions for a TP, RP or both TP and
RP. A gNB-DU which includes TRP functionality does not need to offer cell
services.
## 5.2 UE Positioning Operations
To support positioning of a target UE and delivery of location assistance data
to a UE with NG-RAN access in 5GS, location related functions are distributed
as shown in the architecture in Figure 5.1-1 and as clarified in greater
detail in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.273 [35]. The overall sequence of events
applicable to the UE, NG-RAN and LMF for any location service is shown in
Figure 5.2-1.
Note that when the AMF receives a Location Service Request in case of the UE
is in CM-IDLE state, the AMF performs a network triggered service request as
defined in TS 23.502 [26] and TS 23.273 [35] in order to establish a
signalling connection with the UE and assign a specific serving gNB or ng-eNB.
The UE is assumed to be in connected mode before the beginning of the flow
shown in the Figure 5.2-1; that is, any signalling that might be required to
bring the UE to connected mode prior to step 1a is not shown. The signalling
connection may, however, be later released (e.g. by the NG-RAN node as a
result of signalling and data inactivity) while positioning is still ongoing.
Figure 5.2-1: Location Service Support by NG-RAN
1a. Either: some entity in the 5GC (e.g. GMLC) requests some location service
(e.g. positioning) for a target UE to the serving AMF.
1b. Or: the serving AMF for a target UE determines the need for some location
service (e.g. to locate the UE for an emergency call).
1c. Or: the UE requests some location service (e.g. positioning or delivery of
assistance data) to the serving AMF at the NAS level.
2\. The AMF transfers the location service request to an LMF.
3a. The LMF instigates location procedures with the serving and possibly
neighbouring ng-eNB or gNB in the NG-RAN -- e.g. to obtain positioning
measurements or assistance data.
3b. In addition to step 3a or instead of step 3a, the LMF instigates location
procedures with the UE -- e.g. to obtain a location estimate or positioning
measurements or to transfer location assistance data to the UE.
4\. The LMF provides a location service response to the AMF and includes any
needed results -- e.g. success or failure indication and, if requested and
obtained, a location estimate for the UE.
5a. If step 1a was performed, the AMF returns a location service response to
the 5GC entity in step 1a and includes any needed results -- e.g. a location
estimate for the UE.
5b. If step 1b occurred, the AMF uses the location service response received
in step 4 to assist the service that triggered this in step 1b (e.g. may
provide a location estimate associated with an emergency call to a GMLC).
5c. If step 1c was performed, the AMF returns a location service response to
the UE and includes any needed results -- e.g. a location estimate for the UE.
Location procedures applicable to NG-RAN occur in steps 3a and 3b in Figure
5.2-1 and are defined in greater detail in this specification. Other steps in
Figure 5.2-1 are applicable only to the 5GC and are described in greater
detail and in TS 23.502 [26] and TS 23.273 [35].
Steps 3a and 3b can involve the use of different position methods to obtain
location related measurements for a target UE and from these compute a
location estimate and possibly additional information like velocity.
Positioning methods supported in this release are summarized in clause 4.3 and
described in detail in clause 8.
The case that the NG-RAN node functions as an LCS client is not supported in
this version of the specification.
## 5.3 NG-RAN Positioning Operations
### 5.3.1 General NG-RAN Positioning Operations
Separately from location service support for particular UEs, an LMF may
interact with elements in the NG-RAN in order to obtain measurement
information to help assist one or more position methods for all UEs. An LMF
may also interact with NG-RAN node to provide assistance data information for
broadcasting.
### 5.3.2 OTDOA Positioning Support
An LMF can interact with any ng-eNB reachable from any of the AMFs with
signalling access to the LMF in order to obtain location related information
to support the OTDOA for E-UTRA positioning method, including PRS-based TBS
for E-UTRA. The information can include timing information for the TP in
relation to either absolute GNSS time or timing of other TPs and information
about the supported cells and TPs including PRS schedule.
Signalling access between the LMF and ng-eNB may be via any AMF with
signalling access to both the LMF and ng‑eNB.
An LMF can also interact with any gNB reachable from any of the AMFs with
signalling access to the LMF in order to obtain NR cell timing information to
support the OTDOA for E-UTRA positioning method, in case the UE is served by a
NR cell.
### 5.3.3 Assistance Information Broadcast Support
An LMF can interact with any NG-RAN node reachable from any of the AMFs with
signalling access to the LMF in order to provide assistance data information
for broadcasting. The information can include positioning System Information
Blocks (posSIBs) together with assistance information meta data, broadcast
cells and broadcast periodicity.
Signalling access between the LMF and NG-RAN node is via any AMF with
signalling access to both the LMF and NG-RAN node.
### 5.3.4 NR RAT-Dependent Positioning Support
An LMF can interact with any gNB reachable from any of the AMFs with
signalling access to the LMF in order to obtain location related information
to support the NR RAT-Dependent positioning methods. The information can
include timing information for the TRP in relation to either absolute GNSS
time or timing of other TRPs and information about the supported cells and
TRPs including PRS schedule.
When an LMF determines a positioning method for a UE, which requires gNB
measurements, the LMF can interact with the gNB to support the positioning
method. The LMF can request the gNB for SRS configuration for the UE and the
gNB can respond with the SRS configuration to the LMF. The gNB can provide an
updated SRS configuration to the LMF when the SRS configuration changes. If
semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS is configured to the UE, the LMF may
activate/deactivate the SRS. When the SRS is transmitted by the UE, the LMF
can request multiple TRPs to perform uplink measurements and report the
results.
Signalling access between the LMF and gNB for non-UE associated NRPPa
procedure in Clause 7.2.1 may be via any AMF with signalling access to both
the LMF and gNB. Signalling access between the LMF and gNB for UE associated
NRPPa procedure in Clause 7.2.1 is via the serving AMF, as in TS 23.273 [35].
## 5.4 Functional Description of Elements Related to UE Positioning in NG-RAN
### 5.4.1 User Equipment (UE)
The UE may make measurements of downlink signals from NG-RAN and other sources
such as E-UTRAN, different GNSS and TBS systems, WLAN access points, Bluetooth
beacons, UE barometric pressure and motion sensors. The measurements to be
made will be determined by the chosen positioning method.
The UE may also contain LCS applications, or access an LCS application either
through communication with a network accessed by the UE or through another
application residing in the UE. This LCS application may include the needed
measurement and calculation functions to determine the UE\'s position with or
without network assistance. This is outside of the scope of this
specification.
The UE may also, for example, contain an independent positioning function
(e.g., GPS) and thus be able to report its position, independent of the NG-RAN
transmissions. The UE with an independent positioning function may also make
use of assistance information obtained from the network.
### 5.4.2 gNB
The gNB is a network element of NG-RAN that may provide measurement
information for a target UE and communicates this information to an LMF.
To support NR RAT-Dependent positioning, the gNB may make measurements of
radio signals for a target UE, and provide measurement results for position
estimation. A gNB may serve several TRPs, including for example remote radio
heads, and UL-SRS only RPs and DL-PRS-only TPs.
A gNB may broadcast assistance data information, received from an LMF, in
positioning System Information messages.
### 5.4.3 ng-eNB
The ng-eNB is a network element of NG-RAN that may provide measurement results
for position estimation and makes measurements of radio signals for a target
UE and communicates these measurements to an LMF.
The ng-eNB makes its measurements in response to requests from the LMF (on
demand or periodically).
An ng-eNB may serve several TPs, including for example remote radio heads and
PRS-only TPs for PRS-based TBS positioning for E-UTRA.
An ng-eNB may broadcast assistance data information, received from an LMF, in
positioning System Information messages.
### 5.4.4 Location Management Function (LMF)
The LMF manages the support of different location services for target UEs,
including positioning of UEs and delivery of assistance data to UEs. The LMF
may interact with the serving gNB or serving ng-eNB for a target UE in order
to obtain position measurements for the UE, including uplink measurements made
by an NG-RAN and downlink measurements made by the UE that were provided to an
NG-RAN as part of other functions such as for support of handover.
The LMF may interact with a target UE in order to deliver assistance data if
requested for a particular location service, or to obtain a location estimate
if that was requested.
The LMF may interact with multiple NG-RAN nodes to provide assistance data
information for broadcasting. The assistance data information for broadcast
may optionally be segmented and/or ciphered by the LMF. The LMF may also
interact with AMFs to provide ciphering key data information to the AMF as
described in greater detail in TS 23.273 [35].
For positioning of a target UE, the LMF decides on the position methods to be
used, based on factors that may include the LCS Client type, the required QoS,
UE positioning capabilities, gNB positioning capabilities and ng-eNB
positioning capabilities. The LMF then invokes these positioning methods in
the UE, serving gNB and/or serving ng‑eNB. The positioning methods may yield a
location estimate for UE-based position methods and/or positioning
measurements for UE-assisted and network-based position methods. The LMF may
combine all the received results and determine a single location estimate for
the target UE (hybrid positioning). Additional information like accuracy of
the location estimate and velocity may also be determined.
# 6 Signalling protocols and interfaces
## 6.1 Network interfaces supporting positioning operations
### 6.1.1 General LCS control plane architecture
The general LCS control plane architecture in the 5GS applicable to a target
UE with NG-RAN access is defined in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.273 [35].
### 6.1.2 NR-Uu interface
The NR-Uu interface, connecting the UE to the gNB over the air, is used as one
of several transport links for the NR positioning protocol(s) for a target UE
with NR access to NG-RAN.
### 6.1.3 LTE-Uu interface
The LTE-Uu interface, connecting the UE to the ng-eNB over the air, is used as
one of several transport links for the LTE positioning protocol(s) for a
target UE with LTE access to NG-RAN.
### 6.1.4 NG-C interface
The NG-C interface between the gNB and the AMF and between the ng-eNB and the
AMF is transparent to all UE-positioning-related procedures. It is involved in
these procedures only as a transport link for the NR positioning protocol(s).
For gNB related positioning procedures, the NG-C interface transparently
transports both positioning requests from the LMF to the gNB and positioning
results from the gNB to the LMF.
For ng-eNB related positioning procedures, the NG-C interface transparently
transports both positioning requests from the LMF to the ng-eNB and
positioning results from the ng-eNB to the LMF.
For delivery of broadcast assistance data information, the NG-C interface
transparently transports both the assistance data information from the LMF to
the NG-RAN node for broadcasting and the feedback information on assistance
information broadcasting from the NG-RAN node to the LMF. The NG-C interface
is also used by an AMF to transparently transport ciphering keys via NG-RAN
node to UEs using a NAS message. The ciphering keys are used to decipher
broadcast assistance data information, if the broadcast assistance data
information is ciphered.
### 6.1.5 NL1 interface
The NL1 interface, between the LMF and the AMF, is transparent to all UE
related, gNB related and ng-eNB related positioning procedures. It is used
only as a transport link for the LTE Positioning Protocols LPP and NR
Positioning Protocol A NRPPa.
### 6.1.6 F1 interface
In case of split gNB architecture, the F1 interface is used to support the
exchange of positioning information between the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU; it is
also used transparently as a transport link for the LPP.
## 6.2 UE-terminated protocols
### 6.2.1 LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP)
The LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP) is terminated between a target device (the
UE in the control-plane case or SET in the user-plane case) and a positioning
server (the LMF in the control-plane case or SLP in the user-plane case). It
may use either the control- or user-plane protocols as underlying transport.
In this specification, only control plane use of LPP is defined. User plane
support of LPP is defined in [15] and [16].
LPP messages are carried as transparent PDUs across intermediate network
interfaces using the appropriate protocols (e.g., NGAP over the NG-C
interface, NAS/RRC over the LTE-Uu and NR-Uu interfaces). The LPP protocol is
intended to enable positioning for NR and LTE using a multiplicity of
different position methods, while isolating the details of any particular
positioning method and the specifics of the underlying transport from one
another.
The protocol operates on a transaction basis between a target device and a
server, with each transaction taking place as an independent procedure. More
than one such procedure may be in progress at any given moment. An LPP
procedure may involve a request/response pairing of messages or one or more
\"unsolicited\" messages. Each procedure has a single objective (e.g.,
transfer of assistance data, exchange of LPP related capabilities, or
positioning of a target device according to some QoS and use of one or more
positioning methods). Multiple procedures, in series and/or in parallel, can
be used to achieve more complex objectives (e.g., positioning of a target
device in association with transfer of assistance data and exchange of LPP
related capabilities). Multiple procedures also enable more than one
positioning attempt to be ongoing at the same time (e.g., to obtain a coarse
location estimate with low delay while a more accurate location estimate is
being obtained with higher delay).
An LPP session is defined between a positioning server and the target device,
the details of its relation with transactions are described in clause 4.1.2 of
TS 36.355 [19].
For the 3GPP 5GS Control Plane solution defined in TS 23.501 [2], TS 23.502
[26] and TS 23.273 [35], the UE is the target device and the LMF is the
server. For SUPL 2.0 support, the SUPL Enabled Terminal (SET) is the target
device and the SUPL Location Platform (SLP) is the server. The operations
controlled through LPP are described further in clause 7.1.
LPP defined data structures for assistance data information are reused for
supporting RRC broadcast of assistance data information which are embedded in
positioning SIBs. This enables broadcast assistance data using the same data
structures which are used for point to point location.
### 6.2.2 Radio Resource Control (RRC) for NR
The RRC protocol for NR is terminated between the gNB and the UE. It provides
transport for LPP messages over the NR-Uu interface.
In addition to providing transport for LPP messages over the NR-Uu interface,
it supports transfer of measurements that may be used for positioning purposes
through the existing measurement systems specified in TS 38.331 [14].
The RRC protocol for NR also supports broadcasting of assistance data via
positioning System Information messages.
The RRC protocol for NR is also used to configure UEs with a sounding
reference signal (SRS) to support NG-RAN measurements for NR positioning.
### 6.2.3 Radio Resource Control (RRC) for LTE
The RRC protocol for LTE is terminated between the ng-eNB and the UE. In
addition to providing transport for LPP messages over the LTE-Uu interface, it
supports transfer of measurements that may be used for positioning purposes
through the existing measurement systems specified in TS 36.331 [13].
The RRC protocol for LTE also supports broadcasting of assistance data via
positioning System Information messages.
### 6.2.4 Medium Access Control (MAC) for NR
The MAC protocol for NR supports activation and deactivation of configured
semi-persistent SRS resource sets as specified in TS 38.321 [39] to support
NG-RAN measurements for NR positioning.
## 6.3 NG-RAN Node terminated protocols
### 6.3.1 NR Positioning Protocol A (NRPPa)
The NR Positioning Protocol A (NRPPa) carries information between the NG-RAN
Node and the LMF. It is used to support the following positioning functions:
\- E-CID for E-UTRA where measurements are transferred from the ng-eNB to the
LMF.
\- Data collection from ng-eNB\'s and gNB\'s for support of OTDOA positioning
for E-UTRA.
\- Cell-ID and Cell Portion ID retrieval from gNB\'s for support of NR Cell ID
positioning method.
\- Exchange of information between LMF and NG-RAN node for the purpose of
assistance data broadcasting.
\- NR E-CID where measurements are transferred from the gNB to the LMF.
\- NR Multi-RTT where measurements are transferred from the gNB to the LMF.
\- NR UL-AoA where measurements are transferred from the gNB to the LMF.
\- NR UL-TDOA where measurements are transferred from the gNB to the LMF.
\- Data collection from gNBs for support of DL-TDOA, DL-AoD, Multi-RTT, UL-
TDOA, UL-AoA.
The NRPPa protocol is transparent to the AMF. The AMF routes the NRPPa PDUs
transparently based on a Routing ID corresponding to the involved LMF over
NG-C interface without knowledge of the involved NRPPa transaction. It carries
the NRPPa PDUs over NG-C interface either in UE associated mode or non-UE
associated mode.
In case of a split gNB architecture, the NRPPa protocol is terminated at the
gNB-CU.
### 6.3.2 NG Application Protocol (NGAP)
The NGAP protocol, terminated between the AMF and the NG-RAN Node, is used as
transport for LPP and NRPPa messages over the NG-C interface. The NGAP
protocol is also used to instigate and terminate NG-RAN Node related
positioning procedures.
## 6.4 Signalling between an LMF and UE
### 6.4.1 Protocol Layering
Figure 6.4.1-1 shows the protocol layering used to support transfer of LPP
messages between an LMF and UE. The LPP PDU is carried in NAS PDU between the
AMF and the UE.
Figure 6.4.1-1: Protocol Layering for LMF to UE Signalling
### 6.4.2 LPP PDU Transfer
Figure 6.4.2-1 shows the transfer of an LPP PDU between an LMF and UE, in the
network- and UE-triggered cases. These two cases may occur separately or as
parts of a single more complex operation.
Figure 6.4.2-1: LPP PDU transfer between LMF and UE (network- and UE-triggered
cases)
1\. Steps 1 to 4 may occur before, after, or at the same time as steps 5 to 8.
Steps 1 to 4 and steps 5 to 8 may also be repeated. Steps 1 to 4 are triggered
when the LMF needs to send an LPP message to the UE as part of some LPP
positioning activity. The LMF then invokes the Namf_Communication
_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation towards the AMF to request the transfer
of a LPP PDU to the UE. The service operation includes the LPP PDU together
with the LCS Correlation ID in the N1 Message Container as defined in TS
29.518 [28].
2\. If the UE is in CM-IDLE state (e.g. if the NG connection was previously
released due to data and signalling inactivity), the AMF initiates a network
triggered service request as defined in TS 23.502 [26] in order to establish a
signalling connection with the UE and assign a serving NG-RAN node.
3\. The AMF includes the LPP PDU in the payload container of a DL NAS
Transport message, and a Routing Identifier identifying the LMF in the
Additional Information of the DL NAS Transport message defined in TS 24.501
[29]. The AMF then sends the DL NAS Transport message to the serving NG-RAN
Node in an NGAP Downlink NAS Transport message defined in TS 38.413 [30]. The
AMF need not retain state information for this transfer; it can treat any
response in step 7 as a separate non-associated transfer.
4\. The NG-RAN Node forwards the DL NAS Transport message to the UE in an RRC
DL Information Transfer message.
5\. Steps 5 to 8 are triggered when the UE needs to send an LPP PDU to the LMF
as part of some LPP positioning activity. If the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the
UE instigates a UE triggered service request as defined in TS 23.502 [26] in
order to establish a signalling connection with the AMF and assign a serving
NG-RAN node.
6\. The UE includes the LPP PDU in the payload container of an UL NAS
Transport message, and the Routing Identifier, which has been received in step
4, in the Additional Information of the UL NAS Transport message defined in TS
24.501 [29]. The UE then sends the UL NAS Transport message to the serving NG-
RAN node in an RRC UL Information Transfer message.
7\. The NG-RAN node forwards the UL NAS Transport Message to the AMF in an
NGAP Uplink NAS Transport message.
8\. The AMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service operation
towards the LMF indicated by the Routing Identifier received in step 7. The
service operation includes the LPP PDU received in step 7 together with the
LCS Correlation ID in the N1 Message Container as defined in TS 29.518 [28].
## 6.5 Signalling between an LMF and NG-RAN node
### 6.5.1 Protocol Layering
Figure 6.5.1-1 shows the protocol layering used to support transfer of NRPPa
PDUs between an LMF and NG-RAN Node.
The NRPPa protocol is transparent to the AMF. The AMF routes the NRPPa PDUs
transparently based on a Routing ID which corresponds to the involved LMF node
over the NG interface without knowledge of the involved NRPPa transaction. It
carries the NRPPa PDUs over NG interface either in UE associated mode or non-
UE associated mode.
Figure 6.5.1-1: Protocol Layering for LMF to NG-RAN Signalling
### 6.5.2 NRPPa PDU Transfer for UE Positioning
Figure 6.5.2-1 shows NRPPa PDU transfer between an LMF and NG-RAN Node to
support positioning of a particular UE.
Figure 6.5.2-1: NRPPa PDU Transfer between an LMF and NG-RAN node for UE
Positioning
1\. Steps 1 to 3 are triggered when the LMF needs to send an NRPPa message to
the serving NG-RAN Node for a target UE as part of a NRPPa positioning
activity. The LMF then invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
service operation towards the AMF to request the transfer of a NRPPa PDU to
the serving NG-RAN Node for the UE. The service operation includes the NRPPa
PDU together with the LCS Correlation ID in the N2 Message Container as
defined in TS 29.518 [28].
2\. If the UE is in CM-IDLE state (e.g. if the NG connection was previously
released due to data and signalling inactivity), the AMF performs a network
triggered service request as defined in TS 23.502 [26] in order to establish a
signalling connection with the UE and assign a serving NG-RAN Node.
3\. The AMF forwards the NRPPa PDU to the serving NG-RAN Node in an NGAP
Downlink UE Associated NRPPa Transport message over the NG signalling
connection corresponding to the UE and includes the Routing ID related to the
LMF. The AMF need not retain state information for this transfer \-- e.g. can
treat any response in step 4 as a separate non-associated transfer.
4\. Steps 4 and 5 are triggered when a serving NG-RAN Node needs to send an
NRPPa message to the LMF for a target UE as part of an NRPPa positioning
activity. The NG-RAN Node then sends an NRPPa PDU to the AMF in an NGAP Uplink
UE Associated NRPPa Transport message and includes the Routing ID received in
step 3.
5\. The AMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify service operation
towards the LMF indicated by the Routing ID received in step 4\. The service
operation includes the NRPPa PDU received in step 4 together with the LCS
Correlation ID in the N2 Info Container as defined in TS 29.518 [28]. Steps 1
to 5 may be repeated.
### 6.5.3 NRPPa PDU Transfer for Positioning Support
Figure 6.5.3-1 shows NRPPa PDU transfer between an LMF and NG-RAN Node when
related to gathering data from the NG-RAN Node for positioning support for all
UEs.
Figure 6.5.3-1: NRPPa PDU Transfer between an LMF and NG-RAN for obtaining NG-
RAN Data
0\. An ng-eNB in the NG-RAN may communicate with several TPs (including PRS-
only TPs in case of PRS-based TBS is supported) to configure TPs, obtain TP
configuration information, etc.
A gNB in the NG-RAN may communicate with several TRPs (including PRS-only TPs)
to configure TRPs, obtain TRP configuration information, etc.
> NOTE: NG-RAN--TP/TPR signalling and configuration is outside the scope of
> this specification.
1\. Steps 1 and 2 are triggered when the LMF needs to send an NRPPa message to
an NG-RAN Node to obtain data related to the NG-RAN Node, and possibly
associated TPs. The LMF invokes the Namf_Communication_NonUeN2MessageTransfer
service operation towards the AMF to request the transfer of a NRPPa PDU to a
NG-RAN node (gNB or ng-eNB) in the NG-RAN. The service operation includes the
target NG-RAN node identity and the NRPPa PDU in the N2 Information Container
as defined in TS 29.518 [28].
2\. The AMF forwards the NRPPa PDU to the identified NG-RAN Node in an NGAP
Downlink Non UE Associated NRPPa Transport message and includes a Routing ID
identifying the LMF. The AMF need not retain state information for this
transfer -- e.g. can treat any response in step 3 as a separate non-associated
transfer.
3\. Steps 3 and 4 are triggered when an NG-RAN Node needs to send an NRPPa PDU
to an LMF containing data applicable to the NG-RAN Node, and possibly
associated TPs. The NG-RAN Node then sends an NRPPa PDU to the AMF in an NGAP
Uplink Non UE Associated NRPPa Transport message and includes the Routing ID
received in step 2.
4\. The AMF invokes the Namf_Communication_NonUeN2InfoNotify service operation
towards the LMF indicated by the Routing Identifier received in step 3. The
service operation includes the NRPPa PDU received in step 3 in the N2 Info
Container as defined in TS 29.518 [28]. Steps 1 to 4 may be repeated.
### 6.5.4 NRPPa PDU Transfer for Assistance Information Broadcast
Figure 6.5.4-1 shows NRPPa PDU transfer between an LMF and NG-RAN node to
support broadcast of assistance data.
Figure 6.5.4-1: NRPPa PDU Transfer between an LMF and NG-RAN Node for
providing assistance information for broadcasting.
1\. Step 1 is triggered when the LMF needs to send new or updated assistance
information to an NG-RAN node for broadcasting in positioning system
information messages. The LMF invokes the
Namf_Communication_NonUeN2MessageTransfer service operation towards the AMF to
request the transfer of a NRPPa PDU to a NG-RAN node (gNB or ng-eNB) in the
NG-RAN. The service operation includes the target NG-RAN node identity and the
NRPPa PDU in the N2 Information Container as defined in TS 29.518 [28].
2\. The AMF forwards the NRPPa PDU to the identified NG-RAN node in an NGAP
Downlink Non UE Associated NRPPa Transport message and includes the Routing ID
identifying the LMF. The AMF need not retain state information for this
transfer.
Figure 6.5.4-2 shows NRPPa PDU transfer between an NG-RAN node and LMF for
providing feedback to the LMF on assistance data broadcasting.
Figure 6.5.4-2: NRPPa PDU Transfer between an NG-RAN node and LMF for
providing feedback on assistance data broadcasting.
1\. Step 1 is triggered when an NG-RAN node needs to send an NRPPa PDU to an
LMF for providing feedback on assistance data broadcasting. Step 1 may only be
triggered if the procedure in Figure 6.5.4-1 has already been performed. The
NG-RAN node sends an NRPPa PDU to the AMF in an NGAP Uplink Non UE Associated
NRPPa Transport message. The NG-RAN node includes the previously received
Routing ID related to the LMF (Figure 6.5.4-1).
2\. The AMF invokes the Namf_Communication_NonUeN2InfoNotify service operation
towards the LMF indicated by the Routing identifier received at step 1. The
service operation includes the NRPPa PDU received in step 1 in the N2 Info
Container as defined in TS 29.518 [28].

# 7 General NG-RAN UE Positioning procedures
## 7.1 General LPP procedures for UE Positioning
### 7.1.1 LPP procedures
Positioning procedures in the NG-RAN are modelled as transactions of the LPP
protocol using the procedures defined in this specification. A procedure
consists of a single operation of one of the following types:
\- Exchange of positioning capabilities;
\- Transfer of assistance data;
\- Transfer of location information (positioning measurements and/or position
estimate);
\- Error handling;
\- Abort.
Parallel transactions are permitted (i.e. a new LPP transaction may be
initiated, while another one is outstanding).
As described in clause 6.2.1, the protocol operates between a \"target\" and a
\"server\". In the control-plane context, these entities are the UE and LMF
respectively; in the SUPL context they are the SET and the SLP. A procedure
may be initiated by either the target or the server.
### 7.1.2 Positioning procedures
#### 7.1.2.1 Capability transfer
The capability transfer procedure between a \"target\" and a \"server\" is
specified in clause 7.1.2.1 of TS 36.305 [25].
#### 7.1.2.2 Assistance data transfer
The assistance data transfer procedure between a \"target\" and a \"server\"
is specified in clause 7.1.2.2 of TS 36.305 [25].
#### 7.1.2.3 Location information transfer
The location information transfer procedure between a \"target\" and a
\"server\" is specified in clause 7.1.2.3 of TS 36.305 [25].
#### 7.1.2.4 Multiple transactions
Multiple LPP transactions may be in progress simultaneously as specified in
clause 7.1.2.4 of TS 36.305 [25].
#### 7.1.2.5 Sequence of procedures
LPP procedures are not required to occur in any fixed order, in order to
provide greater flexibility in positioning. Thus, a UE may request assistance
data at any time in order to comply with a previous request for location
measurements from the LMF; an LMF may instigate more than one request for
location information (e.g., measurements or a location estimate) in case
location results from a previous request were not adequate for the requested
QoS; and the target device may transfer capability information to the server
at any time if not already performed.
Despite the flexibility allowed by LPP, it is expected that procedures will
normally occur in the following order:
1\. Capability Transfer;
2\. Assistance Data Transfer;
3\. Location Information Transfer (measurements and/or location estimate).
Specific examples for each positioning method are shown in clause 8.
#### 7.1.2.6 Error handling
The error handling procedure is specified in clause 7.1.2.6 of TS 36.305 [25].
#### 7.1.2.7 Abort
The abort procedure is specified in clause 7.1.2.7 of TS 36.305 [25].
### 7.1.3 UE positioning measurements in RRC_IDLE state for NB-IoT
NB-IoT UEs may perform measurements for some positioning methods only when in
RRC_IDLE state.
Figure 7.1.3-1 shows the general positioning procedure where the UE performs
positioning measurements in RRC_IDLE state.
Figure 7.1.3-1: UE positioning measurements in RRC_IDLE state.
1\. The LMF is aware of the UE access type and/or coverage level if applicable
from the Location Service Request message received from the AMF. The LMF may
send a LPP Request Capabilities message to the UE to obtain the UE positioning
method capabilities from the UE, as described in clause 7.1.2.1.
2\. The UE sends its positioning method capabilities to the LMF in a LPP
Provide Capabilities message, including an indication of position methods for
which the UE needs to make measurements in RRC_IDLE state.
3\. The LMF may determine the assistance data required for the selected
position method or methods, and sends them in one or more LPP Provide
Assistance data messages to the UE, as described in clause 7.1.2.2. If an LPP
acknowledgement was requested, the UE sends an LPP acknowledgment for each
received LPP Provide Assistance data message to the LMF.
4\. If the UE capabilities from step 2 indicate that RRC_IDLE state is
required for positioning measurements, the LMF may allow additional response
time to the UE to obtain the location measurements, and sends one or more LPP
Request Location Information messages to the UE requesting positioning
measurements or a location estimate, and including the required response time,
as described in clause 7.1.2.3. For E-CID positioning method, when NRSRP/NRSRQ
measurements are requested the UE is requested to provide NRSRP/NRSRQ
measurements for intra-frequency neighbour cells and for inter-frequency
neighbour cells. The UE may use inter-frequency information in system
information of the serving cell specified in TS 36.331 [13] to decide on which
inter-frequency cells to measure.
5\. The UE sends an LPP acknowledgement for each received LPP Request Location
Information message to the LMF, if an LPP acknowledgement was requested at
step 4 but does not perform the requested measurements.
6\. The UE may finish any other activities in progress (e.g., SMS or data
transfer), and waits until the network releases or suspends the connection
(after a certain period of inactivity). The UE will then receive an RRC
connection release or suspend from the ng-eNB due to the expiration of the
inactivity timer.
7\. When the UE has entered RRC_IDLE state, the UE performs the measurements
requested in step 4.
8\. Before the location measurements are to be sent to the LMF, the UE
instigates a UE-triggered service request or, when User Plane CIoT 5GC
optimization applies, the Connection Resume procedure as defined in TS 23.501
[2], if the UE is not using Control Plane CIoT 5GC Optimisation, in order to
establish a signalling connection with the AMF. If the UE is using Control
Plane CIoT 5GC Optimisation, procedures for Mobile Originated Data Transport
in Control Plane CIoT 5GC optimisation as defined in TS 23.501 [2] are
performed by the UE to establish a signalling connection with the AMF.
9\. When the LPP response time received in step 4 expires (or when location
measurements are available before expiry), the UE sends one or more LPP
Provide Location Information messages containing the requested location
measurements or location estimate obtained in step 7 to the LMF.
## 7.2 General NRPPa Procedures for UE Positioning
### 7.2.1 NRPPa procedures
Positioning and data acquisition transactions between a LMF and NG-RAN node
are modelled by using procedures of the NRPPa protocol. There are two types of
NRPPa procedures:
\- UE associated procedure, i.e. transfer of information for a particular UE,
including the procedures supporting the Positioning Information Transfer and
E-CID Location Information Transfer functions;
\- Non UE associated procedure, i.e. transfer of information applicable to the
NG-RAN node and associated TRP, including the procedures supporting the OTDOA
Information Transfer, Assistance Information Transfer, TRP Information
Transfer, and Measurement Information Transfer functions.
Parallel transactions between the same LMF and NG-RAN node are supported; i.e.
a pair of LMF and NG-RAN node may have more than one instance of an NRPPa
procedure in execution at the same time.
For possible extensibility, the protocol is considered to operate between a
generic \"access node\" (e.g. gNB, ng-eNB) and a \"server\" (e.g. LMF). An
NRPPa transaction is only initiated by the server.
Figure 7.2.1-1: A single NRPPa transaction
Figure 7.2.1-1 shows a single NRPPa transaction. The transaction is terminated
in step 2 in procedures including OTDOA Information Exchange and TRP
Information Exchange. For procedures such as Positioning Information Exchange,
Measurement and E-CID Measurement Initiation, additional responses may be
allowed (e.g. sending of updated information periodically and/or whenever
there is some significant change). In this case, the transaction may be ended
after some additional responses. In the NRPPa protocol, the described
transaction may be realized by the execution of one procedure defined as a
request and a response, followed by one or several procedures initiated by the
NG-RAN node (each procedure defined as a single message) to realize the
additional responses. _The Correlation ID, as specified in_ TS 29.572 _[33],
included by the LMF when it invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
AMF service operation to transfer the NRPPa PDU may be used by the LMF to
identify the target UE positioning session._
### 7.2.2 NRPPa transaction types
#### 7.2.2.1 Location information transfer
The term \"location information\" in this clause refers to the information
used in, or used for assisting in, computing position (e.g., cell information,
SRS configurations, radio measurements or positioning measurements). It is
delivered in response to a request.
Figure 7.2.2‑1: Location information transfer
1\. The server sends a request for location related information to the NG-RAN
node, and indicates the type of location information needed. The request may
refer to a particular UE.
2\. In response to step 1, the NG-RAN Node transfers location related
information to the server. The location related information transferred should
match the location related information requested in step 1.
3\. If requested in step 1, the NG-RAN node may transfer additional location
related information to the server in one or more additional NRPPa messages.
## 7.3 Service Layer Support using combined LPP and NRPPa Procedures
### 7.3.1 General
As described in TS 23.502 [26] and TS 23.273 [35], UE-positioning-related
services can be instigated from the 5GC for an NI-LR or MT‑LR location
service, or from the UE in case of an MO-LR location service. The complete
sequence of operations in the 5GC is defined in TS 23.502 [26] and TS 23.273
[35]. This clause defines the overall sequences of operations that occur in
the LMF, NG-RAN and UE as a result of the 5GC operations.
### 7.3.2 NI-LR and MT-LR Service Support
Figure 7.3.2-1 shows the sequence of operations for an NI-LR or MT-LR location
service, starting at the point where the AMF initiates the service in the LMF.
Figure 7.3.2-1: UE Positioning Operations to support an MT-LR or NI-LR
1\. The AMF sends a location request to the LMF for a target UE and may
include associated QoS.
2\. The LMF may obtain location related information from the UE and/or from
the serving NG-RAN Node. In the former case, the LMF instigates one or more
LPP procedures to transfer UE positioning capabilities, provide assistance
data to the UE and/or obtain location information from the UE. The UE may also
instigate one or more LPP procedures after the first LPP message is received
from the LMF (e.g., to request assistance data from the LMF).
3\. If the LMF needs location related information for the UE from the NG-RAN,
the LMF instigates one or more NRPPa procedures. Step 3 is not necessarily
serialised with step 2; if the LMF and NG-RAN Node have the information to
determine what procedures need to take place for the location service, step 3
could precede or overlap with step 2.
4\. The LMF returns a location response to the AMF with any location estimate
obtained as a result of steps 2 and 3.
### 7.3.3 MO-LR Service Support
Figure 7.3.3-1 shows the sequence of operations for an MO-LR service, starting
at the point where an LCS Client in the UE or the user has requested some
location service (e.g., retrieval of the UE\'s location or transfer of the
UE\'s location to a third party).
Figure 7.3.3-1: UE Positioning Operations to support an MO-LR
1\. The UE sends an MO-LR location service request message included in a UL
NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in TS 24.501 [29] to the AMF. The MO-LR
location service request message may carry an LPP PDU to instigate one or more
LPP procedures to transfer capabilities, request assistance data, and/or
transfer location information.
2\. The AMF invokes the Nlmf Determine Location Request service operation
towards the LMF as specified in TS 29.572 [33] and includes any LPP PDU
received in step 1.
3\. The LMF may obtain location related information from the UE and/or from
the serving NG-RAN node. In the former case or if an immediate response is
needed to any LPP procedure instigated by the UE in step 1 (e.g., a request
for assistance data), the LMF instigates one or more LPP procedures to
transfer UE positioning capabilities, provide assistance data to the UE and/or
obtain location information from the UE. The UE may also instigate further LPP
procedures after the first LPP message is received from the LMF (e.g., to
request assistance data or to request further assistance data).
4\. If the LMF needs location related information for the UE from the NG-RAN,
the LMF instigates one or more NRPPa procedures. Step 4 may also precede step
3 or occur in parallel with it.
5\. The LMF invokes the Nlmf Determine Location Response service operation
towards the AMF as specified in TS 29.572 [33] which includes any location
estimate obtained as a result of steps 3 and 4.
6\. If the UE requested location transfer to a third party the AMF transfers
the location received from the LMF in step 5 to the third party as defined in
TS 23.273 [35].
7\. The AMF sends an MO-LR location service response message included in a DL
NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in TS 24.501 [29].
### 7.3.4 Deferred MT-LR Event Reporting Support
Figure 7.3.4-1 shows the sequence of operations for an Deferred MT-LR Event
Reporting starting at the point where the UE reports an event to the LMF.
Figure 7.3.4-1: UE Positioning Operations to support a Deferred MT-LR
1\. The UE sends a supplementary services event report message to the LMF as
described in TS 24.571 [41] which is transferred via the serving AMF and is
delivered to the LMF using an Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service
operation. The event report may indicate the type of event being reported and
may include an embedded positioning message which includes any location
measurements or location estimate.
2\. If LMF determines no positioning procedure is needed, steps 3 and 4 are
skipped.
3\. The LMF may utilize any location information received in step 1. The LMF
may also retrieve location related information from the UE and/or from the
serving NG-RAN Node. In the former case, the LMF instigates one or more LPP
procedures to provide assistance data to the UE and/or obtain location
information from the UE. The UE may also instigate one or more LPP procedures
after the first LPP message is received from the LMF (e.g., to request
assistance data from the LMF).
4\. If the LMF needs location related information for the UE from the NG-RAN,
the LMF instigates one or more NRPPa procedures. Step 4 is not necessarily
serialised with step 3; if the LMF and NG-RAN Node have the information to
determine what procedures need to take place for the location service, step 4
could precede or overlap with step 3.
5\. The LMF invokes an Nlmf_Location_EventNotify service operation towards the
GMLC with an indication of the type of event being reported and any location
estimate obtained as a result of steps 3 and 4.
## 7.4 General RRC procedures for UE Positioning
### 7.4.1 NR RRC Procedures
NR RRC supports the following positioning related procedures:
\- Location Measurement Indication.
#### 7.4.1.1 Location Measurement Indication
The location measurement indication procedure is used by the UE to request
measurement gaps for OTDOA RSTD measurements, for subframe and slot timing
detection for inter-RAT E-UTRA RSTD measurements, or for NR DL-PRS
measurements.
Figure 7.4.1.1-1: Location measurement indication procedure
> **Precondition:** The UE served by a gNB has received a LPP message from an
> LMF requesting inter-RAT RSTD measurements for OTDOA positioning or NR DL-
> PRS measurements.
1\. If the UE requires measurement gaps for performing the requested location
measurements while measurement gaps are either not configured or not
sufficient, or if the UE needs gaps to acquire the subframe and slot timing of
the target E-UTRA system before requesting measurement gaps for the inter-RAT
RSTD measurements (see TS 38.133 [32], the UE sends an RRC Location
Measurement Indication message to the serving gNB. The message indicates that
the UE is going to start location measurements, or that the UE is going to
acquire subframe and slot timing of the target E-UTRA system, and includes
information required for the gNB to configure the appropriate measurement
gaps. When the gNB has configured the required measurement gaps the UE
performs the location measurements or timing acquisition procedures.
2\. When the UE has completed the location procedures which required
measurement gaps, the UE sends another RRC Location Measurement Indication
message to the serving gNB. The message indicates that the UE has completed
the location measurements or timing acquisition procedures.
### 7.4.2 LTE RRC Procedures
LTE RRC supports the following positioning related procedures:
\- Inter-frequency RSTD measurement indication.
#### 7.4.2.1 Inter-frequency RSTD measurement indication
The Inter-frequency RSTD measurement indication procedure is used by the UE to
request measurement gaps for OTDOA RSTD measurements.
Figure 7.4.2.1-1: Inter-frequency RSTD measurement indication procedure
> **Precondition:** The UE served by an ng-eNB has received a LPP message from
> an LMF requesting inter‑frequency RSTD measurements for OTDOA positioning.
1\. If the UE requires measurement gaps for performing the requested
inter‑frequency RSTD measurements for OTDOA positioning while measurement gaps
are either not configured or not sufficient, the UE sends an RRC Inter-
frequency RSTD Measurement Indication message to the serving ng-eNB. The
message indicates that the UE is going to start inter-frequency RSTD
measurements and includes information required for the ng-eNB to configure the
appropriate measurement gaps. When the ng-eNB has configured the required
measurement gaps the UE performs the inter-frequency RSTD measurements.
2\. When the UE has completed the inter-frequency RSTD measurements which
required measurement gaps, the UE sends another RRC Inter-frequency RSTD
Measurement Indication message to the serving ng-eNB. The message indicates
that the UE has completed the inter-frequency RSTD measurements.
## 7.5 Procedures for Broadcast of Assistance Data
### 7.5.1 General
Positioning assistance data can be included in positioning System Information
Blocks (posSIBs) as described in TS 36.331 [13], TS 38.331 [14] and TS 36.355
[19]. The posSIBs are carried in RRC System Information (SI) messages. The
mapping of posSIBs (assistance data) to SI messages is flexibly configurable
and provided to the UE in SIB1 for NG-RAN node TS 36.331 [13], TS 38.331 [14].
The UE may request posSI by means of on-demand SI request in
RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and also request posSIBs by means of on-demand SI
request in RRC_CONNECTED as described in TS 38.331 [14].
For each assistance data element, a separate posSIB-type is defined in TS
36.355 [19]. Each posSIB may be ciphered by the LMF using the 128-bit Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm (with counter mode) as described in TS
36.355 [19], either with the same or different ciphering key. The posSIBs
which exceed the maximum size limit defined in TS 36.331 [13], TS 38.331 [14]
shall be segmented by the LMF.
### 7.5.2 Broadcast Procedures
The general procedures for broadcast of positioning assistance data and
delivery of ciphering keys to UEs is described in TS 23.273 [35]. This clause
defines the overall sequences of operations that occur in the LMF, NG-RAN node
and UE.
Figure 7.5.2-1: Procedures to support broadcast of assistance data.
1\. The LMF sends an NRPPa Assistance Information Control message to the NG-
RAN node with an indication to start broadcasting assistance information. The
message includes one or more System Information groups, where each group
contains the broadcast periodicity and one or more posSIB types together with
meta data to be scheduled in the same SI message. Each posSIB type may be
ciphered and/or segmented at the LMF. The meta data may include an indication
whether the posSIB type in the System Information group is ciphered or not, as
well as an indication of an applicable GNSS type.
2\. The NG-RAN node includes the received System Information groups in RRC
System Information Messages and corresponding scheduling information in SIB1
as described in TS 36.331 [13], TS 38.331 [14]. The UE applies the system
information acquisition procedure according to TS 36.331 [13], TS 38.331 [14]
for acquiring the assistance data information that is broadcasted.
3\. If the posSIB types were ciphered by the LMF, the LMF invokes the
Nlmf_Broadcast_CipheringKeyData Notify service operation towards the AMF
carrying one or more ciphering keys. For each ciphering key, the LMF includes
a ciphering key value, a ciphering key identifier, a validity period, a set of
applicable tracking areas, and a set of applicable posSIB types. The AMF may
then distribute successfully stored ciphering keys and their validity times
and validity areas to suitably subscribed UEs using a mobility management
message as described in TS 23.273 [35]. The LMF repeats this procedure
whenever a ciphering key changes.
4\. At any time after Step 1, the NG-RAN node may send a NRPPa Assistance
Information Feedback message to the LMF providing feedback on assistance
information broadcasting. The message may include an assistance information
failure list indicating that certain posSIB types could not be configured for
broadcasting by the NG-RAN node.
5\. If the assistance information in a System Information group changes, the
LMF provides updated information in a NRPPa Assistance Information Control
message.
6\. The NG-RAN node replaces the previously stored System Information groups
with the new information received at Step 5 and includes the new System
Information groups in RRC System Information Messages.
7\. If the LMF wants to abort the broadcast of a System Information Group, it
sends a NRPPa Assistance Information Control message to the NG-RAN node
including an indication to stop broadcasting the assistance information.
# 8 Positioning methods and Supporting Procedures
## 8.1 GNSS positioning methods
### 8.1.1 General
A navigation satellite system provides autonomous geo-spatial positioning with
either global or regional coverage. Augmentation systems, such as SBAS, are
navigation satellite systems that provide regional coverage to augment the
navigation systems with global coverage.
By definition, GNSS refers to satellite constellations that achieve global
coverage, however, in 3GPP specifications the term GNSS is used to encompass
global, regional, and augmentation satellite systems. The following GNSSs are
supported in this version of the specification:
\- GPS and its modernization [5], [6], [7]; (global coverage)
\- Galileo [8]; (global coverage)
\- GLONASS [9]; (global coverage)
\- Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), including WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS,
and GAGAN [11]; (regional coverage)
\- Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) [10]; (regional coverage)
\- BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) [20] [34]. (global coverage)
Each global GNSS can be used individually or in combination with others,
including regional navigation systems and augmentation systems. When used in
combination, the effective number of navigation satellite signals would be
increased:
\- extra satellites can improve **availability** (of satellites at a
particular location) and results in an improved ability to work in areas where
satellite signals can be obscured, such as in urban canyons;
\- extra satellites and signals can improve **reliability** , i.e., with extra
measurements the data redundancy is increased, which helps identify any
measurement outlier problems;
\- extra satellites and signals can improve **accuracy** due to improved
measurement geometry and improved ranging signals from modernized satellites.
When GNSS is designed to inter-work with the NG-RAN, the network assists the
UE GNSS receiver to improve the performance in several respects. These
performance improvements will:
\- reduce the UE GNSS start-up and acquisition times; the search window can be
limited and the measurements speed up significantly;
\- increase the UE GNSS sensitivity; positioning assistance messages are
obtained via NG-RAN so the UE GNSS receiver can operate also in low SNR
situations when it is unable to demodulate GNSS satellite signals;
\- allow the UE to consume less handset power than with stand-alone GNSS; this
is due to rapid start-up times as the GNSS receiver can be in idle mode when
it is not needed;
\- allow the UE to compute its position with a better accuracy; RTK
corrections (for N-RTK) and GNSS physical models (for SSR/PPP) are obtained
via NG-RAN so the UE can use these assistance data, together with its own
measurements, i.e., code and carrier phase measurements, to enable computation
of a position with a high accuracy.
The network-assisted GNSS methods rely on signalling between UE GNSS receivers
(possibly with reduced complexity) and a continuously operating GNSS reference
receiver network, which has clear sky visibility of the same GNSS
constellation as the assisted UEs. Two assisted modes are supported:
_\- UE-Assisted_ : The UE performs GNSS measurements (pseudo-ranges, pseudo
Doppler, carrier phase ranges, etc.) and sends these measurements to the LMF
where the position calculation takes place, possibly using additional
measurements from other (non GNSS) sources;
_\- UE-Based_ : The UE performs GNSS measurements and calculates its own
location, possibly using additional measurements from other (non GNSS) sources
and assistance data from the LMF.
The assistance data content may vary depending on whether the UE operates in
UE-Assisted or UE-Based mode.
The assistance data signalled to the UE can be broadly classified into:
\- _data assisting the measurements_ : e.g. reference time, visible satellite
list, satellite signal Doppler, code phase, Doppler and code phase search
windows;
\- _data providing means for position calculation_ : e.g. reference time,
reference position, satellite ephemeris, clock corrections, code and carrier
phase measurements from a GNSS reference receiver or network of receivers;
\- _data increasing the position accuracy_ : e.g. satellite code biases,
satellite orbit corrections, satellite clock corrections, atmospheric models,
RTK residuals, gradients.
A UE with GNSS measurement capability may also operate in an autonomous
(standalone) mode. In autonomous mode the UE determines its position based on
signals received from GNSS without assistance from the network.
### 8.1.2 Information to be transferred between NG-RAN/5GC Elements
This clause defines the information that may be transferred between LMF and
UE.
#### 8.1.2.1 Information that may be transferred from the LMF to UE
Table 8.1.2.1-1 lists assistance data for both UE-assisted and UE-based modes
that may be sent from the LMF to the UE.
NOTE: The provision of these assistance data elements and the usage of these
elements by the UE depend on the NG-RAN/5GC and UE capabilities, respectively.

##### 8.1.2.1.1 Reference Time
Reference Time assistance provides the GNSS receiver with coarse or fine GNSS
time information. The specific GNSS system times (e.g., GPS, Galileo, GLONASS,
BDS system time) shall be indicated with a GNSS ID.
In case of coarse time assistance only, the Reference Time provides an
estimate of the current GNSS system time (where the specific GNSS is indicated
by a GNSS ID). The LMF should achieve an accuracy of ±3 seconds for this time
including allowing for the transmission delay between LMF and UE.
In case of fine time assistance, the Reference Time provides the relation
between GNSS system time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID)
and NG-RAN air-interface timing.
##### 8.1.2.1.2 Reference Location
Reference Location assistance provides the GNSS receiver with an a priori
estimate of its location (e.g., obtained via Cell-ID, OTDOA positioning, etc.)
together with its uncertainty.
The geodetic reference frame shall be WGS-84, as specified in TS 23.032 [4].
##### 8.1.2.1.3 Ionospheric Models
Ionospheric Model assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters to
model the propagation delay of the GNSS signals through the ionosphere.
Ionospheric Model parameters as specified by GPS [5], Galileo [8], QZSS [10],
and BDS [20] [34] may be provided.
##### 8.1.2.1.4 Earth Orientation Parameters
Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) assistance provides the GNSS receiver with
parameters needed to construct the ECEF-to-ECI coordinate transformation as
specified by GPS [5].
##### 8.1.2.1.5 GNSS-GNSS Time Offsets
GNSS-GNSS Time Offsets assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters
to correlate GNSS time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS-1 ID)
of one GNSS with other GNSS time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a
GNSS-2 ID). GNSS-GNSS Time Offsets parameters as specified by GPS [5], Galileo
[8], GLONASS [9], QZSS [10], and BDS [20] [34] may be provided.
##### 8.1.2.1.6 Differential GNSS Corrections
Differential GNSS Corrections assistance provides the GNSS receiver with
pseudo-range and pseudo-range-rate corrections to reduce biases in GNSS
receiver measurements as specified in [12]. The specific GNSS for which the
corrections are valid is indicated by a GNSS-ID.
##### 8.1.2.1.7 Ephemeris and Clock Models
Ephemeris and Clock Models assistance provides the GNSS receiver with
parameters to calculate the GNSS satellite position and clock offsets. The
various GNSSs use different model parameters and formats, and all parameter
formats as defined by the individual GNSSs are supported by the signalling.
##### 8.1.2.1.8 Real-Time Integrity
Real-Time Integrity assistance provides the GNSS receiver with information
about the health status of a GNSS constellation (where the specific GNSS is
indicated by a GNSS ID).
##### 8.1.2.1.9 Data Bit Assistance
Data Bit Assistance provides the GNSS receiver with information about data
bits or symbols transmitted by a GNSS satellite at a certain time (where the
specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID). This information may be used by the
UE for sensitivity assistance (data wipe-off) and time recovery.
##### 8.1.2.1.10 Acquisition Assistance
Acquisition Assistance provides the GNSS receiver with information about
visible satellites, reference time, expected code-phase, expected Doppler,
search windows (i.e., code and Doppler uncertainty) and other information of
the GNSS signals (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID) to enable
a fast acquisition of the GNSS signals.
##### 8.1.2.1.11 Almanac
Almanac assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters to calculate the
coarse (long-term) GNSS satellite position and clock offsets. The various
GNSSs use different model parameters and formats, and all parameter formats as
defined by the individual GNSSs are supported by the signalling.
##### 8.1.2.1.12 UTC Models
UTC Models assistance provides the GNSS receiver with parameters needed to
relate GNSS system time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by a GNSS ID) to
Universal Coordinated Time. The various GNSSs use different model parameters
and formats, and all parameter formats as defined by the individual GNSSs are
supported by the signalling.
##### 8.1.2.1.13 RTK Reference Station Information
RTK Reference Station Information provides the GNSS receiver with the Earth-
Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates of the Reference Station\'s installed
antenna\'s ARP, and the height of the ARP above the survey monument.
Additionally, this assistance data provides information about the antenna type
installed at the reference site.
NOTE: With the MAC N-RTK technique this assistance data is used to provide
information regarding the Master Reference Station (see clause 8.1.2.1a).
##### 8.1.2.1.14 RTK Auxiliary Station Data
RTK Auxiliary Station Data provides the GNSS receiver with the location for
all Auxiliary Reference Stations (see clause 8.1.2.1a) within the assistance
data. These values are expressed as relative geodetic coordinates (latitude,
longitude, and height) with respect to a Master Reference Station (see clause
8.1.2.1a) and based on the GRS80 ellipsoid. This type of assistance data is
relevant only with the MAC N-RTK technique [31].
##### 8.1.2.1.15 RTK Observations
RTK Observations provides the GNSS receiver with all primary observables
(pseudo-range, phase-range, phase-range rate (Doppler), and carrier-to-noise
ratio) generated at the Reference Station for each GNSS signal. The signal
generation from the reference station is in compliance with [31]: as an
example, the phase measurements of different signals in the same band must be
phased aligned. More examples can be found in [31].
The pseudo-range is the distance between the satellite and GNSS receiver
antennas, expressed in metres, equivalent to the difference of the time of
reception (expressed in the time frame of the GNSS receiver) and the time of
transmission (expressed in the time frame of the satellite) of a distinct
satellite signal.
The phase-range measurement is a measurement of the range between a satellite
and receiver expressed in units of cycles of the carrier frequency. This
measurement is more precise than the pseudo-range (of the order of
millimetres), but it is ambiguous by an unknown integer number of wavelengths.
The phase-range rate is the rate at which the phase-range between a satellite
and a GNSS receiver changes over a particular period of time.
The carrier-to-noise ratio is the ratio of the received modulated carrier
signal power to the noise power after the GNSS receiver filters.
NOTE: With the MAC N-RTK technique this assistance data is used to provide raw
observables recorded at the Master Reference Station (see clause 8.1.2.1a).
##### 8.1.2.1.16 RTK Common Observation Information
RTK Common Observation Information provides the GNSS receiver with common
information applicable to any GNSS, e.g. clock steering indicator. This
assistance data is always used together GNSS RTK Observations (see clause
8.1.2.1.15).
##### 8.1.2.1.17 GLONASS RTK Bias Information
RTK Bias Information provides the GNSS receiver with information which is
intended to compensate for the first-order inter-frequency phase-range biases
introduced by the reference receiver code-phase biases. This information is
applicable only for GLONASS FDMA signals. In the case that the MAC Network RTK
method is used, GLONASS RTK Bias Information defines the code-phase biases
related to the Master Reference Station [31].
##### 8.1.2.1.18 RTK MAC Correction Differences
RTK MAC Correction Differences provides the GNSS receiver with information
about ionospheric (dispersive) and geometric (non-dispersive) corrections
generated between a Master Reference Station and its Auxiliary Reference
Stations [31].
##### 8.1.2.1.19 RTK Residuals
RTK Residuals provides the GNSS receiver with network error models generated
for the interpolated corrections disseminated in Network RTK techniques. With
sufficient redundancy in the RTK network, the location server process can
provide an estimate for residual interpolation errors. Such quality estimates
may be used by the target UE to optimize the performance of RTK solutions. The
values may be considered by the target UE as a priori estimates only, with
sufficient tracking data available the target UE might be able to judge
residual geometric and ionospheric errors itself. According to [31], RTK
Residual error information should be transmitted every 10-60 seconds.
##### 8.1.2.1.20 RTK FKP Gradients
RTK FKP Gradients provides the GNSS receiver with horizontal gradients for the
geometric (troposphere and satellite orbits) and ionospheric signal components
in the observation space. According to [31], RTK FKP gradient information
should be typically transmitted every 10-60 seconds.
##### 8.1.2.1.21 SSR Orbit Corrections
SSR Orbit Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with parameters for orbit
corrections in radial, along-track and cross-track components. These orbit
corrections are used to compute a satellite position correction, to be
combined with satellite position ^­^calculated from broadcast ephemeris (see
clause 8.1.2.1.7).
NOTE 1: The orbit corrections define an offset between the broadcast ephemeris
orbit and a satellite antenna reference point (ARP) to which the other
corrections refer. The exact definition of the reference point along the
satellite antenna is implementation-defined by the Network and use of all
corrections together shall yield a consistent solution.
NOTE 2: The UE should not apply any additional corrections for the Satellite
Antenna Phase Center (APC) such as Phase Center Offset (PCO) or Phase Center
Variation (PCV) corrections. The Network may form the SSR corrections to
minimise the impact of Satellite APC effects on the UE.
##### 8.1.2.1.22 SSR Clock Corrections
SSR Clock Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with parameters to compute
the GNSS satellite clock correction applied to the broadcast satellite clock
(see clause 8.1.2.1.7). A polynomial of order 2 describes the clock
differences for a certain time period: clock offset, drift, and drift rate.
##### 8.1.2.1.23 SSR Code Bias
SSR Code Bias provides the GNSS receiver with the Code Biases that must be
added to the pseudo range measurements of the corresponding code signal to get
corrected pseudo ranges. SSR Code Bias contains absolute values, but also
enables the alternative use of Differential Code Biases by setting one of the
biases to zero. A UE can consistently use signals for which a code bias is
transmitted. It is not reliable for a UE to use a signal without retrieving a
corresponding code bias from the assistance data message.
##### 8.1.2.1.24 SSR Phase Bias
SSR Phase Bias provides the GNSS receiver with the GNSS signal phase bias that
are added to the carrier phase measurements of the corresponding signal to get
corrected phase ranges. An indicator used to count events when phase bias is
discontinuous is provided. An optional indicator is also provided to indicate
whether fixed, widelane fixed or float PPP-RTK positioning modes are supported
on a per signal basis.
NOTE 1: On the UE side, phase bias corrections of appropriate type are needed
to restore the integer nature of the phase ambiguities in PPP-RTK. Their
absence will affect the quality of the positioning solution and prevent a fast
convergence time.
NOTE 2: PPP-RTK Fixed position mode corresponds to the UE fixing the carrier
phase ambiguity to an integer value. The PPP-RTK Widelane Fixed positioning
mode corresponds to forming the widelane combination of carrier phase
measurements and fixing the resulting ambiguity as an integer value. In PPP-
RTK Float positioning mode the carrier phase ambiguity is not treated as an
integer value.
NOTE 3: The SSR Phase Bias values must be consistent with a satellite yaw
angle of zero as per [36].
##### 8.1.2.1.25 SSR STEC Corrections
SSR STEC Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with the parameters to compute
the ionosphere slant delay correction based on a variable order polynomial on
a per satellite basis and applied to the code and phase measurements.
##### 8.1.2.1.26 SSR Gridded Correction
SSR Gridded Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with STEC residuals and
Troposphere delays at a series of correction points and expressed as
hydrostatic and wet vertical delays.
NOTE: The final ionosphere slant delay (STEC) consists of the polynomial part
provided in SSR STEC Correction and the residual part provided in SSR Gridded
Corrections.
##### 8.1.2.1.27 SSR URA
SSR URA provides the receiver with information about the estimated accuracy of
the corrections for each satellite.
##### 8.1.2.1.28 SSR Correction Points
The SSR Correction Points provides a list of correction point coordinates or
an array of correction points (\"grid\") for which the SSR Gridded Corrections
are valid.
#### 8.1.2.1a Recommendations for grouping of assistance data to support
different RTK service levels
This clause provides recommendations for the different high-accuracy GNSS
service levels: RTK, N-RTK, PPP and PPP-RTK.
The high-accuracy GNSS methods can be classified as:
\- _Single base RTK service_ : RTK is a technique that uses carrier-based
ranging measurements i.e., phase-range to improve the positioning accuracy in
a differential approach. The basic concept is to reduce and remove errors
common to a Reference Station, with known position, and UE pair. When only
pseudo ranges (code-based measurements) are used to compute the UE location,
this method is known as DGNSS (Differential GNSS).

transferred from the LMF to the UE
* * *
Assistance Data RTK Reference Station Information RTK Observations RTK Common
Observation Information GLONASS RTK Bias Information (if GLONASS data is
transmitted) Ephemeris and Clock (if UE did not acquire the navigation
message)
* * *
\- _Non-Physical Reference Station Network RTK service_ : In this approach the
target UE receives synthetic observations from a fictitious Reference Station.
The Network RTK software at the location server is performing the error
estimation and creates a virtual Reference Station close to the initial
location of the target device (provided a priori to the location server). The
target UE interprets and uses the data just as if it had come from a single,
real Reference Station. Additionally, the target UE can also receive network
information such as RTK Network Residuals (see clause 8.1.2.1.19) or even FKP
gradients (see clause 8.1.2.1.20).

information that may be transferred from the LMF to the UE

Assistance Data RTK Reference Station Information RTK Observations RTK Common
Observation Information GLONASS RTK Bias Information (if GLONASS data is
transmitted) RTK Residuals RTK FKP Gradients Ephemeris and Clock (if UE did
not acquire the navigation message)
* * *
\- _MAC Network RTK service_ : In MAC network RTK, a group of Reference
Stations are used and one of them is chosen as a Master station. The other
stations are then called Auxiliary stations. In this service, the location
server sends full raw observations and coordinate information for a single
Reference Station, the Master Station. For all auxiliary stations in the
network (or a suitable subset of stations) the information is provided to the
UE in a highly compact form: their reduced ambiguity-levelled observations,
coordinate differences (to the Master Station observations and coordinates),
and network residuals. Two Reference Stations are said to be on a common
ambiguity level if the integer ambiguities for each phase range (satellite-
receiver pair) have been removed (or adjusted) so that the integer ambiguities
cancel when double-differences (involving two receivers and two satellites)
are formed during processing. The maintenance of a common ambiguity level at a
specific set of stations rather than across the whole GNSS network will lead
to a grouping in network clusters or subnetworks of all ambiguity-levelled
Reference Stations. If one network has only one subnetwork, this indicates
that an ambiguity level throughout the whole network is established. When
subnetworks are predefined, the assistance data can be broadcast to all UEs
located in the assigned sub-network. More details on the usage of subnetworks
can be found in [31].

message)
* * *
\- _FKP Network RTK service_ : With the concept of FKP, horizontal gradients
of distance-dependent errors like ionosphere, troposphere and orbits are
derived from a network of GNSS Reference Stations and transmitted to a target
device together with raw or correction data of a corresponding Reference
Station (physical or non physical). The target UE may use the gradients to
compute the effect of the distance-dependent errors for its own position.

\- _PPP service_ : This concept uses precise satellite orbit and clock
parameters derived from global networks of Reference Stations as well as
atmospheric models to perform single station positioning [31]. Compared to RTK
and Network RTK, PPP is not a differential technique as there is no baseline
limitation. When the orbits and clocks assistance data elements are provided
in real-time, with no latency, the method is called Real-Time PPP.

\- _PPP-RTK service_ : This concept uses precise satellite orbits and clock
parameters, the satellite signal biases derived from global networks of
Reference Stations as well as ionosphere and troposphere corrections to
perform single station positioning IS-QZSS-L6-001 [36]. Therefore, PPP-RTK
services compensate the global and local corrections for a more accurate
location information. Compared to PPP, PPP-RTK requires the UE to be located
within the region covered by the ionosphere and troposphere corrections.

##### 8.1.2.2.1 GNSS Measurement Information
The GNSS measurement information reported from the UE to the LMF depends on
the GNSS mode (i.e., UE-based, autonomous (standalone), or UE-assisted).
###### 8.1.2.2.1.1 UE-based mode
In UE-based or standalone mode, the GNSS receiver reports the latitude,
longitude and possibly altitude, together with an estimate of the location
uncertainty, if available.
If requested by the LMF and supported by the UE, the GNSS receiver may report
its velocity, possibly together with an estimate of the uncertainty, if
available.
If requested by the LMF and supported by the UE, the GNSS receiver may report
the relation between GNSS system time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by
a GNSS ID; the specific GNSS system time may be selected by the UE) and NG-RAN
air-interface timing. This information may be used by the LMF to assist other
UEs in the network.
The UE should also report an indication of which GNSSs and possibly other
location methods have been used to calculate a fix.
###### 8.1.2.2.1.2 UE-assisted mode
In UE-assisted mode, the GNSS receiver reports the Code Phase and Doppler
measurements together with associated quality estimates. These measurements
enable the LMF to calculate the location of the UE, possibly using other
measurements and data.
If requested by the LMF and supported by the UE, the GNSS receiver may report
Carrier Phase measurements (also called Accumulated Delta Range), together
with associated quality measurements, if available.
If requested by the LMF and supported by the UE, the GNSS receiver may report
the relation between GNSS system time (where the specific GNSS is indicated by
a GNSS ID; the specific GNSS system time may be selected by the UE) and NG-RAN
air-interface timing. This information may be used by the LMF to assist other
UEs in the network.
##### 8.1.2.2.2 Additional Non-GNSS Related Information
Additional non-GNSS measurements performed by NG-RAN or UE may be used by the
LMF or UE to calculate or verify a location estimate. This information may
include OTDOA positioning measurements, pathloss and signal strength related
measurements, etc.
### 8.1.3 Assisted-GNSS Positioning Procedures
#### 8.1.3.1 Capability Transfer Procedure
The Capability Transfer procedure for Assisted-GNSS positioning is described
in clause 7.1.2.1.
#### 8.1.3.2 Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to provide assistance data
to the UE (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure) and the UE to request
assistance data from the LMF (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure). In
the case of high-accuracy GNSS positioning techniques (e.g., RTK), the LMF can
provide unsolicited periodic assistance data to the UE and the UE can request
periodic assistance data from the LMF.
##### 8.1.3.2.1 LMF initiated Assistance Data Delivery
Figure 8.1.3.2.1-1 shows the Assistance Data Delivery operations for the
network-assisted GNSS method when the procedure is initiated by the LMF.
Figure 8.1.3.2.1-1: LMF-initiated Assistance Data Delivery Procedure
> (1) The LMF determines that assistance data needs to be provided to the UE
> (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure) and sends an LPP Provide
> Assistance Data message to the UE. This message may include any of the GNSS
> assistance data defined in clause 8.1.2.1.
##### 8.1.3.2.1a LMF initiated Periodic Assistance Data Delivery
The Periodic Assistance Data Delivery procedure allows the server to provide
unsolicited periodic assistance data to the target and is shown in Figure
8.1.3.2.1a-1.
NOTE: In this version of the specification, periodic assistance data delivery
is supported for HA GNSS (e.g., RTK) positioning only.
Figure 8.1.3.2.1a-1: LPP Periodic Assistance data delivery procedure
(1) The LMF determines that assistance data needs to be provided to the UE and
sends an LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the UE. This message includes
information to identify the type of periodic assistance data and a duration
for ending the assistance data delivery. The message indicates the end of the
control transaction.
(2) When the first periodic message is available, the LMF sends an unsolicited
LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the UE containing the periodic
assistance data announced in step (1).
(3) The LMF may continue to send further LPP Provide Assistance Data messages
to the target containing the periodic assistance data announced in step (1)
when each additional periodicity condition occurs. When the duration for
ending the periodic assistance data transfer occurs, the last LPP Provide
Assistance Data message transferred indicates the end of transaction.
Additionally, the session can be ended on request by the UE or by the LMF with
the help of an Abort message.
##### 8.1.3.2.2 UE initiated Assistance Data Transfer
Figure 8.1.3.2.2-1 shows the Assistance Data Transfer operations for the
network-assisted GNSS method when the procedure is initiated by the UE.
Figure 8.1.3.2.2-1: UE-initiated Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
(1) The UE determines that certain A-GNSS assistance data are desired (e.g.,
as part of a positioning procedure when the LMF provided assistance data are
not sufficient for the UE to fulfil the request) and sends a LPP Request
Assistance Data message to the LMF. This request includes an indication of
which specific A-GNSS assistance data are requested for each GNSS, possibly
together with additional information (e.g., for which GNSS signal types, or
satellites, or times the assistance is requested, etc.). Additional
information concerning the UE\'s approximate location and serving and
neighbour cells may also be provided in the Request Assistance Data message
and/or in an accompanying Provide Location Information message to help the LMF
provide appropriate assistance data. This additional data may include the
UE\'s last known location if available, the cell IDs of the UE serving NG-RAN
node and possibly neighbour NG-RAN nodes, as well as E-UTRA E-CID
measurements.
(2) The LMF provides the requested assistance data in a LPP Provide Assistance
Data message, if available at the LMF. The entire set of assistance data may
be delivered in one or several LPP messages, e.g., one message per GNSS. In
this case, this step may be repeated by the LMF several times. If any of the
UE requested assistance data in step (1) are not provided in step 2, the UE
shall assume that the requested assistance data are not supported, or
currently not available at the LMF. If none of the UE requested assistance
data in step (1) can be provided by the LMF, return any information that can
be provided in an LPP message of type Provide Assistance Data which includes a
cause indication for the not provided assistance data.
##### 8.1.3.2.2a UE initiated Periodic Assistance Data Transfer
Figure 8.1.3.2.2a-1 shows the Periodic Assistance Data Transfer operations for
the high-accuracy GNSS methods (e.g., RTK) when the procedure is initiated by
the UE.
NOTE: In this version of the specification, periodic assistance data transfer
is supported for HA GNSS (e.g., RTK) positioning only.
Figure 8.1.3.2.2a-1: UE-initiated Periodic Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
(1) The UE determines that periodic assistance data are desired and sends a
LPP Request Assistance Data message to the LMF. This request includes an
indication of which specific assistance data are requested together with
additional information such as desired periodicity for sending the assistance
data and a duration for ending the periodic assistance data delivery session.
(2) The LMF responds with a LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the UE. If
the UE request can be supported, the message contains information which may
confirm or redefine the type of assistance data or periodicity parameters
requested at step (1). This response indicates the end of the control
transaction.
(3) When available, the LMF provides the requested assistance data in a LPP
Provide Assistance Data message to the UE. If any of the requested assistance
data in step (1) or redefined in step (2) are not provided the UE assumes that
the requested assistance data are not supported, or currently not available at
the LMF.
(4) The LMF may transmit one or more additional LPP Provide Assistance Data
messages to the UE containing further periodic assistance data confirmed or
redefined in step (2). When the duration for ending the periodic assistance
data transfer occur, the last LPP Provide Assistance Data message transferred
indicates the end of the transaction. Additionally, the periodic assistance
data delivery session can be ended on request by the UE or by the LMF with the
help of an Abort message.
#### 8.1.3.3 Location Information Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request position
measurements or location estimate from the UE, or to enable the UE to provide
location measurements to the LMF for position calculation.
##### 8.1.3.3.1 LMF initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure
Figure 8.1.3.3.1-1 shows the Location Information Transfer operations for the
network-assisted GNSS method when the procedure is initiated by the LMF.
Figure 8.1.3.3.1-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure
(1) The LMF sends a LPP Request Location Information message to the UE for
invocation of A-GNSS positioning. This request includes positioning
instructions such as the GNSS mode (UE-assisted, UE-based, UE-based preferred
but UE-assisted allowed, UE-assisted preferred, but UE-based allowed,
standalone), positioning methods (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, BDS, etc. and
possibly non-GNSS methods, such as OTDOA positioning or E-CID positioning),
specific UE measurements requested if any, such as fine time assistance
measurements, velocity, carrier phase, multi-frequency measurements, and
quality of service parameters (accuracy, response time).
(2) The UE performs the requested measurements and possibly calculates its own
location. The UE sends an LPP Provide Location Information message to the LMF
before the Response Time provided in step (1) elapsed. If the UE is unable to
perform the requested measurements, or if the Response Time provided in step 1
elapsed before any of the requested measurements have been obtained, the UE
returns any information that can be provided in an LPP message of type Provide
Location Information which includes a cause indication for the not provided
location information.
##### 8.1.3.3.2 UE-initiated Location Information Delivery Procedure
Figure 8.1.3.3.2-1 shows the Location Information delivery operations for the
UE-assisted GNSS method when the procedure is initiated by the UE.
Figure 8.1.3.3.2-1: UE-initiated Location Information Delivery Procedure
(1) The UE sends an LPP Provide Location Information message to the LMF. The
Provide Location Information message may include any UE measurements (GNSS
pseudo-ranges, carrier phase-ranges, and other measurements) already available
at the UE.
## 8.2 OTDOA positioning
### 8.2.1 General
In this version of the specification, only OTDOA based on LTE signals is
supported.
In the OTDOA positioning method, the UE position is estimated based on
measurements taken at the UE of downlink radio signals from multiple E-UTRA
TPs (possibly including PRS-only E-UTRA TPs from a PRS-based TBS), along with
knowledge of the geographical coordinates of the measured TPs and their
relative downlink timing.
The UE while connected to a gNB may require measurement gaps to perform the
OTDOA measurements from E-UTRA TPs. The UE may request measurement gaps from a
gNB using the procedure described in clause 7.4.1.1. If the UE is not aware of
the SFN of at least one E-UTRA TP in the OTDOA assistance data, the UE may use
autonomous gaps to acquire SFN of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell prior to
requesting measurement gaps for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD
measurements.
The UE while connected to a ng-eNB may require measurement gaps to perform

via NRPPa signalling, although assistance data from several ng-eNBs and served
TPs may be acquired through other mechanisms, see NOTE below.
NOTE: The assistance data described in this clause are not necessarily
transferred only from the ng-eNB, and in some deployment options may not be
delivered from the ng-eNB at all; they may also be delivered to the LMF
through OAM or other mechanisms external to the NG-RAN. In addition, in cases
where assistance data are delivered from the ng-eNB, how the ng-eNB acquires
the data is outside the scope of this specification.
#### 8.2.2.3 Information that may be transferred from the UE to LMF
The information that may be signalled from UE to the LMF is listed in Table
8.2.2.3-1. The individual UE measurements are defined in TS 36.214 [17].

supported.
#### 8.2.3.1 Capability Transfer Procedure
The Capability Transfer procedure for OTDOA positioning is described in clause
7.1.2.1.
#### 8.2.3.2 Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
##### 8.2.3.2.1 Assistance Data Transfer between LMF and UE
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to provide assistance data
to the UE (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure) and the UE to request
assistance data from the LMF (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure).
###### 8.2.3.2.1.1 LMF initiated Assistance Data Delivery
Figure 8.2.3.2.1.1-1 shows the Assistance Data Delivery operations for the
OTDOA positioning method when the procedure is initiated by the LMF.
Figure 8.2.3.2.1.1-1: LMF-initiated Assistance Data Delivery Procedure
(1) The LMF determines that assistance data needs to be provided to the UE
(e.g., as part of a positioning procedure) and sends an LPP Provide Assistance
Data message to the UE. This message may include any of the OTDOA positioning
assistance data defined in clause 8.2.2.1.
###### 8.2.3.2.1.2 UE initiated Assistance Data Transfer
Figure 8.2.3.2.1.2-1 shows the Assistance Data Transfer operations for the
OTDOA positioning method when the procedure is initiated by the UE.
Figure 8.2.3.2.1.2-1: UE-initiated Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
(1) The UE determines that certain OTDOA positioning assistance data are
desired (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure when the LMF provided
assistance data are not sufficient for the UE to fulfil the request) and sends
an LPP Request Assistance Data message to the LMF. This request includes an
indication of which specific OTDOA assistance data are requested. Additional
information concerning the UE\'s approximate location and serving and
neighbour cells may also be provided in the Request Assistance Data message
and/or in an accompanying Provide Location Information message to help the LMF
provide appropriate assistance data. This additional data may include the
UE\'s last known location if available, the cell IDs of the UE serving NG-RAN
node and possibly neighbour NG-RAN nodes, as well as E-UTRA E-CID
measurements.
(2) The LMF provides the requested assistance in an LPP Provide Assistance
Data message, if available at the LMF. If any of the UE requested assistance
data in step (1) are not provided in step 2, the UE shall assume that the
requested assistance data are not supported, or currently not available at the
LMF. If none of the UE requested assistance data in step (1) can be provided
by the LMF, return any information that can be provided in an LPP message of
type Provide Assistance Data which includes a cause indication for the not
provided assistance data.
##### 8.2.3.2.2 Assistance Data Delivery between LMF and NG-RAN node
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the NG-RAN node to provide
assistance data to the LMF, for subsequent delivery to the UE using the
procedures of clause 8.2.3.2.1 or for use in the calculation of positioning
estimates at the LMF.
###### 8.2.3.2.2.1 LMF-initiated assistance data delivery to the LMF
Figure 8.2.3.2.2.1-1 shows the Assistance Data Delivery operation from the NG-
RAN node to the LMF for the OTDOA positioning method, in the case that the
procedure is initiated by the LMF.
Figure 8.2.3.2.2.1-1: LMF-initiated Assistance Data Delivery Procedure
(1) The LMF determines that certain OTDOA positioning assistance data are
desired (e.g., as part of a periodic update or as triggered by OAM) and sends
an NRPPa OTDOA INFORMATION REQUEST message to the NG-RAN node. This request
includes an indication of which specific OTDOA assistance data are requested.
(2) The NG-RAN node provides the requested assistance in an NRPPa OTDOA
INFORMATION RESPONSE message, if available at the NG-RAN node. If the NG-RAN
node is not able to provide any information, it returns an OTDOA INFORMATION
FAILURE message indicating the cause of the failure.
#### 8.2.3.3 Location Information Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request position
measurements from the UE, or to enable the UE to provide location measurements
to the LMF for position calculation.
##### 8.2.3.3.1 LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure
Figure 8.2.3.3.1-1 shows the Location Information Transfer operations for the
OTDOA positioning method when the procedure is initiated by the LMF.
Figure 8.2.3.3.1-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure
(1) The LMF sends an LPP Request Location Information message to the UE. This
request includes indication of OTDOA measurements requested, including any
needed measurement configuration information, and required response time.
(2) The UE obtains OTDOA measurements as requested in step 1. The UE then
sends an LPP Provide Location Information message to the LMF, before the
Response Time provided in step (1) elapsed, and includes the obtained OTDOA
measurements. If the UE is unable to perform the requested measurements, or
the Response Time elapsed before any of the requested measurements were
obtained, the UE returns any information that can be provided in an LPP
message of type Provide Location Information which includes a cause indication
for the not provided location information.
##### 8.2.3.3.2 UE-initiated Location Information Delivery procedure
Figure 8.2.3.3.2-1 shows the Location Information Delivery procedure
operations for the OTDOA positioning method when the procedure is initiated by
the UE.

(1) The UE sends an LPP Provide Location Information message to the LMF. The
Provide Location Information message may include any UE OTDOA measurements
already available at the UE.
## 8.3 Enhanced cell ID positioning methods
### 8.3.1 General
In the Cell ID (CID) positioning method, the UE position is estimated with the
knowledge of the geographical coordinates of its serving ng-eNB or gNB.
Enhanced Cell ID (E-CID) based on LTE signals positioning refers to techniques
which use UE and/or NG-RAN radio resource related measurements to improve the
UE location estimate. In the case of a serving ng-eNB, uplink E-CID may use
inter-RAT NR, GERAN, UTRA or WLAN measurements reported by UE.
NOTE 1: For E-CID positioning methods the UE reports only the measurements
that it has available rather than being required to take additional
measurement actions. Therefore, the measurement gap request procedure
described in clause 7.4.1.1 is not applicable for E-CID positioning methods.
E-CID measurements for E-UTRA may include [17, 18]:
UE measurements (TS 36.214 [17], TS 36.302 [18]):
\- E-UTRA Reference signal received power (RSRP);
\- E-UTRA Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ);
\- UE E-UTRA Rx -- Tx time difference;
E-CID UE measurements for other RAT may include:
\- GERAN RSSI;
\- UTRAN CPICH RSCP;
\- UTRAN CPICH Ec/Io;
\- WLAN RSSI.
\- SS Reference signal received power (SS-RSRP);
\- SS Reference Signal Received Quality (SS-RSRQ);
NOTE 2: The above GERAN, UTRAN, WLAN and NR measurements by UE are only used
for Uplink E-CID positioning.
ng-eNB measurements (TS 36.214 [17], TS 36.302 [18]):
\- ng-eNB Rx -- Tx time difference;
\- Timing Advance (T~ADV~):
\- Type1: T~ADV~ = (ng-eNB Rx -- Tx time difference) + (UE E-UTRA Rx -- Tx
time difference);
\- Type2: T~ADV~ = ng-eNB Rx -- Tx time difference;
\- Angle of Arrival (AoA).
Various techniques exist to use these measurements to estimate the location of
the UE. The specific techniques are beyond the scope of this specification.
### 8.3.2 Information to be transferred between NG-RAN/5GC Elements
This clause defines the information that may be transferred between LMF and
UE/NG-RAN node.
#### 8.3.2.1 Information that may be transferred from the LMF to UE

### 8.3.3 Downlink E-CID Positioning Procedures
The procedures described in this clause support E-CID related measurements
obtained by the UE and provided to the LMF using LPP. The term \"downlink\" is
intended to indicate that from the LMF perspective the involved measurements
are provided by the UE; this set of procedures might also be considered as
\"UE-assisted, LMF-based E-CID\".
#### 8.3.3.1 Capability Transfer Procedure
The Capability Transfer procedure for E-CID positioning is described in clause
7.1.2.1.
#### 8.3.3.2 Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
Assistance data transfer is not required for E-CID positioning.
#### 8.3.3.3 Location Information Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request position
measurements from the UE, or to enable the UE to provide location measurements
to the LMF for position calculation.
##### 8.3.3.3.1 LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer
Figure 8.3.3.3-1 shows the Location Information Transfer operations for the
E-CID method when the procedure is initiated by the LMF.
Figure 8.3.3.3-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure.
(1) The LMF sends a LPP Request Location Information message to the UE for
invocation of E-CID positioning. This request includes the E-CID measurements
requested by the LMF and supported by the UE as listed in Table 8.3.2.4-1
together with a required response time.
(2) The UE sends an LPP Provide Location Information message to the LMF and
reports the requested measurements that are available in the UE before the
Response Time provided in step (1) elapsed. If the requested measurements are
not available, or if the Response Time provided in step 1 elapsed before any
of the requested measurements have been obtained, the UE returns any
information that can be provided in an LPP message of type Provide Location
Information which includes a cause indication for the not provided location
information.
##### 8.3.3.3.2 UE-initiated Location Information Delivery procedure
Figure 8.3.3.3.2-1 shows the Location Information Delivery procedure
operations for the E-CID method when the procedure is initiated by the UE.

Provide Location Information message may include any UE measurements already
available at the UE.
### 8.3.4 Uplink E-CID Positioning Procedures
The procedures described in this clause support E-CID related measurements
obtained by the NG-RAN node and provided to the LMF using NRPPa. The term
\"uplink\" is intended to indicate that from the LMF point of view, the
involved measurements are provided by the NG-RAN node; this set of procedures
might also be considered as \"NG-RAN node-assisted E-CID\". An example of this
uplink E-CID positioning method for E-UTRA is AoA+T~ADV~.
#### 8.3.4.1 Capability Transfer Procedure
The Capability Transfer procedure is not applicable to uplink E-CID
positioning not using E-UTRA T~ADV~ type 1. For uplink E-CID positioning using
E-UTRA T~ADV~ type 1, the Capability Transfer procedure for E-CID positioning
is described in clause 7.1.2.1.
#### 8.3.4.2 Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
The assistance data transfer procedure is not applicable to uplink E-CID
positioning.
#### 8.3.4.3 Position Measurement Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request position
measurements from the NG-RAN node.
##### 8.3.4.3.1 LMF-initiated Position Measurement
Figure 8.3.4.3.1-1 shows the position measurement operations for the uplink
E-CID method when the procedure is initiated by the LMF.
Figure 8.3.4.3.1-1: LMF-initiated Position Measurement Procedure
(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message to the
NG-RAN node. This request includes indication of E-CID measurements requested
and whether the result is expected only once or periodically.
(2) If the LMF in step (1) requested UE measurements (e.g., E-UTRA RSRP,
E-UTRA RSRQ measurements, etc.), the NG-RAN node may configure the UE to
report the measurement information requested as specified in TS 36.331 [13],
TS 38.331 [14].
(3) If the result is expected only once and the NG-RAN node initiates at least
one of the E-CID measurements as requested, the NG-RAN node sends an NRPPa
E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE to the LMF, which includes the obtained
E-CID measurements. If the result is expected periodically and the NG-RAN node
is able to initiate at least one of the E-CID measurements as requested, the
NG-RAN node sends an NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE to the LMF,
which does not include any result. The NG-RAN node reports then the obtained
measurements by initiating the E-CID Measurement Report procedure, with the
requested periodicity. If the NG-RAN node is unable to initiate any of the
requested measurements as requested from the LMF, or is unable to instigate
any of the required RRC procedures to obtain the requested measurements from
the UE, the NG-RAN node sends an NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION FAILURE
message providing the error reason. If the failure occurs during a periodic
reporting, the NG-RAN node sends an NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT FAILURE INDICATION
message.
## 8.4 Barometric pressure sensor positioning
8.4.1 General
In the barometric pressure sensor positioning method, the UE vertical
component of the position is estimated by combining the measured atmospheric
pressure and a reference atmospheric pressure. This is accomplished through
barometric sensors measuring atmospheric pressure at the UE, and applying a
height determination algorithm using the reference atmospheric pressure.
Three positioning modes are supported:
\- _UE-Assisted_ : The UE performs barometric pressure sensor measurements
with or without assistance from the network and sends these measurements to
the LMF where the vertical component of the position calculation may take
place, possibly using additional measurements from other sources;
\- _UE-Based_ : The UE performs barometric pressure sensor measurements and
calculates its own vertical component of the position, possibly using
additional measurements from other sources.
\- _Standalone_ : The UE performs barometric pressure sensor measurements and
calculates its own vertical component of the position, possibly using
additional measurements from other sources, without network assistance.

assistance data are not sufficient for the UE to fulfil the request) and sends
a LPP Request Assistance Data message to the LMF. This request includes an
indication of which specific barometric pressure sensor assistance data is
requested.
(2) The LMF provides the requested assistance data in a LPP Provide Assistance
Data message, if available at the LMF. The entire set of assistance data may
be delivered in one or several LPP messages. In this case, this step may be
repeated by the LMF several times. If any of the UE requested assistance data
in step (1) are not provided in step 2, the UE shall assume that the requested
assistance data are not supported, or currently not available at the LMF. If
none of the UE requested assistance data in step (1) can be provided by the
LMF, return any information that can be provided in an LPP message of type
Provide Assistance Data which includes a cause indication for the not provided
assistance data.
#### 8.4.3.3 Location Information Transfer Procedure

positioning instructions such as the positioning mode (UE-assisted, UE-based,
standalone), specific requested UE measurements if any, and quality of service
parameters (accuracy, response time).
(2) The UE performs the requested measurements and possibly calculates its own
position. The UE sends an LPP Provide Location Information message to the LMF
before the Response Time provided in step (1) elapsed. If the UE is unable to
perform the requested measurements, or if the Response Time provided in step 1
elapsed before any of the requested measurements have been obtained, the UE

## 8.5 WLAN positioning
### 8.5.1 General
In the WLAN positioning method, the UE position is estimated with the
knowledge of geographical coordinate of reference WLAN access points. This is
accomplished by collecting a certain amount of measurements from UE\'s WLAN
receivers, and applying a location determination algorithm using databases of
the estimated position\'s references points.
The UE WLAN measurements may include:
\- WLAN Received Signal Strength (RSSI);
\- Round Trip Time (RTT) between WLAN Access Point and the UE.
Three positioning modes are supported:
\- _Standalone_ :\ The UE performs WLAN position measurements and location
computation, without network assistance.
\- _UE-assisted_ :\ The UE provides WLAN position measurements with or without
assistance from the network to the LMF for computation of a location estimate
by the network.
\- _UE-based_ :\ The UE performs WLAN position measurements and computation of
a location estimate with network assistance.

estimate. In the case of uplink NR E-CID inter-RAT E-UTRA measurements
reported by UE may also be used.
NOTE 1: For NR E-CID positioning methods the UE reports only the measurements
that it has available rather than being required to take additional
measurement actions. Therefore, the measurement gap request procedure
described in clause 7.4.1.1 is not applicable for NR E-CID positioning
methods.
NR E-CID measurements may include:
UE measurements (TS 38.215 [37]):
\- SS Reference signal received power (SS-RSRP);
\- SS Reference Signal Received Quality (SS-RSRQ);
\- CSI Reference signal received power (CSI-RSRP);
\- CSI Reference Signal Received Quality (CSI-RSRQ).

positioning.
#### 8.9.4.2 Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
Assistance data transfer is not required for UL NR E-CID positioning.
#### 8.9.4.3 Location Information Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request position
measurements from the gNB.
Figure 8.9.4.3-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to perform
this procedure.
Figure 8.9.4.3-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure
(1) The LMF sends an E-CID Measurement Initiation Request message to the
serving gNB to request NR E-CID measurement information. The message includes
indication of NR E-CID measurements requested and whether the result is
expected only once or periodically.
(2) If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to \"on demand\", the gNB
obtains the requested NR E-CID measurements and returns them in an E-CID
Measurement Initiation Response message to the LMF. The E-CID Measurement
Initiation Response message includes the obtained NR E-CID measurements as
defined in the clause 8.9.2.3.
If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to \"periodic\", the gNB
replies with an E-CID Measurement Initiation Response message without
including any measurements in the message. The gNB then periodically initiates
the E-CID Measurement Report procedure in step 3 for the NR E-CID
measurements, with the requested reporting periodicity.\ \ If the gNB is not
able to accept the E-CID Measurement Initiation Request message in step 1, the
gNB returns a failure message indicating the cause of the failure.
(3) The gNB periodically provides the NR E-CID measurements as defined in the
clause 8.9.2.3 to the LMF if that was requested at step 1.
(4) If the previously requested NR E-CID measurements can no longer be
reported, the gNB notifies the LMF by sending an E-CID Measurement Failure
Indication message.
(5) When the LMF wants to terminate an ongoing NR E-CID measurement it sends
an E-CID Measurement Termination Command message to the gNB.

In the Multi-RTT positioning method, the UE position is estimated based on
measurements performed at both, UE and TRPs. The measurements performed at the
UE and TRPs are UE/gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements (and optionally DL-
PRS-RSRP and UL-SRS-RSRP) of DL-PRS and UL-SRS, which are used by an LMF to
determine the RTTs.
The UE may require measurement gaps to perform the Multi-RTT measurements from
NR TRPs. The UE may request measurement gaps from a gNB using the procedure
described in clause 7.4.1.1.

The procedures described in this clause support Multi-RTT positioning
measurements obtained by the UE and TRPs/gNB.
#### 8.10.3.1 Procedures between LMF and UE
##### 8.10.3.1.1 Capability Transfer Procedure
The Capability Transfer procedure for Multi-RTT positioning is described in
clause 7.1.2.1.
##### 8.10.3.1.2 Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
###### 8.10.3.1.2.1 Assistance Data Transfer between LMF and UE
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to provide assistance data
to the UE (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure) and the UE to request
assistance data from the LMF (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure).
###### # 8.10.3.1.2.1.1 LMF initiated Assistance Data Delivery
Figure 8.10.3.1.2.1.1-1 shows the Assistance Data Delivery operations for the
Multi-RTT positioning method when the procedure is initiated by the LMF.
Figure 8.10.3.1.2.1.1-1: LMF-initiated Assistance Data Delivery Procedure
(1) The LMF determines that assistance data needs to be provided to the UE
(e.g., as part of a positioning procedure) and sends an LPP Provide Assistance
Data message to the UE. This message may include any of the Multi-RTT
positioning assistance data defined in Table 8.10.2.1-1.
###### # 8.10.3.1.2.1.2 UE initiated Assistance Data Transfer
Figure 8.10.3.1.2.1.2-1 shows the Assistance Data Transfer operations for the
Multi-RTT positioning method when the procedure is initiated by the UE.
Figure 8.10.3.1.2.1.2-1: UE-initiated Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
(1) The UE determines that certain Multi-RTT positioning assistance data are
desired (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure when the LMF provided
assistance data are not sufficient for the UE to fulfil the request) and sends
an LPP Request Assistance Data message to the LMF. This request includes an
indication of which specific Multi-RTT assistance data are requested.
Additional information concerning the UE\'s approximate location and serving
and neighbour cells may also be provided in the Request Assistance Data
message and/or in an accompanying Provide Location Information message to help
the LMF provide appropriate assistance data. This additional data may include
the UE\'s last known location if available, the cell IDs of the UE serving NG-
RAN node and possibly neighbour NG-RAN nodes, as well as NR E-CID
measurements.
(2) The LMF provides the requested assistance in an LPP Provide Assistance
Data message, if available at the LMF. If any of the UE requested assistance
data in step (1) are not provided in step 2, the UE shall assume that the
requested assistance data are not supported, or currently not available at the
LMF. If none of the UE requested assistance data in step (1) can be provided
by the LMF, return any information that can be provided in an LPP message of
type Provide Assistance Data which includes a cause indication for the not
provided assistance data.
##### 8.10.3.1.3 Location Information Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request position
measurements from the UE, or to enable the UE to provide location measurements
to the LMF for position calculation.
###### 8.10.3.1.3.1 LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure
Figure 8.10.3.1.3.1-1 shows the Location Information Transfer operations for
the Multi-RTT positioning method when the procedure is initiated by the LMF.
Figure 8.10.3.1.3.1-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure
(1) The LMF sends an LPP Request Location Information message to the UE. This
request includes indication of Multi-RTT measurements requested, including any
needed measurement configuration information, and required response time.
(2) The UE obtains Multi-RTT measurements as requested in step 1. The UE then
sends an LPP Provide Location Information message to the LMF, before the
Response Time provided in step (1) elapsed, and includes the obtained Multi-
RTT measurements. If the UE is unable to perform the requested measurements,
or the Response Time elapsed before any of the requested measurements were
obtained, the UE returns any information that can be provided in an LPP
message of type Provide Location Information which includes a cause indication
for the not provided location information.
###### 8.10.3.1.3.2 UE-initiated Location Information Delivery procedure
Figure 8.10.3.1.3.2-1 shows the Location Information Delivery procedure
operations for the Multi-RTT positioning method when the procedure is
initiated by the UE.
Figure 8.10.3.1.3.2-1: UE-initiated Location Information Delivery Procedure.
(1) The UE sends an LPP Provide Location Information message to the LMF. The
Provide Location Information message may include any UE Multi-RTT measurements
already available at the UE.
#### 8.10.3.2 Procedures between LMF and gNB
##### 8.10.3.2.1 Assistance Data Delivery between LMF and gNB
The purpose of these procedures is to enable the gNB to provide assistance
data described in Table 8.10.2.3-1 to the LMF, for subsequent delivery to the
UE using the procedures of clause 8.10.3.1.2.1 or for use in the calculation
of positioning estimates at the LMF or enable the LMF to request UL-SRS
configuration information from the serving gNB of a target UE.
Figure 8.10.3.2.1-1 shows the TRP Information Exchange operation from the gNB
to the LMF for the Multi-RTT positioning method.
Figure 8.10.3.2.1-1: LMF-initiated TRP Information Exchange Procedure
(1) The LMF determines that certain TRP configuration information is desired
(e.g., as part of a periodic update or as triggered by OAM) and sends an NRPPa
TRP INFORMATION REQUEST message to the gNB. This request includes an
indication of which specific TRP configuration information is requested.
(2) The gNB provides the requested TRP information in an NRPPa TRP INFORMATION
RESPONSE message, if available at the gNB. If the gNB is not able to provide
any information, it returns an TRP INFORMATION FAILURE message indicating the
cause of the failure.
Figure 8.10.3.2.1-2 shows the UL information Delivery operation from the
serving gNB to the LMF.
Figure 8.10.3.2.1-2: LMF-initiated UL Information Request Procedure
(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message POSITIONING INFORMATION REQUEST to the
serving gNB of the target UE to request UE SRS configuration information. If
the message includes the Requested UL-SRS Transmission Characteristics as
listed in Table 8.10.2.4-1, the gNB should take this information into account
when configuring UL-SRS transmissions for the UE.
(2) The serving gNB determines the UE SRS configuration to be allocated for
the UE and sends NRPPa message POSITIONING INFORMATION RESPONSE to the LMF
that includes the UE SRS configuration defined in Table 8.10.2.3-2. If the
serving gNB is not able to provide the requested information, it returns a
failure message indicating the cause of the failure.
(3) If a change has occurred in the UE SRS configuration during the UE SRS
time duration requested at step 1, the gNB sends a POSITIONING INFORMATION
UPDATE message to the LMF. This message contains, in the case of a change in
UE SRS configuration parameters, the UE SRS configuration information for all
cells with UE SRS configured, or an indication that the UE SRS configuration
has been released in the UE.
##### 8.10.3.2.2 Location Information Transfer/Assistance Data Transfer
Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request position
measurements from a gNB for position calculation of the UE and also provide
necessary assistance data to the gNB.
Figure 8.10.3.2.2-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to perform
this procedure.
Figure 8.10.3.2.2-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure
(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message to the selected gNB to request Multi-RTT
measurement information. The message includes any information required for the
gNB to perform the measurements as defined in Table 8.10.2.4-2.
(2) If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to \"on demand\", the gNB
obtains the requested Multi-RTT measurements and returns them in a Measurement
Response message to the LMF. The Measurement Response message includes the
obtained Multi-RTT measurements as defined in Table 8.10.2.3-3.
If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to \"periodic\", the gNB
replies with a Measurement Response message without including any measurements
in the message. The gNB then periodically initiates the Measurement Report
procedure in step 3 for the Multi-RTT measurements, with the requested
reporting periodicity.\ \ If the gNB is not able to accept the Measurement
Request message in step 1, the gNB returns a failure message indicating the
cause of the failure.
(3) The gNB periodically provides the Multi-RTT measurements as defined in
Table 8.10.2.3-3. to the LMF if that was requested at step 1.
(4) At any time after step 2, the LMF may send a Measurement Update message to
the gNB providing updated information required for the gNB to perform the
Multi-RTT measurements as defined in Table 8.10.2.4-2. Upon receiving the
message, the gNB overwrites the previously received measurement configuration
information.
(5) If the previously requested Multi-RTT measurements can no longer be
reported, the gNB notifies the LMF by sending a Measurement Failure Indication
message.
(6) When the LMF wants to abort an ongoing Multi-RTT measurement it sends a
Measurement Abort message to the gNB.
##### 8.10.3.2.3 Positioning Activation/Deactivation Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request activation and
deactivation of UL-SRS transmission of the target UE.
Figure 8.10.3.2.3-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to perform
this procedure.
Figure 8.10.3.2.3-1: Positioning Activation/Deactivation Procedure.
(1) The LMF sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Request message to the
serving gNB of the target UE to request UL-SRS activation for the target UE.
For a semi-persistent UL-SRS, the message includes an indication of an UL-SRS
resource set to be activated and may include information that indicates the
spatial relation for the semi-persistent UL-SRS resource to be activated, as
listed in Table 8.10.2.4-3. For an aperiodic UL-SRS, the message may include
aperiodic SRS Resource trigger list to indicate the UL-SRS resource to be
activated.
(2) For semi-persistent UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate the
configured semi-persistent UL-SRS resource sets by sending the SP Positioning
SRS Activation/Deactivation MAC CE command as specified in TS 38.321 [39]. For
aperiodic UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate the configured aperiodic
UL-SRS resource sets by sending the DCI as specified in TS 38.212 [40].\ If
the UL-SRS has been successfully activated as requested in step 1, the gNB
sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response message to the LMF. The
serving gNB may include a system frame number and a slot number in the NRPPa
Positioning Activation Response message to the LMF. If the serving gNB is not
able to fulfil the request from step 1, it returns the Positioning Activation
Failure message indicating the cause of the failure.
(3) If a previously activated UL-SRS should be deactivated, or the UL-SRS
transmission should be released, the LMF sends the NRPPa Positioning
Deactivation message to the serving gNB of the target device to request
deactivation of UL-SRS resource sets, or release all the UL-SRS resources.
This message includes an indication of the UL-SRS resource set to be
deactivated, or an indication of releasing all UL-SRS resources.
### 8.10.4 Sequence of Procedure for Multi-RTT positioning

activation of UE SRS transmission by sending a NRPPa Positioning Activation
Request message to the serving gNB of the target device as described in clause
8.10.3.2.3. The gNB then activates the UE SRS transmission and sends a NRPPa
Positioning Activation Response message. The target device begins the UL-SRS
transmission according to the time domain behavior of UL-SRS resource
configuration.
6\. The LMF provides the UL information to the selected gNBs in a NRPPa
MEASUREMENT REQUEST message as described in clause 8.10.3.2.2. The message
includes all information required to enable the gNBs/TRPs to perform the UL
measurements.
7\. The LMF sends a LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the target device
as described in clause 8.10.3.1.2.1. The message includes any required
assistance data for the target device to perform the necessary DL-PRS
measurements.
8\. The LMF sends a LPP Request Location Information message to request Multi-
RTT measurements.
9a: The target device performs the DL-PRS measurements from all gNBs provided
in the assistance data at step 7.
9b: Each gNB configured at step 6 measures the UE SRS transmissions from the
target device.
10\. The target device reports the DL-PRS measurements for Multi-RTT to the
LMF in a LPP Provide Location Information message.
11\. Each gNB reports the UE SRS measurements to the LMF in a NRPPa
Measurement Response message as described in clause 8.10.3.2.2.
12\. The LMF sends a NRPPa POSITIONING DEACTIVATION message to the serving gNB
as described in clause 8.10.3.2.3.
13\. The LMF determines the RTTs from the UE and gNB Rx-Tx time difference
measurements for each gNB for which corresponding UL and DL measurements were
provided at steps 10 and 11 and calculates the position of the target device.
## 8.11 DL-AoD positioning
### 8.11.1 General
In the DL-AoD positioning method, the UE position is estimated based on DL-
PRS-RSRP measurements taken at the UE of downlink radio signals from multiple
NR TRPs, along with knowledge of the spatial information of the downlink radio
signals and geographical coordinates of the TRPs.
The UE while connected to a gNB may require measurement gaps to perform the
DL-AoD measurements from NR TRPs. The UE may request measurement gaps from a
gNB using the procedure described in clause 7.4.1.1.
The specific positioning techniques used to estimate the UE\'s location from
this information are beyond the scope of this specification.

RSTD (and optionally DL-PRS-RSRP) measurements taken at the UE of downlink
radio signals from multiple NR TRPs, along with knowledge of the geographical
coordinates of the TRPs and their relative downlink timing.
The UE while connected to a gNB may require measurement gaps to perform the
DL-TDOA measurements from NR TRPs. The UE may request measurement gaps from a
gNB using the procedure described in clause 7.4.1.1.
The specific positioning techniques used to estimate the UE\'s location from
this information are beyond the scope of this specification.

RESPONSE message, if available at the gNB. If the gNB is not able to provide
any information, it returns an TRP INFORMATION FAILURE message indicating the
cause of the failure.
## 8.13 UL-TDOA positioning
### 8.13.1 General
In the UL-TDOA positioning method, the UE position is estimated based on UL-
RTOA (and optionally UL-SRS-RSRP) measurements taken at different TRPs of
uplink radio signals from UE, along with other configuration information.
The specifics of any UL-TDOA positioning methods or techniques used to
estimate the UE\'s location from these measurements are beyond the scope of
this specification.
In order to obtain uplink measurements, the TRPs need to know the
characteristics of the SRS signal transmitted by the UE for the time period
required to perform uplink measurement. These characteristics should be static
over the periodic transmission of SRS during the uplink measurements. Hence,
the LMF will indicate to the serving gNB the need to direct the UE to transmit
SRS signals for uplink positioning. It is up to the serving gNB to make the
final decision on resources to be assigned and to communicate this SRS
configuration information back to the LMF so that LMF can forward the SRS
configuration to the TRPs. The gNB may decide (e.g., in case no resources are
available) to configure no resources for the UE and report the empty resource
configuration to the LMF.
### 8.13.2 Information to be transferred between NG-RAN/5GC Elements

measurements obtained by the gNB and provided to the LMF using NRPPa.
#### 8.13.3.1 Capability Transfer Procedure
The Capability Transfer procedure for UL-TDOA positioning is described in
clause 7.1.2.1.
#### 8.13.3.2 Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
##### 8.13.3.2.1 Assistance Data Delivery between LMF and gNB
The purpose of these procedures is to enable the gNB to provide assistance
data described in Table 8.13.2.0-1 to the LMF, for subsequent delivery to the
gNB using the procedures of clause 8.13.3.3 or for use in the calculation of
positioning estimates at the LMF or enable the LMF to request UL-SRS
configuration information from the serving gNB of a target UE.
Figure 8.13.3.2.1-1 shows the UL information Delivery operation from the
serving gNB to the LMF.
Figure 8.13.3.2.1-1: LMF-initiated UL Information Request Procedure
(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message POSITIONING INFORMATION REQUEST to the
serving gNB of the target UE to request UE SRS configuration information. If
the message includes the Requested UL-SRS Transmission Characteristics as
listed in Table 8.13.2.3-1, the gNB should take this information into account
when configuring UL-SRS transmissions for the UE.
(2) The serving gNB determines the UE SRS configuration to be allocated for
the UE and sends NRPPa message POSITIONING INFORMATION RESPONSE to the LMF
that includes the UE SRS configuration defined in Table 8.13.2.1-1. If the
serving gNB is not able to provide the requested information, it returns a
failure message indicating the cause of the failure.
(3) If a change has occurred in the UE SRS configuration during the UE SRS
time duration requested at step 1, the gNB sends a POSITIONING INFORMATION
UPDATE message to the LMF. This message contains, in the case of a change in
UE SRS configuration parameters, the UE SRS configuration information for all
cells with UE SRS configured, or an indication that the UE SRS configuration
has been released in the UE.
Figure 8.13.3.2.1-2 shows the TRP Information Exchange operation from the gNB
to the LMF for the UL-TDOA positioning method.
Figure 8.13.3.2.1-2: LMF-initiated TRP Information Exchange Procedure
(1) The LMF determines that certain TRP configuration information is desired
(e.g., as part of a periodic update or as triggered by OAM) and sends an NRPPa
TRP INFORMATION REQUEST message to the gNB. This request includes an
indication of which specific TRP configuration information is requested.
(2) The gNB provides the requested TRP information in an NRPPa TRP INFORMATION
RESPONSE message, if available at the gNB. If the gNB is not able to provide
any information, it returns an TRP INFORMATION FAILURE message indicating the
cause of the failure.
#### 8.13.3.3 Location Information Transfer/Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request position
measurements from a gNB for position calculation of the UE and also provide
necessary assistance data to the gNB.
Figure 8.13.3.3-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to perform
this procedure.
Figure 8.13.3.3-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure
(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message to the selected gNB to request UL-TDOA
measurement information. The message includes any information required for the
gNB to perform the measurements as defined in Table 8.13.2.3-2.
(2) If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to \"on demand\", the gNB
obtains the requested UL-TDOA measurements and returns them in a Measurement
Response message to the LMF. The Measurement Response message includes the
obtained UL-TDOA measurements as defined in Table 8.13.2.2-1.
If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to \"periodic\", the gNB
replies with a Measurement Response message without including any measurements
in the message. The gNB then periodically initiates the Measurement Report
procedure in step 3 for the UL-TDOA measurements, with the requested reporting
periodicity.\ \ If the gNB is not able to accept the Measurement Request
message in step 1, the gNB returns a failure message indicating the cause of
the failure.
(3) The gNB periodically provides the UL-TDOA measurements as defined in Table
8.13.2.2-1 to the LMF if that was requested at step 1.
(4) At any time after step 2, the LMF may send a Measurement Update message to
the gNB providing updated information required for the gNB to perform the UL-
TDOA measurements as defined in Table 8.13.2.3-2. Upon receiving the message,
the gNB overwrites the previously received measurement configuration
information.
(5) If the previously requested UL-TDOA measurements can no longer be
reported, the gNB notifies the LMF by sending a Measurement Failure Indication
message.
(6) When the LMF wants to abort an ongoing UL-TDOA measurement it sends a
Measurement Abort message to the gNB.
#### 8.13.3.3a Positioning Activation/Deactivation Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request activation and
deactivation of UL-SRS transmission of the target UE.
Figure 8.13.3.3a-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to perform
this procedure.
Figure 8.13.3.3a-1: Positioning Activation/Deactivation Procedure.
(1) The LMF sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Request message to the
serving gNB of the target UE to request UL-SRS activation for the target UE.
For a semi-persistent UL-SRS, the message includes an indication of an UL-SRS
resource set to be activated and may include information that indicates the
spatial relation for the semi-persistent UL-SRS resource to be activated, as
listed in Table 8.13.2.3-3. For an aperiodic UL-SRS, the message may include
aperiodic SRS Resource trigger list to indicate the UL-SRS resource to be
activated.
(2) For semi-persistent UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate the
configured semi-persistent UL-SRS resource sets by sending the SP Positioning
SRS Activation/Deactivation MAC CE command as specified in TS 38.321 [39]. For
aperiodic UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate the configured aperiodic
UL-SRS resource sets by sending the DCI as specified in TS 38.212 [40].\ If
the UL-SRS has been successfully activated as requested in step 1, the gNB
sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response message to the LMF. If the
serving gNB is not able to fulfil the request from step 1, it returns the
Positioning Activation Failure message indicating the cause of the failure.
The serving gNB may include a system frame number and a slot number in the
NRPPa Positioning Activation Response message to the LMF.
(3) If a previously activated UL-SRS should be deactivated, or the UL-SRS
transmission should be released, the LMF sends the NRPPa Positioning
Deactivation message to the serving gNB of the target device to request
deactivation of UL-SRS resource sets, or release all the UL-SRS resources.
This message includes an indication of the UL-SRS resource set to be
deactivated, or an indication of releasing all UL-SRS resources.
#### 8.13.3.4 Sequence of Procedure for UL-TDOA positioning

5\. In the case of semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS, the LMF may request
activation of UE SRS transmission by sending the NRPPa Positioning Activation
Request message to the serving gNB of the target device as described in clause
8.13.3.3a. The gNB then activates the UL-SRS transmission and sends the NRPPa
Positioning Activation Response message. The target device begins the UL-SRS
transmission according to the time domain behavior of UL-SRS resource
configuration.
6\. The LMF provides the UL-SRS configuration to the selected gNBs in a NRPPa
MEASUREMENT REQUEST message as described in clause 8.13.3.3. The message
includes all information required to enable the gNBs/TRPs to perform the UL
measurements.
7\. Each gNB configured at step 6 measures the UL-SRS transmissions from the
target device.
8\. Each gNB reports the UL-SRS measurements to the LMF in a NRPPa Measurement
Response message as described in clause 8.13.3.3.
9\. The LMF sends a NRPPa POSITIONING DEACTIVATION message to the serving gNB
as described in clause 8.13.3.3a.
## 8.14 UL-AoA positioning
### 8.14.1 General
In the UL-AoA positioning method, the UE position is estimated based on UL-AoA
(and optionally UL-SRS-RSRP) of uplink radio signals taken at different TRPs,
along with other configuration information.
The specific of any UL-AoA positioning methods or techniques used to estimate
the UE\'s location from these measurements are beyond the scope of this
specification.
In order to obtain uplink measurements, the TRPs need to know the
characteristics of the SRS signal transmitted by the UE for the time period
required to calculate uplink measurement. These characteristics should be

##### 8.14.3.2.1 Assistance Data Delivery between LMF and gNB
The purpose of these procedures is to enable the gNB to provide assistance
data described in Table 8.14.2.0-1 to the LMF, for subsequent delivery to the
gNB using the procedures of clause 8.14.3.3 or for use in the calculation of
positioning estimates at the LMF or enable the LMF to request UL-SRS
configuration information from the serving gNB of a target UE.
Figure 8.14.3.2.1-1 shows the UL information Delivery operation from the
serving gNB to the LMF.
Figure 8.14.3.2.1-1: LMF-initiated UL Information Request Procedure
(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message POSITIONING INFORMATION REQUEST to the
serving gNB of the target UE to request UE SRS configuration information. If
the message includes the Requested UL-SRS Transmission Characteristics as
listed in Table 8.14.2.3-1, the gNB should take this information into account
when configuring UL-SRS transmissions for the UE.
(2) The serving gNB determines the UE SRS configuration to be allocated for
the UE and sends NRPPa message POSITIONING INFORMATION RESPONSE to the LMF
that includes the UE SRS configuration defined in Table 8.14.2.1-1. If the
serving gNB is not able to provide the requested information, it returns a
failure message indicating the cause of the failure.
(3) If a change has occurred in the UE SRS configuration during the UE SRS
time duration requested at step 1, the gNB sends a POSITIONING INFORMATION
UPDATE message to the LMF. This message contains, in the case of a change in
UE SRS configuration parameters, the UE SRS configuration information for all
cells with UE SRS configured, or an indication that the UE SRS configuration
has been released in the UE.
Figure 8.14.3.2.1-2 shows the TRP Information Exchange operation from the gNB
to the LMF for the UL-AoA positioning method.
Figure 8.14.3.2.1-2: LMF-initiated TRP Information Exchange Procedure
(1) The LMF determines that certain TRP configuration information is desired
(e.g., as part of a periodic update or as triggered by OAM) and sends an NRPPa
TRP INFORMATION REQUEST message to the gNB. This request includes an
indication of which specific TRP configuration information is requested.
(2) The gNB provides the requested TRP information in an NRPPa TRP INFORMATION
RESPONSE message, if available at the gNB. If the gNB is not able to provide
any information, it returns an TRP INFORMATION FAILURE message indicating the
cause of the failure.
#### 8.14.3.3 Location Information Transfer/Assistance Data Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request position
measurements from a gNB for position calculation of the UE and also provide
necessary assistance data to the gNB.
Figure 8.14.3.3-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to perform
this procedure.
Figure 8.14.3.3-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer Procedure
(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message to the selected gNB to request UL-AoA
measurement information. The message includes any information required for the
gNB to perform the measurements as defined in Table 8.14.2.3-2.
(2) If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to \"on demand\", the gNB
obtains the requested UL-AoA measurements and returns them in a Measurement
Response message to the LMF. The Measurement Response message includes the
obtained UL-AoA measurements as defined in Table 8.14.2.2-1.
If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to \"periodic\", the gNB
replies with a Measurement Response message without including any measurements
in the message. The gNB then periodically initiates the Measurement Report
procedure in step 3 for the UL-AoA measurements, with the requested reporting
periodicity.\ \ If the gNB is not able to accept the Measurement Request
message in step 1, the gNB returns a failure message indicating the cause of
the failure.
(3) The gNB periodically provides the UL-AoA measurements as defined in Table
8.14.2.2-1 to the LMF if that was requested at step 1.
(4) At any time after step 2, the LMF may send a Measurement Update message to
the gNB providing updated information required for the gNB to perform the UL-
AoA measurements as defined in Table 8.14.2.3-2. Upon receiving the message,
the gNB overwrites the previously received measurement configuration
information.
(5) If the previously requested UL-AoA measurements can no longer be reported,
the gNB notifies the LMF by sending a Measurement Failure Indication message.
(6) When the LMF wants to abort an ongoing UL-AoA measurement it sends a
Measurement Abort message to the gNB.
#### 8.14.3.3a Positioning Activation/Deactivation Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request activation and
deactivation of UL-SRS transmission of the target UE.
Figure 8.14.3.3a-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to perform
this procedure.
Figure 8.14.3.3a-1: Positioning Activation/Deactivation Procedure.
(1) The LMF sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Request message to the
serving gNB of the target UE to request UL-SRS activation for the target UE.
For a semi-persistent UL-SRS, the message includes an indication of an UL-SRS
resource set to be activated and may include information that indicates the
spatial relation for the semi-persistent UL-SRS resource to be activated, as
listed in Table 8.14.2.3-3. For an aperiodic UL-SRS, the message may include
aperiodic SRS Resource trigger list to indicate the UL-SRS resource to be
activated.
(2) For semi-persistent UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate the
configured semi-persistent UL-SRS resource sets by sending the SP Positioning
SRS Activation/Deactivation MAC CE command as specified in TS 38.321 [39]. For
aperiodic UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate the configured aperiodic
UL-SRS resource sets by sending the DCI as specified in TS 38.212 [40].\ If
the UL-SRS has been successfully activated as requested in step 1, the gNB
sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response message to the LMF. If the
serving gNB is not able to fulfil the request from step 1, it returns the
Positioning Activation Failure message indicating the cause of the failure.
The serving gNB includes a system frame number and a slot number in the NRPPa
Positioning Activation Response message to the LMF.
(3) If a previously activated UL-SRS should be deactivated, or the UL-SRS
transmission should be released, the LMF sends the NRPPa Positioning
Deactivation message to the serving gNB of the target device to request
deactivation of UL-SRS resource sets, or release all the UL-SRS resources.
This message includes an indication of the UL-SRS resource set to be
deactivated, or an indication of releasing all UL-SRS resources.
#### 8.14.3.4 Sequence of Procedure for UL-AoA positioning
Figure 8.14.3.4-1 shows the messaging between the LMF, the gNBs and the UE to
perform UL-AoA procedure.
Figure 8.14.3.4-1: UL-AoA positioning procedure
0\. The LMF may use the procedure in Figure 8.14.3.2.1-2 to obtain the TRP
information required for UL-AoA positioning.
1\. The LMF may request the positioning capabilities of the target device
using the LPP Capability Transfer procedure as described in clause 8.14.3.1.
2\. The LMF sends a NRPPa POSITIONING INFORMATION REQUEST message to the
serving gNB to request UL-SRS configuration information for the target device
as described in Figure 8.14.3.2.1-1.
3\. The serving gNB determines the resources available for UL-SRS and
configures the target device with the UL-SRS resource sets at step 3a.
4\. The serving gNB provides the UL-SRS configuration information to the LMF
in a NRPPa POSITIONING INFORMATION RESPONSE message.
5\. In the case of semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS, the LMF may request
activation of UE SRS transmission by sending the NRPPa Positioning Activation
Request message to the serving gNB of the target device as described in clause
8.14.3.3a. The gNB then activates the UL-SRS transmission and sends the NRPPa
Positioning Activation Response message. The target device begins the UL-SRS
transmission according to the time domain behavior of UL-SRS resource
configuration.
6\. The LMF provides the UL-SRS configuration to the selected gNBs in a NRPPa
MEASUREMENT REQUEST message as described in clause 8.14.3.3. The message
includes all information required to enable the gNBs/TRPs to perform the UL
measurements.
7\. Each gNB configured at step 6 measures the UL-SRS transmissions from the
target device.
8\. Each gNB reports the UL-SRS measurements to the LMF in a NRPPa Measurement
Response message as described in clause 8.14.3.3.
9\. The LMF sends a NRPPa POSITIONING DEACTIVATION message to the serving gNB
as described in clause 8.14.3.3a.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Use of LPP with SUPL
The design goal of LPP is to enable it to be used in user plane location
solutions such as OMA SUPL ([15], [16]) and this informative annex shows how
LPP can be used in SUPL 2.0.
## A.1 SUPL 2.0 Positioning Methods and Positioning Protocols
The following table shows how the 3GPP positioning protocols are supported in
SUPL 2.0.

NOTE: What is referred to in the SUPL specifications as \"Enhanced Cell ID\",
is a UE-Assisted positioning mode, where the neighbouring cell measurements
are carried at the SUPL layer (in the SUPL_POS_INIT for example). The ASN.1

}
It should be noted that in addition to the container provided by SUPL itself,
E-CID/NR E-CID positioning methods defined within LPP proper can be supported
in SUPL, via tunnelling LPP as shown in this annex (in the same manner that
A-GNSS, OTDOA, Barometric Pressure Sensors, WLAN, Bluetooth and TBS are
supported).
## A.2 SUPL 2.0 and NR Architecture
This clause describes interworking between the control-plane LCS architecture,
as defined in the main body of this specification, and SUPL 2.0. Similarly, to
the E-SMLC in the LTE architecture (TS 36.305 [25]), the LMF either includes
or has an interface to an SPC function, as defined in OMA SUPL V2.0 ([15],
[16]). It can thus provide a consistent set of positioning methods for
deployments utilizing both control-plane and user-plane.
The interworking does not enable use of user-plane signalling for part of a
control-plane positioning session. The user plane in the interworking here is
not intended as an alternative path for control-plane signalling that would be
needed between UE and NG-RAN for mechanisms such as A-GPS in a standalone
control-plane solution.
This interworking does enable the SPC to retrieve measurements (e.g., GNSS-to-
RAN time relations) from the NG-RAN.
The underlying architecture is shown in Figure A.2-1 (TS 23.501 [2]). Note
that, for interworking between user-plane and control-plane positioning, no
new interfaces need to be defined as compared to those in the figure, assuming
the SPC is either integrated in the LMF or attached to it with a proprietary
interface.
Figure A.2-1: System reference architecture reference for Location Services in
reference point representation
The Lup and Llp interfaces shown in this architecture are part of the user-
plane solution only and are not required for control-plane positioning.
## A.3 LPP session procedures using SUPL
This clause indicates how an LPP session relates to the SUPL message set.
Figure A.3-1 shows how SUPL and LPP can be combined within a SUPL positioning
session. Step 4 here is repeated to exchange multiple LPP messages between the
SLP and SET.
Figure A.3-1: LPP session over SUPL
For positioning operations which take place entirely within an LPP session
(step 4 in Figure A.3-1), the flow of LPP messages can be the same as in the
control-plane version of LPP; the role of the (LPP) target is taken by the
target SET, and that of the (LPP) server by the SLP. An example LPP flow,
including exchange of capabilities, request and delivery of assistance data,
and request and delivery of positioning information, is shown in Figure A.3-2.
Figure A.3-2: LPP session over SUPL
## A.4 Procedures combining C-plane and U-plane operations
Since SUPL by definition is carried over the user plane, it is not applicable
to operations terminating at the NG-RAN. SUPL operations must take place in
combination with control-plane procedures over NRPPa.
This situation could arise in the case of UE-assisted OTDOA, for example, in
which the SLP needs to provide the UE (in a SUPL session) with assistance data
supplied by the NG-RAN. This clause uses a UE-assisted OTDOA positioning
operation as an example.
Although the positioning server in this operation is the SLP, the existence of
an interface to the LMF means that the SLP can communicate with the LMF via
the SPC. In particular, this means that assistance data that was delivered to
the LMF via NRPPa can be transferred over to the SLP for delivery to the UE
via LPP over SUPL.
There are several ways to realise this general behaviour. In the simplest
case, the LMF could be supplied with the necessary assistance data in advance,
so that it can be supplied to the SLP without any actual NRPPa procedures
taking place in real time (and possibly even before the positioning
transaction begins).
Figure A.4-1: Transfer of OTDOA assistance data to UE via SUPL
In the event that the LMF does not have the required assistance data
available, it would need to retrieve them from the NG-RAN once it was made
aware that they were needed.
Figure A.4-2: Transfer to the UE via SUPL of OTDOA assistance data not already
available at the LMF
In both cases, it should be noted that the retrieval of the assistance data is
transparent to the UE and to the actual SUPL session. This model is parallel
to the approach used with A-GNSS, in which assistance data such as satellite
ephemerides are retrieved from sources entirely external to the cellular
network. For purposes of LPP over SUPL, the delivery of assistance data to the
SLP can be viewed as an independent external process.
The delivery of assistance data to the UE, however, takes place through the
same mechanisms as control-plane LPP, transported through SUPL.
