# 1 Scope
The present document specifies and contains the derivation of Test Points for
NR RF test cases, thereby 3GPP TSG RAN WG5 will have a way of storing the
input contributions provided. The test cases are described in TS38.521-1[2],
TS38.521-2[3] and TS38.521-3[4],
The test cases which have been analysed to determine Test Points are included
as .zip files.
The present document is applicable from Release 15 up to the release indicated
on the front page of the present Terminal conformance specifications.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.

reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.
