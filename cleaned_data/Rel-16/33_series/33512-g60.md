In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.

# 4 AMF-specific security requirements and related test cases
## 4.1 Introduction
AMF specific security requirements include both requirements derived from AMF-
specific security functional requirements in relevant specifications as well
as security requirements introduced in the present document derived from the
threats specific to AMF as described in TR 33.926 [6].
## 4.2 AMF-specific adaptations of security functional requirements and
related test cases.
### 4.2.1 Introduction
The present clause describes the security functional requirements and the
corresponding test cases for AMF network product class. The proposed security
requirements are classified in two groups:
\- Security functional requirements derived from TS 33.501 [2] and detailed in
clause 4.2.2.
\- General security functional requirements which include requirements not
already addressed in TS 33.501 [2] but whose support is also important to
ensure that AMF conforms to a common security baseline detailed in clause
4.2.3.
### 4.2.2 Security functional requirements on the AMF deriving from 3GPP
specifications and related test cases
#### 4.2.2.0 General
The general approach in TS 33.117 [3] clause 4.2.2.1 and all the requirements
and test cases in TS 33.117 [3] clause 4.2.2.2 related to SBA/SBI aspect apply
to the AMF network product class.
#### 4.2.2.1 Authentication and key agreement procedure
##### 4.2.2.1.1 Synchronization failure handling
_Requirement Name_ : Synchronization failure handling
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 33.501 [2], clause 6.1.3.3.2
_Requirement Description_ : \"Upon receiving an authentication failure message
with synchronisation failure (AUTS) from the UE, the SEAF sends an
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message with a \"synchronisation
failure indication\" to the AUSF.
An SEAF will not react to unsolicited \"synchronisation failure indication\"
messages from the UE.
The SEAF does not send new authentication requests to the UE before having
received the response to its Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request
message with a \"_synchronisation failure indication_ \" from the AUSF (or
before it is timed out).\"
as specified in TS 33.501[2], clause 6.1.3.3.2.

_synchronisation failure_ (AUTS).
2) The SEAF/AMF sends a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message
with a \"_synchronisation failure indication_ \" to the AUSF.
3) The AUSF sends a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message to
the SEAF/AMF immediately after receiving the request from the SEAF/AMF, to
make sure the SEAF/AMF will receive the response before timeout.
Test B:
1) The UE sends an authentication failure message to the SEAF/AMF with
_synchronisation failure_ (AUTS).
2) The SEAF/AMF sends a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message
with a \"_synchronisation failure indication_ \" to the AUSF.
3) The AUSF does not send a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response
message to the SEAF/AMF before timeout.
**Expected Results:**
Before receiving Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message from the
AUSF and before the timer for receiving Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate
Response message runs out,
For Test B, the SEAF/AMF does not send any new authentication request to the
UE.
For Test A, the SEAF/AMF may initiate new authentication towards the UE.

Response message to the SEAF that the verification of the RES* was not
successful in the AUSF, or

then the SEAF shall either reject the authentication by sending an
Authentication Reject to the UE if the SUCI was used by the UE in the initial
NAS message or the SEAF/AMF shall initiate an Identification procedure with
the UE if the 5G-GUTI was used by the UE in the initial NAS message to
