scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 5 Procedures
## 5.1 Security for the SEAL interfaces
### 5.1.1 Security for the Application plane interfaces
#### 5.1.1.1 SEAL-X1
As defined in TS 23.434 [2], the SEAL-X1 reference point, exists between the
key management server and the group management server and uses HTTP-1 as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2] for the transport and routing of security
related information to the group management server. The SEAL-X1 shall be
protected using HTTPS as defined in [3], [4] and [5]. The profile for TLS
implementation and usage shall follow the provisions given in 3GPP TS 33.310
[6], annex E.
#### 5.1.1.2 SEAL-X2
The SEAL-X2 reference point enables the group management server to interact
with the location management server as defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2]. The
SEAL-X2 shall be protected using HTTPS as defined in [3], [4] and [5]. The
profile for TLS implementation and usage shall follow the provisions given in
3GPP TS 33.310 [6], annex E.
#### 5.1.1.3 IM-UU
IM-UU reference point is used between the identity management client and the
identity management server. The IM-UU between the Identity Management client
and the Identity management server shall be protected using HTTPS as defined
in [3], [4] and [5]. The profile for TLS implementation and usage shall follow
the provisions given in 3GPP TS 33.310 [6], annex E.
#### 5.1.1.4 KM-UU and KM-S
The KM-UU reference point is used between the Key Management Client and Key
Management Server. The security mechanism of SEAL-UU shall also be used for
KM-UU.
The security established between the KM Server and the KM client should be
end-to-end. When this is not possible, then all client related material
transferred between the KM server and KM client should be end-to-end protected
with a mechanism that is out of scope of this specification.
The KM-S reference point is a direct HTTP connection used between the VAL
server and the key management server and shall be protected with the same
mechanism used for the SEAL-S reference point.
#### 5.1.1.5 SEAL-UU
A SEAL client interacts with a SEAL server over the generic SEAL-UU reference
point as defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2].. This interface shall be protected
using HTTPS as defined in [3], [4] and [5] when using HTTP. The profile for
TLS implementation and usage shall follow the provisions given in TS 33.310
[6], annex E.
#### 5.1.1.6 VAL-UU
The VAL client interacts with VAL server over VAL-UU reference point as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2].
NOTE: Security mechanism for the VAL-UU reference point is out of scope of
present document.
#### 5.1.1.7 SEAL-C
The VAL client interacts with a SEAL client over the SEAL-C reference point as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2]. This reference point resides fully within the
UE and therefore, security of this interface is left to the manufacturer and
is out of scope for the present document.
#### 5.1.1.8 SEAL-S
The VAL server interacts with SEAL server over SEAL-S reference point as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2]. The protection of this interface shall be
supported according to NDS/IP as specified in TS 33.210 [14].
When CAPIF is used as specified in TS 23.434 [2], the security mechanism for
CAPIF specified in TS 33.122 [18] shall be followed. CAPIF core function shall
choose the appropriate CAPIF-2e security method as defined in the sub-clause
6.5.2 in TS 33.122 [18] for mutual authentication and protection of the SEAL
server -- VAL server interface. Before invoking the API exposed by the SEAL
server, the VAL server as API invoker shall negotiate the security method
(TLS-PSK, PKI or TLS with OAuth token) with CAPIF core function and ensure the
SEAL server has information to authenticate the VAL server.
#### 5.1.1.9 SEAL-E
A SEAL server interacts with another SEAL server over SEAL-E reference point
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2]. The protection of this interface shall be
supported according to NDS/IP as specified in TS 33.210 [14].
### 5.1.2 Security for the Signalling control plane interfaces
#### 5.1.2.1 Security for HTTP interfaces
In order to authenticate the HTTP-1 reference point, authentication mechanisms
shall be performed between the HTTP client and VAL UE using either certificate
based authentication or pre-shared key based authentication. Certificate based
authentication shall follow in annex B of 3GPP TS 33.222 [15], and the
profiles given in 3GPP TS 33.310 [6]. The usage of pre-shared key based
ciphersuites is specified in the TLS profile given in 3GPP TS 33.310 [6],
annex E.
The HTTP-1 reference point exists between the VAL UE and the HTTP proxy. The
HTTP-2 exists between the HTTP proxy and HTTP server. The HTTP-3 reference
point exists between the HTTP proxies in different networks. The HTTP
interfaces shall be protected using TLS. The profile for TLS implementation
and usage shall follow the provisions given in 3GPP TS 33.310 [6], annex E.
### 5.1.3 Security for the network domain interfaces
A VAL UE shall perform the authentication and security mechanisms as specified
in 3GPP TS 33.501 [16] for 5G network access security.
To ensure security of the interfaces between network entities within a trusted
domain and between trusted domains, 3GPP TS 33.210 [14] shall be applied to
secure signalling messages on the reference points unless specified otherwise.
SEG as specified in 3GPP TS 33.210 [14] may be used in the trusted domain to
terminate the IPsec tunnel.
## 5.2 User authentication and authorization
### 5.2.1 VAL user authentication
Figure 5.2.3-1 shows the Identity Management functional model which consists
of the SEAL Identity Management Server (SIM-S) and SEAL Identity Management
Client (SIM-C) of the UE. The IM-UU reference point between the SIM-S and
SIM-C shall provide the interface for user authentication and shall support
OpenID Connect 1.0 [5] and OAuth 2.0 [9], [10] to obtain an access token for
the VAL UE.
### 5.2.2 SEAL service authorization
SEAL Service Authorization procedure shall validate the VAL user to access the
SEAL services. In order to gain access to SEAL services, the SEAL client shall
present an access token to the SEAL server for each service of interest. If
the access token is valid, then the client shall be granted to use the
service.
### 5.2.3 Identity management functional model
The SEAL Identity Management Server (SIM-S) and the SEAL Identity Management
Client (SIM-C) provide the endpoints for VAL user authentication as shown in
the SEAL Identity Management functional model in figure 5.2.3-1.
The reference point IM-UU utilizes Uu reference point as described in 3GPP TS
23.401 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]. IM-UU shall support OpenID Connect 1.0 [5]
and OAuth 2.0 [9] for VAL user authentication.
{width="6.45in" height="2.45in"}
Figure 5.2.3-1: Functional model for SEAL Identity Management
In order to support VAL user authentication, the SIM-S shall be provisioned
with the VAL user ID and VAL service IDs (usage of VAL user ID and VAL service
ID is described in clause 7 of TS 23.434 [2]). A mapping between the VAL user
ID and VAL service ID(s) shall be created and maintained in the SIM-S. When a
VAL user wishes to authenticate for the VAL services, the VAL user ID and
credentials are provided via the UE Identity management client to the SIM-S as
per OpenID Connect 1.0 [5]. The SIM-S receives and shall verify the VAL user
ID and credentials. If verification is successful, then the SIM-S returns an
ID token, refresh token and access token to the UE Identity management client.
The SIM-C shall learn the user\'s VAL service ID(s) from the ID token. Table A
shows the SEAL specific tokens and their usage.
Table 5.2.3-1: VAL UE authentication token
Token Type Consumer of the Token Description
* * *
ID token VAL UE client(s) Contains the VAL service ID for at least one
authorized VAL service. Access token SKM-S, SEAL service server(s) Short-lived
token (definable in the SIM-S) that conveys the UE\'s identity. This token
contains the VAL service ID for at least one authorized service. Refresh token
SIM-S (Authorization Server) Allows VAL UE to obtain a new access token
without forcing user to log in again.
To support the VAL service identity functional model, the VAL service ID(s):
\- Shall be provisioned into the SEAL Identity management database and mapped
to VAL UE IDs.
\- Shall be provisioned into the SEAL Key management server (SKM-S) and mapped
to UE specific key material.
### 5.2.4 Authentication framework
Figure 5.2.4-1 describes the VAL Authentication Framework using the OpenID
Connect protocol. It describes the steps by which a VAL UE authenticates to
the SIM-S, resulting in a set of credentials delivered to the UE uniquely
identifying the VAL service ID(s). The authentication framework supports
extensible user authentication solutions based on the VAL service provider
policy (shown as step 3). User authentication methods in support of step 3
(e.g. biometrics, secureID, etc.) are possible but not defined here.
Figure 5.2.4-1: OpenID Connect (OIDC) flow supporting VAL user authentication
Step 1: VAL UE establishes a secure tunnel with the SIM-S.
Step 2: VAL UE sends an OpenID Connect Authentication Request to the SIM-S.
The request may contain an indication of authentication methods supported by
the UE.
Step 3: User Authentication is performed between VAL UE and the SIM-S.
NOTE: The primary credentials for user authentication (e.g. biometrics,
secureID, OTP, username/password) are based on VAL service provider policy.
The method chosen by the VAL service provider for authentication and
authorization is neither defined nor limited by the present document, it
depends on the Vertical services and authentication and authorization methods
supported by it.
Step 4: SIM-S sends an OpenID Connect Authentication Response to the UE
containing an authorization code.
Step 5: UE sends an OpenID Connect Token Request to the SIM-S, passing the
authorization code.
Step 6: SIM-S sends an OpenID Connect Token Response to the UE containing an
ID token and an access token (each which uniquely identify the user of the VAL
service or key management service). The ID token is consumed by the UE to
personalize the VAL client for the VAL user, and the access token is used by
the UE to communicate and authorize the identity of the VAL user to the VAL
server(s) and the VAL services.
### 5.2.5 Authorization framework
Authorization framework is shown in figure 5.2.5-1. A secure HTTP tunnel using
HTTPS between VAL UE and VAL server shall be established before VAL service
authorization. Subsequent VAL service authorization messaging make use of this
tunnel. The service clients in the VAL UE present the access tokens to the VAL
server over HTTP. The VAL server authorizes the user for the requested
services only if the access token is valid. The procedures may be repeated as
necessary to obtain additional VAL user authorizations.
{width="6.375in" height="2.0083333333333333in"}
Figure 5.2.5-1: VAL User Service Authorization
After the VAL UE establishing a secure connection with the VAL server, the VAL
UE sends an HTTP message containing the access token to the VAL server where
service authorization is requested. The VAL server receives the message and
validates the access token. If the access token is valid, The VAL server
positively acknowledges the request. The VAL server may provide service
related information to the VAL UE at this time.
### 5.2.6 VAL service authorization
The VAL service authorization procedure shall validate the VAL user authorized
to access the VAL services. In order to gain access to VAL services, the VAL
client shall present an access token to the VAL server for each VAL service of
interest (see clause 5.2.5). If the access token is valid, then the VAL client
shall be granted use of the requested VAL service.
## 5.3 SEAL key management procedure
### 5.3.1 General
To enable security for VAL services, a SEAL KM client (located in either a
SEAL UE or VAL server) may request key material applicable to a particular VAL
service, VAL client or user.
Prior to making a key management request to the SEAL KMS (SKM-S), the VAL
client or VAL user shall be authenticated by the SEAL identity management
service (clause 5.2). In addition, secure connections shall be established
between the SEAL client and the SKM-S (reference point KM-UU) and the VAL
server and the SKM-S (reference point KM-S) prior to any associated key
management requests.
As a result of the SEAL identity management authentication procedure, an
access token scoped for key management services is provisioned to the SEAL UE.
This access token is provided with each and every key management request to
the SKM-S.
A VAL server is provisioned with an access token scoped for SEAL key
management services and is provided with each and every key management request
to the SKM-S. The method for provisioning this access token into the VAL
server is out of scope of the present document.
Figure 5.3.1-1 shows the SEAL key management procedure. A SKM client may send
a SEAL KM Request message to the SKM-S. The SKM-S validates and processes the
request and responds with a SEAL KM Response message. The response contains
key management material specific to the SEAL service or the VAL server
request, or alternatively, an error code if the SKM-S encounters a failure
condition.
Figure 5.3.1-1: SEAL key management procedure
The procedure in figure 5.3.1-1 is described here:
1\. The SKM-C establishes a direct HTTPS connection to the SKM-S. Steps 2 and
3 are within this secure connection.
2\. The SKM-C sends a SEAL KM Request message to the SKM-S. The request
contains the authorization credentials obtained during authentication and
message content specified in clause 5.3.2.
3\. The SKM-S authorizes the request and if valid, sends a SEAL KM Response
message containing the requested key material (or error code) as specified in
clause 5.3.3.
As a successful result of this procedure, the VAL UE or VAL Server has
securely obtained service specific key material for use within the VAL system.
### 5.3.2 SEAL KM Request message
A SKM-C may send a SEAL KM Request message to the SKM-S. This request shall be
protected (via the HTTPS tunnel) and shall contain the access token acquired
during the SEAL identity management authentication procedure (clause 5.2).
The content of the SEAL KM Request is shown in table 5.3.2-1.
Table 5.3.2-1: Contents of a SEAL KM Request
Name Description
* * *
Version The version number of the SEAL key management request . SKmsUri The
URI of the SKM-S to which the request is sent. ServiceID A string representing
the VAL service/application related to the VAL client request. ClientID
(Optional) A string representing the client. See note. DeviceID (Optional) A
string representing the device. See note. UserID (Optional) A string
representing the user. See note. Date/Time The Date and Time of the request.
This number represents the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as
measured in UTC. NOTE: Only one of these fields may be present in any given
SEAL KMS Request message.
The identities listed in table 5.3.2-1 map to SEAL identities defined in 3GPP
TS 23.434 [2]. Namely, the ServiceID maps to the VAL service identity (VAL
service ID), the ClientID maps to the VAL client or client on the VAL server,
the DeviceID maps to the VAL UE identity (VAL UE ID), and the UserID maps to
the VAL user identity (VAL user ID).
The 'Version' field identifies the version of the SEAL KM Request message. The
current version is defined as \"1.0.0\".
The 'Date/Time' field is used primarily as an anti-replay mechanism for SEAL
key management requests and responses. If the 'Date/Time' field is
significantly out of range (more than a few seconds), this could indicate a
replay attack.
Upon receipt of a SEAL KM Request message, the SKM-S shall verify that:
\- the access token is valid;
\- the signature is valid;
\- the SKmsUri is the SKM-S URI of the target SEAL KMS where the key
information is stored; and
\- the Date/Time is within a recent time window (e.g. 5 seconds).
If valid, the request is accepted and processed by the SKM-S. A standalone
ServiceID, or a ServiceID in combination with a ClientID, DeviceID, or UserID
may be present in the SEAL KM Request message. This combination may be used by
the KMS to identify a specific key material record. Each key management record
may be unique to a VAL application or VAL service. The format and content of a
key management record is defined and securely provisioned into the SEAL KMS by
the VAL application or VAL service owner/operator. The method used to
provision the VAL service or VAL application key material into the KMS is out
of scope for the present document. The method used to organize, manage, and
maintain VAL service or VAL application key material within the KMS is out of
scope of the present document.
### 5.3.3 SEAL KM Response message
The SEAL KM Response message is sent to the SKM-C in response to a SEAL KM
Request message.
A successful SEAL key management procedure results in a SEAL KM Response
message which typically includes a payload containing key management
information uniquely applicable to the requested service, client or user. If
an error occurs, an error code may be returned in the SEAL KM Response
message.
The SEAL KM Response message shall be protected in transit via the HTTPS
tunnel. The Payload within a SEAL KM Response message may be protected end-to-
end between the SKM-C and SKM-S depending on the applicability of the
underlying VAL service making the request. The method for securing a Payload
end-to-end between the SKM-C and the SKM-S is outside the scope of the present
document. The key material contents provided in a Payload are defined by the
underlying VAL service and are outside the scope of the present document.
The content of a SEAL KM Response message is shown in table 5.3.3-1.
Table 5.3.3-1: Contents of a SEAL KM Response message
Name Description
* * *
UserUri URI of the user for which the response is intended. SKmsUri The URI of
the SKM-S sending the response. ServiceID A string representing the VAL
service/application related to the VAL client request. This is the same field
as received in the SEAL KM Request message. SKmsID (Optional) The ID of the
SKM-S providing the response message. ClientID (Optional) A string
representing the client (see note) DeviceID (Optional) A string representing
the device (see note) UserID (Optional) A string representing the user. (see
note) Date/Time The Date and Time of the response. This number represents the
number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC. ErrorCode
(Optional) Reason code indicating the failure of the requested action. If not
present, the key management request is assumed to be successful. Payload
(Optional) Key management payload specific to the VAL user, client or
application. This field is not be present if an error occurs . NOTE: If this
field is present in the SEAL KM Request message then this field shall be
present in the SEAL KM Response message and shall be the same value.
The identities listed in table 5.3.3-1 are described in clause 5.3.2.
If the SKM-S does not encounter an error during processing of the SEAL KM
Request message, the SEAL KM Response message carries a set of security
parameters contained in the "Payload" field.
If the SKM-S encounters an error while processing the SEAL KM Request message,
an error value described in table 5.3.3-2 shall be returned in the 'ErrorCode'
field of the SEAL KM Response message and the 'Payload' field shall not be
present.
In the event of an error, the user and/or the operator of the VAL service, UE,
or client may be notified.
Table 5.3.3-2: 'ErrorCode' values
ErrorCode Description Maps To
* * *
01 Unspecified error "500 Internal Server Error" as described in Table 5.2.6-1
of TS 29.122 [17] 02 Key Information not available for specified service,
client, device or user. "404 Not Found" as described in Table 5.2.6-1 of TS
29.122 [17] 03 Request rejected "401 Unauthorized" as described in Table
5.2.6-1 of TS 29.122 [17] 04 Unable to validate request "400 Bad Request" or
"403 Forbidden" as described in Table 5.2.6-1 of TS 29.122 [17] 05-FF Reserved
N/A
The selection of the key material returned in the Payload of a SEAL KM
Response message is determined by the ServiceID and (optionally) the ClientID,
DeviceID or UserID. The combination of the ServiceID with the ClientID,
DeviceID or UserID allows the VAL service to request a more specific set of
key material.
For example, if a ClientID is included in the SEAL KM Request message, the KMS
may return a Payload that contains a set of client specific key material
applicable to the ClientID within the requesting VAL service (ServiceID). If
the DeviceID is included, the KMS may return a Payload that contains device
specific key material applicable to the DeviceID within the requesting VAL
service (ServiceID). If the UserID is included, the KMS may return a Payload
that contains user specific key material applicable to that UserID within the
requesting VAL service (ServiceID).
## 5.4 Security procedures for interconnection
Interconnection between a primary VAL system and a partner VAL system is
specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2].
A VAL client shall perform user authorization only to VAL servers within their
own VAL system. When communication is required by a VAL client from another
interconnected VAL system, user authorization takes place in the serving VAL
system and follows the VAL user service authorization procedures as defined in
clause 5.2.
VAL systems should protect themselves at the system border from external
attackers.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenID connect profile for VAL
# A.1 General
The information in this annex provides a normative description of the
Authentication and Authorization framework based on the OpenID Connect 1.0
standard. Characterization of the ID token, access token, how to obtain
tokens, how to validate tokens, and how to use the refresh token is explained.
The OpenID Connect 1.0 standard provides the source of the information
contained in this annex. This annex profiles the OpenID Connect standard and
includes the ID token and the access token, as well as the definition of VAL
specific scopes for key management, VAL services, configuration management,
and group management. This profile is compliant with OpenID Connect.

The ID Token shall be a JSON Web Token (JWT) and contain the following
standard and VAL token claims. Token claims provide information pertaining to
the authentication of the VAL client by the SIM-S as well as additional
claims. The following clause profiles the required standard and VAL claims for
the VAL Connect profile.
### A.2.1.2 Standard claims
These standard claims are defined by the OpenID Connect 1.0 specification and
are REQUIRED for VAL implementation. Other claims defined by OpenID Connect
are optional. The standards-based claims for a VAL Connect ID token are shown
in table A.2.1.2-1.
Table A.2.1.2-1: ID token standard claims
Parameter Description
* * *
Iss REQUIRED. The URL of the SIM-S. Sub REQUIRED. A case-sensitive, never
reassigned string (not to exceed 255 bytes), which uniquely identifies the VAL
user within the VAL server provider\'s domain. Aud REQUIRED. The Oauth 2.0
client_id of the SIM-C Exp REQUIRED. Implementers MAY provide for some small
leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew (not to
exceed 30 seconds) iat REQUIRED. Time at which the ID Token was issued. Its
value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from
1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.
### A.2.1.3 VAL claims
The VAL Connect profile extends the OpenID Connect standard claims with the
additional claims based on the VAL service.
## A.2.2 Access token
### A.2.2.1 Introduction
The access token is opaque to VAL clients and is consumed by the VAL resource
servers. The access token shall be encoded as a JSON Web Token as defined in
IETF RFC 7797 [11]. The access token shall include the JSON web digital
signature profile as defined in IETF RFC 7515 [12].
### A.2.2.2 Standard claims
VAL access tokens shall convey the following standards-based claims as defined
in IETF RFC 7662 [13].
Table A.2.2.2-1: Access token standard claims
Parameter Description
* * *
Exp REQUIRED. Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more
than a few minutes, to account for clock skew (not to exceed 30 seconds).
Scope REQUIRED. A JSON string containing a space-separated list of the
authorization scopes associated with this token. The scope(s) contained here
reflect the requested scope(s) from the Authentication Request (clause
A.4.2.2). client_id REQUIRED. The identifier of the SIM-C making the API
request as previously registered with the SIM-S.
### A.2.2.3 VAL claims
The VAL profile extends the standard claims defined in IETF RFC 7662 [13] with
the additional claims based on the VAL service.
# A.3 SIM-C registration
Before a SIM-C can obtain ID tokens and access tokens (required to access VAL
resource servers) it shall first be registered with the SIM-S of the service
provider as required by OpenID Connect 1.0. The method by which this is done
is not specified by this profile. For native SIM-C, the following information
shall be registered:
\- The client is issued a client identifier. The client identifier represents
the client\'s registration with the authorization server, and enables the
SIM-S to reference parameters associated with that client\'s registration when
being requested for an access token by the SIM-C.
\- Registration of the client\'s redirect URIs.
Other information about the SIM-C such as (for example): application name,
website, description, logo image, legal terms to be consented to, may
optionally be registered.
# A.4 Obtaining tokens
## A.4.1 General
Once a SIM-C has been successfully registered with the SIM-S of the VAL
service provider, the SIM-C may request ID tokens and access tokens (as
required to access VAL service servers). Only native SIM-C are defined here.
The exact method in which a SIM-C requests the access token depends upon the
client profile. The SIM-C profiles, along with steps required from them to
obtain OAuth access tokens, are explained below.
## A.4.2 Native SIM-C
### A.4.2.1 General
This conforms to the Native Application profile of OAuth 2.0 as per IETF RFC
6749 [3].
SIM-C fitting the Native application profile utilize the authorization code
grant type with the PKCE extension for enhanced security as shown in figure
A.4.2.1-1.

Figure A.4.2.1-1: Authorization Code flow
### A.4.2.2 Authentication request
As described in OpenID Connect 1.0, the SIM-C constructs a request URI by
adding the following parameters to the query component of the authorization
endpoint\'s URI using the \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" format,
redirecting the user\'s web browser to the authorization endpoint of the
SIM-S. The standard parameters shown in table A.4.2.2-1 are required by this
Connect profile. Other parameters defined by the OpenID Connect specification
are optional.
Table A.4.2.2-1: Authentication Request standard required parameters
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Parameter | Values | +==================================+==================================+ | response_type | REQUIRED. For native SIM-C the | | | value shall be set to \"code\". | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | client_id | REQUIRED.

### A.4.2.3 Authentication response
The authorization endpoint running on the SIM-S issues an authorization code
and delivers it to the SIM-C. The authorization code is used by the SIM-C to
obtain an ID token, access token and refresh token from the SIM-S. The
authorization code is added to the query component of the redirection URI
using the \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" format. The authorization code
standard parameters are shown in table A.4.2.3-1.
Table A.4.2.3-1: Authentication Response standard required parameters
Parameter Values
* * *
Code REQUIRED. The authorization code generated by the authorization endpoint
and returned to the SIM-C via the authorization response. State REQUIRED. The
value shall match the exact value used in the authorization request. If the
state does not match exactly, then the NGMI API client is under a Cross-site
request forgery attack and shall reject the authorization code by ignoring it
and shall not attempt to exchange it for an access token. No error is
returned.
### A.4.2.4 Access token request
In order to exchange the authorization code for an ID token, access token and
refresh token, the SIM-C makes a request to the authorization server\'s token
endpoint by sending the following parameters using the \"application/x-www-
form-urlencoded\" format, with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
request entity-body. Note that client authentication is REQUIRED for native
applications (using PKCE) in order to exchange the authorization code for an
access token. Assuming that client secrets are used, the client secret is sent
in the HTTP Authorization Header. The access token request standard parameters
are shown in table A.4.2.4-1.
Table A.4.2.4-1: Access token request standard required parameters
Parameter Values
* * *
grant_type REQUIRED. The value shall be set to \"authorization_code\". code
REQUIRED. The authorization code previously received from the SIM-S as a
result of the authorization request and subsequent successful authentication
of the VAL user. client_id REQUIRED. The identifier of the client making the
API request. It shall match the value that was previously registered with the
OAuth Provider during the client registration phase of deployment, or as
provisioned via a development portal. redirect_uri REQUIRED. The value shall
be identical to the \"redirect_uri\" parameter included in the authorization
request. code_verifier REQUIRED. A cryptographically random string that is
used to correlate the authorization request to the token request.
### A.4.2.5 Access token response
If the access token request is valid and authorized, the SIM-S returns an ID
token, access token and refresh token to the SIM-C in an access token response
message; otherwise it will return an error.
The access token response standard parameters are shown in table A.4.2.5-1.
Table A.4.2.5-1: Access token response standard parameters
Parameter Values
* * *
access_token REQUIRED. This is the issued access token. token_type REQUIRED.
This field shall be \"bearer\" expires_in REQUIRED. The lifetime in seconds of
the access token. Id_token OPTIONAL. This is the issued id token.
Refresh_token OPTIONAL. This is the issued refresh token.
The SIM-C may now validate the user with the ID token and configure itself for
the user (e.g. by extracting the VAL service ID from the ID Token). The SIM-C
then uses the access token to make authorized requests to the SIM resource
servers on behalf of the end user.
# A.5 Refreshing an access token
## A.5.1 General
To protect against leakage or other compromise, access token lifetimes are
typically short lived (though it is ultimately a matter of security policy &
configuration by the service provider). Some client types can be issued
longer-lived refresh tokens, which enable them to refresh the access token and
avoid having to prompt the user for authentication again when the access token
expires. Refresh tokens are available only to clients utilizing the
authorization code grant type. Figure A.5.1-1 shows how Native SIM-C can use
the refresh token as a grant type to obtain new access tokens.
{width="4.841666666666667in" height="1.7833333333333334in"}
Figure A.5.1-1: Requesting a new access token
## A.5.2 Access token request
To obtain an access token from the SIM-S using a refresh token, the SIM-C
makes an access token request to the token endpoint of the SIM-S. The SIM-C
does this by adding the following parameters using the \"application/x-www-
form-urlencoded\" format, with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
request entity-body. The access token request standard parameters are shown in
table A.5.2-1.
Table A.5.2-1: Access token request standard required parameters
**Parameter** **Values**
* * *
grant_type REQUIRED. The value shall be set to \"refresh_token\". Scope Space-
delimited set of permissions that the SIM-C requests. Note that the scopes
requested using this grant type shall be of equal to or lesser than scope of
the original scopes requested by the SIM-C as part of the original
authorization request.
If the SIM-C was provided with client credentials by the SIM-S, then the
client shall authenticate with the token endpoint of the SIM-S utilizing the
client credential (shared secret or public-private key pair) established
during the client registration phase.
## A.5.3 Access token response
In response to the access token request (above) the token endpoint on the
SIM-S will return an access token to the SIM-C, and optionally another refresh
token in an access token response message.
The access token response standard parameters are shown in table A.5.3-1.
Table A.5.3-1: Access token response standard parameters
**Parameter** **Values**
* * *
access_token REQUIRED. This is the issued access token. token_type REQUIRED.
This field shall be \"bearer\" expires_in REQUIRED. The lifetime in seconds of
the access token. Id_token OPTIONAL. This is the issued id token.
Refresh_token OPTIONAL. This is the issued refresh token.
It is possible to configure the SIM-S to confirm that the user account is
still valid each time the refresh token is presented, and to revoke the
refresh token if not. This security practice is RECOMMENDED.
# A.6 Using the token to access VAL resource servers
Connect for VAL shall initially support the bearer access token type. Access
tokens of type \"bearer\" shall be communicated from the VAL or SEAL Clients
in UE to VAL resource servers by including the access token in the HTTP
Authorization Header, per IETF RFC 6750 [4].
The access token is opaque to the VAL or SEAL Clients in UE, meaning that the
client does not have any knowledge of the access token itself. The client will
be given some metadata corresponding to the access token, such as its
expiration time, so that it does not send an expired access token to VAL
resource servers. If the access token is presented to a VAL resource server
and the scope is invalid or the token is expired or revoked, the VAL resource
server should return an error message indicating such to the VAL or SEAL
Clients in UE.
# A.7 Token validation
## A.7.1 ID token validation
The VAL or SEAL Clients in UE shall validate the ID token as per clause
3.1.3.7 of the OpenID Connect 1.0 specification [5].
## A.7.2 Access token validation
VAL resource servers shall validate access tokens received from the VAL or
SEAL Clients in UE according to IETF RFC 7797 [11].
# A.8 Token revocation
**In order to limit the time validity of a token, the \"exp\" and
\"expires_in\" parameters may be used as a method of access token revocation.
If either the \"exp\" or \"expires_in\" parameter is used as a method of
access token revocation, then the following applies:**
**Within the standard claims of an access token, the \"exp\" parameter shall
be used by the authorising server to determine whether or not the token is
valid. If the current time is beyond the time specified by the \"exp\"
parameter, the associated token shall no longer be considered valid and any
requests made with an expired token shall be rejected by the authorising
server.**
**Within the standard claims of an access token response, token exchange
response or token response message, the \"expires_in\" parameter shall be used
by the UE client(s) to determine validity of the associated token. If the
current time is beyond the time specified by the \"expires_in\" parameter, the
associated token shall no longer be considered valid and no client requests
shall be made using the expired token. A refresh token may be used per clause
A.5 to obtain a new access token.**
# A.9 SIM-S interface security
The support of Transport Layer Security (TLS) between the SIM-C in the VAL UE
and the SIM-S is mandatory. The profile for TLS implementation and usage shall
follow the provisions given in 3GPP TS 33.310 [6], annex E.
If PSK TLS based authentication is supported, the SIM-C in the VAL UE and the
SIM-S shall support the TLS version, PSK ciphersuites and TLS Extensions as
specified in the TLS profile given in 3GPP TS 33.310 [6], annex E. The usage
of pre-shared key ciphersuites for TLS is specified in the TLS profile given
in 3GPP TS 33.310 [6], annex E.
