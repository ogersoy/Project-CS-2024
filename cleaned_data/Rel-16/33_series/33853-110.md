# Introduction
User Plane integrity protection allows the network operator and the UE detect
that user plane data has been modified in transit between each other.
Recently, several potential attacks on the 3GPP AN interface and AN
infrastructure have come to light that can be mitigated by the use of
integrity protection on the User Plane over at least the radio interface. This
protection is currently available for a 5G AN with a 5G core but not for LTE
with EPC, LTE with a 5G Core, or for EN-DC. Integrity protection is currently
specified for the control plane to protect signalling messages but is only
currently specified for 5G user plane up to 64Kb per bearer.
Furthermore, supporting User Plane Integrity Protection (UP IP) at full data
rate for 5G NR with 5G Core has been identified as an issue in Rel-15 and thus
a UE capability-based negotiation was introduced in 5G system. Key issues and
Potential enhancements to support UP IP up to the full data rate need to be
studied while meeting the expected peak data throughput and lower latency as
the NR and LTE radio capabilities evolve.
5G and LTE can be implemented independently and together in a number of ways.
These are described in 3GPP TR 38.801 [2] (clause 7.2) and are summarised as:
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 2 - NR standalone with 5G Core
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 5 - 5G core with eUTRA
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
# 1 Scope
The present document studies the key issues and potential solutions for
integrity protecting the user plane, including potential enhancements needed
to support UP IP up to the full data rate, in the following combinations as
defined in 3GPP TR 38.801 [2] (clause 7.2):
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 2 - NR standalone with 5G Core
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
\- Option 4 - 5G Core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 5 - 5G Core with eUTRA
\- Option 7 - 5G Core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
The present document does not detail key issues, solutions, evaluations,
conclusions and recommendations for GERAN and UTRAN.

# 5 Key Issues
## 5.1 Key Issue 1: UP integrity activation in EPS
### 5.1.1 Issue description
In the 5G system, as specified in TS 33.501 [4], UP security activation is
separate from CP security activation and is based on a UP policy sent by the
core network. In EPS, as specified in TS 33.401 [3], UP and CP AS security are
activated simultaneously by the AS SMC.
For the introduction of UP integrity in EPS, it needs to be specified how UP
integrity is activated in a secure way.
### 5.1.2 Network options affected
This key issue is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
### 5.1.3 Threat description
If UP integrity activation is not secure, a man-in-the-middle could deceive
the UE into sending UP traffic unprotected that is supposed to be protected.
### 5.1.4 Potential security requirements
The system shall support secure activation of UP integrity in EPS.
## 5.2 Key Issue #2: Secure negotiation of integrity protection support in EPS
### 5.2.1 Issue description
Integrity protection for the user plane is not supported in EPS according to
TS 33.401 [3]. Neither it is possible to introduce it in a backward-compatible
way. Therefore, to introduce such feature, it needs tobe considered that
upgraded entities (network nodes or UEs) supporting the feature will coexist
and interact with legacy ones for a long period of time. It is then expected
that the network and the UE needs to be able to negotiate the support of such
feature to be able to activate it in the first place. If this feature is not
securely negotiated, a man-in-the-middle can deceive the network into not
activating the feature. In other terms, the feature would be vulnerable to
bidding-down attacks.
### 5.2.2 Network options affected
This key issue is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
### 5.2.3 Threat description
In case the negotiation of the user plane integrity protection feature is not
secure, a man-in-the-middle could deceive the network into not activating the
feature.
### 5.2.4 Potential security requirements
The system shall support a secure negotiation of the user plane integrity
protection feature while maintaining backward compatibility.
## 5.3 Key Issue 3: UE support of UP IP at the full uplink data rate
### 5.3.1 Issue description
NR (as well as the evolution of E-UTRA) is expected to support ever increasing
UE peak data rates (e.g., in the order of 10\'s of gbps) while at the same
time meeting ultra-low latency requirements for transmission of certain delay
sensitive packets, e.g., use cases such as autonomous driving, industrial
automation and virtual/augmented reality. For these use cases, it is important
that the User Plane Integrity Protection (UP IP) can be applied at UE for the
full data rate on the uplink.
In Rel-15, it was concluded that it was not possible to support UP IP at the
UE supported full data rate in all cases, thus, UE capability based
negotiation was introduced.
This key issue is to study solutions for supporting UP IP at the UE supported
full data rate on the uplink.
NOTE: Potential solutions to address this key issue may impact RAN protocol
stack. Therefore, the relevant RAN WGs needs to be consulted before concluding
on any solution that addresses this key issue.
### 5.3.2 Network options affected
If DRB IP is applied at the PDCP layer also for E-UTRA, this key issue is
applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 2 - NR standalone with 5G Core
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 5 - 5G core with eUTRA
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 5.3.3 Threat description
If UE is not able to support DRB IP at the full data rate on the UE uplink,
then it will not be possible to integrity protect all DRBs on the uplink while
also meeting the ultra-low latency expected by certain applications. This
would allow an attacker to exploit the lack of integrity protection on the
UE\'s uplink data transmission.
### 5.3.4 Potential security requirements
It shall be possible to apply DRB IP at the UE full data rate on the UE\'s
uplink.
## 5.4 Key Issue 4: Integrity protection capability imbalance in enodeB
connected to 5GC
### 5.4.1 Issue description
In TS 33.501 [4], NGEN-DC and NE-DC are defined as two possible MR-DC
scenarios. In these cases, eNB and gNB are used in dual connectivity.
Rel.15 solution in MR-DC scenarios in TS 33.501[4] specify that, depending on
the MR-DC scenario being used and the security policy at the time of PDU
session establishment, the PDU session may either be rejected, the integrity
protection in 5G Uu interface implicitly disabled, or the offload to SN is not
allowed. The following cases summarize this behaviour according to TS
33.501[4]:
1\. NGEN-DC scenario (CN=5GC, eNB=MN, gNB=SN)
a. If the UP security policy indicates UP integrity protection is
\"required\", then the MN (MeNB) rejects the PDU session because the MN being
an eNB does not support UP IP.
b. If the UP security policy indicates UP integrity protection is
\"preferred\", then the MN (MeNB) always deactivates UP IP. The SN (SgNB)
always deactivates the UP IP of any PDU session terminated at the SN. This is
because MN being an eNB does not support UP IP and thus is not able to
indicate to the SN (SgNB) regarding the use of UP IP.
c. If the UP security policy indicates UP integrity protection is \"not
needed\", then the MN and SN always activates DRBs disabling the UP IP.
2\. NE-DC scenario (CN=5GC, eNB=SN, gNB=MN)
a. If the UP security policy indicates UP integrity protection is
\"required\", then if the MN (MgNB) activates the UP IP for the PDU session,
then the MN (MgNB) does not offload any DRB of the PDU session to the SN
(SeNB). This is because the MN (MgNB) supports UP IP, but the SN being an eNB
does not support the UP IP.
b. If the UP security policy indicates UP integrity protection is
\"preferred\", and if the MN (MgNB) activates any of the PDU session DRBs with
UP IP, then the MN (MgNB) does not offload any DRB on this PDU session to the
SN (SeNB). This is because the SN being an eNB does not support UP IP.
c. If the UP security policy indicates UP integrity protection is
\"preferred\", and if the MN (MgNB) activates any of the PDU session DRBs
without UP IP, the MN may offload DRBs of this PDU session to the SN (SeNB).
In this case, the SN accepts the DRBs always disabling the UP IP. This is
because the SN being an eNB does not support UP IP.
d. If the UP security policy indicates UP integrity protection is \"not
needed\", then the MN and SN always activates DRBs disabling the UP IP
Therefore, Rel.15 MR-DC solution results in the situation where gNB and UE
does not use UP integrity protection in some scenarios even if they\'re
perfectly capable of supporting it on its own. This is due to the nature of
combining the functionality with 2 different generation system where the older
system (i.e. eNB) does not support UP integrity protection. In other words,
gNB is being forced to \"bid down\" to a lower capability due to the presence
of eNB.
### 5.4.2 Network options affected
This key issue is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 5.4.3 Threat description
In Rel.15 MR-DC solution, gNB is forced to not to use UP integrity protection
in some scenarios due to the combined use of eNB which does not support UP
integrity protection. This situation brings the gNB down to the same level of
vulnerability as in LTE although 5G system by itself is capable of UP
integrity protection.
### 5.4.4 Potential security requirements
TBD
## 5.5 Key Issue 5: Optionality of integrity protection in UP DRB with 5GC
### 5.5.1 Issue description
In Rel. 15, security architecture for 5G in TS 33.501 [4] specifies the use of
UP IP. This is an improvement over LTE in light of the attack mentioned above
([5]). As specified in TS 23.501 [12], whether or not to use, UP IP in 5G
system is controlled, on a PDN basis, by the (home) SMF based on parameters
received from the UDM in the HPLMN. This HPLMN control is available even with
Local BreakOut in the VPLMN. The capabilities of the VPLMN and the capability
of the UE (as some UEs has a limitation in terms of the data rate it can
support the UP IP in DRB limited to \"64Kbps\" in Rel.15 specification) then
determine whether the PDN is established or not. This indicates that the
**inadequate support of UP IP will continue to persist** as long as Rel.15 UEs
with limited UP IP support exist, irrespective of new UE appearing to make it
a \"non-issue\". However, with 5GS, the HPLMN remains in control of UPIP in a
manner that is different to the HPLMN\'s influence over the VPLMN\'s
encryption policy.
The use of UP IP is home network operator-dependent policy, thus optional for
the network to enable for a PDU session. If the home network operator sets the
policy to disable the UP IP for some reason (service-dependent policy, e.g.
online Gaming, etc.), then the attack (ALTER attack) discussed in [5] is
possible.
When encryption is used with no integrity protection, the attacker still could
modify the UP packet. In the aLTEr attack mentioned in [5], an active attack
called \"user data redirection\" is proposed. The attacker can modify the
content of a packet if he knows the original plain text, even the packet is
encrypted. In the case of DNS packets, the attacker can easily guess or find
out the destination address of the original DNS server so the attacker can add
a specific offset to redirect to a DNS server under the adversary\'s control.
This is possible because the data is encrypted in a stream cipher mode, where
the encryption algorithm is used as a keystream generator, and the ciphertext
is computed by XORing the keystream with the plaintext.
As a result, UEs will continue to be vulnerable to potential attack exploiting
the same vulnerability with LTE as discussed in [5] and also for the services
where the home network operator sets the policy to disable the UP IP. In other
words, as long as optionality of the UP IP exists in the system, the attack
such as [5] continues to be relevant in 5G system as well, but only if the
HPLMN chooses to allow this vulnerability.
### 5.5.2 Network options affected
This key issue is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 2 - NR standalone with 5G Core
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 5 - 5G core with eUTRA
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 5.5.3 Threat description
Inadequate support of UP IP will continue to persist as long as the
optionality of the UP IP exists in the system. UEs not supporting UP IP at
full data rate or no support of UP IP for a particular PDU session, will
continue to be vulnerable to potential attacks exploiting the same
vulnerability as described in [5]. In other words, as long as the optionality
of the UP IP exists in the system, the attack such as [5] continues to be
relevant in both 5GS and EPS.
### 5.5.4 Potential security requirements
The 5G system should support solution(s) to mitigate the threat mentioned in
clause 5.5.3, when the integrity protection of a PDU session is not activated
due to UE capability limitations or home network policy.
## 5.6 Key Issue 6: UE connected to 5GC indicating support of UP IP over eUTRA
### 5.6.1 Issue description
According to TS 33.501 [4] Rel-15, an NR UE and a gNB connected to 5GC, are
mandated to support UP IP in NR PDCP. The use of UP IP between the UE and the
gNB when connected to a 5GC is optional though. The enforcement whether to use
UP IP or not, is determined by the 5G Core Network.
The eUTRA UE needs to be able to indicate to the 5GC whether it supports UP IP
over eUTRA. Solutions to this key issue should specify how to do this.
### 5.6.2 Network options affected
This key issue is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 5 - 5G core with eUTRA
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 5.6.3 Threat description
If the network is not informed whether the UE connected to the 5GC supports UP
IP over eUTRA , it may not be possible to use UP IP in this case, i.e.
sensitive user plane traffic may not be integrity protected.
### 5.6.4 Potential security requirements
The 5G system shall support a mechanism for the UE connected to 5GC to
indicate support of UP IP over eUTRA.
5.7 Key Issue 7: Ensuring UP IP is enforced at interworking
5.7.1 Issue description
At interworking from 5G to 4G, there is a security issue if the 5G network
moves data bearers that require integrity protection to a base station
connected to EPC that cannot support integrity protection. This issue is
currently prevented from happening by the following requirement in clause
5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [12]:
\- In the case of mobility with N26 to EPS, the source NG-RAN ensures that a
PDU Session with UP integrity protection of the User Plane Security
Enforcement information set to Required is not handed over to EPS.
In UEs mobility from 5G to 4G, it is necessary to ensure that UP IP will be
applied to bearers that required UP IP in 5G when UP IP is supported at the
target RAN node and such bearers are moved to EPS. Similarly it needs to be
ensured that such bearers are integrity protected on the return to the 5G
network.
5.7.2 Network options affected
This key issue is applicable to the following network options:
> \- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
>
> \- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
5.7.3 Threat description
User plane traffic that requires integrity protection may be sent without
integrity protection.
5.7.4 Potential security requirements
The interworking between EPS and 5GS shall ensure that integrity protection is
applied to user bearers that require integrity protection.
## 5.8 Key Issue 8: HPLMN Control of UP IP usage in EPC5.X.1 Issue description
### 5.8.1
Addition of UPIP to EPC is an improvement over LTE in light of the attack
mentioned above ([5]).
When encryption is used with no integrity protection, the attacker still could
modify the UP packet. In the aLTEr attack mentioned in [5], an active attack
called \"user data redirection\" is proposed. The attacker can modify the
content of a packet if he knows the original plain text, even the packet is
encrypted. In the case of DNS packets, the attacker can easily guess or find
out the destination address of the original DNS server so the attacker can add
a specific offset to redirect to a DNS server under the adversary\'s control.
This is possible because the data is encrypted in a stream cipher mode, where
the encryption algorithm is used as a keystream generator, and the ciphertext
is computed by XORing the keystream with the plaintext.
Mechanisms (e.g. similar to those in 5GS) to allow the HPLMN to enforce the
use of UPIP need to be investigated.
### 5.8.2 Network options affected
This key issue is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 3
### 5.8.3 Threat description
If the HPLMN cannot enforce the use of UPIP, then they cannot guarantee
protection for their subscribers against the threat mentioned in [5].
### 5.8.4 Potential security requirements
The EPS should support solution(s) to mitigate the threat mentioned in clause
5.8.3.

# 6 Potential Solutions
## 6.1 Solution #1: Dedicated PDU for UP Signalling message IP
### 6.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #5 (Optionality of integrity protection in
UP DRB). This solution covers the integrity protection of the UP signalling
messages, when the integrity protection of a PDU session is not activated due
to UE capability limitations or serving network policy, using a dedicated
integrity protection enabled PDU session.
There is impact to the UE and the AMF, to establish a dedicated integrity
protection enabled PDU session.
### 6.1.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 2 - NR standalone with 5G Core
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
### 6.1.3 Solution Description
The network configures a special DNN for exchange of secure user plane
signalling messages. The UE initiates an PDU session establishment procedure
to establish a separate PDU session exclusively for the user plane signalling
messages and the network enables integrity protection for the PDU session. The
user plane signalling messages means, for example DNS message exchanges over
the UP, which requires integrity protection. Even though, the integrity
protection of a PDU session is not activated due to UE capability limitations
or serving network policy for a PDU session, protection of sensitive protocol
message (for example, DNS exchanges) can be achieved using the dedicated PDU
sessions which serves low data rate signalling exchanges, as shown in Figure
6.1.3-1.
The UE identifies/decides to send particular IP packet (UP signalling
messages) over the established PDU session, based on at least one of the
following Traffic Filtering information:
\- application layer protocol (for example: DNS).
\- Transport layer port numbers.
\- Destination IP address and/or source IP address.
Figure 6.1.3-1: Dedicated PDU for UP Signalling message IP
### 6.1.4 Solution evaluation
This solution enables the integrity protection of the UP signalling messages,
when the integrity protection of a PDU session is not activated due to UE
capability limitations, using a dedicated integrity protection enabled PDU
session. With the solution the key issue #5 (Optionality of integrity
protection in UP DRB) is addressed.
The impact to the UE and the AMF is to have a new DNN configuration and it can
be done as part of URSP procedure or other mechanisms, for the establishment
of a dedicated integrity protection enabled PDU session, to protect the
sensitive message exchanges (for example, DNS exchanges).
This solution is applicable for resource constraint Rel-15 and Rel-16 UEs,
which can support integrity protection of sensitive application layer
signalling messages (like DNS messages) only and does not support integrity
protection of other non-signalling UP traffic.
NOTE: This solution assumes that all sensitive application layer signalling
traffic are confined to 64kbps.
## 6.2 Solution #2: Integrity protection between SgNB and UE in NGEN-DC
### 6.2.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #4.
In NGEN-DC scenario, in which the CN is 5GC, MN is eNB, and SN is gNB. When
the UP security policy indicates UP integrity protection is \"preferred\",
then the MN (MeNB) always deactivates UP IP. The SN (SgNB) always deactivates
the UP IP of any PDU session terminated at the SN. This lead to the result
that even though the UP policy is set to preferred, the PDU session is still
not integrity protected between SgNB and the UE.
However, this issue can be solved through implementation way. This above issue
happens in the split PDU session scenario, where some of the DRB(s) is
terminated at the MN and some DRB(s) is terminated at the SN, the MN ensures
that all DRBs which belong to the same PDU session have the same UP integrity
protection and ciphering activation. If the network needs to protect the DRB
terminated at the SgNB, it can choose to not split the PDU session.
### 6.2.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 6.2.3 Solution description
According to TS37.340 and TS38.413, The 5GC provides two UL TEID addresses
during PDU Session Resource Setup, to be applied as the first UL tunnel on the
NG-U interface and the additional NG-U tunnel in case the MN decides to split
the PDU session. In this message, the _Security Indication_ IE is included in
the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, and the _Integrity Protection Indication_ IE
or _Confidentiality Protection Indication_ IE is set to \"required\", then the
NG-RAN node performs user plane integrity protection or ciphering,
respectively, for the concerned PDU session. If the NG-RAN node cannot perform
the user plane integrity protection or ciphering, it rejects the setup of the
PDU session resources with an appropriate cause value.
Before MN decides to split the session or not, it already knows whether this
PDU session needs integrity protection or not. If MN prioritize the security,
it makes decision based on the _Security Indication_ IE as following:
\- If the _Security Indication_ IE is set to \"required\", MN never decides to
split the PUD session, but load all the DRB to SgNB to achieve the integrity.
\- If the _Security Indication_ IE is set to \"preferred\", and security has
higher priority in this MN, then MN never decides to split the PDU session,
but load all the DRB to SgNB to achieve the integrity.
\- If the _Security Indication_ IE is set to \"preferred\", and security has
lower priority in this MN, then MN may still decide to split the PUD session.
\- If the _Security Indication_ IE is set to \"not needed\", MN may decide to
split the PUD session.

## 6.3 Solution #3: Improved MR-DC bearer handling
### 6.3.1 Introduction
This solution addresses KI #4, Integrity protection capability imbalance in
enodeB connected to 5GC.
This solution introduces enhancement to the bearer establishment and offload
behaviour in Rel.15 in MR-DC scenarios. Scenarios where Rel.15 behaviour
dictates suboptimal handling are addressed in such a way that the UP IP is
activated whenever possible.
This solution affects the bearer establishment and offload decision in MN.
### 6.3.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 6.3.3 Solution Description
In Rel-15 MR-DC handling of UP IP, there are certain constraints exist.
Specifically:
1\. In NGEN-DC scenario and UP security policy is \"required\", then the MN
(eNB) rejects bearer establishment.
2\. In NGEN-DC scenario and UP security policy is \"preferred\", then the MN
(eNB) establishes bearer without UP IP.
3\. In NE-DC scenario and UP security policy is \"preferred\", then the MN
(gNB) activates the bearer with or without UP IP. When UP IP is activated,
then the MN does not offload bearer to the SN (eNB).
In all of the above scenarios, it is possible to introduce improvements to:
i) accept bearer establishment instead of rejecting it (case 1);
ii) select whether to activate UP IP or not (case 2, 3).
The improvement is described in Table 6.3.3-1 below. In all of these cases,
these improvements alleviate the existing constraints in Rel.15 and introduces
more cases where UP IP is activated in the bearer, enhancing the overall
security of the user plane.

### 6.3.4 Solution evaluation
Editor\'s Note: TBD.
## 6.4 Solution #4: Zero-overhead user plane integrity protection on the link
layer
### 6.4.1 Introduction
Existing attacks on UP-IP require a man-in-the-middle (MitM) relay that is
located between UE and eNB. The MitM relay receives packets from the UE/eNB,
modifies them, and forwards them towards eNB/UE. Thus, techniques that defeat
MitM relay attacks defeat also attacks on UP-IP. The \"Zero-overhead user
plane integrity protection on the link layer\" solution does this -- it
defeats MitM relay attacks -- by replacing the CRC associated to each
transport block in L2 by a cryptographic CRC denoted CRC\' and linked to the
transport block **_identity_** itself. By doing this, an attacker cannot
receive a packet, process and modify it, and forward it in a later transport
block since this changes the transport block _identity_ used, and thus, the
verification of the cryptographic CRC fails.
This solution addresses the key issue #3: \"UE support of UP IP at the full
uplink data rate\" and key issue #5: \"Optionality of integrity protection in
UP DRB\".
Key issue #3 is addressed since it provides protection against attacks on UP
IP even at full uplink data rate. Key issue #5 is addressed since this
protection is applied to all UP DRBs.
The proposal is to use a cryptographic CRC instead of the regular CRC in
Transport Blocks on the user plane.
This solution reduces the overhead of integrity protection to ZERO.
The effective user data throughput remains the same as without the integrity
protection.
The error behaviour of the Link layer remains exactly the same as without the
proposed integrity protection.
This solution requires the addition of the computation of a MAC over or the
encryption of 128 bits per CRC in a Transport Block so per 6144 bits, which is
a reduction of about a factor 50 in the amount of computations required for
the UP IP of a PDCP packet. It can therefore be used at full uplink data rates
and is a solution to key issue 3.
With this solution, all Transport Blocks independent of the data rate can be
integrity protected, so automatically, all PDCP packets become integrity
protected and the integrity protection does not have to be a serving network
operator-dependent policy anymore, which solves the UP IP optionality KI#5.
**Some background**
\- A Transport Block is defined as the basic data unit exchanged between L1
and MAC. An equivalent term for Transport Block is \"MAC PDU\".
\- Each Transport Block has a CRC over the total TB. Most TBs, including User
Data TBs, have a 24-bit CRC.
\- Transport Blocks are subdivided in Code Blocks if larger than 6144 bit.
Each CB has its own 24-bit CRC.
\- A Resource Block pair is the unit for the scheduling of resources by the
base station.
\- One Resource Block consists of 12 successive OFDM sub-carriers in frequency
and one slot of 0.5 millisecond in time
72 or 84 OFDM symbols per RB of 1 to 10-bit each.
\- A Resource Block pair consists of the two successive RBs in the two
successive slots of a subframe of 1 millisecond.
\- If a Transport Block is larger than a Resource Block pair, more RB pairs
are added in the frequency direction.
 Each TB is limited to a subframe of 1 millisecond.
\- TBs with an incorrect CRC are discarded by the receiver and a
retransmission is requested (Hybrid Automatic Repeat-Request (HARQ)).
\- An LTE frame consists of 10 subframes.

### 6.4.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 2 - NR standalone with 5G Core
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 6.4.3 Solution description
It is proposed to use a cryptographic version of the CRC in every user
Transport Block.
This can be achieved by replacing the 24-bit CRCs in a Transport block by
24-bit CRC\'s as computed by
CRC\' = truncate { 24, HMAC( K, CRC \| TransportBlockID) } (1)
or
CRC\' = truncate { 24, Encrypt( K, CRC \| TransportBlockID) } (2)
In addition, the CRCs of the Code Blocks inside a TB may also be replaced by
their cryptographic versions.
Encryption requires probably less effort than HMAC. The encryption is done in
ECB mode. A truncated encryption is OK, the truncated encryption serves as a
CRC. Both sender and transmitter compute the CRC\' using truncated encryption
of equation (2). The transmitter puts the computed CRC\' at the CRC field of
the TB. The receiver computes it too according to equation (2) and compares
this with the CRC\' value in the CRC field of the received TB. If they are the
same, the integrity protection check passes, else it fails. Therefore, because
there is no decryption required, only checking whether truncated encryptions
are the same or not.
Mobility problem (different key per gNB)
The key K to use is derived from a master key such that the derivation is
dependent on the gNB or the DU inside the gNB. The master key is different for
each UE (or UICC/USIM), but is used only for the UPIP functionality in this
solution. gNBs or DUs get provisioned with the key K derived for them. The UE
(or UICC/USIM) is provisioned with the master key and does the derivation of
the key K itself.
Rekeying of the master key
The master key needs to be rekeyed before the time dependent part of
TransportBlockID rolls over. An HSFN + 11 extra bits leads to a roll-over
every 1.4 year.
Bundling of PDCP-PDUs
The master key and the key K are not dependent on the content of a TB, i.e.
the PDCP-PDUs that are carried inside that TB.
Dual connectivity (split bearer) situation
In case of dual connectivity (split bearer), TBs that are sent over a bearer
that does support this solution are integrity protected, while TBs that are
sent over a bearer that does not support this solution are not protected.
The TransportBlockID is used to prevent an attacker to collect entries for a
CRC -> CRC\' dictionary.
Requirements for the TransportBlockID are the following two.
1\. TransportBlockID should be different for different slots or subframes.
2\. TransportBlockID should be different for TBs of the same user in the same
slot or subframe.
Candidates for requirement 1 that are simple to retrieve by both UE and eNodeB
may be:
\- the subframe number (0 - 9) that the TB starts in;
\- the System Frame Number (SFN) (0 - 1023) that the TB starts in (repeats
every 10.24 seconds);
\- the hyper-SFN (HSFN) (0 - 1023) that the TB starts in (repeats about every
3hours; the HSF is also used as part of the COUNT in the PDCP integrity
protection);
\- a new sequence number similar to the hyper-SFN (HSFN) and made available in
a system message to all devices in a cell similar to the way the HSFN or the
SFN is made known (HSFN + 11 extra bits leads to a roll-over every 1.4 year);
\- a new sequence number made available through an AS secured RRC message;
\- a Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI), either existing or new one,
only known to the UE and the gNB, that gets updated frequently;
\- the length of the TB;
\- the slot number (0 or 1) of the slot the TB starts in (?);
\- etc.
Candidates for requirement 2 that are simple to retrieve by both UE and eNodeB
may be:
\- indication of uplink or downlink bit;
\- indication whether the CRC/CRC\' is for the entire TB or for a Code Block
(sub part of TB with its own CRC);
\- CB number in case the CRC/CRC\' is for a CB;
\- indication whether the TB is the first (0) or second (1) TB to/from a
device in this subframe;
\- lowest (or highest) frequency of all sub carriers used for the entire TB;
\- number of subcarriers and/or Resource Blocks used for the entire TB;
\- number of the spatial stream or the antenna port number in case of spatial
multiplexing;
\- carrier indicator indicating the carrier this TB is transferred on in case
of carrier aggregation;
\- PLMN ID, or Cell Identity;
\- Evolved Cell Global Identifier = PLMN ID concatenated with the Cell
Identity;
\- physical layer cell identity (0 - 503);
\- base station name (eNodeB name) as transmitted in the System Information
Block 9 (SIB9);
\- etc.
Control of the Transport Block level integrity protection provided by this
solution.
When the system wants to use the UP-IP at the Transport Block level of this
solution between a certain UE and gNB, it starts a PDCP entity just for this
purpose, while using one integrity algorithm identifier of a set of new
integrity algorithm identifiers in the integrityProtAlgorithm attribute in the
SecurityAlgorithmConfig information element (clause 6.3.3 of TS 36.331 [9]),
see \"Negotiation of UP-IP\" below. Any of the existing ciphering algorithm
identifiers can be used for the cipheringAlgorithm attribute.
This PDCP entity, as any other PDCP entity, may be used for the transfer of IP
packets. All of these packets are integrity protected at the Transport Block
level.
When the system wants to use different bearers, with different policies and
QoS, etc., it can do so as it was used to. But when the system starts a PDCP
entity with one of the new nia4, nia5, nia6, nia7 integrity algorithm
identifiers, all Transport Blocks to and from the UE are going to use the
cryptographic CRC. This does not influence the data rates/QoS of the other
PDCP entities. In case another PDCP entity did not use PDCP UP-IP protection,
it has now UP-IP based on the cryptographic CRC. In case it already had PDCP
UP-IP, it now also has UP-IP based on the cryptographic CRC at the TB level.
If performing cryptographic CRC is not desired for all user plane data (even
though this is identified as possibly problematic in KI#5), then the security
policy per PDU session may be extended to include a flag which indicates
whether to apply cryptographic CRC or not. A UE that supports multiple MAC
entities (as described in TS 38.321), which the UE may already have in order
to support e.g. multi-RAT connections or dual connectivity, can use one MAC
entity to serve all PDU sessions with integrity protection switched on, and
another MAC entity to serve all PDU sessions with integrity protection
switched off. If a UE that does not support multiple MAC entities wants to
establish an additional PDU session, and the additional PDU session has a
different value for cryptographic CRC in the security policy as the already
established PDU session(s), then the UE may choose to wait or cancel the
additional PDU session until the existing PDU session is torn down and the MAC
entity becomes available, and may inform the user that the additional PDU
session cannot be established due to device limitations. Alternatively, the
AMF can be made aware of such device limitation and update the security policy
such that the UE will change to using PDCP based integrity protection instead
of using cryptographic CRC, possibly at a lower data rate, due to overhead
that this may bring.
Negotiation of UP-IP
The application of this solution can be negotiated and controlled with the
same procedures as those for the PDCP integrity protection with the following
extensions for NR. Similar extensions may be made for E-UTRA.
\- The F1-C interface is extended with one or more new messages to supply the
DU with the required information for the integrity protection of this
solution.
\- The list of integrity algorithm identifiers in clause 5.11.1.2 of [4] is
extended with one or more of the following values:
\- \"0100~2~\" 128-NIA4 128-bit SNOW 3G based algorithm using equation (2)
above in ECB mode;
\- \"0101~2~\" 128-NIA5 128-bit AES based algorithm using equation (2) above
in ECB mode;
\- \"0110~2~\" 128-NIA6 128-bit ZUC based algorithm using equation (2) above
in ECB mode; and/or
\- \"0111~2~\" 256-NIA7 HMAC-SHA256 based algorithm using equation (1) above.
\- The list of integrity algorithm identifiers in the integrityProtAlgorithm
attribute in the SecurityAlgorithmConfig information element (clause 6.3.3 of
TS 36.331 [9]) is extended with the same new value(s) as the ones in the
previous bullet.
\- The _integrityProtAlgorithm_ enumeration in the IE
_SecurityAlgorithmConfig_ in clause 6.3.2 of [8] is extended with nia4, nia5,
nia6, and/or nia7, consistent with the extension of the list of integrity
algorithm identifiers as described the bullet above.
Consequence of UP-IP termination in the DU
Since the negotiation of the application of this solution is done in the PDCP
layer, but the application itself in the DU, the F1-C interface is extended
with one or more new messages to supply the DU with the required information
for the integrity protection of this solution.
This solution provides integrity protection between the UE and the DU. The
integrity protection can be extended to the CU, by applying IPsec on the F1-U
interface, as specified in clause 9.8.2 of [4].
Since the key K is part of the information to be sent on the F1-C interface to
the DU, the security mechanisms as specified in clause 9.8.2 of [4] for the
F1-C interface need to be applied as well.
The contents of a TB with an incorrect cryptographic CRC is blocked by the DU
from further transmission to the CU.
Key hierarchy and key management
The key K in equation (1) or (2) above can be taken as the key K~UPint~ as
specified in [4].
However, this would mean that PDCP UP-IP and the integrity protection of this
solution cannot be used at the same time. Therefore, a new key K~TBint~ may be
defined in [4] that is managed and derived in the same way as K~UPint~ except
that a value of 0x07 is used for the algorithm type distinguisher in clause
A.8 of [4] instead of 0x06.
### 6.4.4 Solution Evaluation
The impact on the protocol stack (PHY + MAC + RRC)
The PHY in the UE and in the DU needs to be extended with means to generate
the CRC\' in outgoing Transport Blocks and means to check the CRC\' of
incoming Transport Blocks according to equations (1) and/or (2) above. This
means that for every CRC computed, an additional HMAC needs tobe computed if
equation (1) is used or one encrypted value needs to be computed if equation
(2) is used.
Since the cryptographic CRC computation is based on the (linear) CRC itself,
XOR-ing a TB that is protected with the cryptographic CRC with a TB with a
zero-valued CRC will lead to a TB that passes the integrity check.
The PHY in the UE needs to be extended with means to receive the information
required to apply and cease to apply the integrity protection of this solution
from the RRC layer in the UE.
The PHY in the DU and the RRC in the CU need to be extended with means to
exchange the information required to apply and cease to apply the integrity
protection of this solution using one or more new messages over the F1-C
interface. Since the key K is part of this information, the security
mechanisms as specified in clause 9.8.2 of [4] for the F1-C interface need to
be applied.
The RRC in the UE and CU need to be extended with the new integrity algorithm
identifier(s) specified for this solution.
There is no change required in the MAC, but it may be desirable for a UE to
support multiple MAC entities..
The integrity protection strength of this solution is less than that of the
PDCP MAC, namely 24 bit instead of 32 bit.
The security properties of using the cryptographic CRC as an integrity
protection have not been evaluated.
This solution addresses the key issue #3: \"UE support of UP IP at the full
uplink data rate\" and key issue #5: \"Optionality of integrity protection in
UP DRB\".
The proposal is to use a cryptographic CRC instead of the regular CRC in
Transport Blocks on the user plane.
This solution reduces the overhead of integrity protection to ZERO.
The effective user data throughput remains the same as without the integrity
protection.
The error behaviour of the Link layer remains exactly the same as without the
proposed integrity protection.
This solution requires the addition of the computation of a MAC over or the
encryption of 128 bits per CRC in a Transport Block so per 6.144 bits, which
is a reduction of about a factor 50 in the amount of computations required for
the UP IP of a PDCP packet. It can therefore be used at full uplink data rates
and is a solution to key issue 3.
With this solution, all Transport Blocks independent of the data rate can be
integrity protected, so automatically, all PDCP packets become integrity
protected and the integrity protection does not have to be a serving network
operator-dependent policy anymore, which solves the UP IP optionality KI#5.
## 6.5 Solution #5: Integrity Protection of packet header in the User Plane
### 6.5.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #5 (Optionality of integrity protection in
UP DRB). The solution only protects the integrity of the packet header when
data rate is over 64 kbit/s.
### 6.5.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 2 - NR standalone with 5G Core
### 6.5.3 Solution Description
The protocol stack of the user plane in 5G network differs from the protocol
stack of the user plane in 4G network in that a Service Data Adaptation
Protocol (SDAP) is added as shown in the Figure 6.5.3-1. The role of SDAP [2]
is to map the QoS flow to the Data Radio Bearer (DRB) and mark the QoS flow
identifier (ID) in the SDAP header. It provides a finer-grained management of
QoS than 4G with respect to the user plane data.
Figure 6.5.3-1: Protocol stack
After the user plane packet is encapsulated, the PDCP layer packet format is
as follows:
Figure 6.5.3-2: Packet format in the PDCP layer
Where H~PDCP~ is the header of PDCP layer, H~SDAP~ is the header of the SDAP
layer, and H~data~ is the header of the packet. The PDCP sequence number (PDCP
SN) in the H~PDCP~ is part of the packet count value COUNT. To protect the
header of the packet, the following parameters are input to the integrity
function (e.g. NIA1) to produce MAC-I.
\- COUNT，
\- MESSAGE
\- DIRECTION
\- BEARER
\- KEY
Where MESSAGE is to be integrity protected, which is the cascade of the
H~SDAP~ and H~data~.
### 6.5.4 Solution Evaluation
The proposed scheme can be evaluated in context of security, efficiency, and
compatibility as follows:
**\- Security**
The proposed scheme addresses key issue #5 (Optionality of integrity
protection in UP DRB) by integrity protecting the header part of the PDCP
data. Besides the packet header of UP IP signalling messages (DNS query
packets), the subsequent IP header of the data are integrity protected.
Moreover, the packet headers for some applications that does not have DNS
query procedure are also integrity protected. As a result, the attacks that
wants to route the packets to a wrong destination by modifying the packet
header can be prevented. However, this solution does not protect the whole
packet, thus the modification on the payload part could not be mitigated.
**\- Efficiency**
\- This solution provides a means to integrity protect IP header part of the
PDCP data payload. The proposed scheme is more efficiency than the scheme
specified in TS 33.501. This is because only the packet header is integrity
protected, while the whole packet is integrity protected in TS 33.501.
However, the PDCP layer needs to look inside the PDCP payload to determine the
payload type (e.g., non-IP, IPv4 or IPv6) and this adds additional overhead.
**\- Compatibility**
\- This solution faces difficulty to implement as PDCP layer could not
identify the type of upper layer data. It could neither recognize whether the
data is IP packet or non-IP packet, nor whether IP packet is IPv4 packet or
IPv6 packet. That means it is hard to define which part of PDCP head should be
integrity protected.

## 6.6 Solution #6: Addition of UP IP for eUTRA with 5GC
### 6.6.1 Introduction
To protect user plane communication reliably in Options 4, 5 and 7 and to
maintain compatibility with NR, this solution describes the addition of User
Plane integrity protection to eUTRA in a similar way to the 5G implementation.
### 6.6.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 5 - 5G core with eUTRA
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 6.6.3 Solution Description
The clauses regarding user plane integrity protection for eUTRA are added as
detailed for NR in 3GPP TS 33.501[4].

Editor\'s Note: to be added
## 6.7 Solution #7: UE connected to 5GC indicating support of UP IP over eUTRA
### 6.7.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #6 (UE connected to 5GC indicating support
of UP IP over eUTRA). This solution describes how the UE provides its
capability to the network to indicate that it supports UP IP over eUTRA when
connected to 5GC.
According to TS 33.501 [4], UP IP is mandatory to be supported for the gNB and
the UE., The UE indicates its capability for maximum data bitrate for UP IP
over NR to the 5G network in NAS layer. Its FFS whether this capability
applies to eUTRA supporting UP IP as well or whether a new capability is
required for eUTRA.
As UP IP in a ng-eNB connected to 5GC is currently not specified in TS 33.501
[4], this implies that even if a Rel-15 UE would have supported UP IP over
eUTRA, there was no possibility for a Rel-15 UE to test UP IP over eUTRA in
any live 5G Rel-15 network, therefore its envisioned that a Rel-15 UE has not
enabled UP IP over eUTRA (connected to a 5GC). A capability indication is
required for a Rel-16 UE which supports UP IP over eUTRA (connected to a 5GC)
in order for a Rel-16 network to be able to distinguish between a Rel-15 UE
which cannot enable UP IP over eUTRA and a Rel-16 UE which can enable UP IP
over eUTRA.
This solution assumes that the UE has been upgraded to support UP IP over
eUTRA connected to 5GC. It also assumes that the ng-eNB supports UP IP and
supports the capability of enabling UP IP with the UE over eUTRA.
There is impact on UE, SMF, AMF and ng-eNB/gNB.
### 6.7.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 5 - 5G core with eUTRA
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 6.7.3 Solution Description
#### 6.7.3.1 Signalling flows
##### 6.7.3.1.1 PDU Session Establishment Request procedure in 5G system
The UE initiates the PDU Session establishment procedure with the SMF, via the
AMF, to establish data bearers with the network. If the UE supports UP IP over
eUTRA when connected to a 5GC, then the UE includes its capability to support
UP IP over eUTRA in the PDU Session Establishment Request message to the SMF.

``` 1\. The SMF initiates the N2 PDU Session Request procedure with ng-eNB/gNB
and includes the UE capability to support UP IP over ng-eNB when connected to
5GC. The SMF also includes the UP security policy.
  1. The ng-eNB/gNB initiates RRC Reconfiguration procedure with the UE and indicates to the UE to activate UP integrity protection for the DRBs (data radio bearers) established with the ng-eNB/gNB.
#### 6.7.3.1.2 Dual Connectivity
If a ng-eNB acting as a MN receives the UE capability from the 5GC indicating
that the UE supports UP integrity protection over eUTRA, then the MN takes
that capability into consideration together with the UP security policy, when
it makes the decision whether to activate UP integrity protection for its own
DRB\'s established with the UE.
For the scenario when \'no split PDU session\' takes place, the handling of
the UP security policy should be the same as for as described in clause
6.10.2.1 in TS 33.501 [4].
In the scenario of \'no split PDU session\' when MN offloads DRB(s) for a PDU
session to a ng-eNB acting as a SN, there are two options to consider as
described below.
ALTERNATIVE 1:
The MN determines from the UP security policy and the UE capability indicating
that the UE supports UP integrity protection over eUTRA, both received from
the 5G Core Network, and also the capability of the SN i.e. whether it
supports UP IP or not, before the MN decides to offload any DRB(s) of the PDU
Session to the SN which requires UP integrity protection.
ALTERNATIVE 2:
The MN forwards the UE capability indicating that the UE supports UP integrity
protection over eUTRA and the UP security policy, both received from the 5G
Core Network, to the ng-eNB acting as a SN. The SN will make the decision of
activating UP integrity protection or not for the PDU sessions that are
terminated at the SN.
In the scenario of \'split PDU session\' when MN offloads some of the DRB(s)
for a PDU session to a ng-eNB acting as a SN, the handling of the UP security
policy should be the same as for NR-DC as described in clause 6.10.4 in TS
33.501 [4].
### 6.7.4 Solution evaluation
The solution fulfils the requirement in key issue #6 (UE connected to 5GC
indicating support of UP IP over eUTRA).
The impact of the solution is to require the UE to indicate its support of UP
IP over eUTRA when connected to 5GC, to the ng-eNB/gNB via NAS layer. There is
impact on UE, SMF, AMF and ng-eNB/gNB.
According to TS 33.501 [4], the UE indicates its capability for maximum data
bitrate for UP IP over NR to the 5G network in NAS layer. Its FFS whether this
capability applies to eUTRA supporting UP IP as well or whether a new
capability is required for eUTRA. This is for other groups as CT1 and RAN2 to
decide.
As UP IP in a ng-eNB connected to 5GC was not enabled in Rel-15, this implies
that even if a Rel-15 UE would have supported UP IP over eUTRA, there was no
possibility for a Rel-15 UE to test UP IP over eUTRA in any live 5G Rel-15
network, therefore its envisioned that a Rel-15 UE has not enabled UP IP over
eUTRA connected to a 5GC. A capability indication is required for a Rel-16 UE
which supports UP IP over eUTRA connected to a 5GC, in order for a Rel-16
eUTRA to be able to distinguish between a Rel-15 UE which cannot enable UP IP
over eUTRA and a Rel-16 UE which can enable UP IP over eUTRA. This is for
other groups as CT1 to decide.
For the scenario when \'no split PDU session\' takes place, the handling of
the UP security policy should be the same as described in clause 6.10.2.1 in
TS 33.501 [4]. The MN always forwards the UE capability including the UP
security capability and the UP security policy to the SN. The SN makes the
decision whether to activate UP integrity protection or not, and also whether
to activate UP encryption or not. Therefore, it is proposed to go forward with
alternative 2 in clause 6.7.3.1.2.
In the scenario of \'split PDU session\' when MN offloads some of the DRB(s)
for a PDU session to a ng-eNB acting as a SN, the handling of the UP security
policy should be the same as for NR-DC as described in clause 6.10.4 in TS
33.501 [4].
The ng-eNB and the 5G core network could be of different releases, e.g.:
\- a Rel-15 ng-eNB connected to a Rel-16 5G core network;
A Rel-15 ng-eNB cannot activate UP integrity protection with a Rel-16 UE
supporting UP IP over e-UTRA for any established DRB\'s with the Rel-16 UE. A
Rel-15 ng-eNB would ignore any additional capability or indication from a
Rel-16 5G core network which indicates the Rel-16 UE supports UP IP over
e-UTRA.
\- a Rel-16 ng-eNB connected to a Rel-15 5G core network;
A Rel-16 ng-eNB cannot activate UP integrity protection with a Rel-16 UE
supporting UP IP over e-UTRA for any established DRB\'s if the Rel-16 ng-eNB
is connected to a Rel-15 5G core network. A Rel-15 5G core network would
ignore any additional capability or indication from a Rel-16 UE which
indicates the Rel-16 UE supports UP IP over e-UTRA and would not be able to
indicate to the Rel-16 ng-eNB that the Rel-16 UE supports UP IP over e-UTRA).
This solution requires that both 5G core network and ng-eNB are upgraded in
order to be able to activate UP IP over E-UTRA.
6.8 Solution #8: Using existing 5G UE security capability to signal the UE
support of UP IP over eUTRA to 5GC
6.8.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #6 (UE connected to 5GC indicating support
of UP IP over eUTRA).
This solution only impacts the UE and the ng-eNB.
6.8.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 5 - 5G core with eUTRA
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
6.8.3 Solution description
The solution is to use one of the bits that is used to indicate support of an
EEA or EIA algorithm that is currently not used in 5G UE Security Capability
IE (see 9.11.3.54 of TS 24.501 [10]) to indicate that the UE supports user
plane integrity protection with an ng-eNB.
This information element is already protected to the core network in NAS
signalling and also replayed to the UE to ensure Man-in-the-middle attacks are
avoided. It is also already signalled to the RAN nodes so would require no
additional signalling.
6.8.4 Solution evaluation
This solution meets the security requirement for key issue #6 and only impacts
the UE and the ng-NB as it reuses the existing NAS signalling and the
information element in a secure manner to indicate UE\'s support of user plane
integrity protection over eUTRA to the network.
## 6.9 Solution #9: Adding padding in the data part
### 6.9.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #5.
The aLTEr attack mentioned in [5], an active attack called \"user data
redirection\" is proposed, in which the attacker could change the DNS packet
address even when the packet is encrypted.
The proposed issue is caused by adequate of integrity protection. When there
is no UP IP, the attacker could change the destination address even the
encryption is used. The solution is proposing to add some random length
padding, thus the attacker would not know which part is the destination
address when the validation time is limited to a tight higher bound.
### 6.9.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 2 - NR standalone with 5G Core
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 6.9.3 Solution Description
5G NR PDCP PDUs is formatted as mentioned in 3GPP TS 38.323 clause 6.2.2.
Hence, each PDCP data PDU will be composed of PDCP SN, data payload and an
optional 4B MAC-i payload. As per spec, data unit that is ciphered is the data
part of the PDCP Data PDU except the SDAP header if included in the PDCP SDU,
and the MAC-I.
{width="3.560416666666667in" height="3.040277777777778in"}
Figure 6.9.3-1: PDCP data PDU format (refer to TS38.331)
In a new implementation, it is possible to add padding bytes to data part(The
data part includes the IP header and will be encrypted). These padding bytes
and the Padding Size LI can be part of the cipher payload. One example of such
an implementation is as follows:
\- One of the \"R\" bits in the PDCP header can be used to indicate if Padding
is included.
\- One of the \"R\"bits in the PDCP header can be used to indicate the whole
length of the PDU.
\- Padding Size is added at the octet \"N-4\". It can range from 0 - 255
octets. The first half is used to indicate how many bits is added before the
data part, and the second half is used to indicate how many bits is added
after the data part.
\- Non-Zero Initialized Padding Bytes (based on Padding Size) are added after
the data part of the PDCP PDU.
\- Transmit PDCP entity can determine \"randomly\" a value from 0 - 255 bytes
of padding.
In some implementations, padding size could be limited to a maximum of \"x\" %
of the original PDCP PDU to avoid wasting bandwidth. Padding could be
configured by the network in RRC Signaling.
{width="2.9277777777777776in" height="3.1125in"}
Figure 6.9.3-2: New PDCP data PDU format
With this mechanism, the attacker could not know where to put the offset since
all the data part is encrypted and the destination address is not in the first
few bits anymore. However, the attack could still try [the length of the
padding] times to verify where exactly the true data part. So the solution
could be enhanced with adding the limitation of validation times. Thus even if
the attacker does not corrupt the padding, they\'ll just end up corrupting the
SDU itself unless they guess exactly the right offset.
### 6.9.4 Solution Evaluation
PDCP PDU maximum size is 9000byte, when the IP packet is less than 8744byte,
there will be no impact.
Editor\'s Note: This solution doesn\'t work when confidentiality is not used.
Editor\'s Note: Further evaluation is FFS.
## 6.10 Solution #10: UE activating UP IP over eUTRA to EPC
### 6.10.1 Introduction
This solution addresses KI#2 (Secure negotiation of integrity protection
support in EPS).This solution describes how the UE tells the eUTRA the support
of UP IP, and how the eUTRA activates the UP IP with the UE.
### 6.10.2 Network options affected
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
### 6.10.3 Solution Description
In TS 33.401 [3], UP encryption is activated after UE successfully verifies
the integrity protection of the AS SMC message. This means that UP ciphering
is always on for UE connects to EPC via eUTRA. But for activating UP IP in
eUTRA when UE connects to EPC, the \"always on\" feature for UP integrity will
consume a lot of resources and reduce the user experience. Therefore, the
similar scheme as defined in TS 33.501 [4] is introduced, which is the eUTRA
will control whether the UP IP is activated or not. But due to the impact on
EPC should be limited, which means the MME should not be mandatory to be
upgraded to send the UP security policy to the eUTRA, so the eUTRA is based on
its configuration to decide whether the UP IP is activated or not.
The eUTRA recognizes whether the UE supporting UP IP by reading the UE
capability IE. As there are 4 reserved bits in UE capability IE, one of them
can be used by the UE to indicate whether the UP IP is supported by this UE.
If the eUTRA finds the UE supporting UP IP feature and decides the UP IP is
activated, then it will signal the UE in AS SMC.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS that how the eUTRA make decisions on the UP IP
policy.
The UE will activate the UP IP after successfully checks the integrity of AS
SMC, and the eUTRA will activate the UP IP after sending the AS SMC.
### 6.10.4 Solution Evaluation
TBD
## 6.11 Solution #11: Support of UP IP in EPS
### 6.11.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #1 (UP integrity activation in EPS). A UE
which has been upgraded to support UP IP over LTE access, when connected to
EPS, needs to indicate UE support of UP IP to the network.
This solution impacts the UE, the MME, the HSS and the LTE eNB.
### 6.11.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
### 6.11.3 Solution Description
The UE capability to support UP IP over LTE access when connected to EPS could
be indicated in Attach Request and Tracking Area Update Request message. A new
IE could be included in the Attach Request message and Tracking Area Update
Request message. The new IE would need to be mapped on the S1 interface to the
LTE eNB.
The transfer of the new IE would also have impact on S10 interface between
MME\'s. For coexistence with legacy nodes then support needs to be signalled
by the UE again during mobility procedures at MME change, but this should not
be a problem as the UE would initiate a new Tracking Area Update procedure at
MME change anyway. Also, it is not envisioned that the LTE eNB would be
upgraded, without upgrading the MME as well.
The MME could apply/request use of UP IP at PDN Connection establishment (on
par with 5GS). UP IP would then be applied per PDN connection lifetime.
The MME could configure a security policy for UP IP i.e. a UP IP policy, per
APN and/or the MME could determine the UP IP policy by potentially retrieving
a UP IP policy for the subscription stored in the HSS or from the locally
configured UP IP policy. The determined UP IP policy would be configured per
UE. The UP IP policy could use similar setting options as in 5GS:
\"required\", \"preferred\", \"not needed\".
The MME provides the determined UP IP policy per UE to the LTE eNB on the S1
interface.
The UP IP policy could be extended to a UP security policy which includes a
security policy for UP encryption as well. This would harmonize the feature
over both systems (EPS and 5GS).
The enabling/disabling of UP IP for DRB\'s is done using AS SMC procedure and
RRC Reconfiguration procedure, similar as in NR.
### 6.11.4 Handling of legacy UE's and legacy network nodes in EPS
It is expected that if the eNB is upgraded to support UP IP, then the
connected MME is upgraded as well to support the UP security policy (i.e. UP
IP). A legacy eNB which is not supporting UP IP, is most likely connected to
MME which is not supporting the UP security policy (i.e. UP IP).
**Legacy UE's:**
A legacy UE which establishes a new PDN connection with an upgraded MME and
eNB (to support UP IP), should be handled by the MME and the eNB in the legacy
way, and this decision could be based upon a configured operator policy. If
the configured operator policy allows the upgraded MME/eNB to handle the
legacy UE, then the MME cannot determine a UP IP policy to \"required\" as UP
IP cannot be activated by the eNB with the legacy UE. In this case the MME
should determine a UP IP policy to be set to \"not required\".
**Legacy network nodes:**
An upgraded UE (to support UP IP), which establishes a new PDN connection with
a legacy MME, UP IP cannot be activated by the eNB (even if the eNB supports
UP IP).
**Mobility:**
At MME change (both at handover and idle mode mobility) a PDN connection with
UP IP "required" shall be deactivated if UP IP is not supported by the target
MME/target eNB or the new MME. At handover, if the source MME and the source
eNB are upgraded to support UP IP, then the source MME/source eNB shall ensure
that the PDN connection with activated UP IP due to a setting of UP IP to be
"required" is not handed over to a target MME or a target eNB which does not
support UP IP. At idle mode mobility, if the new MME is not upgraded to
support UP IP, then PDN connection contexts with a setting of UP IP to be
"required" shall not be forwarded from the old MME to the new MME.
### 6.11.5 Solution Evaluation
Editor\'s Note: write an evaluation of the solution against the relevant key
issues here (or have an editor\'s note saying that it is to be added later.)
This solution meets the security requirement for key issue #1 (UP integrity
activation in EPS) and impacts the UE, the MME, the LTE eNB and the HSS.
Currently the solution does not work when the UE and network nodes are of
different releases, for example if a legacy UE wants to transfer data but the
MME determines a UP IP policy to \"required\". If the configured operator
policy allows the upgraded MME/eNB to handle the legacy UE, then in this case
the MME should determine a UP IP policy to be set to \"not required\".
## 6.12 Solution #12: Using spare bit in existing 5G UE security capability to
signal the UE support of UP IP over eUTRA to 5GC
### 6.12.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #6 (UE connected to 5GC indicating support
of UP IP over eUTRA).
This solution impacts the UE, the AMF and the ng-eNB.
### 6.12.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 4 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 5 - 5G core with eUTRA
\- Option 7 - 5G core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
### 6.12.3 Solution Description
The solution is to use one of the spare bits that is currently not used in 5G
UE Security Capability IE (see clause 9.11.3.54 of TS 24.501 [10] copied below
as _Figure 6.12.3-1_) to indicate that the UE supports user plane integrity
protection with an ng-eNB. This would avoid taking one of the existing code
points for indicating support/no support for encryption algorithms and
integrity algorithms.

_Figure 6.12.3-1: UE security capability information element_
This information element is already protected to the core network in NAS
signalling and also replayed to the UE to ensure Man-in-the-middle attacks are
avoided.
This new spare bit would need to be signalled from the AMF to the RAN nodes
and therefore mapped to a new information element on N2 interface. This new
spare bit would also need to be signalled on the Xn interface between the RAN
nodes and therefore mapped to a new information element on Xn interface.
At N2 handover with AMF re-allocation, the new spare bit would need to be
signalled from the source AMF to the target AMF on N14 interface, mapped to a
new information element.
At IW HO from 5GS to EPS and IW HO from EPS to 5GS, the new spare bit would be
need to be signalled on N26 interface, mapped to a new information element.
The UE will always include the new spare bit in the following Registration
Request message, as t he UE security capability IE is always included in the
Registration Request message at mobility when there is a possible AMF change.
### 6.12.4 Solution Evaluation
This solution meets the security requirement for key issue #6 (UE connected to
5GC indicating support of UP IP over eUTRA) and impacts the UE, the AMF and
the ng-eNB.
It reuses the existing NAS signalling and the information element in a secure
manner to indicate UE\'s support of user plane integrity protection over eUTRA
to the network.
6.13 Solution #13: Using existing IEs to signal the UE support of UP IP over
UTRA to EPC
6.13.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #2 (Secure negotiation of integrity
protection support in EPS).
This solution only impacts the UE and the eNB.
6.13.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
6.13.3 Solution description
The solution is to use one of the bits that is used to indicate support of an
EEA or EIA algorithm that is currently not used in the UE network capability
IE and UE Security Capability IE (see clauses 9.9.3.34 and 9.9.3.36 of TS
24.301 [11] respectively) to indicate that the UE supports user plane
integrity protection with an eNB.
This information element is already protected to the core network in NAS
signalling and also replayed to the UE to ensure Man-in-the-middle attacks are
avoided. It is also already signalled to the RAN nodes so would require no
additional signalling.
6.13.4 Solution evaluation
This solution meets the security requirement for key issue #2 and only impacts
the UE and the eNB as it reuses the existing NAS signalling and the
information element in a secure manner to indicate UE\'s support of user plane
integrity protection over eUTRA to the network.
## 6.14 Solution #14: LTE-EPC UP IP with option 3X/1X
### 6.14.1 Introduction
This solution uses NR PDCP in the EPS and UE to provide full rate User Plane
Integrity Protection.
It is based on the capability of \"Option 3\" UEs to support NR PDCP (when
used in the \"option 3X\" configuration), however the part of the UE\'s NR
PDCP functionality used in an \"option 3X\" configuration may need to be
extended to support NR UP IP capability. This solution would not change the
UE\'s implementation of LTE PDCP.
NOTE: Other solutions may be proposed, e.g. that use User Plane Integrity
Protection in LTE PDCP.
Within the network, the option 3X architecture the eNB can remotely control an
entity implementing NR PDCP functionality.
With Release 17 RAN work (WID in RP-193181) on the Control Plane - User plane
split of E-UTRAN, the architecture of option 1 will also allow the control
plane of the eNB to remotely control an entity implementing PDCP
functionality. As a deployment option, the network\'s PDCP functionality could
be located at a gNB site (which uses NR-PDCP).
With the option 3X architecture, the UE\'s data radio bearers use NR-PDCP
(specified in TS 38.323). The NR-PDCP firmware can be located in a separate
gNB site, or in the \"Centralised Unit\" of a gNB implemented with a CU-DU
split. This PDCP firmware can be common to what is used by the UE in \"Option
2\" operation and hence may be able to support User Plane Integrity
Protection.
As specified in clause 4.2.2 of Release 15, TS 37.340:
_\"In E-UTRA connected to EPC, if the UE supports EN-DC, regardless whether
EN-DC is configured or not, the network can configure either E-UTRA PDCP or NR
PDCP for MN terminated MCG bearers while NR PDCP is always used for all other
bearers_.\"
Figure 6.14.1-1: Radio Protocol Architecture for MCG, SCG and split bearers
from a UE perspective in MR-DC with EPC (EN-DC)
### 6.14.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
### 6.14.3 Solution description
With the option 3X architecture, the UE\'s data radio bearers use NR-PDCP
(specified in TS 38.323). The NR-PDCP firmware can be located in a separate
gNB site, or in the \"Centralised Unit\" of a gNB implemented with a CU-DU
split. This network PDCP firmware is what is expected to be used by \"Option
2\" UEs and hence can be expected to be able to support User Plane Integrity
protection.
When configured to use EN-DC, the UE does not know whether the network will
allocate radio resources on the NR cell, or the LTE cell, or both. The network
allocates these resources dynamically - e.g. on a per TTI basis (1 ms on LTE,
500 ms (or less) on NR with 30 kHz subcarrier spacing). When resources are
allocated on NR, the HARQ loop timings need to comply with the NR
specifications, and these require faster processing times than on LTE. Hence
the PDCP layer in an EN-DC UE needs to be adapted to work with NR speeds.
In Release 15, it is also perfectly feasible for the network to configure an
EN-DC capable UE to use NR PDCP without the use of dual connectivity. This is
specified in clause 4.2.2 of Release 15, TS 37.340 (copied below). Hence the
addition of User Plane Integrity Protection in LTE could be realistic in, a UE
that supports Option 2 UPIP.
_In E-UTRA connected to EPC, if the UE supports EN-DC, regardless whether EN-
DC is configured or not, the network can configure either E-UTRA PDCP or NR
PDCP for MN terminated MCG bearers while NR PDCP is always used for all other
bearers._
Figure 6.14.3-1: Radio Protocol Architecture for MCG, SCG and split bearers
from a UE perspective in MR-DC with EPC (EN-DC)
Future changes to the UE\'s NR-PDCP firmware to support full rate option 2 NR
UPIP may be able to be used by the UE with option 3(X) and hence also for
option 1. The UE's UPIP capabilities would be based on the NR algorithm
options and would be signalled (to the MME) by adding 2 extra octets into the
UE additional security capability IE defined in TS 24.301 clause 9.9.3.53 (by
adding 2 octets, independent interoperability testing of the User Plane
Integrity Protection for each of the NR PDCP algorithms is possible).
Editor\'s Note: The activation of UP security also needs to be described \--
whether it's via AS SMC or RRC reconfiguration.
### 6.14.4 Solution Evaluation
Editor\'s Note: To be completed-- extra aspects may still be identified.
This solution requires RAN upgrades and UE updates. Specifically, UE, MME,
(and SGW and PGW) and RAN (S1 and e.g. X2) signalling software updates are
expected. The UE PDCP layer needs to support FR UPIP.
NOTE: This solution requires UE to support NR-PDCP with the capability to run
Integrity Protection at its full LTE data rate.
UE performance impact would be similar to that of NR devices, except that the
lower data rates of LTE mean that the performance impact might well be less.
## 6.15 Solution #x: \'APN based control of UPIP usage\'
### 6.15.1 Introduction
This solution addresses KI#8.
The solution uses the UE's APN to resolve to a combined "PGW+SMF" in the
HPLMN, and the 5GC PCF configures the PGW+SMF according to its existing 5GC
behaviour. When the UE registers in EPC, the UPIP policy is downloaded in
GTP-C signalling to the VPLMN's EPC, and then sent in S1-AP signalling to the
RAN.
### 6.15.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
\- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
\- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
### 6.15.3 Solution Description
The solution is that the UE's APN resolves to a combined "PGW+SMF" in the
HPLMN, and the 5GC PCF configures the PGW+SMF according to its existing 5GC
behaviour.
The GTP-C signalling from PGW to SGW to MME is extended to carry the "UPIP
required/preferred/not needed" information to the MME. As GTP-C signalling
largely operates on an EPS bearer basis rather than PDN connection basis, this
signalling is sent on a per EPS-bearer basis.
Existing GTP-C signalling compatibility concepts are reused to enable the PGW
and SGW to have prior knowledge as to whether the SGW and MME support this
"UPIP required/preferred/not needed" signalling. Hence the PGW can block the
establishment of EPS bearers on MMEs that do not support UPIP "policing".
The UE's support (or not) for Full Rate UPIP is signalled from the UE to the
MME.
The MME uses the "UPIP required/preferred/not needed" information from the PGW
and the UE's support for FR-UPIP to determine what EPS bearers are permitted
to be established when the UE performs a Service Request (or Attach, PDN
Connectivity Request or Dedicated Bearer Activation occurs).
For those bearers that pass this check, the MME signals the "UPIP
required/preferred/not needed" information to the eNB in R17 extensions of
S1-AP signalling that:
a) allow the UPIP "Preferred" and "Not-needed" settings to be ignored by a
non-supporting eNB, and
b) ensure that the UPIP "Required" setting causes a non-supporting eNB to
reject the request. (This procedure might be enhanced by UPIP-supporting eNBs
indicating their support in the S1 Setup message).
Using similar message encoding techniques, at S1 handover (including 5GC to
EPC handover), the 'source to target transparent container' is used to signal
the "UPIP required/preferred/not needed" information to the target eNB.
At X2 handover, X2-AP signalling extensions carry the "UPIP
required/preferred/not needed" information to the target eNB using similar
message encoding techniques.
NOTE 1: Use of the above message encoding within the S1 interface transparent
container enables "UPIP Required" enforcement at inter-MME handover (and 5GC
to EPC handover) to a target MME that does not support UPIP policing.
NOTE 2: To restore UPIP usage (when "Preferred") after S1/X2 handovers from a
non-supporting eNB to a supporting eNB, the MME inserts the "UPIP
required/preferred/not needed" information into the S1-AP Handover Command (S1
case) and Path Switch Request Ack (X2 case) messages.
NOTE 3: Use of "UPIP Required" is not recommended unless the HPLMN is
confident that the UE will only move within areas where there is full VPLMN
support for UPIP.
NOTE 4: The PGW is not aware of the UE's support (or not) for FR UPIP on EPC.
The PGW does not need to be aware of the UE's support level because the 'UPIP
policing' function has to be performed in the MME and not in the PGW+SMF. This
is because (in contrast to 5GC), EPS procedures such as Service Request need
only involve the MME and need not involve the PGW+SMF.
NOTE 5: As described in solution #14, with Release 17 RAN work (WID in
RP-193181) on the Control Plane - User plane split of E-UTRAN, the
architecture of option 1 will also allow the control plane of the eNB to
remotely control an entity implementing PDCP functionality. As a deployment
option, the network\'s PDCP functionality could be located at a gNB site
(which uses NR-PDCP).
### 6.15.4 Solution Evaluation
Editor\'s Note: To be completed.
## 6.16 Solution #16: Use existing behaviour to block transfer to EPS of PDN
connections that have UPIP set to "Required"
### 6.16.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #7 (Ensuring UP IP is enforced at
interworking).
This solution has no impact on any node.
### 6.16.2 Network options affected
This solution is applicable to the following network options:
> \- Option 1 - eUTRA with EPC
>
> \- Option 3 - EPC based Dual Connectivity of eUTRA and NR RAT
### 6.16.3 Solution description
The solution proposes to keep the existing procedures for not passing bearers
that require UP IP to EPS. This ensures that no bearer that requires UP IP is
ever used without UP IP.
### 6.16.4 Solution evaluation
The solution has no impact to any nodes but comes at the cost of not being
able to move bearers that require UP IP to EPS. For a UE with UPIP set to
Required for all its PDN connections (and an MME that does not support "attach
without PDN connectivity"), the NG-RAN would keep the UE connection until it
suffers radio link failure and therefore cause extra interference into
adjacent LTE cells. This is an issue of existing behaviour and not introduced
by this solution.

# 7 Conclusions
## 7.1 Conclusions on UE connects to 5GC via eUTRA
It is concluded that the Rel-15 architectural approach of applying user plane
integrity protection at NR PDCP layer in TS 33.501 is adopted as the basis for
normative work for the following network options:
\- Option 2 - NR standalone with 5G Core
\- Option 4 - 5G Core based Dual Connectivity (NR master - eUTRA secondary)
\- Option 5 - 5G Core with eUTRA
\- Option 7 - 5G Core based Dual Connectivity (eUTRA master - NR secondary)
For Key Issue #6 (UE connected to 5GC indicating support of UP IP over eUTRA),
Solution #8 (Using existing 5G UE security capability to signal the UE support
of UP IP over eUTRA to 5GC) is adopted for the normative work.
