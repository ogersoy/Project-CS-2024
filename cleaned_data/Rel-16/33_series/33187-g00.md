# 4 Security Requirements
## 4.1 Requirements on SCEF -- 3GPP Network Entity reference point
The SCEF is controlled by the 3GPP operator or a business partner e.g. by
another operator than the 3GPP operator controlling the Network Entity or by a
3^rd^ party, the SCEF -- 3GPP Network Entity reference point shall fulfil the
following requirements:
\- integrity protection, replay protection, confidentiality protection and
privacy protection for communication between the SCEF and 3GPP Network Entity
shall be supported;
\- mutual authentication between 3GPP Network Entity and SCEF shall be
supported;
\- integrity protection and replay protection shall be used;
\- confidentiality protection should be used;
\- privacy of the 3GPP user shall be provided (e.g. IMSI/IMPI shall not be
sent outside the 3GPP operator's domain);
\- the 3GPP Network Entity shall be able to determine whether the SCEF is
authorized to send requests to the 3GPP Network Entity;
\- the 3GPP Network Entity may be able to determine whether authorization
shall be per UE, or optionally per service per UE.
NOTE: How to achieve authorization per UE or per service per UE is specific to
application and network configuration. For example, if the SCEF -- 3GPP
Network Entity reference point does not support such authorization, the SCEF
may need to contact HSS before forwarding the request to the 3GPP Network
Entity (or to the IWK-SCEF in case of roaming). The mechanism of such
authorization is not specified in 3GPP standards.
The same security requirements apply also when applications operating in the
trust domain access network entities (e.g. PCRF), wherever the required 3GPP
interface(s) are made available, directly without going through the SCEF.
## 4.2 Requirements on Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF)
The functionality of the Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) includes
the following:
\- support ability to satisfy security requirements on SCEF -- 3GPP Network
Entity reference point in clause 4. 1;
\- it shall be able to determine whether the Application is authorized to send
requests for the 3GPP Network Entity, where authorization shall be per UE or
optionally per service per UE.
NOTE: SCEF may include authentication, authorization, and access control list
management functionality or it may rely on the authorization decisions made by
the 3GPP Network Entity via reference point SCEF -- 3GPP Network Entity. The
mechanism of such authorization performed by the SCEF is not specified in 3GPP
standards. However, the mechanisms for asking authorization decision from the
HSS by the SCEF are in the scope of 3GPP.
## 4.3 Requirements on SCEF -- Interworking SCEF reference point
The requirements for the SCEF -- Interworking SCEF reference point include the
following:
\- the same integrity protection, replay protection, confidentiality
protection and privacy protection requirements from clause 4. 1 apply for the
interface T7 between the SCEF and IWK-SCEF.
\- the IWK-SCEF shall be able to determine whether the SCEF in the HPLMN is
authorized to send requests for the 3GPP Network Entity.
## 4.4 Requirements on MTC
The security requirements for MTC include the following:
\- MTC optimizations shall not degrade security compared to non-MTC
communications 3GPP TS 22.368 [2]
## 4.5 Requirements on Tsp reference point
The Tsp reference point shall fulfil the following requirements:
\- integrity protection, replay protection, confidentiality protection and
privacy protection for communication between the MTC-IWF and SCS shall be
supported:
\- mutual authentication between two directly communicating entities in the
security domains, in which MTC-IWF and SCS respectively reside, shall be
supported;
\- the use of mutual authentication shall follow the provisions in TS 29.368
[4];
\- integrity protection and replay protection shall be used;
\- confidentiality protection should be used;
\- privacy shall be provided (e.g. IMSI shall not be sent outside the 3GPP
operator domain).
## 4.6 Requirements on MTC-IWF
The functionality of the MTC-IWF includes the following:
\- support ability to satisfy security requirements on Tsp reference point in
clause 4. 5.
## 4.7 Requirements on T8 reference point
The T8 reference point shall fulfil the following requirements:
\- integrity protection, replay protection, confidentiality protection and
privacy protection for communication between the SCEF and SCS/AS shall be
supported:
\- mutual authentication between two directly communicating entities in the
security domains, in which SCEF and SCS respectively reside, shall be
supported;
\- the use of mutual authentication shall follow the provisions in clause 5.5;
\- integrity protection and replay protection shall be used;
\- confidentiality protection should be used;
\- privacy shall be provided;
\- IMSI shall not be sent outside the 3GPP operator domain.
\- the SCEF shall be able to determine whether the SCS/AS is authorized to
send requests to the 3GPP Network Entity;
\- the SCEF may be able to determine whether authorization shall be per UE, or
optionally per service per UE.
# 5 General security procedures
## 5.1 Security procedures for Tsp interface security
The security procedures for the Tsp interface are specified in TS 29.368 [4].
## 5.2 Security procedures for reference point SCEF -- 3GPP Network Entity
### 5.2.0 Introduction
This clause specifies how the reference point SCEF -- 3GPP Network Entity
shall be secured. There are two different scenarios to consider:
\- when the SCEF is considered as a 3GPP network function; or
\- when the SCEF is not considered as a 3GPP network function.
### 5.2.1 SCEF is considered as a 3GPP network function
If the SCEF and the 3GPP Network Entity are both considered as 3GPP network
functions then this interface shall be protected using NDS/IP as defined in TS
33.210 [15].
If the peers reside in different security domains, functional entity Security
GW shall be used to authenticate and authorize the individual instance of SCEF
and to secure the interface between the 3GPP Network Entity and the individual
instance of SCEF as defined in TS 33.310 [17].
If the operator does not use the mechanisms described in this clause, then
other adequate security measures shall be taken to ensure security on that
interface. It is up to the operator, i.e. the owner of the 3GPP Network
Entity, to decide whether the reference point SCEF -- 3GPP Network Entity is
trusted or physically protected, or whether it needs protection by a
cryptographic protocol as specified above.
### 5.2.2 SCEF is not considered as a 3GPP network function
The security procedure as defined for the Tsp interface in TS 29.368 [4] shall
be implemented/supported, where the 3GPP Network Entity takes the role as the
MTC-IWF and the SCEF takes the role as the SCS, unless the security procedures
for the relevant reference point SCEF -- 3GPP Network Entity has been defined
explicitly in some other specification (e.g. security procedures for MB2-C
reference point are defined in TS 33.246[16]).
## 5.3 Security procedures for reference point Application -- 3GPP Network
Entity
The security procedure as defined for the Tsp interface in TS 29.368 [4] shall
be implemented/supported, where the 3GPP Network Entity takes the role as the
MTC-IWF and the Application takes the role as the SCS, unless the security
procedures for the relevant reference point Application -- 3GPP Network Entity
has been defined explicitly in some other specification (e.g. security
procedures for MB2-C reference point are defined in TS 33.246[16]).
## 5.4 Security procedures for reference point SCEF -- Interworking SCEF
The interface between SCEF and Interworking SCEF shall be protected using
NDS/IP as defined in TS 33.210 [15].
## 5.5 Security procedures for reference point SCEF-SCS/AS
### 5.5.1 Mutual authentication
For authentication of the T8 reference point, mutual authentication based on
client and server certificates shall be performed between the SCEF and the
SCS/AS using TLS.
Certificate based authentication shall follow the profiles given in 3GPP TS
33.310 [17], clauses 6.1.3a and 6.1.4a. The structure of the PKI used for the
certificate is out of scope of the present document.
### 5.5.2 Security profiles
TLS shall be used to provide integrity protection, replay protection and
confidentiality protection for T8 interface. The support of TLS on T8
interface is mandatory. Security profiles for TLS implementation and usage
shall follow the provisions given in TS 33.310 [17], Annex E.
### 5.5.3 Authorization of SCS/AS's requests
After the authentication, SCEF determines whether the SCS / AS is authorized
to send requests for the 3GPP Network Entity. The SCEF shall authorize the
requests from SCS / AS using OAuth-based authorization mechanism, the specific
authorization mechanisms shall follow the provisions given in RFC6749 [18].
### 5.5.4 Support for CAPIF
When the SCEF supports CAPIF as specified in sub-clause 4.4.8 in TS 23.682
[2], then CAPIF core function shall choose the appropriate CAPIF-2e security
method as defined in the sub-clause 6.5.2 in TS 33.122[19] for mutual
authentication, authorization and protection of the SCEF-SCS/AS interface.
# 6 Security procedures for Device Triggering
## 6.1 Network based solution for filtering SMS-delivered device trigger
messages
The following solution may be implemented to filter SMS-delivered device
trigger messages.\ This solution relies on the fact that there is a
standardized indicator in the SM that can be used to distinguish a trigger SM
from other types of SM, i.e. TP Protocol Id as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040
[5].\ The solution further assumes that legitimate trigger SMs are delivered
via either a SMS-SC in the HPLMN that can verify the identity of the SME
sending a legitimate trigger SM over Tsms, or via an MTC-IWF in the HPLMN that
can verify the identity of the SCS sending a legitimate trigger SM over Tsp.
The HPLMN shall implement Home Network Routing according to 3GPP TS 23.040 [5]
for Mobile Terminated SMs destined for all HPLMN subscribers that need
protection against unauthorised SMS-delivered device trigger messages (e.g.
all subscriptions that may be used in MEs that support SMS-delivered device
triggering).\ Home Network Routing shall have the effect of forcing the
delivery of the SM to an SMS Router in the HPLMN rather than to the serving
MSC/VLR, SGSN or MME of the destination UE. If an SM received by the SMS
Router does not originate from the SMS-SC in the HPLMN that handles SMS-
delivered device trigger messages, then the SMS Router shall forward the SM to
infrastructure that shall filter and block all SMs that contain a trigger
indication.
\- Referring to the SMS architecture and function defined in 3GPP TS 23.040
[5] and 3GPP TS 23.204 [9], SMSs need to be delivered through SMS-SC. On the
basis of the architecture of machine-type communication, for SMS based device
trigger and 3GPP TS 23.040 [5], the SMS-SC can receive short message with the
related sender and receiver's identities from three paths, i.e. SME via Tsms
interface or T4 interface or from SMS-IWMSC. Filtering SMS-delivered device
trigger messages is network-based, so the fake triggering SMSs from an
attacker shall be distinguished and blocked to be sent by SMS-SC on the
network side. The following is how these three paths work for SMS-SC to
receive short messages: If an SM received by the SMS-SC in the HPLMN that
handles SMS-delivered device trigger messages does not originate from the T4
interface, then the SMS-SC shall forward the SM to filtering infrastructure.\
If an SM received by the filtering infrastructure contains a trigger
indication, and does not originate from a trusted SME that is authorised to
send trigger SMs, then the SM shall be blocked.\ If an SM received by the
filtering infrastructure contains a trigger indication, and does originate
from a trusted SME that is authorised to send trigger SMs, then the filtering
infrastructure shall only allow trigger requests to be sent to particular UEs
that the trusted SME is authorised to send to. It is outside the scope of this
specification how the filtering infrastructure shall determine if a trusted
SME is allowed to send a device trigger to a particular UE.
\- When SMS-SC receives short message which is forwarded by MTC-IWF via T4
interface, the SMS-SC ensures T4 interface is trusted and sends the short
message, because the MTC-IWF can authenticate MTC server and ensure that only
the authorized MTC Server can trigger the particular MTC devices.
\- When the SMS-SC receives short messages from SMS-IWMSC, the SMS-SC shall
also forward the SM to filtering infrastructure. Thus the SMS-SC can check if
the SM is originated from an authorized SME by checking the receiver's
authorized sender list. If not, it should block the fake SM to be sent.
If a trigger request received by the MTC-IWF originates from the Tsp
interface, then the MTC-IWF shall filter and block the trigger unless it
originates from a trusted SCS that is authorised to send trigger requests. The
procedure is described in 3GPP TS 23.682 [3] clause 5.2.1.
The normal UE is not allowed to send MO trigger SMSs to trigger MTC devices
according to section 9.2.3.9 of 3GPP TS 23.040 [5], so SMS-SC shall
distinguish and block the fake MO device trigger SMSs from normal UE's
subscription.
NOTE 1: Depending on operator policy, a trusted source may be authorized to
send trigger messages to any UE.
In order to protect against source spoofing, the interfaces used to transport
trigger messages shall be suitably secured. In particular, the Tsms, Tsp and
T4 interfaces shall be secured. Tsp interface security is specified in TS
23.682 [3] clause 4.3.3.1. The security mechanisms for the Tsms interface are
outside the scope of this specification.
Filtering of SMS can be performed according to the architecture specified in
3GPP TS 23.142 [6]. When the filtering entity receives an SM, it can identify
if the SM is a trigger SM based on some trigger indication contained in the SM
(i.e. TP Protocol Id as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [5]).
NOTE 2: In the above solution filtering is distributed between filtering
infrastructure associated with the SMS Router, filtering infrastructure
associated with the SMS-SC, and the filtering functions within the MTC-IWF.
This reflects the fact that the filtering needs to be invoked by an entity
which can verify the source of the SM on a locally connected interface. Whilst
the SMS Router is an optional entity that may be present in the MT case only,
it does not have the capability to verify the original source of messages on
the Tsp or Tsms interfaces, and therefore a solution where only the SMS Router
invokes filtering is not sufficient. The best place for filtering
infrastructure to associate with is SMS-SC which can filter SMs received from
all paths.
NOTE 3: The solution in this clause aims to protect against unauthorised
entities sending potentially high volumes of trigger messages to large numbers
of MTC devices to cause a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against
the core network. However, the solution only provides protection against SMS
application level threats; it does not protect against attacks where network
internal nodes or network signalling links are compromised or abused by an
attacker (e.g. spoofing of MAP_Forward_Short_Message operations containing
trigger indications towards target UEs on an SS7 connection). If such attacks
need to be mitigated, or if Home Network Routing is not supported by the
HPLMN, then the solution specified in this clause is not sufficient and some
form of end-to-end cryptographic protection of trigger messages is needed
between the MTC Application in the network and the MTC Application in the UE.
Such solutions may be provided at an application level outside the scope of
3GPP specifications. A solution to cryptographically protect trigger messages
may be introduced in a future 3GPP Release.
NOTE 4: There exists a scenario in which inter-PLMN SMC-SCs are directly
connected, thus the implementation of Home Network Routing is not mandatory.
# 7 Security procedures for secure connection
## 7.1 Introduction
The Secure Connection is a feature with which the network operator is able to
efficiently provide key material for securing the application protocol between
UE and a SCS (indirect model) or between UE and a MTC Application Server
(direct model).
GBA, as specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [7], is used to bootstrap authentication
and key agreement for application security based on the 3GPP AKA mechanism.
GBA shall be used to establish the keys for a UE initiated Secure Connection.
An extension to GBA, called GBAPush, is defined in 3GPP TS 33.223 [8]. GBAPush
is also used to establish keys for application security between two entities,
but unlike GBA, it is initiated from the network. GBAPush shall be used to
establish the keys for a network initiated Secure Connection.
Also other mechanisms (for example, using EAP-AKA authentication in scenarios
which GBA cannot apply to) can be used to provide the MTC Secure Connection
feature between the UE and SCS or between the UE and MTC Application Server.
These mechanisms are regarded to be outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.
The implementation of Secure Connection feature in the ME and network is
optional.
## 7.2 UE initiated secure connection
This solution is restricted to such UEs that support HTTP.
A UE-initiated Secure Connection shall be established using GBA as defined in
3GPP TS 33.220 [7].\ GBA shall be used regardless if the Secure Connection is
between the UE and SCS or between the UE and MTC Application Server. The SCS
and the MTC Application Server shall act as NAFs. The Secure Connection key
establishment using GBA is outlined as follows:
> The UE runs a GBA bootstrapping with the BSF via the Ub interface. This
> bootstrapping results in that the UE and BSF share a session key Ks and an
> identifier associated with the Ks, called B-TID. The UE next generates a
> Ks_(ext/int)_NAF key from key Ks, and establishes a connection with the
> intended NAF over the Ua interface. The NAF function is performed by the SCS
> in the indirect model, and by the MTC Application Server in the direct
> model. At the start of the communication, the UE provides the NAF with the
> B-TID. The NAF requests the Ks_(ext/int)_NAF, corresponding to the B-TID
> from the BSF. The UE and SCS/MTC Application Server can then protect the Ua
> application protocol (i.e. the Secure Connection) using the shared
> Ks_(ext/int)_NAF key.
It depends on the used Ua application protocol how the Ks_(ext/int)_NAF keys
are used in order to protect the communication between the UE and the SCS or
between the UE and the MTC Application Server.
## 7.3 Network initiated secure connection
A network-initiated Secure Connection shall be established using GBAPush as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.223 [8]. GBAPush shall be used regardless if the Secure
Connection is between the UE and SCS or between the UE and MTC Application
Server. The SCS and the MTC Application Server shall act as Push NAFs.\ The
Secure Connection key establishment using GBAPush is outlined as follows:
> The pushNAF, i.e. the SCS in the indirect model and the MTC Application
> Server in the direct model, determines the need to use GBAPush in order to
> establish keys for application security (i.e. a Secure Connection) with the
> UE. The pushNAF then requests a GBA Push-Info (GPI) and a Ks_(int/ext)_NAF
> key from the BSF and then forwards the GPI to the UE. The UE processes the
> GPI and generates a Ks_(ext/int)_NAF key from it. The UE and pushNAF can
> protect the Ua application protocol (i.e. the Secure Connection) using the
> shared Ks_(ext/int)_NAF key.
If the pushNAF (SCS or MTC Application Server) does not have IP connectivity
with the UE, the GPI can be sent in the Device Trigger to the UE via the Tsp
in case of SCS is the pushNAF and via Tsms in case of MTC Application Server
(acting as SME) is the pushNAF. In this case the GPI can serve two purposes:
it can be used to provide keys for the application protocol (i.e. Secure
Connection) and it can also be used protect the device trigger itself in an
end-to-end manner.
If the pushNAF (SCS or MTC Application Server) has IP connectivity with the
UE, the GPI can be sent within the application protocol that the MTC
application uses and used to provide keys for the Secure Connection.
It depends on the used Ua application protocol how the Ks_(ext/int)_NAF keys
are used in order to protect the communication between the UE and the SCS or
between the UE and the MTC Application Server.
# 8 Security procedures for restricting the USIM to specific UEs
## 8.1 UE-based procedure with USAT application pairing
### 8.1.1 General
This clause specifies how the use of a USIM can be restricted to specific MEs
thanks to UE-based solution relying on USAT application pairing. The solution
is optional for implementation in the User Equipment and in the operator
network.
To have USAT application pairing capable User Equipment, the ME shall support
USAT, as specified in 3GPP TS 31.111 [14].
### 8.1.2 Security procedure
USAT application pairing is successful when the IMEI or IMEISV retrieved from
the terminal matches the value or the range of values the UICC is configured
with. USAT application pairing fails if the terminal does not support USAT
command PROVIDE LOCAL INFORMATION.
An UE supporting USAT application pairing proceeds to Profile download as
specified in 31.111 [14]. Then, the USIM requests IMEI(SV) using PROVIDE LOCAL
INFORMATION proactive command. The ME sends the TERMINAL RESPONSE with its
IMEI(SV).
The file EF~IWL~ stores the IMEI(SV) or range of value to which the USIM is
bound.
The file EF~IPS~ stores the status of the last pairing check performed by the
UICC. The UICC checks the combination of USIM and MTC ME and sets the status
flag to "OK" in case of successful pairing check. The UICC also stores in the
file EF~IPD~ the IME(SV) value of the MTC ME. In case of unsuccessful pairing
check, the USIM sets the status flag to "KO" in the file EF~IPS~ and stores in
the file EF~IPD~ the IME(SV) value of the unauthorized MTC ME.
The status flag of pairing check (with value "OK or "KO") stored in the file
EF~IPS~ can be read by any terminal hosting the UICC. But, the IMEI(SV) value
stored in the file EF~IPD~ is protected by ADM right, only the operator can
retrieve this information. The information stored in the file EF~IPD~ provide
a mechanism to detect change of association between a USIM and a MTC ME. The
information stored in the files EF~IPS~ and EF~IPD~ can be read out locally by
the maintenance persons.
The UICC shall respond to any AUTHENTICATE command with error status words if:
\- IMEI or IMEISV provided by the ME is not in the corresponding white list
configured in the USIM (EF~IWL~)
Or
\- ME has not provided either IMEI or IMEISV
If the AUTHENTICATE command had been executed before the pairing procedure has
been successfully performed (in the case of pre-Rel-12 MEs), the UICC may need
to trigger a network attachment procedure by sending a proactive command
REFRESH(3G SESSION RESET).
UICC OTA mechanism (as specified in 3GPP TS 31.115 [10] / TS 31116 [11] and
ETSI TS 102 225 [12] and TS 102 226 [13]) is used to update the file EF~IWL~
stored in the USIM. This mechanism provides dynamic management of the pairing
to change the allowed combinations of USIM and MTC ME(s) by adding or removing
authorized IMEI(SV) values or IMEI(SV) ranges the file EF~IWL~.
