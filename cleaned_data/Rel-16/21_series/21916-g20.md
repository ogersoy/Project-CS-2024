# 4 Rel-16 Executive Summary
Release 16 can be seen as a set of independent improvements of the 5G System,
introduced in Rel-15 and described in TR 21.915 [2]. As such, several
references are made in the present document to pre-Rel-16 Features and to 5G
reference points and network functions.
Other Rel-16 enhancements are for Features that have been introduced several
Releases ago, including those related to Mission Critical, or to
Conversational services.
The main Rel-16 radio enhancements concern the 5G (NR) radio interface, but
also the 4G (LTE) radio, and improving the cooperation between them. For the
5G radio, the end user bit rate has been increased by introducing several
configurations of Carrier Aggregations and by adding 256QAM. Other radio
enhancements include the NR-based access to unlicensed spectrum, and some
enhancements in the fields of mobility and UE Power Saving. These radio
enhancements are presented in section 19.
As for the system-wide features, presented in sections 5 to 18, the overall
trend in Rel-16 is to make the 3GPP 5G System (5GS) a communication-enabling
platform suitable for a wide range of industries ("verticals"), such as e.g.
transportation (autonomous driving V2X, Railways, Maritime), automated
factories, healthcare, public safety and many more. In this respect, the
versatility and reliability of the 5GS has been further increased to make it
industry-grade compatible, with enhancements to Ultra-Reliable Low Latency
Communications (URLLC), Network Slicing, Edge Computing, Cellular IoT
(Internet of Things), Non-Public Networks, Positioning Services and LAN-type
services. In addition, the use of 5G as an underlying communication network
(i.e. to be used transparently by applications external to the network) has
been enhanced, mostly under the work on \"Northbound APIs\". Besides all these
industrial aspects, other Rel-16 enhancements cover the coexistence of 5G with
non-3GPP systems, entertainment (e.g. streaming and media distribution) and
network optimisations (e.g. user identity).

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-200295.
This Feature enhances 5G core network to support ultra-high reliability and
low-latency communications (URLLC). The main functionalities introduced here
are the support of redundant transmission, QoS monitoring, dynamic division of
the Packet Delay Budget, and enhancements of the session continuity mechanism.
[Redundant transmission for high-reliability communication]{.underline}
Some URLLC services request very high reliability that hardly can be supported
in an economical way by a single transport path. To support such services, a
redundant transmission mechanism is specified. User packets are duplicated and
simultaneously transferred to the receiver via two disjoint user plane paths.
The redundant packets are then eliminated at the receiver side. With this,
service failure can be avoided even in case the packet transmission via one
path occasionally fails or exceeds the delay requirement.
Different options are specified to support redundant transmission at different
layers (figures extracted from 23.501):
\- Dual-connectivity-based end-to-end redundant user plane paths: two
redundant PDU Sessions with independent user plane paths are established
between UE and DN. Packet replication and elimination are performed by the
upper layer of UE and DN, which are not specified in 3GPP.
Figure 1: redundant User Plane paths using Dual Connectivity
\- Support of redundant transmission on N3/N9 interfaces: for a PDU Session
used for URLLC services, two redundant N3/N9 tunnels with independent user
plane paths are established between UPF and NG-RAN to transfer the duplicated
user packets. Packet replication and elimination are performed by NG-RAN and
User Plan Function (UPF).
Figure 2: redundant transmission using two N3 and N9 tunnels between NG-RAN
and PSA UPF
\- Support of redundant transmission at transport layer: this approach assumes
that the backhaul provides two disjoint transport paths between UPF and RAN.
The redundancy functionality within NG-RAN and UPF makes use of the
independent paths at transport layer, which is not specified in 3GPP.
Figure 3: Redundant transmission using two N3 tunnels between the PSA UPF and
the NG-RAN node
[QoS Monitoring]{.underline}
QoS Monitoring is defined in this release for the measurement of packet delay
between UE and PSA UPF. The NG-RAN is required to provide the QoS Monitoring
of UL/DL packet delay at the Uu interface. The QoS Monitoring of UL/DL packet
delay between NG-RAN and PSA UPF can be performed at different levels of
granularities, i.e. per QoS flow level, or per GTP-U path level.
[Dynamic division of Packet Delay Budget]{.underline}
The Packet Delay Budget (PDB) of URLLC services is typically more stringent
than for traditional services. To obtain a more accurate delay budget for NG-
RAN, SA WG2 decided to allow a dynamic value for the core network PDB (CN
PDB), so that the SMF or NG-RAN can dynamically calculate delay budget of NG-
RAN based on the CN PDB.
[Enhancements of session continuity]{.underline}
When a UE moves, the user plane path of low latency services need to be
optimized to reduce the latency and to guarantee session continuity. Several
related mechanisms are developed or enhanced in this WI.
PDU Session Anchor (PSA) relocation for Ethernet PDU Session is specified in
this release. The target UPF will assist in the update of Ethernet forwarding
tables of Ethernet switches in the DN, so that UL/DL traffics will switch to
the target UPF once the UE moves.
For Uplink Classifier (ULCL) relocation, a forwarding tunnel between the old
and new ULCLs is introduced to avoid packet loss during relocation.
AF-influenced traffic routing mechanism is further enhanced to allow flexible
coordination between SMF and AF when user plane change events happen.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in RP-200887.
Basic support for URLLC was introduced in Release 15. It included Transmission
Time Interval (TTI) structures for low latency as well as methods for improved
reliability. Use cases with tighter requirements, e.g. higher reliability up
to 1E-6 and short latency in the order of 0.5 to 1ms, have been identified as
important areas for NR.
This work item is based on the outcome of the study items resulting in TR
38.824 [2] and TR 38.825 [3]. It specifies PDCCH enhancements, UCI
enhancements, PUSCH enhancements, enhanced inter UE TX
prioritization/multiplexing and enhanced UL configured grant transmission.
More precisely, the following key functionalities were introduced:
[DCI format 0_2 and DCI format 1_2]{.underline}
DCI format 0_2/1_2 with configurable sizes for most of the DCI fields are
introduced, which provides the possibility to improve the reliability by
decreasing the DCI size (e.g. \~24 bits) with appropriate RRC configuration of
the DCI fields. Details of DCI format 0_2/1_2 can be found in [4].
[Enhanced PDCCH monitoring capability]{.underline}
Rel-16 span-based PDCCH monitoring capability is introduced mainly for
achieving low latency. A UE can indicate a capability to monitor PDCCH
according to one or more of the combinations (X, Y) = (2, 2), (4, 3), and (7,
3) per SCS configuration of Î¼=0 and Î¼=1. A span is a number of consecutive
symbols in a slot where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH. If a UE
monitors PDCCH on a cell according to combination (X,Y), the UE supports PDCCH
monitoring occasions in any symbol of a slot with minimum time separation of X
symbols between the first symbol of two consecutive spans, and the number of
symbols of a span is up to Y. For each reported combination (X, Y), the UE
supports the limit M_PDCCH\^(max,(X,Y),Î¼) on the maximum number of monitored
PDCCH candidates per PDCCH monitoring span as defined in Table 10.1-2A in [5]
and the limit C_PDCCH\^(max,(X,Y),Î¼) on the maximum number of non-overlapped
CCEs for channel estimation per PDCCH monitoring span as defined in Table
10.1-3A in [5]. An example of PDCCH monitoring according to combination (4, 3)
is as shown in Figure 1.

**Fig. 1**. **An example of PDCCH monitoring using Rel-16 span based PDCCH
monitoring capability.**
[Sub-slot based HARQ-ACK feedback]{.underline}
Sub-slot based HARQ-ACK feedback is introduced to support more than one PUCCH
for HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot, which is mainly beneficial for
achieving low latency. An UL slot consists of a number of sub-slots. No more
than one PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACKs starts in a sub-slot. A UE can indicate the
supported sub-slot configuration among the candidate values of {7-symbol*2,
2-symbol*7 and 7-symbol*2} for normal CP or { 6-symbol*2, 2-symbol*6 and
6-symbol*2} for extended CP.
[Two HARQ-ACK codebooks constructed simultaneously]{.underline}
This work item specifies the support of two HARQ-ACK codebooks with different
priorities to be simultaneously constructed, which is mainly beneficial for
improving reliability for service with higher priority. Each of the two HARQ-
ACK codebooks can be either slot-based HARQ-ACK codebook or sub-slot-based
HARQ-ACK codebook. Separate PUCCH configurations are supported for different
HARQ-ACK codebooks. The feature supports two priority levels for HARQ-ACK.
Rules are defined for the UE to resolve collisions between UL channels/signals
with different priorities.
[PUSCH enhancements]{.underline}
This work item specifies PUSCH repetition type B and PUSCH repetition type A
for PUSCH enhancements. PUSCH repetition type B is mainly beneficial for
achieving low latency. PUSCH repetition type A can improve the spectral
efficiency.
For PUSCH repetition type B, for a transport block, one dynamic UL grant or
one configured grant schedules two or more PUSCH repetitions that can be in
one slot, or across a slot boundary in consecutive available slots. Examples
of PUSCH repetition type B are given in Figure 2. Inter-slot frequency hopping
and inter-repetition frequency hopping are specified for PUSCH repetition type
B. Interaction with DL/UL directions is specified as in Clause 6 in [6].
{width="4.441558398950131in" height="2.042726377952756in"}
**Fig. 2**. **Examples of PUSCH repetition type B.**
PUSCH repetition type A corresponds to PUSCH transmission with Rel-15 behavior
with or without slot aggregation. With slot aggregation, the number of
repetitions can be dynamically indicated in Rel-16.
[Enhanced inter UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing]{.underline}
This work item specifies UL cancellation scheme and enhanced UL power control
scheme for enhanced inter UE Tx prioritization/multiplexing, which are mainly
beneficial for achieving low latency.
For UL cancellation scheme, DCI format 2_4 is introduced for notifying the
PRB(s) and OFDM symbol(s) where UE cancels the corresponding UL transmission
from the UE. An indication by DCI format 2_4 for a serving cell is applicable
to a PUSCH transmission or an SRS transmission on the serving cell.
For UL power control scheme, open-loop power control parameter set indication
is included in DCI format 0_1/0_2 to indicate the P0 value for PUSCH scheduled
dynamically as defined in [5].
[Multiple active configured grant configurations for a BWP]{.underline}
Up to 12 configured grant configurations can be configured in a BWP of a
serving cell, which is mainly beneficial for achieving high reliability.
Separate RRC parameters can be configured for different configured grant
configurations. Separate activation/release can be used for different
configured grant Type 2 configurations. In addition, joint release for two or
more configured grant Type 2 configurations for a given BWP of a serving cell
is also supported.

This Work Item evolves the NR system as to better support the use cases of
various vertical markets such as factory automation or electrical power
distribution. It introduces transmission reliability enhancements, NR support
for Time Sensitive Communications (as defined in TS 23.501 [4]), and addressed
efficiency of the system where UEs handle a mixture of URLLC and eMBB traffic.
This WI focused mainly on Layer 2/3 protocols aspects while PHY layer
enhancements for URLLC were introduced as part of Work Item on Physical layer
enhancements for NR ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC) [3].
This Work Item has introduced the following enhancements:
1\. PDCP packet duplication enhancements -- a possibility of multiplication of
the packets related to signalling or data radio bearer over three or four
logical channels has been specified for the increased reliability of the
transmission over the air interface. This is possible for both Carrier
Aggregation based packet duplication where the packet is sent over up to four
different serving cells of a single gNB and for Dual Connectivity based packet
duplication where the packet is sent over serving cells belonging to two
different gNBs (e.g. two serving cells in Master Node and two serving cells in
Secondary Node or three serving cells in Master Node and one serving cell in
Secondary Node etc.). The network dynamically controls which of the configured
logical channels are active for duplication at a certain time by utilizing a
dedicated MAC CE command.
2\. RAN support for higher layer multi-connectivity - The feature introduces
also higher reliability for the end to end transmission by using duplication
of a PDU session. This functionality allows NG-RAN to ensure the data of the
PDU session and its redundant one to utilize two independent transmission
paths. The NG-RAN may, for example, use dual connectivity principles with one
PDU session delivered through the master node and the redundant one via the
secondary node, or the NG-RAN may use independent paths within the same NG-RAN
node. Besides, the feature offers the possibility to provide redundancy over
N3 tunnel between the UPF and the NG-RAN node on a per QoS flow basis.
3\. Support for accurate reference timing delivery -- to support strict
synchronization accuracy requirements of TSC applications, the delivery of
time reference information from the gNB to the UE using unicast or broadcast
RRC signalling with a granularity of 10 ns was introduced. UE Assistance
Information procedure was extended to allow the UE to indicate its preference
to receive such information.
4\. Scheduling enhancements -- support for up to eight simultaneously active
semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) configurations for a given BWP of a UE was
specified. Work Item introduced also new logical channel restriction based on
physical layer priority level of the grant and a list of Configured Grant (CG)
configurations allowed to be utilized by a certain logical channel (support of
up to twelve simultaneously active CG configurations in a BWP of a UE was
introduced as part of WI on Physical Layer Enhancements for NR Ultra-Reliable
and Low Latency Communication (URLLC) [3]). UE can now be configured with CG
and SPS periodicities of any integer multiple of a slot with maximum
periodicity of 640 ms. These enhancements allow, e.g., to more efficiently
support, deterministic traffic with a wide range of different periodicities.
5\. Time Sensitive Communication Assistance Information (TSCAI): Core Network
may provide a gNB with an information about TSC traffic characteristics such
as Burst Arrival Time, traffic flow direction and periodicity, to allow for a
more efficient scheduling at the gNB.
6\. Ethernet Header Compression (EHC): since TSC traffic is often carried over
Ethernet frames with a short size (e.g. 20-50 bytes), EHC protocol was
specified within PDCP sublayer to increase efficiency of Ethernet frames
transmission over the NR air interface. EHC allows to avoid transmission of
Ethernet header fields such as DESTINATION ADDRESS, SOURCE ADDRESS, 802.1Q
TAG, and LENGTH/TYPE, between the gNB and the UE. EHC was specified for both
NR and EUTRA PDCP.
7\. Prioritization between overlapping uplink resources of one UE: when
multiple UL grants provided to a single UE overlap in time on a serving cell,
the UE is now able to consider the priority of the grant and/or the priority
of the logical channel that can be carried over the grant when making a
decision about which grant to utilize. Similarly, the UE may consider the
priority of a scheduling request (SR) as well as priority of the logical
channel which triggered the SR when deciding whether to transmit PUSCH or SR
when they overlap in time. Furthermore, if two PUCCHs of different PHY
priorities or a PUCCH and a PUSCH of different PHY priorities are overlapping
in time on a serving cell, the UE is able to cancel the lower priority
transmission with the specified cancellation behaviour and related timeline to
allow for transmission of the PUSCH or PUCCH of higher PHY priority.
Thanks to the introduced enhancements it is possible to support Industrial IOT
applications and Time Sensitive Communications in a more efficient way, allow
for extra reliability for URLLC traffic as well optimize handling of a mixture
of applications with various priorities and QoS requirements by a single UE.

Summary based on the input provided by KPN in SP-200XYZ.
5G expands the scope and reach of 3GPP-defined technologies. There are
multiple market segments in the realm of residential, office, enterprise and
factory, where 5G will need to provide services with similar functionalities
to Local Area Networks (LANs) but improved with 5G capabilities (e.g., high
performance, long distance access, mobility and security).
The main goal of this work is to enable the 5G system to offer 5G LAN-type
services and virtual networks:
5G LAN-type service: a service over the 5G system offering private
communication using IP and/or non-, i.e. UEs that are members of the same 5G
LAN-VN IP type communications.
5G LAN-virtual network: a virtual network capable of supporting 5G LAN-type
service.
The requirements needed for the 5G system to support 5G LAN-type services are
document in chapter 6.26 in TS 22.261[1], where the following aspects are
addressed:
> â€¢ General service requirements to enable 5G LAN-type services (connections,
> support for IP and Ethernet, service continuity, discovery, ...)
>
> â€¢ 5G LAN-virtual network
>
> â€¢ Creation and management
>
> â€¢ Security, isolation and privacy
>
> â€¢ Traffic types
>
> â€¢ Indirect communication for 5G LAN-type service
>
> â€¢ Service exposure for 5G LAN-type service
The corresponding Stage 2 is covered by the Vertical_LAN, described in the
next section (Vertical_LAN includes requirements specified in 5GLAN and other
requirements from cyberCAV, such as IEEE TSN).

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell in
SP-200296.
The Vertical_LAN work item introduces support for three new and distinct
features:
1) Enablers for 5G System deployment in 5G LAN type environment.
2) Time-sensitive communication with enablers for 5GS to seamlessly integrate
with IEEE TSN, and for 5GS to enable support of time synchronization.
3) Enablers for Standalone Non-Public Network and Public-Network-integrated
Non-Public Network.
[5G_LAN]{.underline}
The 5G System supports management of 5G VN Group identification and membership
as well as 5G VN Group data. The 5G VN Group management can be configured by a
network administrator or it can be managed dynamically by an AF. In order to
support dynamic management of 5G VN Group identification and membership, the
NEF exposes a set of services to manage (e.g. add/delete/modify) 5G VN group
and 5G VN members. The NEF also exposes services to dynamically manage 5G VN
group data. Furthermore, 5GS supports optimized routing by enabling support
for local switching at the UPF without having to traverse the DN for UE-UE
communication when the two UE(s) are served by the same UPF.
[Integration with IEEE TSN]{.underline}
TSC is a communication service that supports deterministic and/or isochronous
communication with high reliability and availability. It provides packet
transport with Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics such as bounded
latency and reliability, where end systems and relay/transmit nodes can be
strictly synchronized. In Release 16, main focus was on integration with IEEE
Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).
The 5G System also enables support for TSN time synchronization. In order to
support time synchronization, the entire E2E 5G system can be considered as an
IEEE 802.1AS [104] \"time-aware system\". UE, gNB, UPF, NW-TT and DS- TTs are
synchronized with the 5G GM (i.e. the 5G internal system clock), which keeps
these network elements synchronized. The TTs located at the edge of 5G system
provides all functions related to IEEE 802.1AS.
Furthermore, this feature has also introduced TSC assistance parameters were
introduced to facilitate optimized QoS scheduling for time sensitive and
deterministic traffic.
[Non-Public Network]{.underline}
This work item also addressed the deployment of Non-Public Networks (NPNs). A
Non-Public Network (NPN) is a 5GS deployed for non-public use, as defined in
TS 22.261 [2]. An NPN may be deployed as:
\- a Stand-alone Non-Public Network (SNPN), i.e. operated by an NPN operator
and not relying on network functions provided by a PLMN, or
\- a Public network integrated NPN, i.e. a non-public network deployed with
the support of a PLMN.
SNPN 5GS deployments are based on the architecture depicted in clause 4.2.3,
the architecture for 5GC with untrusted non-3GPP access (Figure 4.2.8.2.1-1)
for access to SNPN services via a PLMN (and vice versa) and the additional
functionality covered in clause 5.30.2.

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in SP-200274.
Substantial E-UTRAN/EPC evolution has been achieved in 3GPP to enable the
\"Cellular Internet of Things\" (CIoT). In particular, eMTC (WB-E-UTRAN) and
NB-IoT have been designed in RAN WGs in Rel-13 and enhanced in Rel-14. The
corresponding system architecture aspects have been designed for EPC in Rel-13
and Rel-14. These system architecture aspects apply to both NB-IoT and eMTC
(WB-E-UTRAN).
The \"Cellular IoT support and evolution for the 5G System\" work item focused
on enabling equivalent functionality for NB-IoT and eMTC connected to 5GC as
what has been defined for NB-IoT and eMTC connected to EPC in earlier releases
This section summarizes the key system impacts resulting from the "Cellular
IoT support and evolution for the 5G System" work item.
As documented in TS 23.501 [1] clause 5.31, the following CIoT features have
been introduced in Rel-16:
**\- Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation** (CP CIoT 5GS Optimisation) is used
to exchange user data between the UE and the SMF as payload of a NAS message
in both uplink and downlink directions, avoiding the establishment of a user
plane connection for the PDU Session (i.e. avoiding the need for Data Radio
Bearer and N3 tunnel). Early Data Transmission (EDT), i.e. sending user data
in RRC Message 3 is supported for mobile originated Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation.
**\- User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation** (UP CIoT 5GS Optimisation) supports
transfer of user plane data from CM-IDLE without the need for using the
Service Request procedure to establish an Access Stratum (AS) context in NG-
RAN and UE. UP CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled by the Connection Suspend and
Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with Suspend procedures. EDT is also supported
for UP CIoT 5GS Optimisation.
\- UE and network negotiate whether to use CP CIoT 5GS Optimisation and/or UP
CIoT 5GS Optimisation as well as N3 data transport and header compression for
CP CIoT 5GS Optimisation during the Registration procedure. The UE indicates
its **Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour** , i.e. the UE indicates
which of the aforementioned features the UE supports and whether it prefers to
use CP CIoT 5GS Optimisation or UP CIoT 5GS Optimisation. In response, the
network indicates which of those features it supports for this UE.
**\- Non-IP Data Delivery** (NIDD) refers to mobile originated (MO) and mobile
terminated (MT) communication between UE and an Application Function (AF)
where the user data is considered unstructured (also referred to as \"non-
IP\"). NIDD is enabled using an unstructured PDU session between UE and NEF
and the NEF\'s NIDD API on the N33/Nnef reference point for data delivery
from/to AF. Alternatively, non-IP data is delivered using an unstructured PDU
session between UE and UPF and a Point-to-Point N6 tunnel between UPF and AF.
The NEF also supports distribution of mobile terminated messages to a group of
UEs based on the NIDD API.
**\- Reliable Data Service** (RDS) may be used between UE and NEF or UPF,
respectively, for unstructured PDU Sessions. RDS provides a mechanism for the
NEF or UPF to determine if the user data was successfully delivered to the UE
and for the UE to determine if the data was successfully delivered to the NEF
or UPF. When a requested acknowledgement is not received, RDS retransmits the
packet.
**\- Extended Discontinuous Reception (DRX) for CM-IDLE and CM-CONNECTED with
RRC-INACTIVE** enables the UE to reduce its power consumption while still
being available for MT data and/or network originated procedures within a
certain delay dependent on the negotiated DRX cycle value. In CM-IDLE state
the following DRX cycles are supported: up to almost 44 minutes (for eMTC) and
up to almost 3 hours (for NB-IoT). In CM-CONNECTED with RRC-INACTIVE, DRX
cycles of up to 10.24 seconds are supported.
\- Enhancements for the Mobile Initiated Connection Only (**MICO**) mode of
rel.15:
\- MICO mode with Extended Connected Time enables an AMF that is aware of
pending or expected MT traffic to keep the UE in CM-CONNECTED state and to
request the RAN to keep the UE in RRC-CONNECTED state for an Extended
Connected Time period to ensure that the downlink data and/or signalling is
delivered to the UE before the UE is released.
\- MICO mode with Active Time is similar to the UE Power Saving Mode (PSM)
defined for EPS [2], i.e. UE and AMF negotiate an Active Time value, which
dictates for how long the UE is reachable for paging upon entering CM-IDLE.
Once the Active Time has elapsed, the UE can enter MICO mode, i.e. become
unreachable for paging.
\- MICO mode and Periodic Registration Timer Control enables the network to
align a UE\'s Periodic Registration Updates with an expected DL communication
schedule for the UE. This is achieved by the Strictly Periodic Registration
Timer Indication which the network can provide to the UE to avoid that the
Periodic Registration Timer is restarted by the UE when the UE enters CM-
CONNECTED.
\- **High latency communication** refers to mechanisms that may be used to
handle mobile terminated (MT) communication with UEs being unreachable while
using power saving functions (e.g. extended DRX or MICO mode with Active or
Extended Connected Time). High latency communication is supported by extended
buffering of downlink data in the UPF, SMF or NEF when a UE is using power
saving functions in CM-IDLE and is not reachable. Alternatively, high latency
communication is supported through different AF notifications. An AF may for
example subscribe to receive UE reachability notifications so that the AF then
waits with sending the data until it gets a notification that the UE has
become reachable.
\- **Support for Monitoring Events** enables AFs to acquire information such
as whether a UE is roaming or to determine when a USIM is changed to a
different ME. The complete list of monitoring events is documented in TS
23.502 [3] clause 4.15.3.1.
\- **External parameter provisioning** refers to functionality originally
defined in Rel-15 already, which enables an AF to provision information such
as Expected UE Behaviour parameters or other service parameters to the network
(see TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.15.6.1). In Rel-16, additional Expected UE
Behaviour parameters were introduced (e.g. an indication whether the UE is
stationary or mobile), which can be used by the AMF and/or SMF for various
purposes, e.g. by AMF for paging optimisations. In addition, an AF can provide
Network Configuration parameters (e.g. Maximum Response Time) to the network,
which in turn can be used to derive parameters for system procedures (e.g. to
derive the Active Time or Extended Connected time for MICO mode). The complete
list of Expected UE Behaviour parameters and Network Configuration parameters
are documented in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.15.6.3 and 4.15.6.3a, respectively.
\- **PDU session handling during inter-RAT idle mode mobility to and from NB-
IoT** allows the SMF to maintain a PDU session, disconnect a PDU session with
a reactivation request or to disconnect a PDU session without reactivation
request when the UE moves between a \"broadband\" RAT (e.g. NR or WB-E-UTRAN)
and a \"narrowband\" RAT (NB-IoT).
\- **System aspects of the Enhanced Coverage RAN feature** as specified in TS
36.300 [4], in particular storage of Paging Assistance Data for UEs supporting
Enhanced Coverage and providing of Paging Assistance Data to RAN during paging
has been introduced. Specific subscribers can also be restricted to use the
Enhanced Coverage feature through Enhanced Coverage Restricted information
that is stored in the UDM. Based on the latter, AMF informs UE, RAN and SMF
about the use (or not) of the Enhanced Coverage feature.
\- The **rate of user data** sent to and from a UE can be controlled in two
ways:
\- Serving PLMN rate control allows the serving network to protect its AMF and
the Signalling Radio Bearers in the NG-RAN from the load generated by NAS Data
PDUs by indicating a limit for the number of NAS Data PDUs per time unit to
the UE and UPF/NEF.
\- Small Data Rate Control allows HPLMN operators to offer customer services
such as \"maximum of Y messages per day\" and is also based on indicating a
number of packets per time unit limitation to UE and UPF/NEF for enforcement.
\- **Congestion control for control plane data transfer** enables the AMF to
restrict, e.g. during high-load situations, the use of the control plane for
data transmission (i.e. for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation). In
particular, AMF may provide a Control Plane data back-off timer to the UE.
While the Control Plane data back-off timer is running, the UE is not allowed
to initiate any data transfer via Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation.
\- **Service Gap Control** can be used to control the frequency at which UEs
can access the network, e.g. to alleviate peak load situations. Service Gap
control is realized by AMF indicating a Service Gap Time to a UE; the UE then
stays in CM-IDLE mode for at least the whole duration of the Service Gap timer
before triggering Mobile Originated user data transmission.
\- **Inter-UE QoS for NB-IoT** targets UEs that are using Control Plane CIoT
5GS Optimisation and are accessing the network via NB-IoT. The feature allows
NG-RAN to prioritise resource allocation between those UEs based on the
subscribed NB-IoT UE Priority that NG-RAN may retrieve from the AMF.
\- **Differentiation of Category M UEs** enables the network to identify
traffic to/from Category M UEs, e.g. for charging differentiation and
subscription based access control. This functionality is based on a Category M
indication from UE to NG-RAN during RRC Connection Establishment and
subsequently, an LTE-M Indication to the AMF in the Initial UE Message. Based
on this, AMF considers the RAT type to be LTE-M and informs SMF, SMSF and PCF
accordingly for subsequent use of the LTE-M RAT type, e.g. in CDRs. A
subscription parameter for subscription based access restriction for LTE-M is
also introduced.
\- **Selection, steering and redirection between EPS and 5GS** allows a
network that supports CIoT features in both EPC and 5GC to steer UEs from the
CN type that the UE is attempting to register with to the other CN type (e.g.
from 5GC to EPC) due to operator policy, e.g., due to roaming agreements,
Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour, load redistribution, etc. It is
assumed that operators configure the steering policies in EPC and 5GC such
that steering UEs back and forth between EPC and 5GC is avoided.

Summary based on the input provided by FUTUREWEI in RP-201229.
This Feature builds on the successful base NB-IoT feature in Rel-13, and
enhancements in Rel-14 and Rel-15, and adds features such as DL/UL
transmission efficiency improvement, UE power consumption improvement,
scheduling enhancement, network management tool enhancement, latency
improvement, enhancement on coexistence with NR and connection to 5GC.
[Improved DL transmission efficiency and UE power consumption]{.underline}
Reduced UE power consumption and improved transmission efficiency are achieved
through reduced downlink monitoring and reduced signalling, building on
features introduced in earlier releases.
UE-group wake-up signals (GWUS) (FDD):
With the introduction of Rel-15 wake-up signalling (WUS), UE can skip the
paging procedures if the wake-up signal is not detected to save power. This
feature (UE-group WUS) allows eNB to transmit a UE-group WUS to instruct the
UEs in the group that they must monitor NPDCCH for paging. This allows the UE
to skip the paging procedures to save more power if eNB sends UE-group WUS to
UEs in other groups. The UEs are grouped according to their paging probability
and/or their UE ID based on system information configuration.
Mobile-terminated early data transmission (MT-EDT) (FDD):
Rel-15 Mobile Originating Early Data Transmission (MO-EDT) allows one uplink
data transmission optionally followed by one downlink data transmission during
the random access procedure, avoiding transition to RRC_CONNECTED mode. Rel-16
Mobile Terminating Early Data Transmission (MT-EDT) allows one downlink data
transmission during the random access procedure triggered in response to a
paging message. This feature allows the eNB to decide whether to initiate
Mobile Terminated EDT procedures towards the UE based on the data size
received from the core network. Mobile Terminating Early Data Transmission
(MT-EDT) is only supported in EPC.
[Support for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode
(FDD)]{.underline}
In Rel-15, signalling overhead and power consumption reductions were
introduced by the (mobile-originated) early data transmission (EDT) feature,
where data can be transmitted already in Msg3 during the random-access
procedure.
In Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further
enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources
(PUR). This feature allows eNB to configure uplink resources, in which a UE in
IDLE mode can send UL transmission without performing random access
procedures. The UE can be potentially configured with a cyclic shift of DMRS,
which allows sharing of the preconfigured resources under which up to two
users can transmit NPUSCH simultaneously when the NPUSCH transmission is
larger than or equal to 64ms for 12-tone allocation. By skipping the random
access procedures, the uplink transmission efficiency can be improved and UE
power consumption is reduced. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE
must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either
individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving
cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change. Additionally, it is possible to
configure the TA as always valid within a given cell.
[Scheduling of multiple DL/UL transport blocks with single DCI
(FDD)]{.underline}
This feature allows the scheduling of up to two transport blocks (TB) with a
single DCI for uplink or downlink unicast transmission, where the number of
TBs is indicated by DCI. The transmission of multiple TBs can be configured to
be contiguous or interleaved. And HARQ bundling can be potentially configured
when transmission is configured as interleaved. It also allows the scheduling
of up to eight transport blocks with a single DCI for SC-MTCH, where the
number of TBs is indicated by DCI. The DCI overhead can be reduced for
contiguous UL/DL transmissions.
[Network management tool enhancements - SON (FDD and TDD)]{.underline}
Rel-16 introduces SON features: RACH report, RLF report and ANR for network
resource optimisation. The ANR measurements are performed when the UE is in
RRC_IDLE and reported next time the UE enters RRC_CONNECTED. The NPRACH
configuration of the NB-IoT Cells are exchanged between neighbour eNBs for
RACH optimization. And the RLF report from UE is forwarded to the old eNB to
determine the nature of the failure.
SON features are only supported in EPC.
[Improved multicarrier operations - Quality report in Msg3 and connected mode
(FDD)]{.underline}
In cells with interference, the coverage level corresponding to the estimate
RSRP may be mismatched with the channel quality. This feature allows the eNB
to configure a UE in IDLE mode to report the downlink channel quality in Msg3
for non-anchor access. It also allows the UE to report the downlink channel
quality in connected mode other than Msg3 for anchor and non-anchor carriers.
This allows the eNB to schedule NPDCCH and NPDSCH more accurately, especially
in cases with mismatch between coverage level and channel quality.
Presence of NRS on a non-anchor carrier for paging (FDD)
This feature allows eNB to transmit NRS in subframes on a non-anchor carrier
for paging even when no paging NPDCCH is transmitted. The NRS are present in
the first M subframes out of the 10 NB-IoT DL subframes before the Paging
Occasion (PO), where the PO can be a subset of POs or a whole set of POs, and
the values of M depend on the value of nB as defined in TS 36.304.
When NRS is present on a non-anchor paging carrier and the conditions for
NRSRP measurement on non-anchor carrier are met as defined in TS 36.133, the
UE may perform serving cell measurements on the non-anchor paging carrier.
[Mobility enhancements - Idle mode inter-RAT cell selection to/from NB-IoT
(FDD and TDD)]{.underline}
With this feature, NB-IoT can provide assistance information for inter-RAT
cell selection to E-UTRAN/GERAN and E-UTRAN can provide assistance information
for inter-RAT cell selection to NB-IoT. A UE may use the assistance
information provided by the network for cell selection to/from NB-IoT.
[Improved latency - UE Specific DRX (FDD and TDD)]{.underline}
Rel-16 introduces support for UE specific DRX to reduce paging latency. The
eNB may broadcast a minimum UE specific DRX value shorter than the cell
default DRX value. When UE specific DRX is configured by the upper layers and
the minimum UE specific DRX value is broadcast, the UE monitors paging
according to the longer of the two values.
[Coexistence of NB-IoT with NR (FDD and TDD)]{.underline}
This feature allows the configuration of the DL/UL resource reservation in
subframe/slot/symbol-levels on non-anchor carriers for unicast transmission to
avoid resource overlapping with NR channels/signals. The configuration can be
for 10ms or 40ms duration, with a periodicity from {10ms, 20ms, 40ms, 80ms,
160ms} and a start position in a granularity of 10ms, which is independent
from legacy configurations. It also allows dynamic indication whether the
resource reservation is applied or not.
Three system scenarios have been studied and captured in TR 37.824:
â€¢ For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, RB alignment, power boosting and
numerologies have been addressed.
â€¢ For NB-IoT operation in NR guard band, RF requirements will not be
specified.
â€¢ For NB-IoT standalone operation, based on coexistence study, it is concluded
that there is no issue for NB-IoT standalone coexistence with NR.
[Connection to 5GC (FDD and TDD)]{.underline}
Rel-16 introduces support for connection to 5GC reusing eLTE as a baseline,
including Unified Access Control (UAC). RRC_INACTIVE, NR SDAP and NR PDCP are
not supported and a maximum of two PDU sessions mapped to two default DRBs is
supported.
Rel-16 also introduces support for the CIoT 5GS optimisation, in particular
extended DRX (eDRX) in RRC_IDLE, control plane and user plane CIoT
optimisation, MO-EDT for the control plane and user plane CIoT optimisation,
RRC Connection Reestablishment for the control plane and restriction of use of
Enhanced Coverage.
Similar backhaul signalling to support control plane and user plane CIoT
optimisation are introduced over NG interface (between ng-eNB and AMF) and
over Xn interface (between ng-eNBs), including e.g. early UE radio capability
retrieval from core network after msg3, NB-IoT CP relocation procedures to
support connection reestablishment, Paging assistance information exchanging,
UE differentiation information exchanging, etc.

800183 **Core part: Additional MTC enhancements for LTE** LTE_eMTC5-Core R1
RP-190770 Ericsson 800283 **Perf. part: Additional MTC enhancements for LTE**
LTE_eMTC5-Perf R4 RP-190770 Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-201276.
This work item builds on the LTE features for Machine-Type Communications
(MTC) introduced in earlier releases (e.g. low-complexity UE categories M1 and
M2, and Coverage Enhancement Modes A and B) by further improving network
operation and efficiency in a range of areas.
The following sections describe the new MTC features for LTE in Rel-16. All
features are optional for the UE and can be supported by Cat-M1 and Cat-M2 and
by normal LTE UEs supporting CE mode unless otherwise stated. All features are
applicable to both CE modes (A and B) in all duplex modes (HD-FDD, FD-FDD, and
TDD) unless otherwise stated.
[Improved DL transmission efficiency and UE power consumption]{.underline}
Reduced UE power consumption is achieved through reduced downlink monitoring
and reduced signalling, building on features introduced in earlier releases.
â€¢ UE-group wake-up signals (GWUS): Reduced UE power consumption in idle mode
was enabled in Rel-15 by the introduction of the wake-up signal (WUS), a
compact signal transmitted a configurable time before the paging occasion (PO)
when a UE is being paged, allowing the UE to maximize its sleep time during
periods when there is no paging. In Rel-16, an enhancement is introduced that
allows a WUS to wake up a configurable group of UEs rather than all UEs that
happen to monitor the same PO. This helps reduce the power consumption even
further. The mapping of GWUS in the time and frequency domains is highly
configurable.
â€¢ Mobile-terminated early data transmission (MT-EDT): For scenarios where the
UE only needs to transmit a small amount of data, the early data transmission
(EDT) feature in Rel-15 enables the UE to transmit up to (slightly more than)
100 bytes of data already in Msg3 during the random-access procedure, and to
receive data already in Msg4. If needed, eNB can order fallback to legacy
random-access procedure during the EDT procedure. In Rel-16, an enhancement is
introduced that allows not only mobile-originated (MO) EDT access but also
mobile-terminated (MT) EDT. When the MME triggers MT-EDT, an indication is
included in the paging message, after which the UE triggers random access to
resume the connection (in case the UP CIoT EPS optimization is used) or
initiate MO-EDT (in case the CP CIoT EPS optimization is used). MT traffic is
received in Msg4. MT-EDT is only supported when UE is connected to EPC (not
5GC).
â€¢ Improved DL quality reporting: Legacy CE mode A supports both periodic and
aperiodic CSI reporting which can be used to assist PDSCH link adaptation. In
Rel-16, a new type of DL quality reporting is introduced which reflects MPDCCH
quality rather than PDSCH quality. The report represents the required number
of MPDCCH subframe repetitions for reliable MPDCCH reception. It can be sent
in connected mode, but it can also be sent already in Msg3 during the random
access procedure, which means that the report can be used for guiding the UE-
specific MPDCCH configuration, which helps optimize power consumption,
latency, and spectral efficiency.
â€¢ MPDCCH performance improvement: In legacy LTE-MTC, MPDCCH demodulation is
DMRS-based. With this feature, the UE can use a combination of DMRS and CRS
for MPDCCH demodulation to improve the MPDCCH performance. The feature takes
the configured DMRS-to-CRS power ratio into account. The feature can be used
for transmissions in idle mode and/or connected mode. In idle mode, the DMRS-
to-CRS mapping is based on precoder cycling, whereas in connected mode, it can
be configured to be precoder cycling based, CSI-based, or (in case of TDD)
reciprocity-based.
Beside the features listed above, the features described in sections 2.2, 2.3
and 2.6 can also improve UE power consumption and/or transmission efficiency
in DL and/or UL.
[Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR)]{.underline}
In Rel-15, signalling overhead and power consumption reductions were
introduced by the (mobile-originated) early data transmission (EDT) feature,
where data can be transmitted already in Msg3 during the random-access
procedure.
In Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further
enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources
(PUR). When the feature is configured, both the random-access preamble
transmission (Msg1) and the random-access response (Msg2) can be omitted, and
the data transmission can be completed in only two messages (i.e., Msg3 and
Msg4).
The UE is configured with PUR via dedicated RRC signaling while in connected
mode. Configuring a UE with PUR can be triggered by the network or requested
by the UE. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the
validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined
usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer,
c) RSRP change. Additionally, it is possible to configure the TA as always
valid within a given cell.
There are two schemes for transmitting using PUR, dedicated PUR and shared
PUR, the latter allows up to two users to transmit simultaneously when the
number of PUSCH repetitions is greater than or equal to 64 for full-PRB
allocation.
[Scheduling of multiple transport blocks]{.underline}
In legacy LTE-MTC operation, each DCI carried by MPDCCH schedules a single
PDSCH or PUSCH transport block (TB). In Rel-16, a possibility to schedule
multiple TBs using a single is introduced. This can help improve the resource
utilization by reducing the number of physical resource blocks (PRBs) spent on
MPDCCH transmission and the number of subframes spent on guard time for DL-to-
UL and UL-to-DL transition (in half-duplex FDD operation).
â€¢ Unicast multi-TB scheduling: When the feature is configured, a single DCI
can schedule multi TBs for PDSCH or PUSCH (up to 8 TBs in CE mode A, or up to
4 TBs in CE mode B). The number of TBs is dynamically controlled by the DCI.
The TBs can be configured to be transmitted consecutively or subframe
interleaved (in case of subframe repetition). For PDSCH multi-TB scheduling,
HARQ-ACK bundling can optionally be used to improve the resource utilization
further for UEs in good coverage. For PUSCH multi-TB scheduling, early
termination of the PUSCH transmission is supported through indication of
positive HARQ-ACK in the DCI.
â€¢ Multicast multi-TB scheduling: When the feature is configured a single DCI
can schedule up to 8 TBs for PDSCH for a SC-MTCH, with configurable time gaps
between the TBs if desired. The number of TBs is dynamically controlled by the
DCI.
[CE mode improvements for non-Cat-M UEs]{.underline}
The features in this work item can be supported both by Cat-M UEs and non-
Cat-M UEs that support CE mode A or B. In addition, the following features
have been specified specifically for non-Cat-M UEs that support CE mode A or
B.
â€¢ Enhancements to idle mode mobility: A possibility is introduced for a non-
Cat-M UE in a non-standalone LTE-MTC cell to use enhanced coverage
functionality to camp in the cell even if the S-criterion indicates that the
UE is in normal coverage. This functionality is enabled/disabled by a
configuration provided in SIB1. (This is the default behavior for the
standalone LTE-MTC case described in the next section in this document.)
â€¢ CSI feedback based on CSI-RS: In legacy CE mode A, periodic and aperiodic
CSI feedback is based on up to 4 CRS antenna ports. This feature introduces
support for periodic CSI feedback based on 8 CSI-RS antenna ports in TM9 for
non-Cat-M UEs in CE mode A. The feature can help improve the DL link
adaptation and hence the DL performance. As a separate UE capability, the
feature can also optionally be supported in combination with codebook subset
restriction.
â€¢ ETWS/CMAS in connected mode: In legacy LTE-MTC, ETWS/CMAS notification
indication is supported using DCI format 6-2 in MPDCCH common search space
Type-1 in idle mode. This feature introduces ETWS/CMAS notification indication
using DCI format 6-1A/B in MPDCCH common search space Type-0 in connected mode
for non-Cat-M UEs in CE mode A/B. This means that a UE can be notified without
releasing the UE to idle mode.
[Stand-alone deployment]{.underline}
In legacy LTE-MTC operation, the first few OFDM symbols in each DL subframe
are unused by LTE-MTC since they are assumed to be occupied by LTE control
channels for normal LTE UEs (PCFICH, PDCCH, PHICH). This feature enables
transmission of MPDCCH and/or PDSCH to UEs in CE mode A/B in the "LTE control
channel region" on carriers that are not used for normal LTE. The feature can
be used for transmissions in idle mode and/or connected mode. The potential DL
transmission efficiency gain is about 14% (corresponding to 2 out of 14 OFDM
symbols) for 1.4 MHz carriers and about 7% (corresponding to 1 out of 14 OFDM
symbols) for wider carriers.
[Mobility enhancements]{.underline}
In Rel-15, two new LTE-MTC signals were introduced, the resynchronization
signal (RSS) and the wake-up signal (WUS), and in Rel-16 the following
mobility enhancements are introduced which make use of the Rel-15 signals.
â€¢ RSS-based measurements: In Rel-15, support for a resynchronization signal
(RSS) was introduced and its configuration is provided by the serving cell. In
Rel-16, signaling of RSS configurations for neighbor cells is introduced. Both
broadcasted and dedicated signaling can be used to provide the configurations.
The primary purpose of RSS is to improved synchronization performance, but
with the Rel-16 signaling, the UE may also use RSS for improved measurement
performance for intra-frequency RSRP measurements for neighbor cells in both
idle and connected mode.
â€¢ RRM measurement relaxation: The legacy LTE-MTC UE behavior requires the UE
to measure on the serving cell and evaluate the cell selection criterion at
least every DRX cycle. The wake-up signal (WUS) introduced in Rel-15 would
allow the UE to sleep for multiple paging cycles and wake up to receive paging
after a configurable time duration, but the UE power saving gain from WUS
cannot be fully utilized since the UE is still required to wake up for
measurements. Therefore, an RRM measurement relaxation is introduced in
Rel-16, which allows the UE meet the requirements using a longer measurement
cycle to save power, where the cycle is configurable under certain conditions.
[Performance improvement for NR coexistence]{.underline}
Spectrum sharing with legacy (Rel-13/14/15) LTE-MTC is already supported in
Rel-15 NR, and the RF coexistence aspects described in TR 37.823. The
following features are introduced in Rel-16 LTE-MTC in order to further
improve the performance of the coexistence with NR.
â€¢ DL/UL resource reservation: Legacy LTE-MTC supports configuration of invalid
DL/UL subframes, which can be used in order to avoid mapping LTE-MTC
transmissions to subframes that are needed for NR transmissions. Rel-16 takes
a step further by introducing finer-granularity LTE-MTC resource reservation
in both the time domain (with subframe, slot, or symbol level granularity) and
the frequency domain (with LTE RBG level granularity) for unicast
MPDCCH/PDSCH/PUSCH/PUCCH transmissions in connected mode in CE mode A/B. The
resource reservation patterns are configurable using parameter combinations
based on bitmaps, periodicities and offsets. For PDSCH/PUSCH, the DCI can
indicate that the resource reservation should be overridden, in which case the
PDSCH/PUSCH transmission becomes continuous.
â€¢ DL subcarrier puncturing: In order to achieve PRB alignment between LTE-MTC
and NR, a possibility to puncture 1 or 2 DL subcarriers at the lower or higher
edge of each 6-PRB narrowband is introduced. The puncturing affects
MPDCCH/PDSCH transmissions in connected mode in CE mode A/B. The performance
loss from the puncturing should typically be insignificant.
[Connection to 5GC]{.underline}
In Rel-16, support for connecting LTE-MTC UEs to 5GC is introduced. It
resembles the Rel-15 functionality for connecting LTE UEs to 5GC. The
RRC_INACTIVE state is supported and additionally the User Plane CIoT 5GS
optimisation is supported in RRC_IDLE (similar to the corresponding EPC
feature). Some features, such as EDT and PUR are supported only in RRC_IDLE
using the UP-optimisation solution and are not supported in RRC_INACTIVE. Long
extended DRX in RRC_IDLE is supported, and RAN paging cycles of 5.12 s and
10.24 s are supported in RRC_INACTIVE.

Summary based on the input provided by LG Electronics France in SP-200126.
This WI introduces the requirements related to vehicle quality of service
support, which enables a V2X application to be timely notified of expected or
estimated change of quality of service (QoS). For example, when the
communication packet error is expected to increase or decrease, the V2X
application such as platooning application can increase or decrease inter-
vehicle distance.
This Work Item has mostly concluded that a standardized interface is needed
towards external V2X application servers. Using this standardized interface,
the V2X application servers can request a specific QoS requirements (and,
optionally, related alternative QoS requirements). It can also be notified
when the requested QoS requirements (and/or the alternative QoS requirements)
can or cannot be met.
The information that is delivered over the interface can be past statistics or
future prediction.
With this information, the V2X applications can adapt its behaviour according
to the QoS that can be provided by the 3GPP System.
Stage-2/3 works related to this WI were progressed within eV2XARC WI (see
below).

Summary based on the input provided by LG Electronics in SP-200058.
Based on the requirements specified by V2XIMP in TS 22.185 [2] and TS 22.186
[3], the \"Architecture enhancements to the 5G System\" are specified in TS
23.287 [1] in order to facilitate vehicular communications for Vehicle-to-
Everything (V2X) services. The following reference points are defined in the
architectural reference models:
\- PC5 reference point: NR PC5 RAT, LTE PC5 RAT.
\- Uu reference point: NR, E-UTRA.
The Stage 2 of the interworking between EPS V2X and 5GS V2X is also specified
.
The various parameters for V2X communications over PC5 and Uu reference points
are specified and these parameters may be made available to the UE in
following ways:
\- pre-configured in the ME; or
\- configured in the UICC; or
\- preconfigured in the ME and configured in the UICC; or
\- provided/updated by the V2X Application Server via PCF and/or V1 reference
point; or
\- provided/updated by the PCF to the UE.
In addition to PCF initiated Policy Provisioning procedure, the UE may perform
UE triggered Policy Provisioning procedure to the PCF when the UE determines
the V2X Policy/Parameter is invalid (e.g. Policy/Parameter is outdated,
missing or invalid).
Regarding V2X communication over PC5 reference point, two types of PC5
reference points exist: the LTE based PC5 reference point as defined in TS
23.285 [4], and the NR based PC5 reference point as defined in TS 23.287 [1].
A UE may use either type of PC5 or both for V2X communication depending on the
services the UE supports. The V2X communication over PC5 reference point
supports roaming and inter-PLMN operations. V2X communication over PC5
reference point is supported when UE is \"served by NR or E-UTRA\" or when the
UE is \"not served by NR or E-UTRA\".
V2X communication over NR based PC5 reference point supports broadcast mode,
groupcast mode and unicast mode. For unicast mode, Layer-2 link establishment,
Link identifier update, Layer-2 link release, Layer-2 link modification and
Layer-2 link maintenance procedures are specified. Per-Flow PC5 QoS Model is
introduced for V2X communication over NR based PC5 reference point.
Architecture enhancements for EPS to support V2X communication over NR PC5
reference point are specified in TS 23.285 [4].
For V2X communication over Uu reference point, only unicast is supported.
Latency reduction for V2X message transfer via unicast may be achieved by
using various mechanisms, including via e.g., edge computing defined in TS
23.501 [5].
Notification on QoS Sustainability Analytics to the V2X Application Server is
specified so that the V2X Application Server may request notifications on QoS
Sustainability Analytics for an indicated geographic area and time interval in
order to adjust the application behaviour in advance with potential QoS
change.
To support V2X applications that can operate with different configurations
(e.g. different bitrates or delay requirements), the V2X Application Server,
acting as the Application Function, can provide, in addition to the requested
level of service requirements, Alternative Service Requirements to the 5G
System. This enables the 5G System to act on the Alternative Service
Requirements and apply them for the extended NG-RAN notification (i.e.
Alternative QoS Profiles are provided from SMF to NG-RAN), as described in TS
23.501 [5] and TS 23.503 [6].
In order to facilitate deployment of dedicated network slice for use of, for
example, automotive industry and to facilitate roaming support, a new
standardized Slice/Service Type (SST) value dedicated for V2X services, i.e. 4
is defined in TS 23.501 [5].
Security aspects of 3GPP support for advanced V2X services are specified in TS
33.536 [7].
Stage 3 normative works made by CT working groups are specified in TS 24.587
[8] and TS 24.588 [9] that are new specifications for V2X as well as many
specifications listed in the WID on CT aspects of architecture enhancements
for 3GPP support of advanced V2X services [10].

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-200938.
The V2X application layer can be divided primarily into a V2X application
specific layer which consists of V2X specific applications (e.g. Platooning,
Vehicle safety) and a V2X application support layer which consists of V2X
enabler services (e.g. V2X service discovery, message delivery, service
continuity) and common enabler services (e.g. Group management, configuration
management, location management).
The following figure provides the high level illustration of the V2X
application layer.
{width="6.342361111111111in" height="2.952777777777778in"}
Figure 1: Application layer support for V2X services
In Release 16, in order to ensure efficient use and deployment of V2X
applications on 3GPP network (EPS), a V2X application layer architecture is
specified with primary focus on the V2X application support aspects consisting
of V2X application enabler (VAE) as specified in TS 23.286 [5] and Service
Enabler Architecture Layer (SEAL) as specified in TS 23.434 [6].
In this clause, the enabler services utilized by V2X application specific
layer are summarized. The V2X application enabler capabilities takes into
consideration the study in TR 23.795 [4], the existing stage 1 and stage 2
work within 3GPP related to V2X in TS 22.185 [1], TS 22.186 [2] and TS 23.285
[3], as well as V2X application standards defined outside 3GPP (e.g. ETSI,
SAE).
The V2X application specific layer utilizes the enabler services provided by
VAE layer or SEAL. The architecture allows for flexible deployments
considering V2X application support layer being deployed centrally or deployed
in a distributed manner by either a V2X service provider or PLMN operator or
both.
The following features are specified in Rel.16 for the support of V2X
application specific layer:
a. The following VAE capabilities are specified in TS 23.286 [5], the related
detailed procedures over HTTP protocol between VAE client (V2X UE) and VAE
server are specified in TS 24.486 [7] and the RESTful APIs provided by VAE
server towards the V2X application specific server is specified in TS 29.486
[8]:
â€¢ V2X service discovery to enable V2X UE to discover V2X services provided by
V2X application servers via VAE server, V2X UE register at VAE server for
receiving V2X services from V2X application specific servers and V2X message
distribution/delivery (including group communication) for V2X messages
originated from the V2X application specific layer (Uplink and/or Downlink).
â€¢ Application level location tracking of the V2X UE(s) as per the geographical
information provided by the V2X application specific layer.
â€¢ V2X service continuity by dynamically receiving local service information
and discovery of appropriate VAE server to serve the V2X UE as per the
geographical area corresponding to V2X UE mobility.
â€¢ Dynamic group management for scenarios like Platooning where the groups are
enabled by V2X application specific server and the related V2V
configurations/provisioning to the V2X UE are enabled by VAE server.
â€¢ V2X UE subscription and notification of network situation information to
support V2X UE level application adaptations.
â€¢ Communication of V2X application specific layer requirement to the EPC by
translating the application requirements to the network requirements.
â€¢ Supporting file distribution from V2X application specific server to the V2X
UEs using xMB APIs as specified in TS 26.348 [9].
b. The following SEAL capabilities specified in TS 23.434 [6] are used by V2X
application layer and more details about the following services are provided
in clause 9.4:
â€¢ Group management service
â€¢ Configuration management service
â€¢ Location management service
â€¢ Network resource management service

Summary based on the input provided by LG Electronics in RP-200855.
3GPP RAN technology for sidelink communication based on 5G NR was specified
through this WI to define the means for providing the advanced V2X services
identified by 3GPP SA1. This WI corresponds to 3GPP V2X phase 3, which is the
evolution of LTE V2X in Release 14 (phase 1) and 15 (phase 2).
This section provides a summary of the key functionalities of NR sidelink.
[Physical layer structure]{.underline}
Sidelink bandwidth part (BWP) is defined to support the flexible numerologies
in operating on various spectrum band such as the intelligent transport system
(ITS) dedicated band and the licensed band of frequency range 1 (FR1) and FR2.
For sidelink synchronization, GNSS, gNB/eNB and the NR sidelink UE can be used
as a synchronization reference source of a UE.
The NR V2X sidelink uses the following physical channels and signals:
\- Physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH) and its de-modulation reference
signal (DMRS)
\- Physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH) and its DMRS
\- Physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH) and its DMRS
\- Physical sidelink feedback channel (PSFCH)
\- Sidelink primary and secondary synchronization signals (S-PSS and S-SSS)
\- Phase-tracking reference signal (PT-RS) in FR2
\- Channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS)
Sidelink control information (SCI) in NR V2X is transmitted in two stages. The
first-stage SCI is carried on PSCCH and contains information to enable sensing
operations, as well as information about the resource allocation of the PSSCH.
PSSCH transmits the second-stage SCI and the sidelink shared channel (SL-SCH)
transport channel. The second-stage SCI carries information needed to identify
and decode the associated SL-SCH, as well as control for hybrid automatic
repeat request (HARQ) procedures, and triggers for channel state information
(CSI) feedback, etc. SL-SCH carries the transport block (TB) of data for
transmission over SL.
PSCCH and PSSCH are multiplexed in time and frequency within a slot for short
latency and high reliability. DRMS is frequency multiplexed with PSCCH or
PSSCH in the corresponding DMRS symbols. PSFCH, which is used for sidelink
HARQ feedback for unicast and groupcast, is transmitted at the end of a slot,
which is preceded by an additional guard symbol and an automatic gain control
(AGC) symbol. Two multiplexing examples are shown in Figure 1(a) and 1(b).

PSFCH.
{width="3.1in" height="1.2in"}
Figure 1(b) Example slot format of 3-symbol PSCCH, 3-symbol PSSCH-DMRS, and
PSFCH.
[Resource allocation]{.underline}
There are two resource allocation modes: mode 1 and mode 2. Mode 1 for
resource allocation by gNB and Mode 2 for UE autonomous resource selection are
very similar to Mode 3 and Mode 4 in LTE sidelink respectively. For mode 1,
gNB schedules to UE the dynamic grant resources by downlink control
information (DCI), or the configured grant resource type 1 and type 2 by radio
resource control (RRC) signalling and DCI respectively.
In Mode 2, the sensing operation to determine transmission resources by UE
comprises 1) sensing within a sensing window, 2) exclusion of the resources
reserved by other UEs, and 3) select the final resources within a selection
window. In Mode 2, shortly before transmitting in a reserved resource, a
sensing UE re-evaluates the set of resources to check whether its intended
transmission is still suitable, considering a possible aperiodic transmission
after the resource reservation. If the reserved resources would not be part of
the set for selection at this time, then new resources are selected from the
updated resource selection window. In addition to the re-evaluation, pre-
emption is also introduced such that a UE selects new resources even after it
announces the resource reservation when it observes resource collision with a
higher priority transmission from another UE.
[Sidelink HARQ feedback, sidelink CSI and PC5-RRC for unicast and
groupcast]{.underline}
NR sidelink supports sidelink HARQ-ACK for sidelink unicast and groupcast
services for improved reliability. Two sidelink HARQ feedback operations are
defined, HARQ-ACK with ACK and NACK, and HARQ-ACK with NACK only. When
ACK/NACK operation is used, the sidelink HARQ-ACK procedure is similar to that
of Uu for non-codeblock group feedback, i.e. the HARQ-ACKis transmitted based
on the success or failure of the whole transport block. NACK-only operation is
defined for groupcast to allow a a larger number of Rx UEs to share a single
PSFCH resource by sending feedback only when a Rx UE receives SCI but fails to
decode the transport block. The transmission of NACK-only feedback can be
restricted to UEs within given a radius, and any UE beyond it does not provide
any HARQ-ACK. This minimum range requirement of a service is provided together
with the associated QoS parameters from service layers. For mode 1, sidelink
HARQ-ACK information is reported to gNB to indicate whether additional
retransmission resources are required or not.
In sielink unicast transmission, Tx UE can configure aperiodic sidelink CSI
reporting from the Rx UE to get information it can use for sidelink link
adaptation and rank adaptation. CQI and RI are reported via MAC layer
signalling, in a PSSCH transmission for this purpose. In addition, radio link
monitoring is adopted to manage a sidelink connection.
Figure 2 PC5 control plane (PC5-C) protocol stack for RRC.
To support exchange of the AS layer configuration and UE capability
information between UEs, PC5-RRC is defined for unicast sidelink
communication. The AS protocol stacks of the control plane for RRC is depicted
in Figure 2.
[Cross-RAT and in-device coexistence between LTE V2X and NR V2X
sidelinks]{.underline}
Depending on the NR V2X and LTE V2X deployment, it is envisaged that an
optional UE design can be supported where a device has both an LTE-V2X RAT and
an NR-V2X RAT which are able to inter-communicate. 5G V2X defines two Cross-
RAT operations. LTE Uu can control NR resource allocation mode 1 by providing
configured grant Type 1 configurations via LTE RRC signalling, and resource
allocation mode 2 by LTE Uu RRC providing the semi-static configurations
relevant to resource pools, sensing, etc. NR Uu can control LTE resource
allocation mode 3 by transmitting an NR DCI which contains the information
needed to dynamically control the LTE sidelink, and resource allocation mode 4
by NR Uu RRC providing the necessary semi-static configurations within which
the LTE-V2X RAT autonomously selects resources for sidelink transmission.
It is envisaged that there will exist devices that support both LTE-V2X and
NR-V2X, and which will be operating in both systems concurrently. If the two
RATs are widely spaced in frequency, e.g. being in different bands, then there
need be no particular issues to consider since it is assumed that a separate
RF chain will be provided for each band. If, however, a sufficiently close
frequency spacing is deployed, then it is desirable to enable a single RF
chain to be used in the implementation. In this case, the simultaneous
transmission on both RATs is prevented by the UE\'s single power budget, and
one RAT cannot be received/transmitted while the other RAT is doing the
opposite. In this case, one of the RATs may be dropped at times when both
occur simultaneously, but that in some cases where the priority of the V2X
service on both RATs is known, the higher priority one is automatically
selected.

## 9.1 Usage of CAPIF for xMB API
* * *
**790019** **Usage of CAPIF for xMB API** **CAPIF4xMB** **S4** **SP-180031**
**Thorsten Lohmar, Ericsson LM**
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-181187.
The CAPIF4xMB work item resulted in the creation of the xMB specification in
TS.26.348 [1]. This TS contains the reference point specification for the
external interface towards content providers or other 3GPP defined API
invokers.
3GPP SA4 aligned the xMB reference point to the Common API Framework (CAPIF)
within the CAPIF4xMB work item targeting Release 16. The xMB reference point
exists between Content Providers (as API invoker) and the BM-SC. An API
invoker can be a 3rd party provider or other 3GPP defined services.
xMB offers a simple interface to control the MBMS delivery procedure and to
ingest the data to be delivered via MBMS. The MBMS usage complexity, e.g.
handling of packet losses, etc is handled by the BM-SC.
xMB offers control procedures for different session types, namely generic file
delivery, application (timed file streaming like DASH over MBMS), streaming
and transport-only (access to a plain IP multicast transport). The xMB
reference point offers an extended set of control features for MC Services.
As part of the CAPIF4xMB work item, the xMB Stage 2 architecture and
procedures are moved from TS 26.346 to a new TS 26.348, containing the xMB
Stage 2 and necessary extensions for CAPIF. The new TS also contains more
elaborative guidelines around the usage of the different xMB API features.

Summary based on the input provided by Samsung in SP-200851.
With the growing interest in 3GPP to develop northbound APIs, it is essential
to define a common API framework. A common API framework within 3GPP will
allow for a consistent development of northbound APIs across multiple working
groups, i.e. when defining northbound APIs to abstract or expose the
underlying 3GPP network capabilities to 3rd party applications. Intended users
of CAPIF are third-party developers that may not be familiar with 3GPP
networks and their underlying complexities.
In Release 15, the technical report TR 23.722 was provided to cover key
issues, architecture requirements, functional architecture model, and
corresponding solutions that are relevant to the definition of a common API
framework applicable to any service APIs when used by northbound entities.
Subsequently, still in Release 15, a stage-2 Common API Framework for 3GPP
Northbound APIs (CAPIF) specification was developed in TS 23.222, based on the
solutions and conclusions of TR 23.722. The work item summary for Release 15
CAPIF is available in TS 21.915 [1].
While a basic Common API Framework is made available in 3GPP Rel-15, there are
several enhancements that are considered for developing eCAPIF in Rel-16 in TS
23.222 [2], and the key enhancements are listed as follows:
a. Architecture functional model to support multiple API providers (within and
outside the PLMN trust domain) where CAPIF-3, CAPIF-4 and CAPIF-5 were
enhanced as CAPIF-3e, CAPIF-4e and CAPIF-5e respectively to enable the API
exposing function, the API publishing function and the API management function
of the API provider domain within the 3rd party trust domain interaction with
the CAPIF core function in the PLMN trust domain. Further, the API exposing
function within the PLMN trust domain interacts with the API exposing function
in the 3rd party trust domain via CAPIF-7e.
b. Architectural model for the CAPIF interconnection which allows API invokers
of a CAPIF provider to utilize the service APIs from the 3rd party CAPIF
provider where the designated CAPIF core function of the CAPIF provider A
provides the information about the CAPIF instances and service APIs deployed
by the CAPIF provider A to the designated CAPIF core function of the CAPIF
provider B and vice versa over CAPIF-6e reference point.
c. Additional deployment models including distributed deployment of CAPIF
considering PLMN trust domain and 3rd party trust domain, multiple CAPIF core
functions that may be deployed within the PLMN trust domain.
d. The procedure to support API topology hiding by dynamically configuring the
address of the AEF providing the Service API to the AEF entry point providing
the topology hiding. The API publishing function and the API exposing function
can be within PLMN trust domain or within 3rd party trust domain.
e. Procedures to support for CAPIF interconnenction including interconnection
API publish request from CAPIF core function to CAPIF core function, service
API discovery by the API invoker from multiple CCFs, service API discovery
between multiple CCFs.
f. Procedures for updating the API invoker\'s API list on the CAPIF core
function.
g. Procedure for dynamically routing the service API invocation from the AEF
acting as service communication entry point to the destination AEF for
handling service API.
h. Procedure for registering API provider domain functions on the CAPIF core
function and for updating the registration information of the API provider
domain functions on the CAPIF core function.
i. Integrated deployment of 3GPP network exposure systems with the CAPIF - The
SCEF and the NEF may be integrated with a single CAPIF core function to offer
their respective service APIs to the API invokers. The following deployment
model is possible for integrated deployment of the SCEF and the NEF with the
CAPIF core function.
Security aspects of enhancements for Common API Framework for 3GPP Northbound
APIs are specified in TS 33.122 [3].
Stage 3 normative work to support enhancements for Common API Framework for
3GPP Northbound APIs including the OpenAPI specifications made by CT3 working
group is specified in TS 29.222 [4].

Summary based on the input provided by Samsung in SP-200852.
3GPP SA6 specified application layer standards for mission critical services
and application layer support for V2X. While developing mission critical
services, some core set of capabilities (e.g. group management, configuration
management, identity management, key management, location management) were
identified to be common across MCPTT, MCData and MCVideo services, leading to
a separate Common Functional Architecture (CFA) specification. It was
identified that V2X applications will also require a similar common set of
application layer capabilities as specified in TS 23.286.
Specifying such common capabilities for V2X, independent from those that are
defined in existing mission critical specifications could lead to fragmented
capabilities and deployments. This approach results in consuming significant
development time and delays in timely adoption of 3GPP technologies.
Therefore, a set of common capabilities that can be utilized by V2X
applications and potentially by multiple vertical industry applications is
developed as service enabler architecture layer (SEAL) over 3GPP networks in
TS 23.434 [1].
The Stage-2 SEAL in TS 23.434 specifes the following:
1) The architecture requirements for SEAL services.
2) The functional model for SEAL is organized into generic SEAL service
functional model and specific SEAL service functional models. The generic SEAL
service functional model will be used as the reference model for the specific
SEAL service functional models. The generic functional model (represented
using reference point and service based interface) for SEAL service is in the
figure below:
{width="5.543999343832021in" height="2.1460640857392828in"}
In the vertical application layer, the VAL client communicates with the VAL
server over VAL-UU reference point. VAL-UU supports both unicast and multicast
delivery modes.
The SEAL functional entities on the UE and the server are grouped into SEAL
client(s) and SEAL server(s) respectively. The SEAL consists of a common set
of services (e.g. group management, location management) and reference points.
The SEAL offers its services to the vertical application layer (VAL).
The SEAL client(s) communicates with the SEAL server(s) over the SEAL-UU
reference points. SEAL-UU supports both unicast and multicast delivery modes.
The SEAL client(s) provides the service enabler layer support functions to the
VAL client(s) over SEAL-C reference points. The VAL server(s) communicate with
the SEAL server(s) over the SEAL-S reference points. The SEAL server(s) may
communicate with the underlying 3GPP network systems using the respective 3GPP
interfaces specified by the 3GPP network system.
3) The functional model for interconnection between SEAL servers to support
distributed SEAL server deployments, the SEAL server interacts with another
SEAL server for the same SEAL service over SEAL-E reference point as shown in
the figure below:
{width="5.072055993000875in" height="1.717143482064742in"}
4) The functional model for inter-service communication between SEAL servers
to support the SEAL server interaction with another SEAL server for inter-
service communication over SEAL-X reference point is shown in the figure
below:
{width="5.336055336832896in" height="1.8065212160979878in"}
5) The functional architecture of each SEAL service listed below and
corresponding functional entities and reference points along with the
procedures and information flows, northbound APIs to expose the SEAL services
to the vertical applications in compliance with CAPIF for each SEAL service is
listed below:
\- Group management (GM): The vertical application specific group
communication is one of the essential feature in any vertical application. To
enable group communication, each vertical application needs to create and
manage the group, group specific policies and group members. The group
management service, as provided by SEAL, supports group management operations
(i.e. Create, Read, Update, Delete and Notify) by the authorized users or VAL
servers. It also supports merging of multiple groups into single group where
all the group members of the constituent groups are also members of the merged
group.
\- Location management (LM): Managing VAL user's location information is a
service that is required by multiple vertical specific applications. The
location management service, as provided by SEAL, supports sharing location
data between client and server for vertical application usage. It also
provides support to request for on-demand location reporting by client and
location reporting based on configurable triggers. The service also enables
VAL servers to query location of any user as well as sharing the network
location information obtained from the 3GPP network systems to the vertical
applications.
\- Configuration management (CM): Most of the vertical applications need to
create and maintain configurations. Further, they need to provide the initial
configuration to all its users and need to notify as soon as there is any
change in configuration. The configuration management service, as provided by
SEAL, supports creating and managing UE configuration and user profile
configuration for the vertical applications. It also supports subscribe-notify
mechanism so that the VAL users can subscribe to any change in configurations.
\- Network resource management (NRM): Many vertical applications require
managing different radio bearers and switching among them. The network
resource management service, as provided by SEAL, supports establishing and
modifying unicast and/or multicast bearers. It also supports announcements for
multicast bearers and switching from unicast to multicast bearers and vice
versa.
\- Key management (KM): The security of sensitive data and user's information
is important aspect for every vertical application. The key management
service, as provided by SEAL, supports generation and secure distribution of
encryption keys to VAL users.
\- Identity management (IM): The identity management service, as provided by
SEAL, supports VAL user's authentication and authorization framework. As per
the defined framework, each VAL user sends authentication request using SEAL
Identity Management Client (SIM-C) and once the user authentication is
successful, the VAL user can request for access-token. The SEAL Identity
Management Server (SIM-S) creates the access token, which is opaque to the VAL
clients. The access token contains VAL user's identity. The VAL user presents
the access token to VAL server to access VAL service. The VAL server
authorizes the VAL user after verifying the validity of the access token.
6) Specifying various deployment models of SEAL services: The SEAL server(s)
may be deployed either in the PLMN operator domain or deployed in the VAL
service provider domain. The SEAL server(s) connects with the 3GPP network
system in one or more PLMN operator domain. The SEAL server(s) may be
supporting multiple VAL servers.
7) Service-based interface representation of the functional model for SEAL
services as shown in the figure below:
The SEAL function(s) exhibit the service-based interfaces, which are used for
providing and consuming SEAL services. The service APIs are specified for each
SEAL function enabled over the service-based interface. The service-based
interfaces of specific SEAL services are specified in TS 23.434. All the
interactions with SEAL are governed based on the reference point interactions
of the functional models specified in subclause 6 of TS 23.434. VAL function
represents the functionalities of the VAL server.
The service APIs offered by the SEAL function(s) are published and discovered
on the CAPIF core function as specified in TS 23.222 [9].
8) SEAL functional model mapping with Common functional architecture (CFA).
Security aspects of 3GPP support for service enabler architecture layer (SEAL)
are specified in TS 33.434 [2].
Stage 3 normative work to service enabler architecture layer (SEAL) are
specified in TS 24.544 [3], TS 24.545 [4], TS 24.546 [5], TS 24.547 [6], TS
24.548 [7] and TS 29.549 [6].

**[Overall aspects]{.underline}** (from SP-200253)
This WI aimes to enhance 5G core network to support connection of residential
gateway connected via wireline access network and via 3GPP RAN access.
Furthermore the WI aimes to support Non-3GPP network as Trusted network in
contrast with Untrusted network. The main features introduced by the WI
includes the specification of new access network node, called W-AGF (Wireline
Access Gateway function), the improvement of registration and session
management procedures, policy, QoS etc, tailored to the specific
characteristic of wireline access network. The main future for supporting
Trusted network includes the definition of architecture with new Trusted
Gateway Network Function, selection procedure of such gateway, improvement and
extension of registration and session procedures, policy , etc for supporting
such scenario.
The description of support of Wireline Access Network and Trusted Non-3GPP
Access Network are described in the following clauses.
[Support of wireline access network]{.underline}
The architecture for non-roaming is shown in figure 1, where the Wireline
Access Gateway Function (W-AGF) is the access node performing the termination
of N2 and N3 reference point, termination of access network interface Y4 and
all access network specify functionalities, the relay of N1 to/from the UE.,
QoS enforcement, etc. The customer device, the UE, is replaced by the
Residential Gateway which is augmented to support the 5G functionalities
required to connect to 5G systems, such as NAS, URSP, PDU session, etc, called
5G-RG. The specification in TS 23.316 [1] defines the modification to system
architecture, procedure and flows, Policy and Charging Control for the 5G
System in TS 23.501 [2], TS 23.502 [3] and TS 23.503 [4].
The 5G-RG can also be connected via 3GPP Access basically by means of
supporting the specification defined for UE. This scenario is called Fixed
Wireless Access (FWA). Furthermore the 5G-RG may simultaneously connect to
3GPP Access and to wireline access by using the Single Access PDU session or
supporting ATSSS feature. This scenario is called Hybrid scenario, using a
terminology common on wireline access network. The ATSSS is supported as
specified in TS 23.501, 23.502 and TS 23.503 where UE is replaced by 5G-RG and
the Non-3GPP access (es) is specifically referred to wireline access. In this
latter case, TS 23.316 has also specified the support of interworking with EPC
via 3GPP Access via a MA PDU session with a PDN Connection as user-plane
resource associated with a MA PDU Session.
The support of legacy Residential Gateway not supporting 5G capability (FN-RG)
is supported via W-AGF terminating the N1 NAS on behalf of UE and acting as a
UE in respect the 5G core.
In the case of Wireline Access Network defined in Broadband Forum the W-AGF
functionalities is specified in BBF TR-470 [5], BBF TR-456 [6] and BBF TR-457
[7], the 5G-RG is defined in BBF TR-124issue6 [8]. In the case of Wireline
Access network defined in Cablelabs the W-AGF and 5G-RG functionalities are
defined in CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [9].
Main impacts on the system by the WWC Work Item for wireline support are the
following:
\- W-AGF: the access network function which performs the termination of N2 and
N3 reference point, termination of access network interface Y4 and all access
network specify functionalities, the relay of N1 to/from the UE. QoS
enforcement, etc. When the W-AGF facing the FN-RG the W-AGF is supporting the
termination of N1 NAS and performs the interworking between 5GC and the legacy
wireline access network.
\- 5G-RG: end user device replacing the UE which supports 5G capabilities (NAS
protocol and procedure, USRP, IMSI, ATSSS) and extension of wireline access
layer specific functionalities defined by Broadband forum and CableLabs. The
5G-RG may also support UE capability when connects via 3GPP Access.
\- FN-RG: end user device replacing the UE which does not support 5G
capabilities.
\- Global Line Identifier (GLI): in case of wireline access based on BBF
specifications this parameter uniquely identifies the line at which the 5G-RG
in connected to within an operator domain.
\- Global Cable identifier (GCI): in case of wireline access based on
CableLabs specification this parameter uniquely identifies the line at which
the 5G-RG in connected to within an operator domain.
\- SUPI for FN-RG based on GCI and GLI.
\- All procedures defined in TS 23.502 have been modified to introduce the new
network elements. The procedures are focused mainly on the part of
specification that required improvements and to point out the access network
interaction involving the W-AGF, 5G-RG and FN-RG to allow the Broadband Forum
and CableLabs to develop the specifications under their responsibility.
\- IPTV support: The specification TS 23.316 in clauses 4.9.1 and 7.7.1
defines the support of IPTV via the support of multicast over unicast PDU
session by using IGMP/MLD message send by STB via 5G-RG on PDU session and
managed by UPF for adding the requiring 5G-RG to a multicast group and
replicating the traffic received on N6 interface to the PDU session. The SMF
is improved to control the support of IPTV by the UPF acting as PSA using PDR,
FAR, QER, URR. This includes control of which IGMP and MLD requests the UPF is
to accept or to deny.
\- QoS: the QoS model for wireline network is based on a subscription maximum
aggregate bitrate including both GBR and Non-GBR traffic, hence the new
parameter RG Total Maximum Bit Rate (RG-TMBR) has been defined. The RG-TMBR
limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be provided across all
GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows of a RG. The RG-TMBR is a parameter provided to the
W-AGF by the AMF based on the value of the Subscribed RG-TMBR retrieved from
UDM. The QoS control on wireline access network (i.e scheduling, rate limiting
and traffic class management) is based on the line characteristic included in
user subscription, for example different priority of service, different
traffic class support by line of the single user, etc, for such reason the new
parameter RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics (RG-LWAC) has been
introduced. The format and content of RG LWAC is specified by BBF and it is
transparently provided by UDM to AMF which may provide to the W-AGF at the
time of the RG registration
\- mobility restriction based on GLI and GCI
\- support of BBF interaction with the Access Configuration System (ACS) to
support the provisioning of configuration and remote management of 5G-RG as
described in BBF TR-069 [12] or in BBF TR-369 [13].

[Support of Trusted Access network]{.underline}
The support of Trusted Network addresses the scenario where the Non-3GPP
access network has a tighter relationship with 5GC in respect the untrusted
scenario. However how the network is considered Trusted or Untrusted is not in
the scope of this WID. The architecture for non-roaming is shown in figure 3,
where the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network (TNAN) is the access node performing
the termination of N2 and N3 reference point, termination of access network
interface, relay of N1 to/from the UE. From 3GPP point of view the TNAN
network is composed by the TNGF and the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Point (TNAP)
which are interconnected via the reference point Ta. However the detailed
definition of TNAN and of Ta is beyond the WID scope. The reference point
between the UE and the TNG, the NWt, is specified leveraging the IKEv2 defined
for Untrusted. The main difference in contrast to Untrusted is in registration
procedure, where it is assumed that EAP-5G can be carried between UE and TNAP
directly on access layers, such on IEEE 802.11x and between TNAP and TNGF via
Ta and not as part of IKEv2 establishment. From other the point of view of
other procedures, such as session management, the same procedure specified for
Untrusted Non-3GPP access network can be used with basically the TNGF
replacing the N3IWF, and modification that IKEv2 Child SA establishment is
requested by TNGF and not by UE side.
Within the context of Trusted Non-3GP network, also the scenario of devices
not supporting NAS connected via WLAN is specified. The role of TNGF is
replaced the Trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF) with the main
difference that TWIF terminates the N1 NAS interface and it play the role of
UE in respect the 5GC.
The specification is addressed in TS 23.501 [2], TS 23.502 [3] and TS 23.503

Summary based on the input provided by ZTE Wistron Telecom AB in SP-200124.
The ATSSS feature enables a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service, which can
exchange PDUs between the UE and a data network by simultaneously using one
3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access network and two independent N3/N9
tunnels between the PSA and RAN/AN. The multi-access PDU Connectivity Service
is realized by establishing a Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session, i.e. a PDU
Session that may have user-plane resources on two access networks, as shown on
the figure below, extracted from TR 23.793 [1].
Figure 1: MA PDU session
These following procedures are defined in the context of this Feature:
\- Access Traffic Steering: it selects an access network for a new data flow
and transfers the traffic of this data flow over the selected access network.
Access traffic steering is applicable between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP
access.
\- Access Traffic Switching: it moves all traffic of an ongoing data flow from
one access network to another access network in a way that maintains the
continuity of the data flow. Access traffic switching is applicable between
one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.
\- Access Traffic Splitting: it splits the traffic of a data flow across
multiple access networks. When traffic splitting is applied to a data flow,
some traffic of the data flow is transferred via one access and some other
traffic of the same data flow is transferred via another access. Access
traffic splitting is applicable between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP
access.
Key concepts of ATSSS supported in Release 16 include the following:
\- Multi-access PDU Session is a PDU Session that provides a PDU connectivity
service, which can use one access network at a time, or simultaneously one
3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access network and two independent N3/N9
tunnels between the PSA and RAN/AN.
\- After the establishment of a MA PDU Session:
\- When there are user-plane resources on both access networks:
\- The UE applies network-provided policy (i.e. ATSSS rules derived by UE's
serving SMF based on ATSSS policy from serving PCF) and considers local
conditions (such as network interface availability, signal loss conditions,
user preferences, etc.) for deciding how to distribute the uplink traffic
across the two access networks.
\- Similarly, the UPF anchor of the MA PDU Session applies network-provided
policy (i.e. N4 rules derived by UE's serving SMF based on ATSSS policy from
serving PCF) and the feedback information received from the UE via the user-
plane (such as access network Unavailability or Availability), the UPF then
decides how to distribute the downlink traffic across the two N3/N9 tunnels
and two access networks.
\- When there are user-plane resources on only one access network, the UE
applies the ATSSS rules and considers local conditions for triggering the
establishment or activation of the user plane resources over another access.
\- The type of a MA PDU Session may be one of the following types: i.e. IPv4,
IPv6, IPv4v6, and Ethernet. The Unstructured type is not supported in Release
16.
\- The ATSSS feature can be supported over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses,
including untrusted and trusted non-3GPP access networks, wireline 5G access
networks, etc., as long as a MA PDU Session can be established over the given
type of access network
\- Two ATSSS steering functionalities are supported:
\- MPTCP functionality, for TCP traffic, with MPTCP proxy in UPF, by using the
MPTCP protocol over the 3GPP and/or the non-3GPP user plane; and
\- ATSSS-LL functionality for all types of traffic, including TCP traffic, UDP
traffic, Ethernet traffic, etc. ATSSS-LL functionality is mandatory for MA PDU
Session of type Ethernet.
The following presents the example of the ATSSS traffic steering functionality
within the UE.
Figure 2: Steering functionalities in an example UE model
\- The Performance Measurement Function (PMF) is supported by UPF and is
specific for ATSSS-LL functionality, if enabled. In Release 16, PMF supports
two types of measurements between UE and UPF to assist access selection and
they are:
\- UE and UPF make RTT measurements per access when the \"Smallest Delay\"
steering mode is used; and
\- UE reports access availability/unavailability to UPF
The following presents the protocol stacks of the PMF for the user plane
measurements over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses respectively.

Figure 3: UE/UPF measurements related protocol stack for 3GPP access and for
an MA PDU Session with type IP
In the case of an MA PDU Session with type Ethernet, the protocol stack over
3GPP access is that same as the one in the above figure, but the PMF protocol
operates on top of Ethernet, instead of UDP/IP.
{width="6.0in" height="2.1979166666666665in"}
Figure 4: UE/UPF measurements related protocol stack for non-3GPP access and
for an MA PDU Session with type IP
In the case of an MA PDU Session with type Ethernet, the protocol stack over
non-3GPP access is that same as the one in the above figure, but the PMF
protocol operates on top of Ethernet, instead of UDP/IP.
\- An ATSSS-capable UE may decide to request a MA PDU Session based on the
provisioned URSP rules. In particular, the UE should request a MA PDU Session
when the UE applies a URSP rule, which triggers the UE to establish a new PDU
Session and the Access Type Preference component of the URSP rule indicates
\"Multi-Access\".
\- The 5G QoS model for the Single-Access PDU Session is also applied to the
MA PDU Session, i.e. the QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS
differentiation in the MA PDU Session. One difference compared to the Single-
Access PDU Session is that in a MA PDU Session there can be separate user-
plane tunnels between the AN and the PSA, each one associated with a different
access. The SMF shall provide the same QFI in 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses so
that the same QoS is supported in both accesses. Non GBR QoS Flow can be
distributed over 3GPP access and non 3GPP access, but GBR QoS Flow is
transferred over single access.
\- ATSSS is currently not supported when moving to EPC from 5GC, except for
the specific case with wireline access integrated to EPC/5GC with 5G-RG; ATSSS
with one User Plane leg in E-UTRA/EPC and one User Plane leg in wireline/5GC
is supported.

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-200941.
This Feature introduces a set of additional requirements on top of Rel-15 to
support the specific communication needs of railways. It also corrects
inconsistencies and clarifies ambiguities.
Amongst others functionality was added to the multi-talker functionality e.g.
to allow a MCX User to manually override multi talker requests was introduced
and the support of supplementary services for railway communication (private
calls). A lot of focus was put on interworking between FRMCS and GSM-R and a
lot of refinement effort was spent on the handling and the integration of
functional alias into the 3GPP system.
All three stages were affected by this work and work was covered by CRs to TS
22.179, 22.280, 22.281, 22.282, 23.280, 23.281, 23.282, 23.282, 23.379,

LTE_high_speed_enh2 R4 RP-181482 NTT DOCOMO
Summary based on the input provided by NTT DOCOMO, INC. in RP-192721.
In Rel-13 and 14, the mobility and throughput performance were enhanced to
cover high speeds (up to 350 km/h) by specifying the requirements for UE RRM,
UE demodulation and base station demodulation, considering the two types of
operator's practical deployments shown in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the
case where no specific installation is deployed to handle high-speed trains,
i.e. UEs in the train use the \"standard\" LTE eNBs. Alternatively, figure 2
shows the case where Single Frequency Network (SFN) are deployed. SFNs use so-
called \"Remote Radio Heads\" (RRH), which are dedicated antennas deployed
along the train track. In this case, the baseband unit (BBU) is connected to
the RRH, e.g. using fiber.
Figure 1. Non-Single Frequency Network (SFN) high speed scenario
Figure 2. SFN high speed scenario
These Rel-13 and 14 enhancements were conducted both for non-SFN and for SFN,
but only for LTE single carrier, i.e. not covering Carrier Aggregation (CA).
This Rel-16 work item further improves the mobility and throughput
performance, now considering CA and speeds up to 500 km/h. To this aim, it
enhances RRM, UE demodulation and base station demodulation: it specifies
enhanced RRM core requirements and corresponding RRC signals in respectively
TS 36.133 [2] and TS 36.331 [3].
**Part 1: RRM requirements enhancements:**
**In Release 14 cases (limited** to 350 km/h and single carrier), **the
latency requirements under DRX configuration up to 1.28s DRX cycle were
enhanced by reducing the** cell identification delay in connected mode and
cell reselection delay in idle mode [1]**.**
**In Rel-16, considering Carrier Aggregation** and speeds up to 500km/h, the
following enhanced requirements were introduced to achieve good mobility
performance and less paging outage:
  1. **Enhanced RRM requirements for active SCells (for 350km/h velocity):**
> The same requirements specified in Rel-14 high speed WI are applied to
> active SCells.
  1. **Enhanced RRM requirements for deactivated SCells (for 350km/h velocity):**
> The cell identification delay and measurement period are reduced.
  1. **Enhanced RRM requirements in DRX in connected mode (for 500km/h velocity):**
> The cell identification delay and measurement period on 1.28s DRX cycle are
> further reduced from those in Rel-14 high speed WI.
  1. **Enhanced RRM requirements in idle mode (for 500km/h velocity):**
> The cell detection delay is further reduced from those in Rel-14 high speed
> WI.
  1. **Enhanced UL timing adjustment requirements in connected mode (for 500km/h velocity):**
> The larger maximum autonomous time adjustment step is applied when the
> downlink bandwidth is wider than 10MHz.
**Part 2: Demodulation enhancements**
  1. **For UE and base station demodulation enhancements**
> In Release 14, UE and base station demodulation requirements were enhanced
> [1], for both cases of operator's practical deployments shown in figures 1
> and 2.
>
> In Release 16, regarding the CA case in SFN (figure 2), the requirements
> specified in Rel-14 are expanded to Dual Connectivity\'s Secondary Cells
> (SCells) as defined in TS 36.331 [3]. Regarding further high speed up to 500
> km/h, additional requirements are introduced to ensure the PDSCH/PUSCH/PRACH
> demodulation performance with larger Doppler shift.
The impacts on RRC signals to meet the new requirements above are also
specified.

Summary based on the input provided by CMCC in RP-200776.
This WI targets to specify the UE RRM requirements, UE/BS demodulation
requirements for high speed train scenario. The supported velocity is up to
500km/h and the carrier frequency is up to 3.6GHz covering both TDD and FDD.
In Rel-16 WI on NR support of high speed train scenarios, the enhanced RRM
requirements and demodulation requirements were specified to support the speed
of up to 500km/h and carrier frequency is up to 3.6GHz.
For RRM, to guarantee the mobility performance for the scenario with velocity
up to 500km/hï¼Œboth enhanced requirements for NR intra-RAT measurement and
enhanced requirements for inter-RAT measurement between NR and EUTRA are
specified. The enhanced requirements for NR intra-RAT include NR cell re-
selection requirements, NR cell identification requirements, beam management
requirements. The enhanced requirements for inter-RAT measurement between NR
and EUTRA include EUTRA inter-RAT measurement requirements and NR inter-RAT
measurement requirements, both idle mode and connected mode are considered.
For UE demodulation, HST-SFN (multiple RRHs are connected to one BBU with
fiber), HST single tap and multi-path fading channel are considered. For HST-
SFN, the maximum doppler shift is 1667Hz (500km/h + 3.6GHz) and 870Hz for
30KHz SCS and 15KHz SCS respectively. For HST single tap, the maximum doppler
shift is 1667Hz and 972Hz for 30KHz SCS and 15KHz SCS respectively. For multi-
path fading channel, the maximum doppler shift is 1200Hz and 600Hz for 30KHz
SCS and 15KHz SCS respectively. For BS demodulation, at least HST single tap
is considered. And the maximum doppler shift is 3334Hz and 1740Hz for 30KHz
SCS and 15KHz SCS respectively.

Summary based on the input provided by SyncTechno Inc. in SP-200344.
The MARCOM feature introduces service requirements to enable maritime
communication services to be supported over 3GPP system in TS 22.119 [1]. With
the MARCOM feature, the work on maritime communication services is officially
included in the scope of 3GPP standardization so 3GPP enabling technologies
can be applicable to for maritime usage from 3GPP Release 16 onwards.
The first 3GPP Technical Specification (TS) 22.119 [1] covering service
requirements (Stage 1) is specified for the support of maritime communication
(MARCOM) over 3GPP systems.
The maritime domain, one of the 5G vertical domains in 3GPP, is moving forward
with the digitalisation and mobilisation of commercial as well as safety
fields. Legacy 3GPP-based technologies and solutions can be beneficial to the
digitalisation and mobilisation of the maritime domain though some of the
legacy 3GPP enabling technologies and solutions may not be able to fully
support the performances required by the maritime domain. The maritime radio
environment was not originally considered by 3GPP when the technical
specifications and solutions were standardised for LTE and 5G.
However, most of the legacy mobile services and IoT services based on
capabilities of EPS and 5GS specified in 3GPP specifications are applicable to
maritime usage for the support of mobile broadband services, and for the
support of IoT services or machine-type communication services in a vessel at
sea.
In addition, there are service scenarios and requirements specified in 3GPP
specifications based on requirements of other related vertical domains (e.g.
public safety domain, automotive domain, factory automation domain, and
satellite industrial domain). Some requirements derived by service scenarios
from these related vertical domains are applicable to the maritime domain.
Thus, it is beneficial to use 3GPP enabling technologies developed to satisfy
those requirements for the maritime domain in terms of the economy of scale.
For example, satellite access is one of the 3GPP radio access networks
supported over the 5G system, so it is possible to provide seamless maritime
mobile services by integrating multiple access technologies including
satellite access depending on the service scenarios. In addition, Vertical LAN
that can replace Ethernet-based access are applicable to indoor maritime
mobile services inside a vessel.
MC Services specified in 3GPP specifications are applicable to commercial and
maritime safety fields. Some similarities exist between the public safety
domain and the maritime domain in terms of service scenarios that are
essentially the same. For example, in some situations, mobile communication
services are supported in spite of disconnected networks, i.e. off-network
mode, or under isolated conditions.
However, the maritime domain also has specific situations that do not happen
in other vertical domains or in the legacy ICT industrial domain. New 3GPP
enabling technologies dedicated to the maritime domain can be used to address
such specific situations based on requirements derived from maritime use
cases. Other vertical domains may benefit from such new 3GPP enabling
technologies that consider maritime domain scenarios and may need more robust
technologies or solutions than those that currently exist for those vertical
domains.
The stage 1 requirements in TS 22.119 [1] are specific to maritime usage over
3GPP system for commercial as well as safety purposes. The stage 1
requirements derived from specific maritime usage but also related to MCX
Services are specified in 3GPP technical specifications dedicated to MCX
Services [2] [3] [4] [5].

Summary based on the input provided by SyncTechno Inc. in SP-200343.
The ePWS feature enhances the Public Warning System by defining behaviours for
UEs with no user interface or with a user interface that is incapable of
displaying text-based Warning Notifications and providing how to improve the
comprehension of a Warning Notification to users with disabilities who have
UEs supporting assistive technologies beyond text assistive technologies and
users who are not fluent in the language of the Warning Notifications. In
addition, additional requirements are specified for PWS-UEs and ePWS-UEs that
play the role of a relay UE or a remote UE to conform behaviours when
receiving a Warning Notification via the relay functionality. The requirements
can be found in TS 22.268 [1] and corresponding solutions in TS 23.041 [2].
Additional requirements for an enhanced Public Warning System (ePWS) are
specified as an update to Technical Specification (TS) 22.268 [1].
3GPP Public Warning Systems were first specified in Release 8, allowing for
direct warnings to be sent to mobile users on conventional User Equipment
(PWS-UE), capable of displaying a text-based and language-dependent Warning
Notification.
Since that time, there has been a growth in the number of mobile devices with
little or no user interface - including wrist bands, sensors and cameras --
many of which are not able to display Warning Notifications. The recent growth
in the number of IoT devices - not used by human users \-- also highlights the
need for an alternative to text based Warning Notifications. If those devices
can be made aware of the type of incident (e.g. a fire or flood) in some other
way than with a text message, then they may take preventive actions (e.g. lift
go to ground floor automatically).
The ePWS feature also specifies how graphical symbols or images can now be
used to better disseminate Warning Notifications, specifically aimed at the
following categories of users:
\- Users with disabilities who have UEs supporting assistive technologies
beyond text assistive technologies; and
\- Users who are not fluent in the language of the Warning Notifications.
Much of the work on enhancing the Public Warning System is set out in the ePWS
requirements in TS 22.268 [1] and in ePWS protocol solutions in TS 23.041 [2]
in Release 16, covering:
\- Specifying Message Identifiers for ePWS-UE, especially IoT devices that are
intended for machine type communications
\- Enabling language-independent content to be included in Warning
Notifications
The work on ePWS in TS 22.268 [1] and TS 23.041 (Release 16) is expected to
help manufacturers of User Equipment meet any future regulatory requirements
dedicated to such products.
Requirements defined for PWS-UEs in clause 4 of TS 22.268 [1] are applicable
for ePWS-UEs unless dedicated ePWS-UE requirements described in clause 9 of TS
22.268 [1] supersede them.

Summary based on the input provided by CATT, TD-Tech in SP-201001.
This WI defines the system architecture and a set of UE API functions that
allow the Mission Critical applications to access the MBMS capabilities
without implementing the logic of MBMS operations. The MBMSAPI_MCS intends to
offer the API within the UE to ease the development of Mission Critical
Services across different phone platforms, and to provide decoupling between
the platform MBMS functions and the mission critical application call control
functions.
The WI defines the system architecture for the UE API that complies with GCSE
as defined in TS 23.468 [2], and the API functions that support the use of
MBMS transmission for Mission Critical services as defined in TS 23.280 [3],
TS 23.379 [4], TS 23.281 [5] and TS 23.282 [6].
The following API functions have been specified with the corresponding
procedures and parameters for the Mission Critical applications to:
\- Obtain the MBMS SAI or cell information of the UE and the relevant updates;
\- Perform registration or deregistration for a Mission Critical application
for its access to the MBMS service on the UE;
\- Exchange information about an announced or de-announced MBMS bearer with
the API provider on the UE;
\- Get notified about events related to the MBMS bearer availability and
quality;
\- Start or close the reception of a given media delivered over MBMS;
\- Retrieve the capabilities (e.g. FEC and ROHC) from the API provider on the
UE.

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in SP-190865.
Mission critical (MC) services security enhancements provide the
confidentiality, integrity, user authentication, service authorization and
overall security architecture for the Release 16 mission critical features
(MCPTT, MCVideo, MCData, MC Location, MC Interworking, MC Interconnection, and
MC Railway).
Release 16 expands on the mission critical security architecture already
defined in previous releases along with various mission critical security
clarifications and corrections.
In this release, mission critical security adds user service authorization for
the mission critical location service. Similar to user service authorization
for the other MC services, an appropriately scoped access token is obtained
from the Identity Management server which permits only authorized users to
access the MC location service.
MCData payload protection is enhanced to support separate algorithm types for
the MCData payload field and the signalling parameters field, Data signalling
payload field and end to end security parameters fields. This allows the
architecture to meet varying security needs of the mission critical operator
for both on and off network MCData operational scenarios.
Security for interconnection now combines the MC gateway, Interconnection
Signalling (IS) proxy and HTTP proxy to provide topology hiding, HTTP
protection and signalling protection for inter-domain MCPTT, MCData and
MCVideo communications between two disparate mission critical systems for a
complete interconnection security solution.
The security foundation for dynamic rekeying of 3GPP interworking mission
critical users across the IWF from a Land Mobile Radio system is further
enhanced to support pre-provisioning of interworking key management records.
The KMS provides these records to the UE (i.e. mission critical user) during
service authorization to establish the initial key material needed to support
protection of interworking communications.

Summary based on the input provided by Expway.
This work item summary reports on standardization of the "xMB extension for
mission critical services (MC_XMB)" specified in [1].
To deliver group communications over MBMS, MCPTT and MCVideo make use of GCSE
(Group Communication System Enabler), where MBMS bearers are activated and
managed over MB2-C by the mission critical applications servers to
transparently transport any packets pushed over MB2-U.
To ensure reliable and efficient transport of files over a unidirectional and
lossy channel such as MBMS requires a dedicated protocol stack. SA4, in the
conclusion of the TR 26.881 [4], recommends reuse of the MBMS download
delivery method for MCData file distribution, which is supported by the
xMB/MBMS API interfaces.
In the context of this for MCData file distribution, different extensions have
been required.
First of all, in TS 26.348 [2], several functions to the xMB interfaces have
been added:
\- QOS management: The ability for a mission critical solution provider to
control precisely the allocation of network resources has been added.
\- Target geographical management: Geographical area semantics in xMB have be
aligned with the MB2-C AVP for mission critical services
\- TMGI exposure: the TMGI allocated during the MBMS session creation has been
exposed.
Moreover, in TS26.346 [3] a new service announcement mode named "self-
contained" mode has been added, indicating that the service announcement
metadata for this service is delivered in-band with the data (i.e. in the same
MBMS bearer).
All these functions have been integrated to ensure an efficient usage of the
MBMS download delivery method for MCData file distribution

Summary based on the input provided by L3Harris.
This Stage 2 work item provides architectural features to support interworking
between Mission Critical systems and Land Mobile Radio systems in the specific
areas of Group Calls, Emergency Calls, Group Regroups, Unit to Unit Calls,
user location, functional aliases and encryption.
The main impacts to the 3GPP MC system architecture introduced by this work
item are the enhancements to enable users engaged in public safety scenarios
to interwork between MC systems and LMR Radio Systems. Features such as Group
Call (one to many), group emergency notifications, grouping of users and
grouping of groups (for gathering many users on the same group), and
functional aliases are all common in Land Mobile Radio systems and novel to
3GPP MC systems. Features such as unit to unit call, user location and traffic
encryption are common to both types of systems but needed integration. This
eMCCI work item provides the means to utilize these features across the two
types of systems. Other work performed in TS 23.280 and TR 23.379 and various
work items enable the features in the 3GPP MC system architecture.
Note: Stage 3 was not completed at the time when this summary was introduced
in the present document (Dec. 2020).

Summary based on the input provided by at&t in SP-201083.
The following Mission Critical Data functionalities have been introduced in
Rel-16:
(a) A new network-based MCData message store has been added to allow a MCData
user to store its MCData communication history permanently by providing
secured storage area for each authorized MCData user having a user account. A
user (i.e. a dispatcher) other than the user account holder shall be able to
access the account holder\'s storage area if authorized. A user can
synchronize his MCData message store account with his devices (UEs) to get
consistent user experience across all his devices.
(b) A new network based MCData content server has been added to allow file
distribution indirectly; this function was implemented in the MCData server in
R15. As a standalone network entity, the MCData content server provides
complete functions of shared file cycle management and takes away processing
burden from the MCData server and increasing its MCData communication
capacity.
(c) IP Connectivity is now supported. The non MCData clients can use the IP
connectivity feature between two MCData client to exchange data payloads.
(d) Introduction of MC Gateway server for flexible interconnection.
(e) Supports of functional alias. A MCData user can connect to other MCData
users based on the functional alias they are registered.
(f) Supports of emergency alert function for all MCData services.
(g) MBMS supports for file distribution. With file has been uploaded to the
MCData content server, the MCData server uses MBMS to efficiently deliver the
file to the recipients. For any missing parts of the file, the recipient can
retrieve it directly from the MCData content server where the file was
uploaded.
(h) Share of user location information. The sender's location information can
be shared with the recipient for all MCData services.
The architecture, protocol, and security aspects of the MCData service related
to these enhancements are described in the following specifications:
1\. The architecture (including information flows, procedures, and
configuration) is specified in TS 23.282 and TS 23.280;

Summary based on the input provided by Sepura Ltd; L3Harris Technologies in
SP-201111.
For Release 16 implementation, the MCCI work was contained in two work items:
MCCI for stage 2 and MCCI_CT for stage 3.
Interworking between MC systems and LMR systems allows the systems to be
connected for the purpose of carrying calls and data messaging between the
participants in both systems.
For Release 16, the purpose of the LMR interworking enhancements to the MC
system was to enable interconnection of a MCPTT or MCData system to an LMR
system to support MCPTT and MCData SDS interworking, based on Stage 3
implementation of the Stage 2 TS 23.283 architectures, procedures and
functional flows developed during Release 15. The general architectural
principle was to define a logical Interworking Function (IWF) (representing an
LMR system) on a Mission Critical (MCPTT or MCData) server to allow a server
-- server based connection between the IWF and the MC system, and develop the
procedures and functional flows for an IWF by basing them on those already
identified for the corresponding server-server communication within the MC
system.
An IWF is composed of two parts: the first is an interface to the relevant MC
server: IWF-1 (based on a subset of the MCPTT reference points described in TS
23.379), IWF-2 (based on a subset of the MCData reference points described in
TS 23.282) and IWF-3 between the IWF and the Group Management Server. The
second part of the IWF is an interface to the LMR system based on reference
points defined by the LMR system. This provides a generic architecture to
interwork between LMR systems such as TETRA, P25 and DMR, as well as a
framework for interworking with other non-MC systems -- e.g. GSM-R. An
illustration of this for MCData interworking is in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Illustration of Interworking architecture for MCData SDS
The subsequent documentation approach in Stage 3 was to document the
differences between existing relevant MCPTT / MCData functionality and the
primitives & process needed for the same purpose in interworking. The late
completion of the Stage 2 meant that the Release-16 Stage 3 developed
initially based on the Release 15 Stage 2 described in TS 23.283.
The features that have been completed are :
a) affiliation;
b) group calls;
c) private calls;
d) broadcast calls;
e) temporary calls;
f) emergency calls and alerts;
g) talker location;
h) floor control;
i) codec negotiation;
j) short data service, including status;
k) 3GPP encryption; and
l) messaging and configuration support for LMR based key management and end-
to-end encryption.
The architecture, protocol, and security aspects of MCCI are described in the
following specifications:
1\. The architecture (including information flows, procedures, and
configuration) is specified in TS 23.283.
2\. The protocol aspects for MCPTT call control and media plane are specified
in TS 29.379 and TS 29.380 respectively;
3\. The protocol aspects for MCData call control are specified in TS 24.952;
4\. The security aspects are specified in TS 33.180.

### 12.4.6 Enhanced Mission Critical Push-to-talk architecture phase 2
* * *
800022 **Enhanced Mission Critical Push-to-talk architecture phase 2**
enh2MCPTT S6 SP-190068 Dom Lazara; Motorola Solutions
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Motorola Solutions in SP-201114.
For Release 16, the enhancements to the MCPTT service were contained in three
work items: enh2MCPTT for stage 2 (SA6), Enhanced Mission Critical Push-to-
talk architecture phase 2; enh2MCPTT-CT for stage 3 (CT1), CT aspects of
enh2MCPTT; and MCXSec for stage 2 and 3 (SA3), Mission Critical Services
Security Enhancements. The corresponding items which have been completed in
Release 16 are described in the following clause.
These enhancements to the MCPTT service impact the following areas of the
architecture and protocols: call control and media handling, configuration,
and security.
The following features have been newly introduced or enhanced.
[Group and user regrouping using preconfigured group]{.underline}
\- Regroup using a preconfigured group refers to the creation of a user or
group regroup based on the configuration information associated with an
existing group that is referred to as the preconfigured group. This type of
regroup takes its entire configuration from the preconfigured group, including
initial security information. Since all MCPTT clients participating in the
regroup operation are already configured with the preconfigured group
information, this allows immediate use of the regroup for a group call upon
initiation of the regroup.
\- A regroup using a preconfigured group is initiated without the creation of
a new group document in the group management server. The advantage of regroup
using a preconfigured group is speed of setup of the regroup, especially when
large numbers of users (e.g. hundreds) may be involved. Control of the regroup
using a preconfigured group is contained in the MCPTT server (namely the
controlling MCPTT function). Creation and removal of a regroup is initiated by
an authorized MCPTT client. Removal of the regroup can also be initiated by
the MCPTT server based on certain criteria.
\- A group regroup may be achieved by regrouping MCPTT groups into a new MCPTT
regroup group which uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured MCPTT
group.
\- A user regroup may be achieved by regrouping MCPTT users into a new regroup
group which uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured MCPTT group.
\- The MCPTT regroup group can be specified to be a broadcast or non-broadcast
type according to the configuration of the MCPTT group specified in the
regroup request.
\- The broadcast type of regroup is used for one-way communication where only
an authorized MCPTT user is allowed to transmit and all other regroup users
are only allowed to receive the communication (e.g. a call from a dispatcher
to all regroup members).
\- The non-broadcast type is used for two-way communication where all
regrouped users can transmit and receive (i.e. a normal group call).
[Location enhancements for current talker and ambient listening]{.underline}
\- Location of a current talker is a feature that allows the initiator of a
group or private call transmission to share his current location via the media
plane with every transmission (floor request that is granted). Based on
privacy settings, the talker's location is delivered to the other affiliated
members of the group, or to the receiving user in the private call.
\- The ambient listening call is a type of a private MCPTT call that only
allows a \"listened to\" user to transmit media to a \"listening\" user such
that there is no indication on the MCPTT UE of the \"listened to\" user about
the call and the media transmission.
\- Remotely initiated ambient listening is initiated by the authorized user
(e.g., dispatcher) who wants to listen to another user. In this case, the
\"listened to\" user is the called party, and shall automatically accept the
call without causing any indication about the call and transmit the media to
the \"listening\" user.
\- Locally initiated ambient listening is initiated by an authorized user who
wants another user to listen to the MCPTT UE communication. In this case, the
\"listened to\" user is the calling party and shall automatically transmit the
media to the \"listening\" user without causing any indication about the call
processing and media transmission.
\- Enhancements have been made to more reliably deliver location via the media
plane in the scenarios listed above.
[Enhancements for entering or existing a geographic area]{.underline}
\- Geographical affiliation and de-affiliation is a feature that allows an
authorized MCPTT user to define a geographical area for the purposes of
causing the target MCPTT client to affiliate to a group when within this
geographic area. Upon leaving the geographic area the target MCPTT client is
sent an indication to de-affiliate. The MCPTT system keeps track of the target
MCPTT user's location and sends an indication to the MCPTT client upon
entering or exiting the geographic area.
\- Geographical sending of an emergency alert is a feature that allows an
authorized MCPTT user to define a geographical area for the purposes of
causing the target MCPTT client to send an emergency alert when within this
geographic area. Upon leaving the geographic area the target MCPTT client
sends an emergency alert cancel. The MCPTT system keeps track of the MCPTT
user's location and sends an indication to the target MCPTT client upon
entering or exiting the emergency alert area.
\- Enhancements have been made to the polygon and ellipsoid-arc definition of
area to more reliably define location when entering or existing the geographic
area of interest.
[Secure tunnel between key management server and key management
client]{.underline}
\- The establishment of a direct secure tunnel between the mission critical
key management server and the mission critical key management client is
required. Such a direct TLS tunnel needs to be an option for mission critical
agencies that require stronger security.
The requirements, architecture, protocol, and security aspects related to
these enhancements are described in the following specifications:
1\. The MCPTT service requirements are specified in TS 22.179 and TS 22.280;
2\. The MCPTT service architecture (including information flows, procedures,
and configuration) is specified in TS 23.379 and TS 23.280;

### 13.1.1 Coverage and Handoff Enhancements for Multimedia (CHEM)
* * *
810003 **Coverage and Handoff Enhancements for Multimedia** CHEM S4 SP-180664
Nikolai Leung
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in SP-190865.
The Coverage and Handoff Enhancements for Multimedia (CHEM) feature enables
the network to delay or reduce handoffs of a Multimedia Telephony Service for
IMS ( MTSI) terminal by providing the eNB/gNB additional information about the
robustness to packet losses of the negotiated media configurations. The
eNB/gNB can set handoff thresholds that allow the MTSI terminal to remain on
the current sector, cell, access technology, or domain (packet-switched vs.
circuit-switched) and avoid a handoff even when the MTSI terminal experiences
higher packet loss on the traffic channel as the media configuration
robustness will help mitigate the effects of the additional packet losses.
The feature is structured with a baseline core functionality and some optional
enhancements as illustrated in Figure 1. The optional enhancements can be
independently used with the core CHEM feature and each other. TR 26.959 [1]
has also been updated to explain the operation and interaction of these
options and the core feature.
{width="3.8868055555555556in" height="3.165277777777778in"}
Figure 1: Core function and optional enhancements of the CHEM feature\
(references are to clauses in TS 26.114 [6]).
The core CHEM functionality specified in clauses W.1 and W.2 of TS 26.114 [2]
introduces the 'PLR_adapt' SDP attribute that is used to negotiate the CHEM
feature between the MTSI clients. MNOs choosing not to enable the feature can
remove the attribute in the SDP negotiation. The attribute is also used by the
PCRF/PCF to determine whether it can expect the MTSI clients to adapt to the
most robust configurations that have been negotiated without relying in
application layer redundancy. The PCRF/PCF uses this information to determine
the appropriate PLR thresholds, i.e., choosing the PLR of the most robust mode
when 'PLR_adapt' is negotiated, and communicate the PLR thresholds to the
eNB/gNB.
An optional enhancement specified in clause W.4 of TS 26.114 [2] enables the
MTSI clients to indicate the maximum tolerable end-to-end PLRs for particular
codec configurations and then negotiate how this end-to-end PLR can be
budgeted across their respective uplinks and downlinks. Indicating maximum
tolerable end-to-end PLR thresholds can be useful to account for differing
client implementations of features, e.g., such as the de-jitter buffer and
Packet-Loss-Concealment (PLC) in the media receiver, which can affect the
maximum tolerable PLR for achieving a certain Quality of Experience (QoE).
This enhancement uses the defined 'MAX-e2e-PLR' attribute and associated
parameters to perform the necessary indication and negotiation. The PCRF/PCF
uses the 'MAX-e2e-PLR' attribute information in the SDP answer to determine
and communicate the appropriate PLR thresholds to the eNB/gNB.
Another optional enhancement for speech media specified in clause W.3 of TS
26.114 [2] is to support use of application layer redundancy to improve media
robustness that, when used with the CHEM feature, can delay or avoid handing
off an MTSI terminal. The optional 'ALR' parameter for the 'PLR_adapt'
attribute has been specified to enable this option and allows the MTSI clients
to use newly specified in-band RTP CMR codepoints to request application layer
redundancy without having to use RTCP-APP messages. The PCRF/PCF uses the
presence of the 'PLR_adapt: ALR' attribute and parameter in the SDP answer to
determine the appropriate PLR thresholds based on the maximum tolerable PLRs
of the codec configurations (among those that both use, and do not use,
application layer redundancy), then communicates this to the eNB/gNB.
An Annex of TS 26.114 [2] provides example PLR values that can be used for
different speech codecs and their configurations. The annex also provides SDP
examples for using the specified SDP attributes and parameters.

Summary based on the inputs provided by China Unicom in SP-200129 for global
aspects and in RP-200152 for the radio aspects.
The work item of 5G_SRVCC introduced a mechanism to support single radio voice
call continuity (SRVCC) from 5GS to UTRAN for the following scenarios:
\- Operators with both 5G Voice over IMS and LTE enabled, but no VoLTE.
\- Operators with no LTE (nor VoLTE).
\- Operators with both 5G Voice over IMS and VoLTE enabled, but the voice
service continuity may not be guaranteed if the VoLTE coverage provided by the
operators is not (ideal) complete, i.e. there are some "holes" of VoLTE
coverage.
This work item implemented the conclusion of the study for single radio voice
continuity from 5GS to 3G (FS_5G-SRVCC) which is specified in TR 23.756[4].
The main enhancements introduced by this work item are specified in TS
23.216[3].
The architecture of 5G-SRVCC is illustrated in Figure 2-1. A simplified MME
function (MME_SRVCC) was introduced to facilitate session transfer (SRVCC) of
the voice component to the CS domain. The support of N26 interface and Sv
interface is required for the MME_SRVCC.
{width="4.992361111111111in" height="2.7881944444444446in"}
Figure 1: 5G-SRVCC architecture
The 5G-SRVCC mechanism defined by this work item is an indirect SRVCC from NG-
RAN to UTRAN. When an UE moves out of the coverage of NG-RAN while a 5G voice
session over IMS (either a normal voice session or an emergency session) is
ongoing, a PS to CS handover procedure between 5GS and 3G CS is triggered by
the NG-RAN. The 5G-SRVCC procedure including two main parts:
\- 5GS to EPS handover using N26 procedure triggered by the NG-RAN.
\- PS-CS handover procedure initiated by the selected MME_SRVCC.
No E-UTRAN involved during the whole process. All the PDU sessions is released
by the request of AMF at the end of the 5G-SRVCC procedure.

**[Radio part]{.underline}**
In Rel-16, the WI "Single Radio Voice Call Continuity from 5G to 3G" was
approved (latest WID in RP-200151). This work item aims to specify the support
of SRVCC from 5GS to UTRAN in RAN. More specifically, the main objectives are
as follows:
\- Inter-RAT measurement to support voice service continuity from 5GS to UTRAN
[RAN2, RAN1].
\- Specify that the NG-RAN and UE in NR RRC connected mode support the UTRAN
cell measurement procedure, e.g. measurement configuration of target UTRAN
cells, and the measurement performing and reporting by UE.
\- Indirect Inter-RAT handover procedure to support voice service continuity
from 5GS to UTRAN [RAN2, RAN3].
\- Specify the procedures of SRVCC (including emergency call) in RAN, which
includes handover preparation between gNB and AMF, gNB and UE, and Handover
execution between UE to RNS etc.
\- Signalling of source RAT to target RAT at incoming SRVCC [RAN3].
\- UE capability reporting for supporting SRVCC [RAN2, RAN3].
\- Specify the transfer of UE capability information between UE, NG-RAN and
AMF.
\- RRM requirements to support voice service continuity from 5GS to UTRAN
[RAN4].
\- Requirements of NR handover to UMTS.
\- Requirements of NR- UMTS inter-RAT measurements.
The key functionalities are:
\- Support of the UTRAN cell measurement procedure for NR node and UE in NR
RRC connected mode. A new measurement object for UTRA is defined to include
only UTRA-FDD. - The UE is only required to measurement and report the listed
cells. Periodic and event triggered (event B1/B2) reporting for UTRA
measurement are both supported. The same measurement gap configuration for
UTRA is reused in measurement in NR as in LTE.
\- Support of inter-RAT handover procedure of SRVCC. MobilityFromNRCommand
message is reused for SRVCC from NR to UTRAN. SRVCC to UTRAN is also supported
for UEs configured with NR-DC and NE-DC, network can trigger SRVCC to UTRAN
procedure directly irrespective of the whether the bearer for the voice call
is anchored in SN or MN. When and how to perform the return procedure from
UTRAN to NR after the UE completes the voice service depends on UE
implementation.
\- Support of Signalling of source RAT to target RAT at incoming SRVCC. Add
5G-SRVCC possible into Initial Context Setup Request, HO Request, Path Switch
Request Ack. Clarify the source to target transparent container is source RNC
to target RNC Transparent Container in 5G-SRVCC. Clarify the target to source
transparent container is Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container in
5G-SRVCC.
\- Support of UE capability reporting for supporting SRVCC, including SRVCC
handover capability with FR1/FR2 and TDD/FDD split, and UTRA-FDD band list is
also reported.
\- RRM Requirements have also been specified, including measurement gap
applicability requirement for SRVCC, Measurement capability, CSSF, UMTS inter-
RAT measurement requirements and handover requirements for SRVCC.

### 13.1.4 EVS Floating-point Conformance for Non Bit-Exact
* * *
820001 **EVS Floating-point Conformance for Non Bit-Exact** EVS_FCNBE S4
SP-180983 Fabrice, Plante, Intel
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Intel in SP-191328.
The EVS_FCNBE work item provides improvements related to the 3GPP EVS codec:
this codec is standardized in three code versions such that it can be
implemented on processors with either fixed-point (TS 26.442, TS 26.452) or
floating-point arithmetic (TS 26.443). Implementations can be conformance-
tested using "bit-exact" methods that have been specified already when the EVS
codec was first standardized. These methods are suitable for fixed-point
implementations but their applicability is limited for floating-point
implementations. EVS_FCNBE provides methods which enable conformance testing
also for "non bit-exact" floating-point implementations.
During Rel-15, the FS_EVS_FCNBE study item investigated tools, conformance
process, and criteria for EVS floating-point non bit-exact conformance, and
documented in TR 26.843 [1] several recommendations. Based on the agreed
conclusions and recommendations of TR 26.843, the EVS_FCNBE work item
conducted normative work on TS 26.444 to introduce the non bit-exact
conformance process and criteria in the CR 26.444-0027.
The conformance process uses three specific tests:
\- Decoder test comparing the implementation decoder with TS 26.443 decoder.
\- Encoder test comparing the implementation encoder with TS 26.443 encoder.
\- MOS-LQO verification comparing the coder implementation with TS 26.442
coder.
These three tests allow to compare the implementation with the reference
floating point code in TS 26.443, and interoperability with the fixed-point
code in TS 26.442. All three tests shall pass for the implementation to be
declared conformant.
The decoder test relies on a set of signal-based metrics (RMS, SNR, and
Spectral Distortion). The encoder test uses a loudness metric. The MOS-LQO
test uses a set of metrics using objective quality measurements.
To define a range of acceptable variation for the various metrics, a set of 10
reference implementations (based on mainstream compilers and platforms) has
been used to define reference values.
Annex B of CR 26.444-0027 provides details on the tests as well as the
conformance process and criteria.
The results obtained during the course of the normative work indicate that
this conformance process correctly discriminates implementations with
functional code changes and aggressive compiler optimization.

**810040** **Media Handling Extensions for 5G Conversational Services**
**5G_MEDIA_MTSI_ext** **S4** **SP-180663** **Oyman, Ozgur, Company: Intel**
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Intel in SP-200036.
During Rel-15, the FS_5G_MEDIA_MTSI study item investigated media handling
aspects of conversational services in 5G, and documented in TR 26.919 several
recommendations on Multimedia Telephony Service over IMS (MTSI) in TS 26.114
around media rate adaptation, NR access and profiles for 5G deployments.
Based on the agreed conclusions and recommendations of TR 26.919,
5G_MEDIA_MTSI_ext conducted normative work, mostly on TS 26.114, to introduce
the following functionality:
\- For media rate adaptation, the CR 26.114-0436 [2] recommended additional
speech and video adaptation capabilities based on access network bitrate
recommendation (ANBR) (a.k.a. RAN-assisted codec adaptation) support. In
particular, this CR makes ANBR-triggered speech adaptation a recommended
feature in MTSI clients for Rel-16 and beyond. Moreover, it provides
additional recommendations for MTSI receivers to generate CMR/RTCP-APP (for
speech) and TMMBR (for video) and for MTSI senders to generate TMMBN (for
video) messages in response to receiving ANBR information.
\- On profiles for 5G deployments, the CR 26.114-0438 [3] defined the
constrained MTSI client terminal to address codec requirements for
IMS/VoLTE/ViLTE/VoNR conversational services in the low end 5G verticals such
as wearables and IoT. In particular, this CR relaxed the Rel-15 speech and
video codec requirements for these constrained terminals, e.g., resulting in
optional support for super-wideband for speech and HEVC for video,
exceptionally only for this special category of constrained terminals (support
for SWB for speech and HEVC for video is otherwise mandatory for Rel-15 and
beyond).
\- To realize further RAN-assisted codec adaptation enhancements, the CR
26.114-0461 [4] and CR 26.114-0480 [5] introduced ANBR capability signalling
into MTSI. In particular, the CRs standardized a new SDP attribute 'anbr' to
enable end-to-end signaling and coordination of ANBR capabilities (both at the
radio level and application level) across the UEs, Access Networks, and
PCRF/PCF. According to the adopted solution, the MTSI client in terminal
supporting \"anbr\" signals this attribute in the SDP only if: (i) MTSI client
in terminal supports ANBR at the application layer, including the use of ANBR
with dynamic bitrate adaptation. (ii) The UE of the MTSI client in terminal is
capable of RAN-assisted codec adaptation at the radio layer, including the
ability to query and receive ANBR information (both downlink and uplink ANBR)
from its eNB/gNB. (iii) The P-CSCF has indicated to the UE of the MTSI client
in terminal its ability to handle this SDP attribute through the respective
SIP registration procedures specified in TS 24.229 via the corresponding
feature capability indicator g.3gpp.anbr.
\- The low and ultra-low latency of 5G will enable new types of use cases with
real-time communication and interaction needs where it will be desirable to
not only have voice, text and video calling connectivity but also delivery of
any kind of data stream and real-time interaction within the same IMS
multimedia session. This is already enabled as part of the IMS-based Tele-
Presence service in TS 26.223 toward the exchange of CLUE messages and has
been introduced to MTSI in TS 26.114 as part of this work item to provide a
generic and flexible data channel support for IMS-based multimedia telephony.
In particular, CR 26.114-0496 [6] adds necessary UNI procedures to support
MTSI data channel based on WebRTC data channel and web scripting techniques as
a new MTSI media. This provides a generic and flexible data channel for MTSI
in TS 26.114 that allows both UE-to-UE and UE-to-network generic data
transfers, in addition to and in parallel with the existing MTSI media such as
audio, video, and text. Accordingly, TS 26.223 was also updated via CR
26.223-0013 [7] to align the data channel support of a Tele-Presence (TP) UE
with that specified in MTSI.

, Ericsson**
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-200128.
The experienced Virtual Reality (VR) quality is dependent on a good service
implementation as well as a fast and consistent transport network. To help
service providers and operators to measure and optimize aspects related to the
delivered VR service quality, specific VR-related metrics are useful.
The VRQoE Work Item added the following functionality:
\- Defined VR metrics observation points.
\- Metrics describing the characteristics of the VR device, such as
resolution, FOV etc.
\- Metrics describing the interaction delay, related to the time between head
movements and update of the visible content.
\- Extensions to the DASH Metrics configuration and reporting to support the
new metrics.
Also, the following metrics have been added into TS 26.118 [1]:
\- Comparable quality viewport switching latency: Reports the delay from head
movement until the media quality is restored to a similar quality level as
before the move.
\- Rendered viewports: Reports where the user mostly looks during the VR
session.
\- VR device information: Reports characteristics for the VR device.
The metrics are building on and extending the existing metrics in TS 26.247
[2], and are well aligned with the current proposal in MPEG [3]. Furthermore,
a requirement has been added to TS 26.234 [4] specifying that a VR-capable PSS
client should also support these metrics.

Summary based on the input provided by Intel in SP-190322.
This summary reports on the normative specification progress accomplished
during the course of the E2E_DELAY work item [1]. The related agreed CRs can
be found in Tdocs S4-181176 (CR 26.114-0441) [2], S4-181452 (CR 26.114-0443)
[3], S4-190167 (CR 26.114-0448) [4], S4-190497 (CR 26.114-0462) [5] and
S4-190498 (CR 26.114-0463) [6].
RAN delay budget reporting is specified in TS 36.331 for E-UTRA and TS 38.331
for NR. RAN delay budget reporting through the use of RRC signalling to eNB /
gNB allows UEs to locally adjust air interface delay. Based on the reported
delay budget information, a good coverage UE on the receiving end (i.e., the
UE that contains the MTSI receiver) can reduce its air interface delay, e.g.,
by turning off CDRX or via other means. This additional delay budget can then
be made available for the sending UE (i.e., the UE that contains the MTSI
sender), and can be quite beneficial for the sending UE when it suffers from
poor coverage. When the sending UE is in bad coverage, it would request the
additional delay from its local eNB / gNB, and if granted, it would utilize
the additional delay budget to improve the reliability of its uplink
transmissions in order to reduce packet loss, e.g., via suitable repetition or
retransmission mechanisms, and thereby improve end-to-end delay and quality
performance.
While RAN-level delay budget reporting as defined in TS 36.331 and TS 38.331
allows UEs (i.e., MTSI sender and MTSI receiver) to locally adjust air
interface delay, such a mechanism does not provide coordination between the
UEs on an end-to-end basis. To alleviate this issue, this work item defined a
new RTCP feedback message type in clause 7.3.8 of TS 26.114 to realize the
following capabilities on signalling of Delay Budget Information (DBI) across
UEs as per CRs 26.114-0443 in Tdoc S4-181452, 26.114-0448 in Tdoc S4-190167
and 26.114-0462 in Tdoc S4-190497: (i) an MTSI receiver can indicate available
delay budget to an MTSI sender, and (ii) an MTSI sender can explicitly request
delay budget from an MTSI receiver. Such RTCP-based signaling of DBI can also
be used by an MTSI receiver to indicate delay budget availability created via
other means such as jitter buffer size adaptation. The recipient UE of the
RTCP feedback message carrying DBI may then use this information in
determining what delay budget adjustments it may request from its eNB / gNB
over the RAN interface, e.g. by using RRC signalling based on
UEAssistanceInformation as defined in TS 36.331 and TS 38.331.
In addition, the work item specified a few further media handling aspects of
RAN delay budget reporting for MTSI in TS 26.114 to address the following:
1\. SDP-based exchange of RAN capabilities in regards to delay budget
reporting, this is specified in clause 6.2.8 and Annex V.3 of TS 26.114 as per
CR 26.114-0441 in Tdoc S4-181176 and CR 26.114-0463 in Tdoc S4-190498.
Accordingly, an MTSI client supporting DBI can offer this capability in SDP
for all media streams containing speech and/or video by including the a=rtcp-
fb attribute with the DBI type under the relevant media line scope as
expressed with the parameter 3gpp-delay-budget.
2\. Recommendations on when and how the UEs in an MTSI session should use RAN-
based delay adjustment mechanisms in an end-to-end fashion also accounting
other factors such as local radio conditions, various RAN capabilities and
configurations, jitter buffer considerations, and UE battery constraints.
These are provided as part of the informative signalling flows in Annex V of
TS 26.114, as per CR 26.114-0443 in S4-181452.
3\. Recommendations on when and how the various kinds of end-to-end quality
metrics and other relevant information in the MTSI client could be used to
trigger RAN delay budget reporting. These are provided as part of the
informative signalling flows in Annex V of TS 26.114, as per CR 26.114-0443 in
S4-181452.

### 13.1.8 Removal of H.263 and MPEG-4 Visual from 3GPP Services
Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-200801.
This work item has removed any normative statements related to H.263 and
MPEG-4 Visual from Rel-16 specifications (including TS 26.114, TS 26.140, TS
26.234, TS 26.346 and TS 26.244).
H.263 was a state-of-the art codec in the last millennium and made mobile
video possible and an actual reality. Many 3GPP specs adopted H.263, used for
the first mobile video deployments. However, more than 20 years later, this
format became obsolete and as such was removed from Rel-16 onwards.
In 2012 (Rel-11), 3GPP already addressed to change the status of H.263 and
MPEG-4 Video in several specifications, but did not fully remove the
technology for all services. Some leftover H.263 related statements remained,
as in TS 26.140. MPEG-4 Visual did not have any status in any spec, but many
leftovers still.
\"Retiring\" older codecs is needed due to the impact of codecs on hardware
and/or softwareincluding area size, design and testing, and then on the cost.
Supporting such codecs on 5G device would have reduced the available space for
other, newer, codecs and technologies. One can note that, despite a phone\' OS
provides a software codec for these formats, not all devices use this OS (e.g.
watches do not use it) and hence would have required custom H.263 integration.
Similar issues apply to MPEG-4 Visual.
The Technical Report is available in TR 26.928.

Summary based on the input provided by China Telecom in SP-200XYZ.
Mobile network operators are deciding to use LTE-base system to deliver great
stream communication services (eg. Video/HD/AR/VR). As the great stream
communication service (eg. video/HD/AR/VR)is a ideal type business to improve
operator , but in the reality network, we(operators) find very little users to
consume these services on LTE rather to use free wifi. The key factor of
enabling the "anywhere, anytime" reachability is to reduce to cost of resource
to consume video/HD/AR/VR services. Ideally, RAN may request delay tolerate
data from GW or cache or any other entity when RAN has spare resource to save
the network transmission resource. However, currently this mechanism is not
successfully supported over LTE. The mechanism for OTT video may also need to
be studied and defined on backhaul interfaces and potentially SGi interface.
This technical report is to study potential service requirements for
optimization of both Over-The-Top and operator managed streaming service
considering possible use cases e.g. caching, content-aware service delivery,
delay tolerate delivery, local streaming transmission etc. Operators see
benefit to include it in a new study.
Support of stream service have been accepted in TS22.115 [2] and TS22.278 [3].
No stage 2 and stage 3 changes were needed.
The work item eLSTR provides the stage 1 specifications to include
1) Identifying the potential new service scenarios and requirements for
video/HD/AR/VR services over LTE-based system, eg. delay tolerant content
delivery; UE caching; Video transmission optimization(video-aware by RAN);
2) Identifying related policy, charging and authentication requirements.

Summary based on the input provided by Sony Europe B.V. in SP-200848.
This summary reports on the normative specification progress accomplished
during the course of the 5GMS3 work item [1]. Three new specifications have
been produced as a result of the work in 5GMS3, namely on the following
aspects:
\- Speech and audio profiles, in TS 26.117 [2];
\- Profiles, Codecs and Formats, in TS 26.511 [3];
\- Protocols, in TS 26.512 [4].
One change request on the existing specification TS 26.247 [5] has also been
produced, which adds the specification of the usage of the Common Media
Application Format (CMAF) for segmented media as the baseline container format
for 5GMS downlink streaming services.
The work item 5GMS3 provides the stage 3 specifications to enable the
realization of media streaming services based on the 5G Media Streaming
Architecture, specified in TS 26.501 [6]. The stage 3 specifications cover
speech, audio and video media formats and profiles, protocols -- which are
specified in accordance with the REST/HTTP principles adopted by the CT groups
-- and the ingest of media content into the 5GMS for downlink unicast content
delivery services.

Lionel, ESA
Summary based on the input provided by ESA in SP-200943.
Positioning features and high-accuracy are becoming more and more important
for many verticals involved with 5G.
This work item specifies functional requirements as well as KPI to support
enhanced positioning services in the 5G systems. It addresses a wide variety
of services and use cases, including (but not limited to) regulatory
requirements in support of emergency calls and first responder operations, new
services in multiple verticals covering for instance industry, logistics,
eHealth and aerial.
Emphasis has been put, among other, on improving accuracy, seamless
positioning in the entire 5G coverage, flexibility, features to further enable
and combine multiple positioning technologies RAT-dependent, RAT-independent
such as GNSS and TBS). The work also covers energy efficiency of the
positioning function, being key for many use cases such as, for instance,
asset tracking.
The work item 5G_HYPOS provides the stage 1 specifications to enable enhanced
and more accurate positioning in 5G systems. The positioning services and
specifications aim multiple service levels involving different types of UE
(e.g. UE for Location Based Services, asset tracking devices, machine-type UE,
transportation, etc.), and which can refer to RAT-dependent positioning
technologies, RAT-independent positioning technologies (e.g. GNSS, TBS),
and/or a combination of several of those.
Functional requirements for positioning services are reported in chapter 6.27
of TS 22.261 [2]. They cover aspects such as configuration of the positioning
service capabilities and features, for instance to allow the operators to
manage the combination and hybridization of multiple positioning technologies
or to report positioning related information to authorized third parties.
KPI for positioning services are reported in chapter 7.3 of TS 22.261 [2].
Several KPIs, such as accuracy, availability, coverage (indoor, outdoor, 5G
positioning service area or 5G enhanced positioning service area, etc.) are
sorted in 7 Positioning Service Levels, with accuracy ranging from 10 meters
for Service Level 1 down to 0.2 meters for Service Level 7. These Service
Levels have been coordinated with the needs of industry automation use cases,
as specified in TS 22.104 (Service requirements for cyber-physical control
applications in vertical domains, [3]), to facilitate the work in subsequent
working groups.
Finally, as the work also identified the importance of trusted positioning
information to support regulatory and commercial applications, some
requirements relating to the integrity and protection of the positioning
information and measurements have been introduced in chapter 8.7 of TS 22.261
[2].
The requirements have translated into work in subsequent working groups (SA2,
SA3, RAN) and for RAN, in new specifications in: TS 38.215 (NR Physical Layer
measurements, [4]), TS 38.305 (Stage 2 functional specification of UE
positioning in NG-RAN, [5]), TS 37.355 (LTE Positioning Protocol, [6]), TS
38.455 (NR Positioning Protocol A, [7]) and TS 38.331 (UE radio transmission
and reception, [8]) which defines evolution of RAT-dependent technologies for
NR, as well as it introduces new features and capabilities in LPP to enable
cm-level accuracy positioning with High-Accuracy GNSS (HAGNSS). These
specifications address UE-based, UE-assisted methods, and broadcast of
information / corrections using RRC System Information messages.
The performance targets for RAT-dependent techniques in Release 16 NR

In addition, the existing RRM measurements were reused for NR E-CID support:
CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ.
**Downlink positioning reference signal** (DL PRS): they are allocated and
transmitted periodically with configurable periodicity and time offset with
respect to SFN0. The DL PRS configuration is done per DL positioning frequency
layer that defines multiple DL PRS resource sets associated with different
transmission/reception points (TRPs) and characterized by the same DL PRS
subcarrier spacing, transmission bandwidth, cyclic prefix length, DL PRS Point
A and offset with respect to DL PRS Point A. DL PRS resource set may contain
multiple DL PRS resources, where each DL PRS resource is associated with
certain spatial transmission direction of DL PRS from a given TRP (beam) and
characterized by configurable number of symbols, resource element pattern,
initial comb-offset, offset in slots, symbols and DL PRS sequence ID.
DL PRS is single port signal that can be configured as quasi-collocated with
SSB index or other DL PRS resources. The configuration of DL PRS is provided
as a part of UE assistance information. DL PRS transmissions can be muted
according to configured bitmaps for each DL PRS resource set that control the
DL PRS resource set transmission period or DL PRS resource repetition
transmission within a DL PRS transmission period.
**Uplink sounding reference signals for positioning** : they are defined based
on NR UL SRS with modified staggered RE pattern and disabled frequency
hopping. The UL SRS for positioning are defined through configuration of UL
SRS resource sets for positioning, where each set may contain multiple UL SRS
resources for positioning. UL SRS resource for positioning is characterized by
number of symbols, transmission bandwidth, RE pattern, time offset and may be
associated with UE TX beam. UL SRS resources for positioning can be spatially
related with SSB indexes or DL PRS resource index as well as reference signal
for UL open loop power control towards serving and neighbor cells (defined for
UL SRS for positioning).
LMF may recommend the spatial relation and pathloss reference to the gNB for
SRS configuration. LMF may also request activation and deactivation of non-
periodic SRS transmission to the gNB.
**Broadcast of Assistance Data** : this can be included in positioning System
Information Blocks (posSIBs) which are carried in RRC System Information (SI)
messages. The UE may request posSI by means of on-demand SI request in
RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and also request posSIBs by means of on-demand SI
request in RRC_ CONNECTED.
For each assistance data element, a separate posSIB-type is defined. Each
posSIB may be ciphered by the LMF using the 128-bit Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) algorithm (with counter mode), either with the same or
different ciphering key.
**RAT independent positioning techniques:** PPP and RTK, are already supported
in Rel-15 LPP. In Rel-16, LPP is extended to support GNSS SSR (PPP-RTK
support) based on the "Compact SSR" definitions specified for QZSS for both
LTE and NR. Following additional information are added to be transferred from
the LMF to UE:
\- SSR Phase Bias
\- SSR STEC Corrections
\- SSR Gridded Correction
\- SSR URA
\- SSR Correction Points
**Positioning network architecture:** In the positioning architecture
specified in TS 38.305 and TS 38.401, the LMF is connected to the NG-RAN node
through the AMF. The NG-RAN node may control several TRPs. Both split (i.e.
CU/DU) and non-split NG-RAN architectures are supported. The NRPPa and the
F1AP protocols have been extended to support the positioning methods listed
above.
**UE DL PRS processing requirements:** For defined physical layer measurements
DL-RSTD, DL PRS-RSRP and UE Rx-Tx time difference in Rel16, the requirements
on the measurement time were defined. These requirements are applicable for
the case when measurement gap is configured to UE. The UE processing
capabilities specified in TS 37.355 are taken into account to derive total DL
PRS measurement delay.
**Measurement gaps:** On top of legacy measurement gap patterns, the new
measurement gap patterns with > 6ms measurement gap length (MGL) were
introduced in Rel16 for NR positioning.
MG length (ms) MG period (ms)
* * *
20 160 10 80
These two gap patterns can be requested by the UE and configured by the
network only when the UE is configured via LPP with NR positioning
measurements and can only be used during the corresponding positioning
measurement period. The supported measurement gaps are applicable for DL PRS
and NR/LTE RRM measurements i.e. new gaps are not shared between PRS and 2G/3G
RRM measurements.

Summary based on the input provided by Deutsche Telekom AG in SP-200131.
The feature allows the use of a User Identifier [1], which is independent of
existing identifiers relating to a 3GPP subscription or UE, for Network Slice-
Specific Authentication and Authorization. [1][2][3]
The actual identity provisioning service with creation, managing and
authentication of identities is not specified by 3GPP, but the interworking of
the 3GPP system with some external entity to authenticate the User Identity
and to authorize the user for access to a specific network slice, in addition
to the 3GPP network slice selection and authorization.
Rel. 15 Network slice selection (i.e. the procedure to select an AMF that
supports the required Network Slices and establishing PDU Session(s) to the
required Data network via the Network Slice instance(s) with its Control Plane
and User Plane Network Functions) is based on the NSSAI, which consists of one
or more S-NSSAIs.
Now with the Rel. 16 feature, Subscription information allows the indication
which S-NSSAIs are subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization (NSSAA). For those S-NSSAIs the AMF invokes an EAP-based Network
Slice-Specific authentication procedure in which the AUSF exchanges AAA
protocol messages with a potentially external AAA Server (AAA-S) via an
optional AAA Proxy (AAA-P) to authenticate and authorize a UE for the network
slice. Depending on the result of the procedure a UE is either authorized for
a network slice, re-allocated to a different one or deregistered. A re-
authentication and re-authorization procedure may be triggered by the AAA
Server at any time. [2][3]
Security aspects are specified in detail in [4], UE and network capabilities
to support and perform NSSAA in [5], message flows for interworking to the
AAA-S in [6], flags to indicate that a slice is subject to NSSAA are defined
in [7] as well as [8] and the impact on the AUSF is captured in [9].

Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-201113.
The \"Multi-device and multi-identity\" (MUD) Feature enables the realization
of the IMS enhancement for Multi-device and multi-identity.
With the increasing number of smart devices having call capabilities, the
number of IMS-capable devices a single user can use also increases. GSMA RILTE
have been working with specifying multi-device solutions and asked 3GPP to
create requirements for all their use cases to be specified. This work item
specifies the user experience requirements for a consistent user experience
when the user uses these services.
Furthermore, the work also covers use cases where a user can allow another
user (or possibly the same user) to use one or more of its identities. One
example is for a user wishing to be able to use the work identity for the
private phone. I.e. originated calls should show the work identity and
terminating calls to the work identity should go to the private phone and
include information that the work identity is called. Another example is to
use a group identity, where employees can make calls on behalf of the group or
firm and calls to the group are distributed to any member of the group.
The Multi-Device (MuD) service is an operator specific service which enables a
user to use different UEs that are registered under the same public user
identity. The UEs can be of different types (e.g. phone, tablet, wearable
device, PC) and can support a communication log.
The Multi-Identity (MiD) service is an operator specific service which enables
a user to use different identities. A served user can use a single UE to
receive calls addressed to any of its identities and to make calls using any
of its identities.
The MuD and MiD services can be used at the same time.
The Stage 1 requirements are document in chapter 4.6 in TS 22.173 [2]. No
architecture changes were needed, and stage 3 were defined in the CT1 WID [5]
and resulted in TS 24.174 [6] and TS 24.175 [7].

Summary based on the input provided by ZTE Wistron Telecom AB in SP-200125.
The objective of this work item is to address the following aspects:
\- Enhance the network slicing interworking support from EPC to 5GC, when UE
moves from EPC to 5GC by selecting the proper target serving AMF as well as
V-SMF. Note that, the 5GC may not be able to serve all the PDU sessions that
the UE intends to move from EPC.
\- Provide the network slice based authentication and authorization that uses
User Identities and Credentials different from the 3GPP SUPI and that takes
place after the primary authentication.
Release 16 Network Slicing addresses two major limitations of Release 15 in
5GC:
(1) Enhancement of interworking between EPC and 5GC when UE moves from EPC to
5GC, the target serving AMF may not be able to serve all the PDU sessions that
the UE intends to move to the 5GC. More specifically, the following aspects
needs to be addressed:
\- Selecting an AMF based on the slices associated to the active PDU
connections that serve the UE in the EPC in Connected mode and during the Idle
mode mobility
\- Selecting an appropriate serving V-SMF based on the slices associated to
the active PDN connections that serve the UE in the EPC in Connected Mode
(2) Support for Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization
(NSSAA)
\- Enable the support for separate authentication and authorization per
Network Slice. The trigger of NSSAA in the 5GC is based on UE subscription
information from UDM and also operator's policy. However, the UE shall
indicate its support for NSSAA to its serving 5GC.
\- The AMF performs the role of the EAP Authenticator and communicates with
the AAA-S via the AUSF. The AUSF undertakes any AAA protocol interworking with
the AAA protocol supported by the AAA-S.
**[Enhancement of Interworking Between EPC and 5GC]{.underline}**
During the mobility from EPS to 5GS, in case of CM-IDLE state, the PGW-C+SMF
sends PDU Session IDs and related S-NSSAIs to AMF in Registration procedure.
The AMF derives S-NSSAI values for the Serving PLMN and determines whether the
current AMF is appropriate to serve the UE. If not, the AMF reallocation may
need to be triggered. For each PDU Session the AMF determines whether the
V-SMF need to be reselected based on the associated S-NSSAI value for the
Serving PLMN. If the V-SMF need be reallocated, the AMF trigger the V-SMF
reallocation.
In case of CM-CONNECTED state, during handover preparation phase the PGW-C+SMF
sends PDU Session IDs and related S-NSSAIs to AMF. Based on the received
S-NSSAIs values, the target AMF derives the S-NSSAI values for the Serving
PLMN, the target AMF reselects a final target AMF if necessary and forwards
the handover request to the final target AMF. When the Handover procedure
completes successfully, the UE proceeds with the Registration procedure. For
each PDU Session based on the associated derived S-NSSAI values, if the V-SMF
need be reallocated, the final target AMF triggers the V-SMF reallocation. The
final target AMF sends the S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN to V-SMF to
update the SM context. The V-SMF updates NG RAN with the S-NSSAI value for the
Serving PLMN via N2 SM message.
**[Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
(NSSAA)]{.underline}**
In Release-16, based on UE's 5GMM Core Network Capability and subscription
information, the serving AMF will trigger Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization for the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN. If a UE does
not support this feature but requests these S-NSSAIs that are subject to
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, these S-NSSAIs will
be rejected by the PLMN.
If a UE supports this feature and requests these S-NSSAIs, which are subject
to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, the UE shall
leverage the corresponding credentials for these S-NSSAIs for the Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization. As for how to these
credentials in the UE are not specified.
To perform the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for an
S-NSSAI, the AMF invokes an EAP- based Network Slice-Specific authorization
procedure for the S-NSSAI.
This procedure can be invoked for a supporting UE by an AMF at any time, e.g.
when:
a. The UE registers with the AMF and one of the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN which
maps to an S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI is requiring Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization; or
b. The Network Slice-Specific AAA Server triggers a UE re-authentication and
re-authorization for an S-NSSAI; or
c. The AMF, based on operator policy or a subscription change, decides to
initiate the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure
for a certain S-NSSAI which was previously authorized.
Based on the outcome of the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization, the Allowed NSSAI for each Access Type will be updated
accordingly.It is network policies to decide for which Access Type to be used
if both Access Types are subject for the Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization. However, if the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization fails for all S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI, the AMF shall
execute the Network-initiated Deregistration procedure with the appropriate
rejection cause value for each Rejected S-NSSAI.
After a successful or unsuccessful UE Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization, the UE context in the AMF shall retain the authentication
and authorization status for the UE for the related specific S-NSSAI of the
HPLMN while the UE remains RM-REGISTERED in the PLMN, so that the AMF is not
required to execute a Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
for a UE at every Periodic Registration Update or Mobility Registration
procedure with the PLMN.
A Network Slice-Specific AAA server may revoke the authorization or challenge
the authentication and authorization of a UE at any time. When authorization
is revoked for an S-NSSAI that is in the current Allowed NSSAI for an Access
Type, the AMF shall provide a new Allowed NSSAI to the UE and trigger the
release of all PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI, for this Access Type.
The AMF provides the GPSI of the UE related to the S-NSSAI to the AAA Server
to allow the AAA server to initiate the Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization, or the Authorization revocation procedure, where the UE
current AMF needs to be identified by the system, so the UE authorization
status can be challenged or revoked.
The Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization requires that the
UE Primary Authentication and Authorization of the SUPI has successfully
completed. If the SUPI authorization is revoked, then also the Network Slice-
Specific authorization is revoked.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei Tech in SP-200526.
The work item on enhancement of 3GPP management system for multiple tenant
environment support has concluded conceptual descriptions, specific
information for tenant and other potential changes to management services.
This release 16 work item is a feature to enhance management and orchestration
to 5G network and network slicing. This is also a follow up work item to study
on tenancy concept in 5G networks and network slicing management, which
concluded to enhance management system as following:
\- Conception description
\- Performance measurement in multiple tenant environment
\- Network slice fault supervision in multiple tenant environment
In 3GPP management system, tenant is type of communication service consumer
and tenant represents a group of MnS consumers associated with the management
capabilities they are allowed to access and consume. The 3GPP management
system provides multi-tenancy support, by associating different tenants with
different sets of management capabilities. Every tenant may be authorized to
access and consume those MnSs that the operator makes available to this tenant
based on SLA.
The MnS consumer, acting on behalf of a tenant, may get the performance
measurements of a network slice. Performance measurements specified in TS
28.552 can be split into sub-counters per S-NSSAI. 3GPP management system can
use these sub-counters to distinguish performance measurements for different
tenants, which might be required when performance measurements are exposed as
part of Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS) specified in TS 28.530.

## 16.3 Business Role Models for Network Slicing
* * *
**810051** **Business Role Models for Network Slicing** **BRMNS** **S1**
**SP-180773** **Covell, Betsy, Nokia**
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-200294.
This WI adds requirements to enable a 3GPP system to adequately support the
variety of business role models for network slicing that are possible in a 5G
system. The requirements address service exposure giving additional control to
3rd parties, impact of SLAs on network slice management, and non-public
network access to MNO spectrum. Also addressed are security relationships
between
  * a UE and a private slice,
  * a private slice and a network, and
  * a private slice and other slices of the same network.
The requirements are captured in TS 22.261 [1].
The requirements from the BRMNS WI provide the means to support new business
role models in vertical markets introduced for supporting vertical markets.
These role models extend the possible interactions between Mobile Network
Operators (MNOs) and 3rd parties who use the network and/or own/manage part of
the network infrastructure. In particular, the introduction of network slicing
allows new opportunities for 3rd parties to exercise additional control over
the portions of the network, i.e., the network slice, supporting their network
needs. Four key business relationship models were considered.
\- Model 3a: MNO provides the virtual/physical infrastructure and V/NFs; a 3rd
party uses the functionality provided by the MNO,
\- Model 3b: MNO provides the virtual/physical infrastructure and V/NFs; a 3rd
party manages some V/NFs via APIs exposed by the MNO,
\- Model 3c: MNO provides virtual/physical infrastructure; a 3rd party
provides some of the V/NFs,
\- Model 3d: a 3rd party provides and manages some of the virtual/physical
infrastructure and V/NFs.
Models 3a and 3b are supported by the Rel-15 network slicing requirements,
with some enhancements in the Rel-16 APIs and management functions to extend
3rd party access and control of capabilities provided by the MNO, and to do so
in a secure manner. In these two models, the 3rd party has greater control
over the network capabilities that support its service. However, this control
is limited to what is allowed by the MNO through the provided APIs. The Rel-16
enhancements allow the 3rd party to monitor the activities of their UEs when
using the network slice and to monitor resource usage within the network
slice. These capabilities are added to support SLAs between the MNO and the
3rd party.
As an example of the additional monitoring functionality, a network slice
supporting a local smart grid needs additional APIs to monitor activities of
many sensors throughout the grid and receive network status information that
can be used to detect and resolve any communications problems that arise
within the grid. Figure 2-1 from TR 22.830 [2] illustrates the smart grid role
models.
Figure 2-1: role model scenario between MNO and power grid company
Models 3c and 3d resulted in the addition of new functionality to support
three new network management models.
1) MNO manages all virtual/physical infrastructure and all V/NFs including 3rd
party's ones,
2) 3rd party manages its own virtual/physical infrastructure and/or its own
V/NFs; MNO manages the others.
3) 3rd party manages virtual/physical infrastructure and/or V/NFs including
its own virtual/physical infrastructure and/or V/NFs and some MNO's
virtual/physical infrastructure and/or V/NFs; MNO manages the others.
From the 3rd party perspective, the management role models 2 and 3 support the
3rd party management function and provide extended management for the MNO to
coordinate with the 3rd party management. The 3rd party may use suitable APIs
provided by the MNO to directly manage the V/NFs as well as the infrastructure
resources so that it can properly handle when their business requirements are
changed.
For models 3c and 3d, additional consideration is needed on the mechanisms to
provide the isolation and interfaces that give the 3rd party the appropriate
level of control while securing the PLMN. Specifically, where the 3rd party
provides V/NFs or provides and manages some of the virtual/physical
infrastructure and V/NFs, SLAs may be used to address some trust issues, such
as what each party will provide and manage. However, the principles of trust
and verification also come into play. The 3rd party must be able to verify,
though the management interface, that all terms of the SLA are being met by
the MNO. Similarly, the MNO must be able to verify that the 3rd party is
managing resources appropriately so that there is no adverse impact to the
rest of the network. Appropriate management interfaces are needed to support
both the network operator and 3rd party.
Models 3c and 3d allow for additional interactions between non-public
networks, private slices, and PLMNs as shown in the following figures from
[2].

Figure 2-4: Example of enterprise communications using a private slice
throughout the PLMN
Support for enterprise communications may be provided by a variety of network
configurations, including multiple PLMNs, private slices, and non-public
networks. New requirements allow for managing the enterprise communications in
a coordinated manner across these various implementation options. New
requirements also provide for isolation of private network resources which may
be constrained for access within a geographic area such as a factory site or
restricted for use only by UEs belonging to the enterprise. As a counterpart,
additional requirements provide for restricting some enterprise UEs from
accessing a PLMN, this may be useful for example to keep factory equipment
connected to the private slice or non-public network when a PLMN covers the
same area.

Summary based on the input provided by Intel in SP-200849.
The performance assurance feature has been enhanced with respect to both
management services and 5G performance data (including performance
measurements and KPIs) in Rel-16.
The threshold monitoring service has been defined for performance assurance in
Rel-16. It enables the instant threshold monitoring for cumulative counters,
and granularity period-based monitoring for the non-cumulative counters, as
specified in TS 28.550 [1]. The instant threshold monitoring for cumulative
counters supports to send the threshold crossing notification whenever the
(interim) measurement value reaches the threshold within the monitoring
granularity period. The threshold monitoring service is configurable by
adopting the NRM (Network Resource Model) based solution (See ThresholdMonitor
IOC in TS 28.622 [2]) in connection with provisioning related operations
(including CreateMOI, ModifyMOIAttributes, DeleteMOI, etc) defined in TS
28.532 [3].
The performance data streaming service has been enhanced to support streaming
information management, including adding and deleting streaming information by
producer, and getting the streaming information by consumer, see TS 28.550 [1]
and TS 28.532 [3]. The streaming information management enables the streaming
of performance when there are changes on the measurement jobs, including
creation of a new measurement, termination of a measurement job and change of
the measurements collected in a measurement job.
The new or enhanced 5G performance measurements are defined for NG-RAN and 5GC
in Rel-16 in TS 28.552 [4], covering the aspects described in the following
table.
NF Measurements categories
* * *
gNB Packet delay (interface, node, E2E), packet loss, packet drop, IP latency,
radio resource utilization, UE IP throughput, RRC connection, PDU Session
Management, Handovers, UE measurement report, Transport Blocks (TB), DRB setup
management, QoS flow management, UE Context management, PDCP data volume, DC

registration, service update, service discovery
The performance measurements for ng-eNB have been also defined in TS 32.425
[5] in Rel-16, with the focus on E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity.
The 5G KPIs are enhanced or newly defined in TS 28.554 [6] in Rel-16, for the
aspects of QoS flow / DRB retainability, DRB accessibility, NG-RAN handover
success rate, NG-RAN UE throughput, PDU session establishment success rate,
PDU session establishment time, inter-gNB handover Execution time,
registration update numbers and success rate, UL/DL delay in NG-RAN nodes and
interfaces, integrated UL/DL delay in NG-RAN, and e2e UL/DL delay.

This section summarizes the feature "Optimisations of UE radio capability
signalling" across 3GPP specifications (RAN, SA, CT).
[Background]{.underline}
With the increase in the size of UE radio capabilities driven by additional
supported bands, the size of the UE Radio Capabilities will significantly grow
from Rel-15 onwards, therefore an efficient approach to signal UE Radio
Capability information is needed.
SA2 concluded that additional optimisation of UE radio capabilities handling
should be investigated as part of a dedicated study towards Release 16. A
study item [1] was drafted accordingly, along with a corresponding RAN study
item [13]. The SA2 study item conclusions are documented in TR 23.743 [2]. The
conclusions of the RAN study item are documented in TR 37.873 [14]. Subsequent
to the study items, work items were drafted in SA ([5]) and RAN ([10]) to
implement optimisations to the UE radio capability signalling.
The work is divided into two subfeatures, UE radio capability ID and UE
capability segmentation.
[UE Radio Capability ID]{.underline}
The SA2 work item [5] specified system optimisations for the 5GS (documented
in TS 23.501 [3]) and for the EPS (documented in TS 23.401 [4]), that apply to
both NR and E-UTRA, but not NB-IoT, consisting of using UE Radio Capability
IDs as an alternative to signaling the UE Radio Capabilities container in
system procedures:
\- between the UE and the CN (over Uu)
\- between the CN and the RAN (impacting N2/S1 interfaces)
\- within the RAN in e.g. the handover procedures (impacting Xn/X2/S1/N2
interfaces)
\- within the CN.
Work was done in collaboration with RAN WGs for the related RAN interfaces and
CT WGs for the CN interfaces and NFs. Interworking with nodes that support the
feature and those that do not support the feature was also defined.
The UE Radio Capability ID format is defined in TS 23.003 [7]. The UE Radio
Capability ID is signaled by the UE in NAS as specified in TS 24.501 [8] for
the 5GS and as specified in TS 24.301 [9] for the EPS. Two possible options
for the assignment of UE Radio Capability ID exist:
\- Manufacturer-assigned: The UE Radio Capability ID may be assigned by the UE
manufacturer in which case it includes a UE manufacturer identification (i.e.
a Vendor ID). In this case, the UE Radio Capability ID uniquely identifies a
set of UE radio capabilities for a UE by this manufacturer in any network.
\- Network-assigned: If a manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is not
used by the UE or the serving network, or it is not recognised by the serving
network's UE Capability Management Function (UCMF), the UCMF may allocate UE
Radio Capability IDs for the UE corresponding to each different set of UE
radio capabilities which the network may receive from the UE at different
times. In this case, the UE Radio Capability IDs which the UE receives are
applicable to the serving network and uniquely identify the corresponding sets
of UE radio capabilities in this network. The network-assigned UE Radio
Capability ID includes a Version ID in its format. The value of the Version ID
is the one configured in the UCMF, at the time when the UE Radio Capability ID
value is assigned. The Version ID value makes it possible to detect whether a
UE Radio Capability ID is current or outdated.
UE Radio Capability IDs and the mapping to the corresponding UE radio
capabilities are stored in a new function called the UE Capability Management
Function (UCMF) in the CN. The UCMF is used for:
\- storage of dictionary entries corresponding to either Network-assigned or
Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs.
\- assigning Network-assigned UE Radio Capability ID values.
\- provisioning of Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID entries in the
UCMF performed from an AF that interacts with the UCMF either directly or via
the NEF/SCEF (or via Network Management).

System procedures are defined for 5GS in TS 23.502 [6] and for EPS in TS
23.401 [4].
[UE Capability Segmentation]{.underline}
The RAN work item [10] calls for specification of a segmentation mechanism, so
that in cases of excessively large UE capability signalling (e.g. capability
information messages exceeding the maximum size of a PDCP SDU), the capability
can be segmented into multiple RRC messages. Segmentation applies to both NR
and E-UTRA and is captured respectively in [11] and [12].
Segmentation is performed in the RRC protocol layer, with a separate RRC PDU
for each segment. The UE encodes the capability information message, then
divides the encoded message into segments such that the size of each segment
does not exceed the maximum size of a PDCP SDU (8188 octets in E-UTRA, 9000
octets in NR); the RAN node (eNB or gNB) receives the segments and reassembles
them to reconstruct the original capability information message. Segmentation
is applied only in case the size of the encoded capability information message
exceeds the maximum size of a PDCP SDU. The signalling formats support up to
16 segments for a single capability information message.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-200254.
In order to improve the NWDAF initiated in Rel 15, the eNA (Enablers for
Network Automation for 5G) feature specifies the data collected by NWDAF and
the NWDAF output (i.e. statistics and predictions) to support network
automation.
The eNA feature includes:
\- Architecture enhancements of 5G System to support network data analytics
service
\- A framework to enable data collection and provide analytics to consumers

the V2X Application Server acting as an Application Function (AF) may consume
relevant network data analytics provided by NWDAF for the purposes of
adjustment of the application.
Main impacts on the system by the eNA Work Item are as follows:

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-200215.
This WI adds requirements to enhance the 3GPP PS Domain to provide an optional
capability to allow unauthenticated UE\'s to access restricted local operator
services based on operator policy and regional regulatory requirements. The
requirements address identifying when restricted local operator services are
available and enabling a UE to attach to a network for the purpose of
accessing a restricted local operator service even if the UE is not able to be
authenticated by the network. The requirements can be found in TS 22.101 [1],
TS 22.115 [2], and TS 22.228 [3].
The PARLOS WI was driven primarily by FCC regulations for manual roaming as
described in [4] and [5]. The ability to provide access to such local services
has been available to U.S. operators on a proprietary basis. However, the wide
deployment of LTE and corresponding introduction of VoLTE creates demand for a
standardized mechanism to allow a UE to access these services such as manual
roaming without necessarily being successfully authenticated for access. This
optional functionality of supporting access to RLOS services to
unauthenticated UEs can be deployed based on operator policy. The RLOS
services themselves are out of scope of 3GPP. PARLOS is an LTE capability.
The PARLOS requirements provide for a network to inform UEs using a 3GPP
access technology that RLOS services are available and to allow access to the
RLOS services when requested by the UE without requiring successful
authentication of the UE first. The services are provided in an isolated
manner that prevents an unauthenticated UE from accessing any other service or
functionality in the network. Additional requirements also provide for
collection of charging information related to the use of RLOS services.

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-200256.
Enhancing Topology of SMF and UPF in 5G Networks (ETSUN) has two goals:
1\. Enable the 3GPP system to support deployments where a SMF is not able /
allowed to control UPF(s) throughout the same PLMN.
\- This is mostly meant for very big networks which are subdivided into
geographical areas with each their own management;
\- This relates with the addition of I-SMF in the architecture but defines
also the possibility of changing the V-SMF in case of Home-Routing.
2\. Enhance the capability of 5GS architecture for a UPF to be controlled by
multiple SMF\'s (and many UPF\'s to be controlled by many SMFs) especially for
the UE IP address / Prefix allocation
These features couldn't be specified as part of 3GPP R15 Session Management
due to lack of time.
[Addition of I-SMF in the architecture]{.underline}
**When a UE with an established PDU Session is not in a TA served by the SMF
of this PDU Session, an intermediate SMF (called I-SMF) is inserted by the AMF
in the signalling path of the PDU session to control the intermediate UPF
(called I-UPF) terminating the N3 interface with the 5G Access Network.**
Figure 1: Non-roaming architecture with I-SMF insertion to the PDU Session in
reference point representation, with no UL-CL/BP
**The I-SMF acts in a similar way than the V-SMF of a Home Routed PDU Session:
as long as the UE remains in its own I-SMF service area, the I-SMF handles the
transitions between User Plane Active and Inactive for the PDU session, the
Hand-Over and controls the local UPF(s) with sometimes relaying of N4 commands
received from the SMF. The SMF remains responsible of the interfaces with the
PCF and the CHF, of the interface with the UDM and of the overall control of
the PDU Session.**
When the I-SMF is inserted into a PDU Session, the I-SMF provides to the SMF
the list of DNAI it supports. Based on this information received from I-SMF
and on PCC rules for the PDU Session, the SMF may provide the DNAI(s) of
interest for local traffic steering to the I-SMF for this PDU Session. The
I-SMF is thus responsible for the insertion, modification and removal of
UPF(s) to ensure local traffic steering: the SMF does not need to know the
mapping between DNAI(s) for local traffic offload and local UPF(s). Then the
SMF provides N4 rules to the I-SMF for how the traffic for local offload shall
be detected, enforced, monitored in UPF(s) controlled by the I-SMF.
When the UE moves out of the service area of the I-SMF, the I-SMF may be
changed or the I-SMF is simply removed. Likewise, the V-SMF may be changed
upon UE mobility in case of Home-Routing.
**[UE IP address / Prefix allocation]{.underline}**
**ETSUN adds the possibility for the SMF to defer to the UPF the UE IP
address** / Prefix [ ]{.underline} **allocation or to indicate to the DHCP/DN-
AAA server the range (corresponding to the UPF) of IP address** / Prefix [
]{.underline} **to be allocated : this allows many SMF(s) to control the same
UPF without having to synchronise or divide the UE IP address** / Prefix [
]{.underline} **space between these SMF(s).**
**[Charging aspects]{.underline}** (Summary provided by China Mobile in
SP-200266)
SA2, CT3 and CT4 have studied the enhanced topology deployments of SMF and UPF
in TR 23.726, TS 23.501 and 23.502. S5 WI ETSUN specify charging support for
deployments topologies with specific SMF service areas to line up with the
other NF interfaces.
Charing Stage 2 work on WI ETSUN for TS 32.255 [3]:
\- Specify charging procedures and functionality enhancement for PDU sessions
with Intermediate SMF (I-SMF) and anchor SMF (SMF), based on existing Nchf to
SMF.
\- Introduction of V-SMF change in Roaming HR principles and message flows.
\- Enhance procedures for addition /change/removal of PSA for UL CL or BP
controlled by I-SMF.
\- Update charging procedures with I-SMF insertion/change/removal.
\- Add I-SMF related triggers in SMF.
Charging Stage 3 work on WI ETSUN for 32.291 [4] and 32.298 [5]:
\- Add relevant parameters in CHF-CDR to support I-SMF as serving network
function.
\- Add I-SMF related trigger, trigger types and data type.
\- Update Nchf_ ConvergedCharging API.
**References**
For the addition of I-SMF in the architecture, ETSUN is mostly specified in TS
23.501 [1] clause 5.34 and in TS 23.502 [2] clause 4.23 (both clauses are
dedicated to ETSUN)**.**

RP-200122 China Telecom
Summary based on the input provided by China Telecom in RP-200733.
This work item specifies the Private Network (i.e. Stand-alone Non-Public
Network (NPN) and PLMN Integrated Non-Public Network) features for gNB with
the following functionalities:
Support NPN functionality in NG-RAN:
\- CAG/SNPN relevant parameter broadcast from SIB
\- CAG/SNPN cell selection/reselection
\- CAG/SNPN cell access control
\- For CAG, in the case of Intra-RAT intra-system and inter-RAT intra-system,
the connected mode mobility support
\- The connected mode mobility support within SNPN
For CAG/SNPN, necessary modifications to NG-C and Xn interfaces to communicate
the CAG-ID/NID related parameters to NG-RAN nodes, respectively: \"Support
CAG/SNPN functionality with CU-DU split\" and \"Support CAG/SNPN functionality
with CP-UP split\", if any.
The key functionalities of this work item include the following.
[NPN relevant parameter broadcast from SIB]{.underline}
The NPN IDs (i.e. SNPNs (identified by PLMN ID + NID) and PNI-NPNs (identified
by PLMN ID + CAG ID)) were introduced into SIB1 to indicate UEs whether a cell
is an NPN cell. Up to 12 different SNPNs or PNI-NPNs or mixed networks can be
broadcasted in a cell. SIB1 allows indication of TAC, RANAC, cell Identity per
SNPN or per PNI-NPN.
The names of NPNs (HRNN) are broadcasted in SIB10 and the On-demand SI in
connected is not supported for SIB10. The HRNN is associated with the Network
ID implicitly. The SIB for HRNN shall have the same amount of HRNN elements as
the number of CAGs and NIDs in SIB1.
New defined IE 'manualCAGselectionAllowed-r16' is used to indicate whether it
is allowed users to manually select a CAG-ID supported by the CAG cell but
outside the UE's allowed CAG list.
Only cells supporting CAG(s), including CAG only cells and shared CAG cells,
may be listed in the new CAG PCI lists, UE may use knowledge of the CAG PCIs
to improve implementation dependent search procedures for CAGs.
[NPN cell selection/reselection]{.underline}
NPN selection functions similar to normal PLMN selection, when a cell
broadcasts any CAG IDs or NIDs, NPN-capable Rel-16 UE can treat the cell with
cellReservedForOtherUse = true as a candidate cell during cell selection and
cell reselection. UE AS reports the found NPN IDs to NAS. In case of manual
selection, the human readable network name (if broadcasted) may also be
provided from AS to NAS.
The UE shall scan all RF channels in the NR bands according to its
capabilities to find available NPNs. On each carrier, the UE shall at least
search for the strongest cell, read its system information and report
available NPN identifiers together with their HRNN (if broadcast) to the NAS.
For a UE in NPN access mode, if the highest ranked cell or best cell according
to absolute priority reselection rules is a cell which is not suitable for UE
access, for licensed spectrum, the UE shall not consider this cell and other
cells on the same frequency as candidates for reselection for a maximum of 300
seconds; for unlicensed spectrum, the UE shall not consider this cell as
candidate for cell reselection but should continue to consider other cells on
the same frequency for cell reselection.
The Rel-15 UEs and Non-NPN-capable Rel-16 UEs treat a cell with
cellReservedForOtherUse=true as barred cell.
For Rel-16 and later NPN-capable UEs, if the npn-IdentityInfoList-r16 IE is
present in CellAccessRelatedInfo and the cellReservedForOtherUse = true while,
a cell is an NPN-only cell that is only available for normal service for NPNs'
subscriber.
All the R16 UEs will treat the cell as barred when the legacy IE
cellReservedForOtherUse=True and this cell does not broadcast any CAG-IDs or
NIDs.
For SNPN, Once the UE has selected an SNPN, cell selection/re-selection is
only performed within the SNPN, i.e. a cell is only considered suitable if the
broadcasted SNPN identifier matches the selected SNPN.
[NPN cell access control]{.underline}
There is no preliminary access check for NPN cells in CONNECTED mode. For
SNPN, the UAC parameters per SNPN are configured by reusing the existing uac-
BarringPerPLMN-List, and for a PNI-NPN the UAC parameter set is selected based
on the PLMN ID of PNI-NPNs. The current measurement reporting procedures is
extended to include NPN information to support ANR.
During the access procedure, for SNPN, the SNPN ID is included in the
RRCSetupComplete and Initial UE Message message, and for PNI-NPN the Allowed
CAG list is provided to the gNB by the AMF. A single Cause "NPN access denied"
will be sent to users when they fail to access NPN cells.
[NPN relevant mobility support]{.underline}
At mobility, the source NG-RAN node knows the NPN information supported by the
candidate target cells, the target RAN node needs to be informed of the
serving SNPN ID or UE allowed CAG ID list which are included in the mobility
restriction list. If the serving SNPN ID or UE allowed CAG ID list does not
match any of the target cell supported list of SNPN IDs or CAG IDs, target RAN
node shall fail the handover.
For mobility in inactive state, the last serving NG-RAN node performs access
control check upon the reception of RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST, the new NG-
RAN node may perform access control check upon the reception of RETRIEVE UE
CONTEXT RESPONSE which is implementation dependent.
[NPN Support over NG/Xn]{.underline}
The list of supported SNPN IDs could be exchanged between NG-RAN node and AMF
via NG setup and configuration update procedures while the list of cell
supported SNPN IDs and CAG IDs could be exchanged via Xn setup and
configuration update procedures.
[NPN Support over F1/E1]{.underline}
Over F1, the list of supported SNPN IDs can be exchanged between DU and CU,
the cell supported list of CAG IDs can be signaled from DU to CU. The NID as
part of the UAC Assistance Information could be signalled from gNB-CU to gNB-
DU. The gNB-DU is responsible for SIB10 encoding, valueTag and areaScope
associated with SIB10, and need to signal the HRNN (SIB 10) to gNB-CD. The
general cause value \"NPN not supported\" is introduced for interface related
messages and the general cause value \"NPN access denied" is introduced for
UE-associated messages. Over E1, the list of SNPN IDs supported by CU-UP could
be signalled to CU-CP.
[NPN support for RAN sharing and Dual connectivity]{.underline}
If NR access is shared, system information broadcast in a shared cell
indicates a TAC and a Cell Identity for each subset of PLMNs, PNI NPNs and
SNPNs. NR access provides only one TAC and one Cell Identity per cell per
PLMN, SNPN or PNI NPN. In Rel-16, a Cell Identity can only belong to one
network type among PLMN, PNI-NPN or SNPN.
The NR-DC within a single SNPN or within PNI-NPN or across PLMN and PNI-NPN is
supported, EN-DC is not supported for NPN.
[Emergency Services]{.underline}
For SNPN, Emergency services are not supported.
For a CAG-only cell in PNI-NPN, if the cellReservedForOtherUse = false in gNB,
the access attempts of Rel-15 UEs or Rel-16 non-NPN capable UEs for emergency
services could be allowed; if the cellReservedForOtherUse = true, the access
attempts of Rel-16 NPN capable UEs for emergency services could be allowed.

Summary based on the input provided by China Mobile in [SP-200776].
This WI enhances the service-based architecture of 5G system to improve the
service framework and support high reliability. The main features introduced
by the WI include:
1) support of indirect communication models of NF/NF Services via an
intermediary function (Service Communication Proxy - SCP),
2) NF/NF service set enabling the grouping of equivalent NF instances/NF
service instances. The NF/NF Services within a NF/NF Service set can share the
same context data thus improving the resiliency for processing any
transaction. and
3) binding mechanism improves the flexibility and efficiency of the service
based architecture by allowing the NF producer to dynamically indicate that
the NF consumer, for a particular context, should be bound to an NF service
instance, NF instance, NF service set or NF set for subsequent transaction
depending on local policies or other criteria..
[Architecture enhancement]{.underline}
The work has resulted in the definition of different communication models that
NF and NF services can use to interact which each other via or not via a new
NF named SCP as shown in the figure here below from TS 23.501 [1]
Figure 1: Communication models for NF/NF services interaction
Model A - Direct communication without NRF interaction: Neither NRF nor SCP
are used. Consumers are configured with producers\' \"NF profiles\" and
directly communicate with a producer of their choice.
Model B - Direct communication with NRF interaction: Consumers do discovery by
querying the NRF. Based on the discovery result, the consumer does the
selection. The consumer sends the request to the selected producer.
Model C - Indirect communication without delegated discovery: Consumers do
discovery by querying the NRF. Based on discovery result, the consumer does
the selection of an NF Set or a specific NF instance of NF instance set. The
consumer sends the request to the SCP containing the address of the selected
service producer pointing to a NF service instance or a set of NF service
instances. The SCP routes the request to the selected NF service producer
instance.
Model D - Indirect communication with delegated discovery: Consumers do not do
any discovery or selection. The consumer adds any necessary discovery and
selection parameters required to find a suitable producer to the service
request. The SCP uses the request address and the discovery and selection
parameters in the request message to route the request to a suitable producer
instance. The SCP can perform discovery with an NRF and obtain a discovery
result.
[NF/NF Service set mechanism]{.underline}
The NF Set and NF Service Set concept has been defined by grouping equivalent
control plane NFs into NF Set or grouping multiple NF Service instances into
NF Service Set. The NF/NF Services within a NF/NF Service set can share the
same context data.
When the NF producer instance is not available, another NF producer instance
within the same NF Set is selected. When multiple NF Service instances within
a NF Service Set are exposed to the NF Service consumer or SCP and the failure
of NF Service instance is detected or notified by the NRF, the NF Service
consumer or SCP selects another NF Service instance of the same NF Service Set
within the NF instance, if available. Otherwise the NF Service consumer or SCP
selects a different NF instance within the same NF Set.
[Binding mechanism]{.underline}
A binding mechanism based on NF/NF Service set was introduced to improve the
efficiency of the service-based architecture.
Binding is used to indicate suitable target NF producer instance(s) for NF
service instance selection, reselection and routing of subsequent requests
associated with a specific NF producer resource (context) and NF service. This
allows the NF producer to indicate that the NF consumer, for a particular
context, should be bound to an NF service instance, NF instance, NF service
set or NF set depending on local policies and other criteria.
Binding is also used by the NF consumer to indicate suitable NF consumer
instance(s) for notification target instance reselection and routing of
subsequent notification requests associated with a specific notification
subscription and for providing Binding Indication for service(s) that the NF
consumer produces for the same data context and the NF service producer is
subsequently likely to invoke.

Summary based on the input provided by T-Mobile USA INC in SP-200808
In release 15 Service-Based interfaces were introduced between the functional
elements of the new 5G core systems (5GC), however no changes were made to the
IMS nodes that interact with the packet core, and so Diameter-based interfaces
remained between IMS functions and the 5GC. It was therefore determined that
the specification of Service-Based interfaces between the IMS core and the 5GC
would enable more efficient implementations. However, to enable operators the
flexibility in performing the transition to Service-Based Architecture (SBA),
it was determined not to remove (at this time) the option to use Diameter for
IMS services interworking with 5GC.
This work resulted in the specification of Service-Based architecture between
the IMS and 5GC. The following summarizes the enhancements made:
The first major change to enable SBA was an update to the PCF and Npcf
services to allow the IMS functions to use the N5 interface (instead of Rx)
when communicating with the PCC functions for QOS interactions. This requires
IMS functions to be upgraded to support the SBA procedures and protocols, as
well as the SBA protocols themselves to be updated with IMS specific
parameters (including IMS public and private identifiers). The IMS functions
now use similar capabilities to other SBA functional entities to perform PCF
discovery, avoiding the need for interworking to perform this. One added
benefit of this is that a new option for P-CSCF discovery using the NRF is
provided, this may allow for some network implementations to use a single
discovery method (avoiding misalignment between different systems).
One area of significant change was to provide SBA capabilities to the IMS
portion of the HSS, this introduces Nhss services to the SBA for IMS
interactions with the HSS. Service-Based equivalents to the Cx and Sh
interfaces (identified as the N70 and N71 interfaces) enable the CSCF and IMS-
AS to use service-based interfaces for subscription and service interactions
with the HSS. No changes are made to the non-IMS portions of the HSS so that
existing LTE and UMTS packet cores can continue to interact with the HSS
unchanged; this also allows for UDICOM implementations.
The last major change from the Diameter approach to the Service-Based approach
was in the method of HSS discovery. To better align with the discovery of
other 5GC functional elements, the NRF and the Nnrf protocols were updated,
allowing the IMS functions to discover the correct HSS instance to use for the
subscription of a specific subscriber. To enable implementations where the
mapping between a subscriber identifier and the HSS instance is not stored in
the NRF a new service was specified allowing the UDR to store this information
and for the NRF to request the mapping. These enhancements can leverage the
deployment implementation options introduced with eSBA (e.g. direct or
indirect discovery methods) for proxy-based network routing.
As noted earlier, the option to utilize Diameter based interactions between
IMS and 5GC was retained, to enable flexible transition to SBA.

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia.
3GPP SA2 in Release 15 defined the unified data architecture based on UDR. The
HSS+UDM were introduced in R15 for migration purposes (in TS 23.501, Section
5.17).
This WI standardises the interaction between UDM and HSS, when these are
deployed separately, and coexistence of 5G and 4G subscription data permitting
5G migration towards the UDM/UDR architecture defined for 5GC.
Open interfaces are defined between UDM and HSS (NU1 interface) and HSS and
UDR (NU2 interface) and in the figure here below from TS 23.632 [1]
Figure 1: Architecture for Direct UDM-HSS interworking in reference point
representation
From a Service Based architecture standpoint, the new Nhss services have been
added:
Figure 2: Architecture for Direct UDM-HSS interworking
The Nudr and Nudm services have been enhanced, also.
The Nhss service has been defined in TS 29.563[2] and the overall architecture
and stage two is in TS 23.632. Both are under CT4 responsibility (see the CT
WID in CP-193016[5]). TS 23.501[1] and TS 23.502[4] only provide minimal text
on the stage two aspects and refer to the CT4 documents as necessary.
The work has no impact on the rest of the system as the interactions defined
by this work remain confined between UDM, HSS and UDR (i.e. the deployment of
UDICOM in a PLMN is transparent to the rest of the system, in that whether a
combined UDM/HSS or a UDICOM enabled separate UDM and HSS are deployed in a
PLMN is not detectable e.g. from a MME or a AMF)

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in RP-202753 (previous version
in RP-201840)
This work item specifies NR enhancements for a single global solution
framework for access to unlicensed spectrum which enables operation of NR in
the 5GHz and the 6GHz (e.g., US 5925 -- 7125 MHz, or European 5925 \-- 6425
MHz, or parts thereof) unlicensed bands taking into account regional
regulatory requirements and reusing features of NR as much as possible.
This work item supports NR Radio Access operating with shared spectrum channel
access to operate in different modes where either PCell, PSCell, or SCells can
be in shared spectrum and an SCell may or may not be configured with uplink.
The applicable deployment scenarios are described in the following.
\- Scenario A: Carrier aggregation between NR in licensed spectrum (PCell) and
NR in shared spectrum (SCell);
> o A.1: SCell is not configured with UL (DL only); A.2: SCell is configured
> with UL (DL+UL).
\- Scenario B: Dual connectivity between LTE in licensed spectrum and NR in
shared spectrum (PSCell);
\- Scenario C: NR in shared spectrum (PCell);
\- Scenario D: NR cell in shared spectrum and uplink in licensed spectrum;
\- Scenario E: Dual connectivity between NR in licensed spectrum (PCell) and
NR in shared spectrum (PSCell)
**[Physical Layer Signals and Channels]{.underline}**
**Initial access signals and channels:** For PRACH, to support larger PRACH
transmission power under PSD limitation and/or to meet OCB requirement, longer
PRACH sequences of length 1151 and 517 are introduced, applicable to 15kHz SCS
and 30kHz SCS, respectively. Legacy length 839 PRACH sequence is not supported
in a cell with shared spectrum channel access.
**DL signals and channels:** DCI 2_0 is enhanced to provide time and frequency
domain Channel Occupancy Time (COT) structure. For time domain COT, remaining
COT duration can be included in DCI 2_0. If COT duration field is not
configured, the UE can derive the remaining COT duration from SFI field
included in DCI 2_0. For frequency domain COT, a bitmap for available RB sets
can be included in DCI 2_0 to indicate if an RB set is included in the current
COT.
Search space set group switching feature is also introduced, such that the UE
can be dynamically controlled to perform PDCCH monitoring from two groups of
search spaces sets. The search space set group switching can be triggered by
explicit bit in DCI 2_0, a PDCCH decoding event in one of the groups, and a
timer expiration.
In Rel-15, only length of 2, 4 and 7 OFDM symbols is supported with PDSCH
mapping type B with. Additional lengths (i.e. 2-13 symbols) as well as
corresponding additional DMRS positions are specified for unlicensed band
operation. The feature is also specified for licensed operation.
In order to facilitate UE monitoring PDCCH on multiple RB sets while not
significantly increasing RRC signalling overhead, a search space can be
configured with multiple monitoring locations in frequency domain. The
configuration of CORESET is replicated on the RB sets where these monitoring
locations are located.
**UL signals and channels:** For PUCCH and PUSCH, PRB interlace structure is
introduced to meet OCB requirement and boost transmit power under PSD
limitation. For 30KHz SCS, M=5 interlaces are defined. For 15KHz SCS, M=10
interlaces are defined.. The interlaces are defined with respect to point A,
and one interlace is formed by set of resource blocks M RBs apart.
For PUCCH, Rel.15 NR PUCCH format 0/1/2/3 are extended to PRB interlace
waveform similar to PUSCH, but constrained within one RB set. PUCCH format 0/1
in Rel.15 is single RB only, and in Rel.16, they are extended to one interlace
with 10 or 11 RBs. PUCCH format 2/3 in Rel.15 are already multiple RBs but in
continuous RBs up to 16 RBs. In Rel.16, they are extended to occupy one or two
interlaces. If one interlace is used, frequency domain OCC and pre-DFT OCC are
introduced for PUCCH format 2 and 3 respectively to improve the multiplexing
capacity.
In Rel-15, SRS is restricted to the last 6 symbols in a slot. In Rel-16, UE is
able to be configured with SRS transmission on every OFDM symbols in a slot
for unlicensed band operation. The feature is also specified for licensed
operation.
gNB can schedule multiple contiguous PUSCH(s) by a single DCI format 0_1.
**[Physical Layer Procedures]{.underline}**
**Channel access procedures:** Rel.16 NR-U supports two channel access
operation modes: dynamic channel access mode (corresponds to Load Based
Equipment in [1]) and semi-static channel access mode (corresponds to Frame
Based Equipment in [1]).
When operating on a wideband (i.e. >20MHz) carrier, clear channel assessment
(CCA) is performed in the unit of 20MHz or 10MHz depends on regulation
requirements.
For dynamic channel access mode, the following LBT mechanisms are defined:
\- Cat 4 LBT with a contention window (Type 1);
\- Cat 2 LBT within a 25 Âµs sensing interval (Type 2A); Cat 2 LBT within a 16
Âµs gap (Type 2B)
\- Cat 1 LBT with a gap of no more than 16 Âµs without channel sensing (Type
2C)
Both gNB and UE can acquire a COT with Cat 4 LBT, while a gNB or UE can share
the COT acquired by the other node with Cat 2 or Cat 1 LBT under different
conditions. The only exception is the transmission of discovery RS, which
includes the transmission of SSBs and other non-unicast control and data,
where under some restriction, Type 2A LTE can be used to acquire the COT.
For semi-static channel access, in Rel.16 NR-U, only gNB can contend for a
channel as a fixed frame period boundary and a UE can share the gNB COT for
transmission if gNB DL transmission is detected in an earlier part of the same
COT.
**Enhancements to initial access procedures:** Discovery RS is a concept
introduced for NR-U to deliver critical information including PSS/SSS/PBCH
blocks (SSB) and critical system information including System Information
Block 1 (SIB1). In NR, for sub-7GHz bands, up to 8 SSBs can be transmitted
every 20ms to support beam sweeping with different SSB positions. There is no
quasi-colocation (QCL) relationship across up to 8 SSBs within one cycle, but
SSBs at the same position in different cycles are assumed to be QCL'ed.
For unlicensed band operation, transmissions are subject to LBT. Hence, there
is a chance that SSBs cannot be transmitted due to LBT failure. There are two
enhancements introduced to support a more reliable delivery of critical system
information:
\- Type 2A LBT can be used to start the DRS transmission if the duty cycle of
the DRS is no larger than 1/20 and the length of the DRS is no longer than 1ms
\- Up to 20 and 10 candidate SSB positions in a half frame are supported for
30kHz SCS and 15kHz SCS, respectively, to allow more transmission
opportunities than Rel-15. SSBs on the candidate SSB positions with same SSB
index are regarded as QCLed.
The RSSI measurement bandwidth is 20MHz regardless of the carrier bandwidth.
**HARQ enhancements:** For operation in unlicensed band, a major issue with
HARQ operation is scheduled ACK/NACK transmission may not happen due to LBT
failure. In licensed operation, ACK/NACK transmission failure issue is not
severe. If ACK/NACK is not received by the gNB, there is no mechanism to
retransmit the ACK/NACK. This was acceptable for Rel-15 since the probability
for gNB failing to decode ACK/NACK is small and the gNB can schedule a
retransmission of PDSCH to collect ACK/NACK. For unlicensed band operation,
since the channel is shared with other nodes, the transmission of PUCCH or
PUSCH carrying ACK/NACK is not guaranteed, and the probability that the UE
failed ACK/NACK transmission cannot be ignored anymore. To solve this problem,
three features have been designed:
\- Non-numerical K1 indication for ACK/NACK transmission timing
\- Enhanced (Type 2) dynamic codebook for HARQ ACK
\- One-shot (Type 3) codebook for HARQ ACK
The non-numerical K1 feature is introduced, such that the gNB does not provide
a time to report ACK/NACK when scheduling the PDSCH. Instead a special non-
numerical K1 is indicated in the DL grant scheduling the PDSCH. The UE will
hold on to the ACK/NACK corresponds to the PDSCH, and report ACK/NACK when a
later PDSCH is scheduled with another DL grant with proper K1 timing
indicated.
The other two HARQ enhancement features are introduced to support UE ACK/NACK
re-transmissions. For enhanced dynamic codebook design, HARQ ACK group is
introduced. Within an HARQ ACK group, the already scheduled ACK/NACK
(transmitted or failed to transmit) can be triggered to be retransmitted.
Rel.16 NR-U also defines a type-3 HARQ ACK codebook. In this codebook design,
gNB can trigger the report of ACK/NACK for all configured HARQ processes over
all cells by setting a bit in -the DCI.
**Configured grant enhancement:** Rel.16 NR-U enhanced Configured grant UL
transmission by allowing the UE to performing retransmission of a TB in a CG-
PUSCH resource. A CG-UCI is included to indicate the HARQ process ID, NDI and
RVID of the transmission. UE can acquire a COT with Cat 4 LBT for CG-UL
transmission and share the COT with gNB for DL transmissions. The COT sharing
information is also carried in CG-UCI. When CG is configured, gNB can feedback
HARQ-ACK for UL transmission by CG-DFI. When the UE is configured with repK >
1, repetition of a TB is mapped within a configuration in the case when an UE
is configured with multiple active configurations, the UE repeats the TB in
the earliest consecutive transmission occasion candidates within the same
configuration instead of consecutive slots, the UE terminates the repetitions
if an explicit feedback indicating ACK in the DFI is received for the HARQ
process.
**Wideband operation:** The concept of "RB set" is introduced which
approximately corresponds to one 20MHz channel. For PUSCH, the resource
allocation is defined by continuous RB sets and the set of interlaces. The RB
sets are defined by RRC configuring the intra-cell guard band between RB sets.
If the intra-cell guard band is not configured, the default values for intra-
cell guard band from RAN4 will be applied. It is also possible to configure
the intra-cell guard band to be 0.
In a DL BWP with bandwidth larger than 20MHz, gNB may transmit DL channels and
signals when LBT is successful on a subset of RB sets (either contiguous or
non-contiguous) in the BWP. In a UL BWP with bandwidth larger than 20MHz, UE
is allowed to transmit UL channel and signals only if LBT is successful on all
RB sets where UL transmission is scheduled/configured and non-zero intra-cell
guard is applied in between.
**[MAC Enhancements]{.underline}**
At the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, several features were introduced to
alleviate the impact of LBT mechanism on MAC procedures. The main ones are:
Consistent LBT failure detection and recovery; Changes to RACH procedures;
Configured Grant (CG) changes.
A new mechanism to detect and recover from consistent UL LBT failures was
introduced. The detection is per Bandwidth Part (BWP) and based on all uplink
transmissions within this BWP. Similar to BFD, a timer is re-started with
every LBT failure indication from physical layer to MAC; a counter is
incremented with every LBT failure and is reset when the timer expires. When
the counter exceeds a configured threshold, consistent UL LBT failure is
declared on this BWP.
For failures on SCells, the UE reports this to the corresponding gNB (MN for
MCG, SN for SCG) via a MAC CE. For SpCell (PCell or PSCell), when consistent
uplink LBT failures are detected, the UE switches to another UL BWP with
configured RACH resources on that cell, initiates RACH, and reports the
failure via MAC CE. If failures happen on all such BWPs, SCG failure for
PSCell and RLF for PCell is declared.
If msg1 in 4-step RACH or msgA preamble in 2-step RACH is not transmitted due
to LBT failure, the UE does not increment the power of the next attempt. If
the UE is configured with the above LBT failure detection/recovery, it also
does not increment the transmission counter; in this case, the failure of RACH
procedure is handled by the LBT failure detection/recovery.
The LBT failure for transmission of msg2 in 4-step RACH and msgB in 2-step
RACH necessitated longer monitoring windows at the UE to receive these
messages. The maximum window duration was increased from 10ms in Rel-15 to
40ms. However, this change caused possible ambiguity of determining the
correct initial transmission for which the response was intended. To solve
this, the gNB signals the last two-bits of SFN corresponding to msg1
transmission time for msg1 or msgA preamble in the corresponding response
message.
The changes to configured grant transmission are mainly due to autonomous
retransmission on CG resources, autonomous HARQ process ID and RV selection,
and LBT failures. A new CG retransmission timer was introduced where the UE is
allowed to retransmit a packet on a CG after this timer expires without any
ACK from the gNB for the earlier transmission. The UE always prioritizes
ongoing retransmissions over new transmissions. Since the UE signals HARQ ID
and RV on CG transmissions, their selection is left to the UE implementation.
Multiple CGs on a BWP are allowed where they all can use the above
retransmission feature and can also share the same HARQ ID pool.
For uplink multi-TTI transmission, the UE is allowed to select a HARQ process
and RV to transmit a generated packet to handle the scenario when the LBT
fails for the initial TTI occasions. To support transmission of DL HARQ
feedback during DRX operation, if the UE receives a non-numerical K1 where the
actual DCI for HARQ feedback will be coming later, monitoring of downlink
control channel was extended in time.
**[Upper Layer Enhancements]{.underline}**
For Connected mode mobility, the only change for NR-U is the support of RSSI
and Channel Occupancy (CO) measurements similar to LTE-LAA. These can be
reported periodically or along with other measurement reports.
For Idle/Inactive mode mobility, the rules for checking other cells for
reselection were relaxed to handle the cases when best cell on a frequency
belongs to a different PLMN. To further help the UE consider only the cells of
the home or equivalent PLMN in reselection, a "white-list" of such neighbor
cells is broadcasted.
In Rel-15 NR, the UE has a single Paging Occasion (PO) for every DRX cycle in
Idle/Inactive mode. Since LBT may fail during a paging transmission attempt,
multiple PDCCH monitoring occasions were introduced for NR-U. This allows the
gNB to transmit the paging message when LBT is not successful at the first
instance. As monitoring of multiple occasions increases UE power, gNB can let
the UE stop further monitoring when there is no page for that UE by
transmitting a Short Message on paging channel with a newly introduced bit for
this purpose. The UE can also stop monitoring when it detects a paging for
other UEs with the assumption that the gNB had access to the channel and thus
there is no page for itself.
Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC) can be configured for each data radio
bearer (DRB) and SRB2. The signaling bearers (except for SRB2) always use the
highest priority CAPC. The gNB assigns the CAPC by taking into account the
specified mapping between 5QI (QoS indicator) of QoS flows in a DRB. The UE
uses this configuration to determine the CAPC when not signaled by the gNB
directly via DCI. This applies to all CG transmissions and some dynamic
grants. When signaling data is transmitted, CAPC of the PDU is same as the
CAPC of the highest priority signaling bearer. In all other cases, the lowest
priority CAPC among the multiplexed data flows is chosen for the CAPC of the
PDU
**[Targeted spectrum]{.underline}**

Summary based on the input provided by ZTE Corporation in RP-200087 revised to
RP-200623 revised to RP-201225.
The Rel-16 Work Item 2-step RACH for NR achieves the following objectives:
\- A simplified random access procedure was developed. This reduces the number
of interactions between the UE and network during the connection setup and
connection resume, thereby enabling a lower control plane latency. In case of
connected mode, a small amount of data can be sent via 2-step RACH procedure
thus also enabling a lower latency for UL UP data for connected mode UEs.
\- Channel structure of transmitting PRACH and PUSCH in one step (i.e. without
an intermediate message from the network) was developed. The PRACH and PUSCH
are separated by a pre-configured guard period.
\- The above enhancements are applicable to both licensed spectrum and shared
spectrum (i.e. NR-U).
The general procedure of 4-step RACH and 2-step RACH are depicted in Figure 1.
The first step of 2-step RACH comprises an UL MSGA transmission which includes
the equivalent contents of msg1 and msg3 of 4-step RACH. The second step of
2-step RACH is a DL MSGB reception which includes the equivalent content of
msg2 and/or msg4 of 4-step RACH, depending on the detection of UL MSGA.
(a) 4-step RACH (b) 2-step RACH
**Figure 1 General procedure of 4-step RACH and 2-step RACH**
RA type selection
For contention based random access (CBRA), all the triggers for Rel-15 NR
4-step RACH are also applicable to 2-step RACH except when CA is configured,
the 2-step RACH is only applicable on PCell. Contention free random access
(CFRA) procedure with 2-step RACH is only supported for handover.
The UE selects the type of random access at initiation of the random access
procedure based on network configuration:
\- when CFRA resources are not configured, an RSRP threshold is used by the UE
to select between 2-step RA type and 4-step RA type;
\- when CFRA resources for 4-step RA type are configured, UE performs random
access with 4-step RA type;
\- when CFRA resources for 2-step RA type are configured, UE performs random
access with 2-step RA type.
In case of random access in a cell configured with SUL, UE performs carrier
selection (between SUL and NUL) before selecting between 2-step and 4-step RA
type.
MSGA structure: PRACH
The MSGA in 2-step RACH comprise a PRACH and a PUSCH. The PRACH resources for
2-step RACH in time/frequency domain can be either shared with 4-step RACH or
can be configured to be separate. All the preamble formats and the PRACH
configuration indexes defined in Rel-15 and in Rel-16 NR-U and TEI can be
used. In case of shared time domain PRACH resources between 4-step RACH and
2-step RACH, different preambles are allocated to differentiate the RA types.
The mapping between SSB and PRACH occasion reuses that for 4-step RACH.
MSGA structure: PUSCH
2-step RACH uses a specified mapping rule to determine the PUSCH resource of
MSGA that is associated with the selected PRACH resource. Each PRACH slot is
mapped to a number of PUSCH occasions with associated DMRS resource, once the
UE selects a preamble in a PRACH occasion, the corresponding PUSCH occasion
and DMRS resource can be determined by a predefined mapping order.
MSGB
After MSGA transmission, the UE monitors the downlink for a response from the
network within a configured window. This response from the network is called
the MSGB. The contents of MSGB depend on whether or not the gNB is able to
successfully detect both the PRACH and the PUSCH parts.
\- If the PRACH is detected but the decoding of PUSCH fails, network will
include a fallback indication in MSGB and the subsequent UE procedure will be
similar to that for a UE monitoring msg2 in the 4 step RACH.
\- If both preamble and PUSCH are decoded, network will include a successRAR
and reception of this at the UE completes the contention resolution. HARQ
feedback is enabled for the successful reception of the successRAR.

Summary based on the input provided by CATT in RP-200912.
UE battery life is an important aspect of the user's experience.The RAN1 study
of the Rel-16 UE power saving had shown substantial power saving gain
comparing to considered Rel-15 NR features such as DRX operation, with UE
adaptation in frequency domain, time domain, antenna domain, tight control of
DRX operations, and reducing PDCCH monitoring with different traffic types.
The work item of UE power saving in NR includes the power saving techniques,
such as DRX adaptation, cross-slot scheduling, and maximum MIMO layer
adaptation in CONNECTED state, fast transition out of CONNECTED state, and
reduced RRM measurements in idle/inactive states. The UE assistance
information is part of the work to enable the UE to feedback its preferred
configuration to achieve desired power saving.
The UE power saving work in Rel-16 focuses on the power saving techniques in
CONNECTED state, which includes DRX adaptation, cross-slot scheduling, maximum
MIMO layer adaptation, and fast transition out of CONNECTED state. The RRM
measurement reductions are the power saving techniques specified in
idle/inactive states.UE assistance information is supported for the UE to
feedback its preferred configuration of the specific power saving technique.
[Power Saving Techniques in CONNECTED state]{.underline}
The power saving techniques are dynamically triggered by L1 signaling
indicated from PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel or semi-statically
configured by RRC signaling.The PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel reuses
the existing PDCCH search space and CORESET configurations with dynamic TCI
states with DCI field indicating the adaptation to achieve UE power saving,
such as UE wakeup in the DRX operation, cross-slot scheduling, and maximum
MIMO layer adaptation through BWP switching.
\- DRX adaptation
The DRX adaptation power saving technique is to configure the PDCCH-based
power saving signal/channel at the active BWP before the beginning of DRX ON
for UE monitoring with the indication of UE wakeup or not depending on whether
there is data for UE to receive. A new DCI format 2_6 is introduced with CRC
scrambled by PS-RNTI (DCP) which contains the wakeup indication as well as
SCell dormancy indication if configured.A PS-offset is semi-statically
configured before DRX ON defining the start of the interval for the DCP
monitor occasion as shown in Figure 1.More than one monitoring occasions could
be configured for DCP on PCell for CA and SpCell for DC based on the search
space and CORESET configurations.Minimum time gap is specified as the UE
processing time as shown in Figure 1. UE is not required to monitor DCP at the
interval of minimum time gap and within Active Time.
When DCP monitoring occasion collides with other procedures with higher
priority in PDCCH monitoring, the monitoring occasion is considered invalid.UE
follows legacy behavior when all the configured monitoring occasions are
invalid.UE is configured by RRC to wake up or not when no DCP is detected with
valid monitoring occasions.One DCP can be configured to control PDCCH
monitoring during on-duration for one or more UEs independently. UE is also
configured by RRC whether to report periodic L1-RSRP or periodic CSI/L1-SINR
when UE is not indicated to wake up at the DRX ON.
\- Cross slot scheduling
Power saving technique with cross-slot scheduling facilitates UE to achieve
power saving with the assumption that it won't be scheduled to receive PDSCH,
triggered to receive A-CSI or transmit a PUSCH at the scheduling slot within
Active Time. A 1-bit minimum scheduling offset in DCI format 1_1 and 0_1
enables dynamic switching of DL and UL minimum scheduling offset values.
\- Maximum MIMO Layer Adaptation
UE power saving techniques with the adaptation to the DL maximum number of
MIMO layers could be achieved by dynamic switching of BWPs, which the DL
maximum number of MIMO layers are configured to be different.
\- Fast transition out of CONNECTED state
UE can feed back the assistance information of its preference to be
released/suspended for gNB to get UE transitioning out of CONNECTED state
quickly when there is no further data arrival.
**[Power Saving Techniques in idle/inactive state]{.underline}**
\- Reduced RRM measurements in idle/inactive state
Power saving in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE can also be achieved by UE relaxing
neighbour cells RRM measurements when it meets the criteria determining it is
in low mobility and/or not at cell edge.
**[UE assistance information]{.underline}**
UE assistance information allows the UE to feedback its preferred
configuration, such as c-DRX configuration, aggregated bandwidth, SCell
configuration, MIMO configuration, RRC state, minimum scheduling offset values
in order for network to assist UE achieving power saving gain.

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in RP-201757.
This Feature introduces wireless relaying among RAN nodes to 5G. Its
objectives closely followed the recommendation of the study item on IAB for
NR, which are defined in TR 38.874. The following features are supported:
â€¢ Multi-hop backhauling for flexible range extension for both FR1 and FR2.
â€¢ Topology adaptation including redundant connectivity to optimize backhauling
performance and to respond to backhaul (BH) link failure.
â€¢ Mapping of UE bearers to backhaul RLC channels and QoS enforcement over
backhaul RLC channels to meet E2E QoS requirements.
â€¢ Scalability to a large number of UEs.
â€¢ Flexible deployment allowing IAB-node operation in EN-DC mode with EPC or in
SA-mode with 5GC.
â€¢ Support for NR-NR DC from the UE and IAB-node perspective (see NOTE 1)
â€¢ Efficient operation for both inband and out-of-band relaying.
â€¢ Over the air (OTA) synchronization across IAB topology.
â€¢ Support of Rel-15 UEs.
[IAB architecture]{.underline}
IAB introduces the IAB-node and IAB-donor to 5G RAN. The IAB-node is the
relaying node and supports access and backhauling via NR. The IAB-donor is the
terminating node of NR backhauling on network side. It represents a gNB with
additional functionality to support IAB. Backhauling can occur via a single
hop or via multiple hops.
The IAB-node supports gNB-DU functionality to terminate the NR access
interface to UEs and next-hop IAB-nodes, and to terminate the F1 protocol to
the gNB-CU functionality on the IAB-donor. The gNB-DU functionality on the
IAB-node is also referred to as IAB-DU.
In addition to the gNB-DU functionality, the IAB-node also supports a subset
of the UE functionality referred to as IAB-MT, which includes, e.g., physical
layer, layer-2, RRC and NAS functionality to connect to the gNB-DU of another
IAB-node or the IAB-donor, to connect to the gNB-CU on the IAB-donor, and to
the core network.
The IAB-MT can access the network using either SA mode or EN-DC. In EN-DC, the
IAB-MT connects via E-UTRA to a MeNB, and the IAB-donor terminates X2-C as
SgNB.
All IAB-nodes that are connected to an IAB-donor via one or multiple hops form
a directed acyclic graph (DAG) topology with the IAB-donor as its root. In
this DAG topology, the neighbour node of the IAB-DU or the IAB-donor-DU is
referred to as child node and the neighbour node of the IAB-MT is referred to
as parent node. The direction toward the child node is referred to as
downstream while the direction toward the parent node is referred to as
upstream. The IAB-donor performs centralized resource-, topology- and route
management for the IAB topology.
[Backhaul transport]{.underline}
The F1 interface between IAB-DU and IAB-donor-CU uses the protocol stack and
security protection defined in Rel-15.
On the wireless backhaul, the Backhaul Adaptation Protocol (BAP) has been
introduced, which is a L2 sub-layer that carries the IP layer for the F1
interface and enables routing over multiple hops. The IP layer can also be
used for non-F1 traffic, such as OAM traffic.
On each backhaul link, the BAP PDUs are carried by BH RLC channels. Multiple
BH RLC channels can be configured on each BH link to allow traffic
prioritization and QoS enforcement. To support a large quantity of BH RLC
channels on each BH link, e.g., for fine-granular QoS support, an extended
logical channel ID (eLCID) has been introduced.
The IAB-MT further establishes SRBs (carrying RRC and NAS) with the IAB-donor-
CU. For IAB-nodes operating in ENDC, the IAB-MT also establishes one or more
DRBs with the IAB-donor-CU, which can be used, e.g., to carry OAM traffic.
These SRBs and DRBs are transported between the IAB-MT and its parent node
over Uu access channel(s).
On the BAP sublayer, packets are routed based on the BAP routing ID, which is
carried in the BAP header. The BAP routing ID consists of BAP address and BAP
path ID, where the BAP address indicates the destination node of the packet on
the BAP sublayer, and the BAP path ID indicates the routing path the packet
should follow to this destination.
The BAP sublayer further supports flow control in downstream direction, where
the IAB-node sends feedback information on available buffer size to its parent
node.
To reduce UL scheduling latency over multiple hops, the Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE
has been introduced, which can be sent by the IAB-node to its parent-node
based on expected rather than the buffered data.
For IAB-nodes using ENDC, backhauling is only supported via the NR link.
[IAB-node integration]{.underline}
A network integration procedure was defined for IAB-nodes. For IAB-nodes using
SA mode, this procedure consists of three phases.
In phase 1, the IAB-MT selects a suitable parent node and connects to the
network in the same manor as a UE including RRC connection setup with IAB-
donor-CU, authentication with the core network, context management and bearer
establishment. Prior to connection establishment, The IAB-MT determines if a
parent node supports IAB based on an the IAB-support indicator broadcast in
SIB1. The IAB-MT further indicates IAB capability to the network during the
RRC connection setup. The IAB-donor-CU forwards this indicator to the core
network which authorizes IAB operation in return.
In phase 2, the IAB-donor-CU configures BH RLC channels and the BAP sublayer
to enable transport of the backhaul to the new IAB-node. Further, IP addresses
can be allocated by RAN or OAM. These IP addresses are used by the IAB-DU for
backhauling of F1 traffic.
In phase 3, the IAB-DU is established using the Rel-15 F1 setup procedure. The
IAB-node includes the BAP address it obtained via RRC in phase 2 into F1-C to
indicate collocation of IAB-MT and IAB-DU to the IAB-donor-CU.
The network integration for IAB-nodes using ENDC uses a similar procedure. In
phase 1, the IAB-node first connects to an eNB, which selects and adds the
IAB-donor as a SN.
[Topology adaptation]{.underline}
The following procedures have been defined to allow the IAB network to
dynamically change its topology under operation:
IAB-node migration procedure: This procedure allows the IAB-node to change its
parent node underneath the same IAB-donor. The procedure is initiated by the
IAB-donor-CU. It leverages handover for the IAB-MT using SA mode and the SN-
change procedure for the IAB-MT using ENDC. The IAB-donor further configures
BH RLC channels and updates the BAP sublayer so that backhauling can occur via
the target path. F1 may be migrated to the new IP addresses that have been
allocated to the IAB-DU, if any.
Topological redundancy procedure: This procedure enables the establishment and
release of redundant paths in the IAB-topology underneath the same IAB-donor-
CU. The procedure is initiated by the IAB-donor-CU. It leverages SN-addition
for the IAB-MT using SA mode. The IAB-donor further configures BH RLC channels
and updates the BAP sublayer so that backhauling can also occur over the SCG
link. The IAB-donor can further configure multiple different routes on the BAP
sublayer. This route redundancy may be used for IP multi-homing of F1-C to
provide robustness. It may further be used for load balancing, where F1-U GTP
tunnels are assigned to separate routes. The routes are configured by the IAB-
donor-CU. For IAB-MT using ENDC, user plane traffic can only be exchanged via
NR. F1-C, however, can be routed via NR and/or via LTE/X2.
Backhaul RLF recovery procedure: This procedure enables IAB-nodes in SA mode
to migrate to another parent node underneath the same IAB-donor-CU, when the
IAB-MT declares backhaul RLF. The procedure is initiated by the IAB-MT upon
observation of BH RLF and uses RRC Connection Reestablishment. When RLF
recovery fails, the IAB-MT may send an RLF indication to its child nodes, so
that they can try to perform RLF recovery.
[PHY-layer specifications]{.underline}
The following physical layer procedures have been introduced for the support
of IAB:
Over-the-air time synchronization: The IAB-nodes and IAB-donor-DUs within the
IAB-topology are assumed to operate time-synchronized. The IAB-DU may use the
downlink signal received by the collocated IAB-MT from a parent, as a
reference to control its downlink timing using TA in conjunction with an
additional Tdelta parameter signalled via MAC-CE
Inter node discovery: An IAB-node can be configured to transmit and receive
SSB signals to discover neighbouring IAB-nodes. The configuration is expected
to not create a conflict between the IAB-DU SSB transmissions and the SSB
measurement windows configured for the collocated IAB-MT.
Random Access by IAB-MT: For IAB-MTs, a separate IAB-specific random access
configuration can be provided in addition to the UEs' random access
configuration. The IAB-specific random access configuration may be obtained by
extending the random access configurations defined for UEs via scaling the
periodicity and/or offsetting the position of the RACH occasions.
IAB Resource configuration: The IAB-donor-CU can confine the resources used by
the schedulers on an IAB-DU or IAB-donor-DU to account for multiplexing
constraints among BH and access links in the IAB topology. The configuration
assigns an attribute of Hard, Soft or Unavailable to each symbol of each
serving cell.
Scheduling can occur for symbols configured as Hard, whereas scheduling cannot
occur, except for some special cases, for symbols configured as Unavailable.
For symbols configured as Soft, scheduling can occur conditionally based on
explicit or implicit indication by the parent node. Explicit indication refers
to signalling by the parent node to the collocated IAB-MT via PDCCH, which
explicitly permits the usage of a designated Soft resource. Implicit
indication refers to the autonomous determination whether a Soft resource can
be used by the IAB-DU without creating a conflict for the collocated IAB-MT to
follow its parent's scheduling commands.
[RF and RRM requirements]{.underline}
RAN4 decided to define following RRM requirements for IAB-MT nodes:
RRC Connected State mobility: The random access requirements of IAB-MTs were
agreed to be same as those of UEs. For defining RRC re-establishment and RRC
release with redirection requirements of IAB-MTs, RAN4 used the same
requirements of UEs as a starting framework and then modified these further to
accommodate higher periodicity of SMTC windows in IAB nodes.
Timing: The transmit timing and timing adjust requirements of IAB-MTs are same
as those of UE requirements. The cell phase synchronization accuracy
requirement of IAB-DUs is same as that for Rel-15 gNBs.
Signalling Characteristics: RAN4 agreed to define radio link monitoring, beam
failure detection and candidate beam detection requirements for IAB-MTs. To
define these requirements, RAN4 used the same requirements for Rel-15 UEs as a
starting framework and then relaxed some of the evaluation periods by
additional scaling factors because IAB-MTs are static nodes.

Summary based on the input provided by ZTE Corporation in RP-200112.
In Release 15, the operating bands are specified for these eligible operations
with EN-DC configured. The EN-DC band combinations include at least one E-UTRA
operating band and a NR operation band. In moving forward to Release 16, the
configuration of EN-DC operation needs to be expanded for more simultaneous
uplink and downlink configurations, including band combination of LTE, FR1 and
FR2 bands.
New configurations still emerge from existing bands and whenever new band is
specified, it will create a potential for several new EN-DC configurations
consisting of 3 different bands DL with 3 different bands UL (1 LTE band UL
and 2 NR different band UL(i.e. 1CC LTE band + 1CC NR FR1 band + NR FR2 band),
or 2 LTE different band UL and 1 NR FR2 band UL).
The EN-DC configurations including NR CA will be introduced in a release
independent manner based on TS38.307, which will be updated depending on newly
introduced EN-DC configurations including NR CA.
All new ENDC configurations including NR with 3 bands will be defined under
this WI, where :
\- For only 1 NR band included, only NR FR2 band is applied
\- For only 2 NR bands included, 1 NR FR1 band and 1 NR FR2 band are included
and operated as inter-band CA
The companies can request their interesting ENDC configurations before each
3GPP RAN4 meeting. The WID was started from RAN #84 meeting, and will
completed at RAN #88 meeting.
Usually these configurations are the potential NR NSA deployment scenarios for
the operators. Each of the requested ENDC configurations includes at least
applicable frequencies if necessary, applicable bandwidths and bandwidth sets
if necessary, and Downlink ENDC configurations and Uplink ENDC configuration,
respectively. More importantly, each ENDC configuration shall be requested
with at least three other supporting companies. In addition, these
combinations will be introduced in a Rel-independent way starting from Rel-15.
All of the ENDC configurations requested by the companies are all captured in
two tables in the WID, shown as follow.
1\. EN-DC of 3 different bands DL(LTE 1 band + NR 2 bands) with 3 different
bands UL
2\. EN-DC of 3 different bands DL(LTE 2 bands + NR 1 band) with 3 different
bands UL
For the ENDC configuration in the WID, the RF requirements shall be specified,
including:
Analyse combinations that have self-desensitization due to following reasons:
\- TX Harmonic and/or intermodulation overlap of receive band
\- TX signal overlap of receiver harmonic frequency
\- TX frequency being in close proximity of one of the receive bands
\- Any other identified reasons such that insufficient cross band isolation,
harmonic mixing
For the combination where self-desensitization exists, specify at least needed
\- âˆ†TIB, c and âˆ†RIB, c
\- Reference sensitivity exceptions including MSD test cases
All of the study results are captured into TR37.716-33, and for the ENDC
configurations will be included in TS38.101-3 specification in the case of
these configurations are approved in RAN4 meeting.

RP-190489 Intel
Summary based on the input provided by ZTE Corporation in RP-200170.
The work item on NR mobility enhancements specifies solutions to reduce
interruption time during HO (by Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS) handover),
and to improve HO/SCG change reliability and robustness (by Conditional
Handover (CHO), Conditional PSCell Change (CPC) and T312 based fast failure
recovery).
The corresponding changes are captured into TS 38-series specifications and
TS37.340/TS36.331 in [2]-[5].
[Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS) handover]{.underline}
DAPS Handover is a handover procedure that maintains the source gNB connection
after reception of RRC message for handover and until releasing the source
cell after successful random access to the target gNB.
\- The UE maintains DL reception and UL transmission for user data with source
upon receiving DAPS HO command before successful RACH in target (UL
switching);
\- Upon receiving the indication on UL switching, for UL the PDCP layer will
only forward the user data to target path;
\- The UE will continue the reception of DL from both source and target, and
provides UL to both source (PDCP will not forward the user data to low layer)
and target node before release of source.
\- Upon HO failure, the UE can use source link for recovery instead of
reestablishment if the source link is still valid;
[Conditional Handover (CHO)]{.underline}
Conditional Handover (CHO) is a handover procedure that is executed only when
the configured execution condition(s) are met.
To improve the robustness, the network can provide the up to 8 candidate cell
configuration(s) associated with execution condition (s) to UE. The UE
maintains connection with source gNB after receiving CHO configuration, and
starts evaluating the CHO execution conditions for the candidate cell(s). If
at least one CHO candidate cell satisfies the corresponding CHO execution
condition, the UE detaches from the source gNB, applies the stored
corresponding configuration for that selected candidate cell, synchronises to
that candidate cell and completes the RRC handover procedure by sending
RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the target gNB. The UE releases stored
CHO configurations after successful completion of RRC handover procedure.
Upon failure, the UE will perform CHO if the selected cell is CHO candidate
cell and it is the first time of recovery and if the network allows CHO based
recovery.
[Conditional PSCell Change (CPC)]{.underline}
Conditional PSCell Change is a PSCell change procedure that is executed only
when PSCell execution condition(s) are met.
To improve the robustness, the network can provide the up to 8 candidate cell
configuration(s) associated with execution condition (s) to UE. If CPC is
configured in the RRCReconfiguration, the UE maintains connection with source
PSCell after receiving CPC configuration, and starts evaluating the CPC
execution conditions for the candidate PSCell(s). If at least one CPC
candidate PSCell satisfies the corresponding CPC execution condition, the UE
detaches from the source PSCell, applies the stored corresponding
configuration for the selected candidate PSCell and synchronises to that
candidate PSCell. The UE completes the CPC execution procedure by an
ULInformationTransferMRDC message to the MN which includes an embedded
RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the new PSCell if SRB3 is not
configured, otherwise the UE sends RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the
new PSCell directly.
Upon SCG failure, same as MR-DC, the UE will transmit the SCG Failure
Information message to the MN.
In Rel-16, conditional handover based NR PSCell addition/change for any
architecture option with NR PSCell is supported, but limit to intra SN change
without MN involvement.
[T312 based fast failure recovery]{.underline}
T312 based solution (same as LTE) is used for both PCell and PSCell. The
motivation of T312 is to speed up RLF recovery procedure by triggering re-
establishment procedure sooner using a shorter timer than T310. T312 on PSCell
can be configured for SCG measurement configurations provided over SRB3 or
SRB1.

China Telecom
Summary based on the input provided by China Telecom in RP-200727.
In NR_DL256QAM_FR2 WI, the RF requirements include BS modulation quality, UE
maximum input level and BS conformance test requirements were specified to
make RAN4 specification support FR2 DL 256QAM. This will enable the commercial
deployment and also guarantee the transceiver performance for the feature of
FR2 DL 256QAM from both BS and UE sides.
This WI firstly evaluated the feasibility of FR2 DL 256QAM based on link level
simulation, system level simulation and implementation study, and concluded
that FR2 DL 256QAM is feasible and beneficial in certain of identified
applicable scenarios (see TR 38.883 on \"Study on FR2 DL 256QAM\").
After the feasibility confirmation, the WI introduced corresponding FR2 DL
256QAM specific RF requirements listed as
\- For 38.104: BS modulation quality expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)
requirement which is specified as 3.5%, same required value with FR1.
\- For 38.101-2: UE Maximum input level for both single carrier and intra-band
CA which reflects the receiver linearity capability, and the related Fixed
Reference Channel which is used to test the Maximum input level.
\- For 38.141-2: Manufacturers declarations for the output power, Test models,
Test procedures and Test EVM requirement.

Summary based on the input provided by CMCC in RP-200774.
This work item introduces SON and MDT features support in NR, including MRO
(Mobility Robustness Optimisation), MLB (Mobility Load Balancing), RACH
optimization, MDT (Minimization of Drive Test) and L2 measurements.
Specification of these features will help mobile operators reduce the
CAPEX/OPEX and improve the use experience.
This work item produces a new specification TS 38.314: L2 measurements for NR.
The key functionalities of this WI are described as below:
**Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO)** aims at detecting and enabling
correction of mobility related problems including Connection failure due to
intra-system or inter-system mobility, Inter-system Unnecessary HO and Inter-
system HO ping-pong. MRO also provides means to distinguish the above problems
from NR coverage related problems and other problems, not related to mobility.

\- Intra-system Too Late Handover
\- Intra-system Too Early Handover
\- Intra-system Handover to Wrong Cell
\- Connection failure due to inter-system mobility
\- Inter-system/ Too Late Handover
\- Inter-system/ Too Early Handover
\- Inter-system Unnecessary HO
\- Inter-system Ping-pong
**Mobility load balancing (MLB)** is to distribute load evenly among cells and
among areas of cells, or to transfer part of the traffic from congested cell
or from congested areas of cells, or to offload users from one cell, cell
area, carrier or RAT to achieve network energy saving.
Intra-RAT and intra-system inter-RAT load balancing scenarios are specified
and includes the functions ofLoad reporting, Load balancing action based on
handovers and Adapting handover and/or reselection configuration.
The load reporting function is executed by exchanging load information over
the Xn/X2/F1/E1 interfaces via Resource Status Reporting Initiation & Resource
Status Reporting procedures.
The load metrics that have been specified consist of
\- Radio resource usage (per-cell and per SSB area PRB usage: DL/UL GBR PRB
usage, DL/UL non-GBR PRB usage, DL/UL total PRB usage, and DL/UL scheduling
PDCCH CCE usage);
\- TNL capacity indicator (UL/DL TNL offered capacity and available capacity);
\- Cell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator);
\- Capacity value (per cell, per SSB area and per slice: UL/DL available
capacity);
\- HW capacity indicator (offered throughput and available throughput over E1,
percentage utilisation over F1);
\- RRC connections (number of RRC connections, and available RRC Connection
Capacity);
\- Number of active UEs.
**RACH optimization** is supported by UE reported information made available
at the NG RAN node and by PRACH parameters exchange between NG RAN nodes.
The functionalities supported over the interfaces consist of
\- PRACH configuration per served cell is signalled from DU to CU and over Xn
\- PRACH configuration of Served Cells over X2
\- RACH report from UE over Uu

\- CEF (Connection Establishment Failure) report
\- Resume failure report
\- Immediate MDT for EN-DC
**L2 measurements.** In this work item, a new spec TS 38.314 was produced to
capture the measurements performed by network or the UE that are transferred
over the standardised interfaces in order to support NR radio link operations,
radio resource management (RRM), network operations and maintenance (OAM),
minimization of drive tests (MDT) and self-organising networks (SON).
The specified measurements includes

### 19.1.11 Introduction of NR FDD bands with variable duplex and
corresponding framework
**841001** **Introduction of NR FDD bands with variable duplex and
corresponding framework** **NR_FDD_bands_varduplex** **R4** **RP-191567**
**Huawei**
* * *
841101 **Core part: Introduction of NR FDD bands with variable duplex and
corresponding framework** NR_FDD_bands_varduplex-Core R4 RP-191567 Huawei
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-201019.
Supplementary downlink (SDL) frequency bands are defined within NR
specifications in accordance with regulated licensed bands such as in the
1400-1500MHz range in Europe, and Uplink Sharing is defined as a means to
operate NR uplink on the uplink resources of other bands, e.g. sharing the
uplink carrier with that of an LTE carrier. Such a configuration may be
particularly useful when there is not a desire to allocate downlink NR
resources in a 2nd downlink carrier, e.g. for an EN-DC configuration with the
SDL band as part of the secondary cell group (SCG).
This work item allows the uplink and downlink of the introduced bands to be
from 2 different licensed spectrum blocks, and new paired bands are defined in
the RF specifications as n91, n92, n93 and n94.
**[System parameters]{.underline}**
System parameters for the new variable duplex FDD bands are defined in all the
related RAN4 specifications including, operating bands, channel bandwidth,
rasters, Tx-Rx separation, etc.
[Operating bands and NR-ARFCN]{.underline}
Newly introduced variable duplex bands have the same UL frequency parts as in
SUL bands either n81 or n82, while they also have the same DL frequency parts
as in SDL bands n75 or n76.
n91 832 MHz -- 862 MHz 1427 MHz -- 1432 MHz FDD^9^
* * *
n92 832 MHz -- 862 MHz 1432 MHz -- 1517 MHz FDD^9^ n93 880 MHz -- 915 MHz 1427
MHz -- 1432 MHz FDD^9^ n94 880 MHz -- 915 MHz 1432 MHz -- 1517 MHz FDD^9^
A note 9 is specified in the table that says 'Variable duplex operation does
not enable dynamic variable duplex configuration by the network, and is used
such that DL and UL frequency ranges are supported independently in any valid
frequency range for the band'. This comes from the concern that the operator
may want to dynamically configure the duplex distance used in the network.
**[Channel bandwidth]{.underline}**
Since the frequency parts of the variable duplex FDD bands are acquired
independently, asymmetric bandwidths must be introduced to accommodate most of
the desired deployments.
NR Band Channel bandwidths for UL (MHz) Channel bandwidths for DL (MHz)
* * *
n91^1^ 10 5 n92^1^ 5 10, 15, 20 10 15, 20 n93^1^ 10 5 n94^1^ 5 10, 15, 20 10
15, 20 NOTE 1: The assignment of the paired UL and DL channels are subject to
a TX-RX separation as specified in clause 5.4.4.
Hence other bandwidth configurations of the variable duplex FDD bands follow
what was defined for the corresponding UL or DL bands that are consisted of.
**[Tx-Rx separation]{.underline}**
It is worth noting that Tx-Rx separation is defined in a different way for the
variable duplex bands since the default separation no longer applies with
them.
+-----------------------+------------------------------+ | **NR Operating Band** | **TX -- RX\ | | | carrier centre frequency\ | | | separation** | +-----------------------+------------------------------+ | n91 | 570 MHz -- 595 MHz | | | | | | (NOTE 2) | +-----------------------+------------------------------+ | n92 | 575 MHz -- 680 MHz (_Î¼_ = 0) | | | | | | 580 MHz -- 675 MHz (_Î¼_ = 1) | | | | | | (NOTE 2) | +-----------------------+------------------------------+ | n93 | 517 MHz -- 547 MHz | | | | | | (NOTE 2) | +-----------------------+------------------------------+ | n94 | 522 MHz -- 632 MHz (_Î¼_ = 0) | | | | | | 527 MHz -- 627 MHz (_Î¼_ = 1) | | | | | | (NOTE 2) | +-----------------------+------------------------------+
Note 2 says that the range of Tx-Rx frequency separation given paired UL and
DL channel bandwidths BW~UL~ and BW~DL~ is given by the respective lower and
upper limit F~DL_low~ -- F~UL_high~ + 0.5(BW~DL~ + BW~UL~) and F~DL_high~ --
F~UL_low~ -- 0.5(BW~DL~ + BW~UL~). The UL and DL channel bandwidth
combinations specified in Table 5.3.5-1 and 5.3.6-1 depend on the subcarrier
spacing configuration _Î¼._
**[UE requirements]{.underline}**
UE requirements considering the characteristics when operating in the variable
duplex bands and band combinations are defined including REFSENS and related
configurations.
[REFSENS and UL configurations]{.underline}
REFSENS requirements follow the ones defined for n75 and n76 correspondingly
for the variable duplex bands but UL configurations are not necessarily the
same with those defined for n8 and n20. For n20, additional restrictions on
the UL RBs are specified so that the same REFSENS value can be achieved with
such a narrow duplex distance. Since the variable duplex bands have much
larger expected Tx-Rx separation, additional restrictions on the UL RB
allocations are not specified.
**[BS requirements]{.underline}**
In this work item, BS requirements span among a series of specifications such
as 38.104, 38.141-1, 37.104, 37.105, 37.141, 37.145-1, 37.145-2, 36.104,
36.141, etc. Mainly coexistence requirements are defined in these specs.
[Additional spurious emission requirements]{.underline}
Respective requirements which correspond to BS spurious limits for co-
existence with systems operating in the new variable duplex FDD bands are
introduced in the mentioned spec, with maximum measured spurious levels and
bandwidth configurations.
[Out of band blocking requirements]{.underline}
Another set of Tx requirements is also defined with the similar manner as the
above one. The requirements apply when co-location with other BS-s operating
in the variable duplex FDD bands is observed.
[Receiver response under co-location requirements]{.underline}
Receiver response requirements are defined in the mentioned specifications
that the BS operating in the introduced bands should have the ability to block
unwanted interband interferences from any other collocated BS.
For all the above mentioned BS requirements, both conducted and radiated
requirements are defined.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in RP-190144.
Rel-14 NR study showed that duplexing flexibility with cross-link interference
mitigation shows better user throughput compared to static UL/DL operation or
dynamic UL/DL operation without interference mitigation in indoor hotspot
(4GHz and 30GHz) and urban macro scenarios (4GHz and 2GHz). Furthermore, semi-
static and/or dynamic DL/UL resource assignments should also consider
coexistence issues particularly among different operators where tight
coordination are challenged. For efficient coexistence, not only coexistence
requirements need to be understood but also advanced mechanisms to mitigate
interference such as TRP-to-TRP measurement and adaptation based on
measurements should be considered. The Rel-16 Work Item Cross Link
Interference (CLI) handling to support flexible resource adaptation for
unpaired NR cells achieves the following objectives [1]:
â€¢ CLI measurements and reporting at a UE (i.e., CLI-RSSI and SRS-RSRP), and
network coordination mechanism(s) (i.e., exchange of intended DL/UL
configuration) are developed.
â€¢ Perform coexistence study to identify conditions of coexistence among
different operators in adjacent channels is accomplished.
In NR deployment on lower TDD frequency, the impact of the troposphere bending
will continue existing if no special mechanisms are introduced. In the RIM SI,
the frameworks for mechanisms for gNBs to start and terminate the
transmission/detection of reference signal(s), the functionalities and
requirements of the corresponding RS(s) as well as the design of the RS(s),
and the backhaul-based coordination mechanisms among gNBs have been studied.
It is recommended to specify RIM RS(s) to support identifying remote
interference related information, it is also recommended to specify the inter-
set RIM backhaul signalling via the core network for backhaul-based solution.
The Rel-16 Work Item Remote Interference Management (RIM) to deal with
mitigation of the remote interference caused by gNBs achieves the following
objectives [1]:
â€¢ RIM RS resource and configurations, and the inter-set RIM backhaul
signalling via the core network to convey the messages of "RIM-RS detected"
and "RIM-RS disappeared are developed.
â€¢ Corresponding OAM functions to support RIM operation is identified.
[CLI handling]{.underline}
Once different TDD UL/DL configurations are applied among neighboring cells,
UL transmission from a UE in a cell causes interference to DL reception of
some other UEs in the rest of the neighboring cells. The interference is
referred as inter-cell UE-to-UE cross link interference (CLI). To mitigate an
inter-cell UE-to-UE CLI, gNBs can exchange and coordinate the intended TDD
UL/DL configuration over Xn and F1 interfaces. Taking into account the
exchanged information, a gNB may decide the transmission and reception pattern
in order to avoid CLI to neighboring cell or from neighboring cell.
For CLI handling, two types of CLI measurements and reporting (i.e., CLI-
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurement and SRS-Reference Signal
Received Power (RSRP) measurement) are specified. For CLI-RSSI measurement,
the victim UE measures the total received power over configured CLI-RSSI
measurement resource. For SRS-RSRP measurement, the victim UE measures the
RSRP over configured SRS resource(s) which is/are transmitted from one or
multiple aggressor UE(s). Then, Layer 3 filtering can be applied to the
measurement result for both CLI-RSSI measurement and SRS-RSRP measurement. For
measurement result reporting for both CLI-RSSI measurement and SRS-RSRP
measurement, event triggered and periodic reporting are supported.
Furthermore, CLI measurement and reporting can be configured for NR cells in
multi-carrier option.
Semi-static and/or dynamic DL/UL resource assignment causes interferers
between networks on adjacent channels. It has been tasked to investigate the
adjacent channel co-existence effects arising when CLI, or more generically
dynamic TDD is operated in an aggressor network. The technical report captures
a description of the adjacent channel interference effects that arise with
dynamic TDD as well as a simulation investigation of adjacent channel
interference in a number of different deployment scenarios [2].
[RIM]{.underline}
Due to the atmospheric ducting phenomenon, the DL signals of an aggressor cell
in unpaired spectrum can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell in the
same unpaired spectrum bandwidth that is far away from the aggressor cell.
Such interference is termed as remote interference. A remote interference
scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs
may execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of
their respective cells.
To mitigate remote interference, RIM frameworks for coordination between
victim and aggressor gNBs are specified. The coordination communication in RIM
frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. In both frameworks, all gNBs in
a victim set can simultaneously transmit an identical RIM reference signal
carrying the victim set ID over the air.
In the wireless framework, RIM-RS (RIM reference signal) type 1 and RIM-RS
type 2 are specified. Upon reception of the RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type
1) from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measurement, and may send
back a RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type 2) carrying the aggressor set ID if
configured, and may undertake interference mitigation actions. The RIM
reference signal (RIM-RS type 2) sent by the aggressor is able to facilitate
estimation whether the atmospheric ducting phenomenon between victim and
aggressor sets exists.
In the RIM backhaul framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal
(RIM-RS type 1) from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measurement,
establish backhaul coordination towards the victim gNB set. The backhaul
messages which carry the detection or disappearance indication are aggregated
at gNB-CU via F1 interface and sent from individual aggressor gNBs to
individual victim gNBs via NG interface, where the signalling is transparent
to the core network.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in RP-201718.
In Rel-16, several FR1 non-spectrum related topics are included in one WI
targeting for UE RF requirements enhancement.
In this WI, RF requirements, corresponding new feature groups and
functionalities are introduced for both uplink and downlink enhancements. This
enables the 5G commercial deployment requirements on FR1 fulfilled.
In Rel-15, almost-contiguous allocations for CP-OFDM was introduced for power
class 3 UE. This allows UE to be scheduled with non-contiguous PUSCH
allocation within one carrier which is partitioned by short PUCCH of other
users. In Rel-16, RAN4 continues the work and completed RF requirement for
HPUE on almost-contiguous CP-OFDM allocations.
FR1 Intra-band contiguous DL CA is up to 200MHz aggregated channel bandwidth
in Rel-15. Based on commercial deployment requirement, RAN4 enhances intra-
band contiguous DL CA to 300MHz in Rel-16, the corresponding RF requirements
are completed within this WI. Meanwhile, intra-band non-contiguous DL CA is
introduced considering latest 5G spectrum allocation is some country/region.
In correspondence, FR1 intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous UL CA are also
introduced from Rel-16, all RF requirements are completed within the WI.
Besides RF requirement, RAN4 also recognized the dependency relation among
bandwidth class, PA architecture and MIMO layer for UE capability indicating.
Additional DC location reporting UE capability is introduced to improve UL
256QAM performance for intra-band UL CA.
In Rel-15, inter-band UL CA, SA SUL and inter-band EN-DC RF requirements are
specified assuming 0us switching period between 2 UL carriers when TDM
operated, it leads to that UE cannot support 2Tx transmission when UE switch
to one carrier if no switching period is reserved for the UE. In Rel-16,
switching period between case 1 and case 2 is introduced to enable enhancement
on UL performance with 2Tx transmission on one UL carrier for inter-band UL
CA, SA SUL and inter-band EN-DC. For which, time mask including switching
period and transient period between 2 carriers are specified. For inter-band
UL CA and SA SUL, the switching periods are located in either NR carrier as
indicated in RRC signalling, while for inter-band EN-DC, the switching periods
are only located in NR carrier. In correspondence, UE capability on
uplinkTxSwithingPeriod is introduced as 35Î¼s, 140Î¼s and 210Î¼s (210Î¼s only for
inter-band UL CA and SA SUL). Meanwhile, UE DL interruption is allowed when
configured with difficult band combinations.
Time masks for ULSUP-TDM that accounts for UL timing misalignment between the
EUTRAN and NR cell groups are further modified in this WI, additional 2.2Î¼s
transient is added.

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in RP-201984.
This work item developed various UR RF enhancements for FR2. Basis for the WI
was the features that were not developed in REL15 due to lack of time.
The following enhancements were introduced:
1\. MPE: UE can report to network how much P-MPR it uses or is going to use
because of MPE. Based on this reporting network can take actions to prevent
sudden radio link failures.
2\. Beam correspondence: Requirements for SSB-based and CSI-RS based BC were
developed. This allows network to efficiently deploy different beam widths for
SSB and CSI-RS. This enables e.g. to deploy wider SSB based beams for idle
mode UEs and narrower CSI-RS based beams for RRC connected mode UEs.
3\. Interband DL CA: Requirements were developed for band combination
CA_n260-n261 based on independent beam management.
4\. DL Intra-band CA BW Enhancement: New frequency separation classes Fs were
introduced for up to 2400 MHz separation. Furthermore frequency separation
classes for DL-only spectrum Fsd were introduced. The DL-only frequency
spectrum is the width of UE frequency spectrum available to network to
configure DL CCs only, and it extends on one-side of the bidirectional
spectrum in contiguous manner with no frequency gap between the two.
5\. Non-contiguous intra-band uplink CA: Requirements were developed for n260
for up to three uplink sub-blocks.
6\. MPR enhancements: Zero dB MPR range was extended to cover more
allocations.
7\. Output power boost when in-band emissions are suspended: 1 dB boost was
introduced for QPSK modulation.
8\. Multiband relaxation framework enhancement: Based on RAN5 LS MBR framework
was modified. REL15 retains original MBR concept but introduced a relaxation
cap. REL16 adopted new concept where relaxation defined per band basis.

Summary based on the input provided by Intel Corporation, ZTE Corporation,
Apple in RP-201884.
The work item on NR RRM enhancement [1] introduces a number of enhanced NR RRM
requirements on top of the baseline RRM requirements defined in the scope of
the Rel-15 NR WI [2]. In particular, the RRM requirements for the following
procedures are introduced in the scope of the work item:
\- SRS carrier switching
\- Multiple Scell activation/deactivation
\- CGI reading with autonomous gap for NR capable UE
\- BWP switching on multiple CCs
\- Inter-band CA requirement for FR2
\- Inter-frequency measurement without MG
\- Mandatory measurement gap patterns
\- Spatial relation switch for uplink
\- UE specific channel BW change
The corresponding changes are captured in TS 38-series and 36-series
specifications [3]-[8].
[SRS carrier switching RRM requirements]{.underline}
SRS carrier switching functionality was defined for NR and LTE carriers in the
scope of the Rel-15 NR WI [2], however, the respective requirements were not
introduced in the Rel-15 scope. In the Rel-16 NR RRM Enhancements WI the
specific UE interruption requirements for the SRS carrier switching are
defined for the following cases:
\- LTE SRS carrier switching impacting NR CC
\- NR SRS carrier switching impacting LTE CC
\- NR SRS carrier switching impacting NR CC
The corresponding interruption RRM requirements are specified in TS38.133
clause 8.2 and TS36.133 clause 7.32.2.13.
[Multiple SCell activation/deactivation RRM requirements]{.underline}
In accordance to NR design multiple SCells can be activated/deactivated
simultaneously. However, in Rel-15 only single SCell activation/deactivation
NR RRM requirements were specified which resulted in an inefficient use of
network resources. In the Rel-16 NR RRM Enhancements WI, te SCell activation
and deactivation delay and interruption requirements for the case of multiple
SCell activation/deactivation in FR1, FR2, and FR1+FR2 are introduced. The
corresponding RRM requirements are specified in TS38.133 clause 8.3.7 and
8.3.8.
[CGI reading with autonomous gap for NR capable UE]{.underline}
In Rel-16, the acquisition of CGI information from a neighbouring cell using
autonomous gaps is supported. The NR cell CGI reading requirements are defined
for NR capable UE in LTE SA, NR SA UE, EN-DC UE, NE-DC UE, and NR-DC. Besides
that, the requirements for LTE cell CGI reading for NR SA UE, EN-DC UE, NE-DC
UE, and NR-DC UE are defined. The RRM requirements are specified in TS38.133
clause 8.2, 9 and TS36.133 clause 7.32.2, 7.37, 7.36.2.
[BWP switching on multiple CCs]{.underline}
The Rel-15 NR UE BWP switching requirements covered the scenario where a
network configured BWP switching on a single component carrier. In practice,
the network may configure BWP switching on multiple component carriers and a
predictable UE behavior is important. In Rel-16 NR RRM Enhancements WI the
requirements for both simultaneous and non-simultaneous BWP switching on
multiple CCs, covering DCI based, timer based and RRC based BWP switching are
defined. The respective RRM requirements are specified in TS38.133 clause
8.6.2A, 8.6.2B and 8.6.3A.
[Inter-band CA requirement for FR2]{.underline}
The support of the FR2 inter-band CA was introduced in the scope of the FR2 RF
WI [9]. In particular, the functionality to support independent beam
management on the different CCs was introduced in the scope of [9]. The RRM
requirements for inter-band CA requirement for FR2 UE measurement capability
of independent Rx beam are defined in the scope of the NR RRM enhancements WI.
The RRM requirements are specified in TS38.133 clause 9.2.5 and 9.5.6.
[Inter-frequency measurement without MG]{.underline}
In Rel-15 NR, all the inter-frequency measurements have to be done within
measurement gap. However, from UE implementation perspective inter-frequency
measurement can be done without MG (inter-frequency RRM measurement and
serving cell data reception/transmission can be done concurrently) under
certain conditions. In Rel-16, RAN4 defines conditions under which UE can
perform inter-frequency measurement without MG. RAN4 also introduces
corresponding RRM requirement for CSSF update, which can be found in TS38.133
clause 9.1.5.
[Mandatory measurement gap patterns]{.underline}
Only measurement gap patterns 0 and 1 are mandatorily supported in Rel-15.
However, some other measurement gap patterns are also very important in
balancing gap overhead and measurement performance. In Rel-16 additional
mandatory measurement gap patterns were defined in Rel-16.
â€¢ GP#17, GP#18 and GP#19 shall be additional mandatory
â€¢ GP#2, GP#3 and GP#11 shall be additional mandatory for NR only measurement
Besides, a capability to support measurement gap patterns for NR only
measurements was introduced. Definition of NR only measurement gaps can be
found in TS38.133 Table 9.1.2-2 and Table 9.1.2-3.
[Spatial relation switch for uplink]{.underline}
Uplink spatial relation can be changed since Rel-15. However, in Rel-15 RAN4
only specified RRM requirements for downlink spatial relation change. In
Rel-16, delay requirements for spatial relation switch for uplink channels and
SRS are defined. Corresponding requirements are specified in TS38.133 clause
8.12.
[UE specific channel BW change]{.underline}
Both active BWP and UE specific channel BW can be dynamically changed in
Rel-15. However, in RAN4 RRM only active BWP change requirements were
specified in Rel-15. In Rel-16, RRM requirements for UE specific channel BW
change are defined. Corresponding requirement can be found in TS38.133 clause
8.2.1.2.11, 8.2.2.2.8 and 8.13.

Summary based on the input provided by CATT in RP-201942.
Compared to SSB based RRM measurement, CSI-RS based measurement is more
refined and flexible in terms of resource usage, mobility enhancement and
handover reliability. This WI [1] targets to specify the RRM requirements for
CSI-RS based L3 measurement.
In R16 WI on RRM requirements of CSI-RS based L3 measurement, to guarantee the
mobility, the RRM requirements including synchronization assumption,
applicable CSI-RS configuration, CSI-RS based intra/inter-frequency
definition, intra/inter measurement requirements, and UE measurement
capability are specified.
Synchronization assumption
The CSI-RS based L3 measurement requirements in R16 WI are based on single FFT
implementation and UE supports using the serving cell timing for intra-
frequency measurements in Rel-16.
**Measurement bandwidth of CSI-RS resources** : The RRM requirements for CSI-
RS based L3 measurement in R16 WI are specified based on the CSI-RS
configuration {D=3, PRBâ‰¥48}.
**CSI-RS based intra/inter-frequency definition** : For CSI-RS based L3
measurement, the measurement is defined as a CSI-RS based intra-frequency
measurement provided that the centre frequency, SCS and CP type (applied for
SCS = 60KHz) of CSI-RS resources on the neighbour cell configured for
measurement are the same as the centre frequency, SCS and CP type of CSI-RS
resources on the serving cell indicated for measurement. Otherwise, the
measurement is defined as CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement.
**Scenarios for CSI-RS based L3 measurement requirements:** For CSI-RS based
intra-frequency measurement, the RRM requirements in R16 are defined for the
scenarios that all CSI-RS resources in the same MO have the same BW and the BW
of the CSI-RS on the neighbour cell is within the active BWP of the UE. No
requirement is defined when the BW of intra-MO is different from that of the
CSI-RS resources configured for the serving cell in Rel-16.
For CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement, the RRM requirements in R16 are
defined for the scenarios that all CSI-RS resources in the same MO have the
same BW and the CSI-RS resources to be measured with gap is not confined in
the active BWP.
**Intra/inter measurement requirements:** The RRM requirements for CSI-RS
based L3 measurement in R16 WI are specified for the case when associated SSB
is configured. So the measurement delay consists of cell identification delay,
SSB index acquisition time and CSI-RS measurement period.
The RRM requirements for CSI-RS based L3 measurement in R16 are specified
based on the assumption that CSI-RS based L3 measurement and SSB based L3 cell
detection/measurement share the measurement engines and applied when CSI-RS
resources are configured within a 5ms window at any location.
**UE measurement capability:** On top of the legacy measurement capability of
SSB based measurement, for the UE supporting CSI-RS based L3 measurement, UE
shall be able to measure at least 1 SSB intra-frequency layer and 1 CSI-RS
intra-frequency layer per serving cell, 8 NR inter-frequency layers including
SSB and CSI-RS in total.
The cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS can be the same set or a subset of
the cells monitored based on SSB.
For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period, the UE
shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements
for at least 32 CSI-RS resources for FR1and 32 CSI-RS resources for FR2.
For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period, the UE
shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements
for at least 14 CSI-RS resources for FR1 and 24 CSI-RS resources for FR2.

needed to supplement the BS radiated testing specifications as a single, 3GPP
external technical report, such that the information can be referred to from
external specifications and bodies.
Technical Report in TR 37.941 (both Rel-15 and Rel-16) is collecting inputs
from multiple existing RAN4 internal Technical Reports: TR 37.842; TR 37.843
and TR 38.817-02.
Collected inputs were aligned updated to provide consistent information on
Measurement Uncertainty (MU) and Test Tolerance (TT) derivations methodologies
for directional, TRP and co-location measurements. For the purpose of future
references and MU/TT values derivation verification, Excel spreadsheets were
attached to the TR (for TX/RX MU values in FR1 and FR2, as well as for the co-
location requirements).
The following OTA test methods were captured in Rel-15 version of the TR: IAC;
CATR; NF; PWS; 1D and reverb.
TR 37 941 is expected to be further updated with relevant inputs related to
the OTA BS testing, e.g. new or extended frequency ranges consideration, new
OTA test methodologies, etc.

#### 19.1.18.0 Introduction on NR_eMIMO
This work item introduces enhanced specification support for several key
aspects on multi-input multi-output (MIMO) operation where Rel.15 NR was found
deficient in terms of spectral efficiency, downlink/uplink transmit power
efficiency, signalling latency, and signalling overhead.
**First** , although high-resolution downlink (DL) channel state information
(CSI) can be made available to the gNB by the Type-II CSI (thereby
facilitating high DL spectral efficiency), the associated uplink (UL)
reporting overhead is prohibitively high. This would burden the system since
such high-resolution DL CSI is typically used with large number of users per
cell.
**Second** , Rel.15 mainly focuses on single-TRP-based transmission/reception
with ideal backhaul from UE perspective. Enhancements for Multi-TRP/panel
transmission are to further improve DL data rate and spectral efficiency by
fully utilizing multi-TRP/panel simultaneously with non-coherent joint
transmission (NCJT) in ideal/non-backhaul conditions, or further exploit
spatial diversity with time/frequency domain repetition to improve
transmission reliability.
**Third** , although Rel.15 supports flexible beam management (BM)
functionality to accommodate various implementation and usage scenarios,
Rel.15 BM signaling framework could require a large amount of signaling for
updating beam RS and pathloss reference RS for respective DL and UL signals
when the best DL-UL beam pair is changed frequently due to UE mobility,
rotation, or beam blockage. Therefore, in Rel.16, five features were
introduced for the purpose of BM signaling overhead and latency reduction.
Additionally, in Rel.15, L1-RSRP-based beam measurement and reporting are
supported. To facilitate interference-aware beam selection, L1-SINR-based beam
measurement and reporting were introduced. Finally, in Rel.15, beam failure
recovery (BFR) is supported only for spCell. To improve the performance and
reliability for SCell, BFR for SCell was introduced.
**Fourth** , a high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) issue identified for
Rel.15 DM-RS for PDSCH, PUSCH and PUCCH format 3 and 4 was corrected by
defining new Rel.16 DM-RS which have the same PAPR as its associated
data/control channel.
**Fifth** , in Rel.15 UL codebook-based transmission, the non-coherent and
partial-coherent codebook subsets --especially with lower rank transmission--
cannot reach the maximum output power (declared by the UE) with power scaling
mechanism. Three modes of UL full-power transmission and three UE capabilities
are specified to accommodate different power amplifier (PA) architectures.
#### 19.1.18.1 MU-MIMO CSI
For Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) transmission, the Precoding Matrix Indicator
(PMI) codebook is designed to represent dominant channel eigenvectors for
multiple SBs with high-resolution. In matrix form, this corresponds to an $N
\times K$ _channel matrix_ $\mathbf{H}_{N,K}\ $_as shown in_ Figure 1 _,_
where $K$ is number of SBs, and the _k_ -th column of $\mathbf{H}_{N,K}$
corresponds to channel eigenvector for SB _k_.
{width="2.0319444444444446in" height="1.50625in"}
Figure 1 Channel matrix.
The Rel. 15 Type II CSI is based in compressing (columns of)
$\mathbf{H}_{N,K}$ in spatial domain (SD) by performing linear combination
(LC) of $L > 1$ SD basis vectors that comprise columns of matrix
$\mathbf{W}_{1}$. In particular, an eigenvector **_e_** of the channel is
expressed as a LC of _L_ Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) vectors: $\mathbf{e}
\approx \sum_{i = 0}^{L - 1}{c_{i}\mathbf{b}_{i}}$. This is illustrated in
Figure 2. The PMI codebook is used to report the following components:
  * $W_{1}$: DFT vectors $\left{ \mathbf{b}_{i} \right}_{i = 0}^{L - 1}$ reported common for all SBs (WB reporting); and
  * $W_{2}$: amplitude and phase of coefficients $\left{ c_{i} \right}_{i = 0}^{L - 1}$ reported independently for each SB (SB reporting).
{width="3.102777777777778in" height="1.8972222222222221in"}
Figure 2 Linear combination based Rel. 15 Type II CSI feedback.
Although Rel. 15 Type II CSI can offer large performance gain, the overhead
(number of bits) to report Type II CSI is $O(L \times K \times Rank)$ which
can be excessively large (cf. Table 1).
Table 1 Rel. 15 Type II CSI reporting payload (bits) for 10 SBs
_L_ W1 (bits) W2 (bits) Total (bits)
* * *
        Rank 1      Rank 2      Rank 1         Rank 2   Rank 1   Rank 2
2 22 33 12 24 142 273 4 39 63 24 48 279 543
The Rel.15 Type II CSI compresses (columns of) $\mathbf{H}_{N,K}$ in SD by
performing LC using SD basis matrix $\mathbf{W}_{1}$, and there is no
compression across rows of $\mathbf{H}_{N,K}$ in frequency domain (FD). The LC
coefficients that combine columns of $\mathbf{W}_{1}$ _matrix_ is given by
columns of matrix $\mathbf{W}_{2} = pseudo_ inv\left( \mathbf{W}_{1}
\right)\mathbf{H}_{N,K} = \mathbf{W}_{1}^{H}\mathbf{H}_{N,K}$_. It is well-
known that each row of_ $\mathbf{W}_{2}$ _matrix (that corresponds to_ $K$ _FD
components such as frequency SBs) comprises LC coefficients that are
correlated. This correlation in FD can be exploited to reduce Type II CSI
payload without significant impact on throughput performance._
_In the Rel.16 enhanced Type II CSI,_ $\mathbf{H}_{N,K}$_is compressed in both
SD and FD_ by performing LC using _L_ SD DFT basis vectors, i.e. columns of
$\mathbf{W}_{1}$ _for SD compression, and M_ FD DFT basis vectors, i.e.
columns of $\mathbf{W}_{f} = \left\lbrack \mathbf{f}_{0}\ldots\mathbf{f}_{M -
1} \right\rbrack$_for FD compression._ This is illustrated in Figure 3,
wherein the SD compression is performed using $\mathbf{W}_{1}$, and the
resultant $\mathbf{W}_{2}$ matrix is compressed in FD domain using
$\mathbf{W}_{f}$. The $2L \times M$ coefficient matrix after SD/FD compression
is ${\widetilde{\mathbf{W}}}_{2}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{W}_{2}\mathbf{W}_{f}$.
{width="5.528599081364829in" height="2.7363418635170604in"}
Figure 3 Frequency compression of $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{N,K}}$.
The PMI codebook parameterized by $\left( L,M,K_{0} \right)$ is used to report
the following components:
  * $\mathbf{W}_{1}$: SD DFT vectors $\left{ \mathbf{b}_{i} \right}_{i = 0}^{L - 1}$ reported common for all SBs (WB reporting);
  * $\mathbf{W}_{f}$: FD DFT vectors $\left{ \mathbf{f}_{m} \right}_{m = 0}^{M - 1}$ reported independently for each SBs (SB reporting), where $M = \left\lceil p \times K \right\rceil$; and
  * ${\widetilde{\mathbf{W}}}_{2}$: comprises following components
    * Non-zero subset selection: $K_{0}$ out of $2LM$ non-zero (NZ) coefficients of ${\widetilde{\mathbf{W}}}_{2}$ are selected, and remaining $2LM - K_{0}$ coefficients are set to 0, where $K_{0} = \left\lceil \beta \times 2LM \right\rceil$
      * Restriction: to ensure that the overhead is not too large, the following restriction is applied $K^{\text{NZ}} \leq 2K_{0}$ and $K^{NZ,l} \leq K_{0}$ where $K^{NZ,l}$ is a number of NZ coefficients for layer $l$ and $K^{\text{NZ}}$ is a total number of NZ coefficients across all layers
    * Strongest coefficient: 1 out of $K_{0}$ NZ coefficients is selected and is set to 1
    * Quantization: amplitude and phase of remaining $K_{0} - 1$ NZ coefficients $\left{ c_{i,m} \right}$ is reported.
The following add-on features are also supported:
  * Amplitude restriction: for each SD index $i$, the average power of the NZ coefficients $c_{i,m}$ is restricted to be within a threshold
  * $R$: for improved performance, the number of precoding matrices reported in each SB can be up to $R$ where $R \in { 1,2}$; hence, the total number of precoding matrices can be up to $N_{3} = R \times K$
  * Two-step FD basis selection: to reduce overhead of FD basis selection, when $N_{3} > 19$, the FD DFT vectors $\left{ \mathbf{f}_{m} \right}_{m = 0}^{M - 1}$ are selected from an intermediate basis set as shown in Figure 4, where the intermediate basis set comprises a window of $N_{3}^{'}$ FD bases and is reported common for all layers.

The support of the following features is subject to separate UE capability
signalling: rank > 2, R=2, L=6, and amplitude restriction.
#### 19.1.18.2 Multi-TRP
Enhancements of Multi-TRP/panel transmission intends to improve DL data
rate/spectral efficiency and transmission reliability with both ideal and non-
ideal backhaul by fully utilizing multi-TRP/panel simultaneously since Rel.15
specification mainly focus on single TRP based transmission/reception, from
the UE perspective.
{width="2.5729166666666665in"

height="1.2604166666666667in"}
Figure 5 Two-TRP (DL) transmission/reception
To improve DL date rate, both single-DCI and multi-DCI based non-coherent
joint transmission (NCJT) are supported.
  * For multi-DCI-based NCJT transmission, up to 4 transmission layers per PDSCH, a UE may expect to receive two PDCCHs scheduling two fully/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs respectively in time and frequency domain with same/different PDSCH scrambling ID(s). When the UE is scheduled with fully or partially overlapping PDSCHs, the UE is not expected to assume DM-RS ports in a CDM group indicated by two TCI states. Some configurations related to two received PDSCHs, e.g. active BWP, etc are expected to be same from UE perspective. The UE can be expected to rate match around configured CRS patterns which are associated with the value of CORESETPoolIndex, i.e. per TRP basis, and applied to the corresponding PDSCH.
> For PDCCH monitoring, two TRPs are implicitly associated with two CORESET
> groups, i.e. up to 3 CORESETs per TRP, respectively each of which can be
> identified by the value of CORESETPoolIndex. The maximum number of BD/CCE in
> a serving cell can be doubled for two TRPs but the maximum number of BD/CCE
> per TRP remains to be same as Rel.15.
>
> Scheduling timeline can be relaxed to support out-of-ordered PDCCH to PDSCH,
> PDSCH to HARQ-ACK, and PDCCH to PUSCH depending on UE capability considering
> different backhaul conditions between two TRPs.
>
> Both intra-slot separated HARQ-ACK (per TRP basis) and joint HARQ-ACK
> feedback (across two TRPs) are supported and specified for type-1 and type-2
> HARQ-ACK codebook in order to facilitate different backhaul conditions.
>
> Last but not least, the maximum number of active TCI states in a serving
> cell can be doubled by independent activation from two TRPs but the maximum
> number of active TCI states per TRP remains the same as Rel.15.
  * For single-DCI-based NCJT transmission, up to 8 transmission layers, each TCI code point can correspond to one or two TCI states (so as to 2-port PTRS if applicable) activated by MAC-CE. When 2 TCI states are indicated by DCI, the first TCI state corresponds to the CDM group of the first antenna port indicated by the antenna port indication table (e.g. the first TRP), and the second TCI state corresponds to the other CDM group (e.g. the second TRP). Additional new DMRS entry {0,2,3} with two CDM groups without data is supported to improve the flexibility of NCJT scheduling.
{width="4.820138888888889in" height="1.1909722222222223in"}
Figure 6 Single-DCI-based NCJT
To improve DL transmission reliability with multi-TRP/panel, following
transmission schemes are supported with single DCI and configured by higher
layer signalling:
  * \'FDMSchemeA\': When two TCI states, i.e. two TRPs, are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to \'FDMSchemeA\', the UE shall receive single PDSCH transmission occasion of the TB with each TCI state associated to a non-overlapping frequency domain resource allocation in a manner of comb-like PRGs allocation (or half/half for wideband).
  * \'FDMSchemeB\': When two TCI states, i.e. two TRPs, are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to \'FDMSchemeB\', the UE shall receive two PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with each TCI state associated to non-overlapping frequency domain resource allocation in a manner of comb-like PRGs allocation (or half/half for wideband).
  * \'TDMSchemeA\' (Intra-slot): When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to \'TDMSchemeA\', the UE shall receive two PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with each TCI state associated to a PDSCH transmission occasion which has non-overlapping time domain resource allocation with respect to the other PDSCH transmission occasion. Both PDSCH transmission (corresponding to two TRPs respectively) occasions with mapping Type B only shall be received within a given slot with a symbol-level gap configured by StartingSymbolOffsetK.
  * "repetitionNumber-r16" (Inter-slot): When a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionNumber-r16 in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation-r16, the UE may expect to be indicated with one or two TCI states in a codepoint of the TCI field. When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI, the UE may expect to receive multiple slot level PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with two TCI states associated to repetitionNumber-r16 consecutive slots (up to 16). Each PDSCH transmission occasion is expected to have the same SLIV. The UE may be configured with either cyclicMapping or sequentialMapping for given TCI state mapping pattern.
Each PDSCH transmission occasion is limited to up to two transmission layers
for above transmission schemes targeting at reliability improvement and
indicated DMRS port(s) are expected to within one CDM group. The redundancy
version for PDSCH transmission occasions associated with the second TCI state
is shifted with respect to the value of $\text{rv}_{s}\ $by
sequenceOffsetforRV-r16 if applicable.
Additionally, default beam assumptions for FR2 are specified for receiving
PDSCH, CSI-RS and PDCCH/PDSCH overlapping in case of single-DCI and multi-DCI
based multi-TRP/panel transmission.
#### 19.1.18.3 Multi-beam operation
For the purpose of BM signaling overhead/latency reduction, the following
features were introduced:
  * Default spatial relation/pathloss reference RS
    * Default spatial relation/pathloss reference RS for dedicated PUCCH
    * Default spatial relation/pathloss reference RS for PUSCH
    * Default spatial relation/pathloss reference RS for SRS
  * Simultaneous TCI/spatial relation update across multiple CCs
    * Simultaneous TCI state ID activation for CORESET
    * Simultaneous TCI state ID(s) activation for PDSCH
    * Simultaneous spatial relation activation for aperiodic/semi-persistent SRS
  * PUCCH spatial relation activation/deactivation per PUCCH resource group
  * MAC CE based spatial relation indication for aperiodic/semi-persistent SRS
  * MAC CE based pathloss reference RS update for aperiodic/semi-persistent SRS and PUSCH
First, the feature of default spatial relation/pathloss reference RS was
introduced to reduce/omit UL specific beam/pathloss reference RS indication
signaling, mainly targeting single beam UE that meets DL/UL beam
correspondence requirement. In this mode of operation, spatial relation RS,
i.e. UL beam RS, and pathloss reference RS does not need to be signalled to
UE, and UE shall use a specific DL beam RS, e.g. the DL beam RS for the lowest
ID CORESET, as for the spatial relation RS and the pathloss reference RS.
Above operation can be enabled for dedicated PUCCH, SRS, and/or PUSCH
scheduled by DCI format 0_0 by respective RRC enablers.
Second, simultaneous update of DL/UL beam RS across multiple CCs was
introduced. Up to two CC lists can be configured by RRC for DL and UL,
respectively. Once a DL beam RS ID is activated for a CORESET in a CC by MAC
CE, the RS(s) with the same RS ID are activated in other CC(s) in the same CC
list. Once one or more DL beam RS ID(s) are activated for PDSCH in a CC by MAC
CE, the RS(s) with the same RS ID(s) are activated in other CC(s) in the same
CC list. Once a spatial relation RS is activated for an aperiodic or semi-
persistent SRS resource in a CC by MAC CE, the same RS is activated as spatial
relation RS for the SRS resource(s) with the same resource ID in other CC(s)
in the same CC list.
Third, in Rel.15, PUCCH spatial relation can be activated/deactivated per
resource level, meaning that 128 MAC CEs may need to be signalled to UE for
updating spatial relation for all PUCCH resources in the worst case. Based on
above motivation, resource grouping based PUCCH spatial relation
activation/deactivation was introduced. Up to four PUCCH resource groups can
be configured by RRC per BWP, and one MAC CE can activate/deactivate a common
spatial relation RS for all the PUCCH resources in the same group.
Fourth, in Rel.15, spatial relation for aperiodic SRS is configured by RRC
only, which may lead to unnecessary RRC overhead for configuring a sufficient
number of SRS resources or large latency for RRC reconfiguration. Based on
above motivation, MAC CE based spatial relation indication for aperiodic/semi-
persistent SRS was introduced. One MAC CE can update spatial relation(s) of
one SRS resource set, where different spatial relation can be indicated per
resource within the resource set.
Fifth, in Rel.15, pathloss reference RSs for UL power control for PUSCH and
SRS can only be configured by RRC. Since up to four pathloss RSs can be
configured in Rel.15, it could often require RRC reconfiguration according to
UE mobility and considering gNB/UE beamforming. Based on above motivation, MAC
CE based pathloss reference RS update for aperiodic/semi-persistent SRS and
PUSCH was introduced. For this operation, the maximum configurable number of
pathloss reference RSs by RRC was increased to 64, and the new MAC CE can
activate up to four pathloss reference RSs among them. Two MAC CEs were
introduced for SRS and PUSCH, respectively.
To facilitate interference-aware beam selection, L1-SINR-based beam
measurement and reporting were introduced. The gNB can configure UE to measure
and report L1-SINR based on SSB/CSI-RS. The following resource settings for
L1-SINR measurement have been supported:
  * L1-SINR measurement based on CSI-RS configured for beam management (BM) as channel measurement resource (CMR) and interference measurement resource (IMR)
  * L1-SINR measurement based on SSB as CMR and CSI-IM
  * L1-SINR measurement based on CSI-RS configured for BM as CMR and CSI-IM
  * L1-SINR measurement based on SSB as CMR and non-zero-power (NZP) interference measurement resource (IMR)
  * L1-SINR measurement based on CSI-RS configured for BM as CMR and NZP-IMR
In addition, to improve performance and reliability for SCell, BFR for SCell
was introduced. The procedure for SCell BFR is illustrated in Figure 7 below.
  * The beam failure detection (BFD) is based on periodic 1-port CSI-RS for BM, and the procedure is the same as spCell BFD.
  * The candidate beam detection (CBD) is based on SSB and CSI-RS for BM, and the procedure is similar to spCell BFD, where cross-CC CBD is supported.
  * The BFRQ report can include two steps
    * Step 1: UE sends a SR over PUCCH for BFR (which is dedicatedly configured) to indicate beam failure and request resource for BFR MAC CE report
      * If the SR is not configured, contention based PRACH can be used
      * gNB's response is the same as normal SR procedure
    * Step 2: UE sends a BFR MAC CE to gNB, which conveys the following information
      * Failed CC index
      * Whether a new beam is identified or not
      * RS resource ID representing identified new beam
  * After receiving the BFR MAC CE, gNB can send a PDCCH to schedule a new transmission for the same HARQ process used to transmit BFR MAC CE
    * After 28 symbols after UE receives the response, UE can apply the newly identified beam to all CORESETs and PUCCH resources in the CC reported by BFR MAC CE

#### 19.1.18.4 Low PAPR RS
It was identified that Rel.15 DM-RS for the PDSCH/PUSCH using non-transform
precoded (CP-) OFDM waveform has a high PAPR issue, for transmissions of
rank-2 and above. The issue occurs when DM-RS ports from different DM-RS CDM
groups are linearly combined through the same power amplifier. The root cause
of the issue was identified to be the use of the same DMRS sequence for all
DMRS ports. In addition, for transform precoded OFDM, it was identified that
when pi/2-BPSK modulation is used, then the PAPR of the PUSCH or PUCCH is
lower than for the associated DM-RS which is a problem as different OFDM
symbols will have different PAPR.
In Rel.16, the above issues were resolved as follows:
  * For CP-OFDM PDSCH and PUSCH by letting the DM-RS sequence, $r\left( m \right)$, depend on the antenna port association to the CDM group index Î». This ensured that antenna ports in different CDM groups have different DM-RS sequences and this effectively removes the PAPR issue.
  * For transform precoded PUSCH or PUCCH format 3 and 4, in all cases with pi/2-BPSK modulation, the Rel-16 low PAPR DM-RS sequences are introduced by applying a DFT-spread before being mapped to the time-frequency resource grid. In this case, pseudo-random (PRBS) or computer generated based pi/2-BPSK or 8-PSK sequences are used instead of the Rel.15 direct use of (i.e. non-DFT precoded) Zadoff-Chu sequences (see Figure 8). This means that Rel.16 DMRS will have similar sequence characteristics as the associated pi/2-BPSK modulated data/control and by then have similar PAPR, which resolves the high PAPR issue.

Figure 8 pi/2-BPSK/8-PSK low PAPR DM-RS formation
  * Four related UE capabilities were introduced:
    * **FG 16-4 Low PAPR DMRS for PDSCH**
    * FG 16-6a **Low PAPR DMRS for PUSCH without transform precoding**
    * FG 16-6b **Low PAPR DMRS for PUCCH format 3 and 4** with transform precoding and with pi/2 BPSK
    * FG 16-6c Low PAPR DMRS for PUSCH with transform precoding and with pi/2 BPSK
[2.5 Uplink (UL) full-power transmission]{.underline}
Three modes of operation are specified in Rel.16 as optional UE capabilities:
fullpower, fullpowerMode1, fullpowerMode2. The UE can report one of the
supported modes.
  * fullpower: This mode targets the UEs with full-rated PAs. Using a 2-Tx PC3 non-coherent UE as an example, the UE is equipped with two 23dBm PAs. As shown in Figure 9, the UE transmits UL PUSCH using 1 antenna when the indicated TPMI is {1 0} with Rel.16 power scaling factor s=1. This implies that the transmit power is equally split among non-zero PUSCH antenna(s) thereby enabling the UE to deliver maximum output power.
{width="2.934407261592301in" height="1.8307688101487314in"}
Figure 9 'fullpower' operation
  * fullpowerMode1: A new TPMI subset is added. For a UE supporting non-coherent capability, a non-antenna selection TPMI is added with the same power scaling as in Rel.15. Figure 10 shows an example of a 2-Tx PC3 UE where each PA cannot deliver maximum output power. A new codebook subset for rank=1 includes {1 0}, {0 1}, {1 1}. With precoder {1 1}, the PC3 UE can transmit with total maximum output power of 23dBm on PUSCH. However, similar to Rel.15, precoders {1 0} and {0 1} do not deliver maximum output power.
{width="3.207692475940507in" height="1.924475065616798in"}
Figure 10 'fullpowerMode1' operation
  * fullpowerMode2: To deliver maximum output power through TPMI reporting and antenna virtualization:
    * With multiple SRS resources configured in a set with different number of SRS ports (up to 4 SRS resources can be configured in a set): Using a 2 Tx non-coherent UE as an example, the gNB configures 2 SRS resources in a set where one SRS resource is configured with 1 port and another SRS resource is configured with 2 ports. The gNB indicates SRI corresponding to 1-port SRS while scheduling single layer transmission, and SRI corresponding to 2-port SRS while scheduling two-layer transmission.
    * 2) UE indicating full power TPMI/TPMI groups: Using as an example a 2-Tx non-coherent PC3 UE with PA architecture shown in Figure 11 where one PA is 23dBm and another 20dBm. The UE indicates TPMI=0 (i.e. precoder {1 0}) as full-power TPMI. When the gNB indicates full-power TPMI while scheduling PUSCH, the UE assumes power scaling factor s=1; when the gNB indicates non-full-power TPMI while scheduling PUSCH, the UE assumes Rel.15 power scaling mechanism. For 2Tx UE, UE can report 2 bits, bit-map on {TPMI=0, TPMI=1}. For a 4-Tx UE, to support non-coherent and partial-coherent implementations, seven TPMI groups {G0, G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6} are specified. A 4-Tx non-coherent UE can report capability to indicate 2-port TMPIs using 2-bit bitmap and one of 4-port non-coherent TPMI groups from G0\~G3. A 4-Tx partial coherent UE can report capability to indicate 2-port TMPIs using 2-bit bitmap, one of 4-port non-coherent TPMI groups from G0\~G3, and one of 4-port partial-coherent TPMI groups from G0\~G6.. The TPMI groups G0\~G6 are defined in TS 38.306.

## 19.2 Release 16 Features impacting both LTE and NR
### 19.2.1 Transfer of Iuant interface specifications from 25-series to
37-series
* * *
**820071** **Transfer of Iuant interface specifications from 25-series to
37-series** **Iuant_transfer** **R3** **RP-190160** **Huawei**
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in RP-190144.
This feature transfers the contents of TSs 25.46x into TSs 37.46x (x=0, 1, 2,
6) for releases 8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15, considering the fact theses
specifications apply to different RAT i.e. UTRA, E-UTRA and NR.
Indeed, 25 series of specifications are dedicated to UMTS only, when the
material which was previous there referred to multiple RATs, i.e. UTRA, E-UTRA
and NR.
Rel-6/7: UMTS only (no changes needed, also no changes possible as these
releases are no longer maintained)
Rel-8/9/10/11/12/13/14: UMTS and E-UTRA/LTE
Rel-15: UMTS, E-UTRA/LTE and NR
Note: The TSs 25.4.6x are turned into empty specifications referring to the
new created TSs 37.46x.
The TSs 25.46x are not withdrawn so references to these specs will lead to the
correct specs.
Additional remarks:
1\. This transfer of data over 8 releases is an exceptional case: Instead of
creating Rel-8 specs and step-by-step upgrade to higher releases via CRs
(which would be the normal approach), it was decided with the specs manager to
bring v1.N.0 of TS 37.46x for 1-step approval to RAN #83 and instead of
approving them to vN.0.0 it was decided to approve them the same version as
the last 25.46x version that is created via the CRs.
2\. The text shown in TS 37.46x is taken 1:1 from the corresponding TS 25.46x
showing changes of the contents via revision marks (note: spec cover and
history adaptations are done without revision marks). The changes are mainly
to indicate the considered RATs in the scope, to replace 25.46x references by
37.46x references and to correct obvious problems. Further technical changes
of the contents of the specifications may rather be considered in a future
cat.F CR (and probably just focusing on the latest releases).
3\. There is also a TS 25.463 which exists for Rel-6 and Rel-7 only. TS 25.466
replaced TS 25.463 in Rel-7 and future releases. This means for Rel-6 TS
25.463 is still valid and cannot be withdrawn. Rel-7 is no longer maintained
i.e. no CRs are possible i.e. 3GPP internal references to TS 25.463 could not
be corrected anymore, so also 25.463 Rel-7 will not be withdrawn but it will
be clarified on the 3GPP webpage that for Rel-7 TS 25.466 should be considered
instead of TS 25.463.
4\. References of Rel-16 and higher should refer to TS 37.46x instead of TS
25.46x. Changes of existing references of Rel-8 to Rel-15 specifications of TS
25.46x may be corrected to references to TS 37.46x but such a change is not
mandatory as 25.46x Rel-8 to Rel-15 will remain. A further upgrade of 25.46x
Iuant specs to Rel-16 and higher will not be considered. Rel-16 and higher
specifications shall refer to TS 37.46x.
Following this transfer, RAN3 agreed to transfer the ownership of the clauses
currently owned by RAN4 in TS 37.461 back to RAN3. RAN3 informed RAN4 by LS
(R3-191145).

Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-191816.
The WI added support for MSR BS including GSM, UTRA, E-UTRA and NR
combinations by means of creating two new CS, CS 18 (GSM+E-UTRA+NR) and CS19
(UTRA+E-UTRA+NR).
The WI created two new capability sets, CS 18 (GSM+E-UTRA+NR) and CS19
(UTRA+E-UTRA+NR). A BS with multiple connectors can support all 4 RATs by
transmitting CS18 on at least one connector and CS19 on at least one
connector. To add these CS, the following was needed:
  * Updating of the MSR core specification to include correct OBUE emissions tables for GSM/UTRA when operating together with MSR as well as some fixes to the blocking and RX IM requirements.
  * Introduction in the conformance specification of:
    * The new capability sets
    * Test configurations relating to the new capability sets
    * Test applicability rules relating to the new capability sets and test configurations
    * Updated test requirements corresponding to the core requirement updates.
All of the new functionality was introduced in the two approved CRs in [1] and
[2].

### 19.2.3 Direct data forwarding between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN nodes for inter-
system mobility

inter-system mobility** **Direct_data_fw_NR** **R3** **RP-182886**
**Ericsson**

Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-192162.
This WI specified direct data forwarding per bearer during inter-system
mobility between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN nodes in addition to the solution for
indirect data forwarding specified in Rel-15 during the NR WI.
This WI continued discussions on direct data forwarding between NG-RAN and
E-UTRAN nodes during the Rel-15 discussions on the NR WI. Direct data
forwarding encompasses the following two main features:
\- While data forwarding between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN nodes in Rel-15 foresees
establishing the data forwarding path via the EPC and the 5GC, direct data
forwarding allows establishing the data forwarding path directly between the
involved RAN nodes, without the need to interact with user plane functions of
the EPC and the 5GC.
\- Indirect data forwarding for inter-system handover in Rel-15 foresees
transporting to be forwarded user plane data between the NG-RAN node and the
UPF via PDU Session tunnels. As forwarding paths on the E-UTRAN side are
established on a per-E-RAB basis, the Rel-15 solution requires interworking
functions at the UPF and the NG-RAN node in order to map per-DRB / per-E-RAB
packets to the per-PDU Session tunnel and vice versa. Such interworking is not
necessary in case of direct data forwarding.
In the course of the WI RAN3 realised that direct data forwarding tunnel
related information may be communicated between the NG-RAN node and the 5GC in
a way that the inter-system handover signalling performance benefits from such
approach, which was realised in the agreed CRs in [3] and [4].
Further, SA2 and CT4 where contacted to perform necessary work in their areas
of responsibility [5].

LTE_NR_arch_evo R3 RP-180531 China Unicom
Summary based on the input provided by China Unicom in RP-192964.
In Rel-15, the F1 interface was standardized in the gNB (LTE) to support gNB-
CU and gNB-DU split, i.e. to split the Control Unit from the Data Unit
(supporting the user data).
Similarly, in Rel-16, the W1 interface is standardized in the ng-eNB (5G) to
support ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU split.
These two interfaces adopt the same higher layer split architecture for
between PDCP and RLC, with similar functionalities, such as control plan
functionalities.
The ng-eNB-CU and gNB-CU could be physically collocated, deployed in a same
physical \"box\". This unification of the , as to unify the ng-eNB and gNB
architectures would simplify the network deployment complexity and facilitate
hardware upgrades.
The W1 interface specifications includes the general aspects and principles
(TS 37.470), W1 layer 1 (TS 37.471), signalling transport (TS 37.472) and W1AP
aspects (TS 37.473). The general aspects and principles and W1 layer1 are
aligned with F1 interface. For signalling transport, the W1-C signalling
bearer aligned with F1 interface, function and protocol stack in figure 1 are
defined.
Figure 1: W1-C signalling bearer protocol stack
The functionalities of W1 interface are supported over W1-C and W1-U (in a
similar way as for the F1 interface).
T**he W1-C functionalities are the following** :
  1. **Interface management** : W1 setup, eNB-CU/eNB-DU configuration update, error indication function, reset function coordination function.
  2. **system information management** : system information is critical for high layer split architecture, eNB-DU is responsible for transmitting MIB, SIB1, SIB2, SIB3, SIB8 and SIB 16. Other system information is responsible by ng-eNB-DU.
  3. **Paging function** : The eNB-DU is responsible for transmitting the paging information. While, the eNB-CU provides paging information to enable the eNB-DU to calculate the exact PO and PF.
  4. **UE context management function** : The W1 UE context management function supports the establishment and modification of the necessary overall UE context.
  5. **RRC message transfer function:** RRC message transfer function supports the establishment and modification of the necessary overall UE context. This function allows to transfer RRC messages between eNB-CU and eNB-DU.
  6. **Warning message information transfer function** : This function allows to cooperate with the warning message transmission procedures over NG interface.
The W1-U functionalities are specified as below:
  1. **Transfer of user data** : The functionalities are used to transfer of user data between ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU.
  2. **flow control function:** It is designed for control the downlink user data flow to the ng-eNB-DU.
More detail procedures and IEs for W1 can be founded in TS 37.473 on W1AP
specification.

Summary based on the input provided by CMCC in RP-200214.
This WI contains a general part and band specific combination part for high
power UE (power class 2) for EN-DC (1 LTE TDD band + 1 NR TDD band). The
purpose is to introduce high power UE (power class2) for EN-DC (1 LTE TDD band
+1 NR TDD band). The actual requirements are added to the corresponding
technical specifications.
The purpose of this WI on High power UE (power class 2) for EN-DC (1 LTE TDD
band + 1 NR TDD band) is to improve the UP coverage of 5G UE. In order to
reduce the big imbalance between 5G NR uplink and downlink coverage, we can
improve uplink coverage by defining high power UE for SA and NSA, and it is a
feasible way to improve the uplink coverage. This PC2 EN-DC (TDD+TDD) feature
will meet the operator\'s deployment request for uplink coverage enhancement.
In this work item, we focus on the PC2 EN-DC RF requirements including UE
maximum output power, Tx power tolerance, MPR, A-MPR, configured output power,
ACLR, SAR and n41-B40 UE-UE co-existence for Power Class 2 EN-DC.
There are two important issues that have been addressed in this topic, and in
the end we have resolved them through appropriate solutions
For SAR issue, RAN4 specified UE Tx duty cycle requirements sufficient to
prevent exceeding local regulatory limits such as SAR for inter-band PC2 EN-DC
UE.
For PC2 EN-DC (TDD+TDD) release independent issue, RAN4 reached a conclusion
that PC2 inter-band EN-DC (LTE TDD PC3 + NR TDD PC3) can be supported from
Rel-15 in release independence manner.
This WI was completed in the RAN#86 meeting and the complete version of NR
Technical Report 37.825 has been approved.

RP-190452 Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-202039.
The LTE and NR Work Item [1] introduces enhancements to Multi-RAT Dual
Connectivity (MR-DC) and Carrier Aggregation (CA) operation, mainly focusing
on reducing setup delays and improving robustness and deployment flexibility.
This is addressed by introducing idle/inactive measurements for DC/CA,
allowing SCG/SCell configuration during transition from idle/inactive state,
introducing dormant SCell in NR, introducing fast recovery from MCG link
failure, introducing support for asynchronous NR-DC operation and cross
carrier scheduling with different numerologies. Changes triggered by the work
item are captured into TS 36-, 37- and 38-series specifications.
The key functionalities introduced in this work item include the following:
â€¢ Support for asynchronous NR-DC: Allowing non-co-located deployments by
relaxing synchronization requirements for gNBs involved in NR-DC operation.
Both semi-static and dynamic uplink power control is supported for deployments
with bands of the same frequency range in MCG and SCG.
â€¢ Idle/inactive measurement reporting: Allowing the eNB to assign UE to do
measurements during IDLE or INACTIVE that the network can use for when the UE
enters CONNECTED mode.
> o This may include limitations on which cells are measured, how long the
> measurements are done and in which cells the measurements are applicable.
>
> o UE can indicate the availability of the measurements at connection setup
> or resume, and network can decide whether to query them via RRC reporting.
â€¢ Direct SCG/SCell configuration: Allowing the network to configure the UE to
store the SCG/SCell configuration upon transition to INACTIVE state, so that
it can be quickly restored upon transition back to CONNECTED, thus minimizing
signaling overhead and latency.
â€¢ NR SCell Dormancy: SCell dormancy is introduced for NR. The UE does not
monitor PDCCH on the dormant BWP for an SCell, but continues performing
RRM/CSI measurements, AGC and beam management, if configured.
> o Switching between dormant and normal operation is network controlled and
> reuses the existing Bandwidth Part (BWP) framework of NR. One dormant BWP
> can be configured for an SCell. DCI is used to control entering/leaving the
> dormant BWP.
>
> o The SpCell and PUCCH SCell cannot be configured with a dormant BWP.
â€¢ Fast MCG link recovery: Support fast recovery from MCG link failure by
allowing the UE in MR-DC to send an MCG Failure Information message to the MN
via the SCG upon the detection of a radio link failure on the MCG. Based on
measurement information received in MCG Failure Information message the
network can then determine the correct action to restore the MCG connection,
e.g. change of PCell.
> o Fast MCG link recovery requires that both UE and network support the
> feature, and that the UE is configured with either split SRB or SCG SRB.
>
> o The UE initiates the RRC connection re-establishment procedure if it does
> not receive a reconfiguration message from the network within a certain time
> after fast MCG link recovery was initiated.
â€¢ Cross-carrier scheduling with different numerologies: Support for cross
carrier scheduling in carrier aggregation, with different numerology on the
scheduling and scheduled carriers.
â€¢ CA with unaligned frame boundary: Support for NR inter-band carrier
aggregation with slot alignment, but with unaligned frame boundary and partial
SFN alignment.
â€¢ Enhancements to single Tx switched uplink for EN-DC: Various improvements
introduced for using the reference TDD pattern, e.g. support is added for LTE
TDD PCell and for dual-Tx UL. LTE PRACH operation is not restricted by the
reference TDD pattern.
â€¢ Aperiodic CSI-RS triggering with different numerologies: Support for
triggering Aperiodic CSI-RS with different numerology between CSI-RS and
triggering PDCCH is introduced.
â€¢ Minimum requirements for NR-DC: RF requirements for both synchronous and
asynchronous operations.

Summary based on the input provided by Apple Inc. in RP-202581.
Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) is an important feature that allows for sharing
existing spectrum between the LTE and NR carriers, thus enabling smoother
transition from LTE and faster adoption of NR. After the RAN#86 meeting, a new
WI was agreed [1] aiming to analyse and introduce, if needed, changes to
support dynamic spectrum sharing in band 48/n48 frequency range, which is also
known as the CBRS band.
The first version of the WI had the following objectives:
\- Channel raster: Confirm that NR channel raster can be aligned with LTE
centre frequencies [RAN4];
\- UL shift: Specify UL 7.5kHz sub-carrier shift for 15kHz SCS. Investigate
whether the 7.5kHz sub-carrier shift has any impact on the needed guard
between LTE and 30kHz SCS NR. Specify the shift only if there is a clear
benefit [RAN4];
\- Sync raster: Check mechanisms to avoid overlapping transmissions between NR
SSB and LTE CRS. Apply changes to ensure non overlap of NR SSB and LTE CRS if
determined that solutions with existing specifications are insufficient
[RAN4].
Referring to the sync raster discussion, no consensus was reached by the
RAN4#96 meeting on whether e.g. the sync pattern B can be added into band n48
definition to mitigate the negative impact of colliding NR SSB and 4-port LTE
CRS transmission. The majority of companies preferred not to introduce this
change at least to band n48. And even though some companies could accept sync
pattern related modifications if a new band is introduced, there were concerns
on whether adding a new band is a right way forward. It was decided to remove
this aspect from the scope of the WI.
For the UL 7.5kHz shift, it was concluded to introduce this functionality into
band n48 following the CBRS Alliance agreement to add 15kHz SCS as one of the
mandatory deployment options. Following the outcome of similar discussions for
band n38 and n40, the UL shift is enabled only for 15kHz SCS and is not
supported for 30kHz SCS.
As for the DL channel raster alignment, RAN4 conclusion was that it is
possible to shift, if needed, the centre frequency by -/+100kHz to align LTE
and NR sub-carriers when SAS allocates the channel which is not on the common
300kHz raster point. RAN4 also concluded that there is no specification impact
for DL transmission, i.e. it is up to the base station how to ensure emission
requirements when the centre frequency is shifted by -/+100kHz. For the UL
transmission, RAN4 discussed how to ensure UE emission requirements and
concluded that \"for the dynamic spectrum sharing operation in band 48/n48
frequency range, what is supported in NR for both BS and UE can ensure UE
emission requirements through appropriate configuration/scheduling\".

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in RP-200850.
The work item on "LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast" [1] specified
enhancements on top of Rel-14 MBMS [2] to meet the 5G requirements for
broadcast systems [3]. These enhancements, obtained as a result of the study
in [4], are summarized as follows:
\- Introduction of a new numerology for PMCH with 100us cyclic prefix and
2.5kHz subcarrier spacing for support of high mobility scenarios (up to
250km/h).
\- Introduction of a new numerology for PMCH with 300us cyclic prefix and
approximately 0.37kHz subcarrier spacing for support of rooftop reception.
\- Enhancements to PBCH and PDCCH to increase robustness in low SINR
scenarios.
This work item also produced a TR [5] summarizing the overall aspects of LTE-
based 5G terrestrial broadcast.
[Numerology for high speed reception]{.underline}
A new numerology for PMCH with 100us cyclic prefix, 400us OFDM core symbol
duration, and 2.5kHz subcarrier spacing is introduced to support high mobility
scenarios (up to 250km/h). With this numerology, each OFDM symbol uses one
slot (0.5ms), and a transport block is mapped to two OFDM symbols (1ms).
Associated to this new numerology, a single reference signal pattern (MBSFN-
RS) is introduced with a time-stagger length of 2, and a frequency separation
(after de-staggering) of 4 subcarriers, which gives a maximum theoretical
equalization interval of 200us.
[Numerology for rooftop reception]{.underline}
A new numerology for PMCH with 300us cyclic prefix, 2700us OFDM core symbol
duration, and approximately 0.37kHz subcarrier spacing is introduced to
support rooftop reception, especially tailored for deployments with large
inter-site distance (e.g. HPHT-1 as defined in [4], with an inter-site
distance of 125km).
With this new numerology, a new variation of frame structure type 1 is
introduced. This frame structure consists of, every 40ms:
\- One subframe (1ms) with 15kHz SCS, containing synchronization and system
information, also named "cell acquisition subframe" (CAS)
\- 13 slots (3ms each) carrying the PMCH with 0.37kHz SCS. Note that the time-
transmission interval (TTI) for a transport block is extended to 3ms.
This frame structure is depicted in Figure 1
Figure 1: Frame structure type 1 for transmissions using _âˆ†f_ = 0.370 kHz.
Two reference signal patterns are introduced associated with this new
numerology, with a stagger length of 2 and 4 OFDM symbols. Both of them have a
frequency separation (after de-staggering) of 3 subcarriers, which gives a
maximum theoretical equalization interval of 900us.
[Enhancements to cell acquisition subframes]{.underline}
As shown in [4], in some deployment scenarios the CAS will experience
significantly lower SINR than PMCH due to the former being based on 15kHz
subcarrier spacing. Several enhancements are introduced to enhance the
performance of the CAS, and are detailed as follows:
\- Semistatic CFI: A semistatic value for CFI (which determines the number of
symbols to be used for PDCCH in a given subframe) is indicated in MIB. This
allows the UE to skip PCFICH decoding, which can become the bottleneck in low
SINR conditions.
\- Aggregation level 16: Before Rel-16, the maximum aggregation level for
PDCCH was 8. Rel-16 introduces aggregation level 16 (only for MBMS dedicated
cells) to enhance performance in low SINR conditions.
\- PBCH repetition: Similar to the scheme defined for eMTC (but with
additional symbol-level rotation for interference randomization), PBCH is
repeated in CAS.

Summary based on the input provided by China Telecom in RP-200738.
The work item on Even further mobility enhancement in E-UTRAN [1] studies
solutions to meet both the reliability and very low HO interruption time
requirements in the Study Phase, and specifies the chosen solutions, i.e.,
Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS) handover to reduce interruption time during
HO and Conditional Handover (CHO) to improve HO reliability and robustness in
the Work Phase.
The corresponding changes are captured into TS 36-series specifications.
[Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS) handover]{.underline}
DAPS Handover is a handover procedure that maintains the source eNB connection
after reception of RRC message for handover and until releasing the source
cell after successful random access to the target eNB.
\- If DAPS handover is configured, the UE continues the downlink user data
reception from the source eNB until releasing the source cell and continues
the uplink user data transmission to the source eNB until successful random
access procedure to the target eNB.
\- Upon reception of the handover command, the UE:
\- Creates a MAC entity for target cell;
\- Establishes the RLC entity and an associated DTCH logical channel for
target cell for each DRB configured with DAPS;
\- For the DRB(s) configured with DAPS, reconfigures the PDCP entity to
configure DAPS with separate security and ROHC functions for source and target
and associates them with the RLC entities configured for source and target
respectively;
\- Retains rest of the source link configurations until release of the source.
\- When DAPS handover fails, the UE falls back to source cell configuration,
resumes the connection with source cell, and reports the DAPS handover failure
via the source without triggering RRC connection re-establishment if the
source link is still available; Otherwise, RRC re-establishment is performed;
[Conditional Handover (CHO)]{.underline}
A Conditional Handover (CHO) is defined as a handover that is executed by the
UE when one or more handover execution conditions are met.
\- UE maintains connection with source eNB after receiving CHO configuration,
and starts evaluating the CHO execution condition(s) for the CHO candidate
cell(s) and executes the HO command once the execution condition(s) are met
for a CHO candidate cell.
\- To improve the robustness, the network can provide the up to 8 candidate
cell configuration(s) associated with execution condition (s) to UE. If at
least one CHO candidate cell satisfies the corresponding CHO execution
condition, the UE detaches from the source eNB, applies the stored
corresponding configuration for that candidate cell and synchronises to that
candidate cell. UE stops evaluating the execution condition(s) for other
candidate cells once the handover is triggered.
\- The UE accesses to the target eNB and completes the handover procedure by
sending RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message to target eNB. The UE
releases stored CHO configurations after successful completion of RRC handover
procedure.
\- When initial CHO execution attempt fails or HO fails, if network configured
the UE to try CHO after HO/CHO failure and the UE performs cell selection to a
CHO candidate cell, the UE attempts CHO execution to that cell; Otherwise, RRC
re-establishment is performed.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-200885.
MIMO is an effective technique to improve spectral efficiency and increase
overall network capacity. SRS can be utilized to improve DL MIMO performance,
especially for massive MIMO in TDD. In this WI [1], SRS capacity and coverage
are enhanced by introducing more than one SRS symbol in a UL normal subframe
and introducing virtual cell ID for SRS [2].
[More than one symbol for SRS in a UL normal subframe]{.underline}
With the introduction of more than one SRS symbol in a UL normal subframe, the
SRS capacity and coverage can be increased. These additional SRS symbol(s) are
referred to as trigger type 2 SRS.
1 to 13 symbols of the first 13 symbols of a UL normal subframe can be
configured to a UE for aperiodically triggered SRS transmission. Intra-
subframe repetition, frequency hopping and antenna switching of the additional
SRS symbols can be supported. A guard period of one SC-FDMA symbol can be
configured for frequency hopping and antenna switching.
The number of repetitions can be configured from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8,
9, 12, 13}. If a UE has more receive antennas than transmit chains (e.g.
1T2R), the UE can be configured to transmit the additional SRS with antenna
switching. And a UE can additionally be configured with frequency hopping for
the additional SRS. The number of antennas (pairs) to switch is:
\- 2 for 1T2R, or the number of pairs is configured as 2 for 2T4R
\- 3 if the number of pairs is configured as 3 for 2T4R
\- 4 for 1T4R
Both legacy SRS and additional SRS can be configured to the same UE, and
transmission of legacy SRS and additional SRS symbol(s) in the same subframe
for the UE is supported.
For sequence generation, per-symbol group hopping and sequence hopping are
supported.
Independent open loop and close loop power control is supported for additional
SRS, and DCI formats 3/3A/3B are used for close loop power control.
UEs not configured with SPUCCH/SPUSCH are not expected to be triggered with
additional SRS in the same subframe as PUSCH/PUCCH in the same serving cell.
UEs configured with SPUCCH/SPUSCH drop the SRS transmission in the symbols
colliding with SPUCCH/SPUSCH in the same serving cell.
The additional SRS transmission in the symbols colliding with PUSCH/PUCCH of
another serving cell in the same TAG, the same band and with the same CP, is
dropped.
The additional SRS transmission in the symbols colliding with PUSCH/PUCCH of
another serving cell in the different TAG is dropped if the total transmission
power exceeds the PCMAX in any overlapping portion.
[Virtual cell ID]{.underline}
Virtual cell ID within the range from 0 to 503 can be configured for SRS to
increase SRS capacity.
The virtual cell ID can be configured to only additional SRS symbol(s) or both
legacy and additional SRS symbol(s). If virtual cell ID is not configured, the
physical cell ID is used.

770020 **Service Interactivity** SerInter S4 SP-170796 Lo, Charles, Qualcomm
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated in SP-191247.
This summarizes the progress of the normative specifications accomplished
during the course of the SerInter work item [1]. The related agreed CRs can be
found in the Tdocs [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6].
The service interactivity feature enables dynamic user engagement and
resulting auxiliary content presentation during the consumption of a streaming
service or content item, received over unicast or broadcast. Interactive
service capabilities can be further personalized to the end user consuming the
service. Examples of service interactivity functionality include voting,
rating, purchasing, online chats, and reception of targeted advertisements and
other content, in real-time during the viewing of a streaming program.
Technical functionality to enable and support dynamic and personalized service
interactivity are added to TS 26.247 [7], TS 26.346 [8] and TS 26.347 [9] and
comprise the following components:
  * Signaling of upcoming interactivity events to native or Web app based interactivity applications. Such interactivity event signaling, which could be sent at specific and potentially arbitrary times during the consumption of an associated 3GPP User Service, contain metadata of upcoming interactivity events and which enable an interactivity application to perform its intended task. The interactivity event signaling is defined by the DASH Industry Forum upon request from 3GPP, and is implemented as either a DASH Event stream, or as samples of a ISOBMFF timed metadata track.
  * Processing model and rules for the 3GP-DASH Client to extract metadata contained in interactivity event signaling.
  * WebIDL APIs exposed by the 3GP-DASH Client to an interactivity application, for the subscription by and delivery to, the application, of interactivity event metadata.
> (The above functionalities are defined by the DASH Industry Forum, based on
> request from 3GPP to support the Service Interactivity work item, in the
> specification "DASH Player's Application Events and Timed Metadata
> Processing Model and APIs" [10].)
  * For DASH-formatted streaming services, signaling via the DASH MPD of the intended measurement and reporting of interactivity-related usage by the user/device. This signaling enables the service provider to: a) specify the parameters and criteria regarding interactivity consumption reporting; b) specify the type of interactivity usage report to be submitted by the DASH client, and c) employ either random or selective control of the user/device population to perform the reporting. In addition, the XML-based interactivity usage report format and HTTP POST based reporting protocol are defined. The above functionality are specified in TS 26.247 [7].
  * Clarifications to the MBMS APIs specification TS 26.347 [9] that an MBMS-Aware Application providing an auxiliary service interactivity feature is expected to acquire, from the MBMS client, a multiplicity of Application User Services. These Application User Services provide the media content of the DASH-over-MBMS application service as well as media content and/or metadata of adjunct application service(s) that provide the service interactivity functionality.
An architecture illustrating the high level interactions between the relevant
entities, in the delivery of DASH-formatted content and interactivity event
signaling from the network to the 3GP-DASH Client, forwarding of event
signaling data from the 3GP-DASH Client to the interactivity application, and
subsequent execution by the application of its interactivity task, is shown in
the diagram below, which is copied from TR 26.953 [11].

Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson LM in SP-200034.
This summarizes the progress of the new, normative specification accomplished
during the course of the RTCPVer work item [1].
The RTCP verification for real-time services feature enables verification of
the most important parts of the RTP/RTCP and SRTP/SRTCP protocols used by
current 3GPP conversational and real-time services.
Technical functionality to enable and support this verification are added to a
new TS 26.139 [2] and comprise the following aspects:
\- Explicitly allowing for and describing examples of different, possible test
architectures.
\- Test cases needed to ensure an adequate level of RTP operation and RTP
stream monitoring.
\- Test methods capable to verify that information contained in the RTP header
and in RTCP is correct and consistent with the observed characteristics of the
related RTP streams:
o Between RTP/RTCP within the scope of a single RTP stream (e.g. between an
RTP stream and the corresponding RTCP reporting from the remote party, or
between an RTP stream and the corresponding RTCP metadata, e.g. for sampling
clock accuracy compensation between RTP sender and RTP receiver).
o Between RTP/RTCP across RTP streams in the same RTP session (e.g. between
sent and received RTP streams, or between audio RTP streams and video RTP
streams).
\- Requirements on what constitutes acceptable RTP/RTCP protocol field values,
including RTP payload header and RTP payload length, based on the observed
characteristics of the related RTP streams.
\- A method for an RTP/RTCP implementation to announce that it has passed the
necessary tests and conforms to the new specification at call setup and during
the call.

The contents of the WID are exact copies of the ones before as it is an
"ongoing" WID at CT1, meaning that it keeps existing for every new release
until CT1 makes a decision that it is no longer needed. The only thing that
happened this time, i.e. for the Rel-16 version, was that we decided to align
the "x" in SAESx with the corresponding release so, as of Rel-16, the WID is
called SAES16 and it will be SAES17 for Rel-17.

Wiehe, Ulrich, Nokia
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Nokia, Nokia Shanghai Bell in
CP-200143.
The problem of potential signalling floods on Nudm and Nudr service based
interfaces that are caused by (identical) subscription data changes for a huge
set of subscriptions (e.g. MTC devices) is solved by the concept of shared
data.
Subscription data that are retrieved by serving nodes (AMF, SMF, SMSF) from
the UDM (and by the UDM from the UDR) may contain a subset that is shared by a
huge number of subscriptions (e.g. 1000 specific MTC devices). A simple
example for such a subset is e.g. a subscribed periodic registration time with
a value of 300 seconds. When the operator decides to modify the value for all
these MTC devices to e.g. 400 seconds, a single notification per serving node
is sent to update the shared subset; there is no need to send 1000
notifications addressing each single subscription.
The solution is a pure stage 3 signalling optimization issue and is not based
on specific stage1 or stage 2 requirements.
CT4#84 decided to implement the solution already in Rel-15.

Summary based on the input provided by Vodafone in SP-200224.
There are strong interests among 3GPP network operators not only on addressing
various existing and emerging markets and services to increase and diversify
revenue streams, but also on enabling new business models and different
operational schemes to maximise the use of the operators\' networks.
TS 22.261 [1] specifies the requirements that define a 5G system in order to
support new deployment scenarios to address diverse market segments, while the
requirements for 5G E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity in E-UTRAN connected to EPC
(i.e. "option 3") are included in TS 22.278 [2]. This WI allows refinement of
the identified stage 1 requirements in both specifications, including
clarifications and extension due to the stage 2 developments in other WGs.
The clarifications and alignments are made with stage 2/3 progress in other
WGs on the requirements carried forward from Release 15. The main updates
include:
  * For the 5G system service requirements specified in TS 22.261
    * A statement is added to the Scope to clarify that TS 22.261 provides requirements related to a 5G Core, i.e., specifically excluding Option 3.
    * Clarifications are added on the performance requirements for low-latency and high-reliability scenarios.
    * Clarifications are added on unified access control requirements.
    * Support of legacy USIM in 5G is added.
    * Clarifications are added on communication service availability and reliability.

## 20.7 Ambient noise test methodology for evaluation of acoustic UE
performance

**870010** **Ambient noise test methodology for evaluation of acoustic UE
performance** **ANTeM** **S4** **SP-200051** **Jan Reimes, HEAD acoustics
GmbH**
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by China Mobile in SP-200265.
The work item ANTeM [1] was subsequently initiated to the feasibility study
FS_ANTeM [2] in order to follow the conclusion of TR 26.921 [3] regarding
handset speech quality testing under ambient noise conditions. Results of the
round robin test conducted in FS_ANTeM indicated that an alternative noise
field simulation provides test results equivalent to the currently specified
method, while having a more efficient equalization procedure and less variance
across labs at the same time. To include this new method in TS 26.132 [4], a
corresponding change request [5] was agreed.
For speech quality evaluation of UEs under ambient noise conditions, the
technical specification TS 26.132 [4] provides test methodologies. For
measurements in handset mode, the background noise playback system according
to ETSI ES 202 396-1 [6] is used. Within the study item FS_ANTeM, the
applicability of the more recent ambient noise simulation according to ETSI TS
103 224 [7] was investigated, which provides the advantage of a fully
automated calibration routine.
The so-called \"flexible configurations\" of ETSI TS 103 224 [7] were found to
be useful, since they can be used in conjunction with the currently specified
binaural noise types of TS 26.132 [4] to provide backward compatibility with
the currently used simulation according to ETSI ES 202 396-1 [6].
The equivalency of the two noise field simulation systems was also shown by
almost identical measurement results in the round robin test (comprehensive
results of this study are provided in TR 26.921 [3]). The resulting CR [5]
specified the flexible configurations of ETSI TS 103 224 [7] as an additional
and preferred simulation method.

Michel Cornily, Orange**
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Orange in SP-200228.
The term 'Energy Efficiency' (EE) is to be understood as covering two areas:
1\. Definition of EE KPI, required performance measurements and method(s) to
collect them;
2\. Definition of use cases, requirements and solutions to optimize Energy
Efficiency -- this is also sometimes referred to as Energy Saving.
Both aspects have been addressed in SA5 for pre-5G radio access technologies,
focusing on how OA&M can provide support to them. This work item (EE_5G)
addresses NG-RAN.
This Work Item has produced the Rel-16 TS 28.310 \"Management and
orchestration; Energy efficiency of 5G\", as well as CRs 0055 and 0111 to TS
28.552 and CR 0032 to TS 28.554.
TS 28.310 [1] captures use cases, requirements and procedures for collecting
performance measurements (namely data volume measurements and PEE (Power,
Energy and Environment) parameters from 5G base stations. The EE KPI for 5G
base stations is obtained thanks to these measurements. Those measurements are
collected by the OSS thanks to the usage of generic management services
defined in TS 28.532. Data Volume (DV) measurements, at PDCP layer, have been
introduced in TS 28.552 [2], as well as PEE parameters definition (amongst
which the Energy Consumption (EC) of the base station). A new KPI, named EE
KPI, calculated by dividing Data Volume (DV) by Energy Consumption (EC) has
been defined in TS 28.554 [5]. All this is fully aligned with baseline ETSI TC
EE (Environmental Engineering) specifications ES 203 228 [7] and ES 202 336-12
[8].
Some intra- and inter-RAT energy saving use cases and requirements have been
specified in TS 28.310 [1]. The 5G Network Resource Model (TS 28.541 [9]) has
been augmented with an Energy Saving NRM fragment enabling the management of
both centralized and distributed energy saving modes.

### 21.1.6 Trace Management in the context of Services Based Management
Architecture and Streaming Trace reporting

Architecture TB_SBMA S5 SP-181073 Anatoly Andrianov, Nokia
* * *
850027 Streaming Trace reporting OAM_RTT S5 SP-190782 Anatoly Andrianov, Nokia
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-200532.
The combination of the 3GPP Rel-16 Trace features (\"Trace management in the
context of Services Based Management Architecture (SBMA)\" and \"Streaming
Trace reporting\") transformed the legacy, partially outdated trace
functionality into a modern flexible and powerful toolset.
As SA5 no longer mandates the functional management architecture focused on
interactions between IRPManager and IRPAgent over Itf-N, a new way of trace
management was necessary. The concept of \"configurable trace\" has been
introduced where the management trace activation is represented by the act of
Managed Object Instance (MOI) creation. The new TraceJob Information Object
Class (IOC) also known as \"Trace control NRM fragment\" has been specified
for this purpose in the Generic NRM TSs 28.622 [1] and 28.623 [2]. The
creation, deletion and modification of the MOIs based on the new IOC does not
require a dedicated API and is performed by the means of Provisioning
Management Service (Provisioning MnS) specified in TS 28.532 [3]. The
corresponding content (concepts, requirements, definitions) has been added to
the family of trace specifications (TSs 32.421 [4] and 32.422 [5]), while all
the dependencies on the legacy Trace Management IRP and legacy functional
architecture have been eliminated.
TR 28.806 [8] identified and documented use cases for collecting Cell and UE
data for analytics, and for Collecting subscriber and equipment trace data for
near-real-time diagnostics and troubleshooting. It established that enabling
the capabilities for trace data to be delivered to the consumer(s) while it\'s
still relevant to the analytics, diagnostics and troubleshooting tasks
performed by the consumer is important. The normative work on streaming trace
data reporting leveraged the model-driven approach to the trace management and
SBMA framework (TS 28.533 [7]). It added the new use cases and requirements
for streaming trace to TS 32.421 [4], addressed all relevant trace control and
configuration management aspects in TS 32.422 [5] and specified the
serialization format for the streaming trace records in TS 32.423 [6]. The
initial work on a dedicated Streaming Trace data reporting MnS has been
further extended and generalized into support of additional streaming data
types such as Streaming PM, Streaming Analytics and proprietary data. The new
Streaming data reporting MnS has been fully specified in TS 28.532 [3] it
includes a RESTful HTTP based solution set for streaming connection
establishment and connection/stream meta-data exchange and an efficient
protocol stack for high volume/high speed streaming data reporting based on
WebSockets. The use of SBMA framework does not limit the consumers and
producers of the new MnS to 3GPP Management Functions and supports the use
cases where 3GPP Network Element (NE) reports management data (Trace, PM,
Analytics and proprietary) to any authorized MnS consumer.

Only Stage 1 was defined in the Rel-16 time-frame. This is not consistent with
the 3GPP methodology, where all aspects of a given Feature (Stages 1, 2, 3,
charging, security, etc) have to be completed withing the same Release. As a
consequence, the work completed for Stage 1 in Rel-16 will be moved to a
future Release.

###### ### Annex B: Process to get further information
# B.1 General
Since the present document is limited to provide an overview of each Feature,
this chapter explains how to get additional information, in particular how to
retrieve all the Specifications (TSs) and Reports (TRs) as well as all the CRs
which relate to a given Work Item.
The Unique Identifier (UID) is the key to get additional information on a
given Work Item. It can be found in the table located just below the clause\'s
header. The table has the following format:
Table B-1: table format
* * *
Unique Identifier (UID) Name Acronym Outline Level (1=Feature, 2=Building
Block, 3=Work Task) Responsible Working Group Work Item Description
* * *
For readability reasons, the table headers are omitted in the continuation of
the present document.
For instance, for the \"Mission Critical Push to Talk over LTE Realignment\",
the table has to be understood as:
Table B-2: Example of table at the introduction of each Feature
Unique Identifier (UID) Name Acronym Outline Level Responsible Working Group
Work Item Description
* * *
700029 **Mission Critical Push to Talk over LTE Realignment** MCImp-MCPTTR 2
S1 SP-150821
Thus, the UID for this Work Item is 700029.
Two methods are now possible to retrieve more information on a given feature:
the \"Step by step method\" and the \"Direct method\". The \"direct method\"
is faster but implies to know the hierarchical structure of the Work Items.
The \"step by step method\" is slower but is easier to use, in particular when
the hierarchical structure is unknown.
For instance, for retrieving all the CRs that relate to \"Enhancements for
Mission Critical Push To Talk\", the search has to be done on UID 740022 but
also potentially on its children Work Items (UID 720056, 740023 and 740024).
Table B-3: Example of a hierarchical structure and its consequences on the
search procedure
740022 **Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk** MCImp-eMCPTT
SP-160490
* * *
720056 Stage 2 of Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk MCImp-eMCPTT
S6 SP-160490 740023 Stage 3 of Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk
MCImp-eMCPTT-CT CT CP-160824 740024 CT1 aspects of Enhancements for Mission
Critical Push To Talk MCImp-eMCPTT-CT C1 CP-160824
These two methods are described in the following clauses.
# B.2 Direct method
The links below lead to the pages containing respectively all the
Specifications and all the Change Requests (CRs) linked to a given Feature:
https://portal.3gpp.org/Specifications.aspx?q=1&WiUid=[UID]
https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=[UID]
where \"[UID]\" has to be preplaced by the UID value.
Using the example provided in the table 4.1-3, the specification linked to
\"Stage 2 of Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk\" can be found in:
https://portal.3gpp.org/Specifications.aspx?q=1&WiUid=720056
And all the related Change Requests are listed in:
https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=720056
# B.3 Step by step method
This method is to be used when the hierarchical structure is not known or when
the \"direct method\" above does not show the expected results.
In this case, the 3GPP Ultimate web site has to be used:
https://portal.3gpp.org
As a preliminary step, it is essential that the \"Customized Selection\" is
set to \"All TSGs\" (otherwise, a filter would be applied).
{width="4.563888888888889in" height="2.957638888888889in"}
Figure B.3-1: Selecting \"All TSGs\" in \"Customized Selection\" as to remove
any potential filter on the Search
Then select the \"Work Plan\" tab (upper red arrow in the figure below).
{width="5.242361111111111in" height="2.9451388888888888in"}
Figure B.3-2: Using the 3GU Portal to retrieve more information on a given
Feature
Then the search might be performed by either typing the Acronym (as shown by
the left red arrow on the figure above, using the example \"MCPTT\"), or by
the name or UID (right box) then by clicking on the \"Search\" button. Watch
the \"Granularity (Level)\" field, which is a filter to return only the Items
which level is specified here.
In the results, the icon depicting some binoculars has to be hit (lower right
red arrow on the figure above).
This will lead to the page shown in the figure below:
{width="3.6in" height="3.1881944444444446in"}
Figure B.3-3: Window resulting from a \"Search\"
On this window, the \"Related\" tab has to be clicked, as pointed by the red
arrow in the figure above. This will lead to the window depicted in the figure
below.
{width="3.6180555555555554in" height="3.2in"}
Figure B.3-4: \"Related\" tab in a Work Item search, with links to all related
Specifications and Change Requests
The two links pointed by the red arrows in the figure above lead to the pages
containing respectively all the Specifications and all the Change Requests
(CRs) linked to this Feature.
