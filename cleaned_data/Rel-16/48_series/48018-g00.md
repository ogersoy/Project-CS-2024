## 3.1 Vocabulary
> \- **Coverage Class:** See definition in 3GPP TS 43.064 [10].
\- **CS/PS coordination enhancements:** refers to an improved CS/PS domain
registration coordination function when rerouting is performed in a MOCN or in
a GWCN configuration for network sharing. The improved CS/PS domain
registration coordination is achieved by extended signalling between the BSS
and the CN nodes (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [43]).
\- **Dedicated Core Networks:** Dedicated Core Networks is an optional feature
that enables an operator to deploy multiple dedicated core networks within a
PLMN where each dedicated core network node may be dedicated to serve specific
type (s) of subscribers. The selection of the Dedicated Core Network is based
on "UE Usage Type" obtained from the HSS/HLR and operator specific
configuration in the SGSN (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [49]).
\- **EC operation:** See definition in 3GPP TS 43.064 [10].
> \- **Extended DRX (eDRX):** see 3GPP TS 21.905 [1].
\- **MS assisted** **Dedicated Core Network selection:** MS assisted Dedicated
Core Network selection is an optional feature wherein the selection of the
Dedicated Core Network to which a BSS routes LLC PDUs, in addition to the
selected PLMN, is based on the "DCN-ID" value provided by the MS (see 3GPP TS
23.401 [49]).
\- **Network sharing:** network sharing is an optional feature that allows
different core network operators to connect to the same shared radio access
network in a MOCN configuration, and to the same shared radio access network
and core network nodes in a GWCN configuration (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [43]). When
network sharing is in use within a given cell, the network broadcasts within
system information the PLMN identities of the PLMNs sharing the cell. A mobile
station supporting network sharing uses this information for its PLMN
(re)selection processes and indicates the selected PLMN to the BSS.
\- **Null-NRI:** Has the same format as the NRI and is used to identify the
group of SGSNs that belong to a DCN within a PLMN. A \'null-NRI\' indicates to
a radio node (BSC/RNC) that the NAS Node Selection Function shall be used for
selecting a CN node to receive a message (see 3GPP TS 23.236 [21]).
\- **SGSN Group ID:** A SGSN Group ID identifies a Dedicated Core Network
(DCN) within the PLMN, i.e. the group of SGSNs that belong to a DCN within a
PLMN, see 3GPP TS 23.401[49].
# 4 Logical configuration of the Gb-interface
## 4.1 High-level characteristics of the Gb-interface
In contrast to the A-interface, where a single user has the sole use of a
dedicated physical resource throughout the lifetime of a call irrespective of
information flow, the Gb-interface allows many users to be multiplexed over a
common physical resource.
GPRS signalling and user data may be sent on the same physical resources.
Access rates per user may vary from zero data to the maximum possible
bandwidth (e.g. the available bit rate of an E1).
## 4.2 Position of BSSGP within the protocol stack on the Gb-interface
Across the Gb-interface the following peer protocols have been identified: the
Base Station Subsystem GPRS Protocol (BSSGP) and the underlying network
service (NS). The NS shall transport BSSGP PDUs between a BSS and an SGSN
(refer to 3GPP TS 48.016).
{width="2.911111111111111in" height="1.9708333333333334in"}
Figure 4.1: BSSGP\'s position within the Gb-interface protocol stack
NOTE: The Relay function provides buffering and parameter mapping between the
RLC/MAC and the BSSGP.
EXAMPLE: On the uplink the RLC/MAC shall provide a TLLI. The Relay function
shall then make it available to BSSGP. For a definition of the RLC/MAC
function refer to 3GPP TS 43.064.
The primary functions of the BSSGP include:
\- in the downlink, the provision by an SGSN to a BSS of radio related
information used by the RLC/MAC function;
\- in the uplink, the provision by a BSS to an SGSN of radio related
information derived from the RLC/MAC function; and
\- the provision of functionality to enable two physically distinct nodes, an
SGSN and a BSS, to operate node management control functions.
The present document describes the service model, service primitives,
procedures and PDU formats of the BSSGP.
# 5 Elements for layer-to-layer communication
## 5.1 Definition of service model
In the present document, the communication between adjacent layers and the
services provided by the layers are distributed by use of abstract service
primitives. Only externally observable behaviour resulting from the
description is normatively prescribed by the present document.
The service primitive model used in the present document is based on the
concepts developed in ITU-T Recommendation X.200.
The service model for a BSS and an SGSN is asymmetric. The service models for
a BSS and an SGSN are shown in figure 5.1.
Figure 5.1: BSSGP service model
Primitives consist of commands and their respective responses associated with
the services requested of another layer. The general syntax of a primitive is:
\- XX - Generic name - Type (Parameters);
where XX designates the layer providing or using the service.
In the present document, XX is:
\- \"BSSGP\" for functions controlling the transfer of LLC frames passed
between an SGSN and an MS across the Gb interface;
\- \"RL\" (relay) for functions controlling the transfer of LLC frames between
the RLC/MAC function and BSSGP;
\- \"GMM\" (GPRS mobility management) for functions associated with mobility
management between an SGSN and a BSS; and
\- \"NM\" (network management) for functions associated with Gb-interface and
BSS-SGSN node management;
\- \"PFM\" (packet flow management) for functions associated with the
management of BSS Packet Flow Contexts (PFCs);
\- \"LCS\" (location services) for functions associated with location services
(LCS) procedures;
\- \"RIM\" (RAN Information Management) for functions associated with generic
procedures to communicate between two BSSs over the core network.
\- \"MBMS\" (Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) for functions associated
with Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) procedures.

## 5.4 Primitive parameters
### 5.4.1 BSSGP Virtual Connection Identifier (BVCI)
BSSGP Virtual Connections (BVCs) provide communication paths between BSSGP
entities. Each BVC is used in the transport of BSSGP PDUs between peer point-
to-point (PTP) functional entities, peer point-to-multipoint (PTM) functional
entities and peer signalling functional entities. Table 5.4.1 lists the
mapping of the BSSGP PDU to the associated functional entity and the BVCI. The
BVCI is used to enable the lower network service layer to efficiently route
the BSSGP PDU to the peer entity. This parameter is not part of the BSSGP PDU
across the Gb interface, but is used by the network service entity across the
Gb.
Any BSSGP PDU received by the BSS or the SGSN containing a PDU type that does
not fit, according to the mapping defined in table 5.4.1, with the functional
entity identified by the BVCI provided by the network service entity, is
discarded and a STATUS PDU with a cause value set to \"Protocol error -
unspecified\" is sent.
A PTP functional entity is responsible for PTP user data transmission. There
is one PTP functional entity per cell. Within the present document, a cell is
identified by a BVCI unless it is explicitly stated otherwise.
A PTM functional entity is responsible for PTM user data transmission. There
is one or more PTM functional entities per BSS.
A signalling functional entity is responsible for other functions e.g. paging.
There is only one signalling entity per Network Service Entity (NSE).There is
one or more NSEs per BSS.
Each BVC is identified by means of a BSSGP Virtual Connection Identifier
(BVCI) which has end-to-end significance across the Gb interface. Each BVCI is
unique between two peer Network Service Entities.
In the BSS, it shall be possible to configure BVCIs statically by
administrative means, or dynamically. In case of dynamic configuration, the
BSSGP shall accept any BVCI passed by the underlying Network Service entity.
At the SGSN side, BVCIs associated with PTP functional entities shall be
dynamically configured. The BVCIs associated with signalling functional
entities and PTM functional entities are statically configured.
The BVCI value 0000 hex shall be used for the signalling functional entities.
The BVCI value 0001 hex shall be used for the PTM functional entities.
All other values may be used freely by the BSS and shall be accepted by the
SGSN.

If the MS is in | | | STANDBY state, then the | | | BVCI=SIGNALLING. | | | | | | NOTE 3: The setting of the BVCI | | | is dependent upon the context | | | within which the STATUS PDU was | | | generated. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
### 5.4.2 Link Selector Parameter (LSP)
The link selector parameter is defined in 3GPP TS 48.016. At one side of the
Gb interface, all BSSGP UNITDATA PDUs related to an MS shall be passed with
the same LSP, e.g. the LSP contains the MS\'s TLLI, to the underlying network
service. The LSPs used at the BSS and SGSN for the same MS may be set to
different values.
### 5.4.3 [functional-name] PDU
The parameters that make up a [functional-name] PDU are defined in clause 10,
\"PDU Functional Definitions and contents\".
### 5.4.4 Network Service Entity Identifier (NSEI)
The Network Service Entity at the BSS and the SGSN provides the network
management functionality required for the operation of the Gb interface. The
Network Service Entity is described in 3GPP TS 48.016.
Each Network Service Entity is identified by means of a Network Service Entity
Identifier (NSEI). The NSEI together with the BVCI uniquely identifies a BSGP
Virtual Connection (e.g. a PTP functional entity) within an SGSN. The NSEI is
used by the BSS and the SGSN to determine the NS-VCs that provides service to
a BVCI.
### 5.4.5 BSS Context
The SGSN can provide a BSS with information related to ongoing user data
transmission. The information related to one MS is stored in a BSS context.
The BSS may contain BSS contexts for several MSs. A BSS context contains a
number of BSS packet flow contexts. A BSS packet flow context is identified by
a packet flow identifier assigned by the SGSN. There are four pre-defined
packet flows identified by four reserved packet flow identifier values. One
pre‑defined packet flow is used for best-effort service, one for signalling,
one for SMS, and one for TOM8. The BSS shall not negotiate BSS packet flow
contexts for these pre-defined packet flows with the SGSN.
NOTE: The TOM8 PFI is used to transfer LCS RRLP messages between the MS and
the SGSN.
NOTE: PFC procedures (Create BSS PFC, Modify BSS PFC, Delete BSS PFC) and PS
Handover procedures (PS Handover Required, PS Handover Request, PS Handover
Complete) do not apply to pre-defined packet flows.
### 5.4.6 MBMS Service Context
The SGSN can provide a BSS with information related to ongoing MBMS user data
transmission. The information related to one MBMS Session is stored in an MBMS
Service Context. A TMGI and optionally an MBMS Session Identity identify an
MBMS Service Context. The BSS may contain MBMS Service Contexts for several
MBMS Sessions.
### 5.4.7 TLLI
The TLLI is used to uniquely identify a mobile station and needs to be
included in a number of BSSGP PDUs across the Gb interface.
A change of TLLI may occur as a consequence of a P-TMSI reallocation. The new
TLLI shall be used to address the mobile station after completion on the
network side of the related GMM procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.008). However, the
SGSN should not use the new TLLI for BSSGP addressing purposes towards the BSS
either:
\- until having signalled the change of TLLI to the BSS via the Downlink
UNITDATA procedure (see sub-clause 6.1) or
\- until having received from the BSS any BSSGP PDU including the new TLLI.
# 6 User data and signalling procedures between RL and BSSGP SAPs
## 6.1 Downlink UNITDATA procedure
On the downlink, a DL-UNITDATA PDU shall contain information elements to be
used by the RLC/MAC function and an LLC-PDU. There shall be only one LLC-PDU
per DL-UNITDATA PDU. The LLC-PDU shall always be the last information element
in the DL-UNITDATA PDU, and shall be aligned on a 32 bit boundary for
efficient processing.
An SGSN provides the BSSGP with a current TLLI, identifying the MS. If an SGSN
provides a second TLLI, indicating that an MS has recently changed its TLLI,
this shall be considered as the \"old\" TLLI. A BSS uses the \"old\" TLLI to
locate an MS\'s existing context. Subsequent uplink data transfers for this MS
shall reference the current TLLI, and not the old TLLI.
The SGSN shall include the IMSI in the PDU. As an exception, the SGSN may omit
the IMSI in the PDU if the mobile station identified by the TLLI is in MM non-
DRX mode period (i.e. during a GMM procedure for _GPRS attach_ or _routing
area updating_ defined in 3GPP TS 24.008) and the SGSN does not have a valid
IMSI.
The SGSN may include the _Service UTRAN CCO_ (Cell Change Order) information
element in the PDU (relevant if the network initiated cell change order to
UTRAN, network initiated cell change order to E-UTRAN, PS handover to UTRAN or
PS handover to E-UTRAN procedures are used ). If this information element is
received in multiple PDUs (either DL-UNITDATA PDU(s), CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU(s) or
PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU(s)), the information element contained in the last
received PDU shall take precedence.
If the SGSN has valid DRX Parameters for a TLLI, then the SGSN shall include
them in the PDU. Nevertheless, the SGSN can omit the DRX Parameters if the MS
identified with the TLLI is in MM non-DRX mode period to speed up the
transmission of the LLC-PDU on the radio interface. The SGSN shall not send a
DL-UNITDATA PDU without the DRX Parameters IE if the MS identified with the
TLLI is not in MM non-DRX mode period.
An exception case is when the SGSN has uplink and downlink Coverage Class
information (previously received from the BSS in the UL-UNITDATA PDU) or eDRX
information (negotiated during NAS signalling) or both available for a given
MS in which case it shall proceed as follows when sending a DL-UNITDATA PDU
for that MS:
\- If uplink and downlink Coverage Class information is available for the MS
then the SGSN shall include the Coverage Class information in the DL-UNITDATA.
If a negotiated eDRX value is available then it shall also be included. The
SGSN considers the eDRX to be negotiated upon accepting the eDRX cycle value
requested by a MS during NAS signalling. If a negotiated eDRX value is not
available but DRX information is available then it shall be included. If the
target cell supports EC-GSM-IoT the corresponding LLC-PDU is delivered as
follows:
> \- If the MS is in idle mode a downlink packet resource assignment is sent
> on the EC-AGCH of its EC_CCCH_GROUP (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) using the
> indicated downlink Coverage Class information and the lowest eDRX cycle and
> the LLC PDU is sent thereon.
>
> \- If the MS is in packet transfer mode the LLC PDU is delivered using
> either an existing downlink EC TBF or using a new downlink EC TBF
> established by sending a downlink packet resource assignment on the EC-PACCH
> (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [22]) using the downlink Coverage Class information the
> BSS is currently using for that MS.
\- If Coverage Class information is not available but a negotiated eDRX value
is available for the MS then the SGSN shall include the negotiated eDRX value
in the DL-UNITDATA PDU. If the target cell supports eDRX the corresponding
LLC-PDU is delivered as follows:
> \- If the MS is in idle mode a downlink packet resource assignment is sent
> on the AGCH of its CCCH_GROUP (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) using the lowest
> eDRX cycle and the LLC PDU is sent thereon.
>
> \- If the MS is in packet transfer mode the LLC PDU is delivered using
> either an existing downlink TBF or using a new downlink TBF established by
> sending a downlink packet resource assignment on the PACCH (see 3GPP TS
> 44.060 [22]).
\- The SGSN shall apply these rules also when sending a DL-UNITDATA PDU to a
MS for which the GMM procedure for GPRS attach or routing area updating
(defined in 3GPP TS 24.008) has not yet completed.
An SGSN provides the BSSGP with MS specific information, enabling the RLC/MAC
entity in a BSS to transmit an LLC-PDU to the MS in a user specific manner.
The information made available to the radio interface includes:
\- MS Radio Access Capability. This defines the radio capabilities of the ME.
If there is valid MS Radio Access Capability information known by the SGSN for
the associated MS, the SGSN shall include it in the DL‑UNITDATA PDU.
Otherwise, MS Radio Access Capability shall not be present;
\- Packet Flow Identifier. This identifies the packet flow context associated
with the LLC PDU and is included by the SGSN if the packet flow context
feature is negotiated. If the mobile station does not support the PFC feature
or if the PFI is not known (e.g. the new SGSN did not get the PFI from the old
SGSN during a RAU) then the SGSN shall use the pre-defined PFI to indicate
best-effort QoS;
\- QoS Profile. This defines the (peak) bit rate, the type of BSSGP\'s SDU
(signalling or data), the type of LLC frame (ACK, SACK, or not), the
precedence class, and the transmission mode to be used when transmitting the
LLC-PDU across the radio interface;
\- PDU Lifetime. This defines the remaining time period that the PDU is
considered as valid within the BSS. If the PDU is held for a period exceeding
the \"PDU Lifetime\" time period, the PDU shall be locally discarded. The PDU
Lifetime is set within the SGSN by the upper layers.
An SGSN provides the BSSGP with Enhanced Coverage restriction information
which indicates to the BSS whether the use of enhanced coverage is restricted
or not for a given MS, thereby enabling the BSS to decide the allowable
coverage classes (uplink and/or downlink) for the MS while operating in packet
transfer mode.
A BSS may incorporate the PDU Lifetime, the Precedence and the (peak) bit rate
into its radio resource scheduler. If the PFI is present then the BSS may
incorporate the information from the associated ABQP into its radio resource
scheduler. The algorithm to do this is out of scope of the present document.
If the PFI is known in the BSS and does not correspond to a predefined PFI,
then:
\- the (peak) bit rate and the precedence class fields present in the QoS
Profile IE shall be ignored by the BSS;
\- if the Allocation/Retention Priority was provided at the time the
corresponding PFC was created or last modified, then the 'Priority' IE, if
present in the downlink UNITDATA PDU, is discarded.
Two types of BSSGP SDU are distinguished within the QoS Profile: layer 3
signalling and data. Layer 3 signalling may be transmitted over the Um
interface with higher protection. If the MS has an RR connection to the
network (see 3GPP TS 44.018), Layer 3 signalling may be transmitted over the
Um interface on the main signalling link of the RR connection, provided that
the LLC PDU meets length restrictions imposed by the BSS. In this case, the
BSS shall include the LLC PDU contained in the BSSGP PDU in the correspondent
Layer 3 Um interface message (see 3GPP TS 44.018).
The type of LLC frame indicates if the LLC frame type is an ACK or SACK
command/response, or not (see 3GPP TS 44.064). An ACK or SACK command/response
frame type may be transmitted over the Um interface with higher protection.
Two transmission modes across the radio interface are possible: acknowledged
(using RLC/MAC ARQ functionality) and unacknowledged (using RLC/MAC unitdata
functionality). These transmission modes do not apply when the MS has an RR
connection to the network and BSS uses the main signalling link of the RR
connection, in which case the acknowledged transmission mode is used.
If Priority is present, assuming it shall not be discarded according to the
rule above, only the priority-level field shall be regarded. The management of
priority levels is implementation dependent and under operator control. The
preemption capability indicator, the queuing allowed indicator and preemption
vulnerability indicator shall be ignored in this case.
In addition to constructing the DL-UNITDATA, the SGSN supplies the LSP, the
BVCI, the NSEI, and for an IP sub-network the NS Change IP endpoint,
associated with the MS to the lower layer network service, enabling network
service routeing to the peer entity. These parameters are not transmitted as
part of the BSSGP across the Gb-interface for the purpose of identifying the
receiving endpoint (they are sent in the BSSGP Perform-Location-Request PDU to
identify the serving cell of the target MS).
If the Gb-interface is supported using an IP sub-network, then the Resource
Distribution function at the SGSN may transmit a BSSGP DL-UNITDATA PDU with an
LLC-PDU Length Indicator set to 0. The BSS uses this DL‑UNITDATA to change the
IP endpoint at the SGSN to which any future UL-UNITDATA for the TLLI
(indicated in the DL-UNITDATA) is sent. The LLC-PDU with a Length Indicator
set to 0 is not sent across the radio interface.
In the case where localised service area is supported the SGSN may inform the
BSS as to which LSA identities that the mobile has preferences by sending the
LSA INFORMATION element. The BSS stores this information and uses it e.g. for
network controlled cell re-selection when determining specific cell selection
parameters for the mobile. The algorithm for determining specific cell
selection parameters for the mobile is not defined further in the present
document. The SGSN may inform the BSS about the contents of SPID in the DL-
UNITDATA PDU. In this case the SPID is stored in the BSS.
When the "Service Identification for improved Radio Utilization for GERAN"
(SIRUG) feature (see clause 5.3.5.3 of TS 23.060 [7]) is supported, and the
SGSN receives SCI information in the GTP-U header, the SGSN inserts the SCI IE
and the GGSN/P-GW location IE in the associated DL-UNITDATA PDU(s). The BSS
uses the Home PLMN ID contained within the IMSI and the GGSN/P-GW location
information to determine whether or not it can handle the SCI information for
that GGSN/P-GW. If it cannot, the BSS discards the SCI information and shall
treat the rest of the DL-UNITDATA normally.
In abnormal cases, if the SCI IE is received but the GGSN/P-GW location IE is
missing, then the BSS shall assume that the GGSN/P-GW is located in the VPLMN;
and, if the GGSN/P-GW location IE is received but the SCI IE is missing, then
the BSS shall ignore the GGSN/P-GW location IE.
Specific handling related to MOCN and GWCN configurations of network sharing,
is described in sub-clauses 6.6 and 6.7.
When the SGSN is using a GWCN configuration, and the BSSGP DL-UNITDATA PDU
contains a local TLLI, then the BSC shall use the registered Operator specific
NRI value to identify the corresponding serving operator.
Specific handling releted to Dedicated Core Networks as well as MS assisted
Dedicated Core Network selection is described in sub-clause 6.6.
An exception case is when the SGSN determines that there is data to be
delivered to a MS for which the MPM Timer is running (see sub-clause 8b.2.1).
In this case it shall not attempt delivery of that data until the MPM Timer
expires or is stopped.
### 6.1.1 Abnormal conditions
The following actions are defined in periods of congestion.
To satisfy the maximum number of service requests, the BSS may redistribute
MSs among cells (i.e. network controlled cell reselection is initiated). If
this occurs, the BSS may inform the SGSN through the RADIO-STATUS PDU (Radio
Cause value: cell reselection ordered). The BSS shall update any internal
references that indicate the location of the MS. The BSS may attempt to
internally re-route queued LLC frames to an MS that has been moved to a new
cell. If this functionality is not supported, or if it is not possible to
internally re-route LLC frames, the LLC frame shall be discarded.
It is the responsibility of the higher layer protocols in the SGSN to cope
with discarded LLC frames.
## 6.2 Uplink UNITDATA procedure
On the uplink, a UL-UNITDATA PDU shall contain information elements derived
from the RLC/MAC function (except when GTTP is used in the Um interface, see
3GPP TS 44.018), meaningful to higher-layer protocols in an SGSN, and an LLC-
PDU. There shall be only one LLC-PDU per UL‑UNITDATA PDU. The LLC-PDU shall
always be the last information element in the UL-UNITDATA PDU, and shall be
aligned on a 32 bit boundary for efficient processing.
The BSS shall provide the TLLI associated to the MS to the SGSN.
The BSS shall provide a BVCI and an NSEI indicating the PTP functional entity
(i.e. the cell) upon which the LLC‑PDU was received. The SGSN shall obtain the
BVCI, the NSEI, and in the case of an IP sub-network may obtain the LSP and
the NS Change IP endpoint, from the underlying network service; the BVCI and
the NSEI are not visible in the UL-UNITDATA PDU.
The BSS provides the SGSN with the QoS Profile used in the LLC-PDU
transmission from the mobile station across the radio interface.
\- QoS Profile. This reports the (peak) bit rate, the precedence used at radio
access and the transmission mode used across the radio path. The type of the
BSSGP SDU, layer 3 signalling or data, and the type of LLC frame, SACK, ACK,
or not, are not meaningful on the uplink and shall be ignored.
\- Packet Flow Identifier. This identifies the packet flow context that is
obtained from the mobile. If the mobile station does not provide a PFI then
the BSS shall use the pre-defined PFI to indicate best-effort QoS.
In order to support location based services, the BSS shall include the cell
identifier of the cell upon which the LLC‑PDU was received.
In the case where localised service area is supported, the BSS shall include
the LSA identities of the cell upon which the LLC-SDU was received. The BSS
may exclude LSA identities that are not included in the LSA INFORMATION
element.
If EC-GSM-IoT is supported by the BSS and the SGSN, then the BSS shall provide
in the UL-UNITDATA PDU:
\- The uplink and downlink Coverage Class if the downlink Coverage Class is
reported by the MS during system access see 3GPP TS 44.018 [25].
\- The exception report flag if the UL-UNITDATA PDU contains an LLC PDU sent
by the MS using an uplink EC TBF established in response to an EC PACKET
CHANNEL REQUEST message indicating high priority (i.e. an exception report),
see 3GPP TS 44.018 [25] and 3GPP TS 44.060 [22].
\- The exception report flag if the UL-UNITDATA PDU contains an LLC PDU sent
by the MS using an uplink EC TBF established in response to an EC PACKET
DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message including channel request and indicating high
priority (i.e. an exception report), see 3GPP TS 44.018 [25] and 3GPP TS
44.060 [22].
In addition to constructing the UL-UNITDATA, the BSS supplies the LSP, the
NSEI, the BVCI, and for an IP sub-network the NS Change IP endpoint,
associated with the MS to the lower layer network service, enabling network
service routeing to the peer entity. These parameters are not transmitted as
part of the BSSGP across the Gb-interface. If the Gb-interface is supported
using an IP sub-network, then the Resource Distribution function at the BSS
may transmit a BSSGP UL-UNITDATA PDU with an LLC-PDU Length Indicator set to
0. The SGSN uses this UL-UNITDATA to change the IP endpoint at the BSS to
which any future DL-UNITDATA for the TLLI (indicated in the UL‑UNITDATA) is
sent.
Specific handling related to the use of network sharing in a cell is described
in sub-clauses 6.6 and 6.7 for a mobile station non supporting network
sharing. In the case of a mobile station supporting network sharing the BSS
shall include the selected PLMN ID within the UL-UNIDATA PDU when a foreign
TLLI or a random TLLI is included in the same UL-UNIDATA PDU, as described
within sub-clause 10.2.2; both MS support and selected PLMN ID shall be
derived by the BSS from information within the RLC data block as described
within 3GPP TS 44.060 [22].
Specific handling related to Dedicated Core Network as well as MS assisted
Dedicated Core Network selection is described in sub-clause 6.6.
### 6.2.1 Abnormal conditions
None specified.
## 6.3 RA-CAPABILITY procedure
The SGSN stores an MS\'s current radio access capability (which may be changed
by higher layer mobility management procedures). An MS\'s current radio access
capability, and the TLLI identifying the MS, are conveyed to a BSS in a
RA‑CAPABILITY PDU. The received MS\'s radio access capability, if valid, shall
then replace any radio access capability previously associated with the MS.
### 6.3.1 Abnormal conditions
If the BSS receives an unknown Access Technology Type in the MS Radio Access
Capability field, it shall ignore the fields associated with that Access
Technology type.
If the BSS receives unknown fields within a known Access Technology Type in
the MS Radio Access Capability field, it shall ignore the unknown fields.
## 6.4 Downlink MBMS-UNITDATA procedure
On the downlink, a DL-MBMS-UNITDATA PDU shall contain information elements to
be used by an LLC-PDU. There shall be only one LLC-PDU per DL-MBMS-UNITDATA
PDU. The LLC-PDU shall always be the last information element in the DL-MBMS-
UNITDATA PDU, and shall be aligned on a 32 bit boundary for efficient
processing.
An SGSN provides the BSSGP with a current TMGI, if available, and MBMS Session
Identity, identifying the MBMS Service Context.
The information made available to the radio interface includes:
\- PDU Lifetime. This defines the remaining time period that the PDU is
considered as valid within the BSS. If the PDU is held for a period exceeding
the \"PDU Lifetime\" time period, the PDU shall be locally discarded. The PDU
Lifetime is set within the SGSN by the upper layers.
A BSS may incorporate the PDU Lifetime into its radio resource scheduler.
In addition to constructing the DL-MBMS-UNITDATA, the SGSN supplies the BVCI
and the NSEI to the BSS.
## 6.5 Uplink MBMS-UNITDATA procedure
On the uplink, a UL-MBMS-UNITDATA PDU shall contain an LLC-PDU. There shall be
only one LLC-PDU per UL‑MBMS-UNITDATA PDU. The LLC-PDU shall always be the
last information element in the UL-MBMS-UNITDATA PDU, and shall be aligned on
a 32 bit boundary for efficient processing.
The BSS shall provide the TMGI and, if present in the MBMS Service Context,
the MBMS Session Identity to the SGSN in order to identify the MBMS session.
The BSS shall provide a BVCI and an NSEI indicating the PTM functional entity
upon which the LLC‑PDU was received. The SGSN shall obtain the BVCI, the NSEI,
and in the case of an IP sub-network may obtain the LSP and the NS Change IP
endpoint, from the underlying network service; the BVCI and the NSEI are not
visible in the UL-MBMS-UNITDATA PDU.
In addition to constructing the UL-MBMS-UNITDATA, the BSS supplies the LSP,
the NSEI, the BVCI, and for an IP sub-network the NS Change IP endpoint,
associated with the MBMS session to the lower layer network service, enabling
network service routeing to the peer entity. These parameters are not
transmitted as part of the BSSGP across the Gb-interface. If the Gb-interface
is supported using an IP sub-network, then the resource distribution function
at the BSS may transmit a BSSGP UL-MBMS-UNITDATA PDU in order to change the IP
endpoint at the BSS to which any future DL-MBMS-UNITDATA for the MBMS session
(indicated with TMGI and, if available, MBMS Session Identity in the UL‑MBMS-
UNITDATA) shall be sent from the SGSN.
NOTE: In this version of the specification, the procedure is used for resource
distribution only meaning that the LLC PDU length indicator shall always be
set to zero.
## 6.6 Rerouting procedure in case of MOCN configuration for network sharing,
Dedicated Core Networks or MS assisted Dedicated Core Network selection
### 6.6.1 General
This procedure shall be supported by a BSS if it supports the MOCN
configuration (see [43]), if it supports Dedicated Core Networks or if is
supports MS assisted Dedicated Core Network selection. The rerouting procedure
in a GWCN configuration is described in sub-clause 6.7.
In the MOCN configuration the radio access part of the network is shared.
There may be more than one Gb-Interface towards the PS domain of different CN
operators from the BSS.
Rerouting procedure is a mechanism used as part of the assignment of CN
operator in shared networks with MOCN configuration or GWCN configuration (see
sub-clause 6.7) when an MS not supporting network sharing performs initial
attach/registration. In this case BSS may not know towards which SGSN to route
the initial MS request message and the latter may be rerouted to another SGSN
by BSS.
More precisely, in case of MOCN configuration, the selection of SGSN in BSS is
based on the NRI (valid or invalid) or by random selection. In case where the
SGSN cannot be deduced from the NRI and a _GPRS attach_ or _routing area
updating_ initial layer 3 message (defined in [11]) shall be transferred in
UL-UNITDATA message towards a SGSN, BSS shall choose a SGSN and initiate a
rerouting procedure.
To trigger a rerouting procedure in MOCN configuration, the BSS adds the
Redirect Attempt Flag IE to the UL-UNITDATA message, in order to indicate that
the SGSN shall respond by including either Redirection Indication IE or
Redirection Completed IE in DL-UNITDATA message.
For Dedicated Core Networks (DCNs) multiple DCNs may be deployed within a PLMN
where each DCN may be dedicated to serve specific type(s) of subscribers.
\- For DCN the Rerouting procedure is used as part of the selection of core
network node to serve the MS when it has successfully transmitted an initial
LLC PDU (i.e. Foreign or Random TLLI is used) to a BSS that supports DCN. More
precisely, the procedure provides the BSS with the Null-NRI/SGSN group ID
which the BSS uses to select a SGSN towards which the initial uplink LLC PDU
shall be routed.
\- To trigger a rerouting procedure in the case where a BSS cannot determine
an appropriate DCN for forwarding an uplink LLC PDU, the BSS selects an
available SGSN and adds the Redirect Attempt Flag IE to the UL-UNITDATA
message used to forward the uplink LLC PDU to that SGSN.
\- The inclusion of the Redirect Attempt Flag IE serves as indication to the
SGSN that, after determining where to re-route the LLC PDU, it shall respond
to the BSS by including either Redirection Indication IE or Redirection
Completed IE in the DL-UNITDATA message it sends in response to the UL-
UNITDATA message.
For MS assisted Dedicated Core Network selection the Rerouting procedure is
used for selection of a core network node to serve the MS when it supports MS
assisted Dedicated Core Network selection and has successfully transmitted an
initial LLC PDU to a BSS that supports MS assisted Dedicated Core Network
selection:
\- The BSS selects a DCN for the selected PLMN based on DCN-ID information
received from the MS and configuration information (i.e. information that
allows the BSS to interpret DCN-ID values), see 3GPP TS 44.060 [22].
\- The inclusion of the Redirect Attempt Flag IE in the UL-UNITDATA message
serves as indication to the SGSN that, after determining if it is the correct
DCN or not, it shall respond to the BSS by including either a Redirection
Indication IE or a Redirection Completed IE in the DL-UNITDATA message it
sends in response to the UL-UNITDATA message.
### 6.6.2 Reroute Indication
If the UL-UNITDATA message does not contain the _CS Registered Operator_ IE
and the SGSN cannot serve the request and reroute is possible (error causes
are related to subscription options - defined in [11]), the reject Layer 3
Information LLC-PDU (e.g. GPRS attach Reject) and a _Redirection Indication_
IE containing a Reroute Reject Cause shall be included in the DL-UNITDATA
message for the downlink direction.
When the IMSI, or in case the BSS supports CS/PS coordination enhancements,
the _CS Registered Operator_ IE or the _Selected Operator_ IE, is not included
in the UL-UNITDATA message and CS/PS domain registration coordination is
required (see [43]), the Initial LLC-PDU and a _Redirection Indication_ IE
containing the Reroute Reject Cause set to "CS/PS domain registration
coordination required" shall be included in the DL-UNITDATA message for the
downlink direction. CS/PS domain registration coordination may not be
performed for the operator's own subscribers by the SGSN.
In addition the DL-UNITDATA message shall contain:
\- The Initial LLC-PDU received from the MS;
\- The IMSI, if available;
\- The Unconfirmed send state variable, if available.
If the SGSN supports CS/PS coordination enhancements, the DL-UNITDATA message
shall also contain:
\- The Old Routing Area Identification as indicated by the MS in the Initial
LLC-PDU or,
\- The Attach Indicator in case the Initial LLC-PDU contains a GPRS attach
(see [11]).
In a MOCN configuration, if the BSS does not support CS/PS coordination
enhancements and the _Redirection Indication_ IE in the DL-UNITDATA message is
received from a SGSN which is not the last attempted, then the BSS shall re-
initiate the procedure towards another CN operator when possible (or possibly
to the same CN in case when CS/PS domain registration coordination is
required), with the following additional information in the UL-UNITDATA
message:
\- The Initial LLC-PDU as LLC-PDU;
\- The Redirect Attempt Flag IE;
\- The IMSI, if received from one of previously attempted CN operators;
\- The Unconfirmed send state variable, if received from previously attempted
CN operator.
If the BSS supports CS/PS coordination enhancements and the _Redirection
Indication_ IE in the DL-UNITDATA message is received from a SGSN which is not
the last attempted, it shall proceed as follows:
\- if the DL-UNITDATA message contains the Old Routing Area Identification and
the BSS from this information (and from BSS internal configuration) is able to
uniquely identify one of the CN operators in the shared network, then the BSS
shall re-initiate the procedure towards the SGSN of the identified CN operator
with the Selected Operator, Initial LLC-PDU, Redirect Attempt Flag, IMSI and
Unconfirmed send state variable (if received from previously attempted CN
operator) included in the UL-UNITDATA message;
\- if the DL-UNITDATA message contains the Old Routing Area Identification and
the BSS from this information (and from BSS internal configuration) cannot
identify one of the CN operators in the shared network, then the BSS shall
initiate the MS Registration Enquiry procedure in the CS domain (see [14]);
\- if the DL-UNITDATA message contains the Attach Indicator then the BSS shall
initiate the MS Registration Enquiry procedure in the CS domain (see [14]).
NOTE: The configuration by means the BSS identifies a CN operator from the
received Old Routing Area Identification is implementation dependent and under
operator control.
If, as a result of the MS Registration Enquiry procedure in the CS domain, the
MS is found to be registered with one of the shared CN operators, then the BSS
shall re-initiate the procedure towards the SGSN of the same CN operator with
the CS Registered Operator, Initial LLC-PDU, Redirect Attempt Flag, IMSI and
Unconfirmed send state variable (if received from previously attempted CN
operator) included in the UL-UNITDATA message.
If the MS is not found to be registered in the CS domain with any of the
shared CN operators, then the BSS shall perform CS/PS domain registration
coordination based on the received IMSI and re-initiate the procedure towards
the SGSN of the identified CN operator with the Selected Operator, Initial
LLC-PDU, Redirect Attempt Flag, IMSI and Unconfirmed send state variable (if
received from previously attempted CN operator) included in the UL-UNITDATA
message.
Upon reception of the downlink _Redirection Indication_ IE, the BSS shall
store as part of the Rerouting Function the associated Reroute _Reject Cause_
and _LLC-PDU_ related to this SGSN.
In case the Reroute _Reject Cause_ is set to \"CS/PS domain registration
coordination required\" and the BSS does not support CS/PS coordination
enhancements, then the BSS shall perform CS/PS domain registration
coordination based on the received IMSI. In this case the Reroute _Reject
Cause_ value and the associated _LLC-PDU_ shall not be stored.
For Dedicated Core Networks or for MS assisted Dedicated Core Network
selection, if the SGSN decides to reroute the handling of an initial uplink
LLC PDU to another CN node the DL-UNITDATA message shall also contain:
\- The Initial LLC-PDU received from the MS;
\- The IMSI, if received unencrypted from the MS;
\- The Null-NRI/SGSN group ID;
\- Additional P-TMSI, if available;
\- UE Usage Type.
If the BSS supports Dedicated Core Networks or if the BSS supports MS assisted
Core Network selection and the _Redirection Indication_ IE in the received DL-
UNITDATA message indicates a new SGSN (i.e. different from the previously used
SGSN), it shall select and route the initial uplink LLC PDU to the new SGSN.
The selection is based on the Null-NRI/SGSN Group ID and possibly also based
on the Additional P-TMSI received in the DL-UNITDATA message. If no valid SGSN
can be identified within the set of valid nodes the BSS selects either the
default DCN or an SGSN based on operator configuration see 3GPP TS 23.401. The
UL-UNITDATA message sent to the selected SGSN shall contain:
\- The Initial LLC-PDU received from the MS;
\- The IMSI, if available;
\- The Null-NRI/SGSN group ID;
\- UE Usage Type.
The presence of Null-NRI/SGSN Group ID in the UL-UNITDATA message indicates to
the SGSN that the message is a rerouted message and that the SGSN shall not
further reroute the initial LLC-PDU (see sub-clause 10.2.2). The UE Usage Type
shall be used by the SGSN to select a GGSN.
If the SGSN cannot serve the request, and if the Null-NRI/SGSN Group ID was
provided in the UL-UNITDATA message carrying the initial LLC-PDU, the SGSN
shall include the response LLC PDU (e.g. containing the GPRS attach Reject)
and a _Redirection Indication_ IE containing a Reroute Reject Cause (error
causes are related to subscription options - defined in [11]) in the DL-
UNITDATA message to the BSS.
In case all attempted CN operators have replied with a _Redirection
Indication_ IE, the BSS shall select the most appropriate Layer 3 Information
received from the attempted CN nodes based on the stored information as part
of the Rerouting procedure and send it back to the MS (see [11).
### 6.6.3 Reroute complete
If the SGSN can serve the request, the _Redirection Completed_ IE with outcome
value set to \"MS is accepted\" or \"MS is already registered\" and Layer 3
Information LLC-PDU (e.g. GPRS Attach Accept) shall be included in the DL-
UNITDATA message for the downlink direction.
Upon reception of the UL-UNITDATA message containing the _CS Registered
Operator_ IE, the SGSN supporting CS/PS coordination enhancements shall
conclude the Rerouting procedure and include the _Redirection Completed_ IE in
the DL-UNITDATA message.
Upon reception of the downlink _Redirection Completed_ IE, the BSS shall send
back the included LLC-PDU to the MS and terminate the Rerouting procedure.
### 6.6.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the SGSN cannot serve the request and rerouting is not possible, the
_Redirection Completed_ IE with outcome value set to \"MS is not accepted\"
and Layer 3 Information LLC-PDU (e.g. GPRS Attach Reject) shall be included in
the DL-UNITDATA message for the downlink direction.
If, as a result of the analysis of the DL-UNITDATA message, the MS
Registration Enquiry procedure is initiated in the CS domain and the MSC does
not support CS/PS coordination enhancements, then the BSS shall behave as if
the MS is not registered with the CN operator of that MSC.
## 6.7 Rerouting procedure in case of GWCN configuration for network sharing
### 6.7.1 General
This procedure shall be supported by a BSS and an SGSN if and only if both
nodes support CS/PS coordination enhancements in a GWCN configuration (see
3GPP TS 23.251 [43]). The rerouting procedure in a MOCN configuration is
described in sub-clause 6.6.
In the GWCN configuration the radio access part of the network as well as the
core network nodes (MSC and SGSN) are shared between the different CN
operators.
Rerouting procedure is a mechanism used as part of the assignment of a CN
operator in a shared network when a MS not supporting network sharing performs
initial attach/registration. Upon reception of the initial MS request message,
the BSS may not know which CN operator to select and thus which CN operator to
forward the initial MS request message to. If the initial MS request is not
accepted by the CN operator selected by the BSS, a reroute of the initial MS
request message to another CN operator within the shared network may be
needed.
More precisely, the selection of a CN operator in the BSS is based on the NRI
(valid or invalid) or by random selection. In case the CN operator cannot be
deduced from the NRI and a _GPRS attach_ or _routing area updating_ initial
layer 3 message (defined in [11]) shall be transferred in the UL-UNITDATA
message, the BSS shall select a CN operator and initiate the rerouting
procedure.
To trigger a rerouting procedure in a GWCN configuration, the BSS includes the
Redirect Attempt Flag IE in the UL-UNITDATA message. By including the Redirect
Attempt Flag IE in the UL-UNITDATA message, the SGSN supporting GWCN shall
respond by including either the Redirection Indication IE or the Redirection
Completed IE in the DL-UNITDATA message.
### 6.7.2 Reroute indication
If the UL-UNITDATA message does not contain the _CS Registered Operator_ IE
and the CN operator selected by the BSS cannot serve the MS and rerouting is
possible (error causes are related to subscription options \- defined in
[11]), the reject Layer 3 Information (e.g. GPRS Attach Reject) and a
_Redirection Indication_ IE containing a Reroute Reject Cause shall be
included in the DL-UNITDATA message for the downlink direction.
When neither the _CS Registered Operator_ IE nor the _Selected Operator_ IE is
included in the UL-UNITDATA message and CS/PS domain registration coordination
is required (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [43]), the Initial LLC-PDU and a _Redirection
Indication_ IE containing the Reroute Reject Cause set to "CS/PS domain
registration coordination required" shall be included in the DL-UNITDATA
message for the downlink direction. CS/PS domain registration coordination may
not be performed by the SGSN for the operator's own subscribers.
In addition the DL-UNITDATA message shall contain:
\- The Initial LLC-PDU received from the MS;
\- The IMSI, if available;
\- The Unconfirmed send state variable, if available.
\- The Old Routing Area Identification as indicated by the MS in the Initial
LLC-PDU or,
\- The Attach Indicator in case the Initial LLC-PDU contains a GPRS attach
(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [11]).
If the DL-UNITDATA message containing the _Redirection Indication_ IE is not
related to the last attempted CN operator, then the BSS shall proceed as
follows:
\- if the DL-UNITDATA message contains the Old Routing Area Identification and
the BSS from this information (and from BSS internal configuration) is able to
uniquely identify one of the CN operators in the shared network, then the BSS
shall re-initiate the procedure towards the identified CN operator with the
Selected Operator, Initial LLC-PDU, Redirect Attempt Flag, IMSI and
Unconfirmed send state variable (if received from previously attempted CN
operator) included in the UL-UNITDATA message;
\- if the DL-UNITDATA message contains the Old Routing Area Identification and
the BSS from this information (and from BSS internal configuration) cannot
identify one of the CN operators in the shared network, then the BSS shall
initiate the MS Registration Enquiry procedure in the CS domain (see 3GPP TS
48.008 [14]);
\- if the DL-UNITDATA message contains the Attach Indicator then the BSS shall
initiate the MS Registration Enquiry procedure in the CS domain (see 3GPP TS
48.008 [14]).
NOTE: The configuration by means the BSS identifies a CN operator from the
received Old Routing Area Identification is implementation dependent and under
operator control.
If, as a result of the MS Registration Enquiry procedure in the CS domain, the
MS is found to be registered with one of the shared CN operators, then the BSS
shall re-initiate the procedure towards the same CN operator with the CS
Registered Operator, Initial LLC-PDU, Redirect Attempt Flag, IMSI and
Unconfirmed send state variable (if received from previously attempted CN
operator) included in the UL-UNITDATA message.
If the MS is not found to be registered in the CS domain with any of the
shared CN operators, then the BSS shall perform CS/PS domain registration
coordination based on the received IMSI and re-initiate the procedure towards
the SGSN of the identified CN operator with the Selected Operator, Initial
LLC-PDU, Redirect Attempt Flag, IMSI and Unconfirmed send state variable (if
received from previously attempted CN operator) included in the UL-UNITDATA
message.
Upon reception of the _Redirection Indication_ IE, the BSS shall store as part
of the Rerouting Function the associated Reroute _Reject Cause_ and _LLC-PDU_
related to this CN operator.
In case all attempted CN operators have replied with a _Redirection
Indication_ IE, the BSS shall select the most appropriate Layer 3 Information
received from the attempted CN operators based on the stored information as
part of the Rerouting procedure and send it back to the MS (see 3GPP TS 24.008
[11]).
### 6.7.3 Reroute complete
If the selected CN operator accepts the initial request from the MS, then the
SGSN shall respond to the BSS with the _Redirection Completed_ IE, with the
Outcome value field set to \"MS is accepted\" or \"MS is already registered\",
and the Layer 3 Information LLC-PDU (e.g. GPRS Attach Accept) included in the
DL-UNITDATA message.
Upon reception of the UL-UNITDATA message containing the _CS Registered
Operator_ IE, the SGSN shall conclude the Rerouting procedure and include the
_Redirection Completed_ IE in the DL-UNITDATA message.
Upon reception of the DL-UNITDATA message with the _Redirection Completed_ IE
included in the message, the BSS shall send the LLC-PDU to the MS and
terminate the Rerouting procedure.
### 6.7.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the selected CN operator cannot serve the initial request from the MS and
rerouting to another CN operator is not possible, then the SGSN shall send the
DL-UNITDATA message to the BSS with the Outcome value field set to \"MS is not
accepted\" within the _Redirection Completed_ IE, and the Layer 3 Information
LLC-PDU (e.g. GPRS Attach Reject) included in the message.
If, as a result of the analysis of the DL-UNITDATA message, the MS
Registration Enquiry procedure is initiated in the CS domain and the MSC does
not support CS/PS coordination enhancements, then the BSS shall behave as if
the MS is not registered with any of the CN operators of that MSC.
# 7 Signalling procedures between GMM SAPs
## 7.1 Paging procedure
When an SGSN initiates the paging procedure for GPRS services as defined in
3GPP TS 24.008, it shall send one or more PAGING-PS PDUs to the BSS.
When instructed by an MSC/VLR to initiate a paging procedure for non-GPRS
services as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008, an SGSN shall send one or more PAGING-
CS PDUs to the BSS.
These paging PDUs shall contain the information elements necessary for the BSS
to initiate paging for an MS within a group of cells.
The SGSN provides an indication of the cells within which the BSS shall page
the MS. The levels of resolution within one BSS are: all cells within the BSS,
all cells on the BSS within one location area, all cells on the BSS within one
routing area, and one BVCI (i.e. cell). A routing area, a location area, or a
BSS area is associated with one or more NSEIs. If the cells in which to page
the MS are served by several NSEIs then one paging PDU must be sent to each of
these NSEIs.
A paging PDU shall be used to generate the corresponding radio interface
paging request message(s) to be transmitted at the appropriate time.
It should be noted that each paging PDU relates to only one MS and therefore a
BSS may pack pages for different MSs into the relevant 3GPP TS 24.008 or 3GPP
TS 44.060 radio interface paging request messages.
In the case of paging for non-GPRS services, the SGSN shall provide the MS\'s
IMSI and DRX Parameters. The SGSN shall also include the Global CN-Id
information element in the paging PDU when this information element is
received from the MSC/VLR. The Global CN-Id information element is received
from the MSC/VLR if paging using only the IMSI parameter as identifier of the
MS is performed via the SGSN when the MSC/VLR applies intra domain connection
of RAN nodes to multiple CN nodes as described in 3GPP TS 23.236. The BSS
shall then buffer this information element until receiving the paging response
from the MS in order to route the paging response to the correct MSC/VLR.
In the case of paging for GPRS services, the SGSN shall provide the MS\'s
IMSI. If DRX Parameters are available, the SGSN shall also provide the DRX
Parameters. If eDRX Parameters are available, the SGSN shall also provide the
eDRX Parameters (see sub-clause 7.1a).
NOTE: The IMSI and the DRX Parameters enable the BSS to derive the paging
population number. Paging without DRX parameters may require a considerable
extension of the paging duration.
An SGSN may provide the BSSGP with MS specific information, enabling a BSS to
execute the paging procedure in an MS specific manner. This includes:
\- QoS Profile. The Precedence parameter is set by the upper layers (in the
SGSN). The SGSN shall set the bit rate parameter to \"best effort\". The SGSN
shall set the transmission mode to unacknowledged. The BSS shall ignore the
received bit rate, the BSSGP SDU type, LLC type, and transmission mode
parameters;
\- PFI or an aggregate BSS QoS profile information which indicates if the page
is for signalling, for SMS, for TOM8, for best-effort, or for a specific
packet flow. The aggregate BSS QoS profile in this case is used for paging
only and is not stored by the BSS. If both of the optional PFI and ABQP IEs
are present, the ABQP takes precedence.
\- the most recently received downlink Coverage Class and the cell identity
for the cell where the Coverage Class was reported by the MS, if previously
received from the BSS in the UL-UNITDATA PDU.
\- MS Radio Access Capability defining the radio capabilities of the MS. If
there is valid MS Radio Access Capability information known by the SGSN for
the associated MS, the SGSN shall include it in the PAGING-PS PDU. Otherwise,
the MS Radio Access Capability shall not be present.
\- Paging Attempt Information consisting of Paging Attempt Count and Intended
Number of Paging Attempts information. If Paging Attempt Information is
provided then the Paging Attempt Count field shall be increased by one at each
new paging attempt performed for delivering a packet data payload available
for delivery. If the SGSN cannot determine the number of intended paging
attempts the SGSN shall use the code point 0000 corresponding to ´Information
not available´.
If an SGSN provides a P-TMSI in a PAGING-PS PDU, then the BSS shall use the
P-TMSI to address the MS. If the SGSN does not provide the P-TMSI in the
PAGING-PS PDU, then the BSS shall use the IMSI to address the MS.
If the BSS determines that the nominal paging group of the MS occurs too far
into the future (e.g. the BSS is unable to buffer the paging request until the
next occurrence of the nominal paging group for the indicated MS) it responds
to the PAGING-PS PDU by sending a PAGING-PS-REJECT PDU to the SGSN and
includes information indicating the time until the next paging occasion
therein.
If an SGSN provides a TLLI in a PAGING-CS PDU and a radio context identified
by the TLLI exists within the BSS, then the paging request message shall be
directly sent to the MS. If the SGSN does not provide the TLLI in the PAGING-
CS PDU or if no radio context identified by the TLLI exists within the BSS,
then the BSS shall use the TMSI, if provided in the PAGING-CS PDU, else the
IMSI, to address the MS.
The PAGING-CS PDU consists of the parameters described above for a PAGING-PS
PDU (except the P-TMSI, PFI, ABQP and QoS profile parameters) and, optionally,
some or all of the following parameters; TMSI, TLLI, Global CN-Id, Channel
Needed and eMLPP-Priority. The Channel Needed and eMLPP-Priority information
shall be handled transparently by the BSS.
The SGSN may send the BSS a DUMMY-PAGING-PS PDU at any time to determine the
time until the next paging occasion for the MS indicated therein. The BSS uses
the information provided within the DUMMY-PAGING-PS PDU to calculate the time
until the next paging occasion for the indicated MS and includes it within a
DUMMY-PAGING-PS-RESPONSE PDU it sends back to the SGSN.
A SGSN that supports Multilateration Timing Advance (MTA) procedure (see 3GPP
TS 44.031 and 3GPP TS 43.059 [23]) shall not send a PAGING-PS PDU to a BSS if
the MPM timer is running for the corresponding MS. Otherwise, if neither the
MPM timer nor Ready timer is running it may send a PAGING-PS PDU indicating
'positioning event triggered' in response to receiving a location request (see
sub-clause 8b.1). If the SGSN receives a corresponding page response it sends
the BSS managing the serving cell a PERFORM-LOCATION-REQUEST PDU and starts
the Ready timer. If the UL-UNITDATA PDU containing the page response includes
the "MultilaterationTiming Advance", "MS Sync Accuracy" and "BTS Reception
Accuracy Level" information elements the SGSN includes them in the PERFORM-
LOCATION-REQUEST PDU it sends to the serving BSS.
In case the network supports restricted use of enhanced coverage (see 3GPP TS
24.008 [46]), and the MS camps on a cell not supporting EC-GSM-IoT, the SGSN
may at any time check the status of Enhanced Coverage Restriction (RestrictEC
indication in 3GPP TS 24.008 [46]) obtained from HSS/HLR or retrieve the
status from the stored MS context and include it in the PAGING-PS PDU (see
sub-clauses 10.3.1 and 11.3.141) in order to inform the BSS about restriction
on the use of enhanced coverage. The BSS relays the restriction information to
the corresponding MS using PS domain paging procedures.
## 7.1a Paging procedure for Extended Coverage and eDRX
An SGSN may have any combination of uplink and downlink Coverage Class
information (previously received from the BSS in an UL-UNITDATA PDU) and eDRX
information (negotiated during NAS signalling) available for a given MS when
it determines that paging is necessary for that MS. When sending a PAGING-PS
PDU to a BSS to trigger paging for a given MS the SGSN shall include the most
recently received Coverage Class information and the most recent eDRX value
negotiated during NAS signalling for that MS. If the BVC-RESET procedure (see
sub-clauses 8.4 and 11.3.84) is performed and indicates a change to the eDRX
capability for a BSS, it shall not impact the most recent eDRX value
negotiated during NAS signalling for that MS.
In case the network supports restricted use of enhanced coverage (see 3GPP TS
24.008 [46]), and the MS camps on a cell supporting EC-GSM-IoT, the SGSN may
at any time check the status of Enhanced Coverage Restriction (RestrictEC
indication in 3GPP TS 24.008 [46]) obtained from HSS/HLR or retrieve the
status from the stored MS context and include it in the PAGING-PS PDU (see
sub-clauses 10.3.1 and 11.3.141) in order to inform the BSS about a
restriction on the use of enhanced coverage. The BSS relays the restriction
information to the corresponding MS using PS domain paging procedures.
### 7.1a.1 Coverage Class and eDRX information available
If uplink and downlink Coverage Class information and a negotiated eDRX value
are available for the MS the SGSN sends the BSS a PAGING-PS PDU that indicates
the available uplink and downlink Coverage Class information and the
negotiated eDRX information.
\- If a cell in the area targeted for paging supports EC-GSM-IoT and eDRX the
MS is paged on the EC-PCH of its EC_CCCH_GROUP using the indicated downlink
Coverage Class and eDRX information (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [48]).
\- If a cell in the area targeted for paging supports EC-GSM-IoT but not eDRX
the MS is paged on the EC-PCH of its EC_CCCH_GROUP using the lowest eDRX cycle
(see 3GPP TS 45.002 [48]) only if the PAGING-PS PDU indicates the lowest eDRX
cycle. Otherwise the MS is not paged.
\- If a cell in the area targeted for paging does not support EC-GSM-IoT the
MS is paged on the PCH using the indicated eDRX information if the MS Radio
Access Capability IE (see sub-clause 11.3.22) indicates that the MS supports
GPRS/EGPRS. The MS is not paged if the MS Radio Access Capability IE indicates
that the MS does not support GPRS/EGPRS.
### 7.1a.2 Coverage Class information not available, eDRX information
available
If uplink and downlink Coverage Class information is not available but a
negotiated eDRX value is available for the MS the SGSN sends the BSS a PAGING-
PS PDU that indicates the negotiated eDRX information. The MS is paged on the
PCH, using the indicated eDRX information, in the cell(s) in the area targeted
for the paging.
### 7.1a.3 Coverage Class information available, eDRX information not
available
If uplink and downlink Coverage Class information is available but a
negotiated eDRX value is not available for the MS the SGSN sends the BSS a
PAGING-PS PDU that indicates the available Coverage Class and DRX information
(if available).
\- If a cell in the area targeted for paging supports EC-GSM-IoT the MS is
paged on the EC-PCH of its EC_CCCH_GROUP (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) using the
indicated downlink Coverage Class information and the lowest eDRX cycle.
\- If a cell in the area targeted for paging does not support EC-GSM-IoT the
MS is paged on the PCH using DRX (the SGSN may include DRX information in the
PAGING-PS PDU) if the MS Radio Access Capability IE indicates that the MS
supports GPRS/EGPRS. The MS is not paged if the MS Radio Access Capability IE
indicates that the MS does not support GPRS/EGPRS.
## 7.1b Paging Procedure for Extended Coverage with Paging Indication
If the downlink Coverage Class information included in the PAGING-PS PDU
indicates CC3 or CC4 and the MSRAC capability indicates that the MS supports
monitoring of the EC-PICH, the BSS triggers for cells in the area targeted for
paging and broadcasting the support of EC-PICH, the sending of a paging
indication in the EC-PICH block, corresponding to the paging block for the
paging group of the MS, before scheduling the paging message in the paging
block. If the MSRAC capability does not indicate support for EC-PICH
monitoring, the BSS does not trigger the sending of a paging indication before
scheduling the paging message for the MS.
## 7.2 Radio Access Capability Update procedure
The BSS may request an MS\'s current Radio Access capability and/or its IMSI
by sending to an SGSN a RA‑CAPABILITY-UPDATE PDU which includes the TLLI of
the MS and a Tag. The allocation of the Tag is implementation specific. The
BSS then starts timer T5.
The SGSN shall respond by sending a RA-CAPABILITY-UPDATE-ACK PDU which
includes the TLLI of the MS, the Tag received in the corresponding RA-
CAPABILITY-UPDATE PDU, and an RA-Cap-UPD-Cause field; the IMSI of the MS is
also included when known. The BSS shall stop timer T5.
If the RA-Cap-UPD-Cause is set to \"OK\", then an MS Radio Access Capability
field and the IMSI shall be present. The received MS\'s radio access
capability, if valid, shall then replace any radio access capability
previously associated with the MS. If the RA-Cap-UPD-Cause is not set to
\"OK\", then neither the MS Radio Access Capability nor the IMSI shall be
present in the RA-CAPABILITY-UPDATE-ACK PDU.
### 7.2.1 Abnormal conditions
If an SGSN receives a RA-CAPABILITY-UPDATE PDU which includes an unknown TLLI,
it shall answer with a RA‑CAPABILITY-UPDATE-ACK PDU which includes the RA-CAP-
UPD-Cause set to the value \"TLLI unknown\".
If an SGSN receives a RA-CAPABILITY-UPDATE PDU which includes a known TLLI,
but there are no Radio Access parameters or IMSI known to the SGSN for the
associated MS, the SGSN shall reply to the request with a
RA‑CAPABILITY‑UPDATE-ACK PDU in which the RA-CAP-UPD-Cause is set to: \"no RA
capability or IMSI available\".
If a BSS receives a RA-CAPABILITY-UPDATE-ACK PDU containing a Tag which is
different from the last transmitted Tag by the BSS, it shall ignore the
reception of this PDU.
If a BSS sends a RA-CAPABILITY-UPDATE PDU to an SGSN and the RA-CAPABILITY-
UPDATE-ACK is not returned within a period T5 with the same Tag value as
provided in the request, the RA-CAPABILITY-UPDATE procedure shall be repeated
a maximum of RA-CAPABILITY-UPDATE-RETRIES attempts. The Tag value shall be
changed by the BSS at each new retry.
## 7.3 Radio Status procedure
A BSS and an MS radio interface communication status may change due to the
following:
1) the MS goes out of coverage and is lost;
This condition is signalled by setting the Radio Cause value to \"Radio
contact lost with MS\".
2) the link quality is too bad to continue the communication;
This condition is signalled by setting the Radio Cause value to \"Radio link
quality insufficient to continue communication\".
3) the BSS has ordered the MS to perform a cell reselection.
This condition is signalled by setting the Radio Cause value to \"Cell
reselection ordered\".
4) the BSS is preparing to order the MS to perform a cell-reselection to a new
cell and internal re-routing of packets to the new cell is not possible.
This condition is signalled by setting the Radio Cause value to \"Cell
reselection preparation\".
5) the BSS has detected that the packet cell change order has failed.
This condition is signalled by setting the Radio Cause value to \"Cell
reselection failure\".
Conditions 1) and 2) indicate that attempts to communicate between an MS and
an SGSN via this cell should be suspended or abandoned. An SGSN shall stop
sending LLC-PDUs to the cell for the MS. The criteria for deciding whether
condition 1) or 2) has occurred is not in the scope of the present document.
The conditions for resuming a suspended or abandoned communication between an
MS and SGSN are defined in 3GPP TS 24.008.
Condition 3) indicates that the SGSN should wait for a cell update before
resuming the transmission of LLC-PDUs to the BSS.
Condition 4) indicates that the SGSN shall suspend downlink transmission of
LLC-PDUs. This condition shall only be signalled if the Enhanced Radio Status
feature has been negotiated. For this condition the SGSN shall wait for
either:
a) a cell update from the MS in a new Cell . In this case the SGSN should
resume downlink transmission in the new Cell.
b) or a new RADIO-STATUS PDU from the BSS with a different Radio Cause value.
In this case the SGSN should follow the procedures specified for that Radio
Cause value.
Condition 5) indicates that the SGSN shall resume the transmission of LLC-PDUs
to the BSS in case the downlink transmission has been suspended. This
condition shall only be signalled if the Enhanced Radio Status feature has
been negotiated.A BSS shall signal these exception conditions to an SGSN by
sending a RADIO-STATUS PDU. It shall contain a reference to the MS, either
TLLI or TMSI or IMSI, and an indication of the exception condition, i.e. the
Radio Cause value.
After receipt of a RADIO-STATUS PDU with cause value indicating Condition 1-4,
the SGSN may try to locate the mobile station in case any downlink LLC PDU
needs to be sent to the mobile station, as it can not expect to receive
systematically an uplink LLC PDU from the mobile station or a RADIO-STATUS PDU
with cause value indicating Condition 5 from the BSS to resume the downlink
transfer. To this avail, the SGSN should send a PAGING-PS PDU towards the
mobile station.
## 7.4 SUSPEND procedure
If the MS signals to the BSS that it wishes its GPRS service to be suspended,
the BSS shall send a SUSPEND PDU to the SGSN and start timer T3. Actions
within the SGSN while an MS is suspended are not specified, but paging is
typically stopped. The SUSPEND PDU contains:
\- the TLLI of the MS; and
\- the Routeing Area of the MS as received in the Layer 3 Um interface message
GPRS Suspension Request (see 3GPP TS 44.018).
For each SUSPEND PDU received by an SGSN, a SUSPEND-ACK PDU shall be returned
to the BSS. Upon reception of the SUSPEND-ACK PDU, the BSS shall stop T3. The
SUSPEND-ACK PDU contains:
\- the TLLI of the MS as received in the SUSPEND PDU;
\- the Routeing Area of the MS as received in the SUSPEND PDU; and
\- the Suspend Reference Number.
The SGSN generates the Suspend Reference Number in a manner that it enables it
to differentiate between different SUSPEND PDUs relating to the same MS.
### 7.4.1 Abnormal conditions
If a SUSPEND-ACK PDU is not received for a SUSPEND PDU within T3 seconds, then
the SUSPEND PDU procedure shall be repeated a maximum of SUSPEND-RETRIES
attempts. After SUSPEND-RETRIES attempts the procedure is stopped and the O&M
system is informed.
If a SUSPEND-ACK PDU is received for an MS that is already marked as
suspended, then the SUSPEND-ACK PDU is ignored.
If a SUSPEND PDU refers to an MS which is unknown in the SGSN, then a SUSPEND-
NACK PDU is returned containing a cause value (Cause value: Unknown MS). The
BSS shall stop the SUSPEND procedure.
If the Suspend procedure is supported on the Gn interface, in case of an
inter-SGSN suspend procedure the MS shall not be treated as unknown in the
SGSN when the RA indicated in the SUSPEND PDU is not served by the SGSN.
## 7.5 RESUME procedure
When the reason why a GPRS-attached MS was suspended disappears, i.e.:
\- it leaves dedicated mode, disconnecting the MS from the MSC; or
\- it is handed over to a cell that supports DTM;
the BSS shall either a) instruct the MS to initiate the Routeing Area Update
procedure, or b) signal to the SGSN that an MS\'s GPRS service shall be
resumed.
If the BSS executes a), then no further action is required.
If the BSS executes b), then the BSS shall send a RESUME PDU containing the
same Suspend Reference Number received in the SUSPEND-ACK PDU to the SGSN and
start timer T4. The RESUME PDU contains:
\- the TLLI of the MS;
\- the Routeing Area of the MS; and
\- the Suspend Reference Number.
For each RESUME PDU received by an SGSN, a RESUME-ACK PDU shall be returned to
the BSS. Upon reception of the RESUME-ACK PDU, the BSS shall stop T4. The
RESUME-ACK PDU contains:
\- the TLLI of the MS; and
\- the Routeing Area of the MS.
### 7.5.1 Abnormal conditions
If a RESUME-ACK PDU is not received for a RESUME PDU within T4 seconds, then
the RESUME PDU procedure shall be repeated a maximum of RESUME-RETRIES
attempts. After RESUME-RETRIES attempts the procedure is stopped, the O&M
system is informed and the MS shall be instructed to initiate the Routeing
Area Update procedure.
If a RESUME-ACK PDU is received for an MS that is not suspended, then the
RESUME-ACK PDU is ignored.
If a RESUME PDU refers to an MS which is unknown in the SGSN, then a RESUME-
NACK PDU is returned containing a cause value (Cause value: Unknown MS). The
BSS shall stop the RESUME procedure and the MS shall be instructed to initiate
the Routeing Area Update procedure.
## 7.6 MS Registration Enquiry
### 7.6.1 General
This procedure shall be supported by a BSS if it supports CS/PS coordination
enhancements in a MOCN configuration (see sub-clause 6.6) or in a GWCN
configuration (see sub-clause 6.7).
The purpose of the MS Registration Enquiry procedure is to aquire registration
information for a given MS from the core network. More precisely, triggered
e.g. by the Rerouting procedure in the CS domain (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [14]),
the BSS sends an enquiry to the SGSN(s) whether a given MS is already
registered with any of the core network operators in the shared network.
### 7.6.2 Registration enquiry
The MS Registration Enquiry procedure is triggered by the BSS sending the MS
REGISTRATION ENQUIRY message to the SGSN containing the IMSI for the MS for
which the registration enquiry concerns.
To avoid a possible change of serving operator when the MS performs inter-RAT
mobility from E-UTRAN to GERAN (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [43]), the MS registration
enquiry may also need to be sent from the SGSN to the MME of the same CN
operator. For this reason the BSS includes the MME Query indicator in the MS
REGISTRATION ENQUIRY message.
The MS REGISTRATION ENQUIRY message is sent to each SGSN connected to the BSS.
However, in order to minimise the signalling in the core network, the MME
Query indicator shall only be included in one of the MS REGISTRATION ENQUIRY
messages addressing the same CN operator.
The SGSN responds with the MS REGISTRATION ENQUIRY RESPONSE message indicating
whether the MS is served by (one of) the CN operator(s) sharing the network.
### 7.6.3 Registration response
If the MS is found to be registered with (one of) the CN operator(s) sharing
the network, the SGSN shall return the MS REGISTRATION ENQUIRY RESPONSE
message to the BSS with the IMSI and the PS Registered Operator IE (containing
the serving CN operator) included in the message.
If the MS is not registered with (any of) the sharing CN operator(s), the SGSN
excludes the PS Registered Operator IE from the MS REGISTRATION ENQUIRY
RESPONSE message.
Upon reception of the MS REGISTRATION ENQUIRY RESPONSE message with the PS
Registered Operator IE included in the message, the BSS may terminate the MS
Registration Enquiry procedure regardless if one or more SGSNs have not yet
responded to the MS REGISTRATION ENQUIRY message.
# 8 Signalling procedures between NM SAPs
## 8.1 FLUSH-LL (logical link) procedure
When an SGSN detects a cell change of an MS from a cell update or a routing
area update, the SGSN shall send a FLUSH-LL PDU to the old BVC to initiate the
following procedures:
\- at a cell change within one NSE (e.g. the BSS is a NSE) and within one
routing area, LLC-PDU(s) for a given TLLI stored at an \"old\" BVCI
(corresponding to the old cell) are either deleted or transferred to a \"new\"
BVCI (corresponding to the new cell) with which the TLLI is currently
associated; or
\- at a cell change between two NSEs within one routing area, LLC PDU(s) for a
given TLLI stored at an \"old\" BVCI (corresponding to the old cell) are
either deleted or transferred to a \"new\" BVCI (corresponding to the new
cell) with which the TLLI is currently associated. In that case, transferring
of LLC PDU(s) can only be requested by the SGSN if the NSE underlying the
\"old\" BVCI indicated support for the \"Inter-NSE re-routing\";
\- at a cell change within the same routing area, and within one NSE or
between two NSEs, the on-going location procedure, if any, is either
maintained in the BSS after the cell reselection or aborted by the BSS towards
the SMLC; or
\- at a cell change between two routing areas, LLC-PDU(s) stored at the
\"old\" BVCI for the TLLI are deleted.
The SGSN provides the BSSGP with:
\- a MS\'s TLLI identifying the MS;
\- the \"old\" BVCI identifying the cell in which to find buffered LLC-PDU(s)
for the MS;
\- the \"new\" BVCI identifying the cell to which the MS is currently
associated (only when within the same routing area); and
\- if the SGSN supports \"Inter-NSE re-routing\" or \"LCS Procedures\" and the
old NSE supports the \"Inter-NSE re-routing\" or \"LCS Procedures\", the
\"new\" NSEI identifying the cell to which the MS is currently associated
(only when within the same routing area but between two NSEs). The NSEI
associated to the \"old\" BVCI shall be assumed if the \"new NSEI\" field is
not provided.
If there is a BSS context for the MS in the \"old\" BVCI and there is a
\"new\" BVCI in the FLUSH-LL PDU, the BSS shall interpret this as a request to
transfer the BSS context to the new cell. The BSS shall assume that the ABQP
that was negotiated for each PFC in the \"old\" BVCI is requested in the
\"new\" BVCI by the SGSN. Also, the values of the Packet Flow Timer and the
Service UTRAN CCO Information Elements should be kept for each transferred
PFC. If, when receiving the BSS context at the \"new\" BVCI, the BSS has
already obtained the information related to one or several PFC(s) from the
SGSN by means of the Create BSS PFC procedure (see sub-clause 8a.1), then the
BSS shall disregard the information corresponding to this (these) PFC(s)
within the BSS context transferred from the \"old\" BVCI. If a Create BSS PFC
procedure is ongoing when receiving the BSS context at the \"new\" BVCI, the
BSS shall either apply the received information or carry on with the currently
used ABQP until the procedure completes.
If a \"new\" BVCI is not provided, then the FLUSH-LL PDU shall be interpreted
as an instruction to delete the queued LLC-PDU(s) at the old BVC, and also to
delete the BSS context associated to the MS identified by the TLLI, if any
exists in the \"old\" BVCI.
Queued BSSGP signalling, e.g. pages, shall not be affected by this procedure.
In response to a FLUSH-LL PDU the BSS shall send a FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU to the
SGSN containing:
\- the TLLI received in the FLUSH-LL PDU;
\- an indication of whether the LLC-PDU(s) were \"transferred\" or
\"deleted\". In case the SDUs were \"transferred\" the BVCI (new) IE, and the
NSEI (new) IE if present in the FLUSH-LL PDU, shall be included;
\- the number of octets that have been transferred or deleted.
NOTE: In situations where the BSS was unable to transfer the queued LLC-PDUs
upon a transfer request from the SGSN, the BSS may indicate in the FLUSH-LL-
ACK PDU a flush action set to \"deleted\" together with the number of octets
actually deleted.
On receipt of a FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU by the SGSN, indicating that the LLC-PDU(s)
associated with the old BVC have been \"deleted\", the SGSN may choose to:
\- immediately retransmit all unacknowledged LLC-PDU(s) (in acknowledged LLC
operation) to the MS at the new BVC (i.e. new cell); or
\- rely on LLC retransmission mechanism to transmit unacknowledged LLC-PDU(s).
On receipt of a FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU by the SGSN, indicating that the LLC-PDU(s)
associated with the old BVC have been \"transferred\", the SGSN shall not take
any of the above actions.
If the \"new\" BVCI could not accept the QoS characteristics of all PFCs of
the BSS context, the BSS context shall still be transferred and the BSS shall
then initiate in the \"new\" BVCI a Modify BSS PFC procedure for each PFC for
which the requested ABQP could not be accepted. The BSS may resume the
transfer of downlink LLC PDU(s) before the Modify BSS PFC procedure is
completed.
In order to avoid desequencing DL LLC PDU (in LLC acknowledged or
unacknowledged operation) during the FLUSH procedure, upon sending a FLUSH-LL
PDU to the BSS requesting the rerouting of DL LLC PDUs to a new cell, the SGSN
should wait for the receipt of the FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU or rely on an internal
guard timer, before starting to transmit subsequent DL LLC PDUs on the new
BVCI. In the case the SGSN does not request the BSS to reroute DL LLC PDUs to
a new cell, it may immediately resume the transmission of subsequent DL LLC
PDUs on the new BVCI, or start the Create BSS PFC procedure, without waiting
for the receipt of the FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU.
### 8.1.1 Abnormal Conditions
If the BSS receives a FLUSH-LL PDU for an unknown BVCI or TLLI not associated
with the given BVCI, then the FLUSH-LL PDU is discarded and no FLUSH-LL-ACK
PDU is returned.
If the SGSN does not receive a FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU in response to a FLUSH-LL PDU,
no further action is taken.
## 8.2 Flow Control procedure
### 8.2.1 General model of operation
From the perspective of the BSSGP, the flow control mechanism is based on the
following model:
\- there is a downlink buffer for each BVC, as identified by a BVCI, in a BSS;
\- the transfer of BSSGP UNITDATA PDUs for an MS from the SGSN is controlled
by the BSS; and
\- only downlink BSSGP UNITDATA PDU transfer to the BSS is managed via flow
control procedures. Uplink flow control is not performed.
### 8.2.2 Mode of operation
The flow control mechanism manages the transfer of BSSGP UNITDATA PDUs sent by
the SGSN on the Gb interface to the BSS.
The BSS shall control the flow of BSSGP UNITDATA PDUs to its BVC buffers by
indicating to the SGSN the maximum allowed throughput in total for each BVC.
The BSS shall control the flow of BSSGP UNITDATA PDUs to the BVC buffer for an
individual MS by indicating to the SGSN the maximum allowed throughput for a
certain TLLI. If the PFC Flow Control feature is negotiated, the BSS may
control the flow of BSSGP UNITDATA PDUs to the BVC buffer for a certain PFC of
an individual MS by indicating to the SGSN the maximum allowed throughput for
a certain PFI.
If the Gigabit Interface feature has been negotiated, the granularity of the
Flow Control related information elements such as the _BVC Bucket Size_ IE,
the _BVC Bucket Leak Rate_ IE and the _PFC flow control parameters_ IE shall
be indicated through the _Flow Control Granularity_ IE included in the same
PDU (see sub-clauses 10.4.4, 10.4.6 and 10.4.24).
The BSS uses flow control to adjust the flow of BSSGP UNITDATA PDUs to a BVC
buffer. The amount of buffered BSSGP UNITDATA PDUs in the BSS should be
optimised to efficiently use the available radio resource. The volume of
buffered BSSGP UNITDATA PDUs for a BVC or MS or PFC should be low. BSSGP
UNITDATA PDUs queued within the BSS that are not transferred across the radio
interface before the PDU Lifetime expires shall be locally deleted from the
BSS. The local deletion of BSSGP UNITDATA PDUs in the BSS shall be signalled
to the SGSN by the transmission of a LLC-DISCARDED PDU.
For each FLOW-CONTROL PDU received by an SGSN, a confirmation shall always be
sent across the Gb interface by the SGSN. The confirmation uses the Tag that
was received in the FLOW-CONTROL PDU, which was set by the BSS to associate
the response with the request. When receiving no confirmation to a FLOW-
CONTROL PDU, the reasons that gave rise to the triggering of a flow control
message may trigger another message, or, if the condition disappears, it may
not. For the repetition of non-confirmed FLOW-CONTROL PDUs, the maximum
repetition rate still applies in the BSS.
### 8.2.3 Flow Control of Traffic from an SGSN to BSS
#### 8.2.3.1 Control of the downlink throughput by the SGSN
The principle of the BSSGP flow control procedures is that the BSS sends to
the SGSN flow control parameters which allow the SGSN to locally control its
transmission output in the SGSN to BSS direction. The SGSN shall perform flow
control on each BVC, on each MS and optionally on each PFC for an MS. The flow
control is performed on each LLC‑PDU first by the PFC flow control mechanism
if applicable and if negotiated, then by the MS flow control mechanism and
then by the BVC flow control mechanism.
If the PFC Flow Control feature has been negotiated and the LLC-PDU
corresponds to a PFC for which the SGSN has received some flow control
parameters, then the SGSN has to check that the LLC-PDU is passed by the
individual PFC flow control. If it is passed or if the PFC flow control has
not been negotiated, or if it has been negotiated but no flow control
parameter has been received for the PFC corresponding to the LLC-PDU, the SGSN
applies the MS flow control. If passed, the SGSN finally applies the BVC flow
control to the LLC-PDU. If an LLC-PDU is passed by all flow control
mechanisms, the entire LLC-PDU is delivered to the Network Services for
transmission to the BSS (see figure 8.1).
Figure 8.1: BSSGP Flow control
The flow control parameters sent by the BSS to the SGSN consist of the
following information:
\- the bucket size (Bmax) for a given BVC or MS or PFC in the downlink
direction; and
\- the bucket leak rate (R) for a given BVC or MS or PFC in the downlink
direction; and
\- the bucket full ratio for a given BVC or MS or PFC in the downlink
direction, if the Current Bucket Level (CBL) feature is negotiated.
NOTE: The information for a given PFC is only received if the PFC flow control
feature is negotiated.
The SGSN shall perform flow control on an individual MS using SGSN determined
values of Bmax and R unless it receives a FLOW-CONTROL-MS PDU from the BSS
regarding that MS. The SGSN shall continue to perform flow control for a
particular MS using the Bmax and R values received from the BSS for at least
Th seconds after receiving a FLOW-CONTROL-MS PDU from the BSS regarding that
MS. When timer Th has expired or when the MS changes cells, the SGSN may
reinitialise the SGSN internal flow control variables for that MS and begin to
use SGSN generated values for Bmax and R.
The SGSN shall start performing flow control on a given PFC for an individual
MS as soon as it receives the first FLOW-CONTROL-PFC PDU for that PFC and the
feature has been negotiated; it shall stop applying PFC flow control for a
given PFC of an individual MS as soon as it receives subsequently a FLOW-
CONTROL-MS PDU for that MS or if more than Tf seconds have elapsed since the
last FLOW-CONTROL-PFC PDU was received for that PFC. When the MS changes
cells, the SGSN shall stop performing flow control per PFC, until it receives
a FLOW‑CONTROL-PFC PDU .
In case the MS flow control parameters needs to be updated and the PFC flow
control feature is negotiated and the PFC flow control parameters for that MS
remains unchanged then the FLOW-CONTROL-PFC PDU is used by the BSS to update
the MS flow control parameters. The \"Number of PFCs\" IE within the \"PFC
Flow Control parameters\" IE shall be set to \"0\" in this case.
The BSSGP flow control model is the algorithm shown in Figure 8.2. The model
of the algorithm is that an LLC-PDU is passed by the algorithm as long as the
bucket counter (B) plus the length of the LLC-PDU does not exceed the bucket
size Bmax. When the LLC-PDU is passed, the LLC-PDU length is added to B. Any
PDU not transmitted is delayed until B plus the LLC-PDU length is less than
Bmax.
#### 8.2.3.2 Flow Control Conformance Definition
A BSSGP flow control algorithm shall be implemented in the SGSN. The BSSGP
flow control conformance algorithm is defined in figure 8.2.
The conformance definition is used to decide which LLC-PDUs are conforming to
the flow to the PFC of an MS, to an MS or in a BSSGP virtual connection (BVC)
over the Gb interface. The conformance definition should not be interpreted as
the required implementation algorithm, as the SGSN manufacturer may use any
algorithm as long as the operation of the BSSGP flow control does not violate
the objectives of compliant BVCs or MSs or PFC. That is, the SGSN shall never
transmit more data than can be accommodated within the BSS buffer for a BVC or
individual MS or for a given PFC of an MS.

Figure 8.2: Conformance Definition Algorithm for BSSGP Flow Control
The variables used by the algorithm are:
> Bmax Bucket Size. Set by the BSS for each cell and each mobile station and
> optionally for each PFC of an MS. Bmax shall be large enough to accommodate
> at least one LLC-PDU;
>
> R leak rate of the bucket;
>
> B bucket counter;
>
> B* predicted value of the bucket counter;
>
> L(p) length of LLC-PDU p;
>
> Tp the time that the last LLC-PDU p was transferred; and
>
> Tc arrival time of LLC-PDU p.
The initial conditions of these variables in the SGSN are:
\- Bmax = 0 for BVCs or MSs. For BVCs, this value is valid until Bmax is
received in the FLOW-CONTROL-BVC. For MSs, this value is valid until
Bmax_default_ MS is received in the FLOW-CONTROL-BVC PDU. Thereafter, sub-
clause 8.2.3.6, shall apply;
\- Bmax = 0 for PFCs until a FLOW-CONTROL-BVC PDU is received for the cell in
which the PFC is running. Thereafter, Bmax for a PFC shall not be greater than
Bmax of the corresponding MS until PFC flow control applies for the PFC. As
long as PFC flow control applies, Bmax shall then not be greater than the
value of Bmax provided in the latest valid FLOW-CONTROL-PFC PDU ;
\- R = 0 for BVC or MSs. For a BVC, this value is valid until a FLOW-CONTROL-
BVC PDU is received. For an MS, this value is valid until a FLOW-CONTROL-BVC
PDU is received. Thereafter, sub-clause 8.2.3.6 shall apply;
\- R = 0 for PFCs until a FLOW-CONTROL-BVC PDU is received for the cell in
which the PFC is running. Thereafter, R for a PFC shall not be greater than R
of the corresponding MS until PFC flow control applies for the PFC. As long as
PFC flow control applies, R shall then not be greater than the value of R
provided in the latest valid FLOW-CONTROL-PFC PDU ;
\- B = 0 (the bucket is empty); and Tp = the current time for the first LLC-
PDU.
The SGSN shall not transmit a LLC-PDU on a BVC until a FLOW-CONTROL-BVC PDU is
received from the BSS for that BVC.
When a LLC-PDU p arrives at current time Tc, the variable B* is set to the
predicted bucket size if the LLC-PDU were to be transferred to the BSS. This
is given by the previous bucket size plus the new LLC-PDU size, B* = B + L(p),
less the amount that the bucket will have leaked away since the last compliant
LLC-PDU, R x (Tc - Tp). If this is less than L(p) then the LLC-PDU is
compliant and the bucket size B is reset to L(p) and the LLC-PDU is passed.
When a compliant LLC-PDU is passed the last LLC-PDU transfer time is set to
the current time, Tp = Tc.
If the bucket has not completely leaked away then the bucket has to be checked
to see if the limit Bmax is going to be exceeded, B* > Bmax. If the limit is
exceeded then the LLC-PDU is non compliant and is delayed for some time
period, and no updates are done on the variables. If the bucket limit Bmax is
not exceeded then the LLC-PDU is compliant and the bucket counter (B) is set
equal to the value of B*. When a conforming LLC-PDU is passed then the last
LLC-PDU transfer time is set to the current time, Tp = Tc.
On receipt of a FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU by the SGSN, indicating that the LLC-PDU(s)
associated with the old BVC have been \"deleted\", the SGSN should update the
value of the bucket counter (B) for the MS and for the old BVC, B = max (B -
N, 0). N is provided by FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU, indicating the number of octets
deleted by the BSS.
On receipt of a FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU by the SGSN, indicating that the LLC-PDU(s)
associated with the old BVC have been \"transferred\" within the NSE, the SGSN
should update the value of the bucket counter (B) for the old BVC, B = max (B
- N, 0). The value of B for the new BVC should also be updated, B = min (B +
N, Bmax). N is provided by FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU, indicating the number of octets
transferred by the BSS.
On receipt of a LLC-DISCARDED PDU by the SGSN, indicating that the LLC-PDU(s)
associated with the MS or the PFC of an MS have been locally deleted by the
BSS, the SGSN should update the value of the bucket counter (B) for the MS or
the PFC and for the BVC, B = max (B - N, 0). N is provided by LLC-DISCARDED
PDU, indicating the number of octets deleted by the BSS.
The BSS may update the values of Bmax and R within the SGSN at any time by
transmitting a new Flow Control PDU containing the new Bmax and R values. The
variables B, B*, Tp and Tc are local to the SGSN and are not affected by the
reception of a Flow-Control-BVC or Flow Control-MS PDU.
If the Current Bucket Level (CBL) feature is negotiated, the SGSN shall update
the variable B based upon the Bucket_Full_Ratio information element received
in the Flow Control PDU. During the time period when SGSN does not receive a
Flow Control PDU, it shall continue computing the bucket counter (B) as
defined above.
#### 8.2.3.3 Response time within the SGSN to flow control messages
Upon reception of flow control requests from a BSS, the SGSN shall modify its
downlink transmission as instructed within 100 ms.
#### 8.2.3.4 Frequency of sending BVC or MS or PFC Flow Control PDUs
The rate at which the BSS is allowed to send flow control PDUs for a given BVC
or MS or PFC is limited and defined by the following rule: the BSS may send a
new Flow Control PDU every C seconds, where C is a value which is pre‑defined
and common to the BSS and SGSN.
If the BSS detects a missing FLOW-CONTROL-ACK PDU from the SGSN and the
condition which causes the sending of a FLOW-CONTROL PDU still remains, the
FLOW-CONTROL PDU may be retransmitted immediately. In this case the BSS may
violate the repetition rate defined by the C value.
After a BVC reset procedure, the BSS may send a BVC-BLOCK PDU. Otherwise, the
BSS shall send a BVC-FLOW-CONTROL PDU. When the blocked BVC is unblocked, a
BVC-FLOW-CONTROL PDU shall be sent.
#### 8.2.3.5 FLOW-CONTROL PDUs
Based on the criteria for flow control, a BSS shall send to an SGSN a FLOW-
CONTROL PDU containing a list of IEs.
For BVC Flow Control, the following information is sent:
\- the maximum bucket size (Bmax) for the BVC on the Gb Interface;
\- the leak rate parameter (R) to be applied to the bucket;
\- the bucket full ratio to resynchronize the bucket counter for the BVC, if
the Current Bucket Level (CBL) feature is negotiated;
\- the default MS bucket size (Bmax_default_MS);
\- the default MS leak rate (R_default_MS); and
\- the optional measurement of the delay for PDU delivery inside that BVC.
For MS Flow Control, the following information is sent:
\- the TLLI identifying the MS;
\- the maximum bucket size (Bmax) for this MS on the Gb interface;
\- the leak rate parameter (R) to be applied to the bucket; and
\- the bucket full ratio to resynchronize the bucket counter for the MS, if
the Current Bucket Level (CBL) feature is negotiated.
For PFC Flow Control, the following information is sent:
\- the TLLI identifying the MS;
\- the maximum bucket size (Bmax) for this MS on the Gb interface (optional);
\- the leak rate parameter (R) to be applied to the bucket (optional);
\- the bucket full ratio to resynchronize the bucket counter for the MS, if
the Current Bucket Level (CBL) feature is negotiated (optional);
\- the number of PFCs for which flow control parameters are included;
for each PFC:
\- the PFI identifying the PFC for that MS;
\- the maximum bucket size (Bmax) for this PFC on the Gb interface;
\- the leak rate parameter (R) to be applied to the bucket;
\- the bucket full ratio to resynchronize the bucket counter for the PFC, if
the Current Bucket Level (CBL) feature is negotiated.
NOTE: The supply of the MS flow control parameters inside the FLOW-CONTROL-PFC
PDU allows the SGSN utilising the most up-to-date parameters both for PFC and
MS flow control. Also, because the receipt of a FLOW-CONTROL-MS PDU notifies
the end of PFC flow control for a given MS, if the MS flow control parameters
have changed since the last update, then it is necessary to provide the MS
flow control parameters inside the FLOW-CONTROL-PFC PDU.
#### 8.2.3.6 Condition of Bmax for MS after Initial Flow-Control-BVC
The SGSN may use the following (informative) equation to generate an initial
bucket size, Bmax, for an MS.
Bmax (bits) = min (R_default_MS for 1 s, 72 000, max MS throughput for 1 s,
(max MS throughput for 1 s + current throughput of all other MSs in the cell
for 1 s) / number of MSs in the cell)
where, the number of MSs in the cell includes the MS being added.
Under no circumstance shall the SGSN use a value of Bmax greater than
Bmax_default_MS for an MS unless it receives a FLOW-CONTROL-MS PDU from the
BSS for that MS.
The SGSN shall not use a leak rate (R) for an MS greater than R_default_MS
unless it receives a FLOW-CONTROL-MS PDU from the BSS for that MS.
### 8.2.4 Flow Control of Uplink Traffic from a BSS to an SGSN
No flow control procedures are defined between the BSS and the SGSN in uplink
direction.
## 8.3 BVC blocking and unblocking procedure
### 8.3.1 PTP BVC
The following statement applies only for PTP BVC.
The BVC blocking and unblocking procedures are initiated by the BSS to remove
from use, or bring in to use, a BVC.
A BSS may block one BVC because of:
\- operation and Maintenance intervention for a cell;
\- equipment failure at the BSS;
\- cell equipment failure at the BSS; or
\- other causes not regarded in phase 1 of the implementation of GPRS (Cause
Value: \"reserved for future use\").
When a BSS wishes to block a BVC, the BSS shall mark that BVC as blocked,
thereafter discarding any traffic sent to the BVC in the uplink direction. The
cell associated with the BVC should not accept data in the downlink direction.
The BSS shall send a BVC-BLOCK PDU to the SGSN and start timer T1. The BVC-
BLOCK PDU contains:
\- the BVCI of the BVC to be blocked; and
\- a Cause element indicating the reason for blocking (typical cause values:
O&M intervention, Equipment failure).
On receipt of a BVC-BLOCK PDU, the SGSN shall mark the indicated BVC as
blocked and stop transmitting traffic addressed to this BVC. The SGSN shall
then acknowledge the blocking of the BVC by sending a BVC-BLOCK-ACK PDU to the
BSS.
The BVC-BLOCK-ACK PDU contains the BVCI received in the BVC-BLOCK PDU.
On receipt of the BVC-BLOCK-ACK PDU the BSS shall stop timer T1.
The BVC shall be seen as blocked by an SGSN until a BVC-UNBLOCK PDU is
received indicating that the BVC\'s status has changed.
During the BVC blocking procedure, traffic in transit to or from a cell is in
an indetermined state and may be lost. When unblocking a BVC both the BSS and
SGSN shall be in an operational state, i.e. the underlying network service and
the BVC shall be available for use.
If a BSS wishes to unblock a blocked BVC it shall send a BVC-UNBLOCK PDU, and
start timer T1.
The BVC-UNBLOCK PDU contains:
\- the BVCI of the BVC to be unblocked.
If a BVC-UNBLOCK PDU is received by an SGSN for a blocked BVC, the BVC shall
be marked as unblocked and a BVC-UNBLOCK-ACK PDU shall be returned to the BSS,
containing the BVCI received in the BVC-UNBLOCK PDU.
The BSS shall stop timer T1 on receipt of the BVC-UNBLOCK-ACK PDU and mark the
BVC as unblocked.
### 8.3.2 Signalling BVC
The blocking and unblocking procedure is not applicable for the signalling
BVC. The signalling BVC shall never be blocked.
### 8.3.3 Abnormal Conditions
The following statements apply only for a signalling BVC.
If a BVC-BLOCK PDU is received by an SGSN for the signalling BVC, the PDU is
ignored.
If a BVC-BLOCK-ACK PDU is received by a BSS for the signalling BVC, the PDU is
ignored.
If BVC-UNBLOCK PDU is received by an SGSN for the signalling BVC, the PDU is
ignored.
If BVC-UNBLOCK-ACK PDU is received by an BSS for the signalling BVC, the PDU
is ignored.
The following statements apply only for PTP BVC.
If a BVC-BLOCK-ACK PDU is not received for a BVC-BLOCK PDU within T1 seconds,
then the BVC-BLOCK PDU procedure shall be repeated a maximum of BVC-BLOCK-
RETRIES attempts. After BVC-BLOCK-RETRIES attempts the BVC remains blocked,
the procedure is stopped and the O&M system is informed.
If a BVC-UNBLOCK-ACK PDU is not received for a BVC-UNBLOCK PDU within T1
seconds, then the BVC-UNBLOCK PDU procedure shall be repeated a maximum of
BVC-UNBLOCK-RETRIES attempts. After BVC-UNBLOCK-RETRIES attempts the status of
the BVC remains blocked, the procedure is stopped and the O&M system is
informed.
If traffic is received on a BVC that is marked at a BSS or at an SGSN as
blocked, and no BVC-Unblocking procedure is pending, the received PDU shall
not be accepted and a STATUS PDU (Cause value: BVC blocked) shall be sent to
the peer entity on the signalling BVC. The STATUS PDU shall indicate the BVCI
of the BVC upon which the error was detected.
If a BVC-BLOCK PDU is received by an SGSN for a blocked BVC, a BVC-BLOCK-ACK
PDU shall be returned.
If a BVC-UNBLOCK PDU is received by an SGSN for an unblocked BVC, a BVC-
UNBLOCK-ACK PDU shall be returned.
If an unexpected BVC-BLOCK-ACK PDU is received by a BSS, and it is related to
a BVC that is locally blocked, the BVC-BLOCK-ACK PDU is discarded. If the BVC-
BLOCK-ACK PDU is related to a BVC that is not locally blocked, then a BVC
unblock procedure shall be performed.
If an unexpected BVC-UNBLOCK-ACK PDU is received by a BSS and it is related to
a BVC that is locally not blocked, the BVC-UNBLOCK-ACK PDU is discarded. If
the BVC-UNBLOCK-ACK PDU is related to a BVC that is locally blocked, then a
BVC block procedure shall be performed.
## 8.4 BVC-RESET procedure
The purpose of the BVC-RESET procedure is to synchronise the initialisation of
GPRS BVC related contexts at a BSS and SGSN. This enables the BSS and SGSN to
begin communication in known states. A BVC-RESET procedure is performed
because of recovery procedures related to:
\- a system failure in the SGSN or BSS that affects GPRS BVC functionality
(e.g. processor recovery);
\- an underlying network service system failure; or
\- a change in the transmission capability of the underlying network service,
where the \"change\" is from zero kbps to greater-than-zero kbps;
\- a change in mapping between the BVCI and cell identifier.
The BSS may also send BVC-RESET as a means to create the initial mapping
between BVCIs and cell identifications.
After any of the possible events stated above, the status of the affected BVCs
may be inconsistent at the SGSN and the BSS. After performing the BVC Reset
procedure all affected BVCs are assumed to be unblocked at the SGSN. The reset
procedure forces a consistent state upon SGSN and BSS by requiring that after
the completion of the BVC-Reset procedure the BSS initiates the block
procedure for all affected BVCs that are marked as blocked at the BSS.
Before a BSS (or SGSN) sends a BVC-RESET PDU, the operational status of the
associated network service shall be obtained by the BSS (or SGSN).
If the associated network service is operational, the BSS (or SGSN) shall send
a BVC-RESET PDU to its peer entity and start timer T2. The BSS (or SGSN) may
receive BVC related signalling and UNITDATA PDUs before the procedure is
acknowledged, but shall not transmit PDUs.
If the associated network service is not operational, the BVC-RESET procedure
is postponed until internal periodic status checks indicate that it is
operational.
The BVC-RESET PDU contains:
\- the BVCI of the reset BVC;
\- a cause element indicating the reason for reset;
\- the cell identifier, when the reset is for a PTP BVC and BSS is initiator
of the reset;
\- feature bitmap, when the reset is for a signalling BVC.
After the SGSN (or BSS) has initialised all affected GPRS related contexts, a
BVC-RESET-ACK PDU is returned.
The BVC-RESET-ACK PDU contains:
\- the BVCI of the reset BVC;
\- the cell identifier, when the reset is for a PTP BVC and SGSN is initiator
of the reset.
Upon reception by a BSS (or SGSN) of the BVC-RESET-ACK PDU the timer T2 is
stopped.
### 8.4.1 Signalling BVC
After any failure affecting the NSE, the party (BSS or SGSN) where the failure
resided shall reset the signalling BVC. After sending or receiving a BVC-RESET
PDU for the signalling BVC, the BSS shall stop all traffic and initiate the
BVC-RESET procedure for all BVCs corresponding to PTP functional entities of
the underlying network service entity. The BSS must complete the BVC-RESET
procedure for signalling BVC before starting PTP BVC-RESET procedures.
The Feature bitmap is sent to identify the optional features that can be
supported by the network service entity. After completion of the signalling
BVC-RESET procedure both entities shall locally determine the common set of
optional features supported by both NSEs. This is done by performing the bit
AND operation of the received Feature bitmap with its own Feature bitmap.
If the Feature bitmap IE is missing in a signalling BVC-RESET or BVC-RESET-ACK
PDU or if the result of the AND operation is \'0\' then no optional features
are activated.
After sending or receiving a BVC-RESET PDU for the signalling BVC, the SGSN
shall stop all traffic in the PTP BVCs of the corresponding NSE.
### 8.4.2 PTP BVC
After any failure affecting only part of the BVC functionality not including
the signalling BVC the party where the failure resided shall reset only the
affected BVCs.
If the BSS was the initiator of the BVC-RESET procedure, the BSS may initiate
the blocking procedure upon receipt of a BVC-RESET-ACK PDU. If the SGSN was
the initiator of the BVC-RESET procedure while the affected BVC is marked as
blocked at the BSS side, the BSS shall initiate the BVC-Blocking procedure
after having returned the BVC‑RESET-ACK PDU to the SGSN.
Upon reception of a BVC-RESET PDU, the SGSN (or BSS) shall discard UNITDATA
PDUs addressed to the reset BVC.
After reset of a PTP BVC, UNITDATA PDUs addressed to the BVC may then be
received and transmitted, unless it is blocked.
### 8.4.3 Abnormal Conditions
The following statements are valid for both signalling and PTP BVC.
If a BSS (or SGSN) sends a BVC-RESET PDU to an SGSN (or BSS) and the BVC-
RESET-ACK PDU is not returned within a period T2, the BVC-RESET procedure
shall be repeated a maximum of BVC-RESET-RETRIES attempts. After BVC-RESET-
RETRIES attempts the procedure is stopped and the O&M system is informed. In
case of PTP BVC, the status of all affected BVCs at the BSS (or SGSN) shall be
blocked as a consequence.
If the BSS receives a BVC-RESET PDU for a BVCI which is unknown in the BSS,
then the BSS shall return a STATUS PDU towards the SGSN including the BVCI and
the cause value \'BVCI unknown\'.
If the BSS (or SGSN) has sent a BVC-RESET PDU for a BVCI to the SGSN (or BSS)
and is awaiting a BVC-RESET-ACK PDU in response, but instead receives a BVC-
RESET PDU indicating the same BVCI, then this shall be interpreted as a BVC-
RESET ACK PDU and the T2 timer shall be stopped.
The BVC_RESET for signalling BVC overrides all pending procedures for PTP BVC,
i.e. other pending procedures are stopped and corresponding running timers are
stopped.
If the BSS (or SGSN) receives an unexpected BVC-RESET ACK PDU, this shall be
ignored.
If the BSS has sent a BVC-UNBLOCK PDU and receives a BVC-RESET PDU before the
BVC-UNBLOCK-ACK PDU has been received from the SGSN, then the BSS shall
consider the corresponding BVC marked as unblocked.
## 8.5 Trace procedure
The purpose of the trace invocation procedure is to inform the receiving
entity that it should begin producing a trace record on an MS. The trace is
invoked by an SGSN by sending an SGSN-INVOKE-TRACE PDU to the peer entity. The
SGSN-INVOKE-TRACE PDU is not acknowledged.
The events and parameters to be recorded are indicated in the \"Trace type\"
information element are defined in 3GPP TS 32.008.
The remaining elements, when received, are to be passed transparently to the
OMC receiving the trace record.
The element \"OMCId\", if present, indicates the OMC to which the record is
destined.
The PDU includes a trace reference which is allocated by the entity which
triggered the trace.
The element \"TriggerId\", if present, indicates the entity which triggered
the trace.
The Trace Reference and TriggerId IEs are used to tag the trace record to
allow simpler construction of the total record by the entity which combines
trace records.
## 8.6 Overload Control procedure
### 8.6.1 General
This procedure is defined to control the traffic to the SGSN from BSC when the
SGSN is in an overload situation.
The philosophy used at BSS side is:
\- If T15 is not running and an OVERLOAD PDU including the _Priority Class
Indicator_ IE is received, then traffic for the indicated priority class
should be reduced by one step. At the same time, timers T15 and T16 should be
started.
\- During T15, all received OVERLOAD PDU should be ignored.
\- If T16 expires, the traffic should be increased by one step and T16 should
be re-started unless full load has been resumed.
\- The number of steps and the method of reducing/increasing the load are
considered to be an implementation specific function.
### 8.6.2 Overload Operation
The SGSN could indicate to the BSS that it is in a congested state by sending
an OVERLOAD PDU and request the BSS to reduce the traffic for the category of
MSs indicated in the _Priority Class Indicator_ IE.
The BSS receiving the OVERLOAD PDU shall assume the SGSN sending the PDU as
being in an overloaded state and reduce the traffic to the SGSN using the
algorithm described in sub-clause 8.6.1.
The amount of traffic could be reduced by using the Access Control Class in
the system information message defined in 3GPP TS 44.018. However it is
implemention specific regarding how the BSS reduces the traffic in response to
receiving an OVERLOAD PDU.
# 8a Signalling procedures between PFM SAPs
## 8a.1 Create BSS PFC procedure
### 8a.1.0 General
If the BSS receives a request to transfer an uplink or downlink LLC PDU for
which it currently does not have a BSS packet flow context and the PFI does
not indicate best-effort or SMS or TOM8 or signalling then the BSS should send
a DOWNLOAD-BSS-PFC PDU to the SGSN and start timer T6. In the uplink case the
TLLI, optional Radio Priority, and optional Packet Flow ID are received from
the MS as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060. Until the BSS receives the BSS PFC the
BSS shall handle uplink and downlink transfers according to a best-effort
default aggregate BSS QoS profile. For uplink transfers the best-effort
default profile is specific to the radio priority level.
If the BSS receives a request to transfer an uplink or downlink LLC PDU
associated to a PFI indicating best-effort or SMS or TOM8 or signalling then
the BSS may handle the corresponding transfer according to an operator-defined
aggregate BSS QoS profile. Indeed the latter cannot be negotiated with the
SGSN for those flows. It is also up to the implementation what
Allocation/Retention Priority is granted to those flows.
If the BSS does not receive a PFI from the MS, e.g. from a R97 or R98 MS, the
BSS shall not send a DOWNLOAD-BSS-PFC PDU to the SGSN. In this case the QoS
Profile IE is utilized instead.
Following a DOWNLOAD-BSS-PFC PDU if there is not an ongoing Delete PFC
procedure for that corresponding PFI, the SGSN shall send a CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU
to the BSS with a requested Aggregate BSS QoS Profile and start timer T7. On
receipt of CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU the BSS stops timer T6 and responds with a
CREATE-BSS-PFC-ACK PDU containing the negotiated Aggregate BSS QoS Profile.
The BSS may restrict the requested ABQP given its capabilities and the current
load. The SGSN may include the _Service UTRAN CCO_ (Cell Change Order)
information element in the PDU (relevant if the network initiated cell change
order to UTRAN, network initiated cell change order to E-UTRAN, PS handover to
UTRAN or PS Handover to E-UTRAN procedures are used). If this information
element is received in multiple PDUs (either DL-UNITDATA PDU(s), CREATE-BSS-
PFC PDU(s) or PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU(s)), the information element contained
in last received PDU shall take precedence. If there is an ongoing Delete PFC
procedure the SGSN shall not send a CREATE-BSS-PFC-PDU (see subclause 8a.3).
The SGSN may also initiate the Create BSS PFC procedure. It is not required
that the SGSN receive a DOWNLOAD‑BSS-PFC PDU before sending a CREATE-BSS-PFC
request.
The CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU may trigger a call admission control algorithm in the
BSS to check whether the requested ABQP can be served. If there is valid MS
Radio Access Capability IE known by the SGSN for the associated MS, the SGSN
shall include it in the CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU. If the MS Radio Access Capability
IE are not present in the request, then the Radio Access Capability Update
procedure may be called.
The BSS may return a CREATE-BSS-PFC-NACK with a cause if it is unable to
create or modify the PFC. On receipt of a CREATE-BSS-PFC-ACK PDU which does
not convey the cause \'PFC queuing\' (cf. sub-clause 8a.1.0a) or of a CREATE-
BSS-PFC-NACK PDU the SGSN shall stop timer T7.
The Packet Flow Timer (PFT) is provided to the BSS by the SGSN. It is defined
as the maximum time the BSS may hold the PFC during periods of inactivity for
a PFC. The timer is started upon the receipt of a CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU and
restarted after the transmission of an uplink PDU for that PFC. The timer is
also restarted upon the transfer of the corresponding PFC from an old to a new
cell.
If a CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU is received for an MS which has a BSS PFC in the BSS,
then this shall be interpreted by the BSS as a request to:
\- create a new PFC if the PFI included in the PDU is not known in the BSS,
\- modify an existing PFC if the PFI included in the PDU is already known in
the BSS.
The SGSN may inform the BSS about the contents of SPID in the CREATE-BSS-PFC
PDU. In this case the SPID is stored in the BSS.
### 8a.1.0a Allocation/Retention Priority handling
The SGSN may include the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ information element
in the CREATE-BSS-PFC- PDU. If this information element is received and the
BSS supports ARP handling, the BSS shall establish or modify the resources
according to the values of the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE (priority
level, pre-emption indicators, queuing) and the resource situation as follows:
\- The BSS shall consider the priority level of the requested PFC, when
deciding on the resource allocation.
\- If the requested PFC is allowed for queuing and the resource situation so
requires, the BSS may place the PFC in the establishment queue.
\- The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (singularly or in
combination) be used to determine whether the PFC assignment has to be
performed unconditionally and immediately. If the requested PFC is marked as
\"may trigger pre-emption\" and the resource situation so requires, the BSS
may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced release
of a lower priority PFC which is marked as \"pre-emptable\". Whilst the
process and the extent of the pre-emption procedure is operator dependent, the
pre-emption indicators, if given in the CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU, shall be treated
as follows:
1\. The values of the last received _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE and
_Priority Level_ IE shall prevail.
2\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to \"may trigger pre-emption\",
then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption procedure.
3\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to \"shall not trigger pre-
emption\", then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption
procedure.
4\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to \"pre-emptable\", then
this connection shall be included in the pre-emption process.
5\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to \"not pre-emptable\", then
this connection shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
6\. If the _Priority Level_ IE is set to \"no priority\" the given values for
the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE and _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE shall not
be considered. Instead the values \"shall not trigger pre-emption\" and \"not
pre-emptable\" shall prevail.
\- If the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE is not given in the CREATE-BSS-
PFC -PDU, the allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption process and
the connection may be pre-empted and considered to have the value \"lowest\"
as priority level. Moreover, queuing shall not be allowed.
\- The BSS pre-emption process shall keep the following rules:
1) The BSS shall only pre‑empt PFCs with lower priority, in ascending order of
priority.
2) The pre-emption may be done for PFCs belonging to the same MS or to other
MSs.
If the BSS is unable to create the PFC immediately and the ARP IE was present
in the CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU indicating that queuing is allowed for the PFC, the
BSS may put the PFC creation request or modification in a queue. In that case,
it shall send a CREATE-BSS-PFC-ACK PDU including the cause \'PFC queuing\' to
the SGSN and start the timer T10. This timer specifies the maximum time for
queuing of the request of establishment or modification; its value is provided
by the SGSN in the CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU. Several PFCs for a given MS may be
queued in parallel. While a PFC is queued, the BSS shall handle the
corresponding uplink or downlink transfers according to a best-effort default
aggregate BSS QoS profile.
For each PFC that is queued the following outcomes shall be possible:
\- successfully established or modified;
\- failed to establish or modify;
\- failed due to expiry of the timer T10.
When the SGSN receives the response that the requested PFC is queued, the SGSN
shall expect the BSS to provide the outcome of the queuing function for the
PFC before expiry of T7. In case the timer T7 expires, the SGSN shall consider
the create BSS PFC procedure terminated and failed.
The BSS shall report the outcome of the queuing for every queued PFC. The BSS
shall stop the timer T10 associated to a given PFC when it has been
successfully established or modified. The BSS shall then send a CREATE-BSS-
PFC-ACK PDU with cause \'PFC created successfully\' to the SGSN for that PFC,
informing the SGSN of the negotiated ABQP. Upon receipt of the CREATE-BSS-PFC-
ACK PDU with cause \'PFC created successfully\' from the BSS, the SGSN shall
stop timer T7.
In the case the timer T10 expires, the create BSS PFC procedure terminates in
the BSS for the corresponding PFC and the BSS shall send a CREATE-BSS-PFC-NACK
PDU with cause \'PFC create failure\'. The SGSN shall then consider the create
BSS PFC procedure terminated and failed.
In case the SGSN wishes to delete a PFC which is being queued, it shall stop
timer T7 and start the delete BSS PFC procedure. Upon receipt of the request
to delete the PFC, the BSS shall take it out from the queue and proceed with
the rest of the procedure, as described in sub-clause 8a.3.
In case the SGSN wishes to modify a PFC which is being queued, it shall
restart timer T7 and send a CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU as described in sub-clause
8a.1. Upon receipt of the request to modify the PFC, the BSS shall take it out
from the queue and treat the new request.
### 8a.1.1 Abnormal conditions
If the SGSN receives a DOWNLOAD-BSS-PFC PDU with an unknown PFI it shall not
respond with a CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU.
If a CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU is not received for a DOWNLOAD-BSS-PFC PDU within T6
seconds, then the DOWNLOAD-BSS-PFC PDU shall be repeated a maximum of
DOWNLOAD-BSS-PFC-RETRIES attempts. After DOWNLOAD-BSS-PFC-RETRIES + 1 attempts
the procedure is stopped and the O&M system is informed. If a BSS PFC is not
received then the BSS shall handle uplink and downlink transfers according to
a best-effort default aggregate BSS QoS profile.
If a CREATE-BSS-PFC-ACK or CREATE-BSS-PFC-NACK PDU is not received in response
to a CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU within T7 seconds, then the CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU shall
be repeated a maximum of CREATE-BSS-PFC-RETRIES attempts. After CREATE-BSS-
PFC-RETRIES+1 attempts the procedure is stopped and the O&M is informed.
If a BSS not supporting ARP handling is unable to create the PFC then a
CREATE-BSS-PFC-NACK PDU is returned with a cause value (e.g. Cause value: PFC
create failure). The SGSN shall stop the Create BSS PFC procedure.
If a BSS supporting ARP handling is unable to create the PFC immediately and
the ARP IE was not present in the CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU or the ARP IE was present
but queuing is not allowed for the PFC, then a CREATE-BSS-PFC-NACK PDU is
returned with cause value \'PFC create failure\'. The SGSN shall then stop the
Create BSS PFC procedure.
If a CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU is received in the BSS for an MS for which the PS
Handover Required procedure is ongoing, the BSS shall ignore the CREATE-BSS-
PFC PDU and return a CREATE-BSS-PFC-NACK PDU to the SGSN indicating Cause \"MS
under PS Handover treatment\".
## 8a.2 Modify BSS PFC procedure
The BSS may request modification of the contents of an existing BSS PFC at any
time via the MODIFY-BSS-PFC PDU, e.g. due to a change in resource availability
at the BSS. The BSS sends the MODIFY-BSS-PFC PDU and start timer T8. The SGSN
inserts the modified parameters in the MODIFY-BSS-PFC PDU into the relevant
PDP contexts. The SGSN shall respond to a modify request with a MODIFY-BSS-
PFC-ACK PDU except when there is an ongoing Delete BSS PFC procedure for that
PFI (see sub-clause 8a.3). The SGSN may restrict the requested aggregate BSS
QoS profile given its capabilities and current load. The Packet Flow Timer
(PFT) may be provided to the BSS by the SGSN. This timer is (started or)
restarted upon the receipt of the MODIFY‑BSS‑PFC-ACK PDU and restarted after
the transmission of an uplink PDU for that PFC. On receipt of a response to
the Modify procedure the BSS shall stop timer T8.
The SGSN can reject the profile proposed by the BSS by answering with a
MODIFY-BSS-PFC-ACK PDU containing the previous ABQP. The SGSN may request the
modification of the contents of a BSS PFC at any time via the CREATE-BSS-PFC
PDU, e.g. due to the activation, modification, or deactivation of a PDP
context. It shall not use the MODIFY-BSS-PFC PDU. If the BSS PFC already
exists the BSS shall interpret the PDU as a modification request and the BSS
shall reply with a CREATE-BSS-PFC-ACK. The BSS may restrict the requested ABQP
given its capabilities and the current load.
The Modify BSS PFC procedure shall never be initiated for an MS for which the
PS Handover Required procedure is ongoing.
### 8a.2.1 Abnormal conditions
If a MODIFY-BSS-PFC-ACK is not received in response to a MODIFY-BSS-PFC PDU
within T8 seconds, then the MODIFY-BSS-PFC PDU shall be repeated a maximum of
MODIFY-BSS-PFC-RETRIES attempts. After MODIFY‑BSS-PFC-RETRIES+1 attempts the
procedure is stopped and the O&M is informed.
## 8a.3 Delete BSS PFC procedure
The SGSN may request the deletion of a BSS PFC at any time using the DELETE-
BSS-PFC PDU. The BSS shall respond with a DELETE-BSS-PFC-ACK PDU. In case of
user inactivity the BSS may delete a BSS packet flow context without notifying
the SGSN. In case the BSS is no longer able to support the BSS PFC ABQP, it
may send a DELETE-BSS-PFC-REQ PDU with cause 'PFC pre-empted' or 'ABQP no more
supported' to the SGSN. The SGSN may either start the Delete BSS PFC procedure
or a new Create BSS PFC procedure. In case the BSS receives neither a DELETE-
BSS-PFC PDU nor a CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU the behaviour in the BSS is
implementation specific.
The Delete BSS PFC procedure takes precedence over the Modify BSS PFC and the
Create BSS PFC procedures, i.e. when the BSS receives a DELETE-BSS-PFC PDU it
shall abort any ongoing Create BSS PFC or Modify BSS PFC procedure for that
PFI.
If a DELETE-BSS-PFC PDU is received for an MS for which the PS Handover
Required procedure is ongoing, the BSS shall initiate the PS Handover Cancel
procedure and continue the Delete BSS PFC procedure for the corresponding MS.
## 8a.4 PS Handover Required procedure
In the case of an intra-BSS PS Handover or intra-BSS DTM Handover, the
optimized intra-BSS handover procedure may be used (see 3GPP TS 44.060); in
such case, the PS Handover Required procedure is not used.
When a BSS initiates a PS handover or DTM Handover it shall initiate the PS
Handover Required procedure and send the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU to the SGSN.
Except in the case of DTM Handover, the BSS shall then start timer T12 (see
NOTE).
NOTE: The DTM Handover procedure is guarded at the source BSS by the BSSMAP
timer T23 (see 3GPP TS 48.008).
If DTM Handover is ongoing and was initiated for a reason specific to the
packet resources, or PS Handover is ongoing, the _Cause_ IE of the PS-
HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU should be set to an appropriate value (e.g. \"Uplink
quality\", \"Uplink strength\", \"Downlink quality\", \"Downlink strength\",
\"Distance\", \"Better cell\", \"Traffic\" or \"O&M intervention\").
NOTE: The radio related cause values are not applicable to the DTM Handover.
If DTM Handover is ongoing, and was initiated for a reason specific to the
dedicated resource, the _Cause_ IE shall indicate \"CS cause\".
The BSS should not initiate the PS handover required procedure in the case of
an MOCN or a GWCN configuration if the Rerouting procedure is ongoing.
The BSS shall not initiate the PS handover required procedure in case CS to PS
SRVCC from GERAN to UTRAN or to E-UTRAN [25] is ongoing. The reception of a
PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU will initiate the PS Handover Required procedure in
the SGSN and the allocation of resources in the target system.
If PS handover to A/Gb mode is required, the source BSS shall include the
_Source BSS to Target BSS Transparent Container_ IE and the _Target Cell
Identifier_ IE in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU.
If PS handover to Iu mode is required, the source BSS shall include the
_Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE and the _Target RNC Identifier_ IE
in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU. The _Source to Target Transparent Container_
IE shall be encoded as the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE
as specified in 3GPP TS 25.413 or 3GPP TS 44.118.
If PS handover to a UTRAN CSG cell or hybrid cell is required, the source BSS
shall include the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE, _Target RNC
Identifier_ IE and the _CSG Identifier_ IE in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU.
The source BSS shall set the value of the _Cell Access Mode_ field in the _CSG
Identifier_ IE according to the information received from the MS through
measurement reporting as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060. The _Source to Target
Transparent Container_ IE shall be encoded as the _Source RNC to Target RNC
Transparent Container_ IE as specified in 3GPP TS 25.413.
NOTE: In this specification: A CSG cell is a reported cell for which the
access mode indicates "Closed access mode" as defined in [39] and Hybrid Cell
is a reported cell for which the access mode indicates "Hybrid access mode" as
defined in [39].
If PS handover to E-UTRAN is required, the source BSS shall include the
_Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE and the _Target eNB Identifier_ IE
or the _Target RNC Identifier_ IE (carrying the Corresponding RNC-ID of the
target eNB) in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU. The _Source to Target Transparent
Container_ IE shall be encoded as the _Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent
Container_ IE as specified in 3GPP TS 36.413.
If PS handover to a E-UTRAN CSG cell or hybrid cell is required, the source
BSS shall include the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE, the _Target
eNB Identifier_ IE, _Tracking Area Code_ IE and the _CSG Identifier_ IE in the
PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU. The source BSS shall set the value of the _Cell
Access Mode_ field in the _CSG Identifier_ IE according to the information
received from the MS through measurement reporting as defined in 3GPP TS
44.060. The _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE shall be encoded as
the _Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container_ IE as specified in 3GPP
TS 36.413.
The _Active PFCs List_ IE informs the SGSN about which PFCs that are active
for the MS in the source cell at the time of sending the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED
PDU. The concept of \"Active PFCs\" is defined in 3GPP TS 43.129. The _Active
PFCs List_ IE shall not contain any pre-defined PFIs.
For DTM Handover to A/Gb mode, the source BSS shall include the _CS Indication
IE_ in the _Source BSS to Target BSS Transparent Container_ IE. The contents
of the _CS Indication_ IE shall uniquely identify, for this MS, the handover
attempt, and shall be identical to the contents of the _PS Indication_ IE
included in the BSSMAP HANDOVER REQUIRED message (see 3GPP TS 48.008). The
_Target Cell Identifier_ IE shall identify the same cell as the one specified
in the _Cell Identifier List (preferred)_ IE in the corresponding BSSMAP
HANDOVER REQUIRED message (see 3GPP TS 48.008).
For DTM Handover to UTRAN, the source BSS shall set the _Number of Iu
Instances_ IE equal to 2 in the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent
Container_ IE (see 3GPP TS 25.413)
When the resource allocation in the target system is complete, the SGSN shall
send a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-ACK PDU to the source BSS and end the PS Handover
Required procedure.
The _Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container_ IE, or the _Target to
Source Transparent Container_ IE as received from the target system, shall be
included in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-ACK PDU.
Except in the case of DTM Handover, the source BSS shall, on reception of the
PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-ACK PDU from the SGSN, stop timer T12, trigger the
transmission of the PS HANDOVER COMMAND message towards the MS (as specified
in 3GPP TS 44.060) and end the PS Handover Required procedure. In the case of
DTM Handover, the PS Handover Required procedure is terminated when timer T23
is stopped for any reason or expires as specified in 3GPP TS 48.008. The
subsequent behaviour of the network is specified in 3GPP TS 48.008.
In case of unsuccessful PS Handover, the source BSS shall be notified through
the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-NACK PDU.
When the SGSN terminates the PS Handover Required procedure by sending a PS-
HANDOVER-REQUIRED-NACK PDU to the source BSS, the _Cause_ IE should be set to
an appropriate value (e.g. \"PFC create failure\", \"Cell traffic
congestion\", \"Equipment failure\", \"O&M intervention\" , \"PS Handover
Target not allowed\" or \"PS Handover not Supported in Target BSS or Target
System\").
Except in the case of DTM Handover, upon reception of a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-
NACK PDU from the SGSN, the source BSS shall stop timer T12 and terminate the
ongoing PS Handover Required procedure.
For DTM Handover, the source BSS behaviour on receipt of a PS-HANDOVER-
REQUIRED-NACK PDU is described as part of the Handover Required procedure (see
3GPP TS 48.008).
The source BSS shall always include the "_Reliable Inter RAT Handover Info_ "
indicator set to '1'in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-PDU when the target is a GERAN
A/Gb mode BSS if the _Inter RAT Handover Info_ IE is available and was
received from the SGSN in a PS-HANDOVER-COMPLETE-ACK or a CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU
or a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU with _"Reliable Inter RAT Handover Info
Indicator"_ set to "1". It shall be set to '0' otherwise.
If the SGSN receives the _CSG Identifier_ IE in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU
and the _Cell Access Mode_ field is set to "CSG cell", it shall perform access
control as specified in 3GPP TS29.060. If the MS is allowed to access the
target cell, the SGSN shall continue the PS handover to the target side as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.060. If the MS is not allowed to access the target
cell, the SGSN shall send the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-NACK PDU with the _Cause_
IE set to "Invalid CSG cell"to the source BSS. If the _Cell Access Mode_ field
in the _CSG Identifier_ IE is set to "Hybrid cell", the SGSN shall provide the
CSG membership status of the MS and the _CSG Id_ to the target side as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.060.
### 8a.4.1 Abnormal conditions
Except in the case of DTM Handover, if timer T12 expires in the source BSS and
there has been no response from the SGSN to the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU, the
source BSS may initiate a new PS Handover Required procedure for the same
mobile station, either directly or after first having cancelled the previous
PS Handover Required procedure by initiating the PS Handover Cancel procedure
with the value for the _Cause_ IE set to \"T12 expiry\".
NOTE: For the case of DTM Handover, the abnormal condition caused by the
expiry of BSSMAP timer T23 is described in 3GPP TS 48.008.
## 8a.5 PS Handover Request procedure
The SGSN shall initiate the PS Handover Request procedure by sending a PS-
HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU, including the NAS container for PS Handover
corresponding to the PFCs to be set-up (except in the case of intra-SGSN PS
handover), to the target BSS and starting timer T13. The PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST
PDU shall be sent on the point-to-point BVC indicated by the target Cell
identity received from the old system.
On receipt of a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU containing a _CS Indication_ IE (i.e.
a DTM Handover procedure is ongoing), then the target BSS shall proceed as
follows:
\- If the timer T24 (see 3GPP TS 48.008) is not running, then the target BSS
shall start timer T24.
\- When both PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU and BSSMAP HANDOVER REQUEST messages have
been received and the contents of the _CS Indication_ IE and _PS Indication_
IE are identical, the target BSS shall stop timer T24 (see 3GPP TS 48.008),
and, provided that a dedicated resource has been allocated (see 3GPP TS
48.008), attempt to create a new BSS Context for the MS, create PFCs according
to the received ABQP parameters and allocate TBF resources within the
capabilities of the mobile station.
On receipt of a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU which does not contain a _CS
Indication_ IE, the target BSS shall create a new BSS Context for the MS,
create PFCs according to the received ABQP parameters and allocate TBFs for
uplink and, if needed, for downlink transmission.
The SGSN may include the _Service UTRAN CCO_ (Cell Change Order) information
element in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU (relevant if the network initiated cell
change order to UTRAN, network intitiated cell change order to E-UTRAN,PS
handover to UTRAN or PS Handover to E-UTRAN procedures are used). If this
information element is received in multiple PDUs (either DL-UNITDATA PDU(s),
CREATE-BSS-PFC PDU(s) or PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU(s)), the information element
contained in the last received PDU shall take precedence.
The SGSN receiving the _Reliable Inter RAT Handover Info_ IE in the PS-
HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU shall forward this IE to the target BSS in the PS-
HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU.
The Packet Flow Timer (PFT) is provided to the target BSS by the SGSN for each
corresponding PFC. It is defined as the maximum time the BSS may hold the PFC
during periods of inactivity for a PFC. The timer is started upon the
initiation of the PS Handover Complete procedure (see sub-clause 8a.7) and
restarted after the transmission of an uplink PDU for that PFC. The timer is
also restarted upon the transfer of the corresponding PFC from an old to a new
cell.
When resources have been successfully allocated by the target BSS, it shall
send a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK PDU to the SGSN. From this point in time, the
target BSS shall be prepared to receive downlink LLC PDUs for the
corresponding MS on the allocated resources. The target BSS shall also be
prepared to receive uplink RLC data blocks or a PS HANDOVER ACCESS message
upon successful MS access in the target cell (as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060).
The PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK PDU shall include the _Target BSS to Source BSS
Transparent Container_ IE (see sub-clause 11.3.79) which contains either a
complete PS HANDOVER COMMAND message or, in the case of DTM Handover, a
complete DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message. For the definition of the PS HANDOVER
COMMAND and DTM HANDOVER COMMAND messages, see 3GPP TS 44.060. In addition,
the BSS shall include in the _Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container_
IE the _SI/PSI Container_ IE (see sub-clause 11.3.95b) if the _PS Handover
Indications_ IE indicating \"SI/PSI requested\" was present in the _Source BSS
to Target BSS Transparent Container_ of the incoming PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU.
In the case where the target cell supports network sharing and the MS Radio
Access Capability information element included in the Source BSS to Target BSS
Transparent Container received in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU indicates MS
supporting network sharing , the target BSS shall include in the SI/PSI
messages sent to the source BSS (if included in the Target BSS to Source BSS
Transparent Container) the same PLMN ID as the one receieved in the _Target
Cell Identifier_ IE in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU.
Upon reception of the PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK PDU, the SGSN shall stop timer
T13, end the PS Handover Request procedure and start timer T14 for supervision
of the PS Handover Complete procedure.
The target BSS may choose to terminate the PS Handover Request procedure by
sending a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-NACK PDU to the SGSN due to any of the following
reasons:
\- A BSS Context could not be allocated for the MS;
\- None of the PFCs in the _PFCs To Be Set-up List_ IE of the PS-HANDOVER-
REQUEST PDU could be granted the requested QoS;
\- No uplink TBF could be allocated for the MS in the BVCI.
In addition, the target BSS may choose to terminate the PS Handover Request
procedure by sending a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-NACK PDU to the SGSN if at least
one of the PFCs in the _PFCs To Be Set-up List_ IE of the PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST
PDU could not be granted the requested QoS and the _Cause_ IE indicates a non-
critical PS or DTM handover.
NOTE: The cause values \"Better cell\", \"Traffic\" indicate a non-critical PS
or DTM handover.
When a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-NACK PDU has been sent, no knowledge of the MS
should be kept by the target BSS.
Except in case of an attempted DTM Handover, when the target BSS decides to
terminate the PS Handover Request procedure by sending a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-
NACK PDU to the SGSN, the _Cause_ IE should be set to an appropriate value
(e.g. \"PFC create failure\", \"Cell traffic congestion\", \"Equipment
failure\" or \"O&M intervention\").
In the case of an attempted DTM Handover, if the target BSS has failed to
allocate PS resources, it shall send a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-NACK PDU with cause
\"DTM Handover - PS Allocation failure\" to the SGSN. The target BSS may
continue with the corresponding Handover Resource Allocation procedure,
allocating only a dedicated resource (see 3GPP TS 48.008).
In the case of an attempted DTM Handover, if the target BSS does not allocate
a CS resource, it shall not allocate any PS resources, and shall send a PS-
HANDOVER-REQUEST-NACK PDU with cause \"DTM Handover - No CS resource\" to the
SGSN.
The SGSN may inform the BSS about the contents of SPID in the PS-HANDOVER-
REQUEST PDU. In this case the SPID is stored in the BSS.
### 8a.5.1 Abnormal conditions
If there is no response from the target BSS to the PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU
before timer T13 expires, the SGSN shall initiate the Delete BSS PFC procedure
for each of the PFCs in the _PFCs to be Set-up List_ IE for the corresponding
MS.
If the timer T24 (see 3GPP TS 48.008) expires and the target BSS has received
a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU (i.e. no corresponding BSSMAP HANDOVER REQUEST
message has been received) the target BSS shall terminate the PS Handover
Request procedure by sending a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-NACK PDU to the SGSN with
cause \"DTM Handover - T24 expiry\".
If a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU is received which contains a _CS Indication_ IE
which corresponds to a DTM Handover attempt which was previously terminated
for this MS, then the BSS shall terminate the PS Handover Request procedure by
sending a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-NACK PDU to the SGSN with cause \"DTM Handover -
Invalid CS Indication IE\". Any ongoing Handover Resource Allocation procedure
(see 3GPP TS 48.008) for this mobile shall not be aborted in this case.
NOTE: Other failure cases related to the expiry of the A interface timer T24
are described in 3GPP TS 48.008).
If timer T14 expires before the SGSN receives a PS-HANDOVER-COMPLETE PDU, it
shall initiate the Delete BSS PFC procedure for each allocated PFC (i.e. for
each PFC included in the _List of Set-up_ _PFCs_ IE in the corresponding PS-
HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK PDU) towards the target BSS to release the resources
allocated for all PFCs allocated for the MS.
## 8a.6 PS Handover Complete procedure
The target BSS shall initiate the PS Handover Complete procedure:
\- in the case of PS Handover, on reception of the first correct RLC data
block (sent in normal burst format as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060) from the MS
in the target Cell;
\- in the case of DTM Handover, on receipt of an RR HANDOVER COMPLETE message
on the main DCCH in the target cell (see 3GPP TS 44.018).
The target BSS shall send a PS-HANDOVER-COMPLETE PDU to the SGSN.
From this point in time, the target BSS shall be prepared to receive uplink
LLC PDUs from the corresponding MS on the allocated resources. Uplink LLC PDUs
shall be sent from the target BSS to the SGSN with the TLLI received through
the PS Handover Request procedure.
The target BSS supporting inter-RAT PS handover to UTRAN shall request the
_Inter RAT Handover Info_ IE from the SGSN upon successful PS handover
completion in the following cases:
\- PS handover from UTRAN to GERAN; in this case the BSS shall replace the
_Inter RAT Handover Info_ received from the source RNC with the new value
received from the SGSN in the PS-HANDOVER-COMPLETE-ACK PDU.
\- PS handover from GERAN _A/Gb mode_ if it received PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU
with _Reliable Inter RAT Handover Info_ IE missing or set to \"0\"; in this
case the BSS shall replace the _Inter RAT Handover Info_ received from the
source BSS with the new value received from the SGSN in the PS-HANDOVER-
COMPLETE-ACK PDU.
\- PS handover from GERAN _A/Gb mode_ if the _\"INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO\"_ is
missing in the _Source BSS to Target BSS Transparent Container_ IE.
\- PS handover from E-UTRAN if the _\"INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO\"_ is missing in
the _Source BSS to Target BSS Transparent Container_ IE.
At reception of the PS-HANDOVER-COMPLETE PDU, the SGSN shall stop timer T14
(if running) and
\- in case of non-optimised intra-BSS or intra-SGSN inter-BSS PS Handover,
initiate the Delete BSS PFC procedure(s) towards the source BSS for each PFC
corresponding to the MS in the source cell as described in sub-clause 8a.3; or
\- in case of inter-SGSN PS Handover, send a Forward Relocation Complete
message to the old SGSN (see 3GPP TS 29.060). The old SGSN shall initiate a
Delete BSS PFC procedure for each PFC corresponding to the MS in the source
cell towards the source BSS as described in sub-clause 8a.3.
### 8a.6.1 Abnormal conditions
If the SGSN does not receive a PS-HANDOVER-COMPLETE PDU before timer T14
expires, it shall initiate the Delete BSS PFC procedure towards the target BSS
to release the resources for all PFCs allocated for the MS.
If a PS-HANDOVER-COMPLETE PDU refers to an MS which is unknown in the SGSN, it
shall be ignored.
## 8a.7 PS Handover Cancel procedure
The source BSS may at any time, up to the time when the PS HANDOVER COMMAND or
DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message is sent to the MS (as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060),
initiate the PS Handover Cancel procedure. The reasons for cancellation could
e.g. be \"T12 expiry\", \"MS back on old channel\", \"Not all requested PFCs
created\" or \"CS cause\".
The source BSS shall initiate the PS Handover Cancel procedure if the cell
change attempt fails and the MS returns to the old cell and sends either a
PACKET CELL CHANGE FAILURE message as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 (for PS
Handover) or an RR HANDOVER FAILURE message as specified in 3GPP TS 44.018
(for DTM Handover) using the old radio resources.
During the normal intra-BSS or inter-BSS PS Handover, the source BSS shall
also initiate the PS Handover Cancel procedure if it detects the loss of radio
contact with MS (see 3GPP TS 44.060).The cause value in the PS-HANDOVER-CANCEL
PDU shall be set to \"Radio contact lost with MS\". In the case of DTM
Handover, the source BSS shall initiate the PS Handover Cancel procedure in
the following additional cases defined in the list of Abnormal Cases for the
Handover Required Indication procedure (see 3GPP TS 48.008):
a) Timer T23 expires and the source BSS has received a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-
ACK PDU from the SGSN;
b) The source BSS receives a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-ACK PDU and a BSSMAP
HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT message (see 3GPP TS 48.008);
c) If the DTM Handover is ongoing and T8 expires (see 3GPP TS 48.008).
The cause value in the PS-HANDOVER-CANCEL PDU shall be set to:
in case a) above: \"DTM Handover - T23 expiry\";
in case b) above: \"DTM Handover - MSC error\";
in case c) above: \"Radio contact lost with MS\".
When the source BSS decides to cancel an ongoing PS handover or DTM Handover,
it shall initiate the PS Handover Cancel procedure by sending a PS-HANDOVER-
CANCEL PDU to the SGSN. The source BSS shall regard all procedures related to
PS handover or DTM Handover for the given MS as terminated after having sent
the PS-HANDOVER-CANCEL PDU to the SGSN.
Upon reception of a PS-HANDOVER-CANCEL PDU, (in the case of Inter-SGSN PS
handover or Inter-SGSN DTM handover) the SGSN shall initiate a Forward
Relocation Cancel procedure according to 3GPP TS 29.060.
Upon reception of a PS-HANDOVER-CANCEL PDU, (in the case of Intra-SGSN PS
handover or Intra-SGSN DTM handover or Inter-RAT PS handover) the SGSN shall
\- in case of GERAN _A/Gb mode_ to GERAN _A/Gb mode_ PS/DTM handover, initiate
the Delete BSS PFC procedure towards the target BSS to release the resource
allocated for the MS.
\- in case of GERAN _A/Gb mode_ to UTRAN PS/DTM handover, initiate the Iu
Release procedure towards the target RNC to release the resource allocated for
the UE (see 3GPP TS 25.413).
\- in case of GERAN _A/Gb mode_ to E-UTRAN PS handover, initiate the
Relocation Cancel procedure towards target MME which initiates the release of
the resources allocated for the UE by the target eNB (see 3GPP TS 36.413).
NOTE: In case of cancellation due to CS call establishment, current behaviour
regarding possible suspension of GPRS services applies after the PS Handover
Cancel procedure is completed.
### 8a.7.1 Abnormal conditions
If a PS-HANDOVER-CANCEL PDU refers to an MS/UE which is unknown in the SGSN,
it shall be ignored.
An SGSN shall ignore a PS-HANDOVER-CANCEL PDU which refers to an MS for which
the SGSN has already received a PS-HANDOVER-COMPLETE PDU from the target BSS
(in the case of intra-SGSN PS handover) or a FORWARD RELOCATION COMPLETE
message from the new SGSN (in the case of inter-SGSN PS handover).
# 8b Signalling Procedures between LCS SAPs
## 8b.1 Location Procedure
When the SGSN receives a location request, and the BSS supports LCS, the SGSN
starts the location procedure by sending a PERFORM-LOCATION-REQUEST PDU. An
exception case is when the SGSN supports the MTA procedure and receives a
location request (i.e. a "MAP Provide Subscriber Location" message is received
from the GMLC) for a MS that supports the MTA procedure (determined by the MS
Radio Access Capability of the target MS \-- see sub-clause 11.3.22) in which
case it shall proceed as follows:
\- If the MPM timer is running for the target MS (see sub-clause 8b.2.1) it
shall send a system failure indication to the corresponding GMLC.
\- If the MPM timer is not running but the Ready timer is running for the
target MS the SGSN sends a PERFORM-LOCATION-REQUEST PDU to the BSS managing
the serving cell.
\- If neither the MPM nor Ready timer is running, the SGSN sends a PAGING-PS
PDU indicating 'positioning event triggered' (see sub-clause 10.3.1) to each
BSS in the set of BSSs managing cells in the paging area corresponding to the
target MS and waits for a page response as described in sub-clause 7.1.
The SGSN shall provide the BVCI and the NSEI indicating the PTP functional
entity (i.e. the cell) upon which the last LLC-PDU was received from the MS as
well as the Cell ID received together with that LLC-PDU. The SGSN shall also
provide the IMSI. If the SGSN has valid DRX Parameters for a TLLI, then the
SGSN shall include them in the PDU. If the SGSN has valid eDRX Parameters for
a TLLI, then the SGSN shall include them in the PDU. The SGSN shall also
provide the downlink Coverage Class associated with the MS, if previously
received from the BSS in the UL-UNITDATA PDU.
If LLC ciphering is not activated at SGSN, SGSN may include "MTA Access
Security Required" in the PERFORM LOCATION REQUEST PDU, if integrity
protection for the radio access part of the MTA procedure is required. BSS
upon receipt of this IE shall request SMLC to perform the location request.
The "MTA Access Security Required" may indicate MTA Access Security method or
the BSS Duplication Detection method is to be performed. For the case where
the MTA Access Security method is performed, on receipt of "MTA Signature" and
"MTA Sequence" included in the response sent by SMLC to BSS, the BSS forwards
them to SGSN in PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE-PDU as "MTA Signature" IE and "MTA
Sequence" IE. SGSN upon receiving PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE-PDU checks the
presence of "MTA Signature" and "MTA Sequence ", and if present, generates a
local MTA Signature using "MTA Sequence". The generated local MTA Signature is
then compared against received "MTA Signature".
If MS Radio Access Capability information is available in the SGSN for the
associated MS, the SGSN shall include it in the PERFORM-LOCATION-REQUEST PDU.
The Location Type indicates which type of location information the SGSN is
requesting. The LCS capability IE reports the PS LCS capabilities of the MS
and is included by the SGSN if it has been received from the MS. LCS Priority
and LCS QoS are provided if available in the SGSN. The SGSN may provide the
IMEI of the Mobile Station.
On receipt of the PERFORM-LOCATION-REQUEST PDU for positioning of the target
MS, the BSS transfers the positioning request to the SMLC according to the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 43.059 and 3GPP TS 49.031 and awaits the result.
An exception case is when the BSS receives a PERFORM-LOCATION-REQUEST PDU for
which the "MultilaterationTiming Advance", "MS Sync Accuracy" and "BTS
Reception Accuracy Level" information elements are included in which case the
BSS proceeds as follows:
\- If a packet data transfer is ongoing for the target MS (see 3GPP TS 44.018
[25]) the BSS waits for up to 5 seconds for the packet data transfer to
complete (i.e. all TBF resources are released) before sending a positioning
request to the SMLC (see 3GPP TS 43.059 and 3GPP TS 49.031).
\- Upon completing the ongoing packet data transfer (within 5 seconds) or if
no packet resources are assigned upon receiving the PERFORM-LOCATION-REQUEST
PDU the BSS sends a positioning request to the SMLC, includes the
"MultilaterationTiming Advance", "MS Sync Accuracy" and "BTS Reception
Accuracy Level" information elements therein and awaits the positioning
result.
\- If packet resources remain assigned for more than 5 seconds after receiving
the PERFORM-LOCATION-REQUEST PDU the BSS returns a PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE
PDU with a LCS cause value indicating 'Target MS Unreachable' (see sub-clause
11.3.58) and aborts the Location procedure.
The BSS then returns the result of positioning to the SGSN in the PERFORM-
LOCATION-RESPONSE PDU and stops the MPM Timer (if running). This PDU contains
the PTP BVCI indicating the PTP functional entity (i.e. the cell) upon which
the last LLC-PDU was received from the MS, a location estimate and optionally
positioning data. Upon reception of the PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE PDU the SGSN
stops the MPM timer (if running).
If assistance data was instead requested by the SGSN for an MS, the BSS
transfers the request to the SMLC according to the procedures defined in 3GPP
TS 43.059 and 3GPP TS 49.031 and awaits the result. If the Requested GPS or
GANSS Assistance Data IE was received from the MS, it is forwarded to the BSS.
If the SMLC indicates to the BSS that it was able successfully to transfer
this to the MS, the BSS shall return a PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE PDU to the
SGSN. This PDU shall contain the PTP BVCI indicating the PTP functional entity
(i.e. the cell) upon which the last LLC-PDU was received from the MS but no
other optional or conditional information elements. The absence of an LCS
Cause parameter in this case implies that the transfer was successful.
Otherwise, if the deciphering keys were requested for LCS broadcast assistance
data, the BSS transfers the request to the SMLC according to the procedures
defined in 3GPP TS 43.059 and 3GPP TS 49.031 and awaits the result. If the BSS
receives the deciphering keys, the BSS shall send them to the SGSN in a
PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE PDU containing also the PTP BVCI indicating the PTP
functional entity (i.e. the cell) upon which the last LLC-PDU was received
from the MS.
### 8b.1.1 Unsuccessful Operation
If the BSS fails to respond to the PERFORM-LOCATION-REQUEST PDU it returns a
PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE PDU with a LCS cause value indicating the failure
cause.
If the BSS receives a failure indication from the SMLC it shall send a
PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE PDU to the SGSN with the LCS cause value that it
received from the SMLC and stop the MPM timer (if running). Upon reception of
the PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE PDU the SGSN shall stop the MPM timer (if
running).
### 8b.1.2 Abnormal Conditions
The following condition may occur:
If the SGSN needs to abort previously initiated location request, it shall
send the PERFORM-LOCATION-ABORT PDU to the BSS. This PDU shall include the PTP
BVCI indicating the PTP functional entity (i.e. the cell) upon which the last
LLC-PDU was received from the MS. As a result of reception of this PDU the BSS
shall abort activities related to positioning of the target MS or assistance
data delivery. The BSS shall return a PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE PDU with a
cause value indicating the abortion of location request. The SGSN may
reattempt the positioning request after the PERFORM-LOCATION-RESPONSE PDU is
received from the BSS, but not before the PDU is received.
If the P-TMSI is reallocated for a target MS during the location procedure,
the SGSN shall abort the location procedure.
If a SUSPEND PDU is received for a target MS during the location procedure,
the SGSN shall abort the location procedure.
If a Routing Area Update request is received from a target MS during the
location procedure, the SGSN shall abort the location procedure.
If an Inter NSE Cell Change, within the same routing area, occurs for a target
MS during the location procedure, the SGSN shall provide the new NSEI and new
BVCI in the FLUSH-LL PDU sent to the BSS, in order for the BSS to maintain the
on-going location procedure, if possible. In case the BSS is unable to
maintain the on-going location procedure, then a location abort shall be
triggered by the BSS towards the SMLC.
### 8b.1.3 Overload
For location requests initiated by the SGSN, the BSC may employ the same
procedures defined for an SMLC in 3GPP TS 49.031 to alleviate an overload
condition in the BSS.
## 8b.2 Position Command Procedure
The position command procedure is used to convey an embedded RRLP message
between the BSS and the MS.
### 8b.2.1 Position Command
The BSS initiates the position command procedure by sending the POSTION-
COMMAND PDU to the SGSN. The procedure is only valid while a location
procedure for the target MS is ongoing.
The POSITION-COMMAND PDU shall include the RRLP Flags and the RRLP APDU
information elements and the PTP BVCI indicating the PTP functional entity
(i.e. the cell) upon which the last LLC-PDU was received from the MS. The RRLP
APDU information element carries the RRLP message and the RRLP Flags
information element carries control information for RRLP.
The SGSN shall extract the RRLP message from the RRLP APDU information element
and forward it, together with the RRLP Flags, to the MS in a TOM message
carried in an LLC-PDU, see 3GPP TS 44.064.
An exception case is when the POSITION-COMMAND PDU contains the
Multilateration Timer IE (i.e. the MTA procedure has been selected by the
SMLC, see sub-clause 11.3.136) and the SGSN determines that it has neither
coverage class nor eDRX information available for the target MS. In this case
the SGSN sends a POSITION-RESPONSE PDU to the BSS with a 'LCS cause' value
indicating 'Target MS Unreachable' (see sub-clause 11.3.58) and aborts the
Location procedure. Otherwise, the SGSN proceeds as follows:
\- A MPM timer is started for the target MS and the SGSN shall not attempt to
deliver downlink data to that MS or page that MS for as long as the MPM timer
continues to run.
\- The DL-UNITDATA PDU used to relay the RRLP message to the BSS includes a
Timing Advance Request IE (see sub-clause 10.2.1) if the POSITION-COMMAND PDU
includes a Timing Advance Request IE (see sub-clause 10.5.4) indicating that
timing advance information is needed.
If an UL-UNITDATA PDU is sent from the BSS to the SGSN for the target MS when
a corresponding MPM timer is running then both the BSS and SGSN shall stop
their respective MPM timers and abort the location procedure for that MS.
### 8b.2.2 Position Response
The SGSN initiates the position response procedure when it receives a TOM
message in an LLC-PDU carrying an RRLP message for a target MS. The procedure
is only valid while a location procedure for the target MS is ongoing.
When the SGSN receives a TOM message in an LLC-PDU carrying an RRLP message
for a target MS, the SGSN shall extract the RRLP message and forward it to the
BSS in a POSITION-RESPONSE PDU. The RRLP message shall be included in the RRLP
APDU information element. The RRLP Flags information shall be extracted from
the TOM header and be included in the RRLP Flags information element The
POSITION-RESPONSE PDU shall also include the PTP BVCI indicating the PTP
functional entity (i.e. the cell) upon which the last LLC-PDU was received
from the MS.
### 8b.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
If the SGSN fails to process the POSITION-COMMAND PDU it returns a POSITION-
RESPONSE PDU with a LCS cause value indicating the failure cause.
If a POSITION-COMMAND PDU is received by the SGSN while a location procedure
for the target MS is not ongoing a POSITION-RESPONSE PDU with a LCS cause
value indicating this failure cause is returned.
If a POSITION-RESPONSE PDU is received by the BSS while a location procedure
for the target MS is not ongoing the BSS shall ignore the PDU.
# 8c Signalling procedures between RIM SAPs
## 8c.1 General
### 8c.1.1 Introduction
The following sub-clauses describe the generic RAN Information Management
(RIM) procedures which support the exchange of information, via the core
network, between peer application entities located in a GERAN, in a UTRAN, in
an E-UTRAN or in an eHRPD evolved access network.
The RIM function is performed through the interaction of the following sub-
layers:
\- the underlying part of BSSGP used to transport and route the RIM PDUs from
a BSS to an SGSN or from an SGSN to a BSS over the Gb interface;
\- the RIM protocol allowing the exchange of the information between two BSSs
or between a BSS and an RNS or between a BSS and an eNodeB or between an
eNodeB and an eHRPD eAN transparently through the core network;
\- the application part on the top of the RIM protocol, referred to as the
\"RIM application\" in this specification.
NOTE: The functional split between the RIM application and the RIM protocol is
provided for information in the present specification and should allow for
various implementations.
The PDUs conveying the RAN information between two RIM entities are including
containers that shall not be interpreted by the core network nodes. The
exchange of information is triggered by the application in a controlling BSS
or, in the case of the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure (see 3GPP TS
43.059 [23]), by the originating BSS.
The support of different applications is achieved by the appropriate
definition of specific application containers for those applications.
If the RAN Information Management (RIM) feature is supported by both the BSS
and the SGSN, the RIM procedures can be used by any RIM application running on
this BSS and requiring information transfer between two BSSs via the core
network.
NOTE: Specific requirements applicable to RIM between GERAN and UTRAN or
between GERAN and E-UTRAN and between E-UTRAN and eHRPD eAN are specified in
sub-clause 8c.1.4.
### 8c.1.2 Definitions
#### 8c.1.2.1 Controlling, serving, originating and receiving nodes
The BSS requesting the information is called the \"controlling BSS\", the BSS
providing the requested information is called the \"serving BSS\". Considering
a pair of BSSs, each may be at the same time both a controlling BSS and a
serving BSS. An exception is when an application uses the RIM procedure to
transfer information related to the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure
(see 3GPP TS 43.059 [23]) in which case the BSS receiving the information is
called the "receiving BSS" and the BSS autonomously providing the information
is called the "originating BSS".
In the present specification the term \"BSS\" should be understood as \"RNC,
eNodeB or eAN\" in the relevant situations (e. g. NACC from UTRAN/E-UTRAN to
GERAN), unless it is explicitly stated otherwise.
#### 8c.1.2.2 RIM association
A RIM association links unambiguously either a cell in the serving BSS with
the controlling BSS that has initiated an information request related to that
cell for a given application, or a cell in the controlling BSS with the
serving BSS that receives the RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU for a given
application, and is identified by the following pieces of information:
\- Controlling BSS identifier, or, for some particular values of the SON
Transfer Application Identity for which the Reporting Cell Identifier is a
cell in the controlling BSS (see TS 36.413 [36]), the serving BSS identifier.
\- Cell Identifier in the serving BSS, or, for some particular values of the
SON Transfer Application Identity (see TS 36.413 [36]), Cell Identifier in the
controlling BSS.
> \- RIM Application Identity
>
> \- SON Transfer Application Identity (only applicable if the RIM Application
> Identity indicates \"SON Transfer\").
#### 8c.1.2.3 RIM variables
In this protocol description, variables are used to represent the status of
the relevant entity as a result of an event, such as the reception of an
information element in a message. The variables serve the purpose of
specifying an abstract model of the protocol entity, and do not therefore
impose any particular implementation.
The following variables are defined in the serving BSS:
\- MULTIPLE_REPORTING_ONGOING: this variable indicates whether event-based
multiple reporting is active or not for a given RIM association. This variable
is initialised to FALSE prior to the reception of any request related to the
corresponding association from the controlling BSS, then it is updated
according to the relevant procedure requirements.
\- MULTIPLE_REPORT_SETTING_RSN: this variable stores the RSN of the last
request having initiated or re-initiated multiple reporting in the serving BSS
and is used as a reference to ascertain whether any further request received
for this association is outdated or not. The value of this variable is only
significant when multiple reporting is active (i.e. MULTIPLE_REPORTING_ONGOING
set to TRUE).
### 8c.1.3 RIM PDUs description
#### 8c.1.3.1 RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU
The RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU is used by the controlling BSS to request or
interrupt an information transfer from a serving BSS. The RAN-INFORMATION-
REQUEST PDU specifies the requested operation and the expected information
when applicable. The following RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU type extensions are
defined:
\- RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST/Single Report is used to request a single report.
\- RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST/Multiple Report is used to request event-driven
multiple reports.
\- RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST/Stop is used to stop event-driven multiple reports.
#### 8c.1.3.2 RAN-INFORMATION PDU
The RAN-INFORMATION PDU is used by the serving BSS to transmit the requested
information to the controlling BSS or by the originating BSS to autonomously
send Multilateration Timing Advance (see 3GPP TS 43.059 [23]) related
information to the receiving BSS. The following RAN-INFORMATION PDU type
extensions are defined:
\- RAN-INFORMATION/Single Report is used to acknowledge the reception of a
RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST/Single Report and to transmit the requested single
report information. The RAN-INFORMATION/Single Report is the only RAN-
INFORMATION PDU type extension used to transfer information related to the
Multilateration Timing Advance procedure (see 3GPP TS 43.059 [23]).
\- RAN-INFORMATION/Initial Multiple Report is used to acknowledge the
reception of a RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST/Multiple Report and to transmit the
initial report of the event-driven multiple reporting.
\- RAN-INFORMATION/Multiple Report is used to transmit subsequent reports
while event-driven multiple reporting is active.
\- RAN-INFORMATION/Stop is used to acknowledge the reception of a RAN-
INFORMATION-REQUEST/Stop.
\- RAN-INFORMATION/End is used to indicate that the serving BSS will not
longer send multiple reports for other reasons than the reception of a RAN-
INFORMATION-REQUEST/Stop.
#### 8c.1.3.3 RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU
The RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU is used by the controlling BSS to acknowledge the
reception of a previous RAN-INFORMATION PDU if so requested by the serving BSS
and is used by the serving BSS to acknowledge the reception of a previous RAN-
INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU if so requested by the controlling BSS. The
RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU is also used by the receiving BSS to acknowledge the
reception of a previous RAN-INFORMATION PDU autonomously send by the
originating BSS.
#### 8c.1.3.4 RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU
The RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU is used, by either the controlling, the serving
or the receiving BSS, to report an error diagnosed at the RIM protocol level
to the peer entity.
#### 8c.1.3.5 RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU
The RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU is used by the controlling or the
receiving BSS to inform the peer application in the serving BSS about
erroneous application information in a previously received RAN-INFORMATION
PDU.
### 8c.1.4 RIM addressing and routing principles
#### 8c.1.4.1 RIM routing address
##### 8c.1.4.1.1 GERAN BSS identification
As there is no BSS address identifier defined as such in the 3GPP
specifications, RIM makes use of the cell identifier (RAI + CI - see sub-
clause 11.3.9 in the present document and 3GPP TS 23.003) of any cell parented
by the BSS:
\- the cell identifier of the source cell is used to identify the BSS issuing
a RIM PDU;
\- the cell identifier of the destination cell is used to identify the BSS
towards which a RIM PDU is issued.
The source cell identifying the BSS issuing a RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU may
be chosen arbitrarily within all the cells parented by the controlling BSS.
The deletion or the re-parenting of any cell used as a source cell in the
controlling BSS shall trigger the actions described in sub-clause 8c.5.2.
##### 8c.1.4.1.2 UTRAN RNS identification
When RIM is used to support the exchange of information with a peer
application entity located in UTRAN, the RNC identifier (see sub-clause
11.3.70) shall be used as the RIM Routing Address (Source Cell Identifier or
Destination Cell Identifier) to identify the corresponding RNS.
##### 8c.1.4.1.3 E-UTRAN eNodeB identification
When RIM is used to support the exchange of information with a peer
application entity located in E-UTRAN, an eNB identifier (see sub-clause
11.3.70) shall be used as the RIM Routing Address (Source Cell Identifier or
Destination Cell Identifier) to identify the corresponding eNodeB.
##### 8c.1.4.1.4 eHRPD eAN identification
When RIM is used to support the exchange of information with a peer
application entity located in eHRPD, an _eHRPD Sector ID_ IE (see sub-clause
11.3.70) shall be used as the RIM Routing Address (Source Cell Identifier or
Destination Cell Identifier) to identify the corresponding eHRPD eAN.
#### 8c.1.4.2 Routing via the core network
The RIM PDUs shall be conveyed transparently by the core network toward the
destination BSS, RNS, eNodeB or eHRPD eAN. A SGSN or MME shall use the
destination address included in each RIM PDU either to send the PDU to the
relevant BSS, RNS, eNodeB or eAN through the Gb, the Iu, the S1 or the S121
interface respectively, or to tunnel the PDU towards the target SGSN or MME
parenting the destination node through the Gn or S3 interface respectively.
If a RIM PDU has been tunnelled through the Gn or S3 interface to a
destination SGSN or MME that does not support RIM the PDU is discarded without
further action.
#### 8c.1.4.3 Address mirroring
The following address mirroring principles shall be applied:
\- the serving BSS shall mirror the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE value and the
_Destination Cell Identifier_ IE value of the received RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST
PDU into the _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE and the _Source Cell Identifier_
IE, respectively, of the related RAN-INFORMATION PDU(s);
\- the controlling BSS shall mirror the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE value and
the _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE value of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU to be
acknowledged into the _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE and the _Source Cell
Identifier_ IE, respectively, of the related RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU;
\- the receiving BSS shall mirror the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE value and
the _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE value of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU to be
acknowledged into the _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE and the _Source Cell
Identifier_ IE, respectively, of the related RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU;
\- the BSS having identified an error at the RIM protocol level in a received
RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU, RAN-INFORMATION PDU, RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU or
RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU shall mirror the _Source Cell
Identifier_ IE value and the _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE value of the
erroneous PDU into the _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE and the _Source Cell
Identifier_ IE, respectively, of the RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU;
\- the controlling BSS having identified an error at application level in a
received PDU shall mirror the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE value and the
_Destination Cell Identifier_ IE value of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU which
carried the erroneous application information into the _Destination Cell
Identifier_ IE and the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE, respectively, of the RAN-
INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU.
### 8c.1.5 In-order delivery and reliable transfer - RSN
#### 8c.1.5.1 General
A BSS shall allocate a RIM Sequence Number (RSN) to any RAN-INFORMATION-
REQUEST PDU, RAN-INFORMATION PDU or RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU sent
by this BSS. The purpose of the RSN is twofold:
\- to assess whether a RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU or a RAN-INFORMATION PDU
received for a given RIM association is providing up-to-date information or is
outdated if having been overtaken by a PDU received previously;
\- to identify the PDU acknowledged with a RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU or reported
in a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU.
For the purpose of comparing any RSN value to a given RSN X, the RSN numbering
space is halved in two equal parts (see figure 8c.1) located on either sides
of RSN X, the half part \"below\" RSN X (modulo RSN MAX+1) defining the RSN
values \"older\" than RSN X, the half part \"above\" (modulo RSN MAX+1) RSN X
defining the RSN values \"newer\" than RSN X.
> Figure 8c.1: Comparing RSN values
#### 8c.1.5.2 Allocating RSN values at the sending BSS
The RSN allocated to a RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU, RAN-INFORMATION PDU or
RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU shall be greater (modulo 2**32) than the
RSN value allocated to the previous PDU of the same type sent for this
association. In case a given PDU needs to be resent, this PDU may be re-issued
with either the same RSN value or an increased RSN value (modulo 2**32).
NOTE: The RSN values allocated to two different PDUs sent successively for a
given RIM association need not be consecutive (e.g. the RSN values could be
uniquely allocated for a given application or within the whole BSS). However,
in order to avoid RSN values depletion, the sending BSS should allocate the
next higher RSN value (modulo 2**32) to the next PDU to be sent.
To allow a receiving entity to assess whether two PDUs are received in the
same relative order they have been sent or not, the difference between the RSN
values allocated to those two PDUs should not exceed an RSN window size of
2**31 (see sub-clause 8c.1.5.3).
NOTE: In order to cope with RSN values outside the RSN window for a given RIM
association, the relevant RIM procedures might be triggered on a timely basis
for advancing the RSN window.
#### 8c.1.5.3 Comparing RSN values at the receiving BSS
Let PDU1 and PDU2 be two PDUs received at the BSS and related to the same RIM
association, PDU1 is considered as having been sent earlier than PDU2 if the
difference between the associated RSNs is less than an RSN window size of
2**31 (see sub-clause 8c.1.5.2), i.e.:
(RSN2 - RSN1) mod (2**32) \ set the content of the RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST/Single Report PDU as

Fig 8c.2.3: Acknowledged Autonomous RAN Information Send procedure
#### 8c.2.3a.1 Initiation by the originating BSS
This RIM procedure is used for sending Multilateration Timing Advance related
information from an originating BSS to a receiving BSS.
The autonomous RAN Information Send procedure is initiated by the application
in the originating BSS when it realizes there is multilaration related
information to be sent (using the RAN-INFORMATION/Single Report PDU) and it
has not triggered the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure (see 3GPP TS
43.059 [23]).
Upon initiation of the procedure, the originating BSS shall:
1\. set the content of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU as follows:
a. set the _PDU type_ IE, the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE value and the
_Destination Cell Identifier_ IE value where the _Destination Cell Identifier_
IE corresponds to the 8 octet _Source Identity IE (Cell Identity+Routing Area
Identity)_ received in an uplink RLC data block as part of a Multilateration
Timing Advance procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [22];
b. set the content of the _RIM Container_ IE as follows:
i set the _RIM Application Identity_ IE and the _RIM Sequence Number_ IE;
ii set the _RIM Protocol Version Number_ IE if necessary (see sub-clause
8c.1.6)
iii set the _PDU Type Extension_ field in the _RIM PDU Indications_ IE to

iv for a RAN-INFORMATION/Single Report PDU, set the _ACK_ indicator to \"ACK
requested\";
v set the _Application Container_ IE according to the requirements of the
Multilateration Timing Advance application (see sub-clause 11.3.63.2.6);
2\. send the RAN-INFORMATION PDU;
3\. if the _ACK_ indicator has been set to \"ACK requested\", start a T(RI)
instance for this RAN-INFORMATION PDU;
4\. otherwise the procedure ends.
#### 8c.2.3a.2 Reception of a valid RAN-INFORMATION PDU by the receiving BSS
Upon reception of a valid RAN-INFORMATION/Single Report the receiving BSS
shall:
1\. deliver the relevant information to the application;
a) if the _ACK_ indicator in the _RIM PDU Indications_ IE included in the RIM
container of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU is set to \"ACK requested\", the
receiving BSS shall:
2\. set the content of the RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU as follows:
i set the _PDU type_ IE; mirror the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE value and the
_Destination Cell Identifier_ IE value of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU respectively
into the _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE and the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE
of the RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU;
ii set the content of the _RIM Container_ IE as follows:
ii.1 mirror the _RIM Sequence Number_ IE value and the _RIM Application
Identity_ IE value included in the RIM container of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU
respectively into the _RIM Sequence Number_ IE and the _RIM Application
Identity_ IE of the RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU;

3\. send the RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU.
b) otherwise, the procedure ends.
#### 8c.2.3a.3 Reception of a valid RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU in the originating
BSS
Upon reception of a valid RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU as defined in sub-clause
8c.3.2 the originating BSS shall:
1\. if the _RIM Sequence Number_ IE value contained in the RAN-INFORMATION-ACK
PDU matches the RSN of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU having initiated the procedure

#### 8c.2.3.1 Initiation by the serving BSS
If multiple reporting has been requested for a given RIM association (i.e. the
MULTIPLE_REPORTING_ONGOING variable is set to TRUE), the RAN Information Send
procedure is initiated by the application in the serving BSS either to send
updated information (using the RAN-INFORMATION/Multiple Report PDU) or to
indicate that multiple reporting has been deactivated on the serving BSS side
(using the RAN-INFORMATION/End PDU).
Upon initiation of the procedure, the serving BSS shall:
1> set the content of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU as follows:
2> set the _PDU type_ IE, mirror the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE value and the
_Destination Cell Identifier_ IE value of the RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST/Multiple

1> if the _RIM Sequence Number_ IE value contained in the RAN-INFORMATION-ACK
PDU matches the RSN of the RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU having
initiated the procedure
2> then stop the T(RIAE) instance corresponding to the acknowledged PDU;
1> else discard the PDU without further action;
and the procedure ends.
#### 8c.2.4.4 Expiration of T(RIAE) in the controlling or receiving BSS
At the expiration of the T(RIAE) instance corresponding to the RAN-
INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU sent previously by the controlling or
receiving BSS, the controlling or receiving BSS shall, as an implementation
option, either inform the application that the procedure has failed or restart
the RAN Information Application Error procedure a finite number of times as
described in sub-clause 8c.2.4.1.
### 8c.2.5 RAN Information Error procedure
Fig 8c.2.5: RAN Information Error procedure
The RAN Information Error procedure is initiated by the RIM in the source BSS
(controlling originating, receiving or serving) to transfer error information
to the RIM entity in the associated BSS.
The procedure is described in sub-clause 8c.3.4.
## 8c.3 Abnormal conditions
### 8c.3.0 General
Two levels of abnormal conditions are defined for the RIM function:
\- the abnormal conditions encountered at the BSSGP level as described in sub-
clause 8c.3.1, affecting the routing mechanisms and the related IEs in the RIM
PDUs;
\- the abnormal conditions encountered in the RIM container as described in
sub-clauses 8c.3.2 and 8c.3.3.
The errors encountered in the application container are handled by the
application and are made known to the peer application entity by including the
_Application Error container_ IE.
### 8c.3.1 Abnormal conditions at the BSSGP level
#### 8c.3.1.1 General
The general protocol error handling as defined in section 9 applies.
However, the RIM containers being defined as general containers for passing
field elements transparently between BSSs via the core network are not subject
to error handling at the BSSGP level but only at the RIM protocol level (see
sub-clause 8c.3.2).
Additionally the abnormal conditions defined in the following sub-clauses
apply.
#### 8c.3.1.2 RIM addressing error in BSS
If a BSS receives from an SGSN a RIM PDU with a _Destination Cell Identifier_
IE value which does not match the cell identifier of any of its parented
cells, the PDU shall be discarded and a STATUS PDU with the cause value set to
\"Unknown Destination address\" shall be sent back to the SGSN.
#### 8c.3.1.3 RIM addressing error in the CN
If an SGSN receives from a BSS a RIM PDU with an invalid destination address,
the PDU shall be discarded and a STATUS PDU with the cause value set to
\"Unknown Destination address\" shall be sent back to the BSS.
#### 8c.3.1.4 RIM PDU addressed to a BSS not supporting RIM
If an SGSN receives a RIM PDU addressed to a parented BSS that does not
support the RIM procedures, the PDU shall be discarded without further action.
### 8c.3.2 Abnormal conditions encountered in the RIM container

REQUEST PDU, RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU or RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU
contains an unknown value in the _RIM Application Identity_ IE, or if the RIM
container contains an unknown value in the _SON Transfer Application Identity_
IE in case the _RIM Application Identity_ IE is set to \"SON Transfer\", or if
the RIM application is disabled when receiving a RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU,
the BSS shall send a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU with the _RIM Cause_ IE set to
\"Unknown RIM Application Identity or RIM application disabled\" back to the
originating BSS (see sub-clause 8c.3.4.2) and discard the received PDU.
If the RIM container included in a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU contains an
unknown value in the _RIM Application Identity_ IE, or if the RIM container
contains an unknown value in the _SON Transfer Application Identity_ IE in
case the _RIM Application Identity_ IE is set to \"SON Transfer\", the BSS
shall discard the RIM PDU without further action.
#### 8c.3.2.2 Erroneous PDU Type Extension field
If the _PDU Type Extension_ field in the _RIM PDU Indications_ IE included in
the RIM container of a RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU does not indicate \"RAN-
INFORMATION-REQUEST/Multiple Report\", \"RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST/Stop\" or
\"RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST/Single Report\", the serving BSS shall send a RAN-
INFORMATION-ERROR PDU containing the complete received PDU and with the _RIM
Cause_ IE set to \"PDU not compatible with the feature set\" back to the
originating BSS (see sub-clause 8c.3.4.2) and shall discard the received PDU.
If the _PDU Type Extension_ field in the _RIM PDU Indications_ IE included in
the RIM container of a RAN-INFORMATION PDU does not indicate \"RAN-
INFORMATION/Single Report\", \"RAN-INFORMATION/Multiple Report\", \"RAN-
INFORMATION/Initial Multiple Report\", \"RAN-INFORMATION/Stop\" or \"RAN-
INFORMATION/End\", the serving BSS shall send a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU
containing the complete received PDU and with the _RIM Cause_ IE set to \"PDU
not compatible with the feature set\" back to the originating BSS (see sub-
clause 8c.3.4.2) and shall discard the received PDU.
#### 8c.3.2.3 Missing conditional IE
If an expected conditional Information Element is not included in the RIM
container of a RAN-INFORMATION PDU, RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU, RAN-
INFORMATION-ACK PDU or RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU, the BSS shall
send a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU containing the complete received PDU and with
the _RIM Cause_ IE set to \"Missing Conditional IE\" back to the originating
BSS (see sub-clause 8c.3.4.2) and discard the received PDU.
If an expected conditional Information Element is not included in the RIM
container of a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU, the BSS shall discard the received
PDU without further action.
#### 8c.3.2.4 Missing mandatory IE
If a mandatory Information Element is not included in the RIM container of a
RAN-INFORMATION PDU, RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU, RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU or
RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU, the BSS shall send a RAN-INFORMATION-
ERROR PDU containing the complete received PDU and with the _RIM Cause_ IE set
to \"Missing Mandatory IE\" back to the originating BSS (see sub-clause
8c.3.4.2) and discard the received PDU.
If a mandatory Information Element is not included in the RIM container of a
RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU, the BSS shall discard the received PDU without
further action.
#### 8c.3.2.5 Syntactical error in an expected conditional IE
If a syntactical error is detected in an expected conditional Information
Element included in the RIM container of a RAN-INFORMATION PDU, RAN-
INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU, RAN-INFORMATION-ACK PDU or RAN-INFORMATION-
APPLICATION-ERROR PDU, the BSS shall send a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU
containing the complete received PDU and with the _RIM Cause_ IE set to
\"Conditional IE error\" back to the originating BSS (see sub-clause 8c.3.4.2)
and discard the received PDU.
If a syntactical error is detected in an expected conditional Information
Element included in the RIM container of a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU, the BSS
shall discard the received PDU without further action.
#### 8c.3.2.6 Syntactical error in a mandatory IE
> If a syntactical error is detected in a mandatory IE included in the RIM
> container of a RAN-INFORMATION PDU, RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU, RAN-
> INFORMATION-ACK PDU or RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU, the BSS shall
> send a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU containing the complete received PDU and
> with the _RIM Cause_ IE set to \"Invalid mandatory information\" back to the
> originating BSS (see sub-clause 8c.3.4.2) and discard the received PDU.
For this rule the following exceptions apply:
\- unknown _RIM Application Identity_ IE (see sub-clause 8c.3.2.1); or
\- erroneous _PDU Type Extension_ field (see sub-clause 8c.3.2.2)
If a syntactical error is detected in a mandatory IE included in the RIM
container of a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU, the BSS shall discard the received
PDU without further action.
#### 8c.3.2.7 Unexpected conditional IE
If an unexpected conditional Information Element is received in the RIM
container of a RAN-INFORMATION PDU, RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU, RAN-
INFORMATION-ACK PDU or RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR PDU, the BSS shall
send a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU containing the complete received PDU and with
the _RIM Cause_ IE set to \"Unexpected Conditional IE\" back to the
originating BSS (see sub-clause 8c.3.4.2) and discard the received PDU.
If an unexpected conditional Information Element is received in the RIM
container of a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU, the BSS shall discard the received
PDU without further action.
#### 8c.3.2.8 Containers with out-of-sequence information elements
The receiving BSS may accept RIM containers that include information elements
that do not appear to be in the correct sequence. Elements that occur more
than once in a RIM container shall be assumed to have been transmitted in the
correct order. Recipients that do not accept out of sequence information
elements shall regard the RIM container as containing unexpected and/or
missing information elements and follow the procedures defined in the rest of
this sub-clause 8c.3.2.
#### 8c.3.2.9 Container with semantically incorrect content
When any IE with semantically incorrect contents is received within a RIM
container, the receiving BSS shall react according to the relevant protocol
specification. If however no such reactions are specified, the receiving BSS
shall ignore that IE and treat the rest of the RIM container. If the rest of
the RIM container can no longer be handled because this IE was ignored then
the receiving BSS shall send a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU containing the
complete received PDU and with the _RIM Cause_ IE set to \"Semantically
incorrect PDU\" back to the originating BSS (see sub-clause 8c.3.4.2) and
discard the received PDU.
### 8c.3.3 Unexpected RIM PDU
If a BSS receives a RIM PDU in a case not covered by the RIM procedures
specified in sub-clause 8c.2, it shall discard the RIM PDU without further
action.
### 8c.3.4 RIM error reporting
#### 8c.3.4.1 General
A BSS diagnosing any of the abnormal cases identified in sub-clause 8c.3.2 in
a received RIM PDU shall inform the originating BSS by sending in return a
RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU as described in sub-clause 8c.3.4.2.
The tasks to be performed upon reception of the RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU are
described in sub-clause 8c.3.4.3.
#### 8c.3.4.2 Sending of a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU
A BSS receiving an erroneous RIM PDU according to sub-clause 8c.3.2 shall:
1> set the _PDU type_ IE, mirror the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE value and the
_Destination Cell Identifier_ IE value of the erroneous RIM PDU respectively
into the _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE and the _Source Cell Identifier_ IE
of the RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU

#### 8c.3.4.3 Reception of a RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU in the BSS
Upon reception of an erroneous RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU according to sub-
clause 8c.3.2 the BSS shall discard the received PDU without further action.
The actions to be taken upon reception of a valid RAN-INFORMATION-ERROR PDU
are an implementation-dependent option.
## 8c.4 RIM timers
The following RIM timers are defined:
T(RIR) is used in the controlling BSS to control the reception of the response
to a previously transmitted RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU.
T(RI) is used in the serving BSS used to control the reception of the
acknowledgement of a previously transmitted RAN-INFORMATION PDU.
T(RIAE) is used in the controlling BSS used to control the reception of the
acknowledgement of a previously transmitted RAN-INFORMATION-APPLICATION-ERROR
PDU.

* * *
## 8c.5 Action upon deletion of a cell in a BSS
### 8c.5.0 General
The deletion of a cell in a BSS should trigger the actions described in this
sub-clause to ensure the proper operation of the RIM procedures for RIM
associations related to this cell.
### 8c.5.1 Actions due to the deletion of the cell
If the deleted cell has to report to one or more controlling BSS(s), the
serving BSS parenting the deleted cell shall trigger a RAN Information Send
procedure to inform each of the corresponding controlling BSS(s) that multiple
reporting has been deactivated by the sending of a RAN-INFORMATION/End PDU.
The controlling BSS parenting the deleted cell may also decide that, as a
consequence of the deletion of this cell, some multiple reports previously
requested from some cells parented by other BSS(s) are no longer needed and
shall trigger the relevant RAN Information Request/Stop procedure.
### 8c.5.2 Additional actions in the case the deleted cell is used as a source
cell by RIM
If the cell identifier of the cell being deleted has been used as the _Source
Cell Identifier_ IE value in a previous RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST/Multiple
report PDU, the deletion of this cell shall trigger the following additional
actions to update this information in the serving BSS, as the _Source Cell
Identifier_ IE is used by the serving BSS to address the controlling BSS
(address mirroring - see sub-clause 8c.1.4.3):
\- The controlling BSS parenting this cell shall trigger a RAN Information
Request/Stop procedure for each of the involved cells in the serving BSS;
\- After the completion of this procedure the parenting BSS shall, if event-
based multiple reporting is still needed from the involved cells, trigger
further RAN Information Request/Multiple Report procedure(s) with a different
cell identifier as _Source Cell Identifier_ IE value.
## 8c.6 Specific requirements related to RIM applications
### 8c.6.0 General requirements
Any error condition detected in the _Application Error Container_ IE included
in the _RIM Container_ IE of a valid RIM PDU shall not be reported to the peer
application entity.
Any error condition detected in the _Application Container_ IE included in the
_RIM Container_ IE of an erroneous RIM PDU shall not trigger a RAN Information
Application Error procedure.
A controlling BSS shall not send another RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU for the
same association before the first RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU has been
acknowledged or before T(RIR) associated to this request has expired.
### 8c.6.1 Requirements related to the NACC RIM application
The rules specified in this sub-clause apply when the _RIM Application
Identity_ IE is set to \"Network Assisted Cell Change (NACC)\":
\- The RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU is used by a controlling BSS to request the
system information required for NACC operation in the controlling BSS and
related to a single cell parented by a serving BSS. The _Destination Cell
Identifier_ IE of the RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU shall be set to the value of
the _Reporting Cell Identifier_ field contained in the application container
of the PDU.
\- The presence of the _Application Container_ IE is mandatory in the _RIM
Container_ IE of the RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU.
\- The RAN-INFORMATION PDU is used by a serving BSS to send the system
information required for NACC operation (i.e. if a PBCCH is allocated in the
cell, PSI1, a consistent set of PSI2 and PSI14 messages; if no PBCCH is
allocated in the cell, SI3, SI13 and, if available, SI1 messages - see 3GPP TS
4.060) related to a single reporting cell, to a controlling BSS.
\- In the present specification, NACC between UTRAN and GERAN is restricted to
the case of a controlling RNS and a serving BSS (i.e. assistance is provided
for MSs moving from UTRAN to GERAN) and NACC between E-UTRAN and GERAN is
restricted to the case of a controlling eNodeB and a serving BSS (i.e.
assistance is provided for MSs moving from E-UTRAN to GERAN). The reporting
cell located in the serving BSS is therefore always a GERAN cell and shall be
addressed as such (RAI + CI) in the NACC application containers.
\- The presence of the _Application Container_ IE is mandatory in the _RIM
Container_ IE of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU, except in the case of a RAN-
INFORMATION/Initial Multiple Report PDU and of a RAN-INFORMATION/Single Report
PDU, where the _Application Error Container_ IE may be included instead.
\- When multiple reports from a certain cell have been requested, the RAN-
Information Send procedure shall be triggered every time the set of NACC
related (packet) system information for this cell is changed; the NACC
application shall request acknowledgements.
\- The _Application Container_ IE included in the _RIM container_ IE of a RAN-
INFORMATION/End PDU or of a RAN-INFORMATION/Stop PDU shall contain only the
identity of the reporting cell.
### 8c.6.2 SI3 application
The rules specified in this sub-clause apply when the _RIM Application
Identity_ IE is set to \"SI3\":
\- the RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU is used by a controlling BSS to request
system information type 3 related to a single cell parented by a serving BSS.
The _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE of the RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU shall
be set to the value of the _Reporting Cell Identifier_ field contained in the
application container of the PDU.
\- The presence of the _Application Container_ IE is mandatory in the _RIM_ C
_ontainer_ IE of the RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU.
\- The RAN-INFORMATION PDU is used by a serving BSS to send system information
type 3 related to a single reporting cell, to a controlling BSS.
\- The presence of the _Application Container_ IE is mandatory in the _RIM
Container_ IE of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU, except in the case of a RAN-
INFORMATION/Initial Multiple Report PDU and of a RAN-INFORMATION/Single Report
PDU, where the _Application Error Container_ IE may be included instead.
\- When multiple reports from a certain cell have been requested, the RAN-
Information Send procedure shall be triggered every time the system
information type 3 for this cell is changed; the SI3 application shall request
acknowledgements.
\- The _Application Container_ IE included in the _RIM container_ IE of a RAN-
INFORMATION/End PDU or of a RAN-INFORMATION/Stop PDU shall contain only the
identity of the reporting cell.
### 8c.6.3 MBMS data channel application
The rules specified in this sub-clause apply when the _RIM Application
Identity_ IE is set to \"MBMS data channel\":
\- The RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU is used by a controlling BSS to request the
information about the MBMS data channels established in a single cell
controlled by a serving BSS. The _Destination Cell Identifier_ IE of the RAN-
INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU shall be set to the value of the _Reporting Cell
Identifier_ field contained in the application container of the PDU.
\- The presence of the _Application Container_ IE is mandatory in the _RIM
Container_ IE of the RAN-INFORMATION-REQUEST PDU.
\- The RAN-INFORMATION PDU is used by a serving BSS to send the information
about the MBMS data channels established in a single reporting cell, to a
controlling BSS.
\- The presence of the _Application Container_ IE is mandatory in the _RIM
Container_ IE of the RAN-INFORMATION PDU, except in the case of a RAN-
INFORMATION/Initial Multiple Report PDU and of a RAN-INFORMATION/Single Report
PDU, where the _Application Error Container_ IE may be included instead.
> \- When multiple reports from a certain cell have been requested, the RAN-
> Information Send procedure shall be triggered every time the allocation of
> the MBMS data channel is changed (i.e. established, reconfigured, abnormally
> released) for any MBMS session ongoing in the reporting cell. The MBMS data
> channel application shall request acknowledgements. However the normal
> release (i.e. resulting from a MBMS-SESSION-STOP-REQUEST PDU received from
> the SGSN) of the MBMS data channel at the end of a session shall not trigger
> the RAN-Information Send procedure, but assumed implicitly as done at the
> end of the session by the the controlling BSS.
\- The _Application Container_ IE included in the _RIM container_ IE of a RAN-
INFORMATION/End PDU or of a RAN-INFORMATION/Stop PDU shall contain only the
identity of the reporting cell.
### 8c.6.4 Requirements related to the SON Transfer RIM application
The introduction of generic SON Transfer containers in TS 36.413 [36] means
that the RIM procedure itself has to be understood in a more generic way for
the SON Transfer RIM application: the RIM procedure triggered by the
Controlling BSS is used to exchange between BSSs SON Transfer Request
container (controlling ---> serving) and SON Transfer Response container
(serving ---> controlling), the precise content of these containers (possibly
NULL) being linked with the SON Transfer Application in use.The Reporting Cell
Identifier may either identify a cell in the serving BSS or in the controlling
BSS, depending on the value of the SON Transfer Application Identity as

# 8d Signalling procedures between MBMS SAPs
## 8d.1 General
Upon receiving an MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU from the SGSN, if the BSS
controls cells in any of the MBMS Service Areas in the MBMS service area list
the BSS creates an MBMS Service Context, and acknowledges the SGSN using an
MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU. More than one MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU
can be sent from one BSS to the SGSN for the same MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST
PDU.
Upon receiving an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU from the SGSN, the BSS
updates the MBMS service area list for the ongoing MBMS broadcast service
session and acknowledges the SGSN using an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU.
More than one MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU can be sent from one BSS to the
SGSN for the same MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU.
At the end of the MBMS Session the BSS receives an MBMS-SESSION-STOP-REQUEST
PDU from the SGSN indicating that the MBMS Session can be released. The BSS
acknowledges the request to end the MBMS Session by sending the MBMS-SESSION-
STOP-RESPONSE PDU to the SGSN. See 3GPP TS 43.246 ([29]).
## 8d.2 MBMS Session Start
The BSS creates an MBMS Service Context if the BSS controls cells in the MBMS
service area list upon reception of an MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU from the
SGSN.
If the data is received by the BSS and no MBMS bearer is established on the
radio interface for that MBMS Session the BSS may buffer the data.
At reception of an MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU that leads to an MBMS
Service Context creation in the BSS, the BSS shall respond to the SGSN with an
MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU with a Cause Value indicating that data
transfer shall be initiated on the Point-to-Multipoint BVC from that SGSN.
The SGSN may include the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ information element
in the MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU. If this information element is received
and the BSS supports ARP handling, the BSS shall establish or modify the
resources according to the values of the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE
(priority level, pre-emption indicators) and the resource situation as
follows:
\- The BSS shall consider the priority level of the requested MBMS bearer,
when deciding on the resource allocation.
\- The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (singularly or in
combination) be used to determine whether the MBMS bearer establishment has to
be performed unconditionally and immediately. If the requested MBMS bearer is
marked as \"may trigger pre-emption\" and the resource situation requires so,
the BSS may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced
release of a lower priority bearer which is marked as \"pre-emptable\". Whilst
the process and the extent of the pre-emption procedure is operator-dependent,
the pre-emption indicators, if given in the MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU,
shall be treated as follows:
1\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to \"may trigger pre-emption\",
then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption procedure. The BSS
shall only pre‑empt bearers (other MBMS bearers or MS specific bearers) with
lower priority, in ascending order of priority.
2\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to \"shall not trigger pre-
emption\", then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption
procedure.
3\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to \"pre-emptable\", then
this connection shall be included in the pre-emption process.
4\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to \"not pre-emptable\", then
this connection shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
5\. If the _Priority Level_ IE is set to \"no priority\" the given values for
the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE and _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE shall not
be considered. Instead the values \"shall not trigger pre-emption\" and \"not
pre-emptable\" shall prevail.
> \- If the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE is not given in the MBMS-
> SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU, the allocation request shall not trigger the pre-
> emption process and the connection may be pre-empted and considered to have
> the value \"lowest\" as priority level.
>
> \- The SGSN shall not include, and the BSS shall ignore, any queuing allowed
> indication in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE of the MBMS-SESSION-
> START-REQUEST PDU.
The _MBMS Session Repetition Number_ IE shall be included in the MBMS-SESSION-
START-REQUEST PDU in case the _MBMS Session Identity_ IE is included in the
same PDU (and vice versa). The _MBMS Session Repetition Number_ IE allows the
BSS to recognize retransmissions of a specific session of an MBMS bearer
service. The value part of this IE may be used for e.g. deciding whether or
not to initiate the counting procedure on a per cell basis (see 3GPP TS
44.018, 3GPP TS 44.060) or, in conjunction with the values of
_Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, whether or not to establish an MBMS radio
bearer for the session on a per cell basis.
At reception of an MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU with the same TMGI IE and
MBMS Session Identity IE as an ongoing MBMS Service Context, the BSS shall
respond to the SGSN with an MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU with a Cause Value
indicating that data transfer has already been initiated on the Point-to-
Multipoint BVC from another SGSN.
At reception of an MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU, the SGSN shall either
start data transfer or not depending on the received Cause Value.
After transmission of the MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU, the BSS shall wait
at least the time specified in the value part of the _Time to MBMS Data
Transfer_ IE included in the MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU and at most a time
exceeding by 5 seconds the value part of the _Time to MBMS Data Transfer_ IE
for the first reception of the associated data before the BSS validates
whether or not there is another SGSN that previously has sent an MBMS-SESSION-
START-REQUEST PDU.
If after the start of the data flow associated to an MBMS Service Context, the
BSS does not receive data for at least 30 seconds and the BSS has not received
the MBMS-SESSION-STOP-REQUEST PDU, the BSS validates whether or not there is
another SGSN that previously has sent an MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU.
If, in any of the two cases mentioned above, another SGSN has sent an MBMS-
SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU, the BSS shall send an MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE
PDU to such an SGSN with a Cause Value indicating that data transfer shall be
initiated on the Point-to-Multipoint BVC from that SGSN. Otherwise, the BSS
shall end the MBMS Service Context.
In any case, the BSS will send an MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU with a Cause
Value indicating that the MBMS Service Context has been released due to
interrupted data flow to the SGSN that previously has been ordered to perform
data transfer.
If the BSS does not support any MBMS Service Area in the MBMS Service Area
Identity List the BSS will send an MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU to the SGSN
with Cause Value indicating that none of the listed MBMS Service Areas are
supported by the BSS.
Figure 8d.2: MBMS Session Start procedure
### 8d.2.1 Abnormal Conditions
In any failure case in BSS the BSS may send an MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU
including a Cause Value indicating the reason for the failure.
If an MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU is not received in response to an MBMS-
SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU within T11 seconds, then the MBMS-SESSION-START-
REQUEST PDU shall be repeated a maximum of MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST-RETRIES
attempts. After MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST-RETRIES + 1 attempts the procedure
is stopped and the O&M is informed.
## 8d.3 MBMS Session Stop
The SGSN may terminate an MBMS Session in the BSS by sending the MBMS-SESSION-
STOP-REQUEST PDU to the BSS. The SGSN shall include the _MBMS Stop Cause_ IE
in the MBMS-SESSION-STOP-REQUEST PDU to indicate to the BSS if the MBMS
Session termination has been ordered by an upstream node or if the SGSN itself
has decided to terminate the MBMS Session (due to e.g. that the last MS that
has an active MBMS UE Context for the MBMS Session within the SGSN has left
the routing area(s) handled by the BSS).
The BSS ends an MBMS Service Context upon reception of an MBMS-SESSION-STOP-
REQUEST PDU, including the _MBMS Stop Cause_ IE indicating that an upstream
node is terminating the MBMS Session, from the SGSN and acknowledges with an
MBMS-SESSION-STOP-RESPONSE PDU.
At reception of an MBMS-SESSION-STOP-REQUEST PDU including the _MBMS Stop
Cause_ IE indicating that the SGSN is terminating the MBMS Session, the BSS
shall validate whether or not there is another SGSN that previously has sent
an MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU or, in case of an MBMS broadcast service
session, an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU.
If another SGSN has sent an MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU or an MBMS-SESSION-
UPDATE-REQUEST PDU, the BSS shall send an MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE PDU or
an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU, respectively, to such an SGSN with a
Cause Value indicating that data transfer shall be initiated on the Point-to-
Multipoint BVC from that SGSN. Otherwise, the BSS shall end the MBMS Service
Context. The BSS shall then acknowledge the MBMS-SESSION-STOP-REQUEST PDU by
sending an MBMS-SESSION-STOP-RESPONSE PDU to the SGSN.
Figure 8d.3: MBMS Session Stop procedure
### 8d.3.1 Abnormal Conditions
If an MBMS-SESSION-STOP-RESPONSE PDU is not received in response to an MBMS-
SESSION-STOP-REQUEST PDU within T11 seconds, then the MBMS-SESSION-STOP-
REQUEST PDU shall be repeated a maximum of MBMS-SESSION-STOP-REQUEST-RETRIES
attempts. After MBMS-SESSION-STOP-REQUEST-RETRIES + 1 attempts the procedure
is stopped and the O&M is informed.
## 8d.4 MBMS Session Update
Upon reception of an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU from the SGSN for an
ongoing MBMS broadcast service session, the BSS creates an MBMS Service
Context if the BSS controls cells in the MBMS service area list and there is
no ongoing MBMS Service Context identified with the same _TMGI_ IE and, if
available, _MBMS Session Identity_ IE in the BSS.
Upon reception of an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU with the same _TMGI_ IE
and, if available, _MBMS Session Identity_ IE as an ongoing MBMS Service
Context but with (a) new MBMS Service Area(s) added to the _MBMS Service Area
Identity List_ IE, the BSS may send assignments for the ongoing MBMS broadcast
service session to the mobile stations in the new MBMS Service Area(s) and
repeat notifications to the mobile stations in the old MBMS Service Area(s).
Upon reception of an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU with the same _TMGI_ IE
and, if available, _MBMS Session Identity_ IE as an ongoing MBMS Service
Context but without (an) old MBMS Service Area(s) included any longer in the
_MBMS Service Area Identity List_ IE, the BSS shall release MBMS radio bearers
relevant to the ongoing MBMS broadcast service session in the old MBMS Service
Area(s).
The _MBMS Session Information_ IE shall denote a Broadcast MBMS Session.
The _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, if available, and the _MBMS Session
Repetition Number_ IE, if available, shall be handled by the BSS as described
in the MBMS Session Start procedure (see sub-clause 8d.2).
If the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE is not present in the MBMS-SESSION-
UPDATE-REQUEST PDU, the allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption
process and the connection may be pre-empted and considered to have the value
\"lowest\" as priority level.
If the data is received by the BSS and no MBMS bearer is established on the
radio interface for that MBMS Session, the BSS may buffer the data.
At reception of an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU that leads to an MBMS
Service Context creation in the BSS, the BSS shall respond to the SGSN with an
MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU with a Cause Value indicating that data
transfer shall be initiated on the Point-to-Multipoint BVC from that SGSN.
At reception of an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU with the same _TMGI_ IE
and, if available, _MBMS Session Identity_ IE as an ongoing MBMS Service
Context and including new and/or removing old MBMS Service Area(s), the BSS
shall respond to the SGSN with an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU with a
Cause Value indicating either that data transfer shall continue on the Point-
to-Multipoint BVC from that SGSN (see note) or that data transfer has already
been initiated on the Point-to-Multipoint BVC from another SGSN.
NOTE: The Cause Value indicating that data transfer shall continue on the
Point-to-Multipoint BVC from that SGSN is set to the same one denoting that
data transfer shall be initiated on the Point-to-Multipoint BVC from that
SGSN, i.e. '0001' (see sub-clause 11.3.74).
If the BSS does not support any MBMS Service Area in the _MBMS Service Area
Identity List_ IE, the BSS shall send an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU to
the SGSN with a Cause Value indicating that none of the listed MBMS Service
Areas are supported by the BSS.
At reception of an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU, the SGSN shall either
start/continue data transfer or not depending on the received Cause Value.
After transmission of the MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU, the BSS shall wait
at least the time specified in the value part of the _Time to MBMS Data
Transfer_ IE included in the MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU and at most a
time exceeding by 5 seconds the value part of the _Time to MBMS Data Transfer_
IE for the first reception of the associated data before the BSS validates
whether or not there is another SGSN that previously has sent an MBMS-SESSION-
UPDATE-REQUEST PDU or an MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU with the same content
of the received MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU.
If after the start of the data flow associated to an MBMS Service Context, the
BSS does not receive data for at least 30 seconds and the BSS has not received
the MBMS-SESSION-STOP-REQUEST PDU, the BSS validates whether or not there is
another SGSN that previously has sent an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU or an
MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU with the same content of the received MBMS-
SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU.
If, in any of the two cases mentioned above, another SGSN has sent an MBMS-
SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU or an MBMS-SESSION-START-REQUEST PDU, the BSS shall
send an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU or an MBMS-SESSION-START-RESPONSE
PDU, respectively, to such an SGSN with a Cause Value indicating that data
transfer shall be initiated on the Point-to-Multipoint BVC from that SGSN.
Otherwise, the BSS shall end the MBMS Service Context.
In any case, the BSS shall send an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU with a
Cause Value indicating that the MBMS Service Context has been released due to
interrupted data flow to the SGSN that previously has been ordered to perform
data transfer.
Figure 8d.4: MBMS Session Update procedure
### 8d.4.1 Abnormal Conditions
In any failure case in BSS the BSS may send an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE
PDU including a Cause Value indicating the reason for the failure.
If an MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-RESPONSE PDU is not received in response to an MBMS-
SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST PDU within T11 seconds, then the MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-
REQUEST PDU shall be repeated a maximum of MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST-RETRIES
attempts. After MBMS-SESSION-UPDATE-REQUEST-RETRIES + 1 attempts the procedure
is stopped and the O&M is informed.
# 9 General Protocol Error Handling
Refer to General Protocol Error Handling/3GPP TS 48.016. In addition:
\- any type of BSSGP PDU received without an expected conditional IE is
discarded and a STATUS PDU (cause \"Missing conditional IE\") is sent;
\- any type of BSSGP PDU received without a mandatory IE is discarded and a
STATUS PDU (cause \"Missing mandatory IE\") is sent;
\- any type of BSSGP PDU received with a syntactical error in an expected
conditional IE is discarded and a STATUS PDU (cause \"Conditional IE error\")
is sent;
\- any type of BSSGP PDU received with a syntactical error in a mandatory IE
is discarded and a STATUS PDU (cause \"Invalid mandatory information\") is
sent;
\- any type of BSSGP PDU received for a feature that is not negotiated is
discarded and a STATUS PDU (cause \"PDU not compatible with the feature set\")
is sent.
Some BSSGP PDU shall contain one and only one conditional IE amongst a defined
list of possible conditional IE (e.g. PAGING-PS PDU). If such a BSSGP PDU is
received with more than one conditional IE amongst the defined list of
possible conditional IE, as defined in sub-clause 10, the PDU is discarded and
a STATUS PDU (cause \"Unexpected conditional IE\") is sent.
