# 1 Scope
The present document gives a description of the general baseband operation of
half rate speech traffic channels in the transmitter and in the receiver of
GSM Mobile Stations (MS)s and Base Station Systems (BSS)s during Discontinuous
Transmission (DTX).
For clarity, the description is structured according to the block diagrams in
figures 1 and 4. Except in the case described below, this structure of
distributing the various functions between system entities is not mandatory
for implementation, as long as the operation on the air interface and on the
speech decoder output remains the same.
In the case of BSSs where the speech transcoder is located remotely in the
Base Station Controller (BSC), the implementation of the interfaces between
the DTX Handlers and the Radio Sub System (RSS) as described in the present
document together with all their flags is mandatory, being a part of the A-bis
interface as described in GSM 08.61 [10].
The DTX functions described in the present document are mandatory for
implementation in all GSM MSs. The receiver requirements are mandatory for
implementation in all GSM BSSs, the transmitter requirements only for those
where downlink DTX will be used.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**accepted SID frame:** traffic frame which is flagged with SID= \"1\" or SID=
\"2\" by the Radio Subsystem.
**bad traffic frame:** traffic frame flagged BFI= \"1\" (Bad Frame Indication)
or with UFI= \"1\" (Unreliable Frame Indication) by the Radio Subsystem.
**frame:** time interval of 20 ms corresponding to the time segmentation of
the half rate speech transcoder defined in GSM 06.20 (ETS 300 969) [6]), also
used as a short term for a traffic frame.
**good speech frame:** good traffic frame which is not an accepted SID frame.
**good traffic frame:** traffic frame flagged BFI= \"0\" and UFI= \"0\" by the
Radio Subsystem.
**GS averaging period:** period in which the quantized energy tweak parameters
GS are averaged: it corresponds to the hangover period.
**hangover period:** period of 7 frames added at the end of a speech burst in
which VAD flag = \"0\" and SP flag= \"1\".
**invalid SID frame:** accepted SID frame which was not classified as valid
SID frame. This frame is not valid for updating comfort noise parameters, but
the frame conveys information that comfort noise generations should be started
or continued.
**lost SID frame:** unusable frame received when the RX DTX Handler is
generating comfort noise and a SID frame is expected (Time Alignment Flag TAF=
\"1\").
**lost speech frame:** unusable frame received when the RX DTX Handler is
passing on traffic frames directly to the speech decoder.
**SID code word:** fixed bit pattern defined in GSM 06.22 [8], for labelling a
traffic frame as a SID frame.
**SID field:** bit positions defined in GSM 06.22 [8], of the SID codeword
within a SID frame.
**SID frame: f** rame characterised by the SID (Silence Descriptor) code word.
It conveys information on the acoustic background noise.
**SP flag:** boolean flag, generated by the TX DTX handler, indicating the
presence of a speech frame (\"1\") or the presence of a SID frame (\"0\").
**speech frame:** traffic frame that cannot be classified as a SID frame.
**traffic frame:** block of 112 information bits transmitted on the half rate
speech traffic channel.
**unusable frame:** bad traffic frame that is not an accepted SID frame.
**VAD flag:** boolean flag, generated by the VAD algorithm defined in GSM
06.42 [9], indicating the presence (\"1\") or the absence (\"0\") of a speech
frame.
**valid SID frame:** good traffic frame flagged with SID= \"2\" by the Radio
Subsystem. This frame is valid for updating comfort noise parameters at any
time.

# 4 General
DTX is a mechanism which allows the radio transmitter to be switched off most
of the time during speech pauses for the following two purposes:
\- to save power in the MS;
\- to reduce the overall interference level over the air interface.
DTX shall be in operation in GSM MS if commanded so by the network, see GSM
04.08 [2].
## 4.1 General Organisation
The overall DTX mechanism described in the present document requires the
following functions:
\- a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) on the transmit (TX) side;
\- evaluation of the background acoustic noise on the TX side, in order to TX
characteristic parameters to the receive (RX) side;
\- generation on the RX side of a similar noise, called comfort noise, during
periods where the radio transmission is switched off.
The VAD is defined in GSM 06.42 [9], the comfort noise functions in GSM 06.22
[8]. Both are based partly on the speech transcoder and its internal
variables, defined in GSM 06.20 [6].
In addition to these functions, if the parameters arriving at the (RX) side
are detected to be corrupted by errors, the speech or comfort noise shall be
generated from substituted data in order to avoid sound defects for the
listener. This function is defined in GSM 06.21 [7].
An overall description of the speech processing parts can be found in GSM
06.02 [5].
# 5 Transmit (TX) side
A block diagram of the TX side DTX functions is shown in figure 1.
Figure 1: Block diagram of the transmit side DTX functions
## 5.1 General Operation
The TX DTX handler continuously passes traffic frames, individually marked by
the SP flag, to the RSS. This binary flag is redundant to the SIlence
Descriptor (SID) code word labelling. SP flag = \"1\" indicates a speech
frame, SP flag = \"0\" a SID frame.
The scheduling of the frames for transmission on the air interface is
controlled by the RSS alone, on the basis of the SP flag as described in
clause 5.1.1.
### 5.1.1 Functions of the TX DTX handler
To allow verification of the TX DTX handler functions, all frames before the
reset of the system are treated as if they were speech frames of an infinitely
long time. Therefore, the first 7 frames after the reset are marked with SP
flag = \"1\", even if VAD flag = \"0\" (hangover period, see figure 2).
The VAD shall operate all the time in order to assess whether the input signal
contains speech or not. The output is a binary flag (VAD flag = \"1\" or VAD
flag = \"0\", respectively) on a frame by frame basis (see GSM 06.42 [9]).
The VAD flag controls indirectly, via the TX DTX handler operations described
below, the overall DTX operation on the TX side.
Whenever the VAD flag = \"1\", the speech encoder output frame shall be passed
directly to the RSS, marked with SP flag = \"1\".
At the end of a speech burst (transition VAD flag = \"1\" to VAD flag =
\"0\"), it takes 8 consecutive frames to make a new updated SID frame
available (see GSM 06.22 [8]). Normally, the first 7 speech encoder output
frames after the end of the speech burst shall therefore be passed directly to
the RSS, marked with SP flag = \"1\" (\"hangover period\"). The first new SID
frame is then passed to the RSS as frame 8 after the end of the speech burst,
marked with SP flag = \"0\" (see figure 2).
Figure 2: Normal hangover procedure (Nelapsed > 23)
If, however, at the end of the speech burst, less than 24 frames have elapsed
since the last SID frame was computed and passed to the RSS, then this last
SID frame shall repeatedly be passed to the RSS, until a new updated SID frame
is available (8 consecutive frames marked with VAD flag = \"0\"). This reduces
the activity on the air interface in cases where short background noise spikes
are taken for speech, by avoiding the \"hangover\" waiting for the SID frame
computation (see figure 3).
NOTE: Figure 3 shows an example of the longest possible speech burst without
hangover.
Once the first SID frame after the end of a speech burst has been computed and
passed to the RSS, the TX DTX Handler shall continuously compute and pass
updated SID frames to the RSS, marked with SP flag = \"0\" as long as the VAD
flag = \"0\".
The speech encoder is operated in full speech modality if SP flag = \"1\" and
in a simplified mode if SP flag = \"0\", because not all encoder functions are
required for the evaluation of comfort noise parameters (see GSM 06.22 [8]).
### 5.1.2 Functions of the TX radio subsystem
The following traffic frames shall be scheduled for transmission:
\- all frames marked with SP flag = \"1\";
\- the first one with SP flag = \"0\" after one or more frames with SP flag =
\"1\";
\- those marked with SP flag = \"0\" and aligned with the Slow Associated
Control CHannel (SACCH) multiframe structure as described in GSM 05.08 [4].
This has the overall function, that the radio transmission is turned off after
the transmission of a SID frame when the speaker stops talking. During speech
pauses, the transmission is resumed at regular intervals for transmission of
one SID frame, in order to update the generated comfort noise on the RX side
(and to improve the measurement of the link quality by the RSS).
If a SID frame (SP flag = \"0\"), scheduled for transmission is stolen for
Fast Associated Control CHannel (FACCH) signalling purposes, then the
subsequent frame shall be scheduled for transmission instead.

## 6.1 General operation
Whatever their context (speech, SID, FACCH or none), the RSS continuously
passes the received traffic frames to the RX DTX handler, individually marked
by various pre-processing functions with 4 flags. These are the Bad Frame
Indicator (BFI) flag, the Unreliable Frame Indicator (UFI) flag, the SIlence
Descriptor (SID) flag and the Time Alignment Flag (TAF) described in clause
6.1.1 and table 1, which serve to classify the traffic frame according to the
list of terms defined in clause 3.1. This classification, summarised in table
1, allows the RX DTX handler to determine how the received frame is to be
handled.
Table 1 Classification of traffic frames
* * *
                     SID
BFI \"OR\" UFI* 2 1 0 0 Valid SID frame Good speech frame 1 Invalid SID frame
Unusable frame
* * *
* BFI \"OR\" UFI indicates a logical OR combination of the BFI and UFI flags.
NOTE: The SID computation is left open to manufacturers with the constraint to
meet the performance requirements given in the GSM 05.05 [3]. An example
solution is given in the C-code (GSM 06.06 [11]).
### 6.1.1 Functions of the RX radio subsystem
The binary BFI flag (see GSM 05.05 [3]) indicates whether the traffic frame is
considered to contain meaningful information bits (BFI flag = \"0\") or not
(BFI flag = \"1\"). In the context of the present document, a FACCH frame is
considered not to contain meaningful bits and shall be marked with BFI flag =
\"1\". The BFI flag shall fulfil the performance requirements of GSM 05.05
[3].
NOTE: That the BFI flag,which is generated by the channel error correction
scheme, will in some cases be modified by the SID frame detection unit.
The UFI flag is the output of the Forward Error Correction (FEC) procedure and
give indications about the channel performance. The UFI flag shall fulfil the
performance requirements of GSM 05.05 [3].
The SID frame detector compares bit by bit the relevant bits of the received
traffic frame (the SID field) with the SID code word defined in GSM 06.22 [8]
and gives back the ternary SID flag. The SID flag shall fulfil the performance
requirements of GSM 05.05 [3].The binary TAF flag marks with TAF = \"1\" those
traffic frames that are aligned with the SACCH multiframe structure as
described in GSM 05.08 [4].
### 6.1.2 Functions of the RX DTX handler
The RX DTX handler shall be responsible for the overall DTX operation on the
RX side.
The DTX operation on the RX side shall be as follows:
\- whenever a good speech frame is detected, the DTX Handler shall pass it
directly on to the speech decoder;
\- when lost speech or lost SID frames are detected, the substitution and
muting procedure defined in GSM 06.21 [7] shall be applied;
\- valid SID frames shall result in comfort noise generation, as defined in
GSM 06.22 [8], until the next SID frame is expected (TAF=\"1\") or good speech
frames are detected. During this period, the RX DTX handler shall ignore any
unusable frames delivered by the RSS;
\- an invalid SID frame shall be substituted by the last valid SID frame and
the procedure for valid SID frames be applied.
NOTE: If the first SID frame after a speech burst (a series of good speech
frames) is invalid, then the comfort noise parameters can be taken from the
last valid SID frame or, if the series of good speech frames received was
longer than 30 (23+7), from the last received good speech frame which, because
of the VAD hangover time (see GSM 06.42 [9]), may be supposed to contain noise
only.
