# Introduction
To evaluate conformance of a particular implementation, it is necessary to
have a statement of which capabilities and options have been implemented for a
telecommunication specification. Such a statement is called an Implementation
Conformance Statement (ICS).
The present document is 2^nd^ part of a multi-part conformance test
specification for UE and is _valid for 3GPP Release 5 (respectively Release 15
for 5GS test cases)_. The specification contains the UE IMS CC capability and
the applicability of the UE IMS CC conformance test cases.

# 1 Scope
The present document provides the Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS)
proforma for 3^rd^ Generation User Equipment (UE) supporting the Internet
Protocol (IP) multimedia call control protocol based on Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP), in compliance with the
relevant requirements, and in accordance with the relevant guidance given in
ISO/IEC 9646-7 [8] and ETS 300 406 [9].
The present document also specifies a recommended applicability statement for
the test cases included in TS 34.229-1 [5] and TS 34.229-5 [95]. These
applicability statements are based on the features implemented in the UE.
The present document is valid for UE implemented according to 3GPP releases
starting from Release 5 up to the Release indicated on the cover page of the
present document.
Also, it is generally assumed that an IMS capable UE is compliant to GSMA PRD
IR.92 [83] and GSMA PRD IR.94 [75];any update of requirements in these GSMA
PRD documents, which are relevant to the present document will be handled on a
case by case basis, with due consideration given for grace period to be
granted for the UE to comply to any updated requirements.

# 4 Recommended test case applicability
The applicability of each individual test is identified in the table 1. This
is just a recommendation based on the purpose for which the test case was
written.
The applicability of every test is formally expressed by the use of Boolean
expression that are based on parameters (ICS) included in annex A of the
present document.
Additional information related to the Test Case (TC), e.g. affecting its
dynamic behaviour or its execution may be provided as well.
The columns in table 1 have the following meaning:
##### Clause {#clause .H6}
The clause column indicates the clause number in TS 34.229-1 [5] that contains
the test body.
##### Title {#title .H6}
The title column describes the name of the test.
##### Release {#release .H6}
The release column indicates the earliest release from which each testcase is
applicable, except if otherwise stated of an individual test case.
NOTE: For the IMS Emergency Service test cases, the 3GPP Release of UTRAN and
GERAN is independent of that indicated in the release column.
##### Applicability {#applicability .H6}
The following notations are used for the applicability column:
R recommended - the test case is recommended
O optional -- the test case is optional
N/A not applicable - in the given context, the test case is not recommended.
Ci conditional - the test is recommended (\"R\") or not (\"N/A\") depending on
the support of other items. \"i\" is an integer identifying an unique
conditional status expression which is defined immediately following the
table. For nested conditional expressions, the syntax \"IF ... THEN (IF ...
THEN ... ELSE...) ELSE ...\" is used to avoid ambiguities.
##### Comments {#comments .H6}
This column contains a verbal description of the condition included in the
applicability column.

NOTE 1: Applicability of test cases 13.2 and 13.3 are currently marked as FFS.
The reason to this is that the contents of the specific messages sent by the
SS (as currently specified within those Call Control test cases) do not match
the contents of those messages as expected by any specific IMS application
known. Further on the test specification apparently lacks support for certain
application specific message exchanges which are however mandatory for a few
specific IMS applications specified outside of TS 24.229. It is necessary to
fully resolve the problem (by e.g. defining the applications for which the
Call Control test cases would be applicable, possibly specifying the
extensions to the test cases like required by those applications and creating
the corresponding application profiles) before the applicability statements of
Call Control test cases can be unambiguously defined.
NOTE 2: Either one of the two adjacent test cases, i.e. (19.1.3 or 19.1.3a),
(19.3.2 or 19.3.2a), shall be executed.
NOTE 3: This TC can optionally be executed against Rel-8 and onwards UEs.
NOTE 4: In case the UE supports both GBA and HTTP Digest, GBA shall be used as
XCAP authentication.
NOTE 5: In case the UE supports both GBA and HTTP Digest, HTTP Digest shall be
used as XCAP authentication.
NOTE 6: The TC contains multi-RAT branches not all mandatory in the scope of
the TC. The E-UTRA/EPC branch will be executed always; the TC will go through
any other RAT branch depending on the UE capability. Execution only of the
E-UTRA/EPC branch regardless of the UE capabilities can also be imposed by
setting the IXIT px_RATComb_Tested = EUTRA_only. For UEs supporting both UTRA
and GERAN the TC should be executed once only for the E-UTRA/EPC and UTRA
combination by setting the px_RATComb_Tested = EUTRA_UTRA.
NOTE 7: This TC can optionally be executed against Rel-9 and onwards UEs.

###### ## Annex A (normative): ICS proforma for 3^rd^ Generation User
Equipment supporting IP multimedia call control based on SIP and SDP
Notwithstanding the provisions of the copyright related to the text of the
present document, The Organizational Partners of 3GPP grant that users of the
present document may freely reproduce the ICS proforma in this annex so that
it can be used for its intended purposes and may further publish the completed
ICS.
## A.1 Guidance for completing the ICS proforma
### A.1.1 Purposes and structure
The purpose of this ICS proforma is to provide a mechanism whereby a supplier
of an implementation of the requirements defined in relevant specifications
may provide information about the implementation in a standardised manner.
The ICS proforma is subdivided into clauses for the following categories of
information:
\- instructions for completing the ICS proforma;
\- identification of the implementation;
\- identification of the protocol;
\- ICS proforma tables (for example: UE roles specific to additional
capabilities, Major capabilities etc).
### A.1.2 Abbreviations and conventions
This annex does not reflect dynamic conformance requirements but static ones.
In particular, a condition for support of a PDU parameter does not reflect
requirements about the syntax of the PDU (i.e. the presence of a parameter)
but the capability of the implementation to support the parameter.
In the sending direction, the support of a parameter means that the
implementation is able to send this parameter (but it does not mean that the
implementation always sends it).
In the receiving direction, it means that the implementation supports the
whole semantic of the parameter that is described in the main part of this
specification.
As a consequence, PDU parameter tables in this annex are not the same as the
tables describing the syntax of a PDU in the reference specification, e.g. RFC
3261 [15] tables 2 and 3. It is not rare to see a parameter which is optional
in the syntax but mandatory in subclause below.
The ICS proforma contained in this annex is comprised of information in
tabular form in accordance with the guidelines presented in ISO/IEC 9646â€‘7
[8].
##### Item column {#item-column .H6}
The item column contains a number which identifies the item in the table.
##### Item description column {#item-description-column .H6}
The item description column describes in free text each respective item (e.g.
parameters, timers, etc.). It implicitly means "is \
supported by the implementation?".
##### Reference column {#reference-column .H6}
The reference column gives reference to the relevant 3GPP core specifications
and optional IMS profile documents (e.g. GSMA PRD IR.92).
##### Status column {#status-column .H6}
The various statii used in this annex are in accordance with the rules in
table A.1. The status column can also be used for IMS profile documents.
Table A.1: Key to status codes
* * *
Status code Status name Meaning m mandatory the capability shall be supported.
It is a static view of the fact that the conformance requirements related to
the capability in the reference specification are mandatory requirements. This
does not mean that a given behaviour shall always be observed (this would be a
dynamic view), but that it shall be observed when the implementation is placed
in conditions where the conformance requirements from the reference
specification compel it to do so. For instance, if the support for a parameter
in a sent PDU is mandatory, it does not mean that it shall always be present,
but that it shall be present according to the description of the behaviour in
the reference specification (dynamic conformance requirement). o optional the
capability may or may not be supported. It is an implementation choice. n/a
not applicable it is impossible to use the capability. No answer in the
support column is required. x prohibited (excluded) It is not allowed to use
the capability. This is more common for a profile. c \ conditional
the requirement on the capability (\"m\", \"o\", \"n/a\" or \"x\") depends on
the support of other optional or conditional items. \ is the
identifier of the conditional expression. o.\ qualified optional for
mutually exclusive or selectable options from a set. \ is the
identifier of the group of options, and the logic of selection of the options.
* * *
##### Release column {#release-column .H6}
The release column indicates the earliest release from which the capability or
option is relevant.
##### Mnemonic column {#mnemonic-column .H6}
The Mnemonic column contains mnemonic identifiers for each item.
##### Support column {#support-column .H6}
The support column shall be filled in by the supplier of the implementation.
The following common notations, defined in ISO/IEC 9646â€‘7 [8], are used for
the support column:
Y or y supported by the implementation
N or n not supported by the implementation
N/A, n/a or â€‘ no answer required (allowed only if the status is N/A, directly
or after evaluation of a conditional status)
##### References to items {#references-to-items .H6}
For each possible item answer (answer in the support column) within the ICS
proforma there exists a unique reference, used, for example, in the
conditional expressions. It is defined as the table identifier, followed by a
solidus character "/", followed by the item number in the table.
EXAMPLE: A.5/4 is the reference to the answer of item 4 in table A.5.
### A.1.3 Instructions for completing the ICS proforma
The supplier of the implementation may complete the ICS proforma in each of
the spaces provided. More detailed instructions are given at the beginning of
the different clauses of the ICS proforma.
## A.2 Identification of the User Equipment
Identification of the User Equipment should be filled in so as to provide as
much detail as possible regarding version numbers and configuration options.
The product supplier information and client information should both be filled
in if they are different.
A person who can answer queries regarding information supplied in the ICS
should be named as the contact person.
