# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3GPP.
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of this TR, it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying
change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 Indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
This Technical Report is a living document and will continuously be upgraded
as standards and regulations change. Sections will be added for new regions or
nations, which enter the 3GPP and have different requirements. It is the
intention to reference global standards but where it is known that none exist
then alternative standards mandated by the regional and or national
requirements will be quoted.
The sole purpose of the document is as a reference to the current status at
time of publication. When new versions are published they will supersede the
previous ones.
# 1 Scope
The present document shows in tabular form most of the current regulatory and
voluntary requirements by region or nation, and is for information purposes
only.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions, which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document in the same
Release as the present document.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
**Ancillary equipment:** Equipment (apparatus), used in connection with a user
equipment (UE) is considered as an ancillary equipment (apparatus) if:
\- the equipment is intended for use in conjunction with a UE to provide
additional operational and/or control features to the UE, (e.g. to extend
control to another position or location); and
\- the equipment cannot be used on a stand alone basis to provide user
functions independently of a UE; and
\- the UE to which it is connected, is capable of providing some intended
operation such as transmitting and/or receiving without the ancillary
equipment (i.e. it is not a sub‑unit of the main equipment essential to the
main equipment basic functions).
**Idle mode:** Idle mode is the state of User Equipment (UE) when switched on
but with no Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection.
**Port** : particular interface, of the specified equipment (apparatus), with
the electromagnetic environment. For example, any connection point on an
equipment intended for connection of cables to or from that equipment is
considered as a port (see figure 1).
{width="4.772916666666666in" height="1.5805555555555555in"}
**Spurious emission from ITU-R SM 329:** Emission on a frequency, or
frequencies, which are outside the necessary bandwidth and the level of which
may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of
information. Spurious emissions include harmonic emissions, parasitic
emissions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products but
exclude out‑of‑band emissions.
NOTE For multi‑channel or multi-carrier transmitters/transponders, where
several carriers may be transmitted simultaneously from a final output
amplifier or an active antenna, the centre frequency of the emission is taken
to be the centre of the --3dB bandwidth of the transmitter or transponder.
**Telecommunication port:** Ports which are intended to be connected to
telecommunication networks (e.g. public switched telecommunication networks,
integrated services digital networks), local area networks (e.g. Ethernet,
Token Ring) and similar networks (see CISPR 22).
**Transient phenomena:** Pertaining to or designating a phenomena or a
quantity which varies between two consecutive steady states during a time
interval short compared with the time-scale of interest (IEC 60050-161 ).
