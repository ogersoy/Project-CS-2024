Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP)
used on the interface between the control plane and the user plane function.
PFCP shall be used over:
-the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and the combined Sxa/Sxb reference points specified in 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
\- the Sxa\' and Sxb\' reference points specified in 3GPP TS 33.107 [20]. In
the rest of this specification, no difference is made between Sxa and Sxa\',
or between Sxb and Sxb\'. The Sxa\' and Sxb\' reference points reuse the
protocol specified for the Sxa and Sxb reference points, but comply in
addition with the security requirements specified in clause 8 of 3GPP 33.107
[20].
the N4 interface specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].
In this specification the term CP function applies to control plane nodes such
as SGW-C, PGW-C, TDF-C and SMF.
In this specification the term UP function applies to user plane nodes such as
SGW-U, PGW-U, TDF-U and UPF.
The prefix PFCP in message and procedure names is used to indicate that
messages and procedures are common and used on Sx and N4 reference point. A
PFCP session refers to both Sx and/or N4 sessions. PFCP association are
describing procedures to establish associations between EPC nodes
(SGW-C/PGW-C/TDF-C and SGW-U/PGW-U/TDF-U) and also between 5G nodes (SMF and
UPF).
In the related stage 2 specifications the prefix Sx and N4 is used for these
common procedures realised by PFCP
Clauses or paragraphs that only apply to EPC or 5GC are indicated by the label
\"for EPC\" or \"for 5GC\".

# 5 General description
## 5.1 Introduction
The architecture reference model with Control and User Plane Separation of EPC
nodes is described in clause 4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
The architecture reference model with SMF and UPF of 5GC nodes is described in
clause 4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
This clause specifies the high level principles of the PFCP protocol and
describe how 3GPP functionalities are realised on the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4
reference points, e.g. Packet Forwarding, Policy and Charging Control, Lawful
Interception.
## 5.2 Packet Forwarding Model
### 5.2.1 General
The packet forwarding scenarios supported over the Sxa, Sxb and Sxc reference
points are specified in 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
The packet forwarding scenarios supported over the N4 reference point are
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].
The CP function controls the packet processing in the UP function by
establishing, modifying or deleting PFCP Session contexts and by provisioning
(i.e. adding, modifying or deleting) PDRs, FARs, QERs, URRs, BAR and/or MAR or
by activating/deactivating pre-defined PDRs, FARs, QERs, URRs, per PFCP
session context, whereby a PFCP session context may correspond:
\- for EPC, to an individual PDN connection, a TDF session, or a standalone
session not tied to any PDN connection or TDF session used e.g. for forwarding
Radius, Diameter or DHCP signalling between the PGW-C and the PDN.
\- for 5GC, to an individual PDU session or a standalone PFCP session not tied
to any PDU session.
Each PDR shall contain a PDI, i.e. one or more match fields against which
incoming packets are matched, and may be associated to the following rules
providing the set of instructions to apply to packets matching the PDI:
\- one or more FARs, which contains instructions related to the processing of
the packets as follows:
\- an Apply Action parameter, which indicates whether the UP function shall
forward, duplicate, drop or buffer the packet with or without notifying the CP
function about the arrival of a DL packet, or whether the UP function shall
accept or deny UE requests to join an IP multicast group;
\- forwarding, buffering and/or duplicating parameters, which the UP function
shall use if the Apply Action parameter requests the packets to be forwarded,
buffered or duplicated respectively. These parameters may remain configured in
the FAR regardless of the Apply Action parameter value, to minimize the
changes to the FAR during the transitions of the UE between the idle and
connected modes. The buffering parameters, when present, shall be provisioned
in a BAR created at the PFCP session level and referenced by the FAR.
NOTE 1: Buffering refers here to the buffering of the packet in the UP
function. The UP function is instructed to forward DL packets to the CP
function when applying buffering in the CP function. See clause 5.3.1.
\- zero, one or more QERs, which contains instructions related to the QoS
enforcement of the traffic;
\- zero, one or more URRs, which contains instructions related to traffic
measurement and reporting.
\- zero or one MAR, which contains instructions related to Access Traffic
Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSSS) for the downlink traffic of a Multi-
Access (MA) PDU session. See clause 5.2.7.
NOTE 2: A downlink PDR can be associated with two FARs for a N4 session
established for a MA PDU session as a MAR contains two FARs for 3GPP and
non-3GPP respectively.
A FAR, a QER, a URR and a MAR shall only be associated to one or multiple PDRs
of the same PFCP session context.
The QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID shall be assigned by the CP function
to correlate QERs from multiple PFCP session contexts. For instance, the
enforcement of APN-AMBR in the PGW-U shall be achieved by setting the same QoS
Enforcement Rule Correlation ID to the QERs from different PFCP sessions
associated with all the PDRs corresponding to the non-GBR bearers of all the
UE\'s PDN connections to the same APN. The QERs that are associated to the
same QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID in multiple PFCP sessions shall be
provisioned, with the same QER contents, in each of these PFCP sessions. The
QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID shall be only used to enforce the APN-AMBR
when the UE is in EPC, it may be provided by the CP function over N4 to the UP
function for a PDU session may move to EPC in a later stage.
The following principles shall apply for the provisioning of PDRs in the UP
function:
\- Every PDR provisioned for a PFCP session shall allow to identify the PFCP
session, i.e. every PDR shall contain the information element(s) to identify
the PFCP session, which is either a Traffic Endpoint Identifier (if the PDI
Optimization feature is supported) or equivalent information, e.g. UE IP
address, Local F-TEID, Frame-Route, in the PDI IE.
\- The CP function shall not provision more than one PDR with the same match
fields in the PDI (i.e. with the same set of match fields and with the same
value). The CP function may provision PDRs with the same value for a subset of
the match fields of the PDI but not all;
\- different PDRs of a same PFCP session may overlap, e.g. the CP function may
provision two PDRs which differ by having one match field set to a specific
value in one PDR and the same match field not included in the other PDR (thus
matching any possible value);
\- different PDRs of different PFCP sessions, not including the Packet
Replication and Detection Carry-On Information IE, shall not overlap, i.e.
PDRs in each PFCP session shall differ by at least one different (and not
wildcarded) match field in their PDI, such that any incoming user plane packet
may only match PDRs of a single PFCP session;
\- As an exception to the previous principle, the CP function may provision a
PDR with all match fields wildcarded (i.e. all match fields omitted in the
PDI) in a separate PFCP session, to control how the UP function shall process
packets unmatched by any PDRs of any other PFCP session. The CP function may
provision the UP function to send these packets to the CP function or to drop
them. The UP function shall grant the lowest precedence to this PDR.
\- different PDRs of different PFCP sessions, including the Packet Replication
and Detection Carry-On Information IE, may overlap. The Detection Carry-On
Indication indicates that the UP function shall proceed with the look-up of
other PDRs of other PFCP sessions matching the packet. This is used for
broadcast traffic forwarding in 5G VN Group Communication.
\- different downlink PDRs of different PFCP sessions, with a PDI including
the IP multicast IP address IE, may overlap. The UP function shall proceed
with the look-up of other PDRs of other PFCP sessions matching the packet.
This is used for downlink IP multicast traffic for IPTV service (see clause
5.25).
On receipt of a user plane packet, the UP function shall perform a lookup of
the provisioned PDRs in the UP function to identify only one PDR in a PFCP
session according to the following steps:
\- identify first the PFCP session to which the packet corresponds; and
\- find the first PDR matching the incoming packet, among all the PDRs
provisioned for this PFCP session, starting with the PDRs with the highest
precedence and continuing then with PDRs in decreasing order of precedence.
Only the highest precedence PDR matching the packet shall be selected, i.e.
the UP function shall stop the PDRs lookup once a matching PDR is found.
A packet matches a PDR if all the match fields which are identified with
different IE type in the PDI of the PDR are matching the corresponding packet
header fields unless specified otherwise. If a match field is not included in
the PDI, it shall be considered as matching all possible values in the header
field of the packet. If the match field is present and does not include a
mask, the match field shall be considered as matching the corresponding header
field of the packet if it has the same value. If the match field is present
and includes a mask (e.g. IP address with a prefix mask), the match field
shall be considered as matching the corresponding header field of the packet
if it has the same value for the bits which are set in the mask. If a match
field has multiple instances, i.e. there are several IEs with the same IE
type, a packet matches this match field if any instance is matching the
corresponding packet header field.
The match fields of the PDI shall correspond to outer and/or inner packet
header fields, e.g. uplink bearer binding verification in the PGW-U may be
achieved by configuring a PDR with the PDI containing the local GTP-U F-TEID
(for outer IP packet matching) and the SDF filters of the data flows mapped to
the bearer (for inner IP packet matching).
NOTE 3: A DL PDR can be provisioned with a UE IP address together with a
Framed-Route or a Framed-IPv6-Rotue either in the PDI IE or in the Create
Traffic Endpoint IE; in such case, the PDR is matched if the packet matches
either the UE IP address or the Framed-Route (Framed-IPv6-Route).
When one or more pre-defined PDR(s) are activated for a given PDR (see clause
5.19), an incoming packet matches the PDR if it matches one of activated pre-
defined PDR(s).
The UP function should drop packets unmatched by any PDRs.
The packet processing flow in the UP function is illustrated in Figure
5.2.1-1.
Figure 5.2.1-1: Packet processing flow in the UP function
At the deletion of a PFCP session, the UP function shall delete the PFCP
session context and all the associated non-preconfigured rules.
NOTE 4: Deleting a QER in one PFCP session does not result in deleting another
QER in another PFCP session even when these two QERs have the same QER ID
and/or are associated with the same QER Correlation ID.
A UP Function controlled by multiple CP functions shall handle Rule IDs from
the different CP functions independently from each other.
Rule ID used for PDR, FAR, BAR, QER, URR or MAR is uniquely identifying a rule
of the corresponding rule type within a session.
For an MA-PDU session, IP addresses translation for MPTCP traffic (see Annex
E.3) is independent from the handling of URR/QER/BAR, but it shall be
performed before applying the FAR (e.g. before creating the outer header and
forwarding the packet).
### 5.2.1A Packet Detection Rule Handling
#### 5.2.1A.1 General
When provisioning a PDR in the UP function, the CP function shall provide the
PDI with the following information:
\- the source interface of the incoming packets;
\- a combination of the parameters, that incoming packets are requested to
match, among: Local F-TEID, Network Instance, UE IP address(es), SDF Filter(s)
and/or Application ID. For 5GC, the PDI may additionally contain one or more
QFI(s) to detect traffic pertaining to specific QoS flow(s), Ethernet Packet
Filter(s) and/or Ethernet PDU Session Information (see clause 5.13.1).
The requirements for provisioning an SDF filter in the PDI are specified in
clauses 5.2.1A.2A and 5.2.1A.3.
The CP function may provision the parameters, that incoming packets are
requested to match, in the UP function by:
\- providing the parameters individually in each PDI of the PFCP session; or
\- optionally, if the PDI Optimization feature is supported by the UP
function, by providing the parameters which may be common to multiple PDIs of
a same PFCP session in a Traffic Endpoint IE and by referencing this Traffic
Endpoint in the PDI(s) of the PFCP session. See clause 5.2.1A.2. A Traffic
Endpoint may include a Local F-TEID, Network Instance, UE IP address(es)
and/or Ethernet PDU Session Information (see clause 5.13.1).
NOTE: A Traffic Endpoint can correspond to a GTP-u endpoint, an SGi or an N6
endpoint.
#### 5.2.1A.2 PDI Optimization
PDI Optimization is an optional feature which may be supported by the CP and
UP Functions. This feature allows the CP function to optimize the signaling
towards the UP function by creating the information that are common to
multiple PDRs as a Traffic Endpoint with a Traffic Endpoint ID and then
referring to this common information from multiple PDRs. The Traffic Endpoint
ID shall be unique within a PFCP session. If MTE feature is supported, one PDI
may refer to more than one Traffic Endpoints. When a PDI refers to a Traffic
Endpoint, the parameters that are in the Traffic Endpoint shall not be once
again provided in the PDI. The CP function may update the Traffic Endpoint at
any time.
If a Traffic Endpoint is updated, all the PDRs that refer to this Traffic
Endpoint in the UP function shall use the updated information.
The UP function shall allocate and store the F-TEID associated to the Traffic
Endpoint. When the UP function provides the allocated F-TEID to the CP
function in the PFCP Session Establishment response or PFCP Session
Modification response message, the CP function shall update the Traffic
Endpoint information stored in the CP function with the received F-TEID.
The CP function should use a Traffic Endpoint ID created in a different PFCP
message only after getting the confirmation from the UP function of the
Traffic Endpoint ID creation.
If the CP function deletes a Traffic Endpoint, the UP Function shall delete
all the PDRs that refer to this Traffic Endpoint.
NOTE 1: The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.1 for reporting usage
reports to the CP function also apply if the deletion of the Traffic Endpoint
results in deleting the last PDR associated to a URR.
NOTE2: For EPC, the Remove Traffic Endpoint IE can be used to delete a bearer
for which multiple PDRs exist (with the same Traffic Endpoint ID).
#### 5.2.1A.2A Provisioning of SDF filters
When provisioning an SDF Filter in a PDI, the CP function shall:
\- copy the Flow Description if it is received from the PCRF (or PCF), in the
corresponding PDI of a PDR regardless of whether the PDR is for matching
uplink or downlink traffic;
NOTE 1 The Flow Description received from the PCRF (or PCF) is set assuming
downlink flows only, see clause 5.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. The CP function
uses the Flow-Direction AVP received from the PCRF (or PCF) to determine the
actual direction and thus the source interface of the packet flows described
in the Flow Description.
\- for traffic from CP-function or SGi-LAN:
\- If the traffic is intended to be forwarded to the UE, the CP function shall
provision the Flow Description with IPFilterRule \"source\" parameters set to
correspond to the CP function or SGi-LAN and the IPFilterRule \"destination\"
parameters correspond to the UE;
\- If the traffic is intended to be forwarded to the PDN, the CP function
shall provision the Flow Description with IPFilterRule \"source\" parameters
set to correspond to the CP function or SGi-LAN and the IPFilterRule
\"destination\" parameters correspond to the PDN.
The UP function shall apply the SDF filter based on the Source Interface of
the PDR as follows (see also clause 8.2.5):
\- when the Source Interface is CORE, this indicates that the filter is for
downlink data flow, so the UP function shall apply the Flow Description as is;
\- when the Source Interface is ACCESS, this indicates that the filter is for
uplink data flow, so the UP function shall swap the source and destination
address/port in the Flow Description;
\- when the Source Interface is CP-function or SGi-LAN, the UP function shall
use the Flow Description as is.
#### 5.2.1A.3 Bidirectional SDF Filters
The CP function may provision bidirectional SDF Filters in the UP function
(see clause 8.2.5), i.e. SDF Filters that may be associated to both uplink and
downlink PDRs of a same PFCP/N4 session, as follows:
\- when provisioning a bidirectional SDF Filter the first time for a PFCP/N4
session, the CP function shall provision the SDF filter definition together
with a SDF Filter ID uniquely identifying the SDF Filter among all the SDF
Filters provisioned for a given PFCP/N4 Session;
\- the CP function may then provision a PDR for the same PFCP/N4 session but
the opposite direction, by provisioning the SDF Filter ID in the SDF filter ID
field of the PDI, without provisioning again the SDF filter definition;
\- the UP function shall apply any modification of a bidirectional SDF Filter
to all PDRs of the PFCP/N4 session making use of this SDF Filter;
\- upon deletion of a PDR making use of a bidirectional SDF Filter, the UP
function shall still apply the SDF Filter for any other PDR making use of the
SDF Filter.
The requirements specified for provisioning SDF filters in clause 5.2.1A.2A
shall also apply when provisioning bidirectional SDF Filters.
#### 5.2.1A.4 Application detection with PFD
The detection information for a given application may be provisioned by the CP
function to the UP function via PFD management procedure. See clause 6.2.5.
The PFDE (PFD Enhancement) feature may be optionally supported by the CP
function and UP function. When the feature is supported in both the CP
function and UP function, the CP function may provision a PFD Contents IE
including a property (i.e. either flow description, or URL or Domain
Name/Domain Name Protocol) with multiple values.
NOTE 1: It is assumed, when the PFDE feature is not supported, a PFD Contents
can only include a property with one value.
When the UP function attempts to detect the traffic pertaining to an
application by using the application\'s PFDs (see clause 7.4.3.1 and 8.2.39),
the UP function shall consider:
\- the application is detected if the incoming traffic matches at least one
PFD Contents;
\- one PFD Contents is matched if the incoming traffic matches every property
contained in the corresponding PFD Contents IE;
\- the incoming traffic matches one property (i.e. flow description, URL and
Domain Name/Domain Name Protocol) if it matches at least one value of the
property.
NOTE 2: Interpretation of the Custom PFD Content is implementation specific.
### 5.2.2 Usage Reporting Rule Handling
#### 5.2.2.1 General
The CP function shall provision URR(s) for a PFCP session in a PFCP Session
Establishment Request or a PFCP Session Modification Request to request the UP
function to:
\- measure the network resources usage in terms of traffic data volume,
duration (i.e. time) and/or events, according to the provisioned Measurement
Method; and
\- send a usage report to the CP function, when the measurement reaches a
certain threshold, periodically or when detecting a certain event, according
to the provisioned Reporting Triggers or when an immediate report is requested
within a PFCP Session Modification Request.
NOTE: The UP function sends a usage report without performing network
resources usage measurements when being requested to detect and report the
start of an SDF or application traffic.
#### 5.2.2.2 Provisioning of Usage Reporting Rule in the UP function
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
When provisioning a URR, the CP function shall provide the reporting
trigger(s) in the Reporting Triggers IE of the URR which shall cause the UP
function to generate and send a Usage Report for this URR to the CP function.
When adding or removing reporting trigger(s) to or from the URR, the CP
function shall provide the new complete list of applicable reporting triggers
in the Reporting Triggers IE in the PFCP Session Modification Request message.
For the volume-based measurement method, the CP function may provision:
\- the Volume Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage
report when the measured traffic reaches the threshold;
\- the Volume Quota IE, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets
(or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on
operator policy in the UP function) and, if no Volume Threshold is
provisioned, to also generate a usage report, when the measured traffic
reaches the quota;
\- the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate
a usage report when the downlink traffic that is being dropped reaches the
threshold; and/or
NOTE 1: For EPC, the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold can be armed in a SGW-U for
triggering the PGW Pause of Charging feature (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]). For
5GC, the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold can be armed in a UPF for triggering the
SMF Pause of Charging feature (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [29]).
\- a Measurement Information with the \'Measurement Before QoS Enforcement\'
flag set to \"1\", to request the UP function to measure the traffic usage
before any enforcement, e.g. bitrate enforcement for QoS, Gate control
enforcement (as specified in clause 5.4.3) or packets dropped as requested by
the FAR.
\- a Measurement Information with the \'Measurement of Number of Packets\'
flag set to \"1\", to request the UP function to measure the number of packets
be transferred in UL/DL/Total in addition to the measurement in octets, if the
UP function supports the MNOP feature.
For the time-based measurement method, the CP function may provision:
\- a Time Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage report
when the measured traffic reaches the threshold;
\- a Time Quota, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets (or
only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator
policy in the UP function) and, if no Time Threshold is provisioned, to also
generate a usage report, when the measured traffic reaches the quota;
\- a Measurement Information with the \"Immediate Start Time Metering\" flag
set to \"1\", to request the UP function to start time metering immediately at
receiving the flag; otherwise, the UP function shall start time metering when
the first packet is received; and/or
\- an Inactivity Detection Time, to request the UP function to suspend the
time measurement when no packets are received during the provisioned
Inactivity Detection Time. The time measurement shall then be resumed by the
UP function when subsequent traffic is received. If an Inactivity Detection
Time value of zero is provided, or if no Inactivity Detection Time has been
provided by the CP function, the time measurement shall be performed
continuously until a new non-zero Inactivity Detection Time is received or the
time-based usage measurement is stopped. See Figure 5.2.2.2-1:
Figure 5.2.2.2-1: IDT based charging
NOTE 2: The Inactivity Detection Time can be set to the Quota Consumption
Timer if received. The Inactivity Detection Time is not used to control when
the time metering starts.
\- For EPC, a Time Quota Mechanism, including a Base Time Interval Type, which
is either Continuous Time Period (CTP) or Discrete Time Period (DTP), and a
Base Time Interval (BTI), to the UP function. See clause 6.5.7 in 3GPP TS
32.299 [18].
\- For CTP (Continuous Time Period), the time measurement starts from the time
that traffic has occurred up to the first Base Time Interval (BTI) which
contains no traffic. The time measurement shall include the last Base Time
Interval, i.e. the one which contained no traffic. The time measurement
resumes by the UP function when subsequent traffic is received. See Figure
5.2.2.2-2:
Figure 5.2.2.2-2: CTP based charging
\- For DTP (Descrete Time Period), the time measurement starts from the time
that traffic has occurred up to the Base Time Interval end. The time
measurement shall be resumed by the UP function when subsequent traffic is
received. See Figure 5.2.2.2-3:
Figure 5.2.2.2-3: DTP based charging
When the time-based measurement method applies, and when the Envelope
Reporting is required for EPC, the CP function shall request the UP function
to report the usage by setting the reporting trigger to Envelope Closure in
addition to other Reporting Trigger(s), in the Reporting Triggers IE. The CP
function may indicate the UP function to report for just time, time and
volume, time and events, or time and volume and number of events by setting
Measurement Method accordingly. The CP function may set the Reduced
Application Detection Information flag in the Measurement Information of the
URR, when requesting the detection of start and stop of an application solely
for the purpose of envelope reporting for EPC.
The CP function may provision a Volume Threshold IE, a Volume Quota IE, or
both (and/or respectively a Time/Event Threshold IE, a Time/Event Quota IE, or
both). In such a case, the CP function may set the reporting trigger for
threshold (VOLTH/TIMTH/EVETH) and/or the reporting trigger for quota
(VOLQU/TIMQU/EVEQU)) in the Reporting Triggers IE.
When both a Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE and a Volume (or Time or
Event) Quota IE are provisioned and only the reporting trigger for threshold
(VOLTH/TIMTH/EVETH) is set, the UP function shall send a usage report only
when reaching the Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold. When subsequently
reaching the Volume (or Time or Event) Quota, the UP function shall stop
forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane
traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) without sending a new
usage report to the CP function.
If both a Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE and a Volume (or Time or
Event) Quota IE are provisioned and both of the respective Threshold and Quota
reporting triggers are set, the UP function shall send a usage report when
reaching the Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold and also later on when
subsequently reaching the Volume (or Time or Event) Quota.
NOTE 3: A UP Function complying with Release 14 or Release 15 of the
specification only sends one usage report when the threshold is reached, even
if both reporting triggers (for the threshold and the quota) are set.
NOTE 4: After sending a usage report on reaching a threshold, the UP function
typically gets a new quota before the earlier provisioned quota exhausts. This
implies that the UP function typically sends a quota report when reaching the
final quota.
NOTE 5: For online charging, the Volume Threshold (or Time Threshold) can be
set in a PGW-U or TDF-U to the value of the granted volume (or time) quota
minus the volume (or time) quota threshold, such as to get a usage report from
the UP function when the volume (or time) based credit falls below the
remaining quota thresholds provided by the OCS.
NOTE 6: The Volume Quota or Time Quota can be armed in a PGW-U or TDF-U for
online charging to enable the traffic to be forwarded up to an intermediate or
final quotas granted by the OCS. The CP function can provision both a Volume
(or Time) Threshold and a Volume (or Time) Threshold to request the UP
function to:\ \- send a usage report when the consumed resources reach the
volume (or time) usage threshold provided by the OCS, and\ \- to stop
forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane
traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function), without sending a
second usage report, when the granted volume (or time) quota is exhausted.
For event based measurement method, the CP function may provision:
\- the Event Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage
report when the number of events reaches the event threshold;
\- the Event Quota IE, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets
applicable to the event (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane
traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) and, if no Event
threshold is provisioned, to also generate a usage report, when the number of
events reaches the event quota;
NOTE 7: An event is preconfigured with one or more event detection logic in
the UPF. Each event detection logic is associated with an Application ID. The
CP function activates the detection and reporting of an event by provisioning
PDR(s) with the PDI set to an Application ID and by provisioning a URR with an
event threshold or event quota reporting trigger. The CP function identifies
an event reported in a Usage Report by the URR ID.
For all the measurement methods (i.e. volume, time or event), the CP function
may also provision:
\- a Quota Holding Time, to request the UP function to send a usage report and
to also stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user
plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) when no packets
have been received for the duration indicated in this parameter;
NOTE 8: A Quota Holding Time can be armed in a PGW-U or TDF-U for online
charging to request the UP function to send a Usage Report when the Quota
Holding Time provided by the OCS (see 3GPP TS 32.299 [18]) expires. The UP
function can be instructed in the same Usage Reporting Rule with the Report
Triggers -- START to generate a new Usage Report upon receiving any subsequent
packets associated with this URR.
> \- a Quota Validity Time, if the VTIME feature is supported by UP function,
> to request the UP function to send a usage report after the validity
> duration is over. After Quota validity timer expiry, if packets are received
> on UPF, the UPF shall stop forwarding packets or only allow forwarding of
> limited user plane traffic, based on operator\'s policy in the UP function;
NOTE 9: After sending the usage report triggered by the QUHTI or QUVTI (i.e.
the Quota Holding Time or Quota Validity Time expires), any remaining quota
for the URR is discarded in the UP function.
\- a Monitoring Time IE and zero or more Additional Monitoring IEs, to request
the UP function to measure the network resources usage before and after the
monitoring time in separate counts and to re-apply the volume and/or time,
and/or event thresholds at the monitoring time. The CP function may
additionally provision a Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE
and/or a Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Quota IE, for a volume (or time
or event) based measurement. When being provisioned with a Monitoring Time,
the UP function shall:
\- reset its usage thresholds at the monitoring time to the value provided in
the Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE, if provisioned in the
URR, or to the remaining value of the Volume (or Time or Event) threshold used
before the monitoring time (i.e. excluding the already accumulated volume or
time usage);
\- shall indicate the usage up to the Monitoring time and usage after the
Monitoring time in the first usage report after the Monitoring Time is
reached;
\- an Measurement Period, indicating the period to generate periodic usage
reports to the CP function.
If the UP function indicated support of the Quota Action feature in the UP
Function Features IE, when the CP function provisions a Volume Quota or Time
Quota in a URR, the CP function may also provision the \"FAR ID for Quota
Action\" IE identifying the substitute FAR the UP function shall apply, for
the traffic identified by the PDR to which the URR is associated, when
exhausting any of these quotas. This FAR may require the UP function to drop
the packets or buffer the packets or redirect the traffic towards a redirect
destination as specified in clause 5.4.7.
NOTE 10: A PDR can be associated with multiple URRs. If one of these URRs
requires the UP function to drop the user data packets, e.g. when the Quota
has been exhausted, the other URRs associated to the PDR need also to stop
their measurements, except for URRs including the Measurement Information with
the \'Measurement Before QoS Enforcement\' flag set to \"1\".
The CP function may request at any time the UP function to activate or
deactivate a network resources usage measurement, using the Inactive
Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR.
NOTE 11: This can be used in a PGW-U for the PGW Pause of Charging procedure
(see 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]).
The CP function may request the UP function to measure network resources usage
and generate the corresponding Usage Reports only for a number of times, by
provisioning the \"Number of Reports\" IE in a URR, if the UP function
supports the NORP feature (see clause 8.2.25-1). If so, the URR shall become
inactive in the UP function after the requested \"Number of Reports\" have
been reported.
The CP function may resume the measurement for an inactive URR by setting the
Inactive Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR to
\"0\" in the Update URR IE in a PFCP Session Modification Request message,
with or without the Number of Report IE. If the CP function wishes the UP
function to perform continuous measurement for a URR which was provisioned
with a Number of Reports (i.e. to no longer limit the number of reports to be
generated), the CP function shall provide the Number of Reports IE in the
Update URR with a null length to delete the limit on the number of reports to
be generated.
NOTE 12: The Number of Reports can be provisioned in a URR regardless which
Measurement Method is used.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Credit pooling (for EPC)
For EPC, when the Credit Pool feature is supported and the CP function (e.g.
PGW-C) is instructed to handle a Credit Pool for a given Gy Session, the CP
function shall create a URR for the Credit Pool, and in this URR, the CP
function:
\- shall include one Aggregated URR ID IE per URR sharing the credit pool,
including the URR ID of the URR sharing the credit pool and the associated
Multiplier to measure the abstract service units the corresponding traffic
consumes from the credit pool;
\- shall set the Time or Volume Threshold or Quota IE to the value calculated
as specified in IETF RFC 4006 [16] according to the Measurement Method.
> NOTE 1: The value can be calculated using the following formula:
>
> S = Q1*M1 + Q2*M2 + ... + Qn*Mn,\ where the S is the quota for the credit
> pool, Qn is the quota and Mn is the multiplier for each Rating Group (RG)
> which are provided via the Multiple Services Credit Control from the OCS.\
> An URRn is defined for each of RG.
>
> NOTE 2: When the Measurement Method is set to the combined volume/duration,
> the Time and Volume Threshold or Quota are calculated independently.
\- may set the Reporting Trigger to reporting upon reaching a volume or time
threshold or quota;
\- may set the Measurement Method to the data volume, duration (i.e. time),
combined volume/duration according to the Measurement Method set in the URRs
in the Credit Pool.
> NOTE 3: The UP function is instructed to handle a Credit Pool when a G-S-U-
> Pool-Reference AVP is included within a Multiple Services Credit Control
> from the OCS. A Credit Pool is identified by the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP.
> See clause 6.3.11, 6.4.3 and 6.4.4 of 3GPP TS 32.299 [18].
In addition, the CP function shall also include the Linked URR IE, set to the
Credit Pool URR ID, in all the URRs which are sharing the credit pool (i.e.
which are associated with RGs sharing the Credit Pool).
#### 5.2.2.3 Reporting of Usage Report to the CP function
##### 5.2.2.3.1 General
When detecting that a provisioned reporting trigger occurs, the UP function
shall generate a Usage Report for the related URR and send it to the CP
function by initiating the PFCP Session Report procedure.
When providing usage report information for a URR in a message, the UP
function shall include the UR-SEQN (Usage Report Sequence Number) identifying
the order in which a Usage Report is generated for the given URR. The UR-SEQN
(Usage Report Sequence Number) shall be set to \"0\" for the first Usage
Report and incremented for every subsequent Usage Report generated by the UP
function for the URR. The UP function shall also indicate the trigger that
causes the usage report to be generated in the Usage Report Trigger IE.
Upon generating a usage report for a URR towards the CP function, the UP
function shall:
\- reset its ongoing measurement counts for the related URR (i.e. the UP
function shall report in a usage report the network resources usage
measurement since the last usage report for that URR);
\- re-apply all the thresholds (Volume/Time/Event Threshold) provisioned for
the related URR, if the usage report was triggered due to one of the
thresholds being reached, i.e. upon the reporting triggers VOLTH/TIMTH/EVETH;
and
\- adjust the threshold and/or quota for volume/time/event (if provisioned in
the URR) respectively by subtracting the (volume/time/event) reported usage in
the usage report to determine when to generate the next report, if the usage
report trigger is set with PERIO/LIUSA/ENVCL/STOPT; and
\- continue to apply the remaining provisioned parameters in the URR and
perform the related network resources usage measurement(s), until getting any
further instruction from the CP function.
When receiving a new threshold or quota from the CP function for a measurement
that is already ongoing in the UP function, the UP function shall consider its
ongoing measurements counts for the related URR against the new threshold or
quota to determine when to send its next usage report to the CP function.
At receiving a quota with value set to zero, the UP function shall:
\- apply the FAR identified in the FAR ID for Quota Action IE if the CP
function has provisioned it, otherwise the UP function shall stop forwarding
packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on
operator policy in the UP function); and
\- report in a usage report the network resources usage measurement since the
last usage report for that URR, if applicable.
When the UP function receives a non-zero quota for the same URR in one
subsequent PFCP Session Modification Request message, the UP function shall
apply the (normal) FAR associated with the PDR (detecting the application
traffic) for the buffered traffic if the FAR ID for Quota Action was set to
buffer the application traffic at zero quota (either be provisioned with zero
quota earlier or the quota has been exhausted).
NOTE 1: The UP function determines when to send its next usage report to the
CP function by deducting from the newly provisioned threshold or quota the
traffic it has forwarded since its last usage report. As an example, if the UP
function has forwarded 10 Mbytes of traffic since it last usage report to the
CP function and the CP function provisions a new volume threshold or quota of
100 Mbytes, the UP function sends its next usage report upon forwarding an
additional 90 Mbytes traffic.
NOTE 2: When receiving a new threshold or quota from the CP function for a
measurement that is already ongoing in the UP function and if the UP function
has already generated the usage report but had not sent it, the UP function
can send the usage report before performing the update of the URR.
NOTE 3: A URR with the quota set to 0 can be provisioned when a service data
flow is not allowed to start before quota is allocated to the service. See
clause 5.4.11.
When reporting the network resources usage before and after a Monitoring Time,
the UP function shall send two Usage Reports in the PFCP message (e.g. PFCP
Session Report Request) for the same URR ID. Each Usage Report shall then
include the Usage Information IE indicating whether the reported network
resource usage was consumed before or after the Monitoring Time. Omission of
this IE in a Usage Report indicates that no monitoring time has occurred. The
UP function shall send Usage Reports soon after the occurrence of the
Monitoring Time.
NOTE 4: The UP function needs to take care to smooth the signalling load
towards the CP function if Usage Reports need to be generated for a large
number of PFCP sessions after the occurrence of the Monitoring Time.
For the volume-based measurement method, the UP function shall report the
traffic usage after any QoS enforcement. Additionally, if the CP function
requested to measure the traffic usage before QoS enforcement, the UP function
shall also report corresponding measurements, when measurements needs to be
reported for the traffic usage after QoS enforcement, by sending two Usage
Reports in the PFCP message (e.g. PFCP Session Report Request) for the same
URR ID. Each Usage Report shall then include the Usage Information IE
indicating whether the reported network resource usage corresponds to the
traffic before or after QoS enforcement. Thresholds provisioned in a URR shall
apply to the traffic usage after any QoS enforcement.
For the volume-based measurement method, the UP function shall include all the
counters (Total, Uplink and Downlink) of the URR in the Volume Measurement IE
in the Usage Report IE; the UP function shall also include the number of
packets counted for Total, Uplink, Downlink in the Volume Measurement IE if
requested by the CP function and if the UP function supports the MNOP feature.
A usage report triggered only due to the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold (DROTH)
or Start of Traffic (START), or MAC Address Reporting (MACAR), or IP Multicast
Join/Leave (IPMJL) shall not contain any measurement information, i.e. either
the Volume/Duration Measurement set to zero or Volume/Duration Measurement IE
is not present.
When being instructed to remove a URR or the last PDR associated to a URR, the
UP function shall stop its ongoing measurements for the URR and include a
Usage Report in the PFCP Session Modification Response or in an additional
PFCP Session Report Request if there are non-null measurements to report for
the URR. When being instructed to remove the last PDR associated to a URR, the
UP function shall keep the URR and reset any measurement for the URR.
NOTE 5: A URR provisioned in a PFCP session can be provisioned/kept in the UP
function without being associated with any PDR and the URR can be associated
with a PDR in a later stage. The UP function will not remember any remaining
quota and will consider the quota (if provisioned) as it was provisioned.
When being instructed to deactivate a network resources usage measurement via
the Inactive Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR,
the UP function shall stop measuring the network resources usage (against the
volume/time/event threshold/quota) and store the current measurement counts
which will be resumed when the URR is activated again. The UP function shall
not generate a usage report upon the deactivation of the URR and it shall send
a usage report during the period when the URR is deactivated for the following
scenarios:
\- if the Quota Holding Time is expired and if the reporting trigger QUHTI is
set;
NOTE 6: The Quota Holding Time can have been started before the URR is
deactivated or starts from the moment when the URR is deactivated since no
quota will be consumed.
\- if it is the time for a periodic reporting and if the reporting trigger
PERIO is set;
\- if it is required to send a usage report for this URR when a usage report
is reported for a linked URR and if the reporting trigger LIUSA is set;
\- if it is required to send an immeditate report upon a query for the URR, or
the URR is removed, dissociated from the last PDR.
NOTE 7: Multiple usage reports can be required to be reported to the CP
function when deleting a PDR that is the last one to be associated to multiple
URRs.
The CP function may request the UP function, in a PFCP Session Modification
Request, to report its ongoing network resources measurement for one or
multiple URRs of the PFCP session. In this case, the UP function shall:
\- generate usage report(s) (based on the existing definition of any URR(s)
included in the PFCP Session Modification Request message before any update)
for the URR(s) being queried and for any associated linked usage reports (see
clause 5.2.2.4) for which there are non-null measurements to report;
\- include them in the PFCP Session Modification Response or in additional
PFCP Session Report Request messages; and
\- proceed as specified above upon generating a usage report for a URR towards
the CP function, with the following additions:
\- if the PFCP Session Modification Request includes the Update URR IE (for
the URR being queried) with a Volume or Time Threshold, the UP function shall
re-apply the threshold received in the request;
\- otherwise, if a threshold and/or a quota had been set for the URR that is
queried, since the usage report is not triggered due to the threshold being
reached, the UP function shall adjust the threshold and/or quota by
subtracting the time/volume reported in the usage report to determine when to
generate the next report.
NOTE 8: Upon reaching a threshold that was adjusted due to a URR query as
specified above, the UP function re-applies then the threshold that was
provisioned in the URR (i.e. not the value of the adjusted threshold).
NOTE 9: The CP function can query a URR without including a Volume or Time
Threshold in the PFCP Session Modification Request e.g. when it needs to close
a traffic volume/service container (see clause 5.2.3.10.3 of 3GPP TS 32.251
[17]).
NOTE 10: The CP function can query a URR including a Volume or Time Threshold
in the PFCP Session Modification Request e.g. when it needs to close a CDR
(see clause 5.2.3.10.3 of 3GPP TS 32.251 [17]). In such a case, the CP
function can include the same threshold for the URR being queried in the
Update URR IE in the PFCP Session Modification Request message to trigger the
UP function to re-apply the threshold.
NOTE 11: It is up to the CP function to request the UP function to generate an
immediate report (or not) as specified above when the CP function modifies a
URR or any other rules of the PFCP session. As an exception, the UP function
always generates an immediate report when being instructed to remove a URR.
When additional usage reports need to be sent in additional PFCP Session
Report Request messages, i.e. when not all usage reports can be included in
the PFCP Session Modification/Deletion Response message, the UP function shall
indicate, in the PFCP Session Modification/Deletion Response message, either:
\- that more usage reports will follow, by setting the AURI flag to 1 in the
Additional Usage Reports Information IE (see clause 8.2.91); or
\- the total number of additional usage reports that will be sent in all the
additional PFCP Session Report Request messages (i.e. that will be sent after
the PFCP Session Modification/Deletion Response message), by setting this
value in the Additional Usage Reports Information IE (see clause 8.2.91).
In the former case (i.e. if the UP function indicates in the PFCP Session
Modification/Deletion Response message that more usage reports will follow),
the UP function shall indicate, in one of the additional PFCP Session Report
Request message, the total number of additional usage reports to be sent after
the PFCP Session Modification/Deletion Response message, by setting this value
in the Additional Usage Reports Information IE. In both cases, the UP function
may set the AURI flag to 1 in every additional PFCP Session Report Request
message but the last one, to indicate that more usage reports will follow.
Besides, if the PFCP Session Modification Request included the Query URR
Reference IE, usage reports sent in response to the query in the PFCP Session
Modification Response and/or additional PFCP Session Report Request messages
shall include the Query URR Reference IE set to the same value as received in
the PFCP Session Modification Request.
When the reporting trigger \"Envelope Closure\" is set in the corresponding
Usage Reporting Rule, the UP function shall generate a usage report with the
measurement of the time and/or volume as instructed in the Measurement Method:
\- when the Inactivity Detection Time (if included) is expired;
\- when detecting no usage for the first Base Time Interval if the Base Time
Interval Type in the Time Quota Mechanism is set to CTP; or
\- at the end of each of base time interval if the Base Time Interval Type in
the Time Quota Mechanism is set to DTP.
NOTE 12: Events (e.g. application detection information) are reported
individually and independently from the usage report sent for envelope
closure.
When the UP function supports the NORP feature and if a URR is provisioned
with a \"Number of Reports\" IE, the number of Usage Reports generated
according to the Reporting Trigger(s) defined in the URR shall not be more
than the value of \"Number of Reports\". If the UP function is requested to
resume the measurement for an inactive URR, the UP function shall generate a
maximum number of Usage Reports equal to the new value of the Number of
Reports IE received in the Update URR if any, or equal to the value of the
Number of Reports IE previously provisioned in the URR if any; if no Number of
Reports IE was provisioned before, there is no limit on the number of reports
to send.
At the PFCP session termination, the UP function shall indicate to the CP
function, in the PFCP Session Deletion Response, the resources that have been
consumed for each URR that was provisioned in the PFCP session since the last
usage report (respective to each URR). A CP function may indicate support of
Additional Usage Reports in PFCP Session Deletion Request by setting the ARDR
flag in the CP Function Features IE (see clause 8.2.58). When additional PFCP
Session Report Request messages need to be sent:
\- the UP function shall:
\- set the cause to \"More Usage Report to send\" in the PFCP Session Deletion
Response;
\- include the Additional Usage Reports Information IE in PFCP Session
Deletion Response with either the AURI flag set to \"1\" or indicating the
total number of additional usage reports that will be sent in all the
additional PFCP Session Report Request messages; as described above:
\- in the former case, the UP function shall indicate in one additional PFCP
Session Report Request message the total number of additional usage reports
that will be sent after the PFCP Session Deletion Response;
\- in both cases, the UP function may set the AURI flag to 1 in every
additional PFCP Session Report Request message but the last one, to indicate
that more usage reports will follow.
\- set the PSDBU flag to 1 in the last PFCP Session Report Request message.
\- when the CP function receives a PFCP Session Deletion Response with the
Cause set to \"More Usage Report to send\", the CP function shall not delete
the PFCP session until it receives a PFCP Session Report Request message with
the PSDBU flag set to \"1\" (that indicates this is the last report), or until
an implementation specific timer expires otherwise.
Upon receiving the Usage Report from the UP function, the CP function may
initiate PFCP Session Modification procedure as result of the communication
with the PCRF or OCS, as described in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2], e.g.
by:
\- modifying the URR (e.g. changing the Volume/Time threshold, Volume/Time
quota, disabling the usage monitoring);
\- creating a new FAR (e.g. for redirect) and/or modifying the existing FAR;
or
\- modifying the QER (s) in the PFCP session.
##### 5.2.2.3.2 Credit pooling
When a URR is received with at least one Aggregated URRs IE included, the UP
function:
\- shall calculate the traffic usage of the URR by applying the Multiplier(s)
and aggregating the traffic usage from all URRs indicated in the Aggregated
URRs IE(s), as specified in IETF RFC 4006 [16];
> NOTE 1: The usage of this URR is calculated using the following formula:
>
> C1*M1 + C2*M2 + ... + Cn*Mn = U,\ where U is the usage counted by this URR,
> Cn is the usage counted by each aggregated URR (i.e. URR for each RG sharing
> the credit pool), and Mn is the multiplier for each aggregrated URR.
\- shall generate a report when the counted usage exceeds the threshold;
\- shall generate a report if the threshold is not provided, and stop packets
forwarding (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based
on operator policy in the UP function) for all Aggregated URRs when the
counted usage exceeds the quota.
NOTE 2: The handling of the aggregated URR(s), e.g. generating a Usage Report
upon the Reporting Trigger(s) is not impacted by handling of this URR for the
Credit Pool.
##### 5.2.2.3.3 Traffic Usage Reporting with Redundant Transmission on N3/N9
interfaces
The following requirements shall apply when using Redundant Transmission on
N3/N9 interfaces:
\- the UPF shall not count redundant packets in Usage Reports (e.g. Volume
Measurement), i.e. it shall count the traffic only once in Usage Reports;
\- the SMF shall provide the quota for the non-redundant transmission (i.e.
not counting redundant traffic).
#### 5.2.2.4 Reporting of Linked Usage Reports to the CP function
The CP function may instruct the UP function to generate a Usage Report for a
URR \"X\" when a Usage Report is generated for another URR \"Y\", by:
\- provisioning the URR \"X\" with the Reporting Triggers IE set to Linked
Usage Reporting; and
\- including in the URR \"X\" the Linked URR ID IE set to the URR ID of the
URR \"Y\".
NOTE 1: This can be used by the CP function e.g. to request the UP function to
report a Usage Report for an SDF (i.e. URR \"X\") when the UP function reports
a Usage Report for a bearer (i.e. URR \"Y\").
NOTE 2: This can be used by the CP function e.g. to request the UP function to
report a Usage Report for a RG (i.e. URR \"X\") when the UP function reports a
Usage Report for a credit pool to which this RG pertain (i.e. URR \"Y\").
When a usage report is to be generated for the URR \"Y\", regardless of the
condition which triggers the report, the UP function shall also send a Usage
Report for the URR \"X\" with the accumulated usage information, and the Usage
Report Trigger IE set to Linked Usage Reporting.
NOTE 3: This also applies e.g. when an immediate usage report is requested for
the URR \"Y\"within a PFCP session Modification Request.
The URR \"Y\" may be linked to more URRs than just URR \"X\".
A RG level URR may be linked to IP-CAN bearer level URR as well as IP-CAN
Session level URR to enable the CP function to generate a CDR on the different
level. In such case, a URR \"X\" may link to more URRs than just URR \"Y\".
#### 5.2.2.5 End Marker Reception Reporting
The CP function may request the UP function to report the End Marker reception
during UE Triggered Service Request with, or without I-SMF
insertion/change/removal procedures (see clauses 4.2.3.2 and 4.23.4.3 in 3GPP
TS 23.502 [29]):
\- If a new I-UPF is selected by the SMF to replace the old I-UPF, the SMF may
provide two PDRs to the new I-UPF, e.g. PDR-1 for DL data from the PSA UPF,
where the Apply Action IE in FAR-1 associated with PDR-1 is set to BUFF; and
e.g. PDR-2 for receiving the buffered DL data from the old I-UPF, where the
Apply Action IE in FAR-2 associated with PDR-2 is set to FORW. In this case,
the SMF shall indicate to the new I-UPF to report the reception of the End
Marker packet from the old I-UPF, by providing a URR related to PDR-2 with
REEMR flag set to 1 in the Reporting Triggers IE, which is included in a
Create URR IE within PFCP Session Establishment Request.
\- If the SMF removes the old I-UPF but does not replace it with a new I-UPF,
then the SMF may provide two PDRs to the PSA UPF, e.g. PDR-3 for receiving DL
data across N6, where the Apply Action IE in FAR-3 associated with PDR-3 is
set to BUFF; and e.g. PDR-4 for receiving the buffered DL data from the old
I-UPF, where the Apply Action IE in FAR-4 associated with PDR-4 is set to
FORW. The SMF shall indicate to the PSA UPF to report the reception of the End
Marker packet from the old I-UPF, by providing a URR related to PDR-4 with
REEMR flag set to 1 in the Reporting Triggers IE which is included in a Create
URR IE within PFCP Session Modification Request.
Once the End Marker packet is received from the old I-UPF, the UPF (either new
I-UPF or the PSA UPF) shall inform the SMF about this by sending the PFCP
Session Report Request with the Usage Report IE containing the usage
measurement as instructed in the URR, where EMRRE flag shall be set to 1 in a
Usage Report Trigger IE and shall discard the End Marker packet(s). The SMF
shall instruct the UPF to start sending the buffered DL data identified by
PDR-1 or PDR-3 by sending a PFCP Session Modification Request message, where
the Apply Action IE in the FAR-1/FAR-3 related to PDR-1/PDR-3 shall be changed
from BUFF to FORW.
### 5.2.3 Forwarding Action Rule Handling
#### 5.2.3.1 General
The CP function shall provision one and only one FAR for each PDR provisioned
in a PFCP session. The FAR provides instructions to the UP function on how to
process the packets matching the PDR.
By setting the appropriate flag(s) in the Apply Action IE in the FAR (see
clause 8.2.26), the CP function may request the UP function to:
\- drop the packets, by setting the DROP flag;
\- forward the packets, by setting the FORW flag and by provisioning the
Forwarding Parameters providing instructions on how to forward the packets;
\- buffer downlink packets by setting the BUFF flag and by optionally
provisioning buffering parameters providing instructions on how to buffer the
packets;
\- notify the CP function about the arrival of a first DL packet being
buffered, by setting the NOCP flag;
\- notify the CP function about the first discarded DL packet for each service
data flow identified by a PDR, when the CP function requests the UP function
to buffer DL packets but the DL Buffering Duration or the DL Buffering
Suggested Packet Count is exceeded, or when the CP function requests the UP
function to drop DL packets and a packet is discarded directly, by setting the
DDPN flag, if the UP function supports the DDDS feature;
\- notify the CP function about first buffered DL packet for each service data
flow identified by a PDR, by setting the BDPN flag, if the UP function
supports the DDDS feature;
\- duplicate the packets, by setting the DUPL flag and by provisioning the
Duplicating Parameters providing instructions on how to forward the duplicated
packets;
\- accept or deny UE requests to join an IP multicast group (see clause 5.25),
by setting the IPMA or IPMD flag;
\- duplicate the packets for redundant transmission (see clause 5.24.2), by
setting the DFRT flag and by provisioning the Redundant Transmission
Forwarding Parameters IE providing instructions on how to forward the
duplicated packets for redundant transmission;
\- eliminate duplicate packets used for redundant transmission (see clause
5.24.2), by setting the EDRT flag and by provisioning the Redundant
Transmission Detection Parameters IE providing instructions on how to detect
the duplicated packets for redundant transmission.
The CP function may request the UP function to duplicate packets that are to
be dropped, forwarded or buffered.
The CP function may request the UP function to forward the packets and
duplicate the packets for redundant transmission.
The CP function may request the UP function to forward the packets and
eliminate duplicate packets used for redundant transmission.
The CP function may provision one or more FAR(s) per PFCP session. Different
FARs of a same PFCP session may be provisioned with a different Apply Action
flags, e.g. to enable the forwarding of downlink data packets for some PDRs
while requesting to buffer downlink data packets for other PDRs.
NOTE 1: This is necessary to establish or release a partial set of radio
access bearers in UTRAN.
When instructed to buffer and notify the CP function about the arrival of a DL
packet, the UP function shall notify the CP function, when it receives a first
downlink packet for a given FAR (in EPC), or when it receives a first downlink
packet for each QoS flow for a given FAR (in 5GC), by sending a PFCP Session
Report Request including a Downlink Data Report IE identifying the PDR(s) for
which downlink packets have been received.
NOTE 2: Receipt of downlink packets on PDRs associated to different FARs can
result in sending multiple PFCP Session Report Request messages for the same
PFCP session.
NOTE 3: Receipt of downlink packets pertaining to different QoS flows
associated to the same FAR can result in sending multiple PFCP Session Report
Request messages for the same PFCP session. The CP function identifies the QFI
based on the PDR ID (when different PDRs are used for different QoS flows) or
based on the Downlink Data Service Information IE.
NOTE 4: The end marker packet is not considered as DL data packet so that it
does not trigger the UP function to notify the CP function about the arrival
of a DL packet. The UP function can discard the received end marker packet(s)
silently, when it is not possible to be forwarded.
If the UP function indicated support of Header Enrichment of UL traffic (see
clause 8.2.25), the CP function may provide the UP function with header
enrichment information for uplink traffic, by including one or more Header
Enrichment IE(s) in the FAR. In this case, the UP function should use this
information to enrich the header of the uplink traffic (e.g. HTTP header
enrichment).
NOTE 5: It is not defined how to support SGi PtP tunnelling mechanisms other
than based on UDP/IP encapsulation (such as PMIPv6/GRE, L2TP, GTP-C/U, see
clause 4.3.17.8.3.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]) for Non-IP PDN connections.
If the UP function indicated support of PDI optimisation (see clause 8.2.25),
the CP function may include in the forwarding parameters of the FAR the Linked
Traffic Endpoint ID, if it is available, identifying the traffic Endpoint
allocated for this PFCP session to receive the traffic in the reverse
direction.
NOTE 6: This information can enable an SGW-U or PGW-U to correlate the UL and
DL traffic (i.e. PDRs) sent over a same bearer.
Assuming for instance a PFCP session provisioned in a PGW-U with:
\- an UL PDR 1 (for an S5/S8 bearer 1) with Source Interface \"Access\"
associated to an UL Traffic Endpoint ID \"1\" (comprising the IP address, a
local TEID and optionally a network instance),
\- a DL PDR 1 with Source Interface \"Core\", UE IP address and SDF 1,
the CP function sets the Linked Traffic Endpoint in the DL FAR 1 (associated
to DL PDR 1) to the UL Traffic Endpoint \"1\", which allows the PGW-U to
correlate the uplink and downlink PDRs for the same bearer (i.e. that UL PDR 1
associated to UL Traffic Endpoint \"1\", and DL PDR1 associated to DL FAR 1
with Linked Traffic Endpoint set to UL Traffic Endpoint \"1\", use the same
S5/S8 bearer).
NOTE 7: The Linked Traffic Endpoint can possibly refer to a Traffic Endpoint
in the reverse direction requested to be created in the same PFCP request.
### 5.2.4 Buffering Action Rule Handling
#### 5.2.4.1 General
A BAR provides instructions to control the buffering behaviour of the UP
function for all the FARs of the PFCP session set with an Apply Action
parameter requesting the packets to be buffered and associated to this BAR.
The CP function may create a BAR for a PFCP session and associate it to the
FAR(s) of the PFCP session in a PFCP Session Establishment Request or a PFCP
Session Modification Request to request the UP function to apply a specific
buffering behaviour for packets requested to be buffered and associated to
this BAR.
The CP function may modify the following buffering instructions provided in a
BAR as follows:
\- the Downlink Data Notification Delay in a PFCP Session Modification Request
(for EPC); or
\- the Downlink Data Notification Delay (for EPC), DL Buffering Duration
and/or DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count in a PFCP Session Report Response
message or PFCP Session Modification Request.
NOTE: The CP function needs to provision a (possibly empty) BAR and associate
it to the FARs of the PFCP session when establishing or modifying the PFCP
session to be able to modify the BAR in a PFCP Session Report Response.
If the UP Function has indicated support of the feature UL/DL Buffering
Control (UDBC), the CP function may provide the Suggested Buffering Packet
Count IE in a BAR which is created during a PFCP Session Establishment
procedure or a PFCP Session Modification procedure, and the CP function may
modify it in a subsequent PFCP Session Modification Request, and/or a PFCP
Session Report Response message. The same BAR may be associated with all the
FARs in a PFCP session to indicate that all Service Data Flows in the PFCP
Session share the same buffer in the UP function for the PFCP Session.
If the SGW-U has indicated support of the feature MT-EDT, the CP function may
provide the MT-EDT (Mobile Terminated Early Data Transmission) Control
Information IE in a BAR when it is created and modified, to request the SGW-U
to report the sum of DL Data Packets Size in byte when sending Downlink Data
Report.
In this release of the specification, at most one BAR may be created per PFCP
session.
#### 5.2.4.2 Provisioning of Buffering Action Rule in the UP function
The CP function may provision the following buffering parameters in a BAR:
\- For EPC, the Downlink Data Notification Delay IE, to request the UP
function to delay the sending of a PFCP Session Report Request, between
receiving a downlink data packet and notifying the CP function about it, if
the UP function indicated support of the Downlink Data Notification Delay
parameter (see clause 8.2.28);
\- the DL Buffering Duration IE, to request the UP function to buffer the
downlink data packet for an extended duration without sending any further
notification to the CP function about the arrival of DL data packets, if the
UP function indicated support of the DL Buffering Duration parameter in PFCP
Session Report Response feature and/or support of the DL Buffering Duration
parameter in PFCP Session Modification Request feature (see DLBD and DBDM
features in clause 8.2.25);
\- the DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count in PFCP Session Report Response, to
request the UP function to buffer the suggested number of downlink data
packets, when extended buffering of downlink data packet is required in the UP
function. The DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count may also be included in PFCP
Session Modification Request if the UP function indicated support of the DL
Buffering Suggested Packet Count parameter in PFCP Session Modification
Request feature (see DBDM feature in clause 8.2.25);
\- the Suggested Buffering Packet Count IE if the UP Function has indicated
support of the feature UDBC, to indicate the number of packets (including both
uplink or downlink) that the CP function suggests to be buffered in the UP
function, until it receives new instructions from the CP function, e.g. when
the new Quota is granted.
The UP function shall stop applying the DL Buffering Duration and DL Buffering
Suggested Packet Count parameters and shall delete these parameters from the
BAR (without explicit request from the CP function) when extended buffering of
downlink data packets ends in the UP function.
NOTE: The CP function will provide the DL Buffering Duration and DL Buffering
Suggested Packet Count parameters again when re-invoking extended buffering of
downlink data packets.
The UP function shall stop applying buffering when new instruction is received
from the CP function. The buffered packets shall be either dropped or
forwarded following the packet forwarding model specified in clause 5.2.1 and
taking into consideration that the buffered Packets have been already
processed earlier.
### 5.2.5 QoS Enforcement Rule Handling
#### 5.2.5.1 General
The CP function shall provision QER(s) for a PFCP session in a PFCP Session
Establishment Request or a PFCP Session Modification Request to request the UP
function to perform QoS enforcement of the user plane traffic.
#### 5.2.5.2 Provisioning of QoS Enforcement Rule in the UP function
The CP function may request the UP function to perform the following QoS
enforcement actions in a QER:
\- Gating Control, as specified in clause 5.4.3;
\- QoS Control, i.e. MBR, GBR or Packet Rate enforcement, as specified in
clause 5.4.4;
\- DL flow level marking for application detection, as specified in clause
5.4.5;
\- SCI (Service Class Indicator) marking for service identification for
improved radio utilisation for GERAN, as specified in clause 5.4.12;
\- for 5GC reflective QoS for uplink traffic.
#### 5.2.5.3 Reflective QoS (for 5GC)
The 5GS may support Reflective QoS functionality (see clauses 5.7.5 in 3GPP TS
23.501 [28]).
When the 5GC determines to use Reflective QoS for a specific SDF, the SMF
shall set the Reflective QoS Indication (RQI) bit to 1 in the QER associated
to the DL PDR for this SDF in a PFCP Session Establishment Request or PFCP
Session Modification Request message.
The SMF may also provision the UPF to perform uplink QoS flow binding
verification for the specific SDF as specified in clause 5.4.2.
When the 5GC determines to no longer use Reflective QoS for a specific SDF,
the SMF shall request the UPF to stop applying Reflective QoS for the
corresponding downlink traffic, e.g. by setting the Reflective QoS Indication
(RQI) bit to 0 in the QER that is associated to the DL PDR or by dissociating
the QER from the DL PDR (as appropriate) in a PFCP Session Modification
Request message.
If the SMF had provisioned the UPF to perform uplink QoS flow binding
verification for the specific SDF, after an operator configurable time, the
SMF shall update the UL PDR(s) to no longer perform uplink QoS flow binding
verification for the corresponding uplink traffic and QFI.
### 5.2.6 Combined SGW/PGW Architecture
The usage of a combined SGW/PGW remains possible in a deployment with
separated control and user planes, see clause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
This is enabled by supporting a combined Sxa/Sxb interface with a common
packet forwarding model, message and parameter structure for non-combined and
combined cases.
The following additional requirements shall apply to a combined Sxa/Sxb
interface between a combined SGW/PGW-C and a combined SGW/PGW-U:
\- all the functionalities specified for Sxa and Sxb shall be supported,
possibly concurrently, over a combined Sxa/Sxb association;
\- a single PFCP session may be setup to support both the functionalities of
an SGW-U and PGW-U;
\- the CP function may provision PDRs, QERs, URRs, FARs (possibly with a
buffering instruction) and BAR, possibly concurrently, for the same PFCP
session;
\- the CP function may provision concurrently parameters in a message or for
the PFCP session that are applicable to Sxa and Sxb.
### 5.2.7 Multi-Access Rule Handling (for 5GC)
#### 5.2.7.1 General
The UP function (i.e. the UPF) shall support the Multi-Access Rule (MAR) if it
supports the ATSSS feature (see MPTCP and ATSSS-LL flags in UP Function
Features, Table 8.2.25-1).
The CP function (i.e. the SMF) shall provision in the UP function acting as
the PDU Session Anchor (PSA) and supporting the ATSSS feature, one and only
one MAR for every downlink PDR corresponding to non-GBR traffic of a PFCP
session that is established for a Multi-Access (MA) PDU session.
The MAR provides instructions to the UP function on how to forward the packets
matching the PDR over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. See clauses 5.8.2.11.8 and
5.32.8 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
In a MAR, the CP function (i.e. the SMF) shall:
\- instruct the UPF which traffic steering functionality to use, i.e. MPTCP or
ATSSS-LL, using the Steering Functionality IE (see clause 8.2.124);
\- set the Steering Mode to instruct how the packets shall be distributed
across 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, e.g. Active-Standby, Smallest Delay, Load
Balancing and Priority Based (see clause 8.2.125);
\- provision access specific forwarding action information including:
\- a FAR ID which control the packets forwarding either to 3GPP access or
non-3GPP access;
\- a Weight to indicate the proportion of traffic to be forwarded by the given
FAR when the Steering Mode is set to \"Load Sharing\";
\- a Priority to indicate at which condition the traffic is to be forwarded by
the given FAR when the Steering Mode is set to \"Active-Standby\" or
\"Priority-Based\";
\- a list of URR IDs to enable the SMF to request separate usage report for
different accesses.
The CP function may provision one or more MAR(s) (for different PDRs) per PFCP
session. Different MARs of a same PFCP session may be provisioned with a
different steering functionality and/or a different steering mode. Different
MARs of a same PFCP session may be associated with the same FAR(s).
If a UE indicates it supports MPTCP and ATSSS-LL, and if the network
determines to apply both MPTCP functionality and ATSSS-LL functionality for
the UE\'s PDU session, the CP function shall provision separate downlink PDRs
for MPTCP traffic and for Non-MPTCP traffic. Correspondingly, different MARs
shall be provisioned and associated with the separate downlink PDRs. The
steering functionality shall be set to ATSSS-LL for the MAR associated with
the downlink PDR for non MPTCP traffic.
The UP function shall distribute the downlink traffic across the two access
networks (and the two N3/N9 tunnels) according to the instructions received in
the MAR and feedback information received from the UE via the user plane (e.g.
access network Unavailability or Availability reports for ATSSS-LL received by
PMF, see 3GPP TS 24.193 [59]).
### 5.2.8 Session Reporting Rule Handling
#### 5.2.8.1 General
The CP function may provision SRR(s) for a PFCP session in a PFCP Session
Establishment Request or a PFCP Session Modification Request to request the UP
function to detect and report events for a PFCP session that are not related
to specific PDRs of the PFCP session or that are not related to traffic usage
measurement.
\- Change of 3GPP or non-3GPP access availability, for a MA PDU session (see
clause 5.20.4.2).
\- Reporting the per QoS flow per UE QoS Monitoring Report, as specified in
clause 5.33.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
#### 5.2.8.2 Provisioning of Session Reporting Rule in the UP function
##### 5.2.8.2.1 General
When provisioning an SRR, the CP function shall provide control information
identifying the events that the UPF is requested to detect and report. The CP
function may modify an SRR in the PFCP Session Modification Request message.
#### 5.2.8.3 Reporting of Session Report to the CP function
##### 5.2.8.3.1 General
When detecting that a provisioned event to report occurs, the UP function
shall generate a Session Report for the related SRR and send it to the CP
function by initiating the PFCP Session Report procedure.
Upon generating a session report for an SRR towards the CP function, the UP
function shall continue to apply all the provisioned SRR(s), until getting any
further instruction from the CP function.
The CP function may request the UP function to stop the detection and
reporting of specific events by removing the SRR or, if the SRR is used to
control different types of events, by updating the SRR with a control
information IE for the events to stop with a null length. When so instructed,
the UP function shall stop detecting and reporting the corresponding events.
## 5.3 Data Forwarding between the CP and UP Functions
### 5.3.1 General
Forwarding of user plane data between the CP and UP functions may take place
as part of the following scenarios (see 3GPP TS 23.214 [2] for EPC and 3GPP TS
23.501 [28] for 5GC).
Table 5.3.1-1: Data forwarding scenarios between the CP and UP functions
+---+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | | Scenario | Data | For EPC | For 5GC | | | description | forwarding | applicable to | applicable to | | | | direction | | | +===+===============+===============+===============+===============+ | 1 | Forwarding of | UP to CP | PGW | UPF to SMF | | | user-plane | function | | | | | packets | | | SMF to UPF | | | between the | CP to UP | | | | | UE and the CP | function | | | | | function. | | | | +---+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | 2 | Forwarding of | UP to CP | PGW | UPF to SMF | | | packets | function | | | | | between the | | | SMF to UPF | | | CP function | CP to UP | | | | | and the | function | | | | | external PDN | | | | | | (over SGi) / | | | | | | DN (over N6). | | | | +---+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | 3 | Forwarding of | UP to CP | SGW | UPF to SMF | | | packets | function | | | | | subject to | | | SMF to UPF | | | buffering in | CP to UP | | | | | the CP | function | | | | | function. | | | | +---+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | 4 | Forwarding of | CP to UP | SGW, PGW | SMF to UPF | | | End Marker | function | | | | | Packets | | | | | | constructed | | | | | | by the CP | | | | | | function to a | | | | | | downstream | | | | | | node. | | | | +---+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+ | 5 | Forwarding of | UP to CP | - | UPF to SMF | | | user data | function | | | | | using Control | | | SMF to UPF | | | Plane CIoT | CP to UP | | | | | 5GS | function | | | | | Optimisation | | | | +---+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
User plane packets shall be forwarded between the CP and UP functions by
encapsulating the user plane packets using GTP-U encapsulation (see 3GPP TS
29.281 [3]).
For forwarding data from the UP function to the CP function, the CP function
shall provision PDR(s) per PFCP session context, with the PDI identifying the
user plane traffic to forward to the CP function and with a FAR set with the
Destination Interface \"CP function side\" and set to perform GTP-U
encapsulation and to forward the packets to a GTP-u F-TEID uniquely assigned
in the CP function per PFCP session and PDR. The CP function shall then
identify the PDN connection and the bearer to which the forwarded data belongs
by the F-TEID in the header of the encapsulating GTP-U packet.
For forwarding data from the CP function to the UP function, the CP function
shall provision one or more PDR(s) per PFCP session context, with the PDI set
with the Source Interface \"CP function side\" and identifying the GTP-u
F-TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function per PDR, and with a FAR set to
perform GTP-U decapsulation and to forward the packets to the intended
destination. URRs and QERs may also be configured.
For EPC PFCP session contexts may correspond to individual PDN connections,
TDF sessions, or standalone sessions not tied to any PDN connection or TDF
session used e.g. for forwarding RADIUS, Diameter or DHCP signalling between
the PGW-C and the PDN or for forwarding End Marker packets from the PGW-C or
SGW-C to a downstream SGW-U or eNodeB.
For 5GC PFCP session contexts may correspond to individual PDU sessions or
standalone sessions not tied to any PDU sessions used e.g. for forwarding
RADIUS, Diameter or DHCP signalling between the SMF and the DN or for
forwarding End Marker packets from the SMF to a downstream UPF or NG-RAN.
For EPC the CP function may establish one Sx-u tunnel per:
\- bearer of PDN connection e.g. for the data forwarding scenarios 1 and 3;
\- UP function or PDN e.g. for the data forwarding scenario 1, 2 and 4.
For 5GC the CP function may establish one N4-u tunnel per:
\- PDU session e.g. for the data forwarding scenarios 1, 3 and 5;
\- UP function or DN e.g. for the data forwarding scenario 1, 2 and 4.
Requirements for forwarding packets subject to buffering in the CP function
between the UP and CP functions (scenario 3) are further specified in clause
5.3.3.
Requirements for sending End Marker packets (scenario 4) are further specified
in clause 5.3.2.
Requirements for forwarding user data using Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation between the UP and CP functions (scenario 5) are further
specified in clause 5.3.5.
### 5.3.2 Sending of End Marker Packets
The construction of End Marker packets may either be done in the CP function
or UP function, based on network configuration, as specified in clause 5.8 of
3GPP TS 23.214 [2] for EPC and in clause 5.8.2.9 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] for
5GC. The support of End Marker packets by the UP function is optional.
If the UP function indicated support of End Marker packets constructed in the
UP function, the CP function shall request the UP function to construct and
send End Marker packets by sending a Session Modification Request including
FAR(s) with the new downstream F-TEID and with the SNDEM (Send End Marker
Packets) flag set.
For End Marker packets constructed in the CP function, the CP function shall:
\- establish (once) one standalone PFCP session not tied to any PDN
connection, per the UP function, for forwarding End Marker packets, and
provision the UP function to perform one GTP-U decapsulation and to forward
the resulting packets without any further change towards the destination IP
address of these packets;
\- construct the GTP-U End Marker packets, with the destination IP address and
TEID set according to the old F-TEID value, and with a source IP address set
according to the UP function\'s F-TEID value (e.g. S1 or Iu SGW F-TEID or NG-u
UPF F-TEID);
\- encapsulate the constructed GTP-U End Marker packets in GTP-U packets
according to the principles specified in clause 5.3.1 for data forwarding
between the CP function and the UP function, and send them towards the F-TEID
assigned in the UP function for the above PFCP session, after receipt of the
PFCP Session Modification Response indicating that the UP function has
switched to a new F-TEID.
Upon receipt of a PFCP Session Modification Request modifying the F-TEID in
the Outer Header Creation of a FAR, the UP function shall send the Response
message only after having switched to the new F-TEID.
### 5.3.3 Forwarding of Packets Subject to Buffering in the CP Function
#### 5.3.3.1 General
The following requirements shall apply to the data forwarding scenario 3 of
Table 5.3.1-1 in addition to the requirements specified in clause 5.3.1.
The CP function shall establish one Sx-u tunnel per bearer of a PDN connection
/ one N4-u tunnel per PDU session when applying the data forwarding scenario
3.
#### 5.3.3.2 Forwarding of Packets from the UP Function to the CP Function
For EPC, regardless of whether the downlink traffic received by the UP
function consists of T-PDUs (i.e. user data packet, see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3])
for a combined SGW/PGW-U, or G-PDUs (i.e. T-PDU plus a GTP-U header) for a
SGW-U, the downlink traffic shall be forwarded from the UP function to the CP
function as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID
uniquely assigned in the CP function for the Sx-u tunnel corresponding to the
bearer of the PDN connection.
NOTE 1: An SGW-U receiving G-PDUs from an S5/S8 bearer forwards the same
G-PDUs towards the SGW-C but with the IP address and TEID in the GTP-U header
changed to the SGW-C IP address and TEID of the corresponding Sx-u tunnel.
For 5GC, regardless of whether the downlink traffic received by the UP
function consists of T-PDUs (i.e. user data packet, see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3])
for an PSA-UPF, or G-PDUs (i.e. T-PDU plus a GTP-U header) for an I-UPF, the
downlink traffic shall be forwarded from the UP function to the CP function as
G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned
in the CP function for the N4-u tunnel corresponding to the PDU session of the
PDN connection.
NOTE 2: An I-UPF receiving G-PDUs from an N9 GTPU tunnel forwards the same
G-PDUs towards the SMF but with the IP address and TEID in the GTP-U header
changed to the SMF IP address and TEID of the corresponding N4-u tunnel.
To forward the user plane data to be buffered in the CP function from the UP
function, the CP function shall provision:

respectively;
\- a FAR instructing the UP function to forward the received downlink data to
the CP function, with the field Outer Header Creation Description in the Outer
Header Creation set to \"0\" or \"1\".
NOTE 3: The PDR can be provisioned in the UP function before applying data
forwarding to the CP function.
For EPC, G-PDUs sent from the UP function to the CP function over the Sx-u
tunnel shall include any GTP-U extension header(s):
\- possibly received by the UP function over the S5/S8 bearers and stored
during the Outer Header Removal;
\- possibly created by the UP function as part of a QER rule.
For 5GC, G-PDUs sent from the UP function to the CP function over the N4-u
tunnel shall include any GTP-U extension header(s):
\- possibly received by the UP function over the N9 PDU sessions and stored
during the Outer Header Removal;
\- possibly created by the UP function as part of a QER rule.
#### 5.3.3.3 Forwarding of Packets from the CP Function to the UP Function
Likewise, when subsequently sending the downlink traffic buffered in the CP
function back to the UP function, the downlink traffic shall be forwarded:
\- for EPC, over Sx-u as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address
and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the Sx-u tunnel set up for
the corresponding bearer of the PDN connection;
\- for 5GC, over N4-u as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address
and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the N4-u tunnel set up for
the corresponding PDU session.
G-PDUs sent over Sx-u / N4-u shall include GTP-U extension header(s) possibly
received earlier from the UP function.
To forward the user plane data from the CP function to the UP function, the CP
function shall provision:
a PDR per bearer of the PDN connection (for EPC) or per PDU session (for 5GC),
with an IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the Sx-u
/ N4-u tunnel, and with the field Outer Header Removal Description in the
Outer Header Removal IE set to \"0\" or \"1\";
\- a FAR enabling the UP function to forward the received downlink data from
the CP function towards the RAN, with the field Outer Header Creation
Description in the Outer Header Creation set to \"0\" or \"1\".
G-PDUs sent from the UP function towards the RAN shall include GTP-U extension
header(s) possibly received from the CP function.
### 5.3.4 Data Forwarding between the CP and UP Functions with one PFCP-u
Tunnel per UP Function or PDN
#### 5.3.4.1 General
The following requirements shall apply to the data forwarding scenario 1 and 2
of Table 5.3.1-1, when establishing one PFCP-u tunnel per UP function or PDN,
in addition to the requirements specified in clause 5.3.1.
#### 5.3.4.2 Forwarding of Packets from the UP Function to the CP Function
Regardless of whether the traffic received by the UP function consists of
T-PDUs (i.e. user data packet, see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]) from SGi / N6 or G-PDUs
(i.e. T-PDU plus a GTP-U header) from the UE, the traffic shall be forwarded
from the UP function to the CP function as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to
the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the CP function for the PFCP-u
tunnel corresponding to the UP function or PDN.
To forward the user plane data to from the UP function, the CP function shall
provision:
\- for supporting data forwarding scenario \"1\" as specified in clause 5.3.1,
an additional PDR for a PFCP session established for a PDN connection or a PDU
session which requires such data forwarding, matching the received user plane
packets from uplink direction. The Outer Header Removal IE shall not be
present if the complete G-PDU is required to be forwarded, otherwise the Outer
Header Removal IE shall be present and set to \"0\" or \"1\" for IPv4 or IPv6
respectively;
\- for supporting data forwarding scenario \"2\" as specified in clause 5.3.1,

function, with the field Outer Header Creation Description in the Outer Header
Creation set to \"0\" or \"1\" for IPv4 or IPv6 respectively, and the Outer
GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the CP
function for the Sx-u tunnel.
#### 5.3.4.3 Forwarding of Packets from the CP Function to the UP Function

function shall provision:
a PDR per UP function, with an IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP
function for the PFCP-u tunnel, and with the field Outer Header Removal
Description in the Outer Header Removal IE set to \"0\" or \"1\";
\- a FAR enabling the UP function to forward the received data from the CP
function.
### 5.3.5 Forwarding of user data using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
(for 5GC)
#### 5.3.5.1 General
The following requirements shall apply to the data forwarding scenario 5 of
Table 5.3.1-1 in addition to the requirements specified in clause 5.3.1.
The CP function shall establish one one N4-u tunnel per PDU session when

#### 5.3.5.2 Forwarding of Packets from the UP Function to the CP Function
Regardless of whether the downlink traffic received by the UP function
consists of T-PDUs (i.e. user data packet, see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]) from N6 or
G-PDUs (i.e. T-PDU plus a GTP-U header) received from N9, the downlink traffic
shall be forwarded from the UP function to the CP function as G-PDUs with the

function for the N4-u tunnel corresponding to the PDU session.
NOTE: A UPF receiving G-PDUs from N9 forwards the G-PDUs towards the SMF but
with the IP address and TEID in the GTP-U header changed to the SMF IP address
and TEID of the corresponding N4-u tunnel.
To forward the user plane data from the UP function to the CP function, the CP

## 5.4 Policy and Charging Control
### 5.4.1 General
This clause describe how Policy and Charging Control requirements are
supported over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points.
### 5.4.2 Service Detection and Bearer/QoS Flow Binding
Service detection refers to the process that identifies the packets belonging
to a service data flow or application. For EPC, see clauses 6.2.2.2 and 6.8.1
of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. For 5GC, see clause 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44].
For EPC, bearer binding is the procedure that associates service data flow(s)
to an IP-CAN bearer deemed to transport the service data flow. UL bearer
binding verification refers to the process of discarding uplink packets due to
no matching service data flow template for the uplink direction. See clauses
6.1.1.4 and 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7].
For 5GC, QoS flow binding is the procedure that associates service data
flow(s) to a QoS flow deemed to transport the service data flow. UL QoS flow
binding verification refers to the process of discarding uplink packets due to
no matching QoS flow for the uplink direction. See clause 6.1.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS
23.503 [44] and clause 5.7.1.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
Service detection is controlled over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points
by configuring Packet Detection Information in PDRs to match the intended
service data flows or application.
For EPC, the mapping of DL traffic to bearers is achieved by configuring and
associating FARs to the downlink PDRs, with FARs set to forward the packets to
the appropriate downstream bearers (S5/S8 or S1/S12/S4/Iu).
For 5GC, the mapping of DL traffic to QoS flows is achieved by configuring
QERs with QFI(s) for the QoS flow marking and associating FARs to the downlink
PDRs, with FARs set to forward the packets to the appropriate downstream GTP-U
tunnel (N9 or N3).
For EPC, uplink bearer binding verification is achieved by configuring Packet
Detection Information in uplink PDRs containing the local F-TEID of the uplink
bearer, the UE IP address (source IP address to match for the incoming
packet), and the SDF filter(s) or the Application ID. As a result, uplink
packets received on the uplink bearer but that do not match the SDF filter(s)
or Application detection filter associated to the uplink PDRs are discarded.
For 5GC, uplink QoS flow binding verification (see clause 5.7.1.7 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [28]) is achieved by configuring Packet Detection Information in uplink
PDRs containing the local F-TEID of the uplink PDU session, the UE IP address
(source IP address to match for the incoming packet), the QFI of the QoS flow
and the SDF filter(s) or the Application ID. As a result, uplink packets
received on the uplink PDU session but that do not match the SDF filter(s) or
Application detection filter and QFI associated to the uplink PDRs are
discarded.
> NOTE 1: For PCC Rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that
> refer to an application detection filter), uplink traffic can be received on
> other IP-CAN bearers than the one determined by the binding mechanism. The
> detection of the uplink part of the service data flow can be activated in
> parallel on other bearers with non-GBR QCI (e.g. the default bearer) in
> addition to the bearer where the PCC rule is bound to. See clauses 6.1.1.1
> and 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. Therefore the uplink PDRs for these
> bearers can be provisioned with the PDI containing this service data flow
> and the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer.
>
> NOTE 2: To avoid the PGW-U discarding packets due to no matching service
> data flow template, the operator can apply open PCC rules (with wildcarded
> SDF filters) to allow for the passage of packets that do not match any other
> candidate SDF template. Therefore an uplink PDR can be provisioned with the
> PDI containing only the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer.
>
> NOTE 3: Uplink bearer binding does not apply to Non-IP PDN connections.
>
> NOTE 4: The UPF can be provisioned with a PDR (with low precedence) which
> contains the CN tunnel info, QFI and filter information that can detect any
> unwanted/unauthorized traffic with this QFI so that such traffic can be
> dropped with or without being counted before.
### 5.4.3 Gating Control
Gating control refers to the process within the user plane function (i.e.
PGW-U and TDF-U for EPC, UPF for 5GC) of enabling or disabling the forwarding
of IP packets, belonging to a service data flow or detected application\'s
traffic, to pass through to the desired endpoint (for EPC see clause 4.3.2 of
3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and for 5GC see clause 4.3.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44]).
The PGW-C and TDF-C (for EPC) and the SMF (for 5GC) controls the gating in the
PGW-U and TDF-U (for EPC) and in the UPF (for 5GC) by creating PDR(s) for the
service data flow(s) or application\'s traffic to be detected, and by
associating a QER, including the Gate Status IE, to the PDRs.
The Gate Status IE indicates whether the service data flow or detected
application traffic is allowed to be forwarded (the gate is open) or shall be
discarded (the gate is closed) in the uplink and/or in downlink directions.
The PGW-U and TDF-U (for EPC) and the UPF (for 5GC) shall identify UL and DL
flows by the Source Interface IE in the PDI of the PDRs or the Destination
Interface IE in the FARs. The PGW-U and TDF-U (for EPC) and the UPF (for 5GC)
shall apply UL and DL gating accordingly.
### 5.4.4 QoS Control
QoS control refers to the authorization and enforcement of the maximum QoS
that is authorized:
\- for EPC,
\- at the session level (APN-AMBR, TDF session UL and DL bitrates, or UL and
DL Packet Rate of a PDN connection);
\- at the bearer level (GBR, MBR for GBR bearers);
\- at the service data flow (SDF) or application level.
\- for 5GC,
\- at the session level (Session-AMBR or UL and DL Packet Rate of a PDU
session);
\- at the QoS Flow level;
\- at the service data flow (SDF) or application level.
See clause 4.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] clause 4.5.5 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and
clause 4.7.7 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14].
The CP function shall control the QoS enforcement in the UP function by:
\- creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the service data flow,
application, QoS Flow (for 5GC), bearer or session, if not already existing;
\- creating QERs for the QoS enforcement at session level, SDF/application
level;
\- creating QERs for the QoS enforcement of the aggregate of SDFs with the
same GBR QCI;
\- creating QERs for the QoS enforcement of the aggregate of SDFs with the
same GBR QFI (for 5GC);
\- associating the session level QER to all the PDRs defined for the session;
\- associating the SDF or application QER to the PDRs associated to the SDF or
application;
\- associating the QER of the aggregate of SDFs to the PDRs associated to SDFs
or applications that share the QER.
The same QER may be associated to UL and DL PDRs. The UP function shall
identify the UL and DL flows by the Source Interface IE in the PDRs or the
Destination Interface IE in the FARs. The UP function shall enforce the QoS
for the UL or DL flows accordingly.
The CP function shall map the precedence of a PCC rule to the precedence of
the PDRs associated to the corresponding service data flows.
### 5.4.5 DL Flow Level Marking for Application Detection
DL flow level marking is performed using DL DSCP marking. DL DSCP marking for
application indication refers to the process in the TDF of marking detected
downlink application traffic with a DSCP value received within an installed
ADC rule matching this traffic. See Annex U of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and clauses
4.5.2.7 and 4b.5.14 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
DL DSCP marking for application indication is controlled by the TDF-C by
associating a QER, including the ToS or Traffic Class within the DL Flow Level
Marking IE, to the PDR matching the DL traffic to be marked. The TDF-U
performs the DL DSCP marking for the detected DL traffic and sends the marked
packet to the PGW-U.
If a tunnelling protocol is used between the TDF-U and the PGW-U, the DSCP
value for service data flow detection shall be carried in the inner IP header.
The TDF-C may stop the DL DSCP marking for the application during the PFCP
session by removing the related QER or removing the DL Flow Level Marking IE
from the related QER, the TDF-U shall then stop such function consequently.
Policy and charging control in the downlink direction by the PCEF for an
application detected by the TDF is performed by the PGW-C configuring a PDR
with a PDI containing an SDF Filter with the corresponding DSCP value.
### 5.4.6 Usage Monitoring
Usage Monitoring Control refers to the process of monitoring the user plane
traffic in the PGW-U, TDF-U or UPF for the accumulated usage of network
resources per:
\- individual or group of service data flows;
\- individual or group of applications;
\- PDU session, possibly excluding an individual SDF or a group of service
data flow(s) (for 5GC);
\- IP-CAN session, possibly excluding an individual SDF or a group of service
data flow(s) (for EPC); and/or
\- TDF session, possibly excluding an individual application or a group of
application(s) (for EPC).
For EPC, see clauses 4.4, 6.2.2.3 and 6.6 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and clauses
4.5.16, 4.5.17, 4b.5.6, 4b.5.7 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
For 5GC, see clauses 4.3.4 and 6.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44] and clauses
4.2.2.10, 4.2.3.11, 4.2.4.10, 4.2.6.2.5, 4.2.6.5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [41].
Usage Monitoring Control is supported over the Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference
points by activating in the UP function the reporting of usage information
towards the CP function, as specified in clauses 5.3 and 7.8.4 of 3GPP TS
23.214 [2] and in clause 5.8.2.6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
The CP function shall control the Usage Reporting in the UP function by:
\- creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the service data flow,
application or session;
\- creating a URR for each Monitoring key; and
\- associating the URR to:
\- all the PDRs of the PFCP session, for usage monitoring at IP-CAN or TDF
session level, possibly excluding the PDRs matching the SDFs or Applications
excluded from the usage monitoring at session level; or
\- the PDR(s) of the PFCP session associated to the individual or group of
SDF(s) or Application(s), for usage monitoring at SDF or application level.
### 5.4.7 Traffic Redirection
Traffic Redirection refers to the process of redirecting uplink application
traffic, in a PGW, TDF or UPF, towards a redirect destination, e.g. redirect
some HTTP flows to a service provisioning page. For EPC, see clause 6.1.13 of
3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and clauses 4.5.2.6 and 4b.5.1.4 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. For
5GC, see clause 6.1.3.12 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44] and clause 4.2.6.2.4 of 3GPP
TS 29.512 [46].
The redirect destination may be provided by the PCRF/PCF or be preconfigured
in the CP function or in the UP function.
For EPC, the traffic redirection may be enforced in the CP function or in the
UP function. For 5GC, the traffic redirection may be enforced in the UP
function only. If the traffic that the UP function can support may be subject
to traffic redirection, traffic redirection enforcement in the UP function
shall be supported by the UP function. The UP function reports to the CP
function whether it supports traffic redirection enforcement in the UP
function via the UP Function Features IE (see clause 8.2.25).
NOTE: A UP function that supports traffic not requiring traffic redirection
does not need to support traffic redirection enforcement in the UP function.
The CP function can select a UP function supporting traffic redirection
enforcement in the UP function for users or services which may require traffic
redirection.
To enforce the traffic redirection in the CP function, the CP function shall
instruct the UP function to forward the applicable user traffic to the CP
function, as specified in clause 5.3.1.
To enforce the traffic redirection in the UP function, the CP function shall:
\- create the necessary PDR(s) to represent the traffic to be redirected, if
not already existing;
\- create a FAR with:
\- the Redirect Information IE including the redirect destination, if the
traffic needs to be redirected towards a redirect destination provided by the
CP function; a redirect destination provided by the CP function shall prevail
over a redirect destination preconfigured in the UP function;
\- For HTTP traffic redirection, the Redirection Address Type shall be set to
\"URL\" and the CP function shall set the Destination Interface IE in the FAR
to \"Access\" (to forward the HTTP response message with a status code
indicating redirect). For other types of traffic redirection, the Destination
Interface IE in the FAR may be set to \"Core\";
or
\- the Forwarding Policy IE including the identifier of the forwarding policy
to apply, if the traffic needs to be redirected towards a redirect destination
preconfigured in the UP function;
\- associate the FAR to the above PDRs of the PFCP session.
### 5.4.8 Traffic Steering
Traffic Steering refers to the process of applying a specific (S)Gi-LAN
traffic steering policy in the PCEF or TDF (or TSSF), or a specific N6-LAN
traffic steering policy in the UPF (PDU Session Anchor), for the purpose of
steering the subscriber\'s traffic to appropriate operator or 3rd party
service functions (e.g. NAT, antimalware, parental control, DDoS protection)
in the (S)Gi-LAN or N6-LAN, per service data flows level or applications
level.
Application Function influencing traffic routing (see clause 5.6.7 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [28]) also uses traffic steering for the purpose of steering the
subscriber\'s traffic over N6, e.g. to a local access to a Data Network.
The UP function shall set the TRST feature flag in the UP Function Features IE
if it supports Traffic Steering (see clause 8.2.25).
Traffic Steering is supported over the Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points by
instructing the UP function to apply a specific Forwarding Policy, that is
locally configured in the UP function and that can be used for the uplink, the
downlink or for both directions. A Forwarding Policy is identified by a
Forwarding Policy Identifier. Traffic steering is alternatively supported over
the N4 reference point by instructing the UP function to route packets
according to N6 routing information in the FAR (e.g. providing an IP address
in the Outer Header Creation).
When so instructed, the UP function shall perform the necessary actions to
enforce the forwarding policy referenced by the CP function, e.g. performing
packet marking and routing the traffic towards the service functions within
the (S)Gi-LAN or N6-LAN.
See 3GPP TS 23.203 [7], 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
The CP function shall control Traffic Steering towards SGi-LAN, N6-LAN or N6
in the UP function by:
\- creating the necessary PDRs to represent the service data flows or
applications to be steered;
\- creating a FAR with the Forwarding Policy IE including the Forwarding
Policy Identifier set to the Traffic Steering Policy Identifier, or creating a
FAR with a Outer Header Creation with the destination IP address; and
\- associating the FAR to the above PDRs of the PFCP session.
The CP function shall control the processing of the traffic received from the
(S)Gi-LAN or N6-LAN in the UP function as specified in the rest of this
specification for traffic received from any other interface, but with PDR(s)
including a PDI with the Source Interface indicating \"SGi-LAN/N6-LAN\". The
UP function shall distinguish packets coming from (S)Gi-LAN/N6-LAN based on
local configuration.
### 5.4.9 Provisioning of Predefined PCC/ADC Rules
A Predefined PCC rule is preconfigured in the PCEF, e.g. a PGW (for EPC) or
SMF (for 5GC). Predefined PCC rules can be activated or deactivated by the
PCRF/PCF at any time. The Predefined PCC rules may be grouped allowing the
PCRF/PCF to dynamically activate a set of PCC rules.
For EPC a predefined ADC rule is preconfigured in the TDF. In the case of
solicited reporting, the Predefined ADC rules can be activated or deactivated
by the PCRF at any time. Predefined ADC rules within the TDF may be grouped
allowing the PCRF to dynamically activate a set of ADC rules.
For the definition of PCC and ADC rules see clauses 4.3.1 and 4b.3.2 of 3GPP
TS 29.212 [8] and clause 5.6.2.6 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [41].
The CP function may enforce an activated predefined PCC or ADC rule by the
PCRF/PCF in the UP function by:
\- determining the service data filters or application IDs referred by the
activated predefined PCC or ADC rule(s) and the corresponding QoS and charging
control information respectively;
\- creating the necessary PDR(s) to identify the service data flow(s),
application(s) that the predefined PCC or ADC rule refer to, if not already
existing;
\- creating the necessary QER for the QoS enforcement at service data flow or
application level accordingly;
\- creating the necessary FAR if a new FAR needs to be created as result of
Bearer binding (for EPC) or QoS flow binding (for 5GC) and QoS control for
forwarding the detected service data flow or application traffic, or to
redirect or to apply traffic steering control if included in the predefined
PCC/ADC rule;
\- creating the necessary URR(s) for each monitoring key, charging key,
combination of Charging Key and Service ID, or combination of Charging Key,
Sponsor ID and Application Service Provider Id if included in the predefined
PCC or ADC rule;
and then:
\- associating the created URR(s) to the newly created PDR(s);
\- associating the existing FAR or the new FAR to the newly created PDR(s);
Optionally, the traffic handling policies common to many PFCP sessions (i.e.
predefined PDR(s) / QER(s) / FAR(s) / URR(s)) may be configured in the UP
function. The CP function may activate these traffic handling policies by
including the Activate Predefined Rules IE or by including predefined
FAR/URR/QER ID(s) (of which the most significant bit is set to \"1\") within:
\- the Create PDR IE in an PFCP Session Establishment Request; or
\- the Update PDR IE in an PFCP Session Modification Request.
> If the CP function activates the traffic handling policies by including
> predefined FAR/URR/QER ID(s), i.e. where bit 8 is set to \"1\", then
> Create/Update FAR/URR/QER IE(s) that shares the same ID shall not be
> present.
>
> **If the received Create/Update PDR IE contains both the** Activate
> Predefined Rules IE and a predefined FAR/URR/QER ID (bit 8 set to \"1\"), it
> is an implementation matter how the UPF handles the message. The UPF shall
> either overwrite the FAR/URR/QER referenced by the Activate Predefined Rules
> IE with those referenced by the received FAR/URR/QER ID, or reject the
> message with the Cause value \"Rule creation/modification Failure\" and the
> Failed Rule ID IE (see clause 8.2.1).
NOTE 1: The **Create/Update PDR IE can contain** only dynamic FAR/URR/QER ID.
Such dynamic rules provision the UPF with information that was not
preconfigured, e.g. with a remote GTP-U F-TEID.
For traffic matching PDR(s) associated with the activated predefined rules,
the UP function shall enforce the rules, e.g. for URR, the UP function shall
generate Usage Report(s) and send it to the CP function and the CP function
shall be able to handle the usage reports as described in clause 5.2.2.
NOTE 2: The URR IDs used in reports triggered by a predefined rule in UP
function are also pre-configured at the CP function.
The URR ID used in the usage report may be a predefined URR ID or a URR ID
dynamically provisioned by the CP function.
For deactivating predefined rules which have been activated in the UP function
using a Predefined Rule Name, the CP function shall include the Deactivate
Predefined Rules IE in the Update PDR IE in a PFCP Session Modification
Request to inform the UP function to deactivate the corresponding predefined
rules for the related PDR.
For deactivating predefined FAR(s) /URR(s) / QER(s) which have been activated
in the UP function by including predefined FAR/URR/QER ID(s) in the Create PDR
IE or Update PDR IE, the CP function may include Remove FAR IE(s), Remove URR
IE(s) and/or Remove QER IE(s) to delete the corresponding predefined
FAR/URR/QER ID in an PFCP Session Modification Request message.
NOTE 3: Using Remove FAR IE(s), Remove URR IE(s) and Remove QER IE(s) does not
result in any change to predefined rules that was activated using the Activate
Predefined Rules IE. Such predefined rules continue to apply if still
activated for the PDR.
### 5.4.10 Charging
For EPC, the charging requirements for online and offline charging in the PS
domain specified in 3GPP TS 32.251 [17] shall be preserved with a split SGW,
PGW and TDF architecture.
For 5GC, the charging requirements for online and offline charging in the 5G
data connectivity domain are specified in 3GPP TS 32.255 [45].
Charging is supported by the CP function by activating in the UP function the
measurement and reporting of the accumulated usage of network resources per:
\- for EPC:
\- IP-CAN bearer, for an SGW;
\- IP-CAN bearer, IP-CAN session and/or individual or group of service data
flows, for a PGW;
\- TDF session and/or individual or group of applications, for a TDF;
\- for 5GC:
\- PDU session and/or individual or group of service data flows, for an SMF;
\- QoS Flow, for an SMF.
See clauses 5.3 and 7.8.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
The CP function shall control the usage measurement and reporting in the UP
function by:
\- creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the service data flow,
application, bearer or session, if not already existing;
\- creating URR(s) for each Charging Key, combination of Charging Key and
Service ID, or combination of Charging Key, Sponsor ID and Application Service
Provider Id;
\- associating the URR(s) to the relevant PDRs defined for the PFCP session,
for usage reporting at IP-CAN bearer, IP-CAN session, TDF session, SDF or
application level.
For online charging, the CP function shall provision the URR with the Volume
(or Time) Quota, and with the Volume (or Time) Quota if a quota threshold was
received from the OCS, as specified in clause 5.2.2.2. Besides, when the OCS
provides a final quota and requests to redirect the traffic towards a redirect
destination when exhausing this quota, the CP function shall redirect the
traffic towards a redirect destination as specified in clause 5.4.7 upon being
notified that the final quota has been reached; to permit HTTP traffic
redirection, the UP function should have at least one HTTP packet, e.g. the UP
function may store one packet when reaching the Volume (or Time) Quota. An
example call flow is depicted in Annex C.2.1.1.
To avoid the risk of signalling storms between the CP and UP functions at
times of tariff change, the CP function may include the Monitoring Time IE and
zero or more Additional Monitoring IEs in the URR and set it to the time of
tariff change to request the UP function to report separately the resource
usage before and after the time of tariff change (see e.g. clause 6.3.7.1 of
3GPP TS 32.299 [18]).
### 5.4.11 (Un)solicited Application Reporting
For EPC, (un)solicited Application Reporting refers to the process of
reporting the start or stop of applications by the TDF or PCEF. See 3GPP TS
23.203 [3] and 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
For 5GC, solicited Application Reporting refers to the process of reporting
the start or stop of applications by the SMF to the PCF. See 3GPP TS 23.503
[44] and 3GPP TS 29.512 [41]. Unsolicited application reporting is not
applicable for 5GC.
The CP function shall instruct the UP function to detect and report
applications by:
\- creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the applications to detect;
\- creating a URR with the Reporting Trigger IE set to detect the start and/or
stop of Traffic;
\- the CP function may include a zero quota together with a FAR ID for Quota
Action IE in the URR to instruct the UP function to drop or buffer the packets
pertaining to the detected application traffic before the quota is granted in
the subsequent PFCP Session Modification Request message. The FAR identified
by the FAR ID for Quota Action shall be provisioned according to the
\"sdfHandl\" instruction received from the PCF or the local policies as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [41].
NOTE 1: The (normal) FAR associated with the PDR detecting the application
traffic is used when the URR is later on provisioned with a non-zero quota.
\- associating the URR to the PDR.
For unsolicited application reporting, a PFCP session which is not linked to
any specific TDF session may be established and the PDI in the PDR(s) does not
contain any UE IP address.
When detecting the start or stop of an application, the UP function shall then
initiate the PFCP Session Report procedure and send a Usage Report with the
Usage Report Trigger set to \'Start of Traffic\' or \'Stop of Traffic\'. The
UP function shall also include the following information in the Usage Report:
\- when reporting the start of an application:
\- the Application ID;
\- the Flow Information including the Flow Description and the Flow Direction,
if the traffic flow information is deducible;
\- the Application-Instance-Identifier, if the traffic flow information is
deducible; and
\- if no UE IP address was provisioned in the PDI, the UE\'s IP address, and
the Network instance when multiple PDNs with overlapping IP addresses are used
in the UP function.
NOTE 2: When the CP function instructs the UP function to perform unsolicited
application reporting, the PDI in the corresponding PDR has no UE IP address.
\- when reporting the stop of an application:
\- the Application ID;
\- the Application-Instance-Identifier, if an Application Identifier was
provided when reporting the start of the application;
\- if no UE IP address was provisioned in the PDI, the UE\'s IP address, and
the Network instance when multiple PDNs with overlapping IP addresses are used
in the UP function.
The UP function shall only report the Application ID when detecting the start
or stop of an application and the Reduced Application Detection Information
flag is set in the Measurement Information of the URR, e.g. for envelope
reporting.
### 5.4.12 Service Identification for Improved Radio Utilisation for GERAN
Service Identification for improved radio utilization for GERAN refers to the
process in the PGW of marking DL user plane traffic with a Service Class
Indicator (SCI) value. See clause 5.3.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [19].
This is controlled by the PGW-C by associating a QER, including the Service
Class Indicator within the DL Flow Level Marking IE, to the PDR matching the
DL traffic to be marked. The PGW-U performs the SCI marking for the detected
DL traffic and sends the packet with the GTP-U Service Class Indicator
Extension Header downstreams.
The PGW-C may stop the SCI marking during the PFCP session by removing the
related QER or removing the DL Flow Level Marking IE from the related QER, the
PGW-U shall then stop such function consequently.
### 5.4.13 Transport Level Marking
For EPC, transport level marking is performed on a per EPS bearer basis in the
SGW and PGW. Transport level marking refers to the process of marking traffic
with a DSCP value based on the locally configured mapping from the QCI and
optionally the ARP priority level.
For 5GC, transport level marking is performed on a per QoS flow basis.
Transport level marking refers to the process of marking traffic at the UPF
with a DSCP value based on the mapping from the 5QI, the Priority Level (if
explicitly signalled) and optionally the ARP priority level configured at the
SMF.
Transport level marking shall be controlled by the CP function by providing
the DSCP in the ToS or Traffic Class within the Transport Level Marking IE in
the FAR that is associated to the PDR matching the traffic to be marked. The
UP function shall perform the transport level marking for the detected traffic
and sends the marked packet to the peer entity.
The CP function may change transport level marking by changing the Transport
Level Marking IE in the related FAR.
### 5.4.14 Deferred PDR activation and deactivation
As specified in clause 6.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and clauses 4.5.13 and
4a.5.13 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], Policy and charging control rule operations can
be also performed in a deferred mode. To support such deferred PCC rule
activation or deactivation, the CP function and UP function may optionally
support the Deferred PDR activation and deactivation (DPDRA) as described
below.
If the feature DPDRA is supported in both CP function and UP function, and
when a PCC rule is provisioned in a deferred mode, i.e. with a Rule-
Activation-Time and/or Rule-Deactivation-Time, the CP function shall provision
the corresponding PDR using Create PDR IE or Update PDR together with an
Activation Time and/or Deactivation Time to enable the PDR being activated or
deactivated at requested time.
Without being provisioned together with an Activation Time or a Deactivation
Time, a PDR shall be active immediately when it is received. When the status
of a PDR is changed from active to inactive, the UP function shall keep
storing the inactive PDR together with its associated FAR, URR(s) and QER(s),
and then UP function shall apply the same behavior as if the PDR is deleted.
The CP function shall control at what time the status of a PDR rule changes
using Activation Time and/or Deactivation Time as exactly as being instructed
by the PCRF using a Rule-Activation-Time and/or Rule-Deactivation-Time, as
specified in clause 4.5.13 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
1) If only Activation Time is specified and has not yet occurred, then the UP
function shall set the PDR rule inactive and make it active at that time. If
Activation Time has passed, then the UP function shall immediately set the PDR
rule active.
2) If only Deactivation Time is specified and has not yet occurred, then the
UP function shall set the PDR rule active and make it inactive at that time.
If Deactivation Time has passed, then the UP function shall immediately set
the PDR rule inactive.
3) If both Activation Time and Deactivation Time are specified, and the
Activation Time occurs before the Deactivation Time, and also when the PDR
rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Deactivation Time, the
UP function shall handle the rule as defined in 1) and then as defined in 2).
4) If both Activation Time and Deactivation Time are specified, and the
Deactivation Time occurs before the Activation Time, and also when the PDR
rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Activation Time, the
UP function shall handle the rule as defined in 2) and then as defined in 1).
5) If both Activation Time and Deactivation Time are specified but time has
already occurred for both, and the Activation Time occurs before the
Deactivation Time, then the UP function shall immediately set the PDR rule
inactive.
NOTE 1: If the CP function receives both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-
Deactivation-Time from the PCRF, but time has already occurred for both, and
the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before the Rule-Deactivation-Time, as
alternative to above, the CP function can deactivate the corresponding PDR
rule by provisioning a Deactivation Time which has occurred or removing the
corresponding PDR rule.
6) If both Activation Time and Deactivation Time are specified but time has
passed for both, and the Deactivation Time occurs before the Activation Time,
then the UP function shall immediately set the PDR rule active.
NOTE 2: If the CP function receives both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-
Deactivation-Time from the PCRF, but time has passed for both, and the Rule-
Deactivation-Time occurs before the Rule-Activation-Time, as alternative to
above, the CP function can activate the corresponding PDR rule by provisioning
a activation Time which has occurred in the Update PDR IE, or create the
corresponding PDR rule if the PDR is not provisioned yet.
### 5.4.15 Packet Rate enforcement
#### 5.4.15.1 General
Packet rate enforcement refers to the process of limiting the rate of uplink
and/or downlink packets allowed to be sent for a PDN connection or a PDU
session.
Packet rate enforcement shall be used to support:
\- APN rate control for UE\'s all PDN connections for a given APN in EPC, see
3GPP TS 23.401 [14] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29]. APN rate control is enforced
across N4 interface only for 5GC interworking with EPC scenario (see clause
4.3 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]);
\- Small data rate control for a PDU session in 5GC, see 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]
and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29];
\- Serving PLMN rate control, for downlink traffic, see 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]
and 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
#### 5.4.15.2 Packet rate enforcement over Sxb and N4 interfaces
The CP function may instruct the UP function to perform packet rate
enforcement, during the establishment or the modification of a PFCP session,
over the Sxb and N4 reference points.
The CP function shall control packet rate enforcement in the UP function by:
1) creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the uplink or downlink traffic
to be enforced, if not already existing;
2) creating QER(s) containing the Packet Rate IE with one or more of the
following enforcement rules and information:
\- Maximum Uplink/Downlink Packet Rates (i.e. Number of Uplink/Downlink
Packets Allowed and Time units that determine the time periods for limiting
the packet rates);
\- Additional Maximum Uplink/Downlink Packet Rates (i.e. Number of Additional
Uplink/Downlink Packets Allowed and Time units that determine the time periods
for limiting the packet rates), if additional packets are allowed to be sent
beyond the maximum Uplink/Downlink Packet Rates;
The QER may also contain the Packet Rate Status IE to indicate remaining
numbers of allowed packets until a given time.
The QER may also contain the QER Control Indications IE with the Rate Control
Status Reporting (RCSR) flag, indicating the UP function shall report to the
CP function the status of the packet rate usage when the PFCP session is
released.
3) associating the QER(s) to the UL and/or DL PDRs of the traffic for which
packet rate enforcement is required.
When so instructed, the UP function shall proceed as follows:
1) the UP function shall count UL/DL packets within the time period (e.g. per
minute, per day, etc.) and if the \'maximum allowed rate\' is reached, the UP
function shall discard or delay further packets.
2) If \'Additional Maximum Uplink/Downlink Packet Rates\' are provided, the
UPF shall consider \'maximum allowed rate\' is equal to the \'number of
packets per time unit\' plus the \'number of additional allowed exception
report packets per time unit\'. Otherwise, the UPF shall consider \'maximum
allowed rate\' is equal to the \'number of packets per time unit\'.
3) If the CP function has requested to report the rate control status, the UP
function shall send to the CP function the Packet Rate Status IE, when the
PFCP session is released. Otherwise, the UP function shall not send the Packet
Rate Status IE to the CP function during the release of the PFCP session.
4) If the CP function provided Packet Rate Status information, then the UP
function shall first enforce the rules in the Packet Rate Status IE until
either the packet rate limits are reached, or the validity time expires. Only
after this shall the UP function enforce the rules in the Packet Rate IE.
#### 5.4.15.3 PGW and SMF behaviour
A PGW, SMF or SMF/PGW shall apply APN rate control, Small Data Rate Control
and Serving PLMN rate control by instructing the UP function to perform packet
rate enforcement as described in clause 5.4.15.2 with the following additions:
\- Serving PLMN rate control:
\- the Maximum Downlink Packet Rate shall be set to the DL rate permitted by
the Serving PLMN rate control parameters;
\- the CP function shall indicate to the UP function to not report the status
of the packet rate usage.
NOTE 1: Serving PLMN rate control applies only to control plane PDU sessions
and PDN connections. Uplink rate for Serving PLMN rate control is enforced by
the MME or SMF, so it does not require support from the UP function.
\- Small Data Rate Control:
\- the CP function shall indicate to the UP function to report the status of
the packet rate usage;
\- the QER shall be associated to all the DL/UL PDRs of the PDU session;
\- APN rate control:
\- the CP function shall indicate to the UP function to report the status of
the packet rate usage;
\- the QER shall be associated to all the PDRs of all the PDN connections of
the UE to the same APN, using the QER Correlation ID (see clause 5.2.1).
If both Serving PLMN rate control and Small Data Rate Control are applied in
5GS, or both Serving PLMN rate control and APN rate control are applied in
EPS, the SMF/PGW-C may control packet rate enforcement in the UP function by
provisioning:
\- a QER for Small Data Rate Control/APN rate control, and by associating
DL/UL PDRs to the QER; or
\- alternatively, different QERs for Serving PLMN rate control and for Small
Data Rate Control/APN rate control, and by associating DL PDRs to both of the
QER(s).
APN rate control and Small Data Rate Control are distinct functionalities that
apply in EPS and 5GS respectively. For PDU sessions supporting interworking
with EPC, the SMF/PGW-C shall start APN rate control (if required for the
UE\'s PDN connections to the APN) and stop Small Data Rate Control (if this
was performed for the PDU session) upon 5GS to EPS mobility, and vice-versa
upon EPS to 5GS mobility, e.g. by:
\- updating the information of the QER associated to the UL/DL PDRs with the
packet rates and packet rate status (if available) applicable for APN rate
control or Small Data Rate Control respectively, if the same QER is associated
to UL/DL PDRs when the UE is in EPC and in 5GC; in this case, the SMF/PGW-C
shall also request the UPF/PGW-U to report immediately the packet rate status
at the time of the mobility between 5GS and EPS by including the Query Packet
Rate Status IE in the PFCP Session Modification Request; or
NOTE 2: Requesting the UPF/PGW-U to report immediately the packet rate status
enables to retrieve the current rate status applicable to the source system
before the UPF/PGW-U overwrites the QER parameters with the packet rates and
packet rate status (if available) applicable to the target system.
\- provisioning different QERs for APN rate control and for Small Data Rate
Control, and by associating UL/DL PDRs to the appropriate QER, when the UE is
in EPC or in 5GC. In this case, when releasing the PFCP session, the UP
function shall include the packet rate status for every QER for which this
information has been requested in the corresponding QER Control Indications
IE.
Besides, if the SMF/PGW-C set up additional PDRs in the UP function for S5/S8
tunnels for a PDU session supporting interworking with EPS, these PDRs shall
not be associated to the QER used to perform Small Data Rate Control.
### 5.4.16 QoS differentiation for Stand-alone Non-Public Network (SNPN)
#### 5.4.16.1 General
Support of QoS differentiation for SNPN is described in clause 5.30.2.7 and
clause 5.30.2.8 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
QoS differentiation procedures as described in the following clauses are
optional and may be used when:
\- UE access to PLMN services via SNPN;
\- UE access to SNPN services via PLMN.
#### 5.4.16.2 Access to PLMN services via SNPN
The SMF in PLMN shall provide DSCP(s) within the Transport Level Marking IE(s)
in the FAR(s) that is associated to the PDR(s) matching the traffics to be
marked to the UPF in PLMN.
UPF in PLMN shall perform the DSCP marking for the detected traffic and sends
the marked packet to the N3IWF.
The SMF in SNPN shall provide PDR to the UPF in SNPN, based on the mapping
rules including the mapping between the DSCP markings for the IPsec child SAs
on NWu and the corresponding QoS requirement of the PLMN. The PDR may include
specific DSCP and N3IWF IP address to enable UPF to detect the DL traffic.
The SMF in SNPN may provide the QER associated to the PDR to ensure the QoS
for the DL traffic if the related QoS Flow has been established in the SNPN.
Otherwise, the SMF in SNPN may provide the URR associated to the PDR to
request the reporting of the detected DL traffic, which may be used by the SMF
in SNPN to trigger the PDU session modification procedure to establish the DL
traffic related QoS Flow in SNPN. The URR may include the Reporting trigger
\"Start of application\" to enable the UPF sending Usage report with the usage
report trigger \"START\" to the SMF upon detection of the DL traffic with such
DSCP and N3IWF IP address.
The SMF in SNPN may also provide DSCP within the Transport Level Marking IE in
the FAR that is associated to the PDR. UPF in SNPN shall perform the DSCP re-
marking for the detected traffic and sends the marked packet to the NG-RAN.
#### 5.4.16.3 Access to SNPN services via PLMN
The SMF in SNPN shall provide DSCP(s) within the Transport Level Marking IE(s)
in the FAR(s) that is associated to the PDR(s) matching the traffics to be
marked to the UPF in SNPN.
UPF in SNPN shall perform the DSCP marking for the detected traffic and sends
the marked packet to the N3IWF.
The SMF in PLMN shall provide PDR to the UPF in PLMN, based on the mapping
rules including the mapping between the DSCP markings for the IPsec child SAs
on NWu and the corresponding QoS requirement of the SNPN. The PDR may include
specific DSCP and N3IWF IP address to enable UPF to detect the DL traffic.
The SMF in PLMN may provide the QER associated to the PDR to ensure the QoS
for the DL traffic if the related QoS Flow has been established in the PLMN.
Otherwise, the SMF in PLMN may provide the URR associated to the PDR to
request the reporting of the detected DL traffic, which may be used by the SMF
in PLMN to trigger the PDU session modification procedure to establish the DL
traffic related QoS Flow in PLMN. The URR may include the Reporting trigger
\"Start of application\" to enable the UPF sending Usage report with the usage
report trigger \"START\" to the SMF upon detection of the DL traffic with such
DSCP and N3IWF IP address.
The SMF in PLMN may also provide DSCP within the Transport Level Marking IE in
the FAR that is associated to the PDR. UPF in PLMN shall perform the DSCP re-
marking for the detected traffic and sends the marked packet to the NG-RAN.
## 5.5 F-TEID Allocation and Release
### 5.5.1 General
For EPC and 5GC, F-TEID shall be only allocated by the UP function, see clause
5.8.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501[28].
The UP function shall set the FTUP feature flag in the UP Function Features IE
(see clause 8.2.25) and the CP function shall request the UP function to
allocate the F-TEID. The UP function shall reject a request to establish a new
PDR with an F-TEID allocation in the CP function option, with the cause
\"Invalid F-TEID allocation option\". As an exception, the UP Function shall
accept the PFCP Session Establishment Request message with a PDR including an
existing F-TEID to re-establish a PFCP session during a restoration procedure
as specified in clause 4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [40] and clauses 16.1A.4 and
17.1A.4 of 3GPP TS 23.007 [24].
### 5.5.2 Void
### 5.5.3 F-TEID allocation in the UP function
The CP function shall request the UP function to allocate the F-TEID by
setting the CHOOSE flag in the Local F-TEID IE of the PDR IE (see Table
7.5.2.2-1). The Source Interface IE indicates for which interface the F-TEID
is to be assigned.
The CP function may request the UP function to allocate the same F-TEID to
several PDRs to be created within one single PFCP Session Establishment
Request or PFCP Session Modification Request by:
\- setting the CHOOSE flag in the Local F-TEID IE of each PDR to be created
with a new F-TEID; and
\- setting the CHOOSE ID field of the Local F-TEID IE, for each PDR to be
created with the same F-TEID, with the same CHOOSE ID value;
or, if the UP function indicated support of the PDI optimization (see clause
8.2.25), by:
\- including the Local F-TEID IE only in the Create Traffic Endpoint IE and by
setting the CHOOSE flag in the Local F-TEID IE of this IE; and
\- including the Traffic Endpoint ID in all the PDRs to be created with the
same F-TEID.
If the PDR(s) is created successfully, the UP function shall return the
F-TEID(s) it has assigned to the PDR(s) or to the Traffic Endpoint(s) in the
PFCP Session Establishment Response or PFCP Session Modification Response.
Upon receiving a request to remove a PDR or a Traffic Endpoint, or to delete a
PFCP session, the UP function shall free the F-TEID(s) that was assigned to
the PDR if there is no more PDR with the same F-TEID, to the Traffic Endpoint
or to the PFCP Session.
When using redundant GTP-U transmission on N3/N9 interfaces (see clause
5.24.2), the CP function shall request the UP function to allocate the F-TEID
for the redundant GTP-U tunnel following the same requirements as specified in
this clause, using the \"Local F-TEID for Redundant Transmission\" IE instead
of the \"Local F-TEID\" IE.
## 5.6 PFCP Session Handling
### 5.6.1 General
The following clauses provide details on PFCP Sessions handling.
### 5.6.2 Session Endpoint Identifier Handling
The SEID uniquely identifies a PFCP session at an IP address of a PFCP entity.
The F-SEID is the Fully Qualified SEID and it contains the SEID and IP
address. The PFCP endpoint locally assigns the SEID value the peer PFCP side
has to use when transmitting message. The SEID values are exchanged between
PFCP endpoints using PFCP messages. The PFCP entity communicates to the peer
PFCP entity the SEID value at which it expects to receive all subsequent
control plane messages related to that PFCP session via the \"F-SEID\" IE.
The PFCP session related messages shall share the same F-SEID for the PFCP
session. An F-SEID shall be released after the PFCP session is released.
### 5.6.3 Modifying the Rules of an Existing PFCP Session
The following principles shall apply, unless specified otherwise in the
specification.
When modifying an existing PFCP session, the CP function shall only provide in
the PFCP Request message the requested changes compared to what was previously
provisioned in the UP function for this PFCP session, i.e. the CP function
shall:
\- include IEs which needs to be newly provisioned in the UP function;
\- include IEs which need to be provisioned with a modified value;
\- remove IEs which need to be removed from the set of parameters previously
provisioned in the UP function, as further specified below.
The CP function shall remove IEs which needs to be removed by either:
\- removing the entire Rule if no other parameter of that rule needs to remain
provisioned in the UP function, e.g. by including the Remove URR IE in the
PFCP Session Modification Request; or
\- updating the Rule including the IEs to be removed with a null length, e.g.
by including the Update URR IE in the PFCP Session Modification Request with
the IE(s) to be removed with a null length. For an IE with multiple
occurrences, e.g. when the description of the IE contains the text \"several
IEs with the same IE type may be present\", one occurrence of such an IE with
a null length shall result in removing all the IEs with the same IE type.
The CP function shall set a URR ID and/or QER ID with a length \"0\" in the
Update PDR IE within PFCP Session Modification Request, to request the UP
function to stop applying the URRs and/or QERs for this PDR.
Upon receipt of a PFCP Request which modifies an existing PFCP session, the UP
function shall add, update or remove the parameters as instructed by the CP
function, as defined above, and shall keep unchanged the set of parameters
previously provisioned in the UP function which are neither modified nor
removed.
## 5.7 Support of Lawful Interception
### 5.7.1 General
This clause specifies lawful interception with PFCP in EPC.
### 5.7.2 Lawful Interception in EPC
Requirements for support of Lawful Interception with a split SGW or PGW are
specified in clauses 12.9 and 20.4 of 3GPP TS 33.107 [20].
User plane packets shall be forwarded from the UP function to the SX3LIF (or
LMISF for S8HR) by encapsulating the user plane packets using GTP-U
encapsulation (see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]).
The CP function shall instruct the UP function to duplicate the packets to be
intercepted and to forward them to the SX3LIF (or to the LMISF for S8HR) as
specified in clause 5.2.3.
For forwarding data from the UP function to the SX3LIF (or LMISF for S8HR),
the CP function shall set the DUPL flag in the Apply Action and set the
Duplicating Parameters in the FAR, associated to the PDRs of the traffic to be
intercepted, with the Destination Interface \"LI Function\" and set to perform
GTP-U encapsulation and to forward the packets to a GTP-u F-TEID uniquely
assigned in the SX3LIF (or LMISF for S8HR) for the traffic to be intercepted.
The SX3LIF (or LMISF for S8HR) shall then identify the intercepted traffic by
the F-TEID in the header of the encapsulating GTP-U packet.
### 5.7.3 Lawful Interception in 5GC
Requirements for support of Lawful Interception with SMF and UPF are specified
in clauses 6.2.3 of 3GPP TS 33.127 [47]. The PFCP protocol is not used for
Lawful Interception in 5GC.
## 5.8 PFCP Association
### 5.8.1 General
A PFCP Association shall be set up between the CP function and the UP function
prior to establishing PFCP sessions on that UP function. Only one PFCP
association shall be setup between a given pair of CP and UP functions, even
if the CP and/or UP function exposes multiple IP addresses. A single PFCP
association may also be setup between a SMF set and a UPF (see clause 5.22.2).
The CP function and the UP function shall support the PFCP Association Setup
procedure initiated by the CP function (see clause 6.2.6.2). The CP function
and the UP function may additionally support the PFCP Association Setup
procedure initiated by the UP function (see clause 6.2.6.3).
A CP function may have PFCP Associations set up with multiple UP functions. A
UP function may have PFCP Associations set up with multiple CP functions.
A CP function or a UP function shall be identified by a unique Node ID. A Node
ID may be set to an FQDN or an IP address (see clause 8.2.38). When set to an
IP address, it indicates that the CP/UP function only exposes one IP address
for the PFCP Association signalling.
The PFCP entities shall accept any new IP address allocated as part of F-SEID
other than the one(s) communicated in the Node Id.
NOTE 1: The source IP address to send PFCP Association Setup request can not
be used as the destination IP address when the peer sends a PFCP Association
Update Request message, e.g. for a scenario when a NAT is deployed in the
network.
Prior to establishing a PFCP Association, the function responsible for
establishing the PFCP Association (e.g. CP function) shall look up a peer
function (e.g. UP function), e.g using DNS procedures (see 3GPP TS 29.303
[25]), NRF procedures (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [43]) or local configuration. If the
peer function is found to support multiple IP addresses (in the look up
information), one of these addresses (any one) shall be used as destination IP
address to send the PFCP Association Setup Request. Once the PFCP Association
is established, any of the IP addresses of the peer function (found during the
look-up) may then be used to send subsequent PFCP node related messages and
PFCP session establishment requests for that PFCP Association.
NOTE 2: The look up information (e.g. in DNS, NRF or local configuration of
the function responsible for establishing the PFCP association) needs to be
configured consistently with the addressing information of the peer function.
If a FQDN is configured to identify a function in DNS or NRF, then the Node ID
of that function included in PFCP messages need to be set to the same FQDN.
For instance, if the CP function is responsible for establishing the PFCP
association, a UP function that exposes multiple IP addresses (for PFCP node
related messages and PFCP session establishment requests) needs to be
configured in the look up information as one (single) UP function that is
associated to multiple IP addresses. The Node ID needs to be set to an SMF set
FQDN when a single association is setup between an SMF set and UPF (see clause
5.22.2).
NOTE 3: PFCP session related messages for sessions that are already
established are sent to the IP address received in the F-SEID allocated by the
peer function or to the IP address of an alternative SMF in the SMF set (see
clause 5.22). The former IP address needs not be configured in the look up
information. See 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.
### 5.8.2 Behaviour with an Established PFCP Association
When a PFCP Association is established with a UP function, the CP function:
\- shall provision node related parameters (i.e. parameters that apply to all
PFCP sessions) in the UP function, if any, e.g. PFDs;
\- shall provision the UP function with the list of features (affecting the UP
function behaviour) the CP function supports, if any, e.g. support of load
and/or overload control;
\- shall check the responsiveness of the UP function using the Heartbeat
procedure as specified in clause 6.2.2;
\- may establish PFCP sessions on that UP function;
\- shall refrain from attempting to establish new PFCP sessions on the UP
function, if the UP function has indicated it will shut down gracefully.
When a PFCP Association is established with a CP function, the UP function:
\- shall update the CP function with the list of features it supports;
\- shall update the CP function with its load and/or overload control
information, if load and/or overload control is supported by the CP and UP
functions;
\- shall accept PFCP Session related messages from that CP function (unless
prevented by other reasons, e.g. overload);
\- shall check the responsiveness of the CP function using the Heartbeat
procedure as specified in clause 6.2.2;
\- shall indicate to the CP function if it will shut down within a graceful
period and, when possible, if it fails and becomes out of service;
\- may report UE IP address usage information to the CP function, if UE IP
addresses are allocated by the UP function and the UE IP Address Usage
Reporting feature is supported by the CP function (see clause 5.21.3.2).
### 5.8.3 Behaviour without an Established PFCP Association
When a PFCP Association is not established with a UP function, the CP
function:
\- shall reject any incoming PFCP Session related messages from that UP
function, with a cause indicating that no PFCP association exists with the
peer entity.
When a PFCP Association is not yet established with a CP function, the UP
function:
\- shall reject any incoming PFCP Session related messages from that CP
function, with a cause indicating that no PFCP association exists with the
peer entity.
## 5.9 Usage of Vendor-specific IE
Vendor-specific IEs are defined to cover requirements and features not
specified by 3GPP.
NOTE 1: When an IE is intended to be used by more than one vendor, the
definition of the IE is encouraged to be specified by 3GPP to ease
implementation and interoperability.
NOTE 2: The PFCP entities can use Vendor-specific IE(s) in the PFCP message
relevant to the PFCP Association Setup procedure to learn which vendor
specific enhancements are supported by the peer.
Vendor-specific IE may be sent with any PFCP message. Vendor-specific IE may
be added directly to a PFCP message, or by embedding it into a grouped IE.
In a network with Vendor specific enhancements, unrecognized vendor specific
IEs shall be handled as unknown optional IEs.
## 5.10 Error Indication Handling
Upon receipt of a GTP-U Error Indication message, the UP function:
\- shall identify the related PFCP session for which the message is received;
and
\- shall initiate a PFCP Session Report procedure, towards the CP function
controlling this PFCP session, to send an Error Indication Report including
the remote F-TEID signalled in the GTP-U Peer Address IE and the Tunnel
Endpoint Identifier Data I IE of the GTP-U Error Indication (see clause 7.3.1
of 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]).
For EPC, upon receipt of an Error Indication Report, the CP function shall
then identify the bearer for which the Error Indication Report is received
using the remote F-TEID included in the report and proceed as specified in
clauses 21.7 and 21.8 of 3GPP TS 23.007 [24], i.e.:
\- modify the PFCP session to instruct the UP function to buffer DL packets;
\- modify the PFCP session to delete the PDR and FAR, when having to delete a
bearer; or
\- delete the PFCP session, when having to delete the PDN connection.
For 5GC, upon receipt of an Error Indication Report, the SMF shall proceed as
specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [40].
## 5.11 User plane inactivity detection and reporting
**Clause 5.4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14] requires the PGW to** initiate the
**release of an inactive emergency PDN connection**.
**Clause 4.3.7 and** 4.3.2.2.2 **of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29] requires the SMF to be
able to** initiate the **deactivation of the UP connection of an existing PDU
session without user plane activity for a given inactivity period, except for
the H-SMF for** the home routed roaming scenario or except for an always-on
PDU session as described in clause 5.6.8 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
Clause 4.3.5.7 of **3GPP TS 23.502 [29] requires the SMF to be able to**
initiate the **deactivation of the UP connection of an existing PDU session in
source UL CL or source UPF (e.g. PSA2) if** no active traffic over the N9
forwarding tunnel is detected and reported by the Source UL CL.
The CP function may request the UP function to detect and report when no user
plane packets are received for a PFCP session, by provisioning the User Plane
Inactivity Timer IE in the PFCP Session Establishment Request or PFCP Session
Modification Request.
Upon being provisioned with this IE, the UP function shall monitor the user
plane activity of the PFCP session, and report any user plane inactivity
exceeding the duration indicated by this IE by sending a PFCP Session Report
Request with the Report Type set to UPIR (User Plane Inactivity Report). The
UP function shall then continue to process any further user plane packets as
instructed by the rules provisioned for the PFCP session, until receiving any
new instruction from the CP function.
## 5.12 Suspend and Resume Notification procedures
Upon receipt of a Suspend Notification message, the PGW-C should request the
PGW-U to discard packets received for the suspended PDN connection by:
\- setting the DROP flag in the Apply Action IE of the FARs of the
corresponding PFCP session; or
\- setting the gate fields in the Gate Status IE of QERs to the value CLOSED.
Upon being requested to resume the PDN connection, the PGW-C should re-allow
the PGW-U to forward the packets for the PDN connection (unless not permitted
for other reasons) by:
\- setting the FORW flag in the Apply Action IE of the FARs of the
corresponding PFCP session; or
\- setting the gate fields in the Gate Status IE of QERs to the value OPEN.
## 5.13 Ethernet traffic (for 5GC)
### 5.13.1 General
An SMF and UPF may support Ethernet PDU sessions, as specified in clause
5.6.10.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501[28].
A combined PGW-C/SMF and PGW-U/UPF may support Ethernet PDU sessions as
specified in clause 4.3.17.8a of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14] and clause 5.6.10.2 of
3GPP TS 23.501 [28]. In this case, the PGW-C/SMF and PGW-U/UPF shall follow,
respectively, the requirements specified for the SMF and UPF by this clause.
For a PFCP session set up for an Ethernet PDU session, the SMF shall:
\- include the PDN Type IE set to \"Ethernet\" in the PFCP Session
Establishment Request;
\- provision PDR(s), for uplink and/or downlink traffic, with Ethernet Packet
Filter(s), based on at least any combination of:
\- Source/destination MAC address;
\- Ethertype as defined in IEEE 802.3 [31];
\- Customer-VLAN tag (C-TAG) and/or Service-VLAN tag (S-TAG) VID fields as
defined in IEEE 802.1Q [30];
\- Customer-VLAN tag (C-TAG) and/or Service-VLAN tag (S-TAG) PCP/DEI fields as
defined in IEEE 802.1Q [30];
\- IP Packet Filter Set, in case Ethertype indicates IPv4/IPv6 payload;
\- Ethernet PDU Session Information, only possible for a DL PDR, that
identifies all (DL) Ethernet packets matching the PDU session as follows,
based on the N6 Ethernet configuration in the UPF for the associated Network
Instance (see clause 5.6.10.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]):
\- DL traffic based on the MAC address(es) and/or C-TAG and/or S-TAG used by
the UE for the UL traffic, for configurations where more than one PDU Session
to the same DNN (e.g. for more than one UE) corresponds to the same N6
interface;
\- DL traffic from the N6 interface associated to the PDU session, for
configurations where there is a one-to-one relationship between a PDU Session
and a N6 interface (in which case the UPF does not need to be aware of MAC
addresses and/or C-TAG and/or S-TAG used by the UE in order to route down-link
traffic).
NOTE 1: For instance, the SMF can provision a DL PDR with just an \"Ethernet
PDU Session Information\", in a Traffic Endpoint ID or in a PDI, or Ethernet
Packet Filters in a PDI, or both an \"Ethernet PDU Session Information\" in a
Traffic Endpoint ID and Ethernet Packet Filters in a PDI.
The SMF may also request a UPF, acting as a PDU session anchor, to:
\- redirect Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) (see IETF RFC 826 [32]) or IPv6
Neighbour Solicitation traffic (see IETF RFC 4861 [33]) to the SMF as
specified in clause 5.13.2, or to respond to ARP or IPv6 Neighbour
Solicitation based on the local cache information as specified in clause
5.13.3;
\- report the MAC (Ethernet) addresses and possibly associated VLAN tag(s)
used as source address of frames sent UL by the UE, as specified in clause
5.13.5;
\- update its list of MAC addresses and possibly associated VLAN tag(s)
associated to the PDU session, during an Ethernet PDU session anchor
relocation, as specified in clause 5.13.6.
For a PFCP session set up for an Ethernet PDU session, the UPF shall:
\- detect Ethernet traffic, based on Ethernet Packet Filter(s) provisioned in
PDR(s) by the SMF, and process the Ethernet traffic as instructed in the FAR,
QER(s) and URR(s) associated to the PDR(s);
\- forward Address Resolution Protocol (see IETF RFC 826 [32]) or IPv6
Neighbour Solicitation messages (see IETF RFC 4861 [33]) to the SMF, as
specified in clause 5.13.2, if so required by the SMF;
\- respond to Address Resolution Protocol (see IETF RFC 826 [32]) or IPv6
Neighbour Solicitation (see IETF RFC 4861 [33]) based on the local cache
information, as specified in clause 5.13.3, if so required by the SMF.
NOTE 2: Ethernet Preamble and Start of Frame delimiter are not sent over 5GS.
NOTE 3: How the UPF/SMF builds the ARP or the IPv6 Neighbour cache is not
specified in this release and is implementation specific.
### 5.13.2 Address Resolution Protocol or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation Response
by SMF
If the SMF requests the UPF to forward all Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
(see IETF RFC 826 [32]) or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation (see IETF RFC 4861
[33]) traffic to the SMF to respond to the ARP or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation
based on the local cache information for Ethernet PDU sessions, the SMF shall
provision a PDR in the UPF with:
\- an Ethernet Packet Filter containing EtherType 2054 (hexadecimal 0x0806)
and associate the PDR with a FAR, for forwarding ARP traffic to the SMF;
and/or
\- a PDI containing an application ID such that the identified application ID
matches against EtherType 34525 (hexadecimal 0x86DD), IPv6 Next Header type as
58 and ICMP Field Type as 135 and associate the PDR with a FAR, for forwarding
IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation traffic to the SMF.
In this case, the user plane packets shall be forwarded between the CP and UP
functions by encapsulating the user plane packets using GTP-U encapsulation
(see clause 5.3.1).
The SMF shall respond to ARP and/or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28], clause 5.6.10.2 in this case.
### 5.13.3 Address Resolution Protocol or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation Response
by UPF
If the SMF requests the UPF to respond to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
(see IETF RFC 826 [32]) or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation (see IETF RFC 4861
[33]) based on the local cache information for an Ethernet PDU session, the
SMF shall provision a PDR in the UPF with:
\- an Ethernet Packet Filter containing EtherType 2054 (hexadecimal 0x0806)
and associate the PDR with a FAR that has the ARP bit in Proxying IE of the
Forwarding Parameters IE set to \"1\"; or
\- a PDI containing an application ID such that the identified application ID
matches against EtherType 34525 (hexadecimal 0x86DD), IPv6 Next Header type as
58 and ICMP Field Type as 135 and associate the PDR with a FAR that has the
INS bit in Proxying IE of the Forwarding Parameters IE set to \"1\".
The UPF shall respond to ARP and/or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28], clause 5.6.10.2 in this case.
### 5.13.3A Provisioning of MAC addresses and SDF filters in Ethernet Packet
Filters
The provisioning of an SDF Filter in an Ethernet Packet Filter shall follow
the requirements specified for provisioning an SDF Filter in clause 5.2.1A.2A.
Likewise, the source and destination MAC addresses information, when
provisioned, shall be set as for downlink Ethernet flows. The UP function
shall apply source and destination MAC addresses information based on the
Source Interface of the PDR, according to the same principles as specified in
clause 5.2.1A.2A, e.g. swapping the source and destination MAC addresses
information if the Source Interface is ACCESS, and applying them as
provisioned if the Source Interface is CORE.
### 5.13.4 Bidirectional Ethernet Filters
The CP function may provision bidirectional Ethernet Filters in the UP
function (see clause 7.5.2.2-x), i.e. Ethernet filters that may be associated
to both uplink and downlink PDRs of a same PFCP session, as follows:
\- when provisioning a bidirectional Ethernet Filter the first time for a PFCP
session, the CP function shall set the BIDE (Bidirectional Ethernet Filter)
flag in the Ethernet Filter Properties IE and provision the Ethernet filter
definition together with a Ethernet Filter ID uniquely identifying the
Ethernet Filter among all the Ethernet Filters provisioned for a given PFCP
session; the source and destination MAC addresses information, in a
bidirectional Ethernet filter, shall be set as for downlink Ethernet flows;
\- the CP function may then provision a PDR for the same PFCP session but the
opposite direction, by provisioning the Ethernet Filter ID in the Ethernet
filter ID field of the PDI, without provisioning again the Ethernet Filter
Properties and Ethernet filter definition.;
\- when being provisioned with a bidirectional Ethernet Filter in a PDR, the
UP function shall apply the Ethernet filter according to the direction of the
PDR as specified in clause 5.13.3A, i.e. the UP function shall apply the
Ethernet filter parameters provisioned for the Ethernet filter ID, but with
swapping the source and destination MAC addresses, and the source and
destination IP addresses if any, if the PDR is set for uplink Ethernet flows;
\- the UP function shall apply any modification of a bidirectional Ethernet
Filter to all PDRs of the PFCP session making use of this Ethernet Filter;
\- upon deletion of a PDR making use of a bidirectional Ethernet Filter, the
UP function shall still apply the Ethernet Filter for any other PDR making use
of the Ethernet Filter.
The requirements specified for provisioning of MAC addresses and SDF Filters
in clause 5.13.A shall also apply when provisioning bidirectional Ethernet
Filters.
### 5.13.5 Reporting of UE MAC addresses to the SMF
In a PFCP Session Establishment Request or a PFCP Session Modification
Request, the SMF may request the UPF to start or stop (in a PFCP Sesssion
Modification Request only) reporting the UE MAC addresses, i.e. the different
MAC (Ethernet) addresses used as source address of frames sent UL by the UE in
a PDU Session, by:
\- creating a URR requesting the UPF to report Ethernet traffic information
(i.e. with the Reporting Trigger set to \'MAC Addresses Reporting\'); and
\- associating the URR to the PDR provisioned for the UL traffic of the PDU
session.
The SMF may additionally request the UPF to detect and report when no user
plane packets are received for an UE MAC address, by provisioning the Ethernet
Inactivity Timer IE in the URR.
When being requested to start reporting the UE MAC addresses, the UPF shall:
\- report immediately any UE MAC addresses (and possibly their associated VLAN
tags) known to be associated to the PDU session (e.g. if the request to start
monitoring of traffic is received after the PFCP session establishment and if
the UPF monitors the UE MAC addresses for the routing of DL traffic);
\- report new UE MAC addresses (and possibly their associated VLAN tags) that
are detected subsequently;
\- report UE MAC addresses (and possibly their associated VLAN tags) that are
removed subsequently from the PDU session, based on the detection of absence
of traffic during the Ethernet Inactivity Timer, if this timer is provisioned
in the URR.
NOTE: Numerous UE MAC addresses can be used by a same PDU session. The UP
function can defer a bit the reporting of newly detected or removed UE MAC
addresses to allow the reporting of multiple UE MAC addresses in a same usage
report. Details are implementation specific.
### 5.13.6 Ethernet PDU session anchor relocation
The UPF (PSA) of an Ethernet PDU session may be relocated as specified in
clause 4.3.5.8 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].
A UPF that supports the Ethernet PDU session relocation procedure shall set
the ETHAR bit in the UP Function Features (see clause 8.2.25).
If the UPF indicated support of Ethernet PDU session anchor relocation, the
SMF may request the UPF to update its list of MAC addresses and possibly
associated VLAN tag(s) associated to the PDU session, during an Ethernet PDU
session relocation procedure, by sending a PFCP Session Modification Request
with Ethernet context information including the MAC addresses (and possibly
associated VLAN tag(s)) received from the old Ethernet PDU session anchor.
Upon receipt of such information, the UPF shall consider these MAC addresses
(and possibly associated VLAN tag(s)) as associated to the PDU session and the
UPF may assist in the update of Ethernet forwarding tables of Ethernet
switches in the DN as specified in clause 4.3.5.8 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].
## 5.14 Support IPv6 Prefix Delegation
**Clause 5.3.1.2.6 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14] and clause 4.6.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.316
[57] specify requirements for IPv6 Prefix Delegation via DHCPv6, that allow
assigning a single network prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix to a PDN
connection or a PDU session.**
**The CP function shall assign, or request the UP function to assign (if the
UP function indicates support of the** UEIP feature, see clause 8.2.25**), the
network prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix by provisioning the UE IP
Address IE in the UP function with:**
\- the IPv6D flag set to \"1\" and the IPv6 Prefix Delegation Bits field
**indicating the length of IPv6 Prefix for delegation (see clause 8.2.62)** ;
or
\- the IP6PL flag set to \"1\" and the IPv6 Prefix Length field indicating
t**he length of IPv6 Prefix for delegation (see clause 8.2.62)** , if the UP
function supports the IP6PL feature (see clauses 5.21.1 and 8.2.25).
When UP function is requested to perform UE IP address allocation and IPv6
prefix delegation is used, the IPv6 prefix length may be determined by the CP
function or the UP function:
\- if it is determined by the CP function, the IPv6 Prefix Delegation Bits or
IPv6 Prefix Length fields shall be set according to the desired IPv6 prefix
length by the CP function;
\- or if the IPv6 prefix length is determined by the UP function, the CP
function shall set the IPv6 Prefix Delegation Bits or IPv6 Prefix Length
fields to \"0\".
NOTE: The IPv6 prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix for IPv6 Prefix
Delegation can include the /64 default prefix used for IPv6 stateless
autoconfiguration (in EPS and 5GS) or not (5GS). In the latter case, the total
IPv6 address space available for the PDU Session cannot be aggregated into one
single IPv6 prefix; support of this latter case requires support of the IP6PL
feature (see clauses 5.21.1 and 8.2.25).
**When assigning additional IPv6 prefixes (i.e. prefixes in addition to the
default prefix) to a UE, the CP function shall provision/update the UE IP
Address IE in the PDI which may be as part of a Create PDR IE or a Update PDR
IE, or in the Create** Traffic EndPoint IE or Update Traffic EndPoint IE **to
the UP function as described above.**
## 5.15 Signalling based Trace (De)Activation
The UP function shall set the TRACE feature flag in the UP Function Features
IE if it supports Trace (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [35]).
If the UP function indicated support of Trace, the CP function may activate a
trace session during a PFCP session establishment or a PFCP session
modification procedure, by including the Trace Information IE in the PFCP
Session Establishment Request or PFCP Session Modification Request.
The CP function may deactivate an on-going trace session by including the
Trace Information IE with a null length in a PFCP Session Modification
Request.
There shall be at most one trace session activated per PFCP session at a time.
## 5.16 Framed Routing
Framed routing allows to support an IP network behind a UE, such that a range
of IP addresses or IPv6 prefixes is reachable over a single PDU session, e.g.
for enterprise connectivity. Framed routes are IP routes behind the UE. The
UPF advertizes relevant IP routes to receive packets destined to these
destination IP addresses or IPv6 prefixes and to forward these packets over
the PDU session. See clause 5.6.14 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28], IETF RFC 2865 [37],
IETF RFC 3162 [38]) and the Framed-Route, Framed-Routing and Framed-IPv6-Route
AVPs specified in 3GPP TS 29.061 [39] and 3GPP TS 29.561 [49].
Framed routing is defined only for PDN connections and PDU sessions of the IP
type (IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6).
A UPF may indicate support of framed routing by setting the FRRT flag in the
UP Function Features IE. If so, the CP function may include Framed-Route IEs,
the Frame-Routing IE and Framed-IPv6-Route IEs in PDRs to describe framed
routes associated to the PDU session.
The UP function shall:
\- match the source IP address of packets with IP Address(es) or IPv6 prefixes
as indicated in the the Framed-Route IE or Framed-IPv6-Route IE if it is
provisioned in a UL PDRs;
\- match the destination IP address of packets with IP Address(es) or IPv6
prefixes as indicated in the the Framed-Route IE or Framed-IPv6-Route IE if it
is provisioned in a DL PDRs.
## 5.17 5G UPF (for 5GC)
### 5.17.1 Introduction
The following clauses describe the 5GS specific functionalities of a UP
function.
### 5.17.2 Uplink Classifier and Branching Point
The Uplink Classifier and Branching Point functionalities refer to the
capability of the UPF to route uplink traffic flows of the same PFCP session
(PDU session) to two or more PDU Sessions Anchors, and to route the downlink
traffic flows from these PDU Session Anchors on the tunnel towards the UE.
They are defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].
Uplink Classifier is supported for PDU sessions of type IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6 or
Ethernet. The routing of the uplink traffic flows to different PDU Session
Anchors is based e.g. on the destination IP address/Prefix of the uplink
packets for an IP PDU session.
Branching Point is supported for multi-homed PDU sessions of type IPv6, i.e.
PDU sessions with multiple IPv6 prefixes. The routing of the uplink traffic
flows to different PDU Session Anchors is based on the source IP prefix of the
uplink packets.
The SMF may insert an Uplink Classifier or Branching Point, during a PDU
session establishment or modification, by provisioning:
\- two or more UL PDRs, with the appropriate Packet Detection Information, and
with corresponding FARs to route the uplink traffic flows towards the
appropriate PDU Session Anchors;
\- two or more DL PDRs, with the appropriate Packet Detection Information, and
with one (or more FARs) to route the downlink traffic flows on the tunnel
towards the UE.
NOTE 1: This uses the generic functionalities of the PFCP protocol described
in this specification, with two or more DL PDRs (for the traffic coming from
the different PDU session anchors).
NOTE 2: A UPF acting as an Uplink Classifier or Branching Point can also
behave as a PDU Session Anchor for the PDU session.
The SMF may remove an Uplink Classifier or Branching Point, during a PDU
session modification, by removing the UL (or modifying the FAR associated to
the UL PDR) and DL PDRs that were setup for the traffic to/from the PDU
Session Anchor(s) to be removed.
### 5.17.3 Data forwarding during handovers between 5GS and EPS
Downlink data may be forwarded during an inter-system handover between 5GS and
EPS using direct or indirect data forwarding.
NOTE: Uplink data is not forwarded during an inter-system handover between 5GS
and EPS in this release of the specification.
Direct data forwarding is performed directly between the source and target
RAN, without the involvement of any UPF to forward the data.
Indirect data forwarding during handovers between 5GS and EPS is supported as
follows (see 3GPP TS 38.300 [42]):
\- For 5G to 4G handover, the source NG-RAN node sends one or several end
markers including one QFI of those QoS flows mapped to the same E-RAB and
sends the end marker packets to the UPF over the PDU session tunnel. UPF
removes the QFI and maps to an appropriate E-RAB tunnel towards SGW.
\- For 4G to 5G handover, the source eNB forwards the received end markers in
the EPS bearer tunnel to the SGW which forwards them to the UPF. The UPF adds
one QFI among the QoS flows mapped to that E-RAB to the end markers and sends
those end markers to the target NG-RAN node in the per PDU session tunnel.
To forward data (G-PDUs and End Marker packets) during a 5GS to EPS handover,
the SMF shall:
\- provision one PDR per E-RAB (that supports data forwarding for at least one
QoS flow), with the list of QFIs that are mapped to the E-RAB;
\- request the UPF to remove the GTP-U PDU Session Container extension header
(including the QFI) from the data by including the GTP-U Extension Header
Deletion field set to \'PDU Session Container\' in the Outer Header Removal IE
of the PDR(s);
\- associate to each PDR a FAR to forward the data to the GTP-U tunnel of the
corresponding E-RAB, i.e. with an Outer Header Creation IE containing the
F-TEID of the (forwarding) SGW for the corresponding forwarding GTP-U tunnel.
To forward data (G-PDUs and End Marker packets) during an EPS to 5GS handover,
the SMF shall:
\- provision one PDR per E-RAB (that supports data forwarding for at least one
QoS flow);
\- create and associate one QER with each PDR, including the QFI IE set to the
QFI value of one of the QoS flows mapped to the E-RAB, to request the UPF to
insert a GTP-U PDU Session Container extension header including the QFI;
\- create one FAR for each data forwarding tunnel in 5GS (i.e. per PDU
session), with an Outer Header Creation IE containing the F-TEID of the target
NG-RAN for the corresponding forwarding GTP-U tunnel;
\- associate each PDR to the corresponding FAR (i.e. to forward the data of
each E-RAB to the data forwarding tunnel of the corresponding PDU session).
## 5.18 Enhanced PFCP Association Release
### 5.18.1 General
To ensure no loss of usage reports and signalling efficiency, during a PFCP
Association Release procedure, which is either initiated by CP function, or
upon request from the UP function, the CP function and UP function may support
the Enhanced PFCP Association Release feature (EPFAR) as described below.
When both the CP function and the UP function support the EPFAR feature, and
when the CP (or UP) function determines that the PFCP association is to be
released, the CP (or UP) function shall send a PFCP Association Update Request
message with a \"PFCP Association Release Preparation Start\" flag to inform
the peer UP (or CP) function that the PFCP Association is going to be released
and the final non-zero usage reports are to be collected for these PFCP
sessions which will be affected by PFCP association release.
The CP function should stop establishing new PFCP sessions in the UP function
after receiving or sending a PFCP Association Release Preparation Start
indication. The CP(or UP) function shall send a PFCP Association Update
Response with a successful cause value to the peer.
Then the UP function shall initiate the PFCP Session Release procedure as
specified in clause 5.18.2 by sending one or more PFCP Session Report Request
messages for the PFCP sessions affected by the release of the PFCP association
and that have non-zero usage reports to be reported. In the PFCP Session
Report Request message, the UP function shall:
\- set the Usage Report Trigger to TEBUR (Termination By UP function Report)
for the usage reports being reported; and
\- set the PSDBU (PFCP Session Deleted By the UP function) flag to \"1\" to
indicate to the CP function that the PFCP Session is being deleted in the UP
function and the usage reports included in the message are the final usage
reports for the given PFCP Session, if this is the last PFCP Session Report
Request message sent for the PFCP session.
When the UP function has sent all the non-zero usage reports for the PFCP
sessions affected by the release of the PFCP Association, the UP function
shall send a PFCP Association Update Request with the flag URSS (non-zero
Usage Reports for the affected PFCP Sessions Sent) set to \"1\" to indicate to
the CP function that all non-zero usage reports for the affected PFCP sessions
have been sent to the CP function and the corresponding PFCP sessions in the
UP function have been locally deleted. The CP function shall then send a PFCP
Association Update Response with a successful cause to the peer to indicate
the PFCP Association Update Request is handled successfully.
The CP function shall then send a PFCP Association Release Request to release
the PFCP Association as specified in clause 6.2.8.
### 5.18.2 UP Function Initiated PFCP Session Release
When the UP function needs delete a PFCP sesssion, e.g. during the Enhanced
PFCP Association Release as described in clause 5.18.1 or when it detects an
error or partial failure, the UP function shall:
\- send one or more PFCP Session Report Request messages for this PFCP
session;
\- set the Report Type to \"USAR\" (Usage Report) if there is non-zero usage
report for the PFCP session, or set the Report Type to \"UISR\" if there is no
usage report to send (e.g. for a session without an URR provisioned or with an
URR provisioned but with only null usage measurements);
\- set the Usage Report Trigger to \"TEBUR\" for non-zero usage report(s), if
usage reports are included in the PFCP Session Report Request message(s); and
\- set the PSDBU flag to \"1\" to indicate to the CP function that the PFCP
session is being deleted, in the last PFCP Session Report Request message sent
for that PFCP session.
NOTE: The UP Function can release one or more PFCP Sessions (without tearing
down the entire PFCP Association) when there is a partial failure in the UP
Function.
## 5.19 Activation and Deactivation of Pre-defined PDRs
To reduce the signalling overhead for establishing a PFCP session (for a PDU
session or a PDN connection) and improve the signalling efficiency, the CP and
UP functions may support the Activation and Deactivation of a Pre-defined PDR
(ADPDP) feature as described below.
When both the CP function and the UP function support the ADPDP feature, the
CP function may activate one or more pre-defined PDRs for a PFCP session
during a PFCP Session Establishment or a PFCP Session Modification procedure.
A pre-defined PDR shall be configured in the UP function before it can be
activated in a PFCP session.
A pre-defined PDR may contain all the necessary packets detection information
to identify a service data flow or application traffic which may be common to
many PFCP sessions, and it may be configured in the UPF associated with a pre-
defined FAR, one or more pre-defined QER(s), and/or one or more pre-defined
URR(s).
Any PFCP session specific information, e.g. traffic endpoint information, may
not be part of a pre-defined PDR and is provisioned before or during the
activation of the pre-defined PDR.
To activate one or more pre-defined PDR(s), the CP function shall provide one
or more Activate Predefined Rules IE(s) in a Create PDR IE in a PFCP Session
Establishment Request, or in a Create PDR IE or an Update PDR IE in a PFCP
Session Modification Request message, that references a pre-defined PDR
configured in the UP function, with the following information in the Create
PDR or Update PDR IE:
\- the traffic endpoint that the traffic shall match (e.g. Local F-TEID, UE IP
Address or Traffic Endpoint ID);
\- optionally the QFI that the traffic shall match, e.g. for a UL PDR where UL
QoS flow binding verification is required (see clause 5.4.2);
\- the precedence to be applied by the UP function among all PDRs of the PFCP
session;
\- optionally, an FAR containing instructions related to the processing of the
packets matching the pre-defined PDR(s); when present, the UP function shall
enforce it instead of the one defined in the pre-defined PDR(s) if any;
\- optionally, one or more URRs to be used in addition to any URR(s) specified
in the pre-defined PDR(s) (e.g. for session level Usage Monitoring);
\- optionally, one or more QERs to be applied in addition to any QER(s)
specified in the pre-defined PDR (e.g. for APN-AMBR enforcement).
When a pre-defined PDR is activated for a given PDR, an incoming packet
matches the PDR if it matches the traffic endpoint, and the QFI if provisioned
and one of the activated pre-defined PDR(s).
The CP function may update the use of pre-defined PDRs that are already
activated in a PFCP session by including one or more Activate Predefined Rules
IE(s) or Deactivate Predefined Rules IE(s) in a PFCP Session Modification
Request and/or by updating the parameters provisioned in the PDR.
NOTE: The CP function cannot change a pre-defined PDR via PFCP session related
procedure.
The CP function may deactivate a pre-defined PDR that is already activated in
a PFCP session by including the Deactivate Predefined Rules IE in a PFCP
Session Modification Request requesting to deactivate the predefined PDR(s).
In addition, this feature allows to define a group of pre-defined PDRs which
can be activated, updated, and deactivated together. This allows the CP
function to further optimize the signaling towards the UP function.
To activate, update, or deactivate a group of pre-defined PDRs, the CP shall
follow the same procedure as for activating, updating, and deactivating a pre-
defined PDR, but it shall use an Activate Predefined Rules IE that refers to a
group of pre-defined PDRs.
## 5.20 Support of Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting for 5GC
### 5.20.1 General
The Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSSS) feature enables
the support of Multi-Access (MA) PDU sessions, using one 3GPP access network
or one non-3GPP access network at a time, or simultaneously using one 3GPP
access network and one non-3GPP access network as defined in clauses 4.2.10
and 5.32 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
The non-3GPP access network may be an untrusted non-3GPP access network, a
trusted non-3GPP access network or a wireline 5G access network. The support
of the ATSSS feature is optional for the SMF and the UPF.
When establishing a PFCP session for a MA PDU session, the SMF (H-SMF for a HR
PDU session) shall select a PSA (UPF) supporting ATSSS (see MPTCP and ATSSS-LL
flags in UP Function Features, Table 8.2.25-1), i.e. ATSSS-LL, MPTCP or both,
and it shall provision in the PSA one Multi-Access Rule (MAR) for every
downlink PDR matching non-GBR traffic sent towards the UE. See clause 5.2.7
for the handling of a MAR.
Distinct N3/N9 tunnels are established for each access network.
### 5.20.2 MPTCP functionality
#### 5.20.2.1 General
The SMF shall instruct the UPF(PSA) to activate MPTCP steering functionality
for a given MA-PDU session if MPTCP needs to be used for TCP traffic flows.
The UPF(PSA) shall allocate resources for MPTCP steering functionality (e.g.
MPTCP Proxy address, UE link-specific multipath IP addresses, etc.), and
perform traffic steering, switching and splitting according to the
instructions from the SMF.
#### 5.20.2.2 Activate MPTCP functionality and Exchange MPTCP Parameters
If MPTCP steering functionality is required for a Multi-Access PDU session,
the SMF shall send MPTCP Control Information to the UPF in PFCP Session
Establishement Request, to instruct the UPF to activate the MPTCP
functionality for this PFCP session. The SMF may also request to activate the
PMF functionality for this PFCP session by sending PMF Control Information to
the UPF. As a result, the UPF(PSA) shall allocate necessary resources for
MPTCP and PMF and return the corresponding MPTCP and PMF Parameters (e.g.
MPTCP IP address and port, UE link-specific multipath IP addresses, PMF IP
address and port, etc.) to the SMF in PFCP Session Establishement Response.
The SMF may send MPTCP Control Information and/or PMF Control Information to
the UPF in PFCP Session Modification Request, with updated value, e.g. if the
SMF receives updated ATSSS rules from the PCF.
NOTE 1: Such MPTCP Parameters received by the SMF are sent to the UE together
with the ATSSS rules, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.193 [59].
When provisioning an UL PDR for user plane traffic for which MPTCP is
applicable, the SMF shall include an MPTCP Applicable Indication IE in the
Create PDR IE.
NOTE 2: This indication can be used by the UPF to prepare itself for the
reception of MPTCP traffic for the PDU session.
#### 5.20.2.3 Control of Multipath TCP Connection Establishment by MPTCP Proxy
When MPTCP steering functionality is utilized, TCP connection establishment
and data exchange between an UE and a remote host shall be proxide by the
MPTCP Proxy in the UPF (PSA), using the mechanism specified in IETF RFC 8684
[62] and IETF RFC 8803 [60].
Once Multipath TCP connection is set up, the MPTCP Proxy shall store the MPTCP
session entry which includes the following information:
\- UE link-specific multipath IP addresses and its TCP port;
\- UE\'s MA-PDU session IP address and its TCP port, if the MA-PDU session IP
address is used by the MPTCP Proxy for IP translation;
\- the N6 routable IP address and its TCP port, if N6 routable IP address is
used by the MPTCP Proxy for IP translation;
\- the remote host IP address and its TCP port.
The stored MPTCP session entry is used by MPTCP Proxy for subsequent IP
translation when receiving uplink or downlink MPTCP traffic.
An UPF implementation may use N6 routable IP address instead of UE\'s MA-PDU
session IP address for IP translation.
NOTE: The DL PDR from the SMF for MPTCP traffic carries the UE\'s MA-PDU
session IP address. If the UPF uses a different N6 routable IP address, it is
UPF implementation specific how to match DL PDRs for MPTCP traffic with
downlink MPTCP traffic received with the destination address set to the N6
routable IP address.
#### 5.20.2.4 Traffic Steering and IP Translation by MPTCP Proxy
Once traffic for which MPTCP is applicable is detected by the UPF, the UPF
shall internally forward this traffic to the MPTCP Proxy for IP translation.
The MPTCP Proxy shall use the stored information in MPTCP session entry to
perform IP translation to the detected MPTCP IP packets, e.g. replace the
source IP address+port and/or destination IP address+port accordingly.
The UPF may detect the uplink IP packets for which MPTCP is applicable by
checking whether the UL PDR matching the user plane traffic is set with an
MPTCP Applicable Indication, or (UPF implementation choice) by checking
whether the source or destination IP address of the user plane packets (after
removing the GTP-U header) correspond to UE link-specific multipath IP
address(es) and the MPTCP proxy IP address.
The UPF may detect the downlink IP packets for which MPTCP is applicable, by
checking the information in the associated MAR (e.g. checking if the steering
functionality is set to MPTCP) or by checking the destination IP address.
### 5.20.3 ATSSS-LL functionality
#### 5.20.3.1 Activate ATSSS-LL functionality and Exchange ATSSS-LL Parameters
If ATSSS-LL steering functionality is required for a Multi-Access PDU session,
the SMF shall send ATSSS-LL Control Information to the UPF in PFCP Session
Establishment Request, to instruct the UPF to activate the ATSSS-LL
functionality for this PFCP session. The SMF may also request to activate the
PMF functionality for this PFCP session by sending PMF Control Information to
the UPF. As a result, the UPF(PSA) shall allocate necessary resources for
ATSSS-LL and PMF and return the corresponding ATSSS-LL and PMF Parameters
(e.g. PMF IP address and port, etc) to the SMF in PFCP Session Establishment
Response.
If the SMF provisions the UPF to apply ATSSS-LL in downlink with \"Smallest
Delay\" steering mode, the UE does not support PMF RTT measurements (see
clause 5.32.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]) and the UPF supports RTT measurements
without PMF, the SMF should instruct the UPF to not use PMF RTT measurements
by setting the DRTTI flag to \"1\" in the PMF Control Information.
NOTE 1: The UPF can measure RTT without using the PMF protocol by using other
means not defined by 3GPP such as using the RTT measurements of MPTCP if there
is an MPTCP connection established between the UE and UPF.
The SMF may send ATSSS-LL Control Information and/or PMF Control Information
to the UPF in PFCP Session Modification Request, with updated value, e.g. if
the SMF receives updated ATSSS rules from the PCF.
NOTE 2: Such ATSSS-LL Parameters received by the SMF are sent to the UE
together with the ATSSS rules, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.193 [59].
### 5.20.4 Handling of GBR traffic of a MA PDU session
#### 5.20.4.1 General
Traffic splitting of a GBR traffic is not supported (see clause 5.32.4 of 3GPP
TS 23.501 [28]). Besides, switching GBR traffic from one access to another
access requires the SMF to send N1/N2 messages to the UE and AN.
DL PDRs corresponding to GBR traffic shall be associated with DL FARs (i.e. no
MAR).
#### 5.20.4.2 Access Availability Reporting
For a MA PDU session using the ATSSS Low Layer (ATSSS-LL) or MPTCP steering
functionality, the SMF may request the UPF to report when it cannot send
downlink GBR traffic over its on-going access, e.g. based on access
availability and unavailability report from the UE, by provisioning an SRR
with an Access Availability Control Information IE requesting the UPF to
report when an access (3GPP or non-3GPP access) becomes available or
unavailable.
If so instructed, when detecting a change in an access availability, the UPF
shall send an Access Availability Report to the SMF, indicating the access
type and whether the access has become available or unavailable.
### 5.20.5 Access type of a MA PDU session becoming (un)available
The access type of a MA PDU session may become unavailable permanently (e.g.
when the UE de-registers from one access) or transiently (e.g. when the UE has
lost coverage of the 3GPP access or non-3GPP access).
When an access type of a MA PDU session becomes permanently unavailable, the
SMF shall send a PFCP Session Modification Request with an Update MAR IE
removing the Access Forwarding Information IE corresponding to the unavailable
access. As a result, the UPF shall not send any more traffic on this access
type.
Reversely, when a new access type becomes available for a MA PDU session, e.g.
when the UE registers on another access and requests to establish user plane
resources for that access, the SMF shall send a PFCP Session Modification
Request with an Update MAR IE adding the Access Forwarding Information IE
corresponding to the new available access type.
When an access type of a MA PDU session becomes transiently unavailable, the
SMF shall notify the UPF that the access type has become unavailable by
sending a PFCP Session Modification Request with the Access Availability
Information IE indicating so. The SMF should then also notify the UPF when the
access type becomes available again.
When being notified by the SMF that an access type has become transiently
unavalaible, the UPF should stop sending DL traffic on this access until it
receives the indication that the access becomes available again from the UE
(i.e. PMF access available report) or the SMF.
### 5.20.6 PMFP message handling in UPF
PMFP messages are used by the PMF functionality in the UE and the PMF
functionality in the UPF (PSA) to perform the following procedures, as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.193 [59]:
\- RTT measurement procedure initiated by the UE, or the UPF;
\- Access available/unavailable report procedure from the UE to the UPF.
PMFP messages shall be exchanged between the UE and the UPF via the default
QoS flow, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]. To support this, the UPF shall
learn the QFI identifying the QoS flow on which PMFP messages from the UE are
transmitted, and shall send downlink PMFP messages on that QoS flow when
needed.
Once an uplink PMFP message is detected, the UPF shall internally forward the
PMFP message to the PMF functionality in the UPF, for subsequent handling.
The PMF functionality in the UPF shall learn the UE\'s address information for
PMFP from the received PMFP message, e.g. to detect the IP address and UDP
port of the PMF in the UE (for IP PDU sessions) or the MAC address of the PMF
in the UE (for Ethernet PDU sessions), for the purpose of sending PMFP
messages to the UE.
## 5.21 UE IP address/prefix Allocation and Release
### 5.21.1 General
Stage 2 requirements for UE IP address allocation in the EPC and 5GC are
specified in clause 5.3.1 of **3GPP TS 23.401 [14],** clause **5.8.2.2 of 3GPP
TS 23.501 [28] and clause 4.6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.316 [57]. The following types of
UE IP addresses may be assigned over N4 or Sxb:**
\- IPv4 address;
\- /64 IPv6 Prefix;
\- IPv6 prefix other than default /64, including individual /128 IPv6 address,
if the UPF indicates supports of the IP6PL feature (see clause 8.2.25), for
IPv6 address allocation using DHCPv6 specified in clause 4.6.2.2 of **3GPP TS
23.316 [57];**
\- IPv6 prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix for support of IPv6 prefix
delegation as specified in **clause 4.6.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.316 [57] and clause
5.14**.
More than one UE IP address may be assigned to a PDU session, if the UPF
indicates supports of the IP6PL feature (see clause 8.2.25), by provisioning
multiple instances of the UE IP Address IE in a same PDI or Traffic Endpoint,
or by provisioning multiple PDIs or Traffic Endpoints with a different UE IP
Address, where the UE IP addresses may correspond e.g. to:
\- multiple /128 IPv6 addresses; or
\- an /64 default prefix used for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration and an IPv6
prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix for IPv6 Prefix Delegation not
including the /64 IPv6 Prefix (i.e. when the total IPv6 address space
available for the PDU Session cannot be aggregated into one single IPv6
prefix); the IPv6 prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix may be assigned
by setting either the IPv6D flag or the IP6PL flag as specified in clause
5.14.
A UE IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix may be allocated by the CP function or the UP
function. A given IP address pool shall be controlled by a unique entity
(either the SMF/PGW-C or the UPF/PGW-U or an external server).
The support of UE IP address/prefix allocation by the CP function is
mandatory. The support of UE IP address/prefix allocation by the UP function
is optional. See clause 5.8.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]. A UPF supporting the
SSET feature (see clause 5.22.2) or the MPAS feature (see clause 5.22.3) shall
support UE IP address/prefix allocation in the UP function.
The UP function shall set the UEIP feature flag in the UP Function Features IE
if it supports UE IP address/prefix allocation in the UP function (see clause
8.2.25). If so, the CP function shall determine whether UE IP address or
prefix is allocated by the CP function or the UP function based on network
configuration.
### 5.21.2 UE IP address/prefix allocation in the CP function
When performing UE IP address allocation in the CP function, the CP function
shall assign the UE IP address/prefix and provide the assigned address/prefix
to the UP function in the UE IP Address IE of the PDR IE (see Table 7.5.2.2-1)
or of the Traffic Endpoint (see Table 7.5.2.7-1). The CP function shall always
provide a full list of assigned address(es)/prefix(es) to the UP function in
the PDI or Create/Update Traffic Endpoint IE.
### 5.21.3 UE IP address/prefix allocation in the UP function
#### 5.21.3.1 General
When performing UE IP address/prefix allocation in the UP function, the CP
function shall request the UP function to allocate the UE IP address/prefix
by:
\- setting the CHOOSE flags (CHOOSE IPV4 and/or CHOOSE IPV6) in the UE IP
Address IE of the PDR IE (see Table 7.5.2.2-1) or of the Traffic Endpoint (see
Table 7.5.2.7-1); the IPv6 prefix length shall be indicated in the UE IP
Address if an IPv6 prefix other than default /64 and other than for IPv6
prefix delegation (see clause 5.14) is to be assigned and the UPF indicated
support of the IP6PL feature (see clause 8.2.25); and
\- including the Network Instance IE to indicate the IP address pool from
which the UE IP address/prefix is to be assigned.
\- optionally including the UE IP address Pool Identity from which the UE IP
address shall be allocated by the UP function.
The CP function may request the UP function to allocate the same UE IP
address/prefix to several PDRs to be created (i.e. using Create PDR) within
one single PFCP Session Establishment Request or PFCP Session Modification
Request, or to several PDRs to be modified (i.e. using Update PDR) within one
single PFCP Session Modification Request by:
\- setting the CHOOSE flags (CHOOSE IPV4 and/or CHOOSE IPV6) in the UE IP
Address IE of each PDR to be created with a new UE IP address/prefix or each
PDR to be modified;
or, if the UP function indicated support of the PDI optimization (see clause
8.2.25), by:
\- including the UE IP Address IE in the Create Traffic Endpoint IE or Update
Traffic Endpoint IE, and by setting the CHOOSE flags (CHOOSE IPV4 and/or
CHOOSE IPV6) in that UE IP Address IE; and
\- including the Traffic Endpoint ID in all the PDRs to be created with the
same UE IP address or all PDRs to be modified with additional UE IP
address(es).
If the PDR(s) is created or modified successfully or the Traffic Endpoint(s)
is created or modified successfully, the UP function shall always return the
full list of UE IP address/prefix in the UE IP Address IE(s) it has assigned
to the PDR(s) or to the Traffic Endpoint(s) in the PFCP Session Establishment
Response or PFCP Session Modification Response.
Upon receiving a request to delete a PFCP session, to remove a Traffic
Endpoint associated with the UE IP address/prefix, or to remove the last PDR
associated with the UE IP address/prefix, the UP function shall release the UE
IP address/prefix that was assigned to the PFCP session, to the Traffic
Endpoint, or to the PDR.
NOTE 1: When the CP function requests additional UE IP Address in the Update
PDR or Update Traffic Endpoint IE, it needs not include any existing UE IP
Address(es).
#### 5.21.3.2 Reporting UE IP Address Usage to the CP function
The UE IP Address Usage Reporting feature (see clause 8.2.58) is an optional
feature. The following requirements shall apply if UE IP addresses are
allocated by the UP function and both the CP function and UP function support
the UE IP Address Usage Reporting feature.
The UP Function should report UE IP address usage information to the CP
function for network instances and/or IP address pools whose ratio of occupied
(i.e. already assigned) IP addresses to the configured IP addresses in the UP
Function exceeds a configurable threshold. The UP function shall do so by
sending one or more PFCP Association Update Request messages to the CP
function, including a UE IP Address Usage Information IE per network instance
and/or IP address pool. Each UE IP Address Usage Information IE shall include
a validity timer that informs the CP function for how long the UE IP address
Usage Information shall be considered as valid. Each UE IP Address Usage
Information shall also contain a UE IP Address Usage Sequence Number, which
enables the CP function to determine the latest UE IP Address Usage
Information generated by the UP function for a given network instance and/or
IP address pool.
The UP function may update the UE IP address usage information reported to the
CP function if needed, by sending subsequent PFCP Association Update
Request/Response messages, including updated UE IP address Usage Information
IEs with a (new) validity timer. The UP function shall increment the UE IP
Address Usage Sequence Number when updating UE IP address usage information.
The UP function shall also increment the UE IP Address Usage Sequence Number
when the IP address usage has not changed but the validity timer needs to be
renewed.
NOTE 1: The threshold value in the UP function needs to be selected in such
way that it avoids frequent UE IP address usage reporting for network
instances and/or UE IP address pools with low usage.
The CP function shall use the latest updated UE IP address Usage Information
received for a given network instance and/or UE IP Address Pool. The CP
function shall ignore a UE IP Address Usage Information IE received for a
given network instance and/or IP address pool with a UE IP Address Usage
Sequence Number smaller or equal to the UE IP Address Usage Sequence Number of
an already received and stored information.
If the validity timer has not expired, the CP function shall keep the latest
updated UE IP Address Usage Information received for a given Network Instance
and/or UE IP Address Pool if it receives a PFCP Association Update
Request/Response not including a UE IP Address Usage Information IE for this
network instance and/or UE IP Address Pool.
NOTE 2: The UE IP Address Usage Information IE may be absent e.g. if the PFCP
Association Update Request/Response is sent for other regular purposes, or if
the ratio remains the same, or if the ratio has not changed enough to justify
being reported again.
The CP function shall delete UE IP Address Usage Information if its validity
period has expired.
## 5.22 PFCP sessions successively controlled by different SMFs of an SMF set
(for 5GC)
### 5.22.1 General
A PFCP session may be controlled by different SMFs of an SMF Set using either
one PFCP association per SMF Set and UPF as described in clause 5.22.2 (called
SSET feature), or with each SMF of the SMF set establishing its own PFCP
association with the UPF as described in clause 5.22.3 (called MPAS feature).
A UPF complying with this version of the specification and that supports being
controlled by an SMF set shall support the procedures specified in clauses
5.22.3 (i.e. MPAS feature) and may support the procedures specified in clause
5.22.2 (i.e. SSET feature).
### 5.22.2 With one PFCP association per SMF Set and UPF
When a UPF supports that a PFCP session can be successively controlled by
different SMF(s) in the same SMF set, the following applies:
1) One SMF in the SMF set shall establish one single PFCP Association with the
UPF for the SMF set; the Node ID in the PFCP Association Setup Request shall
be set to an FQDN representing the SMF set.\ \ The SMF shall indicate that it
supports the SSET feature in the CP Function Features IE (see clause 8.2.58);
this indicates to the UPF that the PFCP sessions established with this PFCP
association can be successively controlled by different SMFs of an SMF set
according to the procedure defined in this clause.\ \ The SMF may also
indicate the IP addresses of alternative SMFs within the SMF Set and the IP
addresses of alternative PFCP entities pertaining to the same SMF in the PFCP
Association Setup Request.
2) When establishing a PFCP session, the SEID that the SMF assigns in the CP
F-SEID of the PFCP Session Establishment Request may be unique or not within
the SMF set. However the assigned CP F-SEID shall be unique within the SMF
set.
NOTE 1: The UPF does not (need to) know whether the SEID in the CP F-SEID is
uniquely assigned in the SMF set or not.
3) Any SMF in the SMF set may issue requests to modify or delete the PFCP
session, or to update or release the PFCP association.
4) The UPF shall initiate PFCP session related requests (e.g. PFCP Session
Report Request) towards another PFCP entity pertaining to the same SMF or
another SMF of the SMF Set, if the IP address included in the CP F-SEID
assigned to the PFCP session is not responsive, or if the UPF receives a GTP-U
Error Indication from the SMF over the N4-u tunnel assigned to the N4 session
for data forwarding if any.\ \ The UPF shall use the IP addresses of
alternative SMFs within the SMF Set and the IP addresses of alternative PFCP
entities pertaining to the same SMF received during the PFCP association setup
or update procedures, if any, or other PFCP entities pertaining to the same
SMF. Otherwise the UPF shall use the SMF set FQDN in the CP Node ID to
discover alternative SMFs within the SMF Set, e.g. by querying the DNS or by
performing a discovery request towards the NRF.\ \ When sending the request to
another PFCP entity pertaining to the same SMF or to the new SMF, the UPF
shall set the SEID field to zero in the PFCP header of the PFCP request and
include the CP F-SEID assigned by the previous SMF in the request.
5) An SMF may redirect a UPF initiated PFCP session related request to another
PFCP entity pertaining to the same SMF or to a different SMF in the SMF set by
rejecting the request with the cause \"Redirection Requested\" and with the IP
address of the new entity to contact. When sending the redirected request to
the new entity, the UPF shall set a null SEID in the header of the PFCP
request and include the CP F-SEID assigned by the previous SMF in the
request.\ \ Alternatively, an SMF may forward the UPF request to another PFCP
entity pertaining to the same SMF or to a new SMF in the SMF set; the new PFCP
entity or the new SMF answers to the UPF, including the CP F-SEID IE with the
IPv4 or IPv6 address of the new entity respectively and the same or a modified
SEID, and optionally including the N4-u F-TEID that the UPF shall use for
sending data towards the new entity.
NOTE 2: This allows to address cases where a different SMF would have been
reselected in the 5GC for the PFCP session, e.g. by an AMF.
6) An SMF may also update, at any time, a PFCP session by including the CP
F-SEID with the IPv4 or IPv6 address of a new SMF and/or a new SEID assigned
by the new SMF in a PFCP Session Modification Request.
7) The UPF shall not trigger the restoration procedures specified in 3GPP TS
23.527 [40] for a PFCP session that can be controlled by different SMFs of an
SMF set when a heartbeat failure is detected for the IP address of the
assigned CP F-SEID. Restoration procedures shall be triggered only if
heartbeat procedures fail with all the IP addresses of all the SMFs in the SMF
set.
NOTE 3: The above requirements enable all SMFs of a same SMF set to
successively control a given PFCP session without causing extra signalling
over the N4 interface.
8) A UPF supporting the SSET feature shall support UE IP address/prefix
allocation in the UP function (see clause 5.21).
### 5.22.3 With one PFCP association per SMF and UPF
If multiple PFCP associations are setup between an UPF and the SMFs in an SMF
set, the following applies:
1) Each SMF in the SMF set shall establish its own PFCP association with the
UPF and shall provide the Node ID IE set to an FQDN or IP address of the SMF
and the SMF Set ID IE set to an FQDN representing the SMF set. All SMFs of an
SMF set shall indicate the same SMF Set ID. Alternatively, if PFCP Association
Setup is initiated by UPF as defined in clause 6.2.6.3, each SMF in the SMF
set shall provide this information in PFCP Association Setup Response
message.\ \ The SMF shall indicate that it supports the MPAS feature (Multiple
PFCP Associations to the SMFs in an SMF set) in the CP Function Features IE
(see clause 8.2.58); this indicates to the UPF that the PFCP sessions
established with this PFCP association can be successively controlled by
different SMFs of the same SMF set according to the procedure defined in this
clause.\ \ The SMF may also provide a list of alternative IP addresses of PFCP
entities pertaining to the same SMF in the PFCP Association Setup Request
message.
The UPF and SMF shall identify the PFCP association by the Node ID of the SMF
and UPF respectively.
Likewise, when an SMF is added or removed from the SMF set, this SMF shall
establish or tear down its PFCP association with the UPF. Alternatively, when
an SMF updates its SMF SET ID using the PFCP Association Update procedure, the
UPF shall maintain the existing PFCP sessions served by this SMF and use the
new SMF Set ID of the SMF if the UPF needs to later reselect a different SMF
instance for these PFCP sessions (as defined in step 6).
2) When establishing a PFCP session, the SEID that the SMF assigns in the CP
F-SEID of the PFCP Session Establishment Request may be unique or not within
the SMF set. However the assigned CP F-SEID shall be unique within the SMF
set.
NOTE 1: The UPF does not (need to) know whether the SEID in the CP F-SEID is
uniquely assigned in the SMF set or not. The SMF and the UPF identifies the
PFCP session by its own CP F-SEID and UP F-SEID respectively.
3) Any SMF in the SMF set may issue requests to modify or delete the PFCP
session. When the SMF controlling a PFCP session changes, the SMF that takes
over the control of the PFCP session shall provide its own Node ID and may
provide a new CP F-SEID.
The UPF shall allow the PFCP session modification or deletion request to come
from any other PFCP association from the same SMF set.
4) At any time, an SMF may update a PFCP session by including the CP F-SEID
with the IPv4 or IPv6 address of a new SMF and/or a new SEID assigned by the
new SMF in a PFCP Session Modification Request.
5) An SMF may redirect a UPF initiated PFCP session related request to another
PFCP entity pertaining to the same SMF or to a different SMF in the SMF set by
rejecting the request with the cause \"Redirection Requested\" and with the IP
address of the new entity to contact. When sending the redirected request to
another PFCP entity pertaining to the same SMF or to the new SMF, the UPF
shall set a null SEID in the header of the PFCP request and include the CP
F-SEID assigned by the previous SMF in the request.
Alternatively, an SMF may forward the UPF request to another PFCP entity
pertaining to the same SMF or another SMF in the SMF set; the new PFCP entity
or the new SMF answers to the UPF, including the CP F-SEID IE with the IPv4 or
IPv6 address of the new entity respectively and the same or a modified SEID,
and optionally including the N4-u F-TEID that the UPF shall use for sending
data towards the new entity.
NOTE 2: This allows to address cases where a different SMF would have been
reselected in the 5GC for the PFCP session, e.g. by an AMF.
6) The UPF shall initiate PFCP session related requests (e.g. PFCP Session
Report Request) towards another PFCP entity pertaining to the same SMF or to
another SMF in the SMF set with which the UPF has established associations
with the same SMF Set ID, if the IP address included in the CP F-SEID assigned
to the PFCP session is not responsive, heartbeat failure towards IP address of
the CP F-SEID assigned to the PFCP session, or if the UPF receives a GTP-U
Error Indication from the SMF over the N4-u tunnel assigned to the N4 session
for data forwarding.
When sending the request to the new entity, the UPF shall set the SEID field
to zero in the PFCP header of the PFCP request and include the CP F-SEID
assigned by the previous SMF in the request.
7) The UPF shall not trigger the restoration procedures specified in 3GPP TS
23.527 [40] for a PFCP session that can be controlled by different SMFs of an
SMF set when a heartbeat failure is detected. Restoration procedures shall be
triggered only if heartbeat procedures fail with all of the SMFs in the SMF
set (i.e. the SMFs with which the UPF has established associations with the
same SMF Set ID).
8) If an SMF or UPF fails, the peer PFCP node that detects that error shall
remove the PFCP association locally.
9) A UPF supporting the MPAS feature shall support UE IP address/prefix
allocation in the UP function (see clause 5.21).
## 5.23 5G VN Group Communication (for 5GC)
Stage 2 requirements for the support of 5G VN communication are specified in
clauses 4.4.6 and 5.8.2.13 of 3GPP TS 23.501[28].
The 5G VN group communication includes one to one communication and one to
many communication.
One to one communication supports forwarding of unicast traffic between two
UEs within a 5G VN, or between a UE and a device on the DN.
One to many communication supports forwarding of multicast traffic and
broadcast traffic from one UE (or device on the DN) to many/all UEs within a
5G VN and devices on the DN.
5G VN Group Communication is optional to support. The SMF may instruct the UPF
to forward unicast and/or broadcast traffic as described below if the UPF has
indicated support of 5G VN Group Communication (see feature GCOM in clause
8.2.25).
There are 3 different traffic forwarding methods, i.e. UPF local switching,
N6-based forwarding and N19-based forwarding, to forward traffic within the 5G
VN group.
For all methods, traffic forwarding within the 5G VN group is realized by
using a UPF internal interface (\"5G VN Internal\") and a two-step detection
and forwarding process. In the first step, the packets received from any 5G VN
group member (via it\'s PDU Session, via N6 or via N19) are forwarded to the
UPF internal interface (i.e. Destination Interface set to \"5G VN Internal\").
In the second step, PDRs installed at the UPF internal interface (i.e. Source
Interface set to \"5G VN Internal\") detect the packet and forward it to the
respective 5G VN group member (via it\'s PDU Session, via N6 or via N19). If
more than one 5G VN group has to be supported, the Network Instance set to a
value representing the 5G VN group is used in addition to the UPF internal
interface to enable isolation of the 5G VN group communication during the
packet detection and forwarding process.
When N19-based forwarding is used, the SMF may correlate all the PDU sessions
for the 5G VN Group members to generate the PDR and FAR corresponding to the
group level N4-session for UPF as specified in clause 5.29.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501
[28].
For Ethernet unicast traffic on 5G VN Group Communication, the SMF may either
explicitly configure DL PDR with the MAC addresses detected by the UPF on PDU
Sessions supporting a 5G VN group, or rely on MAC address learning in UPF
related with a 5G VN group by setting the Ethernet PDU Session Information
indication in the DL PDR of the \"5G VN internal\" interface as specified in
clause 5.8.2.13.0 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
To enable IP or Ethernet type broadcast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN Group,
the SMF may provide the PDRs related to the group level N4-session and each 5G
VN group member\' N4 Session to the UPF as specified in clause 5.8.2.13.3 of
3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
The details of the PDR and FAR setting over N4 for unicast traffic forwarding
within a 5G VN are specified in clauses 5.8.2.13.1 and 5.8.2.13.2 of 3GPP TS
23.501[28].
The details of the PDR and FAR setting over N4 for broadcast traffic
forwarding within a 5G VN are specified in clause 5.8.2.13.3 of 3GPP TS
23.501[28].
## 5.24 Support of Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication for 5GC
### 5.24.1 General
Stage 2 requirements for the support of Ultra Reliable Low Latency
Communication (URLLC) are specified in clause 5.33 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
NOTE 1: In this release of specification redundant transmission on N3/N9
interfaces for URLLC is not supported for PDU Sessions involving an I-SMF. See
3GPP TS 23.501 [28] clauses 5.34, 5.33.2.2 and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29] clause
4.24.
Redundant transmission is applied for supporting the highly reliable URLLC
services, there are three different methods: dual connectivity based end to
end redundant user plane paths, redundant transmission on N3/N9 interfaces or
redundant transmission at transport layer.
NOTE 2: Dual connectivity based end to end redundant user plane paths has no
impact to N4 interface.
QoS Monitoring is applied for packet delay measurement. The packet delay
between UE and PSA UPF is a combination of the uplink or downlink packet delay
on Uu interface and uplink or downlink packet delay between NG-RAN and PSA
UPF. The QoS Monitoring on uplink or downlink packet delay between NG-RAN and
PSA UPF can be performed on different levels of granularities, i.e. per QoS
Flow per UE level, or per GTP-U path level.
Support of the URLLC feature is an optional for the SMF and UPF, for 5GC.
### 5.24.2 Redundant Transmission on N3/N9 interfaces
#### 5.24.2.1 General
Stage 2 requirements for support of Redundant Transmission on N3/N9 interfaces
for high reliability communication are specified in clause 5.33.2.2 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [28].
This requires duplicating downlink and uplink packets of QoS flows requiring
redundant transmission of a PDU session via two independent N3 or N9 tunnels
between the RAN and the UPF (PSA).
The following requirements shall apply for QoS flows requiring redundant
transmission. Requirements in clause 5.2.2.3.3 shall also apply for traffic
usage reporting.
#### 5.24.2.2 GTP-U tunnel setup for redundant transmission
The SMF shall request the UPF (PSA) to establish two N3 or N9 tunnels for a
PDU session with one or more Service Data Flows associated with QoS flow(s)
requiring redundant transmission as follows:
\- when provisioning an UL PDR in the UPF (PSA), the SMF shall request the UPF
to assign two Local F-TEIDs for the PDR, by provisioning the PDI or the
Traffic Endpoint with the Redundant Transmission Detection Parameters IE. The
SMF may provide two different Network Instances for these two F-TEIDs to
achieve disjoint transport layer paths;
\- alternatively, the SMF may request the UPF to assign one Local F-TEID for
the related Network Instance when creating the UL PDR, and later request the
UPF to assign another Local F-TEID with the same or a different Network
Instance when updating the PDR, if the redundant transmission tunnels are not
established during the PDU session establishment;
\- when provisioning DL FAR in the UPF (PSA) corresponding to QoS flows
requiring redundant transmission, the SMF shall request the UPF to duplicate
the downlink packets for redundant transmission and the SMF shall provide two
F-TEIDs of remote GTP-U tunnel endpoints in the FAR, as described in clause
5.24.2.3;
\- alternatively, the SMF may provide one remote endpoint F-TEID when creating
the FAR and later provide another remote endpoint F-TEID when updating the
FAR, if the redundant transmission tunnels are not established during the PDU
session establishment.
NOTE: To forward downlink packets pertaining to service data flows not
requiring redundant transmission, the SMF can create a separate FAR not
requiring to duplicate the packets.
The PSA UPF shall assign the local F-TEID(s) for establishing the redundant
tunnel and include the Local F-TEID(s) for Redundant Transmission IE in the
PFCP Session Establishment Response or the PFCP Session Modification Response
to the SMF if the Redundant Transmission Detection Parameters IE was received
in the corresponding request message.
The SMF shall request the UPF (PSA) to remove one N3 or N9 tunnel used for
redundant transmission if redundant transmission is no longer needed as
follows:
\- request the UPF to remove the local F-TEID for redundant transmission by
updating the PDI or the Traffic Endpoint in UL PDR with a null length
Redundant Transmission Detection Parameters IE;
\- request the UPF to remove the F-TEID of remote GTP-U tunnel endpoint for
redundant transmission by updating the FAR in DL PDR with a null length
Redundant Transmission Forwarding Parameters IE;
\- set the DFRT and EDRT flags to 0 in the FAR associated to the corresponding
UL and DL PDRs, to stop duplicating packets and eliminating duplicate packets.
When so instructed, the PSA UPF shall remove the local F-TEID for redundant
transmission and the F-TEID of remote GTP-U tunnel endpoint for redundant
transmission, stop duplicating packets and stop detecting/eliminating
duplicate packets accordingly.
#### 5.24.2.3 Duplicating downlink packets for redundant transmission
If redundant transmission is required for a QoS flow, the SMF shall instruct
the PSA UPF to replicate each downlink packet of the QoS Flow and to assign a
sequence number to them by provisioning a FAR with the following information
in a PFCP Session Establishment Request or PFCP Session Modification Request:
\- the Redundant Transmission Forwarding Parameters IE including an Outer
Header Creation IE set to the remote F-TEID of the redundant GTP-U tunnel, and
if the GTP-U tunnel for redundant transmission uses a different network
instance than the primary GTP-U tunnel, the Network Instance to be used for
redundant transmission;
\- the Apply Action IE with both the FORW and the DFRT flags set to \"1\".
When so instructed, the PSA UPF shall replicate downlink packets associated to
such a FAR and construct the duplicated downlink packets using the information
included in the Redundant Transmission Forwarding Parameters IE and other
information included in the Forwarding Parameters IE for information that is
not part of the Redundant Transmission Forwarding Parameters IE. The PSA UPF
shall add the same sequence number in the PDU Session Container extension
header of the downlink packet and the related duplicated downlink packets as
specified in 3GPP TS 38.415 [34].
#### 5.24.2.4 Eliminating duplicated uplink packets
For QoS flows for which redundant transmission is required, the SMF shall also
instruct the PSA UPF to eliminate the duplicated uplink packets of the QoS
Flow, based on their sequence numbers in the PDU Session Container extension
header by setting the EDRT flag and the FORW flag in the Apply Action IE in
the FAR IE to request the UPF to eliminate the duplicated uplink packets based
on the sequence number, i.e. to forward the uplink packets and to drop
duplicated uplink packets. When so instructed, the PSA UPF shall forward the
only one copy of the uplink packets and drop duplicate uplink packets.
### 5.24.3 Redundant Transmission at transport layer
Stage 2 requirements for support of Redundant Transmission at transport layer
for high reliability communication are specified in clause 5.33.2.3 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [28].
If it supports the redundant transmission at transport layer, the UP function
shall set the RTTL feature flag in the UP Function Features IE (see clause
8.2.25). If so, during the UE requested PDU session establishment procedure,
the CP function may select the UPF that supports redundant transmission at
transport layer for the PDU session.
NOTE: How the UPF perform the redundant transmission at transport layer is
left up to UPF implementation.
### 5.24.4 Per QoS Flow Per UE QoS Monitoring
#### 5.24.4.1 General
Stage 2 requirements for support of per QoS flow per UE QoS monitoring are
specified in clause 5.33.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
The UPF shall set the QFQM feature flag in the UP Function Features IE if it
supports per QoS flow per UE QoS monitoring (see clause 8.2.25). If so, the
SMF may request the UPF to perform the per QoS flow per UE QoS monitoring
during a PFCP session establishment or a PFCP session modification procedure.
The SMF shall provision one or more QoS Monitoring per QoS flow control
Information IEs to instruct the UPF to monitor the packet delay(s) of QoS
flows as specified in 5.24.4.2. The SMF may request the UPF to stop the on-
going QoS monitoring as specified in clause 5.24.4.2, when needed.
The UPF shall report the QoS monitoring result of the QoS flows to the SMF by
sending QoS Monitoring Report IEs to the SMF as specified in 5.24.4.3.
#### 5.24.4.2 QoS Monitoring Control
If the per QoS Flow per UE QoS monitoring is required, the SMF may provision
the following IEs included in the QoS Monitoring per QoS flow Control
Information IE:
\- one or more QFI IEs indicating the QoS flow(s) required for the QoS
monitoring;
\- a Requested QoS Monitoring IE indicating a request to monitor the downlink
packet delay, uplink packet delay, and/or the round-trip packet delay between
the UPF (PSA) and UE;
\- a Reporting Frequency IE indicating the frequency for the reporting, i.e.
Event Triggered or Periodic QoS monitoring reporting;
\- a Packet Delay Thresholds IE indicating thresholds for the downlink packet
delay, uplink packet delay, and/or the round-trip packet delay to generate the
QoS monitoring reports to the CP function, if the Event Triggered QoS
monitoring reporting is required in the reporting frequency;
\- a Minimum Wait Time IE, to indicate the minimum waiting time between two
consecutive reports, if the Event Triggered QoS monitoring reporting is
required in the reporting frequency; and/or
\- a Measurement Period IE, indicating the period to generate periodic usage
reports to the SMF (if the periodic QoS monitoring reporting is required in
the reporting frequency) and the period used to detect and report a QoS
monitoring measurement failure (if Periodic QoS monitoring reporting or Event
Triggered QoS monitoring reporting is required in the reporting frequency).
The SMF may require the UPF to stop the on-going QoS monitoring, by sending a
PFCP Modification Request with the Remove SRR IE, or by sending a PFCP
Modification Request with the Update SRR IE within which the previous QoS
Monitoring per QoS flow Control IE is removed. Upon receiving such a PFCP
Modification Request message, the UPF shall stop the on-going QoS monitoring.
#### 5.24.4.3 QoS Monitoring Reporting
If the UPFis requested to perform QoS Monitoring (i.e. it receives one or more
QoS Monitoring per QoS flow Control Information IEs from the SMF), the UPF
shall select one or more downlink packets pertaining to every requested QoS
flow(s), and insert the time stamp into the GTP-U PDU Session Container
extension header (see 3GPP TS 38.415 [34]) of these downlink packets.
When receiving the uplink packet related to the requested QoS flow(s), the UPF
shall measure the packet delay(s) based on the time stamp(s) and packet
delay(s) included in the GTP-U PDU Session Container extension header (see
3GPP TS 38.415 [34]) of the uplink packet, and generate a QoS monitoring
report towards the SMF, if the packet delay(s) exceeds the defined Packet
Delay Thresholds and Event Triggered QoS monitoring reporting is required in
the reporting frequency. The UPF may send a next report only after the minimum
waiting time indicated by the SMF.
If the Periodic QoS monitoring reporting is required in the reporting
frequency, the UPF shall generate QoS monitoring report based on the
Measurement Period.
The UPF shall send QoS Monitoring Report IE to the SMF in PFCP Session Report
Request; several QoS Monitoring Report IEs may be present to report the packet
delay(s) for multiple QoS flows.
The UPF shall include the delay value (Downlink, Uplink and/or Round trip) in
the QoS Monitoring Measurement IE in the QoS Monitoring Report IE.
The UPF shall continue to apply all the provisioned SRR(s) and perform the
related QoS monitoring measurement(s), until getting any further instruction
from the CP function.
When receiving a new threshold (Packet Delay Thresholds, Minimum Wait Time
and/or Measurement Period) from the SMF for a measurement that is already
ongoing in the UPF, the UPF shall consider its ongoing measurements against
the new threshold to determine when to send its next QoS monitoring report to
the SMF.
When receiving instruction from the SMF to stop the on-going QoS monitoring,
the UPF shall generate a QoS monitoring report to the SMF, to report the
detected packet delay(s).
If Periodic QoS monitoring reporting or Event Triggered QoS monitoring
reporting is required in the reporting frequency and no time stamp is received
in uplink packet for a delay exceeding the Measurement Period (i.e. no
measurement result is available in the UPF within the reporting period), the
UPF shall generate a QoS monitoring report indicating a packet delay
measurement failure to the SMF.
### 5.24.5 Per GTP-U Path QoS Monitoring
#### 5.24.5.1 General
Stage 2 requirements for support of per GTP-U path QoS monitoring are
specified in clause 5.33.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
The UPF shall set the GPQM feature flag in the UP Function Features IE if it
supports per GTP-U Path QoS monitoring (see clause 8.2.25).
#### 5.24.5.2 GTP-U path monitoring
If the UPF is known to support this feature (e.g. by the UP Function Features
IE), the SMF may request the UPF to measure the packet delay for transport
paths towards remote GTP-U peers during a PFCP association setup or a PFCP
association update procedure, by provisioning GTP-U Path QoS Control
Information including:
\- the identification of the GTP-U paths to be monitored, i.e.:
\- the IP destination address of one or more remote GTP-U peers, and if
available, the network instance used to reach each remote GTP-U peer and the
DSCP value(s) to measure the packet delay; or
\- the interface type(s) (i.e. N9 and/or N3) of the GTP-U paths;
\- the values of the DSCP in the TOS/Traffic Class field to measure the packet
delay, if available;
\- the conditions and QoS parameters for the UPF to report measurements to the
SMF, i.e one or more of:
\- immediate report;
\- periodic report, with the reporting time period; and/or
\- event triggered report, when the average, minimum and/or maximum packet
delay on a GTP-U path exceeds corresponding thresholds.
If so instructed, the UPF shall perform an estimation of the RTT for the GTP-U
paths requested to be monitored, by sending Echo Request messages (with each
requested DSCP value, if any) and measuring the time that elapses between the
transmission of the Echo Request message and the reception of the Echo
Response message. The UPF shall compute the packet delay by adding RTT/2 and
the UPF internal processing time, thus the measured delay represents an
estimated elapsed time for the GTP-U path (since a user plane packet entered
the UPF and its reception by the next downstreams or upstreams GTP-U peer).
The UPF shall send QoS reports to the SMF by including GTP-U Path QoS Report
IE(s) in a PFCP Node Report Request message.
If the GTP-U paths to be monitored are identified by their interface types
(e.g. N9 and/or N3), the UPF shall monitor all GTP-U paths of all PFCP
sessions established with a FAR including a matching Destination Interface
Type.
For event triggered reporting, the UPF shall send a first report when a
reporting threshold is exceeded and a minimum waiting time shall be applied
for the subsequent report for the same type of measurement (e.g. maximum
packet delay) and the same remote GTP-U peer (if the threshold is exceeded
after the waiting time).
#### 5.24.5.3 QoS monitoring of a PDU session based on GTP-U path monitoring
The SMF may request the UPF (PSA) to monitor the Uplink, Downlink or Round-
Trip delay per QoS flow per UE, as specified in clause 5.24.4.2 with the
following addition:
\- In the QoS Monitoring per QoS flow Control Information IE, the SMF shall
indicate that QoS monitoring is performed based on GTP-U path monitoring by
setting the GTPUM flag to 1 in the Requested Qos Monitoring IE.
Additionally, for the UPF (PSA) and for any intermediate UPF in the path of
the PDU session, the SMF (or I-SMF) shall request the UPF:
\- to measure the one-way delay of the GTP-U path with the preceding uplink
GTP-U entity; this corresponds to the N3 path for a UPF connected to the RAN,
and to a N9 path for a UPF connected to an intermediate UPF;
\- to add this delay to the \"N3/N9 Delay Result\" field received in the GTP-U
PDU Session Container extension header (see 3GPP TS 38.415 [34]) of the uplink
packet; and
\- for an intermediate UPF, to send the resulting value in the \"N3/N9 Delay
Result\" field in the GTP-U PDU Session Container extension header (see 3GPP
TS 38.415 [34]) of the uplink packet it forwards (towards the PSA).
The SMF shall request the above to the UPF (PSA or I-UPF) by including the
Transport Delay Reporting IE in the UL PDR(s) associated to the corresponding
QoS flow to be monitored. Multiple QoS flows may be monitored for a given PDU
session as specified in clause 5.24.5.4.
When so requested, each UPF shall, for UL GTP-U packets with the PDU Session
Container extension header including the RAN Uplink and/or Downlink fields,
add the delay of the GTP-U path with the preceding uplink GTP-U entity.
NOTE: The \"N3/N9 Delay Result\" field is computed by the intermediate UPF(s)
and UPF (PSA). The RAN does not report the N3 path delay. The intermediate UPF
connected to the RAN adds the N3 delay; the next intermediate UPF (if any)
adds the N9 delay with the first intermediate UPF and the PSA adds the N9
delay of the last GTP-U path towards the PSA. If the PSA is directly connected
to the RAN, the PSA measures the N3 delay.
The SMF may request the UPF to stop the on-going QoS monitoring (based on
GTP-U path monitoring) for a PDU session, by sending a PFCP Modification
Request with the Remove SRR IE, or by sending a PFCP Modification Request with
the Update SRR IE within which the previous QoS Monitoring per QoS flow
Control IE is removed. Upon receiving such a PFCP Modification Request
message, the UPF shall stop the on-going QoS monitoring.
#### 5.24.5.4 QoS Monitoring Reporting
QoS monitoring reporting by the PSA shall be performed as specified in clause
5.24.4.3, with the following modifications.
The UP function shall not insert time stamps into the GTP-U PDU Session
Container extension header (see 3GPP TS 38.415 [34]) of downlink packets.
When receiving the uplink packet related to the requested QoS flow(s), the PSA
shall measure the Uplink or Downlink delay by computing the sum of the end to
end accumulated transport delay (computed as defined in clause 5.24.5.3) and
the RAN UL or DL delay included in the GTP-U PDU Session Container extension
header (see 3GPP TS 38.415 [34]) of the uplink packet.
## 5.25 Support of IPTV (for 5GC)
IPTV service is defined in clause 4.9.1 of of 3GPP TS 23.316 [51]. Stage 2
procedures to support IPTV service are defined in clauses 4.6 and 7.7.1 of
3GPP TS 23.316 [51].
Support of IPTV service is optional for the SMF and UPF. The following
requirements shall apply for IPTV service if the UPF supports the IPTV feature
(see clause 8.2.25).
This requires the UPF (PSA) to support:
\- terminating and managing IGMP or MLD messages received from the UE;
\- acting as a Multicast Router as defined in in IETF RFC 2236 [52] and IETF
RFC 3376 [53];
\- replicating IP multicast traffic received from the N6 interface over PDU
sessions having joined the corresponding IP multicast group;
\- notifying the SMF when a PDU session has joined or left a multicast group,
if so requested by the SMF.
NOTE: In this specification, \"IGMP\" refers to IGMPv2 and IGMPv3 and \"MLD\"
refers to MLDv1 and MLDv2, unless specified otherwise.
For a PDU session used for IPTV service, the SMF shall provision the following
rules in the UPF to control the UL IGMP/MLD traffic and the DL IP multicast
traffic as follows:
\- for the control of UL IGMP or MLD traffic:
\- a PDR that shall identify IGMPv2 (see IETF RFC 2236 [52]), IGMPv3 (see IETF
RFC 4604 [54]), MLD (see IETF RFC 2710 [55]) and/or MLD2 (see IETF RFC 4604
[54]) signalling, i.e.:
\- with a PDI containing an SDF filter with a Flow Description identifying
packets with IP Protocol number of 2, or with a pre-defined PDR matching the
same, for IGMP traffic;
\- with a pre-defined PDR matching traffic with IPv6 Next Header type value 58
and ICMP Field Type value 131 or 143, for MLD traffic.
\- this PDR may also contain IP Multicast Addressing Info IE(s) identifying
(ranges of) IP multicast group(s); if no IP Multicast Addressing Info IE is
included, the PDR is meant to match any IP multicast group.
\- an associated FAR containing the Apply Action IE with the IPMA (IP
Multicast Accept) or the IPMD (IP Multicast Deny) flag set in order to request
the UPF to accept or deny the UE requests to join the corresponding IP
multicast group(s);
\- for the control of DL IP multicast traffic
\- a PDR including IP Multicast Addressing Info IE(s), identifying (ranges of)
IP multicast addresses (DL IP multicast flows) or indicating any IP multicast
address by the A (Any) flag set to \"1\";
\- an associated FAR containing the Apply Action IE set to forward or buffer
the packets, and in the former case with the Outer Header Creation IE set to
add the remote N3 or N9 GTP-U tunnel IP address and TEID related with the PDU
session;
\- optionally an associated QER indicating the QoS to use for the PDU session
for the IP Multicast traffic that has been replicated.
The UPF shall add or remove the PDU session to/from the DL replication tree
associated with an IP Multicast flow, when the UE request to join the IP
Multicast flow is accepted or when the UE requests to leave the IP Multicast
flow. When receiving downlink IP multicast traffic, the UPF shall replicate
the traffic towards each PDU session that has joined the corresponding IP
multicast group and that is provisioned with a DL PDR enabling the forwarding
of the corresponding IP multicast traffic.
Additionally, the SMF may provision a URR, associated with the UL PDR
controlling the IGMP or MLD traffic, with a Reporting trigger set to \"IP
multicast join/leave\" to request the UPF to report to the SMF when it adds or
remove the PDU session to/from the DL replication tree associated with an IP
Multicast flow. Corresponding reports shall contain the Multicast IP address
of the DL multicast flow and, if available, the Source specific IP address(es)
of the DL IP multicast flow.
## 5.26 Support of Time Sensitive Communications (for 5GC)
### 5.26.1 General
The 5GS may support Time Sensitive Communication (TSC) sessions, as specified
in clauses 4.4.8, 5.27 and 5.28 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]. The related procedures
between SMF and UPF are defined in this clause.
NOTE: How TSC is supported for PDU Sessions involving an I-SMF is not
specified in this release of specification. See 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] clause
5.34 and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29] clause 4.24.
Support of TSC is optional for the SMF and UPF. The procedures specified in
this clause may apply if the UPF indicated support of the TSC feature (see
clause 8.2.25).
### 5.26.2 5GS Bridge management
5GS Bridge information reporting is defined in Annex F.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502
[29]; this procedure enables the SMF to report 5GS Bridge information of a PDU
session established for Time Sensitive Communication (TSC) to the TSN AF via
the PCF.
Identities of 5GS Bridge and UPF/NW-TT ports may be pre-configured in the UPF
based on deployment.
In order to establish an Ethernet PDU Session for TSC, the SMF shall send a
PFCP Session Establishment Request to the UPF to establish the corresponding
PFCP session as specified in clause 5.13. Additionally, the SMF shall request
the UPF to allocate the port number for DS-TT and provide the related TSN
Bridge ID by including the Create Bridge Info for TSC IE with the Bridge
Information Indication (BII) bit set to \"1\", in the PFCP Session
Establishment Request. If so requested, the UPF shall provide corresponding
information to the SMF in the Created Bridge Info for TSC IE in the PFCP
Session Establishment Response message.
NOTE: The port number for DS-TT and Bridge ID are not meant to be used in
PDRs.
### 5.26.3 Transfer of 5GS bridge and port management information
5GS TSN bridge and port information configuration is defined in clause 5.28.3
of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] and in Annex F of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29]; this procedure
enables the SMF to relay transparently TSN bridge and/or port related
information between the TSN AF and the NW-TT (and DS-TT).
Port management information shall be transferred between the SMF and UPF in a
Port Management Information Container (PMIC). If the NW-TT supports several
ports, and port management information needs to be sent for several ports, a
separate PMIC shall be used for each port.
Bridge management information shall be transferred between the SMF and UPF in
a Bridge Management Information Container (BMIC).
The SMF and UPF may send a PMIC or a BMIC using PFCP session related
procedures of any PFCP session associated with the 5GS TSN bridge.
The SMF may provide NW-TT related BMIC and/or PMIC(s) to the UPF by sending a
PFCP Session Modification Request to the UPF including the TSC Management
Information IE.
For a PDU session established for TSC, the UPF may send NW-TT related BMIC
and/or PMIC(s) to the SMF by sending a PFCP Session Modification Response or a
PFCP Session Report Request including the TSC Management Information IE.
The details of the 5GS Bridge and Port Management Container communication
between NW-TT and TSN AF is defined in the 3GPP TS 24.519 [63].
### 5.26.4 Reporting clock drift between TSN and 5GS times from UPF to SMF
The SMF may request the UPF to measure and report the clock drift between the
TSN time and 5GS time for one or more TSN time domains (see clause 5.27.2 of
3GPP TS 23.501 [28]), by provisioning one or more Clock Drift Control
Information IE(s) in a PFCP Association Setup Request or a PFCP Association
Update Request, with the following information:
\- TSN Time Domain Number IE(s), identifying the TSN working time domain(s),
e.g. PTP (Precision Time Protocol) \"domainNumber\", for which clock drift
needs to be measured and reported (see clause 5.27.1.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501
[28]). This may be present if the Configured Time Domain IE is omitted. The
SMF may omit the Time Domain Number IE in the request; if neither the Time
Domain Number IE nor the Configured Time Domain IE is included, the UPF shall
report the clock drift for all Time domains the UPF is connected to;
\- Configured Time Domain IE with the CTDI (Configured Time Domain Indicator)
flag set to \"1\", to indicate that clock drift needs to be measured and
reported for the Time Domain Number configured in the NW-TT(s). This may be
present if the Time Domain Number IE is omitted;
\- the requested Clock Drift Information, indicating a request to report when
the Time Offset Reporting Threshold is exceeded and/or when the cumulative
RateRatio Reporting Thresholds is exceeded;
\- the Time offset reporting threshold (i.e. the maximum time offset between
the TSN time and 5G system time), if Time Offset Reporting is requested;
\- the Cumulative rateRatio measurement threshold (i.e. related to cumulative
rateRatio calculated at NW-TT)), if Cumulative RateRatio Reporting is
requested.
If so requested, when detecting either of the clock drift offset triggers
exceeding the defined threshold, the UPF shall send a PFCP Node Report Request
to the SMF, including one or more Clock Drift Reports, with the corresponding
TSN Time Domain Number(s), measurement information and Network Instance (if
available) and the combination of DNN and S-NSSAI (if available).
## 5.27 Inter-PLMN User Plane Security
Stage 2 requirements for support of the Inter-PLMN User Plane Security (IPUPS)
functionality are defined in clauses 4.2.4, 5.8.2.14, 6.2.3, and 6.3.3.3 of
3GPP TS 23.501[28], and in clauses 4.2.2 and 5.9.3.4 of 3GPP TS 33.501[64].
The IPUPS functionality shall be activated for the user plane traffic received
over N9 interface across PLMNs, according to operator\'s policy. The SMF shall
provision UL/DL PDR(s) to identify the user plane traffic received at the
local F-TEID in the UPF and provision UL/DL FAR(s) to forward the user plane
traffic to the remote F-TEID in the GTP-U peer. User plane packets not
matching any PDR shall be dropped, using mechanisms defined in this
specification, see e.g. clause 5.2.1.
During a PFCP Association Setup procedure, an UPF, which is configured to be
used for IPUPS shall indicate this with the UPF configured for IPUPS (UUPSI)
flag, as specified in clause 7.4.4.2.
NOTE: Any UPF can support the IPUPS functionality. In network deployments
where specific UPFs are used to provide IPUPS, UPFs configured for providing
IPUPS services (i.e. reporting the UUPSI flag) are selected to provide IPUPS
function.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS whether an explicit indication that the UPF needs to
apply IPUPS is required over N4, e.g. to enable the support of operator
specific security policies.
## 5.28 Downlink data delivery status with UPF buffering (for 5GC)
### 5.28.1 General
Stage 2 requirements for the support of Downlink data delivery status
notification with UPF buffering are specified in clause 5.8.3.2 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [28] and clauses 4.15.3.2.8 and 4.15.3.2.9 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].
If the UP function supports the Downlink data delivery status notification
with UPF buffering, the UP function shall set the DDDS feature flag in the UP
Function Features IE (see clause 8.2.25). If so, the CP function may request
the UP function to notify the first buffered DL packet and / or the first
discarded DL packet for the traffic matching the downlink PDR by set the BUFF
flag, BDPN flag and DDPN flag in the Apply Action IE of the FAR. The CP
function may also provide the DL Buffering Duration IE and DL Buffering
Suggested Packet Count IE in the related BAR to the UP function.
The UP function shall report the first buffered DL packet for each service
data flow identified by a PDR, by sending a PFCP Session Report Request
including a Downlink Data Report IE identifying the PDR(s) for which downlink
packets have been received. The UP function shall also report the first
discarded DL packet for each service data flow identified by a PDR if the DL
Buffering Duration or DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count is exceeded. DL Data
Status IE shall be included in the Downlink Data Report IE to indicate the
report is triggered by the Downlink data delivery status with UPF buffering
when the first DL packet is buffered or discarded.
NOTE The CP function can request the UP function to report the first buffered
DL packet by setting the BDPN flag and / or the NOCP flag in the Apply Action
IE of the FAR. If the BDPN flag is set, the UP function reports the first
buffered DL packet for each service data flow identified by a PDR associated
to the FAR. If the NOCP flag is set, the UP function reports the first
buffered DL packet of any PDR associated to the FAR, i.e. if there are
subsequent DL packets (pertaining to different service data flow identified by
other PDRs associated to the FAR), there is no new report sent to the CP
function.
If the UP function supports the Downlink data delivery status notification
with UPF buffering, the CP function may also request the UP function to drop
the DL packets directly and send a notification for the traffic matching the
downlink PDR by set the DROP flag and DDPN flag in the Apply Action IE of the
FAR.
The UP function shall report the dropped DL packets for each service data flow
identified by a PDR, by sending a PFCP Session Report Request including a
Downlink Data Report IE identifying the PDR(s) for which downlink packets have
been received.
## 5.29 Support Reliable Data Service
Clause 5.31.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28], clause 4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29] and
clause 4.5.14.3 of 3GPP TS 23.682 [66], specify that The Reliable Data Service
(RDS) may be used between the UE and UP function when using a PDU Session of
PDU Type \'Unstructured\' in 5GS or using PDN Connection of PDN Type \'Non-
IP\' in EPS. The service is enabled or disabled based on DNN and NSSAI
Configuration per SLA in 5GS or APN Configuration per SLA in EPS.
If the UE indicates its capability of supporting RDS in the Protocol
Configuration Options (PCO) and if the UP function indicated support of the
RDS feature, the CP function may request the UP fuction to apply the RDS
functionality for the PDU session by sending \"Provide RDS Configuration
Information\" IE within PFCP Session Establishment Request message (see clause
7.5.2.11).
If the UP function supports and accepts RDS, it should respond to CP function
by setting RDS flag in \"RDS Configuration Information\" IE within PFCP
Session Establishment Response message (see clause 7.5.3.8), and the UP
function should place unstructed DL data from N6/SGi in the payload of RDS
protocol and then insert it as GTP-U payload, and vice versa for UL data.
Then the CP function should indicate to the UE, in the PCO, that the RDS shall
be used if enabled in the DNN and NSSAI configuration in 5GS or APN
configuration in EPS. The Reliable Data Service is enabled afterwards.
Reliable Data Service protocol is defined in 3GPP TS 24.250 [65].
# 6 Procedures
## 6.1 Introduction
The following clauses specify the procedures supported over the Sxa, Sxb and
Sxc reference points.
## 6.2 PFCP Node Related Procedures
### 6.2.1 General
The following clauses specify either node level or PFCP entity level
procedures over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points. The behaviour of
the CP function und UP function when sending and receiving a node related
message is described.
### 6.2.2 Heartbeat Procedure
#### 6.2.2.1 General
PFCP Heartbeat is a PFCP entity level procedure.
Two messages are specified for PFCP heartbeat procedure: Heartbeat Request and
Heartbeat Response. The use of these messages is further specified in clause
19A of 3GPP TS 23.007 [24] for EPC, and in clause 4 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [40] for
5GC.
#### 6.2.2.2 Heartbeat Request
An PFCP entity of a CP or UP function may send a Heartbeat Request to a PFCP
entity of a peer node to find out if the peer PFCP entity is alive. If
multiple PFCP entities pertain to the same CP or UP function, each PFCP entity
may send Heartbeat Request messages towards each PFCP entity pertaining to the
peer node with which a PFCP control association is established.
NOTE 1: If the UP function supports the MPAS feature and connected to an SMF
set, each PFCP entity of the UP function can send heartbeat Requests towards
each PFCP entity of every SMF with which a PFCP control association is
established.
NOTE 2: If the UP function supports the SSET feature and connected to an SMF
set, each PFCP entity of the UP function can send heartbeat Requests towards
each PFCP entity pertaining to the same SMF or the SMFs in the SMF set with
which a PFCP control association is established.
A CP function or UP function shall be prepared to receive a Heartbeat Request
at any time (even from unknown peers) and it shall reply with a Heartbeat
Response.
#### 6.2.2.3 Heartbeat Response
The message shall be sent as a response to a received Heartbeat Request.
### 6.2.3 Load Control Procedure
#### 6.2.3.1 General
Load Control is a node level procedure.
Load Control is an optional feature defined over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4
reference points.
Load control enables the UP function to send its load information to the CP
function to adaptively balance the PFCP session load across the UP functions
according to their effective load. The load information reflects the operating
status of the resources of the UP function.
Load control allows for better balancing of the PFCP session load, so as to
attempt to prevent overload in the first place (preventive action). Load
control does not trigger overload mitigation actions even if the UP function
reports a high load.
Load control and overload control may be supported and activated independently
in the network, based on operator\'s policy.
#### 6.2.3.2 Principles
The UP function may signal its Load Control Information to reflect the
operating status of its resources, at the node level, allowing the receiving
CP function to use this information to augment the UP function selection
procedures.
The Load Control Information is piggybacked in PFCP request or response
messages such that the exchange of Load Control Information does not trigger
extra signalling.
NOTE: The inclusion of Load Control Information in existing messages means
that the frequency of transmission of load control information increases as
the session load increases, allowing for faster feedback and thus better
regulation of the load.
The calculation of the Load Control Information is implementation dependent
and its calculation and transfer shall not add significant additional load to
the node itself and to its corresponding peer nodes.
#### 6.2.3.3 Load Control Information
##### 6.2.3.3.1 General Description
A PFCP message may contain one instance of the Load Control Information (LCI)
IE.
When providing load control information in a message for the first time or
subsequently, the UP function shall always include the full set of load
control information, i.e. all the node level instance of the Load Control
Information, even if only a subset of the load control information has
changed. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever the
load control information is changed (see clause 6.2.3.3.2.1).
Load Control Information shall be linked to the Node ID (i.e. FQDN or the IP
address used during the UP function selection) of the UP function providing
the Information.
The receiver shall overwrite any stored load control information of a peer
with the newly received load control information from the same peer node if
the new load control information is more recent than the old information as
indicated by the Load Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored
an instance of the load control information for a peer node, it overwrites
this instance with the new instance received in a message from the same peer
node.
The receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance
of the LCI IE in conjunction while using this information for UP function
selection.
The parameters are further defined in clause 6.2.3.3.2.
Load control information may be extended with new parameters in future
versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized
as:
\- Non-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is _not
critical_ for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly
comprehend the load control information instance, containing one or more of
these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-critical
optional parameter.
\- Critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is _critical_
for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the load control
information containing one or more of these parameters.
The sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within any
instance of the LCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver\'s
capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or
more critical optional parameter in an instance of the LCI IE towards a
receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those parameters.
The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by
configuration (this will have to be defined when introducing any such new
parameter in future).
##### 6.2.3.3.2 Parameters
###### 6.2.3.3.2.1 Load Control Sequence Number
The Load Control Sequence number contains a value that indicates the sequence
number associated with the LCI IE. This sequence number shall be used to
differentiate any two LCI IEs generated at two different instances by the same
UP function. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be supported (if load
control is supported) and shall always be present in the LCI IE.
The UP function generating this information shall increment the Load Control
Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the Load Control
Information IE. The Load Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented
otherwise. The UP function may use the time, represented in an unsigned
integer format, of the generation of the Load Control Information to populate
the Load Control Sequence Number.
This parameter shall be used by the receiver of the Load Control Information
IE to properly collate out-of-order load control information, e.g. due to PFCP
retransmissions. This parameter shall also be used by the receiver of the LCI
IE to determine whether the newly received load control information has
changed compared to load control information previously received from the same
node earlier.
NOTE: The PFCP sequence number cannot be used for collating out-of-order load
control information as e.g. load control information may be sent in both PFCP
requests and responses, using independent PFCP sequence numbering.
If the receiving entity has already received and stored load control
information from the peer UP function, the receiving CP function shall update
its load control information only if the Load Control Sequence Number received
in the new load control information is higher than the stored value of the
Load Control Sequence Number associated with the peer UP function. However due
to roll-over of the Load Control Sequence Number or restart of the node, the
Load Control Sequence Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the
peer UP function, hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and
process) a Load Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the
previous value.
###### 6.2.3.3.2.2 Load Metric
The Load Metric parameter shall indicate the current load level of the
originating node. The computation of the Load Metric is left to
implementation. The node may consider various aspects, such as the used
capacity of the UP function, the load in the node (e.g. memory/CPU usage in
relationship to the total memory/CPU available, etc.).
The Load Metric represents the current load level of the sending node as a
percentage within the range of 0 to100, where 0 means no or 0% load and 100
means maximum or 100% load reached (i.e. no further load is desirable).
The Load Metric shall be supported (if load control is supported). The Load
Metric shall always be included in the Load Control Information.
Considering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Load Control
Information (e.g. handling of the new information, tuning the node selection
algorithm to take the new information into account), the sender should refrain
from advertising every small variation (e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2),
in the Load Metric which does not result in useful improvement in node
selection logic at the receiver. During the typical operating condition of the
sender, a larger variation in the Load Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be
considered as reasonable enough for advertising the new Load Control
Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle the new
information) of the receiver.
NOTE: The range of the Load Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate the sender
to collect its own load information at every increment/decrement and hence to
advertise the change of Load Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various
implementation specific criteria, such as: the architecture, session and
signalling capacity, the current load and so on, the sender is free to define
its own logic and periodicity with which its own load information is
collected.
##### 6.2.3.3.3 Frequency of Inclusion
How often the sender includes the load control information is implementation
specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated load control information is
propagated to the target CP functions within an acceptable delay, such that
the purpose of the information (i.e. effective load balancing) is achieved.
The sender may include the LCI IE e.g. as follows:
\- the sender may include Load Control Information towards a peer only when
the new/changed value has not already been provided to that peer;
\- the sender may include the Load Control Information in each and every
message (extended with LCI IE) towards the peer;
\- the sender may include Load Control Information periodically, i.e. include
the information during a first period then cease to do so during a second
period.
The sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above
approaches. Besides, the sender may also decide to include the Load Control
Information only in a subset of the applicable PFCP messages.
The receiver shall be prepared to receive the load control information in any
of the PFCP messages extended with an LCI IE and upon such reception, shall be
able act upon the received load control information.
### 6.2.4 Overload Control Procedure
#### 6.2.4.1 General
Overload Control is a node level procedure.
Overload Control is an optional feature defined over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4
reference points.
Overload control enables a UP function becoming or being overloaded to
gracefully reduce its incoming signalling load by instructing its peer CP
functions to reduce sending traffic according to its available signalling
capacity to successfully process the traffic. A UP function is in overload
when it operates over its signalling capacity which results in diminished
performance (including impacts to handling of incoming and outgoing traffic).
Overload control aims at shedding the incoming traffic as close to the traffic
source as possible generally when an overload has occurred (reactive action),
so to avoid spreading the problem inside the network and to avoid using
resources of intermediate nodes in the network for signalling that would
anyhow be discarded by the overloaded node.
Load control and overload control may be supported and activated independently
in the network, based on operator\'s policy.
#### 6.2.4.2 Principles
When a UP function determines that the offered incoming signalling traffic is
growing (or is about to grow) beyond its nominal capacity, the UP function may
signal its overload, at node level granularity, to its peer CP functions by
including Overload Control Information in PFCP signalling which provides
guidance to the receiving CP functions to decide actions which lead to
signalling traffic mitigation towards the sender of the information. This
helps in preventing severe overload and hence potential breakdown of the UP
function.
The Overload Control Information is piggybacked in PFCP request or response
messages such that the exchange of Overload Control Information does not
trigger extra signalling.
NOTE: The inclusion of Overload Control Information in existing messages means
that the frequency of transmission of overload control information increases
as the signalling load increases, thus allowing for faster feedback and better
regulation.
The calculation of the Overload Control Information is implementation
dependent and its calculation and transfer shall not add significant
additional load to the node itself and to its corresponding peer nodes. The
calculation of Overload Control Information should not severely impact the
resource utilization of the UP function, especially considering the overload
situation.
The overload control feature should continue to allow for preferential
treatment of priority users (eMPS) and emergency services.
The overload mitigation actions based on the reception of the overload related
information received from the UP function will not be standardized.
#### 6.2.4.3 Overload Control Information
##### 6.2.4.3.1 General Description
A PFCP message may contain one instance of the Overload Control Information
(OCI) IE.
When providing overload control information in a message for the first time or
subsequently, the UP function shall always include the full set of overload
control information, i.e. all the node level instance of the Overload Control
Information, even if only a subset of the overload control information has
changed. The Overload Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever
the Overload control information is changed (see clause 6.2.4.3.2.1).
The receiver shall overwrite any stored overload control information of a peer
with the newly received overload control information from the same peer node
if the new overload control information is more recent than the old
information as indicated by the Overload Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the
receiver has stored an instance of the Overload control information for a peer
node, it overwrites this instance with the new instance received in a message
from the same peer node.
The receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance
of the OCI IE in conjunction while applying the overload mitigation action.
The parameters are further defined in clause 6.2.4.3.2.
Overload control information may be extended with new parameters in future
versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized
as:
\- Non-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is _not
critical_ for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly
comprehend the Overload control information instance, containing one or more
of these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-
critical optional parameter.
\- Critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is _critical_
for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the Overload control
information containing one or more of these parameters.
The sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within any
instance of the OCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver\'s
capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or
more critical optional parameter in an instance of the OCI IE towards a
receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those parameters.
The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by
configuration (this will have to be defined when introducing any such new
parameter in future).
The Overload Control Information shall be associated by default to the PFCP
entity corresponding to the peer node\'s IP address of the PFCP session, over
which the OCI IE is received, i.e. to the IP address received within the \"UP
F-SEID\" IE.
Alternatively, the UP function may send Overload Control Information which is
associated with the Node ID of the UP function (i.e. FQDN or the IP address
used during the UP function selection). In that case, the UP function shall
provide an explicit indication that the OCI IE included in the message belongs
to the Node ID.
##### 6.2.4.3.2 Parameters
###### 6.2.4.3.2.1 Overload Control Sequence Number
The PFCP protocol requires retransmitted messages to have the same contents as
the original message. Due to PFCP retransmissions, the overload control
information received by a CP function at a given time may be less recent than
the overload control information already received from the same UP function.
The Overload Control Sequence Number aids in sequencing the overload control
information received from an overloaded UP function. The Overload Control
Sequence Number contains a value that indicates the sequence number associated
with the Overload Control Information IE. This sequence number shall be used
to differentiate between two OCI IEs generated at two different instants, by
the same UP function.
The Overload Control Sequence Number parameter shall be supported (when
supporting the overload control feature) and shall always be present in the
Overload Control Information IE.
The UP function generating this information shall increment the Overload
Control Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the OCI IE. The
Overload Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented otherwise. The UP
function may use the time, represented in an unsigned integer format, of the
generation of the overload control information, to populate the Overload
Control Sequence Number.
This parameter shall be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to properly collate
out-of-order OCI IEs, e.g. due to PFCP retransmissions. This parameter shall
also be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to determine whether the newly
received overload control information has changed compared to the overload
control information previously received from the same UP function. If the
newly received overload control information has the same Overload Control
Sequence Number as the previously received overload control information from
the same UP function, then the receiver may simply discard the newly received
overload control information whilst continuing to apply the overload abatement
procedures, as per the previous value.
NOTE 1: The timer corresponding to the Period of Validity (see clause
6.2.4.3.2.2) is not restarted if the newly received overload control
information has the same Overload Control Sequence Number as the previously
received overload control information. If the overload condition persists and
the overloaded UP function needs to extend the duration during which the
overload information applies, the sender needs to provide a new overload
control information with an incremented Overload Control Sequence Number (even
if the parameters within the overload control information have not changed).
NOTE 2: The PFCP Sequence Number cannot be used for collating out-of-order
overload information as e.g. overload control information may be sent in both
PFCP requests and responses, using independent PFCP sequence numbering.
If the receiving CP function already received and stored overload control
information, which is still valid, from the overloaded UP function, the
receiving entity shall update its overload control information, only if the
Overload-Sequence-Number received in the new overload control information is
larger than the value of the Overload Control Sequence Number associated with
the stored information. However due to roll-over of the Overload Control
Sequence Number or restart of the UP function, the Overload Control Sequence
Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the peer UP function,
hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and process) an
Overload Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the
previous value.
###### 6.2.4.3.2.2 Period of Validity
The Period of Validity indicates the length of time during which the overload
condition specified by the OCI IE is to be considered as valid (unless
overridden by subsequent new overload control information).
An overload condition shall be considered as valid from the time the OCI IE is
received until the period of validity expires or until another OCI IE with a
new set of information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number)
is received from the same UP function (at which point the newly received
overload control information shall prevail). The timer corresponding to the
period of validity shall be restarted each time an OCI IE with a new set of
information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number) is
received. When this timer expires, the last received overload control
information shall be considered outdated and obsolete, i.e. any associated
overload condition shall be considered to have ceased.
The Period of Validity parameter shall be supported (when supporting overload
control).
The Period of Validity parameter achieves the following:
\- it avoids the need for the overloaded UP function to include the Overload
Control Information IE in every PFCP messages it signals to its peer CP
functions when the overload state does not change; thus it minimizes the
processing required at the overloaded UP function and its peer CP functions
upon sending/receiving PFCP signalling;
\- it allows to reset the overload condition after some time in the peer CP
functions having received an overload indication from the overloaded UP
function, e.g. if no signalling traffic takes place between these PFCP
entities for some time due to overload mitigation actions. This also removes
the need for the overloaded UP function to remember the list of CP functions
to which it has sent a non-null overload reduction metric and to which it
would subsequently need to signal when the overload condition ceases, if the
Period of Validity parameter was not defined.
###### 6.2.4.3.2.3 Overload Reduction Metric
The Overload Reduction Metric shall have a value in the range of 0 to 100
(inclusive) which indicates the percentage of traffic reduction the sender of
the overload control information requests the receiver to apply. An Overload
Reduction Metric of \"0\" always indicates that the UP function is not in
overload (that is, no overload abatement procedures need to be applied) for
the indicated scope.
Considering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Overload Control
Information, e.g. to perform overload control based on the updated Overload
Reduction Metric, the sender should refrain from advertising every small
variation, e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2, in the Overload Reduction
Metric which does not result in useful improvement for mitigating the overload
situation. During the typical operating condition of the sender, a larger
variation in the Overload Reduction Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be
considered as reasonable enough for advertising a new Overload Reduction
Metric Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle
the new information) of the receiver.
NOTE: The range of Overload Reduction Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate
the sender to collect its own overload information at every
increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Overload Reduction
Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various implementation specific
criteria, such as the architecture, session and signalling capacity, the
current load/overload situation and so on, the sender is free to define its
own logic and periodicity with which its own overload control information is
collected.
The computation of the exact value for this parameter is left as an
implementation choice at the sending UP function.
The Overload Reduction Metric shall be supported (when supporting overload
control) and shall always be present in the OCI IE.
The inclusion of the OCI IE signals an overload situation is occurring, unless
the Overload Reduction Metric is set to \"0\", which signals that the overload
condition has ceased. Conversely, the absence of the OCI IE in a message does
not mean that the overload has abated.
##### 6.2.4.3.3 Frequency of Inclusion
How often or when the sender includes the overload control information is
implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated overload
control information is propagated to the target receivers with an acceptable
delay, such that the purpose of the information, (i.e. the effective overload
control protection) is achieved. The following are some of the potential
approaches the sender may implement for including the OCI IE:
\- the sender may include OCI IE towards a receiver only when the new/changed
value has not already been provided to the given receiver;
\- the sender may include the OCI IE in a subset of the messages towards the
receiver;
\- the sender may include the OCI IE periodically, i.e. include the
information during a first period then cease to do so during a second period.
The sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above
approaches. Besides, the sender may also include the OCI IE only in a subset
of the applicable PFCP messages.
The receiver shall be prepared to receive the overload control information
received in any of the PFCP messages extended with an OCI IE and upon such
reception, shall be able act upon the received information.
#### 6.2.4.4 Message Throttling
##### 6.2.4.4.1 General
As part of the overload mitigation, a CP function shall reduce the total
number of messages, which would have been sent otherwise, towards the
overloaded peer based on the information received within the Overload Control
Information. This shall be achieved by discarding a fraction of the messages
in proportion to the overload level of the target peer. This is called
\"message throttling\".
Message throttling shall only apply to Request messages. Response messages
should not be throttled since that would result in the retransmission of the
corresponding request message by the sender.
A CP function supporting PFCP overload control shall support and use the
\"Loss\" algorithm as specified in this clause, for message throttling.
##### 6.2.4.4.2 Throttling algorithm -- \"Loss\"
###### 6.2.4.4.2.1 Description
An overloaded UP function shall ask its peers to reduce the number of requests
they would ordinarily send by signalling Overload Control Information
including the requested traffic reduction, as a percentage, within the
\"Overload-Reduction-Metric\", as specified in clause 6.2.4.3.2.
The recipients of the \"Overload-Reduction-Metric\" shall reduce the number of
requests sent by that percentage, either by redirecting them to an alternate
destination if possible (e.g. the PFCP Session Establishment Request message
may be redirected to an alternate UP function), or by failing the request and
treating it as if it was rejected by the destination UP function.
For example, if a sender requests another peer to reduce the traffic it is
sending by 10%, then that peer shall throttle 10% of the traffic that would
have otherwise been sent to this UP function.
The overloaded UP function should periodically adjust the requested traffic
reduction based e.g. on the traffic reduction factor that is currently in use,
the current system utilization (i.e. the overload level) and the desired
system utilization (i.e. the target load level), and/or the rate of the
current overall received traffic.
Annex A.1 provides an (informative) example of a possible implementation of
the \"Loss\" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.
NOTE 1: This algorithm does not guarantee that the future traffic towards the
overloaded UP function will be less than the past traffic but it ensures that
the total traffic sent towards the overloaded UP function is less than what
would have been sent without any throttling in place. If after requesting a
certain reduction in traffic, the overloaded UP function receives more traffic
than in the past, whilst still in overload, leading to the worsening rather
than an improvement in the overload level, then the overloaded UP function can
request for more reduction in traffic. Thus, by periodically adjusting the
requested traffic reduction, the overloaded node can ensure that it receives,
approximately, the amount of traffic which it can handle.
NOTE 2: Since the reduction is requested as a percentage, and not as an
absolute amount, this algorithm achieves a good useful throughput towards the
overloaded node when the traffic conditions vary at the source nodes
(depending upon the events generated towards these source nodes by other
entities in the network), as a potential increase of traffic from some source
nodes can possibly be compensated by a potential decrease of traffic from
other source nodes.
#### 6.2.4.5 Message Prioritization
##### 6.2.4.5.1 Description
When performing message throttling:
\- PFCP requests related to priority traffic (i.e. eMPS as described in 3GPP
TS 22.153 [15]) and emergency have the highest priority. Depending on
regional/national requirements and network operator policy, these PFCP
requests shall be the last to be throttled, when applying traffic reduction,
and the priority traffic shall be exempted from throttling due to PFCP
overload control up to the point where the requested traffic reduction cannot
be achieved without throttling the priority traffic;
\- for other types of sessions, messages throttling should consider the
relative priority of the messages so that the messages which are considered as
low priority are considered for throttling before the other messages. The
relative priority of the messages may be derived from the relative priority of
the procedure for which the message is being sent or may be derived from the
session parameters such as APN, QCI, ARP and/or Low Access Priority Indicator
(LAPI).
NOTE: A random throttling mechanism, i.e. discarding the messages without any
special consideration, could result in an overall poor congestion mitigation
mechanism and bad user experience.
An overloaded node may also apply these message prioritization schemes when
handling incoming initial messages during an overloaded condition, as part of
a self-protection mechanism.
##### 6.2.4.5.2 Based on the Message Priority Signalled in the PFCP Message
Message prioritization may be performed by an overloaded node, when handling
incoming messages during an overloaded condition, based on the relative PFCP
message priority signalled in the PFCP header (see clause 7.2.2.3).
A PFCP entity shall determine whether to set and use the message priority in
PFCP signalling, based on operator policy. The requirements specified in this
clause shall apply if message priority in PFCP signalling is used.
A sending PFCP entity shall determine the relative message priority to signal
in the message according to the principles specified in clause 6.2.4.5.1. If
the message affects multiple bearers, the relative message priority should be
determined considering the highest priority ARP among all the bearers.
A PFCP entity should set the same message priority in a Response message as
received in the corresponding Request message.
For incoming PFCP messages that do not have a message priority in the PFCP
header, the receiving PFCP entity:
\- shall apply a default priority, if the incoming message is a Request
message;
\- should apply the message priority sent in the Request message, if the
incoming message is a Response message.
This feature should be supported homogenously across the CP functions and UP
functions in the network, otherwise an overloaded node will process Request
messages received from the non-supporting nodes according to the default
priority while Request messages received from supporting nodes will be
processed according to the message priority signalled in the PFCP message.
### 6.2.5 PFCP PFD Management Procedure
#### 6.2.5.1 General
PFCP PFD Management is a node level procedure.
The PFCP PFD Management procedure may be used by the CP function and UP
function to provision PFDs (e.g. received from the PFDF as specified in
clauses 5.11.4 and 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]) to the UP function, for one or
more Application Identifiers.
Support of this procedure is optional for the CP function and the UP function.
The UP function shall set the PFDM feature flag in the UP Function Features IE
if it supports the PFD Management procedure (see clause 8.2.25).
The UP function shall store the PFDs provisioned per Application Identifier.
These PFDs shall apply to all the PFCP session established in the UP function,
for all the controlling CP functions, i.e. the scope of a PFD is not limited
to the PFCP sessions established by the CP function which provisioned the PFD.
NOTE: Application identifiers preconfigured in the UP function, if any, need
to be distinct from application identifiers provisioned via PFD management
procedure.
#### 6.2.5.2 CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates the PFCP PFD Management procedure to provision PFDs
in the UP function, for one or more Application Identifier(s).
The CP function:
\- shall send the PFCP PFD Management Request message, including the full set
of PFD IDs and PFD contents to be provisioned in the UP function per
Application Identifier.
When the CP function receives a PFCP PFD Management Response with cause
success, the CP function shall consider that the PFDs have been provisioned as
requested.
#### 6.2.5.3 UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives a PFCP PFD Management Request message, it shall:
\- if no Application ID\'s PFDs IE is present in the request (i.e. empty
message):
\- delete all the PFDs received and stored earlier for all Application
Identifier(s) provisioned via the PFD Management Procedure;
\- if at least one Application ID\'s PFDs IE is present in the request:
\- delete all the PFDs received and stored earlier for the indicated
Application Identifier(s);
\- store all the PFDs received in the request for the indicated Application
Identifier(s);
\- send a PFCP PFD Management Response with the cause \"success\", if the
above operations were performed successfully;
\- if a PFD is removed/modified and this PFD was used to detect application
traffic related to an application identifier in a PDR created/activated for a
PFCP session and the UP function has reported the application start to the CP
function for the application or the application instance corresponding to this
PFD as defined in clause 5.4.11 ((Un)solicited Application Reporting), the UP
function shall report the application stop to the CP function for the
corresponding application or the corresponding application instance identifier
as defined in clause 5.4.11 if the removed/modified PFD in UP results in the
stop of the application or the application instance is not being able to be
detected. See clause 5.11.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
NOTE: Multiple PFDs can be associated with the application identifier. When
the removed/modified PFD is the last one which is used to detect traffic
identified by application id, the UPF reports application stop.
### 6.2.6 PFCP Association Setup Procedure
#### 6.2.6.1 General
PFCP Association Setup is a node level procedure.
The PFCP Association Setup procedure shall be used to setup a PFCP association
between a CP function and a UP function, to enable the CP function to use the
resources of the UP function subsequently, i.e. establish PFCP Sessions.
The setup of a PFCP association may be initiated by the CP function (see
clause 6.2.6.2) or the UP function (see clause 6.2.6.3).
The CP function and the UP function shall support the PFCP Association Setup
initiated by the CP function. The CP function and the UP function may
additionally support the PFCP Association Setup initiated by the UP function.
#### 6.2.6.2 PFCP Association Setup Initiated by the CP Function
##### 6.2.6.2.1 CP Function Behaviour
The CP function shall initiate the PFCP Association Setup procedure to request
to setup a PFCP association towards a UP function prior to establishing a
first PFCP session on this UP function.
The CP function shall retrieve an IP address of the UP function to send the
PFCP Association Setup Request, as specified in clause 5.8.1, and shall send a
PFCP Association Setup Request to the UP function with:
\- the Node ID of the CP function;
\- the list of optional features the CP function supports which may affect the
UP function behaviour, if any;
\- optionally, the PFCP Session Retention Information IE (see figure
7.4.4.1-2) to request the UP function to retain all or part of the existing
PFCP sessions if a PFCP association already exists in the UP function for the
same Node ID.
The CP function shall only initiate PFCP Session related signalling procedures
toward a UP function after it receives the PFCP Association Setup Response
with a successful cause from this UP function.
The CP function shall determine whether the UP function supports Sxa, Sxb, Sxc
and/or combined Sxa/Sxb by local configuration or optionally via DNS if
deployed.
##### 6.2.6.2.2 UP Function behaviour
When receiving a PFCP Association Setup Request, the UP function:
\- if the request is accepted:
\- shall store the Node ID of the CP function as the identifier of the PFCP
association;
\- shall send a PFCP Association Setup Response including:
\- a successful cause;
\- its Node ID;
\- information of all supported optional features in the UP function;
\- optionally one or more UE IP address Pool Information IE which contains a
list of UE IP Address Pool Identities per Network Instance, S-NSSAI and IP
version;
\- optionally the NF Instance ID of the UPF if available.
\- shall send a PFCP Version Not Supported Response if the PFCP header of the
request indicates a PFCP protocol version that is not supported by the UP
function;
\- otherwise, shall send a PFCP Association Setup Response with an appropriate
error cause if the request is rejected.
If the PFCP Association Setup Request contains a Node ID for which a PFCP
association was already established, the UP function shall:
\- proceed with establishing the new PFCP association (regardless of the
Recovery Timestamp received in the request), overwriting the existing
association;
\- retain the PFCP sessions that were established with the existing PFCP
association and that are requested to be retained, if the PFCP Session
Retention Information IE was received in the request; otherwise, delete the
PFCP sessions that were established with the existing PFCP association;
\- set the PSREI (PFCP Session Retained Indication) flag to \"1\" in the PFCP
Association Setup Response, if the PFCP Session Retention Information IE was
received in the Request and the requested PFCP sessions have been retained.
If the UPF is configured to be used for IPUPS, the UPF shall set the UUPSI
(UPF configured for IPUPS Indication) flag to \"1\" in the PFCP Association
Setup Response message.
#### 6.2.6.3 PFCP Association Setup Initiated by the UP Function
##### 6.2.6.3.1 UP Function Behaviour
The UP function initiates the PFCP Association Setup procedure to request to
setup a PFCP association towards a CP function. The UP function is configured
with a set of CP functions to which it shall establish a PFCP association.
The UP function:
\- shall retrieve an IP address of the CP function, e.g. based on local
configuration in the UP function;
\- shall send the PFCP Association Setup Request including:
\- the Node ID of the UP function;
\- information of all supported optional features in the UP function;
\- optionally one or more UE IP address Pool Information IE which contains a
list of UE IP Address Pool Identities per a given Network Instance, S-NSSAI
and IP version;
\- optionally the NF Instance ID of the UPF if available.
\- the UUPSI (UPF configured for IPUPS Indication) flag set to \"1\" if the
UPF is configured to be used for IPUPS.
##### 6.2.6.3.2 CP Function Behaviour
When receiving a PFCP Association Setup Request, the CP function:
\- if the request is accepted:
\- shall store the Node ID of the UP function as the identifier of the PFCP
association;
\- shall send a PFCP Association Setup Response with a successful cause, its
Node ID, and information of the list of optional features the CP function
supports which may affect the UP function behaviour, if any;
\- shall send a PFCP Version Not Supported Response if the PFCP header of the
request indicates a PFCP protocol version that is not supported by the CP
function;
\- otherwise, shall send a PFCP Association Setup Response with an appropriate
error cause if the request is rejected.
The CP function shall only initiate PFCP Session related signalling procedures
toward a UP function after it has sent the PFCP Association Setup Response
with a successful cause to the UP function.
The CP function shall determine the UP function supports Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and/or
combined Sxa/Sxb by local configuration or optionally via DNS if deployed.
### 6.2.7 PFCP Association Update Procedure
#### 6.2.7.1 General
PFCP Association Update is a node level procedure.
The PFCP Association Update procedure shall be used to modify an existing PFCP
association between the CP function and the UP function. It may be initiated
by the UP function or by the CP function to update the supported features or
available resources of the UP function.
#### 6.2.7.2 PFCP Association Update Procedure Initiated by the CP Function
##### 6.2.7.2.1 CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates the PFCP Association Update procedure to report
changes to the PFCP association to the UP function, e.g. to update the
supported features.
When both the CP function and UP function support the EPFAR feature, the CP
function may send a PFCP Association Update Request with the \"PFCP
Association Release Preparation Start\" flag set to \"1\" when the CP function
decides to release the PFCP association and request the UP function to report
all non-zero usage reports for the PFCP session affected by the release of the
PFCP association, as specified in clause 5.18.
##### 6.2.7.2.2 UP Function Behaviour
When receiving a PFCP Association Update Request, the UP function:
\- shall update the list of optional features of the CP function, when
received;
\- shall send a PFCP Association Update Response with an appropriate error
cause if the Node ID is not known by the UP Function;
\- shall return a PFCP Association Update Response with a successful cause
value, if the PFCP Association Update Request is handled successfully.
When both the CP function and UP function support the EPFAR feature, and the
CP function has set the \"PFCP Association Release Preparation\" set to \"1\"
in the PFCP Association Update Request message, the UP function shall send the
PFCP Association Update Response to CP function with successful cause value
and then send PFCP Session Report Request messages to report non-zero usage
reports (at least one message per PFCP Session) for the PFCP Sessions affected
by the release of the PFCP association, as specified in clause 5.18.
#### 6.2.7.3 PFCP Association Update Procedure Initiated by UP Function
##### 6.2.7.3.1 UP Function Behaviour
The UP function initiates the PFCP Association Update procedure to report
changes to the PFCP association to the CP function, e.g. change of optional
features, an indication to request to release the PFCP association, change of
the UE IP Address Pool Identifies configured in the UP function.
The UP function may send a PFCP Association Update Request to request the CP
function to perform the release of the PFCP association, optionally providing
a Graceful Release Period.
When the Enhanced PFCP Association Release feature (EPFAR) (see clause 5.18)
is supported by both the CP function and UP function, the UP function:
\- may send a PFCP Association Update Request with the flag \"PFCP Association
Release Preparation\" set to \"1\" when the UP function decides to release the
PFCP association and thus inform the CP function that all non-zero usage
reports for those PFCP session affected by the release of the PFCP association
will be reported;
\- shall then send a PFCP Association Update Request, with the URSS flag set
to \"1\" once all non-zero usage reports for all the PFCP Sessions affected by
the release of PFCP Association have been sent to the CP function.
After reception of the PFCP Association Update Response, the UP function shall
consider that the PFCP association is still setup until receiving a PFCP
Association Release Request. When the UP function requests to release the PFCP
Association and sends a PFCP Association Update Request message with a
Graceful Release Period or with the URSS flag set, if no PFCP Association
Release Request is received before the Graceful Release Period or a
configurable timer (when the URSS flag is set) expires, the UP function may
locally release the association, behaving as if the PFCP Association Release
Request had been received.
##### 6.2.7.3.2 CP Function Behaviour
When receiving a PFCP Association Update Request, the CP function:
\- shall update the list of optional features of the UP function, when
received;
\- shall send a PFCP Association Update Response with an appropriate error
cause if the Node ID is not known by the CP Function;
\- shall return a PFCP Association Update Response with a successful cause
value if the PFCP Association Update Request is handled successfully.
If the UP function has requested to release the PFCP association in the PFCP
Association Update Request, the CP function should initiate a PFCP Association
Release Request to release the PFCP association, as soon as possible if no
Graceful Release Period was included in the request or before the expiry of
the Graceful Release Period. The CP function should stop creating new PFCP
sessions in the UP function during the Graceful Release Period. When the final
usage report(s) for a PFCP Session (upon being deleted) is required, e.g.
based on operator policies, the CP function should initiate a PFCP Session
Deletion Procedure to collect the usage reports per PFCP Session affected by
the release of PFCP Association before the Graceful Release Period is expired.
When both the CP function and UP function support the EPFAR feature, and if
the UP function has set the URSS flag to \"1\" in the PFCP Association Update
Request message, the CP function shall send the PFCP Association Update
Response with successful cause value to indicate the PFCP Association Update
Request is handled successfully and then immediately initiate the PFCP
Association Release Procedure, as specified in clause 5.18.
If the UP function has included UE IP address Pool Identity IE in the PFCP
Association Update Request message, the CP function shall use it to overwrite
the UE IP address Pool Identity previously received from the UP function.
### 6.2.8 PFCP Association Release Procedure
#### 6.2.8.1 General
PFCP Association Release is a node level procedure.
The PFCP Association Release procedure shall be used to terminate **the PFCP
association between the CP Function and the UP Function due to e.g. OAM
reasons. The** PFCP Association Release Request may be initiated by the CP
function.
When the final usage report(s) for a PFCP Session is required, e.g. based on
the operator policies, the CP function should retrieve the final usage reports
for the PFCP Sessions affected by the release of PFCP Association, i.e. by
initiating a PFCP Session Deletion Procedure towards the UP function for every
PFCP session, before it initiates PFCP Association Release Request.
#### 6.2.8.2 CP Function Behaviour
If the CP function initiates the PFCP Association Release procedure to release
an existing PFCP association, the CP function:
\- shall delete locally all the PFCP sessions related to that PFCP association
when receiving the PFCP Association Release Response with the cause value
success.
#### 6.2.8.3 UP Function behaviour
When the UP function receives a PFCP Association Release Request, the UP
function:
\- shall delete all the PFCP sessions related to that PFCP association
locally;
\- shall delete the PFCP association and any related information (e.g. Node ID
of the CP function);
\- shall send a PFCP Association Release Response with a successful cause.
NOTE: The UP function always accepts a PFCP Association Release Request.
### 6.2.9 PFCP Node Report Procedure
#### 6.2.9.1 General
PFCP Node Report Procedure is a node level procedure.
The PFCP Node Report procedure shall be used by the UP function to report
information to the CP function which is not related to a specific PFCP
session, e.g. to report a user plane path failure affecting all the PFCP
sessions towards a remote GTP-U peer.
#### 6.2.9.2 UP Function Behaviour
The UP function shall initiate the PFCP Node Report procedure to report
information to the CP function. The UP function:
\- shall send the PFCP Node Report Request message, including the information
to be reported.
When the UP function receives a PFCP Node Report Response with the cause
success, the UP function shall consider the information successfully delivered
to the CP function.
#### 6.2.9.3 CP Function behaviour
When the CP function receives a PFCP Node Report Request message, it shall:
\- process the information being reported as appropriate and send a PFCP Node
Report Response with the cause \"success\";
\- otherwise return an appropriate error cause value.
## 6.3 PFCP Session Related Procedures
### 6.3.1 General
The following clauses describe the session related procedures over the Sxa,
Sxb and Sxc reference points. The behaviour of the CP function and UP function
when sending and receiving session related messages is described.
### 6.3.2 PFCP Session Establishment Procedure
#### 6.3.2.1 General
The PFCP Session Establishment procedure shall be used to setup a PFCP session
between CP function and UP function and configure Rules in the UP function so
that the UP function can handle incoming packets.
#### 6.3.2.2 CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates the PFCP Session Establishment procedure to create a
PFCP session for a PDN connection, or IP-CAN session or TDF session or for
applying a certain IP packets treatment which is not associated with any PDN
connection or TDF session.
The CP function:
\- shall send the PFCP Session Establishment Request message with a new PFCP
F-SEID together with Rules to be created;
\- may include its current Recovery Time Stamp as specified in clause 19A of
TS 3GPP TS 23.007 [24].
When the CP function receives a PFCP Session Establishment Response with cause
success, the CP function shall continue with the procedure which triggered the
PFCP Session Establishment procedure.
#### 6.3.2.3 UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives a PFCP Session Establishment Request message it
shall:
\- store and apply the rules received in the request and send a PFCP Session
Establishment Response with cause \"success\", if all rules in the PFCP
Session Establishment Request are stored and applied;
\- Otherwise, if at least one rule failed to be stored or applied, return an
appropriate error cause value with the Rule ID of the Rule causing the first
error, discard all the received rules and not create any PFCP session context.
### 6.3.3 PFCP Session Modification Procedure
#### 6.3.3.1 General
The PFCP Session Modification procedure shall be used to modify an existing
PFCP session, e.g. to configure a new rule, to modify an existing rule, to
delete an existing rule.
#### 6.3.3.2 CP Function behaviour
The CP function initiates the PFCP Session Modification procedure to modify an
existing PFCP session, e.g. triggered by a modification of PDN connection, IP
CAN session or TDF session.
The CP function shall:
\- include a complete PDI if the PDI in the existing PDR is to be updated;
\- remove locally the reference to a rule in the PDRs when the related Rule is
deleted;
\- provide all the new, updated or deleted Rules. The Updated Rules shall
contain only the information which are changed, added and/or deleted.
The CP function shall not include multiple updates in a PFCP Modification
Request message, e.g. Create PDR, Update PDR and Remove PDR, for the same rule
identified by the Rule ID.
When the CP function receives a PFCP Session Modification Response with the
cause \"success\" it shall continue with the procedure which has initiated the
PFCP Session Modification procedure.
#### 6.3.3.3 UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives a PFCP Session Modification Request it shall:
\- send the PFCP Session Modification Response message with a rejection cause
value set to \"Session context not found\" if the F-SEID included in the PFCP
Session Modification Request message is unknown;
\- reject a modification request which would relate to a rule not existing in
the UP function;
\- discard any updates on the PFCP session context included in the PFCP
Session Modification Request message if the request is rejected and send a
PFCP Session Modification Response with an appropriate error cause together
with additional information e.g. indicating the first Rule ID of the Rule
causing the error. In this case, the UP function shall continue with the
existing PFCP session context for the PFCP session as if the PFCP Session
Modification Request had not been received;
\- remove all rules identified by a Rule ID to be removed and remove the Rule
ID from the PDR(s) from where they are referenced;
\- send the PFCP Session Modification Response with an acceptance cause value
if all the requested modifications are accepted and performed successfully.
### 6.3.4 PFCP Session Deletion Procedure
#### 6.3.4.1 General
The PFCP Session Deletion procedure shall be used to delete an existing PFCP
session between the CP function and the UP function.
#### 6.3.4.2 CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates a PFCP Session Deletion procedure towards the UP
function to delete an existing PFCP session e.g. when the corresponding PDN is
deleted.
The CP shall:
\- send a PFCP Session Deletion Request with the F-SEID identifying the PFCP
session.
When the CP function receives PFCP Session Deletion Response with cause
success, the CP function shall continue with the procedure which triggers the
PFCP Session Deletion procedure.
#### 6.3.4.3 UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives a PFCP Session Deletion Request it shall:
\- send the PFCP Session Deletion Response message with a rejection cause set
to \"Session context not found\" if the F-SEID include in the PFCP Session
Deletion Request message is unknown;
\- send the PFCP Session Deletion Response message with an acceptance cause if
the PFCP session and associated rules are deleted successfully, and include
any pending Usage Report(s) in the message.
### 6.3.5 PFCP Session Report Procedure
#### 6.3.5.1 General
The PFCP Session Report procedure shall be used by the UP function to report
information related to the PFCP session to the CP function.
#### 6.3.5.2 UP Function Behaviour
The UP function shall initiate the PFCP Session Report procedure to report
information related to a PFCP session to the CP function. The UP function:
\- shall send the PFCP Session Report Request message, identifying the PFCP
session for which the report is sent and including the information to be
reported.
If the Enhanced PFCP Association Release feature (EPFAR) is supported by both
the CP function and UP function, the UP function may send a PFCP Session
Report Request message with the flag PSDBU being set to \"1\" to the CP
function to report that the PFCP session is being deleted in the UP function,
as specified in clause 5.18, e.g. to report remaining non-zero usage reports
for all URRs in the PFCP Session before the PFCP Session is locally deleted in
the UP function during an Enhanced PFCP Association Release procedure.
When the UP function receives a PFCP Session Report Response with the cause
success, the UP function shall consider the information to be successfully
delivered to the CP function.
#### 6.3.5.3 CP Function Behaviour
When the CP function receives a PFCP Session Report Request message, it shall:
\- send the PFCP Session Report Response message with a rejection cause set to
\"Session context not found\" if the F-SEID included in the PFCP Session
Report Request message is unknown;
\- process the information being reported as appropriate and send a PFCP
Session Report Response with the cause \"success\";
\- otherwise return an appropriate error cause value.
If the Enhanced PFCP Association Release feature (EPFAR) is supported by both
the CP function and UP function, the CP function shall consider that a PFCP
Session is locally deleted in the UP function upon receiving a PFCP Session
Report Request message from the UP function with the flag PSDBU being set to
\"1\".
## 6.4 Reliable Delivery of PFCP Messages
Reliable delivery of PFCP messages is accomplished by retransmission of these
messages as specified in this clause.
A PFCP entity shall maintain, for each triplet of local IP address, local UDP
port and remote peer\'s IP address, a sending queue with Request messages to
be sent to that peer. Each message shall be sent with a Sequence Number and be
held until a corresponding Response is received or until the PFCP entity
ceases retransmission of that message. The Sequence Number shall be unique for
each outstanding Request message sourced from the same IP/UDP endpoint. A PFCP
entity may have several outstanding Requests waiting for replies.
When sending a Request message, the sending PFCP entity shall start a timer
T1. The sending entity shall consider that the Request message has been lost
if a corresponding Response message has not been received before the T1 timer
expires. If so, the sending entity shall retransmit the Request message, if
the total number of retry attempts is less than N1 times. The setting of the
T1 timer and N1 counter is implementation specific.
A retransmitted PFCP message shall have the same message content, including
the same PFCP header, UDP ports, source and destination IP addresses as the
originally transmitted message.
A Request and its Response message shall have the same Sequence Number value,
i.e. the Sequence Number in the PFCP header of the Response message shall be
copied from the respective Request message. A Request and its Response
messages are matched based on the Sequence Number and the IP address and UDP
port.
Not counting retransmissions, a Request message shall be answered with a
single Response message. Duplicated Response messages shall be discarded by
the receiver. A received Response message not matching an outstanding Request
message waiting for a reply should be discarded.
The PFCP entity should inform the upper layer when detecting an unsuccessful
transfer of a Request message to enable the controlling upper entity to take
any appropriate measure.
## 6.5 PFCP messages bundling
PFCP messages bundling is an optional procedure that may be supported by the
CP function and the UP function.
PFCP messages bundling may be used if both the CP function and the UP function
have indicated support of the corresponding feature (see clauses 8.2.25 and
8.2.58) during the PFCP Association Setup or Update procedure. If so, the
following requirements shall apply.
Several PFCP session related requests and/or responses messages, related to
the same PFCP session or to different PFCP sessions handled by the same peer
PFCP entity (i.e. with the peer\'s F-SEID having the same IP address, or with
the same peer\'s IP address for PFCP Session Establishment Requests), may be
bundled together in a single UDP/IP packet as specified in clause 7.2.1A, when
being sent to that peer PFCP entity. PFCP messages may be bundled towards a
PFCP entity of a UP function or of a CP function, independently.
NOTE 1: If the CP function bundles few PFCP session related requests in one
UDP/IP packet it sends to a UP function, the UP function can return responses
in separate UDP/IP packets or it can bundle some of the responses together
with other PFCP session related messages.
NOTE 2: Bundling PFCP messages in a single UDP/IP packet enable to enhance
performance and scalability (reduced CPU and memory cost thanks to reducing
the number of packets to be packetized, exchanged and processed over N4).
PFCP session related messages handled by different peer PFCP entities (i.e.
with the peer\'s F-SEID having different IP addresses) shall not be bundled
together. PFCP node related messages shall not be bundled either.
The procedures specified in the rest of this specification shall apply for
each PFCP message that is bundled in a UDP/IP packet, as if the PFCP message
was sent in its own individual UDP/IP packet, i.e. PFCP messages bundling
shall not incur any change to the PFCP protocol other than what is described
in this clause.
NOTE 3: Each PFCP message bundled in a single UDP/IP packet has its own
sequence number. Besides, if a UDP/IP packet carrying bundled PFCP messages is
lost, retransmitted PFCP messages do not need to be bundled in the same manner
as when sent originally.
# 7 Messages and Message Formats
## 7.1 Transmission Order and Bit Definitions
PFCP messages shall be transmitted in network octet order starting with octet
1 with the most significant bit sent first.
The most significant bit of an octet in a PFCP message is bit 8. If a field in
a PFCP message spans over several octets, the most significant bit is bit 8 of
the octet with the lowest number, unless specified otherwise.

The FO\" (Follow On) flag in the PFCP message header of each PFCP message
bundled in the UDP/IP packet, except the last PFCP message, shall be set to
\"1\" to indicate that another PFCP message follows in the UDP/IP packet. See
clause 7.2.2.
### 7.2.2 Message Header
#### 7.2.2.1 General Format
PFCP messages use a variable length header. The message header length shall be
a multiple of 4 octets. Figure 7.2.2.1-1 illustrates the format of the PFCP

#### 7.2.2.4 Usage of the PFCP Header
##### 7.2.2.4.1 General
The format of the PFCP header is specified in clause 7.2.2.
The usage of the PFCP header shall be as defined below.
The first octet of the header shall be used is the following way:
\- Bit 1 represents the \"S\" flag, which indicates if SEID field is present
in the PFCP header or not. If the \"S\" flag is set to \"0\", then the SEID
field shall not be present in the PFCP header. If the \"S\" flag is set to
\"1\", then the SEID field shall immediately follow the Length field, in
octets 5 to 12. Apart from the node related messages, in all PFCP messages the
value of the \"S\" flag shall be set to \"1\".
\- Bit 2 represents the \"MP\" flag. If the \"MP\" flag is set to \"1\", then
bits 8 to 5 of octet 16 shall indicate the relative priority of the PFCP
message. It shall be encoded as the binary value of the Message Priority and
it may take any value between 0 and 15, where 0 corresponds to the highest
priority and 15 the lowest priority.
\- Bit 3 represents the \"FO\" (Follow On) flag. If the \"FO\" flag is set to
\"1\", then another PFCP message follows in the UDP/IP packet (see clauses 6.5
and 7.2.1A).
\- Bit 4 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the
receiving entity shall ignore it.
\- Bit 5 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the
receiving entity shall ignore it.
\- Bits 6 to 8, which represent the PFCP version, shall be set to decimal 1
(\"001\").
The usage of the fields in octets 2 - n of the header shall be as specified
below.
\- Octet 2 represents the Message type field, which shall be set to the unique
value for each type of control plane message. Message type values are
specified in Table 7.3-1 \"Message types\".
\- Octets 3 to 4 represent the Message Length field. This field shall indicate
the length of the message in octets excluding the mandatory part of the PFCP
header (the first 4 octets). The SEID (if present) and the Sequence Number
shall be included in the length count. The format of the Length field of
information elements is specified in clause 8.2 \"Information Element
Format\".
\- When S=1, Octets 5 to 12 represent the Session Endpoint Identifier (SEID)
field. This field shall unambiguously identify a session endpoint in the
receiving Packet Forward Control entity. The Session Endpoint Identifier is
set by the sending entity in the PFCP header of all control plane messages to
the SEID value provided by the corresponding receiving entity (CP or UP
function). If a peer\'s SEID is not available the SEID field shall be present
in a PFCP header, but its value shall be set to \"0\", \"Conditions for
sending SEID=0 in PFCP header\".
NOTE: The SEID in the PFCP header of a message is set to the SEID value
provided by the corresponding receiving entity regardless of whether the
source IP address of the request message and the IP Destination Address
provided by the receiving entity for subsequent request messages are the same
or not.
\- Octets 13 to 15 represent PFCP Sequence Number field.
##### 7.2.2.4.2 Conditions for Sending SEID=0 in PFCP Header
If a peer\'s SEID is not available, the SEID field shall still be present in
the header and its value shall be set to \"0\" in the following messages:
\- PFCP Session Establishment Request message on Sxa/Sxb/Sxc/N4;
\- If a node receives a message for which it has no session, i.e. if SEID in
the PFCP header is not known, it shall respond with \"Session context not
found\" cause in the corresponding response message to the sender, the SEID
used in the PFCP header in the response message shall be then set to \"0\";
\- If a node receives a request message containing protocol error, e.g.
Mandatory IE missing, which requires the receiver to reject the message as
specified in clause 7.6, it shall reject the request message. For the response
message, the node should look up the remote peer\'s SEID and accordingly set
SEID in the PFCP header and the message cause code. As an implementation
option, the node may not look up the remote peer\'s SEID and set the PFCP
header SEID to \"0\" in the response message. However in this case, the cause
value shall not be set to \"Session not found\".
\- When the UP function sends PFCP Session Report Request message over N4
towards another SMF or another PFCP entity in the SMF as specified in clause
5.22.2 and clause 5.22.3.
### 7.2.3 Information Elements
#### 7.2.3.1 General
The format of PFCP Information Elements are defined in clause 8.2.
#### 7.2.3.2 Presence Requirements of Information Elements
IEs within PFCP messages shall be specified with one of the following presence
requirement:
\- Mandatory: this means that the IE shall be included by the sending entity,
and that the receiver diagnoses a \"Mandatory IE missing\" error when
detecting that the IE is not present. A response including a \"Mandatory IE
missing\" cause, shall include the type of the missing IE.
\- Conditional: this means that:
\- the IE shall be included by sending entity if the conditions specified are
met;
\- the receiver shall check the conditions as specified in the corresponding
message type description, based on the parameter combination in the message
and/or on the state of the receiving node, to infer if a conditional IE shall
be expected. Only if a receiver has sufficient information, if a conditional
IE, which is necessary for the receiving entity to complete the procedure, is
missing, then the receiver shall abort the procedure.
\- Conditional-Optional: this means that:
\- the IE shall be included by a sending entity complying with the version of
the specification, if the conditions specified in the relevant protocol
specification are met. An entity, which is at an earlier version of the
protocol and therefore is not up-to-date, cannot send this IE;
\- the receiver need not check the presence of the IE in the message. If the
receiver checks the presence of the Conditional-Optional IE, then the IE\'s
absence shall not trigger any of the error handling procedures. The handling
of an absence or erroneous such IEs shall be treated as Optional IEs as
specified in clause 7.6.
\- Optional: this means that:
\- the IE shall be included as a service option. Therefore, the IE may be
included or not in a message. The handling of an absent optional IE, or an
erroneous optional IE is specified in clause 7.6.
For conditional IEs, the clause describing the PFCP message explicitly defines
the conditions under which the inclusion of each IE becomes mandatory or
optional for that particular message. These conditions shall be defined so
that the presence of a conditional IE only becomes mandatory if it is critical
for the receiving entity. The definition might reference other protocol
specifications for final terms used as part of the condition.
For grouped IEs, the presence requirement of the embedded IE shall follow the
rules:
\- If the grouped IE is Mandatory within a given message: the presence
requirements of individual embedded IEs are as stated within the Mandatory
grouped IE for the given message;
\- if the grouped IE is Conditional within a given message: if the embedded IE
in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as
Conditional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is
Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the
receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE
is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver;
\- if the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional within a given message: if the
embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is
viewed as Conditional-Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the
grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE
by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this
embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver;
\- if the grouped IE is Optional within a given message: all embedded IEs in
the grouped IE are viewed as Optional IEs by the receiver.
In all of the above cases, appropriate error handling as described in clause
7.6 shall be applied for protocol errors of the embedded IEs.
Only the Cause IE at message level shall be included in the response if the
Cause contains a value that indicates that the request is not accepted,
regardless of whether there are other mandatory or conditional IEs defined for
a given response message. The following are exceptions:
\- the Node ID and Offending IE shall be included as per the requirements
specified for the corresponding response message;
\- the Load Control Information, Overload Control Information and the Failed
Rule ID IEs may be included in a PFCP session related message.
If the Cause IE at Grouped IE level contains a value that indicates that the
Grouped IE is not handled correctly, the other IEs in this Grouped IE, other
than the Cause IE, may not be included.
#### 7.2.3.3 Grouped Information Elements
A Grouped IE is an IE which may contain other IEs.
Grouped IEs have a length value in the TLV encoding, which includes the added
length of all the embedded IEs. Overall coding of a grouped IE with 4 octets
long IE header is defined in clause 8.2. Each IE within a grouped IE also
shall also contain 4 octets long IE header.
Grouped IEs are not marked by any flag or limited to a specific range of IE
type values. The clause describing an IE in this specification shall
explicitly state if it is a Grouped IE.
NOTE: Each entry into each Grouped IE creates a new scope level. Exit from the
grouped IE closes the scope level. The PFCP message level is the top most
scope.
If more than one grouped IEs of the same type, but for a different purpose are
sent within the same message level, these IEs shall have different IE types.
If more than one grouped IEs of the same type and for the same purpose are
sent within the same message level, these IEs shall have exactly the same IE
type to represent a list.
Assigning the same IE type to grouped IEs which don\'t have the same content
is not recommended, even if these grouped IEs are in different message levels.
#### 7.2.3.4 Information Element Type
An IE in a PFCP message or Grouped IE is identified by its IE Type and
described by a specific row in the corresponding tables in clause 7.
If several IEs with the same Type are included in a PFCP message or Grouped
IE, they represent a list for the corresponding IE name.
An IE Type value uniquely identifies a specific IE.
One IE type value is specified for Vendor Specific IEs.

## 7.6 Error Handling
### 7.6.1 Protocol Errors
A protocol error is defined as a message or an Information Element received
from a peer entity with an unknown type, or if it is unexpected, or if it has
an erroneous content.
The term silently discarded is used in the following clauses to mean that the
receiving PFCP entity\'s implementation shall discard such a message without
further processing or that the receiving PFCP entity discards such an IE and
continues processing the message. The conditions for the receiving PFCP entity
to silently discard an IE are specified in the subsequent clauses.
The handling of unknown, unexpected or erroneous PFCP messages and IEs shall
provide for the forward compatibility of PFCP. Therefore, the sending PFCP
entity shall be able to safely include in a message a new conditional-optional
or an optional IE. Such an IE may also have a new type value. Any legacy
receiving PFCP entity shall, however, silently discard such an IE and continue
processing the message.
If a protocol error is detected by the receiving PFCP entity, it should log
the event including the erroneous message and may include the error in a
statistical counter.
For Response messages containing a rejection Cause value, see clause 7.2.3.2.
The receiving PFCP entity shall apply the error handling specified in the
subsequent clauses.
If the received erroneous message is a reply to an outstanding PFCP message,
the PFCP transaction layer shall stop retransmissions and notify the PFCP
application layer of the error even if the reply is silently discarded.
### 7.6.2 Different PFCP Versions
If a PFCP entity receives a message of an unsupported PFCP version, it shall
return a PFCP Version Not Supported Response message and silently discard the
received message.
### 7.6.3 PFCP Message of Invalid Length
If a PFCP entity receives a message, which is too short to contain the
respective PFCP header, the PFCP-PDU shall be silently discarded.
If a PFCP entity receives a Request message within an IP/UDP packet of a
length that is inconsistent with the value specified in the Length field of
the PFCP header, then the receiving PFCP entity should log the error and shall
send the Response message with Cause IE value set to \"Invalid Length\".
If a PFCP entity receives a Response message within an IP/UDP packet of a
length that is inconsistent with the value specified in the Length field of
the PFCP header, then the receiving PFCP entity should log the error and shall
silently discard the message.
### 7.6.4 Unknown PFCP Message
If a PFCP entity receives a message with an unknown Message Type value, it
shall silently discard the message.
### 7.6.5 Unexpected PFCP Message
If a PFCP entity receives an unexpected request message, for example a known
message that is sent over an interface for which the message is not defined,
or a message that is sent over an interface for which the message is defined,
but the direction is incorrect, then the PFCP entity shall silently discard
the message and shall log an error.
If a PFCP entity receives an unexpected response message which is not a
request message, for example a message for which there is no corresponding
outstanding request, it shall discard the message and may log an error.
### 7.6.6 Missing Information Elements
A PFCP entity shall check if all mandatory IEs are present in the received
Request message. Apart from Heartbeat Request message, if one or more
mandatory information elements are missing in the received Request message,
the PFCP entity should log the error and shall send a Response message with
Cause IE value set to \"Mandatory IE missing\" with the type of the missing
mandatory IE.
If a PFCP entity receives a Response message with Cause IE value set to
\"Mandatory IE missing\", it shall notify its upper layer.
A PFCP entity shall check if all mandatory IEs are present in the received
Response message without a rejection Cause value. If one or more mandatory
information elements are missing, the PFCP entity shall notify the upper layer
and should log the error.
A PFCP entity shall check if conditional information elements are present in
the received Request message, if possible (i.e. if the receiving entity has
sufficient information available to check if the respective conditions were
met). If one or more conditional information elements are missing, a PFCP
entity should log the error and shall send a Response message with Cause IE
value set to \"Conditional IE missing\" together with the type of the missing
conditional IE.
A PFCP entity shall check if conditional information elements are present in
the received Response message without a rejection Cause value, if possible
(i.e. if the receiving entity has sufficient information available to check if
the respective conditions were met). If one or more conditional information
elements are missing, a PFCP entity shall notify the upper layer and should
log the error.
Additional information elements may be included in Response messages
containing a rejection Cause value, see clause 7.2.3.2.
Absence of an optional information element shall not trigger any error
handling.
### 7.6.7 Invalid Length Information Element
An information element has an invalid length when the actual length of the IE
is different from the value of the Length field in the IE header. Here, the
actual length of the IE means the length of the content field of the received
IE.
If a PFCP message contains more than one information elements and one or more
of them have invalid length, the receiving PFCP entity can detect which of the
IEs have invalid length only in the following cases:
\- If the Length value in the IE header is greater than the overall length of
the message;
\- If the invalid length IE is the last one in the message.
Apart from Echo Request message, if a receiving PFCP entity detects
information element with invalid length in a Request message, it shall send an
appropriate error response with Cause IE value set to \"Invalid length\"
together with the type of the offending IE.
### 7.6.8 Semantically incorrect Information Element
Apart from Echo Request message, the receiver of a PFCP signalling message
Request including a mandatory or a verifiable conditional information element
with a semantically invalid Value shall discard the request, should log the
error, and shall send a response with Cause IE value set to \"Mandatory IE
incorrect\" together with a type and instance of the offending IE.
The receiver of a PFCP signalling message Response including a mandatory or a
verifiable conditional information element with a semantically invalid Value
shall notify the upper layer that a message with this sequence number has been
received and should log the error.
If a PFCP entity receives an information element with a value which is shown
as reserved, it shall treat that information element as invalid and should log
the error. If the invalid IE is received in a Request, and it is a mandatory
IE or a verifiable conditional IE, the PFCP entity shall send a response with
Cause set to \"Mandatory IE incorrect\" together with a type and instance of
the offending IE.
The principle is: the use of reserved values invokes error handling; the use
of spare values can be silently discarded and for IEs with spare values used,
processing shall be continued ignoring the spare values.
The receiver of a PFCP signalling message including an optional information
element with a Value that is not in the range defined for this information
element value shall discard this IE, but shall treat the rest of the message
as if this IE was absent and continue processing. The receiver shall not check
the content of an information element field that is defined as \"spare\".
All semantically incorrect optional information elements in a PFCP signalling
message shall be treated as not present in the message.
### 7.6.9 Unknown or unexpected Information Element
The receiver of a PFCP message including an unexpected information element
with a known Type value that is not defined for this message shall discard the
IE and log an error. The receiver shall process the message.
NOTE: An Information Element in an encoded PFCP message or grouped IE is
identified by the IE Type.
### 7.6.10 Repeated Information Elements
An Information Element is repeated if there is more than one IE with the same
IE Type in the scope of the PFCP message (or in the scope of the grouped IE).
Such an IE is a member in a list.
If an information element is repeated in a PFCP signalling message in which
repetition of the information element is not specified, only the contents of
the information element appearing first shall be handled and all subsequent
repetitions of the information element shall be ignored. When the number of
repetitions of information elements is specified, only the contents of
specified repeated information elements shall be handled and all subsequent
repetitions of the information element shall be ignored.

NOTE 1: If the Bit 8 of Octet 1 is not set, this indicates that the IE is
defined by 3GPP and the Enterprise ID is absent. If Bit 8 of Octet 1 is set,
this indicates that the IE is defined by a vendor and the Enterprise ID is
present identified by the Enterprise ID.
An IE has the following mandatory fields:
\- Type: this field indicates the type of the Information Element. IE type
values within the range of 0 to 32767 are reserved for IE defined by 3GPP and
are listed in clause 8.1.2 IE type values within the range of 32768 to 65535
are used for vendor-specific IE and the value allocation is controlled by the
vendor.
\- Length: this field contains the length of the IE excluding the first four
octets, which are common for all IEs (Type and Length) and is denoted \"n\" in
Figure 8.1.1-1 and in Figure 8.1.1-2. Bit 8 of the lowest numbered octet is
the most significant bit and bit 1 of the highest numbered octet is the least
significant bit.
An IE has the following optional fields:
\- Enterprise ID: if the IE type value is within the range of 32768 to 65535,
this field shall contain the IANA-assigned \"SMI Network Management Private
Enterprise Codes\" value of the vendor defining the IE. The Enterprise ID set
to \"10415\" (IANA-assigned \"SMI Network Management Private Enterprise
Codes\") shall not be used for the vendor specific IEs.
For illustration, Figure 8.1.1-2 depicts the format of a Information Element
(IE) defined by 3GPP and is specified in this specification. For IE\'s defined
by 3GPP, the IE type shall be within the range of 0 to 32767.

this IE is vendor specific and therefore out of scope of this specification.
### 8.1.2 Information Element Types
A PFCP message may contain several IEs. In order to have forward compatible
type definitions for the PFCP IEs, all of them shall be TLV (Type, Length,
Value) coded. PFCP IE type values are specified in the Table 8.1.2-1.
The 3^rd^ column of this table specifies if the IE is either Extendable or has
a variable length or a fixed length and a reference to the clause where the IE
is specified:
\- Fixed Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and a fixed number of
octets;
\- Variable Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and has a variable
number of octets.\ For example, the last octets may be numbered similar to \"5
to (n+4)\". In this example, if the value of the length field, n, is 0, then
the last field is not present;
\- Extendable: the IE has a variable number of fields, and has a variable
number of octets.\ The last fields are typically specified with the statement:
\"These octet(s) is/are present only if explicitly specified\". The legacy
receiving entity shall ignore the unknown octets.
The 4^th^ column of this table indicates the number of fixed Octets the IE
contained when the IE was first defined in the specification, which shall be
an integer value reflecting the minimum length of fixed octets defined for the
IE.
An IE of any of the above types may have a null length as specified in clause
5.6.3. This shall not be considered as an error by the receiving PFCP entity.
In order to improve the efficiency of troubleshooting, it is recommended that
the IEs should be arranged in the signalling messages as well as in the
grouped IEs, according to the order the IEs are listed in the message
definition table or grouped IE definition table in clause 7. However the
receiving entity shall be prepared to handle the messages with IEs in any
order.
Within IEs, certain fields may be described as spare. These bits shall be
transmitted with the value set to \"0\". To allow for future features, the
receiver shall not evaluate these bits.

Figure 8.2.5-1: SDF Filter
The following flags are coded within Octet 5:
\- Bit 1 -- FD (Flow Description): If this bit is set to \"1\", then the
Length of Flow Description and the Flow Description fields shall be present,
otherwise they shall not be present.
\- Bit 2 -- TTC (ToS Traffic Class): If this bit is set to \"1\", then the ToS
Traffic Class field shall be present, otherwise the ToS Traffic Class field
shall not be present.
\- Bit 3 -- SPI (Security Parameter Index): If this bit is set to \"1\", then
the Security Parameter Index field shall be present, otherwise the Security
Parameter Index field shall not be present.

The Flow Description field, when present, shall be encoded as an OctetString
as specified in clause 5.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The ToS Traffic Class field, when present, shall be encoded as an OctetString
on two octets as specified in clause 5.3.15 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The Security Parameter Index field, when present, shall be encoded as an
OctetString on four octets and shall contain the IPsec security parameter
index (which is a 32-bit field), as specified in clause 5.3.51 of 3GPP TS
29.212 [8].
The Flow Label field, when present, shall be encoded as an OctetString on 3
octets as specified in clause 5.3.52 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and shall contain
an IPv6 flow label (which is a 20-bit field). The bits 8 to 5 of the octet
\"v\" shall be spare and set to zero, and the remaining 20 bits shall contain
the IPv6 flow label.
An SDF Filter may:
\- be a pattern for matching the IP 5 tuple (source IP address or IPv6 network
prefix, destination IP address or IPv6 network prefix, source port number,
destination port number, protocol ID of the protocol above IP). In the
pattern:
\- a value left unspecified in a filter matches any value of the corresponding
information in a packet;
\- an IP address may be combined with a prefix mask;
\- port numbers may be specified as port ranges;
\- the pattern can be extended by the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic
class (IPv6) and Mask;
\- consist of the destination IP address and optional mask, protocol ID of the
protocol above IP, the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and
Mask and the IPsec Security Parameter Index (SPI);
\- consist of the destination IP address and optional mask, the Type of
Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask and the Flow Label
(IPv6);
NOTE 1: The details about the IPsec Security Parameter Index (SPI), the Type
of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask and the Flow Label
(IPv6) are defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [19] clause 15.3.
\- extend the packet inspection beyond the possibilities described above and
look further into the packet. Such service data flow filters need to be
predefined in the PGW-U, as specified in clause 5.11 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
NOTE 2: Such filters may be used to support filtering with respect to a
service data flow based on the transport and application protocols used above
IP, e.g. for HTTP and WAP. Filtering for further application protocols and
services can also be supported.
The SDF Filter ID, when present, shall be encoded as an Unsigned32 binary
integer value. It shall uniquely identify an SDF Filter among all the SDF
Filters provisioned for a given PFCP Session. The source/destination IP
address and port information, in a bidirectional SDF Filter, shall be set as
for downlink IP flows. The SDF filter for the opposite direction has the same
parameters, but having the source and destination address/port parameters
swapped. When being provisioned with a bidirectional SDF filter in a PDR, the
UP function shall apply the SDF filter as specified in clause 5.2.1A.2A.
### 8.2.6 Application ID
The Application ID IE type shall be encoded as shown in Figure 8.2.6-1. It

Where FQ-CSID Node-ID Type values are:
0 indicates that Node-Address is a global unicast IPv4 address and p = 9.
1 indicates that Node-Address is a global unicast IPv6 address and p = 21.
2 indicates that Node-Address is a 4 octets long field with a 32 bit value
stored in network order, and p= 9. The coding of the field is specified below:
\- Most significant 20 bits are the binary encoded value of (MCC * 1000 \+
MNC).
\- Least significant 12 bits is a 12 bit integer assigned by an operator to an
MME, SGW-C, SGW-U, PGW-C, PGW-U, ePDG or TWAN.
Other values of Node-Address Type are reserved.
Values of Number of CSID greater than 1 shall only be employed in the PFCP
Session Deletion Request. The value 0 shall be used in a PFCP Session
Modification Request, with the FQ-CSID Node-ID Type and Node-Address fields
set to all zeros, and with the Node Type indicating one node type, to remove
an FQ-CSID previously provisioned for the PFCP session for the related node
type.
NOTE: The CP function can remove all the FQ-CSIDs for all node types
provisioned in the UP function for a given PFCP session by sending a PFCP
Session Modification Request with one FQ-CSID IE with a null length.
The node that creates the FQ-CSID (i.e. SGW-C for SGW-C FQ-CSID, PGW-C for
PGW-C FQâ€‘CSID and PGW-U or SGW-U for PGW-U/SGW-U FQâ€‘CSID) needs to ensure that
the Node-ID is globally unique and the CSID value is unique within that node.
The Node Type field in bits 1 to 4 of octet (q+2) shall be encoded as defined
in Table 8.2.43-2. Bits 5 to 8 of octet (q+2) shall be set to zero by the
sender and ignored by the receiver.

otherwise the IPv6 address field shall not be present.
\- Bit 2 -- V4: If this bit is set to \"1\", then the CHV4 bit sshall not be
set and the IPv4 address field shall be present in the UE IP Address,
otherwise the IPv4 address field shall not be present.
\- Bit 3 -- S/D: This bit is only applicable to the UE IP Address IE in the
PDI IE. It shall be set to \"0\" and ignored by the receiver in IEs other than
PDI IE. In the PDI IE, if this bit is set to \"0\", this indicates a Source IP
address; if this bit is set to \"1\", this indicates a Destination IP address.
\- Bit 4 -- IPv6D: This bit is only applicable to the UE IP address IE in the
PDI IE and when the V6 bit or CHV6 bit is set to \"1\". If this bit is set to
\"1\", then the IPv6 Prefix Delegation Bits field shall be present, otherwise
the UP function shall consider IPv6 prefix is default /64.
\- Bit 5 -- CHV4 (CHOOSE IPV4): If this bit is set to \"1\", then the V4 bit
shall not be set, the IPv4 address shall not be present and the UP function
shall assign an IPv4 address. This bit shall only be set by the CP function.
\- Bit 6 -- CHV6 (CHOOSE IPV6): If this bit is set to \"1\", then the V6 bit
shall not be set, the IPv6 address shall not be present and the UP function
shall assign an IPv6 address. This bit shall only be set by the CP function.
\- Bit 7 -- IP6PL (IPv6 Prefix Length): this bit is only applicable when the
V6 bit or CHV6 bit is set to \"1\" and the \"IPv6D\" bit is set to \"0\", for
an IPv6 prefix other than default /64, when the UP function supports the IP6PL
feature as specified in clause 8.2.25. If this bit is set to \"1\", then the
IPv6 Prefix Length field shall be present.
\- Bit 8 Spare, for future use and set to \"0\".
Octets \"m to (m+3)\" or \"p to (p+15)\" (IPv4 address / IPv6 address fields),

Octet r, if present, shall contain the number of bits allocated for IPv6
prefix delegation (relative to the default /64 IPv6 prefix), e.g. if /60 IPv6
prefix is used, the value shall be set to \"4\". When using UE IP address IE
in a PDI to match packets, the UP function shall only use the IPv6 prefix part
and ignore the interface identifier part. When the field is set to \"0\", the
UP function shall determine a value based on the local configuration.
The IPv6 Prefix Length in octet s, when present, shall be encoded as an 8 bits
binary integer, e.g. if /72 prefix is used, the value shall be set to to
(decimal) 72, or if /56 prefix is used, the value shall be set to (decimal)
56. The prefix length value \"128\" indicates an individual /128 IPv6 address.
When the field is set to \"0\", the UP function shall determine a value based
on the local configuration.

###### ## Annex A (Informative): PFCP Load and Overload Control Mechanism
# A.1 Throttling Aalgorithms
## A.1.1 \"Loss\" Throttling Algorithm
### A.1.1.1 Example of Possible Implementation
This clause provides an example of a possible implementation of the \"Loss\"
algorithm, amongst other possible methods.
It is possible to make use of a statistical loss function (e.g., random
selection of messages to throttle based on the indicated percentage) to decide
if the given message can be sent or need to be throttled. For example, the
source node generates a random number between (0, 100) for each message which
is a potential candidate for throttling. To realize 10% throttling, messages
with a random number 10 or less are throttled and hence this achieves
approximately a 10% reduction in the overall traffic. The actual traffic
reduction might vary slightly from the requested percentage, albeit by an
insignificant amount.
The algorithm can select certain messages to throttle in priority. For
example, implementations can distinguish between higher-priority and lower-
priority messages, and drop the lower-priority messages in favour of dropping
the higher priority messages, as long as the total reduction in traffic
conforms to the requested reduction in effect at the time. For example, in the
50-50 distribution of high priority and low priority messages, 20% reduction
to low priority messages and 0% reduction to high priority messages need to be
applied in order to achieve the effective reduction in traffic by 10% towards
the overloaded node.
###### ## Annex B (Normative): CP and UP Selection Functions with Control and
User Plane Separation
# B.1 CP Selection Function
## B.1.1 General
The SGW-C and PGW-C selection function shall follow the principles specified
in 3GPP TS 29.303 [25] for the SGW and PGW selection functions without Control
and User Plane Separation.
The following additional considerations apply with Control and User Plane
Separation:
1\. At most one SGW-C shall be selected per user at any time.
2\. The service area of an SGW-C function shall be aligned with the service
area of the corresponding SGW-U functions (see clause 4.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214
[2]. All the SGW-U functions in the service area shall have a full meshed
connectivity with all the eNBs of TAs and/or all RNCs/BSCs of RAs served by
that service area.
3\. The SGW dynamic load reported to the MME/SGSN and the PGW dynamic load
reported to the MME/SGSN or TWAN/ePDG should take into account the operating
status of the CP and UP functions\' resources that the SGW-C/PGW-C is
controlling. See clause 6.2.3 for how the CP function obtains load control
information from the UP function.
4\. For Dedicated Core Networks (see clause 5.8 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [25]), an
SGW-C or PGW-C function shall be declared in DNS as dedicated to certain
mapped UE usage types if the CP function or if all the UP functions it
controls are dedicated to certain mapped UE usage types. In this case, the CP
function shall be provisioned in DNS with all the mapped UE usage types that
both the CP function and its UP functions support.
5\. The MME/SGSN shall be able to select an SGW-C and a PGW-C optimized for
NR, e.g. for UEs indicating support of dual connectivity with NR in NAS
signalling to the MME or SGSN and without subscription restriction to use NR
as secondary RAT, according to the requirements specified in clause 5.12.2 of
3GPP TS 29.303 [25]. The SGW-C and the PGW-C optimized for NR may be a
combined SGW-C/PGW-C function optimized for the NR.
# B.2 UP Selection Function
## B.2.1 General
The following requirements apply for the selection of the UP function:
\- the SGW-C, PGW-C and TDF-C shall be responsible for the selection of the
SGW-U, PGW-U and TDF-U respectively;
\- an SGW-C may select different SGW-U functions for different PDN connections
of a same user.
It is implementation specific how to support the UP selection function
requirements specified in this clause. Clause B.2.6 specifies one possible
implementation.
## B.2.2 SGW-U Selection Function
The SGW-C shall be able to select the SGW-U considering the following
parameters:
\- the SGW-U location and the user \'s location (i.e. ECGI, eNodeB ID or TAI
for E-UTRAN, RAI or RNC-ID for UTRAN);
\- the SGW-U\'s capabilities and the capabilities required for the particular
UE session to establish;
\- the mapped UE Usage Type (when dedicating SGW-U to specific Dedicated Core
Networks);
\- the SGW-U\'s dynamic load;
\- the SGW-U\'s relative static capacity (versus other SGW-Us);
\- the UP Function Selection Information Flags, indicating whether it is
desired to select an SGW-U optimized for NR, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.274
[9].
Based on local policy, if the user\'s location information is required to be
used for selecting the UP function, the SGW-C shall determine the list of
candidate SGW-Us taking into account the user \'s location (ECGI, eNodeB ID or
TAI for E-UTRAN, RAI or RNC-ID for UTRAN).
The SGW-C shall select, among the candidate SGW-U functions, an SGW-U function
which supports all the capabilities required for the particular UE session,
considering the information received during the PFCP Association Setup.
## B.2.3 PGW-U Selection Function
The PGW-C shall be able to select the PGW-U considering the following
parameters:
\- the requested APN for the PDN connection;
\- the PGW-U location and the user \'s location;
\- the PGW-U\'s capabilities and the capabilities required for the particular
UE session to establish;
\- the mapped UE Usage Type (when dedicating PGW-U to specific Dedicated Core
Networks);
\- the PGW-U\'s dynamic load;
\- the PGW-U\'s relative static capacity (versus other PGW-Us);
\- whether a PDN connection already exists for the same UE and APN, in which
case the same PGW-U shall be selected (to enable APN-AMBR enforcement);
\- the UP Function Selection Information Flags, indicating whether it is
desired to select a PGW-U optimized for NR, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.274
[9].
NOTE: The SGW-U and PGW-U location can be configured in the SGW-C and PGW-C or
derived from DNS procedures as specified in clause B.2.2.
If the PGW-C already assigned a PGW-U to the UE for the requested APN (e.g. UE
with multiple PDN connections to the same APN), the PGW-C shall select the
same PGW-U for the new PDN connection.
If a non-null IPv4 address and/or a IPv6 prefix is received in the PDN Address
Allocation (PAA) IE in the Create Session Request, e.g. static address
assignment in the user subscription, the PGW-C shall select a PGW-U which can
support the requested UE\'s IP address and/or IPv6 prefix.
Otherwise, the PGW-C shall determine the list of candidate PGW-Us taking into
account the requested APN.
The PGW-C shall select, among the candidate PGW-U functions, a PGW-U function
which supports all the capabilities required for the particular UE session,
considering the information received during the PFCP Association Setup.
## B.2.4 Combined SGW-U/PGW-U Selection Function
A Combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall be able to select a combined SGW-U/PGW-U
function. This shall be possible for all the UE\'s PDN connections, as shown
in Figure B.2.1-1.
Figure B.2.4 -1: SGW-U/PGW-U colocation with Control and User Plane Separation
A combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall select the SGW-U and PGW-U as defined
respectively in B.2.2 and B.2.3, with the following additions:
\- the combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall select the best couple of SGW-U and
PGW-U (e.g. the combined SGW-U/PGW-U function), for the requested APN, among
all candidate couples of (SGW-U, PGW-U), instead of selecting independently
the SGW-U and the PGW-U.
## B.2.5 TDF-U selection function
The TDF-C shall be able to select the TDF-U as specified in clause 5.12.5 of
3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
## B.2.6 UP Selection Function Based on DNS
### B.2.6.1 General
This clause specifies optional DNS procedures to select the SGW-U and PGW-U
functions and the requirements which apply when these procedures are
supported.
The relative static capacity of an SGW-U and PGW-U may be configured in the
DNS.
The Node ID of an SGW-U and PGW-U may take the form of a canonical node name
to allow the selection of a SGW-U and PGW-U with the best topological match.
### B.2.6.2 SGW-U Selection Function Based on DNS
The SGW-C shall retrieve the list of candidate SGW-Us using DNS procedures
taking into account the user\'s location (ECGI, eNodeB ID or TAI for E-UTRAN,
RAI or RNC-ID for UTRAN), as specified in 3GPP TS 29.303 [25].
In non-roaming or LBO scenarios where the PGW-U is already selected (e.g. TAU
with SGW change) and when it is preferred to select a collocated node or a
topologically closer node, the SGW-C shall try to select an SGW-U collocated
with the PGW-U.
### B.2.6.3 PGW-U Selection Function Based on DNS
The PGW-C shall retrieve the list of candidate PGW-Us using DNS procedures
taking into account the requested APN, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.303 [25].
In non-roaming or LBO scenarios, when it is preferred to select a collocated
node or a topologically closer node, i.e. when such preference is indicated in
the canonical node names of the PGW-U functions in the DNS (using \"topon\" as
the first label of canonical node name), the PGW-C shall give precedence to
collocation of SGW-U and PGW-U, then to topological closeness (i.e. pairs of
SGW-U and PGW-U with canonical node names with the highest number of matching
labels). This requires the SGW-C to provide the SGW-U Node ID to the PGW-C.
### B.2.6.4 Combined SGW-U/PGW-U Selection Function Based on DNS
A combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall select the SGW-U and PGW-U as defined
respectively in B.2.4, B.2.6.2 and B.2.6.3.
###### ## Annex C (Informative): Examples scenarios
# C.1 General
This clause provides example call flows illustrating how the CP function can
provision the UP function to support certain functionalities.
This Annex is informative and the normative descriptions in this specification
and in 3GPP TS 23.214 [2] prevail over the descriptions in this Annex if there
is any difference.
# C.2 Charging Support
## C.2.1 Online Charging
### C.2.1.1 Online Charging Call Flow -- Normal Scenario
Figure C.2.1.1-1 illustrates the exchanges taking place over the Sxb or Sxc
reference points when applying online charging. In this example, the OCS
grants quotas by chunks of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request
new credits when the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes.
Figure C.2.1.1-1: Online charging with intermediate and final quotas
1\. Upon the request from the CP function, the OCS grants an intermediate
quota of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request a new credit when
the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes.
2\. The CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP
function with an Update URR IE including the Volume Threshold IE set to 90
Mbytes and the Volume Quota IE set to 100 Mbytes.
3\. Upon reaching the Volume Threshold (i.e. 90 Mbytes), the UP function sends
a PFCP Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE
including the Usage Report Trigger set to \"Volume Threshold\" and the Volume
Measurement set to 90 Mbytes. The UP function continues to pass on traffic
until reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. an extra 10 Mbytes of traffic can be
passed on).
4\. Upon the request from the CP function, the OCS grants a new intermediate
quota of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request a new credit when
the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes.
5\. The CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP
function with an Update URR IE including the Volume Threshold IE set to 90
Mbytes and the Volume Quota IE set to 100 Mbytes. If the UP function had
forwarded e.g. 5 Mbytes of traffic since the last usage report, the UP
function knows that it shall send the next usage report upon passing on an
extra 85 Mbytes of traffic.
6\. Upon reaching the Volume Threshold (i.e. 90 Mbytes), the UP function sends
a PFCP Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE
including the Usage Report Trigger set to \"Volume Threshold\" and the Volume
Measurement set to 90 Mbytes. The UP function continues to pass on traffic
until reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. an extra 10 Mbytes of traffic can be
passed on).
7\. Upon the request from the CP function, the OCS grants a new final quota of
50 Mbytes and requests the CP function to terminate the service or to redirect
the traffic towards a redirect destination when the quota is consumed.
8\. The CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP
function with an Update URR IE including the Volume Quota IE set to 50 Mbytes.
If the UP function had forwarded e.g. 5 Mbytes of traffic since the last usage
report, the UP function knows that it shall send the next usage report upon
passing on an extra 45 Mbytes of traffic.
9\. Upon reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. 50 Mbytes), the UP function sends a
PFCP Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE
including the Usage Report Trigger set to \"Volume Quota\" and the Volume
Measurement set to 50 Mbytes. The UP function stops passing on traffic.
10\. Upon being notified that the final quota has been reached, the CP
function terminates the service (e.g. by preventing the traffic of the
corresponding SDF to further pass on in the UP function) or redirects the
traffic towards a redirect destination by provisioning a Redirect Information
IE within the FAR associated to the traffic.
Figure C.2.1.1-2 illustrates the exchanges taking place over the Sxb or Sxc
reference points when applying online charging and the UP function supports
being provisioned with the Quota Action to apply when reaching quotas. This
example is similar to the previous one, but the CP function provisions the UP
function with the action to apply when reaching the final quota.
Figure C.2.1.1-2: Online charging with Quota Action provisioned in the UP
function
1 to 7\'. Same as for figure C.2.1.1-1.
8\. The CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP
function with a Create FAR IE provisioning the action the UP function shall
apply when reaching the quota, and with an Update URR IE including the Volume
Quota IE set to 50 Mbytes and the FAR ID for Quota Action IE set to the new
FAR ID). If the UP function had forwarded e.g. 5 Mbytes of traffic since the
last usage report, the UP function knows that it shall send the next usage
report upon passing on an extra 45 Mbytes of traffic.
9\. Upon reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. 50 Mbytes), the UP function sends a
PFCP Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE
including the Usage Report Trigger set to \"Volume Quota\" and the Volume
Measurement set to 50 Mbytes.
10\. The UP function applies the quota action provisioned at step 8, i.e. it
stops forwarding packets or it redirects the traffic towards a redirect
destination, according to the FAR identified in the FAR ID for Quota Action.
### C.2.1.2 Online Charging Call Flow with Credit Pooling
#### C.2.1.2.1 General
Figure C.2.1.2-1 illustrates a signalling flow over the Sxb and Gy reference
points when applying online charging, and when the CP function (i.e. PGW-C) is
instructed by the OCS to handle a Credit Pool for a given Gy Session.
#### C.2.1.2.2 Example Call Flow 1
In this example, the PGW-C is instructed by the OCS to handle a credit pool
for two Rating Groups, RG1 and RG2. The PGW-C provisions two URRs, URR1 and
URR2, for the two RGs respectively, and a URR3 for the Credit Pool. The PGW-C
provisions the URR1 and URR2 with the quota received from the OCS respectively
for RG1 and RG2 (like if there was no credit pooling).
This reflects one possible implementation option, whereby each quota remains
managed independently from the others. This approach can result in extra usage
reports being sent over Sxb for RG1 or RG2 before the credit pool is
exhausted.
Figure C.2.2.2-1: Online charging with Credit Pooling (alt 1)
> 1\. Upon the request from the CP function for RG1 and RG2, the OCS grants:
RG1: quota 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included
within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG1), where the G-S-U-Pool-
Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to
which the RG1 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for
which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the
multiplier (e.g. 0.1);
RG2: quotas 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included
within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG2), where the G-S-U-Pool-
Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to
which the RG2 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for
which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the
multiplier (e.g. 0.5);
2\. The CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP
function, to create:
A new URR1 for RG1, quota=100, Linked URR = URR3;\ A new URR2 for RG2,
quota=100, Linked URR = URR3;\ A new URR3 for Pool, quota = S = 100 x 0.1 +
100 x 0.5 = 60, Aggregated URRs: URR1 with Multiplier 0.1 and URR2 with
Multiplier 0.5.
The UP function accepts the request.
3\. The RG1 has consumed 100 counted by URR1, RG2 consumed 10 counted by URR2;
the URR3 for the Credit Pool counts U = 100 x 0.1 + 10 x 0.5 = 15 \= S = 60. So the UP function sends
a PFCP Session Report Request, including the Usage Reports for:\ \- the URR3,
generated due to reaching quota (60),\ \- for the URR1, generated due to that
it is linked to the URR3 and it has reached the quota 100, and\ \- for the
URR2 generated due to that it is linked to the URR3.\ The CP function sends
the response message.
11\. The CP function requests new Quota for RG1 and RG2 to the OCS. The OCS
grants 200M for RG1 and 100M for RG2, with the same pool ID and Multipliers.
12\. The CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP
function with the modified URRs, for URR1, URR2 and URR3.
#### C.2.1.2.3 Example Call Flow 2
In this example, the PGW-C is instructed by the OCS to handle a credit pool
for two Rating Groups, RG1 and RG2. The PGW-C provisions two URRs, URR1 and
URR2, for the two RGs respectively, and a URR3 for the Credit Pool. The PGW-C
provisions the quotas for URR1 and URR2 taking into account the credit pool
quota and the multipliers of the RGs.
This reflects another possible implementation option. This approach avoids
extra usage reports being sent over Sxb for RG1 or RG2 before the credit pool
is exhausted, and thus reduces Sxb signalling.
Figure C.2.2.3-2: Online charging with Credit Pooling (alt 2)
1\. Upon the request from the CP function for RG1 and RG2, the OCS grants:
RG1: quota 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included
within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG1), where the G-S-U-Pool-
Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to
which the RG1 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for
which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the
multiplier (e.g. 0.1);
RG2: quotas 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included
within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG2), where the G-S-U-Pool-
Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to
which the RG2 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for
which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the
multiplier (e.g. 0.5);
2\. The CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP
function, to create:
A new URR1 for RG1, quota=600, Linked URR = URR3;\ A new URR2 for RG2,
quota=120, Linked URR = URR3;\ And new URR3 for Pool, quota = S = 100 x 0.1 +
100 x 0.5 = 60, Aggregated URRs: URR1 with Multiplier 0.1 and URR2 with
Multiplier 0.5.
The UP function accepts the request.
NOTE 1: To avoid receiving usage report upon exceeding the original Quota for
RG1 or RG2, the quota can be set to 60 / 0.1 = 600 for RG1, assuming RG1
consumes the complete Quota for the pool; similarly, for RG2, the quota can be
set to 60 / 0.5 = 120;
3\. The URR3 always first reaches the Quota, e.g. when the URR1 has counted
400, and URR2 has counted 40, this results the counted usage for the Credit
Pool U=400 x 0.1 + 40 x 0.5 = 60. So the UP function sends a PFCP Session
Report Request, including the Usage Reports:
> \- for the URR3, generated due to that it has reached quota (60);\ \- for
> the URR1, generated due to that it is linked to the URR3; and\ \- for the
> URR2, generated due to that it is linked to the URR3.
>
> The CP function sends the response message.
4\. The CP function requests new Quota for RG1 and RG2 to the OCS. The OCS
grants 200M for RG1 and 100M for RG2, with the same pool ID and Multipliers.
5\. The CP function sends a PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP
function with the modified URRs, for URR1, URR2 and URR3.
URR1 for RG1, quota=70 / 0.1 = 700; \ URR2 for RG2, quota=70 / 0.5 = 140; \
URR3 for The Credit Pool, quota = 200 x 0.1 + 100 x 0.5 = 70.
###### ## Annex D (Normative): Use of PFCP over N16a for the support of
traffic offload by UPF controlled by I-SMF
# D.1 General
This Annex applies to PDU sessions involving an Intermediate SMF (I-SMF), when
the I-SMF has inserted an Uplink Classifier (UL CL) or Banching Point (BP)
into the data path of the PDU session and a local PDU Session Anchor (PSA)
further called PSA2 in this Annex, for local traffic offload.
For such PDU sessions, PFCP session related messages shall be exchanged
between the SMF and I-SMF for:
\- the SMF to provide N4 information to the I-SMF regarding how the traffic
shall be detected, enforced and monitored in the UPF(s) controlled by the
I-SMF;
\- the I-SMF to forward N4 information with traffic usage reporting to the
SMF.
See clause 5.34.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
Whether the UL CL or BP and PSA2 are supported by the same UPF or not shall be
transparent to the SMF.
When exchanging N4 information over N16a, the SMF and I-SMF shall assume the
model in Figure D.1-1 where the UL CL or BP and PSA2 are supported by separate
UPFs, i.e. separate PFCP session related messages shall be exchanged over N4
for the UL CL/BP and for the PSA2.
NOTE 1: This allows the SMF and I-SMF to exchange unambiguous information on
whether N4 information exchanged over N16a relates to the UL CL/BP or the
PSA2, e.g. whether a QER is to be enforced in the UL CL/BP or PSA2.
NOTE 2: The UL CL/BP and PSA2 inserted by the I-SMF can be co-located or
located on different UPFs, regardless of the model assumed over N16a for the
exchange of N4 information.
NOTE 3: Only one local PSA (i.e. PSA2) is shown in this figure; in real
deployment, more than one local PSAs can be inserted.
Figure D.1-1: UL CL/BP and PSA2 model for N4 information exchanged over N16a
The I-SMF shall translate the N4 information received from the SMF into
appropriate N4 rules towards the UL CL/BP and the PSA2; the I-SMF shall merge
the N4 information received for the UL CL/BP and the PSA2 if the UL CL/BP and
PSA2 are located on the same UPF.
The N4 information exchanged over N16a shall only include the rules related to
the UL and DL traffic to offload via PSA2, and not include the rules to the
non-offload UL and DL traffic via PSA1. The I-SMF shall generate on its own N4
rules towards the UL CL/BP for UL and DL traffic exchanged between the AN and
PSA1. The PDR, FAR, URR, QER ID(s) allocated by the I-SMF and the SMF for the
PFCP sessions between I-SMF and UL CL and between I-SMF and PSA2 shall be
distinct; the Precedence of the PDRs set by the I-SMF and the SMF shall also
be distinct (see clause D.2.1).
All the PFCP session related messages specified in clause 7.5 shall be
supported over N16a. Unless specified otherwise in this Annex, the
requirements specified in the rest of this specification for PFCP session
related procedures and messages are also applicable to N16a.
None of the PFCP Node related messages specified in clause 7.4 shall be sent
over N16a. PFCP Load and Overload control information shall not be exchanged
over N16a.
Data forwarding procedures (see clause 5.3) shall not be used over N16a.
PFCP session related messages shall be sent over N16a in a binary body part of
an HTTP multipart message using the Nsmf_PDUSession as specified in 3GPP TS
29.502 [50]. The Json body part of a HTTP multipart message shall indicate
whether a given PFCP session related message relates to the UL CL/BP or to the
PSA2. Presence of the DNAI IE indicates the PFCP session message relates to
PSA2 and absence of the DNAI IE indicates the PFCP session message relates to
UL CL/BP.
# D.2 Procedures
## D.2.1 Addition of PSA and UL CL/BP controlled by I-SMF
The corresponding stage 2 call flow is specified in clause 4.23.9.1 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [29].
When the I-SMF decides to select a new PSA2 and/or a UL CL/BP (replacing the
current I-UPF) for the PDU session, e.g. using the list of DNAI(s) of interest
for this PDU Session received from the SMF, it shall establish PFCP sessions
towards UL CL/BP and/or PSA2 respectively.
The I-SMF shall allocate PDR/FAR/URR/QER ID not larger than 255 and shall set
Precedence value not smaller than 65536. The SMF shall allocate
PDR/FAR/URR/QER ID from 256 onwards and shall set Precedence value not larger
than 65535.
NOTE 1: Since PDRs provided by the SMF to control the traffic via PSA2 have
higher precedence than PDRs generated by the I-SMF, the I-SMF need not modify
the PDRs generated by its own. See the example further down.
For the PFCP session established between I-SMF and UL CL/BP:
\- the I-SMF shall create at least a UL PDR to identify the UL traffic
received from AN and a UL FAR to forward the traffic towards PSA1;
\- the I-SMF shall create a DL PDR to identify the DL traffic from the PSA1
and a DL FAR to forward the traffic towards the AN;
NOTE 2: The I-SMF needs to include DL N9 F-TEID in the SMF PDUSession Update
Request sent to SMF as specified in 3GPP TS 29.502 [50].
For the PFCP session established between I-SMF and PSA2:
\- the I-SMF shall create at least an UL PDR to identify the UL traffic
received from UL CL/BP and a UL FAR to forward the traffic towards the DN;
\- the I-SMF shall create a DL PDR to identify the DL traffic from the DN and
a DL FAR to forward the traffic towards the UL CL/BP;
NOTE 3: If IPv6 multi-homing applies to the PDU session, a new IPv6 prefix can
be allocated by the PSA2, which is sent in SMF PDUSession Update Request to
SMF.
Upon successful establishment of the PFCP sessions, the I-SMF indicates to the
SMF that it has inserted an UL CL/BP and PSA by sending a SMF PDUSession
Update Request to the SMF (see step 4 clause 4.23.9.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29]).
When the I-SMF indicates to the SMF that it has inserted an UL CL/BP and PSA,
the SMF shall send two PFCP Session Establishment Requests towards the I-SMF,
one targeting the UL CL/BP and another one targeting the PSA2, with the
following information:
1) PFCP Session Establishment Request for the UL CL/BP:
\- For the support of the UL traffic offloaded towards PSA2:
\- one Create Traffic Endpoint IE, just including a Traffic EndPoint ID; the
UL traffic endpoint corresponds to the N3 endpoint of UL CL/BP; the UL traffic

I-SMF, the UL FAR shall indicate the Data Network Access Identifier associated
to the local PSA towards which the UL traffic shall be forwarded; the UL FAR
may do so otherwise.
\- For the support of the DL traffic offloaded from PSA2:
\- one Create Traffic Endpoint IE, including a Traffic EndPoint ID; the DL
traffic endpoint shall not contain information about the N9 interface, i.e.

\- the Source Interface set to \"Core\";
\- the Traffic Endpoint IE referring to the DL traffic endpoint;
\- any applicable PDR information, e.g. FAR ID, URR ID, QER ID;
\- one DL FAR set to forward (or drop) the DL traffic to the access network,
with the Destination Interface set to \"Access\"; the DL FAR shall not contain

Interface set to \"Core\".
\- For the support of the DL traffic offloaded at PSA2:
\- one Create Traffic Endpoint IE, including a Traffic EndPoint ID and any
additional information to define the DL traffic endpoint (e.g. Network
Instance IE, UE IP Address IE); the DL traffic endpoint corresponds to the N6
endpoint of PSA2;
\- at least one Create PDR IE with:
\- the Source Interface set to \"Core\";
\- the Traffic Endpoint IE referring to the DL traffic endpoint;
\- any additional Packet Detection Information to define the DL traffic to
match (e.g. SDF Filter, Application ID, Ethernet Packet Filter);

NOTE: The I-SMF is responsible for all the N3 and N9 protocol aspects (e.g.
Network Instance, Local F-TEID, outer header creation or removal).
\- Any applicable QERs and/or URRs.
In the PFCP Session Establishment Request for the UL CL/BP, the SMF shall not
include any N4 rules for the UL and DL traffic via PSA1 (i.e. non-offload
traffic exchanged between AN and PSA1).
The I-SMF shall translate the SMF instructions into N4 instructions to send to
the UL CL/BP and PSA2, for the UL and DL traffic in one or more PFCP Session
Modification Request message(s) (the I-SMF has already created a PFCP session
in the UL CL/BO and PSA2 in steps 2 and 3 of Figure 4.23.9.1-1 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [29]). In particular:
\- the I-SMF shall map the UL and DL traffic endpoints requested to be created
by the SMF in the UL CL/BP and PSA2 respectively to the UL and DL traffic
endpoints created in the UL CL/BP and in PSA2 for UL and DL traffic; the I-SMF
shall update the DL traffic endpoint in PSA2 if necessary, e.g. with any
Framed-Route or Framed-IPv6-Route information received from the SMF;
\- the I-SMF shall add the Outer Header Removal IE to the UL PDR of the UL
CL/BP;
\- the I-SMF shall add an Outer Header Creation IE to DL PDR(s) of the UL
CL/BP to add a GTP-U header set to the 5G-AN F-TEID, and to add a Network
Instance IE if needed;
\- the I-SMF shall update the UL FAR of the UL CL/BP and the DL FAR of the
PSA2 with N9 protocol information, if the UL CL/BP and PSA2 are located on
different UPFs; if more than one local PSA has been inserted by the I-SMF, the
I-SMF shall derive the local PSA towards which the UL traffic shall be
forwarded from the Data Network Access Identifier IE indicated in the UL FAR
over N16a.
\- the I-SMF shall overwrite the Apply Action IE of the DL FAR received from
the SMF according to the User Plane connection state of the PDU session, e.g.
to request the UPF to buffer packets if the PDU session is deactivated, or to
forward the DL packets otherwise;
\- the I-SMF shall merge the N4 information received for the UL CL/BP and the
PSA2 if the UL CL/BP and PSA2 are located on the same UPF.
The I-SMF shall return two PFCP Session Establishment Response messages to the
SMF for UL CL/BP and PSA2 respectively. In the PFCP Session Establishment
Response messages, the I-SMF may set the Node ID IE and UP F-SEID IE to the
ones provided by the UL CL/BP and the PSA2. The Created PDR and Created
Traffic Endpoint shall not be included.
The I-SMF shall generate by itself the N4 rules to control the UL and DL
traffic via PSA1 (i.e. non-offload traffic exchanged between AN and PSA1), and
send such N4 rules to the UL CL/BP together with the N4 rules mapped from the
N4 information sent by the SMF.
EXAMPLE: Example of addition of PSA2 and UL CL controlled by I-SMF:
1) in step 3 of clause 4.23.9.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29], when establishing the
PFCP session between I-SMF and UL CL/BP, the I-SMF can provide the following
PDRs/FARs to the UL CL/BP:
UL PDR1 (UL F-TEID 1 is allocated to receive UL traffic from NG-RAN ) and\ UL
FAR1 (forward all traffic towards PSA1);
DL PDR2 (N9 DL F-TEID is allocated to receive DL traffic from PSA1 which will
be reported in SMF PDUSession Update Request towards SMF) and\ DL FAR2
(forward all traffic towards NG-RAN N3 F-TEID).
2) in step 2 of clause 4.23.9.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29], when establishing the
PFCP session between I-SMF and PSA2, the I-SMF can provide the following
PDRs/FARs to PSA2:
UL PDR1 (to receive traffic from UL CL, i.e. including the UL F-TEID of UL CL)
and\ UL FAR1 (forward all traffic towards DN);
DL PDR2 (to receive traffic from DN) and\ DL FAR2 (forward all traffic towards
UL CL\'s N9 DL F-TEID).
3) in step 6 of clause 4.23.9.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29], the SMF sends an SMF
PDUSession Update Request to the I-SMF encapsulating binary encoded PFCP
Session Establishment Request messages to request to offload service traffic
towards PSA2, e.g. for a service which is identified by app-id 100;
In the PFCP Session Establishment Request message for PSA2, the SMF includes:
UL PDR 256 (where the PDI includes app-id =100) and\ UL FAR 256 (forward all
traffic towards DN);\ \ DL PDR 257 (sending traffic to UL CL, where the PDI
includes app-id=100) and\ DL FAR 257 (sending traffic to UL CL).
In the PFCP Session Establishment Request message for UL CL, the SMF includes:
UL PDR 256 (where the PDI includes app-id =100) and\ UL FAR 256 (forward
traffic towards PSA2);\ \ DL PDR 257 (identifying all traffic received from
PSA2) and\ DL FAR 257 (forward traffic toward access);
4) in step 7 of clause 4.23.9.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29], the I-SMF maps rules
received in 3) in the PFCP Session Modification Request message to the PSA2,
and the PDR1 and PDR2 provisioned earlier by I-SMF during the PFCP session
establishment procedure will not be matched for the application traffic
identified by app-id 100 due to a lower precedence.
5) in step 8 of clause 4.23.9.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29], the I-SMF can maps
rules received in 3) in the PFCP Session Modification Request message to the
UL CL, the PDR1 (forwarding all traffic to PSA1) provisioned earlier by I-SMF
during the PFCP session establishment procedure will not be matched for the
application traffic identified by app-id 100 due to a lower precedence.
## D.2.2 Removal of PSA and UL CL/BP
The corresponding stage 2 call flow is specified in clause 4.23.9.2 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [29].
When the I-SMF indicates to the SMF that it is removing a UL CL/BP and PSA,
the SMF shall send two PFCP Session Deletion Requests towards the I-SMF, one
for the UL CL/BP and another one for the PSA2. The I-SMF shall return two PFCP
Session Deletion Responses to the SMF (including usage reports if applicable,
see clause 7.5.7.1).
## D.2.3 Change of PSA
The corresponding stage 2 call flow is specified in clause 4.23.9.3 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [29].
When the I-SMF indicates to the SMF a change of traffic offload, the SMF shall
send a PFCP Session Establishment Request (for the new DNAI), a PFCP Session
Deletion Request (for the old DNAI) towards the I-SMF, and a PFCP Session
Modification Request for the UL CL/BP if needed. The I-SMF shall behave as
described in clauses D.2.1 and D.2.2 and return a PFCP Session Establishment
Response, a PFCP Session Deletion Response and a PFCP Session Modification
Response if needed.
## D.2.4 Traffic Usage Reporting
The SMF may request the I-SMF to report traffic usage measurements as
specified in the rest of this specification.
The I-SMF shall report traffic usage measurements to the SMF as specified in
the rest of this specification, i.e. in PFCP Session Report Request, PFCP
Session Modification Response and PFCP Session Deletion Response messages.
## D.2.5 Updating N4 information towards I-SMF
The SMF may send PFCP Session Modification Requests with updated PFCP rules
(e.g. updated PDR, QER URR), targeting the UL CL/BP or PSA2, as specified in
the rest of this specification. The I-SMF shall return PFCP Session
Modification Responses accordingly.
## D.2.6 PDU session release
Corresponding stage 2 requirements are specified in clauses 4.23.3a and
4.23.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].
If an UL/CL or BP was inserted in the data path by the I-SMF:
\- In scenarios where the I-SMF sends a Release Request to the SMF, e.g. UE
deregistration procedure, the I-SMF shall first send a PFCP Session Deletion
Request to the UL CL/BP and local PSA to retrieve non-zero traffic usage
reports, before sending the Release Request over N16a to the SMF. If the I-SMF
needs to report traffic usage measurements to the SMF for the UL CL/BP and/or
for the local PSA, the I-SMF shall encapsulate one PFCP Session Report Request
for the UL CL/BP and/or one PFCP Session Report Request for the local PSA in
the Release Request sent over N16a to the SMF. The SMF shall encapsulate
corresponding PFCP Session Report Response(s) in the Release Response.\ \ If
more traffic usage measurements need to be reported to the SMF, the I-SMF
shall send one or more Update Request(s) towards the SMF before sending a
Release Request.\ \ Upon receiving the Release Request from the I-SMF, the SMF
shall consider that the PFCP sessions between the I-SMF and UL CL/BP and local
PSA have been deleted.
\- In scenarios where the I-SMF sends an Update Request to the SMF, e.g. UE
initiated PDU session release, if the I-SMF needs to report traffic usage
measurements to the SMF for the UL CL/BP and/or for the local PSA, the I-SMF
may encapsulate one PFCP Session Report Request for the UL CL/BP and/or one
PFCP Session Report Request for the local PSA in the Update Request sent over
N16a to the SMF (i.e. in step 3a of Figure 4.3.4.3-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29])).
If so, the SMF shall encapsulate corresponding PFCP Session Report Response(s)
in the Update Response.\ \ The SMF shall then send two PFCP Session Deletion
Requests towards the I-SMF, one for the UL CL/BP and another one for the local
PSA, in the subsequent Update Request initiated by the SMF towards the I-SMF
to trigger the release of the PDU session (i.e. in step 3a of Figure 4.3.4.3-1
of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29]). The I-SMF shall encapsulate corresponding PFCP
Session Deletion Response(s) in the Update Response (i.e. in step 14 of Figure
4.3.4.3-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29]), including usage reports if applicable, see
clause 7.5.7.1. The PFCP Session Deletion Response may indicate that
additional usage reports need to be signalled; if so, the I-SMF shall send
additional Update Request(s) towards the SMF encapsulating PFCP Session Report
Requests and the SMF shall return Update Response (s) encapsulating PFCP
Session Report Responses. When the last usage report has been received, the
SMF shall notify the I-SMF that the PDU session is released (in step 16a of
Figure 4.3.4.3-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29]).
###### ## Annex E (Informative): Procedures Related to MPTCP Functionality
# E.1 General
This clause provides example MPTCP flows.
This Annex is informative and the normative descriptions in this specification
and in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28], 3GPP TS 23.502 [29] and in 3GPP TS 24.193 [59],
prevail over the descriptions in this Annex if there is any difference.
# E.2 Multipath TCP Connection Setup
## E.2.1 General
Multipath TCP Connection is setup between the MPTCP Client in the UE and the
MPTCP Proxy in the UPF (PSA). The outgoing Multipath is initiated by the MPTCP
Client in the UE towards the MPTCP Proxy in the UPF.
NOTE: The incoming Multipath which is assumed to be initiated by the MPTCP
Proxy in the UPF towards the MPTCP Client in the UE is not supported in this
release of the specification.
The RTT TCP Convert Protocol (specified in IETF RFC 8803 [60]) is used to
setup Multipath TCP connection and used for data exchange. The MPTCP Proxy
implements the Transport Converter functionality.
## E.2.2 Outgoing Multipath TCP Connection Setup
Figure E.2.2-1 describes the establishment of an outgoing multipath TCP
connection through a Transport Converter.
The MPTCP Client initiates a Multipath TCP connection towards the Transport
Converter, by sending a SYN with the MP_CAPABLE option (MPC in Figure
E.2.2-1). The SYN includes the address and port number of the Server (i.e.
remote host), that are extracted by the Transport Converter and used to
initiate a Multipath TCP connection towards this Server. As the Server does
not support Multipath TCP, it replies with a SYN+ACK that does not contain the
MP_CAPABLE option. The Transport Converter notes that the connection with the
Server does not support Multipath TCP and returns the extended TCP header
received from the Server to the Client.
Figure E.2.2-1 -- Outgoing Converter-Assisted Multipath TCP Connection Setup
## E.2.3 Incoming Multipath TCP Connection Setup
Incoming Multipath TCP Connection Setup as described in clause 5.2 of IETF RFC
8803 [60] is not supported in this release of the specification.
## E.2.4 MPTCP Session Entry Stored in MPTCP Proxy
Once Multipath TCP Connection is successfully setup between the MPTCP Client
in the UE and the MPTCP Proxy in the UPF, the MPTCP Proxy stores the MPTCP
session entry in its storage.
The MPTCP session entry includes the following information:
\- UE link-specific multipath IP address and its TCP port;
\- UE\'s MA-PDU session IP address and its TCP port, if the MA-PDU session IP
address is used by MPTCP Proxy for IP translation;
\- N6 routable IP address and its TCP port, if N6 routable IP address is used
by the MPTCP Proxy for IP translation;
\- the remote host IP address and its TCP port.
The stored MPTCP session entry is used by the MPTCP Proxy for IP translation
when receiving uplink or downlink MPTCP traffic.
# E.3 IP Translation Procedure
## E.3.1 General
On receiving uplink or downlink MPTCP traffic, the UPF internally forwards the
MPTCP traffic to the MPTCP Proxy. The MPTCP Proxy detects the MPTCP traffic is
for data exchange, and performs IP translation before sending out the
translated MPTCP traffic.
Figure E.3.1-1 illustrates the IP translation model for uplink and downlink
MPTCP traffics, both on the UE side and the UPF side.
Figure E.3.1-1 IP Translation Model
When UE\'s MA-PDU session IP address is used by MPTCP Proxy for IP
translation, port collision and port exhaustion can potentially occur because
the UE also uses the MA-PDU session IP address for non-MPTCP traffic. To avoid
this, a N6 routable IP address can be used by the MPTCP Proxy for IP
translation, based on the UPF implementation.
## E.3.2 IP Translation on Uplink IP Packets
Once uplink MPTCP traffic is detected by the UPF, the UPF internally forwards
the uplink IP packets to the MPTCP Proxy.
The MPTCP Proxy performs IP translation to the uplink IP packets, based on the
stored MPTCP session entry:
\- replace the source IP address and port, from the UE link-specific multipath
IP@ and its port, to the UE\'s MA-PDU session IP@ and its port (or N6 routable
IP@ and its port);
\- replace the destination IP address and port, from the MPTCP Proxy IP@ and
its port, to the remote host IP@ and its port.
After performing IP translation, the MPTCP Proxy forwards the translated
uplink IP packets to N6 interface.
## E.3.3 IP Translation on Downlink IP Packets
Once downlink MPTCP traffic is detected by the UPF, the UPF internally
forwards the downlink IP packets to the MPTCP Proxy.
The MPTCP Proxy performs IP translation to the downlink IP packets, based on
the stored MPTCP session entry:
\- replace the source IP address and port, from the remote host IP@ and its
port, to the MPTCP Proxy IP@ and its port;
\- replace the destination IP address and port, from the UE\'s MA-PDU session
IP@ and its port (or N6 routable IP@ and its port), to the UE link-specific
multipath IP@ and its port.
After performing IP translation, the MPTCP Proxy forwards the translated
downlink IP packets to N3 or N9 interface.
