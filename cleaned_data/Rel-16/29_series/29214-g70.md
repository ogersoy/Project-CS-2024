# 1 Scope
The present document provides the stage 3 specification of the Rx reference
point for the present release. The functional requirements and the stage 2
specifications of the Rx reference point are contained in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2].
The Rx reference point lies between the Application Function (AF) and the
Policy and Charging Rule Function (PCRF). In the 5GS the Rx reference point
resides between the AF and the Policy Control Function (PCF) as specified in
3GPP TS 23.501 [55] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [56].
NOTE: Interactions between the PCF and the AF using the 5GS
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service (the N5 reference point) are defined in 3GPP
TS 29.514 [57].
The Rx interface which is based on RESTful HTTP and XML is specified in 3GPP
TS 29.201 [37].
Whenever it is possible the present document specifies the requirements for
the protocol by reference to specifications produced by the IETF within the
scope of Diameter. Where this is not possible, extensions to Diameter are
defined within the present document.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply:
**Application Function (AF):** element offering application(s) that use IP
bearer resources
NOTE: One example of an AF is the P-CSCF of the IM CN subsystem.
**AF Session:** application level session established by an application level
signalling protocol offered by the AF that requires a session set-up with
explicit session description before the use of the service.
NOTE: One example of an application session is an IMS session.
**Attribute-Value Pair (AVP):** See ETF RFC 6733 [52], corresponds to an
Information Element in a Diameter message.
**Binding:** PCRF process of associating IP flows described in AF Service
Information with IP-CAN bearers.
**Bit rate:** The number of bits (denoted in units of bits, kbits, etc.) that
are conveyed or processed per unit of time. The bit rate in bit/s can be
abbreviated with bps. This specification uses SI (International System of
Units) prefixes as unit prefixes, which strictly refer to the power of 10, and
shall not be used for the power of 2. For example, 1 kbit/s represents 1000
bit/s or 1 Mbit/s represents 1000 kbit/s and so on.
**IP-CAN bearer:** IP transmission path of defined capacity, delay and bit
error rate, etc.\ See 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] for the definition of bearer.
**IP-CAN session:** association between a UE and an IP network (for GPRS,
APN).\ The association is identified by one UE Ipv4 address and/or one Ipv6
prefix together with a UE identity information, if available, and a PDN
represented by a PDN ID (e.g. an APN). An IP-CAN session incorporates one or
more IP-CAN bearers. Support for multiple IP-CAN bearers per IP-CAN session is
IP-CAN specific. An IP-CAN session exists as long as the related UE Ipv4
address and/or Ipv6 prefix are assigned and announced to the IP network.
**IP flow:** unidirectional flow of IP packets with the same source IP address
and port number and the same destination IP address and port number and the
same transport protocol\ Port numbers are only applicable if used by the
transport protocol.
**MPS session:** A session for which priority treatment is applied for
allocating and maintaining radio and network resources to support the
Multimedia Priority Service (MPS). MPS is defined in 3GPP TS 22.153 [31].
**Packet flow:** A specific user data flow carried through the PCEF. A packet
flow can be an IP flow.
**PCC rule:** set of information enabling the detection of a service data flow
and providing parameters for policy control and/or charging control.
**RESTful HTTP:** is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set of
architectural constraints applied to components, connectors, and data
elements, within a distributed hypermedia system applied to the development of
web services.
**Restricted local operator services** : communication services provided by an
operator that involve either automated or human assistance (e.g. credit card
billing, directory assistance, customer care) for which successful
authentication is not necessary.
**service information: set of information conveyed from the AF to the PCRF
over the Rx interface to** be used as a basis for PCC decisions **at the PCRF,
including information about the AF session (e.g. application identifier, type
of media, bandwidth, IP address and port number).**
**service data flow:** An aggregate set of packet flows.

# 4 Rx reference point
## 4.1 Overview
The Rx reference point is used to exchange application level session
information:
\- and the Application Function (AF); and
\- in the 5GS, between the Policy Control Function (PCF) between
the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) and the Application Function
(AF). As defined in the stage 2 specifications (3GPP TS 23.203 [2]), this
information is part of the input used by the PCRF for the Policy and Charging
Control (PCC) decisions. The PCRF exchanges the PCC rules with the Policy and
Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) and QoS rules with the Bearer Binding and
Event Reporting Function (BBERF) as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
Policy and Charging Control over Rx interface in the 5GS is specified in annex
E.
Signalling flows related to the both Rx and Gx interfaces are specified in
3GPP TS 29.213 [9].
Refer to Annex G of 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] for Diameter overload control
procedures over the Rx interface.
Refer to Annex J of 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] for Diameter message priority mechanism
procedures over the Rx interface.
Refer to Annex K of 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] for Diameter load control procedures
over the Rx interface.
## 4.2 Rx reference model
The Rx reference point is defined between the PCRF and the AF. The
relationships between the different functional entities involved are depicted
in figure 4.2.1. The overall PCC architecture is depicted in subclause 3a of
3GPP TS 29.213 [9].
Figure 4.2.1: Rx reference model
Figure 4.2.2: Void
## 4.3 Functional elements
### 4.3.1 AF
The AF is an element offering applications that require the Policy and
Charging Control of traffic plane resources (e.g. UMTS PS domain/GPRS domain
resources). One example of an application function is the P-CSCF. The AF shall
use the Rx reference point to provide session information to the PCRF.
NOTE: The AFs may be deployed by the same operator offering the IP-CAN or may
be provided by external third party service provider.
### 4.3.2 PCRF
The PCRF (Policy Control and Charging Rules Function) is a functional element
that encompasses policy control decision and flow based charging control
functionalities. These 2 functionalities are the heritage of the release 6
logical entities PDF and CRF respectively. The PCRF provides network control
regarding the service data flow detection, gating, QoS and flow based charging
(except credit management) towards the PCEF. The PCRF receives session and
media related information from the AF and informs AF of traffic plane events.
The PCRF may check that the service information provided by the AF is
consistent with the operator defined policy rules before storing the service
information. The service information shall be used to derive the QoS for the
service. The PCRF may reject the request received from the AF and as a result
the PCRF shall indicate, in the response to the AF, the service information
that can be accepted by the PCRF.
The PCRF may temporarily not be able to provide the service delivery that AF
requested (e.g. due to RAN user plane congestion). In this case, the PCRF may
send a re-try interval information to the AF. The re-try interval indicates
when service delivery may be retried by the AF over Rx.
NOTE 1: Additionally, existing bandwidth limitation parameters (e.g. Max-
Requested-Bandwidth-DL AVP, Max-Requested-Bandwidth-UL AVP within the
Acceptable-Service-Info AVP) provided by the PCRF to the AF in AA-Answer
command during the Rx session establishment are available in order to mitigate
RAN user plane congestion.
The PCRF may use the subscription information as basis for the policy and
charging control decisions. The subscription information may apply for both
session based and non-session based services. _The subscription specific
information for each service may contain e.g. max QoS class and max bit rate._
If the AF requests it, the PCRF shall report IP-CAN session events (including
bearer events and events on AF signalling transport) to the AF via the Rx
reference point.
The PCRF PCC/QoS Rule decisions may be based on one or more of the following:
\- the session and media related information obtained from the AF via the Rx
reference point;
\- the bearer and subscriber related information obtained from the PCEF over
the Gx reference point;
\- the bearer and subscriber related information obtained from the BBERF over
the Gxx reference point;
\- subscriber and service related data the PCRF may be aware of by
configuration or through the Sp reference point;
\- pre-configured information in the PCRF.
NOTE 2: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified
in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
The PCRF shall provision PCC/QoS Rules to the PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx
reference point.
## 4.4 PCC procedures over Rx reference point
### 4.4.1 Initial Provisioning of Session Information
When a new AF session is being established and media information for this AF
session is available at the AF and the related media require PCC supervision,
the AF shall open an Rx Diameter session with the PCRF for the AF session
using an AA-Request command, unless an Rx session has already been established
for the AF session (e.g. as per clause 4.4.6.7). If an Rx Diameter session
already exists for the AF session, the AF uses the existing Rx Diameter
session. The AF shall provide the full IP address of the UE using either
Framed-IP-Address AVP or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP, and the corresponding Service
Information within Media-Component-Description AVP(s). The AF shall not
include circuit-switched bearer related media in the service information sent
to the PCRF. The AF shall indicate to the PCRF as part of the Media-Component-
Description whether the media IP flow(s) should be enabled or disabled with
the Flow-Status AVP.
NOTE 1: The AF does not need to open an Rx Diameter session with the PCRF, if
the SDP payload is only proposing to use a circuit-switched bearer (i.e.
\"c=\" line set to \"PSTN\" and an \"m=\" line set to \"PSTN\", refer to 3GPP
TS 24.292 [26]).
NOTE 2: The Rx Diameter session used for an AF session is different from the
Rx Diameter session possibly used for the notifications of the status of the
AF signalling transmission path. A new Rx Diameter session is established for
each new AF session.
The AF may include the AF-Application-Identifier AVP into the AA-Request in
order to indicate the particular service that the AF session belongs to. This
AVP can be provided at both AF session level, and Media-Component-Description
level. When provided at both levels, the AF-Application Identifier provided
within the Media-Component-Description AVP will have precedence. The AF may
also include an AF application identifier within the AF-Application-Identifier
AVP at the AF session level to trigger the PCRF to indicate to the PCEF/TDF to
perform the application detection based on the operator's policy as defined in
3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The AF may include the AF-Charging-Identifier AVP into the AA-Request for
charging correlation purposes. The AF may also include the Specific-Action AVP
to request notification for certain user plane events, e.g. bearer
termination.
The AF may include the Service-URN AVP in order to indicate that the new AF
session relates to emergency or RLOS traffic and additionally it may include
the AF-Requested-Data AVP to indicate the information required by the AF. If
the PCRF receives the Service-URN AVP indicating an emergency session, the
PCRF may apply special policies, for instance prioritising service flows
relating to the new AF session or allowing these service flows free of charge.
If the Service-URN AVP indicates that the new AF session relates to emergency
traffic and the AF-Requested-Data AVP is received, the PCRF shall provide the
requested available user information as part of the AA-Answer command.
The AF may include the MPS-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the new AF
session relates to an MPS session. If the PCRF receives the MPS-Identifier AVP
indicating an MPS session, the PCRF may take specific actions on the
corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the MPS session is prioritized as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. For Multimedia Priority Sevice handling, see
Annex A.9.
The AF may include the MCPTT-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the new
AF session relates to an MCPTT session with priority call. If the PCRF
receives the MCPTT-Identifier AVP related to that MCPTT session, the PCRF may
take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the MCPTT
session is prioritized. For the handling of MCPTT session with priority call,
see Annex A.13.
The AF may include the MCVideo-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the
new AF session relates to an MCVideo session with priority call. If the PCRF
receives the MCVideo-Identifier AVP related to that MCVideo session, the PCRF
may take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the
MCVideo session is prioritized. For the handling of MCVideo session with
priority call, see Annex A.15.
If the QoSHint feature is supported by the AF, the AF may include the Desired-
Max-Latency AVP and/or Desired-Max-Loss AVP within the Media-Component-
Description AVP to indicate to the PCRF that the related application media has
specific latency and/or loss demands.
The AF may include the FLUS-Identifier AVP within the Media-Component-
Description AVP in order to indicate to the PCRF that the media flow(s)
correspond to a FLUS media stream. Additional QoS information for the
treatment of FLUS media may be provided within Desired-Max-Latency AVP and/or
Desired-Max-Loss AVP.
The AF may include the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to
PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED within the Media-Component-Description AVP in order
to indicate to the PCRF that the related media flow is allowed to use the same
Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) as media flows belonging to other AF
sessions as described in subclause 4.4.8. In this case, if the MCPTT-
Preemption is supported, the AF may also include the Pre-emption-Capability
AVP containing the suggested pre-emption capability value and the Pre-emption-
Vulnerability AVP containing the suggested pre-emption vulnerability value
within the Media-Component-Description AVP for the PCRF to determine the ARP
values. The AF may also include the Pre-emption-Control-Info AVP containing
the pre-emption control information at the AAR command level for the PCRF to
perform the pre-emption control as defined in subclause 4.5.27 or 4a.5.17 of
3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The AF may include the Sharing-Key-UL and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the
Media-Component-Description AVP in order to indicate that the related media of
the new AF session may share resources with other media components in the
related direction that include the same value for the Sharing-Key-UL AVP
and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP.
When the AF is a GCS AS, it may include the GCS-Identifier AVP at command
level and Reservation-Priority AVP at command level or media component level
in order to indicate that the new AF session relates to a prioritized Group
Communication session. Based on this information, the PCRF may take specific
actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the Group Communication
session is prioritized as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
If the AF provides service information that has been fully negotiated (e.g.
based on the SDP answer), the AF may include the Service-Info-Status AVP set
to FINAL_SERVICE_INFORMATION. In this case the PCRF shall authorize the
session and provision the corresponding PCC/QoS rules to the PCEF/BBERF.
The AF may additionally provide preliminary service information not fully
negotiated yet (e.g. based on the SDP offer) at an earlier stage. To do so,
the AF shall include the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to
PRELIMINARY SERVICE INFORMATION. Upon receipt of such preliminary service
information, the PCRF shall perform an early authorization check of the
service information. For GPRS, the PCRF shall not provision PCC rules towards
the PCEF unsolicitedly. However, the PCRF may authorize a PCC/QoS rule request
received from the PCEF/BBERF as per 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. Further, if the AF
requests the PCRF to report the access network information together with
preliminary service information, the PCRF shall immediately configure the PCEF
(or BBERF) to provide the access network information.
For sponsored data connectivity and if SponsoredConnectivity is supported, the
AF shall provide the application service provider identity and the sponsor
identity to the PCRF by including the Application-Service-Provider-Identity
AVP and the Sponsor-Identity AVP in the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP in the
AA-Request. Additionally if SponsorChange is supported the AF shall provide an
indication whether to enable or not enable sponsored data connectivity to the
PCRF by including the Sponsoring-Action AVP set to the applicable value.
NOTE 3: The relationship between the AF and Sponsor is out of scope of this
specification. A single AF can serve multiple ASPs and multiple sponsors, An
ASP can also be a sponsor.
To support the usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity, the AF may
also include the Granted-Service-Unit AVP in the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data
AVP and the Specific-Action AVP set to the value USAGE_REPORT in the AA-
Request to request notification when the usage threshold has been reached.
NOTE 4: If the AF is in the user plane, the AF can handle the usage monitoring
and therefore it is not required to provide a usage threshold to the PCRF as
part of the sponsored data connectivity information.
When SponsoredConnectivity is supported or when SponsorChange is supported and
the AF indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity, the following
procedures apply:
\- If the UE is roaming with the visited access case and the AF is located in
the HPLMN or roaming with the home routed case and operator policies do not
allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this roaming case, the
H-PCRF shall reject the service request indicating
UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY to the AF.
\- If the UE is roaming with the visited access case and the AF is located in
the VPLMN, the V-PCRF shall reject the service request indicating
UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY to the AF.
When SponsoredConnectivity is supported or when SponsorChange is supported and
the AF indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity, if the UE is in the
non-roaming case or roaming with the home routed case and the operator
policies allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this roaming
case, the following procedures apply:
\- If the PCEF/TDF does not support sponsored connectivity and the required
reporting level for that service indicates a sponsored connectivity level
according to 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], then the PCRF shall reject the request
indicating REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED.
\- If the PCEF/TDF supports sponsored data connectivity feature or the
required reporting level is different from sponsored connectivity level as
described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], then the PCRF, based on operator policies,
shall check whether it is required to validate the sponsored connectivity
data. If it is required, it shall perform the authorizations based on
sponsored data connectivity profiles. If the authorization fails, the PCRF
responds to the AF with an AA-Answer including the Experimental-Result-Code
AVP set to the value UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY. The profile may
include a list of Application Service Providers and their applications per
sponsor.
NOTE 5: If the AF is in the operator's network and is based on the
OSA/Parlay-X GW, the PCRF is not required to verify that a trust relationship
exists between the operator and the sponsors.
When CHEM feature is supported, the AF includes the Max-PLR-DL AVP and/or Max-
PLR-UL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP, to indicate the
downlink maximum packet loss rate and/or uplink maximum packet loss rate for
each payload type. For CHEM feature, see Annex A.18.
When the PCRF receives an initial AA-Request from the AF, the PCRF shall
perform session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9]. To allow the PCRF
to identify the IP-CAN session for which this request applies, the AF shall
provide either the Framed-IP-Address or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix containing the
full IP address applicable to an IP flow or IP flows towards the UE. In case
of private IP address being used, the AF may provide PDN information if
available in the Called-Station-Id AVP for session binding. The AF may provide
the domain identity in the IP-Domain-Id AVP for session binding.
NOTE 6: The IP-Domain-Id AVP is helpful in the following scenario: Within a
PLMN, there are several separate IP address domains, with PCEF(s) that
allocate Ipv4 IP addresses out of the same private address range to UEs. The
same IP address can thus be allocated to UEs served by PCEFs in different
address domains. If one PCRF controls several PCEFs in different IP address
domains, the UE IP address is thus not sufficient for the session binding. An
AF can serve UEs in different IP address domains, either by having direct IP
interfaces to those domains, or by having interconnections via NATs in the
user plane between PCEFs and the AF. If a NAT is used, the AF obtains the IP
address allocated to the UE via application level signalling and supplies it
for the session binding as Framed-IP-Address to the PCRF. The AF supplies an
IP-Domain-Id value denoting the IP address domain behind the NAT in addition.
The AF can derive the appropriate value from the source address (allocated by
the NAT) of incoming user plane packets. The value provided in the IP-Domain-
Id AVP is operator configurable.
NOTE 7: When the scenario described in NOTE 6 applies and the AF is a P-CSCF
it is assumed that the P-CSCF has direct IP interfaces to the different IP
address domains and that no NAT is located between P-GW and P-CSCF. How a non-
IMS AF obtains the UE private IP address to be provided to the PCRF is out of
scope of the present release; it is unspecified how to support applications
that use a protocol that does not retain the original UE's private IP address.
If the PCRF fails in executing session binding, the PCRF responds to the AF
with an AA-Answer including the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
IP-CAN_SESSION_NOT_AVAILABLE. Further details on how the PCRF identifies
suitable IP-CAN sessions can be found in the binding mechanism described in
3GPP TS 29.213 [9].
If the request contains Media-Component-Description Attribute-Value Pair(s)
(AVP(s)) the PCRF shall store the received Service Information. The PCRF shall
process the received Service Information according to the operator policy and
may decide whether the request is accepted or not. The PCRF may take the
priority information within the Reservation-Priority AVP into account when
making this decision.
For an IP-CAN session associated to a dedicated APN for the purpose of
offering services to remote UEs via a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE, as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.303 [46], the PCRF shall validate the service information based
on the service/roaming agreement and the operator policies related to that PDN
information.
NOTE 8: The PCRF is not required to be aware of the remote UE.
If the service information provided in the AA-Request command is rejected
(e.g. the subscribed guaranteed bandwidth for a particular user is exceeded),
the PCRF shall indicate in the AA-Answer command the cause for the rejection
with the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED. If the service information provided in the
AA-Request command is rejected by the PCRF due to a temporary condition in the
network (e.g. the user plane in the cell the user is located is congested),
the PCRF may indicate in the AA-Answer the cause for the rejection with the
Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
REQUESTED_SERVICE_TEMPORARILY_NOT_AUTHORIZED (4261). The PCRF may also provide
a retry-interval within the Retry-Interval AVP in the AA-Answer command to the
AF. When the AF receives the re-try interval within the Retry-Interval AVP,
the AF shall not send the same service information to the PCRF again (for the
same IP-CAN session) until the re-try interval has elapsed. The PCRF may
additionally provide the acceptable bandwidth within the Acceptable-Service-
Info AVP in AA-Answer command.
NOTE 9: How the PCRF derives the re-try interval is up to implementation.
To allow the PCRF and PCEF to perform PCC rule authorization and bearer
binding for the described service IP flows, the AF shall supply both source
and destination IP addresses and port numbers within the Flow-Description AVP,
if such information is available.
NOTE 10: In SDP source port information is usually not available.
The AF may specify the ToSâ€‘Trafficâ€‘Class AVP for the described service data
flows together with the Flowâ€‘Description AVP.
NOTE 11: The ToS-Traffic-Class AVP can be useful when another packet filter
attribute is needed to differentiate between flows. For example, (when EPS
bearers are used for group communication services) flows encapsulated and
encrypted by a tunneling protocol and thus having their IP five-tuple
attributes obscured can be differentiated by the Type of Service (or Traffic
Class) value of the outer header.
NOTE 12: The use of ToSâ€‘Trafficâ€‘Class AVP by the AF assumes that no DSCP re-
marking is applied from the application to the PGW.
The AF may specify the Reservation-Priority AVP at request level in the AA-
Request in order to assign a priority to the AF Session as well as specify the
Reservation-Priority AVP at the media-component-description AVP level to
assign a priority to the IP flow. The presence of the Reservation-Priority in
both levels does not constitute a conflict as they each represent different
types of priority. Specifically the Reservation-Priority at the AA-Request
level provides the relative priority for a session while the Reservation-
Priority at the media-component-description level provides the relative
priority for an IP flow within a session. If the Reservation-Priority AVP is
not specified the requested priority is DEFAULT (0).
The AF may request notifications of specific IP-CAN session events through the
usage of the Specific-Action AVP in the AA-Request command. The PCRF shall
make sure to inform the AF of the requested notifications in the event that
they take place.
The AF may include the Rx-Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST in the AAR.
The AF may include a Reference Id within the Reference-Id AVP related to a
transfer policy negotiated for background data transfer via the Nt reference
point as described in 3GPP TS 29.154 [47]. The PCRF shall retrieve the
corresponding transfer policy from the SPR based on the Reference Id. If the
PCRF can not retrieve the transfer policy, the PCRF shall include in the AA-
Answer the Service-Authorization-Info AVP with the bit 0 set to indicate that
the transfer policy is unknown. If the time window of the received transfer
policy has expired, the PCRF shall include in the AA-Answer the Service-
Authorization-Info AVP with the bit 1set to indicate that the transfer policy
has expired. Otherwise, if the time window of the received transfer policy has
not yet occurred, the PCRF shall include in the AA-Answer the Service-
Authorization-Info AVP with the bit 2 set to indicate that the time window of
the transfer policy has not yet occurred.
NOTE 13: In the case that the PCRF can not retrieve the transfer policy or the
transfer policy expired, the PCRF makes the decision without considering the
transfer policy.
NOTE 14: When receiving the reference id from the 3rd party SCS/AS as
described in 3GPP TS 23.682 [40], the SCEF (acting as an AF) can provide the
reference id together with the sponsored data connectivity information if
SponsorChange is supported as described in this subclause.
The AF may include the IMS-Content-Type AVP into the AA-Request in order to
indicate the type of IMS communication service (e.g. CAT service, 3PTY
conference) the AF session refers to.
The AF may include the IMS-Content-Identifier AVP into the AA-Request in order
to indicate the particular IMS communication service or communication dialogue
that the AF session refers to.
The AF may include the Calling-Party-Address AVP and the Callee-Information
AVP into the AA-Request in order to indicate the caller and the callee
information that the AF session refers to.
The PCRF shall check whether the received Service Information requires PCC/QoS
Rules to be created and provisioned and/or authorized QoS to be provisioned as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9]. Provisioning of PCC/QoS Rules and Authorized
QoS to the PCEF/BBERF shall be carried out as specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
If the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP are provided within the
Media-Component-Description AVP, the PCRF may apply the mechanisms for
resource sharing as specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The PCRF shall reply with an AA-Answer to the AF. The acknowledgement towards
the AF should take place before or in parallel with any required PCC Rule
provisioning towards the PCEF and shall include the **Accessâ€‘Network-Charging-
Identifier**(s) and may include the Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP, if
they are available. The AA-Answer message shall also include the AN-GW-Address
AVP, if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated with this information
in the PCEF. The AA-Answer message shall also include the PLMN identifier
within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP if the PCRF has previously requested to be
updated with this information in the PCEF/BBERF. The AA-Answer message shall
also include the IP-CAN-Type AVP. if the PCRF has previously requested to be
updated with this information in the PCEF/BBERF. In that case, the AA-Answer
message shall also include the RAT type information within the RAT-Type AVP
and AN-Trusted AVP when applicable for the specific IP-CAN Type. In addition,
if IP flow mobility applies to service data flows as specified in 3GPP TS
29.212 [8], such that a subset of the flows within the AF session are
affected, the PCRF shall also include IP-CAN-type and RAT type information (if
applicable) to IP flow mobility related flows, if such information is
available. The IP flow mobility affected service data flows are included
within the Flows AVP at command level. If the PCRF needs to terminate the Rx
session before it has sent the AA Answer, the PCRF shall send the AA Answer
immediately and before the AS Request.
The behaviour when the AF does not receive the AA Answer, or when it arrives
after the internal timer waiting for it has expired, or when it arrives with
an indication different than DIAMETER_SUCCESS, are outside the scope of this
specification and based on operator policy.
If the PCRF fails in installing PCC/QoS rules based on the provided service
information due to resource allocation failure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212
[8] and if requested by the AF, the PCRF shall send an RAR command to the AF
with the Specific-Action AVP set to the value
INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION to report the resource allocation
failure, the Flows AVP containing the service data flows corresponding to the
resources that could not be allocated, and the content version within the
Content-Version AVP if it was included when the corresponding media component
was provisioned. The AF shall send an RAA command to acknowledge the RAR
command.
### 4.4.2 Modification of Session Information
The AF may modify the session information at any time (e.g. due to an AF
session modification or internal AF trigger) by sending an AA-Request command
to the PCRF containing the Media-Component-Description AVP(s) with the updated
Service Information. The AF shall send an AA-Request command to the PCRF, only
after the previous AA-Request has been acknowledged.
If the AF provides service information that has been fully negotiated (e.g.
based on the SDP answer), the AF may include the Service-Info-Status AVP set
to FINAL_SERVICE_INFORMATION. In this case the PCRF shall authorize the
session and provision the corresponding PCC rules to the PCEF.
The AF may additionally provide preliminary service information not fully
negotiated yet (e.g. based on the SDP offer) at an earlier stage. To do so,
the AF shall include the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to
PRELIMINARY SERVICE INFORMATION. Upon receipt of such preliminary service
information, the PCRF shall perform an early authorization check of the
service information. For GPRS, the PCRF shall not provision PCC rules towards
the PCEF unsolicitedly. However, the PCRF may authorize a PCC/QoS rule request
received from the PCEF/BBERF as per 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. Further, if the AF
requests the PCRF to report the access network information together with
preliminary service information, the PCRF shall immediately configure the PCEF
(or BBERF) to provide the access network information.
The AF may include the Rx-Request-Type AVP set to UPDATE_REQUEST in the AAR.
The AF may include a Reference Id within the Reference-Id AVP related to a
transfer policy negotiated for background data transfer via the Nt reference
point as described in 3GPP TS 29.154 [47]. The AF shall retrieve the
corresponding transfer policy from the SPR based on the Reference Id. If the
PCRF can not retrieve the transfer policy, the PCRF shall include in the AA-
Answer the Service-Authorization-Info AVP with the bit 0 set to indicate that
the transfer policy is unknown. If the time window of the received transfer
policy has expired, the PCRF shall include in the AA-Answer the Service-
Authorization-Info AVP with the bit 1set to indicate that the transfer policy
has expired. Otherwise, if the time window of the received transfer policy has
not yet occurred, the PCRF shall include in the AA-Answer the Service-
Authorization-Info AVP with the bit 2 set to indicate that the time window of
the transfer policy has not yet occurred.
NOTE 1: In the case that the PCRF can not retrieve the transfer policy or the
transfer policy expired, the PCRF makes the decision without considering the
transfer policy.
NOTE 2: When receiving the reference id from the 3rd party SCS/AS as described
in 3GPP TS 23.682 [40], the SCEF (acting as an AF) can provide the reference
id together with the sponsored data connectivity information if SponsorChange
is supported as described in this subclause.
The AF may include the MPS-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the
modified AF session relates to an MPS session. If the PCRF receives the MPS-
Identifier AVP, it may take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to
ensure that the MPS session is prioritized as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
For Multimedia Priority Service handling, see Annex A.9.
The AF may include the MCPTT-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the
modified AF session relates to the priority adjustment of an MCPTT session. If
the PCRF receives the MCPTT-Identifier AVP related to that MCPTT session, the
PCRF may take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the
MCPTT session is prioritized. For the handling of MCPTT session with priority
call, see Annex A.13.
The AF may include the MCVideo-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the
modified AF session relates to the priority adjustment of an MCVideo session.
If the PCRF receives the MCVideo-Identifier AVP related to that MCVideo
session, the PCRF may take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to
ensure that the MCVideo session is prioritized. For the handling of MCVideo
session with priority call, see Annex A.15.
If the QoSHint feature is supported by the AF, the AF may include the Desired-
Max-Latency AVP and/or Desired-Max-Loss AVP within the Media-Component-
Description AVP to indicate to the PCRF that the related application media has
specific latency and/or loss demands.
The AF may include the FLUS-Identifier AVP within the Media-Component-
Description AVP in order to indicate to the PCRF that the media flow(s)
correspond to a FLUS media stream. Additional QoS information for the
treatment of FLUS media may be provided within Desired-Max-Latency AVP and/or
Desired-Max-Loss AVP.
The AF may include the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to
PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED within the Media-Component-Description AVP in order
to indicate to the PCRF that the related media flow is allowed to use the same
Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) as media flows belonging to other AF
sessions as described in subclause 4.4.8. In this case, if the MCPTT-
Preemption is supported, the AF may also include the Pre-emption-Capability
AVP containing the suggested pre-emption capability value and the Pre-emption-
Vulnerability AVP containing the suggested pre-emption vulnerability value
within the Media-Component-Description AVP for the PCRF to determine the ARP
values. The AF may also include the Pre-emption-Control-Info AVP containing
the pre-emption control information at the AAR command level for the PCRF to
perform the pre-emption control as defined in subclause 4.5.27 or 4a.5.17 of
3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The AF may include the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the
Media-Component-Description AVP in order to indicate that the related media of
the modified AF session may share resources with other media components in the
related direction that include the same Sharing-Key-UL and or Sharing-Key-DL
AVP. The AF may modify the conditions for resource sharing by including a new
value of the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP for that media
component.
When the AF is a GCS AS, it may include the GCS-Identifier AVP at command
level and Reservation-Priority AVP at command level or media component level
in order to modify the priority of an AF session that relates to a prioritized
Group Communication session. Based on this information, the PCRF may take
specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the Group
Communication session is prioritized as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
For sponsored data connectivity and if SponsoredConnectivity is supported, the
AF shall provide the application service provider identity and the sponsor
identity to the PCRF by including Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP
and the Sponsor-Identity AVP in the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP in the AA-
Request.
If SponsorChange is supported and the AF requests to enable sponsored data
connectivity the AF shall provide the application service provider identity,
the sponsor identity and an indication to enable sponsored data connectivity
to the PCRF by including Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP, the
Sponsor-Identity AVP and the Sponsoring-Action AVP set to the value
ENABLE_SPONSORING (1) in the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP in the AA-
Request.
If the AF requests to disable sponsored data connectivity the AF shall provide
an indication to disable sponsored data connectivity to the PCRF by including
the Sponsoring-Action AVP set to the value DISABLE_SPONSORING (0) in the
Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP in the AA-Request.
To support the usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity, the AF may
also include the Granted-Service-Unit AVP in the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data
AVP in the AA-Request.
NOTE 3: If the AF is in the user plane, the AF can handle the usage monitoring
and therefore it is not required to provide a usage threshold to the PCRF as
part of the sponsored data connectivity information.
When sponsored data connectivity is requested to be enabled the following
procedures apply:
\- If the UE is roaming with the visited access case and the AF is located in
the HPLMN or roaming with the home routed case and operator policies do not
allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this roaming case, the
H-PCRF shall reject the service request indicating
UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY to the AF.
\- If the UE is roaming with the visited access case and the AF is located in
the VPLMN, the V-PCRF shall reject the service request indicating
UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY to the AF.
When sponsored data connectivity is requested to be enabled, if the UE is in
the non-roaming case or roaming with the home routed case and the operator
policies allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this roaming
case, the following procedures apply:
\- If the PCEF/TDF does not support sponsored connectivity and the required
reporting level for that service indicates a sponsored connectivity level
according to 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], then the PCRF shall reject the request
indicating REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED.
\- If the PCEF/TDF supports sponsored data connectivity feature or the
required reporting level is different from sponsored connectivity level as
described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], then the PCRF, based on operator policies,
shall check whether it is required to validate the sponsored connectivity
data. If it is required, it shall perform the authorizations based on
sponsored data connectivity profiles. If the authorization fails, the PCRF
responds to the AF with an AA-Answer including the Experimental-Result-Code
AVP set to the value UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY. The profile may
include a list of Application Service Providers and their applications per
sponsor.
NOTE 4: If the AF is in the operator\'s network and is based on the
OSA/Parlay-X GW, the PCRF is not required to verify that a trust relationship
exists between the operator and the sponsors.
When CHEM feature is supported, the AF includes the Max-PLR-DL AVP and/or Max-
PLR-UL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP, to indicate the
downlink maximum packet loss rate and/or uplink maximum packet loss rate for
each payload type. For CHEM feature, see Annex A.18.
The AF may include an AF application identifier within the AF-Application-
Identifier AVP at the session level to trigger the PCRF to indicate to the
PCEF/TDF to perform the application detection based on the operator's policy
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The AF may include the IMS-Content-Type AVP into the AA-Request in order to
indicate the type of IMS communication service (e.g. CAT service, 3PTY
conference) the AF session refers to.
The AF may include the IMS-Content-Identifier AVP into the AA-Request in order
to indicate the particular IMS communication service or communication dialogue
that the AF session refers to.
The AF may include the Callee-Information AVP into the AA-Request in order to
indicate the callee information that the AF session refers to.
The PCRF shall process the received Service Information according the operator
policy and may decide whether the request is accepted or not. If the updated
Service Information is not acceptable (e.g. subscribed guaranteed bandwidth
for a particular user is exceeded), the PCRF shall indicate in the AA-Answer
command the cause for the rejection with the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set
to the value REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED. If the service information
provided in the AA-Request command is rejected by the PCRF due to a temporary
condition in the network (e.g. the user plane in the cell the user is located
is congested), the PCRF may indicate in the AA-Answer the cause for the
rejection with the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
REQUESTED_SERVICE_TEMPORARILY_NOT_AUTHORIZED (4261). The PCRF may also provide
a retry-interval within the Retry-Interval AVP in the AA-Answer command to the
AF. When the AF receives the re-try interval within the Retry-Interval AVP,
the AF shall not send the same service information to the PCRF again (for the
same IP-CAN session) until the re-try interval has elapsed. The PCRF may
additionally provide the acceptable bandwidth within the Acceptable-Service-
Info AVP in the AA-Answer command.
NOTE 5: How the PCRF derives the re-try interval is up to implementation.
If accepted, the PCRF shall update the Service Information with the new
information received. Due to the updated Service Information, the PCRF may
need to create, modify or delete the related PCC rules as specified in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9] and provide the updated information towards the PCEF following the
corresponding procedures specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. The procedures to
update the Authorized QoS for the affected IP-CAN bearer are also specified at
3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
If the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP are provided within the
Media-Component-Description AVP, the PCRF may apply the mechanisms for
resource sharing as specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The PCRF shall reply with an AA-Answer to the AF. The acknowledgement towards
the AF should take place before or in parallel with any required PCC Rule
provisioning towards the PCEF and shall include the **Accessâ€‘Network-Charging-
Identifier**(s) and may include the Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP, if
they are available at this moment and have not been yet supplied earlier to
the AF. The AA-Answer message shall include the AN-GW-Address AVP if the PCRF
has previously requested to be updated with this information in the PCEF. The
AA-Answer message shall also include the PLMN identifier within the 3GPP-SGSN-
MCC-MNC AVP if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated with this
information in the PCEF/BBERF. The AA-Answer message shall also include the
IP-CAN-Type AVP if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated with this
information in the PCEF/BBERF . In that case, the AA-Answer message shall also
include the RAT type information within the RAT-Type AVP and AN-Trusted AVP
when applicable for the specific IP-CAN Type. In addition, if IP flow mobility
applies to service data flows as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], such that a
subset of the flows within the AF session are affected, the PCRF shall also
include IP-CAN-type and RAT type information (if applicable) to IP flow
mobility related flows, if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated
with this information in the PCEF. The IP flow mobility affected service data
flows are included within the Flows AVP at command level. If the PCRF needs to
terminate the Rx session before it has sent the AA Answer, the PCRF shall send
the AA Answer immediately and before the AS Request. If the PCRF does not have
an existing session for the Rx session being modified (such as after a PCRF
failure), the PCRF may reject the request with an AA-Answer with the result
code set to DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.
If the PCRF installs PCC/QoS rules or modifies existing PCC/QoS rules based on
the updated service information and the installation or modification fails due
to resource allocation failure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and if
requested by the AF, the PCRF shall send an RAR command to the AF with the
Specific-Action AVP set to the value INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION
to report the modification failure, the Flows AVP containing the service data
flows corresponding to the resources that could not be allocated, and the
content version(s) within the Content-Version AVP(s) if it was included when
the corresponding media component was provisioned. If the modification of the
existing PCC/QoS rules fails, the PCRF may also provide the status of the
service information within the Media-Component-Status AVP. The AF shall send
an RAA command to acknowledge the RAR command.
NOTE 6: The PCRF will report the Media-Component-Status AVP according to the
status reported for the related PCC/QoS rules when the modification fails over
the Gx/Gxx reference points as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
### 4.4.3 Gate Related Procedures
Depending on the application, in the Service Information provision, the AF may
instruct the PCRF when the IP flow(s) are to be enabled or disabled to pass
through the IP-CAN. The AF does this by sending the AA-Request message
containing the Media-Component- Description AVP(s) that contains the flow
status information (in the Flow-Status AVP) for the flows to be enabled or
disabled.
In response to this action the PCRF shall set the appropriate gate status for
the corresponding active PCC rule(s).
If a Media-Sub-Component AVP under a Media-Component-Description AVP contains
a Flow-Usage AVP with the value RTCP, then the corresponding RTCP IP Flows in
both directions shall be enabled even if the Flow-Status AVP under the Media-
Sub-Component AVP is set to ENABLED-UPLINK, ENABLED-DOWNLINK, ENABLED, or
DISABLED.
The PCRF shall reply with an AA-Answer and shall include the **Accessâ€‘Network-
Charging-Identifier**(s) available at this moment. The PCRF forwards the AF
decision to enable or disable the authorized IP flows.
The behaviour when the AF does not receive the AAA, or when it arrives after
the internal timer waiting for it has expired, or when it arrives with an
indication different than DIAMETER_SUCCESS, are outside the scope of this
specification and based on operator policy.
### 4.4.4 AF Session Termination
When an AF session is terminated, if the AF had received a successful AA-
Answer for the initial AA-Request, the AF shall send a Session-Termination-
Request command to the PCRF. Otherwise, the AF shall wait for the initial AA-
Answer to be received prior to sending the Session-Termination-Request command
to the PCRF.
When the PCRF receives a ST-Request from the AF, indicating an AF session
termination, it shall acknowledge that request by sending a ST-Answer to the
AF. Afterwards, it shall free the resources allocated for the corresponding
Service Data Flow(s). In order to do that, the PCRF shall initiate the request
for the removal of any related PCC/QoS rules from the PCEF/BBERF and for the
update of the Authorized QoS for the affected IP-CAN bearer following the
corresponding procedures specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. However, if the AF
requests the reporting of access network information within the ST-Request or
if the AF provided a threshold for the sponsored data connectivity, the PCRF
shall defer sending the ST-Answer.
If the AF session being terminated corresponds to an MPS session, the PCRF may
revoke the actions related to the prioritization of the MPS session in the
corresponding IP-CAN as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. For Multimedia Priority
Service handling, see Annex A.9.
If the AF session being terminated corresponds to the last Group Communication
session for the IP-CAN session, the PCRF may revoke the actions related to the
prioritization of the Group Communication session as specified in 3GPP TS
29.212 [8].
If the AF session being terminated corresponds to a session that included the
Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED within the
Media-Component-Description AVP, the PCRF should readjust the Allocation and
Retention Priority for the remaining services sharing priority as described in
subclause 4.4.8.
For sponsored data connectivity, and if a usage threshold was provided for the
sponsored data connection at initial provisioning of session information
(clause 4.4.1) or modification of session information (clause 4.4.2)
procedures, the PCRF shall provide the usage consumed to the AF. For such
purpose, the PCRF shall initiate the IP-CAN session modification procedure
according 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] in order to obtain the consumed usage. The PCRF
shall send then the ST-Answer to the AF including the Used-Service-Unit AVP
for reporting accumulated usage within the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP.
If the AF requires access network information at this step, the AF shall
include the Required-Access-Info AVP within the ST-Request command, indicating
the required information. In this case, the PCRF shall initiate the IP-CAN
session modification procedure according to 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. The PCRF shall
send then the ST-Answer to the AF including the required data within the 3GPP-
User-Location-Info AVP (if available), TWAN-Identifier AVP (if available),
User-Location-Info-Time AVP (if available), UE-Local-IP-Address AVP (if
available), UDP-Source-Port AVP (if available), TCP-Source-Port AVP (if
available), 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if location info is not available) and/or
3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if available).
If the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported and the AF initiated the termination
of the AF session, upon reception of the ST-Request command, the PCRF shall
initiate the IP-CAN session modification procedure according to 3GPP TS 29.212
[8].
If the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported , in all the AF session termination
cases , t he PCRF shall send the ST-Answer to the AF including the access
network information within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if available),
TWAN-Identifier (if available and Netloc-Trusted-WLAN feature is supported)
User-Location-Info-Time AVP (if available), 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if location
info is not available) and/or 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if available).
Additionally, if the PCRF received from the PCEF the RAN cause and/or NAS
cause, TWAN cause or untrusted WLAN cause, the PCRF shall provide the received
cause(s) in the RAN-NAS-Release-Cause AVP in the ST-Answer command.
NOTE: The PCRF will apply the procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] to
get updated about the outcome of the resource release over Gx reference point
in order to get the location and failure cause(s) when applicable.
### 4.4.5 Subscription to Notification of Signalling Path Status
An AF may subscribe to notifications of the status of the AF Signalling
transmission path. To do so, the AF shall open an Rx Diameter session with the
PCRF for the AF signalling using an AA-Request command. The AF shall provide
the UE's IP address (using either the Framed-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-
Ipv6-Prefix AVP) and the Specific-Action AVP requesting the subscription to
\"INDICATION_OF_LOSS_OF BEARER\" and/or \"INDICATION_OF_RELEASE_OF_BEARER\".
The AF shall additionally provide a Media-Component-Description AVP including
a single Media-Sub-Component AVP with the Flow-Usage AVP set to the value
\"AF_SIGNALLING\". The Media-Component-Description AVP shall contain the
Media-Component-Number AVP set to \"0\".
If the procedures in Clause 4.4.5a are not applied, the Media-Sub-Component
AVP shall contain the Flow-Number AVP set to \"0\", and the rest of AVPs
within the Media-Component-Description and Media-Sub-Component AVPs shall not
be used in this case.
When the PCRF receives an AA-Request as described in the preceding paragraph
from the AF, the PCRF shall perform session binding as described in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9] and acknowledges the AAR command by sending an AAâ€‘Answer command to
the AF.
PCC/QoS Rules related to AF Signalling IP Flows should be provisioned to
PCEF/BBERF using the corresponding procedures specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]
at an earlier stage (e.g. typically at the establishment of the IP-CAN bearer
dedicated for AF Signalling IP Flows). The PCRF may install the corresponding
dynamic PCC/QoS rule for the AF signalling IP flows if none has been installed
before.
NOTE 1: Well-known ports (e.g. 3GPP TS 24.229 [17] for SIP) or wildcard ports
can be used by PCRF to derive the dynamic PCC/QoS rule for the AF signalling
IP flows.
If the Rx Diameter Session is only used for subscription to Notification of
Signalling Path Status, the AF may cancel the subscription to notifications of
the status of the AF Signalling transmission path. In that case, the AF shall
use a Session-Termination-Request (STR) command to the PCRF, which shall be
acknowledged with a Session-Termination-Answer (STA) command.
NOTE 2: The Rx Diameter Session created for the AF signalling can also be used
when the AF requests notifications of IP-CAN type change, PLMN change and/or
when the AF provisions AF Signalling Flow Information.
### 4.4.5a Provisioning of AF Signalling Flow Information
This clause is applicable when IMS restoration is supported according to
supported feature ProvAFsignalFlow as described in clause 5.4.1.
An AF may provision information about the AF signalling IP flows between the
UE and the AF. To do so, the AF shall make use of an Rx Diameter session
already opened with the PCRF if an Rx Diameter session related to the AF
signalling is already established. The AF may modify an already open Rx
Diameter session related to the AF signalling (e.g. an Rx Diameter session
established for the purpose of subscription to notification of signalling path
status as described in 4.4.5) or it may open a new Rx Diameter session related
to the AF signalling if none exists.
To provision the AF signalling flow information the AF shall provide the UE's
IP address using either Framed-IP-Address AVP or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP. The
AF shall additionally provide a Media-Component-Description AVP including one
or more Media-Sub-Component AVP(s) representing the AF signalling IP flows.
The Media-Component-Description AVP shall contain the Media-Component-Number
AVP set to \"0\". Each Media-Sub-Component AVP representing an AF signalling
IP flow shall contain the Flow-Number AVP set according to the rules described
in Annex B and one or two Flow-Description AVP(s) set to the IP flows of the
AF signalling. Additionally, the Media-Sub-Component AVP shall include the
Flow-Usage AVP set to the value \"AF_SIGNALLING\", the Flow-Status AVP set to
\"ENABLED\" and the AF-Signalling-Protocol AVP set to the value corresponding
to the signalling protocol used between the UE and the AF.
When the PCRF receives from the AF an AA-Request as described in the preceding
paragraph, the PCRF shall perform session binding as described in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9] and shall acknowledge the AAR command by sending an AAâ€‘Answer
command to the AF.
PCC/QoS Rules related to the AF signalling IP flows could have been
provisioned to PCEF/BBERF using the corresponding procedures specified in 3GPP
TS 29.212 [8] at an earlier stage (e.g. typically at the establishment of the
IP-CAN bearer dedicated for AF Signalling IP Flows). The PCRF shall install
the corresponding dynamic PCC/QoS rule for the AF signalling IP flows.
The AF may de-provision the information about the AF signalling IP flows at
any time. To do that, if the Rx Diameter session is only used to provide
information about the AF Signalling IP flows, the AF shall close the Rx
Diameter session by sending a Session-Termination-Request (STR) command to the
PCRF, which shall be acknowledged with a Session-Termination-Answer (STA)
command. Otherwise, the AF shall remove the IP flows within the Media-Sub-
Component AVP by supplying the Flow-Status AVP with value \"REMOVED\". In both
cases, the PCRF shall remove the corresponding dynamic PCC/QoS rule for the AF
signalling IP flows.
### 4.4.6 Traffic Plane Events
#### 4.4.6.1 IP-CAN Session Termination
When an IP-CAN session is terminated, the PCRF shall inform the AF about the
IP-CAN session termination by sending an ASR (abort session request) command
to the AF on each active Rx Diameter session.
When the AF receives the ASR command, it shall acknowledge the command by
sending an ASA (abort session answer) command to the PCRF. After that the AF
shall initiate an AF session termination procedure as defined in subclause
4.4.4.
Signalling flows for IP-CAN session termination cases are presented in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9].
#### 4.4.6.2 Service Data Flow Deactivation
It may happen that one or more PCC/QoS Rules (i.e. Service Data Flows) are
deactivated at the PCEF/BBERF at a certain time, either permanently or
temporarily. When the PCRF gets the knowledge that one or more SDFs have been
deactivated, (e.g. due to a bearer release or loss of bearer or out of credit
condition), the PCRF shall inform the AF accordingly if the AF has previously
subscribed using the Specific-Action AVP in the AAR command.
When not all the service data flows within the AF session are affected, the
PCRF shall inform the AF by sending an RAR (re-authorization request) command.
The RAR command shall include the deactivated IP Flows encoded in the Flows
AVP, the cause encoded in the Specific-Action AVP and the content version of a
media component within the Content-Version AVP if it was included when the
media component was provisioned.
If the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported and the PCRF received the access
network information from the PCEF/BBERF due to bearer termination, the PCRF
shall include in the RAR command the access network information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if available), TWAN-Identifier (if available and
Netloc-Trusted-WLAN feature is supported) User-Location-Info-Time AVP (if
available), 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if location info is not available) and/or
3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if available). Additionally, if the PCRF received from
the PCEF the RAN cause and/or NAS cause, TWAN cause or untrusted WLAN cause
due to bearer termination, the PCRF shall provide the received cause(s) in the
RAN-NAS-Release-Cause AVP in the RAR command.
When the AF receives the RAR command, it shall acknowledge the command by
sending an RAA (re-authorization answer) command to the PCRF. The AF may also
update the session information by sending an AAR (AA-request) command to the
PCRF.
If the PCRF receives the AAR command, it shall acknowledge the command by
sending an AAA (AA-answer) command to the AF.
When all the service data flows within the AF session are affected, the PCRF
shall inform the AF by sending an ASR command on the Rx Diameter session
related to the AF session. When the AF receives the ASR command, it shall
acknowledge the command by sending an ASA (abort session answer) command to
the PCRF. After that the AF shall initiate an AF session termination procedure
as defined in clause 4.4.4.
Signalling flows for Service Data Flow Deactivation cases are presented in
3GPP TS 29.213 [9].
#### 4.4.6.3 Notification of Signalling Path Status
In the event that the PCRF is notified of the loss or release of resources
associated to the PCC/QoS Rules corresponding with AF Signalling IP Flows, the
PCRF shall inform the AF about the Loss of the Signalling Transmission path by
sending a Reâ€‘Authorization Request (RAR) command to the AF. The RAR shall
include the Specific-Action AVP set to the value
\"INDICATION_OF_LOSS_OF_BEARER\" or \"INDICATION_OF_RELEASE_OF_BEARER\" and
the deactivated IP Flow encoded in the Flows AVP.
NOTE: According to the standardized QCI characteristics as defined in 3GPP TS
23.203 [2], the IMS signalling specific PCC rules include a QCI corresponding
to a non-GBR bearer. When these guidelines are followed, the
INDICATION_OF_LOSS_OF_BEARER will not be reported.
If the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported and the PCRF received the access
network information from the PCEF/BBERF due to bearer termination, the PCRF
shall include in the RAR command the access network information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if available), TWAN-Identifier (if available and
Netloc-Trusted-WLAN feature is supported) User-Location-Info-Time AVP (if
available), 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if location info is not available) and/or
3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if available). Additionally, if the PCRF received from
the PCEF the RAN cause and/or NAS cause, TWAN cause or untrusted WLAN cause
due to bearer termination, the PCRF shall provide the received cause(s) in the
RAN-NAS-Release-Cause AVP in the RAR command.
When the AF receives the RAR command, it shall acknowledge the command by
sending an RAA command to the PCRF.
The AF may then decide to terminate the Rx Diameter session used for the
notification of the status of the AF Signalling transmission path. The AF may
also decide to terminate any other active Rx Diameter session with the PCRF
related to the AF Signalling which is not available any longer. In that case,
the AF shall then initiate the AF Termination procedure towards the PCRF as
defined in clause 4.4.4.
#### 4.4.6.4 IP-CAN type change Notification
If the AF has successfully subscribed to change notifications in UE's IP-CAN
type and RAT type, the PCRF shall send an RAR command when the corresponding
event occurs, i.e. when the UE's IP-CAN type or RAT type changes or becomes
available. In this case the RAR from the PCRF shall include the Specific-
Action AVP for the subscribed event and include the IP-CAN-Type AVP, RAT-Type
AVP (if applicable) and AN-Trusted AVP (if applicable) and AN-GW-Address AVP
(if applicable) for the UE's new IP-CAN/RAT. If the PCRF is informed of an IP-
CAN type change due to IP flow mobility as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8],
where a subset of the flows within the AF session are affected, the PCRF shall
include IP-CAN type and RAT type information (if applicable) to IP flow
mobility affected service data flows. The IP flow mobility affected service
data flows are included within the Flows AVP at command level.
#### 4.4.6.5 Access Network Charging Information Notification
If the AF has subscribed to a notification about Access Network Charging
Information, the PCRF shall provide the Access Network Charging Information in
the response, if already known by the PCRF. If not available, the PCRF shall
provide the Access Network Charging Information by sending a Re-Authorization-
Request (RAR) command when the Access Network Charging Information is received
from the PCEF. If different Access Network Charging Information is applicable
to the IP-CAN session, the PCRF shall notify the AF about the Access Network
Charging Information that applies to each authorized flow. The RAR shall
include the Specific-Action AVP set to the value
\"CHARGING_CORRELATION_EXCHANGE\" and shall include the assigned
**Accessâ€‘Network-Charging-Identifier**(s) and may include the Access-Network-
Charging-Address AVP.
#### 4.4.6.6 Reporting Usage for Sponsored Data Connectivity
When SponsoredConnectivity is supported or when SponsorChange is supported and
the AF indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity and the AF provided
usage monitoring thresholds for such sponsor to the PCRF when the Rx Diameter
session was established or modified, the PCRF shall report accumulated usage
to the AF, when
\- the PCRF detects that the usage threshold provided by the AF has been
reached; or
\- the AF session is terminated by the AF;
\- the AF disables the sponsored data connectivity; or
\- the AF session is terminated by the PCRF due to the IP-CAN session
termination, the termination of all the service data flows of the AF session
or the home operator policy disallowing the UE accessing the sponsored data
connectivity in the roaming case.
When the PCRF detects that the usage threshold has been reached or the AF
disables the sponsored data connectivity, the PCRF shall report the
accumulated usage as provided by the PCEF/TDF to the AF in a RA-Request (RAR)
command with the Specific-Action AVP set to the value USAGE_REPORT; Otherwise,
when the AF session is terminated by the AF or the PCRF, the PCRF shall report
the accumulated usage as provided by the PCEF/TDF to the AF in ST-Answer (STA)
command. The accumulated usage reported by the PCRF corresponds to the usage
since the last report to the AF.
The accumulated usage shall be reported in the Used-Service-Unit AVP within
the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP.
If the AF receives a RAR command indicating the usage threshold is reached,
the AF may terminate the AF session or provide a new usage threshold in the
Granted-Service-Unit AVP within the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP to the
PCRF in the AAR command. Alternatively, the AF may allow the session to
continue without providing new usage threshold in the AAR command.
NOTE: After the PCRF reports the accumulated usage to the AF, the AF can
provide a new usage threshold to the PCRF. The monitoring will not start until
the PCRF receives the new threshold from the AF and provide it to the PCEF
#### 4.4.6.7 Reporting Access Network Information
If the AF requests the PCRF to report the access network information (i.e.
user location and/or user timezone information), the AF shall subscribe to the
\"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" within the Specific-Action AVP and shall
include the required access network information within the Required-Access-
Info AVP. The AF may request the PCRF to report the access network information
in conjunction with providing the PCRF with the AF session information, refer
to clause 4.4.1. Optionally, the AF may request the PCRF to report the access
network information without providing service information (see clause A.10.2).
In the latter case the AF establishes an Rx session for the AF session upon
requesting the access network information from the PCRF with an AA-Request
command, containing information required for the session binding in the
Framed-IP-Address AVP, the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP Subscription-Id AVP, the
Called-Station-Id AVP and/or the IP-Domain-Id AVP.
The AF may also request the PCRF to report the access network information at
Rx session termination. To do so, the AF shall include the required access
network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP in the corresponding
ST-Request.
When the PCRF receives a request to report the access network information from
the AF in an AAR command or in an STR command triggered by the AF, if the PCRF
determines that the access network does not support the access network
information reporting based on the currently used IP-CAN type or the values of
the RAT-Type AVP or the PCEF/BBERF does not support the NetLoc feature as
described in subclause 5.4.1, the PCRF shall respond to AF with an AAA or STA
command including the NetLoc-Access-Support AVP set to the value of 0
(NETLOC_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED); otherwise, it shall immediately configure the
PCEF or BBERF to provide such access network information.
When the PCRF then receives the access network information from the
PCEF/BBERF, the PCRF shall provide the corresponding access network
information to the AF within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if available),
TWAN-Identifier AVP (if available), User-Location-Info-Time AVP (if
available), UE-Local-IP-Address AVP (if available), UDP-Source-Port AVP (if
available), TCP-Source-Port AVP (if available), 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if
location info is not available) and/or 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP in the RAR command
if the Rx session is not being terminated or in the STA command if the Rx
session is being terminated. If the information is provided in the RAR
command, PCRF shall also provide the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT within
Specific-Action AVP.
NOTE 1: The PCRF receives the access network information from the PCEF/BBERF
if it is requested by the AF previously or the IP-CAN bearer/IP-CAN session is
terminated.
When the PCRF receives the NetLoc-Access-Support AVP set to the value of 0
(NETLOC_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED) from the PCEF/BBERF, the PCRF shall send a RAR
command including the Specific-Action AVP set to
INDICATION_OF_ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORTING_FAILURE and the NetLoc-Access-
Support AVP set to the value of 0 (NETLOC_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED) if the AF
requested the access network information in an AAR command or send an STA
command including the NetLoc-Access-Support AVP set to the value of 0
(NETLOC_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED) if the AF requested the access network
information in an STR command.
NOTE 2: The 3GPP GPRS, 3GPP EPS, Untrusted WLAN and Trusted WLAN support
access network information reporting in this release.
The PCRF shall not send an RAR command with the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT
value within a Specific-Action AVP to report any subsequently received access
network information to the AF, unless the AF sends a new request for access
network information.
#### 4.4.6.8 Temporary Network Failure handling
If the PCRF detects that a temporary network failure has occurred (e.g. the
SGW has failed for 3GPP-EPS access as defined in clause B.3.14 of 3GPP TS
29.212 [8]) and the AF requests an AF session establishment or modification in
an AA-Request command, the PCRF shall respond to the AF with an AA-Answer
including the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
TEMPORARY_NETWORK_FAILURE.
If the PCRF detects that a temporary network failure has occurred (e.g. the
SGW has failed for 3GPP-EPS access) and the AF requests an AF session
termination in a ST-Request command, the PCRF shall respond with successful
Result-Code AVP to the AF.
NOTE 1: If the AF includes the Required-Access-Info AVP in the ST-Request
command to request the access network information, the PCRF will not include
the access network information in the ST-Answer command.
NOTE 2: Actions over Gx/Gxx reference point when there is a temporary network
failure are described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. For example, for S-GW Restoration
procedures the PCRF will wait for the SGW recovery before deleting the
corresponding PCC/QoS rules,according to clause B.3.14 in that specification.
If the PCRF detects that the PCC/QoS rules related to an AF session cannot be
installed or modified because there is a temporary network failure (e.g. SGW
failed according to clause B.3.14 in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]) and if requested by
the AF, the PCRF shall send a RA-Request command to the AF with the Specific-
Action AVP set to INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION and the content
version of a media component within the Content-Version AVP if it was included
when the media component was provisioned. If the modification of the PCC/QoS
rules fails, the PCRF may provide the status of the related service
information within the Media-Component-Status AVP.
#### 4.4.6.9 PLMN information change Notification
If the AF has successfully subscribed to PLMN_CHANGE notification, the PCRF
shall send an RAR command when the corresponding event occurs, i.e. when the
PLMN where the UE is located has been updated or becomes available. In this
case the RAR from the PCRF shall include the Specific-Action AVP set to
PLMN_CHANGE and include the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP for the PLMN where the UE is
located.
### 4.4.7 P-CSCF Restoration Enhancement Support
This clause is applicable when the PCRF-based P-CSCF Restoration Enhancement,
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.380 [28], is supported by both P-CSCF and PCRF.
The P-CSCF acting as AF shall send an AAR command including the Rx-Request-
Type AVP set to the value PCSCF_RESTORATION (2) to the PCRF in the case P-CSCF
Restoration needs to be performed. This AAR shall include the following
information required by the DRA or PCRF to find the corresponding IP-CAN
session:
\- The UE's IP address as applicable in the Framed-IP-Address AVP or in the
Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP. If the IP address is not unique (e.g. private IPv4
case), the P-CSCF shall also include the IP-Domain-ID AVP if available.
\- If the IP address is not available or if the IP address is not unique and
the IP-Domain-ID is not available, the P-CSCF shall include the IMSI in the
Subscription-Id AVP and the APN in the Called-Station-Id AVP.
The AF shall also include the Auth-Session-State AVP set to the value
NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1) in the AAR command, as described in IETF RFC 6733
[52]. As a consequence, the PCRF shall not maintain any state information
about this session.
The PCRF shall acknowledge the AAR command by sending an AAA command to the
P-CSCF acting as AF and shall include the Auth-Session-State AVP set to
NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1). The PCRF shall send a request for P-CSCF Restoration
to the PCEF for the corresponding IP-CAN session.
### 4.4.8 Priority Sharing Request
If PrioritySharing feature is supported, the AF may include the Priority-
Sharing-Indicator AVP set to PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED within the Media-
Component-Description AVP in order to indicate to the PCRF that the related
media flow is allowed to use the same Allocation and Retention Priority as
media flows which are assigned the same QCI in the PCRF belonging to other AF
sessions for the same IP-CAN session that also contain the Priority-Sharing-
Indicator AVP set to PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED. If the MCPTT-Preemption feature
is supported, the AF may also include the Pre-emption-Capability AVP
containing the suggested pre-emption capability value and the Pre-emption-
Vulnerability AVP containing the suggested pre-emption vulnerability value
within the Media-Component-Description AVP for the PCRF to determine ARP
values and include the Pre-emption-Control-Info AVP containing the pre-emption
control information at the AAR command level for the PCRF to perform pre-
emption control. The AF may also include the
INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION within Specific-Action AVP to
request notification for resource allocation failure. Upon reception of this
information, the PCRF shall behave as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8],
subclauses 4.5.27 and 4a.5.17. For the handling of MCPTT sessions, see Annex
A.13.
NOTE 1: Service data flow deactivation procedures will apply according to
subclause 4.4.6.2.
NOTE 2: This enhancement avoids the risk that a bearer establishment request
is rejected if the maximum number of active bearers is exceeded.
If the AF earlier has indicated a media flow priority sharing to the PCRF by
setting the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP to PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED, the AF
may include the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to
PRIORITY_SHARING_DISABLED within the Media-Component-Description AVP in order
to indicate to the PCRF that the related media flow shall not be part of the
mechanism for sharing the Allocation and Retention Priority with other media
flows any longer.\ If this media flow was in priority sharing with other media
flows the PCRF should readjust the Allocation and Retention Priority for the
remaining services sharing priority as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8],
subclauses 4.5.27 and4a.5.17 and handle the media flow excluded from priority
sharing according to normal PCC/QoS rule provisioning procedures described in
3GPP TS 29.212 [8], subclauses 4.5.2 and 4a.5.2.
If the AF earlier has indicated media flow priority sharing to the PCRF by
setting the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP to PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED for
media flows and the AF indicates to remove one or more of the media flows in
priority sharing with other media flows, the PCRF should readjust the
Allocation and Retention Priority for the remaining services sharing priority
as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], subclauses 4.5.27 and 4a.5.17 and handle
the media flow removed according to normal PCC/QoS rule provisioning
procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], subclauses 4.5.2 and 4a.5.2.
If the AF session being terminated corresponds to a session that included the
Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED within the
Media-Component Description AVP, if the related media flow(s) was in priority
sharing with other media flows the PCRF should readjust the Allocation and
Retention Priority for the remaining services sharing Allocation and Retention
Priority as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] , subclauses 4.5.27 and 4a.5.17
and handle the media flow removed according to normal PCC/QoS rule
provisioning procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], subclauses 4.5.2 and
4a.5.2.
### 4.4.9 Support for media component versioning
The support of the media component versioning is optional. When the
MediaComponentVersioning feature is supported, the AF and the PCRF shall
comply with the procedures specified in this subclause.
If required by operator policies, the AF shall assign a content version to the
media component related to certain service and provide the PCRF within the
Content-Version AVP as part of the Media-Component-Description AVP. Upon each
media component modification, if the content version was assigned to a media
component, the AF shall assign a new content version. In this case, all the
content related to that media component shall be included. The content version
shall be unique for the lifetime of the media component.
NOTE 1: The AF will include all the content of the media component in each
media component modification in order to ensure that the media component is
installed with the proper information regardless of the outcome of the bearer
procedure related to previous interactions that are not reported to the PCRF
yet.
If the PCRF receives the Content-Version AVP including an content version for
certain media component, the PCRF will follow the procedures described in 3GPP
TS 29.212 [8], subclause 4.5.28 and subclause 4a.5.18.
When the PCRF is notified about the outcome of the resource allocation related
to one content version of a media component as described in subclause 4.5.28
or subclause 4a.5.18 in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and if the PCRF is required to
notify the AF, the PCRF shall provide the content version of the media
component within the Content-Version AVP corresponding to the value of content
version of the PCC/QoS rule and the status of the media component within the
Media-Component-Status AVP corresponding to the status of the PCC/QoS rule to
the AF as part of the Flows AVP.
The PCRF shall include more than one Content-Version AVPs for the same media
component within the Flows AVP in a RAR command if it has received multiple
content versions as described in subclause 4.5.28 or subclause 4a.5.18 in 3GPP
TS 29.212 [8].
NOTE 2: The AF will use the content version to identify the media component
version that failed or succeed when multiple provisions of the same media
component occur in a short period of time. How the AF handles such situations
is not specified.
### 4.4.10 Extended bandwidth support for EPC supporting Dual Connectivity
(E-UTRAN and 5G NR)
When the Extended-Max-Requested-BW-NR feature, the Extended-Min-Requested-BW-
NR feature, and/or the Extended-BW-E2EQOSMTSI-NR features are supported,
extended bandwidth AVPs representing bitrates in kbps shall be used to
represent bandwidth values higher than 2\^32-1 bps instead of the bandwidth
AVPs with a maximum value of 2\^32-1 bps that represent bitrates in bps.
For the Extended-Max-Requested-BW-NR feature:
\- Extended-Max-Requested-BW-DL/UL AVPs shall be used instead of Max-
Requested-Bandwidth-DL/UL AVPs.
For the Extended-BW-E2EQOSMTSI-NR feature:
\- Extended-Max-Supported-BW-DL/UL AVPs shall be used instead of Max-
Supported-Bandwidth-DL/UL AVPs.
\- Extended-Min-Desired-BWâ€‘DL/UL AVPs shall be used instead of Min-Desired-
Bandwidth-DL/UL AVPs.
For the Extended-Min-Requested-BW-NR feature:
\- Extended-Min-Requested-BW-DL/UL AVPs shall be used instead of Min-
Requested-Bandwidth-DL/UL AVPs.
For values lower or equal to 2\^32-1 bps AVPs representing bitrates in bps
shall be used.
When the Rx session is being established, if the AF supports the corresponding
feature (as listed above) and needs to indicate bandwidth values higher than
2\^32-1 bps, AVPs representing bitrate in bps shall be provided with value set
to 2\^32-1 bps and bandwidth AVPs representing bitrate in kbps shall be
provided with the actual required bandwidth.
NOTE: When the Diameter session is being established, the originator node does
not know yet the features supported by the peer node.
# 5 Rx protocol
## 5.1 Protocol support
The Rx interface in the present release is based on Rx and Gq protocols
defined for Release 6 as specified in 3GPP TS 29.211 [7] and 3GPP TS 29.209
[5] respectively. However, to be able to separate the policy and charging
rules function (PCRF) of the present release from the **policy decision
function (PDF) and charging rules function (CRF) of Release 6** , the Rx
application in the present release has an own vendor specific Diameter
application.
The Rx application is defined as an IETF vendor specific Diameter application,
where the vendor is 3GPP and the Application-ID for the Rx application in the
present release is 16777236. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
NOTE: A route entry can have a different destination based on the application
identification AVP of the message. Therefore, Diameter agents (relay, proxy,
redirection, translation agents) must be configured appropriately to identify
the 3GPP Rx application within the Auth-Application-Id AVP in order to create
suitable routeing tables.
Tthe Rx application identification shall be included in the Auth-Application-
Id AVP.
With regard to the Diameter protocol defined over the Rx reference point, the
PCRF acts as a Diameter server, in the sense that it is the network element
that handles AF session authorization requests for a particular realm. The AF
acts as the Diameter client, in the sense that is the network element
requesting the authorization of resources for an AF session.
## 5.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between each AF and PCRF
pair is defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment and maintenance of
connections between Diameter nodes is described in IETF RFC 6733 [52].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the AF shall
advertise the support of the Rx specific Application by including the value of
the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of the
3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP
contained in the Capabilitiesâ€‘Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC 6733
[52]).
The termination of the Diameter user session is specified in IETF RFC 6733
[52] in clauses 8.4 and 8.5. The description of how to use of these
termination procedures in the normal cases is embedded in the procedures
description (clause 4.4).
## 5.3 Rx specific AVPs
### 5.3.0 General
Table 5.3.0.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the Rx interface
protocol, their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not
the AVP may be encrypted and which supported feature the AVP is applicable to.
The Vendor-Id header of all AVPs defined in the present document shall be set
to 3GPP (10415).
NOTE: Most of these AVPs have already been defined in 3GPP TS 29.209 [5] for
Rel-6. Their definition is based on the one used for Rel-6 with some possible
modifications to be applied to the Rel-7 protocols.

Time Based Usage monitoring control is applicable for SCTimeBasedUM supported feature. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
### 5.3.1 Abort-Cause AVP
The Abort-Cause AVP (AVP code 500) is of type Enumerated, and determines the
cause of an abort session request (ASR) or of a RAR indicating a bearer
release. The following values are defined:
BEARER_RELEASED (0)
This value is used when the bearer has been deactivated as a result from
normal signalling handling. For GPRS the bearer refers to the PDP Context.
INSUFFICIENT_SERVER_RESOURCES (1)
This value is used to indicate that the server is overloaded and needs to
abort the session.
INSUFFICIENT_BEARER_RESOURCES (2)
This value is used when the bearer has been deactivated due to insufficient
bearer resources at a transport gateway (e.g. GGSN for GPRS).
PS_TO_CS_HANDOVER (3)
This value is used when the PCRF needs to initiate the AF session termination
due to PS to CS handover.
SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY_ DISALLOWED (4)
This value is used in the ASR when the PCRF needs to initiates the AF session
termination due to the operator policy (e.g. disallowing the UE accessing the
sponsored data connectivity in the roaming case).
### 5.3.2 Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP
The Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP (AVP code 501) is of type Address, and
it indicates the IP Address of the network entity within the access network
performing charging (e.g. the GGSN IP address). The Accessâ€‘Networkâ€‘Charging-
Address AVP should not be forwarded over an inter-operator interface.
### 5.3.3 Access-Network-Charging-Identifier AVP
The Access-Network-Charging-Identifier AVP (AVP code 502) is of type Grouped,
and contains a charging identifier (e.g. GCID) within the Access-Network-
Charging-Identifier-Value AVP along with information about the flows
transported within the corresponding bearer within the Flows AVP. If no Flows
AVP is provided, the Accessâ€‘Networkâ€‘Charging-Identifier-Value applies for all
flows within the AF session.
The Access-Network-Charging-Identifier AVP can be sent from the PCRF to the
AF. The AF may use this information for charging correlation with session
layer.
AVP Format:
Access-Network-Charging-Identifier ::= \
{ Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value}
*[ Flows ]
### 5.3.4 Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP
The Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP (AVP code 503) is of type
OctetString, and contains a charging identifier (e.g. GCID).
### 5.3.5 AF-Application-Identifier AVP
The AF-Application-identifier AVP (AVP code 504) is of type OctetString, and
it contains information that identifies the particular service that the AF
service session belongs to. This information may be used by the PCRF to
differentiate QoS for different application services.
For example the AF-Application-Identifier may be used as additional
information together with the Media-Type AVP when the QoS class for the bearer
authorization at the Gx interface is selected. The AF-Application-Identifier
may be used also to complete the QoS authorization with application specific
default settings in the PCRF if the AF does not provide full service
information.
The AF-Application-Identifier AVP may also be used to trigger the PCRF to
indicate to the PCEF/TDF to perform the application detection based on the
operator's policy.
### 5.3.6 AF-Charging-Identifier AVP
The AF-Charging-Identifier AVP (AVP code 505) is of type OctetString, contains
the AF Charging Identifier that is sent by the AF. This information may be
used for charging correlation with bearer layer.
### 5.3.7 Codec-Data AVP
The Codec-Data AVP (AVP code 524) is of type OctetString.
The Codec-Data AVP shall contain codec related information known at the AF.
This information shall be encoded as follows:
\- The first line of the value of the Codec-Data AVP shall consist of either
the word \"uplink\" or the word \"downlink\" (in ASCII, without quotes)
followed by a new-line character. The semantics of these words are the
following:
\- \"uplink\" indicates that the SDP was received from the UE and sent to the
network.
\- \"downlink\" indicates that the SDP was received from the network and sent
to the UE.
NOTE 1: The first line indicates the direction of the source of the SDP used
to derive the information. The majority of the information within the Codec-
Data AVP indicating \"downlink\" describes properties, for instance receiver
capabilities, of the sender of the SDP, the network in this case and is
therefore applicable for IP flows in the uplink direction. Similarly, the
majority of the information within the Codec-Data AVP indicating \"uplink\"
describes properties, for instance receiver capabilities, of the sender of the
SDP, the UE in this case and is therefore applicable for IP flows in the
downlink direction.
\- The second line of the value of the Codec-Data AVP shall consist of either
the word \"offer\" or the word \"answer\", or the word \"description\" (in
ASCII, without quotes) followed by a new-line character. The semantics of
these words are the following:
\- \"offer\" indicates that SDP lines from an SDP offer according to RFC 3264
[18] are being provisioned in the Codec-Data AVP;
\- \"answer\" indicates that SDP lines from an SDP answer according to RFC
3264 [18] are being provisioned in the Codec-Data AVP;
\- \"description\" indicates that SDP lines from a SDP session description in
a scenario where the offer-answer mechanism of RFC 3264 [18] is not being
applied are being provisioned in the Codec-Data AVP. For instance, SDP from an
RTSP \"Describe\" reply may be provisioned.
\- The rest of the value shall consist of SDP line(s) in ASCII encoding
separated by new-line characters, as specified in IETF RFC 4566 [13]. The
first of these line(s) shall be an \"m\" line. The remaining lines shall be
any available SDP \"a\" and \"b\" lines related to that \"m\" line. However,
to avoid duplication of information, the SDP \"a=sendrecv\", \"a=recvonly \",
\"a=sendonly\", \"a=inactive\", \"a=bw-info\", \"b:AS\", \"b:RS\" and \"b:RR\"
lines do not need to be included.
NOTE 2: For backwards compatibility, it is expected that the codec algorithms
in the PCRF described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] allow the introduction of new SDP
lines without rejecting the request when Codec-Data AVP is provided as part of
the Media-Component-Description AVP. The QoS derivation in that case will not
take the new SDP line(s) into account.
### 5.3.8 Flow-Description AVP
The Flow-Description AVP (AVP code 507) is of type IPFilterRule, and defines a
packet filter for an IP flow with the following information:
\- Direction (in or out). The direction \"in\" refers to uplink IP flows, and
the direction \"out\" refers to downlink IP flows.
\- Source and destination IP address (possibly masked).
\- Protocol.
\- Source and destination port.
NOTE 1: When \"ip\" as key word is used in the protocol, the port(s) are used
to describe the port(s) of any protocol if available.
The IPFilterRule type shall be used over Rx interface with the following
restrictions:
\- The Source Port may be omitted to indicate that any source port is allowed.
Lists or ranges shall not be used.
\- Only the Action \"permit\" shall be used.
\- No \"options\" shall be used.
\- The invert modifier \"!\" for addresses shall not be used.
\- The keyword \"assigned\" shall not be used.
NOTE 2: For TCP protocol, destination port can also be omitted.
If any of these restrictions is not observed by the AF, the server shall send
an error response to the AF containing the Experimental-Result-Code AVP with
value FILTER_RESTRICTIONS.
For the Rx interface, the Flow description AVP shall be used to describe a
single IP flow.
### 5.3.9 Flow-Number AVP
The Flow-Number AVP (AVP code 509) is of type Unsigned32, and it contains the
ordinal number of the IP flow(s), assigned according to the rules in Annex B.
### 5.3.10 Flows AVP
The Flows AVP (AVP code 510) is of type Grouped, and it indicates IP flows via
their flow identifiers.
When reporting an out of credit condition, the Final-Unit-Action AVP indicates
the termination action applied to the impacted flows.
If no Flow-Number AVP(s) are supplied, the Flows AVP refers to all Flows
matching the media component number.
When reporting a resource allocation failure related to the modification of
session information, the Media-Component-Status AVP may be included to report
the status of the PCC/QoS rules related to the media component.
The Content-Version AVP(s) shall be included if it was included in the Media-
Component-Description AVP when the corresponding media component was
provisioned.
AVP Format:
Flows::= \
{Media-Component-Number}
*[Flow-Number]
*[ Content-Version ]
[Final-Unit-Action]
[Media-Component-Status]
*[AVP]
### 5.3.11 Flow-Status AVP
The Flow-Status AVP (AVP code 511) is of type Enumerated, and describes
whether the IP flow(s) are enabled or disabled. The following values are
defined:
ENABLED-UPLINK (0)
This value shall be used to enable associated uplink IP flow(s) and to disable
associated downlink IP flow(s).
ENABLED-DOWNLINK (1)
This value shall be used to enable associated downlink IP flow(s) and to
disable associated uplink IP flow(s).
ENABLED (2)
This value shall be used to enable all associated IP flow(s) in both
directions.
DISABLED (3)
This value shall be used to disable all associated IP flow(s) in both
directions.
REMOVED (4)
This value shall be used to remove all associated IP flow(s). The IP Filters
for the associated IP flow(s) shall be removed. The associated IP flows shall
not be taken into account when deriving the authorized QoS.
NOTE 1: The interpretation of values for the RTCP flows in the Rx interface is
described within the procedures in clause 4.4.3.
NOTE 2: The interpretation of values for IMS flows when SIP Forking is
supported is described within the procedures in Annex A.3.1.
### 5.3.12 Flow-Usage AVP
The Flow-Usage AVP (AVP code 512) is of type Enumerated, and provides
information about the usage of IP Flows. The following values are defined:
NO_INFORMATION (0)
> This value is used to indicate that no information about the usage of the IP
> flow is being provided.
RTCP (1)
> This value is used to indicate that an IP flow is used to transport RTCP.
AF_SIGNALLING (2)
> This value is used to indicate that the IP flow is used to transport AF
> Signalling Protocols (e.g. SIP/SDP).
NO_INFORMATION is the default value.
NOTE: An AF may choose not to identify RTCP flows, e.g. in order to avoid that
RTCP flows are always enabled by the server.
### 5.3.13 Specific-Action AVP
The Specific-Action AVP (AVP code 513) is of type Enumerated.
Within a PCRF initiated Re-Authorization Request, the Specific-Action AVP
determines the type of the action.
Within an initial AA request the AF may use the Specific-Action AVP to request
any specific actions from the server at the bearer events and to limit the
contact to such bearer events where specific action is required. If the
Specific-Action AVP is omitted within the initial AA request, no notification
of any of the events defined below is requested at this time.
For one time specific actions, as identified in the value descriptions below,
the AF may also provide the Specific-Action AVP with the applicable one-time-
specific-action value(s) in subsequent AA-Requests. Non-one-time-specific-
action value(s) may only be provided in the initial AA-Request and shall then
be applicable for the entire lifetime of the Rx session.
NOTE 1: One time specific actions are reported once the required action is

### 5.3.16 Media-Component-Description AVP
The Media-Component-Description AVP (AVP code 517) is of type Grouped, and it
contains service information for a single media component within an AF session
or the AF signalling information. The service information may be based on the
SDI exchanged between the AF and the AF session client in the UE. The
information may be used by the PCRF to determine authorized QoS and IP flow
classifiers for bearer authorization and PCC rule selection.
Within one Diameter message, a single IP flow shall not be described by more
than one Media-Component-Description AVP.
Bandwidth information and Flow-Status information provided within the Media-
Component-Description AVP applies to all those IP flows within the media
component, for which no corresponding information is being provided within
Media-Sub-Component AVP(s). As defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9], the bandwidth
information within the media component level Max-Requested-Bandwidth-DL and
Max-Requested-Bandwidth-UL AVPs applies separately to each media subcomponent
except for RTCP media subcomponent.
The mapping of bandwidth information for RTCP media subcomponent is defined in
3GPP TS 29.213 [9] subclause 6.2.
If CHEM feature is supported, Max-PLR-DL AVP and Max-PLR-UL AVP information is
provided within the Media-Component-Description AVP as defined in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9].
If the QoSHint feature is supported the Desired-Max-Latency AVP and/or
Desired-Max-Loss AVP may be provided within the Media-Component-Description
AVP as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9].
If FLUS feature is supported the FLUS-Identifier AVP may be provided within

Bandwidth-UL, Max-Supported-Bandwidth-DL, Min-Desired-Bandwidth-UL, Min-
Desired-Bandwidth-DL, Min-Requested-Bandwidth-UL and Min-Requested-Bandwidth-
DL AVPs only represent bandwidth values up 2\^32-1 bps. To represent higher
values, the Extended-Max-Requested-Bandwidth-UL, Extended-Max-Requested-
Bandwidth-DL, Extended-Max-Supported-Bandwidth-UL, Extended-Max-Supported-
Bandwidth-DL, Extended-Min-Desired-Bandwidth-UL, Extended-Min-Desired-
Bandwidth-DL, Extended-Min-Requested-Bandwidth-UL and Extended-Min-Requested-
Bandwidth-DL AVPs may be used as described in subclause 4.4.10.
If a Media-Component-Description AVP is not supplied by the AF, or if optional
AVP(s) within a Media-Component-Description AVP are omitted, but corresponding
information has been provided in previous Diameter messages, the previous
information for the corresponding IP flow(s) remains valid.
All IP flows within a Media-Component-Description AVP are permanently disabled
by supplying a Flow Status AVP with value \"REMOVED\". The server may delete
corresponding filters and state information.
Reservation-Priority provided within the Media-Component-Description AVP in
the request from the AF applies to all those IP flows within the media
component and describes the relative importance of the IP flow as compared to
other IP flows. The PCRF may use this value to implement priority based
admission. If the Reservation-Priority AVP is not specified the IP flow
priority is DEFAULT (0).
Each Media-Component-Description AVP shall contain either zero, or one, or two
Codec-Data AVPs. In the case of conflicts, information contained in other AVPs
either within this Media-Component-Description AVP, or within the
corresponding Media-Component-Description AVP in a previous message, shall
take precedence over information within the Codec-Data AVP(s). The AF shall
provision all the available information in other applicable AVPs in addition
to the information in the Codec-Data AVP, if such other AVPs are specified.
If the SDP offer-answer procedures of IETF RFC 3264 [18] are applicable for
the session negotiation between the two ends taking part in the communication
(e.g. for IMS), the following applies:
\- The AF shall provision information derived from an SDP answer and shall
also provision information derived from the corresponding SDP offer.
\- If the Media-Component-Description AVP contains two Codec-Data AVPs, one of
them shall represent an SDP offer and the other one the corresponding SDP
answer.
\- If the Media-Component-Description AVP contains one Codec-Data AVP, and
this AVP represents an SDP offer, the AF shall provision the corresponding SDP
answer information in a Codec-Data AVP within a subsequent Rx message.
NOTE 1: Some SDP parameters for the same codec in the SDP offer and answer are
independent of each other and refer to IP flows in opposite directions, for
instance some MIME parameters conveyed within \"a=fmtp\" SDP lines and the
packetization time within the \"a=ptime\" line. Other parameters within the
SDP answer take precedence over corresponding parameters within the SDP offer.
If SDP is applied without using the offer-answer procedures, zero or one
Codec-Data AVP shall be provisioned.
Sharing-Key-DL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-UL AVP provided within the Media-
Component-Description AVP indicates that the media components that include the
same value of the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP may share
resources in the related direction.
NOTE 2: RTCP traffic is not subject to resource sharing.
The Content-Version AVP may be included in order to indicate the content
version of a media component.
The Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP may be included to indicate that the media
component can use the same Allocation and Retention Priority as media flows
which are assigned the same QCI in the PCRF belonging to other AF sessions for
the same IP-CAN session that also contain the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP.
The Pre-emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP may be
included together with Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP for PCRF Allocation and
Retention Priority decision.
The PCRF may provide the Media-Component-Description AVP(s) within the
Acceptable-Service-Info AVP in the AA-Answer command if the service
information received from the AF is rejected. For this usage, the Media-
Component-Description AVP shall only include the appropriate Media-Component-
Number AVP and the Max-Requested-Bandwidth-UL and/or Max-Requested-Bandwidth-
DL AVPs and/ or the Extended-Max-Requested-BW-UL AVP and/or the Extended-Max-
Requested-BW-DL AVP (see subclause 4.4.10) indicating the maximum acceptable

Media-Sub-Component AVP takes precedence over information within the
encapsulating Media Component Description AVP. If a Media-Sub-Component- AVP
is not supplied, or if optional AVP(s) within a Media-Sub-Component AVP are
omitted, but corresponding information has been provided in previous Diameter
messages, the previous information for the corresponding IP flow(s) remains
valid, unless new information is provided within the encapsulating
Mediaâ€‘Component-Description AVP. If Flow-Description AVP(s) are supplied, they
replace all previous Flowâ€‘Description AVP(s), even if a new Flow-Description
AVP has the opposite direction as the previous Flowâ€‘Description AVP. The AF
may also include the ToS-Traffic-Class AVP for requesting Type of Service or
Traffic Class (for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively) based packet filter for the
related flow.

### 5.4.1 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Rx reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The client shall, in the first request of a Diameter session
indicate the set of supported features. The server shall, in the first answer
within the Diameter session indicate the set of features that it has in common
with the client and that the server shall support within the same Diameter
session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list
of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session
establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used
to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise
stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Rx reference point shall
be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features
and associated error handling on the Cx reference point as defined in clause
7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [25].
The base functionality for the Rx reference point is the 3GPP Rel-7 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the Rx commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [25], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [25], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the Rx reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the Rx reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [25]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial and stateless AAR/AAA command pair:
\- If the AF supporting post-Rel-7 Rx functionality is able to interoperate
with a PCRF supporting Rel-7, the AAR shall include the features supported by
the AF within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the 'M' bit cleared. Otherwise,
the AAR shall include the supported features within the Supported-Features
AVP(s) with the M-bit set.
NOTE 1: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the AAR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the
PCRF supports Rel-7 Rx functionality, the AAA command shall not include the
Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both AF and PCRF shall behave as
specified in the Rel-7 version of this document.
\- If the AAR command contains the Supported-Features AVP(s), the PCRF shall
include the Supported-Features AVP(s) in the AAA command, with the 'M' bit
cleared, indicating only the features that both the PCRF and AF support. In
this case, the PCRF should not use the \'M\' bit setting of the Supported-
Features AVP(s) to determine if the AAR is accepted or rejected.
NOTE 2: The client will always declare all features that are supported
according to table 5.4.1.1. When more than one feature identifying a release
is supported by both AF and PCRF, the AF will work according to the latest
common supported release.
Once the PCRF and AF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable to the Rx interfaces for the
feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.

## 5.5 Rx specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
### 5.5.1 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted again.
IETF RFC 6733 [52] specifies the Experimental-Result AVP containing Vendor-ID
AVP and Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The Experimental-Result-Code AVP (AVP
Code 298) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a vendor-assigned value
representing the result of processing a request. The Vendor-ID AVP shall be
set to 3GPP (10415).
Specific values of the Rx specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP are:
INVALID_SERVICE_INFORMATION (5061)
The PCRF rejects new or modified service information the service information
provided by the AF is invalid or insufficient for the server to perform the
requested action.
FILTER_RESTRICTIONS (5062)
The PCRF rejects new or modified service information because the Flow-
Description AVP(s) cannot be handled by the server because restrictions
defined in clause 5.3.8 are not observed.
REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED (5063)
The PCRF rejects new or modified service information because the requested
service, as described by the service information provided by the AF, is not
consistent with either the related subscription information, operator defined
policy rules and/or the supported features in the IP-CAN network.
DUPLICATED_AF_SESSION (5064)
The PCRF rejects a new Rx session setup because the new Rx session relates to
an AF session with another related active Rx session, e.g. if the AF provided
the same AF charging identifier for this new Rx session that is already in use
for the other ongoing Rx session.
IP-CAN_SESSION_NOT_AVAILABLE (5065)
The PCRF rejects a new Rx session setup when it fails to associate the
described service IP flows within the session information received from the AF
to an existing IP-CAN session.
UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION (5066)
The PCRF rejects a new Rx session setup because the session binding function
associated a non-Emergency IMS session to an IP-CAN session established to an
Emergency APN.
UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY (5067)
The PCRF rejects a new Rx session setup because the PCRF can't authorize the
sponsored data connectivity based on the sponsored data connectivity profile
or the operator policy (e.g. the sponsored data connectivity not authorized in
the roaming case).
TEMPORARY_NETWORK_FAILURE (5068)
The PCRF rejects new or modified service information because there is a
temporary failure in the access network (e.g. the SGW has failed).
UNAUTHORIZED_NON_RLOS_SESSION (5069)
The PCRF rejects a new Rx session setup because the session binding function
associated a non-RLOS IMS session to an IP-CAN session established to an RLOS
APN.
### 5.5.2 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to inform a
peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but
may be able to satisfy the request in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [52] are
applicable. Also the following specific Rx Experimental-Result-Code value is
defined for transient failures:
REQUESTED_SERVICE_TEMPORARILY_NOT_AUTHORIZED (4261)
The PCRF temporarily rejects new or modified service information because the
network is temporarily not able to provide the service delivery that the AF
requested, e.g. due to the service information is not consistent with the
operator defined policy rules for the congestion status of the user.
## 5.6 Rx messages
### 5.6.0 General
Existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol IETF RFC 6733
[52] and the NASREQ Diameter application (RFC 4005 [12]) are used with the Rx
specific AVPs. An Rx specific Authâ€‘Application id is used together with the
command code to identify the Rx messages.
NOTE 1: The notion of NAS (Network Access Server) is not used here, NASREQ is
just used for protocol purposes, not for its functional meaning.
NOTE 2: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original Diameter Base Protocol IETF RFC 6733 [52].
NOTE3: Multiple instances of the Subscription-Id AVP in the AAR or RAR command
correspond to multiple types of identifier for the same subscriber, for
example IMSI and MSISDN.

###### ## Annex A (normative): IMS Related P-CSCF Procedures over Rx
# A.1 Provision of Service Information at P-CSCF
The P-CSCF shall send service information to the PCRF upon every SIP message
that includes an SDP answer payload for the purpose of authorizing the IP
flows and the QoS resources required for a negotiated IMS session, unless the
SDP payload only relates to a circuit-switched bearer (i.e. \"c=\" line set to
\"PSTN\" and an \"m=\" line set to \"PSTN\", refer to 3GPP TS 24.292 [26]).
The service information shall be derived both from the SDP offer and the SDP
answer. This ensures that the PCRF receives proper information to perform
media authorization for all possible IMS session set-up scenarios, and that
the PCRF is also capable of handling session modifications. The P-CSCF may
include the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to
FINAL_SERVICE_INFORMATION.
Additionally, the P-CSCF may send service information to the PCRF when
receiving a SIP message that includes an SDP offer payload for the purpose of
performing an early bandwidth authorization check, or for enabling pre-
authorization for a UE terminated IMS session establishment or modification
with UE initiated resource reservation, or for the retrieval of network
provided access network information (see clause A.10.2). The P-CSCF shall send
service information to the PCRF when receiving a SIP message that includes an
SDP offer payload when the IMS session is an MPS session that requires
priority treatment. For a UE terminated session the P-CSCF may send the
service information derived from the SDP offer when the SDP offer either does
not include any preconditions information or includes preconditions
information indicating that the local preconditions (i.e. the preconditions
related to the remote peer) are already met. In this case, the P-CSCF shall
derive the service information only from the SDP offer and shall include the
Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to PRELIMINARY SERVICE INFORMATION.
NOTE 1: For a UE terminated session setup, when the SDP offer either does not
include any preconditions information or includes preconditions information
indicating that the local preconditions (i.e. the preconditions related to the
remote peer) are already met, the terminating UE can request a resource
modification prior to sending the SDP answer. Even if the IP address and port
information in the session information derived from the SDP offer can be
insufficient for PCC rule authorization, the policy to handle such UE
initiated requests at the PCRF can take into account the fact that an IMS
session establishment is ongoing, for instance in deciding whether to
authorize the request and in selecting an appropriate charging key and a
gating policy.
The P-CSCF shall derive Flow-Description AVP within the service information
from the SDP as follows:
\- An uplink Flow-Description AVP shall be formed as follows: The destination
address shall be taken from the SDP information received by the P-CSCF in
downlink direction, while the source IP address may be formed from the address
present in the SDP received by the P-CSCF in uplink direction (taking into
account only the 64 bit prefix of the Ipv6 address) Source and destination
ports shall be derived according to rules provided in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9]
clause 6.2.
EXAMPLE 1: Assuming UE A sends an SDP to UE B, the PCRF of UE B uses the
address present in this SDP for the destination address of UE B's uplink Flow-
Description AVP, while the PCRF of the UE A uses the 64 bit prefix of the same
address for the source address of UE A's uplink Flowâ€‘Description AVP. If the
source address is not formed from the 64 bit prefix, the source address shall
be wildcarded.
\- A downlink Flow-Description AVP shall be formed as follows: The destination
address shall be taken from the SDP information received by the P-CSCF in
uplink direction, while the source IP address may be formed (in order to
reduce the possibilities of bearer misuse) from the destination address in the
SDP received by the P-CSCF in downlink direction (taking into account only the
64 bit prefix of the Ipv6 address) Source and destination ports shall be
derived according to rules provided in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
EXAMPLE 2: Assuming UE A sends an SDP to UE B, the PCRF of UE A uses the
address present in this SDP for the destination address of UE A's downlink
Flow-Description AVP, while the PCRF of UE B uses the 64 bit prefix of the
same address for the source address of UE B's downlink Flowâ€‘Description AVP.
If the source address is not formed from the 64 bit prefix, the source address
shall be wildcarded.
The P-CSCF shall derive the bandwidth information within the service
information, from the \"b=AS\" SDP parameter and \"a=bw-info\" SDP parameter,
if available and if the E2EMTSIQOS feature is supported. If \"a=bw-info\" is
used for bandwidth derivation, the P-CSCF shall use the SDP attribute line
that contains the bandwidth properties for the IP version used by the UE, as
detailed in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2. If the received \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute line(s) contain only bandwidth properties for an IP version that is
not used by the UE, the P-CSCF shall re-compute the bandwidth properties for
the used IP version and use that value for the bandwidth derivation as defined
in 3GPP TS 26.114 [41].
NOTE 2: If no IP version is included for any of the \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute lines related to a certain payload type and direction then IPv6 is
assumed for all bandwidth properties related to the same direction and payload
type, on all of the related \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines, see clause 19
of 3GPP TS 26.114 [41].
If \"a=bw-info\" is used for bandwidth derivation and it includes both known
and unknown bandwidth properties, the P-CSCF shall only consider the known
bandwidth properties to derive the bandwidth information and ignore the
unknown ones. If the\" a=bw-info\" line is received with an unknown
directionality, then the entire \"a=bw-info\" line shall be ignored.
For the possibly associated RTCP IP flows, the P-CSCF shall use the SDP
\"b=RR\" and \"b=RS\" parameters, if present, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.213
[9] clause 6.2. The \"b=AS\", \"b=RR\" and \"b=RS\" parameters in the SDP
contain all the overhead coming from the IP-layer and the layers above, e.g.
IP, UDP, RTP and RTCP payload, or IP, UDP and RTCP.
For multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows (as negotiated using the\"a=rtcp-mux\" SDP
attribute defined in IETF RFC 5761 [42], a P-CSCF supporting RTP/RTCP
transport multiplexing shall derive the bandwidth information within the
service information as specified in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] subclause 6.2.
However, if service information is received containing the \"b=TIAS\" SDP
parameter that corresponds to an SDP answer payload, and if the P-CSCF
supports this parameter, the P-CSCF may derive the bandwidth from this
parameter rather than from the \"b=AS\" SDP parameter, as detailed in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
When available, the P-CSCF shall also indicate to PCRF, as a complement to the
Service Information, the IMS Communication Service Identifier within the AF-
Application-Identifier AVP. The originating P-CSCF shall take the IMS
Communication Service Identifier value from the SIP response. The terminating
P-CSCF shall take the IMS Communication Service Identifier value from the SIP
request. Otherwise, the P-CSCF may not be able to provide an IMS Communication
Service Identifier value to the PCRF. The format and specific headers where
IMS communication service identifiers are transported within SIP are defined
in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
NOTE 3: In order to indicate the IMS Communication Service Identifier to the
PCRF, the originating P-CSCF sets the AF-Application-Identifier AVP to the
ICSI contained in the topmost occurance of the \"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\" header
field parameter of the Feature-Caps header field(s) of 18x or 2xx SIP response
(Feature-Caps: *;+g.3gpp.icsi-ref="urn%Aurn-7%A3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel")
and the terminating P-CSCF sets the AF-Application-Identifier AVP to the ICSI
of the P-Asserted-Service header information received in the SIP request (e.g.
P-Asserted-Service: urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel). Since the headers
and the format of the ICSI can vary depending on the case, the PCRF has to be
prepared to accept the complete ICSI information received in different
formats, as described in subclause 7.2A.8.2 in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
Additionally, the P-CSCF may include the Sharing-Key-DL AVP and/or Sharing-
Key-UL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP in order to indicate the
PCRF that resource sharing should apply for the media components in the
related direction with the same value for the Sharing-Key-DL AVP and/or
Sharing-Key-UL AVP.
Additionally, if PrioritySharing feature is supported, the P-CSCF may provide
the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP
as described in subclause 4.4.47.
NOTE 4: The P-CSCF obtains this information from the Application Server as
described in 3GPP TS 23.228 [16], subclause 5.4.7.9.
NOTE 5: RTCP flows are not subject to resource sharing. This requirement
cannot be met for multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows as in this case there is no
mechanism in the current release to distinguish between RTP and RTCP flows.
If the Service-URN AVP does not include an emergency service URN, i.e. a top-
level service type of \"sos\" as specified in IETF RFC 5031 [21] and possibly
additional sub-service information on the type of the emergency service and
the PCRF binds the IMS service session to an IP-CAN session established to an
Emergency APN, the PCRF shall return an AAA command with Experimental-Result-
Code AVP set to the value UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION to the P-CSCF.
Upon receiving an AAA with Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures
defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
NOTE 6: The PCRF determines whether an IP-CAN session is established to an
Emergency APN based on the information received over Gx and operator
configuration.
If the AF-Requested-Data AVP is provided in the AA-Request command indicating
\"EPC-level Identities required\", the PCRF shall provide the available user
information for the IP-CAN session within the Subscription-Id AVP (s) and/or
User-Equipment-Info AVP.
The PCRF may decide not to authorize requested service information. The PCRF
will indicate it to the P-CSCF by sending an AA-Answer with Experimental-
Result-Code AVP set to the value REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED. Upon
receiving an AA-Answer with Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures defined
in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
# A.2 Enabling of IP Flows
## A.2.0 General
Prior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, i.e. until the 2xx response
to the INVITE request is received, the P-CSCF may enable or disable media IP
flows depending on operator policy, thus allowing or forbidding early media in
forward and/or backward direction. The P-CSCF may set the values of the Flow-
Status AVPs derived from the SDP direction attributes as defined in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9] clause 6.2 or set the values of the Flow-Status AVPs considering
the em-param of the P-Early-Media header field according to subclause A.2.1 or
downgrade the values of the Flow-Status AVPs derived from the SDP direction
attribute based on the configuration in the P-CSCF according to subclause
A.2.2. However for multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows (as negotiated using the
\"a=rtcp-mux\" SDP attribute defined in IETF RFC 5761 [42]), a P-CSCF
supporting RTP/RTCP transport multiplexing shall set the Flow-Status set to
\"ENABLED\" to prevent that RTCP is blocked. If the P-CSCF chooses to modify
the values of the Flow-Status AVPs as received from the SDP direction
attribute, the P-CSCF shall store the last received SDP.
When a 2xx response is received, the P-CSCF shall enable all media IP flows
according to the direction attribute within the last received SDP, as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2. When a 2xx response is received
and the P-CSCF previously provided the values of the Flow-Status AVPs
different from the value derived from the SDP direction attribute in the
session information, the P-CSCF shall provide service information with values
of the Flow-Status AVPs corresponding to the last received SDP.
NOTE: In most cases a 2xx response is a 200 (OK) response.
If the P-CSCF receives SDP answers after the completion of the SIP session
set-up, i.e. after the 2xx response to the INVITE request is received, the
P-CSCF shall provide the Flow-Status AVP, based on the last received SDP
answer. The Flow-Status AVP shall be derived from the SDP according to 3GPP TS
29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
## A.2.1 Gate control procedures considering the P-Early-Media header field
Prior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, the P-CSCF may use the em-
param of the P-Early-Media header field defined in IETF RFC 5009 [48] in order
to enable or disable early media in forward and/or backward direction. If the
P-CSCF uses the em-param of the P-Early-Media header field for the gate
control of early media, the P-CSCF shall perform the following procedures.
In the terminating P-CSCF, when a SIP message with the P-Early-Media header
field is received from the UE and the policies configured in the P-CSCF
indicate that the UE is authorized to send early media, then:
1) the P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"ENABLED\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"sendrecv\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received; or
2) the P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"ENABLED-UPLINK\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"sendonly\"; or
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"sendrecv\" or \"sendonly\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received;
or
3) the P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"ENABLED-DOWNLINK\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"recvonly\"; or
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"recvonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"sendrecv\" or \"recvonly\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received;
or
4) the P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"DISABLED\" if either the
received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field or the last received
SDP direction attribute from the UE includes \"inactive\"; or
5) the P-CSCF may set the Flow-Status AVP to \"DISABLED\" or apply the rules
defined in subclause A.2.2 if the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media
header field includes \"sendonly\" or \"recvonly\" and the last received SDP
direction attribute from the UE is \"recvonly\" or \"sendonly\" respectively.
NOTE 1: If the UE is authorized to send early media, the P-CSCF will not
remove or modify the P-Early-Media header field according to 3GPP TS 24.229
[17].
When a SIP message with the P-Early-Media header field is received from the
functional entity within the trust domain, and if:
\- the P-Early-Media header field includes the \"gated\" parameter, then the
P-CSCF may decide not to perform the gate control of early media; or
\- the P-Early-Media header field does not include the \"gated\" parameter,
then the P-CSCF shall perform the following procedures:
1) the P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to\"ENABLED\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional
entity is \"sendrecv\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received; or
2) the P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"ENABLED-DOWNLINK\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional
entity is \"sendonly\"; or
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional
entity is \"sendrecv\" or \"sendonly\" or no SDP direction parameter has been
received; or
3) the P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"ENABLED-UPLINK\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional
entity is \"recvonly\"; or
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"recvonly\"and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional
entity is \"sendrecv\" or \"recvonly\" or no SDP direction parameter has been
received ; or
4) the P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"DISABLED\" if either the
received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field or the last received
SDP direction attribute from the functional entity includes \"inactive\"; or
5) the P-CSCF may set the Flow-Status AVP to \"DISABLED\" or apply the rules
defined in subclause A.2.2 if the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media
header field includes \"sendonly\" or \"recvonly\" and the last received SDP
direction attribute from the functional entity is \"recvonly\" or \"sendonly\"
respectively.
NOTE 2: According to IETF RFC 5009 [48], the non-direction parameter \"gated\"
can be included after the direction parameter (e.g. \"sendrecv\") in the
parameter list. The proxy performing gating of early media can add the
parameter before forwarding the SIP message.
When a SIP message without the P-Early-Media header field is received from
either the functional entity within the trust domain or the UE that is
authorized to send early media, then the P-CSCF may set the Flow-Status AVP to
\"DISABLED\" or apply the rules defined in subclause A.2.2 or apply the rules
defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
NOTE 3: As indicated in IETF RFC 5009 [48] the applicable preconditions need
to be met in order to allow early media in a particular direction.
When a SIP message is received from the functional entity other than the
functional entity within the trust domain or the UE that is authorized to send
early media, then the P-CSCF shall not use the received em-param(s) in the
P-Early-Media header field and may apply the rules defined in subclause A.2.2
or apply the rules defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
NOTE 4: The P-CSCF will remove or modify the P-Early-Media header field in the
above case.
## A.2.2 Gate control procedures based on the configuration in the P-CSCF
Prior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, the P-CSCF may downgrade
the values of the Flow-Status AVPs derived from the SDP direction attributes
based on the configuration in the P-CSCF. If the P-CSCF has the configuration
for the gate control of early media, the P-CSCF shall perform the following
procedures.
NOTE: The gate control of early media can be configured in the P-CSCF per UE
basis.
When the Flow-Status AVP derived from the SDP direction attribute is
\"ENABLED\", then the P-CSCF may downgrade the value of the Flow-Status AVP to
the value \"DISABLED\", \"ENABLED_UPLINK\", or \"ENABLED_DOWNLINK\" based on
the configuration in the P-CSCF.
When the Flow-Status AVP derived from the SDP direction attribute is
\"ENABLED_UPLINK\" or \"ENABLED_DOWNLINK\", then the P-CSCF may downgrade the
value of the Flow-Status AVP to the value \"DISABLED\" based on the
configuration in the P-CSCF.
# A.3 Support for SIP forking
The P-CSCF shall be able to handle forking when PCC is applied. Forking can
occur as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [16]. The related UE procedures are
described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
## A.3.1 PCC rule provisioning for early media for forked responses
When a SIP session has been originated by a connected UE, the P-CSCF may
receive multiple provisional responses due to forking before the first final
answer is received. Multiple early media session may be established during
this process.
The UE and the P-CSCF become aware of the forking only when a subsequent
provisional response arrives for a new early dialogue. After the first early
media session is established, for each subsequent provisional response
establishing an additional early media session,, the P-CSCF shall use an AA
request within the existing Diameter session containing the SIP-Forking-
Indication AVP with value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES and include the service
information derived from the latest provisional response.
The P-CSCF shall also provision the service information derived from any
subsequent SDP offer-answer exchange within an early dialogue (e.g. in PRACK
and OK(PRACK), or UPDATE and OK(UPDATE) ) using an AA request within the
existing Diameter session containing the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value
SEVERAL_DIALOGUES and the derived service information.
When receiving an AA request containing the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with
value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES, the PCRF shall identify the existing authorization
information for that AF session. The PCRF shall send additional PCC Rules or
individual service data flow filters to already provide PCC rules as required
by the Flow Description AVPs within the session information to the PCEF. The
PCRF shall authorize any additional media components and any increased QoS
requirements for the previously authorized media components, as requested
within the service information. The PCRF shall authorize the maximum bandwidth
required by any of the dialogues, but not the sum of the bandwidths required
by all dialogues. Thus, the QoS authorized for a media component is equal to
the highest QoS requested for that media component by any of the forked
responses. The PCRF shall open or close the gates for service flows depending
on the flow status that is being provisioned. However, if a flow ID has been
enabled in uplink or downlink direction or both way within previous service
information, it shall remain enabled even if the PCRF receives service
information that disable this flow ID within an AA request containing the SIP-
Forking-Indication AVP with value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES.
If the P-CSCF provides one or more Media-Component-Description AVP with the
Flow-Status AVP set to \"REMOVED\" for previously authorized media
component(s) the media component shall remain as authorized and the PCRF shall
not take any action on that media component(s).
NOTE: There can be cases where a forked response could not support some of the
media components included in the SDP Offer (e.g. when early session
disposition SDP as described in Annex A.7 applies, the forked response related
to the early session could include the port set to zero for those media
components not related to the early session or when a subsequent SDP Offer-
Answer to indicate that some media is disabled). For those cases the P-CSCF
will indicate the PCRF about the removal of the corresponding media component.
However this media component is already supported by other UEs and the PCRF
needs to maintain the corresponding PCC rules until the final SDP answer is
received in the P-CSCF in order to avoid the release of resources in the
network.
## A.3.2 Updating the provisioned PCC rules at the final answer
The P-CSCF shall store the SDP information for each early dialogue separately
till the first final SIP answer is received. Then the related early dialogue
is progressed to an established dialogue to establish the final SIP session.
All the other early dialogues are terminated. The service information for the
SIP session is updated to match the requirements of the remaining early
dialogue only.
When receiving the first final SIP response, the P-CSCF shall send an AA
request without the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP and include the service
information derived from the SDP corresponding to the dialogue of the final
response. The P-CSCF shall provision the full service information including
the applicable Flow-Description AVP(s) and Flow-Status AVP(s).
When receiving an AA request with no SIP-Forking-Indication AVP or with a SIP-
Forking-Indication AVP with value SINGLE_DIALOGUE, the PCRF shall update
installed PCC Rules information and Authorized-QoS information to match only
the requirements of the service information within this AA request. The PCRF
should immediately remove PCC Rule(s) or individual service data flow filters
not matching IP flow(s) in the updated Service Information, to reduce the risk
for initial clipping of the media stream, and to minimize possible misuse of
resources. The PCRF shall also open or close the gates for service flows
according to the flow status in the received service information.
# A.4 Notification of AF Signalling Transmission Path Status
When the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message from an attached UE,
the P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of the status of the AF Signalling
transmission path using the procedures specified in clause 4.4.5. Once the
P-CSCF has subscribed, the P-CSCF may receive notifications from the PCRF
according to clause 4.4.6.3.
NOTE 1: When the Standardised QCI characteristics as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203
[2] are followed, the QCI for IMS signalling will correspond to a non-GBR
bearer. In this case, the P-CSCF will not receive notifications related to the
Specific-Action with value \"INDICATION_OF_LOSS_OF_BEARER\".
NOTE 2: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency
sessions.
The P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription to notification of the status of the
AF Signalling transmission path when the AF Signalling to that particular user
is terminated (i.e. when the user is de-REGISTERED from the IM CN subsystem).
When the P-CSCF receives a notification of loss of signalling connectivity
from the PCRF, the P-CSCF shall behave as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
# A.5 Indication of Emergency Registration and Session Establishment
When the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message for an IMS emergency
registration or an INVITE SIP message for an emergency session and the P-CSCF
determines that there are no IMS-level roaming interfaces, the P-CSCF may
request the PCRF to provide the EPC-level identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI(SV))
available for that IP-CAN session using the procedure as specified in this
subclause (for an IMS emergency registration) or A.1 (for an IMS emergency
session establishment). An P-CSCF may request the PCRF to provide the EPC-
level identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI(SV)) available for that IP-CAN session
when no service information is available in the AF.To do so, the P-CSCF shall
open an Rx Diameter session with the PCRF for the AF signalling using an AA-
Request command. The P-CSCF shall provide the UE's IP address (using either
the Framed-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP) and the AF-Requested-
Data AVP set to \"EPC-level identities required\". The AF shall include the
Service-URN AVP set to the value \"sos\", in order to indicate that the new AF
session relates to emergency traffic that is not related to a specific
emergency service.
When the PCRF receives an AA-Request command as described in the preceding
paragraphs from the P-CSCF, the PCRF shall perform session binding as
described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9]. When the PCRF receives the Service-URN AVP
indicating an emergency session, the PCRF may apply special policies, for
instance prioritising service flows relating to the AF session or allowing
these service flows free of charge. When the Service-URN AVP indicates that
the AF session relates to emergency traffic and the AF-Requested-Data AVP is
received indicating \"EPC-level Identities required\", the PCRF shall provide
the requested available user information (MSISDN, IMSI) for the IP-CAN session
within the Subscription-Id AVP(s) and/or the IMEI(SV) within the User-
Equipment-Info AVP in the AA-Answer command.
When the P-CSCF receives the AA-Answer with the EPC-level identities from the
PCRF, the P-CSCF stores the information received within the Subscription-Id
AVP(s) and/or User-Equipment-Info AVP provided by the PCRF and behaves as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
NOTE: The user information received within the User-Equipment-Info AVP and/or
Subscription-Id AVP(s) can be used to support PSAP callback functionality for
anonymous IMS emergency sessions. See 3GPP TS 23.167 [53] for further
information.
The P-CSCF may decide to terminate the Rx session at any time. In that case,
the AF shall use a Session-Termination-Request (STR) command to the PCRF,
which shall be acknowledged with a Session-Termination-Answer (STA) command.
A SIP INVITE request can contain a service URN as defined in IETF RFC 5031
[21] within the request URI. If the service within this URN is \"sos\",
possibly with additional sub-service information, the P-CSCF shall provision
this service and sub-service information within the Service-URN AVP towards
the PCRF. The P-CSCF may also provision possible information about other
services received within the service URN.
# A.6 Notification IP-CAN Type Change
When the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message or an INVITE SIP
message from an attached UE, the P-CSCF may request from the PCRF the
information about the type of IP-CAN the UE is attached to using the procedure
specified in clause 4.4.1.
NOTE 1: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency
sessions.
NOTE 2: The P-CSCF can request information about the type of IP-CAN as part of
the SIP session setup when it is only interested in the related information
when the IMS session is ongoing.
If the P-CSCF requests information about the type of IP-CAN, the P-CSCF shall
also subscribe within the same AAR command operation to notifications for
changes of the IP-CAN type used by the UE. The P-CSCF shall include a
Specific-Action AVP in the AAR that is set to the value of IP-CAN_CHANGE.
When the P-CSCF receives the AA-Answer or RA-Request from the PCRF, the P-CSCF
stores the IP-CAN type information received within the IP-CAN-Type AVP and the
RAT type information received within the RAT-Type AVP and AN-Trusted AVP (if
also provided by the PCRF) and behaves as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
The P-CSCF may receive notifications for changes of the IP-CAN type from the
PCRF according to clause 4.4.6.4. When the P-CSCF receives a notification of
the change of the IP-CAN used by the UE, the P-CSCF stores the new IP-CAN type
information and RAT type information and behaves as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229
[17].
NOTE 3: The subscription to receive information about the type of IP-CAN will
be cancelled when the corresponding Rx session is terminated by the AF (i.e.
when the UE is de-REGISTERED or the related SIP call is torn down).
# A.7 Support for Early Session disposition SDP
## A.7.1 General
As a network option, the P-CSCF may support the PCC procedures in the present
Clause to handle \"early session\" disposition type SDP, as standardised in
IETF RFC 3959 [27].
## A.7.2 Service Information Provisioning for Early Media
The P-CSCF can receive \"early session\" disposition SDP in addition to
\"session\" disposition SDP in SIP early dialogues.
The P-CSCF shall then provision service information derived both from the
\"early session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP applying the
procedures in Clauses A.1, A.2, and A.3, and in the present Clause.
The P-CSCF shall apply the mapping rules in Annex B.1.2.2.2 to derive the flow
identifiers from \"early session\" disposition SDP.
If a single media line with one media type (e.g. \"audio\" or \"video\") is
contained in \"early session\" disposition SDP and a single media line with
the same media type is contained in the \"session\" disposition SDP of the
same SIP dialogue, and both media lines describe service flows of the same
directionality (uplink, downlink, or bidirectional), the P-CSCF should
describe those SDP media lines in the same session information media component
(with the same flow ID).
The \"early session\" disposition SDP can also contain media lines of a type
not included in the \"session\" disposition SDP, or several media lines of the
same type. Such media components shall be described in own media components in
the service information.
If the P-CSCF desires to invoke special policies or separate event
notifications for an \"early session\" disposition media line, it may choose
to provision a separate session information media component even if a media
line with the same media type and directionality is contained in \"session\"
disposition SDP.
NOTE 1: A PCRF is then likely to supply separate PCC rules for early media and
the corresponding final media. This may lead to an over provisioning of
resources during call establishment and a subsequent reconfiguration of the
radio bearer, or even to a call failure if the extra resources are not
authorized or available.
If the P-CSCF receives \"early session\" disposition SDP before any
\"session\" disposition SDP and supplies service information derived from the
\"early session\" disposition SDP at this point of time, it shall use
dedicated media components relating only to the \"early session\" disposition
SDP in the service information.
NOTE 2: The \"session\" disposition SDP offer will frequently occur before the
\"early session\" disposition SDP offer, but can also occur in parallel or in
exceptional cases afterwards. The \"session\" disposition SDP answer can be
contained in the same SIP message as the \"early session\" disposition SDP
offer, or can be sent in a 200 OK (INVITE), i.e. after the \"early session\"
disposition SDP answer.
If the P-CSCF includes any media component relating both to \"early session\"
disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP in the service information,
the P-CSCF shall:
\- provision the service information derived from \"early session\"
disposition SDP and the service information derived from \"session\"
disposition SDP in separate Rx AA-Requests, and shall send a new Rx AA-Request
only after any previous Rx AA-Request has been acknowledged; and
\- provision the first service information (either derived from \"early
session\" disposition SDP or \"session\" disposition SDP) without the SIP-
Forking-Indication AVP, or with the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value
SINGLE_DIALOGUE; and
\- provision all subsequent service information during ongoing call
establishment with the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value
SEVERAL_DIALOGUES; and
\- if an SDP answer has been received and Codec-Data AVPs are provisioned
within a Media-Component-Description AVP, provision a Codec-Data AVP derived
from the corresponding offer together with a Codec-Data AVP derived from the
SDP answer.
NOTE 3: The P-CSCF needs to provision the service information derived from
\"early session\" disposition SDP and the service information derived from
\"session\" disposition SDP in separate Rx AA-Requests because the encoding of
the media-component does not allow for the simultaneous provisioning of two
corresponding filters.
NOTE 4: The PCRF will treat service information containing the SIP-Forking-
Indication AVP as described in Clause A.3.
## A.7.3 Updating the Provisioned Service Information when Dialogue is
established
The P-CSCF shall store the SDP information for the \"session\" disposition
type until the first final SIP answer is received. Then the early media
described in the \"early session\" disposition type SDP are terminated.
The P-CSCF shall then update the service information to match the requirements
of the media described in the \"session\" disposition type SDP only:
\- If the P-CSCF included any media component relating both to \"early
session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP in the service
information, the P-CSCF shall send an AA request without the SIP-Forking-
Indication AVP or with a SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value SINGLE_DIALOGUE
and shall include the service information derived from the \"session\"
disposition SDP. The P-CSCF shall provision the full service information
including the applicable Flow-Description AVP(s) and Flow-Status AVP(s).
\- The P-CSCF shall disable any media component(s) in the service information
that relate to early media only by setting their flow status to \"removed\".
## A.8 Provision of Signalling Flow Information at P-CSCF
When the P-CSCF has successfully concluded the initial registration of an
attached UE, i.e., when the P-CSCF has sent to the UE a SIP 200 (OK) response
to the SIP REGISTER request, the P-CSCF may provision information about the
SIP signalling flows between the UE and itself using the procedure specified
in clause 4.4.5a. If the P-CSCF already has an open Rx Diameter session with
the PCRF related to the signalling with the UE, e.g. one that has been opened
according to the procedure described in clause A.6 and/or in clause A.4, the
P-CSCF shall reuse the already open session to provision the SIP Signalling IP
Flow information.
NOTE: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency
sessions.
If the P-CSCF provisions information about SIP signalling flows, the P-CSCF
shall ensure that for each signalling IP flow information it provides, the
Flow-Description AVP shall accurately reflect the IP flow information as seen
in the IP header 'on the wire'. The P-CSCF shall set the value of the AF-
Signalling-Protocol AVP to 'SIP'.
When the P-CSCF de-registers the UE and terminates SIP Signalling to the UE,
the P-CSCF shall de-provision the SIP Signalling IP flow information from the
PCRF as described in clause 4.4.5a.
# A.9 Handling of MPS Session
When the P-CSCF receives an authorised Resource-Priority header field or a
temporarily authorised Resource-Priority header field containing an
appropriate namespace and priority value in SIP signaling, and recognizes the
need for priority treatment as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17], the P-CSCF
shall include the MPS-Identifier AVP and Reservation-Priority AVP in the AAR
command towards the PCRF. The MPS-Identifier AVP shall contain the national
variant for MPS service name indicating an MPS session. The Reservation-
Priority AVP shall include the priority value of the related priority service.
The Reservation-Priority AVP shall be populated with a default value if the
priority value is unknown.
NOTE 1: Various mechanisms can be applied to recognize the need for priority
treatment in the P-CSCF (e.g., based on the dialled digits), according to
national regulation and network configuration, as stated in 3GPP TS 24.229
[17].
NOTE 2: Lowest user priority value is mapped in the corresponding lowest
enumerated value of the Reservation-Priority AVP.
If the P-CSCF supports the Diameter message priority mechanism for an MPS
session, it shall include the DRMP AVP towards the PCRF as described in 3GPP
TS 29.213 [9], Annex J.
NOTE 3: If the P-CSCF supports the Diameter message priority mechanism for an
MPS session, it includes the DRMP AVP with a priority value equivalent to the
Reservation-Priority AVP priority value. Highest user priority value is mapped
in the corresponding lowest enumerated value of the DRMP AVP.
Upon reception of a request that requires MPS treatment, the PCRF shall derive
the PCC/QoS Rules corresponding to the MPS session, as appropriate. The PCRF
shall take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the MPS
session is prioritized, as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], clause 4.5.19.1.3.
When the P-CSCF terminates the MPS session, the PCRF shall delete the PCC/QoS
Rules corresponding to the MPS session. The PCRF shall revoke the actions
related to the prioritization of the MPS session in the corresponding IP-CAN,
as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], clause 4.5.19.1.3.
# A.10 Retrieval of network provided location information
## A.10.1 General
According to Annex E.7 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16], the P-CSCF can use PCC to
retrieve network provided location information. Information flows related to
the distribution of network provided location information within the IMS are
provided in Annex R of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].
This sublause provides optional PCC procedures to support the retrieval of
network provided location information.
The originating P-CSCF can, depending on operator policy, retrieve the user
location and/or UE Time Zone information either before sending the INVITE
towards the terminating side or upon reception of the SDP answer from the
terminating side.
## A.10.2 Retrieval of network provided location information at originating
P-CSCF for inclusion in SIP Request
If the originating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network
provided location information before forwarding a SIP INVITE request, upon
reception of an INVITE/UPDATE request, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-Request
according to clause 4.4.1 (SIP INVITE request) or 4.4.2 (SIP INVITE/UPDATE
request) including:
\- the \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;
and
\- the required access network information within the Required-Access-Info
AVP.
If the SIP INVITE request is an initial SIP INVITE request, the P-CSCF shall
establish an Rx session for the new SIP session with the AA-Request according
to clause 4.4.6.7 (if no session information is included) or 4.4.1 (if
preliminary session information is included).
The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCRF in an
RAR, and should include this access network information in the SIP
INVITE/UPDATE requests that it forwards. When the retrieved access network
information corresponds to the TWAN-Identifier AVP, the P-CSCF may also map
the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier for
routing, as specified in Annex E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].
## A.10.3 Retrieval of network provided location information at originating
P-CSCF for inclusion in SIP response confirmation
If an originating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network
provided location information before forwarding an SDP answer, the P-CSCF
shall apply the following procedures:
Upon reception of an SDP offer, the P-CSCF may send an AA-Request to the PCRF
according to clause A.1 and may include in this AA-request:
\- the \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;
and
\- the required access network information within the Required-Access-Info
AVP.
Upon reception of an SDP answer, the P-CSCF will send an AA-Request to the
PCRF according to clause A.1. If the P-CSCF has not requested access network
information upon reception of the SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall include in this
AA-request:
\- the \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;
and
\- the required access network information within the Required-Access-Info
AVP.
The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCRF in an
RAR, and should include this access network information in the SIP message
with the response confirmation before forwarding it. When the retrieved access
network information corresponds to the TWAN-Identifier AVP, the P-CSCF may
also map the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier
for routing, as specified in Annex E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].
## A.10.4 Retrieval of network provided location information at terminating
P-CSCF
If a terminating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network
provided location information at session establishment and/or modification,
the P-CSCF shall apply the following procedures:
The terminating P-CSCF may request network provided location information upon
reception of a SIP INVITE request : in the following manner:
\- If the SIP INVITE request is an initial SIP INVITE request, the P-CSCF
shall establish an Rx session for the new SIP session with the AA-Request
according to subclause 4.4.6.7 (if no session information is included) or
4.4.1 (if preliminary session information is included).
\- If the SIP INVITE includes an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-
Request including:
\- the \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;
\- the required access network information within the Required-Access-Info
AVP;
\- service information derived from the SDP offer; and
\- the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to PRELIMINARY SERVICE
INFORMATION.
\- If the SIP INVITE includes no SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-
Request including:
\- the \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;
and
\- the required access network information within the Required-Access-Info
AVP.
Upon reception of a SIP response that requires the inclusion of access network
information, if the P-CSCF has not already requested network provided location
information upon reception of the corresponding SIP INVITE, the P-CSCF shall
request network provided location information in the following manner:
\- If an Rx session related to service data has not yet been established, the
P-CSCF shall establish an Rx session for the new SIP session with the AA-
Request according to clause 4.4.6.7 (if no session information is included) or
4.4.1 (if session information is included).
\- If the SIP response includes an SDP answer, the P-CSCF will send an AA-
Request to the PCRF according to clause A.1; the P-CSCF shall include in this
AA-request:
\- the \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;
and
\- the required access network information within the Required-Access-Info
AVP.
\- If the SIP response includes no SDP, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-Request
including:
\- the \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;
and
\- the required access network information within the Required-Access-Info
AVP.
\- If the SIP reponse includes an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-
Request including:
\- the \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;
\- the required access network information within the Required-Access-Info
AVP;
\- service information derived from an SDP offer within the SIP response; and
\- the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to PRELIMINARY SERVICE
INFORMATION.
The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCRF in an
RAR, and should include this access network information in the appropriate SIP
response before forwarding it. When the retrieved access network information
corresponds to the TWAN-Identifier AVP, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved
access network information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as
specified in Annex E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].
## A.10.5 Provisioning of network provided location information at SIP session
release
If a P-CSCF is required by operator policy to include network provided
location information in SIP session release signalling, the P-CSCF shall apply
the following procedures:
Upon reception of a SIP session release request that requires the inclusion of
network provided location information, the P-CSCF will send an ST-Request and
shall include in this request the required access network information within
the Required-Access-Info AVP.
The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCRF in the
corresponding ST-Answer, and should include this access network information
either in the SIP session termination request (at the originating side) or a
reply to the SIP session termination request (at the terminating side). When
the retrieved access network information corresponds to the TWAN-Identifier
AVP, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved access network information to a
Geographical Identifier for routing, as specified in Annex E.8 of 3GPP TS
23.228 [16].
# A.11 Handling of RAN/NAS release cause values
If the P-CSCF is required by operator policy to provide the RAN/NAS release
cause information, it includes this information in the corresponding SIP
message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17] when received from the PCRF (see
clause 4.4.4, 4.4.6.1, 4.4.6.2, 4.4.6.3 and 4.4.6.7).
# A.12 Resource Sharing
The P-CSCF may indicate to the PCRF that media of an AF session may share
resources with media belonging to other AF sessions according to 3GPP TS
23.228 [16].
If the P-CSCF determines that resource sharing is possible, it may at
establishment of a new AF session, include the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or
Sharing-Key-DL AVP indicating that media resources may be shared in the
related direction. The P-CSCF shall assign a distinct value for the Sharing-
Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP for each media component identified by
the Media-Component-Description AVP for the AF session.
NOTE 1: When resource sharing applies to both directions for a certain media
component, the P-CSCF can assign the same value for Sharing-Key-UL AVP and
Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the same media component.
The P-CSCF shall not include the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP
within the Media-Component-Description AVP when the AF session relates to an
Emergency Session.
The PCRF shall not include the Sharing-Key-DL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-UL AVP
for those PCC/QoS Rules related to the RTCP traffic.
Trigger conditions that require applying or stopping resource sharing are
described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
NOTE 2: When P-CSCF needs to stop sharing according to the procedures
described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17], the P-CSCF will provide new values for the
Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP that are not being used by any
other AF sessions for the same user.
# A.13 Handling of MCPTT priority call
## A.13.1 General
Within the framework of MCPTT, when the SIP Core (3GPP TS 23.379 [54]) is
implemented by an IMS core network, if the P-CSCF receives a SIP request
message including a Resource-Priority header field with a namespace field and
priority value defined for MCPTT for adjusting the priority of an MCPTT
session, the P-CSCF shall provide the Reservation-Priority AVP and the MCPTT-
Identifier AVP in the AA-Request command as defined in subclause A.13.2 to
allow the PCRF to set the corresponding PCC rule(s) according to the
prioritized MCPTT service. Additionally, if PrioritySharing feature is
supported, the P-CSCF may provide the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP within
the Media-Component-Description AVP as described in subclause A.1. For MCPTT
the service priority and the priority sharing indicator are defined in 3GPP TS
23.379 [54].
NOTE 1: The process of adjusting priority may occur several times during the
course of one session, e.g. a normal MCPTT group call elevated to an MCPTT
emergency group call, returned to a normal priority MCPTT group call, elevated
to an MCPTT imminent peril group call and returned to a normal priority MCPTT
group call.
NOTE 2: Upon reception of a request that requires the adjustment of the MCPTT
priority, the PCRF is expected to derive the PCC Rules corresponding to the
this MCPTT session, as appropriate according to operator policies.
NOTE 3: The PCRF can identify an MCPTT call using the IMS Communication
Service Identifier specific to MCPTT, which is provided by the P-CSCF in the
AF-Application-Identifier AVP in the AA-Request sent to PCRF.
## A.13.2 Determination of MCPTT priority parameter values
When the P-CSCF receives an authorized Resource-Priority header field
containing an appropriate namespace and priority value used for MCPTT in SIP
signaling, the P-CSCF shall include the MCPTT-Identifier AVP and Reservation-
Priority AVP in the AAR command towards the PCRF.
The MCPTT-Identifier AVP shall include the namespace defined for MCPTT as
received within the Resource-Priority header field.
NOTE: Two different values are defined for the MCPTT-Identifier AVP, one for
each namespace value defined for MCPTT (see IETF RFC 8101 [45]).
The Reservation-Priority AVP shall contain the priority value of the Resource-
Priority header; the lowest priority shall be mapped to to DEFAULT (0), the
next after the lowest to PRIORITY-ONE (1), and so on up to the highest
priority which shall be mapped to PRIORITY-FIFTEEN (15).
Additionally, when the P-CSCF receives information about priority sharing from
an MCPTT server that supports simultaneous sessions and that needs to share a
common priority for several MCPTT sessions and if PrioritySharing feature is
supported, the P-CSCF may include the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP within
the Media-Component-Description AVP in the AAR command. See 3GPP TS 23.379
[54] for further information.
# A.14 Notification of PLMN Change
When the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message from an attached UE,
the P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of PLMN ID changes corresponding to
the PLMN where the UE is located using the procedure specified in subclause
4.4.6.9.
When the P-CSCF receives the AA-Answer or RA-Request from the PCRF, the P-CSCF
stores the PLMN identifier received within 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP and behaves
as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
The P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription to notification for changes of the
PLMN used by the UE when the user is de-registered from the IM CN subsystem.
# A.15 Handling of MCVideo priority call
## A.15.1 General
Within the framework of MCVideo, when the SIP Core (3GPP TS 23.281 [6x]) is
implemented by an IMS core network, if the P-CSCF receives a SIP request
message including a Resource-Priority header field with a namespace field and
priority value defined for MCVideo for adjusting the priority of an MCVideo
session, the P-CSCF shall provide the Reservation-Priority AVP and the
MCVideo-Identifier AVP in the AA-Request command as defined in subclause
A.1x.2 to allow the PCRF to set the corresponding PCC rule(s) according to the
prioritized MCVideo service.
NOTE 1: The process of adjusting priority may occur several times during the
course of one session, e.g. a normal MCVideo group call elevated to an MCVideo
emergency group call and returned to a normal priority MCVideo group call,
elevated to an MCVideo imminent peril group call and returned to a normal
priority MCVideo group call.
NOTE 2: Upon reception of a request that requires the adjustment of the
MCVideo priority, the PCRF is expected to derive the PCC Rules corresponding
to the this MCVideo session, as appropriate according to operator policies.
NOTE 3: The PCRF can identify an MCVideo call using the IMS Communication
Service Identifier specific to MCVideo, which is provided by the P-CSCF in the
AF-Application-Identifier AVP in the AA-Request sent to PCRF.
## A.15.2 Determination of MCVideo priority parameter values
When the P-CSCF receives an authorized Resource-Priority header field
containing an appropriate namespace and priority value used for MCVideo in SIP
signaling, the P-CSCF shall include the MCVideo-Identifier AVP and
Reservation-Priority AVP in the AAR command towards the PCRF.
The MCVideo-Identifier AVP shall include the namespace defined for MCVideo as
received within the Resource-Priority header field.
The Reservation-Priority AVP shall contain the priority value of the Resource-
Priority header; the lowest priority shall be mapped to to DEFAULT (0), the
next after the lowest to PRIORITY-ONE (1), and so on up to the highest
priority which shall be mapped to PRIORITY-FIFTEEN (15).
# A.16 Support for volume based charging of IMS services
As a network option, when VBC feature is supported, the P-CSCF may be able to
indicate to the PCRF the establishment and termination of specific IMS
communication services (e.g. CAT and voice calls, 3PTY conference) or the
establishment and termination of different communication dialogues to separate
parties. This enables PCC to apply different Policy and Charging control.
During AF session establishment, the P-CSCF may include the IMS-Content-
Identifier AVP and the IMS-Content-Type AVP in the AAR command towards the
PCRF. The PCRF derives the PCC rules to categorise the service data flows by
rating group or combination of rating group and service id.
During AF session modification, the P-CSCF may include the IMS-Content-
Identifier AVP and the IMS-Content-Type AVP in the AAR command towards the
PCRF. The PCRF updates the PCC rules to categorise the service data flows by
rating group or combination of rating group and service id.
The IMS-Content-Type AVP indicates the type of IMS content of a session
component. The P-CSCF determines the type of IMS content as follows:
\- If the SDP payload refers to the Customized Alerting Tones (CAT) service
(i.e. SDP body contains a media-level \"a=content\" SDP attribute with a value
\"g.3gpp.cat\" defined in 3GPP TS 24.182 [62]), the P-CSCF sets the IMS-
Content-Type AVP with the value \"CAT\".
\- If the SDP payload refers to the 3PTY conference service (i.e. SDP body
contains an \"a=content\" media-level attribute line with value of
\"g.3gpp.conf\" defined in 3GPP TS 24.147 [63]), the P-CSCF sets the IMS-
Content-Type AVP with the value \"CONFERENCE\".
\- Otherwise, the P-CSCF sets the IMS-Content-Type AVP with the value
\"NO_CONTENT_DETAIL\".
The IMS-Content-Identifier AVP contains information that identifies a
particular IMS communication service or a particular communication dialogue in
the IMS session. This information may be used by the PCRF to apply different
charging characteristics to the different parties in a 3PTY conference
scenario.
As a network option, if VBCLTE feature is further supported, the P-CSCF shall
be able to indicate to the PCRF caller and callee information.
During AF session establishment, the P-CSCF may include the Calling-Party-
Address AVP and the Callee-Information AVP in the AAR command towards the
PCRF. The PCRF derives the PCC rules including the information of caller and
callee.
During AF session modification, the P-CSCF may include the Callee-Information
AVP in the AAR command towards the PCRF. The PCRF updates the PCC rules to
categorise the service data flows by rating group or combination of rating
group and service id.
The Calling-Party-Address AVP indicates the caller of the IMS service. The
P-CSCF determines the caller as defined in subclause 7.2.33 of 3GPP TS 32.299
[24].
The Callee-Information AVP indicates the callee of the IMS service. The P-CSCF
determines the callee as follows:
> \- The Called-Party-Address holds the address of the party (Public User ID
> or Public Service ID) to whom the SIP transaction is posted in the context
> of an end-to-end SIP transaction as defined in subclause 7.2.32 in 3GPP TS
> 32.299 [24].
>
> \- The Requested-Party-Address holds the address of the party (Public User
> ID or Public Service ID) to whom the SIP transaction was originally posted
> as defined in subclause 7.2.176 in 3GPP TS 32.299 [24].
NOTE: This AVP is only applicable when the ATCF is collocated with the P-CSCF.
> \- The Called-Asserted-Identity holds the address or addresses (SIP URI
> and/or Tel URI) of the party (Public User ID or Public Service ID) of the
> finally asserted called party as defined in subclause 7.2.31 of 3GPP TS
> 32.299 [24].
# A.17 Indication of Restricted Local Operator Services Support
RLOS is an optional feature supported in certain countries. Service
requirements of RLOS are defined in 3GPP TS 22.101 [65] and the architectural
requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 23.221 [66]. The RLOS stage 2 services
description for the Evolved Packet System (EPS) is specified in 3GPP TS 23.401
[67]. The policy and charging control architecture is described in 3GPP TS
23.203 [2].
RLOS may be supported as described in subclause A.5 with the following
differences:
\- emergency registration is replaced by RLOS registration;
\- emergency session is replaced by RLOS session;
\- emergency traffic is replaced by RLOS traffic;
\- value \"sos\" is replaced by \"g.3gpp.rlos\";
\- UNAUTHORIZED_NON_RLOS_SESSION session is returned when the service-URN AVP
does not include an RLOS value, and the PCRF binds the IMS session to an IP-
CAN established to an RLOS APN;
\- RLOS services are not prioritized services; and
\- the call back functionality is not required.
# A.18 Coverage and Handoff Enhancements using Multimedia error robustness
feature (CHEM)
As a network option, the P-CSCF may support the PCC procedures in the present
clause to handle the Coverage and Handoff Enhancements using Multimedia error
robustness feature (CHEM)
NOTE 1: When the CHEM feature is supported, improved error robustness can be
enabled by packet-loss handling procedures of the codec, codec mode, or codec
configuration to avoid, delay, or reduce the need to handoff a terminal due to
degradation in the media quality. Communicating the level of robustness of the
media to the network enables the eNB to use this information to determine a
threshold for when the terminal should be handed off to another cell, domain
(circuit-switched vs. packet-switched), or radio access technology.
When a session is initiated or modified the P-CSCF supporting the CHEM feature
shall derive the Max-PLR-DL AVP and Max-PLR-UL AVP based on the PLR_adapt and
maxe2e-PLR attribute values in both the SDP offer and/or SDP answer to
determine the maximum tolerable end-to-end PLR budget distributed across the
uplink and downlink in a media transport path as described in 3GPP TS 29.213
[9] clause 6.2.
Upon reception of SDP offer and answer, P-CSCF should check whether a=
PLR_adapt line is present in both SDP offer and answer to derive Max-PLR-DL
and Max-PLR-UL AVP in Media-Component-Description AVP else downlink and uplink
maximum packet loss are not included by AF.
The originating P-CSCF should derive Max-PLR-DL AVP to the maximum value of
Max-PLR-DL among all the RTP payload types. For each RTP payload type Max-PLR-
DL is computed as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP offer then Max-PLR-DL for a payload
type is derived as value of maxe2e-PLR in the SDP offer - maxUL-PLR in the SDP
answer if present else the default value is Â½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the
SDP offer.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP offer then then Max-PLR-DL for a
payload type is derived from the default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-
End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in
3GPP TS 26.114 [41] clause X.1.2 for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for
partial redundancy - maxUL-PLR in the SDP answer if present else the default
value is Â½ default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for
the decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [41].
The originating P-CSCF should derive Max-PLR-UL AVP to the maximum value of
Max-PLR-UL among all the RTP payload types. For each RTP payload type Max-PLR-
UL is computed as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP answer then Max-PLR-UL for a payload
type is derived as value of maxe2e-PLR in the SDP answer - maxDL-PLR in the
SDP ANSWER if present else the default value is Â½ maxe2e-PLR value present in
the SDP answer.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP answer then then Max-PLR-UL for a
payload type is derived as the Â½ default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-
End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in
3GPP TS 26.114 [41] clause X.1.2 for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for
partial redundancy.
The terminating P-CSCF should derive Max-PLR-DL AVP to the maximum value of
Max-PLR-DL among all the RTP payload types. For each RTP payload type Max-PLR-
DL is computed as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP answer then Max-PLR-DL for a payload
type is derived as value of value of maxDL-PLR in the SDP answer if present
else the default value is Â½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP answer.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP answer then then Max-PLR-DL for a
payload type is derived as the Â½ default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-
End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in
3GPP TS 26.114 [41] clause X.1.2 for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for
partial redundancy.
The terminating P-CSCF should derive Max-PLR-UL AVP to the maximum value of
Max-PLR-UL among all the RTP payload types. For each RTP payload type Max-PLR-
UL is computed as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP offer then Max-PLR-UL for a payload
type is derived as value of value of maxUL-PLR in the SDP answer if present
else the default value is Â½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP offer.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP offer then then Max-PLR-UL for a
payload type is derived as the Â½ default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-
End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in
3GPP TS 26.114 [41] clause X.1.2 for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for
partial redundancy.
# A.19 Handling of a FLUS session
If the P-CSCF receives a SIP request that requires provisioning of service
information to the PCRF, the \"FLUS\" feature is supported and an SDP
attribute \"a=label:flus...\" is included in one or more of the received SDP
media descriptions, the P-CSCF shall provide the string after \"a=label:\"
starting with \"flus\" within the FLUS-Identifier AVP within the affected
Media-Component-Description AVP(s) in the AA-Request to the PCRF.
NOTE: During the first interaction with the PCRF, the P-CSCF does not know if
the \"FLUS\" feature is supported by the PCRF. In this case the P-CSCF will
include the information as if supported.
If additionally the P-CSCF receives the \"a=3gpp-qos-hint\" media-level SDP
attribute in the SIP request, the P-CSCF shall provide the PCRF with the
Desired-Max-Latency AVP and/or Desired-Max-Loss AVP as described in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9], subclause 6.2.
Upon receiving the information from the P-CSCF and if the \"FLUS\" feature is
supported, the PCRF shall derive the QoS information as described in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9], subclause 6.3.
# A.20 QoS hint support for data channel media
If the P-CSCF receives a SIP request that requires provisioning of a service
information to the PCRF, the QoSHint feature is supported and an SDP attribute
\"a=3gpp-qos-hint\" is included in one or more of the received data channel
media descriptions, the P-CSCF may provide the Desired-Max-Latency AVP and/or
Desired-Max-Loss AVP for each affected application media component within the
Media-Component-Description AVP(s) in the AA-Request to the PCRF.
NOTE: During the first interaction with the PCRF, the P-CSCF does not know if
the QoSHint feature is supported by the PCRF. In this case the P-CSCF will
include the information as if supported.
Upon receiving the information from the P-CSCF and if the QoSHint feature is
supported, the PCRF shall derive the QoS information as described in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9], subclause 6.3.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Flow identifiers: Format definition and
examples
# B.1 Format of a flow identifier
## B.1.1 General
A flow identifier is expressed as a 2-tuple as follows:
\
where both are numbered starting from 1. The encoding of the flow identifier
is as indicated in 3GPP TS 24.008 [12].
If UE and AF share an algorithm for a given application, which guarantees that
UE and AF assign the same ordinal number to each media component, the ordinal
numbers of the IP Flows within a media component shall be assigned according
to the following rules:
\- All IP flow(s) or bidirectional combinations of two IP flow(s) within the
media component, for which a downlink destination port number is available,
shall be assigned ordinal numbers in the order of downlink destination port
numbers.
\- All IP flows, where no downlink destination port number is available, shall
be assigned the next higher ordinal numbers in the order of uplink destination
port numbers.
The ordinal number of a media component shall not be changed when the session
description information is modified.
If no SDI with fixed and unique positions for media components is exchanged
between UE and AF, the UE and AF may assign the ordinal numbers of the media
components in another application-dependent algorithm which guarantees that UE
and AF assign the same ordinal number to each media component.
If UE and AF do not share an algorithm for a given application, which
guarantees that UE and AF assign the same ordinal number to each media
component, the ordinal number of the media component shall be set to zero and
the ordinal number of the IP flows shall be assigned according to the
following rules:
1\. If ordinal numbers for several IP flows are assigned at the same time, all
uplink IP flows shall be assigned lower ordinal number than all downlink IP
flows.
2\. If ordinal numbers for several IP flows are assigned at the same time, all
uplink and all downlink IP flows shall separately be assigned ordinal numbers
according to increasing internet protocol number assigned by IANA (e.g. 6 for
TCP and 17 for UDP)
3\. If ordinal numbers for several IP flows are assigned at the same time, for
each internet protocol with a port concept, all uplink and all downlink IP
flows of this internet protocol shall separately be assigned ordinal numbers
according to increasing port numbers.
4\. If IP flows are removed from an existing session, the previously assigned
binding info shall remain unmodified for the remaining IP flows.
5\. If IP flows are added to an existing session, the previously assigned
binding info shall remain unmodified and the new IP flows shall be assigned
ordinal numbers following the rules 1. To 3., starting with the first
previously unused ordinal number. The numbers freed in step 4. Shall not be
reused.
If the IP flows correspond to AF signalling (e.g. SIP signalling IP Flows),
and no IP flow information is provided both the ordinal number of the media
component and the IP flows shall be set to zero. In the case when the IP flow
information of the AF signalling is provided, the ordinal number of the media
component will be set to zero, and the ordinal number(s) of the IP flows shall
follow the rules set above for the case when the UE and AF do not share an
algorithm for a given application.
## B.1.2 Derivation of Flow Identifiers from SDP
### B.1.2.1 Standard Procedure
The procedure in Table B.1.2.1.1 shall be applied for SDP of \"session\"
disposition type within SIP and for all SDP outside SIP.
Table B.1.2.1.1: Standard Procedure to derive Flow Identifiers from SDP
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | The ordinal number of the | The ordinal number of the IP | | position of the media component | flow(s) within the media | | | component description | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | The ordinal number of the | The ordinal number of the IP | | position of the \"m=\" line in | flow(s) within the \"m=\" line | | the SDP | assigned in the order of | | | increasing downlink destination | | | port numbers, if downlink | | | destination port numbers are | | | available.

### B.1.2.2 SDP with \"early session\" disposition type
The procedure in Table B.1.2.2.1 shall be applied for SDP of \"early session\"
disposition type within SIP. The \"early session\" disposition type is
specified within IETF RFC 3959 [27].
Table B.1.2.2.1: Procedure to derive Flow Identifiers from \"early session\"
disposition SDP
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | The ordinal number of the | The ordinal number of the IP | | position of the media component | flow(s) within the media | | | component description | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | If a single media component with | As in table B.1.2.1.1. | | one media type (e.g. \"audio\" | | | or \"video\") is contained in | | | \"early session\" disposition | | | SDP and a single media component | | | with the same media type is | | | contained in the \"session\" | | | disposition SDP of the same SIP | | | dialogue, and if both SDP media | | | components are described in a | | | single Rx service information | | | media component, that Rx service | | | information media component | | | shall obtain the media component | | | number derived from \"session\" | | | disposition SDP following the | | | rules in table B.1.2.1.1. | | | | | | Otherwise each media component | | | shall obtain the ordinal number | | | of the position of the \"m=\" | | | line in the \"early session\" | | | disposition SDP plus 1000 as | | | media component ordinal number. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

# B.4 Example 3 without media components.
The UE and AF do not exchange SDP for an application and do not share an
algorithm, which guarantees that UE and AF assign the same ordinal number to
each media component.
At the AF session initiation, the UE and AF agree to set up the following IP
flows:
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 100.
\- Downlink UDP flow with destination port 100.
\- Downlink TCP flow with destination port 100.
\- Uplink TCP flow with destination port 100.
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 200.
The following binding info is assigned to these IP flows.
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 100: (0, 2)
\- Downlink UDP flow with destination port 100: (0, 5)
\- Downlink TCP flow with destination port 100: (0, 4)
\- Uplink TCP flow with destination port 100: (0, 1)
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 200: (0, 3)
At a later stage in the session, the TCP IP flows are removed and the
following IP flows are added:
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 150.
\- Downlink UDP flow with destination port 50.
The following binding info is assigned to the IP flows existing at this stage:
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 100: (0, 2)
\- Downlink UDP flow with destination port 100: (0, 5)
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 200: (0, 3)

###### ## Annex C (informative): Void
###### ## Annex D (normative): Monitoring Related SCEF Procedures over Rx
# D.1 Monitoring events support, using SCEF procedures over Rx
If SCS/AS has requested monitoring of events and operator policies in the SCEF
indicate that monitoring shall be performed via PCRF, the SCEF shall initiate
the applicable Rx procedures acting as an AF as described in 3GPP TS 23.682
[40].
The following monitoring events are supported;
\- Location reporting according to the Access Network Information Report
procedures described in subclause 4.4.6.7. This functionality requires the
support of NetLoc, NetLoc-Untrusted-WLAN and/or NetLoc-Trusted-WLAN supported
features.
\- Communication Failure reporting as described in subclauses 4.4.4, 4.4.6.2
and 4.4.6.3. This functionality requires the support of RAN-NAS-Cause
supported feature.
###### ## Annex E (normative): Interworking with 5GS via Rx interface
# E.1 General
In the 5GS the Rx reference point is defined between the the PCF and the AF.
The relationship between the involved functional entities is depicted in
figure E.1.1. The overall PCC architecture is depicted in clause 4 of 3GPP TS
29.513 [59].
Figure E.1.1: Rx reference model in 5GS
5GS supports an interworking with AFs via the Rx interface. Interworking with
AFs related to existing IMS services is described in 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].
Interworking with AFs related to existing Mission Critical services is
described in TS 23.280 [60]. The PCF in 5GS supports the corresponding Rx
procedures and requirements defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2]. The stage 2
requirements for 5GS supporting Rx interface are described in 3GPP TS 23.503
[56].
The PCF exchanges PCC rules with the SMF over the N7 interface as specified in
3GPP TS 29.512 [57].
Signalling flows related to the both Rx and N7 interfaces are specified in
3GPP TS 29.513 [59].
The generic mechanisms for interaction between the AF and the PCF are
described in main subclauses in this specification and with the following
clarifications:
\- description of the PCRF and the PCEF applies to the PCF and the SMF
respectively;
\- description of the SPR applies to the UDR;
\- BBERF is not applicable in 5GS;
\- an IP-CAN bearer in this specification shall be interpreted as a 5GS QoS
flow;
\- an IP-CAN session in this specification shall be interpreted as a 5GS PDU
session of type IP;
\- APN is equivalent to DNN;
\- the following values of the Specific-Action AVP defined in subclause 5.3.13
are applicable only to a PCF: EPS_FALLBACK (17) and
INDICATION_OF_REALLOCATION_OF_CREDIT (18);
\- when the serving network is an SNPN and the serving network information is
provided to the AF, the NID may optionally be part of the serving network
identifier, as specified in clause E.5; and
\- the 5G-RAN-NAS-Release-Cause AVP defined in subclause 5.3.69 is applicable
only to a PCF. When the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported, it encodes the 5GS
RAN cause and/or NAS cause, when available.
# E.2 Mapping table for IP-CAN types and Access types
Table E.2-1 maps the values of the Access types and RAT types used for N7
interface in 3GPP TS 29.512 [58] with the values of the IP-CAN types and RAT

# E.3 Reporting EPS Fallback
When the feature \"EPSFallbackReport\" is supported, if the AF requests the
PCF to report EPS Fallback, the AF shall subscribe to the \"EPS_FALLBACK\"
within the Specific-Action AVP as described in subclause 5.3.13. The AF shall
request the PCF to report the EPS Fallback in conjuction with providing the
PCF with the AF session information as described in subclause 4.4.1 for the
initial provisioning of session information, and the subscription to
\"EPS_FALLBACK\"shall apply for voice media type requests along the AF session
lifetime.
When the PCF then receives the EPS Fallback indication from the SMF, the PCF
shall provide the corresponding EPS Fallback indication to the AF by sending
an RAR (re-authorization request) command. The RAR command shall include the
EPS_FALLBACK cause encoded in the Specific-Action AVP.
When the AF receives the RAR command, it shall acknowledge the command by
sending an RAA (re-authorization answer) command to the PCF.
# E.4 IP-CAN type change Notification for a MA PDU session
If the AF has successfully subscribed to change notifications in UE's IP-CAN
type and RAT type, the ATSSS feature is supported and the PDU session is a MA
PDU session:
\- if the PCF previously requested to the SMF to be updated with access type
changes, the PCF shall include in the AAA command:
i. the IP-CAN-Type AVP, RAT-Type AVP (if applicable) for the UE's IP-CAN/RAT
type values; and
ii. if both, 3GPP and non-3GPP access information is available, the additional
IP-CAN type information and RAT type information (if available) in the MA-
Information AVP;
\- otherwise, the PCF shall subscribe to access type changes as described in
subclause 4.2.6.4 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [57] and shall send an RAR command when
the corresponding IP-CAN event occurs, i.e.:
a) when a UE's IP-CAN type or RAT type (if applicable) changes; or
b) a new IP-CAN type and RAT type (if applicable) become available for the UE
and the MA PDU session; or
c) an IP-CAN type and RAT type (if applicable) become unavailable (are
released) for the UE and the MA PDU session.
The RAR from the PCF shall include the Specific-Action AVP for the subscribed
event and:
a. if it is the first IP-CAN change report:
i. the IP-CAN-Type AVP, RAT-Type AVP (if applicable) for the UE's IP-CAN/RAT
type values; and
ii. if both, 3GPP and non-3GPP access information is available, the additional
IP-CAN type information and RAT type information (if available) in the MA-
Information AVP;
b. if it is a subsequent IP-CAN change report:
i. if a new IP-CAN type is added to the MA PDU session, the MA-Information AVP
with the added IP-CAN type information encoded in the IP-CAN-Type AVP and the
RAT type information encoded within the RAT-Type AVP if applicable;
ii. if an IP-CAN type is released in the MA PDU session, the MA-Information
AVP with the released IP-CAN type information encoded in the IP-CAN-Type AVP,
the RAT type information encoded within the RAT-Type AVP, if applicable, and
the MA-Information-Action AVP set to 1 (RELEASE).
NOTE: For a MA PDU session, if the ATSSS feature is not supported by the AF
the PCF includes the IP-CAN-Type AVP and the RAT-Type AVP with a currently
active combination of IP-CAN type and RAT type (if applicable for the notifed
access type). When both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses are available, the PCF
includes the information corresponding to the 3GPP access.
# E.5 Reporting serving network identity
When a new AF session is being established as described in subclause 4.4.1 or
is being modified as described in subclause 4.4.2, the AAA command shall also
contain the PLMN identifier within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP and, if
available, the NID within the NID AVP if the PCF has previously requested the
SMF to be updated with the serving network identity.
NOTE: The combination of a PLMN identifier and a NID identifies an SNPN, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [55] subclause 5.30.2.
When the AF initiates a session termination, the PCF shall include in the STA
command the PLMN identifier within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP and, if
available, the NID within the NID AVP:
\- if the PCF received an ST-Request from the AF, indicating an AF session
termination and if location info is not available, as specified in subclause
4.4.4; and
\- if the AF requested the PCF to report the access network information, the
Rx session is being terminated and if location info is not available, as
specified in subclause 4.4.6.7.
When the PCF needs to inform the AF about a traffic plane event, the PCF shall
include in the RAR command the PLMN identifier within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC
AVP and, if available, the NID within the NID AVP:
\- when the PCF gets the knowledge that one or more SDFs have been
deactivated, if the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported and if location info is
not available, as specified in subclause 4.4.6.2;
\- when the PCF is notified of the loss or release of resources associated to
the PCC rules corresponding with AF signalling IP flows, if the RAN-NAS-Cause
feature is supported and if location info is not available, as specified in
subclause 4.4.6.3;
\- if the AF requested the PCF to report the access network information, the
Rx session is not being terminated and if location info is not available, as
specified in subclause 4.4.6.7; and
\- when the PCF gets the knowledge that the service network where the UE is
located has been updated or becomes available and the AF subscribed to
PLMN_CHANGE has described in subclause 4.4.6.9.
# E.6 Trusted non-3GPP Access Network Information
The PCF provides the AF with the access network information as described in
subclause 4.4.1, with the following differences:
\- The RAT-Type AVP shall be set to \"WLAN\" and AN-Trusted AVP shall be set
to \"Trusted\" when over the N7 reference point:
a) the received \"ratType\" attribute is \"TRUSTED_WLAN\"; or
b) the received \"ratType\" attribute is \"TRUSTED_N3GA\" and the \"Netloc-
Trusted-N3GA\" feature is not supported.
\- The RAT-Type AVP shall be set to \"TRUSTED-N3GA\" when the \"Netloc-
Trusted-N3GA\" feature is supported and the received \"ratType\" attribute
over the N7 reference point is \"TRUSTED_N3GA\".
If the NetLoc-Trusted-WLAN is supported, the procedure described in subclauses
4.4.4 and 4.4.6.7 shall apply with the exceptions specified in clause E.1 and
with the exception of the user location information that is encoded as
follows:
a) The TNAP/TWAP Identifier received over the N7 reference point in the
\"tnapId\"/\"twapId\" attributes of the \"n3gaLocation\" attribute, if
available, is encoded in the TWAN-Identifier AVP.
NOTE 1: The received SSID, BSSID and Civic Address values, if available, are
encoded within the TWAN-Identifier AVP as specified in 3GPP TS 29.061 [34].
b) The UE/N5CW device local IP address (used to reach the TNGF/TWIF) received
over the N7 reference point in the \"ueIpv4Addr\" or \"ueIpv6Addr\" attribute
of the \"n3gaLocation\" attribute, if available, is encoded in the UE-Local-
IP-Address AVP.
c) The UDP source port number received over the N7 reference point in the
\"portNumber\" attribute if available, is encoded within the UDP-Source-Port
AVP.
NOTE 2:The UDP protocol can be used between the UE and TGNF to enable NAT
traversal
When reporting IP-CAN_CHANGE specific action, the PCF shall, in addition to
the IP-CAN-Type AVP and RAT-Type AVP, provide the AN-Trusted AVP set to
\"Trusted\" when the provided and RAT-Type AVP value is \"WLAN\".
# E.7 Untrusted non-3GPP Access Network Information
The PCF provides the AF with the access network information as described in
subclause 4.4.1, with the following differences:
\- The RAT-Type AVP shall be set to \"WLAN\" and AN-Trusted AVP shall be set
to \"Untrusted\" when over the N7 reference point the received \"ratType\"
attribute is \"WLAN\".
\- The ePDG address used as IPSec tunnel endpoint with the UE, received over
the N7 reference point within the \"anGwAddr\" attribute included in the
\"servNfId\" attribute, is encoded in the AN-GW-Address AVP.
\- The serving network identifier received over the N7 reference point within
the \"servingNetwork\" attribute is encoded in the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP.
If the NetLoc-Untrusted-WLAN feature is supported, reporting access network
information procedure described in subclauses 4.4.4 and 4.4.6.7 shall apply
with the exceptions specified in clause E.1 and with the exception of:
\- The user location information is encoded as follows:
a) The UE local IP address (used to reach the N3IWF or ePDG) received over the
N7 reference point in the \"ueIpv4Addr\" or \"ueIpv6Addr\" attribute of the
\"n3gaLocation\" attribute, if available, is encoded in the UE-Local-IP-
Address AVP.
b) The UDP source port or the TCP source port received over the N7 reference
point in the \"portNumber\" attribute if available, is encoded within the UDP-
Source-Port AVP or the TCP-Source-Port AVP as indicated by the \"protocol\"
attribute, if available.
NOTE 1: When the UE reaches the ePDG via a NAT, the combination of UE local IP
address and the UE source port is needed for lawful interception purposes. The
UE source port may be either a UDP or a TCP port, and it is indicated in the
\"protocol\" attribute received over the N7 reference point.
  * The UE time zone information is included within 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP, if available.
NOTE 2:EPC does not support time zone reporting when the access network is
untrusted WLAN.
When reporting IP-CAN_CHANGE specific action, the PCF shall, in addition to
the IP-CAN-Type AVP and RAT-Type AVP, provide the AN-Trusted AVP set to
\"Untrusted\". The PCF provides also the AF with the ePDG IP address used as
IPSec tunnel endpoint with the UE, if received, encoded in the AN-GW-Address
AVP.
# E.8 Wireline non-3GPP Access Network Information
The PCF provides the AF with the wireline access network information as
described in subclause 4.4.1, with the following differences:
\- The RAT-Type AVP shall be set to \"WIRELINE\", \"WIRELINE_CABLE\" or
\"WIRELINE_BBF\" according to the received \"ratType\" attribute.
If the NetLoc-Wireline is supported, the procedure described in subclauses
4.4.4 and 4.4.6.7 shall apply with the exceptions specified in clause E.1 and
the exception of the user location information that is encoded as follows:
\- The wireline location is encoded in the Wireline-User-Location-Info AVP,
where:
a) The HFC Node Identifer received over NGAP in the \"hfcNodeId\" attribute of
the \"n3gaLocation\", if available, is encoded in the HFC-Node-Identifier AVP.
b) The Global Line Identifier in the \"gli\" attribute of the
\"n3gaLocation\", if available, is encoded in the GLI-Identifier AVP.
c) The type of wireline access in the \"w5gbanLineType\" attribute of the
\"n3gaLocation\", if available, is encoded in the Line-Type AVP.
