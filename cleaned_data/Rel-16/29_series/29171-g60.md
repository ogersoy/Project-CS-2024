In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as

scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Functional Overview
## 4.1 General
Figure 4.1-1 below shows the architecture applicable to the positioning of a
UE with E-UTRAN access. The SLs interface is used to convey LCS-AP messages
and parameters between the MME to the E-SMLC. It is also used for tunnelling
LTE Positioning Protocols (LPP between the E-SMLC and the target UE, LPPa
between the E-SMLC and the eNB), which are transparent to the MME as described
in 3GPP TS 36.305 [2].
Figure 4.1-1 Positioning Interfaces in E-UTRAN
# 5 LCS-AP Message Transport
## 5.1 General
The LCS-AP is a logical interface between the MME and the E-SMLC. This clause
specifies the standards for signaling transport to be used across LCS-AP.
## 5.2 Protocol Layering
Figure 5.2-1 below shows the protocol layering used to support the transfer of
LCS-AP PDUs between an E-SMLC and a MME. The LTE Positioning Protocols (LPP
and LPPa) can be carried in LCS-AP messages which are transparent to the MME.
Figure 5.2-1 Protocol Layering for LCS-AP
## 5.3 Usage of SCTP Associations
SCTP (see IETF RFC 4960 [4]) shall be supported as the transport layer of LCS-
AP messages.
Semi-permanent SCTP associations shall be established between MME and E-SMLC,
i.e. the SCTP associations shall remain up under normal circumstances.
Local multi-homing should be supported. Remote multi-homing shall be
supported.
Multiple local SCTP endpoints may be supported. Multiple remote SCTP endpoints
shall be supported. When multiple local or remote SCTP endpoints are
configured, several simultaneous SCTP associations shall be supported between
MME and E-SMLC.
The MME shall establish the SCTP association. Since under normal operation
there should always be an SCTP association established between an MME and an
E-SMLC, if the E-SMLC needs to initiate a message towards an MME it shall do
so over an existing SCTP association already established with that MME.
When an entity detects that an SCTP association has been lost, all resources
for transactions open on that association shall be released.
The registered port number for LCS-AP is 9082. The registered payload protocol
identifier for LCS-AP is 29.
# 6 LCS-AP Procedures
## 6.1 General
The LCS-AP interface can be divided into the following procedures:
\- Location service request procedure
\- Location information exchange procedure
The E-UTRAN positioning capabilities are intended to be forward compatible to
other access types and other position methods, in an effort to reduce the
amount of additional positioning support needed in the future.
## 6.2 Procedures Applicable to LCS-AP
### 6.2.1 Location Service Request
#### 6.2.1.1 General
The purpose of the location service request procedure is to obtain the
location estimate for a target UE in E-UTRAN.
#### 6.2.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 6.2.1.2-1 Location Service Request Procedure, Successful Operation
The initiator (MME) of the location service request procedure sends a LCS-AP
Location Request message to the E-SMLC associated with the current or last
known serving cell for the target UE and starts the timer T3x01. The message
contains the following mandatory (M), conditional (C) and optional (O)
information, where conditional parameters are required if available.
\- Correlation ID (M)
\- Location Type (M)
\- Cell Identifier (M)
\- LCS Client Type (C)
\- LCS Priority (C)
\- LCS Service Type ID (C)
\- LCS QoS (C)
\- UE Positioning Capability (O)
\- Include Velocity (O)
\- IMSI of target UE (O)
\- IMEI of target UE (O)
\- APDU (O)
\- RAT Type (O)
\- Coverage Level (O)
The Correlation ID is assigned by the MME and enables association of the
location response with the location request when more than one location
service request procedure is ongoing for the UE with the same E-SMLC.
The Location Type IE indicates the type of Location Information being
requested. The following types are supported:
\- Current geographic location estimate
\- Location assistance data for the target UE
\- Last known location estimate
If the location estimate is requested, the E-SMLC performs positioning
procedure on the target UE using a particular position method or a combination
of more than one positioning method based on the UE capability. If UE
capability is unknown, the E-SMLC may request UE position capability through
LPP as defined in 3GPP TS 36.305 [2].
Alternatively, if assistance data was requested, the E-SMLC may provide
positioning assistance data to the UE. The E-SMLC may invoke the following
LCS-AP procedures to get assistance data:
\- Connection Oriented Information Transfer
\- Connectionless Information Transfer
Otherwise, if a last known location estimate is requested, the E-SMLC obtains
a geographic location estimate using only the information provided in the LCS-
AP Location Request message. The E-SMLC shall not attempt to obtain location
information for the target UE from either the E-UTRAN or the target UE (e.g.
because the UE may not be currently reachable).
If a location estimate or a last known location estimate was requested and was
subsequently obtained, the E-SMLC shall return a LCS-AP Location Response to
the initiator of the location request using the same SCTP association as the
location request. This message contains the following mandatory (M),
conditional (C) and optional parameters (O).
\- Correlation ID (M)
\- Location Estimate (M).
\- Accuracy Fulfilment Indicator (O).
\- Velocity estimate (C).
\- Positioning Data (C).
\- E-UTRAN Cell Identifier (O).
\- Cell Portion ID (O).
\- Civic Address (O).
\- Barometric Pressure (O).
If assistance data was instead requested for an UE and the E-SMLC was able
successfully to transfer this to the UE, the E-SMLC shall return a LCS-AP
Location Response to the initiator of the location request (MME). This message
shall contain no parameters. The absence of a LCS Cause parameter in this case
implies that the transfer was successful.
If the MME receives the LCS-AP Location Response for corresponding request
message, the MME shall stop the timer T3x01.
#### 6.2.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation
If the E-SMLC is unable to obtain any of the location information requested or
if requested LCS assistance data could not be transferred, the E-SMLC shall
return a LCS-AP Location Response to the initiator of the Location Request
carrying the following parameters:
\- Correlation ID (M)
\- LCS Cause (M)
\- Positioning Data (O)
The E-SMLC shall use the same SCTP association for the Location Response as
was used for the request.
If the MME receives the LCS-AP Location Response for corresponding request
message, the MME shall stop the timer T3x01.
On the expiry of the timer T3x01, the MME shall abort the procedure, release
any resources allocated for this location request procedure and notify the
node that triggered the Location Request about the error.
### 6.2.2 Location Information Exchange
#### 6.2.2.1 Connection Oriented Information Transfer
##### 6.2.2.1.1 General
The Connection Oriented Information transfer procedure enables two-way
transfer of LPP and LPPa messages between an E-SMLC and a MME. The procedure
is only valid while a location request procedure for the target UE is ongoing.
This procedure makes use of the same SCTP association as the location request
procedure for the particular target UE.
##### 6.2.2.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 6.2.2.1.2-1 Connection Oriented Information, Successful Operation
The initiator of the procedure (E-SMLC or MME) with a LPP or LPPa message to
transfer concerning a particular target UE sends a LCS-AP Connection Oriented
Information message to a recipient carrying the following parameters:
\- Correlation ID (M)
\- Payload Type (M)
\- APDU (M);
The Correlation ID in this message is the Correlation ID used for the Location
Request. It shall be present for a message transfer from the E-SMLC to the MME
and for a message transfer from the MME to the E-SMLC.
The Payload Type shall be present to indicate the type of the APDU. The
supported information types are LPP and LPPa.
The APDU shall contain an LPP APDU when communicating between the E-SMLC and
the target UE or an LPPa APDU when communicating between the E-SMLC and
serving eNB. The MME shall forward this to the serving eNB for the target UE.
If the intended recipient is the E-SMLC for a target UE, the message is
terminated in the E-SMLC. The E-SMLC shall then perform interpretation of the
APDU.
##### 6.2.2.1.3 Abnormal Conditions
At an intermediate entity, if a received LCS-AP Connection Oriented
Information message contains unrecognized information or if the message cannot
be sent on, the message shall be discarded.
#### 6.2.2.2 Connectionless Information Transfer
##### 6.2.2.2.1 General
The Connectionless Information transfer procedure enables two-way transfer of
LPPa messages between an E-SMLC and a MME when there is no existing signalling
connection association. This procedure can be used to query eNBs for the
information not related to a UE connection, such as Timing information on the
eNB.
##### 6.2.2.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 6.2.2.2.2-1 Connectionless Information Procedure, Successful Operation
The initiator of the procedure (either E-SMLC or MME) sends a LCS-AP
Connectionless Information message to a recipient carrying the following
parameters:
\- Source Entity (M)
\- Destination Entity (M)
\- APDU (M)
\- Return Error Request (O)
The source entity identifies the sender. The recipient entity identifies the
final destination. The APDU contains a LPPa APDU to be transferred. The Return
Error Request may be included to request notification in the event of
unsuccessful transfer and indicate the type of notification needed. If the
recipient entity is not the final destination, the recipient shall transfer
the LCS-AP Connectionless Information message to either the final destination
or an intermediate entity capable of forward it to the final destination.
##### 6.2.2.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
If the message cannot be transferred by an intermediate entity or destination
entity and the Return Error Request is not included, the message shall be
discarded. If the Return Error Request is included, the intermediate or
destination entity shall, depending on the Return Error Request type, send a
LCS-AP Connectionless Information message to, or towards, the original source
containing the following parameters:
\- Source Entity (M)
\- Destination Entity (M)
\- APDU (M)
\- Return Error Cause (M)
The Source entity shall indicate the Destination Entity in the original
received message. The Destination Entity shall indicate the Source Entity in
the original message. The Return Error cause shall indicate the reason for
unsuccessful transfer. The APDU shall contain any originally received APDU.
If a received LCS-AP Connectionless Information message containing a Return
Error Cause cannot be transferred by an intermediate entity, it shall be
discarded with no return error message.
##### 6.2.2.2.4 Abnormal Conditions
At an intermediate entity, if a received LCS-AP Connectionless Information
message contains unrecognized or invalid information, the message shall be
discarded.
At the recipient entity, if a received LCS-AP Connectionless Information
message contains invalid or unrecognized information as defined for LCS-AP,
the message shall be discarded.
### 6.2.3 Ciphering Keys Delivery
#### 6.2.3.1 General
The purpose of the ciphering keys delivery procedure is to enable the E-SMLC
to send ciphering keys for broadcast assistance data to the MME so that the
MME can then distribute the ciphering keys to suitably subscribed UEs.
#### 6.2.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 6.2.3.2-1 Ciphering Keys Delivery Procedure, Successful Operation
The initiator (E-SMLC) of the ciphering keys delivery procedure sends a
Ciphering Key Data message to the MME and starts the timer T3x03. The message
contains the following mandatory (M) information:
\- Ciphering Data (M):
If the MME is able to successfully store all ciphering data sets included in
the Ciphering Key Data message, the MME sends a Ciphering Key Data Result
message. The message contains the following mandatory (M) information:
\- Ciphering Data Ack (M)
If the E-SMLC receives the Ciphering Key Data Result message, the E-SMLC shall
stop the timer T3x03.
#### 6.2.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation
If the MME is unable to successfully store one or more ciphering data sets
included in the Ciphering Key Data message, the MME shall return a Ciphering
Key Data Result message carrying the following mandatory (M) information:
\- Ciphering Data Error Report (M)
If the E-SMLC receives the Ciphering Key Data Result message message, the
E-SMLC shall stop the timer T3x03.
On the expiry of the timer T3x03, the E-SMLC shall abort the procedure and
release any resources allocated for this ciphering keys delivery procedure.
## 6.3 Exception Procedures
### 6.3.1 Location Abort
#### 6.3.1.1 General
The purpose of the Location Abort procedure is to cancel an ongoing
positioning attempt or the request for assistance data. This message can be
sent from the MME to the E-SMLC. This procedure makes use of the same SCTP
association as the location request procedure for the particular target UE.
#### 6.3.1.2 Normal Operation
Figure 6.3.1.2-1 Location Abort Procedure, Normal Operation
The MME sends a LCS-AP Location Abort Request message to the E-SMLC across the
SLs interface. The message contains a LCS Cause parameter indicating the
reason of cancellation.
On receipt of this message, the E-SMLC shall stop the positioning transactions
of the target UE and may release any resources previously allocated. The
E-SMLC shall return a LCS-AP Location Response message containing the LCS
Cause received in Location Abort Request and, optionally, positioning data.
The E-SMLC may also optionally include in this response any \"best-effort\"
location estimate that it has already determined prior to receiving the LCS-AP
Location Abort Request.
#### 6.3.1.3 Abnormal Conditions
At the recipient entity, if no ongoing location transaction for the target UE
is found, the recipient entity shall discard the received LCS-AP Location
Abort Request message with no return error message.
### 6.3.2 Reset
#### 6.3.2.1 General
The Reset procedure is an optional procedure applicable to the LCS-AP. It
enables an E-SMLC or a MME that has undergone a failure with loss of location
service transactions to indicate this to a partner entity. The recipient
entity can then release its own connection and transaction resources. The
Reset procedure may not be applicable when only a limited part of an E-SMLC or
a MME has suffered a failure, since error recovery procedures specific to
individual connections and transactions may then be used. The Reset procedure
applies to all transactions initiated on a single SCTP association.
#### 6.3.2.2 Normal Operation
Figure 6.3.2.2-1 Reset Procedure, Normal Operation
In the event of a failure at an E-SMLC or a MME that results in the loss of
location service transactions, a LCS-AP Reset Request message may be sent to
the partner entity across the SLs interface. The message contains a LCS Cause
parameter indicating the reason for the reset. The sending entity shall ensure
that all information on location service transactions for the SCTP association
on which the Reset Request was sent is reinitialized to indicate no existing
transactions.
On receiving a LCS-AP Reset Request message, the recipient entity (E-SMLC or
MME) shall clear all references and state information for the location service
transactions on the SCTP association on which the Reset Request was received
and shall release any associated resources. The recipient entity shall then
return a LCS-AP Reset Acknowledge message using the same SCTP association as
the Reset Request.
If the initiating entity (E-SMLC or MME) received the LCS-AP Reset Acknowledge
message, it shall stop the timer T3x02.
#### 6.3.2.3 Abnormal Conditions
On the first expiry of the timer T3x02, the Source entity (E-SMLC or MME)
shall resend the LCS-AP Reset Request message and shall reset and restart
timer T3x02. This retransmission is repeated a maximum of \"n\" times, where
\"n\" is an O&M administered parameter. Following \"n\" unsuccessful reset
attempts, the procedure shall be terminated and maintenance shall be informed.
## 6.4 Error Handling
### 6.4.1 Abnormal Conditions
If an ongoing location request is pre-empted at the initiator by an inter-eNB
handover and MME relocation, or if the main signalling link to the target UE
is released by the MME, or if a main signalling link failure indicated by the
serving eNodeB persists for more than a certain timeout interval or if there
is a timeout waiting for the positioning response, or any other abnormal
conditions for which the positioning procedure cannot be maintained, the MME
shall send a LCS-AP Location Abort message to the E-SMLC to terminate the
positioning procedure.
For Intra-MME handovers, the location session between the MME and E-SMLC is
not affected. Application layer impacts on these handovers are handled by
higher protocol layers.
If the E-SMLC cannot proceed with positioning due to some protocol violation
or error condition (e.g. inter-eNB handover), it shall return a LCS-AP
Location Response message to the initiator containing a LCS cause and,
optionally, positioning data.
### 6.4.2 Overload
If an E-SMLC is in overload condition, it may reject a LCS-AP Location Request
by returning a LCS-AP Location Response containing a LCS Cause parameter
indicating congestion. The initiator of the location requests (i.e. MME) may
reduce the frequency of later location requests until rejection due to
overload has ceased. In reducing the frequency of location service requests,
the MME shall reduce lower priority requests, to zero if necessary, before
reducing the frequency of higher priority requests. An E-SMLC shall similarly
reject location requests of a lower priority, to zero if necessary, due to
overload before rejecting location requests of a higher priority. An E-SMLC in
overload condition may optionally employ the following procedures to alleviate
overload:
a) Allow higher priority location service requests to pre-empt lower priority
requests for which location service procedures are already in progress.
b) Abort lower priority location service requests already in progress.
c) Reduce the supported QoS for lower priority requests for a location
estimate -- e.g. by reducing accuracy or increasing response time.
d) Employ UE based positioning methods, where supported by the target UE and
the E-SMLC, rather than UE assisted or network based methods (except TA).
The priority of a location request shall be defined according to the value in
the LCS Priority parameter. If this parameter is absent in a LCS-AP Location
Request, the lowest priority shall be assumed.
# 7 LCS-AP Messages and Message Formats
## 7.1 General
This clause describes the structure of the messages and information elements
required for the LCS-AP messages.
## 7.2 Message Formats
LCS-AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Recommendations ITU-T Recommendation
X.680 (07/2002) [8] and ITU-T Recommendation X.681 (07/2002) [9]. The ASN.1
definition specifies the structure and content of LCS-AP messages. The LCS-AP
messages may contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that
message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1.
However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct a
LCS-AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following
additional rules (Note that in the following IE means an IE in the object set
with an explicit id. If one IE needed to appear more than once in one object
set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):
\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.
\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall
appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there
is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements
reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears
as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may
contain only one kind of list elements.
If a LCS-AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled
as defined for Abstract Syntax error.
For the handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data, please
refer to 3GPP TS 36.413 [7].
## 7.3 LCS-AP Messages
The following attributes are used for the tabular description of the messages
and information elements: Presence, Range Criticality and Assigned
Criticality. Their definition and use can be found in 3GPP TS 36.413 [7].
### 7.3.1 LCS-AP Location Request message
This message is sent by the MME to request a location estimate for a target UE
and contains sufficient information to enable location according to the
required QoS using any positioning method supported. The message is also used
to request LCS assistance data transfer to an UE.

### 7.3.2 LCS-AP Location Response message
This message is sent in response to a LCS-AP Location Request to return a
successful location estimate for a target UE or to indicate some failure in
obtaining this. The message is also sent in response to a LCS-AP Location
Request to return an indication that LCS assistance data has been successfully
delivered to an UE.

## 7.4 Information Elements
### 7.4.1 General
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit
strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of
the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to
the ordering of bits:
\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB)
\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB)
\- When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the
bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information

## 7.5 Message and information element abstract syntax
### 7.5.1 General
LCS-AP ASN.1 definition conforms to [8] and [9].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of LCS-AP messages.
LCS-AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions
for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by
ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall
construct a LCS-AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with
the following additional rules (Note that in the following IE means an IE in
the object set with an explicit id. If one IE needed to appear more than once
in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):
\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.
\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall
appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there
is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements
reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears
as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may
contain only one kind of list elements.
If a LCS-AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled
as defined for Abstract Syntax error in clause 10 of [7].
### 7.5.2 Usage of protocol extension mechanism for non-standard use
The protocol extension mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
\- for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to
be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a
complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multi-vendor
interoperability.
\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The extension mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such
functionality shall be standardised.

### 7.5.9 Message transfer syntax
LCS-AP shall use the ASN.1 Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER) Aligned
Variant as transfer syntax as specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.691 [12].
## 7.6 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
Clause 10 of 3GPP TS 36.413 [7] is applicable for the purposes of the present
document.
# 8 LCS-AP Timers

T3x01 This value can be operator configurable, based on the received QoS
response time. A Location Request procedure started in the MME. Location
Response message is received MME shall send Abort message to E-SMLC and return
error to the requesting entity
T3x02 3 seconds A Reset message is sent Reset Acknowledge message is received
Retransmission of the Reset message
T3x03 This value can be operator configurable A Ciphering Keys Delivery
procedure started in the E-SMLC Ciphering Key Data Result message is received
E-SMLC shall abort the procedure and release any resources allocated for the
procedure
