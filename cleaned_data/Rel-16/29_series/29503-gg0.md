# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Introduction
Within the 5GC, the UDM offers services to the AMF, SMF, SMSF, NEF, GMLC,
NWDAF and AUSF via the Nudm service based interface (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2],
3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.288 [35]).
Figure 4.1-1 provides the reference model (in service based interface
representation and in reference point representation), with focus on the UDM.
Figure 4.1-1: Reference model -- UDM
The functionalities supported by the UDM are listed in clause 6.2.7 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [2].
# 5 Services offered by the UDM
## 5.1 Introduction
The UDM offeres the following services via the Nudm interface:
\- Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement Service
\- Nudm_UEContextManagement Service
\- Nudm_UEAuthentication Service
\- Nudm_EventExposure Service
\- Nudm_ParameterProvision Service
\- Nudm_NIDDAuthorization
\- Nudm_MT

All scenarios shown in the following clauses assume that the UDM is stateful
and stores information in local memory. However, the UDM may be stateless and
stores information externally in the UDR. If so, the stateless UDM makes use
of Nudr services as specified in 3GPP TS 29.504 [9] and 3GPP TS 29.505 [10] to
retrieve required data from the UDR and store them locally before processing
an incoming request. Processing the incoming request may then include updating
data in the UDR or subscribing to data change notifications at the UDR by
consuming the appropriate Nudr services. After processing the incoming
request, the UDM may delete the locally stored data. When data stored in UDR
is then shared among the different UDM instances of the same group, as
identified by UDM Group ID (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 6.2.6), bulk
subscriptions, as described in clause 4.15.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], are
not applicable, i.e. an NF consumer (e.g. NEF) only subscribes towards one of
the UDM instances within the group. See Annex B.
## 5.2 Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement Service
### 5.2.1 Service Description
See 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] table 7.2.5-1.
### 5.2.2 Service Operations
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
For the Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement service the following service operations
are defined:
\- Get
\- Subscribe
\- ModifySubscription
\- Unsubscribe
\- Notification
\- Info
The Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement Service is used by Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF,
SMSF, GMLC) to retrieve the UE\'s individual subscription data relevant to the
consumer NF from the UDM by means of the Get service operation. If the
consumer NF supports the feature \"sharedData\" (see clause 6.1.8), the
retrieved individual subscription data for the UE may contain shared data
identifier identifying additional parts of subscription data shared by several
UEs. If so, the Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement Service is also used by Consumer
NFs to retrieve shared subscription data from the UDM by means of the Get
service operation.
It is also used by Consumer NFs to subscribe to notifications of data change
by means of the Subscribe service operation. If the consumer NF supports the
feature \"sharedData\" (see clause 6.1.8), the consumer NF may also subscribe
to notifications of shared data change by means of the Subscribe service
operation.
It is also used to modify an existing subscription by means of the
ModifySubscription service operation. If the consumer NF supports the feature
\"sharedData\" (see clause 6.1.8), the consumer NF may also modify an existing
subscription to notifications of shared data change by means of the
ModifySubscription service operation.
It is also used to unsubscribe from notifications of data changes by means of
the Unsubscribe service operation. If the feature \"sharedData\" (see clause
6.1.8) is supported, it may also be used to unsubscribe from notifications of
shared data changes by means of the Unsubscribe service operation.
It is also used by the Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF, SMSF) that have previously
subscribed, to get notified by means of the Notification service operation
when UDM decides to modify the subscribed data. If the feature \"sharedData\"
(see clause 6.1.8) is supported by the consumer NF and the consumer NF has
previously subscribed to notifications of shared data change, it is also used
by the consumer NF to get notified by means of the Notification service
operation when the UDM decides to modify the subscribed shared data.
It is also used by Consumer NFs to provide the information about the status of
the subscription data management procedures.
#### 5.2.2.2 Get
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
The following procedures using the Get service operation are supported:
\- Slice Selection Subscription Data Retrieval
\- Access and Mobility Subscription Data Retrieval
\- SMF Selection Subscription Data Retrieval
\- Session Management Subscription Data Retrieval
\- SMS Subscription Data Retrieval
\- SMS Management Subscription Data Retrieval
\- UE Context in SMF Data Retrieval
\- UE Context in SMSF Data Retrieval
\- Retrieval Of Multiple Data Sets
\- Identifier Translation
\- Shared Subscription Data Retrieval
\- Trace Data Retrieval
\- LCS Privacy Data Retrieval
\- LCS Mobile Originated Data Retrieval
\- Enhanced Coverage Restriction Data Retrieval
\- V2X Subscription Data Retrieval
\- LCS Broadcast Assistance Subscription Data Retrieval
\- UE Context in AMF Data Retrieval
\- Individual Shared Subscription Data Retrieval
When the feature SharedData (see clause 6.1.8) is supported and the retrieved
UE-individual data (i.e. data other than Shared Subscription Data) contain
SharedDataIds, the NF service consumer shall also retrieve the shared data
identified by the received shared data Ids unless the identified shared data
are already available at the NF service consumer. The order of sequence of
sharedDataIds within UE-individual data is significant: Individual data take
precedence over shared data; shared data \"SharedDataX\" identified by a
sharedDataId X takes precedence over shared data \"SharedDataY\" identified by
a sharedDataId Y if X appears before Y within the list of SharedDataIds in the
UE-individual data.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Slice Selection Subscription Data Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive the UE\'s NSSAI (see also clause
5.15.5.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.3-1
step 3). In this example scenario the NSSAI is retrieved by the AMF, see
clause 6.1.3.2.1 for other scenarios that can retrieve the NSSAI. The request
contains the UE\'s identity (/{supi}), the type of the requested information
(/nssai) and query parameters (supported-features, plmn-id).
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1: Requesting a UE\'s NSSAI
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) sends a GET request to the resource
representing the UE\'s subscribed NSSAI, with query parameters indicating the
supported-features and/or plmn-id.
2a. On success, the UDM responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body
containing the UE\'s NSSAI as relevant for the requesting NF service consumer.
2b. If there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP status code \"404
Not Found\" shall be returned including additional error information in the
response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the GET response body.
##### 5.2.2.2.3 Access and Mobility Subscription Data Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive the UE\'s Access and Mobility
Subscription data (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step 14).
The request contains the UE\'s identity (/{supi}), the type of the requested
information (/am-data) and query parameters (supported-features, plmn-id).
Figure 5.2.2.2.3-1: Requesting a UE\'s Access and Mobility Subscription Data
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) sends a GET request to the resource
representing the UE\'s Access and Mobility Subscription Data, with query
parameters indicating the supported-features and/or plmn-id.
2a. On Success, the UDM responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body
containing the UE\'s Access and Mobility Subscription Data as relevant for the
requesting NF service consumer.
NOTE 1: If the UDM initiated a request to obtain SoR information from the SOR-
AF, the UDM starts an operator configurable timer up to which the UDM shall
wait for a response from the SOR-AF for retrieving the SoR information. The
UDM responds back to the NF service consumer for Access and Mobility
Subscription Data Retrieval service operation before the timer expires. If the
SOR-AF has not provided a response with the SoR information before the timer
expires, the UDM shall behave as specified in clause C.2 of 3GPP°TS°23.122
[20] (step 3d).2b. If there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP
status code \"404 Not Found\" shall be returned including additional error
information in the response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
NOTE 2: Upon reception of any Nudm_EventExposure operation or Nudm_PP
operation, or when the validity of an event subscription or provisioned
parameter with its associated maximum latency, maximum response time or DL
Buffering Suggested Packet Count value expires, UDM may need to adjust the
values of active time and/or periodic registration timer and/or DL Buffering
Suggested Packet Count. The UDM shall notify AMF and/or SMF if the values are
updated (see clause 4.15.3.2.3b and 4.15.6.3a of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the GET response body.
##### 5.2.2.2.4 SMF Selection Subscription Data Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.4-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive the UE\'s SMF Selection Subscription
data (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step 14). The request
contains the UE\'s identity (/{supi}), the type of the requested information
(/smf-select-data) and query parameters (supported-features, plmn-id).
Figure 5.2.2.2.4-1: Requesting a UE\'s SMF Selection Subscription Data
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) sends a GET request to the resource
representing the UE\'s SMF Selection Subscription Data, with query parameters
indicating the supported-features and/or plmn-id.
2a. On success, the UDM responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body
containing the UE\'s SMF Selection Subscription Data as relevant for the
requesting NF service consumer.
2b. If there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP status code \"404
Not Found\" shall be returned including additional error information in the
response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the GET response body.
##### 5.2.2.2.5 Session Management Subscription Data Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.5-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. SMF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive the UE\'s session management
subscription data (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 step 4a-4b).
The request contains the UE\'s identity (/{supi}), the type of the requested
information (/sm-data), and query parameters (single-nssai, dnn, supported-
features, plmn-id).
Figure 5.2.2.2.5-1: Requesting a UE\'s Session Management Subscription Data
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. SMF) sends a GET request to the resource
representing the UE\'s session management subscription data, with query
parameters indicating the selected network slice and/or the DNN and/or
supported-features and/or plmn-id.
2a. On success, the UDM responds with \"200 OK\", the message body containing
the UE\'s session management subscription data (an array of
SessionManagementSubscriptionData objects, one array element per S-NSSAI) as
relevant for the requesting NF service consumer.
2b. If there is no valid subscription data for the UE, or if the UE
subscription data exists, but the requested session management subscription is
not available (e.g. query parameter contains network slice and/or DNN that
does not belong to the UE subscription), HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\"
shall be returned including additional error information in the response body
(in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the GET response body.
##### 5.2.2.2.6 SMS Subscription Data Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.6-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive the UE\'s SMS Subscription Data (see
also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.13.3.1). The request contains the UE\'s
identity (/{supi}) and the type of the requested information (/sms-data).
Figure 5.2.2.2.6-1: Requesting UE\'s SMS Subscription Data
1\. The NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) sends a GET request to the resource
representing the UE\'s SMS Subscription Data.
2\. The UDM responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body containing the
UE\'s SMS Subscription Data.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the GET response body.
##### 5.2.2.2.7 SMS Management Subscription Data Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.7-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. SMSF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive the UE\'s SMS Management Subscription
Data (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.13.3.1). The request contains the
UE\'s identity (/{supi}) and the type of the requested information (/sms-mng-
data).
Figure 5.2.2.2.7-1: Requesting UE\'s SMS Management Subscription Data
1\. The NF Service Consumer (e.g. SMSF) sends a GET request to the resource
representing the UE\'s SMS Management Subscription Data.
2\. The UDM responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body containing the
UE\'s SMS Management Subscription Data.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the GET response body.
##### 5.2.2.2.8 UE Context In SMF Data Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.8-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive the UE\'s Context In SMF data (see also
3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step 14). The request contains the UE\'s
identity (/{supi}), the type of the requested information (/ue-context-in-smf-
data) and query parameters (supported-features).
Figure 5.2.2.2.8-1: Requesting a UE\'s Context in SMF Data
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) shall send a GET request to the
resource representing the UE\'s Context In SMF Data, with query parameters
indicating the supported-features.
2a. On Success, the UDM shall respond with \"200 OK\" with the message body
containing the UE\'s Context In SMF Data as relevant for the requesting NF
service consumer.
2b. If there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP status code \"404
Not Found\" shall be returned including additional error information in the
response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the GET response body.
##### 5.2.2.2.9 Retrieval Of Multiple Data Sets
Figure 5.2.2.2.9-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive multiple data sets. In this example
scenario the UE\'s Access and Mobility Subscription data and the the UE\'s SMF
Selection Subscription data are retrieved with a single request; see clause

Data indicated by the \"subscription data Type\" input and additional UE\'s
UDM-related parameters.
\- Delivery of UE Parameters Update Data to the UE via control plane procedure
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.20.
##### 5.2.2.5.2 Data Change Notification To NF
Figure 5.2.2.5.2-1 shows a scenario where the UDM notifies the NF service
consumer (that has subscribed to receive such notification) about subscription
data change (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.5.1 or 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]
clause 4.5.2) or shared data change. The delivery of UE Parameters Update Data
to the UE via control plane procedure is also conveyed using this
notification, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.20. The notification
request shall be sent to the callbackReference URI as previously received in
the SdmSubscription (see clause 6.1.6.2.3).
Figure 5.2.2.5.2-1: Subscription Data Change Notification
1\. The UDM sends a POST request to the callbackReference as provided by the
NF service consumer during the subscription.
2\. The NF service consumer responds with \"204 No Content\".
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the POST response body.
NOTE 1: If the NF service consumer detects that the received Data Change
Notification contains an origValue that does not match the currently stored
value, it can re-sync by using the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation.
NOTE 2: When the notification is used for the delivery of UE Parameter Update
Data to the UE, the trigger for UDM to start this procedure is out of the
scope of this specification. This can be based, e.g., on O&M commands or
provisioning orders. When a given UE parameter can be updated either in the
USIM or in the ME side of the UE (e.g., Routing Indicator, see 3GPP TS 23.502
[3] clause 4.20.1) it is assumed that the trigger for the UE parameter update
procedure includes an indication to the UDM of the target for the UE
parameters update (i.e., USIM or ME). This indication is used by the UDM to
decide which UE parameter update data set type to use and whether the UE
parameter update requires secured packet protection via SP-AF.
#### 5.2.2.6 Info
##### 5.2.2.6.1 General
The following procedures using the Info service operation are supported:
\- Providing acknowledgement from the UE to UDM about successful delivery of

### 5.3.1 Service Description
See 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] table 7.2.5-1, and 3GPP TS 23.632 [32].
### 5.3.2 Service Operations
#### 5.3.2.1 Introduction
For the Nudm_UEContextManagement service the following service operations are
defined:
\- Registration
\- DeregistrationNotification
\- Deregistration
\- Get
\- Update
\- P-CSCF-RestorationNotification
\- P-CSCF-RestorationTrigger
\- AMFDeregistration
\- PEI-Update
The Nudm_UEContextManagement Service is used by Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF, SMSF)
to register at the UDM by means of the Registration service operation.
It is also used by the registered Consumer NFs (AMF) to get notified by means
of the DeregistrationNotification service operation when UDM decides to
deregister the registered consumer NF.
It is also used by the registered Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF, SMSF) to deregister
from the UDM by means of the Deregistration service operation.
It is also used by consumer NFs (NEF, NWDAF, NSSAAF) to retrieve registration
information from the UDM by means of the Get service operation.
It is also used by the registered Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF) to update
registration information stored at the UDM by means of the Update service
operation.
It is also used by the registered Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF) to get notified by
means of the P-CSCF-RestorationNotification service operation when UDM detects
the need for P-CSCF restoration.
It is also used by the consumer NF (HSS) to trigger P-CSCF restoration by
means of the P-CSCF-RestorationTrigger service operation.
It is also used by the consumer NF (HSS) to trigger deregistration of the
registered AMF for 3GPP access by means of the AMFDeregistration service
operation
It is also used by the consumer NF (HSS) to update the PEI in the AMF 3GPP
Access Registration context, by means of the PEI-Update service operation.
#### 5.3.2.2 Registration
##### 5.3.2.2.1 General
The Registration service operation is invoked by a NF that has been selected
to provide service to the UE to store related UE Context Management
information in UDM.
NF Consumers are AMF for access and mobility management service, SMF for
session management services, SMSF providing SMS services and HSS for IP-SM-GW
registration in SMSoIP scenarios.
As part of this registration procedure, the UDM authorizes or rejects the
subscriber to use the service provided by the registered NF, based on
subscription data (e.g. roaming restrictions).
The following procedures using the Registration service operation are
supported:
\- AMF registration for 3GPP access
\- AMF registration for non-3GPP access
\- SMF registration
\- SMSF registration for 3GPP access
\- SMSF registration for non-3GPP access
\- IP-SM-GW registration
##### 5.3.2.2.2 AMF registration for 3GPP access
Figure 5.3.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the AMF sends a request to the UDM
to update the AMF registration information for 3GPP access (see also 3GPP TS
23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step 14). The request contains the UE\'s
identity (/{ueId}) which shall be a SUPI and the AMF Registration Information
for 3GPP access.
Figure 5.3.2.2.2-1: AMF registering for 3GPP access
1\. The AMF sends a PUT request to the resource representing the UE\'s AMF
registration for 3GPP access to update or create AMF registration information.
If EPS interworking with N26 is supported, and the AMF has per DNN selected
the PGW-C+SMF for EPS interworking, the AMF shall include the info of selected
PGW-C+SMF to the UDM.
2a. On success, the UDM updates the Amf3GppAccessRegistration resource by
replacing it with the received resource information, and responds with \"200
OK\" or \"204 No Content\".
UDM shall invoke the Deregistration Notification service operation towards the
old AMF using the callback URI provided by the old AMF.
When AMF indicates there are no ongoing event subscriptions, but UDM has
ongoing event exposure subscriptions stored (e.g. in UDR), UDM shall invoke
one Namf_EventExposure Subscribe Service operations (see clause 5.3.2.2 of
3GPP TS 29.518 [36]) on behalf of NEF per subscription stored.
2b. If the resource does not exist (there is no previous AMF information
stored in UDM for that user), UDM stores the received AMF registration data
for 3GPP access and responds with HTTP Status Code \"201 created\". A response
body may be included to convey additional information to the NF consumer
(e.g., features supported by UDM).
2c. If the operation cannot be authorized due to e.g UE does not have required
subcription data, the AMF does not support CAG feature and the UE is allowed
to access 5GS via CAG cell(s) only, access barring, roaming restrictions or
core network restriction, HTTP status code \"403 Forbidden\" should be
returned including additional error information in the response body (in
\"ProblemDetails\" element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the PUT response body.
##### 5.3.2.2.3 AMF registration for non 3GPP access

## 5.4 Nudm_UEAuthentication Service
### 5.4.1 Service Description
See 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] table 7.2.5-1.
### 5.4.2 Service Operations
#### 5.4.2.1 Introduction
For the Nudm_UEAuthentication service the following service operations are
defined:
\- Get
\- GetHssAv
\- ResultConfirmation
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is used by the AUSF to request the UDM to
select an authentication method, calculate a fresh authentication vector (AV)
if required for the selected method, and provide it to the AUSF by means of
the Get service operation. See 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] clause 14.2.2. The service
may also be used by the AUSF to indicate to the UDM that the user is using a
N5GC device behind Cable RGs in private networks or in isolated deployment
scenarios with wireline access and that therefore the applicable
authentication method shall be EAP based. See 3GPP TS 23.316 [37] clause
4.10a.
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is also used by the HSS to request UDM to
generate the authentication vector(s) for EPS or IMS domain by means of
GetHssAv service operation. See 3GPP TS 23.632 [32] clause 5.6.3.
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is also used by the AUSF to inform the UDM
about the occurrence of a successful or unsuccessful authentication by means
of the ResultConfirmation service operation. See3GPP TS 33.501 [6] clause
14.2.3.
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is also used by the AUSF to request the UDM
to authenticate the FN-RG accessing to 5GC via W-AGF. See 3GPP TS 23.316 [37]
clause 7.2.1.3.
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is also used by the NF service consumer to
request the UDM to remove the UE authentication result during the Purge of
subscriber data in AMF after the UE deregisters from the network or NAS SMC
fails following the successful authentication in the registration procedure.
#### 5.4.2.2 Get
##### 5.4.2.2.1 General
The following procedure using the Get service operation is supported:
\- Authentication Information Retrieval
\- FN-RG Authentication
As part of this Authentication Information Retrieval operation, the UDM
authorizes or rejects the subscriber to use the service provided by the
registered NF, based on subscription data (e.g. roaming restrictions).
As part of this FN-RG Authentication operation, the UDM decides, based on the
stored authentication profile of the SUPI and the authenticated indication
that authentication has been completed by the W-AGF, that authentication by
the home network is not required for the FN-RG.
##### 5.4.2.2.2 Authentication Information Retrieval
Figure 5.4.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (AUSF)
retrieves authentication information for the UE from the UDM (see also 3GPP TS
33.501 [6] clause 6.1.2). The request contains the UE\'s identity (supi or
suci), the serving network name, and may contain resynchronization info.

1\. The NF service consumer sends a POST request (custom method: generate-
auth-data) to the resource representing the UE\'s security information.
2a. The UDM responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body containing the
authentication data information.
The AUSF shall store the authentication data information for subsequent
authentication processing. If the AUSF is configured to store Kausf (e.g.
based on its support of SoRProtection / UPUProtection service operations), the
AUSF shall preserve the Kausf and related information (e.g. SUPI) after the
completion of the primary authentication.
2b. If the operation cannot be authorized due to e.g UE does not have required
subcription data, none of the CAG IDs in the CAG cell match any of the CAG IDs
in the allowed CAG list, access barring or roaming restrictions, HTTP status
code \"403 Forbidden\" should be returned including additional error
information in the response body (in \"ProblemDetails\" element). If the
cellCagInfo is not received, the UDM shall not assume the UE is accessing from
the PLMN and shall not stop the authenthcation if the UE is allowed to access
5GS via CAG cell(s) only.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the POST response body.
##### 5.4.2.2.3 FN-RG Authentication

## 5.5 Nudm_EventExposure Service
### 5.5.1 Service Description
See 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] table 7.2.5-1.
### 5.5.2 Service Operations
#### 5.5.2.1 Introduction
For the Nudm_EventExposure service the following service operations are
defined:
\- Subscribe
\- Unsubscribe
\- Notify
\- ModifySubscription
The Nudm_EventExposure service is used by consumer NFs (e.g. NEF) to subscribe
to notifications of event occurrence by means of the Subscribe service
operation. For events that can be detected by the AMF, the UDM makes use of
the appropriate AMF service operation to subscribe on behalf of the consumer
NF (e.g. NEF).
The Nudm_EventExposure service is also used by the consumer NFs (e.g. NEF)
that have previously subscribed to notificatios, to unsubscribe by means of
the Unsubscribe service operation. For events that can be detected by the AMF,
the UDM makes use of the appropriate AMF service operation to unsubscribe on
behalf of the consumer NF (e.g. NEF).
The Nudm_EventExposure service is also used by the subscribed consumer NFs
(e.g. NEF) to get notified by the UDM when a subscribed event occurs at the
UDM by means of the Notify service operation. For subscribed events that can
occur at the AMF, the consumer NF (e.g. NEF) makes use of the corresponding
AMF service operation to get notified by the AMF directly without UDM
involvement.
The Nudm_EventExposure service is also used by the subscribed consumer NFs
(e.g. NEF) to modify an existing subscription by means of the
ModifySubscription service operation.
For details see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.15.
#### 5.5.2.2 Subscribe
##### 5.5.2.2.1 General
The following procedures using the Subscribe service operation are supported:
\- Subscribe to Notification of event occurrence
##### 5.5.2.2.2 Subscription to Notification of event occurrence
Figure 5.5.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the UDM to subscribe to notifications of event occurrence (see also
3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.15.3.2.2-1 step 1 and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] Figure
4.15.3.2.3b-1 step 1). The request contains a callback URI, the type of event
that is monitored and additional information e.g. event filters and reporting
options.
Figure 5.5.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer subscribes to notifications
1\. The NF service consumer sends a POST request to the parent resource
(collection of subscriptions) (.../{ueIdentity}/ee-subscriptions), to create a
subscription as present in message body. The values ueIdentity shall take are
specified in Table 6.4.3.2.2-1. The request may contain an expiry time,
suggested by the NF Service Consumer, representing the time upto which the
subscription is desired to be kept active and the time after which the
subscribed event(s) shall stop generating notifications, the indication on
whether the subscription applies also to EPC.\ \ If MTC Provider information
and/or AF ID are received in the request, the UDM shall check whether the MTC
Provider and/or the AF is allowed to perform this operation for the UE;
otherwise, the UDM shall skip the MTC provider and/or AF authorization check.
2a. On success, the UDM responds with \"201 Created\" with the message body
containing a representation of the created subscription. The Location HTTP
header shall contain the URI of the created subscription. If the event
subscription was for a group of UEs:
\- The \"maxNumOfReports\" in the \"reportingOptions\" IE shall be applicable
to each UE in the group;
\- The UDM shall return the number of UEs in that group in the \"numberOfUes\"
IE.
The NF service consumer shall keep track of the maximum number of reports
reported for each UE in the event report and when
\"maxNumOfReports*numberOfUes\" limit is reached, the NF service consumer
shall initiate the unsubscription of the notification towards the UDM (see
clause 5.5.2.3.2).
The response, based on operator policy, may contain the expiry time, as
determined by the UDM, after which the subscription becomes invalid. Once the
subscription expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving
notifications, it shall create a new subscription in the UDM. The NF Service
Producer shall not provide the same expiry time for many subscriptions in
order to avoid all of them expiring and recreating the subscription at the
same time. If the expiry time is not included in the response, the NF Service
Consumer shall not associate an expiry time for the subscription.
If the indication on whether the subscription applies also to EPC is included
in the request, the response shall include the indication on whether the
subscription was also successful in EPC domain.
If the event subscription was for a list events, the \"maxNumOfReports\" in
the \"reportingOptions\" IE shall be applicable to each event. The NF service
consumer shall keep track of the maximum number of reports reported for each
event in the event report and when \"maxNumOfReports*number of events\" limit
is reached, the NF service consumer shall initiate the unsubscription of the
notification towards the UDM (see clause 5.5.2.3.2).
If the NF Service Consumer has included the immediateFlag with value as
\"true\" in the event subscription for an individual UE and the event
requested for immediate reporting is reported by the UDM (e.g.
\"CHANGE_OF_SUPI_PEI_ASSOCIATION\" or \"ROAMING_STATUS\"), the UDM may include
the current status of the event if available in the response.
If the NF Service Consumer has included the immediateFlag with value as
\"true\" in the event subscription for an individual UE and the event
requested for immediate reporting is reported by the AMF (e.g.
LOCATION_REPORT) and the NF service consumer has indicated supporting of
\"IERSR\" feature (see clause 6.4.8), the UDM shall indicate the support of
\"IERSR\" feature when subscribing to the event on the AMF (see clause 6.2.8
of 3GPP TS 29.518 [36]). UDM shall include the current status of the event if
received from the AMF in subscription creation response.
If the NF Service Consumer has included the immediateFlag with value as
\"true\" in the event subscription for an individual UE, the indication on
whether the subscription applies also to EPC is included and set to \"true\"
in the request and the NF service consumer has indicated supporting of
\"IERSR\" feature (see clause 6.4.8), the UDM shall indicate the support of
\"ERIR\" feature when subscribing to the event on the HSS (see clause 6.4.8 of
3GPP TS 29.563 [55]). UDM shall include the current status of the event in EPC
if received from the HSS in subscription creation response.
NOTE: IERSR feature is not applicable to events detected by the SMF.
2b. If the user does not exist, HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\" shall be
returned including additional error information in the response body (in the
\"ProblemDetails\" element).
2c. If there is no valid subscription data for the UE, i.e. based on the UE\'s
subscription information monitoring of the requested EventType is not allowed,
or the requested EventType is not supported, or when MTC Provider or AF are
not allowed to perform this operation for the UE,HTTP status code \"403
Forbidden\" shall be returned including additional error information in the
response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the POST response body.
##### 5.5.2.2.3 Void
#### 5.5.2.3 Unsubscribe
##### 5.5.2.3.1 General
The following procedures using the Unsubscribe service operation are
supported:

#### 6.1.3.2 Resource: Nssai (Document)
##### 6.1.3.2.1 Description
This resource represents the subscribed Nssai for a SUPI. It is queried by the
AMF before registering, and is used to assist network slice selection. See
5.2.2.2.2 and 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.15.3.
This resource is also queried by the PGW-C+SMF during PDN connection
establishment in the EPC, and is used to select the S-NSSAI provided to the
UE, see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause 4.11.0a.5. The PGW-C+SMF shall not indicate
support to \"Nssaa\" feature (see clause 6.1.8) in this query to UDM. If a
slice is not present in the Nssai resource returned by UDM, i.e. not
subscribed by the UE or subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization, the slice shall not be selected by the PGW-C+SMF.

#### 6.1.3.8 Resource: SessionManagementSubscriptionData (Document)
##### 6.1.3.8.1 Description
This resource represents the Session Management subscription data for a SUPI.
It is queried by the SMF during session setup, using query parameters
representing the selected network slice and the DNN. The SMF is responsible
for enforcing the user session management subscription data.
UDM will only recognize subscribed DNNs in this resource so for instance, in
case SMF receives indication from AMF that the DNN was authorized based on the
wildcard APN in the Selection Mode Value, SMF shall include the wildcard DNN
in the query parameter and SMF will receive SessionManagementSubscriptionData
for the Wildcard DNN. Any request for non-subscribed DNN will be rejected with
\"404 Not Found\".
This resource is also queried by the PGW-C+SMF during PDN connection
establishment in the EPC, to select the S-NSSAI for the APN/DNN of the PDN
connection, see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.11.0a.5.
NOTE: The PGW-C+SMF shall also retrieve the Nssai resource from UDM, to avoid
selection a slice that is subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization (see clause 6.1.3.2.1).

### 6.1.7 Error Handling
#### 6.1.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
Protocol errors handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.7 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 6.1.7.3 Application Errors
_The common application errors defined in the Table 5.2.7.2-1 in 3GPP TS
29.500 [4] may also be used for the Nudm__ SubscriberDataManagement _service._
The following application errors listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1 are specific for
the _Nudm__ SubscriberDataManagement service.
Table 6.1.7.3-1: Application errors
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Application Error | HTTP status code | Description | +======================+======================+======================+ | NF_CONSUMER | 307 Temporary | The request has been | | _REDIRECT_ONE_TXN | Redirect | asked to be | | | | redirected to a | | | | specified target for | | | | one transaction. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND | 308 Permanent | The request has been | | | Redirect | asked to be | | | | redirected to a | | | | specified target. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | DATA_NOT_FOUND | 404 Not Found | The requested UE | | | | subscription data is | | | | not found/does not | | | | exist. | | | | | | | | This error is | | | | applicable to all | | | | Nudm_SDM GET | | | | operations. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | USER_NOT_FOUND | 404 Not Found | The user does not | | | | exist | | | | | | | | This error is | | | | applicable to all | | | | Nudm_SDM GET | | | | operations. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND | 404 Not Found | It is used during | | | | the modification of | | | | an existing | | | | subscription when no | | | | corresponding | | | | context exists. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | GROUP_ID | 404 Not Found | The requested Group | | ENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND | | Identifier does not | | | | exist. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | SUBS | 404 Not Found | The subscription | | CRIPTION_NOT_FOUND | | does not exist. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | UNSUPP | 501 Not Implemented | The SDM Subscription | | ORTED_RESOURCE_URI | | contains unsupported | | | | resource URI to be | | | | monitored. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
### 6.1.8 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.1.8-1 are defined for the Nudm_SDM API. They
shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.1.8-1: Supported Features
+----------------+----------------------+-------------------------+ | Feature number | Feature Name | Description | +================+======================+=========================+ | 1 | SharedData | When receiving a | | | | Nudm_SDM_Get service | | | | operation request to | | | | retrieve a UE\'s | | | | individual subscription | | | | data, and the request | | | | does not contain a | | | | supported-features | | | | query parameter | | | | indicating support of | | | | this feature, the UDM | | | | shall not include | | | | Shared Data Ids in the | | | | response. Instead the | | | | UDM may -- based on | | | | operator policy -- take | | | | no further action (i.e. | | | | allow the UE to get | | | | services based on only | | | | the UE\'s individual | | | | subscription data), or | | | | send the shared data as | | | | individual data (this | | | | may result in | | | | notifications of | | | | individual subscription | | | | data change -- if so | | | | subscribed -- when | | | | shared data, which are | | | | sent as individual | | | | data, are modified, | | | | and/or when the UE\'s | | | | Shared Data IDs are | | | | modified). | +----------------+----------------------+-------------------------+ | 2 | ImmediateReport | When a NF consumer | | | | detects the UDM support | | | | ImmediateReport | | | | feature, it can | | | | indicate an | | | | immediateReport flag | | | | when invoking | | | | Nudm_SDM_Subscribe | | | | service operation. If | | | | UDM supports | | | | ImmediateReport | | | | received | | | | Nudm_SDM_Subscribe | | | | service operation | | | | request, it shall | | | | return the resource | | | | representation(s) of | | | | the monitored | | | | resource(s) in the | | | | service operation | | | | response body. | +----------------+----------------------+-------------------------+ | 3 | PatchReport | If some of the | | | | modifications included | | | | in the PATCH request | | | | are not successfully | | | | implemented, the UDM | | | | reports the result of | | | | PATCH request execution | | | | to the consumer. See | | | | clause 5.2.7.2 of | | | | 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]. | +----------------+----------------------+-------------------------+ | 4 | Nssaa | If the NF consumer does | | | | not support this | | | | feature, the UDM shall | | | | not include information | | | | of S-NSSAI(s) subject | | | | to Network | | | | Slice-Specific | | | | Authentication and | | | | Authorization in Get | | | | response messages, | | | | immediate reports | | | | within Subscribe | | | | response messages, or | | | | data change | | | | notifications where the | | | | data change is limited | | | | to S-NSSAI(s) subject | | | | to Network | | | | Slice-Specific | | | | Authentication and | | | | Authorization. | +----------------+----------------------+-------------------------+ | 5 | CAGFeature | If the NF consumer does | | | | not support this | | | | feature, the UDM shall | | | | not include CAG | | | | information list in the | | | | message body with \"200 | | | | OK\" response | | | | (clause 5.2.2.2.3). The | | | | UDM performs action as | | | | executes step 2c of | | | | clause 5.3.2.2.2 and | | | | 5.3.2.2.3 if UE is | | | | allowed to access 5GS | | | | via CAG cell(s) only. | +----------------+----------------------+-------------------------+ | 13 | LimitedSubscriptions | An NF consumer | | | | supporting this feature | | | | shall use one | | | | subscription for the | | | | changes of subscription | | | | data sets per UE | | | | without additional | | | | filter criteria, or | | | | with a specific filter | | | | criteria (e.g. dnn | | | | and/or singleNssai). | | | | | | | | An NF consumer | | | | supporting this feature | | | | shall use one | | | | subscription for the | | | | changes of shared data | | | | sets. | +----------------+----------------------+-------------------------+
### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_SDM API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_SDM API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server,
by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_SDM service.
The Nudm_SDM API defines a single scope \"nudm-sdm\" for OAuth2 authorization
(as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it does not
define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
## 6.2 Nudm_UEContextManagement Service API
### 6.2.1 API URI
URIs of this API shall have the following root:
{apiRoot}/{apiName}/\/
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nudm-uecm\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.2.3.
### 6.2.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.2.2.1 General
HTTP/2, as defined in IETF RFC 7540 [13], shall be used as specified in clause
5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP messages and bodies for the Nudm_UECM service shall comply with the
OpenAPI [14] specification contained in Annex A3.
#### 6.2.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.2.2.2.1 General
The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
##### 6.2.2.2.2 Content type
The following content types shall be supported:
JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [15], signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [16] signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\"
JSON Merge Patch, as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [17], signalled by the content
type \"application/merge-patch+json\"
#### 6.2.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.2.2.3.1 General
The usage of HTTP custom headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

### 6.2.8 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.2.8-1 are defined for the Nudm_UECM API. They
shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.2.8-1: Supported Features
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
1 SharedData When receiving a Nudm_UECM_Registration service operation request
for a UE that shares subscription data with other UEs, and the request does
not indicate support of this feature by the service consumer, the UDM may --
based on operator policy -- decide to reject the registration. 2 PatchReport
If some of the modifications included in the PATCH request are not
successfully implemented, the UDM reports the result of PATCH request
execution to the consumer. See clause 5.2.7.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
### 6.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_UECM API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_UECM API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server,
by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_UECM service.
The Nudm_UECM API defines a single scope \"nudm-uecm\" for OAuth2
authorization (as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it
does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
## 6.3 Nudm_UEAuthentication Service API
### 6.3.1 API URI
URIs of this API shall have the following root:
{apiRoot}/{apiName}/\/
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nudm-ueau\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.3.3.
### 6.3.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.3.2.1 General

The following content types shall be supported:
JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [15], signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [16] signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\"
#### 6.3.2.3 HTTP custom headers

Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 6.3.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_UEAU API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_UEAU API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server,
by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_UEAU service.
The Nudm_UEAU API defines a single scope \"nudm-ueau\" for OAuth2
authorization (as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it
does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
## 6.4 Nudm_EventExposure Service API
### 6.4.1 API URI
URIs of this API shall have the following root:
{apiRoot}/\/\/
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nudm-ee\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.4.3.
### 6.4.2 Usage of HTTP

5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP messages and bodies for the Nudm_EE service shall comply with the OpenAPI
[14] specification contained in Annex A5.
#### 6.4.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.4.2.2.1 General
The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
##### 6.4.2.2.2 Content type
The following content types shall be supported:
JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [15], signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [16] signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\"
JSON Patch (IETF RFC 6902 [41]). The use of the JSON Patch format in a HTTP
request body shall be signalled by the content type \"application/json-
patch+json\".
#### 6.4.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.4.2.3.1 General
The usage of HTTP custom headers shall be supported as specified in clause

### 6.4.8 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.4.8-1 are defined for the Nudm_EE API. They
shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.4.8-1: Supported Features
+----------------+--------------+------------------------------------+ | Feature number | Feature Name | Description | +================+==============+====================================+ | 1 | PatchReport | If some of the modifications | | | | included in the PATCH request are | | | | not successfully implemented, the | | | | UDM reports the result of PATCH | | | | request execution to the consumer. | | | | See clause 5.2.7.2 of | | | | 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]. | +----------------+--------------+------------------------------------+ | X | IERSR | Immediate Event Report in | | | | Subscription Creation Response for | | | | events detected by another NF | | | | | | | | The UDM and the NF consumer (e.g. | | | | NEF) supporting this feature shall | | | | be able to handle the immediate | | | | event reports in the Subscription | | | | Creation Response for events with | | | | direct reporting by another NF | | | | (e.g. AMF, HSS), as specified in | | | | clause 5.5.2.2. | +----------------+--------------+------------------------------------+
### 6.4.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_EE API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_EE API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by
invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_EE service.
The Nudm_EE API defines a single scope \"nudm-ee\" for OAuth2 authorization
(as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it does not
define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
## 6.5 Nudm_ParameterProvision Service API
### 6.5.1 API URI
URIs of this API shall have the following root:
{apiRoot}/{apiName}/\/
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nudm-pp\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.5.3.
### 6.5.2 Usage of HTTP

5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP messages and bodies for the Nudm_PP service shall comply with the OpenAPI
[14] specification contained in Annex A6.
#### 6.5.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.5.2.2.1 General
The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

### 6.5.8 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.5.8-1 are defined for the Nudm_PP API. They
shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.5.8-1: Supported Features
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
1 PatchReport If some of the modifications included in the PATCH request are
not successfully implemented, the UDM reports the result of PATCH request
execution to the consumer. See clause 5.2.7.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
### 6.5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_PP API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_PP API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by
invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.8.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_PP service.
The Nudm_PP API defines a single scope \"nudm-pp\" for OAuth2 authorization
(as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it does not
define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
## 6.6 Nudm_NIDDAuthorization Service API
### 6.6.1 API URI
The Nudm_NIDDAuthorization service shall use the Nudm_NIDDAU API.
The API URI of the Nudm_NIDDAU API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/**
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nudm-niddau\".

### 6.6.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_NIDDAU API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF
RFC 6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_NIDDAU API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_NIDDAU service.
The Nudm_NIDDAU API defines a single scope \"nudm-niddau\" for OAuth2
authorization (as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it
does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
## 6.7 Nudm_MT Service API
### 6.7.1 API URI
URIs of this API shall have the following root:
{apiRoot}/{apiName}/\/
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nudm-mt\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.7.3.

#### 6.7.6.3 Simple data types and enumerations
In this release of this specification, no simple data types and enumerations
are defined for the Nudm_MT Service.
### 6.7.7 Error Handling
#### 6.7.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
#### 6.7.7.2 Protocol Errors
Protocol errors handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.7 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 6.7.7.3 Application Errors
The common application errors defined in the Table 5.2.7.2-1 in 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] may also be used for the Nudm_MT service. The following application errors
listed in Table 6.7.7.3-1 are specific for the _Nudm__ MT service.
Table 6.7.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description

### 6.7.8 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.7.8-1 are defined for the Nudm_MT API. They
shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

* * *
### 6.7.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_MT API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_MT API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by
invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_MT service.
The Nudm_MT API defines a single scope \"nudm-mt\" for OAuth2 authorization
(as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it does not
define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the Nudm Service API(s). It
consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications, in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [30] clause 5B).

###### ## Annex B (informative): Stateless UDMs
Figure B-1 shows a scenario where the stateless UDM receives and processes a
request from an NF.
Figure B-1: Stateless UDM
1\. The stateless UDM receives a request from an NF. This can be a request to
perform an Nudm service, or a Notification that the UDM has previously
subscribed to at the NF by means of a service the UDM consumes from the NF. In
the later case the NF can be the UDR.
2\. The UDM retrieves data from the UDR that are required to process the
request. This step can be skipped if the request was a notification from the
UDR and contained enough information so that the UDM can process the request.
3\. The UDM processes the received request. This can include consuming
services from other NFs, consuming services from the UDR (e.g. to update data
or subscribe to notifications), and sending notifications to NFs that have
subscribed at the UDM to receive notifications, and includes sending the
response to the NF (all not shown in the figure).
4\. The UDM locally deletes the data retrieved in step 2 and/or received in
step 1.
Figure B-2 shows a scenario where an AMF subscribes to notifications of data
change (permanent provisioned subscription data) at the stateless UDM. The UDM
(UDM 1) stores the subscription to notification in the UE\'s context data at
the UDR.
Figure B-2: Subscription to notification
1\. The stateless UDM 1 receives a subscribe request from an AMF; see clause
5.2.2.3.2.
2.-3 The UDM retrieves UE context data from the UDR to be able to perform
required plausibility checks; see 3GPP TS 29.504 [9] clause 5.2.2.2.2.
4\. The UDM creates a new sdm subscription at the UDR; see 3GPP TS 29.504 [9]
clause 5.2.2.6.3.
5\. The UDR sends a 201 Created response containig a subscription ID
6\. The UDM send a 201 Created response passing the subscription ID received
in step 5 to the AMF.
7\. Permanent provisioned Subscription data are modified at the UDR.
8\. The UDR selects a suitable UDM and sends a Notification; see 3GPP TS
29.504 [9] clause 5.2.2.8. In addition to the data that have changed, the
Notification request message can contain enough (unchanged) information (e.g.
the information that has been created in step 4) allowing the UDM to perform
step 10 without the need to additionally retrieve information from the UDR.
9\. The UDM responds with 204 No Content.
10\. The UDM notifies the AMF according to the callback URI of the AMF
contained in the Notification received in step 8; see clause 5.2.2.5.2.
11\. The AMF responds with 204 No Content.
Figure B-3 shows a scenario where an AMF registers at the stateless UDM. The
UDM (UDM 1) stores the registration in the UE\'s context data at the UDR. The
AMF then requests to update the registration e.g. due to change of PEI. This
request is sent to UDM2 which belongs to the same UDM group as UDM1.
Figure B-3: AMF Registration and Update
1\. The AMF discovers (by means of NRF query) and selects an UDM and sends the
register request;
2.-3 The UDM retrieves UE context data from the UDR e.g. to be able to perform
required plausibility checks;
4.-5 The UDM updates UE context data in the UDR. The UDM also performs other
actions not shown in the figure, e.g deregister an old AMF, notify a
subscribed NEF, ...
6\. The UDM acknowldeges the AMF registration. The AMF stores the UDM group ID
as discovered and selected in step 1. The UDM locally deletes the data
retrieved in step 3.
7\. The AMF sends an update request (e.g. change of PEI) to one of the
available UDMs (UDM2) that belongs to the same UDM group as UDM1.
8.-9. The UDM retrieves UE context data from the UDR e.g. to be able to
perform required plausibility checks;
10.-11. The UDM updates UE context data in the UDR.The UDM also performs other
actions not shown in the figure, e.g. notify a subscribed NEF, ...
12\. The UDM sends update response to the AMF and locally deletes the data
retrieved in step 9.
NOTE: When a previously received Location Header or Callback URI is used for a
subsequent UDM contact, the authority part may need to be replaced to point to
the selected UDM.
Figure B-4 shows a scenario where an AF requests a subscription for all UEs
(any UE) for a given network event. The NEF discovers all UDM NFs providing
the necessary service to perform a bulk subscription. If one or several UDM
Group IDs are received, NEF selects only one instance of UDM for each Group ID
in order to perform the bulk subscription.
Figure B-4: Any UE Subscription
1\. An AF subscribes to a network event (e.g. SUPI-PEI association change) for
any UE (i.e. all UEs)
2\. The NEF discovers (by means of NRF query) all UDM instances supporting the
required service (e.g. nudm-ee). The NEF selects an UDM instance (e.g. UDM 1)
from each UDM Group ID discovered (UDM 1 and UDM 2 are in the same UDM Group
ID) and sends the subscribe request. The NEF also stores the UDM Group ID
information to select a UDM for subsequent subscriptions.
3-4. The UDM retrieves data from the UDR for group of UEs, e.g. to be able to
perform required plausibility checks
5-6. The UDM stores data for group of UEs in the UDR.
7\. The UDM acknowldeges the NEF subscription request. The UDM locally deletes
the data retrieved in step 3.
> Steps 7-12 in Figure B-3 are performed. As result of the subscription, NEF
> is notified by UDM 2 (change of PEI). Subsequently, when the event occurs
> for any UE (within the SUPI range, if applicable, served by the UDM Group
> ID), NEF is notified by either UDM1 or UDM 2.
###### ## Annex C (informative): SUCI encoding
The structure of the Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI) is defined in
3GPP TS 23.003 [8].
When SUCI needs to be sent as a character string (e.g. as a string in a JSON
payload of any of the service operations defined in the APIs defined in this
specification), the SUCI is composed as an UTF-8 character string, where the
different components are separated by the \"minus\" character \"-\" (UTF-8
0x2D).
These components shall be formatted as follows:
1) SUPI Type: a single decimal digit, from 0 to 7, formatted as a single UTF-8
character (UTF-8 0x30 to 0x37)
2) Home Network Identifier.
When the SUPI Type is an IMSI, the Home Network Identifier consists on 2
components: MCC and MNC, separated by the \"minus\" character; these
components are formatted as a string of 3 characters for MCC and a string of 2
or 3 characters for MNC (UTF-8 0x30 to 0x39).
When the SUPI type is a Network Specific Identifier, Global Line Identifier
(GLI) or Global Cable Identifier (GCI) the Home Network Identifier consists of
a string of characters with a variable length, formatted as an UTF-8 character
string.
3) Routing Indicator, consisting of 1 to 4 decimal digits formatted as a
string of 1 to 4 characters (UTF-8 0x30 to 0x39).
4) Protection Scheme Identifier, consisting in a value in the range of 0 to
15, representing a single hexadecimal digit, formatted as a single UTF-8
character (UTF-8 0x30 to 0x39, or 0x41 to 0x46, or 0x61 to 0x66).
5) Home Network Public Key Identifier, consisting in a value in the range 0 to
255, formatted as a sequence of 1 to 3 decimal digits, formatted of 1 to 3
UTF-8 characters (UTF-8 0x30 to 0x39).
6) Scheme Output, consisting of a string of UTF-8 characters with a variable
length, or a sequence of hexadecimal digits, dependent on the used protection
scheme. It represents the output of a public key protection scheme specified
in Annex C of 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] or the output of a protection scheme
specified by the HPLMN.
EXAMPLES:
\- SUPI is IMSI-based; MCC=123, MNC=45, MSIN: 0123456789
SUPI type: 0 (IMSI)
Routing Identifier: 012
Protection Scheme: 0 (NULL scheme)
Home Network Public Key Identifier: 0
Scheme output = MSIN (cleartext)
SUCI UTF-8 string:
> \"0-123-45-012-0-0-0123456789\"
NOTE: According to 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] (see annex C.2) the NULL scheme returns
the same output as the input (i.e. MSIN in this example), which can be packed
BCD coded. However, when formatted as character string in JSON, the scheme
output is expected to be reformatted from packed BCD (5 octets in this
example) to a sequence of decimal digits in UTF-8 (10 characters in this
example).
\- SUPI is IMSI-based, MCC=123, MNC=45, MSIN: 9876543210 (coded as 10
hexadecimal digits using 5 octets packed BCD coding: 89, 67, 45, 23, 01)
> SUPI type: 0 (IMSI)
>
> Routing Identifier: 0002
>
> Protection Scheme: 1 (Profile A)
>
> Home Network Public Key Identifier: 17
Scheme output = ECC ephemeral public key (32 octets, first bolded part below)
+ Encrypted MSIN (where MSIN has 10 digits i.e. 5 octets coded as hexadecimal
digits using packed BCD coding, italic part below) + MAC tag (8 octets, last
bolded part below) = 50 octets = 100 hexadecimal characters (NOTE: the
encrypted content below is fictitious).
