## 4.2 Nnef_EventExposure Service
### 4.2.1 Service Description
#### 4.2.1.1 Overview
The Nnef_EventExposure service, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], is provided
by the Network Exposure Function (NEF).
This service:
\- allows NF service consumers to subscribe, modify and unsubscribe for
application events; and
\- notifies NF service consumers with a corresponding subscription about
observed events on the NEF.
The types of observed events applicable for NEF include:
\- Service experience;
\- UE mobility;
\- UE communication; and
\- Exceptions.
The target of the event reporting may include one or more UE(s), a group of
UEs or any UE (i.e. all UEs). When an event to which the NF service consumer
has subscribed occurs, the NEF reports the requested information to the NF
service consumer based on the event reporting information definition requested
by the NF service consumer.
#### 4.2.1.2 Service Architecture
The 5G System Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The Network Data
Analytics Exposure architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.288 [14].
The Nnef_EventExposure service is part of the Nnef service-based interface
exhibited by the Network Exposure Function (NEF).
Known consumers of the Nnef_EventExposure service are:

#### 4.2.1.3 Network Functions
##### 4.2.1.3.1 Network Exposure Function (NEF)
The Network Exposure Function (NEF) is a functional element that provides
application or user related information to the NF service consumers as defined
in this specification.
The NEF allows the NF consumer(s) to (un)subscribe to notifications of
monitoring observed event, and sends the notification to the NF consumer(s)
when a subscribed event is detected.
##### 4.2.1.3.2 NF Service Consumers
The known NF service consumers are as follows:
The Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF):
\- supports (un)subscribing to notifications of subscribed event(s) from the
NEF;

#### 4.2.2.2 Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation
##### 4.2.2.2.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to subscribe to
notifications on specified event(s) or modify an existing subscription.
The following are the types of events for which a subscription to
notifications can be created:
\- Service experience;
\- UE mobility;
\- UE communication; and
\- Exceptions;
The following procedures using the Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe service
operation are supported:
\- creating a new subscription;
\- modifying an existing subscription.
##### 4.2.2.2.2 Creating a new subscription
Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 illustrates the creation of a Network Exposure Event
Subscription.
Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1: Creation of a subscription
To subscribe to event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an
HTTP POST request to the NEF with: \"{apiRoot}/nnef-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions\" as request URI as shown in step 1
of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, and the \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as
request body.
The \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure shall include:
\- a URI where to receive the requested notifications as \"notifUri\"
attribute; and
\- a Notification Correlation Identifier assigned by the NF service consumer
for the requested notifications as \"notifId\" attribute.
\- description of subscribed event information as \"eventsSubs\" attribute by
using one or more \"NefEventSubs\" data.
The \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure may also include:
\- the description of the event reporting information as \"eventsRepInfo\"
attribute.
The \"NefEventSubs\" data structure shall include:
\- an event to subscribe to as a \"event\" attribute; and
\- event filter information as \"eventFilter\" attribute associated with the
event.
The \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute may include:
\- event notification method (periodic, one time, on event detection) as
\"notifMethod\" attribute;
\- Maximum Number of Reports as \"maxReportNbr\" attribute;
\- Monitoring Duration as \"monDur\" attribute;
\- repetition period for periodic reporting as \"repPeriod\" attribute;
\- immediate reporting indication as \"immRep\" attribute;
\- sampling ratio as \"sampRatio\" attribute; and/or
\- group reporting guard time as \"grpRepTime\" attribute.
If the NEF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to an
internal error or an error in the HTTP POST request, the NEF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
Upon successful reception of an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nnef-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions\" as request URI and
\"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as request body, the NEF shall create
a new \"Individual Event Exposure Subscription\" resource, store the
subscription and send an HTTP \"201 Created\" response, as shown in step 2 of
figure 4.2.2.2.2-1. The NEF shall include in the \"201 Created\" response:
\- a Location header field; and
\- an \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data type in the payload body.
The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created individual
application session context resource i.e. \"{apiRoot}/nnef-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\".
The \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data type payload body shall contain the
representation of the created \"Individual Network Exposure Event
Subscription\".
When the \"monDur\" attribute is included in the response by the NEF, it
represents NEF selected expiry time that is equal or less than the expiry time
received in the request.
When the \"immRep\" attribute is included and sets to \"true\" in the
subscription and the subscribed events are available, the NEF shall include
the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response.
When the sampling ratio attribute, as \"sampRatio\", is included in the
subscription, the NEF shall select a random subset of UEs among the target UEs
according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the
selected subset of UEs.
When the group reporting guard time, as \"grpRepTime\" attribute, is included
in the subscription, the NEF shall accumulate all the event reports for the
target UEs until the group reporting guard time expires. Then, the NEF shall
notify the NF service consumer using the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service
operation, as described in clause 4.2.2.4.
##### 4.2.2.2.3 Modifying an existing subscription
Figure 4.2.2.2.3-1 illustrates the modification of an existing subscription.
Figure 4.2.2.2.3-1: Modification of an existing subscription
To modify an existing subscription to event notifications, the NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnef-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request
URI, as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, where \"{**subscriptionId**}\"
is the subscription correlation ID of the existing subscription. The
\"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure is included as request body as
described in clause 4.2.2.2.2.
NOTE 1: An alternate NF service consumer than the one that requested the
generation of the subscription resource can send the PUT request.
NOTE 2: The \"notifUri\" attribute within the NefEventExposureSubsc data
structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent to
a new NF service consumer.
NOTE 3: The \"monDur\" attribute within the NefEventExposureSubsc data
structure can be modified to extend the expiry time to keep receiving
notifications.
If the NEF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP PUT request due to an
internal error or an error in the HTTP PUT request, the NEF shall send an HTTP
error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NEF determines the received
HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the NEF shall send an HTTP redirect
response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Upon successful reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnef-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request
URI and \"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as request body, the NEF
shall update the subscription and send an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the
\"NefEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as response body containing the
representation of the modified \"Individual Network Exposure Event
Subscription\", or an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response, as shown in step 2 of
figure 4.2.2.2.3-1.
When the \"monDur\" attribute is included in the response by the NEF, it
represents NEF selected expiry time that is equal or less than the expiry time
received in the request.
When the \"immRep\" attribute is included and sets to \"true\" in the
subscription and the subscribed events are available, the NEF shall include
the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP PUT response.
When the sampling ratio, as \"sampRatio\" attribute, is included in the
subscription, the NEF shall select a random subset of UEs among the target UEs
according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the
selected subset of UEs.
When the group reporting guard time, as \"grpRepTime\" attribute, is included
in the subscription, the NEF shall accumulate all the event reports for the
target UEs until the group reporting guard time expires. Then, the NEF shall
notify the NF service consumer using the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service
operation, as described in clause 4.2.2.4.
#### 4.2.2.3 Nnef_EventExposure_Unsubscribe service operation
##### 4.2.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to unsubscribe from
event notifications.
The following procedure using the Nnef_EventExposure_Unsubscribe service
operation is supported:
\- unsubscription from event notifications.
##### 4.2.2.3.2 Unsubscription from event notifications
Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1 illustrates the unsubscription from event notifications.
Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1: Unsubscription from event notifications
To unsubscribe from event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an
HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/nnef-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request
URI, as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.3.2-1, where \"{**subscriptionId**}\"
is the subscription correlation identifier of the existing subscription
resource that is to be deleted.
If the NEF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP DELETE request due to
an internal error or an error in the HTTP DELETE request, the NEF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NEF determines the received
HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the NEF shall send an HTTP
redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Upon successful reception of an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnef-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request
URI, the NEF shall remove the corresponding subscription and send an HTTP
\"204 No Content\" response, as shown in step 2 of figure 4.2.2.3.2-1.
#### 4.2.2.4 Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service operation
##### 4.2.2.4.1 General
The Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service operation enables the NEF to notify the
NF service consumer(s) that the previously subscribed application related
event occurred.
The following procedure using the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service operation
is supported:

##### 4.2.2.4.2 Notification about subscribed events
Figure 4.2.2.4.2-1 illustrates the notification about subscribed events.
Figure 4.2.2.4.2-1: Notification about subscribed events
If the NEF observes application related event(s) for which an NF service
consumer has subscribed, the NEF shall send an HTTP POST request as shown in
step 1 of figure 4.2.2.4.2-1, with the \"{notifUri}\" as request URI
containing the value previously provided by the NF service consumer within the
corresponding subscription, and the \"NefEventExposureNotif\" data structure.
The \"NefEventExposureNotif\" data structure shall include:
\- notification correlation ID provided by the NF service consumer during the
subscription as \"notifId\" attribute; and
\- information about the observed event(s) within the \"eventNotifs\"
attribute that shall contain for each observed event an
\"NefEventNotification\" data structure that shall include:
\- the application related event as \"event\" attribute;

### 5.1.7 Error Handling
#### 5.1.7.1 General
For the Nnef_EventExposure API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors and application
errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] shall be supported
for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as
mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Nnef_EventExposure API.
#### 5.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Nnef_EventExposure service are specified.
#### 5.1.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nnef_EventExposure service are listed
in Table 5.1.7.3-1.

* * *
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
### 5.1.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.1.8-1 are defined for the Nnef_EventExposure
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 5.1.8-1: Supported Features
* * *
Feature number Feature Name Description 1 ServiceExperience This feature
indicates support for the \"SVC_EXPERIENCE\" event. 2 UeMobility This feature
indicates support for the \"UE_MOBILITY\" event. 3 UeCommunication This
feature indicates support for the \"UE_COMM\" event. 4 Exceptions This feature
indicates support for the \"EXCEPTIONS\" event. 5 ES3XX Extended Support for
3xx redirections. This feature indicates the support of redirection for any
service operation, according to Stateless NF procedures as specified in
subclauses 6.5.3.2 and 6.5.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] and according to HTTP
redirection principles for indirect communication, as specified in subclause
6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
* * *
### 5.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nnef_EventExposure API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnef_EventExposure API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnef_EventExposure service.
The Nnef_EventExposure API defines a single scope \"nnef-eventexposure\" for
the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource
or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications in YAML
format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[7] and clause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] for further information).
