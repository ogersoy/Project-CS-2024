# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

UDSF Unstructured Data Storage Function
# 4 Overview
The UDSF, as depicted in Figure 4.1-1 below, is described in clause 4.2.5 of
3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. Any of the 5GS NFs can make use of the UDSF to store and
retrieve unstructured data, i.e., data that is not defined in 3GPP
specifications. The UDSF is deployed in the same network where the CP NF is
located and the same UDSF may be shared by all the NFs in the PLMN to
store/retrieve their respective data or an NF may have its own UDSF depending
on operator configuration.
NOTE 1: Structured data in this specification refers to data for which the
structure is defined in 3GPP specifications. Unstructured data refers to data
for which the structure is not defined in 3GPP specifications.

request, if due to an operator policy, an expiry time is enforced or if the
value in the request exceeded a maximum allowed expiry time.
2b. On failure, if one or more monitoredResourceUris from the request don\'t
exist in the UDSF, 409 Conflict shall be returned together with the non-
existing monitoredResourceUris.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the PUT response body.
#### 5.2.2.8 Unsubscribe
##### 5.2.2.8.1 General
The following procedures using the Unsubscribe service operation are
supported:
\- Unsubscription to notification of data change
##### 5.2.2.8.2 Unsubscription to notifications of data change
Figure 5.2.2.8.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the UDSF to Unsubscribe to notifications of data change. The
request contains the subscriptionId, and query parameter client-id, optionally
query parameters supported-features and get-previous.
Figure 5.2.2.8.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes to notifications
1\. The NF service consumer sends a DELETE request to the resource
representing the subscription to notification of data change which is
indicated by the subscriptionId.
2a. On success, the UDSF shall respond with \"204 No Content\" if an empty
response body is returned, i.e. the get-previous query parameter was not
included in the request.
2b. On success, the UDSF shall respond with \"200 OK\" with
NotificationSubscription containing the NotificationSubscription value before
the delete if get-previous was indicated in the request.
2c. If the service operation cannot be authorized due to e.g. the client-id
query parameter does not match the clientId of the existing resource, the UDSF
shall respond with \"403 Forbidden\" with including additional error
information in the response body (in \"ProblemDetails\" element).
2d. If there is no valid subscription to notification of data change which is
indicated by the request, the UDSF shall respond with \"404 Not Found\" with
including additional error information in the response body (in
\"ProblemDetails\" element).
2e. If one or more conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to
false, the UDSF shall respond with \"412 Precondition Failed\".
NotificationSubscription shall be included in the response if get-previous was
indicated in the request.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the PUT response body.
# 6 API Definitions
## 6.1 Nudsf_DataRepository Service API
### 6.1.1 Introduction
The Nudsf_DataRepository service shall use the Nudsf_DataRepository API.
The API URI of the Nudsf_DataRepository API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/**
The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause
4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nudsf-dr\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.1.3.
### 6.1.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.1.2.1 General
HTTP/2, IETF RFC 7540 [11], shall be used as specified in clause 5 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
The OpenAPI [6] specification of HTTP messages and content bodies for the
Nudsf_DataRepository API is contained in Annex A.
#### 6.1.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.1.2.2.1 General
See clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] for the usage of HTTP standard headers.
##### 6.1.2.2.2 Content type
The following content types shall be supported:
\- JSON, IETF RFC 8259 [12], shall be used as content type of the HTTP bodies
specified in the present specification as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4]. The use of the JSON format shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
\- \"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional
details of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by the
content type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [13].
\- JSON Patch (IETF RFC 6902 [14]). The use of the JSON Patch format in a HTTP
request body shall be signalled by the content type \"application/json-
patch+json\".
Multipart messages shall also be supported possibly indicating other content-
types as described in clause 6.1.2.4.
##### 6.1.2.2.3 Cache-Control
As described in IETF RFC 7234 [17] clause 5.2, a \"Cache-Control\" header
should be included in HTTP responses carrying a representation of cacheable
resources. If it is included, it shall contain a \"max-age\" value, indicating
the amount of time in seconds after which the received response is considered
stale.
The \"max-age\" value shall be configurable by operator policy.
##### 6.1.2.2.4 ETag
As described in IETF RFC 7232 [16] clause 2.3, an \"ETag\" (entity-tag) header
should be included in HTTP responses carrying a representation of cacheable or
modifiable resources to allow an NF Service Consumer performing a conditional
GET request with an \"If-None-Match\" header or a conditional PUT/PATCH/DELETE
request with an \"If-Match\" header. If it is included, it shall contain a
server-generated strong validator, that allows further matching of this value
(included in subsequent client requests) with a given resource representation
stored in the server or in a cache.
##### 6.1.2.2.5 If-None-Match
As described in IETF RFC 7232 [16] clause 3.2, an NF Service Consumer may
issue conditional GET or PUT requests towards UDSF by including an \"If-None-
Match\" header in HTTP requests containing one or several entity tags received
in previous responses for the same resource.
If the If-None-Match header is included with the PUT method, it shall be used
with a value of \"*\" to prevent the inadvertent modification of an existing
representation of the target resource when the client believes that the
resource does not have a current representation.
##### 6.1.2.2.6 If-Match
As described in IETF RFC 7232 [16] clause 3.1, an NF Service Consumer may
issue conditional PUT/PATCH/DELETE request towards UDSF by including an \"If-
Match\" header in HTTP requests containing an entity tag received in previous
responses for the same resource.
##### 6.1.2.2.7 Last-Modified
As described in IETF RFC 7232 [16] clause 2.2, a \"Last-Modified\" header
should be included in HTTP responses carrying a representation of cacheable
resources to allow an NF Service Consumer performing a conditional request
with \"If-Modified-Since\" header.
##### 6.1.2.2.8 If-Modified-Since
As described in IETF RFC 7232 [16] clause 3.3, an NF Service Consumer may
issue conditional GET request towards UDSF, by including an \"If-Modified-
Since\" header in HTTP requests.
##### 6.1.2.2.9 When to Use Entity-Tags and Last-Modified Dates
Both \"ETag\" and \"Last-Modified\" headers should be sent in the same HTTP
response as stated in IETF RFC 7232 [16] clause 2.4.
NOTE: \"ETag\" is a stronger validator than the \"Last-Modified\" and is
preferred.
If the UDSF included an \"ETag\" header with the resource then a conditional
GET request for this resource shall be performed with the \"If-None-Match\"
header, and a PUT/PATCH/DELETE request for this resource shall be performed
with the \"If-Match\" header.
##### 6.1.2.2.10 Content-Location
As described in IETF RFC 7231 [15] clause 3.1.4.2, the UDSF shall include the
Content-Location header set to the URI of the expired Record when sending a
Notification to an NF Consumer.
#### 6.1.2.3 HTTP custom headers
The mandatory HTTP custom header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4] shall be applicable.
#### 6.1.2.4 HTTP multipart messages
##### 6.1.2.4.1 General
HTTP multipart messages shall be supported to transfer the opaque Record and
Block Information in the following service operations (and HTTP messages):
\- Record (PUT/GET/DELETE)
\- BlockCollection (GET)
\- RecordNotification (POST)
NOTE: In the clauses below, this specification deviates in the definition of
the Content-ID header from IETF RFC 2045 [20] in that there is no need for the
Content-ID to be \"world unique\", as in this specification the Content-ID is
only required to be unique within the context of a Record, BlockCollection or
RecordNotification.
##### 6.1.2.4.2 Record
The Record is encoded as an HTTP multipart message with the multipart/mixed
content-type as described in IETF RFC 2046 [21].
The boundary parameter is used to delimit each part (Start of parts to
RecordMeta, RecordMeta to Block, Block to Block and Block to End of parts) and
shall be set to a value as in accordance with IETF RFC 2046 [21].
The RecordMeta part shall be the first part, and shall always be present. It
shall include a Content-ID header that may be set to an unquoted value of
\"meta\" or any other suitable value, for example as described in IETF RFC
2045 [20], the Content-Type (see IETF RFC 2045 [20]) header set to
\"application/json\" and include JSON content for the RecordMeta.
Zero or more Block parts may follow the RecordMeta Part. For each Block part
in the HTTP multipart/mixed message, the Block part shall include a Content-ID
header identifying the Block with the value of the blockId, a Content-Type
(see IETF RFC 2045 [20]) header indicating the MIME type of the Block (any
value), e.g. application/octet-stream, application/json or another applicable
MIME type and the Content-Transfer-Encoding (see IETF RFC 2045 [20]) header
with an appropriate value.
##### 6.1.2.4.3 BlockCollection
The BlockCollection is encoded as an HTTP multipart message with the
multipart/parallel content-type as described in IETF RFC 2046 [21].
The boundary parameter is used to delimit each part (Start of parts to Block,
Block to Block and Block to End of parts) and shall be set to a value as in
accordance with IETF RFC 2046 [21].
For the BlockCollection, zero or more Block parts may be included. For each
Block part in the HTTP multipart/parallel message, the Block part shall
include a Content-ID header identifying the Block with the value of the
blockId, a Content-Type header indicating the MIME type of the Block (any
value) e.g. application/octet-stream, application/json or another applicable
MIME type and the Content-Transfer-Encoding (see IETF RFC 2045 [20]) header
with an appropriate value.
##### 6.1.2.4.4 RecordNotification
The RecordNotification is encoded as an HTTP multipart message with the
multipart/mixed content-type as described in IETF RFC 2046 [21].
The boundary parameter is used to delimit each part (Start of parts to
RecordNotification, RecordNotification to RecordMeta, RecordMeta to Block,
Block to Block and Block to End of parts) and shall be set to a value in
accordance with IETF RFC 2046 [21].
The RecordNotification shall be the first part, and shall always be present.
It shall include a Content-ID header set to an unquoted value (see IETF RFC
2045 [20]), of \"recordnotification\" or any other suitable value, for example
as described in IETF RFC 2045 [20], the Content-Type (see IETF RFC 2045 [20])
header set to \"application/json\" and include JSON content for the
NotificationDescription.
The RecordMeta part shall be the second part, and shall always be present. It
shall include a Content-ID header set to an unquoted value of \"meta\" or any
other suitable value, for example as described in IETF RFC 2045 [20], the
Content-Type (see IETF RFC 2045 [20]) header set to \"application/json\" and
include JSON content for the RecordMeta.
Zero or more Block parts may follow the RecordMeta Part. For each Block part
in the HTTP multipart/mixed message, the Block part shall include a Content-ID
header identifying the Block with the value of the blockId, a Content-Type
(see IETF RFC 2045 [20]) header indicating the MIME type of the Block (any
value), e.g. application/octet-stream, application/json or another applicable
MIME type and the Content-Transfer-Encoding (see IETF RFC 2045 [20]) header
with an appropriate value.

##### 6.1.6.3.3 Enumeration: ComparisonOperator
The enumeration ComparisonOperator represents the comparison of an array of
strings to a string value. The comparison shall be based on lexicographical
order. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 6.1.6.3.3-1.
Table 6.1.6.3.3-1: Enumeration ComparisonOperator
Enumeration value Description Applicability
* * *
\"EQ\" The array contains the string value.  
\"NEQ\" The array does not contain the string value. AdvancedQuery \"GT\" The
array contains a string that is greater than the string value. AdvancedQuery
\"GTE\" The array contains a string that is greater than or equal to the
string value. AdvancedQuery \"LT\" The array contains a string that is less
than the string value. AdvancedQuery \"LTE\" The array contains a string that
is less than or equal to the string value. AdvancedQuery
NOTE: It\'s recommended to use GT/GTE/LT/LTE on single value tags. If not, the
logical operator \"NOT\" applied over the comparison operator \"GT\" evaluates
to \"true\" if **there are no members** in the array that are greater than the
value.
##### 6.1.6.3.4 Enumeration: ConditionOperator

### 6.1.7 Error Handling
#### 6.1.7.1 General
For the Nudsf_DataRepository API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors and application
errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] shall be supported
for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as
mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Nudsf_DataRepository API.
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
Protocol errors handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.7 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 6.1.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nudsf_DataRepository service are listed
in Table 6.1.7.3-1.
Table 6.1.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
TTL_VALUE_NOT_ALLOWED 403 Forbidden The ttl value indicated in the request
exceeds the maximum value allowed in the UDSF. SUBSCRIPTION_EXISTS 403
Forbidden The subscription indicated in the HTTP/2 request is not authorized
to be operated. REALM_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The realm indicated in the
HTTP/2 request is unavailable in the UDSF. STORAGE_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The
storage indicated in the HTTP/2 request is unavailable in the UDSF.
RECORD_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The record indicated in the HTTP/2 request is
unavailable in the UDSF. BLOCK_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The block indicated in
the HTTP/2 request is unavailable in the UDSF. SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND 404 Not
Found The subscription indicated in the HTTP/2 request is unavailable in the
UDSF.
## 6.1.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 6.1.8-1 are defined for the
Nudsf_DataRepository API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility
mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.1.8-1: Supported Features
+----------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+ | Feature number | Feature Name | Description | +================+===============+===================================+ | 1 | AdvancedQuery | If an NF consumer detects that | | | | the UDSF supports the | | | | AdvancedQuery feature, it may use | | | | values of the ComparisonOperator | | | | besides \"EQ\" and may also use | | | | the cond attribute of the | | | | SearchCondition. | | | | | | | | If an NF consumer detects that | | | | the UDSF does not support the | | | | AdvancedQuery feature, it shall | | | | only use a value of \"EQ\" of the | | | | ComparisonOperator and shall not | | | | use the cond attribute of the | | | | SearchCondition. | +----------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+
## 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudsf_DataRepository API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the \ API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudsf_DataRepository service.
The Nudsf_DataRepository API defines a single scope \"nudsf-dr\" for the
entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or
operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
## A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications in YAML
format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [7] clause 5B).

###### ## Annex B (informative): Search Examples
The conditional expression is defined by the following Extended Backus-Naur
Form (EBNF) [18].
Figure B-1: Search Expression
Search_Expression ::= Search_Comparison \| Search_Condition
Figure B-2: Search Comparison
Search_Comparison ::= Tag ( \'EQ\' \| \'NEQ\' \| \'GT\' \| \'GTE\' \| \'LT\'
\| \'LTE\' ) Value
Figure B-3: Search Condition
Search_Condition ::= Search_Expression ( ( \'AND\' \| \'OR\' )
Search_Expression )+
Figure B-4: Search ConditionNot
Search_ConditionNot ::= \'NOT\' Search_Expression
Example:
Find all records where the tag \"ueId\" is equal to \"455345\" OR the tag
\"supi\" is equal to \"imsi-999559807001001\":
{
\"cond\": \"OR\",
\"items\": [
{
\"op\": \"EQ\",
\"tag\" : \"ueId\",
\"value\" : \"455345\"
},
{
\"op\": \"EQ\",
\"tag\" : \"supi\",
\"value\" : \"imsi-999559807001001\"
}
]
}
###### ## Annex C (informative): HTTP Multipart Examples
## C.1 General
This clause provides examples of the HTTP multipart messages. The examples do
not aim to be a complete representation of the HTTP message, e.g. additional
information or headers can be included.
This Annex is informative and the normative descriptions in this specification
prevail over the description in this Annex if there is any difference.
