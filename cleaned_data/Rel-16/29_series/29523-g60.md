# 4 Npcf_EventExposure Service
## 4.1 Service Description
### 4.1.1 Overview
The Policy Event Exposure Service, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP
TS 23.503 [4], is provided by the Policy Control Function (PCF).
This service:
\- allows NF service consumers to subscribe, modify and unsubscribe from
policy control events; and
\- notifies NF service consumers with a corresponding subscription about
observed events on the PCF.
The types of observed events include:
\- PLMN identifier notification; and
\- Access type change.
The target of the event reporting may include a group of UE(s) or any UE (i.e.
all UEs). When an event occurs, to which the NF service consumer has
subscribed, the PCF reports the requested information to the NF service
consumer based on the event reporting information definition requested by the
NF service consumer (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], subclause 4.15.1).
### 4.1.2 Service Architecture
The 5G System Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The Policy and
Charging related 5G architecture and signalling flows are also described in
3GPP TS 29.513 [8].
The Policy Event Exposure Service (Npcf_EventExposure) is part of the Npcf
service-based interface exhibited by the Policy Control Function (PCF).
The only known NF service consumer of the Npcf_EventExposure service is the
Network Exposure Function (NEF).
The Npcf_EventExposure service is provided by the PCF and consumed by NF
service consumers (e.g. NEF), as shown in figure 4.1.2-1 for the SBI
representation model and in figure 4.1.2-2 for reference point representation
model.
Figure 4.1.2-1: Npcf_EventExposure service Architecture, SBI representation
Figure 4.1.2-2: Npcf_EventExposure service Architecture, reference point
representation
NOTE: The NWDAF can be a consumer of the Npcf_EventExposure service to perform
data collection. However, there is no data collected from the PCF by the NWDAF
defined in this release of the specification.
### 4.1.3 Network Functions
#### 4.1.3.1 Policy Control Function (PCF)
The PCF (Policy Control Function) is a functional element that encompasses
policy control decision and flow based charging control functionalities as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [9], access and mobility policy decisions for the
control of the UE Service Area Restrictions and RAT/RFSP control as defined in
3GPP TS 29.507 [10] and UE Policy decisions for the control of Access network
discovery and selection policy and UE Route Selection Policy (URSP) as defined
in 3GPP TS 29.525 [11].
The policy control decision and flow based charging control functionalities
enable the PCF to provide network control regarding the service data flow
detection, gating, QoS and flow based charging (except credit management)
towards the SMF/UPF. The PCF offers these capabilities to the NF service
consumers (e.g. the AF and NEF) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [12] and 3GPP TS
29.214 [13].
The Policy Event Exposure Service enables the PCF to report policy control
events observed in one or more PCF services to NF service consumers.
#### 4.1.3.2 NF Service Consumers
As indicated in subclause 4.1.2 above, the only known NF service consumer of
the Npcf_EventExposure service is the Network Exposure Function (NEF).
The Network Exposure Function (NEF) is a functional element that supports the
following functionalities:
\- The NEF securely exposes network capabilities and events provided by 3GPP
NFs to AF.
\- The NEF provides a means for the AF to securely provide information to 3GPP
network and can authenticate, authorize and assist in throttling the AF.
\- The NEF translates the information received from the AF to the one sent to
internal 3GPP NFs, and vice versa.
> \- The NEF supports exposing information (collected from other 3GPP NFs) to
> the AF.

### 4.2.2 Npcf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation
#### 4.2.2.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to subscribe for
policy events notifications on a specified context for a group of UE(s) or any
UE, or to modify an existing subscription.
The following are the types of events for which a subscription can be made:
\- PLMN identifier notification; and
\- Change of Access Type.
The following procedures using the Npcf_EventExposure_Subscribe service
operation are supported:
\- creating a new subscription;
\- modifying an existing subscription.
#### 4.2.2.2 Creating a new subscription
Figure 4.2.2.2-1 illustrates the creation of a subscription.
Figure 4.2.2.2-1: Creation of a subscription
To subscribe to event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an
HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/npcf-eventexposure/v1/subscriptions/\" as
request URI as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 1, and the
\"PcEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as request body.
The \"PcEventExposureSubsc\" data structure shall include:
\- identification of the policy events to subscribe as \"eventSubs\"
attribute;
\- indication of the UEs to which the subscription applies via:
a) identification of a group of UE(s) via a \"groupId\" attribute; or
b) identification of any UE by ommitting the \"groupId\" attribute.
\- a URI where to receive the requested notifications as \"notifUri\"
attribute; and
\- a Notification Correlation Identifier assigned by the NF service consumer
for the requested notifications as \"notifId\" attribute.
The \"PcEventExposureSubsc\" data structure also may include:
\- description of the event reporting information as \"eventsRepInfo\", which
may include:
a) event notification method (periodic, one time, on event detection) as
\"notifMethod\" attribute;
b) Maximum Number of Reports as \"maxReportNbr\" attribute;
c) Monitoring Duration as \"monDur\" attribute;
d) repetition period for periodic reporting as \"repPeriod\" attribute;
e) immediate reporting indication as \"immRep\" attribute;
f) sampling ratio as \"sampRatio\" attribute; and/or
g) group reporting guard time as \"grpRepTime\" attribute.
\- if the supported feature \"ExtendedSessionInformation\" is supported, to
filter the AF sessions for which the policy event report shall occur, the
identification of the services one or more AF sessions may belong to as
\"filterServices\" attribute, which may include per service identification:
a) a list of ethernet flows in the \"servEthFlows\" attribute; or
b) a list of IP flows in the \"servIpFlows\" attribute; and/or
c) an AF application identifier in the \"afAppId\" attribute.
\- to filter the DNNs for which the policy event report shall occur, the
identification of the DNNs in the \"filterDnns\" attribute; and
\- to filter the S-NSSAIs for which the policy event report shall occur, the
identification of the S-NSSAIs in the \"filterSnssais\" attribute.
If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to an
internal PCF error or an error in the HTTP POST request, the PCF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in subclause 5.7.
Upon successful reception of the HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/npcf-
eventexposure/v1/subscriptions/\" as request URI and \"PcEventExposureSubsc\"
data structure as request body, the PCF shall create a new \"Individual Policy
Events Subscription\" resource, store the subscription and send a HTTP \"201
Created\" response as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 2. The PCF shall include
in the \"201 Created\" response:
\- a Location header field; and
\- an \"PcEventExposureSubsc\" data type in the payload body.
The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created individual
application session context resource i.e. \"{apiRoot}/npcf-
eventexposure/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\".
The \"PcEventExposureSubsc\" data type payload body shall contain the
representation of the created \"Individual Policy Events Subscription\".
When the \"monDur\" attribute is included in the response, it represents a
server selected expiry time that is equal or less than a possible expiry time
in the request.
When the \"immRep\" attribute is included in the subscription and the
subscribed policy control events are available, the PCF shall immediately
notify the NF service consumer using the Npcf_EventExposure_Notify service
operation, as described in subclause 4.2.4.2.
When the sampling ratio as the \"sampRatio\" attribute is included in the
subscription, the PCF shall select a random subset of UEs among the target UEs
according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the
selected subset of UEs.
When the group reporting guard time as the \"grpRepTime\" attribute is
included in the subscription, the PCF shall accumulate all the event reports
for the target UEs until the group reporting guard time expires. Then the PCF
shall notify the NF service consumer using the Npcf_EventExposure_Notify
service operation, as described in subclause 4.2.4.2.
#### 4.2.2.3 Modifying an existing subscription
Figure 4.2.2.3-1 illustrates the modification of an existing subscription.
Figure 4.2.2.3-1: Modification of an existing subscription
To modify an existing subscription to event notifications, the NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/npcf-
eventexposure/v1/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request URI, as shown
in figure 4.2.2.3-1, step 1, where \"{**subscriptionId**}\" is the
subscription correlation ID of the existing subscription. The
\"PcEventExposureSubsc\" data structure is included as request body as
described in subclause 4.2.2.2.
NOTE 1: An alternate NF service consumer than the one that requested the
generation of the subscription resource can send the PUT.
NOTE 2: The \"notifUri\" attribute within the PcEventExposureSubsc data
structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent to
a new NF service consumer.
If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP PUT request due to an
internal PCF error or an error in the HTTP PUT request, the PCF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in subclause 5.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the PCF determines the received
HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the PCF shall send an HTTP redirect
response as specified in subclause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
Upon successful reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/npcf-
eventexposure/v1/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request URI and
\"PcEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as request body, the PCF shall store
the subscription and send an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the
\"PcEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as response body, as shown in figure
4.2.2.3-1, step 2.
The \"PcEventExposureSubsc\" data structure payload body shall contain the
representation of the modified \"Individual Policy Events Subscription\".
When the \"monDur\" attribute is included in the response, it represents a NF
service producer selected expiry time that is equal or less than a possible
expiry time received in the request.
When the \"immRep\" attribute is included in the updated subscription and the
subscribed policy control events are available, the PCF shall immediately
notify the NF service consumer using the Npcf_EventExposure_Notify service
operation, as described in subclause 4.2.4.2.
When the sampling ratio as the \"sampRatio\" attribute is included in the
subscription, the PCF shall select a random subset of UEs among the target UEs
according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the
selected subset of UEs.
When the group reporting guard time as the \"grpRepTime\" attribute is
included in the subscription, the PCF shall accumulate all the event reports
for the target UEs until the group reporting guard time expires. Then the PCF
shall notify the NF service consumer using the Npcf_EventExposure_Notify
service operation, as described in subclause 4.2.4.2.
### 4.2.3 Npcf_EventExposure_UnSubscribe service operation
#### 4.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to unsubscribe from
event notifications.
The following procedure using the Npcf_EventExposure_UnSubscribe service
operation is supported:

#### 4.2.3.2 Unsubscription from event notifications
Figure 4.2.3.2-1 illustrates the unsubscription from event notifications.
Figure 4.2.3.2-1: Unsubscription from event notifications
To unsubscribe from event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an
HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/npcf-
eventexposure/v1/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request URI, as shown
in figure 4.2.3.2-1, step 1, where \"{**subscriptionId**}\" is the
subscription correlation identifier of the existing resource subscription that
is to be deleted.
If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP DELETE request due to
an internal PCF error or due to an error in the HTTP DELETE request, the PCF
shall send the HTTP error response as specified in subclause 5.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the PCF determines the received
HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the PCF shall send an HTTP
redirect response as specified in subclause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
Upon successful reception of the HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/npcf-
eventexposure/v1/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request URI, the PCF
shall remove the corresponding subscription and send an HTTP \"204 No
Content\" response as shown in figure 4.2.3.2-1, step 2.
### 4.2.4 Npcf_EventExposure_Notify service operation
#### 4.2.4.1 General
The Npcf_EventExposure_Notify service operation enables the PCF to notify the
NF service consumers that the previously subscribed policy control event
occurred.

## 5.7 Error handling
### 5.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in subclause 5.2.4 of 3GPP
TS 29.500 [5].
For the Npcf_EventExposure API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in subclause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [6].
Protocol errors and application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [5] shall be supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP
status codes are specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table
5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
In addition, the requirements in the following subclauses are applicable for
the Npcf_ EventExposure API.
### 5.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no service specific protocol
errors applicable for the Npcf_EventExposure API.
### 5.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Npcf_EventExposure service are listed
in table 5.7.3-1.
Table 5.7.3-1: Application errors
* * *
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
## 5.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.8-1 are defined for the Npcf_EventExposure
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
subclause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
Table 5.8-1: Supported Features
* * *
Feature number Feature Name Description 1 ExtendedSessionInformation Indicates
the support of additional session information in the subscription and report
of policy control event. 2 MacAddressRange Indicates the support of a set of
MAC addresses with a specific range in the traffic filter. 3 ATSSS Indicates
the support of the report of the multiple access types of a MA PDU session. 4
ES3XX Extended Support for 3xx redirections. This feature indicates the
support of redirection for any service operation, according to Stateless NF
procedures as specified in subclauses 6.5.3.2 and 6.5.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[5] and according to HTTP redirection principles for indirect communication,
as specified in subclause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
* * *
## 5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [19] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [5], the access to the
Npcf_EventExposure API, based on local configuration, may be authorized by
means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [20]), using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [21])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Nnrf_NFManagement API, shall obtain a \"token\" from
the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [21], subclause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF where the NF Service Consumer invoked the
discovery of the Npcf_EventExposure service.
The Npcf_EventExposure API defines a single scope \"npcf-eventexposure\" for
the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource
or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [7] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Npcf_EventExposure API.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API.
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification file contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[22] and subclause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [6] for further information).
