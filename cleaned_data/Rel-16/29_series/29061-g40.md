# Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The present document describes the network interworking for the Packet Domain.
Interworking to various external networks is defined together with the
interworking for data forwarding while subscribers roam within the 3GPP
system.
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
Y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the requirements for Packet Domain interworking
between a:
a) PLMN and PDN;
b) PLMN and PLMN.
The present document is valid for a PLMN in A/Gb mode as well as for a PLMN in
Iu mode. If text applies only for one of these systems it is explicitly
mentioned by using the terms \"A/Gb mode\" and \"Iu mode\". Please note, that
the A interface does not play any role in the scope of the present document
although the term \"A/Gb mode\" is used.
For inter-working between EPC PLMN and external networks, the present document
is valid for both 3GPP accesses and non-3GPP accesses.
The present document also defines, in clause 17, the protocol for the Gmb
interface, in clause 20, the protocol for the SGmb interface, and in clause
19, the protocol for the Mz interface.
The present document also defines, in clause 18, the usage of Radius at the Pk
Reference Point between the GGSN and the Presence Network Agent.
The term \"Packet Domain\" includes both EPC based and non-EPC based Packet
Domains.
The present document also defines the specific requirements for rate control
related to CIoT optimisations.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 22.060 [2], 3GPP TS 23.060 [3], 3GPP TS 23.401 [77], 3GPP TS 23.402
[78] and the following apply:
**2G- / 3G-:** prefixes 2Gâ€‘ and 3Gâ€‘ refers to functionality that supports only
A/Gb mode GPRS or Iu mode, respectively, e.g., 2Gâ€‘SGSN refers only to the A/Gb
mode GPRS functionality of an SGSN. When the prefix is omitted, reference is
made independently from the A/Gb mode GPRS or Iu mode functionality.
**A/Gb mode:** indicates that the text applies only to a system or sub-system
which operate in A/Gb mode of operation, i.e. with a functional division that
is in accordance with the use of an A or a Gb interface between the radio
access network and the core network.
**Iu mode:** indicates that the text applies only to a system or a sub-system
which operates in Iu mode of operation, i.e. with a functional division that
is in accordance with the use of an Iu-CS or Iu-PS interface between the radio
access network and the core network.
**IP-CAN session:** association between a UE and an IP network\ The
association is identified by a UE represented by an Ipv4 address and/or an
Ipv6 prefix together with a UE identity information, if available, and a PDN
identity (e.g. APN). An IP-CAN session incorporates one or more IP-CAN
bearers. Support for multiple IP-CAN bearers per IP-CAN session is IP-CAN
specific. An IP-CAN session exists as long as the related UE Ipv4 address
and/or Ipv6 prefix are established and announced to the IP network.
**EPC based Packet Domain:** Packet domain which makes use of EPC nodes (e.g.
P-GW, S-GW, etc.).
**Packet Domain Bearer:** A transmission path between a UE and a GGSN/P-GW,
terminating at the User Plane protocol stack under the IP layers.

# 4 Network characteristics
## 4.1 Key characteristics of PLMN
The PLMN is fully defined in the 3GPP technical specifications. The Packet
Domain related key characteristics are found in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3] , 3GPP TS
23.401 [77] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [78].
## 4.2 Key characteristics of PSDN
Void.
## 4.3 Key characteristics of IP Networks
The Internet is a conglomeration of networks utilising a common set of
protocols. IP protocols are defined in the relevant IETF STD specifications
and RFCs. The networks topologies may be based on LANs (e.g. 16orrecti), Point
to Point leased lines, PSTN, ISDN, X.25 or WANs using switched technology
(e.g. SMDS, ATM).
# 5 Interworking Classifications
## 5.1 Service Interworking
Service interworking is required when the Teleservice at the calling and
called terminals are different. For Packet Domain, service interworking is not
applicable at the Gi/Sgi reference point.
## 5.2 Network Interworking
Network interworking is required whenever a PLMN is involved in communications
with another network to provide end-to-end communications. The PLMN shall
interconnect in a manner consistent with that of a normal Packet Data Network
(type defined by the requirements e.g. IP). Interworking appears exactly like
that of Packet Data Networks.
## 5.3 Numbering and Addressing
See 3GPP TS 23.003 [40] and the relevant section for IP addressing below.
# 6 Access reference configuration
## 6.1 General
The figures depicted in subclauses 6.2 and 6.3 below are the logical
representation of the EPC and the non-EPC based Packet Domains. Physically, an
operator's PLMN may consist of both EPC and non-EPC nodes. In other words, for
example, an operator's PLMN may have both GGSNs and P-GWs; and a Rel-8 SGSN
may initiate PDP context activation procedure via both Gn/Gp and S4/S5/S8
reference points.
## 6.2 Access Interfaces and Reference Points for non-EPC based Packet Domain
Figure 1a shows the relationship between the MS, its terminal equipment and
the PLMN network in the non-EPC based overall Packet Domain environment.
Figure 1a: Non-EPC based Packet Domain Access Interfaces and Reference Points
## 6.3 Access Interfaces and Reference Points for EPC based Packet Domain
Figure 1b shows the relationship between the UE and the EPS network for both
the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access in the EPC based Packet Domain
environment. The S8/S2a/S2b interface includes GTP-based and PMIP-based.
Figure 1b: EPC based Packet Domain Access Interfaces and Reference Points
# 7 Interface to Packet Domain Bearer Services
## 7.1 A/Gb mode
Figure 2a shows the relationship of the non-EPC based Packet Domain Bearer in
A/Gb mode terminating at the SNDCP layer to the rest of the A/Gb mode Packet
Domain environment. It is shown for reference purposes only and detailed
information can be found in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3].

## 7.2 Iu mode
Figure 2b shows the relationship of the non-EPC based Packet Domain Bearer in
Iu mode, terminating at the PDCP layer, to the rest of the Iu mode Packet
Domain environment. It is shown for reference purposes only and detailed
information can be found in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3].
Figure 2b: User Plane for Packet Domain services in Iu mode
## 7.3 Interface to EPC-based Packet Domain Bearer Services
The user plane for EPC based packet domain services can be found in 3GPP TS
23.401 [77] , 3GPP TS 23.402 [78] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [3].
# 8 Subscription checking
The subscription of an MS/UE is checked by the PLMN during IP-CAN session
establishment procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3], 3GPP TS 23.401
[77] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [78]. The GGSN/P-GW implicitly checks its internal
context related to the destination address for each mobile terminated packet.
For PDN types other than Non-IP, if there is a context IP-CAN session
associated with the IP address the packet shall be forwarded towards the
MS/UE; otherwise the packet shall be discarded or rejected depending on the
implemented protocol. For PDN type \"Non-IP\", the packet shall be forwarded
towards the MS/UE, discarded or rejected depending on the implemented
protocol.
# 8A Prevention of IP spoofing
For PDN types other than \"Non-IP\", if IP spoofing has to be prevented, the
GGSN/P-GW shall verify the source IP address of the IP packets issued by the
UE and compare it against the address, IPv4 or IPv6, assigned for the IP-CAN
session. If the verification fails for a packet,the GGSN/P-GW shall discard
the packets and shall be capable to log the event in the security log against
the subscriber information (IMSI/MSISDN).
# 9 Message Screening
Screening functions reside within the Packet Domain as described in 3GPP TS
22.060 [2], 3GPP TS 23.060 [3], 3GPP TS 23.401 [77] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [78].
Screening may be applicable for only certain protocols. Screening is outside
the scope of the present document.

# 11 Interworking with PDN (IP)
## 11.1 General
Packet Domain shall support interworking with networks based on the Internet
Protocol (IP). These interworked networks may be either intranets or the
Internet. Packet Domain may also support interworking with networks handling
Non-IP data services.
## 11.2 PDN Interworking Model
The Packet Domain can interwork with IP networks and networks handling Non-IP
data services. When interworking with the IP networks, the Packet Domain can
operate IPv4 and/or IPv6. The interworking point with the IP networks or
networks handling Non-IP data services is at the Gi and Sgi reference point.
Additionally, the interworking point with network handling Non-IP data
services may also be the T6a (T6) reference point for Control Plane CIoT EPS
Optimizations (see 3GPP TS 29.128 [110]) . These interworking points are shown
in figure 7.
Figure 7: IP network interworking
The GGSN/P-GW for interworking with the IP network is the access point of the
Packet Domain (see figure 8). In this case the Packet Domain network will look
like any other IP network or subnetwork.
Figure 8: The protocol stacks of GGSN and P-GW for the IP network interworking
Typically in the IP networks, the interworking with subnetworks is done via IP
routers. The Gi reference point is between the GGSN and the external IP
network; and the Sgi reference point is between the P-GW and the external IP
network. From the external IP network's point of view, the GGSN/P-GW is seen
as a normal IP router. The L2 and L1 layers are operator specific.
It is out of the scope of the present document to standardise the router
functions and the used protocols in the Gi/Sgi reference point.
Interworking with user defined ISPs and private/public IP networks is subject
to interconnect agreements between the network operators.
No user data or header compression is done in the GGSN/P-GW.
Both the GGSN/P-GW (for both Control Plane and User Plane CIoT EPS
Optimizations) and the SCEF (for Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimization) for
interworking with the network handling Non-IP data services are the access
points of the Packet Domain. See 3GPP TS 23.401 [77] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [3]
for further details.
### 11.2.1 Access to Internet, Intranet or ISP through Packet Domain
The access to Internet, Intranet or ISP may involve specific functions such as
user authentication, user's authorization, end to end encryption between MS
and Intranet/ISP, allocation of a dynamic address belonging to the
PLMN/Intranet/ISP addressing space, Ipv6 address autoconfiguration, etc.
For this purpose the Packet Domain may offer:
\- either direct transparent access to the Internet; or
\- a non transparent access to the Intranet/ISP. In this case the Packet
Domain, i.e. the GGSN/P-GW, takes part in the functions listed above.
The mechanisms for host configuration and user authentication described in
this subclause and its subclauses are applicable for the initial IP-CAN
session establishment to allocate IP addresses (Ipv4 and/or Ipv6) to the MS.
For GTP based access, the activation of any subsequent IP-CAN bearers for that
IP-CAN session, (i.e.secondary PDP context activation Procedure', dedicated
bearer activation), as well as the use of TFTs, is described in 3GPP TS 23.060
[3], 3GPP TS 23.401 [77].
#### 11.2.1.1 Transparent access to the Internet
Figure 9: Example of the PDN Interworking Model, transparent case
In figure 9, an example PDN interworking model for transparent access to the
Internet is provided for a GGSN and its Gi reference point.
In transparent access to the Internet case:
\- the MS is given an Ipv4 address and/or an Ipv6 prefix belonging to the
operator addressing space. The Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix is assigned
either at subscription in which case it is a static address or at IP-CAN
session establishment in which case it is a dynamic address. This Ipv4 address
and/or Ipv6 prefix if applicable is used for packet forwarding between the
Internet and the GGSN/P-GW and within the packet domain. With Ipv6, Stateless
Address Autoconfiguration shall be used to assign an Ipv6 address to the MS.
These procedures are as described in the Ipv6 non-transparent access case
except that the addresses belong to the operator addressing space.
\- the MS need not send any authentication request at IP-CAN session
establishment procedure and the GGSN/P-GW need not take any part in the user
authentication/authorization process.
The transparent case provides at least a basic ISP service. As a consequence
of this it may therefore provide a bearer service for a tunnel to a private
Intranet.
Note that the remainder of this subclause deals with this specific use-case as
depicted in figure 10.
\- The user level configuration may be carried out between the TE and the
intranet, the Packet Domain network is transparent to this procedure.
The used protocol stack is depicted in figure 10.
Figure 10: Transparent access to an Intranet
In figure 10, an example for transparent access to an Intranet is provided for
a GGSN and its Gi reference point, but the same principle is applicable to
EPC.
The communication between the PLMN and the Intranet may be performed over any
network, even an insecure network e.g. the Internet. There is no specific
security protocol between the GGSN and the Intranet because security is
ensured on an end to end basis between the MS and the intranet by the
\"Intranet Protocol\".
User authentication and encryption of user data are done within the \"Intranet
Protocol\" if either of them is needed. This \"Intranet Protocol\" may also
carry private (IP) addresses belonging to the address space of the Intranet.
An example of an \"Intranet Protocol\" is Ipsec (see RFC 1825 [61]). If Ipsec
is used for this purpose then Ipsec authentication header or security header
may be used for user (data) authentication and for the confidentiality of user
data (see RFC 1826 [62] and RFC 1827 [63]). In this case private IP tunnelling
within public IP takes place.
#### 11.2.1.2 Ipv4 Non Transparent access to an Intranet or ISP
##### 11.2.1.2.1 non-EPC based Ipv4 Non Transparent access
In this case:
\- the MS is given an address belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing space.
The address is given either at subscription in which case it is a static
address or at PDP context activation in which case it is a dynamic address.
This address is used for packet forwarding within the GGSN and for packet
forwarding on the Intranet/ISP. This requires a link between the GGSN and an
address allocation server, like AAA, DHCP, ..., belonging to the Intranet/ISP;
\- the MS shall send an authentication request at PDP context activation and
the GGSN requests user authentication from a server, like AAA, DHCP, ...,
belonging to the Intranet/ISP;
\- the protocol configuration options are retrieved (if requested by the MS at
PDP context activation) from some server (AAA or DHCP, ...) belonging to the
Intranet/ISP;
\- the communication between the Packet Domain and the Intranet/ISP may be
performed over any network, even an insecure e.g. the Internet. In case of an
insecure connection between the GGSN and the Intranet/ISP there may be a
specific security protocol in between. This security protocol is defined by
mutual agreement between PLMN operator and Intranet/ISP administrator.
Figure 11a: Signalling plane of non transparent case
NOTE: The transport protocol UDP is used for DHCP and RADIUS, and TCP or SCTP
are used for Diameter.
The following description bullet items describe the signal flow.
1) The TE sends an AT-command to the MT to set up parameters and enter PPP
mode. The MT responds with an AT-response.
2) LCP negotiates Maximum-Receive-Unit and authentication protocol. The
negotiated authentication protocol is, either CHAP, PAP or 'none'. The MT
shall try to negotiate for CHAP as first priority.
3) If the negotiated authentication protocol is either of CHAP or PAP, the TE
authenticates itself towards the MT by means of that protocol. The MT stores
the necessary authentication data and sends a forced positive acknowledgement
of the authentication to the TE.
4) The TE requests IP configuration by sending the IPCP Configure-Request
message to the MT indicating either the static IP address that shall be used
or that an IP-address shall be dynamically allocated.
5) The MT sends the Activate PDP context request message to the SGSN,
including the Protocol Configuration Options. The SGSN sends the Create PDP
context req message to the chosen GGSN including the unmodified Protocol
Configuration Options.
6) The GGSN deduces from the APN:
\- the server(s) to be used for address allocation, authentication and
protocol configuration options retrieval;
\- the protocol like RADIUS, DHCP, ... to be used with this / those server(s);
\- the communication and security feature needed to dialogue with this / those
server(s) e.g. tunnel, IPSec security association, dial-up connection (using
possibly PPP), ...
As an example the GGSN may use one of the following options:
\- RADIUS for authentication and IP-address allocation. The AAA server
responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client
in the GGSN;
\- RADIUS for authentication and DHCP for host configuration and address
allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-
Reject to the RADIUS client in the GGSN. After a successful authentication,
the DHCP client discovers the DHCP server(s) in the ISP/Intranet and receives
host configuration data.
\- If the received Protocol Configurations Options IE contains a PPP IPCP
Configure-Request packet, the GGSN shall analyse all the contained IPCP
options and their requested values. In accordance with the relevant PPP RFC
1661 [21a] and RFC 1662 [21b] the GGSN shall respond with the following
messages:
\- zero or one PPP IPCP Configure-Reject packet containing options not
supported and options which values cannot be returned;
\- zero or one PPP IPCP Configure-Nak packet containing options that are
supported but has requested values that are incorrect/unsupported; and
\- zero or one PPP IPCP Configure-Ack packet containing options that are
supported and has requested values that are correct/supported.
Any returned PPP IPCP packets shall be contained in the Protocol
Configurations Options IE.
7) The GGSN sends back to the SGSN a Create PDP Context Response message,
containing the Protocol Configuration Options IE. The cause value shall be set
according to the outcome of the host --authentication and --configuration. A
PDP context activation shall not be rejected solely due to the presence of
unsupported or incorrect PPP IPCP options or option values, received from the
MS in the Protocol Configurations Options IE. The MS may however later decide
to immediately deactivate the activated PDP context due to the information
received in the Protocol Configurations Options IE received from the network.
8) Depending on the cause value received in the Create PDP Context Response
the SGSN sends either an Activate PDP Context Accept or an Activate PDP
Context Reject, to the MS.
If Protocol Configuration Options are received from the GGSN, the SGSN shall
relay those to the MS. The MT sends either the configuration-ack packet (e.g.
IPCP Configure Ack in PPP case), the configure-nack packet in case of dynamic
address allocation (e.g. IPCP Configure Nack in PPP case), or a link Terminate
request (LCP Terminate-Request in PPP case) back to the TE. In the case where
a configure-nack packet was sent by the MT, a local negotiation may take place
at the R reference point (i.e. the TE proposes the new value to the MT), after
which a configuration-ack packet is sent to the TE.
9) In case a configuration-ack packet was sent to the TE, the link from the TE
to the external ISP/Intranet is established and IP packets may be exchanged.
In case a link terminate request packet was sent to the TE, the TE and MT
negotiates for link termination. The MT may then send a final AT-response to
inform the TE about the rejected PDP Context activation.
A link terminate request packet (such as LCP Terminate-request in PPP case)
causes a PDP context deactivation.
EXAMPLE: In the following example PPP is used as layer 2 protocol over the R
reference point.
The MT acts as a PPP server and translates Protocol Configuration Options into
SM message Ies. GTP-C carries this information unchanged to the GGSN which
uses the information e.g. for DHCP or RADIUS authentication and host
configuration. The result of the host authentication and configuration is
carried via GTP-C to the SGSN which relays the information to the MT. The MT
sends an IPCP Configure-Ack to the TE with the appropriate options included.

##### 11.2.1.2.2 EPC based Ipv4 Non Transparent access
In this case:
\- a static or a dynamic Ipv4 address belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing
space is allocated to a UE at IP-CAN session establishment. The methods of
allocating IP address to the UE are specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3], 3GPP TS
23.401 [77] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [78]. The allocated Ipv4 address is used for
packet forwarding within the P-GW and for packet forwarding on the
Intranet/ISP;
\- as a part of the IP-CAN session establishment, the P-GW may request user
authentication from an external AAA server (i.e. RADIUS, Diameter) belonging
to the Intranet/ISP;
\- the Ipv4 address allocation to the UE may be performed based on the
subscription or a local address pool, which belongs to the Intranet/ISP
addressing space, provisioned in the P-GW. The Ipv4 address allocation to the
UE may also be done via the address allocation servers (i.e. DHCPv4, RADIUS
AAA, Diameter AAA) belonging to the Intranet/ISP;
\- if requested by the UE at IP-CAN session establishment, the P-GW may
retrieve the Protocol Configuration Options or Ipv4 configuration parameters
from a locally provisioned database in P-GW and/or from some external server
(i.e. DHCPv4, RADIUS AAA, Diameter AAA) belonging to the Intranet/ISP;
\- the communication between the Packet Domain and the Intranet/ISP may be
performed over any network, even an insecure network ,e.g. the Internet. In
case of an insecure connection between the P-GW and the Intranet/ISP, there
may be a specific security protocol in between. This security protocol is
defined by mutual agreement between PLMN operator and Intranet/ISP
administrator.
Table 0 summarizes the Ipv4 address allocation and parameter configuration use
cases between the UE and the P-GW that may lead the P-GW to interwork with the
external DHCPv4, RADIUS AAA and Diameter AAA servers over Sgi reference point.
For detailed description of the signalling flows between the UE and the P-GW,
see the references in the table. The detailed description of the signalling
use cases that may be triggered between the P-GW and the external servers are
specified in this document, as referenced in the table.

#### 11.2.1.3 Ipv6 Non Transparent access to an Intranet or ISP
When using Ipv6 Address Autoconfiguration, the process of setting up the
access to an Intranet or ISP involves two signalling phases. The first
signalling phase is done in the control plane and consists of the PDP context
activation or initial attach (e.g. create default bearer) for EPC based
access, followed by a second signalling phase done in the user plane.
The user plane signalling phase shall be stateless. The stateless procedure,
which involves only the MS/UE and the GGSN/P-GW, is described in subclause
\"Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\".
For APNs that are configured for Ipv6 address allocation, the GGSN/P-GW shall
only use the Prefix part of the Ipv6 address for forwarding of mobile
terminated IP packets. The size of the prefix shall be according to the
maximum prefix length for a global Ipv6 address as specified in the Ipv6
Addressing Architecture, see RFC 4291 [82].
The GGSN/P-GW indicates to the MS/UE that Stateless Autoconfiguration shall be
performed by sending Router Advertisements as described in the corresponding
subclause below and according to the principles defined in RFC 4861 [89] and
RFC 4862 [83].
For MS/UE having Ipv6, Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is mandatory.
##### 11.2.1.3.1 Ipv6 PDP Context Activation
In this case:
\- The GGSN provides the MS with an Ipv6 Prefix belonging to the Intranet/ISP
addressing space. A dynamic Ipv6 address shall be given using stateless
address autoconfiguration. This Ipv6 address is used for packet forwarding
within the packet domain and for packet forwarding on the Intranet/ISP;
\- the MS may send an authentication request at PDP context activation and the
GGSN may request user authentication from a server, e.g. AAA, ..., belonging
to the Intranet/ISP;
\- the protocol configuration options are retrieved (if requested by the MS at
PDP context activation) from some server, e.g. AAA, ..., belonging to the
Intranet/ISP;
\- in order to avoid any conflict between the link-local address of the MS and
that of the GGSN, the Interface-Identifier used by the MS to build its link-
local address shall be assigned by the GGSN. The GGSN ensures the uniqueness
of this interface-identifier. The MT shall then enforce the use of this
Interface-Identifier by the TE.
\- the communication between the Packet Domain and the Intranet/ISP may be
performed over any network, even an insecure e.g. the Internet. In case of an
insecure connection between the GGSN and the Intranet/ISP there may be a
specific security protocol over the insecure connection. This security
protocol is defined by mutual agreement between PLMN operator and Intranet/ISP
administrator.
\- the MS may request for DNS server Ipv6 addresses using the PCO IE in e.g.
the PDP Context Request message. In that case the GGSN may return the IP
address of one or more DNS servers in the PCO in the PDP Context Response
message. The DNS address(es) shall be coded in the PCO as specified in 3GPP TS
24.008 [54]. If a list of servers is received, the MS shall adhere to the
explicit prioritisation order of the list.
In the following signalling flow example, PPP is used as layer 2 protocol over
the R reference point. The MT behaves as a PPP server and translates Protocol
Configuration Options into SM message Ies. GTP-C carries this information
unchanged to the GGSN which uses the information e.g. for RADIUS
authentication. The result of the host authentication is carried via GTP-C
back to the SGSN, which then relays the result to the MT. The MT finalises the
IPV6CP negotiation by sending an IPV6CP Configure-Ack message to the TE with
the appropriate options included, e.g. Interface-Identifier. The Interface-
Identifier shall be used in the TE to create a link-local address to be able
to perform the Ipv6 address autoconfiguration (see subclauses 11.2.1.3.2 and
11.2.1.3.3).
1) The TE sends an AT-command to the MT to set up parameters and enter PPP
mode. The MT responds with an AT-response.
2) LCP negotiates Maximum-Receive-Unit and authentication protocol. The
negotiated authentication protocol is either CHAP, PAP or 'none'. The MT shall
try to negotiate for CHAP as first priority.
3) If the negotiated authentication protocol is either of CHAP or PAP, the TE
authenticates itself towards the MT by means of that protocol. The MT stores
the necessary authentication data and sends a forced positive acknowledgement
of the authentication to the TE.
4) The TE requests Ipv6 Interface-Identifier negotiation by sending the IPV6CP
Configure-Request message to the MT.
5) The MT sends the Activate PDP Context Request message to the SGSN,
including the Protocol Configuration Options. The Protocol Configuration
Options IE may contain negotiated LCP options such as negotiated
Authentication Protocol as well as any authentication data previously stored
in the MT. It may also contain a request for dynamic configuration of DNS
server Ipv6 addresses. The MS shall for dynamic address allocation leave PDP
Address empty and set PDP Type to Ipv6 or Ipv4v6. The SGSN sends the Create
PDP context request message to the chosen GGSN including the unmodified
Protocol Configuration Options.
6) The GGSN deduces from local configuration data associated with the APN:
\- the source of Ipv6 Prefixes (GGSN internal prefix pool, or external address
allocation server);
\- any server(s) to be used for address allocation, authentication and/or
protocol configuration options retrieval (e.g. IMS related configuration, see
3GPP TS 24.229 [47]);
\- the protocol e.g. RADIUS, to be used with the server(s);
\- the communication and security feature needed to communicate with the
server(s);
As an example the GGSN may use one of the following options:
\- GGSN internal Prefix pool for Ipv6 prefix allocation and no authentication;
\- GGSN internal Prefix pool for Ipv6 prefix allocation and RADIUS for
authentication. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an
Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the GGSN;
\- RADIUS for authentication and Ipv6 prefix allocation. The AAA server
responds with either an Accessâ€‘Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client
in the GGSN;
NOTE: DHCPv6 may be used for Ipv6 prefix allocation.
Ipv6 Prefixes in a GGSN internal Prefix pool shall be configurable and
structured per APN.
The GGSN shall in the PDP Address IE in the Create PDP Context Response return
an Ipv6 address composed of a Prefix and an Interface-Identifier. The
Interface-Identifier may have any value and it does not need to be unique
within or across APNs. It shall however not conflict with the Interface-
Identifier the GGSN has selected for its own side of the MS-GGSN link. The
Prefix assigned by the GGSN or the external AAA server shall be globally or
site-local unique.
The GGSN shall analyse the requested values of all the protocol options
contained in the received Protocol Configurations Options IE. The contents of
the Protocol Configurations Options IE sent in the GGSN response shall be in
accordance with the relevant standards e.g. the PPP standard RFC 1661 [21a]
and RFC 1662 [21b].
7) The GGSN sends back to the SGSN a Create PDP Context Response message,
containing the PDP Address IE and the Protocol Configuration Options IE. The
Protocol Configuration Options IE may contain configuration data such as a
list of DNS server Ipv6 addresses. The cause value shall be set according to
the outcome of the host authentication and configuration.
8) Depending on the cause value received in the Create PDP Context Response,
the SGSN either stores the PDP Address and sends an Activate PDP Context
Accept to the MS or, sends an Activate PDP Context Reject, to the MS.
If Protocol Configuration Options are received from the GGSN, the SGSN shall
relay those to the MS.
9) The MT extracts the Interface-Identifier from the address received in the
PDP Address IE and ignores the Prefix part. If this Interface-Identifier is
identical to the tentative Interface-Identifier indicated in the IPV6CP
Configure-Request message sent from the TE, the MT sends an IPV6CP Configure
Ack packet, indicating this Interface-Identifier, to the TE.
If the Interface-Identifier extracted from the address contained in the PDP
Address IE is not identical to the tentative Interface-Identifier indicated in
the IPV6CP Configure-Request message sent from the TE, the MT sends an IPV6CP
Configure-Nak packet, indicating the Interface-Identifier extracted from the
address contained in the PDP Address IE, to the TE. The TE then sends a new
IPV6CP Configure-Request message to the MT, indicating the same Interface-
Identifier as was indicated in the received IPV6CP Configure Nak (as indicated
by the dotted IPV6CP Configure-Request and Configure-Ack in the figure below).
Finally the MT responds with a IPV6CP Configure Ack packet.
In case a PDP Context Reject was sent to the MS the MT sends an LCP Terminate-
Request to the TE.
10) When the TE has accepted the Interface-Identifier given by the MT, the
user plane link from the TE to the GGSN and the external ISP/Intranet is
established and the Ipv6 address autoconfiguration may proceed.
In case a link terminate request packet was sent to the TE, the TE and MT
negotiates for link termination. The MT may then send a final AT-response to
inform the TE about the rejected PDP Context activation.
An LCP Terminate-request causes a PDP context deactivation.
NOTE: DHCPv6 may be used for Ipv6 prefix allocation.
Figure 11ba: PDP Context Activation for the Ipv6 Non-transparent case
##### 11.2.1.3.1a Ipv6 EPC based Bearer Activation
In this case, the P-GW provides the UE with an Ipv6 Prefix belonging to the
Intranet/ISP addressing space. A dynamic Ipv6 address is given using stateless
address autoconfiguration. This Ipv6 address is used for packet forwarding
within the packet domain and for packet forwarding on the Intranet/ISP.
When a P-GW receives an initial access request (e.g. Create Session Request or
Proxy Binding Update) message, the P-GW deduces from local configuration data
associated with the APN:
\- The source of Ipv6 Prefixes (P-GW internal prefix pool, or external address
allocation server);
\- Any server(s) to be used for address allocation, authentication and/or
protocol configuration options retrieval (e.g. IMS related configuration, see
3GPP TS 24.229 [47]);
\- The protocol, i.e. RADIUS, Diameter or DHCPv6, to be used with the
server(s);
\- The communication and security feature needed to communicate with the
server(s);
As an example the P-GW may use one of the following options:
\- P-GW internal Prefix pool for Ipv6 prefixes allocation and no
authentication;
\- P-GW internal Prefix pool for Ipv6 prefixes allocation and RADIUS for
authentication. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an
Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the P-GW;
\- RADIUS for authentication and Ipv6 prefix allocation. The AAA server
responds with either an Accessâ€‘Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client
in the P-GW;
The P-GW includes the PDP Address IE in the the initial access response (e.g.
Create Session Response or Proxy Binding Acknowledgement) and return an Ipv6
address composed of a Prefix and an Interface-Identifier. The Interface-
Identifier may have any value and it does not need to be unique within or
across APNs. It shall however not conflict with the Interface-Identifier that
the P-GW has selected for its own side of the UE-P-GW link. The Prefix
assigned by the P-GW or the external AAA server shall be globally or site-
local unique (see the Note in subclause 11.3 of this document regarding the
usage of site-local addresses).
Table 0.a summarizes the Ipv6 prefix allocation and parameter configuration
use cases between the UE and the P-GW that may lead the P-GW to interwork with
the external RADIUS AAA, Diameter AAA and DHCPv6 servers over Sgi reference
point. For detailed description of the signalling flows between the UE and the
P-GW, see the references in the table. The detailed description of the
signalling use cases that may be triggered between the P-GW and the external
servers are specified in this document, as referenced in the table.

##### 11.2.1.3.2 Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
As described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3], the Ipv6 prefix of a PDP Context of PDP
type Ipv6 or Ipv4v6 activated by means of the Ipv6 Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration Procedure is uniquely identified by the prefix part of the
Ipv6 address only. The MS may select any value for the Interface-Identifier
part of the address. The only exception is the Interface-Identifier for the
link-local address used by the MS (see RFC 4291 [82]). This Interface-
Identifier shall be assigned by the GGSN to avoid any conflict between the
link-local address of the MS and that of the GGSN itself. This is described in
subclause \"Ipv6 PDP Context Activation\" above.
For Ipv6 the PDP Context Activation phase is followed by an address
autoconfiguration phase. The procedure describing APNs configured to use
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, may be as follows:
1) After the first phase of setting up Ipv6 access to an Intranet or ISP, the
MS shall use the Ipv6 Interface-Identifier, as provided by the GGSN, to create
its Ipv6 Link-Local Unicast Address according to RFC 4291 [82].
Before the MS can communicate with other hosts or Mses on the Intranet/ISP,
the MS must obtain an Ipv6 Global or Site-Local Unicast Address. The simplest
way is the Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration procedure described below
and in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3]. The procedure is consistent with RFC 4862 [83].
The procedure below takes place through signalling in the user plane. It is
done on the link between the MS and the GGSN. From the MS perspective the GGSN
is now the first router on the link.
2) After the GGSN has sent a Create PDP Context Response message to the SGSN,
it shall start sending Router Advertisements periodically on the new MS-GGSN
link established by the PDP Context. The MS may issue a Router Solicitation
directly after the user plane establishment. This shall trigger the GGSN to
send a Router Advertisement immediately.
To indicate to the MS that stateless address autoconfiguration shall be
performed, the GGSN shall leave the Mâ€‘flag cleared in the Router Advertisement
messages. The GGSN may set the O-flag if there are additional configuration
parameters that need to be fetched by the MS (see below).
The Prefix sent in the Router Advertisements shall be identical to the Prefix
returned in the Create PDP Context Response. The Prefix is contained in the
Prefix Information Option of the Router Advertisements and shall have the
A-flag set (\"Autonomous address configuration flag\") and the L-flag cleared
(i.e. the prefix should not be used for on-link determination). The lifetime
of the prefix shall be set to infinity. In practice, the lifetime of a Prefix
will be the lifetime of its PDP Context. There shall be exactly one Prefix
included in the Router Advertisements.
The handling of Router Advertisements shall be consistent with what is
specified in RFC 4861 [89]. For the MS-GGSN link however, some specific
handling shall apply. The randomisation part to determine when Router
Advertisements shall be sent may be omitted since the GGSN is the only router
on the link. Furthermore, some 3GPP specific protocol constants and default
values shall apply (see subclause \"Ipv6 Router Configuration Variables in the
GGSN\"). These relate to the periodicity of the Router Advertisements
initially and during continued operation. The motivation for this is to have a
faster user-plane set-up even in bad radio conditions and to minimize MS power
consumption during long continued operation.
3) When creating a Global or Site-Local Unicast Address, the MS may use the
Interface-Identifier received during the PDP Context Activation phase or it
may generate a new Interface-Identifier. There is no restriction on the value
of the Interface-Identifier of the Global or Site-Local Unicast Address, since
the Prefix is unique. Interface-Identifiers shall in any case be 64-bit long.
Since the GGSN guarantees that the Prefix is unique, the MS does not need to
perform any Duplicate Address Detection on addresses it creates. That is, the
'DupAddrDetectTransmits' variable in the MS should have a value of zero. If
the MS finds more than one Prefix in the Router Advertisement message, it
shall only consider the first one and silently discard the others. The GGSN
shall not generate any globally unique Ipv6 addresses for itself using the
Prefix assigned to the MS in the Router Advertisement.
If the O-flag (\"Other configuration flag\") was set in the Router
Advertisement, the MS may start a DHCP session to retrieve additional
configuration parameters. See subclause 13.2.2 \"Other configuration by the
Intranet or ISP\". If the MS is not DHCP capable, the O-flag may be ignored.
Figure 11bb: Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
##### 11.2.1.3.2a Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration for EPC
This subclause describes the signalling flows for the Ipv6 Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration procedures for EPC, in the case of using GTP-based
S5/S8/S2a, and PMIP-based S5/S8/S2a. The procedures are based on the
descriptions in TS 23.401 [77] and TS 23.402 [78]. Subclause 11.2.3.1a lists
the use cases between the UE to the P-GW that may trigger the P-GW to
interwork with the external PDNs for Ipv6 Prefix allocation.
Ipv6 prefix is delivered to UE in Router Advertisement message from the access
router, in the process of Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration.
In the procedure in the cases of using GTP-based S5/S8, P-GW acts as an access
router, and allocates to a UE a globally unique /64 Ipv6 prefix if the PLMN
allocates the prefix, or P-GW retrieves Ipv6 prefix from an external PDN if
one is allocated by the external PDN and advertises it to the UE. In the
latter procedure, P-GW uses RADIUS, Diameter or DHCPv6 protocol for the
retrieval of an Ipv6 prefix.
Following is the flow for Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration for EPC
using GTP-based S5/S8.
1\. UE initiates the Attach procedure, indicating 'Ipv6' or 'Ipv4v6' for PDN
type in PDP type information element.
2\. MME requests for Default Bearer creation by sending Create Session Request
to the S-GW.
2x. The S-GW sends Create Session Request to the P-GW.
3\. P-GW retrieves Ipv6 prefix using RADIUS, Diameter, or DHCPv6 mechanism.
This procedure is performed when an external PDN allocates an Ipv6 prefix.
4\. The P-GW sends Create Session Response. It includes the Ipv6 interface
identifier I Ipv6 prefix.
5\. S-GW sends Create Session Response message to the MME. It includes the
Ipv6 interface identifier I Ipv6 prefix.
5x. The MME sends Attach Accept message to the UE without the Ipv6 prefix. The
UE shall ignore the Ipv6 prefix if it receives one in the message.
6\. After receiving the Attach Accept message, the UE may send a Router
Solicitation to the P-GW to solicit a Router Advertisement message.
7\. The P-GW sends a Router Advertisement message to the UE, solicited or
unsolicited. It shall include an Ipv6 prefix in Prefix Information option
field of the message. The prefix is the same as the one in the Attach Accept
message, if it is provided during the default bearer establishment. For the
handling of M, O, L and A flags, and the lifetime of the prefix in the Router
Advertisement message, follow the description in subclause 11.2.1.3.2.
Figure 11bc: Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration for GTP-based S5/S8
If PMIP-based S5/S8 is used, S-GW acts as an access router. Therefore, it is
responsible for receiving Router Solicitation from and sending Router
Advertisement message to the UE. Other than this, procedure is the same as the
case of using GTP-based S5/S8; P-GW allocates, or retrieves an Ipv6 prefix
from the external PDN. The prefix is delivered from the P-GW to the S-GW in
the Ipv6 Home Network Prefix Option IE of a Proxy Binding Ackowledgement
message.
In addition, the S-GW shall initiate sending the Ipv6 Router Advertisement
message (either solicited or unsolicited) to the UE once the PDN connection
with PDN type Ipv4v6 or Ipv6 is setup after the procedure of E-UTRAN initial
Attach, UE requested PDN connectivity, intra-3GPP access handover with Serving
GW relocation, or handover from non-3GPP IP Access with S2a/S2b to 3GPP
Access.
Following diagram shows the case where PMIP-based S5/S8 is used.
Figure 11bd: Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration for PMIP-based S5/S8
For trusted non-3GPP accesses, the non-3GPP network supports prefix
advertisement for Ipv6 prefix received from the P-GW in PMIPv6 Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement. If the trusted non-3GPP access network is a WLAN network, for
GTP/PMIP --based S2a, TWAN acts as an access router. Therefore, TWAN is
responsible for receiving Router Solicitation from and sending Router
Advertisement message to the UE. Other than this, procedure is the same as the
case of using GTP/PMIP-based S5/S8; P-GW allocates, or retrieves an Ipv6
prefix from the external PDN. The prefix is delivered from the P-GW to the
TWAN in the Ipv6 Home Network Prefix Option IE of a Proxy Binding
Ackowledgement message or in the **PDN Address Allocation IE of Create Session
Response message**.
Following diagram shows the case for trusted non-3GPP access network for WLAN
access where GTP/PMIP-based S2a is used.
Figure 11be: Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration for trusted WLAN access
for GTP/PMIP-based S2a
The P-GW ensures that the advertised Ipv6 prefix is globally unique. Regarding
the handling of Duplicate Address Detection, follow subclause 11.2.1.3.2.
The UE constructs its full Ipv6 address in accordance with RFC 4862[83]. For
the handling of Ipv6 interface identifier, refer to subclause 11.2.1.3.2.
If the P-GW, S-GW and TWAN receive Neighbor Solicitation message from the UE,
it shall answer with Neighbor Advertisement message.
To renew the allocated Ipv6 prefix, the P-GW (GTP based S5/S8), S-GW (PMIPv6
based S5/S8) or TWAN (GTP/PMIP based S2a) shall send an Ipv6 Router
Advertisement (solicited or unsolicited) to the UE with the same assigned Ipv6
prefix and and new non-zero values in preferred and valid lifetime fields for
the PDN connection (PDN type Ipv4v6 or Ipv6), before the Router Advertisement
lifetime and prefix lifetime expiry, as specified in IETF RFC 4861 [89]. When
sending the Ipv6 Router Advertisement message, the S-GW may trigger the paging
(e.g. by sending a Downlink Data Notification message to the MME) if the UE is
in idle state. In order to reduce paging an idle UE to deliver RA, the Router
Advertisement lifetime and Ipv6 prefix lifetime shall be configured
accordingly.
If a UE supports multiple PDN connections functionality, it can connect to
multiple P-GWs simultaneously, or it can access multiple PDNs through a single
P-GW. In the former case, the Ipv6 prefix allocated for its default bearer is
used for the UE's dedicated bearers toward the same PDN. In the latter case,
Ipv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration procedure is applied for each PDN
connection.
##### 11.2.1.3.3 Ipv6 Stateful Address Autoconfiguration
Void.
Figure 11bc : Void
##### 11.2.1.3.4 Ipv6 Router Configuration Variables
For Ipv6 Address Autoconfiguration to work properly , network entities which
act as an access router towards the MS/UE, i.e. PDN GW, Serving GW, ePDG and
TWAN, shall be consistent with the RFCs specifying this process (for example
RFC 4862 [83] and RFC 4861 [89]), unless stated otherwise in this or other
3GPP specifications.
RFC 4861 [89] specifies a set of conceptual router configuration variables.
Some of these variables require particular attention in GPRS and EPC in order
to preserve radio resources and MS/UE power consumption while still allowing
for appropriate robustness and fast user-plane set-up time even in bad radio
conditions, or simply because they have a particular meaning in GPRS and EPC.
These particular variables are listed below with appropriate (default) values
and shall be configurable per APN. The values specified hereafter are specific
to GPRS and EPC, and supersede those specified in RFC 4861 [89].
MaxRtrAdvInterval
Shall have a default value of 21 600 s (6 h).
MinRtrAdvInterval
Shall have a default value of 0,75 Ã— MaxRtrAdvInterval i.e.16 200 s (4,5 h).
AdvValidLifetime
Shall have a value giving Prefixes infinite lifetime, i.e. 0xFFFFFFFF. The
assigned prefix remains Preferred until PDP Context/Bearer Deactivation.
AdvPreferredLifetime
Shall have a value giving Prefixes infinite lifetime, i.e. 0xFFFFFFFF. The
assigned prefix remains Preferred until PDP Context/Bearer Deactivation.
RFC 4861 [89] also specifies a number of protocol constants. The following
shall have specific values for GPRS and EPC:
MAX_INITIAL_RTR_ADVERT_INTERVAL
This constant may be a variable within GPRS and EPC. It may have a value that
gradually increases (exponentially or by some other means) with the number of
initial Router Advertisements sent. This will enable a fast set-up of the MS-
GGSN or MS/UE-PDN GW/Serving GW/ePDG/TWAN links in most cases, while still
allowing the MS/UE to receive a Router Advertisement within the initial phase,
even in case of bad radio conditions or slow response time, without having to
send a large number of initial Router Advertisements.
MAX_INITIAL_RTR_ADVERTISEMENTS
This is the number of Router Advertisements sent during the initial phase
after the MS-GGSN or MS/UE-PDN GW/Serving GW/ePDG/TWAN links have been
established. The value of this constant shall be chosen carefully, and in
conjunction with MAX_INITIAL_RTR_ADVERT_INTERVAL, so as to not overload the
radio interface while still allowing the MS/UE to complete its configuration
in a reasonable delay. For instance, the default value could be chosen so that
initial Router Advertisements are sent for at least 30 s.
After the initial phase, the periodicity is controlled by the
MaxRtrAdvInterval and the MinRtrAdvInterval constants.
##### 11.2.1.3.5 Ipv6 Prefix Delegation via DHCPv6
Optionally, a single network prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix may be
assigned to a PDN connection. In this case, the /64 default prefix used for
Ipv6 stateless autoconfiguration will be allocated from this network prefix;
the remaining address space from the network prefix can be delegated to the
PDN connection using prefix delegation after the PDP context
activation/default bearer establishment and Ipv6 prefix allocation via Ipv6
stateless address autoconfiguration as defined in clause
11.2.1.3.2/11.2.1.3.2a. When PLMN based parameter configuration is used, the
GGSN / PDN GW provides the requested Ipv6 prefix from a locally provisioned
pool. When external PDN based Ipv6 prefix allocation is used, the GGSN / PDN
GW may obtain the prefix from the external PDN as per subclauses 16.4 and
16a.4.
For the detailed description of the UE uses DHCPv6 to request additional Ipv6
prefixes refer to 3GPP TS 23.060 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.401 [77].
#### 11.2.1.4 Access to Internet, Intranet or ISP with Mobile Ipv4
General
A way to allow users to roam from one environment to another, between fixed
and mobile, between public and private as well as between different public
systems is to use Mobile IP RFC 3344 [30]. Mobile IP (MIP) is a mobility
management protocol developed by IETF. The Mobile IP Foreign Agent (FA) RFC
3344 [30] is located in the Core Network in the GGSN. MIP also uses a Home
Agent (HA) RFC 3344 [30] which may or may not be located in a PLMN network.
Interworking model for MIP
A FA is located in the GGSN. The interface between the GGSN and the FA will
probably not be standardised as the GGSN/FA is considered being one integrated
node. The mapping between these two is a matter of implementation. Each FA
must be configured with at least one care-of address. In addition a FA must
maintain a list that combines IP addresses with TEIDs of all the visiting MSs
that have registered with the FA. IP packets destined for the MS are
intercepted by the HA and 39orrectio to the MS's care-of address, i.e. the FA.
The FA deâ€‘tunnels the packets and forwards the packets to the MS. Mobile IP
related signalling between the MS and the FA is done in the user plane. MIP
registration messages RFC 3344 [30] are sent with UDP.
Figure 11c: The protocol stacks for the Gi IP reference point in the MIP
signalling plane
Figure 11d: Protocol stacks for user access with MIP
In figure 11d: \"(Tunneling)\" is intended to show asymmetric traffic flow.
Tunneling (IP-in-IP) is only used in the direction from the ISP towards the
MT.
Authentication of the user is supported in Mobile Ipv4. This authentication
mechanism may involve communication with an authentication server (e.g.
RADIUS), although this is not shown in figure 11d.
Address allocation -- at PDP context activation no IP address is allocated to
the MS indicated by 0.0.0.0. in the \"Requested PDP Address\" field. If the MS
does not have a static IP address which it could register with the HA, it will
acquire a dynamic IP address from the HA RFC 2794 [25]. After completion of
the PDP activation the SGSN is informed of the assigned IP address by means of
the GGSN initiated PDP Context Modification Procedure.
An example of a signalling scheme, shown in figure 11e, is described below. In
this example the MS is separated into a TE and MT, with AT commands and PPP
used in-between (see 3GPP TS 27.060 [10]). The PS attach procedures have been
omitted for clarity.
Figure 11e: Example of PDP Context activation with Mobile IP registration\
(the PS attach procedure not included)
1\. The AT command carries parameters that the MT needs to request the PDP
Context Activation. The important parameter here, is the APN (Access Point
Name), see clause A below. The AT command is followed by a setup of the PPP
connection between the MT and the TE.
2\. As part of the PPP connection, LCP negotiates Maximum-Receive-Unit between
the TE and the MT. No PPP authentication is required when using MIPv4.
3\. As part of the PPP connection, the TE sends an IPCP Configure Request
using the MIPv4 configuration option (see RFC 2290 [37]). The TE sends either
its Home Address or a null address (i.e. 0.0.0.0) if the Network Address
identifier is used (see RFC 2794 [25]).
4\. The MT sends the \"Activate PDP Context Request\" to the SGSN. The message
includes various parameters of which the \"APN\" (Access Point Name) and the
\"Requested PDP Address\" are of interest here. The TE/MT may use APN to
select a reference point to a certain external network or to select a service.
APN is a logical name referring to the external packet data network or to a
service that the subscriber wishes to connect to. The \"Requested PDP
Address\" should be omitted for all MSs using Mobile IP. This is done
irrespective of if the TE has a permanently assigned Mobile IP address from
its Mobile IP home network, a previously assigned dynamic home address from
its Mobile IP home network or if it wishes the Mobile IP home network to
allocate a \"new\" dynamic home address.
A. The SGSN will base the choice of GGSN based on the APN that is given by the
MS.
5\. The SGSN requests the selected GGSN to set up a PDP Context for the MS.
The PDP address and APN fields are the same as in the \"Activate PDP Context
Request\" message.
6\. A Create PDP Context Response is sent from the GGSN/FA to the SGSN. If the
creation of PDP Context was successful, some parameters will be returned to
the SGSN, if not, an error code will be returned. If the GGSN has been
configured, by the operator, to use a Foreign Agent for the requested APN, the
PDP address returned by the GGSN shall be set to 0.0.0.0. indicating that the
PDP address shall be reset by the MS with a Home Agent after the PDP context
activation procedure.
7\. The Activate PDP Context Accept message is sent by the SGSN to the MT and
contains similar information as the Create PDP Context Response message.
8\. The MT sends an IPCP Configure Ack to the TE in order to terminate the PPP
connection phase.
9\. The Agent Advertisement RFC 3344 [30] is an ICMP (Internet Control Message
Protocol) Router Advertisement message with a mobility agent advertisement
extension. The latter part contains parameters of the FA that the mobile node
needs, among those are one or more care-of addresses that the FA offers. This
message should be sent, in the Packet Domain user plane, as an IP limited
broadcast message, i.e. destination address 255.255.255.255, however only on
the TEID for the requesting MS to avoid broadcast over the radio interface.
10\. The Mobile IP Registration Request is sent from the mobile node to the
GGSN/FA across the Packet Domain backbone as user traffic. The mobile node
includes its (permanent) home address as a parameter RFC 3344 [30].
Alternatively, it can request a temporary address assigned by the home network
by sending 0.0.0.0 as its home address, and include the Network Access
Identifier (NAI) in a Mobile-Node-NAI Extension RFC 2794 [25] and RFC 2486
[31].
11\. The FA forwards the Mobile IP Registration Request to the home network of
the mobile node, where a home agent (HA) processes it. Meanwhile, the GGSN/FA
needs to store the home address of the mobile node or the NAI and the local
link address of the MS, i.e. the TEID (Tunnel Endpoint ID).
12\. The Registration Reply is sent from the home network to the FA, which
extracts the information it needs and forwards the message to the mobile node
in the Packet Domain user plane. As the FA/GGSN knows the TEID and the NAI or
home address, it can pass it on to the correct MS.
B. The GGSN/FA extracts the home address from the Mobile IP Registration Reply
message and updates its GGSN PDP Context.
13\. The GGSN triggers a \"GGSN initiated PDP Context modification procedure\"
in order to update the PDP address in the SGSN and in the MT.
#### 11.2.1.5 IP Fragmentation Across Gi/Sgi
3GPP and non-3GPP accesses provide IP services for a MS/UE. The GGSN/P-GW
endpoint is a GTPv1-U tunnel (controlled by GTP Gn/Gp or S5/S8/S2a/S2b) or IP
tunnel (controlled by S5/S8/S2a/S2b PMIPv6 or employed by a UE with MIPv4 or
DSMIPv6).
The MTU of the IP tunnel on the MS/UE side of the IP link may be different
than the MTU of the IP link connecting the GGSN/P-GW to the PDN. As a result
IP packets crossing the Gi/Sgi interface may need to be fragmented.
Unnecessary fragmentation should be avoided when possible due to the
following;
\- Fragmentation is bandwidth inefficient, since the complete IP header is
duplicated in each fragment.
\- Fragmentation is CPU intensive since more fragments require more processing
at IP endpoints and IP routers. It also requires additional memory at the
receiver.
\- If one fragment is lost, the complete IP packet has to be discarded. The
reason is there is no selective retransmission of IP fragments provided in
Ipv4 or Ipv6.
To avoid unnecessary fragmenting of IP packets the MS/UE, or a server in an
external IP network, may find out the end-to-end MTU by path MTU discovery and
hence fragment correctly at the source. IP Fragmentation on Gi/Sgi shall be
handled according to IETF RFC 791 [16] and IETF RFC 2460 [49]. The GGSN/P-GW
shall enforce the MTU of IP packets to/from the MS/UE based on IETF RFC 791
[16] and IETF RFC 2460 [49].
### 11.2.2 Access to networks handling Non-IP data services through Packet
Domain
The support of Non-IP data is part of the CIoT EPS optimisations (see 3GPP TS
23.401 [77]) and 3GPP TS 23.060 [3]). A PDN/PDP Type \"Non-IP\" is used for
Non-IP data. The Non-IP data delivery to the network handling Non-IP data
services is accomplished by one of two mechanisms:
\- Delivery using SCEF
\- Delivery using a Point-to-Point (PtP) SGi tunnel
Data delivery using SCEF is further described in 3GPP TS 29.128 [110].
In order to allow Non-IP delivery data using SGi PtP tunnelling based on
UDP/IP (see subclause 11.8), the Packet Domain may offer direct transparent
access to the Non-IP Packet Data Network with the following characteristics:
\- The IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix is assigned as part of the PDN
connection establishment and identifies the PDN connection of the UE within
the PLMN domain.
\- IP address allocation procedures for the UE (i.e. PDN connection) are
performed by the GGSN/P-GW based on APN configuration. Only a single IP
address is used (i.e. either IPv4 or IPv6 prefix+Interface Identifier is
allocated/assigned). In case of IPv6 the GGSN/P-GW assigns an Interface
Identifier for the PDN connection. The IP address or IP prefix is not provided
to the UE (i.e. SLAAC / Router Advertisements are not performed. DHCP or
DHCPv6 are not used).
\- The assigned IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix is used for UDP/IP encapsulation
for PtP tunneling between the Non-IP network and the GGSN/P-GW (see subclause
11.8).
\- Stateless Address Autoconfiguration does not apply for IPv6. Both IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses belong to the operator addressing space.
User authentication and encryption of user data when accessing networks
handling Non-IP data services is outside 3GPP specification.
## 11.3 Numbering and Addressing
In the case of interworking with public IP networks (such as the Internet),
the PLMN operator shall use public network addresses. These public addresses
can be reserved from the responsible IP numbering body, or from an ISP with
which the PLMN operator has an agreement. In case of IPv6, a global IPv6
prefix can be obtained from the same sources.
In the case of interworking with private IP networks, two scenarios can be
identified:
1\. the PLMN operator manages internally the subnetwork IPv4 addresses and/ or
IPv6 prefixes as applicable. Each private network is assigned a unique
subnetwork IPv4 addresses and/ or IPv6 prefixes. Normal routing functions are
used to route packets to the appropriate private network;
2\. each private network manages its own addressing. In general this will
result in different private networks having overlapping address ranges. A
logically separate connection (e.g. an IP in IP tunnel or layer 2 virtual
circuit) is used between the GGSN/P-GW and each private network. In this case
the IP address alone is not necessarily unique. The pair of values, Access
Point Name (APN) and IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefixes, is unique.
NOTE 1: In IPv6, \"site-local addresses\"were originally designed to be used
for addressing inside of a site that is similar to the usage of \"private
addresses\" in IPv4. The usage of \"site-local-addresses\" is deprecated as
specified in RFC 4291 [82]. Existing implementations and deployments may
continue using site-local addresses. However, in new implementations the
prefix that was allocated for \"site local addresses\" shall be treated as for
\"global unicast addresses\", see RFC 4291 [82].
The PLMN operator allocates the IP addresses for the subscribers in either of
the following ways.
\- The PLMN operator allocates a static IPv4 address and/or a static IPv6
prefix when the subscription record is built. The IPv4 address and/or IPv6
prefix are respectively reserved from a pool of free IPv4 addresses and/or
IPv6 prefixes. Each external network has its own pool of IPv4 addresses and/or
IPv6 prefixes.
\- The PLMN operator allocates (either on its own or in conjunction with the
external network) a dynamic IPv4 address and/or a dynamic IPv6 prefix as
described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3], 3GPP TS 23.401 [77] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [78].
For UEs used for Machine-Type Communications (MTC) as described in 3GPP TS
23.401 [77] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [3] and Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) as
described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [77] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [3], IPv6 address
allocation should be the primary mechanism for IP address allocation. IPv4
based address allocation is considered a transition solution and is deprecated
for MTC used over 3GPP accesses.
NOTE 2: For implementation guidelines related to transition and other aspects
of IPv4 address usage see 3GPP TS 23.221 [99] Annex B.
In case of transferring Non-IP data over SGi PtP tunnelling based on UDP/IP
(see subclause 11.8) the PLMN operator uses private network addresses for the
establishment of the tunnel.
## 11.4 Charging
The PLMN operator may define the accuracy of the charging mechanism using one
of the following categories:
\- every source/destination pair is logged separately;
\- source/destination pairs are logged to an accuracy of subnetworks;
\- source/destination pairs are logged to an accuracy of connection types
(e.g., external data network, corporate network, another mobile).
## 11.5 Domain Name System Server (DNS Server)
Provision of Domain Name services shall be provided by the PLMN operators in
the transparent case and the ISP in the non transparent case. For non-EPS
networks see 3GPP TS 23.060 [3] (DNS documentation is provided in RFC 1034
[19] and RFC 1035 [58]) and for EPS networks see 3GPP TS 29.303 [96].
## 11.6 Screening
The way the PLMN is performing the operator controlled screening and the
subscription controlled screening is out of the scope of the present document.
These functions may be done, for example, in a firewall.
## 11.7 IP Multicast access
NOTE: This section is applicable only to GERAN and UTRAN.
The Packet Domain could allow access to IP Multicast traffic coming from an
external network. The support of IPâ€‘Multicast in the Packet Domain is
optional.
In order for the Packet Core Network to support Multicast traffic that will
allow the MS/UE to subscribe to multicast groups from outside the PLMN, the
GGSN/P-GW shall support IGMP (Ipv4) and/or MLD (Ipv6) and one or more Inter-
Router Multicast protocols, such as DVMRP, MOSPF, or PIM-SM.
IGMP/MLD is an integral part of IP. All hosts wishing to receive IP multicasts
are required to implement IGMP (or equivalent) and class-D Ipv4 addresses or
MLD and Ipv6 multicast according to RFC 2710 [48]. IGMP/MLD messages are
encapsulated in IP datagrams.
To be able to deliver IP-Multicast packets to the appropriate Tes, the
GGSN/P-GW may have an IP-Multicast proxy functionality.
The IP-Multicast proxy will perform the following tasks:
NOTE: In this example it is assumed that IGMP/MLD is used as a Host-Router
Multicast protocol.
\- maintain a list of mobiles that joined one or more Multicast groups. This
list is built/updated each time the GGSN/P-GW receives an IGMP Join or MLD
Report message from the mobile;
\- send, based on this maintained list of mobiles, multicast routing
information to the routers attached to the Packet Domain, allowing them to
route multicast packets;
\- upon reception by the GGSN/P-GW of multicast packets, make and send a copy
as Point-to-Point packets, to each mobile of the group.
IP-Multicast traffic can only be handled after an MS/UE has attached to the
Packet Domain, and a bearer (e.g. Activated PDP context(s)) (including
possibly authentication) pointing to the preferred ISP/external network for
this purpose. The Multicast traffic is handled at the application level from a
Packet Domain perspective and is sent over UDP/IP.
Figure 12 depicts the protocol configuration for handling Multicast traffic
(control plane) for the non-EPC based domain case. The Multicast traffic
handling affects the GGSN by the introduction of the IP-Multicast proxy and
the support for an Inter-Router Multicast protocol and a host-router multicast
protocol. If the protocol configuration for handling Multicast traffic
(control plane) is applied for Sgi (i.e EPC based packet domain), the P-GW has
the functionality of GGSN and Sgi corresponds to the Gi in Figure 12.
Figure 12: Protocol configuration for IP-Multicast handling (control plane)
## 11.8 Non-IP data transfering over SGi
### 11.8.1 General
When support of Non-IP data is provided at the Gi/SGi interface, different
Point-to-Point (PtP) tunneling techniques may be used. When using PtP
tunneling by UDP/IP encapsulation subclause 11.8.2 below shall be followed.
Other techniques as described in clause 11.8.3 below may be used.
The Gi/SGi based Non-IP data delivery is applicable to the User Plane CIoT EPS
Optimization and the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimization (see 3GPP TS 23.401
[77] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [3]).
### 11.8.2 Gi/SGi PtP tunnelling based on UDP/IP
Gi/SGi PtP tunnelling based on UDP/IP may be used to deliver Non-IP data to an
AS via Gi/SGi.
The PtP tunnel is set up by configuration of tunnel parameters in both end of
the tunnel.\ The following parameters are pre-configured in the GGSN/P-GW per
APN;
\- the UDP destination port number to use when sending Non-IP data;
\- the UDP port number it wants to receive Non-IP data;
\- the destination IP address to be used for sending Non-IP data.
NOTE 1: Many APNs can resolve to the same P-GW, but each APN can be unique to
a particular AS.
The following is pre-configured in the AS;
\- the UDP destination port number to use when sending Non-IP data;
\- the UDP port number it wants to receive Non-IP data.
NOTE 2: The GGSN/P-GW as well as the AS can use any UDP port numbers not
assigned by IANA. The port numbers used need to be aligned between peers.
IP address allocation procedures for the UE (i.e. PDN connection) are
performed by the GGSN/P-GW as described in subclause 11.2.2.\ The UE IP
address for the PDN connection or IPv6 prefix allocated for the PDN
connection+suffix assigned for the PtP tunnel end point in the GGSN/P-GW is
used as source address in the GGSN/P-GW and as destination address in the AS
for the PtP tunnel.
During the PDP context/PDN connection establishment, the GGSN/P-GW associates
the GTP-U tunnel for the PDP context/PDN connection with the Gi/SGi PtP
tunnel. The GTP-U tunnel with PDP/PDN type "Non-IP" is used.
The GGSN/P-GW acts as a transparent forwarding node between the UE used for
CIoT and the AS.
NOTE 3: The UE can include application level identity to AS, what kind of
identity is out of scope of this specification.
For uplink delivery, if the uplink data is received from the GTP-U tunnel the
GGSN/P-GW shall forward the received data to the AS over the Gi/SGi PtP tunnel
associated with the GTP-U tunnel using UDP/IP encapsulation with the
destination address of the AS and the configured UDP destination port number
for "Non-IP" data as described above.
For downlink delivery, the AS shall send the data using UDP/IP encapsulation
with the IP address or IPv6 prefix+suffix of the UE as destination address and
the configured UDP destination port number for "Non-IP" data as described
above.
NOTE 3: The UDP source port number to use for both uplink and downlink Non-IP
data transfer can be a pre-configured or a locally allocated port number in
the GGSN/P-GW and AS respectively.
NOTE 4: For downlink delivery, the GGSN/P-GW decapsulates the received data
(i.e. removes the UDP/IP headers) and forwards the data to SGSN/S-GW on the
GTP-U tunnel identified by the IP address or the IPv6 prefix of the UE (i.e.
PDN connection) for delivery to the UE.
Figure 11.8: Protocol configuration for Non-IP data (user plane) using SGiPtP
tunneling
Figure 11.9: Protocol configuration for Non-IP data (user plane) using Gi PtP
tunneling.
### 11.8.3 Other SGi PtP tunnelling mechanisms
SGi PtP tunnelling mechanisms such as PMIPv6/GRE, L2TP, GTP-C/U, etc, may be
used to deliver Non-IP data to AS via SGi.
The PtP tunnel is established towards the AS by the P-GW. Depending on the
type of protocol employed on the SGi PtP tunnel, the SGi PtP tunnel setup may
be done at the time of attach or at the time of first MO datagram being sent
by the CIoT UE.
The P-GW selects the AS based on the P-GW configuration (eg. per APN, or per
PtP tunnel type etc).
NOTE: IP address allocation procedures for the UE are not performed by the
P-GW.
For uplink Non-IP data, the P-GW forwards the received data to the AS over the
established SGi PtP tunnel.
For downlink Non-IP data, the AS locates the right SGi PtP tunnel for the UE
(using information such as UE identifiers in the Non-IP protocol itself, etc)
to forward the data. The AS sends the data to P-GW over the established SGi
PtP tunnel. The P-GW inturn sends the data to S-GW on the GTP-U tunnel
identified by the associated SGi PtP tunnel for delivery to the UE.
# 12 Interworking with PDN (PPP)
## 12.1 General
By means of the PDP type 'PPP' Packet Domain may support interworking with
networks based on the point-to-point protocol (PPP), as well as with networks
based on any protocol supported by PPP through one of its Network Control
Protocols (NCPs). All protocols currently supported by PPP NCPs are listed in
RFC 1661 [21a] and RFC 1662 [21b]. It may also support interworking by means
of tunnelled PPP, by e.g. the Layer Two Tunnelling Protocol (L2TP).
## 12.2 PDN Interworking Model
The interworking point is at the Gi reference point. The GGSN for interworking
with the ISP/PDN is the access point of the Packet Domain (see figure 13). The
GGSN will either terminate the PPP connection towards the MS or may further
relay PPP frames to the PDN. The PPP frames may be tunnelled in e.g. L2TP.
Figure 13: The protocol stacks for the Gi PPP reference point
In case the external PDN is an IP based network and the GGSN terminates PPP
the same description applies as specified in subclause 11.2.
In case the GGSN tunnels PPP frames to the PDN, the GGSN may behave like a LAC
towards the external network.
### 12.2.1 Virtual dial-up- and direct Access to PDNs, or ISPs through Packet
Domain
The access to PDNs, or ISPs may involve specific functions such as: user
authentication, user's authorization, end to end encryption between MS and
PDN/ISP, allocation of a dynamic address belonging to the PLMN/PDN/ISP
addressing space, etc.
For this purpose the PLMN may offer, based on configuration data:
\- direct access to an IP based Intranet/ISP using a protocol configuration as
depicted in figure 14. Here DHCP and/or RADIUS are used between the GGSN and
Intranet/ISP for performing the specific functions mentioned above. The Packet
Domain may also offer access to networks based on any protocol supported by
PPP through one of its Network Control Protocols (NCPs);
Figure 14: Protocol stack for direct access to IP-based Intranets/ISPs
\- virtual dial-up access to a PDN with PPP frame tunnelling as depicted in
figure 15.
Figure 15: Protocol stack for virtual dial-up access with PPP frame tunnelling
#### 12.2.1.1 Procedural description
In this case:
\- the MS is given an address belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing space.
The address is given either at subscription in which case it is a static
address or at PDP context activation in which case it is a dynamic address.
This address is used for packet forwarding within the GGSN and for packet
forwarding on the Intranet/ISP. This requires a link between the GGSN and an
address allocation server, such as AAA, or DHCP, belonging to the
Intranet/ISP;
\- the communication between the Packet Domain and the Intranet/ISP may be
performed over any network, even an insecure e.g. the Internet. In case of an
insecure connection between the GGSN and the Intranet/ISP there may be a
specific security protocol in between. This security protocol is defined by
mutual agreement between PLMN operator and Intranet/ISP administrator.
The following description bullet items describe the signal flow.
1) The TE sends an AT-command to the MT to set up parameters.
2) The MT sends the Activate PDP context request message to the SGSN which
sends the Create PDP context request message to the chosen GGSN.
3) The GGSN deduces from the APN:
\- the server(s) to be used for address allocation and authentication;
\- the protocol such as RADIUS, DHCP or L2TP to be used with this / those
server(s);
\- the communication and security feature needed to dialogue with this / those
server(s) e.g. tunnel ,IPSec security association, dial-up connection (using
possibly PPP).
As an example the GGSN may use one of the following options:
\- RADIUS for authentication and IP-address allocation. The AAA server
responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client
in the GGSN;
\- RADIUS for authentication and DHCP for host configuration and address
allocation. The AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-
Reject to the RADIUS client in the GGSN. After a successful authentication,
the DHCP client discovers the DHCP server(s) in the ISP/Intranet and receives
host configuration data;
\- L2TP for forwarding PPP frames to a L2TP Network Server.
4) The GGSN sends back to the SGSN a Create PDP Context Response message.
5) Depending on the cause value received in the Create PDP Context Response
the SGSN may either send the Activate PDP Context Accept message or send the
Activate PDP Context Reject message to the MS.
6) The MT responds with an AT-response that may indicate whether the context
activation was successful or not. In the case of a non-successful context
activation the response may also indicate the cause.
In case of a successful context activation, the TE will start its PPP protocol
after the LLC link has been established. The LCP, Authentication and NCP
negotiations are then carried out. During these negotiations the GGSN may
acknowledge values, for any LCP options related to 'L2' framing (e.g. 'ACCM',
'ACFC' and 'FCS-Alternatives'), as proposed by the MT, which itself is
forwarding these negotiations from the TE.
NOTE: With the \\"PPP\" the MT may provide a PPP relay (or proxy)
function between the TE and GGSN. This gives the opportunity for the MT to
intercept the 'L2' framing end to end negotiations.
EXAMPLE: In the following example the successful PDP context activation is
shown.
Figure 16a
# 13 Interworking with PDN (DHCP)
## 13.1 General
In current LAN environments the most commonly used configuration protocol is
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, RFC 2131 [26]) and DHCPv6 (Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol for Ipv6, IETF RFC 3315 [46]). It provides a
mechanism for passing a large set of configuration parameters to hosts
connected to a TCP/IP network (IP address, sub-net mask, domain name, MTU,
etc.) in an automatic manner. Moreover DHCP may assign IP addresses to clients
for a finite lease time, allowing for sequential reassignment of addresses to
different users.
The lease time is chosen by the administrator of the DHCP server (in the
external network), and is therefore out of the scope of the present document.
The Packet Domain may obtain IP address via external DHCP server during the
packet bearer establishment procedures (e.g. PDP Context activation, default
bearer establishment). The GGSN/P-GW acts as a DHCP client towards the
external DHCP server.
The Packet Domain offers the end user the possibility to run DHCP end-to-end
the same way as he does when connected directly to a LAN (e.g. an enterprise
Intranet). No modifications should be required in common implementations of
DHCP clients and servers. However in non-EPC based Packet Domain, a DHCP relay
agent function is needed in the GGSN so as to allow correct routing of DHCP
requests and replies between the TE and the DHCP servers. In EPC based Packet
Domain for 3GPP access networks, the P-GW acts a DHCP server towards the UE
and it acts as a DHCP client towards the external DHCP server. For trusted
non-3GPP access networks, the non-3GPP access network may act as a DHCP relay
or DHCP server. In the trusted WLAN access network, the TWAN acts a DHCP
server towards the UE and PGW acts as a DHCP client towards the external DHCP
server for the GTP/PMIP-based S2a.
In non-EPC based Packet Domain,at PDP context activation no IP address is
allocated, this is done afterwards through DHCP. After the TE's configuration
has been completed by DHCP, the PDP context is updated by means of the GGSN-
initiated PDP Context Modification Procedure in order to reflect the newly
assigned IP address.
In the following cases the bearer associated with the allocated IP address
(i.e. Ipv4 address or Ipv6 prefix) shall be released:
\- if the DHCP lease expires;
\- if the DHCP renewal is rejected by the DHCP server;
\- if the IP address is changed during the renewal process. Usually when the
lease is renewed, the IP address remains unchanged. However, if for any reason
(e.g. poor configuration of the DHCP server), a different IP address is
allocated during the lease renewal process the associated bearer shall be
released.
## 13.2 PDN Interworking Model of GGSN for DHCP
A DHCP relay agent shall be located in the GGSN used for interworking with the
IP network as illustrated in the following figure 16b.
Figure 16b: The protocol stacks for the Gi IP reference point for DHCP
The DHCP relay agent relays the requests received from the DHCP client to the
DHCP server(s), and the replies received from the server(s) to the
corresponding client. The DHCP relay agent allows for the replies from DHCP
servers to be delivered to the correct terminal, as the logical connection
from the MT terminates in the GGSN, and consequently only the GGSN holds
enough information to locate the DHCP client. How the DHCP relay agent
identifies the MT based on the DHCP messages is out of the scope of 3GPP
standardisation.
DHCP provides mechanisms for user authentication and integrity protection, but
does not offer any message confidentiality, therefore additional mechanisms
(e.g. Ipsec tunnel) may be provided if the link towards the external network
is not secure. However this is out of the scope of the present document.
Apart from the particulars mentioned above, this model is basically the same
as the one for interworking with IP networks described elsewhere in the
present document. Using DHCP corresponds to the transparent access case as the
GGSN does not take part in the functions of authentication, authorisation,
address allocation, etc.
### 13.2.1 Address allocation by the Intranet or ISP
The MS is given an address belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing space. The
address is given dynamically immediately after the PDP context activation.
This address is used for packet forwarding between the Intranet/ISP and the
GGSN and within the GGSN.
The MS may authenticate itself to the Intranet/ISP by means of the relevant
DHCP procedures (see RFC 3118 [45]).
The protocol configuration options are retrieved from the DHCP server
belonging to the Intranet/ISP.
Figure 16c: Protocol stack for access with DHCP end-to-end
#### 13.2.1.1 Address allocation using DHCPv4
The following description bullet items describe the DHCPv4 signal flow. For a
detailed description of the DHCP messages refer to RFC 2131 [26] and RFC 1542
[27]. The end-to-end protocol configuration is depicted in figure 16c.
1) The TE and MT exchange several AT commands carrying the QoS and other
parameters requested by the TE, and requesting the activation of a PDP context
of PDP type IP. The TE selects the APN of the configured Intranet/ISP offering
a DHCP service, or the APN consisting of the Reserved Service Label for DHCP
that the user has subscribed to. In the latter case the TE will be connected
to a PLMN operator-configured service provider offering a DHCP service
(according to the APN selection rules).
2) The MT sends the Activate PDP Context Request message to the SGSN with an
empty PDP address field.
3) The SGSN selects a GGSN based on the APN requested by the MS and sends a
Create PDP Context Request message to that GGSN. The GGSN replies with a
Create PDP Context Response message. If the GGSN has not been configured by
the operator to use external PDN address allocation with DHCP for the
requested APN, the cause shall be set to 'Service not supported'. No IP
address is assigned at this point; the PDP address returned by the GGSN is set
to 0.0.0.0, indicating that the IP address is not yet assigned and shall be
negotiated by the TE with the Intranet/ISP after the PDP context activation
procedure.
4) Depending on the cause value received in the Create PDP Context Response
the SGSN sends either an Activate PDP Context Accept or an Activate PDP
Context Reject back to the MT. In case of a successful activation the PDP
context is established with the PDP address set to 0.0.0.0.
5) Upon reception of the Activate PDP Context Accept, the MT sends an AT
response to the TE that acknowledges the completion of the PDP context
activation procedure.
6) The TE sends a DHCPDISCOVER message with the IP destination address set to
the limited broadcast address (all 1s). The GGSN will pass the DHCPDISCOVER to
the DHCP relay agent which will relay the request to the DHCP server
configured for the APN of the PDP context. If more than one DHCP server is
configured for a given APN, the request will be sent to all of them. The DHCP
relay agent will add enough information to the DHCPDISCOVER message to be able
to relay the replies back to the MS. How this is done is out of the scope of
3GPP standardisation.
7) DHCP servers receiving the DHCPDISCOVER request reply by sending a
DHCPOFFER message including an offered IP address. The DHCP relay agent
forwards the replies to the proper MS.
8) The TE chooses one of the possibly several DHCPOFFERs and sends a
DHCPREQUEST confirming its choice and requesting additional configuration
information. The relay agent relays the DHCPOFFER as explained in step 6.
9) The selected DHCP server receives the DHCPREQUEST and replies with a
DHCPACK containing the configuration information requested by the TE. The DHCP
relay agent relays the DHCPACK to the TE.
10) The DHCP relay agent passes the allocated IP address to the GGSN which
stores it in the corresponding PDP context. The GGSN then initiates a PDP
context modification procedure by sending an Update PDP Context Request to the
appropriate SGSN with the End User Address information element set to the
allocated IP address.
11) The SGSN sends a Modify PDP Context Request to the MT with the allocated
IP address in the PDP Address information element. The MT acknowledges by
sending a Modify PDP Context Accept to the SGSN.
12) The SGSN sends an Update PDP Context Response to the GGSN. The PDP context
has been successfully updated with the allocated IP address.
EXAMPLE: In the following example a successful PDP context activation with use
of DHCP from end to end is shown.
Figure16d: DHCPv4 signal flow
#### 13.2.1.2 Void.
### 13.2.2 Other configuration by the Intranet or ISP (Ipv6 only)
When using Ipv6, in some situations the MS may need additional configuration
information from the Intranet or ISP besides the IP address. It may for
example be IMS related configuration options (see 3GPP TS 24.229 [47]). If the
MS is DHCP capable and the Ipv6 address has been allocated using Stateless
Address Autoconfiguration, the MS may use a procedure as in the example below
to configure additional external network protocol parameters, or other
parameters that apply to the Intranet or ISP. The GGSN shall in this case
indicate to the MS that there is additional configuration information to
retrieve by setting the O-flag in the Router Advertisements. This shall be
configured per APN in the GGSN.
The following description bullet items describe an example of a signal flow,
where the MS directs an Information-Request to the
All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address. The MS may also direct
the message to a specific server instead of all servers. For a detailed
description of the DHCPv6 messages refer to the DHCPv6 IETF RFC 3315 [46]. The
sequence is depicted in figure 16f.
1) A Router Advertisement with the O-flag set, is sent from GGSN to TE to
indicate to it to retrieve other configuration information.
2) The TE sends an INFORMATION-REQUEST message with the IP destination address
set to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address defined in the
DHCPv6 IETF RFC 3315 [46]. The source address shall be the link-local address
of the MS. The DHCP relay agent in the GGSN shall forward the message.
3) DHCP servers receiving the forwarded INFORMATION-REQUEST message, reply by
sending a RELAYâ€‘REPLY message, with the \"Relay Message\" option including a
REPLY message with the requested configuration parameters.
The TE chooses one of the possibly several REPLY messages and extracts the
configuration information.
EXAMPLE: In the following example a request for information with use of DHCPv6
from end to end is shown.
Figure 16f: DHCPv6 Other configuration signal flow
## 13.3 PDN Interworking Model of P-GW for DHCP
A DHCP Client shall be located in the P-GW used for interworking with the IP
network as illustrated in Figure 16g.
Figure 16g: The protocol stacks for the Sgi IP reference point for DHCP
The DHCP client function in P-GW shall be used to allocate IP address(es) to
the UE and/or to configure associated parameters via external DHCP servers in
PDN(s). As both Ipv4 and Ipv6 address allocation are supported in EPS, the
P-GW shall have both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 client functions.
The procedures where the DHCP client function in the P-GW is used are further
described in TS 23.060 [3], TS 23.401 [77] and TS 23.402 [78]. The procedures
are Ipv4 address allocation and Ipv4 parameter configuration via an external
DHCPv4 server in a PDN; Ipv6 Prefix allocation via stateless address
autoconfiguration; and Ipv6 parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv6.
These procedures are detailed in the subclauses below.
### 13.3.1 Address allocation by the Intranet or ISP
The subclauses below provide the signalling flows when the IP address
allocation and/or the IP parameter configuration to a UE is performed via an
external DHCP server in the PDN.
#### 13.3.1.1 Ipv4 Address allocation and Ipv4 parameter configuration via
DHCPv4
The UE may obtain the Ipv4 address and/or its configuration parameters at or
after the initial access signalling (e.g. default bearer establishment) to the
packet domain. The request for Ipv4 address and/or configuration parameters
from the UE may trigger the P-GW acting as DHCPv4 client to request the Ipv4
address and/or configuration parameters from an external DHCPv4 server and
deliver them to the UE. See subclause 11.2.1.2.2 for details. The DHCPv4
functions in the P-GW, the UE and the external DHCPv4 server shall be
compliant to RFC 2131 [26], RFC 1542 [27] and RFC 4039 [79].
The following bullet items describe the successful Ipv4 address allocation and
parameter configuration signalling flow between the P-GW and the external
DHCPv4 server as depicted Figure 16h. For a detailed description of the DHCPv4
messages, refer to RFC 2131 [26], RFC 1542 [27] and RFC 4039 [79].
Figure 16h is an example signalling flow for Ipv4 address allocation and
parameter configuration at the default bearer setup using DHCPv4 as specified
in RFC 2131 [26]. If the optimized signalling (Rapid Commit Option) is used as
per RFC 4039 [79], the messages 2-3 can be eliminated.
1) The DHCPv4 client function in the P-GW sends a DHCPDISCOVER as an IP
limited broadcast message, i.e. the destination address 255.255.255.255,
towards the external PDN. If the P-GW has the DHCPv4 server IP addresses
configured for the APN, the DHCPDISCOVER shall be send as unicast (or even
multicast) to the external DHCPv4 servers.
2) Upon receiving the DHCPDISCOVER request message, the external DHCPv4
servers reply by sending a DHCPOFFER message including an offered IP address.
Several DHCPOFFER messages may be received by the P-GW if multiple DHCPv4
servers respond to the DHCPDISCOVER.
3) The DHCPv4 client function in the P-GW processes the messages and sends a
DHCPREQUEST towards the selected external DHCPv4 server.
4) Upon receiving the DHCPREQUEST message, the selected external DHCPv4 server
acknowledges the address allocation by sending a DHCPACK containing the lease
period (T1), the time-out time (T2) and the configuration information
requested in DHCPREQUEST. The P-GW stores the allocated Ipv4 address, the
lease timers and the configuration parameters. The Ipv4 address and the
configuration parameters shall be delivered to the UE through P-GW to UE
messages.
Figure 16h: The signalling flow for Ipv4 address allocation and parameter
configuration using DHCPv4
Figure 16i is an example signalling flow for Ipv4 address lease renew by using
DHCPv4 protocol as specified in RFC 2131 [26].
1) The DHCPv4 client function in the P-GW sends a unicast DHCPREQUEST towards
the external DHCPv4 server to extend the lease period of the allocated Ipv4
address.
2) The external DHCPv4 server replies with a DHCPACK message confirming the
renewed lease and the T1 and T2 timers are restarted.
Figure 16i: The signalling flow for Ipv4 address lease renew using DHCPv4
#### 13.3.1.2 Ipv6 Prefix allocation via Ipv6 stateless address
autoconfiguration via DHCPv6
When the Ipv6 prefix is allocated from the external PDN, it is the P-GW's
responsibility to obtain the Ipv6 prefix for external PDN, allocate and
release the Ipv6 prefix. The P-GW may use DHCPv6 to obtain the Ipv6 prefix
from the external PDN. In this context, the P-GW shall act as a DHCP client as
per IETF RFC 3315 [46] towards the external DHCPv6 server. The use cases
between the UE and the P-GW that may lead the P-GW to interwork with the
external DHCPv6 servers are described in subclause 11.2.1.3.1a.
#### 13.3.1.3 Ipv6 parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv6
A UE that has obtained an Ipv6 address can use stateless DHCP to request other
configuration information such as a list of DNS recursive name servers or SIP
servers.
For 3GPP networks if such Ipv6 configuration parameters are locally
provisioned in the P-GW, the P-GW returns the requested parameters to the UE
via its DHCPv6 server function. For trusted non-3gpp access networks, if such
Ipv6 configuration parameters are locally provisioned in the P-GW, the P-GW
may return the requested parameters to the UE via its DHCPv6 server function
or the P-GW may return the Ipv6 configuration parameters to the non-3gpp
access network and then the non-3GPP access network may send the parameters to
the UE via its DHCPv6 server function. When the non-3GPP access network is a
trusted WLAN network, the PGW always returns the Ipv6 configuration parameters
to the TWAN via GTP/PMIP message, and then the TWAN sends the parameters to
the UE via its DHCPv6 server function. When an external DHCP6 server in a PDN
is used to obtain the requested parameters, which is the use case covered in
this subclause, the P-GW acts as a DHCPv6 client towards the external DHCPv6
server while acting a DHCPv6 server towards the UE.
The Ipv6 parameter configuration via stateles DHCPv6 function in the UE, the
P-GW and the external DHCPv6 Server shall be compliant to RFC 3736 [80]. An
example signalling flow for the GGSN is described in Subclause 13.2.2. For the
P-GW, the signalling flow is same with the following modifications:
\- For 3GPP access networks, the P-GW sends Router Advertisement for GTP-based
S5/S8. In the case of PMIP-based S5/S8, the S-GW sends the Router
Advertisement. For trusted non-3GPP access networks, the trusted non-3GPP
access network sends the Router Advertisement for PMIP S2a.When the non-3GPP
access network is a trusted WLAN network, the TWAN sends the Router
Advertisement
As stated above, the P-GW acts as a DHCPv6 server towards the UE, while acting
as a DHCPv6 client towards the external DHCPv6 server.
# 13a Interworking with IMS
## 13a.1 General
Interworking with the IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) puts
additional requirements on the GGSN/P-GW. When the MS/UE connects to the IP
Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS), specific parameters in Session
Management messages may be handled. The IMS specific parameters are: IMS
signalling flag, P-CSCF address request, P-CSCF restoration support, returned
P-CSCF address(es) and flow identifier(s).
For interworking with the IMS, the Gx interface (see 3GPP TS 29.212 [75]) is
used to correlate the session (SIP/SDP) and the bearer (PDP Contexts).
The mechanisms in GGSN/P-GW to support IMS shall be:
\- P-CSCF discovery.
\- Dedicated signalling bearer (e.g. PDP contexts) (with or without enhanced
QoS) for IMS signalling; with associated packet filters to permit signalling
to/from designated servers.
\- Gx interface for policy and charging control of bearer (e.g. PDP contexts)
for IMS media flows.
\- P-CSCF restoration.
These mechanisms are however not restricted to the IMS and could be used for
other services that could benefit from these mechanisms.
The P-GW shall not modify the fields Type of Service (IPv4) and Traffic Class
(IPv6).
NOTE: The P-CSCF can support paging policy differentiation for different
traffic or service types over LTE by marking the fields Type of Service (IPv4)
and Traffic Class (IPv6) (see clause L.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [47]).
## 13a.2 IMS Interworking Model
The signalling interface between MS/UE and P-CSCF is a logical interface, i.e.
it is using GPRS or EPC as a bearer. The Gx interface is used for network
communication between the GGSN/P-GW and the PCRF. For a description of the IMS
architecture, refer to 3GPP TS 23.228 [52]. For a more detailed view of
GGSN/P-GW IMS interworking, see 3GPP TS 29.213 [76].
### 13a.2.1 IMS Specific Configuration in the GGSN/P-GW
The GGSN/P-GW shall have a list of preconfigured addresses of signalling
servers (P-CSCF servers). This list shall be provided to MSs/UEs on request.
The list shall be possible to preconfigure per APN.
The GGSN/P-GW shall have locally preconfigured packet filters, and/or
applicable PCC rules, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [75] to be applied on the
dedicated signalling bearer (e.g. PDP context). The packet filters shall
filter up-link and down-link packets and only allow traffic to/from the
signalling servers and to DNS and DHCP servers. The locally preconfigured
packet filters shall be possible to pre-configure per APN.
It shall be possible to enable/disable the use of the Gx interface per APN.
When Gx is enabled the GGSN/P-GW shall handle IP-CAN Bearer Establishment
(e.g. Create PDP Context Requests) as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [75].
The GGSN/P-GW shall support Ipv4 and/or Ipv6 addresses and protocol for IMS
signalling and IMS bearers.
The methods for an MS/UE to discover P-CSCF address(es) may vary depending on
the access technology that the MS/UE is on. The details of the P-CSCF
discovery mechanisms for various accesses are specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [52]
and 3GPP TS 24.229 [47]. For example, for an MS/UE accesing to IMS via GPRS in
GERAN and UTRAN, the GGSN shall provide support for P-CSCF discovery in three
different ways (see 3GPP TS 23.228 [52] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [47]):
\- GPRS procedure for P-CSCF discovery, i.e. request and provision of P-CSCF
address(es) within the PCO IE in GPRS Session Management procedures (see 3GPP
TS 24.008 [54]).
\- Via DHCP servers i.e. the GGSN shall provide the functionality of a DHCP
relay agent
\- If the MS/UE has a P-CSCF FQDN locally configured and request the DNS IP
address(es) from the GGSN (via PCO or DHCP procedures), the GGSN shall be able
to provide DNS IP address(es) to the MS/UE.
Similarly, the PGW shall have similar functional support depending on the
P-CSCF discovery methods supported by the UE on the access technology. For
example, for a UE in 3GPP access network (i.e. GERAN, UTRAN, EUTRAN), the P-GW
shall support same functions as the GGSN that are specified above except that
the P-GW does not act as a DHCP relay agent between the MS/UE and the external
DHCP server. In other words, as specified in clause 13 of this document, the
P-GW shall have DHCP server function towards the MS/UE while acting as a DHCP
client towards external DHCP server, if the P-GW is configured to request DNS
and/or P-CSCF IP addresses from external DHCP servers.
The GGSN/P-GW shall be able to deliver DNS and/or P-CSCF addresses to the
MS/UE if requested by the MS/UE via PCO (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [54] and 3GPP TS
24.301 [84]) or via DHCP procedures using the relevant DHCP options for
Ipv4/Ipv6 DNS and SIP servers (see RFC 2132 [85], RFC 3361 [86], RFC 3646 [87]
and RFC 3319 [88]).
On APNs providing IMS services, the information advertised in Router
Advertisements from GGSN/P-GW to MSs/UEs shall be configured in the same
manner as for other APNs providing Ipv6 services (see subclause 11.2.1.3.4),
except that the \"Oâ€‘flag\" shall be set.
NOTE: The \"O- flag\" shall be set in Ipv6 Router Advertisement messages sent
by the GGSN/P-GW for APNs used for IMS services. This will trigger a DHCP
capable MS/UE to start a DHCPv6 session to retrieve server addresses and other
configuration parameters. An MS/UE which doesn't support DHCP will simply
ignore the \"O-flag\". An MS/UE, which doesn't support DHCP, shall request IMS
specific configuration (e.g. P-CSCF address) via the other discovery methods
supported in the MS/UE (i.e. via locally configured P-CSCF address/FQDN in the
MS/UE or via PCO procedure, if applicable).
The GGSN/P-GW shall have configurable policy rules for controlling bearers
(e.g. PDP contexts) used for signalling as specified in section 13a.2.2.2.
### 13a.2.2 IMS Specific Procedures in the GGSN/P-GW
#### 13a.2.2.1 Request for Signalling Server Address
When an MS/UE indicates a request for a P-CSCF address in the PCO IE in a
Create PDP Context Request message on GERAN/UTRAN or for E-UTRAN in initial
access request (e.g. Attach Request, PDN Connectivity Request), the GGSN/P-GW
shall respond with one or more P-CSCF server addresses if preconfigured for
this APN. If the GGSN/P-GW has no P-CSCF address available, the GGSN/P-GW
shall ignore the request. If the GGSN/P-GW provides more than one P-CSCF
Ipv4/Ipv6 address in the response, the GGSN/P-GW shall sort the addresses with
the highest priority P-CSCF server first in the PCO IE. The GGSN/P-GW may use
different prioritisations for different Mses/UEs, e.g. for load sharing
between the P-CSCF servers.
The GGSN/P-GW may use a keep alive mechanism and/or other type based on local
policy (e.g. statistical monitoring) to be able to detect a failure of P-CSCF
address(es) preconfigured in the APN. The keep alive mechanism should make use
of STUN or CRLF as specified for the UE in 3GPP TS 24.229 [47], clause
K.2.1.5. As an alternative, ICMP echo request/response may be used. The
GGSN/P-GW shall then provide only those P-CSCF address(es) that are available
in a Create PDP Context Response/Create Session Response.
The coding of the PCO IE is described in the 3GPP TS 24.008 [54]. This
procedure shall be followed regardless of whether or not the MS/UE uses a
dedicated PDP context/EPS bearer for IMS signalling, and irrespective of the
Gx status for the APN.
#### 13a.2.2.1a Failure of Signalling Server Address
If the GGSN/P-GW detects a failure:
\- in P-CSCF address(es) being used by the MS/UEs, if received via Gx (as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [95], clause 5); or
\- upon receiving a P-CSCF restoration indication from the MME/SGSN or the
PCRF,
then the GGSN/P-GW shall act as specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [95], clause 5.
#### 13a.2.2.2 Establishment of a PDP Context/EPS Bearer for Signalling
The following applies for establishing a PDP context/EPS bearer for IMS
signalling in the GGSN/P-GW as per 3GPP TS 23.228 [52]:
I. The GGSN/P-GW shall allow IMS signalling on a \"general-purpose PDP
context\"/default EPS bearer, in which case the IMS signalling shall be
provided like any other transparent services provided by the packet domain.
II. The GGSN/P-GW may (dependent on operator policy) also support PDP
Contexts/EPS Bearers dedicated for IMS services. If the the bearer
establishment selected for the APN is controlled by the MS/UE, the MS/UE may
request a dedicated PDP context/EPS Bearer for IMS signalling (see 3GPP TS
24.229 [47]) by setting the IM CN Subsystem signalling flag in the PCO IE.
Specifically, the GGSN/P-GW may receive the IM CN Subsystem signalling flag in
the PCO IE in the PDP context activation or Secondary PDP context activation
for GERAN and UTRAN 59orrecti; in the Attach, UE-requested PDN connectivity
request or UE-requested bearer resource modification procedures for E-UTRAN
access. If the bearer establishment selected for the APN is controlled by the
network, depending on the operator policy, the GGSN or P-GW may also activate
a PDP context or dedicated EPS bearer for IMS signalling via network-initiated
Secondary PDP context activation or network-initiated Dedicated Bearer
activation procedures, respectively. If dedicated PDP contexts/EPS Bearers for
IMS signalling are not supported, the GGSN/P-GW will reset the signalling flag
in the response to the MS/UE. For P-GW, if the APN offers non-IMS services,
the default bearer shall not be allowed to be set up as a dedicated IM CN
signalling bearer. If the PDP context/EPS bearer can be established as a
dedicated bearer for IMS signalling, the GGSN/P-GW can provide a set of UL
filters for the PDP context/EPS bearer used for IMS. The UL filters provide
the MS/UE with the rules and restrictions applied by the GGSN/P-GW for the
dedicated PDP context/EPS bearer for IMS signalling. The GGSN/P-GW can in
addition provide the IMS signalling flag to explicitly indicate to the MS/UE
the intention of using the PDP context/EPS bearer for IMS related signalling.
In both cases, I and II,
\- The GGSN may receive the Signalling Indication parameter in the QoS IE.
This indicates a request for prioritised handling over the radio interface.
The GGSN shall be able to downgrade the QoS (dependent on operator policy) by
resetting the Signalling Indication according to the normal procedures for QoS
negotiation, see 3GPP TS 23.060 [3].
\- During the (default or dedicated) EPS bearer activation procedure, the P-GW
may receive the request for appropriate QCI for IMS signalling traffic as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [90] in EPS bearer QoS IE that indicates the
prioritised handling of the EPS bearer over the radio interface. The P-GW may
either accept or reject the request based on the operator policy configured at
the P-GW.
IM CN subsystem signalling flag and Signalling Indication or appropriate QCI
for IMS signalling in the QoS IE may be used independently of each other.
However, based on the operator policy, the network may honor the Signalling
Indication or appropriate QCI for IMS signalling if the IM CN Subsystem
signalling flag is present in PCO IE.
The operator may provide other properties to the PDP contexts/EPS bearers
dedicated for IMS signalling, e.g. special charging. It is out of the current
scope of this TS to further specify these properties.
For a PDP Context/EPS bearer marked as a dedicated for IMS signalling, the
GGSN/P-GW shall apply the applicable PCC rules, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212
[75], and/or locally preconfigured packet filters, which shall only allow
packets to be sent to and from a set of signalling servers, such as P-CSCF(s),
DHCP server(s) and DNS server(s). The TFT filters on the dedicated signalling
bearer shall have a precedence value so that they precede any other TFT
filters. This will secure the use of the correct PDP context/EPS bearer for
the signalling traffic, and that only authorized traffic uses the signalling
PDP context. The locally preconfigured packet filters shall be defined in the
GGSN/P-GW by the operator.
#### 13a.2.2.3 Creation of a PDP Context/EPS Bearer for IMS Media Flows
For PDP Contexts/EPS bearers used to carry IMS media flows, specific policies
may be applied. The policy includes packet filtering, which enables a specific
charging for these PDP Contexts/EPS bearers, see 3GPP TS 29.212 [75].
The creation of a PDP Context/EPS bearer to be used to carry media flows
involves interaction between the MS/UE and the GGSN/P-GW and between the
GGSN/P-GW and the PCRF. The interaction between the GGSN/P-GW and the PCRF,
i.e. the Gx interface, is described in detail in 3GPP TS 29.212 [75]. The
interaction between the MS/UE and GGSN/P-GW is described in 3GPP TS 29.213
[76].
If Gx is enabled for the APN, the GGSN/P-GW contacts the PCRF selected during
the establishment of the APN.
# 13b Interworking with BM-SC in EPS
## 13b.1 General
MBMS GW is used for interworking with the BM-SC in EPS. One or more MBMS GWs
may be used in a PLMN. The specific message, i.e. session start/session
update/session stop, and specific parameters, e.g. TMGI, MBMS service area,
list of MBMS control plane nodes, are handled.
MBMS GW provides the Sgi-mb (user plane) reference point and the SGmb (control
plane) reference point for interworking with the BM-SC.
## 13b.2 BM-SC interworking model of MBMS GW
The control plane and user plane protocol stacks of the MBMS GW for
interworking with BM-SC are illustrated in Figure 16j , Figure 16k and Figure
16l. The figures include the following protocols:
\- The \"Diameter\" SGmb application, as specified in clause 20.
\- The Control part of the Evolved GPRS Tunnelling Protocol for EPS, GTPv2-C,
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.274 [81].
\- The User Datagram Protocol,UDP, as specified in IETF RFC 768 [15].
\- The Transmission Control Protocol, TCP, as specified in IETF RFC 793 [18]
\- The Stream Control Transmission Protocol, SCTP, as specified in IETF RFC
4960 [109].
\- The Packet Data Convergence Protocol, PDCP, as specified in 3GPP TS 25.323
[107].
\- The MBMS synchronisation protocol, SYNC, as specified in 3GPP TS 25.446
[106].
\- The Internet Protocol, IP.
\- L1 and L2 transport protocols for IP (various options exist).
Figure 16j: The control plane protocol stacks of MBMS GW for interworking with
BM-SC
Figure 16k: The user plane protocol stacks of MBMS GW for interworking with
BM-SC for multicast
Figure 16l: The user plane protocol stacks of MBMS GW for interworking with
BM-SC for broadcast
A BM-SC sends user plane data to an MBMS GW either by IP unicast (default), or
by IP multicasting. Through the control plane communication a BM-SC provides
an MBMS GW with necessary data, so that MBMS GW could forward the user plane
data downlink either by multicast (default) or by unicast.
PDCP is not used when the MBMS service is broadcasted in the E-UTRAN, refer to
3GPP TS 36.331 [94].
## 13b.3 Forwarding of user plane packets at the MBMS GW
If user plane data are to be sent to the MBMS Gateway using IP unicast, the
MBMS Gateway allocates an IP transport address and a separate UDP port for
each MBMS bearer ( i.e the service uniquely identified by its TMGI and Flow ID
and provided by the EPS to deliver the same IP datagrams to multiple receivers
in a designated location). The MBMS Gateway uses that destination unicast IP
address and destination UDP port of user plane packets received over the SGi-
mb interface to determine on which MBMS bearer to forward the received user
plane packet.
If user plane data are to be sent to the MBMS Gateway using IP multicast
encapsulation, the MBMS Gateway uses, the SGi-mb (transport) plane destination
multicast address used and the SGi-mb (transport) plane source UDP port number
provided by the BM-SC of user plane packets received over the SGi-mb interface
to determine on which MBMS bearer to forward the received user plane packet.

# 15 Interworking between Packet Domains
The primary reason for the interworking between Packet Domains is to support
roaming subscribers as described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3]. The general model for
both GPRS and EPS Packet Domain interworking is shown in figure 21.
Figure 21: General interworking model for GPRS Packet Domains and EPS Packet
Domains to support roaming subscribers.
NOTE: There may be multiple Packet Domains of the same type which interwork
each other, such as the case of interwork between two GPRS Packet Domains.
For roaming subscribers that have a PDP address allocated from the HPLMN a
forwarding route between the HPLMN and the VPLMN is created. This route is
used for both mobile terminated and mobile originated data traffic. The
communication is done via the BGs (Border Gateways) as described in 3GPP TS
23.060 [3].
The procedures to set the link between the SGSN in the VPLMN and the GGSN in
the HPLMN are described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3].
The inter-PLMN link may be any packet data network or dedicated link as
described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3]. The PLMN operators may have a dedicated
inter-PLMN link to fulfil the QoS requirements of a certain protocol.
In the case of interworking between EPS Packet Domains, S8 reference point is
the inter-PLMN interface, linking PDN GW of HPLMN and Serving GW of VPLMN. The
procedure for setting the link is described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [77] and TS
23.402 [78].
## 15.1 Security Agreements
Each PLMN operator may support Ipsec (RFC 1825 [61]) and accompanying
specifications for authentication (RFC 1826 [62]) and encryption (RFC 1827
[63]) as a basic set of security functionality in its border gateways. The
PLMN operators may decide to use other security protocols based on bilateral
agreements.
## 15.2 Routing protocol agreements
Each PLMN operator may support BGP (RFC 1771 [60]) as a basic set of routing
functionality in its border gateways. The PLMN operators may decide to use
other routing protocols based on bilateral agreements.
## 15.3 Charging agreements
Sharing the cost of the inter-PLMN link is subject to the agreement between
the PLMN operators.
There may be a requirement to collect charging information in the Border
Gateway (see figure 21) and this is down to the normal interconnect agreement
between PLMN and PDN operators.
# 16 Usage of RADIUS on Gi/Sgi interface
A GGSN may, on a per APN basis, use RADIUS authentication to authenticate a
user and RADIUS accounting to provide information to an AAA (Authentication,
Authorization and Accounting) server.
## 16.1 RADIUS Authentication and Authorization
RADIUS Authentication and Authorization shall be used according to RFC 2865
[38], RFC 3162 [50] and RFC 4818 [97].
The RADIUS client function may reside in a GGSN/P-GW. When the GGSN receives a
Create PDP Context request message or the P-GW receives an initial access
request (e.g. Create Session Request) the RADIUS client function may send the
authentication information to an authentication server, which is identified
during the APN provisioning.
The authentication server checks that the user can be accepted. The response
(when positive) may contain network information, such as an Ipv4 address
and/or Ipv6 prefix for the user when the GGSN or P-GW is interworking with the
AAA server.
The information delivered during the RADIUS authentication can be used to
automatically correlate the users identity (the MSISDN or IMSI) to the Ipv4
address and/or Ipv6 prefix, if applicable, assigned/confirmed by the GGSN/P-GW
or the authentication server respectively. The same procedure applies, in case
of sending the authentication to a 'proxy' authentication server.
RADIUS Authentication is only applicable to the primary PDP context. When the
GGSN receives an Access-Accept message from the authentication server it shall
complete the PDP context activation procedure. If Access-Reject or no response
is received, the GGSN shall reject the PDP Context Activation attempt with a
suitable cause code, e.g. User Authentication failed. The GGSN may also use
the RADIUS re-authorization procedure for the purpose of Ipv4 address
allocation to the MS for PDP type of Ipv4v6 after establishment of a PDN
connection.
For EPS, RADIUS Authentication is applicable to the initial access request.
When the P-GW receives an Access-Accept message from the authentication server
it shall complete the initial access procedure. If Access-Reject or no
response is received, the P-GW shall reject the initial access procedure with
a suitable cause code. The P-GW may also use the RADIUS re-authorization
procedure for the purpose of Ipv4 address allocation to the UE for PDN type of
Ipv4v6 after establishment of a PDN connection. The use cases that may lead
this procedure are:
\- Deferred Ipv4 address allocation via DHCPv4 procedure after successful
attach on 3GPP accesses.
\- Deferred Ipv4 address allocation after successful attach in trusted
non-3GPP IP access on S2a.
\- Deferred Ipv4 home address allocation via DSMIPv6 Re-Registration procedure
via S2c.
## 16.2 RADIUS Accounting
RADIUS Accounting shall be used according to IETF RFC 2866 [39] , IETF RFC
2869 [116], IETF RFC 3162 [50] and IETF RFC 4818 [97].
The RADIUS accounting client function may reside in a GGSN/P-GW. The RADIUS
accounting client may send information to an accounting server, which is
identified during the APN provisioning. The accounting server may store this
information and use it to automatically identify the user. This information
can be trusted because the Packet Domain network has authenticated the
subscriber (i.e. SIM card and possibly other authentication methods).
The GGSN/P-GW may use the RADIUS Accounting-Request Start and Stop messages
during IP-CAN bearer (e.g. primary and secondary PDP context, default and
dedicated bearer) activations and deactivations procedures, respectively. For
EPC based Packet domain, if the P-GW is not aware of the IP-CAN bearers, e.g.
in case of PMIP-based S5/S8, the P-GW may use the RADIUS Accounting-Request
Start and Stop messages per IP-CAN session as it would be one IP-CAN bearer.
The use of Accounting-Request STOP and in addition the Accounting ON and
Accounting OFF messages may be used to ensure that information stored in the
accounting server is synchronised with the GGSN/P-GW information.
If the AAA server is used for Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix assignment,
then, upon reception of a RADIUS Accounting-Request STOP message for all IP-
CAN bearers associated to an IP-CAN session defined by APN and IMSI or MSISDN,
the AAA server may make the associated Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix
available for assignment.
For PDN/PDP type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 address allocation, when the Ipv4
address is allocated or re-allocated, the accounting session that was
established for the Ipv6 prefix allocation shall be used to inform the
accounting server about the allocated Ipv4 address by sending RADIUS
Accounting-Request Interim-Update with Framed-IP-Address attribute and its
value field containing the allocated Ipv4 address. Similarly, the release of
Ipv4 address shall be indicated to the accounting server by sending RADIUS
Accounting-Request Interim-Update without the Framed-IP-Address attribute.
In order to avoid race conditions, the GGSN/P-GW shall include a 3GPP Vendor-
Specific sub-attribute \"Session Stop indicator\" when it sends the
Accounting-Request STOP for the last IP-CAN bearer of an IP-CAN session and
the IP-CAN session is terminated (i.e. the Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix and
any associated GTP tunnels or PMIP tunnel can be released). The AAA server
shall not assume the IP-CAN session terminated until an Accounting-Request
STOP with the Session Stop indicator is received.
## 16.3 Authentication and accounting message flows on Gi interface
### 16.3.1 IP PDP type
Figure 22 represents the RADIUS message flows between a GGSN and an
Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server.
NOTE 1: If some external applications require RADIUS Accounting request
(Start) information before they can process user packets, then the selected
APN (GGSN) may be configured in such a way that the GGSN drops user data until
the Accounting Response (START) is received from the AAA server. The GGSN may
wait for the Accounting Response (START) before sending the
CreatePDPContextResponse. The GGSN may reject the PDP context if the
Accounting Response (START) is not received.
NOTE 2: Separate accounting and authentication servers may be used.
NOTE 3: The Access-Request message shall be used for primary PDP context only.
NOTE 4: The Accounting-Request (Start) message may be sent at a later stage,
e.g. after Ipv6 address has been assigned and PDP Context updated, in case of
IP address allocation via DHCPv4 after successful PDP context activation
signalling.
Figure 22: RADIUS message flow for PDP type IP (successful user authentication
case)
When a GGSN receives a Create PDP Context Request message for a given APN, the
GGSN may (depending on the configuration for this APN) send a RADIUS Access-
Request to an AAA server. The AAA server authenticates and authorizes the
user. If RADIUS is also responsible for Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix
allocation the AAA server shall return the allocated Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6
prefix in the Access-Accept message.
When PDP type is Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing via Ipv4 address pool in
the AAA server is used, the GGSN may intiate RADIUS re-authorization
procedures after successful initial attach for the purpose of Ipv4 address
allocation or to renew the lease for a previously allocated Ipv4 address. In
this case, the GGSN shall set the Service-Type attribute to \"Authorize Only\"
and the 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type subattribute to the type of IP address to be
allocated in the Access-Request message sent to the AAA server. See subclause
16.4.7.2 for the conditions to use 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type sub-attribute in
Access-Request messages. If the GGSN is using DHCPv4 signalling towards the MS
and the RADIUS server includes the Session-Timeout attribute in the Access-
Accept, the GGSN may use the Session-Timeout value as the DHCPv4 lease time.
The GGSN shall not set the DHCPv4 lease time value higher than the Session-
Timeout value. The GGSN may renew the DHCP lease to the MS without re-
authorization towards the AAA server providing that the new lease expiry is no
later than the Session-Timeout timer expiry. If the GGSN wishes to extend the
lease time beyond the current Session-Timeout expiry, it shall initiate a new
AAA re-authorization.
Even if the GGSN was not involved in user authentication (e.g. transparent
network access mode), it may send a RADIUS Accounting-Request START message to
an AAA server. This message contains parameters, e.g. the tuple which includes
the user-id and Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix, to be used by application
servers (e.g. WAP gateway) in order to identify the user. This message also
indicates to the AAA server that the user session has started. The session is
uniquely identified by the Acct-Session-Id that is composed of the Charging-Id
and the GGSN-Address.
If some external applications require RADIUS Accounting request (Start)
information before they can process user packets, then the selected APN (GGSN)
may be configured in such a way that the GGSN drops user data until the
Accounting Response (START) is received from the AAA server. The GGSN may wait
for the Accounting Response (START) before sending the
CreatePDPContextResponse. The GGSN may reject the PDP context if the
Accounting Response (START) is not received. The authentication and accounting
servers may be separately configured for each APN.
For PDP type Ipv4, at Ipv4 address allocation via DHCP4 signalling between the
TE and the PDN, no Ipv4 address is available at PDP context activation. In
that case the GGSN may wait to send the Accounting-Request START message until
the TE receives its Ipv4 address in a DHCPACK.
For PDP type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing, when the Ipv4 address is
allocated or re-allocated, the accounting session that was established for the
Ipv6 prefix allocation shall be used to inform the accounting server about the
allocated Ipv4 address by sending RADIUS Accounting-Request Interim-Update
with the Framed-IP-Address attribute and its value field containing the
allocated Ipv4 address.
When the GGSN receives a Delete PDP Context Request message and providing a
RADIUS Accounting-Request START message was sent previously, the GGSN shall
send a RADIUS Accounting-Request STOP message to the AAA server, which
indicates the termination of this particular user session. The GGSN shall
immediately send a Delete PDP context response, without waiting for an
Accounting-Response STOP message from the AAA server.
The AAA server shall deallocate the Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix (if any)
initially allocated to the subscriber, if there is no session for the
subscriber.
For PDP type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing, when the GGSN receives a
message from the MS or the network indicating the release of the Ipv4 address
(e.g. receiving DHCPRELEASE) or decides to release the Ipv4 address on its own
(e.g. due to DHCP lease timer expiry or GGSN assigned Ipv4 address), the GGSN
shall inform the accounting server about the deallocation of the Ipv4 address
by sending RADIUS Accounting-Request Interim-Update without the Framed-IP-
Address attribute.
Accounting-Request ON and Accounting-Request OFF messages may be sent from the
GGSN to the AAA server to ensure the correct synchronization of the session
information in the GGSN and the AAA server.
The GGSN may send an Accounting-Request ON message to the AAA server to
indicate that a restart has occurred. The AAA server may then release the
associated resources.
Prior to a scheduled restart, the GGSN may send Accounting-Request OFF message
to the AAA server. The AAA server may then release the associated resources.
If an Access-Challenge is sent to the GGSN when an Access-Request message is
pending and when IP PDP type is used, the GGSN shall silently discard the
Access-Challenge message and it shall treat an Access-Challenge as though it
had received an Access-Reject instead RFC 2865 [38].
### 16.3.2 PPP PDP type
Figure 23 describes the RADIUS message flows between a GGSN and an
Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server for the case where
PPP is terminated at the GGSN. The case where PPP is relayed to an LNS is
beyond the scope of the present document.
NOTE 1: Separate accounting and Authentication servers may be used.
NOTE 2: Actual messages depend on the used authentication protocol (e.g. PAP,
CHAP).
NOTE 3: If some external applications require RADIUS Accounting request
(Start) information before they can process user packets, then the selected
APN (GGSN) may be configured in such a way that the GGSN drops user data until
the Accounting Response (START) is received from the AAA server. The GGSN may
delete the PDP context if the Accounting Response (START) is not received.
NOTE 4: An LCP termination procedure may be performed. Either the MS or the
GGSN may initiate the context deactivation.
NOTE 5: The Access-Request message shall be used for primary PDP context only.
NOTE 6: Network Initiated deactivation.
NOTE 7: User Initiated deactivation.
Figure 23: RADIUS message flow for PDP type PPP (successful user
authentication case)
When a GGSN receives a Create PDP Context Request message for a given APN, the
GGSN shall immediately send a Create PDP context response back to the SGSN.
After PPP link setup, the authentication phase may take place. During
Authentication phase, the GGSN sends a RADIUS Access-Request to an AAA server.
The AAA server authenticates and authorizes the user. If RADIUS is also
responsible for IP address allocation the AAA server shall return the
allocated IP address or Ipv6 prefix in the Access-Accept message (if the user
was authenticated).
If the user is not authenticated, the GGSN shall send a Delete PDP context
request to the SGSN.
Even if the GGSN was not involved in user authentication (e.g. for PPP no
authentication may be selected), it may send a RADIUS Accounting-Request START
message to an AAA server. This message contains parameters, e.g. a tuple which
includes the user-id and IP address or Ipv6 prefix, to be used by application
servers (e.g. WAP gateway) in order to identify the user. This message also
indicates to the AAA server that the user session has started, and the QoS
parameters associated to the session.
If some external applications require RADIUS Accounting request (Start)
information before they can process user packets, then the selected APN (GGSN)
may be configured in such a way that the GGSN drops user data until the
Accounting Response (START) is received from the AAA server. The GGSN may
delete the PDP context if the Accounting Response (START) is not received. The
Authentication and Accounting servers may be separately configured for each
APN.
When the GGSN receives a Delete PDP Context Request message and providing a
RADIUS Accounting-Request START message was sent previously, the GGSN shall
send a RADIUS Accounting-Request STOP message to the AAA server, which
indicates the termination of this particular user session. The GGSN shall
immediately send a Delete PDP context response, without waiting for an
Accounting-Response STOP message from the AAA server.
The AAA server shall deallocate the IP address or Ipv6 prefix (if any)
initially allocated to the subscriber.
Accounting-Request ON and Accounting-Request OFF messages may be sent from the
GGSN to the AAA server to ensure the correct synchronization of the session
information in the GGSN and the AAA server.
The GGSN may send an Accounting-Request ON message to the AAA server to
indicate that a restart has occurred. The AAA server may then release the
associated resources.
Prior to a scheduled restart, the GGSN may send Accounting-Request OFF message
to the AAA server, the AAA server may then release the associated resources.
If an Access-Challenge is sent to the GGSN when using PPP PDP type, the GGSN
shall handle it by PPP CHAP providing PPP CHAP was the selected Authentication
protocol. If CHAP authentication was not selected, authentication shall fail
RFC 2865 [38].
### 16.3.3 Accounting Update
During the life of a PDP context some information related to this PDP context
may change (i.e. SGSN address if a Inter-SGSN RA update occurs). Upon
reception of an UpdatePDPContextRequest from the SGSN, the GGSN may send an
Accounting Request Interim-Update to the AAA server to update the necessary
information related to this PDP context (see figure 24). Interim updates are
also used when the Ipv4 address is allocated/released/re-allocated for
deferred Ipv4 addressing for the PDP type Ipv4v6. If the GGSN receives an
UpdatePDPContextRequest from the SGSN that specifically indicates a direct
tunnel establishment or a direct tunnel teardown (switching the user plane
tunnel end back to the SGSN), and only the GTP user plane address and/or the
GTP-U TEID have changed, then the GGSN should not send the Accounting Request
Interim-Update to the AAA server. In such cases, the GGSN need not wait for
the RADIUS AccountingResponse from the AAA server message before sending the
UpdatePDPContextResponse to the SGSN. The GGSN may delete the PDP context if
the AccountingResponse is not received from the AAA.
NOTE: As shown the GGSN need not wait for the RADIUS AccountingResponse from
the AAA server message to send the UpdatePDPContextResponse to the SGSN. The
GGSN may delete the PDP context if the AccountingResponse is not received from
the AAA.
Figure 24: RADIUS for PDP context Update
### 16.3.4 AAA-Initiated PDP context termination
RADIUS is used as the protocol between the GGSN and an AAA server or proxy for
applications (e.g. MMS) to deliver information related to GPRS user session.
However some IP applications could need to interwork with the GGSN to
terminate a particular PDP context. For this purpose, the AAA server or proxy
may send a RADIUS Disconnect Request to the GGSN. As depicted in figure 25,
the GGSN may react by deleting the corresponding PDP context or silently
discard the Disconnect Request message. For more information on RADIUS
Disconnect, see RFC 3576 [41]. If the GGSN deletes the corresponding PDP
context, it need not wait for the DeletePDPContextResponse from the SGSN
before sending the RADIUS DisconnectResponse to the AAA server.
The Teardown-Indicator in the RADIUS Disconnect Request message indicates to
the GGSN that all PDP contexts for this particular user and sharing the same
user session shall be deleted. The PDP contexts belong to the same IP-CAN
session are identified by the Acct-Session-Id. The Charging-Id contained in
the Acct-Session-Id can be of any PDP context of the user. The GGSN is able to
find out all the related PDP contexts sharing the same user session once it
has found the exact PDP context from the Acct-Session-Id. If a user has the
same user IP address for different sets of PDP contexts towards different
networks, only the PDP contexts linked to the one identified by the Acct-
Session-Id shall be deleted.
Since the Charging-Id contained in the Acct-Session-Id is already sufficient
to uniquely identify PDP context(s) for a user session on a GGSN, it has no
impact if the user IP address is not known by the GGSN (e.g. in the case of
transparent PPP IP-CAN sessions). In this case the user IP address in the
Disconnect message should be set to zero (e.g. 0.0.0.0 for Ipv4).
NOTE: As showed on figure 25, the GGSN need not wait for the
DeletePDPContextResponse from the SGSN to send the RADIUS DisconnectResponse
to the AAA server.
Figure 25: PDP Context deletion with RADIUS
## 16.3a Authentication and accounting message flows on Sgi interface
### 16.3a.1 Authentication, Authorization and Accounting procedures
When a P-GW receives an initial access request (e.g. Create Session Request or
Proxy Binding Update) message for a given APN, the P-GW may (depending on the
configuration for this APN) send a RADIUS Access-Request to an AAA server. The
AAA server authenticates and authorizes the user. If the RADIUS server is also
responsible for Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix allocation, the AAA server
shall return the allocated Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix in the Access-
Accept message.
When PDN type is Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing via Ipv4 address pool in
the AAA server is used, the P-GW may intiate RADIUS re-authorization
procedures after successful initial attach for the purpose of Ipv4 address
allocation or to renew the lease for a previously allocated Ipv4 address. In
this case, the P-GW shall set the Service-Type attribute to \"Authorize Only\"
and the 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type subattribute to the type of IP address to be
allocated in the Access-Request message sent to the AAA server. See subclause
16.4.7.2 for the conditions to use 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type sub-attribute in
Access-Request messages. If the P-GW is using DHCPv4 signalling towards the UE
and the RADIUS server includes the Session-Timeout attribute in the Access-
Accept, the P-GW may use the Session-Timeout value as the DHCPv4 lease time.
The P-GW shall not set the DHCPv4 lease time value higher than the Session-
Timeout value. The P-GW may renew the DHCP lease to the UE without re-
authorization towards the AAA server providing that the new lease expiry is no
later than the Session-Timeout timer expiry. If the P-GW wishes to extend the
lease time beyond the current Session-Timeout expiry, it shall initiate a new
AAA re-authorization.
Even if the P-GW was not involved in user authentication, it may send a RADIUS
Accounting-Request (START) message to an AAA server. This message may contain
parameters, e.g. the tuple which includes the user-id and Ipv4 address and/or
Ipv6 prefix, to be used by application servers (e.g. WAP gateway) in order to
identify the user. This message also indicates to the AAA server that the user
session has started. The session is uniquely identified by the Acct-Session-Id
that is composed of the Charging-Id and the PGW-Address.
If some external applications require RADIUS Accounting-Request (START)
information before they can process user packets, then the selected APN (P-GW)
may be configured in such a way that the P-GW drops user data until the
Accounting-Response (START) is received from the AAA server. The P-GW may wait
for the Accounting-Response (START) before sending the initial access response
(e.g. Create Session Response or Proxy Binding Acknowledgement). The P-GW may
reject the initial access request if the Accounting-Response (START) is not
received. The authentication and accounting servers may be separately
configured for each APN.
For PDN type Ipv4, at Ipv4 address allocation via DHCPv4 signalling between
the UE and the PDN, no Ipv4 address is available at initial access. In that
case the P-GW may wait to send the Accounting-Request (START) message until
the UE receives its Ipv4 address in a DHCPACK.
For PDN type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing, when the Ipv4 address is
allocated or re-allocated, the accounting session that was established for the
Ipv6 prefix allocation shall be used to inform the accounting server about the
allocated Ipv4 address by sending RADIUS Accounting-Request Interim-Update
with the Framed-IP-Address attribute and its value field containing the
allocated Ipv4 address.
When the P-GW receives a message indicating a bearer deactivation request or
PDN disconnection request or detach request (e.g. Delete Bearer Command or
Proxy Binding Update with lifetime equal 0) and providing a RADIUS Accounting-
Request (START) message was sent previously, the P-GW shall send a RADIUS
Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the AAA server, which indicates the
termination of this particular bearer or user session. The P-GW shall
immediately send the corresponding response (e.g. Delete Bearer Request or
Proxy Binding Ack with lifetime equal 0) to the peer node (e.g. S-GW) in the
Packet Domain, without waiting for an Accounting-Response (STOP) message from
the AAA server.
The AAA server shall deallocate the Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix initially
allocated to the subscriber, if there is no session for the subscriber.
For PDN type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing, when the P-GW receives a
message from the UE or the network indicating the release of the Ipv4 address
(e.g. receiving DHCPRELEASE) or decides to release the Ipv4 address on its own
(e.g. due to DHCP lease timer expiry or P-GW assigned Ipv4 address), the P-GW
shall inform the accounting server about the deallocation of the Ipv4 address
by sending RADIUS Accounting-Request Interim-Update without the Framed-IP-
Address attribute.
Accounting-Request (ON) and Accounting-Request (OFF) messages may be sent from
the P-GW to the AAA server to ensure the correct synchronization of the
session information in the P-GW and the AAA server.
The P-GW may send an Accounting-Request (ON) message to the AAA server to
indicate that a restart has occurred. The AAA server may then release the
associated resources.
Prior to a scheduled restart, the P-GW may send Accounting-Request (OFF)
message to the AAA server. The AAA server may then release the associated
resources.
If an Access-Challenge is sent to the P-GW when an Access-Request message is
pending, the P-GW shall silently discard the Access-Challenge message and it
shall treat an Access-Challenge as though it had received an Access-Reject
instead RFC 2865 [38].
For example, figure 25a.1 represents the RADIUS message flows between a P-GW
and an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server, which is
applicable for GTP based S5/S8:
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="4.6305555555555555in"}
NOTE 1: If some external applications require RADIUS Accounting request
(Start) information before they can process user packets, then the selected
APN (P-GW) may be configured in such a way that the P-GW drops user data until
the Accounting Response (START) is received from the AAA server. The P-GW may
wait for the Accounting Response (START) before sending the Create Session
Response. The P-GW may reject the bearer if the Accounting Response (START) is
not received.
NOTE 2: Separate accounting and authentication servers may be used.

### 16.3a.2 Accounting Update
During the life of an IP-CAN bearer some information related to this bearer
may change. Upon occurrence of the following events, the P-GW may send RADIUS
Accounting Request Interim-Update to the AAA server: RAT change, S-GW address
change and QoS change. Interim updates are also used when the Ipv4 address is
allocated/released/re-allocated for deferred Ipv4 addressing for the PDN type
Ipv4v6.
When the P-GW receives a signalling request (e.g. Modify Bearer Request in
case of GTP-based S5/S8) that indicates the occurrence of one of these
chargeable events, the P-GW may send an Accounting Request Interim-Update to
the AAA server to update the necessary information related to this bearer. The
P-GW need not wait for the RADIUS AccountingResponse message from the AAA
server before sending the response for the triggering signalling message (e.g.
Modify Bearer Response). The P-GW may delete the bearer if the
AccountingResponse is not received from the AAA.
The P-GW may also send interim updates at the expiry of an operator configured
time limit.
The following Figure 25a.2 is an example message flow to show the procedure of
RADIUS accounting update, which applicable for GTP based S5/S8:

### 16.3a.3 AAA-Initiated Bearer termination
RADIUS is used as the protocol between the P-GW and the AAA server or proxy
for applications (e.g. MMS) to deliver information related to EPS user
session. However some IP applications could need to interwork with the P-GW to
release the corresponding resource (e.g. terminate a particular bearer or
Resource Allocation Deactivation procedures as defined in TS 23.402 [78]). For
this purpose, the AAA server or proxy may send a RADIUS Disconnect Request to
the P-GW. On receipt of the Disconnect-Request from the AAA server, the P-GW
shall release the corresponding resources and reply with a Disconnect-ACK. If
the P-GW is unable to release the corresponding resources, it shall reply to
the AAA server with a Disconnect-NAK. For more information on RADIUS
Disconnect, see IETF RFC 3576 [41]. If the P-GW deletes the corresponding
bearer, it need not wait for the response from the S-GW or non-3GPP IP access
or ePDG before sending the RADIUS DisconnectResponse to the AAA server.
The Teardown-Indicator in the RADIUS Disconnect Request message indicates to
the P-GW that all IP-CAN bearers for this particular user and sharing the same
user session shall be deleted. The IP-CAN bearers that belong to the same IP-
CAN session are identified by the Acct-Session-Id. The Charging-Id contained
in the Acct-Session-Id can be of any IP-CAN bearer of the user. The P-GW is
able to find out all the related IP-CAN bearers sharing the same user session
once it has found the exact IP-CAN bearer from the Acct-Session-Id. If a user
has the same user IP address for different sets of IP-CAN bearers towards
different networks, only the IP-CAN bearers linked to the one identified by
the Acct-Session-Id shall be deleted. If the value of Teardown-Indicator is
set to \"0\" or if TI is missing, and if the Acct-Session-Id identifies the
default bearer, the P-GW shall tear-down all the IP-CAN bearers that share the
same user session identified by the Acct-Session-Id.
The following Figure 25a.3 is an example message flow to show the procedure of
RADIUS AAA-Initiated Bearer termination, which applicable for GTP based S5/S8:
NOTE: As shown on figure 25a.3, the P-GW need not wait for the Delete Bearer
Response from the S-GW to send the RADIUS DisconnectResponse to the AAA
server.

## 16.4 List of RADIUS attributes
The following tables describe the actual content of the RADIUS messages
exchanged between the GGSN/P-GW and the AAA server. Other RADIUS attributes
may be used as defined in RADIUS RFC(s). Unless otherwise stated, when the
encoding scheme of an attribute is specified as UTF-8 encoding, this shall be
interpreted as UTF-8 hexadecimal encoding.
NOTE: Any digit is converted into UTF-8 character. For example, digit 5 is
converted to UTF-8 character '5', which in hexadecimal representation has a
value 0x35. Similarly, a hexadecimal digit F is converted to either UTF-8
character 'F', which in hexadecimal representation has a value 0x46, or to
UTF-8 character 'f', which in hexadecimal representation has a value 0x66.
### 16.4.1 Access-Request message (sent from GGSN/P-GW to AAA server)

The information represented by some of the Sgi sub-attributes may not be
available to the P-GW depending on the UE's radio access and the S5/S8
protocol type (GTP or PMIP). For example, the P-GW will be aware of the User
Location Info (e.g. TAI) if the user is in LTE access and GTP based S5/S8 is
used. However, such information is not passed to the P-GW when PMIP based
S5/S8 is utilised. In such scenarios, if a sub-attribute is configured in the
P-GW to be transferred to the RADIUS AAA server, but the information in the
P-GW is not up to date or not available; the P-GW shall not send the
corresponding sub-attribute, unless otherwise stated in the following
subclause where the encoding of each sub-attribute is specified.
#### 16.4.7.2 Coding 3GPP Vendor-Specific RADIUS attributes
In this subclause the provisions of IETF RFC 2865 [38] apply, which in
particular specify the following:
\- the Length field of an attribute is one octet, and it indicates the length
of this Attribute including the Type, Length and Value fields.
\- type String may be 1-253 octets long and it contains binary data (values 0
through 255 decimal, inclusive). Strings of length zero (0) shall not be sent,
but the entire attribute shall be omitted. A NULL terminating character shall
not be appended to an attribute of type String.
\- type Text may be 1-253 octets long and it contains UTF-8 encoded
characters. Text of length zero (0) shall not be sent, but the entire
attribute shall be omitted. A NULL terminating character shall not be appended
to an attribute of type Text.
\- type Address is 32 bit value and most significant octet is the first one.
\- type Integer is 32 bit unsigned value and most significant octet is the
first one.
The RADIUS vendor Attribute is encoded as follows (as per IETF RFC 2865 [38])
* * *
              Bits
Octets 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 Type = 26

A GGSN (or a P-GW) receives IMSI that is encoded according to 3GPP TS 29.060
[24] (or 3GPP TS 29.274 [81]) and converts IMSI into the UTF-8 characters,
which are encoded as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [40]. There shall be no padding
characters between the MCC and MNC, and between the MNC and MSIN. If the IMSI
is less than 15 digits, the padding in the GTP information element shall be
removed by the GGSN (or the P-GW) and not encoded in this sub-attribute.

5 = Unstructured
6 = Ethernet
For P-GW, this sub-attribute represents PDN Type and therefore only the values
\"0\", \"2\", \"3\" and \"4\" are applicable.
The value 5 Unstructured and 6 Ethernet of PDP type does not apply for the
present specification. For specifications referencing the present RADIUS VSA,
those values shall only apply if it is explicitely endorsed within the
referencing specification.

5) or L â‰¤ 27 (release 4 or release 99) or L = 11 (release 98). For P-GW, the
length varies depending on the value of QCI. See below for details.
QoS profile value: Text type
UTF-8 encoded QoS profile syntax:
\"\ \-- \\"
\ = UTF-8 encoded number (two characters) :
For GGSN:
\"98\" = Release 98
\"99\"= Release 99 or release 4
\"05\"= Release 5 or release 6
\"07\"= Release 7 or higher
For P-GW:
\"08\"= Release 8 or higher
For SMF:
\"15\"= Release 15 or higher
\ = UTF-8 encoded QoS profile for
the release indicated by the release indicator.
The UTF-8 encoding of a QoS IE is defined as follows: each octet is described
by 2 UTF-8 encoded characters, defining its hexadecimal representation.
For GGSN:
The QoS profile definition is in 3GPP TS 24.008 [54].
The release 98 QoS profile data is 3 octets long, which then results in a 6
octets UTF-8 encoded string.
The release 99 and release 4 QoS profile data is 11 octets long, which results
in a 22 octets UTF-8 encoded string.
The release 5 and release 6 QoS profile data is 14 octets long, which results
in a 28 octets UTF-8 encoded string.
The release 7 (and higher) QoS profile data is 16 octets long, which results
in a 32 octets UTF-8 encoded string.
For P-GW:
It contains the following QoS parameters associated with the EPS bearer:
\- QCI
\- ARP
\- GBR QoS information (UL/DL MBR, UL/DL GBR) or UL/DL APN-AMBR. In other
words if the value of QCI indicates a GBR bearer, the GBR QoS information
shall be present. If the value of QCI indicates a non-GBR bearer, the APN-AMBR
information shall be present.
The encoding of the EPS bearer QoS profile parameters is specified in 3GPP TS
29.274 [81]: ARP is specified in Bearer QoS IE; QCI, UL MBR, DL MBR, UL MBR
and DL MBR are specified in Flow QoS IE; UL APN-AMBR and DL APN-AMBR are
specified in AMBR IE.
For GBR QCIs, the encoding of UTF-8 encoded QoS Profile field shall be as
follows:
* * *
1-2 \ = \" 08\" (UTF-8 encoded) 3 \"-\" (UTF-8 encoded) 4-5
ARP (UTF-8 encoded) 6-7 QCI (UTF-8 encoded) 8-m UL MBR (UTF-8 encoded) (m+1)-n
DL MBR (UTF-8 encoded) (n+1)-o UL GBR (UTF-8 encoded) (o+1)-p DL GBR (UTF-8
encoded)
* * *
For non-GBR QCIs, the UL/DL MBR and UL/DL GBR fields shall not be present; UL
APN-AMBR and DL APN-AMBR fields shall be encoded (in UTF-8 encoded format)
respectively after the QCI field.
For SMF:
It contains the following QoS parameters associated with the QoS flow:
\- 5QI
\- ARP
\- GBR QoS information (UL/DL MFBR, UL/DL GFBR) or UL/DL Session-AMBR. In
other words if the value of 5QI indicates a GBR QoS flow, the GBR QoS
information shall be present. If the value of 5QI indicates a non-GBR QoS
flow, the Session-AMBR information shall be present.
5QI value range is 0-255. ARP shall be encoded as Allocation/Retention
Priority IE defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [81]. The UTF-8 encoded UL/DL MFBR,
UL/DL GFBR and UL/DL Session-AMBR has the following pattern:
> \'\^\d+(\\.\d+)? (bps\|Kbps\|Mbps\|Gbps\|Tbps)\$\'
>
> Examples:
>
> \"125 Mbps\", \"0.125 Gbps\", \"125000 Kbps\"
For GBR 5QIs, the encoding of UTF-8 encoded QoS Profile field shall be as
follows:
* * *
1-2 \ = \"15\" (UTF-8 encoded) 3 \"-\" (UTF-8 encoded) 4-5
ARP (UTF-8 encoded) 6-7 5QI (UTF-8 encoded) 8-9 UL MFBR length (UTF-8 encoded)

(m+3)-n DL MFBR (UTF-8 encoded) (n+1)-(n+2) UL GFBR length (UTF-8 encoded)
(n+3)-o UL GFBR (UTF-8 encoded) (o+1)-(o+2) UL GFBR length (UTF-8 encoded)
(o+3)-p DL GFBR (UTF-8 encoded)
* * *
For non-GBR 5QIs, the encoding of UTF-8 encoded QoS Profile field shall be as
follows:
* * *
1-2 \\- = \"15\" (UTF-8 encoded) 3 \"-\" (UTF-8 encoded)
4-5 ARP (UTF-8 encoded) 6-7 5QI (UTF-8 encoded) 8-9 UL Session-AMBR length
(UTF-8 encoded) 10-m UL Session-AMBR (UTF-8 encoded) (m+1)-(m+2) DL Session-
AMBR length (UTF-8 encoded) (m+3)-n DL Session-AMBR (UTF-8 encoded)
* * *
The above structures for encoding the QoS profile of Release indicator \"15\"
do not apply for the present specification. For specifications referencing the
present VSA, those formats shall only apply if it is explicitely endorsed
within the referencing specification.

If multiple Access-Request signalling towards a AAA server is needed during
the lifetime of a PDN connection (e.g. for PDN/PDP type Ipv4v6 and deferred
Ipv4 addressing), this sub-attribute shall be included in the Access-Request
message to indicate how the AAA server needs to treat the request. The
P-GW/GGSN may also use this sub-attribute if the AAA server is configured to
allocate both Ipv4 address and Ipv6 prefix but the P-GW/GGSN requires
assignment of only one IP type or both IP types (e.g. because the UE supports
single IP stack and it has requested PDN/PDP type of Ipv4 or Ipv6).
If this sub-attribute does not exist in Access-Request from P-GW/GGSN to the
AAA server, the IP address allocation shall be based on the IP address
allocation policy configured in the the AAA server.
IP Type field: It is encoded in Octet String type and the following decimal
equivalent values apply:
0 Do not allocate Ipv4 address or Ipv6 prefix.\ The typical use case is for
PDN/PDP type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing and only Ipv4 address is
allocated by the AAA 103orrec but Ipv6 prefix is allocated by some other
means, e.g. local pool in the P-GW/GGSN. The Access-Request from the P-GW/GGSN
to the AAA server during the UE's initial access to the network shall set the
value of this sub-attribute to 0.
1 Allocate Ipv4 address\ The typical use case is for PDN/PDP type Ipv4v6 and
deferred Ipv4 addressing and the Ipv4 address (and/or Ipv6 prefix) is
allocated by the AAA server. The Access-Request from the P-GW/GGSN to the AAA
server when the P-GW/GGSN receives UE-initiated Ipv4 address allocation
signalling (e.g. DHCPv4) after UE's successful initial access to the PDN shall
set the value of this attribute to 1. In this case, if the AAA server had
allocated an Ipv6 prefix earlier during UE's initial access to the network,
same Ipv6 prefix shall be kept allocated.
2 Allocate Ipv6 prefix\ The typical use case is for PDN/PDP type Ipv4v6 and
deferred Ipv4 addressing and both Ipv4 address and Ipv6 prefix are allocated
by the AAA server. The Access-Request from the P-GW/GGSN to the AAA server
during the UE's initial access to the network shall set the value of this sub-

3 Allocate Ipv4 address and Ipv6 prefix\ Currently there is no use case
identified to use this specific value for PDN/PDP tpe Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4
addressing. One potential use case is for PDN/PDP type Ipv4v6 and non-deferred
Ipv4 addressing and both Ipv4 address and Ipv6 prefix are allocated by the AAA
server. The Accesss-Request from the P-GW/GGSN to the AAA server may use this

# 16a Usage of Diameter on Gi/Sgi interface
As an operator option, it is also possible to use the Diameter protocol in
order to provide Authentication, Authorization and Accounting services.
A GGSN/P-GW may, on a per APN basis, use Diameter authentication to
authenticate a user and Diameter accounting to provide information to a
Diameter server.
## 16a.1 Diameter Authentication and Authorization
Diameter Authentication and Authorization shall be used according to RFC 4005
[67].
The GGSN/P-GW and the Diameter server shall advertise the support of the
Diameter NASREQ Application by including the value of the appropriate
application identifier in the Capability-Exchange-Request and Capability-
Exchange-Answer commands as specified in IETF RFC 6733 [111].
The Diameter client function may reside in a GGSN/P-GW. When the GGSN/P-GW
receives an initial attach (e.g. Create PDP Context) request message the
Diameter client function may send the authentication information to an
authentication server, which is identified during the APN provisioning.
The authentication server checks that the user can be accepted. The response
(when positive) may contain network information, such as an Ipv4 address
and/or Ipv6 prefix for the user when the GGSN/P-GW is interworking with the
AAA server.
The information delivered during the Diameter authentication can be used to
automatically correlate the users identity (the MSISDN or IMSI) to the Ipv4
address and/or Ipv6 prefix, if applicable, assigned/confirmed by the GGSN/P-GW
or the authentication server respectively. The same procedure applies, in case
of sending the authentication to a 'proxy' authentication server.
Diameter Authentication is applicable to the initial access (e.g. primary PDP
context or the default bearer). When the GGSN/P-GW receives a positive
response from the authentication server it shall complete the initial access
(e.g. PDP context activation) procedure. If a failure or no response is
received, the GGSN/P-GW shall reject the initial access (e.g. PDP Context
Activation) attempt with a suitable cause code, e.g. User Authentication
failed.
The GGSN may also use the Diameter re-authorization procedure for the purpose
of Ipv4 address allocation to the UE for PDP type of Ipv4v6 after
establishment of a PDN connection.
For EPS, the P-GW may also use the Diameter re-authorization procedure for the
purpose of Ipv4 address allocation to the UE for PDN type of Ipv4v6 after
establishment of a PDN connection. The use cases that may lead this procedure
are:
\- Deferred Ipv4 address allocation via DHCPv4 procedure after successful
attach on 3GPP accesses.
\- Deferred Ipv4 address allocation after successful attach in trusted
non-3GPP IP access on S2a.
\- Deferred Ipv4 home address allocation via DSMIPv6 Re-Registration procedure
via S2c.
## 16a.2 Diameter Accounting
Diameter Accounting shall be used according to RFC 4005 [67].
The Diameter accounting client function may reside in a GGSN/P-GW. The
Diameter accounting client may send information to an accounting server, which
is identified during the APN provisioning. The accounting server may store
this information and use it to automatically identify the user. This
information can be trusted because the PS access network has authenticated the
subscriber (i.e. SIM card and possibly other authentication methods).
Diameter Accounting messages may be used during both primary and secondary PDP
context activation for non-EPC based packet domain (both the default bearer
and dedicated bearer for the EPC based packet domain) and deactivation
procedures respectively.
If the AAA server is used for Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix assignment,
then, upon reception of a Diameter Accounting-Request STOP message for all IP-
CAN bearers associated to an IP-CAN session defined by APN and IMSI or MSISDN,
the AAA server may make the associated Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix
available for assignment.
For PDN/PDP type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 address allocation, when the Ipv4
address is allocated or re-allocated, the accounting session that was
established for the Ipv6 prefix allocation shall be used to inform the
accounting server about the allocated Ipv4 address by sending Diameter
Accounting-Request Interim-Update with Framed-IP-Address AVP and its value
field containing the allocated Ipv4 address. Similarly, the release of Ipv4
address shall be indicated to the accounting server by sending Diameter
Accounting-Request Interim-Update without the Framed-IP-Address AVP.
## 16a.3 Authentication and accounting message flows on Gi interface
### 16a.3.1 IP PDP type
Figure 25a represents the Diameter message flows between a GGSN and a Diameter
server.
NOTE 1: If some external applications require Diameter Accounting request
(Start) information before they can process user packets, then the selected
APN (GGSN) may be configured in such a way that the GGSN drops user data until
the Accounting Answer (START) is received from the Diameter server. The GGSN
may wait for the Accounting Answer (START) before sending the
CreatePDPContextResponse. The GGSN may reject the PDP context if the
Accounting Answer (START) is not received.
NOTE 2: Separate accounting and authentication servers may be used.
NOTE 3: The AA-Request message shall be used for primary PDP context only.
NOTE 4: The Accounting-Request (Start) message may be sent at a later stage,
e.g. after Ipv4 address has been assigned and PDP Context updated, in case of
IP address allocation via DHCPv4 after successful PDP context activation
signalling.
Figure 25a: Diameter message flow for PDP type IP (successful user
authentication case)
When a GGSN receives a Create PDP Context Request message for a given APN, the
GGSN may (depending on the configuration for this APN) send a Diameter AA-
Request to a Diameter server. The Diameter server authenticates and authorizes
the user. If Diameter is also responsible for Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix
allocation the Diameter server shall return the allocated Ipv4 address and/or
Ipv6 prefix in the AA-Answer message. The AA-Request and AA-Answer messages
are only used for the primary PDP context.
When PDP type is Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing via Ipv4 address pool in
the AAA server is used, the GGSN may intiate Diameter re-authorization
procedures after successful initial attach for the purpose of Ipv4 address
allocation or to renew the lease for a previously allocated Ipv4 address. In
this case, the GGSN shall set the Session-Id to the value used in the initial
access request, the Auth-Request-Type AVP to \"AUTHORIZE_ONLY\" and the 3GPP-
Allocate-IP-Type AVP to the type of IP address to be allocated in the AA-
Request message sent to the AAA server. See subclause 16.4.7.2 for the
conditions to use 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type AVP in AA-Request messages. If the
GGSN is using DHCPv4 signalling towards the MS and the Diameter server
includes the Session-Timeout attribute in the Access-Accept, the GGSN may use
the Session-Timeout value as the DHCP lease time. The GGSN shall not set the
DHCPv4 lease time value higher than the Session-Timeout value. The GGSN may
renew the DHCP lease to the MS without re-authorization towards the AAA server
providing that the new lease expiry is no later than the Session-Timeout timer
expiry. If the GGSN wishes to extend the lease time beyond the current
Session-Timeout expiry, it shall initiate a new AAA re-authorization.
Even if the GGSN was not involved in user authentication (e.g. transparent
network access mode), it may send a Diameter Accounting-Request (START)
message to a Diameter server. If no Diameter session is already open for the
user a Diameter session needs to be activated, otherwise the existing Diameter
session is used to send the Accounting-Request (START). The NSAPI will
identify the particular PDP context this accounting refers to. The Accounting-
Request message also indicates to the Diameter server that the user session
has started. This message contains parameters, e.g. the tuple which includes
the user-id, Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix, and the MSISDN to be used by
application servers (e.g. WAP gateway) in order to identify the user.
If some external applications require Diameter Accounting request (Start)
information before they can process user packets, then the selected APN (GGSN)
may be configured in such a way that the GGSN drops user data until the
Accounting Answer (START) is received from the Diameter server. The GGSN may
wait for the Accounting Answer (START) before sending the
CreatePDPContextResponse. The GGSN may reject the PDP context if the
Accounting Answer (START) is not received. The authentication and accounting
servers may be separately configured for each APN.
For PDP type Ipv4, at Ipv4 address allocation via DHCP4 signalling between the
TE and the PDN, no Ipv4 address is available at PDP context activation. In
that case the GGSN may wait to send the Accounting-Request (START) message
until the TE receives its IP address in a DHCPACK.
For PDP type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing, when the Ipv4 address is
allocated or re-allocated, the accounting session that was established for the
Ipv6 prefix allocation shall be used to inform the accounting server about the
allocated Ipv4 address by sending Diameter Accounting-Request Interim-Update
with the Framed-IP-Address AVP and its value field containing the allocated
Ipv4 address.
When the GGSN receives a Delete PDP Context Request message and providing a
Diameter Accounting-Request (START) message was sent previously, the GGSN
shall send a Diameter Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the Diameter
server, which indicates the termination of this particular user accounting
session. The NSAPI will identify the particular PDP context this accounting
refers to. The GGSN shall immediately send a Delete PDP context response,
without waiting for an Accounting-Answer (STOP) message from the Diameter
server.
If this was the last PDP context for that PDP address, the GGSN shall
additionally send an STR message to the Diameter server. The Diameter server
shall reply with an STA and shall deallocate the IP address or Ipv6 prefix (if
any) initially allocated to the subscriber.
For PDP type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing, when the GGSN receives a
message from the MS or the network indicating the release of the Ipv4 address
(e.g. receiving DHCPRELEASE) or decides to release the Ipv4 address on its own
(e.g. due to DHCP lease timer expiry for GGSN assigned Ipv4 address), the GGSN
shall inform the accounting server about the deallocation of the Ipv4 address
by sending Diameter Accounting-Request Interim-Update without the Framed-IP-
Address AVP.
### 16a.3.2 PPP PDP type
Figure 25b describes the Diameter message flows between a GGSN and a Diameter
server for the case where PPP is terminated at the GGSN. The case where PPP is
relayed to an LNS is beyond the scope of the present document.
NOTE 1: Separate accounting and Authentication servers may be used.
NOTE 2: Actual messages depend on the used authentication protocol (e.g. PAP,
CHAP).
NOTE 3: If some external applications require Diameter Accounting request
(Start) information before they can process user packets, then the selected
APN (GGSN) may be configured in such a way that the GGSN drops user data until
the Accounting Answer (START) is received from the AAA server. The GGSN may
delete the PDP context if the Accounting Response (START) is not received.
NOTE 4: An LCP termination procedure may be performed. Either the MS or the
GGSN may initiate the context deactivation.
NOTE 5: The AA-Request message shall be used for primary PDP context only.
NOTE 6: Network Initiated deactivation.
NOTE 7: User Initiated deactivation.
Figure 25b: Diameter message flow for PDP type PPP (successful user
authentication case)
When a GGSN receives a Create PDP Context Request message for a given APN, the
GGSN shall immediately send a Create PDP context response back to the SGSN.
After PPP link setup, the authentication phase may take place. During
Authentication phase, the GGSN sends a Diameter AA-Request to a Diameter
server. The Diameter server authenticates and authorizes the user. If Diameter
is also responsible for IP address allocation the Diameter server shall return
the allocated IP address or Ipv6 prefix in the AA-answer message (if the user
was authenticated).
If the user is not authenticated, the GGSN shall send a Delete PDP context
request to the SGSN. The AA-Request and AA-Answer messages are only used for
the primary PDP context.
Even if the GGSN was not involved in user authentication (e.g. for PPP no
authentication may be selected), it may send a Diameter Accounting-Request
(START) message to a Diameter server. If no Diameter session is already open
for the user a Diameter session needs to be activated, otherwise the existing
Diameter session is used to send the Accounting-Request (START). The NSAPI
will identify the particular PDP context this accounting refers to. The
Accounting-Request message also indicates to the Diameter server that the user
session has started, and the QoS parameters associated to the session. This
message contains parameters, e.g. a tuple which includes the user-id, IP
address or Ipv6 prefix, and the MSISDN to be used by application servers (e.g.
WAP gateway) in order to identify the user.
If some external applications require Diameter Accounting request (Start)
information before they can process user packets, then the selected APN (GGSN)
may be configured in such a way that the GGSN drops user data until the
Accounting Answer (START) is received from the Diameter server. The GGSN may
delete the PDP context if the Accounting Answer (START) is not received. The
Authentication and Accounting servers may be separately configured for each
APN.
When the GGSN receives a Delete PDP Context Request message and providing a
Diameter Accounting-Request (START) message was sent previously, the GGSN
shall send a Diameter Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the Diameter
server, which indicates the termination of this particular user session. The
NSAPI will identify the particular PDP context this accounting refers to. The
GGSN shall immediately send a Delete PDP context response, without waiting for
an Accounting-Answer (STOP) message from the Diameter server.
If this was the last PDP context for that PDP address, the GGSN shall
additionally send an STR message to the Diameter server. The Diameter server
shall reply with an STA and shall deallocate the IP address or Ipv6 prefix (if
any) initially allocated to the subscriber.
### 16a.3.3 Accounting Update
During the life of a PDP context some information related to this PDP context
may change (i.e. SGSN address if an Inter-SGSN RA update occurs). Upon
reception of an UpdatePDPContextRequest from the SGSN, the GGSN may send an
Accounting Request (Interim) to the Diameter server to update the necessary
information related to this PDP context (see figure 25c). Interim updates are
also used when the Ipv4 address is allocated/released/re-allocated for
deferred Ipv4 addressing for the PDP type Ipv4v6.
If the GGSN receives an UpdatePDPContextRequest from the SGSN that
specifically indicates a direct tunnel establishment or a direct tunnel
teardown (switching the user plane tunnel end back to the SGSN), and only the
GTP user plane address or the GTP-U TEID have changed, then the GGSN should
not send the Accounting Request (Interim) message to the Diameter server. In
such cases, the GGSN need not wait for the Diameter Accounting Answer from the
Diameter server message before sending the UpdatePDPContextResponse to the
SGSN. The GGSN may delete the PDP context if the Accounting Answer is not
received from the Diameter server.
NOTE: As shown the GGSN need not wait for the Diameter Accounting Answer
message from the Diameter server to send the UpdatePDPContextResponse to the
SGSN. The GGSN may delete the PDP context if the Accounting Answer is not
received from the Diameter server.
Figure 25c: Diameter for PDP context Update
### 16a.3.4 Server-Initiated PDP context termination
Diameter is used as the protocol between the GGSN and a Diameter server or
proxy for applications (e.g. MMS) to deliver information related to GPRS user
session. However some IP applications could need to interwork with the GGSN to
terminate a particular PDP context. For this purpose, the Diameter server or
proxy may send a Diameter ASR to the GGSN along with the NSAPI necessary to
identify the particular PDP context to be terminated. As depicted in figure
25d, the GGSN should react by deleting the corresponding PDP context. If the
GGSN deletes the corresponding PDP context, it need not wait for the
DeletePDPContextResponse from the SGSN before sending the ASA to the server.
The absence of the NSAPI in the Diameter ASR message indicates to the GGSN
that all PDP contexts for this particular user and sharing the same user
session shall be deleted. The PDP contexts belonging to the same IP-CAN
session are identified by the Diameter Session-Id. If a user has the same user
IP address for different sets of PDP contexts towards different networks, only
the PDP contexts linked to the one identified by the Diameter Session-Id shall
be deleted.
NOTE: As showed on figure 25d, the GGSN need not wait for the
DeletePDPContextResponse from the SGSN to send the ASA to the Diameter server.
Figure 25d: PDP Context deletion with Diameter
## 16a.3a Authentication and accounting message flows on Sgi interface
### 16a.3a.1 Authentication, Authorization and Accounting procedures
When a P-GW receives an initial access request (e.g.Create Session Request or
Proxy Binding Update) message for a given APN, the P-GW may (depending on the
configuration for this APN) send a Diameter AA-Request to a Diameter server.
The Diameter server authenticates and authorizes the user. If the Diameter
server is also responsible for Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix allocation the
Diameter server shall return the allocated Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix in
the AA-Answer message.
When PDN type is Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing via Ipv4 address pool in
the AAA server is used, the P-GW may intiate Diameter re-authorization
procedures after successful initial attach for the purpose of Ipv4 address
allocation or to renew the lease for a previously allocated Ipv4 address. In
this case, the P-GW shall set the Session-Id to the value used in the initial
access request, the Auth-Request-Type AVP to \"AUTHORIZE_ONLY\" and the 3GPP-
Allocate-IP-Type AVP to the type of IP address to be allocated in the AA-
Request message sent to the AAA server. See subclause 16.4.7.2 for the
conditions to use 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type AVP in AA-Request messages. If the
P-GW is using DHCPv4 signalling towards the UE and the Diameter server
includes the Session-Timeout attribute in the Access-Accept, the P-GW may use
the Session-Timeout value as the DHCP lease time. The P-GW shall not set the
DHCPv4 lease time value higher than the Session-Timeout value. The P-GW may
renew the DHCP lease to the UE without re-authorization towards the AAA server
providing that the new lease expiry is no later than the Session-Timeout timer
expiry. If the P-GW wishes to extend the lease time beyond the current
Session-Timeout expiry, it shall initiate a new AAA re-authorization.
Even if the P-GW was not involved in user authentication, it may send a
Diameter Accounting-Request (START) message to a Diameter server. If no
Diameter session is already open for the same PDN connection a Diameter
session needs to be activated, otherwise the existing Diameter session is used
to send the Accounting-Request (START). For GTP-based S5/S8/S2a/S2b, if
accounting is used per IP-CAN bearer, the EPS bearer ID will identify the
particular bearer this accounting message refers to. The Accounting-Request
message also indicates to the Diameter server that the user session has
started.This message contains parameters, e.g. the tuple which includes the
user-id and Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix, to be used by application servers
(e.g. WAP gateway) in order to identify the user. This message also indicates
to the Diameter server that the user session has started.
If some external applications require Diameter Accounting Request (START)
information before they can process user packets, then the selected APN (P-GW)
may be configured in such a way that the P-GW drops user data until an
Accounting-Answer (START) indicating success is received from the Diameter
server. The P-GW may wait for the Accounting-Answer (START) before sending the
initial access response (e.g. Create Session Response or Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement). The P-GW may reject the initial access request if the
Accounting-Answer (START) is not received. The authentication and accounting
servers may be separately configured for each APN.
For PDN type Ipv4, at Ipv4 address allocation via DHCPv4 signalling between
the UE and the PDN, no Ipv4 address is available at initial access. In that
case the P-GW may wait to send the Accounting-Request START message until the
UE receives its Ipv4 address in a DHCPACK.
For PDN type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing, when the Ipv4 address is
allocated or re-allocated, the accounting session that was established for the
Ipv6 prefix allocation shall be used to inform the accounting server about the
allocated Ipv4 address by sending Diameter Accounting-Request Interim-Update
with the Framed-IP-Address AVP and its value field containing the allocated
Ipv4 address.
When the P-GW receives a message indicating a bearer deactivation request or
PDN disconnection request or detach request (e.g. Delete Bearer Command or
Proxy Binding Update with lifetime equal 0) and providing a Diameter
Accounting-Request START message was sent previously, the P-GW shall send a
Diameter Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the Diameter server, which
indicates the termination of this particular bearer or user session. The P-GW
shall immediately send the corresponding response (e.g. Delete Bearer Request
or Proxy Binding Ack with lifetime equal 0) to the peer node (e.g. S-GW) in
the Packet Domain, without waiting for an Accounting-Answer (STOP) message
from the Diameter server.
If the last bearer of an IP-CAN session is deactivated, the P-GW shall
additionally send an STR message to the Diameter server. The Diameter server
shall reply with an STA and shall deallocate the Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6
prefix (if any) initially allocated to the subscriber.
For PDN type Ipv4v6 and deferred Ipv4 addressing, when the P-GW receives a
message from the UE or the network indicating the release of the Ipv4 address
(e.g. receiving DHCPRELEASE) or decides to release the Ipv4 address on its own
(e.g. due to DHCP lease timer expiry for P-GW assigned Ipv4 address), the P-GW
shall inform the accounting server about the deallocation of the Ipv4 address
by sending Diameter Accounting-Request Interim-Update without the Framed-IP-
Address AVP.
The following Figure 25d.1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of
Diameter Authentication and Accounting, which is applicable for GTP based
S5/S8:
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="4.375in"}
NOTE 1: If some external applications require Diameter Accounting request
(Start) information before they can process user packets, then the selected
APN (P-GW) may be configured in such a way that the P-GW drops user data until
the Accounting Answer (START) is received from the Diameter server. The P-GW
may wait for the Accounting Answer (START) before sending the Create Session
Response. The P-GW may reject the bearer if the Accounting Answer (START) is
not received.
NOTE 2: Separate accounting and authentication servers may be used.
Figure 25d.1: An example of Diameter Authentication and Accounting on Sgi for
GTP-based S5/S8
### 16a.3a.2 Accounting Update
During the life of a bearer some information related to this bearer may
change. Upon occurrence of the following events the P-GW may send an
Accounting Request (Interim) to the Diameter server: RAT change, S-GW address
change and QoS change. Interim updates are also used when the Ipv4 address is
allocated/released/re-allocated for deferred Ipv4 addressing for the PDN type
Ipv4v6.
When the P-GW receives a signalling request (e.g. Modify Bearer Request in
case of GTP-based S5/S8) that indicates the occurrence of one of these
chargeable events, the P-GW may send an Accounting Request (Interim) to the
Diameter server to update the necessary information related to this bearer.
The P-GW need not wait for the Diameter Accounting Answer message from the
Diameter server before sending the response for the triggering signalling
message (e.g. Modify Bearer Response). The P-GW may delete the bearer if the
Accounting Answer is not received from the Diameter server.
The P-GW may also send interim updates at the expiry of an operator configured
time limit.
The message flow in figure 25d.2 provides an example for Diameter Accounting
Update procedure on Sgi interface, which is applicable for GTP based S5/S8:
Figure 25d.2: Diameter accounting update for bearer modification
### 16a.3a.3 Server-Initiated Bearer termination
Diameter is used as the protocol between the P-GW and a Diameter server or
proxy for applications (e.g. MMS) to deliver information related to the user
session. However some IP applications could need to interwork with the P-GW to
release the corresponding resource (e.g. terminate a particular bearer or
Resource Allocation Deactivation procedures as defined in TS 23.402 [78]). For
this purpose, the Diameter server or proxy may send a Diameter ASR along with
the EPS bearer ID, if available, to identify the particular bearer to be
terminated to the P-GW. The P-GW should react by deleting the corresponding
bearer. If the P-GW deletes the corresponding bearer, it need not wait for the
response from the S-GW or trusted non-3GPP IP access or ePDG before sending
the ASA to the server.
The absence of the EPS bearer ID in the Diameter ASR message indicates to the
P-GW that all bearers/resources for this particular user and sharing the same
user session shall be deleted. The bearer(s)/resources belonging to the same
IP-CAN session are identified by the Diameter Session-Id. If a user has the
same user IP address(es) for different sets of bearers towards different
networks, only the bearers linked to the one identified by the Diameter
Session-Id shall be deleted.
The message flow in figure 25d.3 provides an example for Server-initiated
Bearer Termination procedure on Sgi interface, which is applicable for GTP
based S5/S8:
Figure 25d.3: Server-initiated Bearer Termination with Diameter
## 16a.4 Gi/Sgi Diameter messages
This clause describes the Gi and the Sgi interface Diameter messages.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the Gi/Sgi interface are detailed in
this clause. Other Diameter NASREQ (IETF RFC 4005 [67]) AVPs, even if their
AVP flag rules is marked with \"M\", are not required for being compliant with
the current specification.
### 16a.4.1 AAR Command
The AAR command, defined in Diameter NASREQ (IETF RFC 4005 [67]), is indicated
by the Command-Code field set to 265 and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags
field. It may be sent by the GGSN to a Diameter server, during Primary PDP
Context activation only, in order to request user authentication and
authorization. In the case of P-GW, the AAR may be sent upon reception of an
initial access request (e.g. Create Session Request or Proxy Binding Update)
message for a given APN to request user authentication and authorization.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the Gi/Sgi interface are detailed in the
ABNF description below. Other valid AVPs for this command are not used for
Gi/Sgi purposes and should be ignored by the receiver or processed according
to the relevant specifications.
The bold marked AVPs in the message format indicate optional AVPs for Gi/Sgi,
or modified existing AVPs. For Sgi, some of the optional 3GPP vendor-specific
AVPs listed in the message format below are not applicable. See table 9a in

### 16a.4.3 ACR Command
The ACR command, defined in IETF RFC 6733 (Diameter Base) [111], is indicated
by the Command-Code field set to 271 and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags
field. It is sent by the GGSN/P-GW to the Diameter server to report accounting
information for a certain IP-CAN bearer (e.g. PDP context) or an IP-CAN
session of a certain user.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the Gi/Sgi interface are detailed in the
ABNF description below. Other valid AVPs for this command are not used for
Gi/Sgi purposes and should be ignored by the receiver or processed according
to the relevant specifications.

The information represented by some of the Sgi AVPs may not be available to
the P-GW depending on the UE's radio access and the S5/S8 protocol type (GTP
or PMIP). For example, the P-GW will be aware of the User Location Info (e.g.
TAI) if the user is in LTE access and GTP based S5/S8 is used. However, such
information is not passed to the P-GW when PMIP based S5/S8 is utilised. In
such scenarios, if an Sgi specific AVP is configured in the P-GW to be
transferred to the Diameter AAA server, but the information in the P-GW is not
up to date or not available; the P-GW shall not send the corresponding AVP,
unless otherwise stated in the AVP definitions in subclause 16.4.7.2.
## 16a.6 Gi/Sgi specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP
Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [111] defines a number of Result-Code AVP values
that are used to report protocol errors and how those are used. Those
procedures and values apply for the present specification.
Due to the Gi/Sgi specific AVPs, new application results can occur and the
Experimental-Result AVP is used to transfer the 3GPP-specific result codes.
The Experimental-Result AVP is a grouped AVP containing the Vendor-Id AVP set
to the value of 3GPP's vendor identifier (10415) and an Experimental-Result-
Code AVP.
The following Gi/Sgi specific Experimental-Result-Code value is defined:
DIAMETER_PDP_CONTEXT_DELETION_INDICATION (2021)
For GGSN this is an indication to the server that the requested PDP Context or
IP-CAN session has been deleted.
For P-GW this is an indication to the server that the requested bearer or IP-
CAN session has been deleted.
## 16a.7 Gi/Sgi re-used AVPs
Table 9b lists the Diameter AVPs re-used by the Gi/Sgi reference point from
existing Diameter Applications, reference to the respective specifications and
a short description of the usage within the Gi/Sgi reference point.

# 17 Usage of Diameter on Gmb interface
Signalling between GGSN and BM-SC is exchanged at Gmb reference point. BM-SC
functions for different MBMS bearer services may be provided by different
physical network elements. To allow this distribution of BM-SC functions, the
Gmb protocol must support the use of proxies to correctly route the different
signalling interactions in a manner which is transparent to the GGSN.
The GGSN uses the Gmb interface
\- to request authorisation/deactivation of a user for a multicast MBMS
service,
\- to register/de-register the GGSN for receiving a multicast MBMS service.
\- to receive indication of session start, session update and session stop
messages, which shall cause the GGSN, SGSN and RAN to set up/tear down the
appropriate resources for the service. For further details, see 3GPP TS 23.246
[65].
\- to receive indication if IP multicast distribution to UTRAN should be used
for the MBMS user plane data.
The support of Gmb within the GGSN is optional, and needed for MBMS.
The Gmb application is defined as an IETF vendor specific Diameter
application, where the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA
to 3GPP (http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415\. The
Gmb application identifier value assigned by IANA is 16777223.
The Gmb application identifier value shall be included in the Auth-
Application-Id AVP.
The BM-SC and the GGSN shall advertise the support of the Gmb application by
including the value of the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id
AVP and the value of the 3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the
Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [111], i.e. as part of the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVP. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol.
## 17.1 MBMS user authorisation
Upon reception of an IGMP (Ipv4) or MLD (Ipv6) Join message for an IP
multicast address allocated to MBMS services, the GGSN shall request
authorisation of the user for this multicast MBMS bearer service (identified
by the PDP context over which the IGMP join is received).
The GGSN shall support pre-configuration of a BM-SC or Gmb proxy server for
authorisation purposes to which the request shall be sent. The GGSN may
support a list of pre-configured BM-SC servers based on the MBMS bearer
service requested, for authorisation purposes.
Upon receipt of an MBMS UE Context Establishment Request for a user who has
not already been authorised for the MBMS bearer service, the GGSN shall
request authorisation of the user for this service.
## 17.2 MBMS service registration / de-registration
The MBMS service registration of the GGSN at the BM-SC shall be performed
after authorisation of the first user on a particular GGSN, for a particular
multicast MBMS Bearer service. The MBMS service de-registration of the GGSN
shall be performed when the last user leaves a particular GGSN, for a
particular multicast MBMS bearer service.
The MBMS de-registration procedure shall be initiated by BM-SC when the
specific multicast MBMS service is terminated.
The GGSN shall support pre-configuration of a BM-SC or Gmb proxy server for
registration/de-registration purposes. The GGSN may support a list of pre-
configured BM-SC servers based on the MBMS bearer service requested for bearer
registration purposes.
## 17.3 MBMS session start / update/ stop
The MBMS session start shall be used by the BM-SC to trigger the bearer
resource establishment and announce the arrival of data for a MBMS bearer
service (along with the attributes of the data to be delivered e.g. QoS or
MBMS service area) to every GGSN that will deliver the MBMS bearer service.
The MBMS session start shall also be used by the BM-SC to indicate to GGSN if
IP multicast mechanism should be used for user plane data distribution to
UTRAN.
The MBMS session update shall be used by the BM-SC to trigger the update of
MBMS session attributes in the affected GGSNs.
The MBMS session stop shall be used by the BM-SC to indicate the end of the
data stream for an MBMS bearer service to every GGSN that has been delivering
the MBMS bearer service.
## 17.4 MBMS user deactivation
The MBMS user deactivation is a procedure that removes the MBMS UE context
from the GGSN for a particular multicast MBMS bearer service (also called
\"leaving procedure\"). This procedure can be initiated by the GGSN or the BM-
SC over the Gmb interface.
When the last user leaves a particular GGSN, for a particular MBMS multicast
service, a de-registration process shall be initiated.
## 17.5 Message flows
### 17.5.1 Service activation
The multicast MBMS bearer service activation procedure registers the user in
the network to enable the reception of data from a specific multicast MBMS
bearer service
Figure 26; Activation of an MBMS multicast service
1\. The GGSN receives an IGMP (Ipv4) or MLD (Ipv6) Join message from a UE,
over the default PDP context to signal its interest in receiving a particular
multicast MBMS bearer service identified by an IP multicast address.
2\. The GGSN sends an AAR seeking authorization for the activating UE to
receive data from a particular service.
3\. The authorization decision is provided in the AAA together with the APN to
be used for creation of the MBMS UE context. If the AAA indicates that the UE
is not authorized to receive the MBMS data the process terminates with no
additional message exchange.
4\. The GGSN sends an MBMS Notification Request (IP multicast address, APN,
Linked NSAPI) to the SGSN. Linked NSAPI is set equal to the NSAPI of the PDP
context over which the Join request was received. The IP multicast address is
the one requested by the UE in the Join request. The APN may be different from
the APN to which the default PDP context has been activated. In any case, the
APN may resolve to a GGSN that is different from the GGSN receiving the
IGMP/MLD Join request. The GGSN starts a MBMS Activation Timer as GGSN may
receive no response, e.g. in case SGSN or UE does not support MBMS.
5\. The SGSN sends a MBMS Notification Response (Cause) to the GGSN that sent
the MBMS Notification Request, where Cause shall indicate successful or
unsuccessful MBMS context activation for the reason of SGSN or UE . Upon
reception of the response message with Cause indicating unsuccessful operation
or time-out of the MBMS Activation Timer in the GGSN, the GGSN may fallback to
IP multicast access as defined in clause 11.7.
6\. The SGSN creates an MBMS UE context and sends a Create MBMS Context
Requests (IP multicast address, APN, RAI) to the GGSN. That GGSN may be
different from the GGSN receiving the IGMP/MLD Join request.
7\. The GGSN sends an AAR seeking authorization for the activating UE.
8\. The authorization decision is provided in the AAA
9\. If the GGSN does not have the MBMS Bearer Context information for this
MBMS bearer service, i.e. the GGSN was not yet registered, the GGSN sends a
AAR to the BM-SC. See subclause 17.5.4 \"Registration Procedure\".
If no TMGI has been allocated for this MBMS bearer service, the BM-SC will
allocate a new TMGI. This TMGI will be passed to GGSN via the AAA message.
10\. The BM-SC responds with a AAA containing the MBMS Bearer Context
information for this MBMS bearer service and adds the identifier of the GGSN
to the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter in its MBMS Bearer Context. See
subclause 17.5.4 \"Registration Procedure\".
11\. The GGSN creates an MBMS UE context and sends a Create MBMS Context
Response to the SGSN
### 17.5.2 Session start procedure
The BM-SC initiates the MBMS session start procedure when it is ready to send
data. This informs the GGSN of the imminent start of the transmission and MBMS
session attributes are provided to the GGSNs included in the list of
downstream nodes in BM-SC. For a multicast MBMS service these are the GGSNs
that have previously registered for the corresponding MBMS bearer service. The
bearer plane is allocated.
BM-SC and GGSN shall at least support IP unicast encapsulation of IP multicast
datagrams, which shall be default mode of sending user plane data. BM-SC may
support sending user plane IP multicast datagrams to GGSN, and GGSN also may
support this mode of operation.
Figure 27: MBMS Session Start procedure
1\. The BM-SC sends a RAR message to indicate the impending start of the
transmission and to provide the session attributes to the GGSNs listed in the
\"list of downstream nodes\" parameter of the corresponding MBMS Bearer
Context. BM-SC may indicate to GGSN that BM-SC supports sending the user plane
IP multicast data without IP unicast encapsulation. In such case BM-SC shall
send multicast source address as specified by IETF RFC 4604 [73] and IETF RFC
4607 [74]. The BM-SC sets the state attribute of its MBMS Bearer Context to
'Active'. By sending \"CN IP Multicast Distribution\" parameter to GGSN, the
BM-SC indicates if IP multicast mechanism should be used for user plane data
distribution to UTRAN. \"MBMS HC Indicator\" parameter, if present, indicates
that a header compression is used for MBMS user plane data.
2\. For a broadcast MBMS bearer service the GGSN creates an MBMS Bearer
Context. The GGSN stores the session attributes in the MBMS Bearer Context,
sets the state attribute of its MBMS Bearer Context to 'Active' and sends a
RAA message to the BM-SC. In case GGSN receives BM-SC multicast source
address, which indicates BM-SC support for both modes of sending user plane
data, GGSN decides in which mode GGSN shall receive the user plane data. In
case GGSN decides to receive unicast encapsulated data, then GGSN shall send
own IP address and UDP port for the encapsulating unicast IP and UDP layer of
the user plane to BM-SC. In case GGSN decides to receive IP multicast packets,
then GGSN shall join the multicast group as specified by IETF RFC 4604 [73]
and IETF RFC 4607 [74], and indicate to BM-SC about the decision.
### 17.5.3 Session stop procedure
The BM-SC initiates the MBMS session stop procedure when it considers the MBMS
session terminated. Typically this will happen when there is no more MBMS data
expected to be transmitted for a sufficiently long period of time to justify
the release of bearer plane resources in the network.
Figure 28: MBMS Session Stop procedure
1\. The BM-SC sends a RAR message to all GGSNs listed in the \"list of
downstream nodes\" parameter of the affected MBMS Bearer Context to indicate
that the MBMS session is terminated and the bearer plane resources can be
released.
2\. The GGSN sets the state attribute of its MBMS Bearer Context to 'Standby'
and sends a RAA message to the BM-SC. An AAR message is not mandated for the
Gmb application in response to a RAR- RAA command exchange.
### 17.5.4 Registration procedure
The registration procedure occurs when the GGSN indicates the BM-SC that it
would like to receive session attributes and data for a particular multicast
MBMS bearer service, in order to be distributed further downstream. A
corresponding MBMS Bearer Context is established as a result between the GGSN
and the BM-SC.
Figure 29: MBMS Registration procedure
1\. When the GGSN has no MBMS Bearer Context for an MBMS bearer service and
the GGSN receives an MBMS Registration from an SGSN for this MBMS bearer
service, or when the first MBMS UE Context is created in the GGSN for an MBMS
bearer service for which the GGSN has no MBMS Bearer Context, the GGSN sends a
AAR message (containing the IP multicast address and the APN) to the BM-SC.
2\. Upon reception of an AAR from a GGSN, the BM-SC adds the identifier of the
GGSN to the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter in its MBMS Bearer Context
and responds with an AAA message (containing TMGI, and Required Bearer
Capabilities). If the MBMS Bearer Context is in the 'Active' state, the BM-SC
initiates the Session Start procedure with the GGSN, as described in clause
17.5.2 \"Session Start Procedure\".
### 17.5.5 De-registration procedure (GGSN initiated)
The MBMS de-registration is the procedure by which the GGSN informs the BM-SC
that it does not need to receive signalling, session attributes and data for a
particular multicast MBMS bearer service anymore and therefore would like to
be removed from the corresponding distribution tree.
Figure 30: MBMS De-Registration procedure
1\. When the \"list of downstream nodes\" of a particular MBMS Bearer Context
in the GGSN becomes empty and the GGSN has no MBMS UE Contexts linked to that
MBMS Bearer Context, the GGSN sends a STR message to the BM-SC. If a bearer
plane had been established over Gi for this MBMS bearer service, the bearer
plane is released.
2\. The BM-SC removes the identifier of the GGSN from the \"list of downstream
nodes\" parameter of the affected MBMS Bearer Context and confirms the
operation by sending a STA message to the GGSN.
### 17.5.6 De-registration procedure (BM-SC initiated)
This MBMS de-registration procedure is initiated by BM-SC when the specific
multicast MBMS bearer service is terminated. This procedure tears down the
distribution tree for the delivery of session attributes and MBMS data. This
procedure results in releasing of all MBMS Bearer Contexts.
Figure 31: MBMS De-Registration procedure BM-SC initiated
1\. The BM-SC sends a ASR message to all GGSNs contained in the \"list of
downstream nodes\" parameter of the corresponding MBMS Bearer Context to
indicate that a specific MBMS bearer service is terminated.
2\. The GGSN returns a ASA message to the BM-SC. The BM-SC releases all MBMS
UE Contexts and removes the identifier of the GGSN from the \"list of
downstream nodes\" parameter of the corresponding MBMS Bearer context.
### 17.5.7 Service deactivation
The multicast service deactivation is a signalling procedure that will
terminate the user registration to a particular MBMS multicast service. The
multicast service deactivation can be initiated by the GGSN, when indicated so
by the UE, or by the BM-SC, for service specific reasons.
Figure 32: MBMS Service deactivation procedure
1\. The UE sends an IGMP (Ipv4) or MLD (Ipv6) Leave message over the default
PDP context to leave a particular multicast service identified by an IP
multicast address.
2\. The GGSN sends a STR to the BM-SC, indicating that the UE is requesting to
leave the multicast service. The session to be terminated is uniquely
identified by the Diameter session-id.
3\. Upon reception of the STR, the BM-SC verifies that the IP multicast
address corresponds to a valid MBMS bearer service and sends a STA to the GGSN
that originated the Leave Indication. The APN shall be the same that was
provided during service activation (see \" Service Activation\" procedure).
4\. Upon reception of the STA the GGSN sends an MBMS UE Context Deactivation
Request to the SGSN. The IP multicast address, APN and IMSI together identify
the MBMS UE Context to be deleted by the SGSN. The APN is the one received in
step 3.
5\. The GGSN receives a Delete MBMS Context Request (NSAPI). This GGSN may be
different from the GGSN that receives IGMP Leave request in step 1.
6\. The GGSN deletes the MBMS UE Context and sends a STR to the BM-SC to
confirm the successful deactivation of the MBMS UE Context.
7\. The BM-SC, then, deletes the MBMS UE Context and sends a confirmation to
the GGSN in a STA message.
8\. If the GGSN does not have any more users interested in this MBMS bearer
service and the \"list of downstream nodes\" in the corresponding MBSM Bearer
Context is empty, the GGSN initiates a De-Registration procedure as specified
in 17.5.5.
9\. The BM-SC confirms the operation by sending a STA message to the GGSN as
specified in 17.5.5.
#### 17.5.7.1 BM-SC Initiated Multicast Service Deactivation
This section defines the BM-SC initiated Multicast Service Deactivation
procedure.
Figure 32a: BM-SC initiated MBMS Service deactivation procedure
1\. The BM-SC sends an ASR to the GGSN, indicating that the UE shall be
removed from the multicast service. The session to be terminated is uniquely
identified by the Diameter session-id.
2\. Upon reception of the ASR, the GGSN sends an ASA to the BM-SC
3\. Upon reception of the ASR the GGSN sends an MBMS UE Context Deactivation
Request to the SGSN. The IP multicast address, APN and IMSI together identify
the MBMS UE Context to be deleted by the SGSN.
Steps from 5 to 9 of figure 32 in section 17.5.7 follow.
### 17.5.8 Trace Session Activation procedure
The Trace Session Activation procedure occurs when the GGSN indicates to the
BM-SC that a Trace Session needs to be activated.
Figure 33: Trace Session Activation procedure
1\. When the GGSN has received a Trace Activation message from the SGSN, in a
Create MBMS Context Request/Update MBMS Context Request, that requires the
activation of a Trace Session in the BM-SC, the GGSN sends an AAR message
(containing the IMSI and the Additional MBMS Trace Info AVPs) to activate a
trace session in the BM-SC.
2\. Upon reception of an AAR from a GGSN to activate a Trace Session, the BM-
SC responds with an AAA message.
### 17.5.9 Trace Session Deactivation procedure
The Trace Session Deactivation procedure occurs when the GGSN indicates to the
BM-SC that a Trace Session, previously activated, needs to be deactivated.
Figure 34: Trace Session Deactivation procedure
1\. When the GGSN has received a Trace Deactivation message from the SGSN, in
a Create MBMS Context Request/Update MBMS Context Request, that requires the
deactivation of a Trace Session in the BM-SC, the GGSN sends a STR message
(containing the Additional MBMS Trace Info AVP) to deactivate a trace session
in the BM-SC and to tear down the corresponding Diameter Session previously
established to activate the Trace Session.
2\. Upon reception of an STR from a GGSN to deactivate a Trace Session, the
BM-SC responds with an STA message.
### 17.5.10 MBMS UE Context Modification Procedure
During the multicast MBMS bearer service activation, the MBMS UE Context is
stored in the BM-SC. Later, the MBMS UE Context shall be updated when the UE
enters a new Routeing Area (RA) served by a new SGSN or the UE is
transitioning between UTRAN and A/Gb mode GERAN or vice versa (Inter-system
Intra-SGSN change). See 3GPP TS 23.246 [65] and 3GPP TS 29.060 [24]. GGSN
shall pass the relevant data via the Gmb interface to enable the BM-SC to
update its MBMS UE context accordingly.
Figure 35; Modification of an MBMS UE Context in BM-SC
1, On request from SGSN, the MBMS UE Context is updated in the GGSN.
2\. The GGSN sends updated MBMS UE Context parameters (RAI, and CGI/SAI as
specified in clause 17.6.1) to BM-SC in an AAR message.
3\. The BM-SC updates its MBMS UE Context fields and responds with an AAA
message.
If the GGSN receives new or updated trace information in step 1, then the
above procedure may be followed by a Trace Session Activation procedure (see
clause 17.5.8) or a Trace Session Deactivation procedure (see clause 17.5.9).
### 17.5.11 Session Update Procedure
The BM-SC initiates the MBMS session update procedure when the service area
for an ongoing MBMS session shall be modified. This procedure is defined only
for MBMS broadcast services. The MBMS session update procedure is initiated
towards one or more of the GGSNs in the list of downstream nodes in the BM-SC,
according to the changes in the service area.
NOTE: In addition, when the MBMS Service Area for an ongoing broadcast session
is changed in the BM-SC, then GGSN(s) may be added to, or removed from, the
list of downstream nodes in the BM-SC. The BM-SC will initiate MBMS session
start procedures or MBMS session stop procedures towards these GGSNs
accordingly.
The attributes that can be modified by the session update procedure are the
MBMS Service Area, and the list of downstream nodes for GGSN.
When a session update message is received , GGSN will update its MBMS Bearer
Context accordingly and inform its downstream SGSNs of the changed MBMS
service area. If a list of downstream SGSNs is included in the session update
message, GGSN shall initiate a session start procedure towards the new
downstream SGSNs, and a session stop procedure towards the SGSNs that have
been removed from the list.
{width="2.727777777777778in" height="1.9694444444444446in"}
Figure 27: MBMS Session Update procedure
1\. The BM-SC sends a RAR message to the GGSNs that need to update its session
attributes.
2\. GGSN stores the updated session attributes in the MBMS Bearer Context,
initiates session start, session stop or session update procedures towards the
SGSNs in its list of downstream nodes and sends an RAA message to the BM-SC.
An AAR message is not mandated for the Gmb application in response to a RAR-
RAA command exchange.
### 17.5.12 MBMS broadcast session termination (GGSN initiated)
Figure 36: Broadcast session termination
1\. In exceptional cases (e.g. resource pre-emption or timeout of the MBMS
session), the GGSN may send an STR command to the BM-SC to initiate the
termination of the Diameter session related to a broadcast MBMS bearer
service. If a bearer plane had been established over Gi for this MBMS bearer
service, the bearer plane is released.
2\. The BM-SC removes the Diameter session and confirms the operation by
sending an STA message to the GGSN.
## 17.6 Gmb Messages
This clause defines the Gmb interface Diameter messages.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the Gmb interface are detailed in this
clause. Other Diameter NASREQ (IETF RFC 4005 [67]) AVPs, even if their AVP
flag rules is marked with \"M\", are not required for being compliant with the
current specification.
All Gmb specific AVPs for Gmb are needed to be compliant to the Gmb interface
unless otherwise stated.
### 17.6.1 AAR Command
The AAR command, defined in Diameter NASREQ (IETF RFC 4005 [67]), is indicated
by the Command-Code field set to 265 and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags
field. It, is sent by the GGSN to the BM-SC to request user authorization
(authorize the activating UE to receive Data) , to modify an MBMS UE Context
in the BM-SC or to register the GGSN for a particular multicast MBMS bearer
service. When used for these purposes, the Additional-MBMS-Trace-Info AVP
shall not be included.
When the AAR command is used by the GGSN to modify an MBMS UE context in the
BM-SC, it shall include all the parameters that have been changed according to
the triggering Update MBMS Context Request, ref. fig. 35. The inclusion of
CGI/SAI in the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP shall be according to the rules
detailed in subclause 15.1.1a in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3]). The Called-Station-Id
AVP, Calling-Station-Id AVP, Framed-IP-Address AVP, Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP and
Framed-Interface-Id AVP shall not be included,
The AAR command is also used when the GGSN needs to activate a Trace Session
in the BM-SC. In this case the Called-Station-Id AVP, Calling-Station-Id AVP,
Framed-IP-Address AVP, Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP, Framed-Interface-Id AVP, and
RAI AVP shall not be included. For more detailed description of Trace Session
activation/deactivation procedures see 3GPP TS 32.422 [69].
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the Gmb interface are detailed in the
ABNF description below. Other valid AVPs for this command are not used for Gmb
purposes and should be ignored by the receiver or processed according to the
relevant specifications.
The bold marked AVPs in the message format indicate new optional AVPs for Gmb,
or modified existing AVPs.

The GGSN shall allocate a new Session-Id each time an AAR command is sent,
except for the case when the AAR is sent to modify an existing MBMS UE Context
in the BM-SC.
A request for user authorisation for an MBMS bearer service is indicated by
the presence of the MSISDN within the Calling-Station-Id AVP and the 3GPP-
IMSI. Otherwise the request is for the GGSN to be authorised (i.e. registered)
to receive the MBMS bearer service.The Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP contains the
Ipv6 prefix of the multicast address identifying the MBMS bearer service.
The Framed-Interface-Id AVP contains the Ipv6 interface identifier of the
multicast address identifying the MBMS bearer service.
The Framed-IP-Address AVP contains the Ipv4 multicast address identifying the
MBMS bearer service.
The Called-Station-Id AVP contains the Access Point Name (APN) on which the
MBMS bearer service authorisation request was received.
### 17.6.2 AAA Command
The AAA command, defined in Diameter NASREQ (IETF RFC 4005 [67]), is indicated
by the Command-Code field set to 265 and the 'R' bit cleared in the Command
Flags field., It is sent by the BM-SC to the GGSN in response to the AAR
command.
When the AAA command is used to acknowledge an AAR that activated a Trace
Session, the only Gmb specific AVP that shall be included is the 3GPP-IMSI
AVP.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the Gmb interface are detailed in the
ABNF description below. Other valid AVPs for this command are not used for Gmb
purposes and should be ignored by the receiver or processed according to the
relevant specifications.

### 17.6.3 STR Command
The STR command, defined in IETF RFC 6733 (DIAMETER BASE) [111], is indicated
by the Command-Code field set to 275 and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags
field, It is sent by the GGSN to the BM-SC to terminate a DIAMETER session.
A DIAMETER session for a multicast MBMS service is terminated when the last
MBMS UE context for the MBMS bearer service is deleted. This informs the BM-SC
that the GGSN would like to be deleted from the distribution tree of a
particular MBMS bearer service (De-registration procedure).
A DIAMETER session for an individual UE's multicast MBMS service authorisation
is terminated when the UE has requested to the GGSN to leave the MBMS bearer
service.
A DIAMETER session for a broadcast MBMS service may be terminated by the GGSN
in exceptional cases.
The STR command is also used to deactivate a Trace Session previously
activated in the BM-SC and to terminate the associated Diameter Session
initiated by the AAR that activated the Trace session. The Gmb specific AVP
Additonal-MBMS-Trace-Info shall be included in the STR command only in the
case of a Trace Session deactivation. For more detailed description of Trace
Session activation/deactivation procedures see 3GPP TS 32.422 [69].
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the Gmb interface are detailed in the
ABNF description below. Other valid AVPs for this command are not used for Gmb
purposes and should be ignored by the receiver or processed according to the
relevant specifications.

### 17.6.5 Re-Auth-Request Command
The Re-Auth-Request (RAR) command, defined in IETF RFC 6733 (DIAMETER BASE)
[111], is indicated by the Command-Code set to 258 and the message flags' 'R'
bit set.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the Gmb interface are detailed in the
ABNF description below. Other valid AVPs for this command are not used for Gmb
purposes and should be ignored by the receiver or processed according to the

The MBMS-StartStop-Indication AVP will indicate if the command is indicating
an MBMS Session Start procedure, an MBMS Session Update procedure or an MBMS
Session Stop procedure.
The Diameter Session-Id is used in subsequent procedures to identify the
corresponding MBMS session.
In the multicast case, the BM-SC shall use the Diameter Session-Id that was
received during the GGSN Registration procedure. In the broadcast case, the
BM-SC shall allocate a Diameter Session-Id for the first RAR message that is
used for the first MBMS Session Start procedure of the MBMS bearer service.
Then this Diameter Session-Id will be used for the subsequent MBMS sessions of
the same MBMS bearer service. The BM-SC will create a new Diameter Session-Id
for a subsequent Session Start procedure if, in exceptional cases, the
Diameter session for the MBMS bearer service has been deleted.
BM-SC shall not initiate a new Session Start procedure for a certain MBMS
bearer service until the previous MBMS session for that service has been
stopped.
For the MBMS Session Start procedure, RAR is sent by the BM-SC to the GGSN(s)
that will deliver the MBMS service (e.g. in the multicast case these are the
GGSNs that have previously registered for the corresponding multicast MBMS
bearer service), when it is ready to send data. This is a request to activate
all necessary bearer resources in the network for the transfer of MBMS data
and to notify interested UEs of the imminent start of the transmission. For
broadcast MBMS bearer services the RAR message contains either an Ipv4 address
or an Ipv6 address for each participating SGSN.
For the MBMS Session Update procedure, RAR is sent by the BM-SC in order for
the GGSN(s) to update their session attributes. The updated MBMS-Service-Area
AVP shall be included. The MBMS-StartStop-Indication AVP with the value UPDATE
shall be included. The MBMS-Time-To-Data-Transfer with the value set to 0
shall be included. The MBMS-Session-Duration AVP shall be included to indicate
the duration of the remaining part of the MBMS session. The 3GPP-SGSN-Address
AVP and the 3GPP-SGSN-Ipv6-Address AVP shall be included if the related lists
of downstream nodes in the GGSN(s) have changed. The other bold marked AVPs
shall be included as given by the previous, corresponding MBMS Session Start
procedure.
For the MBMS Session Stop procedure, RAR is sent by the BM-SC to the GGSN(s)
when it considers the MBMS session to be terminated. The session is typically
terminated when there is no more MBMS data expected to be transmitted for a
sufficiently long period of time to justify a release of bearer plane
resources in the network.
For the MBMS Session Start procedure, the MBMS-Required-QoS indicates the QoS
that is required for the MBMS bearer service for the actual MBMS session. The
information of the MBMS-2G-3G-Indicator, the MBMS-Service-Area and the MBMS-
Counting-Information is passed from BM-SC transparently through GGSN to the
SGSN(s) that are relevant for the actual MBMS bearer service.
According to 3GPP TS 23.246 [65], a specific MBMS bearer service is uniquely
identified by its IP multicast address and an APN. For the MBMS Session Start
procedure for broadcast MBMS bearer services, the following AVPs are included
(either Ipv4 or Ipv6 address) to enable GGSN to relate incoming payload
packets to the actual MBMS bearer service and distribute the packets to the
downstream SGSNs related to this service:
\- The Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP contains the Ipv6 prefix of the multicast
address.
\- The Framed-Interface-Id AVP contains the Ipv6 interface identifier of the
multicast address.
\- The Framed-IP-Address AVP contains the Ipv4 multicast address.
\- The Called-Station-Id AVP contains the Access Point Name (APN) for which
the MBMS bearer service is defined.
According to 3GPP TS 23.246 [65], the MBMS-Flow-Identifier is optional, used
only for broadcast services with location dependent content. For such
services, several sessions with the same TMGI, but different MBMS-Flow-
Identifiers, may be going on in parallel. However, at any specific location
only one version of the content may be available at any point in time. Hence,
the MBMS-Service-Areas of the related MBMS bearer contexts shall not overlap.
### 17.6.6 RE-Auth-Answer Command
The Re-Auth-Answer (RAA) command, defined in IETF RFC 6733 (DIAMETER BASE)
[111], is indicated by the Command-Code set to 258 and the message flags' 'R'
bit clear, is sent in response to the RAR.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the Gmb interface are detailed in the
ABNF description below. Other valid AVPs for this command are not used for Gmb
purposes and should be ignored by the receiver or processed according to the
relevant specifications.
The bold marked AVPs in the message format indicate new optional AVPs for Gmb,
or modified existing AVPs.
Message Format:

If multicast user plane data are to be sent to the GGSN using IP unicast, the
GGSN shall allocate an IP transport address and a separate UDP port for each
MBMS bearer ( i.e the service uniquely identified by its TMGI and Flow ID and
provided by the GPRS to deliver the same IP datagrams to multiple receivers in
a designated location). The GGSN shall then use the destination unicast IP
address and destination UDP port of user plane packets received over the Gi
interface to determine on which MBMS bearer to forward the received user plane
packet.
### 17.6.7 Abort-Session-Request Command
The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) command, defined in IETF RFC 6733 (DIAMETER
BASE) [111], is indicated by the Command-Code set to 274 and the message
flags' 'R' bit set, is sent by the BM-SC to the GGSN to request that the
session identified by the Session-Id be stopped.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the Gmb interface are detailed in the
ABNF description below. Other valid AVPs for this command are not used for Gmb
purposes and should be ignored by the receiver or processed according to the
relevant specifications.

## 17.8 Gmb specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
### 17.8.0 General
There are two different types of errors in Diameter; protocol and application
errors. A protocol error is one that occurs at the base protocol level, those
are covered in the Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [111] specific procedures.
Application errors, on the other hand, generally occur due to a problem with a
function specified in a Diameter application.
Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [111] defines a number of Result-Code AVP values
that are used to report protocol errors and how those are used. Those
procedures and values apply for the present specification.
Due to the Gmb specific AVPs, new applications errors can occur. The Gmb
specific errors are described by the Experimental-Result-Code AVP in this
clause, below. Note that according to IETF RFC 6733 [111], the Diameter node
reports only the first error encountered and only one Result-Code AVP or one
Experimental-Result AVP is included in the Diameter answer.
### 17.8.1 Success
Resulting codes that fall within the Success category are used to inform a
peer that a request has been successfully completed.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [111] are
applicable.
### 17.8.2 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category are used to inform the
peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted again.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [111] are
applicable. Also the following specific Gmb Experimental-Result-Code values
are defined for permanent failures:
DIAMETER_ERROR_START_INDICATION (5120)
This error covers the case when a MBMS Session Start procedure could not be
performed due to some of the required session attributes that are necessary to
activate the bearer resources are missing (QoS, MBMS Service Area...). The
Failed-AVP AVP must contain the missing AVP.
DIAMETER_ERROR_STOP_INDICATION (5121)
An indication of session stop has been received with no session start
procedure running.
DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKNOWN_MBMS_BEARER_SERVICE (5122)
The requested MBMS service is unknown at the BM-SC.
DIAMETER_ERROR_SERVICE_AREA (5123)
The MBMS service area indicated for a specific MBMS Bearer Service is unknown
or not available.
### 17.8.3 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to inform a
peer that a request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but it
may be satisfied in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [111] are
applicable. Also the following specific Gmb Experimental-Result-Code value is
defined for transient failures:
DIAMETER_ERROR_OUT_OF_RESOURCES (4121)
This error covers the case when a MBMS Session Start procedure could not be
performed due to a temporary resource shortage in the GGSN. The BM-SC may re-
try later.
# 18 Usage of RADIUS at the Pk Reference Point
## 18.1 General
The Pk Reference Point is defined in 3GPP TS 23.141 [68] and allows the GGSN
to report presence relevant events to the Presence Network Agent (such as PDP
context activation/de-activation). This reference point is implemented using
the mechanisms for Accounting of the RADIUS interface on the Gi reference
point as defined in Clause 16.
## 18.2 Radius Profile for Pk Reference Point
The RADIUS interface on Gi reference point as defined in Clause 16 is used for
the Pk Reference Point as clarified in the Profile in this Clause.
Only the following messages are required for the Radius Profile for the Pk
reference Point:
\- Accounting-Request START
\- Accounting-Response START
\- Accounting-Request STOP
\- Accounting-Response STOP
For the Radius Profile for the Pk Reference Point, only the mandatory
Parameters within the Accounting-Request START and Accounting-Request STOP
messages according to Clauses 16.4.3 and 16.4.4, respectively, and the
Parameter \"Calling-Station-Id\" need to be supported. The usage of other
parameters is optional. They may be ignored by the Presence Network Agent.
## 18.3 Interconnecting the Presence Network Agent and the GGSN
The Presence Network Agent may be directly attached to the GGSN or via a
Radius Proxy.
If the GGSN needs to connect both to an AAA server and a Presence Network
Agent for the same APN, but supports only a single RADIUS interface, the GGSN
can be directly attached to the AAA server. The Presence Network Agent can in
turn be attached to the AAA server, which acts as a RADIUS proxy. If the AAA
server is configured as a RADIUS Proxy between the Presence Network Agent and
the GGSN, the Radius Profile for the Pk Reference Point shall be applicable on
the interface between the Presence Network Agent and the AAA server.

3GPP TS 23.246 [65] specifies that when MBMS bearers are used to provide MBMS
user services to roaming users, three specific scenarios are used.
One uses a GGSN in the Home PLMN, which is not related to Mz interface. The
other two are enabled by use of the Mz interface for multicast services and
are further described below.
Mz is the roaming variant of the Gmb reference point with the same
functionality as decribed under Gmb, i.e. with MBMS bearer and user specific
signalling. The support of Mz with in BM-SC is needed for MBMS roaming
scenario. Mz interface is defined between the visited BM-SC and the home BM-
SC.
MBMS bearer and user specific Mz signalling is used between a BM-SC in the
visited PLMN and a BM-SC in the home PLMN when MBMS services from the home
PLMN are offered by the visited PLMN.
User specific signalling is used between a BM-SC in the visited PLMN and a BM-
SC in the home PLMN when the visited PLMN offers MBMS user service to roaming
users. This user specifice Mz signalling provides home PLMN authorisation for
MBMS user service that are provided by the visited PLMN.
Mz may use proxy capabilities as described for Gmb, e.g. to proxy signalling
between BM-SCs.
## 19.2 Call flows in roaming scenarios
The procedures described in clause 17 of the present specification: Session
Start procedure (clause 17.5.2), Session Stop procedure (clause 17.5.3),
Registration procedure (clause 17.5.4), De-registration procedure (GGSN
initiated) (clause 17.5.5), De-registration procedure (BM-SC initiated)
(clause 17.5.6), Trace Session Activation procedure (clause 17.5.8), Trace
Session Deactivation procedure (clause 17.5.9), MBMS UE Context Modification
procedure (clause 17.5.10), and Session Update procedure (clause 17.5.11) work
exactly the same in roaming scenarios, i.e when the GGSN is in a visited PLMN
and the BM-SC is in the home PLMN, and they are Gmb procedures only and are
not needed over Mz interface.
Service activation procedures and Service deactivation procedures are the only
procedures over Mz interface, and are described in detail in the following
subclauses.
### 19.2.1 Service activation
#### 19.2.1.1 Service Provided by the BM-SC in Home PLMN
A visited PLMN may offer to roaming users MBMS user services from their home
PLMN. For this case, the PDP connection, which will be used for the JOIN step,
may be from the UE to the visited GGSN due to operator policy or routing
optimization. Then the authorization is done in the BM-SC in visited PLMN with
the authorization information retrieved from the BM-SC in home PLMN.
Whether GGSN of home or visited PLMN would be used is based on the operator
policy, or agreement between PLMNs.
The MBMS user traffic is provided by the BM-SC in home PLMN and proxyed.
Figure 28: Activation of an MBMS multicast service in roaming scenario with
service provided in the home PLMN
1\. The GGSN sends an AAR to the BM-SC in visited PLMN seeking authorizationt
for the activating roaming UE to receive data from a particular service.
2\. The BM-SC in visited PLMN finds the BM-SC in home PLMN which will serve
the roaming UE based on the multicast IP address, and identity of the user,
and sends the AAR to it for the roaming UE to receive data from a 152orrection
service.
3\. The authorization decision is provided from BM-SC in home PLMN in the AAA
to BM-SC in visited PLMN. An APN may be included in the signalling between BM-
SCs, which indicates a GGSN in home PLMN which will serve the UE for the
specific MBMS service. The BM-SC in the visit network may modify the APN based
on the operator policy or agreement between PLMNs.
4\. The authorization decision, as received from BM-SC in home PLMN, is
provided in the AAA to GGSN together with the APN to be used for creation of
the MBMS UE Context If the AAA indicates that the roaming UE is not authorized
to receive the MBMS data the process terminates with no additional message
exchange.
Whether GGSN of home or visited PLMN would be used is based on the operator
policy, or agreement between PLMNs, for example, the visited BM-SC may modify
the APN from the home BM-SC according to configuration of operator policy.
5\. The GGSN sends an AAR seeking authorization for the activating UE to BM-SC
in home PLMN. This GGSN may be different from the GGSN that receives IGMP join
message.
6\. The authorization decision is provided in the AAA to GGSN.
#### 19.2.1.2 Service Provided by the BM-SC in visited PLMN
When visited and home PLMN support the same classes of MBMS user services, a
visited PLMN may offer its own MBMS user services to roaming users. In this
case, the authorization is done in the BM-SC in visited PLMN with the
authorization information retrieved from the BM-SC in home PLMN. Then the MBMS
user traffic is provided by the BM-SC in visited PLMN.
Figure 29: Activation of an MBMS multicast service in roaming scenario with
service provided in the visited PLMN
1\. The GGSN sends an AAR to the BM-SC in visited PLMN seeking authorizationt
information for the activating roaming UE to receive data from a particular
service.
2\. The BM-SC in visited PLMN finds the BM-SC in home PLMN which have the
authorization information for the roaming UE based on the multicast IP
address, and identity of the user, and sends the AAR to it for the roaming UE
to receive authorization from a 153orrection service.
3\. The authorization decision is provided from BM-SC in home PLMN in the AAA
to BM-SC in visited PLMN.
4\. The authorization decision, as received from BM-SC in home PLMN, is
provided in the AAA to GGSN together with the APN to be used for creation of
the MBMS UE Context If the AAA indicates that the roaming UE is not authorized
to receive the MBMS data the process terminates with no additional message
exchange.
5\. The GGSN sends an AAR seeking authorization for the activating UE to BM-SC
in visited PLMN. This GGSN may be different from the GGSN that receives IGMP
join message.
6\. The authorization decision is provided in the AAA to GGSN.
### 19.2.2 Service deactivation

{width="6.455555555555556in" height="3.3in"}
Figure 30: Deactivation of an MBMS multicast service in roaming scenario with
service provided in the home PLMN
1\. Upon receiving the leave indication, the GGSN sends an STR to the BM-SC in
visited PLMN, indicating that the roaming UE is requesting to leave the
multicast service. The session to be terminate is uniquely identified by the
Diameter session-id.
2\. Upon reception of the STR, the BM-SC in visited PLMN finds the BM-SC in
home PLMN which serves the roaming UE, and sends an STR to it for the roaming
UE to deactivate a particular service.
3\. Upon reception of the STR, the BM-SC in home PLMN verifies that the IP
multicast address corresponds to a valid MBMS bearer service and responds the
BM-SC in visited PLMN with an ST-Answer. The APN shall be the same that was
provided during service activation.
4\. Upon reception of the STA, the BM-SC in visited PLMN sends an STA to the
GGSN that orignated the Leave Indication.
5\. The GGSN which is used to establish the MBMS bearer service deletes the
MBMS UE Context and sends an STR to the BM-SC in home PLMN to confirm the
successful deactivation of the MBMS UE Context.
6\. The BM-SC in home PLMN then, deletes the MBMS UE Context and sends a
confirmation to the GGSN in an STA message.
#### 19.2.2.2 Service Provided by the BM-SC in visited PLMN
Figure 31: Deactivation of an MBMS multicast service in roaming scenario with
service provided in the visited PLMN
1\. Upon receiving the leave indication, the GGSN sends an STR to the BM-SC in
visited PLMN, indicating that the roaming UE is requesting to leave the
multicast service. The session to be terminate is uniquely identified by the
Diameter session-id.
2\. Upon reception of the STR, the BM-SC in visited PLMN verifies that the IP
multicast address corresponds to a valid MBMS bearer service and sends an STR
to the BM-SC in home PLMN.
3\. The BM-SC in home PLMN responds the BM-SC in visited PLMN with an ST-
Answer.
4\. Upon reception of the STA, the BM-SC in visited PLMN sends an STA to the
GGSN that orignated the Leave Indication. The APN shall be the same that was
provided during service activation.
5\. The GGSN deletes the MBMS UE Context and sends an STR to the BM-SC in
visited PLMN to confirm the successful deactivation of the MBMS UE Context.
6\. The BM-SC in visited PLMN, then, delets the MBMS UE Context and sends a
confirmation to the GGSN in an STA message.
#### 19.2.2.3 BM-SC in the home PLMN initiated multicast service deactivation
This section defines the BM-SC in the home PLMN initiated multicast service
deactivation procedure.
Figure 32: BM-SC in the home PLMN initiated MBMS multicast service
deactivation procedure
1\. The BM-SC in home PLMN sends an ASR to the BM-SC in visited PLMN,
indicating that the UE shall be removed from a specific multicast service. The
session to be terminated is uniquely identified by the Diameter session-id.
2\. The BM-SC in the visited PLMN sends an ASR to the GGSN indicating that the
UE shall be removed from the multicast service. The session to be terminated
is uniquely identified by the Diameter session-id.
3\. Upon reception of the ASR, the GGSN sends an ASA to the BM-SC in visited
PLMN.
4\. Upon reception of the ASA, the BM-SC in visited PLMN sends an ASA to the
BM-SC in home PLMN.
5\. Upon reception of the ASR in step 3, the GGSN sends an MBMS UE Context
Deactivation Request to the SGSN. The IP multicast address, APN and IMSI
together identify the MBMS UE Context to be deleted by the SGSN.
Steps 5 and 6 of Figure 30 in section 19.2.2.1 follows in roaming scenarios
where service was provided in the home PLMN.
Steps 5 and 6 of Figure 31 in section 19.2.2.2 follows in roaming scenarios
where service was provided in the visited PLMN.
## 19.3 Mz messages
This clause defines the Mz interface Diameter messages.
The Diameter messages used in the Mz protocol, are the same as specified for
Gmb interface described in Clause 17 of the present specification: AAR Command
(clause 17.6.1), AAA Command (clause 17.6.2), STR Command (clause 17.6.3), STA
Command (clause 17.6.4), Abort-Session-Request Command (clause 17.6.7) and
Abort-Session-Answer Command (17.6.8).
To route Diameter messages from the visited PLMN to the home PLMN, the BM-SC
in the visited PLMN shall derive the realm of the home PLMN from the user's
IMSI. The way to derive the realm of the home PLMN from IMSI is specified in
3GPP TS 23.003 [40] subclause 15.4.
The derived realm of the home PLMN shall be filled in the Destination-Realm
AVP of messages sent from the visited PLMN to the home PLMN, i.e. AAR command,
STR command.
## 19.4 Mz specific AVPs
The Mz specific AVPs are the same as specified in Table 10 and Table 11. The
Vendor-Id header of all Mz specific AVPs defined in the present specification
shall be set to 3GPP (10415).
## 19.5 Mz specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
There are two different types of errors in Diameter; protocol and application
errors. A protocol error is one that occurs at the base protocol level, those
are covered in the Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [111] specific procedures.
Application errors, on the other hand, generally occur due to a problem with a
function specified in a Diameter application.
Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [111] defines a number of Result-Code AVP values
that are used to report protocol errors and how those are used. Those
procedures and values apply for the present specification.
Note that according to IETF RFC 6733 [111], the Diameter node reports only the
first error encountered and only one Result-Code AVP or one Experimental-
Result AVP is included in the Diameter answer.
### 19.5.1 Success
The success result codes specified in clause 17.8.1 of the present
specification are applicable for Mz.
### 19.5.2 Permanent Failures
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [111] are
applicable. Also the following specific Gmb Experimental-Result-Code value
defined in clause 17.8.2 is applicable for Mz:
DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKNOWN_MBMS_BEARER_SERVICE (5122)
The requested MBMS service is unknown at the BM-SC.
### 19.5.3 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to inform a
peer that a request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but it
may be satisfied in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [111] are
applicable.
# 20 Usage of Diameter on SGmb interface
## 20.1 General
Signalling between MBMS GW and BM-SC is exchanged at SGmb reference point.
The MBMS GW uses the SGmb interface:
\- to receive indication of session start, session update and session stop
messages, which shall cause the MBMS GW, MME/SGSN and E-UTRAN/UTRAN to set
up/tear down the appropriate resources for the service. For further details,
see 3GPP TS 23.246 [65];
\- to enable the BM-SC and MBMS GW to detect an SGmb path failure or the
restart of the peer MBMS node. For further details, see 3GPP TS 23.007 [104].
\- to enable the BM-SC to transfer the M1 interface information of local MBMS
information. For further details, see 3GPP TS 23.285 [112].
NOTE: The localized MBMS architecture refers to Annex B of 3GPP TS 23.285
[112].
The SGmb application is defined as an IETF vendor specific Diameter
application, where the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA
to 3GPP (http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415\. The
SGmb application identifier value assigned by IANA is 16777292.
The SGmb application identifier value shall be included in the Auth-
Application-Id AVP.
The BM-SC and the MBMS GW shall advertise the support of the SGmb application
by including the value of the application identifier in the Auth-Application-
Id AVP and the value of the 3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the
Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [111], i.e. as part of the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVP. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol.
## 20.2 MBMS session start / update/ stop
The MBMS session start shall be used by the BM-SC to trigger the bearer
resource establishment and announce the arrival of data for a MBMS bearer
service (along with the attributes of the data to be delivered e.g. QoS, MBMS
service area, or MBMS-Cell-List) to every MBMS GW that will deliver the MBMS
bearer service.
The MBMS session update shall be used by the BM-SC to trigger the update of
MBMS session attributes in the affected MBMS GWs. The attributes that can be
modified are the MBMS service area, the MBMS-Cell-List and the list of MBMS
control plane nodes (MMEs, SGSNs).
The MBMS session stop shall be used by the BM-SC to indicate the end of the
data stream for an MBMS bearer service to every MBMS GW that has been
delivering the MBMS bearer service.
## 20.2A MBMS heartbeat
The MBMS heartbeat procedure enables the BM-SC and MBMS GW to detect an SGmb
path failure or the restart of the peer MBMS node, as specified in 3GPP TS
23.007 [104].
The use of this procedure shall be negotiated between the BM-SC and MBMS GW
upon contacting the peer node for the first time.
NOTE: The MBMS Heartbeat procedure however applies per (BM-SC, MBMS GW) pair,
i.e. not per MBMS session.
When this procedure is applied, the BM-SC and MBMS GW shall detect an SGmb
path failure or the restart of the peer MBMS node as specified in clause 29 of
3GPP TS 23.007 [104].
The BM-SC and MBMS GW shall maintain a local restart counter which shall be
incremented monotonically whenever the MBMS node restarts with loss of
previous states.
The MBMS heartbeat message shall include the Restart Counter AVP set to the
local restart counter of the sending node. The Restart-Counter AVP may also be
included in any other SGmb messages e.g. if contacting the peer node for the
first time or if the local restart counter has been incremented.
## 20.3 Message flows
### 20.3.1 Session start procedure
The BM-SC initiates the MBMS session start procedure when it is ready to send
data. This informs the MBMS GW of the imminent start of the transmission and
MBMS session attributes are provided to the MBMS GWs included in the list of
downstream nodes in BM-SC. The bearer plane is allocated.
BM-SC and MBMS GW shall at least support IP unicast encapsulation of IP
multicast datagrams, which shall be default mode of sending user plane data.
BM-SC may support IP multicast encapsulation of user plane IP multicast
datagrams and MBMS GW also may support this mode of operation.
Figure 20.3.1.1: MBMS Session Start procedure
1\. The BM-SC sends an RAR message to indicate the impending start of the
transmission and to provide the session attributes to the MBMS GWs listed in
the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter of the corresponding MBMS Bearer
Context. BM-SC may indicate to MBMS GW that BM-SC supports sending the user
plane IP multicast data without IP unicast encapsulation. In such case BM-SC
shall send multicast source address as specified by IETF RFC 4604 [73] and
IETF RFC 4607 [74] and the user plane multicast destination address.
If IP unicast mode is used, the BM-SC shall also require the MBMS GW to select
one UDP port for the reception of the user plane data for the related MBMS
service (identified by TMGI and Flow ID).
The BM-SC may also indicate its intent to use IP multicast encapsulation of IP
multicast datagrams across Sgi-mb. In this case, the BM-SC shall specify an
Sgi-mb (transport) destination multicast IP address associated with the MBMS
bearer context, as well as the source UDP port. The inclusion of these data
shall mean IP multicast encapsulation of IP multicast datagram is the only
offered multicast mode over Sgi-mb. The destination UDP port for IP multicast
transport shall be fixed as port number 927. The BM-SC shall also specify the
(transport) multicast source address.
The BM-SC shall indicate the M1 interface information of local MBMS
information as specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [112] if the BM-SC determines to
use the local MBMS information.
2\. The MBMS GW creates an MBMS Bearer Context, stores the session attributes
in the MBMS Bearer Context, initiates session start procedure towards the
MMEs/SGSNs in its list of MBMS control plane nodes and sends an RAA message to
the BM-SC. In case MBMS GW receives BM-SC multicast source address, which
indicates BM-SC support for both modes of sending user plane data, MBMS GW
decides in which mode MBMS GW shall receive the user plane data. In case MBMS
GW decides to receive unicast encapsulated data, then MBMS GW shall send own
IP address for user plane to BM-SC and the MBMS GW shall also indicate the UDP
port on which the user plane data shall be received. In case MBMS GW decides
to receive IP multicast packets, then MBMS GW shall join the multicast group
as specified by IETF RFC 4604 [73] and IETF RFC 4607 [74], and indicate to BM-
SC about the decision. In case MBMS GW decides to use M1 interface information
of local MBMS information, the MBMS GW skips the allocation procedure for IP
multicast distribution.
If configured, the MBMS GW sends the RAA message after receiving the first
session start response (when positive) message from any MME.
### 20.3.2 Session update procedure
The BM-SC initiates the MBMS session update procedure when service attributes
(e.g. Service Area, MBMS cell list, Access indicator or ARP) for an ongoing
MBMS session shall be modified. The MBMS session update procedure update
procedure is initiated towards one or more of the MBMS GWs in the list of
downstream nodes in the BM-SC, according to the changes in the service area.
NOTE: In addition, when the MBMS Service Area for an ongoing broadcast session
is changed in the BM-SC, then MBMS GW(s) may be added to, or removed from, the
list of downstream nodes in the BM-SC. The BM-SC will initiate MBMS session
start procedures or MBMS session stop procedures towards these MBMS GWs
accordingly.
The attributes that can be modified by the RAR message are the MBMS Service
Area, the MBMS-Cell-List, the ARP, the Access indicator and the list of MBMS
control plane nodes (MMEs, SGSNs).
When a session update message is received, the MBMS GW updates its MBMS Bearer
Context accordingly and informs its downstream MMEs/SGSNs of the changed
service attributes. If a list of MBMS control plane nodes (MMEs, SGSNs) is
included in the session update message, MBMS GW shall initiate a session start
procedure towards the new MMEs/SGSNs, and a session stop procedure towards the
MMEs/SGSNs that have been removed from the list.
Figure 20.3.2.1: MBMS Session Update procedure
1\. The BM-SC sends an RAR message to all MBMS GWs listed in the \"list of
downstream nodes\" parameter of the affected MBMS Bearer Context to indicate
that the MBMS session is updated.
2\. The MBMS GW stores the new session attributes in the MBMS Bearer Context,
initiates session start, session stop or session update procedure towards the
MMEs/SGSNs in its list of MBMS control plane nodes and sends an RAA message to
the BM-SC. An AAR message is not mandated for the SGmb application in response
to an RAR- RAA command exchange.
### 20.3.3 Session stop procedure
The BM-SC initiates the MBMS session stop procedure when it considers the MBMS
session terminated. Typically this will happen when there is no more MBMS data
expected to be transmitted for a sufficiently long period of time to justify
the release of bearer plane resources in the network.
Figure 20.3.3.1: MBMS Session Stop procedure
1\. The BM-SC sends an RAR message to all MBMS GWs listed in the \"list of
downstream nodes\" parameter of the affected MBMS Bearer Context to indicate
that the MBMS session is terminated and the bearer plane resources can be
released.
2\. The MBMS GW releases the resources regarding the session and sends an RAA
message to the BM-SC. An AAR message is not mandated for the SGmb application
in response to an RAR- RAA command exchange.
### 20.3.4 MBMS session termination (MBMS GW initiated)
Figure 20.3.4.1: MBMS session termination
1\. In exceptional cases (e.g. resource pre-emption or timeout of the MBMS
session), the MBMS GW may send an STR command to the BM-SC to initiate the
termination of the Diameter session related to an MBMS bearer service. If a
bearer plane had been established over SGi-mb for this MBMS bearer service,
the bearer plane is released. If the MBMS GW detects the SGi-mb path failure
as specified in subclause 20.3.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.007 [104], the MBMS GW shall
set the Termination-Cause to \"DIAMETER_LINK_BROKEN\" (see IETF RFC 6733
[111]) and shall include the Diagnostic-Info AVP set to \"User Plane Failure\"
if it tears down the MBMS session as a result of detecting an SGi-mb path
failure.
2\. The BM-SC removes the Diameter session and confirms the operation by
sending an STA message to the MBMS GW.
### 20.3.5 MBMS heartbeat procedure
The BM-SC initiates the MBMS heartbeat procedure to detect a SGmb path failure
or the restart of the MBMS GW as specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [104].
Figure 20.3.5.1: MBMS Heartbeat procedure initiated by the BM-SC
1\. The BM-SC sends an RAR message to the MBMS GW and indicates this is a
heartbeart request. The BM-SC also includes the Restart-Counter AVP set to its
local restart counter.
2\. The MBMS GW sends an RAA message to the BM-SC to acknowledge the heartbeat
request. The MBMS GW also includes the Restart-Counter AVP set to its local
restart counter.
The MBMS GW initiates the MBMS heartbeat procedure to detect a SGmb path
failure or the restart of the BM-SC as specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [104].
Figure 20.3.5.2: MBMS Heartbeat procedure initiated by the MBMS GW
1\. The MBMS GW sends an RAR message to the BM-SC and indicates this is a
heartbeart request. The MBMS GW also includes the Restart-Counter AVP set to
its local restart counter.
2\. The BM-SC sends an RAA message to the MBMS GW to acknowledge the heartbeat
request. The BM-SC also includes the Restart-Counter AVP set to its local
restart counter.
In the context of this procedure, the Diameter session shall be implicitly
terminated, i.e. the client (server) shall behave as if the Auth-Session-State
AVP was set to the value NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1), as described in IETF RFC
6733 [111]. As a consequence, the server shall not maintain any state
information about this session and the client shall not send any session
termination request.
NOTE: The Auth-Session-State AVP is not included in the RAR/RAA message as
this is not permitted by the Diameter base protocol. See IETF RFC 6733 [111].
## 20.4 SGmb Messages
This clause defines the SGmb interface Diameter message.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the SGmb interface are detailed in this
clause. Other Diameter NASREQ (IETF RFC 4005 [67]) AVPs, even if their AVP
flag rules is marked with \"M\", are not required for being compliant with the
current specification.
All SGmb specific AVPs for SGmb are needed to be compliant to the SGmb
interface unless otherwise stated.
### 20.4.1 Re-Auth-Request Command
The Re-Auth-Request (RAR) command, defined in IETF RFC 6733 (DIAMETER BASE)
[111], is indicated by the Command-Code set to 258 and the message flags' 'R'
bit set.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the SGmb interface are detailed in the
ABNF description below. Other valid AVPs for this command are not used for
SGmb purposes and should be ignored by the receiver or processed according to
the relevant specifications.
The bold marked AVPs in the message format indicate new optional AVPs for
SGmb, or modified existing AVPs.

For the MBMS Session Start procedure, RAR is sent by the BM-SC to the MBMS
GW(s) that will deliver the MBMS service when it is ready to send data. This
is a request to activate all necessary bearer resources in the network for the
transfer of MBMS data. The RAR message contains either an Ipv4 address
included in 3GPP-SGSN-Address AVP or an Ipv6 address included in 3GPP-SGSN-
Ipv6-Address AVP for each participating MBMS control plane nodes (MMEs,
SGSNs). The MBMS-Time-to-Data-Transfer AVP shall be included to indicate the
expected time between the reception of the MBMS Session Start and the
transmission of MBMS data flows. For E-UTRAN access, the RAR message may also
contain the MBMS-Data-Transfer-Start AVP containing the absolute time stamp of
the data delivery start. The RAR message shall also contain the MBMS-Service-
Area AVP. If the MBMS Cell List feature is supported, or if the BM-SC does not
yet know whether the MBMS-GW supports this feature, the RAR may contain the
MBMS-Cell-List AVP. For the distributed MCE architectures, i.e. when the MCE
is part of eNB as described in clause 15.1.1 in TS 36.300 [98], the MBMS-Data-
Transfer-Start AVP should be used at MBSFN operation mode to ensure
synchronized session control and to facilitate a graceful reallocation of
resources for the MBSFN when needed. The RAR message shall also contain the
Local-M1-Information AVP if the BM-SC determines to use the local MBMS
information as specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [112].
The MBMS-Flags AVP may provide specific control indications in relation to
MBMS, e.g. whether the MBMS Session Start procedure is used to re-establish an
MBMS session.
For the MBMS Session Update procedure, RAR is sent by the BM-SC in order for
the MBMS GW(s) to update their session attributes. If the MBMS service area or
the MBMS cell list needs to be changed, the MBMS-Service-Area AVP shall be
included in the RAR. If the MBMS Cell List feature is supported and the MBMS
cell list needs to be changed, the MBMS-Cell-List AVP shall also be included.
If the MBMS-Service-Area AVP but no MBMS-Cell-List AVP is included, this shall
indicate that any MBMS Cell List included in a previous RAR does no longer
apply. If the Access indicator needs to be updated, it shall be included in
the MBMS-Access-Indicator AVP. For E-UTRAN access, the RAR message may also
contain the MBMS-Data-Transfer-Start AVP containing the absolute time stamp of
the data delivery start. For the distributed MCE architectures, i.e. when the
MCE is part of eNB as described in clause 15.1.1 in TS 36.300 [98], the MBMS-
Data-Transfer-Start AVP should be used at MBSFN operation mode to ensure
synchronized session control and to facilitate a graceful reallocation of
resources for the MBSFN when needed. The MBMS-StartStop-Indication AVP with
the value UPDATE shall be included. The MBMS-Time-To-Data-Transfer with AVP
the value set to 0 shall be included. The MBMS-Session-Duration AVP shall be
included to indicate the duration of the remaining part of the MBMS session.
The 3GPP-SGSN-Address AVP and the 3GPP-SGSN-Ipv6-Address AVP shall be included
if the related lists of MBMS control plane nodes (MMEs, SGSNs) in the MBMS
GW(s) have changed. If the ARP needs to be changed, the QoS-Information AVP
shall be included. The other bold marked AVPs shall be included as given by
the previous, corresponding MBMS Session Start procedure.
For the MBMS Session Stop procedure, RAR is sent by the BM-SC to the MBMS
GW(s) when it considers the MBMS session to be terminated. The session is
typically terminated when there is no more MBMS data expected to be
transmitted for a sufficiently long period of time to justify a release of
bearer plane resources in the network. For E-UTRAN access, the RAR message may
also contain the MBMS-Data-Transfer-Stop AVP containing the absolute time
stamp of the data delivery stop. The MBMS-Flags AVP may provide specific
control indications, e.g. whether the MBMS Session Stop procedure is used to
release the MBMS bearer context locally.
For the MBMS Session Start procedure, the Qos-Information AVP indicates the
QoS that is required for the MBMS bearer service for the actual MBMS session.
Only the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP, Max-Requested-Bandwidth-DL AVP, Guaranteed-
Bitrate-DL AVP and Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP within the QoS-
Information AVP are applicable for the MBMS bearer service. The MBMS-Service-
Area AVP is passed from BM-SC transparently through MBMS GW to the
MMEs/SGSN(s) that are relevant for the actual MBMS bearer service. The MBMS-
Cell-List AVP is also passed transparently through MBMS GW to the MMEs. The
MBMS-Access-Indicator AVP indicates in which radio access types the MBMS
bearer service shall be broadcasted, i.e UTRAN, or E-UTRAN, or both.
The usage of MBMS-StartStop-Indication AVP, Session-Id AVP, Framed-IP-Address
AVP, Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP, Framed-Interface-Id AVP, Called-Station-Id AVP
and MBMS-Flow-Identifier AVP can refer to Gmb interface as described in clause
17.6.5.
If unicast mode is used, the MBMS GW shall select an IP unicast address and a
destination UDP port that is unique within the MBMS GW or that IP unicast
address.
If IP multicast encapsulation of application IP multicast datagram is used
over Sgi-mb, the BM-SC shall select a source UDP port that is unique within
the BM-SC for that IP multicast address.
For the MBMS Heartbeat procedure, RAR is sent by the BM-SC to the MBMS GW, or
vice-versa. The RAR message shall contain the following AVPs:
\- the MBMS-StartStop-Indication AVP set to the value \"heartbeat\";
\- the Restart-Counter AVP set to the local restart counter of the sender.

of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session
establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used
to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise
stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the SGmb reference point
shall be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported
features and associated error handling on the Cx reference point as defined in
clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [105].
The base functionality for the SGmb reference point is the 3GPP Rel-11
standard and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin
host does not support any features beyond the base functionality, the
Supported-Features AVP may be absent from the SGmb commands. As defined in
clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [105], when extending the application by adding
new AVPs for a feature, the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP
shall not be defined mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [105], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the SGmb reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the SGmb reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [105]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial RAR/RAA command pair:
\- If the BM-SC supporting post-Rel-11 SGmb functionality is able to
interoperate with a MBMS GW supporting Rel-11, the RAR shall include the
features supported by the BM-SC within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the 'M'
bit cleared. Otherwise, the RAR shall include the supported features within
the Supported-Features AVP(s) with the M-bit set.
NOTE 1: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the RAR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the
MBMS GW supports Rel-11 SGmb functionality, the RAA command shall not include
the Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both BM-SC and MBMS GW shall behave
as specified in the Rel-11 version of this document.
\- If the RAR command contains the Supported-Features AVP, the MBMS GW shall
include the Supported-Features AVP in the RAA command, with the 'M' bit
cleared, indicating only the features that both the BM-SC and MBMS GW support.
NOTE 2: The client will always declare all features that are supported
according to table 20.7.1. When more than one feature identifying a release is
supported by both BM-SC and MBMS GW, the BM-SC will work according to the
latest common supported release.
Once the BM-SC and MBMS GW have negotiated the set of supported features
during session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during
the lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable to the SGmb interface for the
feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Interworking PCS1900 with PSDNs
Void.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Rate control related to Cellular Internet Of
Things (CIoT) optimisations
# B.1 General
The present annex defines specific requirements for rate control related to
CIoT optimisations.
# B.2 Support of rate control of user data
## B.2.0 General
The rate of user data sent to and from a UE (e.g. a UE using CIoT EPS
Optimizations) can be controlled in two different ways:
\- Serving PLMN rate control
\- APN rate control
Serving PLMN rate control is further described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [77].
The APN rate control parameters are a part of the configuration data stored in
the GGSN/PGW and is configured on per APN basis.
APN rate control allows HPLMN operators on per APN and user to control the
amount of user data sent DL and UL.\ This is done with help of policing user
data on a maximum number of user data packets per time unit both DL and UL.
APN rate control DL policing is done in the GGSN/PGW or the SCEF and the APN
rate control policing UL is done in the UE. The GGSN/PGW or SCEF can also do
APN rate control UL policing.\ For further information on APN rate control UL
in the UE, see 3GPP TS 24.301 [84].\ For further information on APN rate
control in the SCEF, see 3GPP TS 29.128 [110].
NOTE: Existing AMBR mechanisms are not suitable for such a service since, for
radio efficiency and UE battery life reasons, an AMBR of e.g. > 100kbit/s is
desirable and such an AMBR translates to a potentially large daily data
volume.
## B.2.1 APN Rate Control in the PGW
To enable APN rate control it shall be configured in the PGW per APN.
The APN rate control parameters, if configured, shall consist of:
\- the maximum number of DL user data packets per time unit,
\- the maximum number of UL user data packets per time unit,
\- an indication whether the UE is allowed to send additional exception
reports when the limit for the UL APN rate control has been reached , and
\- if UE supports it, the maximum number of additional UL exception reports
per time unit.
Possible time units shall be, minute, hour, day or week.\ \ If the UE does not
indicate APN rate control support, the GGSN/PGW may refrain from providing APN
rate control information to the UE.
NOTE 1: The UE indicates support for APN rate control with help of an
indicator in the Protocol Configuration Options IE (PCO IE) or the Extended
Protocol Configuration Options IE (ePCO IE), see 3GPP TS 24.008 [54] or 3GPP
TS 24.301 [84] for IE definition. The APN rate control indicator within the
PCO/ePCO IE is received at IP-CAN session establishment.
NOTE 2: The UE and network support of the ePCO IE, is indicated with help of
the Indication IE. The ePCO support indication within the Indication IE can be
received at IP-CAN session establishment or at IP-CAN session modification.
See 3GPP TS 29.274 [81] for IE definition.
If the APN rate control is supported by the UE and the Indication IE is
received indicating support of ePCO IE at the IP-CAN session establishment
request and the PGW supports the ePCO IE, the PGW shall in the reply, if
configured for the APN used, include APN UL rate control parameters in the
ePCO IE, see 3GPP TS 24.008 [54] for IE definition.\ If the ePCO IE is not
supported the PGW shall use the PCO IE.\ The GGSN shall use the PCO IE.
If the APN rate control UL parameter(s) is modified and the ePCO IE is
supported, the PGW shall initiate an IP-CAN session modification procedure and
include the APN UL rate control parameters in the ePCO IE.\ If the ePCO IE is
not supported the PGW shall use the PCO IE.\ The GGSN shall use the PCO IE.
The GGSN/PGW shall enforce the APN rate control per UE and APN according to
the configuration for DL and may enforce APN rate control for UL, e.g. when
the PGW have indicated to the UE that the UE is not allowed to send exception
reports when the limit for the UL APN rate control has been reached.
NOTE 3: The UE locally enforces this uplink APN rate control instruction. The
UE considers this APN rate control instruction as valid until it receives a
new one from the GGSN/PGW.
## B.2.2 Serving PLMN Rate Control information handling in the PGW
If Serving PLMN rate control information is received in the Serving PLMN Rate
Control IE from the MME, the PGW shall store this information and use that for
rate control enforcement DL for this UE.\ If the PGW previously have received
Serving PLMN rate control information, the PGW shall behave as follows:
\- If the PGW receives new Serving PLMN rate control information in the
Serving PLMN Rate Control IE from the MME, the PGW shall replace the old
Serving PLMN rate control information with the new Serving PLMN rate control
information and use that for rate control enforcement DL for this UE.
\- If the PGW receives no Serving PLMN rate control information in the Serving
PLMN Rate Control IE from the MME in an IP-CAN session establishment or an IP-
CAN session modification , the PGW shall still consider the latest received
Serving PLMN rate control information from the MME as valid.
\- If PGW receives an indication that Serving PLMN rate control does not apply
in the Serving PLMN Rate Control IE, the PGW shall remove the rate control
information based on Serving PLMN rate control information.
See 3GPP TS 29.274 [81] for Serving PLMN Rate Control IE definition.
APN rate control, if configured, also applies for the same IP-CAN session, see
subclause B.2.1.
