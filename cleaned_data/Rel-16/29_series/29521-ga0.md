# 4 Binding Support Management Service
## 4.1 Service Description
### 4.1.1 Overview
The Binding Support Management Service as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and
3GPP TS 23.503 [4], is provided by the Binding Support Function (BSF).
The Nbsf_Management service is used to provide a PDU session binding
functionality, which ensures that an AF request for a certain PDU Session
reaches the relevant PCF holding that PDU Session information, or ensures that
the same PCF is selected for multiple PDU sessions.
This service:
\- allows NF service consumers to register, update and remove binding
information; and
\- allows NF service consumers to retrieve binding information.
### 4.1.2 Service Architecture
The 5G System Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The Policy and
Charging related 5G architecture is also described in 3GPP TS 23.503 [4] and
3GPP TS 29.513 [5].
The Binding Support Management Service (Nbsf_Management) is exhibited by the
Binding Support Function (BSF).
The known consumers of the Nbsf_Management service are:
\- Policy Control Function (PCF)
\- Network Exposure Function (NEF)
\- Application Function (AF); and
\- Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF)
As described in 3GPP TS 23.503 [4], the BSF is a function that can be deployed
standalone or as a functionality provided by other network functions, such as
PCF, UDR, NRF, SMF.
NOTE 1: The PCF accesses the Nbsf_Management service at the BSF via an
internal interface when it is collocated with BSF.
NOTE 2: The DRA decides to select a BSF based on user IP address range when
the DRA has no binding information for the subscriber to get the relevant PCF
address. DRA and BSF coexistence is described in 3GPP TS 29.513 [5], Annex A.

### 4.1.3 Network Functions
#### 4.1.3.1 Binding Support Function (BSF)
The BSF:
\- stores the binding information for a certain PDU Session; and
\- enables the discovery of binding information (e.g. the address information
of the selected PCF).
The BSF allows NF service consumers (e.g. PCF) to register, update and remove
a binding information, and allows NF service consumers (e.g. AF, NEF, NWDAF)
to discover a binding information (e.g. the address information of the
selected PCF).
The BSF can be deployed standalone or collocated with other network functions,
such as PCF, UDR, NRF and SMF.
#### 4.1.3.2 NF Service Consumers
The Policy Control Function (PCF):
\- registers binding information in the BSF for a UE when an IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix is allocated, or a MAC address is used for the PDU session;
\- updates binding information in the BSF when a UE address information is
changed for the PDU Session; and
\- removes binding information in the BSF when an IPv4 address and/or IPv6
prefix is released, or a MAC address is not used for the PDU Session.
The Network Exposure Function (NEF):
\- provides means for the Application Functions to securely interact with the
Policy framework for policy control to 3GPP network. During the procedure, it
needs to discover the selected PCF by using the Nbsf_Management_Discovery
service operation.
The Application Function (AF):
\- discovers the selected PCF by using the Nbsf_Management_Discovery service
operation when it is allowed to interact directly with the policy framework
for policy control.
The Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF):
\- discovers the selected PCF by using the Nbsf_Management_Discovery service
operation.

* * *
### 4.2.2 Nbsf_Management_Register Service Operation
#### 4.2.2.1 General
This service operation allows a NF service consumer (e.g. PCF) to register the
session binding information for a UE in the BSF by providing the user
identity, the DNN, the UE address(es) and the selected PCF address for a
certain PDU Session to the BSF, and BSF stores the information.
If the BindingUpdate feature is not supported and the NF service consumer
(e.g. PCF) receives a new UE address (e.g. IPv6 prefix) and has already
registered session binding information for this PDU session, the NF service
consumer (e.g. PCF) shall register a new session binding information in the
BSF.
If the SamePcf feature or the ExtendedSamePcf feature is supported, this
service operation allows the PCF to check whether PCF addressing information
for Npcf_SMPolicyControl service is already registered in the BSF by another
PCF for a combination of the UE ID, DNN and S-NSSAI parameters of the PDU
session.
#### 4.2.2.2 Register a new PCF Session binding information
{width="6.031944444444444in" height="1.4694444444444446in"}
Figure 4.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer register a new PCF Session binding
information
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nbsf_Management_Register service
operation to register the session binding information for a UE in the BSF. The
NF service consumer shall send for this an HTTP POST request with
\"{apiRoot}/nbsf-management/v1/pcfBindings\" as Resource URI representing the
\"PCF Session Bindings\", as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 1, to create a
binding information for an \"Individual PCF Session Binding\" according to the
information (e.g. UE address(es), SUPI, GPSI, DNN, S-NSSAI) in the message
body. When the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is not supported, the
\"PcfBinding\" data structure provided in the request body shall include:
\- if the \"MultiUeAddr\" feature is not supported or not yet known, address
information of the served UE consisting of:
(i) either IP address information consisting of:
\+ the IPv4 address encoded as \"ipv4Addr\" attribute; and/or
\+ the /128 IPv6 address, the IPv6 address prefix or an IPv6 prefix shorter
than /64 encoded as \"ipv6Prefix\" attribute; or
(ii) the MAC address encoded as \"macAddr48\" attribute;
> Otherwise, address information of the served UE consisting of:
(i) any IP address information consisting of:
\+ the IPv4 address encoded as \"ipv4Addr\" attribute;
\+ the /128 IPv6 address, the IPv6 address prefix or an IPv6 prefix shorter
than /64 encoded as \"ipv6Prefix\" attribute; and/or
\+ the additional /128 IPv6 addresses, the IPv6 address prefixes or IPv6
prefixes shorter than /64 encoded as \"addIpv6Prefixes\" attribute; or
(ii) the MAC address encoded as \"macAddr48\" attribute and/or the additional
MAC addresses encoded as \"addMacAddrs\" attribute;
\- PCF address information consisting of:
(i) if the PCF supports the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service:
\+ the FQDN of the PCF encoded as \"pcfFqdn\" attribute; and/or
\+ a description of IP endpoints at the PCF hosting the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service encoded as \"pcfIpEndPoints\" attribute; and
(ii) if the PCF supports the Rx interface:
\+ the Diameter host id of the PCF encoded as \"pcfDiamHost\"; and
\+ the Diameter realm of the PCF encoded as\"pcfDiamRealm\" attributes;
\- DNN encoded as \"dnn\" attribute;
\- S-NSSAI encoded as \"snssai\" attribute; and
\- if the \"SamePcf\" feature defined in subclause 5.8 is supported and the
PCF determines based on operator policies that the same PCF shall be selected
for the SM Policy associations:
(i) PCF address information for Npcf_SMPolicyControl service consisting of:
\+ the FQDN of the PCF encoded as \"pcfSmFqdn\" attribute; or
\+ a description of IP endpoints at the PCF hosting the Npcf_SMPolicyControl
service encoded as \"pcfSmIpEndPoints\" attribute; and
(ii) the parameters combination for selecting the same PCF encoded within the
\"paraCom\" attribute if the PCF registers the binding information for the
indicated parameter combination for the first time.
NOTE 1: When the \"SamePcf\" feature is supported, the PCF omits the
\"paraCom\" attribute when creates the corresponding binding information
related to the subsequent PDU sessions for the same parameter combination.
and may include:
\- SUPI encoded as \"supi\" attribute;
\- GPSI encoded as \"gpsi\" attribute;
\- IPv4 address domain encoded as \"ipDomain\" attribute; and
\- framed routes consisting of:
(i) one or more framed routes within the \"ipv4FrameRouteList\" attribute for
IPv4; and/or
(ii) one or more framed routes within the \"ipv6FrameRouteList\" attribute for
IPv6.
When the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" feature is supported by the PCF as
defined in subclause 5.8 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [21], the address information of
the served UE contains the MAC address of the DS-TT encoded in the
\"macAddr48\" attribute as received by the PCF when reporting the bridge
information attribute.
When the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported the address information of
the served UE may be provided if available, i.e., the \"ipv4Addr\", the
\"ipv6Prefix\" and/or \"addIpv6Prefixes\" attributes or the \"macAddr48\"
and/or \"addMacAddrs\" attributes may be provided if available.
When the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported the PCF address for the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization and/or Rx interface may be provided if available,
i.e., the \"pcfFqdn\" and/or the \"pcfIpEndPoints\" attributes, and/or the
\"pcfDiamHost\" and/or the \"pcfDiamRealm\" attributes may be provided if
available.
NOTE 2: Before requesting the BSF to check if there is an existing PCF binding
information for the same UE ID, S-NSSAI and DNN combination registered by
other PCF(s), the PCF determines whether the BSF supports the \"SamePcf\"
and/or \"ExtendedSamePcf\" features either via local configuration or by
checking the BSF profile retrieved from the NRF as specified in 3GPP TS 29.510
[12].
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nbsf-
management/v1/pcfBindings\" as Resource URI and \"PcfBinding\" data structure
as request body, the BSF shall:
\- create new binding information;
\- assign a bindingId; and
\- store the binding information.
The PCF as NF service consumer may provide PCF Id in \"pcfId\" attribute and
recovery timestamp in \"recoveryTime\" attribute. The BSF may use the
\"pcfId\" attribute to supervise the status of the PCF as described in
subclause 5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.510 [12] and perform necessary clean up upon
status change of the PCF later, and/or both the \"pcfId\" attribute and the
\"recoveryTime\" attribute in clean up procedure as described in subclause 6.4
of 3GPP TS 23.527 [17].
The PCF as a NF service consumer may provide PCF Set Id within the
\"pcfSetId\" attribute and \"bindLevel\" attribute set to NF_SET or provide
PCF Set Id within the \"pcfSetId\" attribute, PCF instance Id within the
\"pcfId\" attribute and \"bindLevel\" attribute set to NF_INSTANCE.
If the BSF created an \"Individual PCF Session Binding\" resource, the BSF
shall respond with \"201 Created\" status code with the message body
containing a representation of the created binding information, as shown in
figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 2. The BSF shall include a Location HTTP header field
containing the URI of the created binding information, i.e. \"{apiRoot}/nbsf-
management/v1/pcfBindings/{bindingId}\".
If errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the PCF shall apply
error handling procedures as specified in subclause 5.7.
If the \"SamePcf\" feature defined in subclause 5.8 is supported and the
\"paraCom\" attribute is included in the HTTP POST message, the BSF shall
check the received \"paraCom\" attribute. If the BSF detects that there is an
existing PCF binding information including the same \"dnn\", \"snssai\" and
\"supi\" attribute values as each of the corresponding attribute values within
the \"paraCom\" attribute, the BSF shall reject the request with an HTTP \"403
Forbidden\" status code and shall include in the response the
\"ExtProblemDetails\" data structure including the FQDN of the existing PCF
hosting the Npcf_SMPolicyControl service within the \"pcfSmFqdn\" attribute or
the description of IP endpoints at the existing PCF hosting the
Npcf_SMPolicyControl service within the \"pcfSmIpEndPoints\" attribute of
\"BindingResp\" data structure, and the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure set to \"EXISTING_BINDING_INFO_FOUND\".
### 4.2.3 Nbsf_Management_Deregister Service Operation
#### 4.2.3.1 General
This service operation allows the service consumer to remove the session
binding information for a UE in the BSF. It is executed by deleting a given
resource identified by an \"Individual PCF Session Binding\" resource
identifier. The operation is invoked by issuing an HTTP DELETE request on the
URI representing the specific session binding information.
#### 4.2.3.2 Deregister an individual PCF Session binding information
Figure 4.2.3.2-1: Session Binding Information Deregistration
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nbsf_Management_Deregister service
operation to deregister the session binding information for a UE in the BSF.
The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with
\"{apiRoot}/nbsf-management/v1/pcfBindings/{bindingId}\" as Resource URI,
where \"{bindingId}\" is the \"Individual PCF Session Binding\" resource
identifier that is to be deleted, as shown in figure 4.2.3.2-1, step 1.
Upon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nbsf-
management/v1/pcfBindings/{bindingId}\" as Resource URI, the BSF shall:
\- remove the corresponding binding information.
If the HTTP DELETE request message from the NF service consumer is accepted,
the BSF shall respond with \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure
4.2.3.2-1, step 2.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the BSF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in subclause 5.7.
If the Individual PCF Session Binding resource does not exist, the BSF shall
respond with \"404 Not Found\" error code.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the BSF determines the received
HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the BSF shall send an HTTP
redirect response as specified in subclause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
### 4.2.4 Nbsf_Management_Discovery Service Operation
#### 4.2.4.1 General
This service operation allows the service consumer to use the HTTP GET method
to obtain the address information of the selected PCF.
#### 4.2.4.2 Retrieve the PCF Session binding information for a given tuple
{width="6.0256944444444445in" height="1.64375in"}
Figure 4.2.4.2-1: NF service consumer retrieve the PCF Session binding
information for a given tuple
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nbsf_Management_Discovery service
operation to obtain address information of the selected PCF for a PDU session
in the BSF. The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP GET request with
\"{apiRoot}/nbsf-management/v1/pcfBindings\" as Resource URI, and \"query
parameters\" that shall include:
\- UE address;
and may include:
\- SUPI or GPSI;
\- DNN and optionally S-NSSAI; and
\- IPv4 address domain.
NOTE: The query parameters S-NSSAI and/or IPv4 address domain are helpful in
the scenario of IPv4 address overlapping where the same IPv4 address may be
allocated to UE PDU sessions.
Upon the reception of an HTTP GET request with: \"{apiRoot}/nbsf-
management/v1/pcfBindings\" as Resource URI, the BSF shall search the
corresponding binding information. If \"ipv6Prefix\" is used as an UE IPv6
address in the query parameters, the BSF shall use the longest prefix match to
find a matching IPv6 prefix so that the IPv6 address in the query parameters
is within the address range covered by that matching IPv6 prefix. The IPv6
address in the query parameters shall be formatted as an IPv6 prefix value
including the trailing prefix length \"/128\". If the framed routes exist in
the binding information, the BSF shall use framed routes to match the UE
address in the query parameters.
If the HTTP request message from the NF service consumer is accepted and a
session binding resource matching the query parameters exists, the BSF shall
reply with an HTTP \"200 OK\" response, as shown in figure 4.2.4.2-1, step 2,
containing the corresponding \"PcfBinding\" data structure, as provided by the
PCF during the Nbsf_Management_Register Service Operation, in the response
body containing PCF addressing information, and if available, the related PCF
Set Id and PCF instance Id. If there is no PCF session binding information
matching the query parameters, the BSF shall respond with an HTTP \"204 No
Content\".
NOTE 2: If the NF service consumer (such as the AF or NEF) is not able to
reach the received PCF address(es), the NF service consumer can use the PCF
Set Id and the PCF instance Id as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 [5] subclause
6.2.
If the \"PCF Session Bindings\" resource does not exist, the BSF shall respond
with \"404 Not Found\" HTTP error code. If an invalid combination of query
parameters (i.e. a combination without UE address) is contained in the request
URI, the BSF shall respond with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error code
containing \"MANDATORY_QUERY_PARAM_MISSING\" as application error within the
ProblemDetails IE. If more than one PCF Session Binding resources are found,
the BSF shall respond with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error code containing
\"MULTIPLE_BINDING_INFO_FOUND\" as application error within the ProblemDetails
IE.
### 4.2.5 Nbsf_Management_Update Service Operation
#### 4.2.5.1 General
This service operation allows the NF service consumer to update an existing
session binding information for a UE in the BSF by providing information to be
updated (e.g. the UE address(es)) for a PDU Session, and BSF updates the
session binding information.
#### 4.2.5.2 Update an existing PCF Session binding information
{width="5.990277777777778in" height="1.6493055555555556in"}
Figure 4.2.5.2-1: NF service consumer update an existing PCF Session binding
information
If the feature \"BindingUpdate\" is supported, the NF service consumer shall
invoke the Nbsf_Management_Update service operation to update the session
binding information for a UE in the BSF. The NF service consumer shall send an
HTTP PATCH request with \"{apiRoot}/nbsf-
management/v1/pcfBindings/{bindingId}\" as Resource URI, where \"{bindingId}\"
is the \"Individual PCF Session Binding\" resource identifier that is to be
updated, as shown in figure 4.2.5.2-1, step 1. The \"PcfBindingPatch\" data
structure provided in the request body shall contain the information to be
updated as follows.
The \"PcfBindingPatch\" data structure:
\- for the IP address information of the served UE:
a) shall contain the \"ipv4Addr\" attribute if the IPv4 address is modified,
or if the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported, if the IPv4 address was
not previously provided, and may contain the \"ipDomain\" attribute if the
IPv4 address domain is modified or if the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is
supported, if the IPv4 address domain was not previously provided and applies.
To remove the IPv4 address the \"ipv4Addr\" attribute shall be set to \"null\"
and if applicable, the \"ipDomain\" attribute shall be set to \"null\"; and/or
b) shall contain the \"ipv6Prefix\" attribute if the IPv6 address information
is modified, or if the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported, if the IPv6
address information was not previously provided. The \"ipv6Prefix\" attribute
shall be set to \"null\" if the IPv6 address information is removed; and/or
c) if the \"MultiUeAddr\" feature is supported, shall contain:
1) the \"addIpv6Prefixes\" attribute containing the new complete list of
additional IPv6 Address Prefixes if the additional IPv6 address information is
modified, or if the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported, the current list
of IPv6 address prefixes if it was not previously provided; or
2) the \"addIpv6Prefixes\" attribute set to \"null\" if all additional IPv6
Address Prefixes are removed; or
\- for the MAC address information of the served UE:
a) shall contain the \"macAddr48\" attribute if the MAC address is modified,
or if the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported, if the MAC address was not
previously provided. The \"macAddr48\" attribute shall be set to \"null\" if
the MAC address is removed; and/or
b) if the \"MultiUeAddr\" feature is supported, shall contain:
1) the \"addMacAddrs\" attribute containing the new complete list of
additional MAC addresses if the additional MAC address information is
modified, or if the \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is supported, the current list
of MAC address(es) if it was not previously provided; or
2) the \"addMacAddrs\" attribute set to \"null\" if all additional MAC
addresses are removed; or
\- for the PCF instance and the associated PCF address information of the PCF
holding the SM policy association, should contain if a new PCF instance is
selected:
a) the PCF instance ID encoded as \"pcfId\" attribute;
b) if the PCF supports the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service:
1) the FQDN of the PCF encoded as \"pcfFqdn\" attribute; and/or
2) a description of IP endpoints at the PCF hosting the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service encoded as \"pcfIpEndPoints\" attribute;
and/or
c) if the PCF supports the Rx interface:
1) the Diameter host id of the PCF encoded as \"pcfDiamHost\"; and
2) the Diameter realm of the PCF and \"pcfDiamRealm\" attributes.
If the BSF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP PATCH request due to
the internal BSF error or due to the error in the HTTP PATCH request, the BSF
shall send the HTTP error response as specified in subclause 5.7.
Otherwise, upon the reception of the HTTP PATCH request with:
\"{apiRoot}/nbsf-management/v1/pcfBindings/{bindingId}\" as Resource URI and
the \"PcfBindingPatch\" data structure as request body, the BSF shall update
the binding information.
If the BSF successfully updated an \"Individual PCF Session Binding\"
resource, the BSF shall respond with \"200 OK\" status code with the message
body containing the resource representation with the updated session binding
information in the \"PcfBinding\" data structure, as shown in figure
4.2.5.2-1, step 2.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP PATCH request, the BSF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in subclause 5.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the BSF determines the received
HTTP PATCH request needs to be redirected, the BSF shall send an HTTP redirect
response as specified in subclause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].

## 5.7 Error handling
### 5.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in subclause 5.2.4 of 3GPP
TS 29.500 [6].
For the Nbsf_Management Service API, HTTP error responses shall be supported
as specified in subclause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [7]. Protocol errors and
application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] shall be
supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are
specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6].
In addition, the requirements in the following subclauses shall apply.
### 5.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no additional protocol errors
applicable for the Nbsf_Management Service API.
### 5.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nbsf_Management Service API are listed
in table 5.7.3-1.
Table 5.7.3-1: Application errors
+------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | Application Error | HTTP status code | Description | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | MULTIPLE | 400 Bad Request | Indicates that the BSF | | _BINDING_INFO_FOUND | | found more than one | | | | binding resource so it | | | | cannot provide the | | | | selected PCF to the | | | | consumer. (NOTE 1) | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | EXISTING | 403 Forbidden | Indicates that the BSF | | _BINDING_INFO_FOUND | | found an existing PCF | | | | binding information | | | | for the indicated | | | | combination. (NOTE 2) | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | NOTE 1: This | | | | application error is | | | | included in the | | | | responses to the GET | | | | request. | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: This | | | | application error is | | | | included in the | | | | responses to the POST | | | | request. | | | | | | | | NOTE 3: Including a | | | | \"ProblemDetails\" | | | | data structure with | | | | the \"cause\" | | | | attribute in the HTTP | | | | response is optional | | | | unless explicitly | | | | mandated in the | | | | service operation | | | | subclauses. | | | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+
## 5.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.8-1 are defined for the Nbsf_Management
Service API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism
defined in subclause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
Table 5.8-1: Supported Features
* * *
Feature number Feature Name Description
1 MultiUeAddr This feature indicates the support of multiple UE addresses
(IPv6 prefixes or MAC addresses) in the same binding information.
2 BindingUpdate The consumer can use this feature for updating the session
binding information.
3 SamePcf This feature indicates the support of same PCF selection for the
indicated combination.\ (NOTE)
4 ES3XX Extended Support for 3xx redirections. This feature indicates the
support of redirection for any service operation, according to Stateless NF
procedures as specified in subclauses 6.5.3.2 and 6.5.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[6] and according to HTTP redirection principles for indirect communication,
as specified in subclause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
5 ExtendedSamePcf This feature extends the support of same PCF selection for
the indicated combination. This feature requires the support of SamePcf
feature.\ (NOTE)
NOTE: The \"SamePcf\" feature is applicable to the deployments where the N5
and/or Rx interface apply and the UE address is available in the PCF at the
creation of the SM Policy Association. The \"ExtendedSamePcf\" feature is
applicable for any PCF deployment, regardless of UE address availability at
the creation of SM Policy association and/or N5 and/or Rx applicability.
* * *
## 5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [15] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nbsf_Management API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 [16]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [12])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, a n NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services
offered by the Nbsf_Management API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], subclause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nbsf_Management service.
The Nbsf_Management API defines a single scope \"nbsf-management\" for the
entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or
operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [11] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Nbsf_Management API.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API.
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification file contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[18] and subclause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [7] for further information).

###### ## Annex B (informative): Deployment option to support BSF and DRA
coexistence due to network migration
As described in Annex B of 3GPP TS 23.503 [4], the Diameter Routing Agent
(DRA) and the BSF can coexist in an operator\'s network during the network
migration to 5GC. The DRA is described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [14] and can be a
service consumer of the Nbsf_Management service.
During the Rx session establishment, the DRA can discover the selected PCF for
the related subscriber by using the Nbsf_Management_Discovery service
operation to obtain the related PCF address if it has no stored binding
information derived from an ongoing Gx session for that subscriber.
NOTE 1: For a UE in the EPC there is a Gx session and the DRA stores the
binding information. For a UE in the 5GC the Npcf_SmPolicyControl service is
used and the BSF stores the binding information.
NOTE 2: If the DRA has no stored binding information derived from an ongoing
Gx session for a subscriber, the DRA needs to request new binding information
for each Rx session establishment because the information in the BSF could
have changed compared to any previous binding information the DRA requested.
