### 5.2.2 Service Operations
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
See Table 5.2.1-1 for an overview of the service operations supported by the
Nnssaaf_NSSAA service.
#### 5.2.2.2 Authenticate
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
The Authenticate service operation permits the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the
AMF) to initiate slice-specific authentication and authorization, e.g. during
a UE Registration procedure or upon reception of a re-authentication
notification from the NSSAAF (see clause 5.2.2.3). The NSSAAF may relay the
EAP message to an AAA-S and collect the result of slice-specific
authentication and authorization from the AAA-S, as specified in clause
4.2.9.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], and clause 16.3 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8].
The NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) shall send a POST request to the
resource representing slice authentication collection (i.e. .../v1/slice-
authentications) to request the NSSAAF to create the corresponding resource
context and perform slice-specific authentication and authorization.
Figure 5.2.2.2.1-1: Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
1\. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request to the NSSAAF,
targeting the resource of slice authentication collection (i.e. .../v1/slice-
authentications), to perform slice-specific authentication and authorization.
The payload of the body shall contain the slice authentication information,
which includes:
\- UE ID (i.e. GPSI)
\- S-NSSAI
\- EAP ID Response message (if it is received from the UE), or the EAP ID
Response message with EAP ID stored, or the EAP ID Response message with Null
value (if EAP ID is not requested or received);
\- optionally, the callback URI of the AMF to receive re-authentication
notification from the NSSAAF;
\- optionally, the callback URI of the AMF to receive revocation notification
from the NSSAAF.
Based on local policy, the AMF may determine to provide callback URI(s) for
receiving re-authentication notification or revocation notification. For
example, the callback URIs are provided for an UE identified with low mobility
characteristic.
If Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization is triggered by the AMF
during a Registration procedure as described in clause 4.2.9.2 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [3], the AMF shall set \"status\" attribute for the given slice listed
in \"nssaaStatusList\" attribute to \"PENDING\" (See 3GPP TS 29.518 [16]).
2\. The NSSAAF creates slice authentication context for the UE, and starts the
slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure. If the AAA-S is
involved in slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure, the
NSSAAF shall forward the EAP ID Response message to the AAA-S if the EAP ID
Response message does not contain the Null value. Depending on the result,
either step 3a or step 3b is performed. The NSSAAF obtains the AAA-S address
from local configuration, based on S-NSSAI.
3a. On success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The \"Location\" header
shall contain the URI of the created resource (e.g. .../v1/slice-
authentications/{authCtxId}). The payload body shall contain the slice
authentication context, which includes the EAP message generated by the NSSAAF
or from the AAA-S. The NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) shall forward the
received EAP message to the UE in NAS message, as specified in clause 4.2.9.2
of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
3b. On failure, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1 shall be
returned with the message body containing a ProblemDetails structure with the
\"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table
6.1.7.3-1. If the slice is not authorized, the NSSAAF shall use the
\"SLICE_AUTH_REJECTED\" application error code.
3c. On redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"307 Temporary
Redirect\") shall be returned. A RedirectResponse IE may be included in the
payload body of POST response, as specified in table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3.
4\. Once receiving EAP message from the UE, the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the
AMF) shall send a PUT request to the NSSAAF, targeting the resource of the
slice authentication context (i.e. .../v1/slice-authentications/{authCtxId}).
The payload body shall carry the slice authentication confirmation data which
includes:
\- UE ID (i.e. GPSI)
\- S-NSSAI
\- AAA-S address
\- EAP Message (which is received from the UE)
5\. The NSSAAF checks and confirms the slice-specific authentication and
authorization. If the AAA-S is involved, the NSSAAF shall forward the EAP
Message to the AAA-S to confirm the slice-specific authentication and
authorization. Depending on the result, either step 6a or step 6b is
performed.
6a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. The payload body shall contain
the slice authentication confirmation response, which includes the EAP message
(e.g. EAP success/failure message) generated by the NSSAAF or from the AAA-S.
The NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) shall forward the EAP message to the UE
in NAS message.
If the UE is authenticated, the NSSAAF shall set the \"authResult\" attribute
to \"EAP_SUCCESS\". If failed to authenticate the UE, the \"authResult\"
attribute shall be set to \"EAP_FAILURE\".
If subsequent EAP message exchange is needed between the UE and the
NSSAAF(AAA-S), the NSSAAF shall not include SliceAuthResult in the response
message.
6b. On failure, one of the HTTP status codes listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1 shall
be returned with the message body containing a ProblemDetails structure with
the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table
6.1.7.3-1.
6c. On redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"307 Temporary
Redirect\") shall be returned. A RedirectResponse IE may be included in the
payload body of POST response, as specified in table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3.
7-9. If subsequent EAP message exchange is needed between the UE and the
NSSAAF to finish the EAP based authentication, step 7-9 are performed. On
failure, one of the HTTP status codes listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1 shall be
returned with the message body containing a ProblemDetails structure with the
\"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table
6.1.7.3-1. On redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"307
Temporary Redirect\") shall be returned, and a RedirectResponse IE may be
included in the message body, as specified in table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3.
In above steps, if the AAA-S is involved in the slice-specific authentication
and authorization procedure while there is no expected response from the AAA-S
in the case of time out, the NSSAAF shall return HTTP status code \"504
Gateway Timeout\", with the message body containing a ProblemDetails structure
with the \"cause\" attribute set to \"TIMED_OUT_REQUEST\".
After the completion of slice-specific authentication and authorization
procedure, it is up to implementation whether the NSSAAF stores the slice
authentication context and related resources for a configured period, or
deletes the context and resource immediately, e.g. depending on the potential
need for AAA-S initiated slice-specific re-authentication/revocation
notification.
If the slice-specific authentication and authorization was successful (i.e.
\"authResult\" attribute received from NSSAAF in step 6a is set to
\"EAP_SUCCESS\"), the AMF shall set \"status\" attribute for the given slice
listed in \"nssaaStatusList\" attribute to \"EAP_SUCCESS\" (see 3GPP TS 29.518
[16]).
If the slice-specific authentication and authorization finally fails (i.e.
\"authResult\" attribute received from NSSAAF in step 6a is set to
\"EAP_FAILURE\"), the AMF shall set \"status\" attribute for the given slice
listed in \"nssaaStatusList\" attribute to \"EAP_FAILURE\" (see 3GPP TS 29.518
[16]). In this case, if there are PDU sessions previously established
corresponding to the S-NSSAIs required to be authenticated, the AMF should
additionally trigger the release of those PDU sessions.
If the slice-specific authentication and authorization cannot be completed,
then:
\- If it is due to receiving a response with HTTP status code \"504 Gateway
Timeout\" or due to lack of response from the NSSAAF during an NSSAA
procedure, the AMF may later re-initiate slice-specific authentication and
authorization procedure based on its policy. The AMF should wait for a
configured period before re-initiating slice-specific authentication and
authorization procedure. If the retry attempts are exhausted, the AMF stops
the slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure.
NOTE 1: It is recommended to limit the number of retry attempts as described
in 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
\- If it is due to the UE becoming unreachable during an NSSAA procedure, the
AMF stops the slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure.
\- If the AMF stops the slice-specific authentication and authorization
procedure (i.e. after exhausting the retry attempts or when the UE becomes
unreachable), the AMF shall keep the \"status\" attribute set to \"PENDING\",
for the given slice(s) listed in \"nssaaStatusList\" attribute (see 3GPP TS
29.518 [16]).
NOTE 2: The AMF initiates the slice-specific authentication and authorization
for S-NSSAIs in \"PENDING\" status at next UE uplink activity.
#### 5.2.2.3 Re-Authentication Notification
##### 5.2.2.3.1 General
The Re-Authentication Notification service operation shall be used by the
NSSAAF to notify the AMF to re-initiate slice-specific authentication and
authorization for a given UE, as specified in clause 4.2.9.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502
[3], and clause 16.4 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8].
If there are two different AMFs serving the UE (e.g. the NSSAAF retrieves two
different AMFs from the UDM), the NSSAAF may determine to send the re-
authentication notification to both AMFs. Or, the NSSAAF may first send re-
authentication notification to one of the AMF, and then send revocation
notification to another AMF if EAP authentication fails in first AMF. If EAP
authentication succeeds in first AMF then NSSAAF does not notify the other
AMF.
The NSSAAF shall notify the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) by using the
HTTP POST method as shown in Figure 5.2.2.3.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.3.1-1: Re-authentication Notification
1\. The NSSAAF shall send a POST request to the callback URI used to receiving
re-authentication notification, which is either provided by the NF Service
Consumer (i.e. the AMF), or retrieved from the AMF profile stored in the NRF.
The HTTP payload body of the POST request shall contain the
SliceAuthReauthNotification data structure, within which:
\- the notificationType set to the SliceAuthNotificationType of
\"SLICE_RE_AUTH\";
\- the gpsi set to the GPSI of the given UE required to be re-authenticated;
\- the snssai set to the S-NSSAI required to be re-authenticated;
\- the supi set to the SUPI of the given UE required to be re-authenticated.
NOTE: The NSSAAF can obtain the SUPI of the UE in the response of a previous
Nudm_UECM_Get used by the NSSAAF to retrieve the AMF ID.
2a. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned and the payload body of
the POST response shall be empty.
After responding the request, the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) shall
send NAS message to the UE to trigger re-authentication and re-authorization
for the given slice.
The AMF then decides to execute the Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization if needed as described in clause 5.2.2.2.1.
2b. On failure, one of the HTTP status code (e.g. \"404 Not Found\") listed in
Table 6.1.7.3-1 shall be returned.
For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a ProblemDetails
structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error
listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1.
2c. On redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"307 Temporary
Redirect\") shall be returned. A RedirectResponse IE may be included in the
payload body of POST response, as specified in table 6.1.5.2.3.1-3.
If the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) is not able to handle the request,
but knows that another NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) is able to handle
it, it shall reply with an HTTP 3xx redirect error response pointing to the
URI of the new NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF).
#### 5.2.2.4 Revocation Notification
##### 5.2.2.4.1 General
The Revocation Notification service operation shall be used by the NSSAAF to
notify the AMF to revoke slice-specific authentication and authorization
result, as specified in clause 4.2.9.4 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], and clause 16.5
of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8], and may trigger the AMF to release the corresponding
PDU sessions associated to the indicated slice.
If there are two different AMFs serving the UE (e.g. the NSSAAF retrieves two
different AMFs from the UDM), the NSSAAF may determine to send revocation
notification to both AMFs.
The NSSAAF shall notify the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) by using the
HTTP POST method as shown in Figure 5.2.2.4.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.4.1-1: Revocation Notification
1\. The NSSAAF shall send a POST request to the revocation notification
callback URI, which is either provided by the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the
AMF), or retrieved from the AMF profile stored in the NRF.
The HTTP payload body of the POST request shall contain the
SliceAuthRevocNotification data structure, within which:
\- the notificationType set to the SliceAuthNotificationType of
\"SLICE_REVOCATION\";
\- the gpsi set to the GPSI of the given UE for whom the slice-specific
authorization revocation is required;
\- the snssai set to the S-NSSAI for which the slice-specific authorization
revocation is required;
\- the supi set to the SUPI of the given UE for whom the slice-specific
authorization revocation is required.
NOTE: The NSSAAF can obtain the SUPI of the UE in the response of a previous
Nudm_UECM_Get used by the NSSAAF to retrieve the AMF ID.
2a. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned and the payload body of
the POST response shall be empty.
On receiving the request, the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) shall revoke
the slice-specific authentication and authorization result for the given UE.
If there is PDU session associated to the given slice, the AMF shall trigger
the PDU session release to the SMF, with appropriate cause value.
The AMF shall remove the \"status\" for the given slice in \"nssaaStatusList\"
attribute (see 3GPP TS 29.518 [16]).
2b. On failure, one of the HTTP status code (e.g. \"404 Not Found\") listed in
Table 6.1.7.3-1 shall be returned.
For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a ProblemDetails
structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error
listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1.
2c. On redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"307 Temporary
Redirect\") shall be returned. A RedirectResponse IE may be included in the
payload body of POST response, as specified in table 6.1.5.3.3.1-2.
If the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) is not able to handle the request,
but knows that another NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) is able to handle
it, it shall reply with an HTTP 3xx redirect error response pointing to the
URI of the new NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF).

### 6.1.7 Error Handling
#### 6.1.7.1 General
For the Nnssaaf_NSSAA API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors and application
errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] shall be supported
for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as
mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Nnssaaf_NSSAA API.
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Nnssaaf_NSSAA service are specified.
#### 6.1.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nnssaaf_NSSAA service are listed in
Table 6.1.7.3-1.
Table 6.1.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
RESOURCE_TEMP_MOVED 307 Temporary Redirect Indicates that the NSSAAF is not
able to handle the request, but points to the URI of another NSSAAF.
RESOURCE_MOVED 308 Permanent Redirect Indicates that the NSSAAF is not able to
handle the request, but points to the URI of another NSSAAF.
SLICE_AUTH_REJECTED 403 Forbidden The user cannot be authenticated, e.g.
authentication request rejected by the AAA-S. CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found
The NSSAAF cannot find the resource corresponding to the URI provided by the
NF Service Consumer, i.e. the resource identified by the authCtxId does not
exist in the NSSAAF. USER_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The user does not exist in
the HPLMN. UPSTREAM_SERVER_ERROR 504 Gateway Timeout Error happens in reaching
the remote peer (i.e. the AAA-S). NETWORK_FAILURE 504 Gateway Timeout The
request is rejected due to a network problem. TIMED_OUT_REQUEST 504 Gateway
Timeout No response is received from the remote peer (i.e. the AAA-S) when
time out.
## 6.1.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 6.1.8-1 are defined for the Nnssaaf_NSSAA API.
They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause
6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.1.8-1: Supported Features
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
## 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nnssaaf_NSSAA API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF
RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnssaaf_NSSAA API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnssaaf_NSSAA service.
The Nnssaaf_NSSAA API defines a single scope \"nnssaaf-nssaa\" for the entire
service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation
level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
## A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications in YAML
format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE : The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository hosted, that
uses the GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause
5.3.1 and 3GPP TR 21.900 [7] clause 5B).
