include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST
response.
##### 4.2.2.2.3 Update subscription for event notifications
Figure 4.2.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the NWDAF to update the subscription for event notifications (see
also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.2.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer updates subscription to notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Subscribe
service operation to update subscription to event notifications. The NF
service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI
representing the \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\", as shown in figure
4.2.2.2.3-1, step 1, to update the subscription for an \"Individual NWDAF
Event Subscription\" resource identified by the {subscriptionId}. The
NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure provided in the request body shall
include the same contents as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.2:
Upon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI and
NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall:
\- update the subscription of corresponding subscriptionId; and
\- store the subscription.
NOTE: The \"notificationURI\" attribute within the NnwdafEventsSubscription
data structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are
sent to a new NF service consumer.
If the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PUT
request, the NWDAF shall update an \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\"
resource, and shall respond with:
a) HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing a
representation of the updated subscription, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1,
step 2a. If not all the requested analytics events in the subscription are
modified successfully, then the NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\"
attribute indicating the event(s) for which the modification failed and the
associated reason(s); or
b) HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step
2b.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in subclause 5.1.7.
If the Individual NWDAF Event Subscription resource does not exist, the NWDAF
shall respond with \"404 Not Found\".

### 5.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2
protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[12]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, a n NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services
offered by the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API, shall obtain a \"token\" from
the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], subclause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription service.
The Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-
eventssubscription\" for the entire service, and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.

### 5.2.7 Error handling
#### 5.2.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in subclause 5.2.4 of 3GPP
TS 29.500 [6].
For the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in subclause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [7]. Protocol errors and
application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] shall be
supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are
specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6]. In addition, the requirements in the following subclauses shall
apply.
#### 5.2.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no additional protocol errors
applicable for the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API.
#### 5.2.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API are listed in
table 5.2.7.3-1.
Table 5.2.7.3-1: Application errors
* * *
Application Error HTTP status code Description BOTH_STAT_PRED_NOT_ALLOWED 400
Bad Request For the requested observation period, the start time is in the
past and the end time is in the future, which means the NF service consumer
requested both statistics and prediction for the analytics. UNAVAILABLE_DATA
500 Internal Server Error Indicates the requested statistics in the past is
rejected since necessary data to perform the service is unavailable. NOTE:
Including a \"ProblemDetails\" data structure with the \"cause\" attribute in
the HTTP response is optional unless explicitly mandated in the service
operation subclauses.
* * *
### 5.2.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.2.8-1 are defined for the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility
mechanism defined in subclause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
Table 5.2.8-1: Supported Features
* * *
Feature number Feature Name Description 1 UeMobility This feature indicates
the support of analytics based on UE mobility information. 2 UeCommunication
This feature indicates the support of analytics based on UE communication
information. 3 NetworkPerformance This feature indicates the support of
analytics based on network performance. 4 ServiceExperience This feature
indicates support for the event related to service experience. 5
QoSSustainability This feature indicates support for the event related to QoS
sustainability. 6 AbnormalBehaviour This feature indicates support for the
event related to abnormal behaviour information. 7 UserDataCongestion This
feature indicates the support of the analytics related on user data
congestion. 8 NfLoad This feature indicates the support of the analytics
related to the load of NF instances. 9 NsiLoad This feature indicates the
support of the analytics related to the load level of Network Slice and the
optionally associated Network Slice Instance.
* * *
### 5.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [12])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, a n NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services
offered by the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], subclause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service.
The Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-analyticsinfo\"
for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [11] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription and the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo APIs.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
