scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# Introduction
The present document has been produced as an aspect of work to realise the
stage 3 protocols to implement the stage 2 functionality for Interworking
between Mission Critical systems and Land Mobile Radio systems as described in
3GPP TS 23.283 [80]. Early stage 3 study work is documented in 3GPP TR 24.883
[90] which covers both MCPTT and MCData interworking.
The document structure describes functionality modelled on 3GPP TS 24.282 [49]
because the behaviour of an Interworking Function (IWF) for LMR MCData
interworking is modelled on that of an MCData server, and the clause numbering
is also based on that used in on 3GPP TS 24.282 [49] in order to aid
comparison between the two specifications and identification of any
behavioural changes.
The reference numbering is based on that used in 3GPP TR 24.883 [90] and so
may not be sequential.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the protocols needed to support a Mission
Critical Data (MCData) system interworking with a Land Mobile Radio (LMR)
system based on the IWF-2 interface between an MCData server and an
Interworking Function (IWF) as described in 3GPP TS 23.283 [80].

# 4 General
## 4.1 MCData overview
The MCData service supports communication between a pair of users (i.e. one-
to-one communication) and several users (i.e. group communication), where each
user has the ability to share data using Short Data Service (SDS).
The present document provides the signalling control protocol enhancements to
support the MCData architectural procedures for MCData SDS interworking
between on‑network Mission Critical users and users homed in the IWF, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.283[80].
The present document makes use of the existing IMS procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
The procedures in this document allow an on‑network MCData user to:
\- send a standalone SDS using signalling control plane to a user homed in the
IWF or to a group including at least one user homed in the IWF; and
\- send a standalone SDS using media plane to a user homed in the IWF or to a
group including at least one user homed in the IWF.
The procedures in this document allow a user homed in the IWF to:
\- send a standalone SDS using signalling control plane to an on‑network
MCData user or to a group of on‑network MCData users; and
\- send a standalone SDS using media plane to an on‑network MCData user or to
a group of on‑network MCData users.
The present document does not support the interworking of SDS sessions with
users homed in the IWF.
The MCData procedures provided by the present document refer to:
\- the media plane procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.582 [85];
\- the group management procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.481 [31];
\- the identity management procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.482 [49]; and
\- the security procedures defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78].
The following procedures are provided within this document:
\- common procedures are specified in clause 6;
\- procedures for registration in the IM CN subsystem and service
authorisation are specified in clause 7;
\- procedures for affiliation are specified in clause 8;
\- procedures for SDS are specified in clause 9;
\- procedures for transmission and reception control are specified in clause
11;
\- procedures for dispositions and notifications are specified in clause 12;
\- procedures for communication release are specified in clause 13; and
\- procedures for enhanced status are specified in clause 14.
The IWF acts on behalf of all users homed in the IWF. There are no client
procedures specified in the present document and specific client handling
within the LMR system is out of scope.
## 4.2 Identity, URI and address assignments
### 4.2.1 Public Service identities
In order to support MCData interworking with LMR, the following URI and
address assignments are assumed:
1) the IWF performing the participating role is configured to be reachable
using a public service identity.
2) the IWF performing the controlling role is configured to be reachable using
a public service identity.
### 4.2.2 MCData session identity
There is no MSRP session used at the IWF to support the short data service
(SDS).
### 4.2.3 MCData client ID
The MCData client ID is described in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 4.8.
## 4.3 Emergency alerts
## 4.4 MCData protocol
Clause 15 describes the TLV based message formats used in MCData
communications.
Annex I of 3GPP TS 24.379 [81] describes the standard format of the messages
and the encoding rules for each type of information element.
## 4.5 Protection of sensitive XML application data
In certain deployments, for example, in the case that the MCData operator uses
the underlying SIP core infrastructure from the carrier operator, the MCData
operator can prevent certain sensitive application data from being exposed to
the SIP layer. The following data are classified as sensitive application
data:
\- MCData ID;
\- MCData group ID;
\- alert indicator;
\- access token (containing the MCData ID); and
\- MCData client ID.
The above data is transported as XML content in SIP messages, in XML elements
or XML attributes.
NOTE: SIP layer protection terminates at the IWF.
Data is transported in attributes in the following circumstances in the
procedures in the present document:
\- an MCData ID, an MCData Group ID, and an MCData client ID in an XML
document published in SIP PUBLISH request for affiliation according to IETF
RFC 3856 [51];
\- an MCData ID or an MCData Group ID in XML document notified in a SIP NOTIFY
request for affiliation according to IETF RFC 3856 [51]; and
\- an MCData ID in application/resource-lists+xml document included in a SIP
MESSAGE or SIP INVITE request for one-to-one SDS, according to IETF RFC 5366
[20];
3GPP TS 33.180 [78] describes a method to provide confidentiality protection
of sensitive application data in elements by using XML encryption (i.e.
xmlenc) and in attributes by using an attribute confidentiality protection
scheme described in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.6.2.3. Integrity protection
can also be provided by using XML signatures (i.e. xmlsig).
Protection of the data relies on a shared XML protection key (XPK) used to
encrypt and sign data:
\- between MCData servers and an IWF, the XPK is a signalling protection key
(SPK).
The SPK (XPK) and a key-id SPK-ID (XPK-ID) are directly provisioned in the
MCData server and IWF.
Configuration in the MCData client, IWF and MCData server is used to determine
whether one or both of confidentiality protection and integrity protection are
required.
3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 4.6 provides examples of confidentiality and
integrity protection applied to application data.
## 4.6 Protection of TLV signalling and media content
The protection of TLV signalling and media content is based on 3GPP MCData
security solution as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78].
For different security requirements of different information elements of a
MCData message, the information elements of MCData messages are bifurcated in
the following components:
\- **MCData** **Data signalling payload** : information elements necessary for
identification and management of the MCData messages e.g. conversation
identifiers, session identifiers, transaction identifiers, disposition
requests, etc. This payload is confidentiality and integrity protected between
the MCData server and the IWF.
\- **MCData** **Data payload** : the actual user payload for MCData user or
application consumption. This payload is confidentiality and integrity
protected between the MCData client and the IWF.
An SDS message can be sent over the signalling plane or the media plane. When
an SDS message is sent using the signalling plane, the body included in the
SIP MESSAGE request, which carries the MCData Data signalling payload, is
protected separately between each pair of entities if protection is applied.
On the other hand, the body included in the SIP MESSAGE request which carries
the MCData data payload is protected between the MCData client and the IWF.
The procedures for the protection of the SDS messages over the signalling
plane are specified in clause 6.6. Protection of SDS messages over the media
control plane is specified in 3GPP TS 24.582 [85].
NOTE: The method by which SDS messages are protected between the IWF and the
user homed in the IWF is outside the scope of the present document.
## 4.7 Warning Header Field
### 4.7.1 General
An IWF can include a free text string in a SIP response to a SIP request. When
the IWF includes a free text string in a response to a SIP MESSAGE or SIP
INVITE request the free text string is included in a Warning header field as
specified in IETF RFC 3261 [24]. The IWF includes the Warning code set to 399
(miscellaneous warning) and includes the host name set to the host name of the
IWF.
EXAMPLE: Warning: 399 example.domain.com \"200 user not authorised to transmit
data\"
### 4.7.2 Warning texts
Warning texts specified in table 4.7.2-1 for interworking are used, in
conjunction with existing warning texts as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82].
Table 4.7.2-1: Warning texts for interworking defined for the Warning header
field
Code Explanatory text Description

## 6.3 Server role procedures
### 6.3.0 Introduction
The IWF performs the MCData server role when exchanging SDS messages with
MCData servers within the MC system. The IWF does not communicate directly
with MCData clients. The IWF does not support the FD service. Clause 6.3
describes the IWF operating as a controlling and participating MCData server.
### 6.3.1 Distinction of requests at the IWF
#### 6.3.1.1 SIP MESSAGE request
The IWF shall perform the role of an MCData server in distinguishing between
the following SIP MESSAGE requests for originations and terminations from 3GPP
TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.3.1.1 as described below:
\- SIP MESSAGE request routed to the IWF performing the terminating
participating MCData role with an Accept-Contact header field with the
g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\", and an ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" in a P-Asserted-Service header field. Such
requests are known as \"SIP MESSAGE request for standalone SDS for terminating
participating MCData function\";
\- SIP MESSAGE request routed to IWF performing the MCData server role with an
Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag
containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\", an
ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" in a P-Asserted-
Service header field, and with an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-signalling MIME
body containing an SDS NOTIFICATION message Such requests are known as \"SIP
MESSAGE request for SDS disposition notification for MCData server\";
\- SIP MESSAGE request routed to the IWF performing the controlling MCData
role with an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\", and an ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" in a P-Asserted-Service header field. Such
requests are known as \"SIP MESSAGE request for standalone SDS for controlling
MCData function\"; and
\- SIP MESSAGE requests routed to the IWF performing the terminating
participating role as a result of initial filter criteria with the Request-URI
set to the public service identity of the IWF performing the participating
role and containing a Content-Type header field set to
\"application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml\" and includes an XML body containing a
\ root element with a \ element containing an
\ element with the \ element set to a value of
\"Interworking Security Data message\". Such requests are known as \"SIP
MESSAGE request for Interworking Security Data message for participating
function\".
If a SIP MESSAGE request is received at the IWF that is not in accordance with
the SIP MESSAGE requests listed above, then the IWF shall reject the SIP
MESSAGE request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response.
#### 6.3.1.2 SIP INVITE request
The IWF shall perform the role of an MCData server in distinguishing between
the following SIP INVITE requests for originations and terminations from 3GPP
TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.3.1.2 as described below:
\- SIP INVITE request routed to the IWF performing the terminating
participating MCData role with an Accept-Contact header field with the

### 6.3.2 Sending SIP requests and receiving SIP responses
#### 6.3.2.1 Generating a SIP MESSAGE request towards the terminating MCData
client
This clause is referenced from other procedures. Refer to 3GPP TS 24.282 [82]
clause 6.3.2.1.
### 6.3.3 Groups homed in the IWF
How information about groups homed in the IWF is stored and retrieved by the
IWF is out of scope of the present document. The procedures to perform these
actions are supported by the IWF but are not defined.
### 6.3.4 Void
### 6.3.5 Affiliation check
The IWF shall determine that the MCData user, with MCData ID, is affiliated to
the MCData group, with MCData Group ID, at the MCData client, with MCData
client ID, if the elements, as described in clause 8.3.3.2, exist with their
expected values, as below:
1) an MCData group information entry with MCData group ID same as the MCData
group ID under consideration;
2) in the MCData group information entry found in 1, an MCData user
information entry with the MCData ID same as the MCData ID under
consideration;
3) in the MCData user information entry found in 2, an MCData client
information entry with MCData Client ID same as the MCData client ID under
consideration; and
4) in the MCData user information entry found in 2, an expiration time, which
has not expired.
NOTE: How the IWF determines which users homed in the IWF are affiliated to
the MCData group is out of scope of the present document.
## 6.4 Handling of MIME bodies in a SIP message
The IWF shall support MIME bodies in SIP requests and SIP responses according
to 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.4.
## 6.5 Confidentiality and Integrity Protection of sensitive XML content
### 6.5.1 General
#### 6.5.1.1 Applicability and exclusions
The procedures in clause 6.5 apply in general to all procedures described in
clause 9, clause 12 and clause 13 with the exception that the confidentiality
and integrity protection procedures for the registration and service
authorisation procedures are described in clause 7.
#### 6.5.1.2 Performing XML content encryption
Whenever the IWF includes XML elements or attributes pertaining to the data
specified in clause 4.6 in SIP requests or SIP responses, the IWF shall
perform the procedures in clause 6.5.2.3.2, with the exception that when the
IWF receives a SIP request with XML elements or attributes in an MIME body
that need to be copied from the incoming SIP request to an outgoing SIP
request without modification, the IWF shall perform the procedures specified
in clause 6.5.2.5.
#### 6.5.1.3 Performing integrity protection on an XML body
The IWF shall perform the procedures in clause 6.5.3.3.2 just prior to sending
a SIP request or SIP response.
### 6.5.2 Confidentiality Protection
#### 6.5.2.2 Keys used in confidentiality protection procedures
Confidentiality protection uses an XPK to encrypt the data which is an SPK as
specified in clause 4.5. In the case of an IWF as a server sending or
receiving to another server this key will be an SPK. An SPK-ID is used to key
the SPK. It is assumed that before the procedures in this clause are called,
the SPK/SPK-ID are available on the sender and recipient of the encrypted
content as described in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 4.6.
The procedures in clause 6.5.2.3 and 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.2.4 are
used with an XPK equal to the SPK and a XPK-ID equal to the SPK-ID when the
IWF sends confidentiality protected content to an MCData server.
#### 6.5.2.3 Procedures for sending confidentiality protected content
##### 6.5.2.3.2 IWF performing the role of an MCData server
If the IWF performing the role of an MCData server determines locally that it
needs to confidentially protect content to an MCData server, then sending
confidentially protected content between MCData servers is enabled.
When sending confidentiality protected content, the IWF:
1) shall use the appropriate keying information specified in clause 6.5.2.2;
2) shall perform the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.2.3.3 to
confidentiality protect XML elements containing the content described in
clause 4.5; and
3) shall perform the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.2.3.4 to
confidentiality protect URIs in XML attributes for URIs described in clause
4.5.
If the IWF determines locally that it does not need to confidentiality protect
content sent to an MCData server, then sending confidentiality protected
content between MCData servers is disabled, and the content is included in XML
elements and attributes without encryption.
#### 6.5.2.5 IWF copying received XML content
The following procedure is executed when an IWF receives a SIP request
containing XML MIME bodies, where the content needs to be copied from the
incoming SIP request to the outgoing SIP request.
The IWF:
1) shall copy the XML elements from the XML MIME body of the incoming SIP
request that do not contain a \ XML element, to the same XML
body in the outgoing SIP request;
2) for each encrypted XML element in the XML MIME body of the incoming SIP
request as determined by 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.2.4.1:
a) shall use the keying information described in clause 6.5.2.2 to decrypt the
content within the XML element by following the procedures specified in 3GPP
TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.2.4.2, and shall continue with the steps below if
the encrypted XML element was successfully decrypted;
b) if confidentiality protection is enabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.2,
then for each decrypted XML element:
i) shall re-encrypt the content within the XML element using the keying
information described in clause 6.5.2.2 and by following the procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.2.3.3; and
ii) shall include the re-encrypted content into the same XML MIME body of the
outgoing SIP request; and
c) if confidentiality protection is disabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.2,
shall include the decrypted content in the same XML MIME body of the outgoing
SIP request; and
3) for each encrypted XML URI attribute in the XML MIME body of the incoming
SIP request as determined by 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.2.4.1:
a) shall use the keying information described in clause 6.5.2.2 to decrypt the
URI value of the XML attribute by following the procedures specified in 3GPP
TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.2.4.3, and shall continue with the steps below if
the encrypted XML attribute value was successfully decrypted;
b) if confidentiality protection is enabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.2,
then for each decrypted XML element:
i) shall re-encrypt the URI value of the XML attribute using the keying
information described in clause 6.5.2.2 and by following the procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.2.3.4; and
ii) shall include the re-encrypted attribute value into the same XML MIME body
of the outgoing SIP request; and
c) if confidentiality protection is disabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.2,
shall include the decrypted value in the same XML MIME body of the outgoing
SIP request.
### 6.5.3 Integrity Protection of XML documents
#### 6.5.3.2 Keys used in integrity protection procedures
Integrity protection uses an XPK to sign the data which is an SPK as specified
in clause 4.5. In the case of an IWF as a server sending or receiving to
another server this key will be an SPK. An SPK-ID is used to key the SPK. It
is assumed that before the procedures in clause 6.5.3.3 and 3GPP TS 24.282
[82] clauses 6.5.3.3.1, 6.5.3.3.3 and 6.5.3.4 are called, the SPK/SPK-ID are
available on the sender and recipient of the integrity protected content, as
described in clause 4.5.
The procedure in clause 6.5.3.3 and 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.3.4 shall
be used with a XPK equal to the SPK and a XPK-ID equal to the SPK-ID when the
IWF sends integrity protected content to an MCData server
#### 6.5.3.3 Sending integrity protected content
##### 6.5.3.3.2 Integrity protection at the IWF
The IWF determines locally whether sending integrity protected content from
the IWF to an MCData server is enabled.
When sending integrity protected content, the IWF shall use the appropriate
keying information specified in clause 6.5.3.2 and shall perform the
procedures in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82] clause 6.5.3.3.3 to integrity protect XML
MIME bodies.
NOTE: Each XML MIME body is integrity protected separately.
## 6.6 Confidentiality and integrity protection of TLV messages
### 6.6.1 General
Signalling plane provides confidentiality and integrity protection for the
MCData data signalling and MCData data messages sent over the signalling
plane. Signalling plane security also provides the authentication of MCData
data messages.
The signalling plane security is based on 3GPP MCData security solution
including key management and end-to-end protection as defined in 3GPP TS
33.180 [78].
Various keys and associated key identifiers protect the MCData data signalling
and MCData data messages carried on the signalling plane.
The MCData signalling messages sent and received by an IWF are on-network
communications and do not include FD.
The MCData data signalling messages may be:
1\. SDS SIGNALLING PAYLOAD;
2\. SDS NOTIFICATION; or
3\. COMMUNICATION RELEASE.
The MCData data messages may be:
1\. DATA PAYLOAD.
In an on-network MCData communication for an MCData group, if protection of
MCData data messages is negotiated, the GMK and the GMK-ID of the MCData group
protect the MCData data messages sent and received by the IWF acting on behalf
of users homed in the IWF.
In an on-network one-to-one MCData communications, if protection of MCData
data messages is negotiated, the PCK and the PCK-ID protect the MCData data
messages sent and received by the IWF acting on behalf of MCData clients homed
in the IWF. The IWF acts as termination point for protection of one-to-one
MCData data messages that are sent and received by the IWF acting on behalf of
MCData clients homed in the IWF.
The protection of MCData communications between the user homed in the IWF and
the IWF acting on behalf of the user homed in the IWF is outside the scope of
the present document.
If protection of MCData data signalling messages between the IWF and another
MCData function acting in a participating or controlling role is configured,
the SPK and the SPK-ID protect the MCData data signalling messages sent and
received between the IWF and that MCData function.
The GMK and the GMK-ID are distributed to the IWF acting on behalf of users
homed in the IWF using the group document subscription and notification
procedure specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [31].
The PCK and the PCK-ID are generated by the IWF initiating the standalone SDS
using signalling control plane.
The SPK and the SPK-ID are configured in the IWF if it is acting as the
participating MCData function or if it is acting as the controlling MCData
function.
The key material for creating and verifying the authentication signature (SSK,
PVT and KPAK) is provisioned to the MCData clients by the KMS as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [78].
### 6.6.2 Derivation of master keys for media and media control
On-network MCData services employing the media plane are not supported by the
IWF.
### 6.6.3 Protection of MCData signalling and MCData messages
#### 6.6.3.1 General
The MCData messages may be encrypted and integrity protected between the IWF
and the MCData system. When encryption is applied the media shall be encrypted
as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78].
Both unprotected MCData messages and MCData messages that are encypted and/or
integrity protected can also be end-to-end encrypted for interworking between
an MCData client and the IWF.
NOTE: LMR end to end encryption is independent of 3GPP encryption and is out
of scope of the present document.

The procedures for implicit affiliation in this clause are triggered at the
IWF performing the participating role in the following circumstances:
\- when generating a SIP MESSAGE request on behalf of a user homed in the IWF
to initiate an MCData emergency alert targeted to an MCData group and the user
homed in the IWF is not already affiliated to that MCData group.
The procedures for implicit affiliation in this clause are triggered at the
IWF performing the controlling role in the following circumstances:
\- on receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request from the participating MCData function
when the MCData user initiates an MCData emergency alert targeted to an MCData
group and the MCData client is not already affiliated to the MCData group.
Clause 8.4 describes the coding used for explicit affiliation.
## 8.2 IWF performing the participating role procedures
The IWF acts on behalf of all users homed in the IWF. There are no client
procedures specified in the present document and specific client handling
within the LMR system is out of scope.
## 8.3 Server procedures
### 8.3.1 General
The procedures performed by the IWF in the role of the MCData server consist
of:
\- procedures of the IWF performing the participating role; and

#### 8.3.2.6 Sending affiliation status change towards MCData server owning
MCData group procedure
NOTE 1: Usage of one SIP PUBLISH request to carry information about change of
affiliation state of several users homed in the IWF served by the same IWF is
not supported in this version of the specification.
In order:
\- to send an affiliation request of a served MCData ID to a handled MCData
group ID;
\- to send an de-affiliation request of a served MCData ID from a handled
MCData group ID; or
\- to send an affiliation request of a served MCData ID to a handled MCData
group ID due to near expiration of the previously published information;
the IWF performing the participating role shall generate a SIP PUBLISH request
according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4], IETF RFC 3903 [37] and IETF RFC 3856 [51]. In
the SIP PUBLISH request, the IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity of the controlling
MCData function associated with the handled MCData group ID;

#### 8.3.2.7 Affiliation status retrieval from IWF performing the role of the
MCData server owning MCData group procedure
NOTE 1: Usage of one SIP SUBSCRIBE request to subscribe for notification about
change of affiliation state of several MCData users served by the same IWF
performing the role of the MCData server is not supported in this version of
the specification.
In order to discover whether a served user homed in the IWF was successfully
affiliated to a handled MCData group in the MCData server owning the handled
MCData group, the IWF performing the role of the MCData server shall generate
an initial SIP SUBSCRIBE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4], IETF RFC
3856 [51], and IETF RFC 6665 [26].
In the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the IWF performing the role of the MCData
server:
1) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity of the controlling
MCData function associated with the handled MCData group ID;
2) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body. In the

element, in the group document, is set to \"false\" for an MCData group:
\- an IWF shall not send an SDS to the said MCData group; and
\- an IWF performing the terminating MCData controlling role shall reject a
request to send SDS to the said MCData group.
## 9.2 On-network SDS
### 9.2.1 General
On-network SDS employing the media plane is not supported by the IWF in the
present document.
### 9.2.2 Standalone SDS using signalling control plane
#### 9.2.2.1 General
The procedures in the subsequent clauses of clause 9.2.2 are used by the IWF
to send or receive:
\- a one-to-one standalone SDS message using the signalling control plane; or
\- a group standalone SDS message using the signalling control plane.
#### 9.2.2.2 Procedures used by the IWF for users homed in the IWF
##### 9.2.2.2.1 Originating procedures
The IWF shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229
[4] and IETF RFC 3428 [33] with the clarifications given below.
The IWF:
1) if a one-to-one standalone SDS message is to be sent, shall insert in the
SIP MESSAGE request:
a) an application/resource-lists+xml MIME body with the MCData ID of the
target MCData user, according to rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4826 [89];
b) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with a \
element set to a value of \"one-to-one-sds\"; and
c) if end-to-end security is required and the security context does not exist
or if the existing security context has expired, an application/mikey MIME
body with the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78]. The
IWF:
i) if necessary, shall determine keying material from the key management
server;
NOTE: How the IWF obtains the keying material is out of scope of the present
document.
ii) shall use the keying material to generate a PCK as described in 3GPP TS
33.180 [78];
iii) shall use the PCK to generate a PCK-ID with the four most significant
bits set to \"0001\" to indicate that the purpose of the PCK is to protect
one-to-one communications and with the remaining twenty eight bits being
randomly generated as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
iv) shall encrypt the PCK to a UID associated to the MCData client using the
MCData ID of the invited user and a time related parameter as described in
3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
v) shall generate a MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE using the encapsulated PCK and PCK-
ID as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
vi) shall add the MCData ID associated with the originating user homed in the
IWF to the initiator field (IDRi) of the I_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS
33.180 [78];
vii) shall sign the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE using the originating signing key
determined by the IWF performing the role of an MCData server provided in the
keying material together with a time related parameter; and
viii) shall include the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE in an application/mikey MIME
body as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
2) if a group standalone SDS message is to be sent:
a) shall insert in the SIP MESSAGE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body with:
i) the \ element set to a value of \"group-sds\";
ii) the \ element set to the MCData group identity; and
iii) the \ element set to the MCData client ID associated
with the originating user homed in the IWF; and
3) shall generate a standalone SDS message as specified in clause 6.2.2.1.
##### 9.2.2.2.2 Terminating procedures
Upon receipt of an SDS intended for a user homed in the IWF, the IWF processes
the message according to the procedures in clause 9.2.2.3.2.
#### 9.2.2.3 IWF performing the participating MCData function procedures
##### 9.2.2.3.1 Originating participating MCData function procedures
If the IWF acting in a participating MCData role determines that it needs to
send an SDS message:
1) shall determine the MCData ID of the originating user;
2) shall determine the public service identity of the controlling MCData
function associated with the requested SDS message:
a) if the SDS message to be sent is a group SDS message the public service
identity is that of the controlling MCData function associated with the MCData
group identity of the destination group; or
b) if the SDS message to be sent is a one-to-one SDS message the public
service identity is that of the controlling MCData function hosting the one-
to-one standalone SDS service for the calling user;
NOTE 1: How the IWF determines the public service identity of the controlling
MCData function is out of scope of the present document.
3) if unable to identify the controlling MCData function for standalone SDS
shall complete any further actions to notify the user homed in the IWF, and
shall not continue with any of the remaining steps;
4) shall ensure that the payload size of the message is not larger than a
configured value compatible with the MCData service;
NOTE 2: The term \"payload size\" refers to the \"Length of Payload contents\"
of the payload IE of the DATA PAYLOAD message transported in the SIP MESSAGE
request, minus 1 (to account for the added \"Payload content type\" field).
NOTE 3: The configured value for maximum payload size should not be larger
than the value contained in the \ element
in the MCData service configuration document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484
[50]. How the IWF determines the value to configure is out of scope of the
present document.
5) shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]
and IETF RFC 3428 [33];
6) shall set the Request-URI of the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request to the public
service identity of the controlling MCData function as determined by step 2)
in this clause;
7) shall include MIME bodies in to the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request according
to clause 9.2.2.2.1;
8) shall include the MCData ID of the originating user in the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body of the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request;
9) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]), into the P-Asserted-Service header
field of the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request;
10) shall set the P-Asserted-Identity in the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request to
the public service identity of the IWF; and
11) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
Upon receipt of a SIP response in response to the SIP MESSAGE request in step
11) the IWF completes any further actions needed to handle the response --
e.g. notify the user homed in the IWF.
##### 9.2.2.3.2 IWF performing the terminating participating MCData role
procedures
Upon receipt of a \"SIP MESSAGE request for standalone SDS for terminating
participating MCData function\", the IWF performing the participating role:
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The IWF may include a Retry-After header field to
the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response as specified in IETF RFC 3261
[24] and skip the rest of the steps;
2) shall use the MCData ID present in the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the incoming SIP MESSAGE
request to identify the user homed in the IWF;
3) if the user homed in the IWF does not exist, then the participating IWF may
reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 404 (Not Found) response, and shall
skip the remaining steps;
4) if the SIP MESSAGE request contains an application/mikey MIME body
containing a MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE and decryption of the content of the MIME
body is to occur at the IWF, then the IWF:
a) shall extract the MCData ID of the originating MCData user from the
initiator field (IDRi) of the I_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
b) shall convert the MCData ID to a UID as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
c) shall use the UID to validate the signature of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE as
described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78];
d) if authentication verification of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE fails, shall
reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 606 (Not Acceptable) response, and
include warning text set to \"136 authentication of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE
failed\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.7 and not continue
with rest of the steps in this clause; and
e) if the signature of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE was successfully validated:
i) shall extract and decrypt the encapsulated PCK using the terminating
user\'s (KMS provisioned) UID key as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [78]; and
ii) shall extract the PCK-ID, from the payload as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180
[78]; and
NOTE: Any trans-encryption between the IWF and the user homed in the IWF is
out of scope of the present document.
5) takes any further steps necessary to handle the message -- e.g. notify the
user homed in the IWF.
If the IWF determines that a SIP 200 (OK) response shall be sent on behalf of
a user homed in the IWF in response to the SIP message request, the IWF shall
send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the controlling MCData function according to
3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
If the IWF determines that a SIP 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response shall be sent on
behalf of a user homed in the IWF in response to the SIP message request, the
IWF shall send said SIP 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response to the controlling MCData
function according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]:
1) shall determine which Warning header field(s) to place in the SIP response;
and
2) shall send the SIP response to the controlling MCData function according to
3GPP TS 24.229 [4].

# 12 Dispositions and Notifications
## 12.1 General
The procedures in clause 12 describe:
\- the on-network procedures for generating out-of-band dispositions for on-
network SDS.
The IWF acting on behalf of a participant homed in the IWF can send a
disposition notification as a direct result of receiving an MCData message
(e.g. delivery notification) or can send a disposition notification at a later
time (e.g. read notification). In certain circumstances the delivery and read
notification can be delivered in one notification message.
## 12.2 Disposition notifications
### 12.2.1 IWF performing the MCData participating role
#### 12.2.1.1 Participating IWF procedures
If the IWF performing the MCData participating role decides to send a
disposition notification
the IWF shall follow the procedures of clause 12.2.1.2.
Upon receipt of a SIP 202 (Accepted) response in response to the SIP MESSAGE
request, the IWF:
1) can perform internal actions to process the response.
Upon receipt of a SIP 200 (OK) response in response to the SIP MESSAGE
request, the IWF:
1) can perform internal actions to process the response.
Upon receipt of a SIP 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response to the SIP MESSAGE request, the
IWF:
1) can perform internal actions to process the response.
#### 12.2.1.2 Sending a disposition notification message
The IWF performing the participating role may follow the procedures in this
clause to:
\- indicate to an MCData client that an SDS message was delivered, read or
delivered and read when the originating client requested a delivery, read or
delivery and read report;
\- indicate to the participating MCData function serving the MCData user that
an SDS message was undelivered; or
\- indicate to the participating MCData function serving the MCData user that
dispostion notification has been prevented for an SDS message intended for
users homed in the LMR system.
Before sending a disposition notification the IWF performing the participating
role needs to determine:
\- the group identity related to an SDS message request received as part of a
group communication. The IWF performing the participating role determines the
group identity from the contents of the \ element
contained in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the
incoming SDS message request; and
\- the MCData user targeted for the disposition notification. The IWF
performing the participating role determines the targetted MCData user from
the contents of the \ element contained in the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the incoming SDS message
request.
The IWF performing the participating role generates a SIP MESSAGE request in
accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] and IETF RFC 3428 [33] with the
clarifications given below.
The IWF performing the participating role:
1) shall build the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in clause 6.2.4.1;
2) shall follow the rules specified in clause 6.4 for the handling of MIME
bodies in a SIP message when processing the remaining steps in this clause;
3) shall insert in the SIP MESSAGE request an application/resource-lists+xml
MIME body containing the MCData ID of the targeted MCData user, according to
rules and procedures of IETF RFC 5366 [20];
4) if sending a disposition notification in response to an MCData group data
request, shall include an \ element set to the MCData
group identity in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body;
5) if sending an SDS notification, shall generate an SDS NOTIFICATION message
and include it in the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in clause 6.2.3.1; and
6) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request according to rules and procedures of
3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
#### 12.2.1.3 Participating IWF receives disposition notification from a
controlling MCData function
Upon receipt of a:
\- \"SIP MESSAGE request for SDS disposition notification for terminating
MCData client \";
The IWF:
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The IWF may include a Retry-After header field to
the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response as specified in IETF RFC 3261 [4]
and skip the rest of the steps;
2) shall use the MCData ID present in the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the incoming SIP MESSAGE
request to identify the user homed in the IWF;
3) if the identity of the user homed in the IWF does not exist, then the
participating IWF shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 404 (Not
Found) response. Otherwise, continue with the rest of the steps; and
4) can perform internal actions to process the message.
If the IWF determines that a SIP 2xx response shall be sent on behalf of a
user homed in the IWF in response to the SIP MESSAGE requests, the IWF shall
send a SIP 2xx response to the controlling MCData function.
If the IWF determines that a SIP 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response shall be sent on
behalf of a user homed in the IWF in response to the SIP MESSAGE request, the
IWF shall send the response to the controlling MCData function.
### 12.2.2 IWF performing the MCData controlling role
When triggered by:
\- receipt of a \"SIP MESSAGE request for SDS disposition notification for
MCData server\"; or
\- the IWF determining that it shall send an SDS disposition notification
the IWF performing the MCData controlling role:
1) if the IWF has received the SIP MESSAGE;
a) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The IWF may include a Retry-After header field to
the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response as specified in IETF RFC 3261
[24]. Otherwise, continue with the rest of the steps;

following modifications:
If the \ contains the \ element then:
1) the \ can be included with:
a) a value of \"one-to-one-sds\" to indicate that the MCData client wants to
initiate a one-to-one SDS request;
b) a value of \"group-sds\" to indicate the MCData client wants to initiate a
group SDS request;
c) a value of \"notify\" when the controlling MCData function needs to send a
notification to the MCData client.
2) the \ element of the \ element can be included with
the following element in addition to those specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [82]
Annex D.1.3:
