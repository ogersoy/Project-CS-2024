# 4 Background
In R15, LTE coexisting within a NR carrier is a feature enabling the flexible
NR deployment targeting to achieve minimal impact the legacy LTE service. As
LTE-MTC service is delivered within a LTE carrier, in general LTE-MTC co-
existence with NR will follow the generic framework of the co-existence with
NR and LTE. The focus of co-existing LTE-MTC and NR is to deploy MTC service
within a NR carrier. The main benefit of the deploy MTC service within NR
carrier is that the MTC legacy device and service will be migrate to the 5G
network smoothly without backward compatibility issue.
# 5 Frequency band support for coexistence
Up to Rel-15, LTE-MTC can operate in the following LTE bands.
UE category M1 and M2 is designed to operate in the E-UTRA operating bands 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 66, 71,
72, 73, 74 and 85 in both half duplex FDD mode and full-duplex FDD mode, and
in bands 39, 40 and 41 in TDD mode.
In Rel-15, the NR operating bands in FR1 are specified as below (see note

Note: The TDD operating band n90 is introduced in Rel-16 specifications as
release independent band from Rel-15. Therefore, it is also added in Table 5-1
as it supports coexistence with LTE-MTC.
Hence potentially LTE-MTC can be operated in the following NR bands in Rel-15.

# 6 LTE-MTC in-band deployment configurations
Coexistence with NR is considered for LTE-MTC in-band operation within
frequency bands listed in section 5. Different in-band deployment
configurations based on FDM and TDM exist, which are considered below for
different NR channel bandwidths.
For coexistence between NR and LTE-MTC in-band operation using FDM, the
overlapping between static SSB signals occupying 20 RBs and the centre 6 PRBs
of the LTE-MTC Narrowband (NB) carrying LTE PSS and NSS as well as PBCH
channel needs to be avoided, since these signals are always active and thus
generate interference to the coexisting system.
6.1 NR channel bandwidth: 5 MHz
For NR channel bandwidth of 5 MHz and SCS=15 kHz, 25 NR RBs can be allocated.
The SSB signal occupies 20 RBs (3,6 MHz) leaving only 5 PRBs (0.9 MHz), which
is too small for allocating 6 centre PRBs for LTE using FDM. Thus, for NR
channel bandwidth of 5 MHz, only mixed TDM / FDM based co-existence is
possible, requiring multiplexing of LTE-MTC and NR static signals in the time
domain to avoid collison overlap, whilst other LTE-MTC and NR signals can be
scheduled at the same time but on different RBs. This can be done in NR using
symbol-level bitmap in the time-domain with repetition pattern in order to
reserve resource for LTE-MTC. In LTE-MTC, resource can be reserved (that will
be used by NR) using invalid subframe bitmap or MBSFN subframe configuration.
Enhancements in Rel-16 are being investigated within the feature enhanced
resource reservation. Further detail on mixed TDM / FDM is given in the
section 8 on simultaneously operation with LTE-MTC and NR.
Note: For the mixed TDM / FDM based coexistence in this NR channel bandwidth,
SCS of 30 kHz is not considered for NR as the guard band on the channel edge
is twice as large as for SCS of 15 kHz.
6.2 NR channel bandwidth: 10 MHz
For NR channel bandwidth of 10 MHz and SCS=15 kHz, 52 NR RBs can be allocated.
The SSB signal occupies 20 RBs (3.6 MHz) leaving an allocation of at least 16
RBs on one side of the SSB to place the centre 6 LTE PRBs. Taking into account
that LTE requires a 5% guard band (single sided), the guard band for LTE-MTC
1.4 MHz equals 160 kHz and hence is less than the NR 10 MHz guard band (312.5
kHz). Thus, no extra guard band towards the channel edge is needed for this
LTE-MTC NB allocation. Therefore, the LTE-MTC NB allocation may be placed at
the outer NR RBs or closer to the SSB. Hence aside a mixed TDM/FDM based
approach, a FDM based approach is possible for this NR channel bandwidth,
which allows to place, in addition to the LTE-MTC NB allocation containing
synchronization and broadcast channels and DC carrier, an LTE-MTC NB with 6
PRBs without DC carrier (e.g. adjacent to each other) on one side of the NR
SSB, thus serving two LTE-MTC NB allocations, leaving room for NR CORESET and
NR traffic channel. Further LTE-MTC NB allocations in case of higher LTE-MTC
traffic may be possible, depending on the location of the SSB. Figure 6-1
below shows both deployment cases.
Note: the exact number of available PRBs for LTE-M depends on the NR sync
raster and the NR carrier frequency. The consideration for SCS = 30 kHz is
FFS. For multiple numerologies a guard band between NR and LTE-MTC NB
allocations may be needed, see section 8.2.
6.3 NR channel bandwidth: 15 MHz
For NR channel bandwidth of 15 MHz and SCS=15 kHz, 79 RBs, respectively, can
be allocated. The SSB signal occupies 20 RBs (3.6 MHz) leaving an allocation
of at least 29 RBs, respectively, on one side of the SSB to place the centre 6
LTE PRBs and up to 3 LTE NBs without DC carrier (i.e. adjacent to each other),
in total 4 LTE-MTC NB allocations, taking into account that the outer NR RBs
again can be used by LTE-MTC NB allocations, similar as for 10 MHz channel
bandwidth. Therefore, the LTE-MTC NB allocations may be placed at the outer NR
RBs or closer to the SSB. Hence aside a mixed TDM/FDM based approach a FDM
based approach is possible for this NR channel bandwidth placing LTE-MTC NB
allocations on one side of the NR SSB, leaving room for the NR CORESET and NR
traffic channel. Further LTE-MTC NB allocations in case of higher LTE-MTC
traffic may be possible, depending on the location of the SSB.
Note: the exact number of available PRBs for LTE-M depends on the NR sync
raster and the NR carrier frequency. The consideration for SCS = 30 kHz is
FFS. For multiple numerologies a guard band between NR and LTE-MTC NB
allocations may be needed, see section 8.2.
This NR channel bandwidth also allows to deploy an LTE-MTC 5 MHz inband
allocation on one side of the SSB. Again, the guard band towards NR channel
edge for the LTE allocation is lower than for NR (250 kHz vs. 382,5 kHz),
hence outer NR RBs can be used as well. Within the LTE-MTC 5 MHz allocation,
LTE NB allocations can be assigend to MTC UEs. This inband configuration can
be used to also serve Cat M2 and non-BL CE UEs in coexistence scenarios.
Figure 6-1 below shows both deployment cases.
NR channel bandwidths, larger than 15 MHz and ranging up to 100 MHz, are also
relevant for coexistence with LTE-MTC, and require similar approaches as
depicted above.
Figure 6-1 illustrates the above depicted exemplary LTE-MTC in-band deployment
configurations using FDM. For 5 MHz NR channel bandwith, no FDM between NR and
LTE-MTC is possible, thus mixed TDM / FDM must be used.
**Figure 6-1: Exemplary in-band LTE-MTC deployment configurations including
legacy 5 MHz LTE allocation for different NR channel bandwidths using FDM.**
# 7 Channel raster, PRB and subcarrier grid alignment
## 7.1 Minimal guard band, subcarrier grid alignment for LTE based and SCS
based channel rasters
Figure 7.1-1: LTE EARFCN configuration within NR carrier with NR channel
raster = 100kHz
Figure 7.1-2: LTE EARFCN configuration within NR carrier with NR channel
raster = 15kHz or 30kHz
In LTE channel raster setting in downlink, there is a DC subcarrier where the
LTE EARFCN coincides with the center of this subcarrier. Because the NR
channel raster definition considers the co- existence with 100kHz channel
raster and subcarrier alignment with LTE, for the NR bands that support the
LTE-MTC co-existence with 100kHz channel raster for FDD band, the LTE EARFCN
can coincide with NR ARFCN at the same frequency location on the center of NR
carrier. This means for downlink the LTE and NR can be aligned in the
subcarrier level, but not in PRB level due to the DC subcarrier in LTE**.**
When NR channel raster is 100kHz, as Figure 7.1-1 shows, if LTE carrier is
configured with other EARFCN than the center of NR carrier (NR-ARFCN), due to
the subcarrier alignment and 100kHz raster, the EARFCN coinciding with NR
channel raster will be multiple of 300kHz offset which is the least common
multiple of 15kHz and 100kHz. In Figure 7-2, an example is given for a 10MHz
NR carrier and a 5 MHz LTE carrier.
When NR channel raster is 15kHz or 30kHz (e.g n41), to have the subcarrier
aligned with LTE and NR, the LTE EARFCN need to have multiple 300kHz offset
with NR ARFCN as shown in Figure 7.2-2. For example, when K=M, LTE EARFCN will
coincide with NR ARFCN, the subcarrier alignment will be achieved. In another
case, if K is not equal to M, there will be multiple 300kHz between EARFCN and
NR-ARFCN, and the subcarrier alignment will still be achieved.
## 7.2 PRB alignment
7.2.1 Impact of LTE-MTC Narrowband Operation
LTE-MTC UEs reuse legacy LTE PSS/SSS/PBCH for initial cell selection, which
occupies the centre 72 subcarriers in the system BW excluding the DC
subcarrier. After MSG1 in the random access procedure, the UE may use only 6
PRBs in a narrowband for transmissions and receptions if no frequency-hopping
is configured. Otherwise hopping between multiple narrowbands may be
performed. The mapping between the narrowband and the PRB is defined in 3GPP
TS 36.211 [3] Section 6.2.7. Figure 7.2-1 illustrates the mapping for system
BW up to 5 MHz.
Figure 7.2.1-1 Mapping between LTE PRB and Narrowband
For up to at least Rel-15 LTE-MTC operation in NR in-band, the number of NR
PRBs reserved for LTE-MTC should be large enough to accommodate all the PRBs
within the LTE transmission BW configuration. Particularly, the PUCCH channel
in the UL always uses the edge PRBs within the system BW.
7.2.2 Intuitive Analysis
Consider the case of SCS=15 kHz for NR. A total of +1 consecutive NR PRBs in
the DL need to be reserved for LTE-MTC owing to the unused DC subcarrier. The
set of allowed values for is given by 3GPP TS 36.104. Depending on the parity
of , the DC subcarrier is either in the middle of a LTE PRB or in between two
LTE PRBs. It's easily seen that LTE PRBs can be aligned with NR PRBs if the
following conditions are satisfied, and at most half of the PRBs in the LTE
system BW can be aligned:
1) The LTE DC subcarrier coincides with
a) the lowest (highest) subcarrier, i.e. subcarrier index 0 (11) of a NR PRB
if is even;
b) the middle subcarrier, i.e. subcarrier index 6 (5) of a NR PRB if is odd;
2) The LTE PRB is on the lower (upper) side of the LTE DC subcarrier.
In the UL, the LTE DC subcarrier is a valid subcarrier that belongs to a PRB
and a 7.5 kHz frequency shift is employed to mitigate the effect of carrier
leakage. Hence, the LTE PRBs may be aligned with the NR PRBs only if the
operating NR band also supports 7.5 kHz frequency shift. Furthermore, owing to
the restrictions of TX-RX frequency separation as defined in 3GPP TS 36.101,
the aforementioned conditions on the DL DC subcarrier should be met so that
the LTE DL PRBs on the lower side of the DC subcarrier are aligned with the NR
DL PRBs. As a result, all of the LTE UL PRBs can be aligned with the NR UL
PRBs.
Figure 7.2-2 illustrates an example of 1.4 MHz LTE carrier inside a NR
carrier. In the DL, the LTE DC subcarrier coincides with the subcarrier 0 of
an NR PRB. As a result, LTE PRB 0, 1 and 2 are aligned with NR PRBs. In the
UL, all LTE PRBs are aligned with NR PRBs after 7.5 kHz shift. Additionally,
Figure 7.2-3 illustrates an example of 3 MHz LTE carrier inside a NR carrier.
In the DL, the LTE DC subcarrier coincides with the subcarrier 6 of an NR PRB.
As a result, LTE PRB 0-6 are aligned with NR PRBs. In the UL, all LTE PRBs are
aligned with NR PRBs after 7.5 kHz shift.
Figure 7.2.2-1: Example PRB alignment for a 1.4 MHz LTE carrier (having one
LTE-MTC NB) inside a NR carrier
Figure 7.2.2-2: Example PRB alignment for a 3 MHz LTE carrier (having two LTE-
MTC NBs) inside a NR carrier
If neither condition #1 nor condition #2 is satisfied, the number of so-called
"outlying" subcarriers in the DL LTE carrier would be more than one. The
outlying subcarriers are those in the lower/upper edge of the LTE carrier and
only partially overlap with a NR RB. Assuming that the LTE DC subcarrier
coincides with subcarrier index
within a NR RB, the number of outlying subcarriers can be derived as:

### 7.2.3 Quantitative analysis
Let and denote the maximum number of RBs in the NR and LTE carrier,
respectively. Let and denotes the RF reference frequency for NR and carrier
frequency for LTE, respectively. It's known that:
\- NR RF reference frequency corresponds to subcarrier 0 of RB if is even, and
it corresponds to subcarrier 6 of RB if is odd;
\- LTE carrier frequency corresponds to the DC subcarrier with extra 7.5 kHz
offset in the UL. In the DL, it locates between two adjacent RBs if is even,
and it locates in the middle of a RB if is odd.
In order to optimize resource utilization, it is desired to align LTE PRBs
with NR PRBs (in fact at most half of the PRBs in the DL and all in the UL as
described in Section 7.2.2). In the following, we further formulate the
conditions described in Section 7.2.2 based on different NR channel raster
sizes.
7.2.3.1 NR 100 kHz Channel Raster
For subcarrier alignment (SCS=15 kHz), the NR RF reference frequency and LTE
carrier frequency should satisfy the following condition:
(7.2.3.1-1)
with:
\- being an integer identifying the LTE carrier on the 100 kHz raster, i.e.
kHz;
\- being an integer identifying the NR carrier on the 100 kHz raster, i.e.
kHz;
\- being an integer representing the subcarrier offset from the NR RF
reference frequency.
Re-write Eq. (7.2.3.1-1) as:
(7.2.3.1-2)
For the sake of the variable being an integer, the value of has to be a
multiple of 3, i.e., , with being an integer. Therefore, Eq. (7.2.3.1-2) can
be re-written as:
, with being an integer (7.2.3.1-3).
This means that the offset of the LTE carrier from the NR RF reference
frequency should be a multiple of 20 subcarriers (i.e., a multiple of 300
kHz). We also have if the LTE carrier is on the upper side of the NR carrier
and if the LTE carrier is on the lower side. Next we further derive the LTE
carrier position in terms of RB offset as well as subcarrier index within a
RB.
If is even, the NR RF reference frequency corresponds to subcarrier 0 of RB .
Hence, we have:
\- , the RB offset from the NR RB containing the subcarrier corresponding to
\- , the index of the subcarrier corresponding to
With these definitions, we re-write as:
, (7.2.3.1-4)
or (7.2.3.1-5).
It can be seen that valid values for subcarrier index are: 0, 4 and 8. Note
that the value of RB offset is limited by the NR channel bandwidth, i.e. . For
ensuring subcarrier alignment between the LTE-MTC carrier and the NR carrier,
the task is to find a suitable solution of that satisfies Eq. (7.2.3.1-4).
Further considering PRB alignment, the condition #1a as described in Section
7.2.2 may be met if additional constraint of is added. However, the condition
#1b as described in Section 7.2.2 can never be met since is not valid. This is
also indicated by the number of LTE outlying subcarriers corresponding to NR
subcarrier index as shown in Table 7.2.3.1-1, which matches the observation in
RAN1 [4].

Note: The value shown in bold corresponds to the condition #1a in Section
7.2.2.
On the other hand, if is odd, the NR RF reference frequency corresponds to
subcarrier 6 of RB .
Taking this offset into account, we have for RB offset and for subcarrier
index. And Eq. (7.2.3.1-3) can be re-written as:
, (7.2.3.1-6)
or (7.2.3.1-7).
It can be seen that valid values for subcarrier index are: 2, 6 and 10. For
ensuring subcarrier alignment between the LTE-MTC carrier and the NR carrier,
the task is to find a suitable solution of that satisfies Eq. (7.2.3.1-6).
Further considering PRB alignment, the condition #1b as described in Section
7.2.2 may be met if additional constraint of is added. However, the condition
#1a as described in Section 7.2.2 can never be met since is not valid. This is
also indicated by the number of LTE outlying subcarriers corresponding to NR
subcarrier index as shown in Table 7.2.3.1-2, which matches the observation in
RAN1 [4].

7.2.3.2 NR 15 kHz Channel Raster
Corresponding to the E-UTRA bands that support LTE-MTC, most of the NR
counterparts use 100 kHz channel raster. So far, only band n41 uses SCS-based
channel raster. For the sake of PRB alignment, only SCS=15 kHz is considered.
Considering subcarrier alignment, the NR reference frequency and LTE carrier
frequency should satisfy the following condition:
, (7.2.3.2-1)
with:
being an integer identifying the LTE carrier on the 100 kHz raster, i.e. kHz;
being an integer identifying the NR carrier on the 15 kHz raster, i.e. kHz;
being an integer representing the subcarrier offset from the NR RF reference
frequency.
Rewrite Eq. (7.2.3.1-1) as:
. (7.2.3.2-2)
This means that the LTE carrier should be on a raster of 300 kHz, i.e. , with
being an integer. Together with Eq. (7.2.3.2-2), we have:
. (7.2.3.2-3)
Reusing the definition of RB offset and subcarrier index in Section 7.2.3.1,
we have:
, if is even, (7.2.3.2-4)
, if is odd. (7.2.3.2-5)
Note that the values of and are limited by the NR channel bandwidth, e.g. .
For ensuring subcarrier alignment between the LTE-MTC carrier and the NR
carrier, the task is to find a suitable solution of that satisfies Eq.
(7.2.3.2-4) or Eq. (7.2.3.2-5), for a given NR reference frequency, i.e. fixed
. Further considering PRB alignment, the conditions on subcarrier index as
described in Section 7.2.2 should be met as additional constraints. Note that
such a solution may not always exist.
### 7.2.4 Summary
The conditions for PRB alignment between LTE-MTC carrier and NR carrier are
discussed. Section 7.2.2 provides an intuitive analysis, which is confirmed by
the quantitative analysis in Section 7.2.3. Additionally, more insights are
acquired through the numerical analysis, which are summarized in the following
tables.

100 kHz Eq (7.2.3.1-3) The frequency offset between the LTE-MTC carrier and
the NR carrier should be multiple of 300 kHz. 15 kHz Eq (7.2.3.2-3) The LTE-
MTC carrier frequency should be a multiple of 300 kHz.

Based on the above listed conditions, it is also found that the choice of the
NR subcarrier index (within a RB) for placing the LTE-MTC carrier is limited.
And different choices result in different number of outlying subcarriers in
the LTE-MTC carrier, for which the minimization is usually desired in order to
optimize spectrum utilization. Table 7.2.4-3 summarizes the observations for
100 kHz NR channel raster size.

# 8 Simultaneous operation with LTE-MTC and NR
8.1 Collision avoidance for static and other NR signals
When an LTE-M service coexists with NR within a NR carrier, the legacy LTE-M
device will operate on the carrier configured as a normal LTE carrier without
awareness of NR signals. The NR device, however, could be aware of other
technology with NR R15 feature of rate-matching the PDSCH around resource
elements used by LTE. For the signal sent from LTE which cannot be rate-
matched by the NR device, scheduler or configuration coordination is needed to
avoid collision between NR and LTE transmissions (or signals). The LTE signals
can be classified as static signals and dynamic signals, where the static
signals are "always on" signals and shall be always transmitted. The dynamic
signals are traffic specific and scheduled in the real time.
An LTE carrier resource grid for FDD band is shown in Figure 8-1.
**Figure 8-1: Resource grid for downlink signal of the LTE carrier BW=1.4MHz
and 4 CRS antenna ports.**
As shown in Figure 8-1 for the downlink LTE signal (FDD band) without the
scheduled PDSCH,
1) PDCCH in the first 1, 2 or 3 symbols depending on the CFI configuration,
minimum is 1 symbol for CFI=1 for every subframe (except in the special case
with 1.4 MHz system bandwidth when the number of symbols is 2, 3 or 4),
2) PSS/SSS is configured every 5 ms at symbol 5, 6 in the middle 6 PRBs.
3) PBCH is transmitted at slot 1 every 10ms.
4) CRS (4 ports) signal on symbols 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 11,
5) The DMRS (4 port), on symbols 5, 6, 12, 13,
6) CSI-RS (4 ports) every 10 ms, on symbols 5, 6, 12, 13.
For uplink LTE signals, they are PUCCH and PUSCH, PRACH and SRS which is
configurable.
As the DMRS and CSI-RS occupy PDSCH positions, they can be treated as dynamic
signals same as PDSCH which is UE specific. NR signals should avoid the
overlapping of LTE static signals so the legacy LTE UE performance will not be
affected.
For LTE-M, the cell-specific subframe bitmap broadcasted on the System
Information (SI) indicates which subframes are capable of LTE-M transmissions.
On top of this, there are additional signals MPDCCH and RSS signal:
MPDCCH: MPDCCH carries the LTE-M downlink control information (DCI) and maps
to the LTE PDSCH region.
RSS (Resynchronization Signal): Maps to the LTE PDSCH region at periodicity of
8, 16, 32 or 40 subframes and 2 consecutive PRBs.
LTE-M subframes can be configured as valid or invalid for LTE-M transmission,
and invalid subframes are not used for LTE-M transmissions. LTE-M signals
occupy the NR PDSCH region which makes it possible for an NR UE to perform
rate matching around it. For the PDCCH, PSS/SSS/PBCH in the middle 6 PRBs, and
CRS are static signals that are always transmitted.
NR has the following channels and signals:
1) SSB, default 20ms periodicity,
2) TRS, needed for PDSCH demodulation
3) CORESET #0 for transmitting PDCCH for SIB1 scheduling SIB1
4) PDCCH at symbol 2,
5) PDSCH + DMRS
6) CSI-RS, symbol 12 and 13
In the NR signals, the SSB signal is a mandatory transmission for the UE
initial cell search and thus is a static signal. CORESET #0 is also a static
signal which is mandatory to transmit. The other reference signals to help
demodulate the PDSCH should not collide with LTE signal so the NR UE
performance would be preserved. A solution for avoiding the LTE static signals
when NR static signals are transmitted will be needed and one of the options
is to use the MBSFN subframes in LTE and the other one is using LTE-MTC
invalid subframe bitmaps.
**[MBSFN in LTE:]{.underline}**
MBSFN is an LTE Release 9 feature, so for the LTE-M from R13, there is no
problem for the LTE-M device with the awareness of the MBSFN subframe
configuration. The LTE-M will ignore these MBSFN subframes so these MBMS
subframes could be used for NR to transmit the static signals or other
important signals which otherwise would collide with LTE signals.
The number and locations of MBSFN subframes within a specific radio frame are
defined in SIB2 with MBSFN-SubframeConfig IE. It is determined by two
parameters radioframeAllocationPeriod and radioframeAllocationOffset, as long
as below equation is fulfilled for the MBSFN configuration,
[SFN] _mod_ [radioframeAllocationPeriod] = radioframeAllocationOffset
With the MBSFN subframe, LTE-M device could ignore the NR "always on" signal
contained in MBSFN frames seen by LTE-M device. Furthermore, in R15, NR can
reserve resources using a bitmap for the NR PDSCH region, so NR signals can be
rate matched by NR UEs around the resource elements used by LTE signals. By
utilizing these methods and scheduler help for uplink, the LTE and NR will
avoid the colliding signal each other and can coexist within a NR carrier.
Table 8-1 and Table 8-2 lists summary of protection schemes for static signals
in two system.

8.2 Numerologies
As NR could support several numerology, e.g. 15KHz, 30KHz and 60KHz in FR1
which might be different from LTE-MTC numerologies (only support 15KHz SCS in
downlink and uplink), there might exist mixed numerology configuration which
could result in interference between NR subcarrier and LTE-MTC subcarrier In
general, guardband between different numerology should be reserved for
performance protection, however this should be up to the BS implementation.
Similar as the mixed numerology in the NR scenarios, no requirement is defined
for mixed numerology between NR and LTE-MTC. In case of LTE-MTC is located
close to the channel edge of NR channel bandwidth, the minimum guardband at
channel edge is illustrated in Figure 7.1-1.
Figure 7.1-1. the guard band for NR coexist with MTC
8.3 Power boosting for LTE-MTC
This section investigates the impact from power boosting applied to LTE-MTC
for coexistence with NR.
### 8.3.1 Signalling range
Power boosting for LTE-MTC was introduced in Rel-15 for the purpose of
enhanced coverage and improved power saving. In particular this is applied to
RSS (Re-Synchronization Signal) introduced in Rel-15 to allow the BL/CE UE to
perform faster network synchronization in DRX periods after wake-up from light
sleep. RSS is transmitted as part of MPDCCH.
RSS uses two consecutive RBs which can be allocated anywhere, according to
3GPP TS 36.331, in the configured LTE channel bandwidth (i.e. frequency
location is one RB pair out of 100 RBs covering the 20 MHz bandwidth case).
According to 3GPP TS 36.213, the power offset for RSS EPRE versus CRS EPRE
depends on the number of cell specific antenna ports. For one cell specific
antenna port, the power offset versus CRS EPRE can be {0, 3, 4.8 and 6 dB), as
specified in 3GPP TS 36.331. Power stealing across other RBs can be applied.
However, RSS is transmitted with given periodicity and at most in 25% of the
subframes (3GPP TS 36.331).
MWUS (MTC Wake-Up Signal) introduced in Rel-15 to allow the BL/CE UE to save
energy for the purpose of paging monitoring. Rather than to decode the paging
channel data for determining if a paging request is received, a wake-up signal
was specified to indicate a valid page in the next PO to the UE. MWUS is
transmitted as part of MPDCCH.
MWUS uses two consecutive RBs which are allocated in the configured paging
narrowband (6 RBs), thus allowing for three disjunct allocations. According to
3GPP TS 36.331, only one RB pair is allocated per cell for MWUS.
According to 3GPP TS 36.213, the power offset for MWUS EPRE versus CRS EPRE
depends on the number of cell specific antenna ports. For one cell specific
antenna port, the power offset versus CRS EPRE can be {0, 1.8, 3 and 4.8 dB),
as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331. However, MWUS sequence has a limited duration
and is not transmitted in all subframes. Power stealing across other RBs can
be applied.
GMWUS (group MWUS) added in Rel-16 to allow the BL/CE UEs to be grouped and to
dedicate a wake-up signal not to all UEs (common WUS) but to a particular UE
group to make paging monitoring even more efficient. GMWUS is transmitted as
part of MPDCCH.
GMWUS uses two consecutive RBs which are allocated in the configured paging
narrowband (6 RBs), allowing for two disjunct allocations. Up to 2 GMWUS can
be allocated per cell. In case 2 GMWUS and 1 MWUS are FDM'ed in the paging
narrowband, all 6 RBs in the NB are transmitted.
For GMWUS, the same power offset versus CRS EPRE applies as for MWUS. Thus,
for a cell transmitting MWUS and 2 GMWUS, the power offset versus CRS may go
up to 4.8 dB in the narrowband, which requires power stealing from outside the
narrowband. Again, GMWUS sequence has a limited duration and is not
transmitted in all subframes.
Thus, LTE-MTC RBs carrying RSS, MWUS or GMWUS in MPDCCH, can have a higher PSD
versus other LTE-MTC RBs of up to 6 dB due to the signalling range.
### 8.3.2 Minimum NR BS requirements for RE Power control dynamic range
On the other side, minimum requirements for power boosting for NR BS exist in
3GPP TS 38.104. In particular, subclause 6.3.2.2 specifies minimum
requirements for RE power control dynamic range, where power offset above and
below average RE power for a BS at maximum output power is specified. This
defines a range between -6 dB and +4 dB for QPSK (PDCCH) and between -6 dB and
+3 dB for QPSK (PDSCH), which needs to be supported by the NR BS. These power
dynamic ranges are the same as specified for LTE in 3GPP TS 36.104, subclause
6.3.1.1. As MPDCCH maps to LTE PDSCH region and also uses QPSK modulation,
from RF perspective similar power boosting performance is expected to be
achieved as for NR / LTE RE power boosting for PDSCH (using QPSK).
In conclusion, the NR BS is not mandated to support power boosting for LTE-MTC
RBs, which are allocated within the NR transmission bandwidth. The NR BS may
support power boosting for LTE-MTC RBs according to the above depicted
signalling range, provided that the network still fulfils existing RF
performance requirements.
8.4 Specific aspects for TDD
LTE-MTC supports all E-UTRA TDD configurations as specified in 3GPP TS 36.211
[3]. In the meantime, NR TDD configurations are very flexible. Not only slots
but also individual symbols within a slot can be configured as either DL, UL
or flexible (i.e. GP). For the sake of co-existence, the NR TDD configuration
should be set up to match that of LTE-MTC.
More explicitly, two different patterns may be configured via the IE TDD-UL-
DL-ConfigCommon in SIB1. Furthermore, the common settings may be overridden by
UE specific configuration: TDD-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated. Table 8.4-1 shows the
details of the RRC signalling.

nrofUplinkSymbols Specifies a partial UL slot, together with other UL slots

The main limitation of the NR TDD configuration is that the pattern has to be
defined in the order of DL, GP and UL. A combination use of TDD-UL-DL-
ConfigCommon and TDD-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated shall enable the NR TDD
configuration to match that of any LTE UL-DL configuration. For example, Table
8.4-2 shows the NR TDD configuration that matches the LTE-MTC uplink/downlink
configuration 1 with the special subframe configuration 7 (i.e.
uplink/downlink subframe ratio is 1:1, DwPTS = 10 symbols, GP = 2 symbols,
UpPTS = 2 symbols).

# 9 **Synchronization issue between LTE-MTC and NR**
In order to analyze the LTE-M coexisting with NR, longest CP and shortest CP
for NR are considered as two extreme cases in which whether timing
misalignment between LTE-M and NR would exceed CP or not could be identified.
If 15kHz SCS is used in the NR carrier where NR has the longest CP, then the
TAGs misalignment analysis between LTE-M and NR will be the same as that
between LTE-M and E-UTRA. Therefore,there should be no interference issue due
to TAGs misalignment between LTE-M and NR if 15kHz SCS is used in the NR
system, otherwise such issue would have occurred already between LTE-M and
E-UTRA before the migration to NR. Meanwhile some detailed analysis is done in
Case 1 where it could be found that timing misalignment between LTE-M and NR
is still within the CP, this also indicates there should be no interference
issues due to TAGs misalignement.
On the other hand, if 30kHz or 60kHz SCS is used in the NR carrier, the LTE-M
UE maximum transmit timing error of 60Ts (= 48Ts+4Ts+8Ts) alone as explained
in the following will be larger than the CP length of the NR symbol.
Therefore, when the NR UE maximum transmit timing error (which is varied
according to the SCS used in the NR carrier) is also considered, there would
potentially be interference issue due to the inter-symbol-interference between
the LTE-M and NR symbols as illustrated in Case 2. However, it has been agreed
that this type of mixed numerology cases between LTE-M and NR should be up to
the BS implementation and no requirement is defined in the RAN4
specifications. Feasible BS implementation options include separate digital
filtering and internal gap between the LTE-M and NR carriers.
**Case 1: the timing misalignment scenario with NR SCS 15KHz**
For NR UE transmit timing, if uplink subcarrier spacing is configured with
15KHz and SSB SCS is configured with 15KHz which is specified with worst
transmit timing error for uplink SCS 15KHz, the maximum transmit timing error
should be 12*64*Tc+256*Tc+8*64*Tc equal to (12+4+8)*64*Tc equal to 24*Ts which
is the same as the maximum LTE UE transmitting error. Based on the above
considerations, maximum arrival timing difference between NR carrier and LTE-
MTC carrier should be 2.7344us as shown in Figure 8.1 which is less than the
NR CP length 4.96us if SCS 15KHz is configured for NR.
Figure 9.1. the maximum arrival timing difference between NR and LTE-M in
Uplink
**Case 2: the timing misalignment scenario with NR SCS 60KHz**
For NR UE transmit timing, if uplink subcarrier spacing is configured with
60KHz and SSB SCS configured with 30KHz which is specified with the worst
transmit timing error for uplink SCS 60KHz, the maximum transmit timing error
should be 10*64*Tc+128*Tc+8*64*Tc/4 equal to 14 Ts (0.4557us). Based on the
above consideration, the maximum arrival timing difference between NR carrier
an LTE-M carrier should be 2.4088us as shown in Figure 8.2 which is larger
than the NR CP length 1.17us if SCS 60KHz is configured for NR.
Figure 9.2. the maximum arrival timing difference between NR and LTE-M in
Uplink.
# 10 **Testability applicability**
When LTE-M service is configured within one NR carrier at BS, the LTE-M UE
operate it as LTE carrier so no new test on LTE-M UE will be needed.
For a BS supporting both LTE and NR, there is no NR RF impact foreseen because
NR can avoid the LTE signal using either dynamic scheduling or MBSFN subframe
seen by LTE-M UE. Transmitting LTE signal within a NR carrier does not change
the NR signal characteristic and performance (unwanted emission, TX signal
quality etc), similarly, receiving a LTE signal on NR BS would not require
additional performance requirement. Therefore, no additional test will be
needed when LTE-M coexisting within NR carrier. In such case, NR BS RF spec
would still apply.
# 11 LTE-MTC coexisting with NR specific feature in R16
## 11.1 Subcarrier puncturing
Figure 11.1-1: Illustrative example of RB misalignment between NR and LTE-MTC
in DL.
In R16, subcarrier puncturing is introduced as a feature to further improve
spectrum utilization for the NR coexisting with LTE-MTC deployment scenario.
This feature is useful for handling RB misalignment between NR and LTE-MTC in
DL, as shown in Figure 11.1-1. By puncturing we refer to the case where the
base station avoids transmitting the subcarriers belonging to LTE-MTC with or
without informing the UEs. This will cause somewhat degraded performance for
the UE whose transmission is punctured (up to 2 subcarrier punctured), but the
eNB/gNB scheduler is aware of this, and may compensate by proper adjustment of
code rates etc. It should be noted that in DL, since NR UEs can rate match
around LTE CRS, there is no need to puncture CRS when it is on outlying
subcarriers.
## 11.2 Resource reservation
In R16, finer LTE-MTC resource reservation than subframe level is introduced.
LTE-MTC resource reservation for DL can be configured at slot level or symbol
level. UL resource reservation for LTE-MTC with slot-level and symbol(s)-level
granularity in addition to subframe-level granularity is supported. For DL,
frequency-domain resource reservation is also supported, and non-contiguous
PRB allocation can be indicated using an RBG bitmap. The unused frequency/time
resources for LTE-MTC then can be used by an NR UE. As a result, the NR
spectrum utilization will be improved when the traffic on LTE-MTC cell is low.
# 12 **Summary**
MSR BS supporting NR and E-UTRA can operate NR with LTE-MTC in-band allocation
and there is no need to introduce new conformance testing. To ensure efficient
operation for coexistence of NR with LTE-MTC, certain technical considerations
as described in Chapter 7 & 8 are needed for channel raster, PRB and
subcarrier alignment, LTE-MTC power boosting and simultaneous operation of
LTE-MTC and NR.
