## 4.1 Work item objective
The objective the TSG RAN Work Item is to first identify relevant scenarios
and then write an RF requirements specification that is applicable to Multi-
Standard Radio (MSR) Base Station with multiple carriers and/or multiple 3GPP
Radio Access Technologies (RAT), according to the following:
\- The new specification will cover RF requirements for GSM, UTRA, and E-UTRA
(both FDD and TDD modes), for relevant single and multicarrier scenarios and
will take into account the regulatory framework in different regions.
\- The new specification will include BS transmission and reception
requirements, but no baseband performance requirements.
\- Existing RF specifications will remain and be applicable within their
current scope.
\- For a multi-RAT/multi-carrier Base Station, the new RF requirements
specification will be applicable for that equipment, together with the
baseband requirements of the relevant existing specifications.
The objective of the TSG GERAN Work Task is to support the RAN4 Work Item
Building Block, which has the objective to first identify relevant technology
migration scenarios and then write an RF requirements specification that is
applicable to Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) Base Station.
The Work Task will review the GERAN relevant parts and prepare input for
adapting the existing GERAN requirements to an MSR specification with a goal
to minimize changes to these requirements.
## 4.2 Relation to other RAN and GERAN specifications
The requirements for MSR are in most parts specified in the present document,
while many requirements are also specified through normative references to the
respective single-RAT specifications in [2], [3], [4] and [5]. The resulting
set of requirements for an MSR BS can be divided into three types, depending
on their relation to the single-RAT specifications:
1\. **Generic MSR requirement:** A common generic requirement is specified in
the present document that applies for all RATs and for BS configured for both
multi-RAT and single-RAT operation. In some cases, there are additional
requirement(s) that apply only in some Band Category. There are no references
to the single-RAT specifications.
2\. **Generic MSR requirement, with additional single-RAT requirements:** A
common generic requirement is specified in the present document which applies
as in point 1. In addition some single RAT requirement(s) apply, included by
normative reference(s) to the single-RAT specification(s).
3\. **Single-RAT only requirements:** In this case, no common generic
requirement is defined. The existing single-RAT requirement applies for each
RAT, included by normative reference(s) to the single-RAT specification(s).
## 4.3 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
For UTRA and E-UTRA, the Minimum Requirements given in the core specifications
[2][3][4] make no allowance for measurement uncertainty. The test
specifications [17][18][19] define Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are
individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax
the Minimum Requirements in the core specifications to create Test
Requirements.
For some regulatory requirements taken directly from international or regional
recommendations or other regulatory references, the test tolerance is set to
zero. This concerns the requirements for Spurious emissions and Operating band
unwanted emissions.
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -- without
any modification -- against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared
risk principle. The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [21].
For GSM, the shared risk principle is also applied, with the test requirement
in TS 51.021 [20] normally being the same as the requirement defined in the
core specification [5].
### 4.3.1 Relationship for requirements developed for MSR
For the minimum requirements developed in the present Technical Report with
the purpose to set MSR multi-RAT requirements in the MSR specification, no
allowance is given for measurement uncertainty. For the test specification,
test Tolerances will be individually calculated for each test and be used to
relax the Minimum Requirements in the core specification to create Test
Requirements. For some requirements, including regulatory requirements, the
test tolerance is set to zero.
For MSR single-RAT requirements, the principle used to define the test
requirement remains from the existing specifications.
For both MSR single-RAT and multi-RAT requirements, the measurement results
returned by the Test System are compared -- without any modification --
against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk principle.
## 4.4 Base Station classes
The requirements presented in this TR apply to MSR Base Stations intended for
general purpose applications. MSR BS requirements for general purpose
applications will be based on Wide Area scenarios.
For GSM operation of an MSR BS, a BS intended for general purpose applications
corresponds to a normal BTS, including Multicarrier BTS classes. MSR
requirements for multi-RAT operation only apply for the highest GSM static
power step.
Other Base Station classes are for further study. The requirements for these
may be different than those for general purpose applications, or not
applicable at all.
## 4.5 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements, or set by local and regional regulation as
mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances that the requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.5-1 lists all requirements for the MSR specification that may be
applied differently in different regions. There are additional regional
requirements that may apply for single-RAT operation of an MSR BS. These are
listed in the specification for the RATs concerned [2][3][4][5].
Table 4.5-1: List of regional requirements

bands may be applied regionally. 6.2 Base Station output power The limit on
the rated output power declared by the manufacturer applies in Japan for an
E-UTRA BS operating in band 34. 6.6.1.1 Existing regulatory requirements (UEM)
Regulatory requirements may apply regionally. 6.6.1.7 Additional requirements

established by FCC Title 47 [11], when deployed in regions where those limits
are applied, and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.. 6.6.1.9
Additional requirement (BC3) The requirements for unsynchronized TDD co-
existence may apply regionally 6.6.2.1 Mandatory requirements (spurious
emissions) Category A limits are mandatory for regions where Category A limits
for spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [2] apply.
Category B limits are mandatory for regions where Category B limits for
spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [2] apply.
6.6.2.1.2, 6.6.2.2.2, 6.6.2.3.2 Co-existence in the same geographical area

system operating in frequency ranges other than the MSR BS operating band.
(Note 1) 6.6.2.1.3, 6.6.2.2.3, 6.6.2.3.3 Co-location (spurious emissions)
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when a BS operating in another frequency band is co-located with an MSR BS.
6.6.3 Occupied bandwidth The requirement may be applied regionally. There may
also be regional requirements to declare the Occupied bandwidth according to
the definition. 7.5.1.2, 7.5.2.2 Co-location (blocking) These requirements may
be applied for the protection of the BS receiver when a BS operating in
another frequency band is co-located with an MSR BS. NOTE 1: These
requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. The limits may
apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating band. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or
under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by
local or regional regulation.

# 5 Multi-Standard Radio scenarios
## 5.1 Definitions
### 5.1.1 Frequency bands and arrangements
#### 5.1.1.1 General
The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the operating
bands and channel bandwidths defined in the present release of specifications
[2-5]. E-UTRA related requirements in the present document are specified for
the channel bandwidths listed in subclause 5.6 of [4].
NOTE: Other operating bands and channel bandwidths may be considered in future
releases.
#### 5.1.1.2 Frequency bands
In the present version of the UTRA specifications, there are 15 operating
bands defined for UTRA FDD [2] designated with Roman numerals and 6 operating
bands defined for UTRA TDD [3] designated alphabetically.
In the present version of the E-UTRA specifications [4], there are 19 paired
and 8 unpaired operating bands defined, all designated with Arabic numerals.
In the present version of the GSM specifications [5], there are 14 operating
bands defined, all designated with individual names.
In the context of MSR, the operating bands are grouped into Band Categories
(BC). The relation between the operating bands for each RAT and how these are
categorized is shown in Table 5.2-1 for the paired bands and in Table 5.3-1
for the unpaired bands. The RAT-specific operating band designations for each
operating band remain unchanged for MSR.
#### 5.1.1.3 Channel spacing
The GSM/EDGE carrier spacing is 200 kHz [5].
The nominal UTRA channel spacing is 5 MHz for FDD. The nominal channel spacing
is 1.6MHz for 1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD Option (TD-SCDMA). These can be adjusted to
optimise performance in a particular deployment scenario [2,3].
In E-UTRA the spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario,
the size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The
nominal channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined as
following:
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario [4].
#### 5.1.1.4 Channel raster
The GSM/EDGE channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands [5].
The UTRA FDD and TDD channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that
the centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a
number of additional centre frequencies are specified according to [2,3],
which means that the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted 100 kHz
relative to the general raster.
The E-UTRA channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the
carrier centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz [4].
The channel raster for E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM overlap in such a way that all
RATs support a common 200 kHz raster in Band Category 1, 2 and 3. For UTRA and
E-UTRA in Band Category 1 and 3, there are also some common carrier
frequencies on a 100 kHz raster.
#### 5.1.1.5 Carrier frequency and channel numbers
The GSM/EDGE carrier frequency is designated by the absolute radio frequency
channel number (ARFCN) [5]. Channel numbers are defined in a way that is
uniquely defined for most operating bands, while there is also a possibility
for dynamically mapped ARFCNs in some bands as described in clause 2 of [5].
The UTRA carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN) [2,3]. Channel numbers are uniquely defined for each
operating band (except for Band V and VI) as described in subclause 5.4 of
[2]. The UARFCN scheme with unique numbers supports inter-band mobility and
inter-RAT inter-working.
The UTRA TDD channel numbers have a one-to-one mapping to the carrier
frequency as described in subclause 5.4 of [2]. This implies that in case of
operating bands that overlap in frequency, the UARFCN are not uniquely defined
for each band. It should be noted that numbering schemes for UTRA FDD and TDD
are not coordinated, while both are called UARFCN.
The E-UTRA carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the
E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) [4]. Channel numbers
are uniquely defined for each operating band (paired and unpaired) as
described in subclause 5.7 of [4]. The EARFCN scheme with unique numbers
supports inter-band mobility and inter-RAT inter-working.
In the context of MSR, the frequency numbering scheme for each RAT will
remain.
### 5.1.2 RF bandwidth in MSR specification
The following terminology and symbols have been agreed as a basis for MSR RF
bandwidth related aspects. This terminology is illustrated in Fig 5.1.2-1.
**F~C,high~** Center frequency of the highest transmitted/received carrier.
**F~C,low~** Center frequency of the lowest transmitted/received carrier.
**F~offset,\ RAT~** Frequency offset from F~C,high~ to the _upper RF bandwidth
edge_ or F~C,low~ to the _lower RF bandwidth edge_ for a specific _RAT_.
**Upper RF bandwidth edge:** The frequency at the upper edge of the RF
bandwidth located at F~BW\ RF,high~ = F~C,high~ + F~offset,\ RAT~. It is used
as a frequency reference point for both transmitter and receiver requirements.
**Lower RF bandwidth edge:** The frequency at the lower edge of the RF
bandwidth located at F~BW\ RF,low~ = F~C,low~ -- F~offset,\ RAT~. It is used
as a frequency reference point for both transmitter and receiver requirements.
**RF bandwidth, BW~RF~:** The RF bandwidth in which a Base Station transmits
and receives multiple carriers and/or RATs simultaneously, BW~RF~ = F~BW\
RF,high~ -- F~BW\ RF,low~.
**Maximum RF bandwidth** , BW~RF,max~: The maximum value for BW~RF~ supported
by the BS within an operating band.
Fig 5.1.2-1 RF bandwidth related symbols within the MSR specification.
The above terminology shall be understood as follows:
\- The RF bandwidth, BW~RF~, corresponds to the active RF bandwidth in a
certain deployment scenario. No specific HW capability, such as RF filter BW
or RX/TX characteristics (PA operating BW, IF filters, etc.), corresponds
directly to this value; it is merely a construct for applying RF requirements
to a specific configuration with multiple carriers and/or RATs. BW~RF~ is not
declared by the manufacturer.
\- The Maximum RF bandwidth, BW~RF,max~, on the other hand is a BS HW
capability and is declared by the manufacturer. Obviously BW~RF~ ≤ BW~RF,max~.
\- MSR RF bandwidth edges (F~BW\ RF,high~ and F~BW\ RF,low~) serve as
frequency reference points for both transmitter and receiver requirements. As
an example, the Operating band unwanted emission requirements would start
above the upper and below the lower RF bandwidth edges located at F~BW\
RF,high~ and F~BW\ RF,low~. The RF bandwidth edge can also be seen as a
demarcation frequency between uncoordinated operators and in many scenarios it
therefore coincides with the license block edge, while in other scenarios the
license block edge may be located outside or even slightly inside the RF
bandwidth.
The rationale for this is as follows. The channel edge within the E-UTRA
(UTRA) specifications is assumed to coincide with the license block edge of
uncoordinated 3GPP systems. This is a worst-case from an interference point of
view and gives the operator the assurance that no additional guard bands need
to be reserved to facilitate mutual co-existence of same-band uncoordinated
3GPP systems.
Furthermore, the additional FCC Title 47 requirements [11] applicable at the
license block edge, are also included within the E-UTRA (UTRA) specifications,
they are however defined in reference to the channel edge.
It seems natural to assume for the MSR RF bandwidth edges (F~BW\ RF,high~ and
F~BW\ RF,low~) the same role, i.e. to serve as the default demarcation
frequency between uncoordinated operators and as a frequency reference point
for additional license block edge related regulatory requirements (e.g. FCC
Title 47 emission limits [11]). Note however that while serving as a frequency
reference point for RF requirements, the RF bandwidth edge may in some
scenarios not coincide with the license block edge.
While TS 45.005 [5] uses different concepts for specifying OOB limits and in
particular, has no definition corresponding to the E-UTRA (UTRA) channel edge,
the above principle is seen also as meaningful for RF scenarios involving
uncoordinated GSM systems.
\- Values for **F~offset,\ RAT~** needed in order to meet TX and RX
requirements will be part of the MSR specifications. **F~offset,\ RAT~** will
be specific for each RAT in each Band Category.
## 5.2 FDD multi-RAT and multicarrier scenarios
To structure the possible FDD scenarios and resulting requirements, the bands
divided into two categories:
\- Band category 1: Bands for UTRA FDD and E-UTRA FDD operation
\- Band category 2: Bands for UTRA FDD, E-UTRA FDD and GSM operation
A full set of paired bands and how they are categorized is shown in Table
5.2-1.

## 5.3 TDD multi-RAT and multicarrier scenarios
To structure the possible TDD scenarios and resulting requirements, the
unpaired bands are put in a third category:
• Band category 3: Bands for UTRA TDD/TD-SCDMA and E-UTRA TDD operation
A full set of unpaired bands and how they are categorized is shown in Table

### 5.3.1 Band category 3 scenarios (1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD and E-UTRA TDD)
1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD option (TD-SCDMA) and E-UTRA TDD can have multiple uplink
and downlink configurations, with TD-SCDMA having UL:DL=5:2, 4:3, 3:4, 2:5 and
1:6 configurations and E-UTRA TDD having UL:DL=3:1, 2:2, 1:3 configurations
with 5 ms periodicity. However, due to the mix of bandwidths and technologies
sharing common radio resources in MSR, it is difficult for TD-SCDMA and E-UTRA
TDD sharing the common RF in arbitrary UL:DL configurations manner. According
to the UL:DL configurations with TD-SCDMA and E-UTRA TDD defined in [3] and
[2] , the interference will be unacceptable if the TD-SCDMA and E-UTRA TDD in
10 ms periodicity co-exist in the same geographical region with co-located and
co-sited Base Stations. Furthermore, one UL:DL configuration of E-UTRA TDD
with 5 ms periodicity can co-exist with one unique associated UL:DL
configuration of TD-SCDMA if they are co-sited or co-located.
Figure 5.3.1-1: Alignment of TD-SCDMA and E-UTRA TDD
Figure 5.3.1-1 shows that the UL:DL=5:2, 3:4 and 2:5 configurations of TD-
SCDMA can coexist with UL:DL= 3:1, 2:2 and 1:3 configurations of E-UTRA TDD
respectively. Consider minimizing the interference between the TD-SCDMA and
E-UTRA TDD, UL and DL alignment of TD-SCDMA and E-UTRA TDD with 5ms
periodicity will be assumed in the initial work stage of MSR; For E-UTRA TDD
with 10 ms periodicity and TD-SCDMA deployment scenarios, it might be very
difficult to define the RF requirements for the TD-SCDMA and E-UTRA TDD co-
existence in MSR mode and this case is left aside at this stage.
For minimizing the interference between the TD-SCDMA and E-UTRA TDD the UL and
DL alignment of TD-SCDMA and E-UTRA TDD with 5 ms periodicity shall be
assumed. The operating band outlined in Table 5.3-1 shall be considered for
the MSR combination of TD-SCDMA and E-UTRA TDD.
### 5.3.2 F~offset,\ RAT~ of band category 3
BC3 requirements for receiver and transmitter shall apply with a frequency
offset from the lowest and highest carriers to the RF bandwidth edge
(F~offset,\ RAT~) as defined in Table 5.3.2-1.

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of transmit diversity, DB-DC-
HSDPA or MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter
antenna connector.
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified at the
BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for
the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus
such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test port B).
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 6 applies at all times,
i.e. during the Transmitter ON period, the Transmitter OFF period and the
Transmitter transient period.
Figure 6.1-1: Transmitter test ports
Values for **F~offset,\ RAT~** to meet transmitter requirements are specific
for each RAT in each Band Category as specified in subclause 5.2.1 for Band
Category 1, subclause 5.2.2 for Band Category 2 and subclause 5.3.2 for Band
Category 3.
## 6.2 Base Station output power
With multiple carriers of the same or of different types the power definition
of the BS is slightly more complicated than for a single carrier BS. The
declared output power for the BS is defined by:
\- **Rated carrier power:** The maximum output power that can be configured
for a single carrier.
\- **Rated RAT power:** The maximum sum of the output powers of all carriers
belonging to the same RAT that can be configured.
\- **Rated total output power:** The maximum sum of the output power of all
transmitted carriers that can be configured.
The measured carrier power is defined in the frequency domain by using a
square filter. For E-UTRA the channel bandwidth is specified in [4], for UTRA
FDD the bandwidth shall be 5 MHz , for 1.28Mcps UTRA TDD (TD-SCDMA) the
bandwidth shall be 1.6 MHz, and for GSM the bandwidth shall be 300kHz. For the
time domain the different technologies have employed different averaging
times. E-UTRA and UTRA can in principle be averaged over any time interval
during the transmitter ON period as long as it is longer than a minimum
length. For GSM however the averaging period is synchronised to the burst. For
this reason the time period used for averaging should depend on the RAT and
use the RAT specific averaging time.
The parameters for manufacturer output power declaration are given in Table
6.2-1.
The valorization of those parameters identifies a multi-dimensional space of
possible carrier power combinations according to the rated power, number of
supported carriers and rated carrier power for each RAT. It is up to the
manufacturer to fill in values, making the valorization of the parameters.
To limit the number of possible carrier power combinations inside the above
multi-dimensional space, a parameter defining the maximum supported carrier
power difference is declared by the manufacturer.
Table: 6.2-1: Parameters for manufacturer output power declaration
Parameter Unit
* * *
Rated total output power dBm  
Maximum supported carrier power difference dB  
E-UTRA Rated E-UTRA output power dBm Number of supported E‑UTRA carriers N
Rated carrier power (for E‑UTRA) dBm UTRA Rated UTRA power dBm Number of
supported UTRA carriers N Rated carrier power (for UTRA) dBm GSM Rated GSM
power dBm Number of supported GSM carriers N Rated carrier power (for GSM) dBm
There are BS output power-related single-RAT requirements for E-UTRA and UTRA
that will continue to apply as single-RAT requirements:
\- For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for DL RS power in TS 36.104 [4],
subclause 6.5.4.
\- For UTRA FDD, the minimum requirements for primary CPICH power in TS 25.104
[2], subclause 6.4.4,
\- For UTRA TDD, the minimum requirements for Primary CCPCH power and
Differential accuracy of primary CCPCH power in TS 25.105 [3], subclause 6.4.5
and 6.4.6 respectively.
\- For E-UTRA in Band 34, there is a regional limit on the rated output power
declared by the manufacturer. There is no test corresponding to this
requirement.
## 6.3 Output power dynamics
Transmit dynamic range performance for UTRA [2] is covered by power control
step accuracy requirements, code domain dynamic range requirement dynamic
range and total power dynamic range. In GSM [5], there are requirements for
static power setting, power control dynamic range requirements and output
level dynamic operation. E-UTRA [2] has Resource Element (RE) power control
dynamic range requirement and also total power dynamic range where the
frequency domain scheduling capability of E-UTRA is captured.
There is no synergy between the different output power dynamic requirements
for corresponding RAT. This makes transmit power dynamic range requirement
suitable as an MSR single RAT requirement. The existing requirements for each
RAT, without any changes, are thus applicable as MSR single RAT requirement.
## 6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
### 6.4.1 Transmitter OFF power
The transmitter OFF power of UTRA TDD is RRC filtered mean power. It is
0.246dB lower than the mean power. After converting to mean power spectral
density, the transmit OFF power of 1.28Mcps UTRA TDD is -82dBm \+ 0.246dB --
10log(1.28) = -82.826dBm/MHz. The transmitter OFF power of LTE TDD is less
than -85dBm/MHz. Combining the requirements of UTRA and LTE, the stricter
requirement is adopted for MSR transmit OFF power.
The transmitter OFF power spectral density shall be less than -85dBm/MHz.
### 6.4.2 Transmitter transient period
The OFF power for LTE is averaged over 70 us. The ON power is averaged over 1
ms. However the transmitted signal quality requirements apply during the ON
period which prevents too much variation in the on power. The transient time
is 17 us for the OFF to ON transition and 17us for the ON to OFF transition.
For UTRA TDD 1.28 Mcps option the OFF power is averaged over one timeslot
excluding guard periods which is approximately 675 us. The OFF to ON
transition is 8 chips which becomes 6.25 us. The ON to OFF transition period
is 85 + 3 chips where the last 3 chips allow for a transition from -42 dBm to
the OFF power level. The total duration of this period is approximately 68 us.
Short transition times results in larger possible cell radius and to avoid
replanning of networks the most stringent requirements from LTE and UTRA TDD
1.28 Mcps option is adopted.
The OFF power is averaged over 70 us. The duration of the OFF to ON transition
is 6.25 us and the ON to OFF duration is 17 us. A schematic overview of the
transition periods is given in figure 6.4.1-1
Figure 6.4.1-1 Illustration of the relations of transmitter ON period,
transmitter OFF period and transmitter transient period.
## 6.5 Transmitted signal quality
### 6.5.1 Modulation quality
The transmit modulation quality in UTRA is formulated as EVM, PCDE and RCDE
(only 64QAM). GSM and E-UTRA have EVM as the measure for signal quality for
all supported modulation schemes, except for GMSK in GSM where a phase error
requirement is used. Definition and modulation quality limits for each
concerned RAT are based on extensive investigations and discussions with
considerations for system performance.
The existing RAT specific modulation quality requirements can thus be adopted
for MSR, both in terms of definition and requirements limits, while
maintaining the present performance. In cases where additional modulation
quality requirements are presently defined for a modulation scheme, the need
for these is for further study.
### 6.5.2 Frequency error
Frequency error is a measure of the difference between the actual BS transmit
frequency and the assigned frequency for any concerned RAT. The same source
shall be used for RF frequency and data clock generation.
Due to the very large similarity between E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM frequency error
requirements, a common generic requirement can be adopted for MSR BS.
#### 6.5.2.1 Minimum requirement
The modulated carrier frequency of any RAT supported by the BS shall be
accurate to within ±0.05 ppm observed over a period of one sub-frame for
E-UTRA, one time slot for UTRA and across the burst for GSM.
The requirement shall apply for both single RAT and multi-RAT operation.
## 6.6 Unwanted emissions
Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious emissions
[6]. Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in
the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics
emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency
conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
Spurious emissions limits for MSR BS are treated in subclause 6.6.2. Out-of-
band emissions requirement for an MSR BS transmitter is specified in terms of
an Operating band unwanted emissions requirement (6.6.1), occupied bandwidth
(6.6.3) and ACLR (6.6.4).
### 6.6.1 Operating band unwanted emissions
#### 6.6.1.1 Existing regulatory requirements
Generic "masks" as regulatory requirements exist both in the US (FCC) and in
Europe (WAPECS) as block edge mask requirements. The concept with limits
related to the RF bandwidth edge that is introduced for the MSR scenarios in
subclause 5.1.2 will be compatible with such Block edge masks (BEM), since it
applies a frequency block (the RF bandwidth) as a reference for limits, rather
then single carriers.
##### 6.6.1.1.1 FCC requirements
The US (FCC) requirements for the relevant BC1 and BC2 bands are in Part 22,
24 and 27 of FCC Title 47 [11]. The requirements in [11] are for UTRA and
E-UTRA interpreted as a ‑13 dBm limit, measured in a 100 kHz measurement
bandwidth for the bands below 1GHz (band 5) and in 1 MHz for the bands above 1
GHz (bands 2, 4 and 10). For the 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the
license block, the measurement bandwidth can alternatively be taken as 1% of
the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter (the
"-26 dB modulation bandwidth").
A generic limit based on FCC Title 47 [7], applying to UTRA as well as all
channel bandwidths of E-UTRA, would have to be based on of the highest channel
bandwidth of the deployment case at hand. Basing it in a worst case manner on
the 20MHz channel bandwidth would be unnecessarily restrictive for all
bandwidths below 20 MHz. The FCC Title 47 requirements will be referenced in
the MSR specification as regional "additional requirements", as explained in
subclause 6.6.1.7.
##### 6.6.1.1.2 WAPECS requirements for Europe
There are BEM limits defined in the EC "WAPECS" decision [13] for Band 7\.
These limits are expressed as EIRP, but are based on the shape of the UTRA
spectrum mask taken from TS 25.104 [2]. It is expected that similar limits may
be defined for other European bands. In studies performed by ETSI, it was
concluded that such BEM limits are licensing conditions that are difficult to
include in technical specifications or in hanneliza standards [14].
The WAPECS requirements are therefore not explicitly included in the MSR
specifications, but the UEM limits can be chosen with the WAPECS requirements
in mind.
For Band 20, there are also special out-of-band emissions requirements for
UTRA FDD and E-UTRA that apply in Europe for the protection of Digital
Terrestrial television (DTT). These should be included as additional operating
band unwanted emission limits in the same way as in the single-RAT
specifications TS 25.104 [2] and TS 36.104 [4].
##### 6.6.1.1.3 Co-existence with services in adjacent frequency bands
For UTRA FDD, there is a requirement in Clause 6.6.3.6 of TS 25.104 [3] that
applies regionally for "Co-existence with services in adjacent frequency
bands" in UTRA Bands I, II, III and VII. The requirement provides stricter
limits than the UTRA spectrum mask in the frequency range from 5 to 10 MHz
from the operating band edges. The requirement is based on an ECC study [30]
for co-existence with satellite services in Band 1 and should be restricted to
that band.
The same requirement should apply regionally for MSR Base Stations in Band 1.
The requirement is for UTRA listed as "spurious emissions", but is specified
for the frequency range of 5-10 MHz from the operating band edges. With the
definitions for MSR BS, it consequently falls within the definition of
operating band unwanted emissions and can be introduced in the MSR
specification as a regional "Additional requirement", with limits according to
Table 6.6.1.1.3-1.
Table 6.6.1.1.3-1: Additional requirement for protection of adjacent band
services

⋅ (2180 MHz -- f) dBm 1 MHz
#### 6.6.1.2 Application of necessary bandwidth
The boundary between unwanted emissions in the spurious domain and the out-of-
band domain is normally defined based on the _necessary bandwidth_ of the
emission, where the spurious domain generally consists of frequencies
separated from the centre frequency of the emission by 250% or more of the
necessary bandwidth of the emission.
The necessary bandwidth of a transmission is defined by the ITU-R [6] as "the
width of the frequency band which is just sufficient to ensure the
transmission of information at the rate and with the quality required under
specified conditions. " For UTRA, the necessary bandwidth is set to be 5 MHz
and for E-UTRA it is the same as the Channel Bandwidth. In both cases this is
also identical to the _occupied bandwidth_.
In the present version of the international recommendations on spurious
emissions, ITU-R SM.329-10 [6] and ERC Rec 74-01 [15], there is no definition
of necessary bandwidth related to multi-carrier or multi-RAT transmission for
Base Stations. There is a general statement regarding multi-carrier
transmission in [6], but it does not apply to Base Stations in the mobile
service, making it difficult to set the boundary between the out-of-band and
spurious domains for multi-carrier and MSR Base Stations.
This lack of definition has been identified as a shortcoming within the ECC,
and the Project Team ECC SE21 has worked on defining the necessary bandwidth
and the boundary in case of Multicarrier and multi-RAT transmission as part of
an ECC WG SE Work Item to revise ERC Rec 74-01 [15]. The revision is scheduled
to be completed in September 2010 and may also later be introduced in ITU-R
SM.329 [6].
In an LS from ECC SE21, forwarded to 3GPP through ETSI TFES in [28], the
present draft text concerning Multicarrier BS for the "Working document
towards the revision of ERC REC 74 01" is provided in an Annex. The revised
text provides the following elements of relevance to MSR Base Stations:
\- A new _Note 3_ is added to _recommends 1_ of the draft revision,
identifying with reference to satellite transmitters that the radio regulation
gives some guidance on multicarrier transmitters and that similar guidance for
Multicarrier Base Stations in the Mobile Service is given in Annex 2 of the
recommendation
\- A new third clause is added to Annex 2 of the draft revision, giving
guidance on the necessary bandwidth for Multicarrier Base Stations. The
_transmitter bandwidth_ is used as the necessary bandwidth for determining the
boundary between the out-of-band and spurious domains, where the transmitter
bandwidth is defined as the width of the frequency band covering the envelope
of the transmitted carriers. This definition corresponds to the _RF bandwidth_
of an MSR Base Station.
\- For determining the boundary between the out-of-band and spurious domains,
reference is given to ITU‑R SM.1539 [29], with the addition that when applying
the recommendation for Multicarrier Base Stations operating up to 6 GHz, the
value of the upper threshold value B~U~ in Annex 1 of [29] should be B~U~ = 10
MHz.
The implication of point 2 above is that the necessary bandwidth for an MSR
Base Station will be equal to the RF bandwidth. The necessary bandwidth will
thus not depend on the bandwidth of the individual carriers transmitted or on
the RAT of the carriers, only on the total RF bandwidth.
The implication of point 3 above is that the boundary between the out-of-band
and spurious domain will be at least 10 MHz away from the RF bandwidth edges,
assuming an RF bandwidth of at least 5 MHz.
Based on the draft revision of ERC Rec 74‑01 presented above, the conclusion
is that operating band unwanted emission limits defined in such a way that
they comply with the spurious emission limits in international recommendations
([6] and [15]) for frequencies separated more then 10 MHz from the RF
bandwidth edges, will be in line with those recommendations.
#### 6.6.1.3 RF bandwidth scenarios
From a regulatory point of view, a licensed frequency block can be used for
various technologies with different number of carriers and bandwidths. As
presented in subclause 6.6.1.1, current regulatory requirements in some
regions are based on such a frequency block edge approach. Examples are the
FCC Title 47 requirements in the US [11] and requirements in the "WAPECS"
decision in Europe [13].
Traditionally, 3GPP RF requirements inside the operating band are defined in
relation to a carrier, even though in some cases a simplistic approach is used
for some multi-carrier requirements. Introducing MSR will require
considerations of a group of carriers transmitted within the RF bandwidth as
discussed in subclause 5.1.2 and RF requirements are set relative to the RF
bandwidth edges that are defined relative to the outermost carriers by
F~offset,\ RAT~.
The level of requirements should be chosen carefully to maintain the
performance of the technologies sharing the same frequency spectrum and radio
resources. The possible RF scenarios and the resulting F~offset,\ RAT~ values
are presented in subclause 5.2.
Based on those definitions, a generic _Operating band unwanted emissions_
requirement can be set in relation to the Base Station RF bandwidth as shown
in Figure 6.6.1.3-1. The limit starts from the RF bandwidth edges and is valid
irrespective of how many carriers are deployed in the RF bandwidth and of what
RAT they are (E-UTRA, UTRA or GSM). The principle of defining the requirement
is inherited from E-UTRA, in that it is defined from 10 MHz below the lowest
frequency of the downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest
frequency of the downlink operating band. The level however is derived from
the existing UTRA, E-UTRA and GSM requirements as shown below in subclause
6.6.1.4.
Figure 6.6.1.3-1 Generic UEM mask principle for MSR.
#### 6.6.1.4 Derivation of requirement
##### 6.6.1.4.1 Requirement for band category 1
The generic Operating band unwanted emission limits will be based on the
limits for E-UTRA in TS 36.104 [4] and UTRA in TS 25.104 [2]. When comparing
those limits for a General Purpose/Wide Area BS (output power ≥43 dBm), it
turns out that the UTRA mask is more stringent in all cases except one. This
exception is for the E-UTRA mask for Category B spurious emissions, bands
above 1 GHz and offsets >10 MHz. Here, the E-UTRA mask is based on the
spurious domain limit of -15dBm/MHz, which is stricter than the -13 dBm/MHz of
the UTRA mask. This stricter limit is taken for both Category A and B as well
as for bands above and below 1 GHz in order to make the requirement generic.
Note that f_offset and ∆f are defined for UTRA [2] in relation to the carrier
centre, while the generic requirement developed for MSR defines f_offset and
∆f it in relation to the Base Station RF bandwidth edge, which for UTRA is
identical to the channel edge of the carrier. For this reason, all offsets for
MSR are reduced with 2.5 MHz (half the UTRA channel bandwidth) compared to the
offsets in [2].
The current UTRA emission mask in TS 25.104 [2] is defied as a single carrier
requirement, while the generic MSR mask is a multi-carrier/multi-RAT
requirement. This makes the generic mask for the scenarios above more
stringent than the current requirements for both UTRA and E-UTRA. Since the
mask is in general more stringent than the existing ones, it should not pose
any increase in interference but rather a reduction. This also excludes the
need for additional co-existence studies.
The UMTS mask results in higher ACLR values than the limits specified for both
UTRA and E-UTRA. ACLR requirements will thus be implicitly met by the UEM. If
needed, ACLR limits can be defined as additional regional requirements or
added as an informative Annex.
##### 6.6.1.4.2 Requirement for band category 2
For Band Category 2, there is a range of existing operator scenarios that are
supported by today's GSM specification. These include scenarios where a GSM
carrier needs to be placed as close as 200 kHz from the RF bandwidth edge. In
order to support these scenarios, the following principles are used for
deriving a requirement:
1\. F~offset,\ RAT~ =200 kHz for GSM (see subclause 5.2.2). The number
supports scenarios with two operators deploying GSM with a carrier spacing
(centre-to-centre) of 400 kHz. Based on the existing operator scenarios and
the GSM modulation spectrum, this is the smallest known carrier spacing
possible to deploy.
2\. The baseline level for the UEM in BC2 is the BC1 mask (Table 6.6.1.5-1),
which in turn was based on the UTRA spectrum emission mask (derived for a 43
dBm carrier). Hence the UEM chosen is fundamentally generic for BC1 and BC2
and will be applicable for all multi-RAT combinations that include a UTRA or
E-UTRA signal (with the exception expressed in point 4), or both. The mask is
not applicable for single-RAT GSM transmission.
3\. When a GSM carrier is operated with F~offset,\ GSM~ =200 kHz from the RF
bandwidth edge, a modification will be needed from the UTRA mask level as
shown in Figure 6.6.1.4.2-1. The reason is that the GSM modulation spectrum
will exceed the UTRA mask levels for the first \~150 kHz outside the RF
bandwidth edge. The modified part of the mask will have the shape of the 8PSK
mask (TS45.005 [5] Clause 4.2.1 case a2) for 8PSK and Figure A.2b) in this
frequency range, derived for 43 dBm GSM carrier. Since the UEM is based on a
fixed 43 dBm carrier power, giving a mask that is independent of the carrier
power, the UEM for BC2 in the 0 to 150 kHz frequency range will be more strict
than the existing GSM spectrum mask for GSM carriers with an output power
exceeding 43 dBm.
4\. When an E-UTRA carrier of 1.4 or 3 MHz channel bandwidth is operated
adjacent to the RF bandwidth edge a modified level is also needed for E-UTRA
requirements derived with F~offset,\ E-UTRA~=BW~Channel~/2. The same
modification as derived for GSM will be applied for this scenario.
5\. The requirements for Spectrum due to the modulation and wide band noise
and intra BTS intermodulation of existing GSM multi-carrier BTS will be
applied to MSR Base Station of BC2 for GSM single RAT operation.
Figure 6.6.1.4.2-1: UEM for BC2 in a GSM scenario with F~offset,\ RAT~ =200
kHz, based on the UTRA mask (red) and a modified level based on an 8PSK GSM
mask (blue addition)
#### 6.6.1.5 Minimum requirement (band category 1)
Operating band unwanted emission requirements are defined above the upper and
below the lower RF bandwidth edge located at F~BW\ RF,high\ ,~ respectively
F~BW\ RF,low~ and shall apply within the downlink operating band and in
addition the frequency ranges 10 MHz above and 10 MHz below this band.
Unwanted emissions outside this frequency range shall be limited by spurious
emissions requirements.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single RAT or multi-RAT, single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all
transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.
The requirements shall apply with values for F~offset,\ RAT~ as specified in
Table 5.2.1-1.
Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables below,
where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the _RF bandwidth edge_ frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the _RF bandwidth edge_ frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the downlink
operating band.
\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
Since the limits are to a large part based on regulatory requirements, the
test tolerance shall be zero when deriving the test requirement for Operating
band unwanted emissions.
Table 6.6.1.5-1: Operating band unwanted emission mask (UEM) for BC1
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Frequency | Frequency | Minimum | Measurement | | offset of | offset of | requirement | bandwidth | | measurement | measurement | | (Note 2) | | filter ‑3dB | filter centre | | | | point, ∆f | frequency, | | | | | f_offset | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 0 MHz ≤ ∆f \ -36 dBm / 300 kHz | -36 dBm / 100 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 20 -- 30 MHz | > -36 dBm / 1 MHz | -36 dBm / 100 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | ≥ 30 MHz | > -36 dBm / 3 MHz | -36 dBm / 100 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Frequency offset | TS 45.005 [5] | Limit in | | from transmitter | limit (Table 4-6 and | Recommendation | | operating band edge | subclause 4.3.1 b) | ITU-R SM.329 [1] | +======================+======================+======================+ | 10 -- 20 MHz | > -30 dBm / 300 kHz | -30 dBm / 1 MHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 20 -- 30 MHz | > -30 dBm / 1 MHz | -30 dBm / 1 MHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | ≥ 30 MHz | > -30 dBm / 3 MHz | -30 dBm / 1 MHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
In order to keep the level of the spurious emission requirements for GSM BTS
from TS 45.005 [5] and at the same time align with the recommended limits in
ITU-R SM.329 [1] (Category B), the stricter of the two shall apply for BC2.
The mandatory spurious emissions requirements are therefore taken from Table
6.6.2.1.1-2 as applicable also to Band Category 2, with the requirement in
Table 6.6.2.2.1-3 applying as additional mandatory Category B limits for BC2
when GSM/EDGE is configured. This gives a set of harmonised limits for the
E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM spurious emission requirements, with additional mandatory
limits applying in BC2 for Category B.

30 MHz -- 1 GHz 10 -- 20 MHz -36 dBm 300 kHz 20 -- 30 MHz 1 MHz ≥ 30 MHz 3 MHz
1GHz -- 12.75 GHz ≥ 30 MHz -30 dBm 3 MHz
##### 6.6.2.2.2 Co-existence in the same geographical area
The GSM RF specification [5] has co-existence requirements with other GSM
bands, protecting the downlink (MS receiver). The limit is -57 dBm/100 kHz for
the bands below 1 GHz and -47 dBm/100 kHz for the bands above 1 GHz. These
numbers are identical to the ones used by E-UTRA and UTRA for protection of
GSM as described in subclause 6.6.2.1.2 and applied to MSR Band Category 1.
There are no GSM co-existence requirements for protecting other BS receivers
(other than for co-location as discuss in subclause 6.6.2.2.3)
There is a general requirement in subclause 4.3.2.3 of [5] for co-existence
with 3G, protecting both uplink and downlink (BS and UE receivers) of Bands 1,
7, 33, 34 and 38. The level is -62 dBm/100 kHz, which corresponds to the ‑52
dBm/1 MHz level used also in E-UTRA and UTRA specifications to protect the
E-UTRA/UTRA downlink of other bands. As discussed in subclause 6.6.2.1.2, the
limit is based on a 53 dB MCL (BS-UE) and 3 dB allowed desensitization of the
UE receiver. When applied for protection of the E-UTRA/UTRA uplink as in the
GSM RF specifications [5], the limit is 3 dB stricter than needed to match the
corresponding E-UTRA/UTRA requirements in [2] and [4]. The reason is probably
that no other limit was available at the time when the requirement was set.
The ‑49 dBm/1 MHz level used in the E-UTRA and UTRA specs is judged by TSG RAN
to be sufficient for uplink protection and GSM does not need to provide more
protection.
For an MSR Base Station, the co-existence scenario is independent of whether
it operates in Category 1 bands with E‑UTRA/UTRA or in Category 2 bands with
E‑UTRA/UTRA/GSM. The same limits are therefore applicable for both band
categories. The limits used in the existing specifications are also aligned,
except for the protection of E‑UTRA/UTRA uplink, where the GSM specification
[5] is today slightly over-specified as discussed above.
The parameters for the spurious emissions requirement for co-existence are
therefore taken from Table 6.6.2.1.2-1 as applicable also to Band Category 2,
thereby extending the mutual protection to all E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM bands.
##### 6.6.2.2.3 Co-location
The GSM RF specification [5] has a spurious emissions requirement of -98
dBm/100 kHz for co-location with other GSM Base Stations (subclause 4.3.2.1 of
[5]), based on a 30 dB MCL (BS-BS). There is also an additional requirement of
‑96 dBm/100 kHz for co-location with 3G in subclause 4.3.2.3 of [5], covering
Bands 1, 7, 22, 34 and 38. This limit is taken from the UTRA RF specification
[2].
For an MSR Base Station, the co-location scenario is independent of whether it
operates in Category 1 bands with E‑UTRA/UTRA or in Category 2 bands with
E‑UTRA/UTRA/GSM. The same limits are therefore applicable for both band
categories. The limits used in the existing specifications are also completely
aligned today as shown above.
The parameters for the spurious emissions requirement for co-location are
therefore taken from Table 6.6.2.1.3-1 as applicable also to Band Category 2,
thereby extending the mutual protection to all E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM bands.
##### 6.6.2.2.4 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS
The GSM RF specification [5] has a spurious emission limit for the BTS receive
band in "General requirements" in subclause 4.3.2.1 of TS 45.005 [4]. For a
Normal BTS, that limit is -98 dBm in 100 kHz based on a 30 dB MCL, which is
the same scenario and limit that apply for co-location with BTS in other
bands. While the fundamental scenario for protection of a BS receiver should
be the same as in BC1, the 2 dB difference from the BC1 requirement is not
significant. The BC2 requirement for protection of the BS receiver can thus be
chosen as -98 dBm/100 kHz to align with the co-location requirement for GSM
BTS in BC2
The limits are shown below in Table 6.6.2.2.4‑1, expressed in the same way as
for BC1. As for UTRA and E-UTRA, the limit covers not only protection of own
receiver and co-existence with other BTS/BS, but also co-location with other
BTS/BS in the same operating band.

##### 6.6.2.3.1 Mandatory requirements
The mandatory spurious emissions requirements are taken from subclause
6.6.2.1.1 as applicable also to Band Category 3.
##### 6.6.2.3.2 Co-existence in the same geographical area
The co-existence spurious emissions requirements in the same geographical area
are taken from subclause 6.6.2.1.2 as applicable also to Band Category 3.
NOTE 1: For Base Stations operating in BC3 bands in China, the additional BS
spurious emission limits for protection of DCS1800 in the same geographical
area apply in the frequency range 1805-1850MHz for protection of DCS1800
downlink and in 1710-1755 MHz for protection of DCS1800 uplink.
NOTE 2: For Base Stations operating in BC3 bands in China, the additional
regional co-existence requirements for protection of PHS and Public safety
operation are not applicable.
##### 6.6.2.3.3 Co-location
The co-location spurious emissions requirements are taken from subclause
6.6.2.1.3 as applicable also to Band Category 3.
### 6.6.3 Occupied bandwidth
Both E-UTRA [4] and UTRA [2,3] have requirements for Occupied bandwidth that
is defined strictly in line with ITU-R recommendation ITU-R SM.328 [22]. This
requirement is in reality applied only regionally, while it is listed in the
specifications as a general requirement.
For GSM [5], there is no requirement for Occupied bandwidth.
Since the requirement only applies per carrier, it can be kept as is, with a
common definition and with RAT-specific limits.
#### 6.6.3.1 Definition
The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below the
lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted are each
equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean transmitted power. See
also ITU-R Recommendation SM.328 [22].
The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.
The requirement applies during the transmitter ON period for a single
transmitted carrier.
The minimum requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also be
regional requirements to declare the Occupied bandwidth according to the
definition in the present clause.
#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement
The occupied bandwidth shall be less than values listed in Table 6.6.3.1-1.
Table 6.6.3.1-1: Occupied bandwidth
RAT Occupied bandwidth limit

E-UTRA BW~Channel~ UTRA FDD 5 MHz 1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD TD-SCDMA 1.6 MHz
### 6.6.4 Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR)
Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is defined as the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.
As a requirement in the Out-of-band domain, the UTRA FDD and E-UTRA
specifications define ACLR requirements applicable for both single and
Multicarrier operation:
\- For E-UTRA in TS 36.104 [4], the ACLR is defined for the 1^st^ and 2^nd^
adjacent carrier for each supported channel bandwidth. There are requirements
both for adjacent E-UTRA carriers of the same BW measured with a square
filter, and for adjacent UTRA carriers measured with a 3.84 Mcps RRC filter.
\- For UTRA FDD in TS 25.104 [2], the ACLR is defined for the 1^st^ and 2^nd^
adjacent UTRA carrier, measured with a 3.84 Mcps RRC filter.
ACLR requirements for UTRA and E-UTRA are derived through extensive simulation
work of adjacent channel co-existence scenarios as documented in TR 25.942 [7]
and TR 36.942 [23]. ACLR is often used as a reference parameter in co-
existence studies and could for this reason also be of interest to document
for MSR Base Stations. ACLR does however play a very small role in co-
existence studies with non-3GPP technologies.
While the out-of-band emissions for MSR BS will be covered by the Operating
band unwanted emission limits, there may for the reasons of understanding co-
existence properties with adjacent legacy systems still be an interest to have
ACLR limits in the MSR specifications.
The existing single-RAT ACLR requirements for adjacent 5 MHz UTRA systems can
thus be adopted for MSR BS and be applied to E-UTRA, UTRA FDD and UTRA TDD.
There will be no generic MSR multi-RAT requirement for ACLR.
## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
For transmit intermodulation requirements, UTRA and E-UTRA apply interferers
with the same bandwidth, level and frequency offset. The difference is the
interferer modulation where UTRA is based on a WCDMA modulated signal while
the E-UTRA interferer is OFDM modulated. The GSM requirement is also similar
in terms of interferer level but it is based on a CW interferer at offsets
larger than 800 kHz.
The MSR transmit intermodulation requirement should use both modulated wide-
band interferers and CW interferer at lower offsets and maintain the already
harmonized interferer level of 30 dB below the wanted signal. Through this
approach, added value for all concerned technologies is obtained, since both
CW and wide-band modulated interferers are covered.
The GSM Intra BTS intermodulation requirement (Clause 4.7.2 in [5]) is kept as
MSR single RAT requirement for GSM in order to ensure the integrity of the
system.
### 6.7.1 Minimum requirement
The transmit intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of the
transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements
caused by presence of the own transmit signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter via the antenna.
The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when an interfering signal with a level of 30 dB below wanted signal
is injected into the antenna connector. The type and offset of the interfering
signal from the edge of RF bandwidth shall be as in Table 6.7.1-1 for BC1 and
BC2, and in addition as in Table 6.7.1-2 for BC2 and in Table 6.7.1-3 for BC3.
For Band Category 1, the requirement is applicable for a wanted signal being
UTRA or E-UTRA of maximum channel bandwidth, with interfering signals
according to Table 6.7.1-1.
For Band Category 2, the requirement is applicable for a wanted signal being
GSM, UTRA or E-UTRA of maximum channel bandwidth, with interfering signals
according to Table 6.7.1-1 and Table 6.7.1-2.
For Band Category 3, the requirement is applicable for a wanted signal being
UTRA or E-UTRA of maximum channel bandwidth, with interfering signals
according to Table 6.7.1-3.

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission
limits in subclause 6.6 in the presence of a wanted signal and an interfering
signal according to Table 6.7.1‑1 for BC1 and BC2, and in addition Table
6.7.1-2 for BC2 and Table 6.7.1-3 for BC3.
# 7 Receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
The requirements in clause 7 are expressed for a single receiver antenna
connector. For receivers with antenna diversity, the requirements apply for
each receiver antenna connector.
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at the BS
antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus such
as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test port B).
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the Base
Station receive period.
Figure 7.1: Receiver test ports
E-UTRA throughput requirements defined for the receiver characteristics in
this clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
Values for **F~offset,\ RAT~** to meet receiver requirements are specific for
each RAT in each Band Category as specified in subclause 5.2.1 for Band
Category 1, subclause 5.2.2 for Band Category 2 and subclause 5.3.2 for Band
Category 3.
## 7.2 Reference sensitivity level
The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power
received at the antenna connector at which a reference performance requirement
shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel.
\- In E-UTRA, the reference performance is a throughput limit in static
conditions and the reference measurement channel is a Fixed Reference Channel
(FRC) with QPSK modulation that varies depending on the channel bandwidth
(clause 7.2 of [4]). Other channels, modulation schemes and propagation
conditions are covered by the performance requirements, which are not within
the scope of MSR. A noise figure of 5 dB is assumed.
\- In UTRA, the reference performance is a BER limit in static conditions and
the reference measurement channel is a 12.2 kbps channel with QPSK modulation
(clause 7.2 of [2]). Other channels, modulation schemes and propagation
conditions are covered by the performance requirements, which are not within
the scope of MSR. A noise figure of 5 dB is assumed.
\- In GSM, the reference performance is a set of FER, BER and BLER limits in
static and fading conditions, and the reference measurement channel is a set
of control and traffic channels, including both speech and data. These are in
general defined at a fixed _P~REFSENS~_ level, while there are also for some
modulation schemes additional sets of _P~REFSENS~_ levels at which fixed FER,
BER and BLER limits for those modulation schemes are to be met (Clause 6.2 of
[5]). A noise figure of 8 dB is assumed.
Since the definition of reference sensitivity requirements are RAT specific,
the existing requirements are applied only as MSR single RAT requirements for
each RAT, in BC1, BC2 and BC3. No corresponding multi-RAT requirement is
defined.
The reference sensitivity level P~REFSENS~ is however also used as a reference
level for a number of other receiver requirements, both for single-RAT
requirements in existing specifications and for MSR multi-RAT requirements.
They will therefore need to be included by reference also in the MSR
specification, in order to clearly define what limits are referred to in other
receiver requirements.
### 7.2.1 Minimum requirement
For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for reference sensitivity is specified in
TS 36.104 [4], section 7.2.
For UTRA FDD, the minimum requirement for reference sensitivity is specified
in TS 25.104 [2], section 7.2.
For UTRA TDD, the minimum requirement for reference sensitivity is specified
in TS 25.105 [3], section 7.2.
For GSM/EDGE, the minimum requirement for reference sensitivity is specified
in TS 45.005 [5], applicable parts of subclause 6.2.
The conditions specified in TS 45.005 [5], Annex P.1 apply for GSM/EDGE
reference sensitivity.
## 7.3 Dynamic range
For both UTRA and E-UTRA, the dynamic range is specified as a measure of the
capability of the receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an
interfering signal inside the received channel bandwidth. In this condition a
Bit Error Rate (BER) or throughput requirement shall be met for a specified
reference measurement channel. The intention of this requirement is to ensure
that the Base Station can receive high throughput also in the presence of
increased interference and higher wanted signal levels.
The receiver dynamic range for the GSM Base Station is mainly defined by the
Nominal Error Rate (NER) requirement, which defines BER limits at considerably
higher received signal levels than the reference sensitivity level.
The rationale for and definition of those dynamic range requirements are very
RAT specific are therefore not modified for BC1, BC2 and BC3 in the context of
the MSR.
### 7.3.1 Minimum requirement
For GSM, the minimum requirement is specified in TS 45.005, section 6.1.
For UTRA FDD, the minimum requirement is specified in TS 25.104, section
7.3.1.
For UTRA TDD, the minimum requirement is specified in TS 25.105, section
7.3.1.
For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement is specified in TS 36.104, section 7.3.1.
## 7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking
### 7.4.1 Band category 1
#### 7.4.1.1 Blocking
The UTRA blocking requirement is based on a UTRA interfering signal with mean
power of -40dBm and 7.5MHz minimum offset from the channel edge of the wanted
signal.
The E-UTRA blocking requirement is based on a E-UTRA interfering signal with
mean power of -43dBm. The minimum offset from the channel edge of the wanted
signal is dependent on the E-UTRA channel bandwidth and is equal to 1.5 E-UTRA
channel bandwidth.
Combining the requirements for UTRA and E-UTRA scenarios, a generic MSR
blocking requirement based on a UTRA interfering signal with mean power of -40
dBm and 7.5MHz minimum offset from the RF bandwidth edge is adopted.
##### 7.4.1.1.1 Minimum requirement
The blocking characteristics are a measure of the receiver ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted
interferer. The interfering signal shall be an UTRA signal as specified in
Annex A.
For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the Base Station antenna
input, using the parameters in Table 7.4.1.1.1-1, the following requirements
shall be met:
\- For any UTRA carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

NOTE*: P~REFSENS~ depends on the RAT and on the channel bandwidth, see section
7.2.
* * *
#### 7.4.1.2 Narrowband blocking
The UTRA narrowband blocking requirement is based on a GSM interfering signal
with mean power of -47dBm and 200 kHz or 300 kHz minimum offset from the
channel edge of the wanted signal.
The E-UTRA narrowband blocking requirement is based on a E-UTRA 1RB
interfering signal with mean power of ‑49dBm. The offset from the channel edge
of the wanted signal is dependent on the E-UTRA channel bandwidth and is
repeated in multiple RB positions over the assumed interfering E-UTRA signal.
A generic MSR narrowband blocking requirement based on a E-UTRA 1RB
interfering signal with mean power of ‑49dBm is appropriate. The interfering
signal offsets may be dependent on the victim E-UTRA channel bandwidth. The
240 kHz offset correspond to the first RB (closest to the RF bandwidth edge)
of an E-UTRA interfering signal, where the E-UTRA signals channel bandwidth is
selected so that the interfering signal is as close as possible to the victim,
i.e. a E-UTRA signal with 3 MHz channel BW. The principle of repeating the
single RB signal in multiple RB positions over the assumed interfering E-UTRA
signal is copied from E-UTRA specification.
##### 7.4.1.2.1 Minimum requirement
The narrowband blocking characteristics are a measure of the receiver ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an
unwanted interferer. The interfering signal shall be an E-UTRA 1RB signal as
specified in Annex A.
For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the Base Station antenna
input, using the parameters in Table 7.4.1.2.1‑1, the following requirements
shall be met:
\- For any UTRA carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

### 7.4.2 Band category 2
#### 7.4.2.1 Blocking requirement
The MSR blocking requirements for band category 1 should also apply for band
category 2 with a GSM wanted signal power of PREFSENS +[3]dB as for other GSM
requirements. This gives added value to GSM systems since a blocking
requirement with wideband modulated interferer based on the scenario
investigated for UTRA is currently not covered in the existing GSM
specifications.
A generic MSR blocking requirement based on the UTRA interfering signal with
mean power of -40 dBm and 7.5MHz minimum offset from the RF bandwidth edge is
adopted based on the BC1 requirement.
##### 7.4.2.1.1 Minimum requirement
The blocking characteristics are a measure of the receiver ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted
interferer. The interfering signal shall be a UTRA signal as specified in
Annex A.
For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the Base Station antenna
input, using the parameters in Table 7.4.2.1.1‑1, the following requirements
shall be met:
\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005 [5],
Annex P.2.1.
\- For any UTRA carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

#### 7.4.2.2 Narrowband blocking
The MSR narrowband blocking requirements for band category 1 should also apply
for band category 2 with a GSM wanted signal power of PREFSENS +[3]dB as for
other GSM requirements. A narrowband blocking requirement with narrowband
modulated interferer based on the scenario investigated for E-UTRA is
currently not covered in the existing GSM specifications. However it should be
noted that in TS45.005, the capability of the receiver to receive a wanted
modulated signal without exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of
an unwanted modulated signal at an adjacent carrier frequency is defined in
section 6.3 (reference interference level).
The more strict MC-BTS GSM narrowband blocking requirements levels based on CW
interferer are covered as MSR single RAT requirement for GSM and also apply
for GSM carriers in multi-RAT operation.
A generic MSR narrowband blocking requirement based on an E-UTRA 1RB
interfering signal with mean power of ‑49dBm and an interfering signal offset
of 240 kHz is adopted, based on the BC1 requirement.
##### 7.4.2.2.1 Minimum requirement
The narrowband blocking characteristics are a measure of the receiver ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an
unwanted interferer. The interfering signal shall be an E-UTRA 1RB signal as
specified in Annex A.
For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the Base Station antenna
input, using the parameters in Table 7.4.2.2.1‑1, the following requirements
shall be met:
\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005 [5],
Annex P.2.1.
\- For any UTRA carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

In addition, the GSM MC-BTS blocking requirement as stated in TS 45.005 [5]
applies both for GSM single RAT operation as well as for any GSM carrier in
multi-RAT operation.
### 7.4.3 band category 3
#### 7.4.3.1 Blocking
The UTRA TDD blocking requirement is based on a UTRA TDD interfering signal
with mean power of -40dBm and 2.4 MHz minimum offset from the channel edge of
the wanted signal.
The E-UTRA blocking requirement is based on an E-UTRA interfering signal with
mean power of -43dBm. The minimum offset from the channel edge of the wanted
signal is dependent on the E-UTRA channel bandwidth and is equal to 1.5•E-UTRA
channel bandwidth.
The UTRA TDD and E-UTRA scenarios can be covered by a combination of two
hannelizat. First, the same generic MSR blocking requirement as in BC1 and
BC2, based on an UTRA interfering signal with mean power of -40 dBm and 7.5MHz
minimum offset from the RF bandwidth edge is adopted. As an additional
requirement in BC3, an MSR blocking requirement based on a 1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD
interfering signal with mean power of -40 dBm and 2.4MHz minimum offset from
the RF bandwidth edge is adopted.
#### 7.4.3.1.1 Minimum requirement
The blocking characteristics are a measure of the receiver ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted
interferer.
The interfering signal shall be a UTRA signal as specified in Annex A.
For a wanted signal and an interfering UTRA signal as specified in Annex A
coupled to the Base Station antenna input, using the parameters in Table
7.4.3.1.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA TDD carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

* * *
#### 7.4.3.2 Narrowband blocking
The E-UTRA narrowband blocking requirement is based on an E-UTRA 1RB
interfering signal with mean power of ‑49 dBm. The offset from the channel
edge of the wanted signal is dependent on the E-UTRA channel bandwidth and is
repeated in multiple RB positions over the assumed interfering E-UTRA signal.
There is no narrowband blocking requirement for UTRA.
A generic MSR narrowband blocking requirement based on an E-UTRA 1RB
interfering signal with mean power of ‑49 dBm is adopted. The interfering
signal offsets may be dependent on the victim E-UTRA channel bandwidth. The
240 kHz offset correspond to the first RB (closest to the RF bandwidth edge)
of an E-UTRA interfering signal, where the E-UTRA signals channel bandwidth is
selected so that the interfering signal is as close as possible to the victim,
i.e. a E-UTRA signal with 3 MHz channel BW. The principle of repeating the
single RB signal in multiple RB positions over an assumed interfering 5 MHz
E-UTRA signal is copied from E-UTRA specification.
##### 7.4.3.2.1 Minimum requirement
The narrowband blocking characteristics are a measure of the receiver ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an
unwanted interferer. The interfering signal shall be an E-UTRA 1RB signal as
specified in Annex A.
For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the Base Station antenna
input, using the parameters in Table 7.4.3.2.1‑1, the following requirements
shall be met:
\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA TDD carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

## 7.5 Out-of-band blocking
### 7.5.1 Band category 1
#### 7.5.1.1 General "out-of-band" blocking
UTRA and E-UTRA requirements are based on a CW interferer at -15 dBm and
excludes the frequency range from 20 MHz below the lowest frequency of the
uplink operating band up to 20 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink
operating band.
The following "out-of-band" blocking requirement applies to Band Category 1.
For the parameters specified in Table 7.5.1.1-1, the following requirements
shall be met:
\- For any UTRA carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001
\- For any E-UTRA carriers, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the E-UTRA reference measurement channel.
Table 7.5.1.1-1: Blocking performance requirement

#### 7.5.1.2 Co-location
The current blocking requirements for co-location in E-UTRA [4] and UTRA [2]
are based on a +16 dBm interference level and are thus already harmonized.
This level is derived from a 30 dB minimum coupling loss between co-located
Base Stations. The MSR specification can adopt these current requirements for
Band Category 1. The most up-to-date requirements are in Table 7.6.2.1‑1 in
[4], where co-location requirements with all types of BS including E-UTRA/UTRA
TDD are combined into a single table. The parameters are shown in Table
7.5.1.2‑1.
Table 7.5.1.2-1: Blocking performance requirement for BS when co-located with
BS in other frequency bands
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Parameter | Value | +==================================+==================================+ | Co-located BS type | BS operating in | | | | | | - Any E-UTRA band (paired and | | | unpaired) | | | | | | - Any UTRA band (paired and | | | unpaired) | | | | | | - Any GSM band (including | | | R-GSM) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Centre Frequency of Interfering | Downlink operating band of | | Signal | co-located BS type | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering Signal mean power | +16 dBm | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Wanted Signal mean power | P~REFSENS~ +6dB* | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Type of Interfering Signal | CW | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | NOTE*: P~REFSENS~ depends on | | | the RAT and the channel | | | bandwidth, see subclause 7.2. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
There are also exceptions handled through two notes to table 7.6.2.1-1 in [4],
which will be needed also for MSR Base Stations. The first note excludes the
frequencies up to 10 MHz immediately outside the Uplink operating band from
the requirement. The exception is Band 13 where 9 MHz are excluded below the
band, since co-location with Band 14 Base Stations are anticipated.
The second note further clarifies the situation for cases where a paired
uplink is directly adjacent to an unpaired band and proposes site-engineering
solutions for those cases. The note for E-UTRA FDD in [4] states that "Some
combinations of bands may not be possible to co-site based on the requirements
above. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location of UTRA TDD or E-UTRA TDD with E-UTRA FDD on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain
site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in
TR 25.942". The corresponding text for UTRA is included in subclause 7.5.3 of
[2].
### 7.5.2 Band category 2
#### 7.5.2.1 General "out-of-band" blocking
The out-of-band blocking requirement for GSM is derived for TS 45.005 [5]
based on a scenario with co-located BTS at 30 dB coupling loss [16]. Since co-
location is covered by the specific requirement in subclause 7.5.2.2, which is
also stricter than the general GSM requirement, it is not an applicable
scenario for the general out-of-band blocking requirement.
The UTRA and E-UTRA general out-of-band blocking requirements are based on a
CW interferer at -15 dBm for the frequency ranges where co-location does not
apply and is applied for MSR BC1 as shown in subclause 7.5.1.1. With the
stricter co-location requirements defined separately for GSM, the same general
-15 dBm limit can also be applied for MSR BC2.
The parameters for the general blocking requirement are therefore taken from
Table 7.5.1.1.‑1 as applicable also to Band Category 2, thereby harmonising
the E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM blocking requirements.
#### 7.5.2.2 Co-location
The GSM RF specification [5] does not have a specific blocking requirement for
co-location with other Base Stations. Co-location has however been used as one
scenario for the general out-of-band blocking requirement.
For an MSR Base Station, the blocking scenario for co-location is independent
of whether it operates in Category 1 bands with E‑UTRA/UTRA or in Category 2
bands with E‑UTRA/UTRA/GSM. The same blocking requirement level of +16 dBm is
therefore applicable for both band categories. It should be noted that this
level is stricter than the general out-of-band blocking requirements in [5].
The parameters for the blocking requirement for co-location are therefore
taken from Table 7.5.1.2.‑1 as applicable also to Band Category 2, thereby
adding a mutual blocking protection covering all E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM bands.
### 7.5.3 Band category 3
#### 7.5.3.1 General "out-of-band" blocking
The general out-band blocking requirements for both E-UTRA TDD and UTRA TDD
1.28Mcps are based on a CW interferer at -15 dBm and exclude the frequency
range from 20 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink operating band up
to 20 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink operating band.
The following "out-of-band" blocking requirement applies to Band Category 3.
For the parameters specified in Table 7.5.3.1-1, the following requirements
shall be met:
\- For any UTRA carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001
\- For any E-UTRA carriers, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the E-UTRA reference measurement channel.
Table 7.5.3.1-1: Blocking performance requirement
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Parameter | Value | +==================================+==================================+ | Centre Frequency of Interfering | 1 MHz to (F~UL_low~ -20) MHz | | Signal | | | | (F~UL_high~ +20) MHz to 12 750 | | | MHz | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering Signal mean power | -15 dBm | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Wanted Signal mean power | P~REFSENS~ +6dB* | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Type of Interfering Signal | CW | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | NOTE*: P~REFSENS~ depends on | | | the RAT and the channel | | | bandwidth, see subclause 7.2. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
#### 7.5.3.2 Co-location
When E-UTRA TDD and UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps Base Stations are collocated with
GSM/DCS, UTRA or E-UTRA BS operating in a different frequency band, the
current blocking requirements for E-UTRA and UTRA LCR TDD BS are harmonized
with +16 dBm interference signal level. Thus the blocking requirement in Table
7.5.3.2-1 is applied when the MSR band category 3 BS is collocated with
GSM/DCS, UTRA or E-UTRA BS. The interference level is derived from a 30 dB
minimum coupling loss between co-located Base Stations.
Table 7.5.3.2-1: Blocking performance requirement for band category 3 BS when
co-located with GSM/DCS, UTRA or E-UTRA BS in other frequency bands
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Parameter | Value | +==================================+==================================+ | Co-located BS type | BS operating in | | | | | | - Any E-UTRA band (paired and | | | unpaired) | | | | | | - Any UTRA band (paired and | | | unpaired) | | | | | | - GSM850/900,DCS1800** | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Centre Frequency of Interfering | Downlink operating band of | | Signal | co-located BS type | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering Signal mean power | +16 dBm | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Wanted Signal mean power | P~REFSENS~ +6dB* | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Type of Interfering Signal | CW | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | NOTE*: P~REFSENS~ depends on | | | the RAT and the channel | | | bandwidth, see subclause 7.2. | | | | | | NOTE**: In China, the | | | co-location blocking requirement | | | is only applicable to the BC3 BS | | | co-located with BTS operating in | | | DCS1800 (1805-1850MHz). | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
There are the exceptions handled through two notes to table 7.6.2.1-1 in [4],
which is needed also for MSR Base Stations and the solution to the exceptions
in 7.5.1.2 for BC1 is applicable to BC3.
## 7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
The requirement specified for E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM receiver spurious emissions
is based on the spurious emission requirements for "Receivers and idle/standby
transmitters" defined in [15].
### 7.6.1 Band category 1
The requirements for E-UTRA and UTRA consist of three parts:
\- A general spurious emissions requirements, based on [15].
\- Additional requirements for protection of BS receivers for FDD uplink and
TDD bands. These limits were listed separately for UTRA in [2], but are
instead included by reference for E-UTRA in [4].
\- Co-existence requirements that may apply for co-located Base Stations are
incorporated by reference.
The general spurious emission requirements apply for UTRA in the same way as
for E-UTRA. The frequency range in the out-of-band domain is excluded, i.e.
out to the outermost carrier centers plus 250% of the necessary bandwidth (=
Channel bandwidth).
In order to align with the way transmitter unwanted emissions are defined in
Clause 6.6.1 and 6.6.2, the same generic assumption is applied for the Rx
spurious limits. This means that independent of the transmitted RAT(s) and how
many carriers that are transmitted within the BS RF bandwidth, only
frequencies that are more than 10 MHz below the lower RF bandwidth edge and
more than 10 MHz above the upper RF bandwidth edge are covered by the
requirement. The frequency range between those points may be excluded.
The additional requirements for co-existence and co-location are based on the
corresponding Tx spurious limits and can for this reason be expressed as a
direct reference to the additional Tx spurious emission requirements in
subclause 6.6.2. This avoids duplication of limits and reduces the risk for
errors when updating specifications.
#### 7.6.1.1 Minimum requirement (BC1)
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver antenna connector. The
requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX antenna ports. In this
case for FDD BS the test shall be performed when both TX and RX are on, with
the TX port terminated.
For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies during
the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the
transmitter spurious emission limits as specified in subclause 6.6.2 are
valid.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table
7.6.1.1-1:
Table 7.6.1.1-1: General spurious emission minimum requirement
Frequency range Maximum level Measurement Bandwidth Note
* * *
30MHz -- 1 GHz -57 dBm 100 kHz  
1 GHz -- 12.75 GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz  
NOTE: The frequency range from F~BW\ RF,DL,low~ -10 MHz to F~BW\ RF,,Dlhigh~ +
10 MHz may be excluded from the requirement.
In addition to the requirements in Table 7.6.1.1-1, the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the levels specified for Protection of the E-UTRA
FDD BS receiver of own or different BS in subclause 6.6.2.2.4 and for Co-
existence with other systems in the same geographical area in subclause
6.6.2.2.2. In addition, the co-existence requirements for co-located Base
Stations specified in subclause 6.6.2.2.3 may also be applied.
### 7.6.2 Band category 2
For GSM, a requirement for "Spurious emissions from the receiver antenna
connector" is defined in TS 45.005 [5], with the same requirement levels as in
UTRA and E-UTRA, which are taken from [15].
The measurement bandwidth applied is however not the same as the recommended
values in SM.329 [6] and ERC/REC 74-01 [15], since it varies with the offset
from the downlink operating band edge rather than with the frequency, in the
same way as for transmitter spurious emissions (see also subclause 6.6.2.2).
As for transmitter spurious emissions, this results in that some GSM BTS
limits in TS 45.005 [5] are stricter than in [15], while some are more
relaxed.
In order to keep the level of the spurious emission requirements for GSM BTS
from TS 45.005 [5] and at the same time align with the recommended limits in
[15], the stricter of the two shall apply for BC2.
#### 7.6.2.1 Minimum requirement (BC2)
The receiver spurious emission limits for operation in Band Category two are
the same as defined in subclause 7.6.1 and table 7.6.1.1-1, with the
requirement in Table 7.6.2.1-1 applying as additional mandatory limits for
BC2.

### 7.6.3 Band category 3
The requirement specified for UTRA TDD receiver spurious emissions consists of
general and additional requirements in [3]. General receiver spurious emission
requirements are -57dBm/100kHz for 30MHz \~ 1GHz and -47dBm/1MHz for 1GHz \~
12.5GHz. It is aligned with E-UTRA.
For 1.28Mcps UTRA TDD(TD-SCDMA), the spurious emission requirements apply with
the exception of frequencies between 4 MHz below the first carrier frequency
and 4 MHz above the last carrier frequency used by the BS. For MSR, in order
to align with the way transmitter unwanted emissions are defined in Clause
6.6.1 and 6.6.2, only frequencies that are more than 10 MHz below the lower RF
bandwidth edge and more than 10 MHz above the upper RF bandwidth edge are
covered by the requirement. The frequency range between those points may be
excluded.
In UTRA TDD specification, the additional receiver spurious emission
requirements are for protection of TDD bands or FDD bands. These are
-83dBm/1.28MHz for different frequency band. Though the measurement bandwidth
is different, it can be aligned to -94dBm/100kHz, i.e. -83dBm/ 1.28MHz =
-94.07dBm/100kHz.
In E-UTRA, the requirement for co-located Base Stations is -96dBm/100kHz.
Since MSR should satisfy requirements for both E-UTRA and UTRA, a choice of
this more strict limitation as MSR receiver spurious emission requirements can
also meet the additional requirements for co-location and protection of BS
operating in the same operating band for UTRA TDD. It is the same to MSR Tx
spurious limits as for co-location, and can be expressed as a direct reference
to the additional Tx spurious emission requirements in subclause 6.6.2.3.3.
Though in UTRA TDD specification, only one type of additional spurious
emission requirements was defined instead of separated co-existence and co-
location requirements, the Tx spurious emission requirements for co-existence
with other systems in the same geographical area can also be applied for Rx
spurious emissions. MSR Rx spurious limits for co-existence with other systems
in the same geographical area can be expressed as a direct reference to the
additional Tx spurious emission requirements in subclause 6.6.2.3.2.
#### 7.6.3.1 Minimum requirement (BC3)
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver that appears at the BS receiver antenna connector. For
all TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies during
the Transmitter OFF period.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table
7.6.3.1-1:

30MHz -- 1 GHz -57 dBm 100 kHz

NOTE: The frequency range from F~BW\ RF,DL,low~ -10 MHz to F~BW\ RF,,Dlhigh~ +
10 MHz may be excluded from the requirement.
In addition to the requirements in Table 7.6.3.1-1, the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the levels specified for Co-existence with other
systems operating in other bands in the same geographical area in subclause
6.6.2.3.2 and for Co-located Base Stations specified in subclause 6.6.2.3.3.
These additional spurious emission requirements shall be applied to a BS
operating in the same operating band and the frequency range from F~BW\
RF,DL,low~ -10 MHz to F~BW\ RF,,Dlhigh~ + 10 MHz shall be excluded.
## 7.7 Receiver intermodulation
### 7.7.1 Band category 1
#### 7.7.1.1 Intermodulation requirement
The UTRA intermodulation requirement is based on CW and UTRA interfering
signals with mean power of ‑48 dBm and with 7.5MHz and 17.5MHz offsets from
the channel edge of the wanted signal, respectively.
The E-UTRA intermodulation requirement is based on CW and E-UTRA interfering
signals with mean power of ‑52 dBm. The channel bandwidth of the interfering
E-UTRA signal is equal to the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal for
channel bandwidths less than 5 MHz, for wider channel bandwidths of the wanted
signal the interfering signal is a 5 MHz E-UTRA signal. The offset for the CW
signal from the channel edge of the wanted signal is dependent on the E-UTRA
channel bandwidth and is equal to 1.5•E-UTRA channel bandwidth of the
interfering signal. The interfering E-UTRA signal is placed so that the
intermodulation product falls on the effective channel bandwidth of the wanted
signal.
Combining the requirements for UTRA and E-UTRA scenarios, a generic MSR
intermodulation requirement based on the CW and E-UTRA interfering signals
with mean power of ‑48 dBm is adopted. The interfering signal offsets from the
RF bandwidth edge are dependent on the RAT/E-UTRA channel bandwidth and are
defined in such a way that the whole intermodulation product falls inside the
effective channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier.
For channel bandwidths equal to or higher than 5MHz, there is a 17.5MHz fixed
offset for 5MHz E-UTRA interfering signal. The CW offsets varies from 7.125MHz
to 7.5MHz in order to have an intermodulation product at the correct frequency
positions.
##### 7.7.1.1.1 Minimum requirement
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal. Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA signal as
specified in Annex A.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the Base Station antenna input, using the parameters in
Table 7.7.1.1.1-1 and 7.7.1.1.1-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any UTRA carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

#### 7.7.1.2 Narrowband intermodulation
The UTRA narrowband intermodulation requirement is based on CW and GSM
interfering signals with mean power of -47dBm and 1MHz and 3.4MHz offsets from
the channel edge of the wanted signal, respectively. It should be noted the
GSM signal does not exist in Band Category 1.
The E-UTRA narrowband intermodulation requirement is based on CW and E-UTRA
1RB interfering signals with mean power of -52dBm. The offsets from the
channel edge of the wanted signal are dependent on the E-UTRA channel
bandwidth.
A generic MSR narrowband intermodulation requirement based on CW and E-UTRA
1RB interfering signals with mean power of -52dBm is adopted. The interfering
signal offsets from the RF bandwidth edge are dependent on the RAT/E-UTRA
channel bandwidth and are defined in such a way that the whole intermodulation
product falls inside the effective channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier.
The 970kHz offset corresponds to the distance between the RF bandwidth edge
and the fifth closest RB centre frequency of the E-UTRA 1.4MHz interfering
signal. The 960kHz offset corresponds to the distance between the RF bandwidth
edge and the fifth closest RB centre frequency of the E-UTRA 3MHz interfering
signal. The 1060kHz, 1240kHz, 1600kHz and 1780kHz offsets correspond to the
distances between the RF bandwidth edge and the fifth, sixth, eighth and ninth
closest RB centre frequency of the E-UTRA 5MHz interfering signal,
respectively. The CW signal is inside the interfering RB closest to the RF
bandwidth edge and adjusted to centre the intermodulation product on the
outermost RB of the wanted E-UTRA signal. For a UTRA wanted signal the
intermodulation product falls at the edge of the flat part of the wanted
signal spectrum.
##### 7.7.1.2.1 Minimum requirement
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal. Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA 1RB signal as
specified in Annex A.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the Base Station antenna input, using the parameters in
Table 7.7.1.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any UTRA carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

### 7.7.2 Band category 2
#### 7.7.2.1 Intermodulation requirement
Similar MSR RX intermodulation requirements as for Band Category 1 should also
apply for Band Category 2 with a GSM wanted signal level of P~REFSENS~ + 3 dB.
This gives added value to GSM systems since intermodulation requirement for
wideband modulated interferers based on scenarios investigated for E-UTRA are
currently not covered in the existing GSM specifications.
A generic MSR intermodulation requirement based on CW and E-UTRA interfering
signals with mean power of ‑48 dBm is adopted. The interfering signal offsets
from the RF bandwidth edge are dependent on the RAT/E‑UTRA channel bandwidth
and are defined in such a way that the whole intermodulation product falls
inside the effective channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier.
##### 7.7.2.1.1 Minimum requirement
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal. Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA signal as
specified in Annex A.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the Base Station antenna input, using the parameters in
Table 7.7.2.1.1-1 and 7.7.2.1.1-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005 [5],
Annex P.2.2.
\- For any UTRA carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

#### 7.7.2.2 Narrowband intermodulation
Similar MSR narrowband intermodulation requirements as for band category 1
should also apply for band category 2 with a GSM wanted signal power of
PREFSENS +3 dB as for other GSM requirements. This give added value to GSM
systems since narrowband intermodulation requirement with narrowband modulated
interferers based on the scenario investigated for the E-UTRA is currently not
covered in the existing GSM specifications. The more strict GSM MC-BTS
narrowband intermodulation requirements levels based on CW interferer are
covered as MSR single RAT requirement for GSM and also apply for GSM carriers
in multi-RAT operation.
A generic MSR narrowband intermodulation requirement based on CW and E-UTRA
1RB interfering signals with mean power of -52dBm is adopted.. The interfering
signal offsets from the RF bandwidth edge are dependent on the RAT/E-UTRA
channel bandwidth and are defined in such a way that the whole intermodulation
product falls inside the effective channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier.
##### 7.7.2.2.1 Minimum requirement

### 7.7.3 Band category 3
#### 7.7.3.1 Intermodulation requirement
The UTRA TDD intermodulation requirement is based on CW and UTRA interfering
signals with mean power of -48 dBm and with 2.4MHz and 5.6MHz offsets for
1.28Mcps TDD option from the channel edge of the wanted signal, respectively.
The E-UTRA intermodulation requirement is based on CW and E-UTRA interfering
signals with mean power of ‑52 dBm. The channel bandwidth of the interfering
E-UTRA signal is equal to the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal for
channel bandwidths less than 5 MHz, for wider channel bandwidths of the wanted
signal the interfering signal is a 5 MHz E-UTRA signal. The offset for the CW
signal from the channel edge of the wanted signal is dependent on the E-UTRA
channel bandwidth and is equal to 1.5•E-UTRA channel bandwidth of the
interfering signal. The interfering E-UTRA signal is placed so that the
intermodulation product falls on the effective channel bandwidth of the wanted
signal.
Combining the requirements for UTRA and E-UTRA scenarios, a generic MSR
intermodulation requirement based on the CW and E-UTRA (or 1.28Mcps UTRA TDD)
interfering signals with mean power of ‑48dBm is adopted. The interfering
signal offsets from the RF bandwidth edge are dependent on the RAT/E-UTRA
channel bandwidth and are defined in such a way that the whole intermodulation
product falls inside the effective channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier.
For channel bandwidths equal to or higher than 5MHz, there is a 17.5MHz fixed
offset for 5MHz E-UTRA interfering signal. The CW offsets varies from 7.125MHz
to 7.5MHz. For 1.28Mcps UTRA TDD, there is a 5.6MHz offset for 1.6MHz UTRA TDD
interfering signal and CW offset of 2.3MHz, in order to have an
intermodulation product at the correct frequency positions.
##### 7.7.3.1.1 Minimum requirement
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal. Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA (or 1.28Mcps
UTRA TDD) signal as specified in Annex A.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the Base Station antenna input, using the parameters in

throughput of the reference measurement channel.

#### 7.7.3.2 Narrowband intermodulation
The UTRA TDD have not narrowband intermodulation requirement in the UTRA TDD
specification since there is no narrowband interfering inside TDD band. But
for MSR, it is possible that a narrow band E-UTRA signal exist in the adjacent
channel. So, in BC3 MSR NodeB, the UTRA TDD narrowband intermodulation
requirement should be based on the E-UTRA narrowband intermodulation
requirement.
The E-UTRA narrowband intermodulation requirement is based on CW and E-UTRA
1RB interfering signals with mean power of -52dBm. The offsets from the
channel edge of the wanted signal are dependent on the E-UTRA channel
bandwidth.
A generic MSR narrowband intermodulation requirement based on CW and E-UTRA
1RB interfering signals with mean power of -52dBm is adopted. The interfering
signal offsets from the RF bandwidth edge are dependent on the RAT/E-UTRA
channel bandwidth and are defined in such a way that the whole intermodulation
product falls inside the effective channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier.
The 970kHz offset corresponds to the distance between the RF bandwidth edge
and the fifth closest RB centre frequency of the E-UTRA 1.4MHz interfering
signal. The 960kHz offset corresponds to the distance between the RF bandwidth
edge and the fifth closest RB centre frequency of the E-UTRA 3MHz interfering
signal. The 1060kHz, 1240kHz, 1600kHz and 1780kHz offsets correspond to the
distances between the RF bandwidth edge and the fifth, sixth, eighth and ninth
closest RB centre frequency of the E-UTRA 5MHz interfering signal,
respectively. The CW signal is inside the interfering RB closest to the RF
bandwidth edge and adjusted to centre the intermodulation product on the
outermost RB of the wanted E-UTRA signal. For a UTRA wanted signal the
intermodulation product falls at the edge of the flat part of the wanted
signal spectrum.
##### 7.7.3.2.1 Minimum requirement
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal. Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA 1RB signal as
specified in Annex A.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the Base Station antenna input, using the parameters in
Table 7.7.3.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any UTRA carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001.
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel.

## 7.8 In-channel selectivity
The in-channel selectivity is a measure of the receiver ability to receive a
wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the presence of an
interfering signal received at a larger power spectral density. In this
condition a throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be an E-UTRA signal as
specified in TS 36.104 [4], Annex C.
The in-channel selectivity requirement is applicable only in case of E-UTRA
within the context of Multi Standard Radio (MSR).
### 7.8.1 Minimum requirement
For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement is specified in TS 36.104 [4], section
7.4.1.
# 8 Other requirements
## 8.1 EMC
EMC requirements are today covered in the following specifications:
\- UTRA EMC requirements are covered by TS 25.113 [24].
\- E-UTRA EMC requirements are covered by TS 36.113 [25].
\- There is no 3GPP specification for GSM/EDGE EMC requirements. These are
covered by the ETSI standard EN 301 489-8 [26].
The EMC requirements are to a large part universal and based on international
recommendations. It is therefore possible to draft a common EMC specification
for an MSR Base Station that in principle covers both multi-RAT and single-RAT
operation. It can be noted that the European series of EMC-standards is
presently updated with a new version of EN 301 489‑23 [27], which will include
both UTRA and E-UTRA, thereby already covering multiple RATs.
The following parts of an EMC specification are by definition generic to
multiple RATs:
\- General test conditions
\- Exclusion bands
\- General performance assessment
\- Applicability of emissions and immunity
\- Emission requirements
\- Immunity requirements
The following parts of an EMC specification will have to remain RAT specific:
\- Test conditions (test models)
\- Performance assessment in uplink and downlink
\- Performance criteria for BS
The resulting specification TS 37.113 will therefore for most parts be generic
to all RATs (E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE).
## 8.2 Performance requirements
Performance requirements specify the ability of the BS to correctly demodulate
signals in various conditions and configurations. For UTRA and E-UTRA the
requirements specify a minimum throughput, BLER or BER that shall be achieved
at a specific SNR. For GSM/EDGE the requirements specify a maximum FER, BLER
or BER that shall be achieved at specific sensitivity levels I and specific
carrier-to-interference ratios (C/I).
For E-UTRA carriers the minimum requirement is defined in TS 36.104 [4],
section 8.
For UTRA FDD carriers the minimum requirement is defined in TS 25.104 [2],
section 8.
For UTRA TDD carriers the minimum requirement is defined in TS 25.105 [3],
section 8.
For GSM/EDGE, the minimum requirements for reference sensitivity level and
reference interference level are defined in TS 45.005 [5], applicable parts of
subclauses 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6. The conditions specified in TS 45.005
[5], Annex P.1 are valid for GSM sensitivity and interference performance.
In the WI objective in subclause 4.1 it is clearly stated that performance
requirements should not be a part of the MSR specifications. Thus these
requirements apply together with the RF requirements in the MSR specification,
but should not be a part of the MSR specifications.
# 9 Test specification
## 9.1 BS test configurations
The test configurations are described in three steps. First there is a
definition of Capability Sets (CS), which defines the RAT combinations that
can be declared. Then the concept of Test Configurations (TC) is explained and
finally, the full Mapping of RF requirements and Capability Sets to applicable
Test Configurations is presented in two tables.
### 9.1.1 Definition of Capability Sets (CS)
Subclause 4.7 of the test specification TS 37.141 (Manufacturer's declarations
of supported RF configurations) will contain defined Capability Sets (CS), the
support of which is subject to manufacturers declaration.
Table 9.1.1-1 shows the six capability sets CS1 to CS6, based on the possible
RAT combinations that can be declared. The following abbreviations are used
below:
CS Capability Set
MC multi-carrier (in single RAT)
SC single carrier
MR multi-RAT
SR single-RAT
TC Test Configuration,
Table 9.1.1-1. Example capability sets
+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | Cap | **CS1** | **CS2** | **CS3** | **CS4** | **CS5** | **CS6** | | ability | | | | | | | | Set | | | | | | | | su | | | | | | | | pported | | | | | | | | by the | | | | | | | | BS | | | | | | | +=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+ | Su | UTRA | E-UTRA | UTRA,\ | GSM, | GSM, | GSM, | | pported | | | E-UTRA | UTRA | E-UTRA | UTRA, | | RATs | (MC) | (MC) | | | | E-UTRA | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | Su | SR UTRA | SR | MR UTRA | MR GSM | MR GSM | MR GSM | | pported | (SC, | E-UTRA | + | + UTRA | + | + UTRA | | configu | MC) | (SC, | E-UTRA | | E-UTRA | + | | rations | | MC) | | SR GSM | | E-UTRA | | | | | SR UTRA | (MCBTS) | SR GSM | | | | | | (SC, | | (MCBTS) | MR GSM | | | | | MC) | SR UTRA | | + UTRA | | | | | | (SC, | SR | | | | | | SR | MC) | E-UTRA | MR GSM | | | | | E-UTRA | | (SC, | + | | | | | (SC, | | MC) | E-UTRA | | | | | MC) | | | | | | | | | | | MR UTRA | | | | | | | | + | | | | | | | | E-UTRA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | SR GSM | | | | | | | | (MCBTS) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | SR UTRA | | | | | | | | (SC, | | | | | | | | MC) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | SR | | | | | | | | E-UTRA | | | | | | | | (SC, | | | | | | | | MC) | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | App | BC1, | BC1, | BC1, | BC2 | BC2 | BC2 | | licable | BC2 or | BC2 or | BC2 or | | | | | BC | BC3 | BC3 | BC3 | | | | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
Example: A BS is declared to support CS6. This implies that the BS is capable
to support the following configurations (applicable only to BC2):
\- MR GSM + UTRA + E-UTRA
\- MR GSM + UTRA
\- MR GSM + E-UTRA
\- MR UTRA + E-UTRA
\- SR GSM (MCBTS)
\- SR UTRA (SC, MC)
\- SR E-UTRA (SC, MC)
It is assumed that a manufacturer declares support of one and only one
Capability Set. The applicable Test Configurations will then be defined for
each RF requirement and Capability Set. Not every supported configuration
within a CS will need to be tested with a specific TC, but a judicious choice
is made among the supported configurations to ensure good test coverage.
### 9.1.2 Definition of Test Configurations (TC)
Subclause 4.8 in TS 37.141 (MSR test configurations) will contain the
definition of the (generic) Test Configurations (TC) which will be used to
test RF requirements. Each TC will thus correspond to a specific configuration
appearing within the Capability Sets. As an example, TC2 will be an
incarnation of the SR E-UTRA MC configuration.
The idea with the Test Configuration concept is to re-use a few TCs across a
wider range of RF requirements, rather than "custom designing" TCs for each
and every RF requirement. This reduces the number of configurations to
describe and enables a more compact and generic description of the conformance
testing.
### 9.1.3 Mapping from test requirement to test configuration
The present clause defines which requirements that apply and what test
configurations to use for conformance testing. This is specified in the tables
below for single-RAT Multi-carrier in Table 9.1.3-1 and for multi-RAT Base
Stations in Table 9.1.3-2. Requirements apply according to the declared RAT
Capability Set (CS) of the MSR Base Station and the Band Category of the
declared operating band (BC1, BC2 or BC3), as listed in the heading of each
table. Some requirements listed in the tables may not be mandatory or they may
apply only regionally. This is further specified for each requirement in
clause 6 and 7, and in Table 4.5-1.
For a declared RAT Capability Set (CS), only the requirements listed in the
column for that CS apply. Requirements listed under other CS than the declared
CS need not be tested.
The clause references to BS test cases below are based on the clause numbering
in TS 37.104 and may have to be updated for inclusion in TS 37.141.

Once referring to the existing single-RAT specifications in the table above,
existing clauses in the relevant specifications will be used (procedures, test
requirements, etc). However, regarding the interpretation of the RF channels
to be tested, the following definitions will be used:
B: maximum RF bandwidth at the bottom of (supported frequency range in) the
operating band, wanted channel at the bottom of the maximum RF bandwidth
M: maximum RF bandwidth in the middle of (supported frequency range in) the
operating band, wanted channel in the middle of the maximum RF bandwidth
T: maximum RF bandwidth at the top of (supported frequency range in) the
operating band, wanted channel at the top of the maximum RF bandwidth
