# 4 Background
## 4.1 Justification
In 3GPP, many operators and vendors have realized the significant benefit for
increasing the UE transmits power. Now the HPUE for many bands in LTE, e.g.,
Band 38, Band 40, Band 41 and Band 42 have been completed. This results in
significant improvement in UL coverage for these high bands.
Meanwhile, the study of high power UE (HPUE) operation, i.e. power class 2,
for NR Band n41, n77, n78 and n79 have been almost completed, motivated by
significant benefits in cell coverage and cell edge user throughput that are
needed for and can be achieved for NR related networks. Considering E-UTRA and
NR need sharing the transmit power in the EN-DC mode, that means the EN-DC UL
coverage will be less than NR Standalone and LTE only. This WID will focus on
introduce high power UE for EN-DC (1 LTE FDD band + 1 NR TDD band) to the UL
coverage of EN-DC networks.
Many issues related to HPUE are common across different combinations.
Following the similar approach adopted for LTE TDD HPUE in RAN4, this study
item is to study how to introduce power class 2 for EN-DC for 1 LTE FDD band +
1 NR TDD band in Rel-16.
## 4.2 Objective
The objectives of the SI are as follows:
  * Study how to introduce the new power class 2 (1 LTE FDD band + 1 NR TDD band) for EN-DC bands in Rel-16
    * Study and define the power class for EN-DC under different power > combination such as 23dBm LTE FDD+23dBm NR, 23dBm LTE > FDD+26dBm NR in table 4.2-1.

# 5 Power class definition for EN-DC
## 5.1 Power class
For EN-DC with 1 LTE FDD band and 1 NR TDD band, UE maximum output power shall
be measured over all component carriers from different bands. If each band has
separate antenna connectors, maximum output power is measured as the sum of
maximum output power at each UE antenna connector. The period of measurement
shall be at least one sub frame (1ms). For the example band combination
DC_3A_n78A, the maximum output power can be specified as in Table 5.1-1.

## 5.2 Power combination of the power class
As stated in clause 4.2, two power combinations are studied i.e.
Case1: LTE FDD power class 3 (23dBm), NR TDD power class 3 (23dBm) and EN-DC
power class 2 (26dBm)
Case2: LTE FDD power class 3 (23dBm), NR TDD power class 2 (26dBm) and EN-DC
power class 2 (26dBm)
Unless otherwise stated, requirements written in TS 36.101-1 [5] and TS
38.101-1 [3] apply for LTE and NR transmitters respectively.
# 6 Solutions for SAR Compliance
## 6.1 General
To accommodate the SAR limits of the PC2 FDD-TDD High Power UE, a combined UE-
based and network-based solution is considered in the study phase. In the
network-based solution, there will be a threshold based on the duty cycle and
power settings of LTE and NR, the PC2 UE is assumed to be capable of
maintaining the PC2 power if the network setting or scheduling does not exceed
the threshold. In addition to the network based solution, a UE based solution
based on the autonomous UE maximum power back off mechanism, i.e., P-MPR, can
further allow the UE to ensure SAR compliance. For the network-based solution
following different schemes were discussed in the SI.
## 6.2 Case1 of power class 2
### 6.2.1 Scheme 1
The following equation is applied between the LTE UL duty cycle, NR UL duty
cycle and the overall duty threshold.
  * **Duty~LTE~ *( P~LTE~/ P~26~) + Duty~NR~ *(P~NR~/ P~26~) â‰¤ _Duty threshold ..._(1)**
P~LTE~, P~NR~, P~26~ represent the maximum linear power (mW) of LTE, NR, and
EN-DC power class 2 respectively; Duty~LTE~, Duty~NR~ represent the maximum
uplink percentage of LTE, NR respectively. Duty threshold represents the
maximum UL duty cycle that can maintain the PC2 power class for FDD+TDD EN-DC
HPUE.
In the case 1 of power class 2 FDD-TDD EN-DC UE, the maximum uplink power of
LTE and NR are both 23dBm.By setting the P~LTE~, P~NR~ to be 23dBm, equation
(1) can be simplified to the following equation.
  * **0.5*Duty~LTE~ + 0.5*Duty~NR~ â‰¤ _Duty threshold ..._(2)**
Duty~NR~, the uplink percentage of the NR TDD part is determined by
scheduling. Duty~LTE~, the maximum uplink percentage of the LTE FDD, can be
set up by TDM pattern or determined by scheduling. The maximum uplink
percentage of LTE FDD might be adjusted in order to keep the PC2 power.
The PC2 case 1 UE is allowed to fallback to PC3 if the LTE uplink scheduling
or the TDM pattern setting of the LTE UL, together with the scheduled NR
uplink duty cycle exceeds the duty threshold based on the equation (2).
### 6.2.2 Scheme 2
Specific LTE reference configurations are defined for FDD-TDD EN-DC HPUE duty
cycle capability reporting. The reported capability is maximal NR UL duty
which can fulfil SAR limits when assuming LTE FDD side being configured as the
defined reference configurations with the maximum UL power.
For case 1, the LTE reference configuration can be Duty~LTE~=70%. The default
value of NR UL duty capability can be 30% i.e. \"Duty~LTE~=70% and
P~LTE~=23dBm\", corresponding to default Duty~NR~=30%, P~NR~=23dBm.
Higher Duty~NR~ value can be reported as the UE capability e.g. maxNRDuty. If
the scheduled traffic fulfils DutyLTE\ 38.306 and that is the total maxUplinkDutyCycle of LTE FDD and NR > TDD uplink. Note in LTE TDD + NR TDD, the value is only for NR TDD > uplink.
  * UplinkDutyCycle~LTE~ is the percentage of LTE FDD uplink symbols > transmitted in a cetain evaluation period;
  * UplinkDutyCycle~NR~ is the percentage of NR TDD uplink symbols > transmitted in a cetain evaluation period;
  * P~PowerClass,\ EN-DC~ is defined in clause 6.2B.1.3 for inter-band > EN-DC. p~PowerClass,\ EN-DC~ is the linear value of > P~PowerClass,\ EN-DC~;
\- P~LTE~ is the value given by the field _p-maxEUTRA-r15_ of the
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration-v1510_ IE as defined in TS 38.331. p~LTE~ is the
linear value of P~LTE~;
\- P~NR~ is the value given by the field _p-NR-FR1_ of the
_PhysicalCellGroupConfig_ IE as defined in TS 38.331. p~NR~ is the linear
value of P~NR~;
\- Ratio~effect~ is to be defined in TS 38.306 as coefficient taking into
account electromagnetic energy absorption effect ratio of the LTE FDD band and
the NR TDD band;
The above equations of would be able to consider the important aspects which
should be considered while both are mutually exclusive relationships.
The above equations of would be able to consider the important aspects which
should be considered while both are mutually exclusive relationships.
From the performance aspect, it is better to introduce Ratio~effect~ in the
equation to utilize the UE\'s ability. For example, it is assumed that a UE
has imbalance of SAR effect such as Ratio~effect~ =2, that is SAR effect of NR
band is 2 times as large as that of LTE band. In this case, if we do not
capture Ratio~effect~ factor in the equation, UE is forced to report lower EN-
DC total duty cycle than what it really has. That is, assuming one of boundary
condition is such that DutyLTE=100% for LTE alone transmission and DutyNR=50%
for NR alone transmission, and if we does not introduce Ratio~effect~, UE are
forced to report EN-DC total duty cycle as 50% to consider the worst case
scenario although the UE has ability to transmit higher than 50% UL EN-DC duty
cycle.
On the other hands, the scheme 3 becomes meaningful only when Ratio~effect~ is
within reasonable range. If the value in the equation is set to 20, which was
mentioned by a certain company, LTE FDD uplink is almost not allowed. Given
that maxUplinkDutyCycle-EN-DC = 100% while LTE FDD (23dBm) + NR TDD (23dBm)
are assumed. If NR TDD uplink duty cycle is 50% for instance, the LTE FDD
uplink duty cycle is 2.5%. Even if NR TDD uplink duty cycle is 30%, still LTE
FDD duty cycle is 3.5%. The impact on LTE TDD uplink duty cycle depends on the
total maxuplink duty cycle. Hence, the range of Ratio~effect~ together with
the total maxuplinkdutycycle for EN-DC if that is introduced should be
discussed.
## 6.3 Case2 of power class 2
### 6.3.1 Scheme 1
The following equation is applied between the LTE UL duty cycle, NR UL duty
cycle and the overall duty threshold.
  * **Duty~LTE~ *( P~LTE~/ P~26~) + Duty~NR~ *(P~NR~/ P~26~) â‰¤ _Duty threshold ..._(1)**
P~LTE~, P~NR~, P~26~ represent the maximum linear power (mW) of LTE, NR, and
EN-DC power class 2 respectively; Duty~LTE~, Duty~NR~ represent the maximum
uplink percentage of LTE, NR respectively. Duty threshold represents the
maximum UL duty cycle that can maintain the PC2 power class for FDD+TDD EN-DC
HPUE.
In the case 2 of power class 2 FDD-TDD EN-DC UE, the maximum uplink power of
LTE and NR are 23dBm and 26dBm respectively. By setting the P~LTE~, P~NR~ to
be 23dBm and 26dBm, equation (1) can be simplified to the following equation.
But note that in case 2 PC2 UE, the total maximum power of LTE and NR cannot
exceed 26dBm when transmitting both LTE UL and NR UL at the same time.
  * **0.5*Duty~LTE~ + Duty~NR~ â‰¤ _Duty threshold..._(2)**
As same as the scheme in clause 6.2.1, Duty~NR~ is determined by scheduling.
Duty~LTE~ can be set up by TDM pattern or determined by scheduling.
The PC2 case 2 UE is allowed to fallback to PC3 if the LTE uplink scheduling
or the TDM pattern setting of the LTE UL, together with the scheduled NR
uplink duty cycle exceeds the duty threshold based on the equation (2).
### 6.3.2 Scheme 2
Specific LTE reference configurations are defined for FDD-TDD EN-DC HPUE duty
cycle capability reporting. The reported capability is maximal NR UL duty
which can fulfil SAR limits when assuming LTE FDD side being configured as the
defined reference configuration with the maximum UL power.
For case 2, the LTE reference configuration can be Duty~LTE~=40%. The default
value of NR UL duty capability can be 30% i.e. \"Duty~LTE~=40% and
P~LTE~=23dBm\", corresponding to default Duty~NR~=30%, P~NR~=26dBm.
Higher Duty~NR~ value can be reported as the UE capability e.g. maxNRDuty. If
the scheduled traffic fulfils Duty~LTE~\<40% and Duty~NR~\< maxNRDuty, UE can
maintain PC2 power.
For better flexibility, two LTE configurations are supported. Based on the two
LTE configurations {Duty~LTE~1, Duty~LTE~2}, UE optimizes its SAR compliance
capability and reports two _Duty~NR~_ separately, e.g. {_maxNRDuty1,
maxNRDuty2_}.
### 6.3.3 Scheme 3
The equation is same as that described in clause 6.2.3 while P~LTE~ and P~NR~
is set according to Case2 in Table 4.2-1.

## 8.2 Impacts on specifications for the other WGs (if applicable)
# 9 Summary
In this study item, different solutions which could facilitate Power Class 2
FDD-TDD EN-DC High Power UE to comply with applicable SAR requirement has been
throughout studied, with considering the fact that two kinds of UE
implementations could exist, i.e., UE implementation case 1 with power class 3
capability for both LTE and NR, and case 2 with power class 3 capability for
LTE and power class 2 capability for NR.
The scheme 1, 2, 3 provided in Clause 6 are UE capability reporting based
solutions for SAR limitation compliance designed for PC2 FDD-TDD EN-DC HPUE.
Particularly, the scheme 2 introduces the UE capability reporting containing
the upper limit(s) for the configurable UL duty cycle for NR TDD carrier under
the certain pre-defined LTE configuration(s) with upper limit(s) on the ratio
of accumulated time allowed for UE maximum power transmission scheduling over
the entire evaluation period. By comparing proposed schemes, RAN4 conclude
that with introducing the mechanism in scheme 2, network can be indicated with
the proper information to facilitate corresponding network configuration for
PC2 FDD-TDD EN-DC HPUE with the applicable SAR limit compliance.
During the study item, RAN4 identified that the scheme 2 shall be introduced
for specific FDD+TDD EN-DC band combination(s), and RAN4 observed that
detailed signalling design to enable scheme 2 shall have RAN2 specification
impact.
Meanwhile, RAN4 identified that network-configuration-based scheme in which
the HPUE set its total EN-DC power based on higher-layer signalling could also
provide the alternative methodology for PC2 FDD-TDD EN-DC HPUE SAR requirement
compliance without explicit 3GPP specification impact and without need for
signalling and cell-group coordination, while some concern raised for the
resultant LTE coverage reduction, and for the applicable SAR limit
compliance..
