# 1 Scope
The present document describes the test procedure for the radiated
performances measurements of the user equipment (UE).
The handheld UE measurement procedures explained in this document are defined
for roaming bands for the speech mode position (beside the head and beside the
head and hand) and hand phantom browsing mode position. Laptop mounted
equipment (LME) measurement procedures are defined for roaming bands for the
data mode transfer position (laptop ground plane phantom). Laptop embedded
equipment (LEE) measurement procedures are defined for roaming bands for the
data mode transfer position (free space).
The browsing mode position explained in this document applies when the UE is
held in hand, but not pressed against ear (such as web browsing and
navigation).
The data mode transfer position (free space) explained in this document
applies when the UE is used away from the user's head. Free space measurements
are applicable to devices used in the data mode transfer position that consist
of the laptop mounted equipment (LME) plug-in UEs and laptop embedded
equipment (LEE) UEs.
All bands are potential roaming bands, and the requirements for roaming bands
shall therefore be fulfilled for all bands supported by a UE.
Radiated performance of multiple-antenna receivers for handheld UE is defined
for roaming bands in free space configuration.
Recommended performance values for operating bands (Annex I) are however
included in this specification for information. It should be recognised that
the ability to meet the recommended performance values depends on the number
of frequency bands supported by the UE.
The radiated radio tests considered here are:
> 1\. The measurement of the Total Radiated Power (TRP)
2\. The measurement of the Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS)
> 3\. The measurement of Total Radiated Multi-antenna Sensitivity (TRMS)
The test procedure described in this document measures the performance of the
transmitter and the receiver, including the antenna and also the effects of
the user.

# 4 General
The device under test (DUT) presented in this clause is based on a device that
is tested to determine performance as defined in the present release of
specifications.
## 4.1 Terminal classes
### 4.1.1 Mechanical modes
  1. The mechanical modes of a DUT are declared by the manufacturer. A DUT shall have at least one mechanical mode. If only one mode is supported, then this is defined as the primary.
## 4.2 UTRA chip rates
  1. The requirements defined in this specification for UTRA are based on a chip rate of 3.84 Mcps (FDD) and 1.28 Mcps (TDD).
NOTE: Other chip rates may be considered in future releases.
## 4.3 DUT positioning
### 4.3.1 DUT positioning for Speech Mode with beside the Head Phantom
The positioning specified in this clause is used for the tests cases titled as
tests for Speech Mode with beside the Head Phantom. The characteristics of the
Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) phantom are specified in Annex A.2.1.
The DUT is attached to the SAM phantom in \"cheek\" position as defined both
by IEEE [28] and CELENEC [16] standards. The DUT performance is measured on
both left and right side of the head.
Three points as shown in Figure 4.3.1-1 define the reference plane: centre of
the right ear piece (RE), centre of the left ear piece (LE) and centre of
mouth (M).
At first, set the DUT ready for operation.
Definition of the \'Cheek\' position:
  1. Align the ear piece of the phone (see Figure 4.3.1-1) at the line > RE-LE. Then, position the DUT beside the phantom so that the > vertical line (see Figure 4.3.1-3) is parallel to the reference > plane in Figure 4.3.1-2 and is aligned with the line M-RE on the > reference plane (see Figure 4.3.1-3).
  2. Position the DUT so that the ear piece of the DUT touches the ear > piece of the phantom head on the line RE-LE. Tilt the DUT chassis > towards the cheek of the phantom having the vertical line aligned > with the reference plane until any point on the front side of the > DUT is in contact with the cheek or until the contact with the ear > is lost.
NOTE: A holder fixture made of e.g. plastic may be used to position the
handset against the phantom. An experimental study presented in [17] shows
that some plastic holders might introduce an unexpectedly large effect to the
measurement results. Therefore, special care must be seen when selecting such
fixtures for radiated measurements.

### 4.3.2 DUT positioning for LMEs on Laptop Ground Plane Phantom
The DUT positioning on Laptop Ground Plane Phantom means that a laptop ground
plane phantom is used for radiated performance measurements in case of plug-in
DUT like USB dongles that is used away from the user's head. This includes all
tests cases for LME devices. The characteristics of the laptop ground plane
phantom are specified in Annex A.2.3. The objective of the laptop ground plane
phantom is to reproduce the effects of the ground plane for the antenna of the
DUT while avoiding the variation of the measurements introduced by a real
laptop.
The DUT should be plugged into the USB connector and positioned in accordance
with the manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of
such a recommendation the DUT with either rotary USB porter or non-rotary USB
porter should be horizontally plugged into the horizontal USB connector, as
shown in Figure A.2.3-1.
### 4.3.3 DUT positioning for Speech Mode with beside the Head and Hand
Phantom
#### 4.3.3.1 General
The positioning specified in this clause is used for the tests cases titled as
tests for Speech Mode with beside the Head and Hand Phantom. The
characteristics of the Head and Hand Phantoms are specified in Annexes A.2.1
and A.2.2.
Speech mode is simulation of a voice call user case. DUT is placed in to a
hand phantom, which is holding the DUT against the SAM head phantom.
Positioning of the DUT in the hand phantom varies with the grip being used.
Positioning of the DUT against the head phantom is identical to Subclause
4.3.2 with the exception that 6°tilt angle from the cheek is being used
instead of having direct contact between the cheek and DUT. A mask may be used
to help configuration of cheek + 6° tilt angle. The mask is a 32 mm wide
conformal strip, created by sweeping the surface of the head phantom through a
6º rotation about the ear. Direct DUT contact against the mask thus
establishes the required 6º spacing away from the cheek, regardless of DUT
form factor. The material for the head phantom mask spacer shall have
dielectric constant of less than 1.3 and a loss tangent of less than 0.003.
Material additions can be used to help fixing of the mask spacer onto the head
phantom.
#### 4.3.3.2 Mono-blocks and closed sliders
This procedure applies to mounting mono-block DUTs and closed-slide DUTs, when
the DUT is less than 56 mm wide. For consistent, repeatable positioning that
conforms to the grip studies, an alignment tool with evenly spaced rulings is
first used to measure the DUT. Alignment Tool A in Figure 4.3.3.2-1, features
a 120º interior corner to ensure that the ring fingertip lands in the desired
position at the bottom of the DUT. The DUT is then positioned in accordance
with ruled markings on a conformal palm spacer regardless of any curvature in
the DUT corners. DUTs with rounded corners will sit lower in the tool than
DUTs having square corners, and thus give a different reading.
  1. Place the DUT face-up in Alignment Tool A with its side along the > side ruler, and slide it down until it makes contact at the 120º > corner. Record the bottom location of the DUT by reading off the > bottom ruler of Tool A.
  2. Observe the top of the DUT against the side ruler of the tool. If > the top of the DUT extends past the 120 mm marking on the side > ruler, then the additional length beyond 120 mm shall be added to > the reading from Step 1.
  3. Place the DUT on the right-handed or left-handed hand phantom spacer > between the fingers. The bottom location of the DUT on the spacer > should be aligned with the reading recorded in Steps 1 and 2. > Vertical centreline of the DUT should be centred with the spacer. > Make sure index finger is in contact with DUT.
  4. While keeping the DUT in the hand phantom in the position defined in > previous steps, place the DUT and the hand phantom against the > head phantom in such way that the DUT is in 6°tilt angle as > described in Subclause 4.3.3.

Figure 4.3.3.2-1: Alignment Tool A and right-handed mono-block hand phantom
with a spacer
NOTE: The Alignment tool is used to determine DUT bottom location on spacer.
Use left-handed (mirror-imaged) spacers with left-handed phantoms.
#### 4.3.3.3 Folds and open-slides
This procedure applies to fold and open-slide DUTs, when the DUT is less than
56 mm wide. To help maintain a consistent, repeatable positioning that
conforms to the grip studies, an alignment tool with evenly spaced rulings is
first used to measure the DUT. The DUT is then positioned in accordance with
ruled markings on a phantom spacer. Alignment Tool B in Figure 4.3.3.3-1
features two rounded humps upon which the DUT is suspended. One hump
represents the index fingertip of the hand phantom, while the other represents
the palm spacer. This design helps ensure that the index finger remains in
contact with the flip for any fold DUT geometry.
  1. Open the DUT and place it face-up on the alignment Tool B with its > hinge suspended between the two humps. The side of the DUT shall > be aligned against the side wall of the tool. The base of the DUT > shall rest on the wide hump with ruled markings, and the flip of > the DUT shall rest on the narrow hump.
  2. Tool B has an engraved line on the side wall. Align axis of a fold > hinge to this marking. An open slider should be slide > longitudinally until the base part of the DUT touches the narrow > hump of the Tool B. Record the correct longitudinal position of > the bottom of the DUT by reading off the ruler of Tool B. Visually > align the two halves of the split-level ruler to minimize parallax > reading error.
  3. Position the DUT in the right-handed or left-handed Fold Hand > Phantom. It should be resting on the index fingertip and palm > spacer, with the bottom of the DUT aligned to the ruling on the > right-handed or left-handed palm spacer that corresponds to the > reading from Step 2. Ensure that all fingertips are in contact > with the DUT.
  4. While keeping the DUT in the hand phantom in the position defined in > previous steps, place the DUT and the hand phantom against the > head phantom in such way that the DUT is in 6°tilt angle as > described in Subclause 4.3.3.

Figure 4.3.3.3-1: Alignment Tool B and right-handed fold hand phantom with a
spacer
NOTE: Use left-handed (mirror-imaged) spacers with left-handed phantoms.
#### 4.3.3.4 PDA
This procedure applies to DUTs that are from 56 to 72 mm wide. To help achieve
a consistent positioning, the DUT is aligned to a PDA palm spacer. No
alignment tool is required. The PDA spacer features side and bottom walls to
ensure consistent alignment of DUTs of various sizes.
  1. Place the DUT on the PDA spacer between the fingers and align the > DUT to the side wall of the PDA.
  2. If the DUT is shorter than 135 mm, then align the top of the DUT > with the top of the PDA spacer. Otherwise, align the bottom of the > DUT with the bottom wall of the PDA spacer.
  3. While keeping the DUT in the hand phantom in the position defined in > previous steps, place the DUT and the hand phantom against the > head phantom in such way that the DUT is in 6°tilt angle as > described in Subclause 4.3.3.

NOTE: Use left-handed (mirror-imaged) spacers with left-handed phantoms.
### 4.3.4 DUT positioning for Browsing Mode with Hand Phantom
#### 4.3.4.1 General
The positioning specified in this clause is used for the test cases titles as
tests for Browsing Mode with Hand Phantom. The characteristics of the Hand
Phantom are specified in Annex A.2.2. Browsing mode is used to simulate user
cases were the DUT is held in hand, but not pressed against ear e.g. web
browsing and navigation. The DUT shall be mounted in a suitable hand phantom
and oriented such that the DUT's main display is tilted 45 degrees from
vertical. Devices with a cover piece are tested cover open.
#### 4.3.4.2 Narrow DUT
This procedure is suitable for use with all DUTs narrower than 56 mm. The
alignment Tool A in Figure 4.3.4.2-1 is first used to measure the distance
between the bottom of the DUT and the centre of its navigation key. The DUT is
then positioned in accordance with ruled markings on a palm spacer to data
mode hand phantom.
  1. Place the DUT on the DUT alignment Tool A. Record the chin length > from the scale at the bottom of the alignment tool.
  2. Record the location of the navigation key (or the "2" key, if no > navigation key is present) on the side ruler of the DUT alignment > tool A. The key\'s centre is used as the reference.
  3. Add the two readings from Step 2 and 3 together. If the sum is less > than 30 mm, then use 30 mm location on spacer instead.
  4. Place the DUT on the right-hand or left-hand narrow data palm spacer > and align the side of the DUT with the side wall of the spacer. > The bottom edge of the DUT shall be placed on the narrow data palm > spacer at the ruling corresponding to the value obtained in > Step 4.
Make sure that the index finger is in contact with the back of the DUT. If the
device is very narrow and/or thin, it may occur that the middle finger does
not curl tightly enough to contact the DUT. In such case, in order to ensure
consistent test results, no attempt should be made to force the fingertip to
contact the DUT. Touch fastener material may be used to maintain the DUT in
the desired position.

NOTE: Use left-handed (mirror-imaged) spacers with left-handed phantoms.
#### 4.3.4.3 PDA
This procedure is suitable for use with DUTs of width 56-72 mm. The
positioning of the DUT in the PDA hand for data mode is identical to that for
speech mode described in Subclause 4.3.3.4.
### 4.3.5 DUT positioning for devices with embedded modules
The DUT positioning in a free space configuration without head and hand
phantoms, as specified in Annex A.2.4, is used for radiated performance
measurements in case of an embedded module card, which is used away from the
user's head. This positioning covers all tests cases for LEE devices.
Parameters required for Notebooks are specified in Annex A.2.4.2 and those for
Tablets are specified in Annex A.2.4.3.
### 4.3.6 DUT positioning for total radiated multi-antenna sensitivity
#### 4.3.6.1 Handheld UE -- Free Space
The DUT positioning for Handheld UE is done using free space configuration.
##### 4.3.6.1.1 MPAC Positioning Guidelines
The MPAC positioning guidelines of the handheld UE in data mode in the MPAC
system shall follow the requirements in Annex A.5.2.1.
##### 4.3.6.1.2 RTS Positioning Guidelines
The RTS positioning guidelines of the handheld UE in data mode in the RTS
system shall follow the requirements in Annex A.5.2.2.
## 4.4 Sampling grid
For the anechoic chamber based measurement procedures the measurement of TRP
is basically based on the measurement of the spherical radiation pattern of
the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far field in a group of
points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. Generally it can be
said that since the radiating object has a limited size the gain pattern
cannot change arbitrarily versus angle, and therefore only a limited number of
samples are required to represent the gain pattern to a given accuracy. The
samples of TRP are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta (θ)
and phi (φ) directions.
The measurement of TRS is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BLER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The samples of TRS are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions.
All the samples are taken with two orthogonal linear polarizations, $\theta$-
and $\phi$-polarisations. It is also possible to measure some other
polarisation components, if it is possible to recover $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations from the measured data by some technique.
Alternatively, different sampling patterns may be used if they are able to
ensure same or greater accuracy and provided appropriate measurement
uncertainty terms are applied. The TRP can be calculated by interpolating the
values to points on the regular grid. If an alternative sampling pattern is
used number of measurement points should be greater than in the regular
sampling grid.
For the multi-probe anechoic chambers procedures the measurement of TRMS are
taken using sample steps of 30° in phi (φ), i.e. with 12 different UE azimuth
rotations. For more details, see Annex A.5.
## 4.5 Number of independent samples (for reverberation chamber procedure)
When measuring TRP and TRS in an isotropic Rayleigh fading environment, 100
independent samples can be considered sufficient for ensuring an expanded
accuracy better than 0.5 dB. Observe that it might be necessary to collect
more samples than this during a measurement sequence in order to ensure a
sufficient number of independent samples, since all collected samples might
not be independent. The number of samples to be collected during a measurement
sequence for each chamber should be chosen so that the overall measurement
uncertainty is within the specified limits.

# 6 Transmitter Performance
## 6.1 Performance for handheld UE
### 6.1.1 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for UTRA FDD in Speech Mode with beside
the Head Phantom
#### 6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the UE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the UE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 7 and later releases.
#### 6.1.1.2 Minimum Requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel in beside head position shall be
higher than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table
6.1.1.2-1. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results of
both right and left side of the phantom head.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel in beside head position
shall be higher than minimum performance requirements shown in the columns
"Min".

The normative reference for this Subclause is TS 37.144 Subclause 6.1.1.2.
#### 6.1.1.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that $\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$of the UE is not below specified values. A lower
$\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and $\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$decrease the
coverage area.
#### 6.1.1.4 Method of test
#### 6.1.1.4.1 Initial conditions
The output power is a measure of the maximum power the UE can transmit in a
bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio access mode, for
more information see 3GPP TS 34.121-1 [7] chapter 5.2. The period of
measurement shall be at least one timeslot. Also care should be taken that the
noise floor of the measurement receiver is not disturbing the power
measurement.
Test environment: normal; see TS34.121-1 [7] Annex G.2.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see Table 5.1-2.
1) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table
6.1.1.4.1-1. Set the DPCH power such that there will not be transmission gaps
due to too low signal strength throughout the measurement.
2) Power on the UE.
3) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2. Compressed mode
shall be set to OFF.
4) Enter the UE into loopback test mode 2 and start the loopback test.
See TS 34.108 [4] and TS 34.109 [5] for details regarding generic call setup
procedure and loopback test.

Test dependent power
* * *
#### 6.1.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the UE against the SAM phantom
4) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from Subclause 6.1.1.1
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT.
The EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta
(θ) and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid may be
used to speed up the measurements (See Subclause 4.4). All the EIRP samples
are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 3: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements may be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
$\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard modulation.
$n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
#### 6.1.1.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the UE against the SAM phantom
4) Measure a sufficient number of independent samples (see Subclause 4.5) of
$S_{\text{21},n,m}$ using a test system having characteristics as described in
Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from Subclause 6.1.1.1.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the total
power radiated from the UE to a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power transmitted by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is sampled by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRP value.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
#### 6.1.1.5 Test requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel in beside head position shall be
higher than test performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table
6.1.1.5-1. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results of
both right and left side of the phantom head.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel in beside head position
shall be higher than minimum performance requirements shown in the columns
"Min".

measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 7 and later releases.

$\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$of the UE is not below specified values. A lower
$\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and $\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$decrease the

#### 6.1.3.4 Method of test
#### 6.1.3.4.1 Initial conditions
The output power is a measure of the maximum power the UE can transmit in a

more information see 3GPP TS 34.121-1 [7] Subclause 5.2. The period of
measurement shall be at least one timeslot. Also care should be taken that the
noise floor of the measurement receiver is not disturbing the power
measurement.
Test environment: normal; see TS 34.121-1 [7] Subclause G.2.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see Table 5.1-2.

#### 6.1.3.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the UE according to the DUT positioning for speech mode specified
in Subclause 4.3.3.
4) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from Subclause 6.1.3.1.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT.
The EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta
(θ) and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid may be
used to speed up the measurements (See Subclause 4.4). All the EIRP samples
are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 3: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements may be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
$\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard modulation.
$n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
#### 6.1.3.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.

4) Measure a sufficient number of independent samples (see Subclause 4.5) of
$S_{\text{21},n,m}$ using a test system having characteristics as described in
Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from Subclause 6.1.3.1.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the total
power radiated from the UE to a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power transmitted by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is sampled by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRP value.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.

### 6.1.4 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for UTRA LCR TDD in Speech Mode with
beside the Head and Hand Phantom
Editor's notes: This Subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
  * TBDs in Tables 6.1.4.2-1and 6.1.4.5-2 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
#### 6.1.4.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the UE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the UE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the TDD UE for
Release 8 and later releases.
#### 6.1.4.2 Minimum Requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel in beside head position shall be
higher than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table
6.1.4.2-1. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results of
both right and left side of the phantom head.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel in beside head position
shall be higher than minimum performance requirements shown in the columns
"Min".

### 6.1.5 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for E-UTRA FDD in Speech Mode with beside
the Head and Hand Phantom
Editor's notes: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
\- Table 6.1.5.2-1 and 6.1.5.5-1 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
#### 6.1.5.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the antenna
actually radiates, when non-idealities such as mismatch and losses in the
antenna are taken into account. The TRP is defined as the integral of the
power transmitted in different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Using $\psi$ to denote either $\theta$ or $\phi$, $G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the
$\psi$-polarization component of the gain pattern for the handset antenna
measured at the frequency $f$, where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing
the direction. $P_{\text{tx}}$is the transmit power level of the handset so
that $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the actually transmitted power-level,
also known as EIRP, in the $\psi$-polarization and in the direction $\Omega$
for frequency $f$.
The above equation may be written in \"gain\" form, that is, the TRP given by
P~TRP~ is normalized to the transmitted power $P_{\text{tx}}$. This is the
total radiation efficiency, which can also be denoted as Total Radiated Power
Gain, TRPG,
In practice discrete samples of $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$ are measured
and used to approximate the integral so that the TRP is computed as
Or, by using the relation $\text{EIRP} = P_{\text{tx}}G$:
In gain form the TRP can be expressed as:
In these formulas $\Delta_{\theta} = \frac{\pi}{(}N)$ and $\Delta_{\phi} =
2\frac{\pi}{M}$ are the sampling intervals for the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles, respectively, and the number of samples in the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles are given by $N$ and $M$, respectively. The sampling points of
the sphere are given by $\theta_{n} = \text{nΔ}_{\theta}$ and $\phi_{m} =
\text{mΔ}_{\phi}$. The sampling intervals are discussed further in Section
4.4.
When measuring power radiated by active devices, expressing the data in terms
of EIRP is more appropriate. The upper form of the TRP formulas (which
includes EIRP terms) will be used in the data processing.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the UE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the UE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
The requirements and this test apply to all types of LTE UEs independent of
release.
#### 6.1.5.2 Minimum Requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel in beside head position shall be
higher than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table

### 6.1.6 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for E-UTRA TDD in Speech Mode with beside
the Head and Hand Phantom
Editor's notes: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
\- Table 6.1.6.2-1 and 6.1.6.5-1 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
#### 6.1.6.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the antenna
actually radiates, when non-idealities such as mismatch and losses in the
antenna are taken into account. The TRP is defined as the integral of the
power transmitted in different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Using $\psi$ to denote either $\theta$ or $\phi$, $G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the
$\psi$-polarization component of the gain pattern for the handset antenna
measured at the frequency $f$, where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing
the direction. $P_{\text{tx}}$is the transmit power level of the handset so
that $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the actually transmitted power-level,
also known as EIRP, in the $\psi$-polarization and in the direction $\Omega$
for frequency $f$.
The above equation may be written in \"gain\" form, that is, the TRP given by
P~TRP~ is normalized to the transmitted power $P_{\text{tx}}$. This is the
total radiation efficiency, which can also be denoted as Total Radiated Power
Gain, TRPG,
In practice discrete samples of $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$ are measured
and used to approximate the integral so that the TRP is computed as
Or, by using the relation $\text{EIRP} = P_{\text{tx}}G$:
In gain form the TRP can be expressed as:
In these formulas $\Delta_{\theta} = \frac{\pi}{(}N)$ and $\Delta_{\phi} =
2\frac{\pi}{M}$ are the sampling intervals for the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles, respectively, and the number of samples in the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles are given by $N$ and $M$, respectively. The sampling points of
the sphere are given by $\theta_{n} = \text{nΔ}_{\theta}$ and $\phi_{m} =
\text{mΔ}_{\phi}$. The sampling intervals are discussed further in Section
4.4.
When measuring power radiated by active devices, expressing the data in terms
of EIRP is more appropriate. The upper form of the TRP formulas (which
includes EIRP terms) will be used in the data processing.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the UE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the UE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
The requirements and this test apply to all types of LTE UEs independent of
release.

or incomplete:
\- Minimum requirements are not specified in TS 37.144 yet

#### 6.1.7.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus,
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the UE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an

of the UE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to

measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.

### 6.1.9 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for E-UTRA FDD in Browsing Mode with Hand
Phantom
Editor's notes: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
\- Minimum requirements are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
\- Text for Subclause Procedure, reverberation chamber method
\- Test requirements are to be determined
#### 6.1.9.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the antenna
actually radiates, when non-idealities such as mismatch and losses in the
antenna are taken into account. The TRP is defined as the integral of the
power transmitted in different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Using $\psi$ to denote either $\theta$ or $\phi$, $G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the
$\psi$-polarization component of the gain pattern for the handset antenna
measured at the frequency $f$, where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing
the direction. $P_{\text{tx}}$is the transmit power level of the handset so
that $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the actually transmitted power-level,
also known as EIRP, in the $\psi$-polarization and in the direction $\Omega$
for frequency $f$.
The above equation may be written in \"gain\" form, that is, the TRP given by
P~TRP~ is normalized to the transmitted power $P_{\text{tx}}$. This is the
total radiation efficiency, which can also be denoted as Total Radiated Power
Gain, TRPG,
In practice discrete samples of $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$ are measured
and used to approximate the integral so that the TRP is computed as
Or, by using the relation $\text{EIRP} = P_{\text{tx}}G$:
In gain form the TRP can be expressed as:
In these formulas $\Delta_{\theta} = \frac{\pi}{(}N)$ and $\Delta_{\phi} =
2\frac{\pi}{M}$ are the sampling intervals for the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles, respectively, and the number of samples in the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles are given by $N$ and $M$, respectively. The sampling points of
the sphere are given by $\theta_{n} = \text{nΔ}_{\theta}$ and $\phi_{m} =
\text{mΔ}_{\phi}$. The sampling intervals are discussed further in Section
4.4.
When measuring power radiated by active devices, expressing the data in terms
of EIRP is more appropriate. The upper form of the TRP formulas (which
includes EIRP terms) will be used in the data processing.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of LTE UEs independent of
release.

The average TRP of low, mid and high channel in hand phantom browsing mode
position shall be higher than minimum performance requirements for roaming

for the TRP results of both right and left hand phantom measurements.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel in hand phantom browsing
mode position shall be higher than minimum performance requirements shown in
the columns "Min".

## 6.2 Performance for LME
### 6.2.1 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for UTRA FDD LME
Editor's note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are either
missing or not yet determined:
_\- The TRP Minimum Performance Requirement for this test is undefined_
_\- The Test Requirements and related Test Tolerances applicable for this test
are undefined_
#### 6.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 4.4.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the LME. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the LME for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LME.
NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 7 and onward UE's
supporting LME feature.
#### 6.2.1.2 Minimum Requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel shall be higher than minimum
performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.1.2.2-1. The
averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel shall be higher than
minimum performance requirements shown in the columns "Min".

$\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$of the UE is not below specified values. A lower
$\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and $\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$decrease the
coverage area.
#### 6.2.1.4 Method of test
##### 6.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions
The output power is a measure of the maximum power the UE can transmit in a
bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio access mode, for
more information see TS 34.121-1 [7] clause 5.2. The period of measurement
shall be at least one timeslot. Also, care should be taken that the noise
floor of the measurement receiver is not disturbing the power measurement.
Test environment: normal; see TS 34.121-1 [7] clause G.2.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see Table 5.1-2.
1) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table
6.2.1.4.1-1. Set the DPCH power such that there will not be transmission gaps
due to too low signal strength throughout the measurement.
2) Connect the plug-in UE to a laptop ground plane phantom. Power on the plug-
in UE. The real functional laptop supplies power to the plug-in UE.
3) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2. Compressed mode
shall be set to OFF.
4) Enter the UE into loopback test mode 2 and start the loopback test.
See TS 34.108 [4] and TS 34.109 [5] for details regarding generic call setup

##### 6.2.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the plug-in UE.
2) As the plug-in UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the plug-in UE into the USB connector in accordance with the
manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of such a
recommendation position the plug-in UE so that it is horizontally plugged into
the horizontal USB connector.
4) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from clause 6.2.1.2.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT.
The EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta
(θ) and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid may be
used to speed up the measurements (See Section 4.4). All the EIRP samples are
taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and $\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 3: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements may be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
$\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard modulation.
$n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
##### 6.2.1.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the plug-in UE.
2) As the plug-in UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the plug-in UE into the USB connector in accordance with the
manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of such a
recommendation position the plug-in UE so that it is horizontally plugged into
the horizontal USB connector.
4) Measure a sufficient number of independent samples (see section 4.5) of
$S_{\text{21},n,m}$ using a test system having characteristics as described in
Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from clause 6.2.1.2.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the total
power radiated from the UE/MS to a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment
with uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power transmitted
by the DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is sampled by the fixed
measurement antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRP value.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
#### 6.2.1.5 Test requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel shall be higher than test
performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.2.1.5-1. The
averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel shall be higher than

### 6.2.2 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for UTRA LCR TDD LME
Editor's note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are either
missing or not yet determined:
_\- The TRP Minimum Performance Requirement for this test is undefined_
_\- The Test Requirements and related Test Tolerances applicable for this test
are undefined_
#### 6.2.2.1 Definition and applicability
  1. The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 4.4.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the LME. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the LME for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the TDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LME.
NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 8 and onward UE's
supporting LME feature.
#### 6.2.2.2 Minimum Requirements
  1. The average TRP of low, mid and high channel shall be higher than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.2.2.2-1. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel shall be higher than
minimum performance requirements shown in the columns "Min".

#### 6.2.2.4 Method of test
##### 6.2.2.4.1 Initial conditions
  1. The output power is a measure of the maximum power the UE can transmit in a bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio access mode, for more information see TS 34.122 [8] clause 5.2. The period of measurement shall be at least one timeslot. Also, care should be taken that the noise floor of the measurement receiver is not disturbing the power measurement. Normally, the receiving device should be set accordingly so that the receiving signal will be at least 30 dB higher than the system noise floor.
Test environment: normal; see TS 34.122 [8] clause G.2.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see TS 34.122 [8]
clause G.2.4.
1) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table
6.2.2.4.1-1. Set the DPCH power such that there will not be transmission gaps
due to too low signal strength throughout the measurement.
2) Connect the plug-in UE to a laptop ground plane phantom. Power on the plug-
in UE. The real functional laptop supplies power to the plug-in UE.
3) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2.
4) Enter the UE into loopback test mode and start the loopback test.
5) The measurement receiver shall be set to: zero span, video trigger and RMS
detector. The RBW shall be at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio
access mode and the VBW at least 3 times bigger than the RBW. For 1.28Mcps TDD
UE, the RBW shall be set to 3MHz, and VBW shall be set to 10MHz.
See TS 34.108 [4] and TS 34.109 [5] for details regarding generic call setup

##### 6.2.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the plug-in UE.
2) As the plug-in UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the plug-in UE into the USB connector in accordance with the
manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of such a
recommendation position the plug-in UE so that it is horizontally plugged into
the horizontal USB connector.
4) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from clause 6.2.2.2.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT.
The EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta
(θ) and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid may be
used to speed up the measurements (See Section 4.4). All the EIRP samples are
taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and $\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 3: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements may be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
$\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard modulation.
$n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
##### 6.2.2.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the plug-in UE.
2) As the plug-in UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the plug-in UE into the USB connector in accordance with the
manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of such a
recommendation position the plug-in UE so that it is horizontally plugged into
the horizontal USB connector.
4) Measure a sufficient number of independent samples (see section 4.5) of
$S_{\text{21},n,m}$ using a test system having characteristics as described in
Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from clause 6.2.2.2.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the total
power radiated from the UE/MS to a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment
with uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power transmitted
by the DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is sampled by the fixed
measurement antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRP value.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
#### 6.2.2.5 Test requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel shall be higher than test
performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.2.2.5-1. The
averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel shall be higher than
minimum performance requirements shown in the columns "Min".

#### 6.2.3.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the antenna
actually radiates, when non-idealities such as mismatch and losses in the
antenna are taken into account. The TRP is defined as the integral of the
power transmitted in different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Using $\psi$ to denote either $\theta$ or $\phi$, $G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the
$\psi$-polarization component of the gain pattern for the handset antenna
measured at the frequency $f$, where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing
the direction. $P_{\text{tx}}$is the transmit power level of the handset so
that $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the actually transmitted power-level,
also known as EIRP, in the $\psi$-polarization and in the direction $\Omega$
for frequency $f$.
The above equation may be written in \"gain\" form, that is, the TRP given by
P~TRP~ is normalized to the transmitted power $P_{\text{tx}}$. This is the
total radiation efficiency, which can also be denoted as Total Radiated Power
Gain, TRPG,
In practice discrete samples of $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$ are measured
and used to approximate the integral so that the TRP is computed as
Or, by using the relation $\text{EIRP} = P_{\text{tx}}G$:
In gain form the TRP can be expressed as:
In these formulas $\Delta_{\theta} = \frac{\pi}{(}N)$ and $\Delta_{\phi} =
2\frac{\pi}{M}$ are the sampling intervals for the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles, respectively, and the number of samples in the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles are given by $N$ and $M$, respectively. The sampling points of
the sphere are given by $\theta_{n} = \text{nΔ}_{\theta}$ and $\phi_{m} =
\text{mΔ}_{\phi}$. The sampling intervals are discussed further in Section

## 6.3 Performance for LEE
### 6.3.1 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for UTRA FDD LEE
Editor's notes: This Subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
  * TBDs in Tables 6.3.1.2-1 and 6.3.1.5-2 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
#### 6.3.1.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the LEE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the LEE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LEE.
NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 7 and onward UE's
supporting LEE feature.
#### 6.3.1.2 Minimum Requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel of the LEE in the data transfers
position shall be higher than minimum performance requirements for roaming
bands shown in Table 6.3.1.2-1 for notebook devices and in 6.3.1.2-2 for
tablet devices. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP
results.
{width="3.1666666666666665in" height="0.5555555555555556in"}
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel in the data transfers

columns "Min".

#### 6.3.1.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that $\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$of the UE is not below specified values. A lower
$\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and $\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$decrease the
coverage area.
#### 6.3.1.4 Method of test
#### 6.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions
The output power is a measure of the maximum power the UE can transmit in a
bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio access mode, for
more information see 3GPP TS 34.121-1 [7] Subclause 5.2. The period of
measurement shall be at least one timeslot. Also care should be taken that the
noise floor of the measurement receiver is not disturbing the power
measurement.
The LEE shall be tested according to DUT positioning described in Subclause
4.3.5.
Test environment: normal; see TS34.121-1 [7] Subclause G.2.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see Table 5.1-2.

#### 6.3.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to Subclause 4.3.5.
4) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from Subclause 6.3.1.2.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT.
The EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta
(θ) and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid may be
used to speed up the measurements (See Subclause 4.4). All the EIRP samples
are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 3: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements may be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
> where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
> $\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard
> modulation. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
#### 6.3.1.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to Subclause 4.3.5.
4) Measure a sufficient number of independent samples (see Subclause 4.5) of
$S_{\text{21},n,m}$ using a test system having characteristics as described in
Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from Subclause 6.3.1.1.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the total
power radiated from the UE to a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power transmitted by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is sampled by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRP value.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
#### 6.3.1.5 Test requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel in the data transfers position
shall be higher than test performance requirements for roaming bands shown in
Table 6.3.1.5-1 for notebook devices and in Table 6.3.1.5-2 for tablet
devices. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results.
{width="3.1666666666666665in" height="0.5555555555555556in"}
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel in the data transfers
position shall be higher than minimum performance requirements shown in the
columns "Min".

### 6.3.2 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for UTRA LCR TDD LEE
Editor's notes: This Subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
  * TBDs in Tables 6.3.2.2-1 and 6.3.2.5-2 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
#### 6.3.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the LEE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the LEE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the TDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LEE.
Note: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 8 and onward UE's

The normative reference for this clause is TS37.144 [12] Subclause 6.3.3.
#### 6.3.2.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that $\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$of the UE is not below specified values. A lower
$\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and $\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$decrease the
coverage area.
#### 6.3.2.4 Method of test
#### 6.3.2.4.1 Initial conditions
The output power is a measure of the maximum power the UE can transmit in a
bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio access mode, for
more information see TS 34.122 [8] Subclause 5.2. The period of measurement
shall be at least one timeslot. Also care should be taken that the noise floor
of the measurement receiver is not disturbing the power measurement. Normally,
the receiving device should be set accordingly so that the receiving signal
will be at least 30 dB higher than the system noise floor.
The LEE shall be tested according to DUT positioning described in Subclause
4.3.5.
Test environment: normal; see TS 34.122 [8] Subclause G.2.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see Table 5.2-2.
1) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table
6.3.2.4.1-1. Set the DPCH power such that there will not be transmission gaps
due to too low signal strength throughout the measurement.
2) Power on the LEE UE
3) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2.
4) Enter the UE into loopback test mode and start the loopback test.
5) The measurement receiver shall be set to: zero span, video trigger and RMS
detector. The RBW shall be at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio
access mode and the VBW at least 3 times bigger than the RBW. For 1.28Mcps TDD
UE, the RBW shall be set to 3MHz, and VBW shall be set to 10MHz.
See TS 34.108 [4] and TS 34.109 [5] for details regarding generic call setup
procedure and loopback test.

#### 6.3.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the LEE UE.
2) As the LEE UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to Subclause 4.3.5.
4) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from Subclause 6.3.2.2.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT.
The EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta
(θ) and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid may be
used to speed up the measurements (See Subclause 4.4). All the EIRP samples
are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 3: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements may be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
> where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
> $\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard
> modulation. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
#### 6.3.2.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the LEE UE.
2) As the LEE UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to Subclause 4.3.5.
4) Measure a sufficient number of independent samples (see Subclause 4.5) of
$S_{\text{21},n,m}$ using a test system having characteristics as described in
Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from Subclause 6.3.2.1.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the total
power radiated from the UE to a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power transmitted by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is sampled by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRP value.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
#### 6.3.2.5 Test requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel shall be higher than test
performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.3.2.5-1 for
notebook devices and in Table 6.3.2.5-2 for tablet devices. The averaging
shall be done in linear scale for the TRP.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel shall be higher than
minimum performance requirements shown in the columns "Min".

### 6.3.3 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for E-UTRA FDD LEE
Editor's notes: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
\- Table 6.3.3.2-1 and 6.3.3.5-1 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
\- Applicability
#### 6.3.3.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the antenna
actually radiates, when non-idealities such as mismatch and losses in the
antenna are taken into account. The TRP is defined as the integral of the
power transmitted in different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Using $\psi$ to denote either $\theta$ or $\phi$, $G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the
$\psi$-polarization component of the gain pattern for the handset antenna
measured at the frequency $f$, where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing
the direction. $P_{\text{tx}}$is the transmit power level of the handset so
that $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the actually transmitted power-level,
also known as EIRP, in the $\psi$-polarization and in the direction $\Omega$
for frequency $f$.
The above equation may be written in \"gain\" form, that is, the TRP given by
P~TRP~ is normalized to the transmitted power $P_{\text{tx}}$. This is the
total radiation efficiency, which can also be denoted as Total Radiated Power
Gain, TRPG,
In practice discrete samples of $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$ are measured
and used to approximate the integral so that the TRP is computed as
Or, by using the relation $\text{EIRP} = P_{\text{tx}}G$:
In gain form the TRP can be expressed as:
In these formulas $\Delta_{\theta} = \frac{\pi}{(}N)$ and $\Delta_{\phi} =
2\frac{\pi}{M}$ are the sampling intervals for the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles, respectively, and the number of samples in the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles are given by $N$ and $M$, respectively. The sampling points of
the sphere are given by $\theta_{n} = \text{nΔ}_{\theta}$ and $\phi_{m} =
\text{mΔ}_{\phi}$. The sampling intervals are discussed further in Section
4.4.
When measuring power radiated by active devices, expressing the data in terms
of EIRP is more appropriate. The upper form of the TRP formulas (which
includes EIRP terms) will be used in the data processing.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the UE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the UE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
#### 6.3.3.2 Minimum Requirements
The average measured TRP of low, mid and high channel for laptop embedded
equipment shall be higher than the average TRP requirement specified in Table
6.3.3.2-1 for notebook devices and in Table 6.3.3.2-2 for tablet devices. The
averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results. Average TRP
requirement is shown in the column "Average" on the requirement tables.
In addition the lowest TRP of each measured channel shall be higher than
minimum TRP requirement specified in the column "Min" on the requirement
tables.

### 6.3.4 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for E-UTRA TDD LEE
Editor's notes: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
\- Table 6.3.4.2-1 and 6.3.4.5-1 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
\- Applicability
#### 6.3.4.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the antenna
actually radiates, when non-idealities such as mismatch and losses in the
antenna are taken into account. The TRP is defined as the integral of the
power transmitted in different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Using $\psi$ to denote either $\theta$ or $\phi$, $G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the
$\psi$-polarization component of the gain pattern for the handset antenna
measured at the frequency $f$, where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing
the direction. $P_{\text{tx}}$is the transmit power level of the handset so
that $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the actually transmitted power-level,
also known as EIRP, in the $\psi$-polarization and in the direction $\Omega$
for frequency $f$.
The above equation may be written in \"gain\" form, that is, the TRP given by
P~TRP~ is normalized to the transmitted power $P_{\text{tx}}$. This is the
total radiation efficiency, which can also be denoted as Total Radiated Power
Gain, TRPG,
In practice discrete samples of $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$ are measured
and used to approximate the integral so that the TRP is computed as
Or, by using the relation $\text{EIRP} = P_{\text{tx}}G$:
In gain form the TRP can be expressed as:
In these formulas $\Delta_{\theta} = \frac{\pi}{(}N)$ and $\Delta_{\phi} =
2\frac{\pi}{M}$ are the sampling intervals for the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles, respectively, and the number of samples in the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles are given by $N$ and $M$, respectively. The sampling points of
the sphere are given by $\theta_{n} = \text{nΔ}_{\theta}$ and $\phi_{m} =
\text{mΔ}_{\phi}$. The sampling intervals are discussed further in Section
4.4.
When measuring power radiated by active devices, expressing the data in terms
of EIRP is more appropriate. The upper form of the TRP formulas (which
includes EIRP terms) will be used in the data processing.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the UE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the UE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).

#### 7.1.1.4.2 Test procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the UE against the SAM phantom
4) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the UE causing BER value of 1% ± 0.2% using 20000 or
more bits, see Annex E.20.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
> freely selectable algorithm.
>
> 5) Measure the EIS for every direction of selected sampling gird using two
> orthogonal polarizations to obtain TRS.
6) Calculate TRS using equations from chapter 7.1.1.1
NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data
speed, PCL, BER target) can be used in the measurements. However to obtain TRS
result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by
Where $\text{EISstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with standard
setting. $\text{EISnstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with non
standard settings. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRS, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations (See Subclause 4.4).
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the measured data by
equation in Subclause 7.1.1.2.

5) Calculate TRS using equations from Subclause 7.1.2.1.
NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data
speed, PCL, BER target) can be used in the measurements. However to obtain TRS
result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by
Where $\text{EISstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with standard
setting, $\text{EISnstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with non

during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations (See Subclause 4.4).
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the measured data by
equation in Subclause 7.1.2.2.

### 7.1.3 Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) for UTRA FDD in Speech Mode with
beside the Head and Hand Phantom
Editor's notes: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
  * Table 7.1.3.2-1 and 7.1.3.5-1 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
#### 7.1.3.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The TRS can also be calculated from measurements in a Rayleigh fading 3
dimensional isotropic environment with in average uniform elevation and
azimuth distribution. The calculation of the TRS is in this case based on
searching for the lowest power received by the UE/MS for a discrete number of
field combinations in the chamber that gives a BER that is better than the
specified target BER level. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 7 and later releases.
#### 7.1.3.2 Minimum Requirements

2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the UE causing BER value of 1% ± 0.2% using 20000 or
more bits; see Annex E.20.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's

> 4) Measure the EIS for every direction of selected sampling gird using two

5) Calculate TRS using equations from Subclause 7.1.3.1.
NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data
speed, PCL, BER target) can be used in the measurements. However to obtain TRS
result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by

To ensure accuracy of TRS, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations (See Subclause 4.4).
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the measured data by

#### 7.1.3.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Set the base station simulator to a specific output power and perform a BER

4) Increase or decrease the base station output power as needed, and repeat
step 4 until the lowest output power is found that gives a BER value of 1% ±
0.2% using 20000 or more bits, see Annex E.20. This corresponds to $\left|
S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
> freely selectable algorithm.
5) Repeat step 3 and 4 until a sufficient number of independent samples (see
section 4.5) of $\left| S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$ has been
measured.
7) Calculate TRS using equations from chapter 7.1.3.1.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on samples of the received signal
power at the UE/MS from a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power received by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is transmitted by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRS value.
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the measured data by
equation in Subclause 7.1.3.2.

The Total Radiated Sensitivity is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The TRS can also be calculated from measurements in a Rayleigh fading 3
dimensional isotropic environment with in average uniform elevation and
azimuth distribution. The calculation of the TRS is in this case based on
searching for the lowest power received by the UE/MS for a discrete number of
field combinations in the chamber that gives a BER that is better than the
specified target BER level. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of LTE UEs independent of
release.

#### 7.1.7.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the UE causing BER value of 1% ± 0.2% using 20000 or
more bits, see Annex E.20.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
> freely selectable algorithm.
>
> 4) Measure the EIS for every direction of selected sampling gird using two
> orthogonal polarizations to obtain TRS.
5) Calculate TRS using equations from Subclause 7.1.7.1.
NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data
speed, PCL, BER target) can be used in the measurements. However to obtain TRS
result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by
> Where $\text{EISstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with standard
> setting. $\text{EISnstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with non
> standard settings. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRS, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations (See Subclause 4.4).

#### 7.1.8.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.

and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the TDD UE for
Release 8 and later releases.
#### 7.1.8.2 Minimum Requirements
The average measured total radiated sensitivity (TRS) of low, mid and high
channel for handheld UE shall be lower than the average TRS requirement
specified in Table 7.1.5.2-1. For the hand phantom browsing mode position the
averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRS results of both right and
left hand phantom measurements. Average TRS requirement is shown in the column
"Average" on the requirement tables.

#### 7.1.8.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to ensure that $\text{TRS}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRS}_{\text{max}}$ of the UE is above specified limit. The lack of the
reception sensitivity decreases the coverage area at the far side from Node B.
#### 7.1.8.4 Method of test
#### 7.1.8.4.1 Initial conditions
A radio communications tester or a corresponding device is used as a NB/BS
simulator to setup calls to the DUT. The NB/BS simulator is also used to send
test signals to the UE and measure the BER levels of the radio link and the
information on the dedicated channel needed to extract the DUT receiver
performances.
Chamber environment constraints and coordinate system shall be the same as
described in Subclause A.3.
Phantom Specifications shall be the same as described in Subclause A.2.2.
Test environment: normal; see TS36.508 [10] Subclause 4.1.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see Table 5.3-2.
Positioning Requirements shall be the same as described in Subclause 4.3.
1) Position the UE according to the DUT positioning for speech mode specified
in Subclause 4.3.4.
> 2) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table
> 7.1.8.4.1-1. The DL power level should be set to ensure 0% BER at 12.2kbps
> data rate at the whole 3D initial scan.
>
> 3) Power on the UE.
>
> 4) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
> control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2.
>
> 5) Enter the UE into loopback test mode and start the loopback test.
See TS 34.108 [4] and TS 34.109 [5] and Annex C of TS 34.122 [8] for details
regarding generic call setup procedure and loopback test.

#### 7.1.8.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the UE causing BER value of 1% ± 0.2% using 40000 or
more bits, see Annex E.20. The DL power step size shall be no bigger than
0.5dB when the RF level is near the TDD UE sensitivity level.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
> freely selectable algorithm.
>
> 4) Measure the EIS for every direction of selected sampling gird using two
> orthogonal polarizations to obtain TRS.
5) Calculate TRS using equations from Subclause 7.1.8.1.
NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data
speed, PCL, BER target) can be used in the measurements. However to obtain TRS
result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by
Where $\text{EISstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with standard
setting. $\text{EISnstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with non
standard settings. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRS, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations (See Subclause 4.4).
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the measured data by
equation in Subclause 7.1.8.2.

#### 7.2.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the plug-in UE.
2) As the plug-in UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the plug-in UE into the USB connector in accordance with the
manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of such a
recommendation position the plug-in UE so that it is horizontally plugged into
the horizontal USB connector.
4) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the plug-in UE causing BER value of 1% ± 0.2% using
20000 or more bits; see Annex E.20.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
> freely selectable algorithm.
>
> 5) Measure the EIS for every direction of selected sampling gird using two
> orthogonal polarizations to obtain TRS.
6) Calculate TRS using equations from clause 7.2.1.1
> NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data
> speed, PCL, BER target) can be used in the measurements. However to obtain
> TRS result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by
Where $\text{EISstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with standard
setting. $\text{EISnstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with non
standard settings. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRS, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations (See Subclause 4.4).
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the measured data by
equation in Subclause 7.2.1.2.

## 7.3 Performance for LEE
### 7.3.1 Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) for UTRA FDD LEE
Editor's notes: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
  * Table 7.3.1.2-1 and 7.3.1.5-1 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
  * Applicability
#### 7.3.1.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The TRS can also be calculated from measurements in a Rayleigh fading 3
dimensional isotropic environment with in average uniform elevation and
azimuth distribution. The calculation of the TRS is in this case based on
searching for the lowest power received by the UE/MS for a discrete number of
field combinations in the chamber that gives a BER that is better than the
specified target BER level. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.

The normative reference for this clause is TS 37.144 [12] Subclause 7.3.2.
#### 7.3.1.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to ensure that $\text{TRS}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRS}_{\text{max}}$ of the UE is above specified limit. The lack of the
reception sensitivity decreases the coverage area at the far side from Node B.
#### 7.3.1.4 Method of test
#### 7.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions
A radio communications tester or a corresponding device is used as a NB
simulator to setup calls to the DUT. The NB simulator is also used to send
test signals to the UE and measure the BER levels of the radio link and the
information on the dedicated channel needed to extract the DUT receiver
performances.
Chamber environment constraints and coordinate system shall be the same as
described in Subclause A.3.
Phantom Specifications shall be the same as described in Subclause A.2.4.
Parameters required for Notebooks are specified in Annex A.2.4.2 and those for
Tablets are specified in Annex A.2.4.3.
Test environment: normal; see TS36.508 [10] Subclause 4.1.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see Table 5.1-2.
Positioning Requirements shall be the same as described in Subclause 4.3.
1) Position the UE according to the DUT positioning for devices with embedded
modules specified in Subclause 4.3.5.
2) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table
7.3.1.4.1-1.
3) Power on the UE.
4) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2. Compressed mode
shall be set to OFF.
5) Enter the UE into loopback test mode 2 and start the loopback test.
See TS 34.108 [4] and TS 34.109 [5] for details regarding generic call setup
procedure and loopback test.

* * *
#### 7.3.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the UE causing BER value of 1% ± 0.2% using 20000 or
more bits; see Annex E.20.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
> freely selectable algorithm.
>
> 4) Measure the EIS for every direction of selected sampling gird using two
> orthogonal polarizations to obtain TRS.
5) Calculate TRS using equations from Subclause 7.3.1.1.
NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data
speed, PCL, BER target) can be used in the measurements. However to obtain TRS
result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by
> Where $\text{EISstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with standard
> setting, $\text{EISnstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with non
> standard settings. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRS, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations (See Subclause 4.4).
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the measured data by
equation in Subclause 7.3.1.2.
#### 7.3.1.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Set the base station simulator to a specific output power and perform a BER
measurement.
4) Increase or decrease the base station output power as needed, and repeat
step 4 until the lowest output power is found that gives a BER value of 1% ±
0.2% using 20000 or more bits, see Annex E.20. This corresponds to $\left|
S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
> freely selectable algorithm.
5) Repeat step 3 and 4 until a sufficient number of independent samples (see
section 4.5) of $\left| S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$ has been
measured.
7) Calculate TRS using equations from chapter 7.3.1.1.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on samples of the received signal
power at the UE/MS from a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power received by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is transmitted by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRS value.
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the measured data by
equation in Subclause 7.3.1.2.
#### 7.3.1.5 Test requirements
The average TRS of low, mid and high channel in the data transfers position
for 1% BER with 12.2kbps DL reference channel as defined in Annex C.3 of TS
25.101 [2] shall be lower than test requirements for roaming bands shown in
Table 7.3.1.5-1 for notebook devices and in Table 7.3.1.5-2 for tablet
devices. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRS results.
In addition the maximum TRS of each measured channel in the data transfers
position shall be better than minimum performance requirements for roaming
bands shown in the columns "Max".

### 7.3.2 Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) for UTRA LCR TDD LEE
Editor's notes: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
  * Table 7.3.2.2-1 and 7.3.2.5-1 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
  * Text for Subclause 7.3.2.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
  * Applicability
#### 7.3.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The TRS can also be calculated from measurements in a Rayleigh fading 3
dimensional isotropic environment with in average uniform elevation and
azimuth distribution. The calculation of the TRS is in this case based on
searching for the lowest power received by the UE/MS for a discrete number of
field combinations in the chamber that gives a BER that is better than the
specified target BER level. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.
[Applicability is TBD]

The average TRS of low, mid and high channel of the LEE in the data transfers
position for 1% BER with 12.2kbps DL reference channel as defined in Annex C.3
of TS34.122 [8] shall be lower than minimum performance requirements for
roaming bands shown in Table 7.3.2.2-1 for notebook devices and in Table

measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex

### 7.3.4 Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) for E-UTRA TDD LEE
Editor's notes: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
  * Table 7.3.4.2-1 and 7.3.4.5-1 as they are not specified in TS 37.144 yet
  * Applicability
#### 7.3.4.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Subclause 4.4.
The TRS can also be calculated from measurements in a Rayleigh fading 3
dimensional isotropic environment with in average uniform elevation and
azimuth distribution. The calculation of the TRS is in this case based on
searching for the lowest power received by the UE/MS for a discrete number of
field combinations in the chamber that gives a BER that is better than the
specified target BER level. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.

## 7.4 Radiated Performance of Multiple-antenna Receivers in the UE
### 7.4.1 Total Radiated Multi-antenna Sensitivity (TRMS) for E-UTRA FDD for
Handheld UE in Free Space
Editor's notes: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
\- Statistical significance
#### 7.4.1.1 Definition and applicability
Requirements in this section are stated for the free space configuration and
are applicable to handheld devices, and are not applicable to wrist-worn
devices.
For the MPAC methodology and the harmonized RTS methodology, the average TRMS
of free space data mode portrait (FS DMP), free space data mode landscape
(FSDML), and free space data mode screen up (FS DMSU), as defined in Annex E
of TR 37.977 [29], when measured at the mid channel shall be lower than the
average TRMS requirements specified in subclauses 7.4.1.2. The averaging shall
be done in linear scale for the TRMS results at these DUT positions. Two
average TRMS quantities are calculated from sensitivity measurements at 70%
and 95% throughput, respectively. Average TRMS requirement are shown in the
column "Average, 70" and "Average, 95" on the requirement tables.
{width="4.750694444444444in" height="0.325in"}
{width="4.750694444444444in" height="0.325in"}
Where
{width="4.509027777777778in" height="0.325in"}
Such that _MODE_ is one of {_FS_DMP, FS_DML, FS_DMSU_}, _x_ is one of {_70,
95_}, and {_P~MODE,x,0~, ..., P~MODE,x,11~_} are the measured sensitivity
values at each azimuth position.
For the MPAC methodology and the harmonized RTS methodology, if 1 azimuth
position does not result in a defined measured sensitivity at 70% or 95%
throughput, _S~MODE,70~_ or _S~MODE,95~_ are calculated using the 11 measured
sensitivities and the maximum downlink RS-EPRE _P~RS-EPRE-MAX~_ (substitution
approach) for the one missing result. If 2 azimuth positions do not result in
a defined measured sensitivity at 95% throughput, _S~MODE,95~_ is calculated
using the 10 measured sensitivities and _P~RS-EPRE-MAX\ ~_ for the two missing
results. If more azimuth positions result in undefined values for measured
sensitivity at the 70% and/or 95% throughput, then the TRMS requirement for
the corresponding throughput levels has not been met by such a device. _P~RS-
EPRE-MAX~_ is defined as -80 dBm/15 kHz and is the maximum downlink RS-EPRE
supported by the test system.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of E-UTRA FDD UE for Release
14 and forward.
#### 7.4.1.2 Minimum requirements

NOTE 5: For devices that exhibit non-linear throughput behaviour and that
achieve target throughput at multiple RF power levels, LTE MIMO sensitivity
level is chosen to be lowest measured DL power level which crosses the target
throughput level
3) Repeat Steps 2 for all azimuth positions: Rotate the UE around vertical
axis of the test system by 30 degrees and repeat from Step 2 until one
complete rotation has been measured i.e. 12 different UE azimuth rotations. A
list of orientations is given in Annex A.5.2.
4) Repeat Steps 2 & 3 for all MODEs as specified in Clause 7.4.1.1.

2) Select an appropriate orientation from the measured antenna pattern and
establish a radiated MIMO connection to the DUT using the V and H probes as
described in Annex A.5.1.2.1 second stage. Measure the transmission matrix in
the chamber and apply the inverse matrix to the MIMO signal. The DUT
orientation at which this is done is selected to optimize the achievable
isolation. The unknown gain of the DUT antennas represented by the absolute
accuracy of the RSAP measurement is then de-embedded from the measured antenna
pattern. This is done by comparing the RSAP measurement from the first stage
at the orientation being used in the second stage, to a second RSAP
measurement made in the second stage using a nominal signal of -60 dBm
adjusted by the uncorrected antenna gain for that orientation. The difference
in the RSAP measurements represents the true antenna gain for that
orientation.
3) With the desired channel model applied, measure the isolation in dB between
each stream as seen by the DUT receiver and ensure it is at least 15 dB
averaged over at least 200 RSAP measurements.
4) Using the calibrated radiated connection validate monotonicity of the DUT
RSAP and RSARP measurements over the range and step size defined in Annex R.
5) Once monotonicity has been validated, check the linearity of RSAP at the
orientation of the peak antenna gain over the range -60 dBm to -80 dBm is \

### 7.4.2 Total Radiated Multi-antenna Sensitivity (TRMS) for E-UTRA TDD for
Handheld UE in Free Space
Editor's note: This subclause is incomplete. The following items are missing
or incomplete:
\- Statistical significance
#### 7.4.2.1 Definition and applicability
Requirements in this section are stated for the free space configuration and
are applicable to handheld devices, and are not applicable to wrist-worn
devices.
For the reference MPAC methodology and the harmonized RTS methodology, the
average TRMS of free space data mode portrait (FS DMP), free space data mode
landscape (FSDML), and free space data mode screen up (FS DMSU), as defined in
Annex E of TR 37.977 [29], when measured at the mid channel shall be lower
than the average TRMS requirements specified in subclauses 7.4.2.2. The
averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRMS results at these DUT
positions. Two average TRMS quantities are calculated from sensitivity
measurements at 70% and 95% throughput, respectively. Average TRMS requirement
are shown in the column "Average, 70" and "Average, 95" on the requirement
tables.
{width="4.750694444444444in" height="0.325in"}
{width="4.750694444444444in" height="0.325in"}
Where
{width="4.509027777777778in" height="0.325in"}
Such that _MODE_ is one of {_FS_DMP, FS_DML, FS_DMSU_}, _x_ is one of {_70,
95_}, and {_P~MODE,x,0~, ..., P~MODE,x,11~_} are the measured sensitivity
values at each azimuth position.
For the reference MPAC methodology and the harmonized RTS methodology, if 1
azimuth position does not result in a defined measured sensitivity at 70% or
95% throughput, _S~MODE,70~_ or _S~MODE,95~_ are calculated using the 11
measured sensitivities and the maximum downlink RS-EPRE _P~RS-EPRE-MAX~_
(substitution approach) for the one missing result. If 2 azimuth positions do
not result in a defined measured sensitivity at 95% throughput, _S~MODE,95~_
is calculated using the 10 measured sensitivities and _P~RS-EPRE-MAX\ ~_ for
the two missing results. If more azimuth positions result in undefined values
for measured sensitivity at the 70% and/or 95% throughput, then the TRMS
requirement for the corresponding throughput levels has not been met by such a
device. _P~RS-EPRE-MAX~_ is defined as -80 dBm/15 kHz and is the maximum
downlink RS-EPRE supported by the test system.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of E-UTRA TDD UE for Release
14 and forward. Use of the TDD RTS test method requires the device supports
the ATF defined in Annex R, uses only two Rx antennas for the tested band and
the antenna pattern shall not change in response to the radio environment.
#### 7.4.2.2 Minimum requirements
Handheld UE TRMS minimum performance requirements for E-UTRA TDD in free space
and the primary mechanical mode for 70% and 95% DL throughput with the
reference measurement channel defined in Clause 7 of TR 37.977 [29] are
defined in Table 7.4.2.2-1.

and will remain valid as long as the setup and instruments remain unchanged.
Otherwise the channel model validation may need to be performed prior to
starting each throughput test.
4) Position the UE in the chamber according to Annex A.5.2.
5) Power on the UE.
6) Set up the connection.
##### 7.4.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Follow Steps 1 and 2 in Subclause 7.3.4.2 of 3GPP TS 36.521-1 [11].
2) Set the Downlink signal level to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in
Table 7.1.9.5-1 for 95 % throughput of the maximum throughput of the reference
channel (maximum throughput is per Annex A of 3GPP TS 36.521-1 [11]) for
azimuth position 0. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in
the uplink scheduling information to the UE to ensure the UE transmits P~UMAX~
level for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement. Measure the
average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance TBD.
NOTE 1: The downlink power step size shall be no more than 0.5 dB when RF
power level is near the LTE MIMO sensitivity level.
NOTE 2: The initial RS EPRE can be set to the user\'s freely selectable level.

NOTE 3: The throughput value target DL power level can be changed using
user\'s freely selectable algorithm.
NOTE 4: For devices that do not reach target throughput, the highest RS EPRE
at which throughput is measured shall be -80 dBm/15 kHz. The starting RS EPRE
level of the LTE MIMO sensitivity level search does not need to be specified
(NOTE 2)
NOTE 5: For devices that exhibit non-linear throughput behaviour and that
achieve target throughput at multiple RF power levels, LTE MIMO sensitivity
level is chosen to be lowest measured DL power level which crosses the target
throughput level
3) Repeat Steps 2 for all azimuth positions: Rotate the UE around vertical
axis of the test system by 30 degrees and repeat from Step 2 until one
complete rotation has been measured i.e. 12 different UE azimuth rotations. A
list of orientations is given in Annex A.5.2.
4) Repeat Steps 2 & 3 for all MODEs as specified in Clause 7.4.2.1.
5) Repeat Steps 2, 3 & 4 for 70% throughput as specified in Clause 7.4.2.1.
6) Use post processing and averaging method specified in Clause 7.4.2.1 and
calculate average TRMS for 70% and 95% throughput levels.
#### 7.4.2.4A Method of test for Radiated Two-Stage

UE antenna test function which is defined in TR 36.978 [34].
##### 7.4.2.4A.1 Initial conditions
A radio communications tester or a corresponding device is used as a NB/BS
simulator to setup calls to the DUT according to Clause P.1.
Channel model shall be set according to Clause M.1 and the emulated antenna
array configuration shall be set according to Clause M.2 and Annex C of TR

state for each test case.
1) Ensure environmental requirements of Annex O are met.
2) Configure the test system according to P.1 for the applicable test case.
3) Verify the implementation of the channel model as specified in Annex M.
NOTE: The verification of the channel model implementation can be part of the
laboratory accreditation process i.e. performed once for each channel model,
and will remain valid as long as the setup and instruments remain unchanged.
Otherwise the channel model validation may need to be performed prior to
starting each throughput test.
4) Position the UE in the chamber according to Annex A.5.2.
5) Power on the UE.
6) Set up the connection.
##### 7.4.2.4A.2 Procedure
The following steps shall be followed in order to evaluate MIMO OTA
performance of the DUT:
1) Measure the DUT complex antenna pattern at a nominal -60 dBm downlink power
as described in Annex A.5.1.2.1 first stage
2) Select an appropriate orientation from the measured antenna pattern and
establish a radiated MIMO connection to the DUT using the V and H probes as
described in Annex A.5.1.2.1 second stage. Measure the transmission matrix in
the chamber and apply the inverse matrix to the MIMO signal. The DUT
orientation at which this is done is selected to optimize the achievable
isolation. The unknown gain of the DUT antennas represented by the absolute
accuracy of the RSAP measurement is then de-embedded from the measured antenna
pattern. This is done by comparing the RSAP measurement from the first stage
at the orientation being used in the second stage, to a second RSAP
measurement made in the second stage using a nominal signal of -60 dBm
adjusted by the uncorrected antenna gain for that orientation. The difference
in the RSAP measurements represents the true antenna gain for that
orientation.
3) With the desired channel model applied, measure the isolation in dB between
each stream as seen by the DUT receiver and ensure it is at least 15 dB
averaged over at least 200 RSAP measurements.
4) Using the calibrated radiated connection validate monotonicity of the DUT
RSAP and RSARP measurements over the range and step size defined in Annex R.
5) Once monotonicity has been validated, check the linearity of RSAP at the
orientation of the peak antenna gain over the range -60 dBm to -80 dBm is \ | | +------------------+------------------+--------------+-------------+ | | | Average, 70 | Average, 95 | +------------------+------------------+--------------+-------------+ | 38 | dBm/15 kHz | -94.5 | -92.5 | +------------------+------------------+--------------+-------------+ | 41 | dBm/15 kHz | -94.5 | -92.5 | +------------------+------------------+--------------+-------------+ | NOTE 1: In this | | | | | version of the | | | | | specification, | | | | | restricted to | | | | | E-UTRA DL | | | | | operation when | | | | | carrier | | | | | aggregation is | | | | | configured. | | | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: | | | | | Applicability | | | | | for devices | | | | | supporting | | | | | 4-receiver | | | | | architectures is | | | | | not confirmed. | | | | +------------------+------------------+--------------+-------------+
###### ## Annex A (normative): Test system characterization and environmental
requirements
# A.1 General
The main objective of this section is to specify basic parameters of simulated
user (phantom) and anechoic and reverberation chamber suited for the Tx and Rx
measurement.
# A.2 Phantom specifications
## A.2.1 Head phantom
The Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) is used for radiated performance
measurements. The phantom shape is derived from the size and dimensions of the
90-th percentile large adult male reported in an anthropometric study. It has
also been adapted to represent the flattened ear of a wireless device user.
For DUT radiated performance measurements in \"intended use\" position SAM
head phantom without a shoulder section will be used.
The shell of the SAM phantom should be made of low-loss material (loss tangent
less than 0.05) with low permittivity (less than 5). The thickness has to be
2.0±0.2mm in the areas close to the handset in \"intended use\" position.
The phantom has to be filled with tissue simulating liquid. It is recommended
to use one of the typical SAR tissue simulating liquids and Annex B gives four
example recipes of such liquids. It is also recommended to verify the RF
properties of the liquid with suitable equipment. The values should be
maintained within 15% of the values relative permittivity 40 (±15%) and sigma
1.4 (±15%) at 1900 MHz. If the difference is more than ±15%, it should be
taken in to account in the uncertainty budget. Dielectric properties
measurement methods can be found e.g. in [16] [17].
Alternatively, a dry SAM phantom made of plastic material with corresponding
electrical parameters can be used.
NOTE: Measurements for the radiated performance of a UE can be influenced by
the hand presence. However, it is very difficult to develop a standardized
hand phantom, which could allow pertinent and reproducible measurements.
Therefore, a phantom hand is not included in this test procedure.
## A.2.2 Hand phantom
### A.2.2.1 General
Users hand can have a great impact on radiated performance of a UE. The impact
goes beyond blocking or absorbing a portion of the radiation, since the
impedance of the antenna itself may be changed due to the material in near
field. Thus, a standardized hand phantom has been developed for radiated
testing to reflect real world user scenarios [18].
### A.2.2.2 Dimensions
Dimensions of the hand phantom are based on 50^th^ percentile of the men's
hand and women's hand dimensions averaged together in order to produce a
standard hand phantom that lies in the middle of the expected range of users.
Figure A.2.2.2-1 illustrates the segments of the human hand and Table
A.2.2.2-1 summarizes the various dimensions for an open hand phantom [18].

#### A.2.2.3 Dielectric properties
Dielectric properties of dry palm human tissue are set as the target
dielectric parameters for hand phantoms [19]. The properties are presented in
Table A.2.2.3-1. It's important that the hand phantom has equivalent
electrical properties to real human hand to ensure that the same near field
effects are seen with the hand phantom as would be seen with real hand.
Relative permittivity of hand phantoms shall be within ±15% of the values
listed in Table A.2.2.3-1. Conductivity of hand phantoms shall be within ±25%
of the values listed in Table A.2.2.3-1. Methods for measuring dielectric
properties can be found e.g. in [22] [23].

### A.2.2.4 Hand phantom grips
Hand phantom grips are based on human factor studies that were done to record
how a phone of certain form factor was gripped by a large sample of people.
Based on the grip study findings, three grip designs are chosen for 40- to
56-mm wide devices: one for mono-block devices used in a voice call, another
for fold devices in a voice call, and a third for "data mode" grip, simulating
for example web browsing, Figure A.2.2.4-1 shows mono-block and fold grips
[20]. Grip studies showed that devices wider than 56 mm (generally PDA and
touch screen devices) could be conveniently accommodated by a single grip to
cover primary use cases, voice calls and data browsing [20].
Each grip is used with a spacer that is designed for repeatable positioning of
terminals to the grips. The material for the monoblock palm spacer shall be
hollow with a wall thickness less than 2 mm and a dielectric constant of less
than 5.0 and a loss tangent of less than 0.05 or it shall be solid with a
dielectric constant of less than 1.3 and a loss tangent of less than 0.003.
Touch fastener material may be used to affix the DUT to the palm spacer.
Figures A.2.2.4-1 and A.2.2.4-2 below illustrate the right-handed and left-
handed mono-block and fold grips, respectively.

#### A.2.2.5 Mechanical Requirements of Hand Phantoms
The hand phantoms shall be constructed of a material that is sufficiently
flexible to accommodate the range of devices specified in A.2.2.4. The
material shall also be made sufficiently stiff that the hand grip remains
constant under rotation.
Adequate material stiffness of the hand phantom is necessary to maintain high
repeatability of OTA measurements. The stiffness of the hand material shall be
verified by measuring the deflection of the index finger of a moulded
monoblock hand phantom under a given weight. Test procedure is following;
1\. Position the hand phantom such that the index finger is horizontal.
2\. Apply an indicator needle that extends horizontally 55 mm ±1 mm beyond the
tip of the index finger.
3\. Record the position of the indicator needle on a vertical scale.
4\. Apply 20 g ±0.2 g of weight centred 6 mm ±0.5 mm from the tip of the index
finger towards the hand.
5\. Record the new position of the indicator needle on a vertical scale.
The deflection of the index finger of the hand phantom shall be between 2 and
5 mm. Deflection less than 2 mm per 20 g weight indicates a material that is
too rigid. Deflection greater than 5 mm per 20 g weight indicates a material
that is too soft.

test
A weight container presented in Figure A.2.2.5-2 may be used in the stiffness
test. It is assumed that other grips will have similar stiffness as the
monoblock hand from the same material. Therefore, a stiffness test of the
monoblock hand alone is considered sufficient.

is horizontal are specified in Table A.2.2.5-1.

## A.2.3 Laptop Ground Plane Phantom
Laptop ground plane phantom is used for radiated performance measurements in
case of plug-in DUT like USB dongles. The objective of the laptop ground plane
phantom is to reproduce the effects of the ground plane for the antenna of the
DUT while avoiding the variation of the measurements introduced by a real
laptop.
The laptop ground plane phantom, as showed in Figure A.2.3-1, is composed by
the following parts:
> \- A rectangular plane covered by a conductive film on the upper side with
> thickness of 4mm to emulate the keyboard and main body of the laptop;
>
> \- A rectangular plane covered by the same conductive film on the upper side
> with thickness of 4mm to emulate the screen of laptop;
>
> \- The conductive film on the two planes is connected. The angle between the
> two planes is 110 degrees. The material is FR-4 copper-clad sheet and the
> length and width of these two planes are 345mm and 238mm respectively;
>
> \- A horizontal USB connector placed along the short end of the plane; the
> location of the port is at the right back corner, the distance between the
> central axis of the USB connector and the rear edge of plane is 45mm, the
> ground of the USB connector is welded on the conductive film of the plane.
> The detailed description of the structure is presented in Figure A.2.3-2;
>
> \- A USB cable crossing the ground plane and connecting the USB connector to
> a real functional laptop; the USB cable should be equipped with a shielded
> metal film, and the portion of the cable that is hung in the air shall be
> covered with absorbing material or treated with quarter wave chokes. The
> part of the USB cable lying on the plane is covered by a conductive adhesive
> strip used for fixing the cable on the plane and for guarantying at the same
> time the superficial continuity of the conductive plane. The shielded
> conductive film of this part of the USB cable is connected to the conductive
> film of the plane and the covered strip to well ground the antenna. The
> length of the USB cable should be no more than 3 meters.

negligible impact on the measurements: the real functional laptop is fully
wrapped up with anechoic absorbers.
## A.2.4 Parameters for embedded devices
### A.2.4.1 General
The main objectives of this section are to define basic parameters required
when performing TRP and TRS measurements on notebooks and tablets.
### A.2.4.2 Notebook
A notebook PC is a portable personal computer combining the computer, keyboard
and display in one form factor. Typically the keyboard is built into the base

# A.3 Anechoic chamber constraints
## A.3.1 General
The main objective of this section is to define basic parameters of the
anechoic chamber suited for the Tx and Rx measurement of UMTS and E-UTRA UEs.
The chamber should be equipped with an antenna positioner making possible to
perform full 3-D measurements for both Tx and Rx radiated performance. Two
main measurement set-ups are presented for this purpose:
a) A so-called spherical scanner system implies that the DUT is placed on a
positioner that rotates in a horizontal plane. The probe antenna is rotated
physically in the vertical plane. Alternatively, multiple probe antennas can
be placed along an arch in vertical plane and electronically switched in order
to get the full 3-D radiation/sensitivity pattern (see Figure A.3.1-1).
Alternatively a multiple probe system, which has a set of probes located on
the full spherical surface may be used [21]. In this case the DUT does not
have to be rotated.
b) A dual axis system implies that the DUT is placed on a positioner that is
able to rotate around two different axes. The signal is transmitted/received
by a fixed probe (see Figure A.3.1-2). It is noted that many conventional two-
axis systems (i.e. many commercially available systems built for a more
general use) are built for the support of rather heavy test objects (with
narrow antenna beam), which by their mechanical size may disturb the
measurement of nearly omnidirectional antennas. Note that such systems are
equipped with a positioner that may disturb the measurement of nearly
omnidirectional antennas.

antenna (left), and with multiple probe antennas (right)

{width="3.6125in" height="2.803472222222222in"}
Figure A.3.3-3: The coordinate system used in the measurements
In both cases the measurement antenna should be able to measure two orthogonal
linear polarizations (typically theta (θ) and phi (φ) polarizations).
Note that for an anechoic chamber, horn antennas are usually used as probe
antennas. There are two kinds of horn antennas: single-polarized and dual-
polarized. The dual-polarized horn antenna has advantages of a major
importance in comparison with the single-polarized. In fact, it is possible to
measure two orthogonal polarizations without any movement of the probe, and
this will:
a) Reduce the cable antenna uncertainty contribution
b) Improve the measurement stability
c) Reduce the time delay between the acquisitions of each polarized signal due
to the electrical RF relay.
If using single-polarized probe antenna, it is possible to perform the
measurements by turning one linear polarized antenna by 90 ° for every
measurement point. However, this technique has a major drawback: the cable of
this antenna is subjected to numerous bendings and rotations, which brings
some measurement instabilities. The various positions of the cable have an
effect on the repeatability of measurements, and the stress applied to the
cable can reduce its performance. The use of a \"stress cable\", or a rotary
joint, connected to the main low-loss cable that is connected to the BTS
simulator is recommended if using a single-polarized probe.
## A.3.2 Quiet zone dimension
Quiet zone has to be large enough to contain DUT attached to a phantom head
and shoulders. The dimensions have to be slightly larger than the phantom
dimension due to the fact that the rotation axes are not passing through the
symmetry plane of the phantom, but through the phase centre of the DUT. Thus
minimum radius of the quiet zone has to be 150mm, which is the approximate
distance from a UE to the edge of the head and shoulders phantom while the
phone is placed in an \"intended use\" position.
## A.3.3 Minimum distance between the DUT and the measurement antenna
For far-field measurements, the distance _r_ between the DUT and the
measurement antenna should be calculated by the following equation.
where λ is the largest wavelength within the frequency band of interest and
_D_ the maximum extension of the radiating structure. Then the phase and
amplitude uncertainty limits and the reactive near field limit are not
exceeded. The influence of measurement distance is discussed in Annex E.
## A.3.4 Reflectivity of the quiet zone
**Reflectivity of the quiet zone must be measured for frequencies used with
method described in Annex G. Measured reflectivity level is used in
uncertainty calculations.**
## A.3.5 Shielding effectiveness of the chamber
In order to be able to measure sensitivity all external radiation has to be
eliminated. Depending on the conditions at the test site in question,
different values of shielding effectiveness of the measurement chamber might
be required. The only general requirement on the shielding effectiveness of
the chamber is that the measured level of external signals at the frequency of
interest (UMTS, E-UTRA frequency band) has to be 10dB below sensitivity level
of the UE. See Annex G for more details on shielding effectiveness validation.
When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal value of
a parameter, or whether an option is supported.
# A.4 Reverberation chamber constraints
## A.4.1 General
The main objective of this section is to define basic parameters of the
reverberation chambers suited for the Tx and Rx measurement of UMTS, and
E-UTRA UEs.
The reverberation chambers have for a couple of decades been used for some
types of EMC measurements. A reverberation chamber is a metal cavity that is
sufficiently large to support many resonant modes, and it is provided with
means to stir the modes. The measurements in the reverberation chamber are
fast and repeatable, provided the chambers utilize efficient stirring methods.
The following sections describe how the reverberation chamber can be used for
measurements of TRP and TRS.
## A.4.2 Positioning and mode stirring facilities
  1. The reverberation chamber shall be equipped with mode-stirring facilities in such a way that enough number of independent power samples can be achieved for the accuracy requirement stated in this standard to be fulfilled. Possible mode-stirring methods include platform stirring, polarization stirring and mechanical stirring with fan-type stirrers, irregular shaped rotational stirrers, or plate-type stirrers. Also, frequency stirring is possible if the type of measurement allows for a frequency-averaged value, but this is not necessary if the chamber is sufficiently large and well stirred.
For the DUT positioning on head phantom or for the DUT positioning on laptop
ground plane phantom, the DUT should be placed in such a way that a sufficient
number of independent samples are obtained to fulfil the uncertainty
requirements. For example, for chambers utilizing platform stirring the DUT
should be placed on the edge of the turntable in order to maximize rotation of
the DUT. In addition, the DUT must not be closer than 0.5 wavelengths to other
electromagnetic reflective objects inside the chamber and 0.7 wavelengths to
absorbing objects.
For the DUT positioning on laptop ground plane phantom the real functional
laptop is laid on the floor of the chamber, supplies power to the DUT and
controls the state of the DUT. Both the USB cable and the real functional
laptop are properly setup in order to have a negligible impact on the
measurements: the real functional laptop is fully wrapped up with anechoic
absorbers. The real functional laptop can be placed outside the chamber if the
connection to the DUT can be maintained and if the communication interface
between DUT and real functional laptop has negligible impact on the
measurements.
A schematic picture of the measurement setup is provided in Figure A.4.2-1.
{width="6.534027777777778in" height="2.7847222222222223in"}
Figure A.4.2-1: A schematic picture of the reverberation chamber measurement
setup
    1. A.4.3 Polarization imbalance and receiving antennas \---------------------------------------------------
It is important that the statistical distribution of waves in the chamber
corresponds to the chosen test environment. Present knowledge about
reverberation chambers limits this to isotropic environments, i.e. the TRP and
TRS parameters can be measured. Since the probability of each polarization is
equal in the isotropic environment, a check of the polarization imbalance in
the reverberation chamber must be done.
The polarization imbalance can be obtained during the calibration measurement
by measuring both when the calibration antenna is oriented for vertical
polarization and when it is oriented for horizontal polarization. These two
values shall differ by less than the specification in Table A.4.3-1. In order
to obtain values for comparison with the results in the table, the reference
levels shall be measured for both orientations of the calibration dipole at 8
different positions of the dipole inside the chamber. The average, standard
deviation and maximum deviation shall be evaluated by comparing results for
both polarizations over the whole set of 8 measurements. Alternatively, the
levels for the two polarizations of the calibration antenna at 1 MHz intervals
between 1900 MHz and 2200 MHz can be measured, and thereafter the average,
standard deviation and maximum of the difference between the two sets of
values over these frequency ranges are calculated.
An effective way of avoiding polarization imbalance is to use polarization
stirring, i.e. using three orthogonal linearly polarized receiving antennas.
These three receiving antennas may be monopoles connected orthogonally to
three different and orthogonal walls (including ceiling/floor) of the chamber.
The three antennas are below referred to as the three fixed wall mounted
antennas.
_Table A.4.3-1: Specifications of differences of measured reference levels in
each frequency band between using vertically and horizontally polarized
calibration dipoles_
* * *
                       Maximum tolerable value
Average 0.2 dB Standard deviation 0.5 dB Maximum 1.0 dB
* * *
## A.4.4 Measurement antennas
It is important that the measurement antennas are configured in such a way
that the statistical distribution of waves in the chamber in average
corresponds to an isotropic environment.
## A.4.5 Chamber size and characteristics
The reverberation chamber shall have a volume large enough to support the
number of modes needed for the stated accuracy at the lowest operating
frequency. If the UE is moved around in the chamber during the measurement,
the volume of the reverberation chamber can be reduced. Also, frequency
stirring can be used to improve the accuracy. However, this will reduce the
resolution of the results correspondingly.
The reverberation chamber can be loaded with lossy objects in order to control
the power delay profile in the chamber to some extent. However the
reverberation chamber should not be loaded to such an extent that the mode
statistics in the chamber are destroyed. It is important to keep the same
amount of lossy objects in the chamber during calibration measurement and test
measurement, in order not to change the average power transfer function
between these two cases. Examples of lossy object are head and hand phantoms.
Furthermore, the DUT must not be closer than 0.5 wavelengths to other
electromagnetic reflective objects inside the chamber and 0.7 wavelengths to
absorbing objects.
## A.4.6 Shielding effectiveness of the chamber
  1. The shielding effectiveness of the chamber shall be as large as needed for the interference from other sources not to influence the measured parameters. This means that the requirements of the shielding is specific to each test site and may vary accordingly.
The recommended level of the shielding effectiveness is -100 dB from 800 MHz
to 4 GHz. See Annex H for more details on shielding effectiveness validation.
# A.5 Anechoic chamber constraints for Radiated Performance of Multiple-
antenna Receivers
## A.5.1 General
An OTA method based on the use of an Anechoic RF Chamber is described
consisting of a number of test antenna probes located in the chamber
transmitting signals with temporal and spatial characteristics for testing
multiple antenna devices.
This clause describes the methodologies based on Anechoic RF Chamber, where a
number of test antennas are located in different positions of the chamber, and
the Device Under Test (DUT) is located at centre position. The DUT is tested
over the air without RF cables.
### A.5.1.1 Multi-probe Anechoic Chamber
An OTA method based on the use of an Anechoic RF Chamber is described
consisting of a number of test antennas located in the chamber transmitting
signals with temporal and spatial characteristics for testing multiple antenna
devices. The method consists of a number of test antennas located in different
positions of the chamber, and the device under test (DUT) is located at the
centre position. The DUT is tested over the air without RF cables.
The Anechoic chamber techniques creates a realistic geometric based spatio-
temporal-polarimetric radio channel for testing MIMO performance using
Geometric based stochastic channel models as defined in Annex M.1.
The components of the solution include:
\- Anechoic Chamber
\- System Simulator (SS)

\- N linearly polarized antenna elements configured V, H or co-located V&H or
slant X polarizations
\- K azimuthally separated antenna positions with predefined angles at radius
R
\- Channel model definition for each test case
An illustration of an anechoic chamber is shown in Figure A.5.1.1-1 below.

A system level block diagram is shown in Figure A.5.1.1-2, which includes the
SS to generate the M branch MIMO signal, and an RF Channel Emulator with an
OTA Channel Generation Feature to properly correlate, fade, scale, delay, and
distribute the signal to each test probe in the chamber. For the selected
environmental conditions modelled by the SCME UMa and UMi channel models, the
minimum setup configuration can be described as below:

The full SCME or Multi-Cluster channel models are defined in Annex M.1. The
Single-Cluster model, which is not part of the set of channel models validated
in clause 8, would be based on the channel models defined in Annex M.1 with a
set of dithered AoAs around zero degrees.
#### A.5.1.1.1 Concept and configuration
For MIMO OTA modelling the geometric channel models are mapped into the fading
emulator, converting the geometric channel models into the emulator tap
coefficients. This process is illustrated in Figure A.5.1.1.1-1.
Figure A.5.1.1.1-1: Modelling process
The setup of OTA chamber antennas with eight antenna positions is depicted in
Figure A.5.1.1.1-2. The DUT is at the centre, and the antennas are in a circle
around the DUT with uniform spacing (e.g. 45° with 16 elements arranged in 8
positions, where each position contains a vertically and horizontally
polarized antenna pair). Denoting directions of _K_ OTA antennas with _θ~k~_ ,
_k_ = 1... _K_ , and antenna spacing in the angle domain with _∆θ_. Each
antenna is connected to a single fading emulator output port. In the figure,
for example, antenna A~1V~ denotes the first OTA antenna position and
Vertically (V) polarized element, A~8H~ denotes the eight OTA antenna position
and horizontally (H) polarized element, etc.

polarized chamber antennas
NOTE: In the drawing the V-polarized elements are actually orthogonal to the
paper (azimuth plane)
#### A.5.1.2 Radiated Two-Stage
The principle of two-stage MIMO OTA method is based on the assumption that the
DUT far-field antenna radiation pattern will contain all the necessary
information for evaluation of the DUT\'s antenna\'s performance like radiation
power, efficiency and correlation and that with channel model approaches, the
influence of antenna radiation pattern can be correctly incorporated into the
channel model. Thus the method will first measure the DUT\'s MIMO antenna
patterns and then convolve the measured antenna patterns with the chosen MIMO
OTA channel models for real-time emulation. The resulting test signal
generated by the channel emulator and coupled back into the DUT receivers
represents the signal that the DUT receivers would have seen if the DUT had
been placed in the desired radiated field. Thus an ideal implementation of the
two-stage method provides the same results as an ideal implementation of the
boundary antenna array method.
The two-stage method can be used to measure the following figures of merit:
1) Throughput
2) TRP and TRS
3) CQI, BLER
4) Antenna efficiency and MEG
5) Antenna correlation, MIMO channel capacity.
In order to accurately measure the antenna pattern of the intact device, the
DUT chipset needs to support received amplitude and relative phase
measurements of the antennas. The validity of antenna pattern measurement is
predicated on the assumption that for the frequency being tested, the DUT
antenna pattern is static. Devices than can alter their antenna pattern in
real time as a function of the radiated environment is not supported. The
method of coupling the base station emulator and DUT uses a specially
calibrated radiated connection (radiated two-stage or RTS method) to do the
test on throughput, etc., to test how the MIMO antennas will influence the
performance. The conducted method of coupling is straightforward but does not
capture the impact of radiated leakage from the DUT transmit antennas to the
DUT receive antennas, thus in its current form without additional interference
estimation the conducted method of coupling in the second stage is not
proposed for use in conformance testing. Its description is included for
historical completeness of the development of the two-stage method. The
radiated method of coupling in the second stage does fully capture radiated
leakage and is the method defined for conformance testing.
##### A.5.1.2.1 Concept and configuration
The assumption of the two-stage MIMO OTA method is that the measured far field
antenna pattern of the DUT\'s multiple antennas can fully capture the mutual
coupling of the multiple antenna arrays and their influence on radiated
performance.\ Thus to do the two-stage MIMO OTA test, the antenna patterns of
the antenna array needs to be measured accurately in the first stage. In order
to accurately measure the antenna pattern of the intact device, the chipset
needs to support amplitude and relative phase measurements of the antennas. To
achieve this, two new UE measurements have been defined called Reference
Signal Antenna Power (RSAP) and Reference Signal Relative Antenna Phase
(RSARP). These measurements are defined in TS 36.509 [34].
**Stage 1:** The measurement of the DUT's multiple antennas takes place in a
traditional anechoic chamber set up as described in Annex A.3, where the DUT
is put into the chamber and each antenna element\'s complex far zone pattern
is measured using the RSAP and RSARP measurements defined in TR 36.509 [34].
The influence of human body loss can also be measured by attaching the DUT to
a SAM head and or hand phantom when doing the antenna pattern measurements.
The characteristics of the SAM phantom are specified in Annex A.2. The chamber
is equipped with a positioner, that makes it possible to perform full 3-D far
zone pattern measurements for both Tx and Rx radiated performance. As
specified in A.3, the measurement antenna shall be able to measure two
orthogonal polarizations (typically linear theta (θ) and phi (φ) polarizations
as shown in Figure A.5.1.2.1-1).
{width="3.301388888888889in" height="3.5215277777777776in"}
Figure A.5.1.2.1-1: The coordinate system used in the measurements
**Stage 2:** Convolve the antenna patterns measured in stage 1 with the chosen
MIMO channel model, using a channel emulator and then use the resulting signal
to perform the OTA throughput test. The signal is coupled into the DUT using a
radiated connection.
The radiated two-stage (RTS) method is illustrated in Figure A.5.1.2.1-2. The
BS emulator is connected to the MIMO channel emulator and then to the DUT
using a calibrated radiated connection in an anechoic environment. This
coupling technique exploits the Eigen modes of the transmission channel in the
anechoic chamber to provide isolated radiated connections between the probe
antennas and each DUT receiver after the DUT antenna.
To convolve the DUT antenna patterns with MIMO channel model.
a) Apply antenna patterns to correlation-based channel models. With a
correlation matrix calculation method for arbitrary antenna patterns under
multipath channel conditions, the correlation matrix and the antenna imbalance
can be calculated and then emulated by the channel emulator.
Figure A.5.1.2.1-2: Radiated two-stage (RTS) test methodology for MIMO OTA
test
Figure A.5.1.2.1-2 shows the radiated coupling method for the second stage.
Two probe antennas with polarization V and H are co-located in the anechoic
chamber. Note, unlike in the first stage where the V and H probes are used at
different times, in the second stage both V and H probes are used
simultaneously. An example implementation of this would be the dual polarized
configuration described in Annex A.3. Due to the propagation channel in the
chamber, signals transmitted from each probe antenna are received by both DUT
antennas. However, by precoding the transmitted signals using spatial
multiplexing techniques it is possible by calculating the radiated channel
matrix and by applying its inverse to the transmitted signals, to create an
identity matrix allowing the transmitted signals to be received independently
at each DUT receiver after the DUT antenna.
The establishment of the radiated connection is explained as follows. Assume
{width="0.15in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}and{width="0.15in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"} are the transmitted signals from the base
station emulator, after applying the desired channel model and convolution
with the complex antenna pattern we get:
{width="0.35833333333333334in" height="0.20833333333333334in"} and
{width="0.36666666666666664in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}.
The radiated channel matrix between the probe antennas and the DUT antennas is
{width="0.9in" height="0.375in"} .
If the channel emulator applies the inverse of the radiated channel matrix
{width="0.9666666666666667in" height="0.375in"} to
{width="0.35833333333333334in" height="0.20833333333333334in"} and
{width="0.36666666666666664in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}, the signal
received after the DUT antennas is same as if the channel emulator were
directly connected to equivalent antenna connectors:
{width="4.6090277777777775in" height="0.44166666666666665in"}
The above example of RTS using two probe antennas is applicable to UE with two
Rx antennas. For UE with > 2 Rx antennas, the RTS method is FFS.
## A.5.2 Testing environment conditions
This annex lists the testing environment conditions for all DUT types relevant
to testing of radiated performance of multiple-antenna receivers. The use
cases (positioning) discussed here are applicable for all methodologies,
however the orientation and rotations described may be applicable for some
methodologies only, and not for some other methodologies.
Table A.5.2-1 below lists the testing environment conditions along with a
diagram and applicable references. The reference coordinate system and
orientation of devices in that coordinate system is shown in Figure A.5.2-1
below that includes the mechanical alignment of a phone. For tablets the home
button, charging connector and similar components can be used to define top
and bottom. For laptops the definitions specified in 3GPP TR 25.914 [3] (and
repeated here in Table A.5.2-1) are used. In the case of methodologies
utilizing a spatial channel model in Figure A.5.2-1, the X axis points towards
the channel model reference. For example in the case of an anechoic chamber
utilizing 2D antenna array in the azimuth plane (XY plane from Figure A.5.2-1)
this is the direction of the first probe at 0 degrees.
{width="2.811111111111111in" height="4.000694444444444in"}
Figure A.5.2-1: Reference coordinate system and reference device orientation
First the terminology used below is defined here. Where possible consistency
with [3], [30], [31] and [32] is sought.
**Use Case (Position):** the use case (position) indicates how the DUT is
related to its environment. This includes the following example use cases:
free space, beside head, beside head and hand, hand only, etc. Note that
formerly this has been referred to as position in [6] as well as in [32].
Since to date only isotropic metrics have been used (TRP/TRS) the definition
of positioning the device for a certain use case has been equivalent to
orienting it relative to the environment. With the introduction of spatial
channel models, the positioning for a specific use case has to be separated
from the actual orientation relative to the spatial incoming signals. For some
methodologies not utilizing spatial channel models this distinction might not
be necessary.
**Orientation:** The orientation of the device in three dimensional space is
defined using the three Euler angles -- Ψ-yaw; Θ-pitch; Φ-roll as defined in
[30] and [31] and linked to the reference coordinate systems and reference
orientation from Figure A.5.2-1. Note that for most use cases practical
considerations of how to position the DUT together with the phantom may
determine the DUT orientation.
**Rotation:** Once positioned for a specific use case and oriented within the
reference coordinate system, the DUT and phantom are rotated within the test
zone to measure the performance under various spatial channel illuminations.
The rotation is defined with the same Euler angles but expressed as vectors of
equal size. An example is given below:
EXAMPLE: Consider a DUT measured in an anechoic chamber [29].\ To measure the
free space use case in the YZ plane (see Table A.5.2-1) for example at every
30 degrees the rotation vectors would be as follows:
Ψ = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] - a vector of 12 zeros indicating no rotation
from the reference position for any phi value below
Θ = [-90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90] -- a vector of 12 values
equal to -90 indicating a constant pitch of -90 degrees for all phi values
below
Φ = [0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330] -- a vector of 12 distinct
rotations from the reference position representing a rotation along the
azimuth plane with a step of 30 degrees.
These vectors unambiguously define that the DUT is to be oriented with the
screen up and rotated in azimuth every 30 degrees. The principal antenna
pattern cuts (XY plane, XZ plane, and YZ plane) are defined in [30]. The XY
plane cut corresponds to the absolute throughput testing condition applied to
the CTIA reference antennas for the inter-lab inter- technique activity. They
XZ plane and YZ plane cuts are shown for completeness and are not required for
the absolute data throughput framework. The YZ plane cut corresponds to a
device positioned with its screen up in a USB/WLAN tethering scenario and may
be a useful testing point for handset devices expected to achieve performance
metrics under such usage conditions.

  1. The purpose of the calibration measurement is to determine the average power transfer function in the chamber, mismatch of fixed measurement antennas and path losses in cables connecting the power sampling instrument and the fixed measurement antennas. Preferably a network analyzer is used for these measurements. Recommended calibration antennas are dipoles tuned to the frequency band of interest.
In general, the calibration of a reverberation chamber is performed in three
steps:
    1. 1\. Measurement of S-parameters through the reverberation > chamber for a complete stirring sequence
> 2\. Calculation of the chamber reference transfer function
>
> 3\. Measurement of connecting cable insertion loss
If several setups are used (e.g. empty chamber, chamber with head or hand
phantom, etc.), steps 1 and 2 must be repeated for each configuration. The
calibration measurement setup is shown in Figure B.2.2-1.

using a vector network analyzer
### B.2.2.1 Measurement of S-parameters through the chamber for a complete
stirring sequence
  1. This step will measure S-parameters through the reverberation chamber through a complete stirring sequence. This information is required to determine the chamber's reference transfer function. The procedure must be performed separately for each measurement setup of which the loading of the chamber has been changed. The calibration procedure must be repeated for each frequency as defined above. Therefore, it is advantageous if the network analyzer can be set to a frequency sweep covering the defined frequencies, so that all frequencies of interest can be measured with a minimal number of measurement runs.
> i. Place all objects into the RC which will be used during TRP or TRS
> measurements, including a head phantom, hand phantom and fixture for the
> EUT. This ensures that the loss in the chamber, which determines the average
> power transfer level, is the same during both calibration and test
> measurements. Also, if the EUT is large or contains many antennas, it may
> represent a noticeable loading of the chamber. It should then be present in
> the chamber and turned on during the calibration.
>
> ii. Place the calibration antenna inside the chamber. The calibration
> antenna is preferably mounted on a low-loss dielectric fixture, to avoid
> effects from the fixture itself which may affect the EUT's radiation
> efficiency and mismatch factor. The calibration antenna must be placed in
> the chamber in such a way that it is far enough from any walls, mode-
> stirrers, head phantom, hand phantom, or other object, such that the
> environment for the calibration antenna (taken over the complete stirring
> sequence) resembles a free space environment** _. "Far enough away" depends
> on the type of calibration antenna used. For low gain nearly omni-
> directional antennas like dipoles, it is normally sufficient to ensure that
> this spacing is larger than 0.5 wavelengths. More directive calibration
> antennas should be situated towards the centre of the chamber. The
> calibration antenna should be present in the chamber during the TRP/TRS
> measurements._**
>
> iii. Calibrate the network analyzer with a full 2-port calibration in such a
> way that the vector S-parameters between the ports of the fixed measurement
> antenna and the calibration antenna can be accurately measured. Preferably,
> the network analyzer is set to perform a frequency sweep at each stirrer
> position. This will enable calibration of several frequency points during
> the same stirring sequence, thereby reducing calibration time. This will
> also enable frequency stirring, i.e., averaging the measured power transfer
> function over a small frequency bandwidth around each measured frequency
> point (moving frequency window). This will increase accuracy at the expense
> of frequency resolution.
>
> iv. Connect the antennas and measure the S-parameters for each stirrer
> position and each fixed measurement antenna.
The number of stirrer positions in the chosen stirring sequence, i.e. the
number of S-parameter samples at each frequency point, should be chosen in
such a way that it is large enough to yield an acceptable statistical
contribution to the total measurement uncertainty. As a guideline it should be
larger than 100, preferable 200 or 400 to ensure that the number of
independent samples is not severely limited by the total number of samples
measured. The number of independent samples, which is a subset of all samples,
determines the statistical contribution to the expanded accuracy (which is two
times the standard deviation). This should be not less than 100 to ensure an
expanded accuracy better than 0.5 dB. The number of independent samples
depends on the operating frequency, volume of the chamber, efficacy of the
chamber's stirrers, the level of loading by absorbing objects, and whether or
not frequency stirring is used.
The sequence of moving the stirrers to different positions may be either step-
wise (stopping stirrer for each sample) or continuous (sampling on-the-fly).
With continuous stirring it may not be possible to characterize the chamber
over a wide frequency band at the same time.
### B.2.2.2 Calculation of the chamber reference transfer function
From the S-parameters obtained in the calibration measurement, the chamber
reference transfer function for fixed antenna _n_ can be calculated. The
reflection coefficient for fixed antenna _n_ can be calculated by the
following equation,
Thus, the chamber reference transfer function can be calculated by the
following equation,
where _M_ is the total number of samples of the transfer function measured for
each fixed measurement antenna and $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of
the transfer function for measurement antenna n. Moreover,
$\overline{S_{\text{22}}}$ is the complex average of the calibration antenna
reflection coefficient. Finally, $e_{\text{ref}}$ is the radiation efficiency
of the calibration antenna.
NOTE: The radiation efficiency of the fixed antenna is not corrected for
because it will be the same both during calibration and measurements.
Therefore, the fixed antenna's radiation efficiency will not affect the final
results. The same can be said about the mismatch factor of the fixed
measurement antennas, but it is still advantageous to correct for this factor
if frequency stirring is applied to improve accuracy.
### B.2.2.3 Cable calibration
This measurement step will calibrate the power loss of the cable needed to
connect the instrument used to measure the received power at the fixed
measurement antenna during TRP measurements, and to generate the power
radiated by the fixed antenna during TRS measurements.
i. Disconnect the cables between the VNA and the chamber.
ii. Connect the cables one-by-one between the two ports of the network
analyzer. The VNA must be calibrated at its own two ports.
iii. Measure the frequency response of the transmission S-parameter ( or ) of
the cable.
> iv. Save the power transfer values () of the frequency response curve for
> the test frequencies and cables positions, etc).
Calibration shall be performed yearly or if any equipment in the measurement
system is changed.
## B.2.3 Calibration procedure for Anechoic chamber method with Multiprobe
configuration
The system needs to be calibrated in two steps in order to ensure that the
absolute power is correct. The first calibration steps ensures the accurate
generation of the channel model in the centre of the chamber as required by
Annex L.4.\ The second step validates the total power as would be seen by the
DUT and allows for that power to be scaled up or down if necessary.
Considering the complexity of the system various way to calibrate are
possible. The end goals are however the same no matter the exact procedure.
The two steps must achieve the following:
**Step 1:** This step is used to equalize the power in the centre coming from
the different probes. This being a relative measurement is very robust and
with minimal uncertainty. It is sufficient to use instruments calibrated
according to the manufacturer\'s specifications and the measurements require
no additional calibration. This step is done for both vertical and horizontal
polarizations. The relative differences between probe path losses are recorded
and used (typically in the fading emulator) to adjust the generated fading
signals for each probe. Example measurement set-up is shown in Figure
B.2.3.1-1.
NOTE 1: If Step 1 is performed as an absolute measurement accounting for the
cable and reference antenna gains Step 2 can be omitted.
**Step 2:** This step is used to measure the total absolute power of at least
one polarization in the centre of the ring. Then assuming that validation of
the channel models has been done, the total power available to the DUT in the
centre of the chamber can be computed. If necessary the power can be scaled up
or down to achieve the desired power level. Since this is an absolute power
measurement, the measurement cable and reference antenna gains have to be
accounted for.
NOTE 2: To minimize measurement uncertainty the passive and active components
of the system may be calibrated independently as well as at different
intervals.
NOTE 3: Step 2 of the calibration should be performed with the channel model
loaded and LTE signalling active. Sufficient amount of time averaging is
required because of the fading nature of the models used.
NOTE 4: Various ways of performing the two steps may exist depending on the
equipment used.\ The lab is responsible for providing a comprehensive
calibration procedure.
NOTE 5: Steps one and two may be combined with the channel verification
procedure.
NOTE 6: The calibration must be performed for all frequencies of interest.
### B.2.3.1 Example Calibration Procedure
The calibration procedure outlined below is only one possibility based on a
concrete measurement set-up. Improvements can be made to minimize measurement
uncertainty.
##### Step 1 (see Figure B.2.3.1-1) {#step-1-see-figure-b.2.3.1-1 .H6}
1\. Place a vertical reference dipole in the centre of the chamber, connected
to a VNA port, with the other VNA port connected to the input of the channel
emulator unit.
2\. Configure the channel emulator for bypass mode (NOTE this might not be
available in all instruments)
3\. Measure the response of each path from each vertical polarization probe to
the reference antenna in the centre.
4\. Adjust the power on all vertical polarization branches of the channel
emulator so that the powers received at the centre are equal.
5\. Repeat the steps 1 to 4 with the magnetic loop and horizontally polarized
probes instead, and adjust the horizontal polarization branches of the channel
emulator.
NOTE: At this stage all vertical polarization paths have equalized gains, and
so do all horizontal polarization paths. The two polarizations however do not
necessarily produce the same signal strength in the centre of the chamber --
this most commonly happens if two physically different channel emulators are
used for the two polarizations. The resulting power imbalance can be accounted
for either at this step or adjusted at point 7 of step 2.

Figure B.2.3.1-1: Setup for VNA measurements
##### Step 2 (see Figure B.2.3.1-2) {#step-2-see-figure-b.2.3.1-2 .H6}
1\. Place a vertical reference dipole in the centre of the chamber connected
to a spectrum analyzer via an RF cable. NOTE: A power meter can also be used.
2\. Record the cable and reference dipole gains.
3\. Load the target channel model
4\. Start the LTE signalling in the base station emulator with the required
parameter identical to the measurements conditions (some special instrument
options might be necessary).
5\. Average the power received by the spectrum analyzer for a sufficient
amount of time to account for the fading channel -- one full channel
simulation might be unnecessary.
6\. Repeat steps 1 to 4 with a magnetic loop for the horizontal polarization
(NOTE: this way no prior validation of the channel model is required)
7\. Calculate the total power received at the test area as the sum of the
power in the two polarizations.
8\. Adjust the power in the two polarizations if necessary. The power
adjustment can be a simple scaling of the power up or down or adjustment of
the XPR due to slight differences in the fading unit\'s branches. Depending on
the adjustment needed, it can be done at the base station emulator or the
channel emulator or both.

## B.2.4 Calibration procedure for RTS method
For the RTS method, only the DUT reporting RSAP calibration is to perform. The
RTS method depends on reported RSAP to do the antenna pattern measurement, and
the power calibration for radiated second-stage throughput test. Since these
reported readings do not come from a calibrated measurement instrument, their
accuracies are often subject to questioning. Below procedure provides method
for proper calibration to validate the reported RSAP accuracy.
\- DUT reporting RSAP calibration:
With proper spherical coordinate definition of mobile terminal setup, the
receive antenna pattern at any coordinate (θi, ϕi) can be expressed as:
P(θi, ϕi)= RSi (1)
The test point (θi, ϕi) can be at any point on the 4π solid angle of the
coordinate. More precisely, the reported RS of the UE can be expressed as:
RSi (x)= m(x)*x+c (2)
where m(x~i~) and c is a function of signal strength independent of testing
point angular coordinates. x is the actual incident field power density that
can be derived from the signal power and test range loss. The above equation
(2) assumes that the signal variables in both sides of the equation are
expressed in decibels or dB. When m(x)=1 and c=g~0~, where g~0~ is the
received antenna gain at the test point, we would have declared that the RS
report is a true reading of the signal strength. But in reality, m(x) can be
biased by either the signal level relative to the receiver\'s detector
operating condition, or by application software programming errors. Meanwhile,
the offset constant c can also be biased by either the noise floor of the
receiver and/or other artificial factors in the UE RS reporting. Therefore, a
Taylor\'s series can be introduced to have a better representation of the RS
report value:
RSi (x)= c +ax+ bx^2^ +dx^3^ + ex^4^ + .... (3)
In theory, equation (3) may require many terms to represent the RS report
accurately. However, since the reported RS reading in the receive antenna
pattern in (1) has a limited signal dynamic range, the following three term
expression is enough to correct for the reporting errors:
RSi (x)= c +ax+ bx^2^ +o(x^3^) (4)
The third order term o(x^3^) is ignored since it is not significant for
limited signal dynamic range.
The RS pattern in (1) will need to be calibrated for its possible reporting
errors. One practical method is to introduce signal correction terms in
equation (4) to enhance the accuracy. This process is also referred to as the
linearization. The following steps describe what is needed to linearize the RS
report and the RS antenna pattern in (1):
1\. Find the maximum RS reading in the pattern obtained in (1) from all
angular test points, and at all polarizations. Set this point as the reference
point and record signal generator power P~0~ and let x~0~ =P~0~-Test Range
Path Loss (in dB), and note the maximum RS reading as r~0~.
2\. At the reference test point, decrease the signal generator\'s output power
P~i~, and let x~i~ = P~i~-Test Range Path Loss (in dB), starting from P~0~
with a step size (1.0 dB by default) to a power range so as to obtain the full
RS reading range while searching from the reference point r~0~ when the test
system dynamic range allows, or to 20 dB by default when the system dynamic
range is known to be limited, whichever is lower in range. Record the
corresponding RS reading of the UE as r~i~. Repeat this process until all
angular test points are completed as required.
3\. Use those pairs of data obtained in Step 2) (r~i~, x~i~) as the input of
the quadratic fitting curve in (4) to formulate the Algorithm LSF (Least
Square Fit) to calculate the three coefficients (a,b, and c) in:
Err(a,b,c)= Σ(c + ax~i~ + bx~i~ - r~i~)^2^ (5)
Please note that the power range of the linearization can be limited to 20 dB
as stated in Step 2) since the lower RS readings than the processed range do
not contribute to the overall receive antenna pattern as much.
Once the three coefficients (a,b, and c) are obtained in LSF of (5), the use
of the inverse function of Equation (4) to convert RS pattern in (1) into the
normalized incident power pattern. This process completes the error correction
for both constant biased and the non-linearity in the RS report from the UE
within the limited signal dynamic range as tested in (1) and Step 1. Similar
steps can be applied for error corrections if multiple receiver RS are
involved in the testing.
Of course, the reference test point can also be further tested for the
threshold of the receiver sensitivity and/or throughput knee-point for the
required calibrated reference power level.

###### ## Annex E (informative): Estimation of measurement uncertainty
# E.1 General
  1. Individual uncertainty contributions in the TRP and TRS measurements are discussed and evaluated in this Annex. A technique for calculating the total measurement uncertainty is also presented.
An important part of a standard measurement procedure is the identification of
uncertainty sources and the evaluation of the overall measurement uncertainty.
There are various individual uncertainty sources in the measurement procedure
that introduce a certain uncertainty contribution to the final measurement
result. The approach in this standard test procedure is that the test
laboratories are not limited to using some specific instruments and antenna
positioners, for example. However, a limit is set for the maximum overall
measurement uncertainty.
The TRP/TRS measurement procedure can be considered to include two stages. In
Stage 1 the actual measurement of the 3-D pattern of the Device Under Test
(DUT) is performed. In Stage 2 the calibration of the absolute level of the
DUT measurement results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna
whose absolute gain/radiation efficiency is known at the frequencies of
interest. The uncertainty contributions related to TRP are listed in Tables
E.1-1 and E.1-2 and the contributions related to TRS are in Tables E.1-3 and
E.1-4. The uncertainty contributions are analyzed in the following paragraphs.
The calculation of the uncertainty contribution is based on the ISO Guide to
the expression of uncertainty in measurement. Each individual uncertainty is
expressed by its Standard Deviation (termed here as 'standard uncertainty')
and represented by symbol U. The uncertainty contributions can be classified
to two categories: Type-A uncertainties, which are statistically determined
e.g. by repeated measurements, and Type-B uncertainties, which are derived
from existing data e.g. data sheets. Several individual uncertainties are
common in Stage 1 and Stage 2 and therefore cancel.
The procedure of forming the uncertainty budget in TRP measurement is:
    1. 1) Compile lists of individual uncertainty contributions for > TRP measurement in both Stage 1 and Stage 2.
> 2) Determine the standard uncertainty of each contribution by
>
> a) Determining the distribution of the uncertainty (Gaussian, U-shaped,
> rectangular, etc.)
>
> b) Determining the maximum value of each uncertainty (unless the
> distributions is Gaussian)
>
> c) Calculating the standard uncertainty by dividing the uncertainty by
> {width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} if the
> distribution is U-shaped, and by {width="0.25in" height="0.25in"} if the
> distribution is rectangular.
>
> 3) Convert the units into decibel, if necessary.
>
> 4) Combine all the standard uncertainties by the Root of the Sum of the
> Squares (RSS) method.
>
> 5) Combine the total uncertainties in Stage 1 and Stage 2 also by the RSS
> method: {width="2.5833333333333335in" height="0.2916666666666667in"}.
>
> 6) Multiply the result by an expansion factor of 1.96 to derive expanded
> uncertainty at 95% confidence level: 1.96 * {width="0.18055555555555555in"
> height="0.20833333333333334in"}.
Example uncertainty budgets are presented in Tables E.29-1, E.29-2, E.29-3,
E.29-4, E.29-5, E.29-6, E.29-7, E.29-8, E.29.9, and E.29-10.

# E.2 Mismatch uncertainty between measurement receiver and the probe antenna
If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the probe
antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and determined by the following method.
In a measurement configuration, when two elements (devices, networks...) are
connected, if the matching is not ideal, there is an uncertainty in the RF
level signal passing through the connection. The magnitude of the uncertainty
depends on the VSWR at the junction of the two connectors. In practical
measurement system there are probably several connections in a test set-up,
they will all interact and contribute to the combined mismatch uncertainty.
The total combined mismatch uncertainty is composed of 2 parts:
1) The mismatch through the connector between two elements
2) The mismatch due to the interaction between two elements
## E.2.1 Total combined mismatch uncertainty calculations
### E.2.1.1 Mismatch uncertainty through the connector between two elements
Hereunder, a measurement configuration:
{width="5.290972222222222in" height="0.5097222222222222in"}
Figure E.2.1.1-1: Mismatch uncertainty through the connector
Г ~MR~ is the complex reflection coefficient of the Measurement Receiver
Г ~cable4~ is the complex reflection coefficient of the cable4
S~21~ is the forward gain in the network between the two reflection
coefficients of interest
S~12~ is the backward gain in the network between the two reflection
coefficients of interest
Note that S~21~ and S~12~ are set to1 if the two parts are directly connected.
The uncertainty limits of the mismatch are calculated by means of the
following formula table 1 of [26]:
Mismatch limits(% voltage) =$\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times
\left| S_{\text{12}} \right| \times \text{100}$
These mismatch limits are divided by $\sqrt{2}$ because of the U-shaped (table
1 of) [26] distribution of the mismatch uncertainty and give the following
standard uncertainty:
U~mismatch~ (% voltage) = $\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times
\left| \Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right|
\times \left| S_{\text{12}} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2}}$
To convert this standard uncertainty in dB, we divide it by the standard
uncertainty conversion factor (table 1 of) [26]:
U~mismatch~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times
\left| S_{\text{12}} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
### E.2.1.2 Mismatch uncertainty due to the interaction of several elements
Previously, we presented how to determine the mismatch uncertainty between two
elements through the junction (connector). Now, we introduce the other type of
mismatch uncertainty, which is a result of the interaction between several
elements.
Hereunder, a measurement configuration:
{width="6.065277777777778in" height="0.7493055555555556in"}
Figure E.2.1.2-1: Mismatch uncertainty due to the interaction of several
elements
Firstly, we determine the mismatch uncertainty between junctions of the
elements:
Between the MR and the cable3:
U~mismatch1~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}3} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times
\left| S_{\text{12}} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
Between the cable3 and the cable4:
U~mismatch2~(dB) = $\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{cable}3} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times
\left| S_{\text{12}} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
\|S~21~\| and \|S~12~\| are set to 1 because there is no element between
cable3 and cable 4.
U~mismatch1~(dB) = $\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}3} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
U~mismatch2~(dB) = $\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{cable}3} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
Each mismatch uncertainty due to the interaction between the measurement
receiver and the cable4 is determined by means of the following formula (table
1 of) [26]:
_U~mismatch_interaction1~_(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right|
\times \left| \Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left|
S_{\text{21}\text{Cable}3} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{12}\text{Cable}3}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
\|S~21~\| and \|S~12~\| are equal and correspond to the cable3 attenuation.
U~mismatch_interaction1~(dB) = $\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times
\left| \Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}\text{Cable}3}
\right|^{2} \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
We consider in the general case, the following measurement configuration:
{width="6.303472222222222in" height="0.7395833333333334in"}
Figure E.2.1.2-2: Mismatch uncertainty measurement configuration
In the general case, this uncertainty contribution can be calculated by:
U~mismatch_interaction_N~(dB)=$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times
\left| \Gamma_{\text{antenna}} \right| \times \left|
S_{\text{21}\text{cable}1} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{12}\text{cable}1}
\right| \times \text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.} \times \left|
S_{\text{21}\text{cableN}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{12}\text{cableN}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
\|S~21~\|=\|S~12~\| for passive elements (cables...)
U~mismatch_interaction_N~(dB)=$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times
\left| \Gamma_{\text{antenna}} \right| \times \left|
S_{\text{21}\text{cable}1} \right|^{2} \times
\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.} \times \left|
S_{\text{21}\text{cableN}} \right|^{2} \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
## E.2.2 Total combined mismatch uncertainty
The two kinds of mismatch uncertainty contributions are combined by the root-
sum-squares (RSS) method to derive [the total combined mismatch
uncertainty]{.underline}.
The total combined mismatch uncertainty is equal to:
$\sqrt{U_{\text{mismatch}1(\text{dB})} + \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} +
U_{\text{mismatchN}(\text{dB})} +
U_{\text{mismatch}_{\text{interaction}}1(\text{dB})} +
\text{.}\text{.}\text{.} +
U_{\text{mismatch}_{\text{interaction}}N(\text{dB})}}$
This formula shows that the uncertainty is frequency dependent by the way of
the forward and the backward gains in the network between the two components.
The uncertainty upon \|S~21~\| and \|S~12~\| increases with frequency. One can
therefore expect for the UMTS band a higher mismatch uncertainty value than in
the GSM and DCS bands.
Note that for an anechoic chamber, horn antennas are usually used as probe
antennas. There are two kinds of horn antennas: single-polarized and dual-
polarized. With the second one, it is possible to measure the co-polarized and
cross-polarized signals without any movement of the probe, which reduces the
cable antenna uncertainty contribution and improves the measurement stability.
To conduct the signals to the measurement receiver, the measurement system
configuration using a dual-polarized horn antenna has to be completed with an
RF Relay. This device will include new mismatch uncertainty contributions,
which have to be determined with the previously presented calculation methods,
completed by the RF relay parameters contributions, and described in the
following.
# E.3 Mismatch uncertainty of the RF relay
If the same receiver chain configuration (including the measurement receiver;
the probe antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty
is considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and determined by the following method.
The following figure describes the RF Relay with its \'S\' parameters and the
complex reflection coefficient of the inputs and output:
{width="5.156944444444444in" height="3.5833333333333335in"}
Figure E.3-1: Mismatch uncertainty of the RF relay
The RF relay is used to switchover the cross and direct polarization signals
from the probe antenna. To determine RF Relay mismatch uncertainty
contributions, reflection coefficients for each port and the cross talk
attenuation have to be known.
The total combined mismatch uncertainty is composed of two parts:
1) The mismatch uncertainty contributions when the RF Relay switches on the
direct polarization signal
2) The mismatch uncertainty contributions when the RF Relay switches on the
cross polarization signal
Each part is composed of two types of uncertainties introduced in the previous
paragraph: the mismatch through the connector between two elements and the
mismatch due to the interaction between several elements.
## E.3.1 First part: RF Relay switched on the co-polarized signal
### E.3.1.1 The mismatch through the connector between two elements
Between the Input1 and the port1:
U~mismatch1~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{1} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{11}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
Between the port3 and the Output:
U~mismatch2~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{3} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{33}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
Between the Input2 and the port2:
The RF Relay switchovers on the direct polarization signal. As a result, there
is no mismatch uncertainty contribution.
### E.3.1.2 Mismatch due to the interaction between two elements or more
Between the Input1 and the Output:
U~interaction1~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{1} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{3}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{31}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{13}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
Between the Input1 and the Input2:
U~interaction2~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{1} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{2}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{12}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
The RF Relay switchovers on the cross polarization signal. As a result; this
uncertainty contribution is usually disregarded because of the high crosstalk
attenuation which is characterized by $\left| S_{\text{21}} \right|$ and
$\left| S_{\text{12}} \right|$ \'S\' parameters. If the crosstalk attenuation
is low, this uncertainty contribution has to be considered.
Between the Input2 and the Output:
U~interaction3~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{2} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{3}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{23}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{32}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
The RF Relay switchovers on the cross polarization signal. As a result; this
uncertainty contribution is usually disregarded because of the high cross-talk
attenuation, which is characterized by $\left| S_{\text{23}} \right|$ and
$\left| S_{\text{32}} \right|$ \'S\' parameters. If the crosstalk attenuation
is low, this uncertainty contribution has to be considered.
## E.3.2 Second part: RF relay switched on the cross-polarized signal
### E.3.2.1 The mismatch through the connector between two elements
Between the Input1 and the port1:
The RF Relay switchovers on the direct polarization signal. As a result, there
is no mismatch uncertainty contribution.
Between the port3 and the Output:
U~mismatch3~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{3} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{33}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
Between the Input2 and the port2:
U~mismatch4~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{2} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{22}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
### E.3.2.2 Mismatch due to the interaction between two elements or more
Between the Input1 and the Output:
U~interaction4~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{1} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{3}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{31}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{13}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
The RF Relay switchovers on the cross polarization signal. As a result; this
uncertainty contribution is usually disregarded because of the high crosstalk
attenuation which is characterized by $\left| S_{\text{31}} \right|$ and
$\left| S_{\text{13}} \right|$ \'S\' parameters. If the crosstalk attenuation
is low, this uncertainty contribution has to be considered.
Between the Input1 and the Input2:
U~interaction5~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{1} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{2}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{12}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
The RF Relay switchovers on the cross polarization signal. As a result; this
uncertainty contribution is usually disregarded because of the high crosstalk
attenuation which is characterized by $\left| S_{\text{21}} \right|$ and
$\left| S_{\text{12}} \right|$ \'S\' parameters. If the crosstalk attenuation
is low, this uncertainty contribution has to be considered.
Between the Input2 and the Output:
U~interaction6~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{2} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{3}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{23}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{32}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
## E.3.3 Total combined mismatch uncertainty
Each non-zero mismatch uncertainty contribution from both parts (RF Relay
switched on the cross and direct polarization signal) are combined by the
root-sum-squares (RSS) method to derive [the total combined mismatch
uncertainty]{.underline}.
The total combined mismatch uncertainty is equal to: [ ]{.underline}
$\sqrt{U_{\text{mismatch}1(\text{dB})} + \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} +
U_{\text{mismatchN}(\text{dB})} +
U_{\text{mismatch}\text{_int}\text{eraction}1(\text{dB})} +
\text{.}\text{.}\text{.} +
U_{\text{mismatch}\text{_int}\text{eractionN}(\text{dB})}}$
If a RF Relay is used to drive the cross and direct polarization signals from
the dual-polarized antenna, this total combined mismatch uncertainty has to be
added with all the uncertainty measurement contributions for the total
combined measurement uncertainty.
# E.4 Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable
If the probe antenna cable does not move between the calibration and the DUT
measurement stage, the uncertainty due to the insertion loss of the cable is
assumed to be systematic. Moreover, this uncertainty is common and constant in
both stages and that is why this leads to 0.00dB value.
If a different cable is used in the calibration measurement and in the DUT
measurement, and the difference of the insertion loss is used in the
calculations, then the overall combined standard uncertainty of the insertion
loss measurement should be used in the uncertainty budget. The distribution of
this uncertainty is assumed to be rectangular, in which case the standard
uncertainty can be calculated as the maximum value/√3.
# E.5 Insertion loss of the probe antenna attenuator (if used)
See Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable
If the probe antenna attenuator is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
# E.6 Insertion loss of the RF relays (if used)
See Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable.
If the RF relay is used in both stages, the uncertainty is considered
systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
# E.7 Influence of the antenna cable
## E.7.1 Probe antenna cable
If the probe antenna is directional (i.e. peak gain >+5dBi e.g. horn, LPDA,
etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for both stages,
the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
In other cases a technical study should be done.
An ETSI technical report [25] (clause D.1.3.6) gives a discussion on the
results obtained by testing a vertically polarized biconical antenna over a
ground plane with differing RF cable configurations.
## E.7.2 Calibration antenna cable
If an efficiency calibration is performed, influence of the calibration
antenna feed cable can be assumed to be negligible, due to data averaging.
In the case of gain calibration, the influence of the calibration antenna feed
cable must be assessed by measurements. A gain calibration measurement is
repeated with a reasonably differing routing of the feed cable. Largest
difference between the results is entered to the uncertainty budget with a
rectangular distribution.
# E.8 Absolute gain of the probe antenna
The uncertainty appears in the both stages and it is thus considered
systematic and constant 0.00dB value.
# E.9 Measurement receiver: uncertainty of absolute level
The receiving device is used to measure the received signal level in TRP tests
either as an absolute level or as a relative level. Receiving device used is
typically a Base Station Simulator (BSS), spectrum analyzer (SA), or power
meter (PM). Generally there occurs an uncertainty contribution from limited
absolute level accuracy and non-linearity.
# E.10 Measurement distance
The uncertainty contribution from a finite measurement distance is estimated
in three parts.
## E.10.1 Offset of DUT phase centre from axis(es) of rotation
In all the measurements defined in this test procedure the DUT and phantom
combination is rotated about the ear reference point of SAM phantom, which is
also assumed to be the location of the phase centre in both angular directions
of the measurements.
For some turntables this may be practically impossible in which case a
measurement uncertainty contribution can arise because the phase centre will
rotate on a non-zero radius about the centre of rotation, thereby giving a
variable measurement distance. Data averaging process may lead to a partial
self-cancel of this uncertainty.
The following formula is used to estimate this uncertainty contribution in
stage 1:
U~phase_center_limits~ (dB) = $\text{10}\text{log}(d \pm \text{Δd})^{2} +
\text{10}\text{log}(d)^{2}$
If a gain calibration is performed in Stage 2, the uncertainty contribution of
calibration antenna\'s displacement is estimated with the previous formula.
Misalignment can be estimated with following formula,
U~misaligment~ (dB) = $\text{20}\text{log}\left( \text{cos}\theta \right)$,
where$\theta$ is the misalignment angle between the calibration antenna and
the probe antenna. The contribution shall be added to displacement error:
U~cal~ (dB) = $\sqrt{U_{\text{phase}_{\text{center}_{\Delta}}}^{2} +
U_{\text{misaligment}}^{2}}$
For an efficiency calibration with an omnidirectional calibration antenna, the
U~cal~ is calculated similarly as for gain calibration but the uncertainty may
be divided by factor 2. This is due to correcting impact of data averaging in
this type of calibration.
## E.10.2 Mutual coupling
In measurement of radio performances of UMTS mobile phones in speech mode, the
mutual coupling uncertainty for this frequency band is a 0.00dB value (see
annex A-2 in [27]).
The 0.00dB value can be extended for the GSM, DCS and PCS band frequencies.
## E.10.3 Phase curvature
This uncertainty originates from the finite far-field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the DUT. If the measurement distance is >
10λ, this error is assumed to be negligible. At 2 GHz λ is 0.15 m, thus 10λ is
1.5 m.
# E.11 Quality of quiet zone
The uncertainty contribution of the reflectivity level of the anechoic chamber
is determined from the average standard deviation of the electric field in the
quiet zone. By repeating a free space VSWR measurement in 15-degree grid in
elevation and azimuth, 264 standard deviation values in both polarizations are
determined. From these values average standard deviation of electric field in
the quiet zone can be calculated from the equation:
$\overline{S_{\text{freq}}} = \frac{\frac{\pi}{2\text{NM}}\sum_{n =
1}^{N}{\sum_{m = 1}^{M}{s_{n,m,\text{hor}}\text{sin}(\theta_{n})} +
\frac{\pi}{2\text{NM}}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}{\sum_{m =
1}^{M}{s_{n,m,\text{ver}}\text{sin}(\theta_{n})}}}}{2}$
Where
$N$ is number of angular intervals in elevation,
$M$is number of angular intervals in azimuth and
$\theta_{n}$ is elevation of single measurement$s_{n,m,\text{pol}}$.
If an efficiency calibration with omnidirectional calibration antenna is
performed, the effect of reflectivity level decreases in Stage 2 and
$\overline{S_{\text{freq}}}$may be divided by factor 2. This is due to
correcting impact of data averaging in this type of calibration. Efficiency
calibration done with sampling step ≤ 15°, can be considered to have at least
four independent samples.
It\'s likely that asymmetry of the field probe will have a very small impact
on this measurement uncertainty contributor; however, an upper bound to probe
symmetry should be considered.
# E.12 Tx-power drift of DUT
A single point power reference measurement in the beginning and at the end of
the measurement procedure is recommended to monitor the power drift of the
DUT. Based on TX-power drift measurements for typical 3G UE, an uncertainty of
0.2 dB shall be entered to uncertainty budget with a rectangular distribution.
If the drift measurement indicates larger drift, the actual drift shall be
included to uncertainty.
_In order to minimize Tx-power drift error it\'s recommended to interleave
sensitivity and power measurement of multiple channels. This spreads the
measurements over a longer period, which helps to average the drift of the TX-
power._
Typical TX-power drifts of 3G UE, measured in a single angular point, DUT
placed against phantom head are shown in Figure E.12-1.
{width="6.354166666666667in" height="3.40625in"}
Figure E.12-1: Output power variation of typical 3G UE during battery life
## E.13 Uncertainty related to the use of phantoms
### E.13.1 Uncertainty from using different types of SAM phantom
This uncertainty contribution originates from the fact that different
laboratories may use the two different versions of SAM head: the SAM head
phantom or the SAM phantom including the head and the shoulders. The standard
SAM head is the specified phantom. However, the use of the other type of SAM
is also allowed with the requirement that the resulting uncertainty
contribution is taken into account in the uncertainty budget.
### E.13.2 Simulated tissue liquid uncertainty
This uncertainty will occur, if the laboratory uses a liquid which has
dielectric parameters deviating more than ±15% of the target parameters.
### E.13.3 Uncertainty of dielectric properties and shape of the hand phantom
The hand phantom makes a contribution to OTA measurement uncertainty due to
the manufacturing tolerances of its dielectric properties and shape. The
dielectric properties on the surface of the hand may differ from those of its
interior, so both are included in the evaluation. The moulded exterior surface
of the hand shall be measured directly with an open-ended coaxial probe. The
interior hand material is evaluated indirectly, by substituting a cube-shaped
sample moulded from the same material and having some exterior surfaces
removed. Following procedure will be used to evaluate the dielectric
properties of the hand phantom;
1\. Each hand shall be manufactured together with a reference cube of the same
material. The sides of the reference cube shall be not less than 40 mm in
length.
2\. The moulded surface on three orthogonal sides of the cube shall be sliced
away to a depth of at least 3 mm, in order to expose interior material for
evaluation. The remaining three sides of the cube shall be left untreated.
3\. Relative permittivity and conductivity shall be measured at ten different
points on each of the three cut, exposed surfaces of the reference cube, and
the combined interior averages ({width="0.3958333333333333in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}, {width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}, 30 points) and standard deviations
({width="0.375in" height="0.1875in"},{width="0.3541666666666667in"

In case the hand phantoms are manufactured within CAD models, the tolerance is
2% and therefore the effects shape errors are negligible. If the tolerance is
larger, a numerical study must be conducted.
### E.13.4 Uncertainty from using different types of Laptop Ground Plane
phantom
This uncertainty contribution originates from the fact that different
laboratories may use different variations of Laptop Ground Plane phantom. The
standard Laptop Ground Plane is the specified phantom.
## E.14 Coarse sampling grid
Degreasing of sampling density to finite amount of samples affects the
measurement uncertainty by two different errors. First is due to inadequate
number of samples and second is a systematic discrimination approximation
error in TRP and TRS equations.
Figure E.14-1 shows simulated sampling grid errors for typical 3G UE.
Approximation error is not included. Simulations are based on thin plate
surface interpolation of real radiation patters, measured beside a phantom
head.
{width="5.502083333333333in" height="3.3777777777777778in"}
Figure E.14-1: Simulated TPR/TRS error as a function of sampling grid
The offset of systematic approximation error can be expressed by using formula
$\text{Offset} = \text{10} \cdot \text{log}\text{10}\left(
\frac{\pi}{2N}\sum_{n - 1}^{N}{\text{sin}\left( \theta_{n} \right)} \right)$.
where
$N$ is number of angular intervals in elevation,
$\theta_{n}$ is elevation.
{width="5.502083333333333in" height="3.3680555555555554in"}
Figure E.14-2: Approximation error of TRP/TRS
The 10° or 15° sampling grid used in TRP measurements has been shown to
introduce only very small differences as compared to the results obtained with
denser grids, so with that sampling grid the uncertainty contribution can
assumed negligible.
When using sample step size of 15° - 30°, standard uncertainty of 0.15dB can
be assumed to cover errors. If step size >30° is used, larger uncertainty
should be considered.
NOTE: the simulation results presented here are not usable for irregular
sampling grids or in the case of MEG/MERS.
## E.15 Random uncertainty
The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous effects
which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of uncertainty with a
repeatability test by making a series of repeated measurement with a reference
DUT without changing anything in the measurement set-up.
The random uncertainty differs from one laboratory to another. Moreover, each
DUT has its own electromagnetic behaviour and random uncertainty. Some
uncertainty also occurs from the positioning of the DUT against the SAM
phantom, as the DUT cannot be attached exactly in the same way every time.
This uncertainty depends on how much the DUT\'s positioning against the SAM
phantom and hand phantoms varies from the specified testing positions. It is
noted that the uncertainty of the phone positioning depends on the phone
holder and the measurement operator and is in fact difficult to distinguish
from random uncertainty. Some uncertainty also occurs from the positioning of
the DUT plugged into the Laptop Ground Plane phantom, as the DUT may not be
plugged into the USB connector and positioned exactly in the same way every
time. This uncertainty depends on how much the DUT\'s position plugged into
the Laptop Ground Plane phantom varies from the specified plug-in position.
Therefore, the positioning uncertainty is included in random uncertainty.
To estimate this uncertainty for the SAM phantom, it is suggested to perform
at least five evaluations of TRP/TRS whereby the device shall be dismounted
and newly positioned with a fully charged battery before each tests. This
measurement set has to be carried out in mid channel of lowest and highest
frequency bands utilized by the testing lab, for at least three phones with
different type of mechanical design. The values have to be normalized by the
mean for each measurement set. As a result the uncertainty contribution
entered to uncertainty budget is the difference between the maximum and
minimum normalized value.
With head and hand phantoms, random uncertainty evaluation may be done
separately for each measurement configuration i.e. head only, browsing mode or
speech mode. A speech mode random uncertainty evaluation, were both head and
hand phantoms are used, can reasonably be considered to be the worst-case
scenario and thus random uncertainties in other configurations to be less.
To estimate this uncertainty for the Laptop Ground Plane phantom, it is
suggested to perform at least five evaluations of TRP/TRS for the plug-in
position whereby the device shall be dismounted and newly positioned before
each tests. This measurement set has to be carried out in mid channel of
lowest and highest frequency bands utilized by the testing lab, for at least
three USBs with different type of mechanical design. The values have to be
normalized by the mean for each measurement set. As a result the uncertainty
contribution entered to uncertainty budget is the difference between the
maximum and minimum normalized value.
## E.16 Uncertainty of network analyzer
This uncertainty includes the all uncertainties involved in the S21
measurement with a network analyzer, and will be calculated from the
manufacturer\'s data in logs with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise
informed, (see clause 5.1.2 in [26]).
## E.17 Uncertainty of the gain/efficiency of the calibration antenna
The calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the
gain/efficiency uncertainty has to be taken into account.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs with
a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed (see clause 5.1.2 in
[26]).
If the manufacturer\'s data do not give the information, the value has to be
checked, see annex A-12 in [27].
## E.18 Base station simulator: uncertainty of the absolute level
The transmitter device (typically a BS Simulator) is used to drive a signal to
the horn antenna in sensitivity tests either as an absolute level or as a
relative level. Receiving device used is typically a UE/MS. Generally there
occurs uncertainty contribution from limited absolute level accuracy and non-
linearity of the BS Simulator.
For practical reasons, the calibration measurement (Stage 2) should be only
performed with the probe antenna as a receiver. Hence, the uncertainty on the
absolute level of the transmitter device cannot be assumed as systematic. This
uncertainty should be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs with a
rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed (see clause 5.1.2 in
[26]). Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity of the device is
included in the absolute level uncertainty.
## E.19 BER measurement: output level step resolution
When output power of the BS simulator is swept to reach the BER target, used
power step resolution creates this uncertainty. Output power step used in the
BER measurement is divided by factor 2 to obtain the uncertainty with
rectangular distribution.
## E.20 Statistical uncertainty of the BER measurement
To study statistical uncertainty of BER measurement, see ETSI document TR 100
028-1, section 6.6 [25]. For a BER target of 1%±0.2% using 20000 bits,
uncertainty of 0.19 dB for a single measurement can be used. Using a BER
target of 10%±2% with 20000 tested bits will lead to uncertainty of
0.46dB/single measurement.
For a full TRS measurement with a regular sampling grid, the statistical
uncertainty can be approximated by using the following formula:
$U_{\text{fullTRS}} = \frac{U_{\text{SingleTRS}}}{\sqrt{N/4}}$,
Where
$U_{\text{SingleTRS}}$ is the statistical uncertainty of single measurement,
$N$ is the number of measurements.
## E.21 BER data rate normalization uncertainty
This uncertainty occurs only when a higher data rate than 12.2kbps is used to
speed up TRS measurement. It can be calculated using following formula:
$U_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\sqrt{\left( \frac{U_{\text{SingleTRSref}}}{2}
\right)^{2} + \left( \frac{U_{\text{SingleTRSfast}}}{2}
\right)^{2}}}{\sqrt{N_{\text{ref}}}}$ ,
Where
$U_{\text{SingleTRSref}}$ is the statistical uncertainty of the used reference
measurement,
$U_{\text{SingleTRSfast}}$is the statistical uncertainty of the higher data
rate measurement,
$N_{\text{ref}}$Is the number of measured reference points.
## E.22 DUT sensitivity drift
Due to statistical uncertainty of BER measurement, drift in the TRS cannot be
monitored similarly to TRP. An uncertainty value of 0.2dB can be used, or the
TRS drift should be measured, with a setup corresponding to the actual TRS
measurement.
## E.23 Cable loss measurement uncertainty
Before performing the calibration, cable losses have to be measured. This
measurement includes a standard uncertainty, which is composed of the
mismatch, and the insertion loss uncertainties. In the calibration
measurement, the transmitter part is composed with the calibration antenna,
cables, and signal generator. The receiver part is composed with the probe
antenna, cables, and measurement device.
The cable loss of transmitter and receiver parts should be measured
separately. By this way, the cable losses will be compliant with the cable
routing of the calibration stage. On the opposite, if the cable losses were
measured together at the same time, the measured values would include errors
from miscellaneous mismatch contributions, which do not appear in the cable
routing of the calibration stage.
The cable loss measurement uncertainty is the result of the RSS of the
uncertainty contributions listed in Table E.23-1.
Table E.23-1: Uncertainty contributions in the cable loss measurement
* * *
Description of uncertainty contribution Standard Uncertainty (dB) Mismatch
uncertainty of cable(s) receiver part  
Insertion loss of the cable(s) receiver part  
Measurement device: absolute level uncertainty  
Measurement device: linearity  
Mismatch uncertainty of cable(s) transmitter part  
Insertion loss of the cable(s) transmitter part  
Signal generator: absolute output level uncertainty  
Signal generator: output level stability uncertainty  
Cable loss measurement uncertainty (RSS)
* * *
## E.24 Signal generator: uncertainty of the absolute output level
The signal generator is only used at this stage. It substitutes the DUT by
feeding the calibration antenna with a known power level. The use of this
signal generator introduces an uncertainty on the absolute output level.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs with
a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [26]).
## E.25 Signal generator: output level stability
The uncertainty on the output level stability has to be taken into account
only when the uncertainty of the absolute level is not considered.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs with
a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [26]).
## E.26 Insertion loss: calibration antenna feed cable
The feed cable of the calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. As a
result, this uncertainty has to be taken into account.
This uncertainty will be measured or calculated from the manufacturer\'s data
in logs with a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [26]).
## E.27 Insertion loss: calibration antenna attenuator (if used)
If a calibration antenna attenuator is used, it only appears in Stage 2. As a
result, this uncertainty has to be taken into account.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs with
a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [26]).
## E.28 Chamber Statistical Ripple and Repeatability
The uncertainty due to chamber statistics is determined by repeated
calibration measurements as described in Annex G. This uncertainty
contribution is a composite value consisting of most of the specific
reverberation chamber contributions, such as limited number of modes and mode-
stirring techniques.
The uncertainty contribution value shall be determined by measurements as
described in Annex G and be assumed to have a normal distribution.
## E.29 Additional Power Loss in EUT Chassis
When the EUT is small and do not add noticeable loss to the chamber, the
calibration procedure outlined in clause x.x, is performed without the EUT
present in the chamber. The possible difference in average chamber
transmission level between the EUT measurement and the reference measurement
must in this case be considered in the uncertainty evaluation.
The uncertainty value for this contribution can be tested empirically by
choosing a unit within a set of samples which is considered to incur the
highest amount of loss (normally the largest unit), and measure the average
transmission loss in the chamber with and without the test unit present in the
chamber. The difference between the two cases shall be used in the uncertainty
calculation and the distribution should be assumed to be rectangular.
Alternatively, a fixed value of 0.2 dB with a rectangular distribution can be
used in the uncertainty calculations.

## F.1 General
  1. The Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) is used for radiated performance measurements. The absorption of electromagnetic energy by the human muscle or brain tissue is simulated by measuring the electrical field inside a SAM phantom filled with a liquid having the same electrical properties as human tissue. Tables F.1-1 and F.1-2 are proposals for two different recipes of the liquid to be used inside the SAM phantom.

###### ## Annex G (informative): Anechoic chamber specification and validation
method
## G.1 Shielded anechoic chamber specifications
To avoid environmental perturbations the measurements shall be performed in a
shielded enclosure, preserved from electromagnetic disturbances coming from
electromagnetic environment (Radio and TV broadcast, cellular, ISM equipment,
etc...). The shielding effectiveness shut be tested according to the EN 50
147-1 standard in the frequency range of 800 MHz up to 4 GHz.
The recommended level of the shielding effectiveness is -100 dB from 800 MHz
to 4 GHz.
Testing of the shielding effectiveness can be performed either before or after
the installation of absorbers.
## G.2 Quiet zone reflectivity level validation
The performance of anechoic chamber is typically evaluated from reflectivity
level $R_{\text{level}}$ in the quiet zone. The reflectivity level is defined
as power ratio of [all]{.underline} summed reflected signals $P_{r}$ to direct
signal $P_{d}$ from antenna:
$R_{\text{level}} = \text{10}\text{log}\frac{P_{r}}{P_{d}}$ .
To evaluate the quiet zone reflectivity level, the contribution of absorbing
materials, the antenna positioning system and other constructions in the
anechoic chamber should be measured.
To measure accurately quality of the quite zone in anechoic chamber an omni-
directional antenna shall be used. Near omni-directional three axes field-
probes are available with fibre optic connection thus minimizing cable
effects. Because sensitivity of field probe is limited it shall be carefully
checked that the field probe is operated at least 6dB above the noise floor of
the probe.
NOTE: The quiet zone evaluation should be performed with the antenna
positioning system in its place, in order to include its effect on the
reflectivity level.
### G.2.1 Description of a practical method for Quiet Zone characterization
A practical version of the Free Space VSWR method is presented.
In the Free Space VSWR method the quality of quite zone is measured from
amplitude ripple caused by reflections inside the anechoic chamber. Phase
variation of the direct signal and the reflected signals is obtained by moving
a field-probe in the quiet zone. Amplitude ripple in the quiet zone is caused
by this phase variation of reflected signals and the direct signal from
antenna. Figure 2 below shows seven measuring positions.
{width="5.0625in" height="2.28125in"}
Figure G.2.1-1: Measurement positions with 150mm separation
In each of the seven-measurement position amplitude of power received by
field-probe $P_{\text{meas}_{n}}$[dBm] is measured where $n$is index of
measuring position. Variance of measurement distance to the antenna from
field-probe in different measurement positions can be compensated by following
equation:
where,
$d_{n}$is distance to point $n$ from the antenna,
$l$is distance to centre of quiet zone from the antenna
$P_{\text{meas}_{n}}$is uncorrected measurement value from point $n$.
The sample standard deviation of the electric field in the quiet zone can be
calculated from these distance corrected values or directly from the measured
values with the following equation:
where,
$N$ is number of measurements positions
$\overline{P}$ is dB average of all $P_{n}$
$P_{i}$ is $P_{n}$ or $P_{\text{meas}_{n}}$
## G.3 Standard deviation of electric field
To obtain a more accurate picture of quality of quiet zone, the measurement
described in G.2.1 can be done from multiple directions and polarizations.
Doing free space VSWR measurement from different directions in 15-degree
separation for elevation and azimuth, results in 264 standard deviation values
in both polarizations ($s_{\theta,\Phi,\text{pol}}$). From these values
average sample standard deviation in electric field in quiet zone can be
calculated from equation:
where,
$I$ is number of angular intervals in elevation,
$J$ is number of angular intervals in azimuth and
$\Theta_{i}$ is elevation of measurement $s_{i,j,\text{pol}}$.
This quiet zone quality measurement should be done at all the frequencies used
in measurements. It can also be sufficient on all the centre frequencies in
the measurement bands but also in this case the Tx and Rx shall be measured
separately.
###### ## Annex H (informative): Reverberation chamber specifications and
validation method
## H.1 Shielded reverberation chamber specifications
  1. Before measuring the test site characteristics in terms of stirring effectiveness, the shielding effectiveness of the metallic enclosure must be measured.
To avoid environmental perturbations, the measurements shall be performed in a
shielded enclosure, preserved from electromagnetic disturbances coming from
electromagnetic environment such as: TV broadcast, radio, cellular, ISM
equipment, to name a few. The shielding effectiveness recommended to be tested
according to the EN 50 147-1 standard in the frequency range of 800 MHz up to
4 GHz.
The recommended level of the shielding effectiveness is -100 dB from 800 MHz
to 4 GHz.
## H.2 Reverberation chamber statistical ripple and repeatability validation
  1. The reverberation chamber is typically evaluated according to its isotropy level and ability to produce independent samples. The uncertainty due to chamber statistics is determined by repeated calibration measurements as described in Annex B.2.2. This uncertainty contribution is a composite value consisting of most of the specific reverberation chamber contributions, such as limited number of modes, polarization imbalance and mode-stirring techniques.
The uncertainty contribution value shall be determined by repeated calibration
measurements for nine different positions and orientations of the calibration
antenna in order to determine the statistical variation as a function of
frequency, or at least at the frequencies where the chamber shall be used.
This uncertainty contribution value can be assumed to have a normal
distribution.
The uncertainty will depend on chamber size, frequency, stirrer sequence,
stirrer types and shapes, polarization stirring (if any), and the degree of
chamber loading. All these factors must remain the same for all of the nine
calibration measurements. The uncertainty will also depend on frequency
stirring bandwidth (if any), but the effects of different amounts of frequency
stirring can be studied with the same sets of calibration data as when no
frequency stirring is applied.
The nine net average power transfer functions of all or some of the nine
calibration configurations for each loading case shall be averaged to provide
a good reference level. Frequency stirring can only be applied to improve the
reference level. Therefore, the uncertainty shall be found by computing the
average and standard deviation of the net average power transfer function of
each of the nine reference (antenna) positions and orientations (without
frequency stirring) around the reference level (which can be frequency stirred
if it gives better overall accuracy).
The data obtained during these reference measurements can be used for analysis
of the chamber's systematic and deterministic contribution to S21. Such
analysis can help determine possible uncertainty sources in chambers where the
"chamber statistics" portion of the uncertainty analysis is too high to fulfil
the total uncertainty criterion. The normalized standard deviation is
calculated using the following expression:
where,
is the standard deviation of the power transfer function over T different
calibration antenna positions. $P_{\text{ref},t}$ is the reference power
transfer function for position _t_ of the calibration antenna. The power
transfer function for every calibration antenna position is further the
average over the power transfer function $P_{\text{ref},t,n}$ for each fixed
measurement antenna in the chamber defined in Annex B.2.2. Thus,
where,
_N_ is the total number of fixed measurement antennas. Moreover,
is the average power transfer function over the _T_ calibration antenna
positions.

## I.1 General
This annex introduces the concept of recommended OTA performance for operating
bands for handheld UE's. This requirement is not mandatory but is recommended.
The concept of recommended performance is to ensure that UE OTA performance is
maximised in order to improve user experience and network performance. It is
recognised that the ability to meet the recommended performance depends on the
number of frequency bands supported by the UE.
## I.2 Total Radiated Power
The OTA TRP performance for UTRA and E-UTRA should be greater or equal than
the recommended values in this clause.

The concept of recommended performance is to ensure that UE OTA performance is
maximised in order to improve user experience and network performance. It is
recognised that the ability to meet the recommended performance depends on the
number of frequency bands supported by the UE.

NOTE: TRS minimum performance requirements in Table K.3.1-1 apply to HSPA and
LTE UEs supporting only single carrier operation. Their applicability to
multi-carrier operation is FFS. This is because it has not been verified
whether the UEs measured to derive the requirements supported carrier
aggregation or not.

###### ## Annex M (normative): Channel Model emulation of the Base Station
antenna pattern configuration for Radiated Performance of Multiple-antenna
Receivers
# M.1 Channel Model(s)
The following channel models are used in evaluation of MIMO OTA methodologies.
The generic models are
\- SCME Urban micro-cell, and
In addition, the BS antenna assumptions defined in Annex M.2 also apply when
emulating the channel models.
In the following we define the cross polarization power ratio a propagation
channel as $\text{XPR} = \text{XPR}_{V} = \text{XPR}_{H}$, where
$\text{XPR}_{V} = \frac{S_{\text{VV}}}{S_{\text{HV}}}$ and $\text{XPR}_{H} =
\frac{S_{\text{HH}}}{S_{\text{VH}}}$
and
\- S~VV~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on V-polarization
and incident power on V-polarization;
\- S~VH~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on V-polarization
and incident power on H-polarization;
\- S~HV~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on H-polarization
and incident power on V-polarization;
\- S~HH~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on H-polarization
and incident power on H-polarization.
NOTE: For Vertical only measurements, the powers per delay are used without
regard to the specified XPR values.
The following SCME Urban Micro-cell is unchanged from the original SCME paper,
with added XPR values, Direction of Travel, and Velocity.

The parameters of the channel models are the expected parameters for the MIMO
OTA channel models.\ However, the final channel model achieved for different
methods could be a combined effect of the chamber and the channel emulator.
The Rayleigh fading may be implementation specific. However, the fading can be
considered to be appropriate as long as the statistics of the generated
Rayleigh fading are within standard requirement on Rayleigh fading statistics.
# M.2 Base Station antenna pattern configuration
The emulated BS antennas to be used for all emulation of the channel models
defined in Annex M.1 shall be assumed to be dual polarized equal power
elements with a fixed 0λ separation, 45 degrees slanted.
The slant 45 degree antenna is an \"X\" configuration and is modelled as an
ideal dipole with isotropic gain and subject to a foreshortening of the
slanted radiating element, which is observed to vary as a function of the path
angle of departure. This foreshortening with AoD is a typical slanted dipole
behaviour and is a source of power variation in the channel model. The
effective antenna pattern for this antenna is illustrated in Figure M.2-1.

  1. Individual uncertainty contributions in the TRMS measurements are discussed and evaluated in this Annex. A technique for calculating the total measurement uncertainty is also presented.
An important part of a standard measurement procedure is the identification of
uncertainty sources and the evaluation of the overall measurement uncertainty.
There are various individual uncertainty sources in the measurement procedure
that introduce a certain uncertainty contribution to the final measurement
result. The approach in this standard test procedure is that the test
laboratories are not limited to using some specific instruments and antenna
positioners, for example. However, a limit is set for the maximum overall
measurement uncertainty.
The TRMS measurement procedure can be considered to include two stages. In
Stage 1 the actual measurement of the MIMO OTA throughput of the Device Under
Test (DUT) is performed. In Stage 2 the calibration of the absolute level of
the DUT measurement results is performed.
The uncertainty contributions related to TRMS are listed in Tables N.1-1. The
uncertainty contributions are analysed in the following paragraphs.
The calculation of the uncertainty contribution is based on the ISO Guide to
the expression of uncertainty in measurement. Each individual uncertainty is
expressed by its Standard Deviation (termed here as 'standard uncertainty')
and represented by symbol U. The uncertainty contributions can be classified
to two categories: Type-A uncertainties, which are statistically determined
e.g. by repeated measurements, and Type-B uncertainties, which are derived
from existing data e.g. data sheets. Several individual uncertainties are
common in Stage 1 and Stage 2 and therefore cancel.
The procedure of forming the uncertainty budget in measurement is:
    1. 1) Compile lists of individual uncertainty contributions for > measurements in both Stage 1 and Stage 2.
> 2) Determine the standard uncertainty of each contribution by
>
> a) Determining the distribution of the uncertainty (Gaussian, U-shaped,
> rectangular, etc.)
>
> b) Determining the maximum value of each uncertainty (unless the
> distributions is Gaussian)
>
> c) Calculating the standard uncertainty by dividing the uncertainty by
> {width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} if the
> distribution is U-shaped, and by {width="0.25in" height="0.25in"} if the
> distribution is rectangular.
>
> 3) Convert the units into decibel, if necessary.
>
> 4) Combine all the standard uncertainties by the Root of the Sum of the
> Squares (RSS) method.
>
> 5) Combine the total uncertainties in Stage 1 and Stage 2 also by the RSS
> method: {width="2.5833333333333335in" height="0.2916666666666667in"}.
6) Multiply the result by an expansion factor of 1.96 to derive expanded
uncertainty at 95% confidence level: 1.96 * {width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}.

NOTE 1: 0dB if fading for RTS is done in baseband; same as RC&CE and MPAC if
fading is not in baseband
NOTE 2: assumption is that MU set to 0dB with channel model validation
pass/fail limits (FFS) that have negligible impact on TP FOM; MU for channel
model validation is FFS
NOTE 3: Analysis of the element associated with stirring method and number of
subframes is based on existing harmonization test campaign data and can be
further augmented by additional measurements. The following combinations of
stirring modes and number of subframes have been identified as common use
cases with the following standard uncertainties (different combinations
require separate validation):
A: stepped stirring mode with 20k SF per stirring state: 0dB
B: stepped stirring mode with 400 SF per stirring state: 0.22dB
C: continuous stirring mode with 20k SF per sample: FFS
D: continuous stirring mode with 400 SF per sample: FFS
Until MU elements for continuous stirring modes have been defined, the test
plan shall only consider stepped stirring approach
NOTE 4: As the applicability of SIR to MIMO OTA performance evaluation is FFS,
the measurement uncertainty treatment for SIR related items will remain FFS.
When the applicability of SIR is confirmed, the measurement uncertainty
treatment defined in 3GPP TS 36.521-1 [11] Table F.1.4-1 for line item
8.2.1.3.1 should be considered along with the related test system constraints.
Any adjustments to the test system limits or uncertainty definitions necessary
for MIMO OTA performance testing should be applied.
# N.2 Fading channel emulator output uncertainty
In the case where a fading channel emulator is used, the outputs of the fading
channel emulator are used to drive signals through the amplifiers, if
necessary, to the probe antennas in the MIMO OTA tests either as an absolute
level or as a relative level. The receiving device used is a UE. Generally, an
uncertainty contribution comes from the absolute level accuracy, non-
linearity, and output signal stability of the fading channel emulator. All of
the contributions should be considered. However, the applicability of each
contribution is contingent on the specific measurement implementation and
calibration procedure.
This uncertainty should be determined from the manufacturer's data sheet
expressed in dB with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed
(see clause 5.1.2 in [33]). Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity
and the output signal stability of the device may be included in the absolute
level uncertainty. If not, the non-linearity, output signal stability and
output signal stability versus temperature should be determined from the
manufacturer's data sheet. Once determined, the non-linearity uncertainty and
the output signal stability uncertainties should be combined with the output
uncertainty using the RSS method.
# N.3 External Amplifiers Uncertainty Terms
Any components in the setup can potentially introduce measurement uncertainty.
It is then needed to determine the uncertainty contributors associated with
the use of such components. For the case of external amplifiers, the following
uncertainties should be considered but the applicability is contingent to the
measurement implementation and calibration procedure.
## N.3.1 Stability
An uncertainty contribution comes from the output level stability of the
amplifier. Even if the amplifier is part of the system for both measurement
and calibration, the uncertainty due to the stability shall be considered.
This uncertainty can be either measured or determined by the manufacturers'
data sheet for the operating conditions in which the system will be required
to operate.
## N.3.2 Linearity
An uncertainty contribution comes from the linearity of the amplifier since in
most cases calibration and measurements are performed at two different
input/output power levels. This uncertainty can be either measured or
determined by the manufacturers' data sheet.
## N.3.3 Noise Figure
When the signal goes into an amplifier, noise is added so that the SNR at the
output is reduced with regard to the SNR of the signal at the input. This
added noise introduces error on the signal which affects the Error Rate of the
receiver thus the EVM (Error Vector Magnitude). An uncertainty can be
calculated through the following formula:
{width="2.1041666666666665in" height="0.53125in"}
where SNR is the signal to noise ratio in dB at the signal level used during
the sensitivity measurement.
## N.3.4 Mismatch
If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and calibration
the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be considered systematic
and constant -> 0dB. If it is not the case, the mismatch uncertainty at its
input and output shall be either measured or determined by the method
described in [3].
## N.3.5 Gain
If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and calibration
the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be considered systematic
and constant -> 0dB. If it is not the case, this uncertainty shall be
considered.

###### ## Annex Q (informative): RTS Anechoic Chamber Specification and
Validation Method
## Q.1 RTS anechoic chamber specifications
The RTS Anechoic Chamber implementation is based on the full SCME
implementation described in TR 37.977 [29] clause 6.3.1.3 and would be
evaluated for shielding effectiveness in accordance with Annex G.1 and would
follow the recommendations in Annex A.3.5.
## Q.2 RTS anechoic chamber minimum distance between the DUT and the
measurement antenna
The RTS anechoic chamber minimum distance between the DUT and the measurement
antenna would follow the recommendations in Annex A.3.3.
## Q.3 RTS anechoic chamber quiet zone reflectivity level validation
The RTS anechoic chamber quiet zone relectivity level validation is performed
in accordance with Annex G.2 and Annex G.3 and would follow the
recommendations in Annex A.3.2 and Annex A.3.4.
## Q.4 RTS anechoic chamber channel model verification
The RTS anechoic chamber channel model verification is performed in accordance
with TR 37.977 [29] clause 8.3 for the channel model defined in clause 7.4.1.2
at the downlink centre frequency of the mid-channel defined in TS 36.508 [10]
for the operating bands defined in clause 7.4.1.2. The results are expected to
meet the recommended limits in TR 37.977 [29] clause 8.3.3.
###### ## Annex R: UE ATF Requirements
This annex defines the accuracy requirements for the RSAP and RSARP
measurements, these requirements are normative for devices using the RTS
method as defined in section 7.4.
It should be noted that the two-stage test method includes RSAP and RSARP
validation and if necessary linearization of the results prior to calibration
of the results against known radiated metrology standards, therefore the
requirement for RSAP and RSARP is that they are monotonic over a given range
and resolution. As a consequence their absolute accuracies are not relevant.
However, due to the similarity with RSRP, in order to guide RSAP
implementation, an upper bound limit on accuracy is defined for RSAP. Since
RSAP is measured in much easier conditions than RSRP, the RSRP absolute
requirement will not increase the demands on existing receiver designs.
## R.1 RSAP
The requirements for RSAP accuracy are given in Table R-1.
Table R-1: Reference Signal Antenna Power requirements
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | > **Parameter** | > **Value** | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | > **Absolute accuracy** | > ± 6 dB | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | > **Range** | > RSAP absolute accuracy and monotonicity | | | > to be maintained over the range -60 dBm | | | > to -80 dBm incident power measured at | | | > the orientation of the DUT's maximum | | | > antenna gain. | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | > **Monotonicity** | > Monotonicity over a 1 dB interval. This | | | > is necessary to enable linearization of | | | > the UE RSAP response as part of the | | | > accuracy requirements for the derived | | | > complex antenna pattern. | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
## R.2 RSARP
The requirements for RSARP accuracy are given in Table R-2.
Table R-2: Reference Signal Antenna Relative Phase requirements
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | > **Parameter** | > **Value** | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | > **Range** | > RSARP monotonicity to be maintained over the | | | > range -60 dBm to -80 dBm incident power | | | > measured at the orientation of the DUT's | | | > maximum antenna gain. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | > **Monotonicity** | > Monotonicity over a 5 degree interval. This | | | > is necessary to enable linearization of the | | | > UE RSARP response as part of the accuracy | | | > requirements for the derived complex antenna | | | > pattern. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
