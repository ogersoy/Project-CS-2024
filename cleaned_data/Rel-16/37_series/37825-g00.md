# 4 Background
## 4.1 Justification
In order to reduce the big imbalance between 5G NR uplink and downlink
coverage, RAN4 has completed PC2 HPUE feature to improve the uplink coverage
for 5G SA deployments on NR bands n41, n77, n78 and n79 in Rel-15 NR WI,
including PC2 UL MIMO (2Tx 23+23dBm) and PC2 1Tx (26dBm) UE. The following NR
bands were approved to support PC2 HPUE for 5G NR SA in Rel-15：
  * Band n41 (2496 -- 2690 MHz)：
UL-MIMO (2Tx 23+23dBm) and 1Tx (26dBm) are supported for NR Band n41
  * Band n77 (3.3 - 4.2 GHz)：
UL-MIMO (2Tx 23+23dBm) and 1Tx (26dBm) are supported for NR Band n77
  * Band n78 (3.3 - 3.8 GHz)：
UL-MIMO (2Tx 23+23dBm) and 1Tx (26dBm) are supported for NR Band n78
  * Band n79 (4.4 - 5 GHz)：
UL-MIMO (2Tx 23+23dBm) and 1Tx (26dBm) are supported for NR Band n79
For 5G NR NSA deployment, the imbalance between UL and DL coverage still
exists, and the uplink coverage for EN-DC is also need to be improved.
Considering the technical status of the industry chain, the Power Class 2
(+26dBm) EN-DC UE should be the most practical and suitable choice to improve
the UL coverage for 5G NR NSA deployment.
It is proposed to specify Power Class 2 UE for EN-DC (1LTE band +1 NR band)
supporting +26 dBm. PC2 EN-DC for TDD-TDD band combinations are proposed in
this Work Item. This Work Item is to develop a new feature to enable Power
Class 2 EN-DC UE with 26 dBm maximum output power.
## 4.2 Objective
The objective of the work item is to specify the RF requirements for Power
Class 2 EN-DC (1 LTE band (PC3) +1 NR band (PC3) with 1Tx).
  * Specify the band combination specific RF requirements for all listed PC2 EN-DC configurations consisting of 2 different bands DL with 2 different bands UL (1 LTE band and 1 NR band) including at least
    * Applicable frequencies if necessary
    * Applicable bandwidths and bandwidth sets if necessary
    * **UE requirements, including** UE maximum output power, **Tx power tolerance, MPR, A-MPR, IBE and ACLR for Power Class 2 EN-DC, taking into account the potential coexistence with Band 40 in China**
  * Analyse combinations that have self-desensitization due to following reasons:
    * TX Harmonic and/or intermodulation overlap of receive band
    * TX signal overlap of receiver harmonic frequency
    * TX frequency being in close proximity of one of the receive bands
    * Any other identified reasons
  * For the combination where self-desensitization exists:
    * ∆T~IB,\ c~ and ∆R~IB,\ c~
    * Reference sensitivity exceptions including MSD test cases
  * UE Tx duty cycle requirements sufficient to prevent exceeding local regulatory limits such as SAR
  * Regulatory issues related to the use of PC2 EN-DC capable devices when roaming and/or p-max absence shall be addressed.
  * Simultaneous RxTx UE capability for PC2 EN-DC band combinations shall be decided
  * Release independent issue is to be considered for PC2 EN-DC
  * RAN4 needs to discuss whether existing RAN2 signalling can be reused to solve the issues in this WI. If there is RAN2 signalling impact then RAN4 will send LS to RAN2 to inform the solution. No RAN2 TUs are requested for this WI.
**This WI is aimed to specify the category of PC2 EN-DC band combinations
consisting of 2 different bands DL with 2 different bands UL (1 LTE band and 1
NR band). An overview table of these PC2** EN-DC configurations **is provided
here:**

General Part
## 5.1 Output power and TX power tolerance
For EN-DC with 1 LTE TDD band and 1 NR TDD band, UE maximum output power shall
be measured over all component carriers from different bands. If each band has
separate antenna connectors, maximum output power is measured as the sum of
maximum output power at each UE antenna connector. The period of measurement
shall be at least one sub frame (1ms). The maximum output power is specified
in Table 5.1-1.

## 5.5 Adjacent channel leakage ratio
### 5.5.1 Intra-band EN-DC
For EN-DC operation with an E-UTRA sub-block immediately adjacent to an NR
sub-block, the ACLR is defined as the ratio of the filtered mean power centred
on the aggregated sub-block bandwidth ENBW to the filtered mean power centred
on an adjacent bandwidth of the same size ENBW at nominal channel spacing. The
UE shall meet the ACLR minimum requirement EN-DC~ACLR~ specified in Table
5.5.1-1 with ENBW the sum of the sub-block bandwidths.
The assigned channel power and adjacent channel power are measured with
rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified in 6.5B.2.1.3-1 in
[3].
Table 5.5.1-1 ACLR for intra-band EN-DC (contiguous sub-blocks) power class 2
+------------------------------------------------+------+------------+ | Parameter | Unit | Value | +================================================+======+============+ | EN-DC~ACLR~ | dBc | 31 | +------------------------------------------------+------+------------+ | Measurement bandwidth of EN-DC channel | | 1.00*ENBW | +------------------------------------------------+------+------------+ | Measurement bandwidth of adjacent channel | | 0.95*ENBW | +------------------------------------------------+------+------------+ | Frequency offset of adjacent channel | | ENBW | | | | | | | | / | | | | | | | | -ENBW | +------------------------------------------------+------+------------+ | NOTE 1: ENBW is the aggregated bandwidth in | | | | MHz as defined in 38.101-3 sub-clause 5.3B. | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: The frequency offset is that in | | | | between the centre frequencies of the | | | | measurement filters | | | +------------------------------------------------+------+------------+
For intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC, the EN-DC Adjacent Channel Leakage power
Ratio (EN-DCACLR) is the ratio of the sum of the filtered mean powers centered
on the assigned E-UTRA and NR sub-block frequencies to the filtered mean power
centered on an adjacent channel frequency at nominal channel spacing. In case
the sub-block gap bandwidth Wgap is smaller than a E-UTRA or NR sub-block
bandwidth, no EN-DCACLR requirement is set for the corresponding sub-block for
the gap. The assigned EN-DC sub-block power and adjacent channel power are
measured with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified in [4]
for the E-UTRA sub-block, and [2], [3] for the NR sub-block. If the measured
adjacent channel power is greater than --50dBm then the EN-DCACLR shall be
higher than the value specified in for E-UTRAACLR and NRACLR
### 5.5.2 Inter-band EN-DC
The ACLR requirements specified in sub-clause 6.6.2.3 of TS 36.101[4] and sub-
clause 6.5.2.4 of TS 38.101-1[2] apply for each component carrier of inter-
band EN-DC.
