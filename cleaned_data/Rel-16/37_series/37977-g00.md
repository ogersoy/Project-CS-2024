# 1 Scope
The present document is the technical report for the work item on MIMO OTA,
which was approved at TSG RAN#55 [13]. The scope of the WI is to define a 3GPP
methodology or set of comparable methodologies for measuring the radiated
performance of multiple antenna reception and MIMO receivers in the UE. The
test methodology should be relevant for HSPA and LTE technologies, with
particular focus on handheld devices and devices embedded in laptop computers.
RAN WG4 has been working on the study item \"Measurement of radiated
performance for MIMO and multi-antenna reception for HSPA and LTE terminals\"
with the objective to define a test methodology for measuring the radiated
performance of MIMO and multi-antenna UE reception in UMTS and LTE.
RAN4 has done sufficient work to be confident that the definition of a
meaningful test methodology is feasible; however RAN4 does not have sufficient
evidence yet to conclude on a single test methodology that would fulfil all
requirements for standardisation, and the standardisation of multiple test
methodologies may be one eventual outcome, with a view to avoid differences in
the decision of what is a \"good\" or \"bad\" device from the radiated
receiver performance perspective.

# 4 Introduction
## 4.1 Background
The use of MIMO and receiver diversity in the UE is expected to give large
gains in downlink throughput performance for HSPA and LTE devices. 3GPP
already defined conducted tests for MIMO and multiple antenna receivers (type
1 and type 3 in TS 25.101 for HSPA demodulation), but it is clear that the
ability to duplicate these gains in the field is highly dependent on the
performance of the receive-antenna system.
At TSG RAN#41, Sep 2008, it was indicated that there is a need for a test
methodology to be created with the aim of measuring and verifying the radiated
performance of multi-antenna and MIMO receiver in UEs for both HSPA and LTE
devices. As an outcome of the discussion, an LS was sent to COST 2100 SWG2.2
and CTIA ERP to ask them for feedback on their plans/ongoing work in this
area, and also the timescales for which such work could be completed to define
such a methodology, with particular focus on handheld devices and devices
embedded in laptop computers.
Since then, feedback from COST 2100 and CTIA has suggested they are happy to
work on this topic. However, given that 3GPP is the customer for this work as
well as being a potential contributor, it is important to aim for commonly-
accepted measurement and test methodology to be used across the industry.
## 4.2 Work item objective
The high level objective of this work item is to define a test methodology
(ies) for verifying the radiated performance of multiple antenna reception in
the UE and such methodology shall be able to:
\- Verify the radiated \"Over-The-Air\" (OTA) performance of multiple antenna
reception in the UE.
\- Accurately able to reflect MIMO and SIMO performance under realistic MIMO
and SIMO channel conditions. Be able to distinguish between UEs of \"Good\"
and \"Bad\" multi-Rx antenna OTA performance, and offer a good reflection of
the likely experience in the field.
\- Offer good reliability, repeatability and an acceptable level of
measurement uncertainty.
Such test methodology(ies) shall enable performance verification for:
\- Handheld devices, devices embedded in laptop computers, and other devices
(such as M2M equipment).
\- All transmission modes of LTE and HSDPA, including spatial multiplexing
(MIMO) and single spatial layer operation. However the transmission modes used
in the test shall be defined as part of the work.
\- Initially tests shall use of LTE Transmission Mode 3, Fixed Reference
Channel, and forced Rank 2. As the work progresses, other transmission modes
of LTE and HSPA shall be introduced.
\- The utilization of Variable Reference Channels and other-cell interference
shall also be studied at a later stage.
The following is required for the analysis phase of this work item:
\- In order to compare results across the different methods, absolute
throughput shall be used as the Figure of Merit.
\- In order to analyse and accurately validate a method(s) the following work
shall be performed:
\- eNodeB settings shall be agreed.
\- Realistic MIMO conditions and realistic channel models shall be identified
to be used as a reference radio environment.
\- The MIMO conditions and channel models shall be validated for the proposed
test methods.
\- Calibration of the power levels in the methodology shall be performed.
\- The absolute throughput measured for each test method shall be compared
with the absolute throughput measured in the reference radio environment, in
order to identify the capability of each method to provide a measurement
result that matches what is observed in realistic environments.
\- In order to minimize the variables associated with testing of production
UEs with unknown antenna characteristics, utilize reference antennas in
combination with a known UE baseband receiver (verified via conducted RF tests
with and without channel impairments). This is intended to verify whether the
characteristics of the receive antenna design (i.e. correlation, gain
imbalance, etc) affecting receiver performance can be accurately distinguished
by proposed test methods.
In the event that more than one test methodology is agreed to be standardised,
differences between methodologies in the decision of what is a \"good\" or
\"bad\" device from the radiated receiver performance perspective shall be
avoided.
When selecting the method(s) for specification for LTE MIMO, applicability to
LTE-SIMO UMTS-SIMO/MIMO shall be described.
During the course of this Work Item, maintain ongoing communication with COST
and CTIA MOSG to ensure industry coordination on this topic and to distribute
tasks according to expertise or resource availability.
TSG RAN should contact TSG GERAN to get feedback on the applicability of such
a test methodology for GERAN.
## 4.3 High level requirements
The following high level requirements are agreed by RAN4:
1\. Measurement of radiated performance for MIMO and multi-antenna reception
for HSPA and LTE terminals must be performed over-the-air, i.e. without RF
cable connections to the DUT.
> NOTE 1: DUTs to the test house will have accessibility to temporary antenna
> port for conducted purposes.
>
> NOTE 2: Temporary antenna port is used to assess to DUT receiver.
>
> NOTE 3: UE special function to measure antenna pattern is not desirable for
> MIMO OTA purposes.
2\. The MIMO OTA method(s) must be able to differentiate between a good
terminal and a bad terminal in terms of MIMO OTA performance.
3\. The desired primary Figure Of Merit (FOM) is absolute throughput. This
will easily allow meaningful comparison of the ability of different methods to
evaluate MIMO OTA performance.
# 5 Performance metrics
## 5.1 Figure of Merits
Absolute throughput performance is used in order to be able to compare the
different proposed methodologies in their ability to distinguish good and bad
MIMO devices.
The performance metric applies to both HSPA and LTE system.
Other Figure of Merits and their applicability on the assessment of MIMO
performance is for further study.
### 5.1.1 Definition of MIMO throughput
MIMO throughput is defined here as the time-averaged number of correctly
received transport blocks in a communication system running an application,
where a Transport Block is defined in the reference measurement channel. From
OTA perspective, this is also called MIMO OTA throughput.
The MIMO OTA throughput is measured at the top of physical layer of HSPA and
LTE system. Therefore, this is also measured at the same point as in the
conductive measurement setup: under the use of FRC, the SS transmit fixed-size
payload bits to the DUT. The DUT signals back either ACK or NACK to the SS.
The SS then records the following:
 Number of ACKs,
 Number of NACKs, and
 Number of DTX TTIs
Hence the MIMO (OTA) throughput can be calculated as
where Transmitted TBS is the Transport Block Size transmitted by the SS, which
is fixed for a FRC during the measurement period. MeasurementTime is the total
composed of successful TTIs (ACK), unsuccessful TTIs (NACK) and DTX-TTIs.
The time-averaging is to be taken over a time period sufficiently long to
average out the variations due to the fading channel. Therefore, this is also
called the average MIMO OTA throughput. The throughput should be measured at a
time when eventual start-up transients in the system have evanesced.
### 5.1.2 Definition of Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR)
Applicability of SIR to MIMO OTA performance evaluation is FFS.
This definition is applicable to MIMO OTA test cases where control of the
signal to interference ratio (SIR) is required (i.e. DUT throughput
characterized as a function of SIR shall require control of SIR within the
test volume as described in the sub-sections that follow). For test cases
where SIR control is not required (i.e. throughput characterized as a function
of signal power incident to the DUT antennas, such as RS EPRE) this definition
is not applicable.
In real world scenarios the mobile will experience an interference floor
higher than the device noise floor. As a consequence, the methodology for
quantifying MIMO OTA performance of a device may have to include the use of an
external interferer signal. MIMO OTA testing is useful for a situation where,
in general, a high signal level is received that is not close to the
sensitivity level of the UE and the interference floor is dominated by inter-
cell interference and/or other interferers and not the UE noise floor. In most
UE performance testing, interference is modelled as AWGN for conducted
testing. This proposal intends to align with this assumption and use AWGN for
the interference signal.
From a system level point of view, the omnidirectional (isotropic) and
uncorrelated nature of the interfering signal to the wanted signal is a
crucial assumption. Injecting a noise signal that is correlated to the wanted
faded signal is neither a scenario that is typically found in the network nor
a scenario for which the UE modem is designed. As a result, we propose the
methodology for injecting an omnidirectional (isotropic) and uncorrelated
interferer signal.
#### 5.1.2.1 SIR Control for Multi-Probe Anechoic Chamber Methodology
The interference level necessary to achieve a given SIR inside the test zone
shall be generated as an independent process at each antenna probe with equal
power, regardless of the signal power transmitted through that probe. The SIR
shall be decreased by increasing the AWGN power while keeping the signal level
constant.
To validate the control of SIR, the measurement setup shown in Figure
5.1.2.1-1 below may be used.
Figure 5.1.2.1-1: Verifying SIR level in the anechoic chamber multi-cluster
MIMO OTA setup
The actual system components shown in the diagram, such as amplifier box or
the source of the omnidirectional interferer signal, may or may not be present
as shown.
The procedure below shall be used to verify SIR control inside the test zone
for a given target SIR.
Verification procedure for establishing SIR control:
1\. Configure the spectrum analyser with the settings given in Table 5.1.2.1-1
below
2\. Load the target channel model into the channel emulator (e.g. SCME UMa,
SCME UMi) and start the emulation
3\. Configure the system gains for the LTE signal and injected interfering
signal paths to achieve the target SIR
4\. Disable interfering signal injection (depending on the system
configuration this may be configured within the channel emulator itself or in
an external signal generator)
5\. Connect a vertically polarized reference dipole to the spectrum analyser
via a cable and place inside the chamber at the center of the test zone
6\. Measure the received power with the spectrum analyser over a duration
sufficient to achieve statistical significance as defined in clause 12.1.6.2
and record the value as
P~SIG_MEAS_VER~
7\. Compensate for the loss of the cable (α~CABLE~) and the gain of the dipole
(G~DIPOLE~) such that
P~SIG_\ VER~ = P~SIG_MEAS_VER~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~DIPOLE~
8\. Repeat steps 5 to 7 with the magnetic loop and get
P~SIG_\ HOR~ = P~SIG_MEAS_HOR~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~LOOP~
9\. Calculate the total signal power received as
P~SIG_TOTAL~ = P~SIG_VER\|LINEAR~ + P~SIG_HOR\|LINEAR~
10\. Disable the LTE signal source and enable interference injection
(depending on the system configuration this may be configured within the
channel emulator itself or in an external signal generator)
11\. Connect a reference dipole to the spectrum analyser via a cable and place
inside the chamber at the center of the test zone
12\. Measure the received interfering signal power with the spectrum analyser
over aduration sufficient to achieve statistical significance and record the
value as
P~INT_MEAS_VER~
13\. Compensate for the loss of the cable (α~CABLE~) and the gain of the
dipole (G~DIPOLE~) such that
P~INT_\ VER~ = P~INT_MEAS_VER~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~DIPOLE~
14\. Repeat steps 11 to 13 with the magnetic loop and get
P~INT_\ HOR~ = P~INT_MEAS_HOR~ - α~CABLE~ - G~LOOP~
15\. Calculate the total interfering signal power received as
P~INT_TOTAL~ = P~INT_VER\|LINEAR~ + P~INT_HOR\|LINEAR~
16\. Calculate the achieved signal to interference ratio such that
SIR~ACHIEVED~ = P~SIG_TOTAL~ - P~INT_TOTAL~
and validate that it matches the target SIR.

Care shall be taken to ensure that the signal level measurement in step 6 and
the interfering signal level measurement in step 12 are sufficiently above the
noise floor of the measurement system as to not impact the final SIR level. A
horizontally polarized reference dipole may be used as opposed to the magnetic
loop as long as the theta gain pattern is properly accounted for.
#### 5.1.2.2 SIR Control for the reverberation chamber method
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is used as interference for the SIR-
controlled test case. Figure 5.1.2.2-1 shows an example setup for adding AWGN
to the test environment with the injection point for the AWGN highlighted. The
AWGN noise power used to create the desired SIR within the test volume shall
be generated as an independent process. It is represented by faded noise
driven in an isotropic fashion. The AWGN is injected into the reverberation
chamber using a separate chamber antenna and the fading of the signal and the
noise will be uncorrelated. The SIR is computed as a long-term average.
Figure 5.1.2.2-1: Example setup for SIR-controlled test scenario for the
reverberation chamber methodology
#### 5.1.2.3 SIR Control for the reverberation chamber plus channel emulator
method
AWGN will be used as interference for the SIR-controlled test case. Figure
5.1.2.3-1 shows an example setup for adding AWGN to the test environment with
the injection points for the AWGN highlighted. The AWGN noise power used to
create the desired SIR within the test volume shall be generated as an
independent process with equal power at each output of the channel emulator.
It is represented by an un-faded noise driven in an isotropic fashion. The
AWGN is combined with the signal at the output of the channel emulator (after
the channel emulator fading) but before the signal is fed to the reverberation
chamber antennas. The combined signal and AWGN is then fed into the chamber
with the same chamber antennas. The SIR is computed as a long-term average.
Figure 5.1.2.3-1: Example setup for SIR-controlled test scenario for the
reverberation chamber and channel emulator methodology
#### 5.1.2.4 SIR Control for the two-stage methodology
The two-stage method is fundamentally different from the multi-probe boundary
array method and this has a significant impact on how omnidirectional AWGN is
generated and validated.
In the two-stage method the AWGN is added digitally to the baseband signals.
The goal is to emulate omnidirectional AWGN at the UE antennas. Since the
signals generated by the second stage of two-stage method represent the
signals after applying the effect of the receive antennas this has
implications for the addition of AWGN.
If uncorrelated AWGN is added to the second stage signals for each UE receiver
this creates a slightly easier test environment where each receiver sees
uncorrelated noise. However, when the UE is placed in an actual
omnidirectional noise field, the noise reaching each of the recovers is
correlated by the same amount as the antennas are correlated. The impact of
using uncorrelated AWGN depends on the antennas in question. Highly correlated
antennas would see the same AWGN signal at each receiver but very low
correlated antennas would expect see uncorrelated AWGN which is easier to
process. For typical devices the performance difference has been measured at
around 0.5 dB.
To fully represent the impact of omnidirectional AWGN on the wanted signals
being generated for each receiver after the antennas, it is therefore
necessary to correlate the AWGN according to the antenna correlation for an
isotropic field.
To validate the control of SIR, the measurement setup shown in Figure
5.1.2.4-1 below may be used.
Figure 5.1.2.4-1: Verifying SIR level for the RTS method
Note: The signals from the vertical polarization and horizontal polarization
have a different meaning from the multi-probe method. For the multi-probe
method, the signal from vertical polarization antenna represents the vertical
polarized signal in the real propagation environment. But for RTS method, the
signal from the vertical polarization antenna represents the signal intended
for one receiver, which has had the dual-polarized channel environment and
antenna pattern applied. The same is true for the horizontal antenna. Thus the
signals from each probe antenna include AWGN components from both
polarizations.
The actual system components shown in the diagram are indicative of functions
and may or may not be integrated.
The procedure below shall be used to verify SIR control for a given target
SIR.
1\. Configure the spectrum analyzer with the settings given in Table 5.1.2.4-1
below
2\. Load the target channel model into the channel emulator (e.g. SCME UMa,
SCME UMi) and start the emulation
3\. Configure the system gains for the LTE signals and interfering signal to
achieve the target SIR
4\. Disable the interfering signal
5\. Connect a vertically polarized reference dipole to the spectrum analyzer
via a cable and place inside the chamber at the center of the test zone
6\. Measure the received power with the spectrum analyzer over a duration
sufficient to achieve statistical significance as defined in clause 12.3.6.2
and record the value as
P~SIG_MEAS_VER~
7\. Compensate for the loss of the cable (α~CABLE~) and the gain of the dipole
(G~DIPOLE~) such that
P~SIG_\ VER~ = P~SIG_MEAS_VER~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~DIPOLE~
8\. Repeat steps 5 to 7 with the magnetic loop and get
P~SIG_\ HOR~ = P~SIG_MEAS_HOR~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~LOOP~
9\. Disable the LTE signal source and enable interference injection (depending
on the system configuration this may be configured within the channel emulator
itself or in an external signal generator)
10\. Connect a reference dipole to the spectrum analyzer via a cable and place
inside the chamber at the center of the test zone
11\. Measure the received interfering signal power with the spectrum analyzer
over a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance and record the
value as
P~INT_MEAS_VER~
12\. Compensate for the loss of the cable (α~CABLE~) and the gain of the
dipole (G~DIPOLE~) such that
P~INT_\ VER~ = P~INT_MEAS_VER~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~DIPOLE~
13\. Repeat steps 10 to 12 with the magnetic loop and get
P~INT_\ HOR~ = P~INT_MEAS_HOR~ - α~CABLE~ - G~LOOP~
14\. Calculate the achieved signal to interference ratio for vertical
polarization branch as
SIR~ACHIEVED_VER~ = P~SIG_\ VER~ - P~INT_\ VER~
Calculate the achieved signal to interference ratio for horizontal
polarization branch as
SIR~ACHIEVED_HOR~ = P~SIG_\ HOR~ - P~INT_\ HOR~
and validate that SIR~ACHIEVED_VER~ and SIR~ACHIEVED_HOR~ matches the target
SIR.

Care shall be taken to ensure that the signal level measurement in step 6 and
the interfering signal level measurement in step 11 are sufficiently above the
noise floor of the measurement system as to not impact the final SIR level. A
horizontally polarized reference dipole may be used as opposed to the magnetic
loop as long as the theta gain pattern is properly accounted for.
## 5.2 Averaging of throughput curves
There are different possibilities how to average the curves where throughput
(TP) was recorded as function of downlink (DL) power (expressed in RS EPRE) or
of Signal-to-Interference (SIR) level. Averages shall be calculated by the
following formula.
### 5.2.1 Average of power levels
The averaging of DL power (or SIR) is the first possibility. The power levels
are summed similar to the formula used for TIS evaluation, i.e. using the
inverse of power. The formula to use is:
For every selected TP value _y_ a corresponding power level _P~n~_(_y_) can be
found, and summed over all _N_ conditions.\ The subscript \"_inv_ \" is used
to indicate that the inverse sum of power values is taken.
The power levels have to be converted to linear values in mW before the
summation takes place, and the average then can be reconverted to dBm / 15 kHz
for RS EPRE or dB for SIR.
Since the recording of the TP curves is done with fixed steps in power, only
few TP values are available.\ In order to calculate the correct average, the
TP curves have to be interpolated, and a fixed set of _y_ values for TP can be
used for generating the curve of _P~avg~_(_y_).
In the case that a curve was not recorded down to 0 % TP, it shall be
extrapolated from the point taken with lowest TP to TP = 0 using the same
power level.
If a curve did not reach nominal TP, it shall be extrapolated it in a way that
it would reach nominal TP at the lowest power level where it was reaching its
individual maximum TP value.
The average TP curve shall only be calculated up to a TP value which equals to
the average of all individual maximum TP values.

positions of the chamber, and the device under test (DUT) is located at the
center position. The DUT is tested over the air without RF cables.
The Anechoic chamber techniques creates a realistic geometric based spatio-
temporal-polarimetric radio channel for testing MIMO performance using
Geometric based stochastic channel models as defined in Clause 8.2.
The components of the solution include:
\- Anechoic Chamber
\- System Simulator (SS)
\- N channel RF emulator, with OTA Channel Generation Features
\- N linearly polarized antenna elements configured V, H or co-located V&H or
slant X polarizations
\- K azimuthally separated antenna positions with predefined angles at radius
R
\- Channel model definition for each test case
An illustration of an anechoic chamber is shown in Figure 6.3.1.1-1 below.

cabling not shown)

A system level block diagram is shown in Figure 6.3.1.1-2, which includes the
SS to generate the M branch MIMO signal, and an RF Channel Emulator with an
OTA Channel Generation Feature to properly correlate, fade, scale, delay, and
distribute the signal to each test probe in the chamber. For the selected
environmental conditions modelled by the SCME UMa and UMi channel models, the
minimum setup configuration can be described as below:

The full SCME or Multi-Cluster channel models are defined in Clause 8.2. The
Single-Cluster model, which is not part of the set of channel models validated
in clause 8, would be based on the channel models defined in section 8.2 with
a set of dithered AoAs around zero degrees.
##### 6.3.1.1.1 Concept and configuration
For MIMO OTA modelling the geometric channel models are mapped into the fading
emulator, converting the geometric channel models into the emulator tap
coefficients. This process is illustrated in Figure 6.3.1.1.1-1.
Figure 6.3.1.1.1-1: Modelling process
The setup of OTA chamber antennas with eight antenna positions is depicted in
Figure 6.3.1.1.1-2. The DUT is at the center, and the antennas are in a circle
around the DUT with uniform spacing (e.g. 45° with 16 elements arranged in 8
positions, where each position contains a vertically and horizontally
polarized antenna pair). Denoting directions of _K_ OTA antennas with _θ~k~_ ,
_k_ = 1, ..., _K_ , and antenna spacing in the angle domain with _∆θ_. Each
antenna is connected to a single fading emulator output port. In the figure,
for example, antenna A~1V~ denotes the first OTA antenna position and
Vertically (V) polarized element, A~8H~ denotes the eight OTA antenna position
and horizontally (H) polarized element, etc.
NOTE: In the drawing the V-polarized elements are actually orthogonal to the
paper (azimuth plane)

polarized chamber antennas
##### 6.3.1.1.2 Scalability of the methodology
The number of antennas is scalable. In theory, there is no upper limit and the
lower limit is one. The required number of channels depends on three main
aspects: channel model, DUT size, and polarization. The key question is how
accurately the channel model is emulated. Based on the quiet zone discussion,
it was proposed to use 8 antennas in the case of single polarization and 16
antennas in the case of dual polarization. However, for single cluster case,
fewer antennas may be enough. On the other hand, if elevation is needed, the
antenna number will be higher. Additionally, the antenna positions can be
adjusted to optimize the accuracy with limited number of antennas.
Another aspect is the channel model. Most of the Geometry-based Stochastic
Channel Models (GSCMs) are two-dimensional, i.e. azimuth plane only, but the
proposed MIMO OTA concept is not limited to the azimuth plane.\ It can also be
extended to elevation plane, when we talk about 3D MIMO OTA. However, the 3D
MIMO OTA is rather complex and it does not provide very much additional
information about the DUT. Therefore, 3D MIMO OTA can be considered as one
future development, but it is not the recommended solution in the beginning of
MIMO OTA testing.
Downscaling of the proposed method is more attractive due to the possibility
to save the cost of the test system.\ Full SCME requires multiple antennas,
but single cluster SCME can be implemented with lower number of antennas than
full SCME. The same downscaling benefits of the single-cluster model apply
based on DUT size. The difference between full SCME and Single Cluster model
is depicted in Figure 6.3.1.1.2-1. Basically the only difference is that the
mean Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of each cluster is turned to the same primary
direction. If all AoA's were identical, it would be a problematic case as it
locks all like-angle sub-paths together with identical Doppler, which results
in a breakdown of the model. With slight dithering as in the example that the
AoAs = [0 -1 1 -2 2 -3] degrees, the angle spread after dithering increases
from 35.00 to 35.02 degrees, which is not significant, however the model now
performs as expected. Obviously, one primary cluster requires a lower number
of antennas than multiple clusters especially when angular spread is narrow,
e.g. 35 degrees. The number of fading channels is the same as the number of
antennas.\ Therefore, single cluster SCME would require less fading channels
as well.

##### 6.3.1.1.3 Test conditions
This candidate solution supports testing of different figure of merits and is
applicable to any 3GPP release.\ It supports different channel models from SCM
to IMT-Advanced. Due to its generality, it does not restrict the test
conditions. However, for simplicity, it is good to start from downlink
throughput testing.
The downlink throughput testing can be done e.g. in the following manner.
BS transmits signal through a radio channel emulator. This signal is routed to
several antennas in anechoic chamber. The DUT is placed at center of the
chamber and the performance is measured from the DUT.
\- OTA antennas are located along a circle around the DUT;
\- The circular geometry is needed because we need signal from many directions
at the same time (requirement from the channel models).
The test steps can be, e.g., according to [3] or as follows:
1) Calibrate the full system with a test signal;
2) Set the first test case (e.g. channel model) to the fading emulator;
3) Generate test signal by the communication tester / BS emulator;
4) Measure the DUT performance (downlink throughput);
5) If the performance exceeds the specified limit, the DUT passes the test
case;
6) If all test cases done, go to step 7. Otherwise, set the next test case
(e.g. channel model) to the fading emulator and go back to step 3.
7) If DUT passed all the test cases, the DUT passes the full MIMO OTA test;
8) If DUT failed in at least one test case, the DUT failed the full MIMO OTA
test.
#### 6.3.1.2 Void
#### 6.3.1.3 Candidate solution 3
The principle of two-stage MIMO OTA method is based on the assumption that the
DUT far-field antenna radiation pattern will contain all the necessary
information for evaluation of the DUT\'s antenna\'s performance like radiation
power, efficiency and correlation and that with channel model approaches, the
influence of antenna radiation pattern can be correctly incorporated into the
channel model. Thus the method will first measure the DUT\'s MIMO antenna
patterns and then convolve the measured antenna patterns with the chosen MIMO
OTA channel models for real-time emulation. The resulting test signal
generated by the channel emulator and coupled back into the DUT receivers
represents the signal that the DUT receivers would have seen if the DUT had
been placed in the desired radiated field. Thus an ideal implementation of the
two-stage method provides the same results as an ideal implementation of the
boundary antenna array method.
The two-stage method can be used to measure the following figures of merit:
1) Throughput
2) TRP and TRS
3) CQI, BLER
4) Antenna efficiency and MEG
5) Antenna correlation, MIMO channel capacity.
In order to accurately measure the antenna pattern of the intact device, the
DUT chipset needs to support received amplitude and relative phase
measurements of the antennas. The validity of antenna pattern measurement is
predicated on the assumption that for the frequency being tested, the DUT
antenna pattern is static. Devices than can alter their antenna pattern in
real time as a function of the radiated environment \-- sometimes referred to
as active antennas -- is FFS as noted in Table 12.4-1.The method of coupling
the base station emulator and DUT can be through the standard temporary
antenna connectors (conducted two-stage method) or by using a specially
calibrated radiated connection (radiated two-stage or RTS method) to do the
test on throughput, etc., to test how the MIMO antennas will influence the
performance. The conducted method of coupling is straightforward but does not
capture the impact of radiated leakage from the DUT transmit antennas to the
DUT receive antennas, thus in its current form without additional interference
estimation the conducted method of coupling in the second stage is not
proposed for use in conformance testing. Its description is included for
historical completeness of the development of the two-stage method. The
radiated method of coupling in the second stage does fully capture radiated
leakage and is the method defined for conformance testing in Clause 12.
##### 6.3.1.3.1 Concept and configuration
The assumption of the two-stage MIMO OTA method is that the measured far field
antenna pattern of the DUT\'s multiple antennas can fully capture the mutual
coupling of the multiple antenna arrays and their influence on radiated
performance.\ Thus to do the two-stage MIMO OTA test, the antenna patterns of
the antenna array needs to be measured accurately in the first stage. In order
to accurately measure the antenna pattern of the intact device, the chipset
needs to support amplitude and relative phase measurements of the antennas. To
achieve this, two new UE measurements have been defined called Reference
Signal Antenna Power (RSAP) and Reference Signal Relative Antenna Phase
(RSARP). These measurements are defined in TR 36.978 [20].
**Stage 1:** The measurement of the DUT's multiple antennas takes place in a
traditional anechoic chamber set up as described in Annex A.2 in [4], where
the DUT is put into the chamber and each antenna element\'s complex far zone
pattern is measured using the RSAP and RSARP measurements defined in [20]. The
influence of human body loss can also be measured by attaching the DUT to a
SAM head and or hand phantom when doing the antenna pattern measurements. The
characteristics of the SAM phantom are specified in Annex A.1 of [4]. The
chamber is equipped with a positioner, that makes it possible to perform full
3-D far zone pattern measurements for both Tx and Rx radiated performance. As
specified in A.2 of [4] the measurement antenna shall be able to measure two
orthogonal polarizations (typically linear theta (θ) and phi (φ) polarizations
as shown in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-1).
Figure 6.3.1.3.1-1: The coordinate system used in the measurements
**Stage 2:** Convolve the antenna patterns measured in stage 1 with the chosen
MIMO channel model, using a channel emulator and then use the resulting signal
to perform the OTA throughput test. The signal is coupled into the DUT using
either a cabled or radiated connection.
The two-stage method is illustrated in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-2. In the conducted
two-stage method shown in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-2 the BS emulator is connected to
the MIMO channel emulator and then to the DUT's temporary antenna ports via
approved RF cables. These ports are the standard ones provided for conducted
conformance tests. The alternative to using a conducted connection is to use a
calibrated radiated connection in an anechoic environment as shown in Figure
6.3.1.3.1-3 is the radiated two-stage (RTS) method. This coupling technique
exploits the Eigen modes of the transmission channel in the anechoic chamber
to provide isolated radiated connections between the probe antennas and each
DUT receiver after the DUT antenna. Throughput with the DUT's MIMO antenna
influence can be measured using either coupling method. However, only the
radiated coupling method intrinsically includes the effects of DUT self-
interference and is the method defined for conformance testing in Clause 12.
There are two different approaches to convolve the DUT antenna patterns with
MIMO channel model.
a) Apply antenna patterns to geometric (Ray-based) channel models. Ray-based
models support arbitrary antenna patterns under predefined channel modes in a
natural way as described above. If Ray-based models like SCME are specified to
be used for MIMO OTA testing, then the channel emulator needs to support SCME
channel model emulation and convolution with the measured antenna patterns.
b) Apply antenna patterns to correlation-based channel models. With a
correlation matrix calculation method for arbitrary antenna patterns under
multipath channel conditions, the correlation matrix and the antenna imbalance
can be calculated and then emulated by the channel emulator.
Figure 6.3.1.3.1-2: Proposed conducted two-stage test methodology for MIMO OTA
test
An example implementation of the radiated method of connecting to the EUT in
the second stage is shown in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-3.
Figure 6.3.1.3.1-3: Alternative connection for the radiated two-stage (RTS)
test methodology for MIMO OTA test
Figure 6.3.1.3.1-3 shows the radiated coupling method for the second stage.
Two probe antennas with polarization V and H are co-located in the anechoic
chamber. Note, unlike in the first stage where the V and H probes are used at
different times, in the second stage both V and H probes are used
simultaneously. An example implementation of this would be the dual polarized
configuration described in Annex A.2.2 of [4]. The only difference between the
conducted second stage and the radiated second stage is to replace the RF
cables with the radiated channel inside the chamber. Due to the propagation
channel in the chamber, signals transmitted from each probe antenna are
received by both DUT antennas which is different from the cable conducted case
where the signals are isolated by the cables. However, by precoding the
transmitted signals using spatial multiplexing techniques it is possible by
calculating the radiated channel matrix and by applying its inverse to the
transmitted signals, to create an identity matrix allowing the transmitted
signals to be received independently at each DUT receiver after the DUT
antenna. This precoding recreates the equivalent of the isolated cable
conducted conditions at the receiver but but with radiated self-interference
now included.
The establishment of the radiated connection is explained as follows. Assume
and are the transmitted signals from the base station emulator, after applying
the desired channel model and convolution with the complex antenna pattern we
get:
and .
The radiated channel matrix between the probe antennas and the DUT antennas is
.
If the channel emulator applies the inverse of the radiated channel matrix to
and , the signal received after the DUT antennas is same as the cable-
conducted method as follows:
The above example of RTS using two probe antennas is applicable to UE with two
Rx antennas. For UE with > 2 Rx antennas, the RTS method is FFS.
##### 6.3.1.3.2 Test conditions
This candidate solution supports testing of different figure of merits. It is
also applicable for any 3GPP Release, and even for other standards.
This method can reuse existing SISO OTA anechoic chambers to make the antenna
pattern measurements; the channel emulator number is required to match the
number of device receiver inputs regardless of the complexity of the chosen
channel model, the method is consequently easily scalable to higher order MIMO
due to the reduced number of instruments required; the channel models are
highly accurate due to being implemented electronically and are also fully
flexible and can be altered to suit any desired operating conditions such as
indoor-outdoor, high or low Doppler spread, high or low delay spread, beam
width, in 2D or full 3D etc.
This method requires the chipset in the DUT to support amplitude and relative
phase measurements of the antennas as defined in TR 36.978 [20]. The conducted
coupling method in the second stage cannot directly measure DUT self-
desensitization since the antenna pattern measurement does not take account of
possible signal leakage from the device transmit antennas into the receive
antennas. The radiated coupling method for the second stage does fully
characterize any DUT self-desensitization and is the method specified in
Clause 12 for conformance testing.
The detailed RTS test procedure can be found in Subclause 12.3.
##### 6.3.1.3.3 Overview of calibration procedures specific to the RTS method
The efficacy of the RTS method is based on the ability to accurately measure
the DUT complex antenna pattern and establish an isolated radiated MIMO
connection in the second stage.
The output of the first stage is a relative antenna pattern of unknown gain
and linearity. The calibration of the antenna pattern occurs in the second
stage.
**Selection of orientation for the second stage**
The second stage starts with the selection of a DUT orientation at which to
establish a radiated MIMO connection to the DUT. This orientation is chosen
from any point on the measured pattern at which the optimal isolation between
the streams can be achieved by application of the inverse channel matrix. A
degree of isolation between the received streams for most antenna patterns is
achieved through use of different transmit polarizations or by using separate
antennas. Improved isolation will be achieved by choosing a DUT orientation
that avoids nulls in the antenna pattern. The algorithm for selecting the
optimal orientation is left up to implementation. The only criterion is that
the selected orientation achieves sufficient isolation.
**Calculation of the inverse transmission matrix**
Once an orientation is selected an unfaded SISO connection is established from
the first probe antenna and the RSAP for each DUT antenna and the RSARP
between the antennas is measured. These measurements are repeated using the
second probe antenna. From these measurements the optimal transmission matrix
from the probe antennas to the DUT receiver can be calculated. When the
inverse of this matrix is applied to the probes it is possible to transmit a
wanted signal from the first probe to the first receiver and from the second
probe to the second receiver with minimal crosstalk.
**Calibration of the measured antenna pattern gain**
The impact of the unknown gain of the DUT antennas then de-embedded from the
test system by setting the downlink power for each probe to the level that
returns the same RSAP measurement that was reported for that probe
polarization during the first stage at the orientation being used for the
second stage. This nulling process is the reason why the absolute accuracy of
the RSAP measurement is unimportant since the antenna gain is represented by
the change in downlink power necessary to achieve the same RSAP report for the
first and second stage at the same DUT orientation.
For example using a -60 dBm nominal level in the first stage for the V antenna
assume the DUT for one orientation returns RSAP for receiver 1 of -67 dBm
representing an uncorrected gain of -7 dB. This report includes the true gain
of the antenna at the V polarization for this orientation (assume -4 dB) plus
an unknown error in the RSAP absolute accuracy (-3 dB). In the second stage
antenna calibration step, a wanted signal of -60 dBm is transmitted, adjusted
to -53 dBm to de-embed the uncorrected gain of -7 dB and the RSAP measured. If
the RSAP accuracy were perfect the DUT would report -60 dBm but since the true
antenna gain at that orientation is -4 dB, the reported RSAP is higher at -57
dBm. The difference between the first stage RSAP measurement and the second
stage RSAP with the uncorrected gain applied then represents the true antenna
gain at that orientation referred to the known accuracy of the downlink
signal.
**Validation of the isolation between the streams**
Once the RSAP absolute error has been measured and removed from the measured
antenna pattern the isolation of the streams in the second stage can be
measured. This could be done with static signals but what matters is the
isolation achieved under the more difficult dynamic fading conditions. The
isolation can be measured by establishing a connection and, with the channel
model and antenna pattern applied, measure the difference in dB between the
RSAP reported for each DUT receiver. For a DUT to be usable with the RTS
method a minimum isolation has to be achieved of 15 dB averaged over at least
200 RSAP measurements.
**Monotonicity check of RSAP and RSARP**
Once the minimum isolation of the radiated second stage has been validated it
is necessary to validate the linearity of RSAP and RSARP measurements over the
operating range -60 dB, to -80 dBm and +/- 180 degrees. This starts with a
monotonicity check using a [1] dB step size for RSAP and a [5] degree step
size for RSARP. The step sizes of the monotonicity check determine the
accuracy to which the measurements can be linearized. If the monotonicity
check fails the RTS method is not usable for the DUT.
**Linearization of RSAP and RSARP**
Once monotonicity has been validated, the linearity of RSAP can be measured.
This is done from the orientation of the peak antenna gain over the range -60
dBm to -80 dBm. The linearity shall be \ Number of antenna probes _N_ : 15

### 6.3.2 Methodologies based on Reverberation Chamber
#### 6.3.2.1 Candidate solution 1
The Reverberation Chamber is a metallic cavity or cavities that can emulate an
isotropic multi-path environment which represents a reference environment for
systems designed to work during fading, similar to how the free space
\"anechoic\" reference environment is used for tests of Line-Of-Sight systems.
The Rayleigh environment in a reverberation chamber is well known as a good
reference for urban and indoor environments, but does not well represent rural
and suburban environments.
For a future multi-antenna OTA measurement standard it is important to have a
fast and repeatable test method to evaluate and compare multi-antenna devices
in the environments and under the conditions where most people will use them.
The overwhelming majority of calls/data connections with mobile phones are
made indoors and in urban areas which can be very well represented by the
reverberation chamber. These environments are well characterised by multi-path
and 3D distribution of the communication signals and it makes sense to use the
reverberation chamber for optimizing/evaluating devices with both single and
multiple antenna configurations to be used indoors and in urban areas.
The test setup for testing UE receiver diversity performance is composed of a
Base Station (BS) emulator, a reverberation chamber equipped with fixed BS
wall-mounted antennas, a switch to direct the base station signal to/from one
of the BS wall mounted antennas, mechanical metallic stirrers and a rotating
platform to hold the DUT (Figure 6.3.2.1-1).\ Alternatively, the chamber may
contain one or more cavities coupled through waveguides or slotted plates
(Figure 7.1-2).
Reverberation chambers have no quiet zone. As long as the DUT is placed at
least 0.5 wavelengths from the wall or metallic stirrers the result will be
the same within the standard deviation of the chamber.
Mechanical stirrers and switching among different fixed BS wall-mounted
antennas (monopoles used for polarization stirring) allow simulating the
Rayleigh fading at each antenna of the terminal inside the chamber. Accuracy
can even been increased by rotating the platform holding the device.
Each position of the mechanical stirrers for each position of the platform and
each fixed BS antenna, represents a point of the Rayleigh distribution in
terms of receive power on the device antennas. In that way a Rayleigh fading
is artificially created.
In that way, several UE metrics can be measured: throughput with RX-DIV, TRP,
TIS (Total Isotropic Sensitivity), etc.
For each point of the Rayleigh distribution created by the different
configurations of the chamber, the metric is noted. This method can be used to
measure UE sensitivity and UE radiated power.

**Method of measurement result analysis:**
Measured VNA traces (frequency responses H(t,f)) are saved into a hard drive.
The data is read into, e.g., Matlab.\ The analysis is performed by taking the
Fourier transform of each FR. The resulting impulse responses h(t,tau) are
averaged in power over time:
Finally the resulting PDP is shifted in delay, such that the first tap is on
delay zero. The reference PDP plots from Table 8.2-1 and Table 8.2-2 are shown
in Figure 8.3.2.1-1.
**OTA antenna configuration:** For e.g. 1 full ring (or single cluster
configuration) of V polarized elements.

**Method of measurement for RTS:**
The vector signal generator repeatedly generates the Zadoff-Chu sequence as
defined in Table 8.3.2.1-3. After a given time interval, the spectrum analyser
or scope is triggered by the vector signal generator at the beginning of the
next Zadoff-Chu sequence. The time interval needs to exceed the required
minimum distance between two PDPs as defined in Table 8.3.2.1-4 and depends on
the centre frequency and the mobile speed.
After receiving the trigger signal, the spectrum analyser or scope starts with
the acquisition of the IQ data. The number of recorded IQ samples corresponds
to the length of the used Zadoff-Chu sequence. This step is repeated until at
least 1000 blocks of IQ samples are recorded.

The channel model specifications match those from Table 8.3.2.1-2.
**Method of measurement result analysis:**
The measured blocks of IQ samples are saved and later analysed by a post
processing SW, e.g., Matlab. The analysis is performed by applying the
circular cross-correlation between each recorded block of IQ samples and the
IQ samples of the original Zadoff-Chu sequence. The resulting impulse
responses h(t,tau) are averaged in power over time:
Finally the resulting PDP is shifted in delay and normalized in power, such
that the first tap is on delay zero and has a relative power of 0 dB.
**Antenna configurations:** For e.g. a pair of vertically oriented sleeve
dipoles or vertically polarized horn antennas.
#### 8.3.2.2 Doppler/Temporal correlation
This measurement checks the Doppler/temporal correlation.
**Method of measurement:**
Sine wave (CW, carrier wave) signal is transmitted from the signal generator.
The signal is connected from the signal generator to fading emulator via
cables. The fading emulator output signals are connected to power amplifier
boxes via cables. The amplified signals are then transferred via cables to the
probe antennas. The probe antennas radiate the signals over the air to the
test antenna The Doppler spectrum is measured by the spectrum analyzer and the
trace is saved.

Method of measurement result analysis: Measurement data file (Doppler power
spectrum) is saved into hard drive.\ The data is read into, e.g., Matlab.\ The
analysis is performed by taking the Fourier transformation of the Doppler
spectrum.\ The resulting temporal correlation function is normalized such that
.\ Then the function values left from the maximum is cut out.\ Further on the
function values after, e.g. seven periods is cut out.\ The reference temporal
correlation plots from Table 8.2-1 and 8.2-2 are shown in Figure 8.3.2.2-1 and
Figure 8.3.2.2-2.

#### 8.3.2.3 Spatial correlation
This measurement checks whether the measured correlation curve follows the
theoretical curve.
**Method of measurement:**
Step the emulation and store traces from VNA. I.e. run the emulation to CIR
number 1, pause, measure VNA traces in 11 different DUT positions, run the
emulation to CIR number 10, pause, measure VNA traces in 11 different DUT
positions, ... etc. Continue until frequency response of 1000 CIRs in 11
positions (=1000*11 VNA traces) are measured.
11 test antenna positions sample a segment of line of length 1 wavelength with
sampling interval of 0.1 wavelengths. Antenna spacing (wave lengths): -0.5 to
+0.5 step of 0.1.

samples. The procedure is to correlate sixth column (the trace measured at the
centre of chamber) with the 10 other columns as follows (Matlab example)
> for ind = 1:11;
>
> Corr(: , : , ind) = abs(corrcoef(**H**(: , 1),**H**(: , ind)));

**Measurement antenna:** For e.g. Sleeve dipole.
Figure 8.3.2.3-2: Reference Spatial Correlation Functions for\ SCME Urban
Macro / SCME Urban Micro plotted from Table 8.2-1 and Table 8.2-2
For RTS, spatial correlation is verified using the setup in Figure 8.3.1.2-2.
The channel emulator is configured for a MIMO channel model with two transmit
and two receive antenna patterns. The transmit antennas are assumed to be
dual-polarized equal power elements with a fixed 0λ separation, 45 degrees
slanted, Clause 8.5, while the two receiver antennas are configured as
vertically polarized dipoles with varying antenna separation. The antenna
positions sample a line of length 1λ with a sampling interval of 0.1λ. Both
antennas and the respective patterns are simulated in the channel emulator.

The channel model specifications match those from Table 8.3.2.3-2.
**Measurement Process:**
For each antenna position, the signal generator continuously sends the Zadoff-
Chu sequence to the channel emulator which applies the required channel model
as specified in Table 8.3.2.3-2. The output RF signal from the channel
emulator is connected to the TX antenna and received by the RX antenna which
is connected to the RF input of the spectrum analyser or scope, Figure
8.3.1.2-2.
The RF signals received by the RX antenna for different simulated antenna
positions/separations are captured by the spectrum analyser or the scope. The
spatial correlation analysis is performed by performing the cross-correlation
operation directly on the received signals captured for different antenna
positions/separations.
#### 8.3.2.4 Cross-polarization
This measurement checks how well the measured vertically or horizontally
polarized power levels follow expected values.
**Method of measurement:** Step the emulation and store traces from VNA.

**Measurement Procedure**
1\. Play or step through the channel model -> SCME UMi, or UMa X Corr.
2\. Measure the absolute power received at the center of the array, averaged
over a statistically significant number of fades.
a. Use a vertically polarized sleeve dipole to measure the V component.
b. Use a horizontally polarized (vertically oriented) magnetic loop dipole, or
a horizontally polarized sleeve dipole measured in two orthogonal horizontal
positions and summed to measure the H component.
3\. Calculate the V/H ratio.
4\. Compare it with the theory -> 0.74dB for UMi, and 8.13dB for UMa.
**Expected measurement results**
V/H ratio (composite, i.e. all 6 paths combined) of the 3GPP SCME Umicro model
is 0.74 dB and for Umacro 8.13 dB.\ The BS antennas are isotropic dipoles with
+/- 45 degrees slant and subject to a foreshortening of the slanted radiating
element. See channel model details specified in clause 8.2.
For RTS, the cross-polarization is verified using the setup in Figure
8.3.1.2-2. The channel emulator is configured for a MIMO channel model with
two transmit and two receive antenna patterns. The transmit antenna patterns
are assumed to be dual-polarized equal power elements with a fixed 0λ
separation, 45 degrees slanted, Clause 8.5. One simulated receive antenna is
configured as an ideal dipole with vertical polarization, and the other one is
configured as ideal dipole with horizontal polarization. Both antennas have a
fixed 0λ separation.
This cross polarization measurement verifies the correct power ratio of the
different polarizations in the channel model. The measurement can be
accomplished by either using a physical transmit and receive antenna with a
single polarization while alternately changing the RX antenna polarization
configuration in the fading emulator or by using physical dual-polarized
antennas with high isolation between the two polarizations of the transmit and
receive antennas. Both approaches guarantee that only the cross polarization
of the channel model is verified.
**Channel model specification:**
The channel model specifications match those from Table 8.3.2.4-2.
**Measurement Procedure**
1\. Play the channel model defined in Table 8.3.2.4-2.
2\. Measure the absolute power received at the RX antenna, averaged over a
statistically sufficient number of fades (defined as channel model samples in
Table 8.3.2.4-2).
a. Measure the power intended for the vertically polarized receive antenna to
measure the V component.
b. Measure the power intended for the horizontally polarized receive antenna
to measure the H component.
3\. Calculate the V/H ratio.
Theoretical and expected measurement results are the same as MPAC.
### 8.3.3 Reporting
The tolerance for the channel model measurements is defined in tables 8.3.3-2,
8.3.3-3, 8.3.3-4 and 8.3.3-5.
These tolerances are based on what can practically be measured for each metric
in order that pass/fail limits can be defined for validation of acceptable
channel model implementation. Studies of the impact on non-ideal channel model
implementation have not been carried out and therefore it may be necessary in
the future when a better understanding of the impact of the channel model
implementation on throughput measurements is found, that these tolerance
values may need to be revised.

## 8.5 Channel Model emulation of the Base Station antenna pattern
configuration
Editor\'s Note: To include the agreed X-polarized method. Any additional
approach would need to be clearly specified.
The emulated BS antennas to be used for all emulation of the channel models
defined in subclause 8.2 shall be assumed to be dual polarized equal power
elements with a fixed 0λ separation, 45 degrees slanted.
The slant 45 degree antenna is an \"X\" configuration and is modelled as an
ideal dipole with isotropic gain and subject to a foreshortening of the
slanted radiating element, which is observed to vary as a function of the path
angle of departure. This foreshortening with AoD is a typical slanted dipole
behaviour and is a source of power variation in the channel model. The
effective antenna pattern for this antenna is illustrated in Figure 8.5-1.

### 9.3.1 The Absolute Data Throughput Comparison Framework
#### 9.3.1.1 Introduction
In an effort to compare different MIMO OTA methodologies\' results to
conducted results under the implementations of channel models defined in
clause 8.2, the absolute data throughput comparison framework has been
defined.\ By utilizing the reference antennas (clause 9.1) and reference
devices (clause 9.2), this framework shall be used to compare each MIMO OTA
testing method\'s ability to emulate the specified network and channel
propagation characteristics based on an absolute data throughput metric.
The framework consists of a set of conducted (Figure 9.3.1.1-1) and radiated
(Figure 9.3.1.1-2) measurements of MIMO throughput (clause 5.1.1). The details
for the application of this framework are described in clause 9.3.1.6.
Figure 9.3.1.1-1: Method of measuring the conducted absolute throughput
reference performance
Figure 9.3.1.1-2: Method of measuring the absolute radiated data throughput
metric\ with the reference antennas
The following subclauses define the antenna pattern data format, emulation of
antenna pattern rotation, absolute data throughput measurement enabler, and
the output data format.
#### 9.3.1.2 Antenna pattern data format
The antenna pattern data format---used in the conducted portion of the
measurements --- shall be in the 3D AAU format as defined by COST IC1004 [14].
Table 9.3.1.2-1 and 9.3.1.2-2 below illustrates the header structure with a

Based on experiments taken with low (\1.8GHz) frequency band
antennas, the magnitude of the complex correlation coefficient generated from
measured data remains unchanged from higher resolution antenna pattern
measurements up to 15 degrees resolution in theta and phi orientations. To
align with current COST IC1004 TWGO MIMO OTA topic group proposed resolution
for 3D MIMO OTA complex radiation pattern measurements, the antenna pattern
measurement step size in theta and phi shall be no more than 5 degrees. In the
specific case of 2D measurements theta is fixed at 90 degrees.
#### 9.3.1.3 Emulation of antenna pattern rotation
For the conducted portion of the absolute data throughput framework, it is
necessary to generate the spatially filtered channel impulse response per
polarization and then combine to generate the emulated channel impulse
response coefficients. The measured antenna pattern shall be interpolated to
match the spatial resolution of the angles of arrival of the SCME channel
emulator (this value is typically 1 degrees). Figure 9.3.1.3-1 below
illustrates an example of this procedure using a simplified antenna pattern
and channel PAS.
Figure 9.3.1.3-1: Rotation of antenna pattern over azimuth positions
In general, the emulation of antenna pattern rotation is specific to the
channel model. For 2D channel models antenna pattern rotation shall be
performed over 360 degrees in 30 degree steps (12 total positions). For other
channel models this process is FFS.
A spatial filtering operation alone does not capture the behaviour of the 2D
channel model as a function of DUT rotation. Figure 9.3.1.3-2 below
illustrates the geometric parameters of the 2D channel model [15] for two DUT
rotations.
a)
b)
Figure 9.3.1.3-2: (a) 2D channel model geometric parameters for MS array
direction = 0 degrees;\ (b) MS array direction = 60 degrees
For a given rotation of the DUT, the angle of the MS array relative to the
cluster angles of arrival changes. Thus, MS array rotation together with the
spatial filtering operations described above is necessary to emulate the
conducted portion of the framework properly. Doppler spread, which is a
function of the MS direction of travel relative to the channel model
clusters\' angles of arrival, shall remain the same for all rotations of the
DUT.
Calculation of the required spatial filtering operations as a function of DUT
orientation for channel emulators using a geometric implementation is self-
evident from Figures 9.3.1.3-1 and 9.3.1.3-2. For channel emulators
implementing the alternative correlation-based approach, the same spatial
filtering operations are carried out by computing the correlation matrix and
power imbalance for the specific channel model used and then applying the
calculated correlation matrix and power in the channel emulation. The detail
for how this is done is considered implementation specific and is not
elaborated further here. It is noted that the correlation implementation
results in a Doppler spectrum and corresponding temporal correlation that is
independent of DUT orientation.
This process may be automated with channel emulator control software or
performed manually. The output data format is described in clause 9.3.1.5.
#### 9.3.1.4 Absolute Data Throughput measurement enabler
The fundamental enabler for the adoption of the Absolute Data Throughput
metric is the ability to apply the complex radiation pattern to the channel
for the conducted portion of the test. Such conducted measurements can be
performed manually; however, without an application (SW) to rotate the loaded
antenna complex radiation pattern, the measurement may become very time
consuming and prone to human errors. Automation of this process is highly
recommended.
#### 9.3.1.5 Output data format
A unified data format for recording the conducted and radiated test results by
each lab is defined in Tables 9.3.1.5-1 and 9.3.1.5-2 below.

#### 9.3.1.6 Application of the framework and scenarios for comparison
This framework is methodology agnostic, and shall be used to compare each MIMO
OTA testing method\'s ability to emulate the specified network and channel
propagation characteristics based on an absolute data throughput metric
(Clause 5.1.1).
The purposes of this framework are:
\- For the agreed Channel Models, currently SCME Umi and Uma, to understand
and quantify what are the deviations (if any) introduced by the chamber used
in radiated mode compared to the conducted mode (when reference antennas are
embedded). This shall be applied inter labs for the same method and inter
methods.
\- For methods that are able to reproduce channel models that are not agreed
in the present document, it can be used to define the channel model details
that need to be injected in the conducted test to obtain same results in the
radiated part. And therefore it is easier to reproduce those conditions across
methods.
The above use cases for the framework are required to be conducted for inter
methodology comparison.\ Other applications for the framework are optional and
not excluded.
And more concretely, the following scenarios for comparison are defined:
Figure 9.3.1.6-1: Application of the framework and scenarios for comparison
These scenarios are intended to address the following aspects:
1\. **The first scenario** , anechoic based: intended to compare the conducted
portion of the test (with embedded radiation pattern antennas) with the same
results of the radiated test.\ Throughputs are compared to understand any
artifacts introduced by the setup.
2\. **The second scenario** , reverberation based: intended to compare the
conducted portion of the test (with embedded radiation pattern antennas) with
the same results of the radiated test.\ Throughputs are compared to understand
any artifacts introduced by the setup.
3\. **The third scenario** , reverberation based: intended to compare the
conducted portion of the test (with embedded radiation pattern antennas) and
with 3D isotropic channel model with the same results of the radiated test.\
Throughputs are compared to understand any artifacts introduced by the setup.\
Additionally this scenario will help to define the 3D isotropic properties of
the channel model as perceived by the UE in the reverb chamber, and compare
its realization in the conducted portion.
NOTE: If scenario2 holds true, it would mean that for the agreed setup
anechoic method and reverberation method provides comparable results for the
agreed channel models in the present document, currently 2D SCME.
#### 9.3.1.7 Proof of concept

### 10.2.2 Anechoic chamber method with multiprobe configuration
Inter-Lab/Inter-Technique (IL/IT) campaigns have been performed in CTIA MOSG
LTE MIMO OTA by the Anechoic Chamber test methodology. The results are
produced here in Figures 10.2.2-1 to 10.2.2-9.

Channel model\ for SATIMO
Further, from Figure 10.2.2-2, it can be noted that the max deviation between
the absolute data throughput and OTA measurements is around 1.5dB at 70%
throughput. This can be observed for the Good antenna system and SCME UMi case
with the absolute data throughput outperforming the OTA measurements. There is
also a deviation of around 1dB for the following case - SCME UMi with Nominal
antenna and SCME UMa B case with Good antenna.\ Very little deviation is noted
for the Bad antenna and both SCME UMi, and UMa B case.

## 10.3 3GPP harmonization test campaign
### 10.3.1 Description of the test plan
The objective of the harmonization measurement campaign is to capture
comparable data from the different MIMO OTA methodologies, whose procedures
are described in Clause 12, and to draw conclusions based on this data on the
ability to harmonize across two or more methodologies.
The free space (FS) testing condition is used in this measurement campaign.
1\. Eight device orientations are used for testing with the MPAC and RTS
methodologies. With the vertical portrait orientation defined as (0,0,0) of
(yaw, pitch, roll), these are:Portrait - (0°, 0°, roll)
2\. Portrait tilt down - (0°, -45°, roll)
3\. Portrait tilt up - (0°, 45°, roll)
4\. Face up - (0°, 90°, roll)
5\. Face down - (0°, -90°, roll)
6\. Landscape - (90°, 0°, roll)
7\. Landscape tilt down - (90°, -45°, roll)
8\. Landscape tilt up - (90°, 45°, roll),
where the roll is represented by the rotation around the turntable axis to
produce a single cut.
For MPAC and RTS methodologies **_a c_** omplete Throughput versus Power curve
is obtained over 12 azimuth angles per device orientation. The total number of
subframes (TNS) per power step is 20,000 to enable post-processing of the
result using the agreed FoM working assumptions.
For RC and RC+CE, device orientation is not applicable, but the following
other conditions apply. At least 100 samples and 400 subframes per power step
and sample (giving a total of 40,000 TNS per power step) are be measured to
enable post-processing of the results using the FoM working assumptions.
Additionally, an MU analysis on the TNS will be completed by measuring all the
devices with at least 100 samples and 20,000 subframes per power step and
sample (giving a total of TNS=2,000,000 per power step), with the aim of
validating the use of the small number of subframes through a comparison of
their final averaged outage values. Results for both stepwise and continuous
stirring modes are measured.
For any method, the power step is 0.5 dB from 95% down to 60%.
The following channel models are emulated by the different methodologies:
RC: NIST channel model (Table C.2-3)
RC+CE: Short delay spread low correlation (SDLC; Table C.2-1) and long delay
spread high correlation (LDHC; Table C.2-2)
MPAC: SCMe UMi (Table 8.2-1) and SCMe UMa (Table 8.2-2)
RTS: SCMe UMi (Table 8.2-1) and SCMe UMa (Table 8.2-2)
The following is the working assumption on the figure of merit to be used for
the analysis of harmonization testing campaign results:
Option 1: statistic of outages per throughput curve
Option 2: outage point from the average throughput curve
In addition to these procedures, each methodology also performs absolute data
throughput framework tests in order to derive the measurement uncertainty
bound for harmonization (as defined in Clause 10.3.3). The AC methodologies
utilize a single free space portrait 90⁰ device orientation, with the MIMO
reference antenna placed at 90⁰ elevation, and the RF enclosure door facing
the 0⁰ azimuth. The RC test methodologies conduct their measurements in
stepstirred mode only. The lab performing RC and RC+CE methodologies can
determine the optimal number of subframes per stirring state and per power
level for the ADTF analysis only. All methodologies use the channel models
defined in Clauses 8.2 and Annex C. ADTF results for each methodology, band,
and channel model include 5 conducted ADTF results and 5 radiated results. The
ADTF repeatability results for the MPAC methodology were impacted by
additional measurement uncertainty due to re-cabling and test system re-
configuration during the repeatability testing period.

### 10.3.3 Measurement uncertainty bound for harmonization
For the harmonization analysis of device set 3, the target cost of
harmonization, assuming 100% statistical significance of the sample size, is
set to be 1.5 dB. The measure of the statistical significance based on the
total number of devices used in determining the residuals is provided in Table
10.3.3-1 below.

For each option, each band, and each pair of methodologies (i.e. MPAC/RC,
MPAC/RC+CE, and MPAC/RTS), harmonization offsets are selected and
harmonization residuals are calculated. Table 10.3.4-2 below lists the
harmonized MU terms (h), within the parameters of each option. In this table
the inter-methodology offsets were optimized across the measurements obtained
from device set 1 and device set 2 at 70% throughput. For Option K the RC+CE
testing procedure utilized 120 stirring states with 400 subframes per stirring
state.

### 10.3.5a Harmonization outcome with device set 3
RAN4 has reviewed harmonization analyses and has drawn the following
conclusions regarding the MPAC/RC+CE harmonization outcome:
1\. For the TDD bands tested in the MPAC/RC+CE harmonization, the
harmonization cost varies between 0.37 and 0.60 dB. This harmonization cost is
within the lowest harmonization target for all TDD bands considering the
statistical significance. Because only 3 devices were used to determine the
offsets, harmonization between MPAC and RC+CE for Bands 38 and 41 should be
further investigated. Testing 5 more devices in the chosen TDD bands in Lab3
can help to evaluate the harmonization offsets and the harmonization cost for
TDD.
2\. For all FDD bands tested in the MPAC/RC+CE harmonization, the
harmonization cost varies between 1.19 and 2.58 dB; some bands exceed their
highest harmonization bound and, therefore, harmonization between MPAC and
RC+CE cannot be confirmed for all FDD bands based on the results available
from the harmonization testing campaign.
3\. The potential to harmonize in FDD has been observed by isolating devices
which have contributed to higher residual errors, particularly LNA-active
devices, defining the related applicability criteria, and investigating more
suitable RC+CE settings and harmonization formulas.
RAN4 has reviewed harmonization analyses and has drawn the following
conclusions regarding the MPAC/RTS harmonization outcome:
1\. For the FDD bands tested in the MPAC/RTS harmonization, the harmonization
cost varies between 0.5 and 0.92 dB. This harmonization cost is within the
harmonization target for all bands and, therefore, harmonization between MPAC
and RTS for Bands 13, 5, 3, and 7 can be confirmed.
2\. Considering the positive outcome of the MPAC/RTS harmonization analysis,
the following applicability criteria for the MPAC/RTS harmonization are
proposed based on the current understanding of the RTS methodology
capabilities:
a. The harmonized RTS system is a two probe system capable of measuring
devices with two Rx antennas. Devices with more Rx antennas are not supported.
b. The RTS method is only applicable to devices which do not change their
antenna pattern in response to the radio environment.
c. The RTS method requires device support for the antenna test function (ATF)
defined in TR 36.978. The ATF access of devices depends on the support of chip
vendors.
d. There are two methods defined for ATF access, L3 signalling or a vendor-
supplied device app. The devices used for harmonization were all modified to
install the special ATF application. Harmonization has been confirmed using
devices with the special ATF application. Harmonization for unmodified devices
using the L3 access has not been confirmed.
e. RTS is harmonized for FDD bands. TDD harmonization has not been evaluated.
f. Harmonization measurements for RTS were performed with correlation based
channel models; harmonization and channel model validation limits would need
to be confirmed for geometric based channel models.
### 10.3.5b Harmonization outcome with device set 4
In view of the applicability statements in subclause 10.3.5a relating to the
evaluation of L3 access and TDD, two further devices were evaluated.

supplied device app. Harmonization has been confirmed using devices with the
special ATF application and using the L3 access for both FDD and TDD.
e. RTS is harmonized for FDD and TDD bands.

TP is measured shall be -80 dBm/15 kHz. The starting RS EPRE level of the LTE
MIMO sensititivity level search does not need to be specified (NOTE 1)
NOTE 5: For devices that exhibit non-linear TP behaviour and that achieve
target throughput at multiple RF power levels, LTE MIMO sensititivity level is
chosen to be lowest measured DL power level which crosses the target
throughput level
2\. Rotate the UE around vertical axis of the test system by 30 degrees and

5\. Power on the UE.
6\. Set up the connection.
#### 12.2.6.2 Test procedure
The following steps shall be followed in order to evaluate MIMO OTA
performance of the DUT:
1\. Generate a test signal by the SS. The SS transmits the signal through the
test system to the DUT.
2\. Search for the minimum average DL RS ERPE (or SIR) level resulting in a
MIMO OTA throughput of at least 70 % of the maximum theoretical throughput.
The measurement procedure shall be based on sending a pre-defined number of
subframes for each throughput sample for each DL RS EPRE (or SIR) level. When
all samples have been collected for a specific DL RS EPRE (or SIR) level, the
procedure is repeated for other DL RS EPRE (or SIR) levels. Alternatively, the
search can be performed for each stirring combination and then average the RS
EPRE (or SIR) levels when all throughput samples have been collected.
NOTE 1: The initial RS EPRE (or SIR) can be set to the user\'s freely
selectable level.\ Recommended initial RS EPRE is found in Tables 7.1-1 and
7.1-2. For the SIR control tests, ensure that the default signal level is set
such that the target SIR values can be achieved when utilizing the SIR
validation procedure defined in clauses 5.1.2.2 and 5.1.2.3.
NOTE 2: To meet the throughput value target DL RS EPRE (or SIR) level can be
changed using user\'s freely selectable algorithm.
NOTE 3: The average throughput calculated from all samples collected for each
RS EPRE (or SIR) level is reported as the MIMO OTA throughput.
NOTE 4: The downlink RS EPRE (or SIR) step size shall be no more than 0.5 dB,
when RF power level is near the MIMO OTA throughput sensitivity level.
NOTE 5: Assuming that the default signal level meets the criteria in NOTE 1,
the interference level will be adjusted to achieve the target SIR.
3\. The minimum average DL RS EPRE (or SIR) level that results in a MIMO OTA
throughput of at least 70 % of the maximum theoretical throughput shall be
reported.

4\. Position the UE in the chamber according to Clause 12.3.3.
5\. Power on the UE.
6\. Set up the connection.
#### 12.3.6.2 Test procedure
The following steps shall be followed in order to evaluate MIMO OTA
performance of the DUT:
1\. Measure the DUT complex antenna pattern at a nominal -60 dBm downlink
power as described in subclause 6.3.1.3 first stage.
2\. Select an appropriate orientation from the measured antenna pattern and
establish a radiated MIMO connection to the DUT using the V and H probes as
described in subclause 6.3.1.3 second stage. Measure the transmission matrix
in the chamber and apply the inverse matrix to the MIMO signal. The DUT
orientation at which this is done is selected to optimize the achievable
isolation. The unknown gain of the DUT antennas represented by the absolute
accuracy of the RSAP measurement is then de-embedded from the measured antenna
pattern. This is done by comparing the RSAP measurement from the first stage
at the orientation being used in the second stage, to a second RSAP
measurement made in the second stage using a nominal signal of -60 dBm
adjusted by the uncorrected antenna gain for that orientation. The difference
in the RSAP measurements represents the true antenna gain for that
orientation.
3\. With the desired channel model applied, measure the isolation in dB
between each stream as seen by the DUT receiver and ensure it is at least 15
dB averaged over at least 200 RSAP measurements.
4\. Using the calibrated radiated connection validate monotonicity of the DUT
RSAP and RSARP measurements over the range -60 dB, to -80 dBm and +/- 180
degrees. The step size for RSAP shall be [1] dB and the step size for RSARP

###### ### Annex C: Other Environmental Test conditions for consideration
# C.1 Scope
**This annex contains non standard channel models which are described for
evaluation purposes.\ Approved channel models are described in Clause 4.2.**
# C.2 3D isotropic Channel Models
This clause proposes three 3D isotropic channel models. One of the models is
based on the NIST channel model and two of the models are based on the
temporal aspects and Base Station (BS) correlation properties of the SCME UMi
and SCME UMa channel models.
The proposed 3D isotropic channel models are not directly based on real life
operating conditions, rather, are an attempt to model the properties of the
reverberation chamber which has been shown to represent a statistically
isotropic environment provided sufficient averaging is performed using mode
stirring. The instantaneous conditions within the reverberation chamber are
not isotropic.
The following 3D isotropic model is based on the PDP and BS correlation of the
SCME Urban Micro-cell model with isotropic AoAs and modified XPR values and
Velocity.

The parameters of the channel models are the expected parameters for the MIMO
OTA channel models.\ However, the final channel model achieved for different
methods could be a combined effect of the chamber and the channel emulator.
The Rayleigh fading may be implementation specific. However, the fading can be
considered to be appropriate as long as the statistics of the generated
Rayleigh fading are within standard requirement on Rayleigh fading statistics.
# C.3 Verification of Channel Model implementations
Channel Models have been specified in Clause C.2.\ This clause describes the
MIMO OTA validation measurements, in order to ensure that the channel models
are correctly implemented and hence capable of generating the propagation
environment, as described by the model, within a test area. Measurements are
done mainly with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and a spectrum analyzer.
## C.3.1 Measurement instruments and setup
The measurement setup includes the following equipment:
Table C.3.1-1: Measurement equipment list for the verification procedure
Item Quantity Item
* * *
1 1 Channel Emulator 2 1 Signal Generator 3 1 Spectrum Analyzer 4 1 VNA 5 1
Electric Dipole 6 1 Wideband test antenna
### C.3.1.1 Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) setup
Most of the measurements are performed with a VNA. An example set of equipment
required for this set-up is shown in Figure C.3.1.1-1. VNA transmits frequency
sweep signals thorough the MIMO OTA test system.\ A test antenna, within the
test area, receives the signal and VNA analyzes the frequency response of the
system.\ A number of traces (frequency responses) are measured and recorded by
VNA and analyzed by a post processing SW, e.g., Matlab. Special care has to be
taken into account to keep the fading conditions unchanged, i.e. frozen,
during the short period of time of a single trace measurement. The fading may
proceed only in between traces. This setup can be used to measure PDP, BS
antenna correlation, Rayleigh fading and Isotropy of the Channel models
defined in Clause C.2.

channel emulator methods
Figure C.3.1.1-2: Setup for VNA measurements for reverberation chamber-only
methods
### C.3.1.2 Spectrum Analyzer (SA) setup
The Doppler spectrum is measured with a Spectrum Analyzer as shown in Figure
C.3.1.2-1. In this case a Signal generator transmits CW signal through the
MIMO OTA test system. The signal is received by a test antenna within the test
area. Finally the signal is analyzed by a Spectrum Analyzer and the measured
spectrum is compared to the target spectrum. This setup can be used to measure
Doppler Spectrum of the Channel models defined in Clause C.2.

channel emulator methods

methods
## C.3.2 Validation measurements
### C.3.2.1 Power Delay Profile (PDP)
This measurement checks that the resulting Power Delay Profile (PDP) is as
defined in the channel model.
**Method of measurement:**
Step the chamber stirring sequence and store traces from VNA measurements at
each step until the Number of Traces specified in Table C.3.2.1-1 is obtained.
For the RC+CE, also the channel model emulation will be stepped for each VNA
trace.
The VNA sampling should be such that independent samples of the channel model
impulse response are obtained. This is ensured if the effective distance
travelled by the UE between faded samples of the channel model is as defined
in the table below, regardless of the number of stirring positions in the
chamber stirring sequence. To accurately emulate the longest PDP duration _t_
~f~ of 5 μs, the relationship _N_ /Span = _t_ ~f~ must be satisfied.

**Method of measurement result analysis:**
Measured VNA traces (frequency responses H(t,f)) are saved into a hard drive.
The data is read into, e.g., Matlab.\ The analysis is performed by taking the
Fourier transform of each frequency response.\ The resulting impulse responses
h(t, _τ_) are averaged in power over time (or samples):
Finally the resulting PDP is shifted in delay, such that the first tap is on
delay zero.\ The reference PDP plots from Table C.2-1, Table C.2-2 and Table
C.2-3 are shown in Figure C.3.2.1-1.
In a reverberation chamber, when a channel emulator is not used and the PDP is
therefore an exponential decay, such as the NIST channel model, only the
inherent RMS Delay Spread of the reverberation chamber needs to be
calculated.\ The selection of the T _h~i~(t,τ)_ measurements has to be
performed when the absorber loading technique is used to tune the RMS DS in an
RC. Alternatively, the sample selection technique allows for selecting a
subset of M _h~i~(t,τ)_ measurements which provide the desired RMS DS, and in
this case the averaging has to be performed only over the selected subset of M
channel impulse responses.
The calculation of RMS delay spread is performed on the time domain data as
the square root of the second central moment of the PDP, that is:
Only PDP values above a threshold of -60 dB should be included in the
calculation of the RMS delay spread.
The expected RMS delay spread for the NIST channel model is 80 ns.
**OTA antenna configuration:** Fixed measurement source antenna.
**Measurement antenna:**
A suitable wideband test antenna.
**Tolerances:**
Performance bounds of (cluster power ±0.85dB and excess delay ±11ns).

### C.3.2.2 Doppler for 3D isotropic models
This measurement checks that the resulting is as defined in the channel model.
Doppler.**Method of measurement:**
For Doppler validation, two methods could be used to measure the Doppler
spectrum. The first uses a CW tone from the Signal Generator fed directly, or
via the channel emulator if used, to the fixed measurement antennas and is
recorded by the spectrum analyzer. For the second method, the input signal
from the VNA is fed directly, or via the channel emulator if used, to the
fixed measurement antennas of the chamber.
For the first method, a sine wave (CW, carrier wave) signal is transmitted
from the signal generator. The signal is connected from the signal generator
to the channel emulator via cables, or alternatively directly fed to the
chamber measurement antenna for the RC methodology. For the RC+CE methodology,
the channel emulator output signals are then transferred via cables to the
fixed measurement antennas (possibly via amplifiers). The fixed measurement
antennas radiate the signals over the air to the test antenna. The Doppler
spectrum is measured by the spectrum analyzer having the stirring sequence
and, if applicable, the channel emulation active and the trace is saved. The
signal generator and the spectrum analyzer reference oscillators should be
synchronized, in order to minimize frequency shift etc.
Alternatively, the Doppler spectrum can be measured with a VNA. Frequency
sweeps are measured with the VNA for a complete stirring sequence, thus
collecting samples of the chamber transfer function for each fixed stirrer
position . To get a correct estimate of the Doppler power spectrum, the
spatial distance between the stirrer positions should be small enough to
satisfy Nyquist theorem. is Fourier transformed according to
The Doppler spectrum can then be calculated using
The discrete Doppler power spectrum will now have a frequency axis ranging
from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of stirrer positions used. To convert
this into a Doppler frequency domain, the sampling theorem gives a frequency
axis in the interval [,], where
and the frequency step between each Doppler frequency sample is given by
is the time step between the measured samples.

where _c_ is the speed of light and _f~0~_ is the carrier frequency.

### C.3.2.3 Base Station antenna correlation for 3D isotropic models
This measurement checks that the resulting Base Station (BS) antenna
correlation follows the computed values from the channel parameters given in
tables C.2-1, C.2-2 and C.2-3.
**Method of measurement:**
For correlation validation, the input signal from the VNA is fed directly (for
table C.2.-3), or via the channel emulator (for tables C.2-1 and C.2-2), to
the fixed measurement antennas of the reverberation chamber.
Step the chamber stirring sequence and store traces from VNA measurements at
each step until the Number of Traces specified in Table C.3.2.3-1 is obtained.
For the RC+CE, also the channel model emulation will be stepped for each VNA
trace.
Each of the paths for the two transmit streams must be measured separately
using the procedure above. The samples for each path must be taken for the
exact same channel emulator and stirring positions.
The VNA sampling should be such that independent samples of the channel model
impulse response are obtained. This is ensured if the effective distance
travelled by the UE between faded samples of the channel model is as defined
in the table below.

Compute the correlation between two traces (e.g. S21 and S31) which represents
the correlation between two transmit streams. This correlation should match
that of the channel model used.
**OTA antenna configuration:** Fixed measurement source antennas.
**Measurement antenna:** A suitably wideband test antenna.
**Tolerances:**
The amplitude of the complex correlation averaged over the channel bandwidth
shall be within the interval 0.05 -- 0.2.
### C.3.2.4 Rayleigh fading
This measurement checks that the resulting fading of the MIMO OTA system is
Rayleigh as per the channel model.
**Method of measurement:**
For Rayleigh Fading validation, the input signal from the VNA is fed to one of
the two input ports of the channel emulator and further to the fixed
measurement transmit antennas of the reverberation chamber. The same stirring
sequence, number of active CE output ports, channel model and CE channel model
emulation as used for the DUT measurement, as well as the chamber loading used
for the DUT measurement and PDP validation, should be used for the validation
measurement.
In order to achieve statistical significance, the number of samples should be
>1000\. If the DUT stirring sequence has less than 1000 steps, the number of
measurements shall be increased proportionaly without altering the fading
envelope distribution. This is done reducing the CE IR, and the stirring step
by dividing them by an N value such as the resultant number of measurements
will be > 1000 while keeping the same amplitude distribution. e.g. if the
stiring sequence has 120 steps, and for every measurement the stirrers move
equally 9 degrees, then using N = 9 for 1080 samples will result in changing
the stirring sequence to 1 degree per measurement for all the stirrers, and
dividing the IR step by 9\. If needed, the IR should be rounded to the closest
integer.
Step the chamber stirring sequence and store traces from VNA measurements at
each step until the Number of Traces specified in Table C.3.2.4-1 is obtained.
For the RC+CE, also the channel model emulation will be stepped for each VNA
trace.
The VNA sampling should be such that independent samples of the channel model
impulse response are obtained. This is ensured if the effective distance
travelled by the UE between faded samples of the channel model is as defined
in the table below.
The procedure described above shall be performed in two of the extreme test
volume validation positions (TVVPs) defined in Annex G. Observe that each TVVP
consists of three orientations, which means that in total 6 Rayleigh
validation measurements shall be performed and the results from each of these
measurements shall pass the limits. The same stirring sequence, number of
active CE output ports, channel model and CE channel model emulation shall be
used at each of the chosen TVVPs.

**Method of Measurement Results Analysis**
The primary performance criterion to evaluate Rayleigh fading is the
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the received signal amplitude (x) at
the DUT. CDF describes the probability of a signal level being less than the
CDF parameter. The CDF of x in a set of measured samples in a reverberation
chamber is defined as,
Figure C.3.2.4-1: Reference Rayleigh distribution
The difference between the measured histogram of CDF (also known as empirical
CDF, ECDF) and ideal histogram is computed within the framework of the Chi-
Square test [3] to determine if the chamber provides a Rayleigh fading. The
Chi-Square test is a purely statistical test for determining if the observed
data ECDF follows the theoretic CDF. The Chi-Square test is performed as
follows [21].
1\. Partition the measured sample space (N samples) into K disjoint intervals
(bins).
2\. Calculate the number mi of samples that fall in each of these intervals.
This is a measure of the probability that the outcome will fall in that
interval.
3\. Compare the Rayleigh CDF obtained from the measured data to the
theoretical probability distribution using the Chi-Square test.
The Chi-Square statistic is defined as the "weighted square error" and is
given by
Here, N is the number of samples, pi is the theoretical probability of landing
in the bin with index i, and mi is the measured number of samples in the bin
with index i. K=15 shall be used for the validation. The theoretical value pi
is given in Table C.3.2.4-3 below.
Due to the statistical variations of the chi-squared value, the final reported
value should be obtained by averaging the chi-squared values obtained for each
frequency point in the signal bandwidth. This averaged value should be
compared to the limit.

distribution with 15 bins

Note: These limits are given as Watt ratios.
According to [22], a chi-squared value less than or equal to 27.69 will mean
that the numbers are Rayleigh distributed (1% significance level).
It also needs to be verified that there is no strong LOS component present.
This is done by evaluating the ratio of the direct path component to the
scattered component (also known as K-factor). If there is no direct component
present, then K = 0, K = -∞ dB.
The maximum allowed K-factor is -10dB, anything higher than will be considered
a failure.

**Measurement antenna:** A suitably wideband test antenna.
### C.3.2.5 Isotropy for 3D isotropic models
This measurement checks that the resulting received signal characteristics are
statistically spatially isotropic.
**Method of measurement:**
For isotropic validation, the input signal from the VNA is fed directly, or
via the channel emulator, to the fixed measurement antennas of the
reverberation chamber. If a channel emulator is used, it has to be placed in
Bypass mode where no fading is used. An electric dipole is placed on the turn
table.\ Three orthogonal components of the electric field are recorded with
the dipole in three different orientations. The same stirring sequence as used
for the DUT measurement, as well as the chamber loading used for the DUT
measurement and PDP validation, should be used for the validation measurement.
Step the chamber stirring sequence and store traces from VNA measurements at
each step until the Number of Traces specified in Table C.3.2.5-1 is obtained.
Repeat this procedure with the dipole in all three orthogonal orientations.
**VNA settings:**

**Method of Measurement Results Analysis**
Compute and evaluate the anisotropy coefficients from the measured data as
described in [2]. Using S parameters, the anisotropy coefficient that employs
two orientations may be given as
A~pq~(n) = (\|S~21~,~p~(n)\|^2^-\| S~21~,~q~(n)\|^2^)/(\| S~21~,~p~(n)\|^2^+\|
S~21~,~q~(n)\|^2^),
where p \ χ^2^=Σ(M~k~-Np~k~)^2^/(Np~k~).
The summation over bins goes from k=1 to K.
Due to the statistical variations of the chi-squared value, the final reported
value should be obtained by averaging the chi-squared values obtained for each
frequency point in the signal bandwidth. This averaged value should be
compared to the limit.

According to [22], a chi-squared value less than or equal to 21.67 will mean
that the 2 orientation anisotropy coefficients, Apq(n), are uniformly
distributed as expected (1% significance level). For the Total anisotropy
coefficients, Atot(n), a chi-squared value less than or equal to 23,21 will
mean that the there is no significant difference from the ideal reference (1%
significance level).

# C.4 Channel model validation results
Channel models have been specified in clause C.2.\ This clause describes the
MIMO OTA validation measurements, in order to ensure that the channel models
are correctly implemented and hence capable of generating the propagation
environment, as described by the model, within a test area. Measurements are
done mainly with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and a spectrum analyzer.
