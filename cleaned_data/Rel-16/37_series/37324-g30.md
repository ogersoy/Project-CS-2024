# 4 General
## 4.1 Introduction
The objective is to describe the SDAP architecture and the SDAP entity from a
functional point of view. The specified functionality only applies to UE with
connection to the 5G-CN and UE in NR sidelink communication.
## 4.2 SDAP architecture
### 4.2.1 SDAP structure
Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates one possible structure for the SDAP sublayer; it
should not restrict implementation. The figure is based on the radio interface
protocol architecture defined in TS 38.300 [2].
Figure 4.2.1-1: SDAP sublayer, structure view
The SDAP sublayer is configured by RRC (TS 38.331 [3]). The SDAP sublayer maps
QoS flows to DRBs. One or more QoS flows may be mapped onto one DRB. One QoS
flow is mapped onto only one DRB at a time in the UL.
In NR sidelink communication, the SDAP sublayer maps PC5 QoS flows to SL-DRBs.
One or more PC5 QoS flows may be mapped onto one SL-DRB. One PC5 QoS flow is
mapped onto only one SL-DRB at a time in the NR sidelink for transmission.
### 4.2.2 SDAP entities
The SDAP entities are located in the SDAP sublayer. Several SDAP entities may
be defined for a UE. There is an SDAP entity configured for each individual
PDU session for NR Uu. For NR sidelink, SDAP entity is configured per
Destination Layer-2 ID and cast type in the UE.
An SDAP entity receives/delivers SDAP SDUs from/to upper layers and
submits/receives SDAP data PDUs to/from its peer SDAP entity via lower layers.
\- At the transmitting side, when an SDAP entity receives an SDAP SDU from
upper layers, it constructs the corresponding SDAP data PDU and submits it to
lower layers;
\- At the receiving side, when an SDAP entity receives an SDAP data PDU from
lower layers, it retrieves the corresponding SDAP SDU and delivers it to upper
layers.
Figure 4.2.2-1 illustrates the functional view of the SDAP entity for the SDAP
sublayer; it should not restrict implementation. The figure is based on the
radio interface protocol architecture defined in TS 38.300 [2].
Figure 4.2.2-1: SDAP layer, functional view
Reflective QoS flow to DRB mapping is performed at UE, as specified in the
clause 5.3.2, if DL SDAP header is configured.
For NR sidelink communication, reflective PC5 QoS flow to SL-DRB mapping is
not supported.
## 4.3 Services
### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers
The SDAP sublayer provides its service to the user plane upper layers. The
following services are provided by SDAP to upper layers:
\- transfer of user plane data.
### 4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers
An SDAP entity expects the following services from lower layers:
\- user plane data transfer service;
\- in-order delivery except when out of order delivery is configured by RRC
(TS 38.331 [3]).
## 4.4 Functions
The SDAP sublayer supports the following functions:
\- transfer of user plane data;
\- mapping between a QoS flow and a DRB for both DL and UL;
\- mapping between a PC5 QoS flow and a SL-DRB for NR sidelink communication;
\- marking QoS flow ID in both DL and UL packets;
\- marking PC5 QoS flow ID in unicast of NR sidelink communication packets;
\- reflective QoS flow to DRB mapping for the UL SDAP data PDUs.

## 6.1 Protocol data units

The SDAP Data PDU is used to convey one or more of followings:
\- SDAP header;
\- user plane data.
### 6.1.2 Control PDU
a) End-Marker Control PDU
End-Marker control PDU is used by the SDAP entity at UE to indicate that it
stops the mapping of the SDAP SDU of the QoS flow indicated by the QFI/PQFI to
the DRB/SL-DRB on which the End-Marker control PDU is transmitted.
## 6.2 Formats
### 6.2.1 General
A SDAP PDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in
length. In the figures in clause 6.2, bit strings are represented by tables in
which the first and most significant bit is the left most bit of the first
line of the table, the last and least significant bit is the rightmost bit of
the last line of the table, and more generally the bit string is to be read
from left to right and then in the reading order of the lines.
SDAP SDUs are bit strings that are byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in
length. An SDAP SDU is included into a SDAP PDU from the first bit onward.
For groupcast and broadcast of NR sidelink communication, only SDAP data PDU
without SDAP header is supported.
### 6.2.2 Data PDU
#### 6.2.2.1 Data PDU without SDAP header
