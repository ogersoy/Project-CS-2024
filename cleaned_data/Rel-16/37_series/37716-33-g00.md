# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for Dual Connectivity (EN-DC) with
3 bands DL and 3 bands UL under Rel-16 time frame. It covers both the UE and
BS side. The document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination)
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.
# 5 EN-DC with 3 bands DL and 3 bands UL: General Part
## 5.1 General treatment of ∆TIB and ∆RIB values
For the 3 bands DL and 3 bands UL EN-DC band combination, RAN4 should consider
to reuse agreed additional insertion losses for all EN-DC band combinations
when new RF components are not introduced to support this basket WI. If the
new RF components are introduced, then more detail decription will be captured
in some specific EN-DC band combinations.
In the 3 bands DL and 3 bands UL EN-DC combination, at least one NR FR2 band
is included, which means the other two bands can be LTE 2 bands or LTE 1 band
+ NR 1 FR1 band. It shall be noted that the inter-band EN-DC combination with
all the 3UL FR1 bands is excluded since the corresponding RF requirements have
not been finished yet.
Unless otherwise stated, for inter-band 3 bands DL and 3 bands UL EN-DC
configurations including FR2,there are no additional requirements of and
∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values for NR FR2 band, which means ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ for
constituent FR2 NR bands is set to zero.
For Inter-band EN-DC with LTE 2 band+NR 1 band (i.e. NR 1 FR2 band):
\- ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ for constituent E-UTRA bands is the same as those for
the corresponding E-UTRA inter-band CA configuration specified in TS 36.101.
For Inter-band EN-DC with LTE 1 band+NR 2 bands (i.e. NR 1 FR1 band + NR 1 FR2
band):
\- ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ for E-UTRA and FR1 NR band is the same as those for
the corresponding inter-band EN-DC combinations specified in TS 38.101-3.
## 5.2 Maximum Sensitivity Degradation (MSD) analysis
5.2.1 MSD caused by Harmonic product
The harmonic product analysis for the inter-band EN-DC combination within FR1
and including FR2 have been captured in the TRs, such as TR 37.716-11-11 and
37.716-21-11. Considering:
\- the frequency between E-UTRA band and NR FR2 band are very large, and the
NR FR2 band frequency is larger than 3^rd^ harmonic frequencies (even 7^th^
harmonic frequencies) of all E-UTRA band, which means the NR FR2 band will not
be impacted by the harmonic products of the E-UTRA band.
\- the NR FR2 band frequency is larger than 3^rd^ harmonic frequencies of all
NR FR1 band, which means the NR FR2 band will not be impacted by the 3^rd^
harmonic products of the NR FR1 band.
Therefore, unless otherwise stated, for inter-band 3 bands DL and 3 bands UL
EN-DC configurations including FR2, there are no MSD requirements caused by
harmonic products for constituent FR2 NR band, and MSD caused by harmonic
products for constituent E-UTRA and NR FR1 bands are the same as those for the
corresponding E-UTRA inter-band CA in TS36.101 or inter band EN-DC
configuration without the FR2 bands in TS38.101-3, respectively.
5.2.2 MSD caused by intermodulation products
There are two types intermodulation frequencies for 3 bands UL configuration,
the first one is choosing desirable UL band configurations for each use
scenarios (i.e. 2UL intermodulation frequencies), and the second one is all
the possible intermodulation frequencies occur while all three UL's are active
concurrently (i.e. 3UL intermodulation frequencies).
For the first type intermodulation frequencies, the study for 2UL
intermodulation frequencies have been captured in TR 37.716-21-11 and TR
37.716-21-21, especially for the 2UL band configuration of E-UTRA band and NR
FR1 band. It is no need to recalculate the 2UL frequencies intermudulation
products forinter-band 3 bands DL and 3 bands EN-DC combinations.
For the second type intermodulation frequencies, on top of 2UL intermodulation
frequencies, some additional intermodulation frequencies shall be studied for
all three UL frequencies are active concurrently for inter-band 3UL EN-DC
conbination, which is shown in Table 5.2.2-1.
Table 5.2.2-1. intermodulation frequencies all three UL frequencies are active
concurrently

Considering the larger frequency difference between FR1 band and FR2 band, it
can be foreseen that the IMDs product caused by FR1 band and FR2 band will not
fall into its own Rx band. Hence, it is no need to calculate the IMDs product
in table 5.2.2-1 for inter-band EN-DC combinations including FR2 band.
Therefore, unless otherwise stated, for inter-band 3 bands DL and 3 bands UL
EN-DC configurations including FR2, there are no MSD requirements caused by
intermodulation products for constituent FR2 NR band, and MSD caused by
intermodulation products caused by harmonic products for constituent E-UTRA
and NR FR1 bands are the same as those for the corresponding E-UTRA inter-band
CA in TS36.101 or inter band EN-DC configuration without the FR2 bands in
TS38.101-3.
5.3 Spurious emission band UE co-existence
Unless otherwise stated, for inter-band 3 bands DL and 3 bands UL EN-DC
configurations including FR2, there are no additional requirements of spurious
emission band UE co-existence.
For Inter-band EN-DC with LTE 2 band+NR 1 band (i.e. NR 1 FR2 band):
\- For spurious emission band UE co-existence, no requirements for FR2 NR
bands to protect E-UTRAbands are applied to the constituent FR2 NR bands.
Spurious emission band UE co-existence requirements specified in TS 36.101 are
applied to the constituent E-UTRA bands..
For Inter-band EN-DC with LTE 1 band+NR 2 bands (i.e. NR 1 FR1 band + NR 1 FR2
band):
\- Spurious emission band UE co-existence requirements for constituent E-UTRA
and FR1 NR bands for the inter-band EN-DC are the same as those for the
corresponding EN-DC configuration without the FR2 bands specified in
TS38.101-3.
