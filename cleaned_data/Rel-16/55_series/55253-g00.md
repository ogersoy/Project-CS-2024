# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR
21.905 [1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if
any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
# 4 Introductory information
## 4.1 Introduction
The confidentiality algorithm GEA5 is a stream cipher that is used to
encrypt/decrypt blocks of data under a confidentiality key KC128. The block of
data may be between 1 and 65536 octets long. The algorithm uses SNOW 3G [2] as
a keystream generator
The integrity algorithm GIA5 computes a 32-bit MAC (Message Authentication
Code) of a given input message using an integrity key KI128. The approach
adopted uses SNOW 3G.
## 4.2 Notation
### 4.2.1 Radix
The prefix \"0x\" is used to indicate hexadecimal numbers.
### 4.2.2 Conventions
The assignment operator \"=\", is used as in several programming languages.
So:
\ = \
means that \ assumes the value that \ had before
the assignment took place. For instance:
_x_ = _x_ \+ _y_ \+ 3
means:
(new value of _x_) becomes (old value of _x_) + (old value of _y_) + 3.
### 4.2.3 Bit/Byte ordering
All data variables in the present document are presented with the most
significant bit (or byte) on the left hand side and the least significant bit
(or byte) on the right hand side. Where a variable is broken down into a
number of sub-strings, the left most (most significant) sub-string is numbered
0, the next most significant is numbered 1 and so on through to the least
significant.
For example an n-bit MESSAGE is subdivided into 64-bit substrings
MB~0~,MB~1~...MB~i~ so for a message:
0x0123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA987654321086545381AB594FC28786404C50A37...
is:
MB~0~ = 0x0123456789ABCDEF\ MB~1~ **=** 0xFEDCBA9876543210\ MB~2~ =
0x86545381AB594FC2\ MB~3~ = 0x8786404C50A37...
In binary this would be:
000000010010001101000101011001111000100110101011110011011110111111111110...
with
**MB~0~** = 0000000100100011010001010110011110001001101010111100110111101111\
**MB~1~ =** 1111111011011100101110101001100001110110010101000011001000010000\
**MB~2~** = 1000011001010100010100111000000110101011010110010100111111000010\
**MB~3~** = 1000011110000110010000000100110001010000101000110111...
## 4.3 List of Variables
CONSTANT-F a 32-bit parameter which is constant for any given FRAMETYPE input.
DIRECTION the 1-bit input to both the GEA5 and GIA5 functions indicating the
direction of transmission (uplink or downlink).
FRAMETYPE an 8-bit input to the GEA5 and GIA5 functions indicating the type of
frame to be protected.
INPUT the 32-bit time variant input to the GEA5 function.
INPUT-I the 32-bit time variant input to the GIA5 function.
KC128 the 128-bit confidentiality key.
KI128 the 128-bit integrity key.
KS[i] the ith bit of keystream produced by the keystream generator.
L the number of 32-bit words of SNOW 3G keystream that are generated by GEA5
(equal to M / 4 ).
LENGTH a 64 bit parameter defined within GIA5 which specifies the number of
bits of message to be MAC\'d (equal to 8 times M).
M the input to the GEA5 function which specifies the number of octets of
output required (1-65536); also the input to the GIA5 function which specifies
the number of octets of message to be MAC\' (1-65536).
MAC the 32-bit message authentication code (MAC) produced by the integrity
function GIA5.
MESSAGE the input bitstream of LENGTH bits that is to be processed by the GIA5
function.
OUTPUT the output octets from the GEA5 function.
S1, S2, ... a sequence of 64-bit words derived from MESSAGE and LENGTH which
is used within GIA5 to construct the MAC.
z1, z2, ... the 32-bit words forming the keystream sequence of SNOW 3G. The
word produced first is z1, the next word z2 and so on.
