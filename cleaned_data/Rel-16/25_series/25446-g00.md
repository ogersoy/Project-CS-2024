# 4 General
## 4.1 General aspects for the SYNC protocol for UTRAN
### 4.1.1 General aspects
The MBMS Synchronisation protocol (SYNC) is located in the User plane of the
Radio Network layer over the Iu interface: the Iu UP protocol layer.
The SYNC protocol for UTRAN is used to convey user data associated to MBMS
Radio Access Bearers.
One SYNC protocol instance is associated to one MBMS RAB and one MBMS RAB
only. If several MBMS RABs are established towards one given UE, then these
MBMS RABs make use of several SYNC protocol instances.
SYNC protocol instances exist at Iu access point as defined (TS 25.410 [2])
i.e. at CN and UTRAN.
Whenever an MBMS RAB requires transfer of user data in the Iu UP, an Iu UP
protocol instance exists at each Iu interface access points. These Iu UP
protocol instances are established and released together with the associated
MBMS RAB.
The following figure illustrates the logical placement of the SYNC protocol
layer and the placement of the Data Streams sources outside of the Access
Stratum.
Figure 4.1.1-1: SYNC protocol layer occurrence in UTRAN overall architecture
(User Plane View)
## 4.2 General aspects for the SYNC protocol for E-UTRAN
### 4.2.1 General aspects
The MBMS Synchronisation protocol (SYNC) is located in the User plane of the
Radio Network layer over the M1 interface: the M1 UP protocol layer.
The SYNC protocol for E-UTRAN is used to convey user data associated to MBMS
Radio Access Bearers.
One SYNC protocol instance is associated to one MBMS E-RAB and one MBMS E-RAB
only.
SYNC protocol instances exist at M1 access point as defined (TS 36.440 [5])
i.e. at EPC and E-UTRAN.
Whenever an MBMS E-RAB requires transfer of user data in the M1 UP, an M1 UP
protocol instance exists at each M1 interface access points. These M1 UP
protocol instances are established and released together with the associated
MBMS E-RAB.
The following figure illustrates the logical placement of the SYNC protocol
layer and the placement of the Data Streams sources outside of the Access
Stratum.

# 5 SYNC protocol version 1
## 5.1 General
### 5.1.1 Applicablity of SYNC protocol version 1
This version of the specification specifies the SYNC protocol for UTRAN and
E-UTRAN. It is on top of TNL in Iu (UTRAN) and M1 (E-UTRAN) user plane, i.e.
Iu userplane TNL transports SYNC protocol PDUs over the Iu interface, M1
userplane TNL transports SYNC protocol PDUs over the M1 interface.
As a specification convention, within this specification, the interface
between the Core Network and the Radio Access Network is denoted as the "RAN
Access Interface", the termination point at the Radio Access Network is
denoted as "RAN Access Node", the termination point at the Core Network is
denoted as "Core Network" (CN). Further, "MBMS RAB" denotes the Radio Access
data bearer together with the RAN Access Interface data bearer for MBMS
service user data transmission.
For the application of the SYNC protocol to UTRAN, the RAN Access Interface is
the Iu interface, the RAN Access Node is the RNC.
For the application of the SYNC protocol to E-UTRAN, the RAN Access Interface
is the M1 interface, the RAN Access Node is the eNB.
### 5.1.1 Operation of the SYNC protocol
The SYNC protocol layer is present for data streams that originate in the CN
and carry additional information within a specific userplane-frame.
The two strata communicate through a Service Access Point for Non Access
Stratum (NAS) Data Streams transfer.
### 5.1.2 Interfaces of the SYNC protocol layer
As part of the Access Stratum responsibility, the SYNC protocol layer provides
the services and functions that are necessary to handle non access stratum
data streams for MBMS. The SYNC protocol layer is providing these services to
the UP upper layers through a Dedicated Service Access Point used for
Information Transfer.
The SYNC protocol layer is using services of the Transport layers in order to
transfer user plane PDUs over the RAN Access interface.
## 5.2 SYNC protocol layer services
The following functions are needed to support the SYNC protocol:
\- Transfer of user data along with synchronisation information;
\- Transfer of synchronisation information without user data.
## 5.3 Services Expected from the UP Data Transport layer
The SYNC protocol layer expects the following services from the Transport
Network Layer:
\- Transfer of user data.
\- No flow control.
## 5.4 Elementary procedures
### 5.4.1 Transfer of User Data for MBMS procedure
#### 5.4.1.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Transfer of User Data procedure for MBMS is to transfer RAN
Access Interface UP frames from the RAN Access interface UP protocol layers at
CN to the RAN Access interface UP protocol layer at the RAN Access Node. One
RAN Access interface UP instance is associated to a single MBMS RAB only.
The Transfer of User Data procedure is invoked whenever user data for that
particular RAB needs to be sent across the Radio Access interface.
The NAS Data Streams specific functions make the padding of the payload (if
needed) so that the Radio Access interface UP frame payload will be an integer
number of octets. Then the NAS Data Streams specific functions perform, if
needed, CRC calculation of the Iu/M1 frame payload and passes the Radio Access
interface UP frame payload down to the Frame Handler function.
The Frame Handler function within the CN retrieves the packet counter and
octet counter value from its internal memory, formats the frame header and
frame payload into the appropriate PDU Type and sends the Radio Access
interface UP frame PDU to the lower layers for transfer across the Radio
Access interface. If the user data is provided with compressed IP header, the
Radio Access interface UP frame contains PDCP information and the uncompressed
IP header.
The Frame Handler function within the CN is also responsible for appropriate
setting of the Time Stamp value in order to allow all RAN Access nodes to
submit the MBMS user data in a synchronised manner.
Upon reception of a user data frame, the RAN Access interface UP protocol
layer within the RAN Access node checks the consistency of the RAN Access
interface UP frame as follows:
\- The Frame Handler function checks the consistency of the frame header and
the consistency of the packet counter value.
\- Then the RAN Access node utilises the time stamp information to schedule
the user data on the radio interface on the next TTI for UTRAN or MCH
scheduling period for E-UTRAN as defined in TS 36.300 [6].
Figure 5.4.1.1-1. Successful Transfers of User Data.
#### 5.4.1.2 Unsuccessful operation
If multiple consecutive RAN Access interface UP frames carrying the user data
are incorrectly formatted or cannot be correctly treated by the receiving RAN
Access interface UP protocol layer, or if multiple consecutive frames loss is
detected due to gaps in the sequence of the received frame numbers, the RAN
Access node shall, if packet length information in Type 3 is not provided,
\- in case the RAN Access Interface UP is the Iu UP.
\- cease to provide user data to the radio interface protocol entities and
wait until the next synchronisation sequence if soft combining and MBSFN are
used, or until the next scheduling transmission interval if the RNC acts as an
MRNC and TDM multiplexing is used, as described in TS 25.346 [4].
\- in case the RAN Access Interface UP is the M1 UP and MBSFN is used,
\- cease to provide user data to the radio interface protocol entities and
wait until the next dynamic scheduling interval, as described in TS 36.300
[6].
\- in case the RAN Access Interface UP is the M1 UP and SC-PTM is used,
\- provide other correctly received user data to the radio interface protocol
entities, as described in TS 36.300 [6].
If packet length information in Type 3 is provided, the RAN Access nodes could
cease to provide user data to the radio interface protocol entities for those
lost subframes.
### 5.4.2 Transfer of Synchronisation Information for MBMS procedure (without
user data)
#### 5.4.2.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Transfer of Synchronisation Information for MBMS procedure
is to transfer synchronisation information from the CN to the RAN Access node
at the end of each synchronization sequence (see TS 25.346 [4], TS 36.300 [6])
to improve the RAN Access node resynchronization in case of packet loss.
The Frame Handler function within the CN retrieves the synchronisation time
stamp from its internal clock and the total packet counter and total octet
counter from its internal memory, formats the frame header and frame payload
into the appropriate PDU Type and sends the RAN Access interface UP frame PDU
to the lower layers for transfer across the RAN Access interface.
If there is no data frame in a synchronization sequence, synchronization
information shall still be transmitted.
Furthermore, the SYNC PDU towards RAN Access node could contain length of each
packet if supported.
Upon reception of a user data frame, the RAN Access interface UP protocol
layer checks the consistency of the RAN Access interface UP frame as follows:
\- The Frame Handler function checks the consistency of the frame header and
the consistency of the synchronisation time stamp, total packet counter, total
octet counter and packets length counter value if contained.
Figure 5.4.2.1-1. Successful Transfers of Synchronisation Information.
#### 5.4.2.2 Unsuccessful operation
If the RAN Access interface UP frame without user data is incorrectly
formatted or cannot be correctly treated by the receiving RAN Access interface
UP protocol layer, the RAN Access interface UP protocol layer shall either
discard the frame or pass it to the upper layers with a frame classification
indicating a corrupted frame.
## 5.5 Elements for the SYNC protocol
### 5.5.1 General
In the present document the structure of frames will be specified by using
figures similar to Figure 5.5.1-1.

Figure 5.5.1-1. Example frame format.
Unless otherwise indicated, fields which consist of multiple bits within an
octet will have the most significant bit located at the higher bit position
(indicated above frame in Figure 5.5.1-1). In addition, if a field spans
several octets, most significant bits will be located in lower numbered octets
(right of frame in Figure 5.5.1-1).
On the Iu/M1 interface, the frame will be transmitted starting from the lowest
numbered octet. Within each octet, the bits are sent according decreasing bit
position (bit position 7 first).
Spare bits should be set to \"0\" by the sender and should not be checked by
the receiver.
The header part of the frame is always an integer number of octets. The
payload part is octet aligned (by adding \'Padding\' when needed).
The receiver should be able to remove an additional spare extension field that
may be present at the end of a frame. See description of Spare extension
field.

**Field length:** 20 octets if IPv6 Indicator=0, 40 octets if IPv6
Indicator=1.
#### 5.5.3.10 Header CRC
**Description:** This field contains the CRC of all fields in Frame Control
Part. The CRC is a 6-bit checksum based on the generator polynomial G(D) =
D^6^+D^5^+D^3^+D^2^+D^1^+1, see subclause 5.6.2. With this CRC all error
bursts shorter than 7 bits are detected, as well as all odd number of bits
faulty (and two-bit faults) when the protected area is shorter than 24 bits,
(max 3 octets).
**Field length:** 6 bits.
#### 5.5.3.11 Payload CRC
**Description:** This field contains the CRC of all the fields (including
Padding and possible Spare extension) of the Frame Payload Part. The CRC is a
10 bit checksum based on the generator polynomial G(D) = D^10^+
D^9^+D^5^+D^4^+D^1^+1, see subclause 5.6.2. With this CRC all error bursts
shorter than 11 bits are detected, as well as all odd number of bits faulty
(and two-bit faults) when the protected area is shorter than 500 bits (max 62
octets).
**Field length:** 10 bits.
#### 5.5.3.12 Padding
**Description:** This field is an additional field used to make the frame
header or payload part an integer number of octets when needed. Padding is set
to \"0\" by the sender and is not interpreted by the receiver.
**Value range:** {0--127}.
**Field length:** 0--7 bits.
#### 5.5.3.13 Spare
**Description:** The spare field is set to \"0\" by the sender and should not
be interpreted by the receiver. This field is reserved for later versions.
**Value range:** (0--2^n^-1).
**Field Length:** n bits.
#### 5.5.3.14 Spare extension
**Description:** The spare extension field is reserved for extension in later
versions. It shall not be sent. The receiver should be capable of receiving a
spare extension. The spare extension should not be interpreted by the receiver
since in later versions of the present document additional new fields might be
added in place of the spare extension. The spare extension can be an integer
number of octets carrying new fields or additional information; the maximum
length of the spare extension field (m) depends on the PDU type.
**Value range:** 0--2^m*8^-1.
**Field Length:** 0--m octets. For PDU Types in the set {1,2,3}, m=4.
#### 5.5.3.15 Payload fields
**Description:** This field contains the payload of the MBMS user data.
**Value range:** {any value}.
**Field length:** n bits
.
#### 5.5.3.16 Length of the N^th^ Packet
**Description:** This parameter indicates the length of the SYNC PDU within
the synchronization sequence in octets. It helps the RAN Access node to
recover from de-synchronization in case of the loss of consecutive SYNC PDUs.
**Value range:** {0..2^12^-1}
**Field length** : 12 bits

### 5.6.2 CRC Calculation
The parity bits are generated by one of the following cyclic generator
polynomials:
g~CRC6~(D) = D^6^ + D^5^ + D^3^ + D^2^ + D^1^ + 1;
g~CRC10~(D) = D^10^ + D^9^ + D^5^ + D^4^ + D^1^ + 1.
Denote the bits to be protected of a frame by {width="1.0965277777777778in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}({width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}being the bit with the highest bit position in
the first octet), and the parity bits by {width="1.1666666666666667in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}. _A~i~_ is the length of the protected data and
L _~i~_ is 6 or 10 depending on the CRC length.
The encoding is performed in a systematic form, which means that in GF(2), the
polynomial
{width="4.208333333333333in" height="0.2777777777777778in"}
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC6~(D) and the polynomial
{width="4.277777777777778in" height="0.2777777777777778in"}
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC10~(D). If
{width="0.44375in" height="0.25in"}, {width="1.8194444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}.
### 5.6.3 Relation between input and output of the Cyclic Redundancy Check
The protected bits are left unchanged in the frame. The parity bits for the
Header CRC are put in the Header CRC field with{width="0.19375in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} being the highest bit position of the first
octet of the Header CRC field. The parity bits for the Payload CRC are put in
the Payload CRC field with{width="0.19375in" height="0.2361111111111111in"}
being the highest bit position of the first octet of the Payload CRC field.
