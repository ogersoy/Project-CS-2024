# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the technical characteristics and methods of
test for testing the USIM Application Toolkit implemented in Mobile Equipments
(ME) or Mobile Station (MS) within the 3GPP digital cellular
telecommunications system, in compliance with the relevant requirements, and
in accordance with the relevant guidance given in ISO/IEC 9646‑7 [19] and ETSI
ETS 300 406 [20].
The present document is valid for ME implemented according to 3GPP Release 99,
or Release 4, or any later Release.
The present document covers the minimum characteristics considered necessary
in order to provide sufficient performance for mobile equipment and to prevent
interference to other services or to other users, and to the PLMNs.
It does not necessarily include all the characteristics which may be required
by a user or subscriber, nor does it necessarily represent the optimum
performance achievable.
The present document is part of the 3GPP-series of technical specifications.
The present document neither replaces any of the other 3GPP technical
specifications or 3GPP related ETSs or ENs, nor is it created to provide full
understanding of (or parts of) the UMTS. The present document lists the
requirements, and provides the methods of test for testing the USIM
Application Toolkit implemented in a ME for conformance to the 3GPP standard.
For a full description of the system, reference should be made to all the 3GPP
technical specifications or 3GPP related ETSIs, ETSs or ENs. Clause 2 provides
a complete list of the 3GPP technical specifications, 3GPP related ETSI\'s
ETSs, ENs, and ETRs, on which this conformance test specifications is based.
If there is a difference between this present conformance document, and any
other 3GPP technical specification or 3GPP related ETSI, ETS, EN, or 3GPP TS,
then the other 3GPP technical specification or 3GPP related ETSI ETS, EN or
3GPP TS shall prevail.
Within the context of this document, the term \"terminal\" used in ETSI TS 102
384 [26] refers to the Mobile Equipment (ME).
Within the context of this document, the term \"UICC\" used in ETSI TS 102 384
[26] refers to the USIM card.
Within the context of this document, the term \"NAA\" used in ETSI TS 102 384
[26] refers to the USIM application.
For the avoidance of doubt, references to clauses of ETSI TS 102 384 [26] or
ETSI TS 102 221 [13] include all the clauses of that clause, unless
specifically mentioned.
The target test specification ETSI TS 102 384 [26] contains material that is
outside of the scope of 3GPP requirements and the present document indicates
which parts are in the scope and which are not.
A 3GPP ME may support functionality that is not required by 3GPP, but the
requirements to do so are outside of the scope of 3GPP. Thus the present
document does not contain tests or references to ETSI TS 102 384 [26] tests
for features which are out of scope of 3GPP.
In the present document, unless explicitly stated otherwise, for Rel-13
onwards the term E-UTRAN implicitly refers to the E-UTRAN in WB-S1 mode.
E-UTRAN in NB-S1 mode is always explicitly referred to as NB-IoT.

### 3.2.4 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TS 34.108 [12] and TS 31.121 [21] apply.
#### 3.2.4.1 Format of the table of optional features
Option: The optional feature supported or not by the implementation.
Support Answer notation: The support columns shall be filled in by the
supplier of the implementation. The following common notations, defined in
ISO/IEC 9646‑7 [19], are used for the support column in the tables below.
Y or y supported by the implementation
N or n not supported by the implementation
N/A, n/a or - no answer required (allowed only if the status is N/A, directly
or after evaluation of a conditional status)
Mnemonic column: The Mnemonic column contains mnemonic identifiers for each
item.
#### 3.2.4.2 Format of the applicability table
The applicability of every test in table B.1 is formally expressed by the use
of Boolean expression defined in the following clause.
The columns in table B.1 have the following meaning:
\- In the \"Item\" column a local entry number for the requirement in the
table is given.
\- In the \"Description\" column a short non-exhaustive description of the
requirement is found.
\- The \"Release\" column gives the Release applicable and onwards, for the
item in the \"Description\" column
\- The \"Test Sequence(s)\" column gives a reference to the test sequence
number(s) detailed in the present document and required to validate the
implementation of the corresponding item in the \"Description\" column.
\- For a given Release, the corresponding \"Rel X ME\" column lists the tests
required for a Mobile Station to be declared compliant to this Release.
\- The \"Support\" column is blank in the proforma, and shall be completed by
the manufacturer in respect of each particular requirement to indicate the
choices, which have been made in the implementation.
\- The \"Network Dependency\" column indicates if a test depends on specific
network access technology or requires network connection, but the status may
not have an impact on references to ETSI TS 102 384 [26].
\- The \"Terminal Profile\" column gives a reference to the corresponding
Terminal Profile bit(s) that is/are related to the toolkit feature(s) of the
respective test(s).
\- The \"Additional test case execution parameter\" column shall be used in
conjunction with the entry in the \"Rel-xx ME\" column. The column indicates
if the test is affected by additional test case execution parameters.
#### 3.2.4.3 Status and notations
\"Release X ME\" columns show the status of the entries as follows:
The following notations, defined in ISO/IEC 9646‑7 [19], are used for the
status column:
M mandatory - the capability is required to be supported.
O optional - the capability may be supported or not.
N/A not applicable - in the given context, it is impossible to use the
capability.
X prohibited (excluded) - there is a requirement not to use this capability in
the given context.
O.i qualified optional - for mutually exclusive or selectable options from a
set. \"i\" is an integer which identifies an unique group of related optional
items and the logic of their selection which is defined immediately following
the table.
Ci conditional - the requirement on the capability (\"M\", \"O\", \"X\" or
\"N/A\") depends on the support of other optional or conditional items. \"i\"
is an integer identifying an unique conditional status expression which is
defined immediately following the table. For nested conditional expressions,
the syntax \"IF ... THEN (IF ... THEN ... ELSE...) ELSE ...\" shall be used to
avoid ambiguities.
The \"Additional test case execution parameter\" column shows the status of
the entries as follows:
TCEPi Test Case Execution Parameter --defines additional parameters which have
to be taken into account when executing affected test case(s). \"i\" is an
integer identifying an unique parameter which is defined immediately following
the table.
A applicable - the test is applicable according to the corresponding entry in
the \"Rxx ME\" column
R(x) redundant -- the test has to be considered as redundant when the
corresponding E-UTRAN/EPC related test \"x\" of the present document has been
validated and successfully executed. In that case the requirement may be
verified by means of the E-UTRAN/EPC functionality only.
AERi Additional test case Execution Recommendation -- with respect to the
above listed definitions of (\"A\") and (\"R\") the test is applicable (\"A\")
or redundant (\"R\") depending on the support of other optional or conditional
items. \"i\" is an integer identifying a unique conditional status expression
which is defined immediately following the table. For nested conditional
expressions, the syntax \"IF ... THEN (IF ... THEN ... ELSE...) ELSE ...\"
shall be used to avoid ambiguities.
References to items: For each possible item answer (answer in the support
column) there exists a unique reference, used, for example, in the conditional
expressions. It is defined as the table identifier, followed by a solidus
character \"/\", followed by the item number in the table. If there is more
than one support column in a table, the columns shall be discriminated by
letters (a, b, etc.), respectively.
EXAMPLE: A.1/4 is the reference to the answer of item 4 in table A.1.
## 3.3 Table of optional features
Support of USIM Application Toolkit is optional for Mobile Equipment. However,
if an ME states conformance with a specific 3GPP release, it is mandatory for
the ME to support all functions of that release, as stated in table B.1, with
the exception of the functions:
\- \"Alpha identifier in REFRESH command supported by terminal\";
\- \"Event Language Selection\";
\- \"Proactive UICC: PROVIDE LOCAL INFORMATION (language)\"; and
\- \"Proactive UICC: LANGUAGE NOTIFICATION\".
In accordance to 3GPP TS 36.300 [40], clause 4.10, additional exceptions apply
for NB-IoT only MEs.\ As a number of E-UTRA protocol functions supported by
Rel-8 MEs are not required for NB-IoT, the related USIM Application Toolkit
functions may not be supported by NB-IoT only MEs.
Note: NB-IoT only MEs are MEs that only support NB-IoT and no other radio
access technology.
The support of letter classes, which specify mainly ME hardware dependent
features, is optional for the ME and may supplement the USIM Application
Toolkit functionality described in the present document. If an ME states
conformance to a letter class, it is mandatory to support all functions within
the respective letter class.
The supplier of the implementation shall state the support of possible options
in table A.1.

# 6 Implicit testing
For some 3GPP features conformance is not verified explicitly in the present
document. This does not imply that correct functioning of these features is
not essential, but that these are implicitly tested to a sufficient degree in
other tests.
It should be noted that for these features some aspects have to be and are
explicitly tested, e.g. the ability to switch between 1.8v and 3v operation.
Some UICC features will be explicitly tested as result of other tests. These
should be identified for the following reason:
\- To identify the areas of overlap and thus provide a more efficient testing.
# 7 Measurement uncertainty
The measured value relating to the corresponding limit shall be used to
determine whether or not a terminal equipment meets the requirement. (ETR 028,
annex B).
This process is often referred to as \"shared risk\".
# 8 Format of tests

# 10 - 26 Not used
# 27 Testing of the UICC/ME interface
## 27.0 Introduction
This clause is an addition to TS 31.121 [21] to confirm the correct
interpretation of the USIM Application Toolkit commands and the correct
operation of the Toolkit facilities.
The definitions, declarations and default values specified in TS 31.121 [21]
clause 4.1 shall apply, unless otherwise specified in the present clause.
A USIM Simulator with the appropriate USIM Application Toolkit functionality
will be required. Alternatively, USIMs programmed with specific data and USIM
Application Toolkit applets may be used.The USIM data defined below shall be
used for all test cases unless otherwise specified within the test case.
The comprehension required flags in SIMPLE-TLV objects that are included in a
TERMINAL RESPONSE or an ENVELOPE shall be set as described in TS 31.111 [15].
This means that in cases where it is up to the ME to decide if this flag is
used or not, the corresponding Tag coding in the TERMINAL RESPONSEs and
ENVELOPEs in this document represents only one of the two valid possibilities.
TS 31.111 [15] defines that in case of the general result \"Command performed
successfully\" some proactive commands require additional information in the
command result and in which cases this is mandatory or optional. Thus when
additional information bytes are optional in the Result TLV, the additional
information bytes of the Result TLVin the Terminal Responses shall be ignored.
## 27.1 - 27.21 Void
## 27.22 USIM Application Toolkit
### 27.22.1A General Test purpose
Testing of functional conformance to USIM Application Toolkit commands,
including proactive UICC commands.
All facilities given by the TERMINAL PROFILE as supported, for which tests
exist in the present document, shall be tested.
Many of the proactive UICC commands include an alpha identifier data object.
This is intended to be a short one or two word identifier for the ME to
optionally display on the screen along with any other indications, at the same
time as the ME performs the UICC command.
Note: The sequence of USIM Application Toolkit commands are specific to the
Toolkit Application being executed within the UICC, hence sequential testing
of commands is not possible. The testing will therefore have to be performed
on a command by command basis.
### 27.22.2A Definition of default values for USIM Application Toolkit testing
A UICC containing the following default values is used for all tests of this
clause unless otherwise stated.
For each item, the logical default values and the coding within the Elementary
Files (EF) of the USIM follow, as defined in:
\- TS 31.121 [21], clause 4.1.
\- ETSI TS 102 384 [26], clause 27.22.1B.
Note 1: Bx represents byte x of the coding.
Note 2: Unless otherwise defined, the coding values in binary.

\- TS 31.102 [14] clause 5.1.1.2 and ETSI TS 102 221[13] clause 11.1.2
##### 27.22.4.7.1.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-82 .H6}
To verify that the ME performs the Proactive Command -- REFRESH in accordance
with the Command Qualifier. This shall require the ME to perform:
\- the UICC and USIM initialization,
\- a re-read of the contents and structure of the EFs on the UICC that have
been notified as changed and are either part of initialization or used during
the test,
\- a restart of the card session,
\- a successfull return of the result of the execution of the command in the
TERMINAL RESPONSE command send to the UICC.
##### 27.22.4.7.1.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-82 .H6}
##### 27.22.4.7.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-82 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and only connected to the USS if the
USS is mentioned in the sequence table..
The elementary files are coded as Toolkit default except for expected sequence
1.3.
For expected sequence 1.3 the global phonebook shall be present.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
These values might be overwritten with values defined in the expected
sequences itself.
Prior to the execution of expected sequence 1.2 the FDN service shall be
enabled.

\- another gateway with an IP address different from the one defined in
default browser parameters.
The mobile is in idle mode. To ensure that there are no active PDP contexts
established until the proactive command is fetched, the USS shall be
configured to ignore any PDP context activation request before the LAUNCH
BROWSER command is fetched.
For URL requests resulting from the LAUNCH BROWSER command execution the USS
shall be configured to respond with an HTTP status error code (4xx \"Client
Error\" or 5xx \"Server Error\") to URL requests which do not match the
Default URL or the URL provided in the proactive command. At the same time the

To verify that the ME performs a proper user confirmation with an USC2 alpha
identifier, launches the Wap session required in LAUNCH BROWSER and returns a
successful result in the TERMINAL RESPONSE command send to the UICC.
##### 27.22.4.26.3.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-250 .H6}
##### 27.22.4.26.3.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-252 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS.
The elementary files are coded as USIM Application Toolkit default.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
A valid access to 2 different Wap gateways is required:
\- the default browser parameters (IP address, gateway/proxy identity, called
number, URL ...) of the tested mobile shall be properly filled to access one
of the gateways (\"default gateway\").
With that default gateway we shall be able to access to an URL different from
the default one.
\- another gateway with an IP address different from the one defined in
default browser parameters.
The mobile is busy in a browser session, the user navigates in pages different
from the URL defined by default in Wap parameters.
For URL requests resulting from the LAUNCH BROWSER command execution the USS
shall be configured to respond with an HTTP status error code (4xx \"Client
Error\" or 5xx \"Server Error\") to URL requests which do not match the
Default URL or the URL provided in the proactive command. At the same time the
USS shall ignore these URL requests regarding the test case verdict
generation.
The browser\'s cache shall have been cleared before execution of each
sequence.
The Bearer Parameters defined in 27.22.4.26.1.4.1 shall be used.

##### 27.22.4.26.5.2.5 Test Requirement {#test-requirement-253 .H6}
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequences 5.2.
##### 27.22.4.26.5.3 LAUNCH BROWSER (support of Text Attribute -- Right
Alignment) {#launch-browser-support-of-text-attribute-right-alignment .H6}
##### 27.22.4.26.5.3.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-
applicability-256 .H6}
See clause 3.2.2.
##### 27.22.4.26.5.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-7
.H6}
The ME shall support the LAUNCH BROWSER Proactive UICC Command as defined in:
\- TS 31.111 [15] clause 5.2, clauses 6.4.26 and 6.6.26, clause 8.6, clause
8.7, clause 8.48, clause 9.2, clause 8.2, clause 8.47, clause 8.49, clause
8.50, clause 8.15, clause 8.31 and clause 8.70.
##### 27.22.4.26.5.3.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-256 .H6}
To verify that the ME performs a proper user confirmation with an alpha
identifier according to the right alignment text attribute configuration,
launches the Wap session required in LAUNCH BROWSER and returns a successful
result in the TERMINAL RESPONSE command send to the UICC.
##### 27.22.4.26.5.3.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-254 .H6}
##### 27.22.4.26.5.3.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-256 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS.
The elementary files are coded as USIM Application Toolkit default.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
A valid access to 2 different Wap gateways is required:
\- the default Wap parameters (IP address, gateway/proxy identity, called
number, URL ...) of the tested mobile shall be properly filled to access one
of the gateways (\"default gateway\")
With that default gateway we shall be able to access to an URL different from
the default one.
\- another gateway with an IP address different from the one defined in
default Wap parameters.
The Bearer Parameters defined in 27.22.4.26.1.4.1 shall be used.
The ME is in idle mode. To ensure that there are no active PDP contexts
established until the proactive command is fetched, the USS shall be
configured to ignore any PDP context activation request before the LAUNCH
BROWSER command is fetched.
For URL requests resulting from the LAUNCH BROWSER command execution the USS
shall be configured to respond with an HTTP status error code (4xx \"Client
Error\" or 5xx \"Server Error\") to URL requests which do not match the
Default URL or the URL provided in the proactive command. At the same time the
USS shall ignore these URL requests regarding the test case verdict
generation.
Before execution of each sequence the browser\'s cache shall be cleared.

##### 27.22.4.26.5.5.5 Test Requirement {#test-requirement-256 .H6}
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequences 5.5.
##### 27.22.4.26.5.6 LAUNCH BROWSER (support of Text Attribute -- Bold on)
{#launch-browser-support-of-text-attribute-bold-on .H6}
##### 27.22.4.26.5.6.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-
applicability-259 .H6}
See clause 3.2.2.
##### 27.22.4.26.5.6.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-10
.H6}
The ME shall support the LAUNCH BROWSER Proactive UICC Command as defined in:
\- TS 31.111 [15] clause 5.2, clauses 6.4.26 and 6.6.26, clause 8.6, clause
8.7, clause 8.48, clause 9.2, clause 8.2, clause 8.47, clause 8.49, clause
8.50, clause 8.15, clause 8.31 and clause 8.70.
##### 27.22.4.26.5.6.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-259 .H6}
To verify that the ME performs a proper user confirmation with an alpha
identifier according to the bold text attribute configuration, launches the
Wap session required in LAUNCH BROWSER and returns a successful result in the
TERMINAL RESPONSE command send to the UICC.
##### 27.22.4.26.5.6.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-257 .H6}
##### 27.22.4.26.5.6.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-259 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS.
The elementary files are coded as USIM Application Toolkit default.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
A valid access to 2 different Wap gateways is required:
\- the default Wap parameters (IP address, gateway/proxy identity, called
number, URL ...) of the tested mobile shall be properly filled to access one
of the gateways (\"default gateway\")
With that default gateway we shall be able to access to an URL different from
the default one.
\- another gateway with an IP address different from the one defined in
default Wap parameters.
The Bearer Parameters defined in 27.22.4.26.1.4.1 shall be used.
The ME is in idle mode. To ensure that there are no active PDP contexts
established until the proactive command is fetched, the USS shall be
configured to ignore any PDP context activation request before the LAUNCH
BROWSER command is fetched.
For URL requests resulting from the LAUNCH BROWSER command execution the USS
shall be configured to respond with an HTTP status error code (4xx \"Client
Error\" or 5xx \"Server Error\") to URL requests which do not match the
Default URL or the URL provided in the proactive command. At the same time the
USS shall ignore these URL requests regarding the test case verdict
generation.

The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS.
The elementary files are coded as USIM Application Toolkit default.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
A valid access to 2 different Wap gateways is required:
\- the default Wap parameters (IP address, gateway/proxy identity, called
number, URL ...) of the tested mobile shall be properly filled to access one
of the gateways (\"default gateway\")
With that default gateway we shall be able to access to an URL different from
the default one.
\- another gateway with an IP address different from the one defined in
default Wap parameters.
The Bearer Parameters defined in 27.22.4.26.1.4.1 shall be used.
The ME is in idle mode. To ensure that there are no active PDP contexts
established until the proactive command is fetched, the USS shall be

To verify that the ME performs a proper user confirmation with an USC2 alpha
identifier, launches the Wap session required in LAUNCH BROWSER and returns a
successful result in the TERMINAL RESPONSE command send to the UICC.
##### 27.22.4.26.6.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-262 .H6}
##### 27.22.4.26.6.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-264 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS.
The elementary files are coded as USIM Application Toolkit default.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
A valid access to 2 different Wap gateways is required:
\- the default Wap parameters (IP address, gateway/proxy identity, called
number, URL ...) of the tested mobile shall be properly filled to access one
of the gateways (\"default gateway\").
With that default gateway we shall be able to access to an URL different from
the default one.
\- another gateway with an IP address different from the one defined in
default Wap parameters.
The mobile is busy in a Wap session, the user navigates in pages different
from the URL defined by default in Wap parameters.
For URL requests resulting from the LAUNCH BROWSER command execution the USS
shall be configured to respond with an HTTP status error code (4xx \"Client
Error\" or 5xx \"Server Error\") to URL requests which do not match the
Default URL or the URL provided in the proactive command. At the same time the

##### 27.22.4.26.8.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-264 .H6}
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequence 8.1 to 8.5.
#### 27.22.4.27 OPEN CHANNEL
##### 27.22.4.27.1 Void
##### 27.22.4.27.2 Open Channel (related to GPRS)
##### 27.22.4.27.2.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-
applicability-267 .H6}
See clause 3.2.2.
##### 27.22.4.27.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-18
.H6}
The ME shall support the class \"e\" commands as defined in:
\- TS 31.111[15] clause 5.2, clauses 6.4.27 and 6.6.27, clause 8.6, clause
8.7, clause 9.2, clause 8.2, clause 8.15, clause 8.31 and clause 8.70.
##### 27.22.4.27.2.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-267 .H6}
To verify that the ME shall send a:
\- TERMINAL RESPONSE (OK); or
\- TERMINAL RESPONSE (Command performed with modification); or
\- TERMINAL RESPONSE (User did not accept the proactive command);
\- TERMINAL RESPONSE (ME currently unable to process command);
to the UICC after the ME receives the OPEN CHANNEL proactive command. The
TERMINAL RESPONSE sent back to the UICC is the result of the ME and the
network capabilities against requested parameters by the UICC.
##### 27.22.4.27.2.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-265 .H6}
##### 27.22.4.27.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-267 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS. The elementary files
are coded as Toolkit default.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
The following Bearer Parameters used are those defined in the default Test PDP
context for test cases using packet services:
The Channel identifier value used for these tests is set to 1 as an example.
This channel identifier is dependent on the ME\'s default channel identifier
as declared in table A.2/27.
The following Bearer Parameters used are those defined in the default Test PDP
ContextDch, as specified in TS 34.123-3 [27], clause 8.10 for test cases using
packet services:
Bearer Parameters
Precedence Class: 03
Delay Class: 04
Reliability Class: 03
Peak throughput class: 04
Mean throughput class: 31
Packet data protocol: 02 (IP)
GPRS Parameters
Network access name: TestGp.rs
User login: UserLog
User password: UserPwd
UICC/ME interface transport level
Transport format: UDP or TCP mode
Port number: 44444
Data destination address 01.01.01.01 (as an example)
Note: If a data destination address different to 01.01.01.01 is used then the
same value is used in the content of the affected Open Channel commands and
the network simulator setup and related UE settings might require a
corresponding adaptation.
Prior to test case execution the apparatus supplier shall have provided the
\"Preferred buffer size supported by the terminal for Open Channel command\"
as requested in table A.2/29.
Pre-condition for successful execution of expected sequence 2.1:
If the terminal does not support the execution of an Open Channel (GPRS)
command when no Network Access Name TLV is present in the proactive command
and when no default Access Point Name is set in the terminal configuration
(s.a. table A.1/48), then \"TestGp.rs\" shall be set and activated as default
Access Point Name in the terminal configuration prior to execution of the
proactive command in expected sequence 2.1.
##### 27.22.4.27.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-267 .H6}
Expected Sequence 2.1 void
NOTE: The above sequence has been made void, however the messages defined
below are still required for further test sequences.

##### 27.22.4.27.3.2.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-268 .H6}
To verify that the ME allocates the buffer, activates the PDP context and
reports the Channel status using TERMINAL RESPONSE (Command performed
successfully) to the UICC after the ME receives the OPEN CHANNEL proactive
command.
##### 27.22.4.27.3.2.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-266 .H6}
##### 27.22.4.27.3.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-268 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS. The elementary files
are coded as Toolkit default.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
The following Bearer Parameters used are those defined in the default Test PDP
context for test cases using packet services:
The Channel identifier value used for these tests is set to 1 as an example.
This channel identifier is dependent on the ME\'s default channel identifier
as declared in table A.2/27.
The following Bearer Parameters used are those defined in the default Test PDP
ContextDch, as specified in TS 34.123-3 [27], clause 8.10 for test cases using

UICC/ME interface transport level
Transport format: TCP mode
Port number: 44444
Data destination address 01.01.01.01 (as an example)
Note: If a data destination address different to 01.01.01.01 is used then the
same value is used in the content of the affected Open Channel commands and
the network simulator setup and related UE settings might require a
corresponding adaptation.
Pre-condition for successful execution of expected sequence x.1:
If the terminal does not support the execution of an Open Channel (GPRS)
command when no Network Access Name TLV is present in the proactive command
and when no default Access Point Name is set in the terminal configuration
(s.a. table A.1/48), then \"TestGp.rs\" shall be set and activated as default
Access Point Name in the terminal configuration prior to execution of the
proactive command in expected sequence x.1.

The default E-UTRAN/EPC UICC, the default E-UTRAN parameters and the following
parameters are used:
Network access name: Any value other than TestGp.rs or Test12.rs
User login: UserLog
User password: UserPwd
UICC/ME interface transport level
Transport format: TCP
Port number: 44444
Data destination address: 01.01.01.01 (as an example)
Note: If a data destination address different to 01.01.01.01 is used then the
same value is used in the content of the affected Open Channel commands and
the network simulator setup and related UE settings might require a
corresponding adaptation.
The Channel identifier value used for these tests is set to 1 as an example.
This channel identifier is dependent on the ME\'s default channel identifier
as declared in table A.2/27.
Prior to test case execution the apparatus supplier shall have provided the
\"Preferred buffer size supported by the terminal for Open Channel command\"
as requested in table A.2/29.
For sequence 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 the E-USS shall be able to support 2 active PDN
connections at the same time.
In case the ME supports A.1/173 AND A.1/174 AND A.1/178, for sequence 6.1 and
6.3 the NB-SS shall be able to support 2 active PDN connections at the same
time.
For sequence 6.6 service n°117 is \"available\" in EF~UST~ and the Bearer
Independent Protocol is not marked in EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ as a 3GPP PS data off
exempt service. Also SMS over SGs is used to send and receive short messages.
For sequence 6.7 service n°117 is \"available\" in EF~UST~ and the Bearer
Independent Protocol is marked in EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ as a 3GPP PS data off
exempt service. Also SMS over SGs is used to send and receive short messages.

To verify that the ME shall send a:
\- TERMINAL RESPONSE (OK); or
\- TERMINAL RESPONSE (Command performed with modification); or
\- TERMINAL RESPONSE (User did not accept the proactive command);
\- TERMINAL RESPONSE (ME currently unable to process command);
to the UICC after the ME receives the OPEN CHANNEL proactive command while
accessing NG-RAN/5GC. The TERMINAL RESPONSE sent back to the UICC is the
result of the ME and the network capabilities against requested parameters by
the UICC.
To verify that the ME establishes a PDU session with the parameters indicated
in the Open Channel command and additional parameters from matching URSP rule
when Bearer Types 0x02 or 0x0C is indicated in the Open Channel command.
To verify the pre-configured policy is applied by the UE only when the UE has
not received the same type of policy from the Network (PCF).
To verify that the ME does not setup a new PDU session and uses the existing
PDU session when Bearer Type 3 is indicated in the Open Channel command.
To verify that the ME does not disconnect the existing PDU session when the
user rejects the user confirmation of the Open Channel command.

##### 27.22.4.28.1.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-282 .H6}
To verify that the ME shall send a:
\- TERMINAL RESPONSE (Command Performed Successfully); or
\- TERMINAL RESPONSE (Bearer Independent Protocol Error);
to the UICC after the ME receives the CLOSE CHANNEL proactive command. The
TERMINAL RESPONSE sent back to the UICC is function of the ME and the network
capabilities against asked parameters by the UICC.
##### 27.22.4.28.1.4 Method of Test {#method-of-test-281 .H6}
##### 27.22.4.28.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-282 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS. The elementary files
are coded as Toolkit default.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
For MEs supporting BIP related to GPRS in UDP (i.e condition C121 in table
B.1), The PROACTIVE COMMAND: OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1 shall be executed to open a
channel successfully at the beginning of the test. The corresponding Terminal
Response shall be TERMINAL RESPONSE: OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1A or TERMINAL RESPONSE:
OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1B.
The Channel identifier value used for these tests is set to 1 as an example.
This channel identifier is dependent on the ME\'s default channel identifier
as declared in table A.2/27
The following Bearer Parameters used are those defined in the default Test PDP
context for test cases using packet services:
Bearer Parameters: Same Bearer Parameters as defined in 27.22.4.27.2.4.1
GPRS Parameters: Same GPRS Parameters as defined in 27.22.4.27.2.4.1

##### 27.22.4.28.2.7.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-289 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS.
The elementary files are coded as Toolkit default.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
For MEs supporting BIP related to GPRS in UDP (i.e condition C121 in table
B.1), The PROACTIVE COMMAND: OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1 shall be executed to open a
channel successfully at the beginning of the test. The corresponding Terminal
Response shall be TERMINAL RESPONSE: OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1A or TERMINAL RESPONSE:
OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1B.
The channel identifier value used for these tests is set to 1 as an example.
This channel identifier is dependent on the ME\'s default channel identifier
as declared in table A.2/27.
The following Bearer Parameters used are those defined in the default Test PDP
context3, as specified in TS 34.108 [12], for test cases using packet
services:

##### 27.22.4.30.4.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-318 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the NG-SS. Prior to this test
the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE DOWNLOAD
procedure.
The default NG-RAN UICC, the default NG-RAN parameters and the following URSP
rules stored in the ME are used:
URSP:
Rule Precedence =1
Traffic Descriptor:
DNN=TestGp.rs
Route Selection Descriptor:
Precedence=1
Network Slice Selection, S-NSSAI: 01 01 01 02 (ST: MBB, SD: 010102)
SSC Mode Selection: SSC Mode 1

The Allowed S-NSSAI list is configured in NG-SS as \'01 01 01 01\', \'01 01 01
02\'and \'01 01 01 03\'
For sequence 4.2 the NG-SS shall be able to support 2 active PDU sessions at
the same time.
The Channel identifier value used for these tests is set to 1 as an example.
This channel identifier is dependent on the ME\'s default channel identifier
as declared in table A.2/27.
Prior to test case execution the apparatus supplier shall have provided the
\"Preferred buffer size supported by the terminal for Open Channel command\"
as requested in table A.2/29.

##### 27.22.4.30.4.5 Test Requirement {#test-requirement-314 .H6}
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequences 4.1 to 4.2.
#### 27.22.4.31 GET CHANNEL STATUS
##### 27.22.4.31.1 Definition and applicability
See clause 3.2.2.
##### 27.22.4.31.2 Conformance requirements
The ME shall support the class \"e\" commands. For sequences 1.4 to 1.5 the
support of E-UTRAN, for sequence 1.6 the support of NG-RAN as defined in:
> \- TS 31.111 [15].
is required in addition.
##### 27.22.4.31.3 Test purpose
To verify that the ME shall send a TERMINAL RESPONSE (Command Performed
Successfully) to the UICC after the ME receives the GET STATUS proactive
command. The TERMINAL RESPONSE sent back to the UICC is function of the ME and
the network capabilities against asked parameters by the UICC.
##### 27.22.4.31.4 Method of test
##### 27.22.4.31.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-319 .H6}
The elementary files are coded as Toolkit default.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
If programmable USIM with test applet is used (as defined in clause 27.0),
UICC shall register for Data Available and Channel Status Event using the
proactive command SET UP EVENT LIST with Data Available and Channel Status
event in the event list (ref to ETSI TS 102.241 cl 6.7.1.2).
For MEs supporting BIP related to GPRS in UDP (i.e condition C121 in table
B.1), The PROACTIVE COMMAND: OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1 shall be executed to open a
channel successfully at the beginning of the test. The corresponding Terminal
Response shall be TERMINAL RESPONSE: OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1A or TERMINAL RESPONSE:
OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1B.
The channel identifier value used for these tests is set to 1 as an example.
This channel identifier is dependent on the ME\'s default channel identifier
as declared in table A.2/27.
For sequences 1.1 to 1.3:
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS. The following Bearer
Parameters used are those defined in the default Test PDP context3, for test
cases using packet services:
Bearer Parameters: Same Bearer Parameters as defined in clause
27.22.4.27.2.4.1
GPRS Parameters: Same GPRS Parameters as defined in clause 27.22.4.27.2.4.1
UICC/ME interface transport level: Same UICC/ME transport interface level as
defined in clause 27.22.4.27.2.4.1
Data destination address: Same Data Destination Address as defined in clause
27.22.4.27.2.4.1.
For sequences 1.4 to 1.5
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the E-USS/NB-SS. Prior to this
test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE DOWNLOAD
procedure.
The default E-UTRAN/EPC UICC, the default E-UTRAN parameters and the following
parameters are used:
Network access name: TestGp.rs
User login: UserLog
User password: UserPwd
UICC/ME interface transport level: Same UICC/ME transport interface level as
defined in clause 27.22.4.27.6.4.1
Data destination address: Same Data Destination Address as defined in clause
27.22.4.27.6.4.1.
For sequence 1.6
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the NG-SS. The default NG-RAN
UICC, the default NG-RAN parameters, the URSP rules stored in the ME and the
Allowed S-NSSAI list as defined in clause 27.22.4.27.8.4.1 is configured in
NG-SS are used.
##### 27.22.4.31.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-317 .H6}
Expected sequence 1.1 (GET STATUS, without any BIP channel opened)
For that test, no channel has been opened.

to-point\" messages to the UICC.
To verify that the ME returns the RP-ACK message back to the USS, if the UICC
responds with \'90 00\', \'91 XX\', \'62 XX\' or \'63 XX\'.
To verify that the ME with an SMS-PP download feature implementation prior to
Rel-11 returns the RP-ERROR message back to the system Simulator, if the UICC
responds with \'62 XX\' or \'63 XX\' (while the ME with the Rel-11 or later
implemention of this feature returns an RP-ACK in this case).
To verify that the ME returns the response data from the UICC back to the USS
in the TP-User-Data element of the RP-ACK message, if the UICC returns
response data\'.

To verify that the ME transparently passes the \"data download via SMS Point-
to-point\" messages to the UICC.
To verify that the ME returns the RP-ACK message back to the USS, if the UICC
responds with \'90 00\', \'91 XX\', \'62 XX\' or \'63 XX\'.
To verify that the ME with an SMS-PP download feature implementation prior to
Rel-11 returns the RP-ERROR message back to the system Simulator, if the UICC
responds with \'62 XX\' or \'63 XX\' (while the ME with the Rel-11 or later
implemention of this feature return an RP-ACK in this case).
To verify that the ME returns the response data from the UICC back to the USS
in the TP-User-Data element of the RP-ACK message, if the UICC returns
response data\'.

##### 27.22.6.1.3 Test purpose
To verify that for all call set-up attempts , even those resulting from a SET
UP CALL proactive UICC command, the ME shall first pass the call set-up
details (dialled digits and associated parameters) to the UICC, using the
ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL).
To verify that if the UICC responds with \'90 00\', the ME shall set up the
call with the dialled digits and other parameters as sent to the UICC.
To verify that if the UICC returns response data, the ME shall use the
response data appropriately to set up the call as proposed, not set up the
call, or set up a call using the data supplied by the UICC.
To verify that, in the case where the initial call set-up request results from
a proactive SET UP CALL, if the call control result is \"not allowed\" or
\"allowed with modifications\", the ME shall inform the UICC using TERMINAL
RESPONSE \"interaction with call control by UICC or MO short message control
by UICC, action not allowed\".
To verify that it is possible for the UICC to request the ME to set up an
emergency call by supplying the number \"112\" as the response data.
##### 27.22.6.1.4 Method of tests

##### 27.22.6.3.3 Test purpose
To verify that the ME checks that the number entered through the MMI is on the
FDN list.
To verify that, if the MMI input does not pass the FDN check, the call shall
not be set up.
To verify that, if the MMI input does pass the FDN check, the ME shall pass
the dialled digits and other parameters to the UICC, using the ENVELOPE (CALL
CONTROL) command.
To verify that, if the UICC responds with \"allowed, no modification\", the ME
shall set up the call as proposed.
To verify that, if the UICC responds with \"not allowed\", the ME shall not
set up the call.
To verify that, if the UICC responds with \"allowed with modifications\", the
ME shall set up the call in accordance with the response from the UICC. If the
modifications involve changing the dialled digits, the ME shall not re-check
this modified number against the FDN list.
##### 27.22.6.3.4 Method of tests
##### 27.22.6.3.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-326 .H6}

##### 27.22.6.3.5 Test requirement
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequences 3.1 to 3.5.
#### 27.22.6.4 Support of Barred Dialling Number (BDN) service
##### 27.22.6.4.1 Definition and applicability
Barred Dialling Numbers (BDN) is a service defined for the USIM. An enabled
BDN service results in call restrictions for the ME. The call restrictions are
controlled by the Terminal. To ascertain the type of USIM and state of BDN the
ME runs the BDN capability request procedure during UICC-Terminal
initialisation. At the time an emergency call is setup using the emergency
call code read from the EF~ECC~, the Rel-4+ ME shall use the category of the
emergency service indicated.
##### 27.22.6.4.2 Conformance requirement
1) Recognising the state of the USIM (BDN enabled) the ME shall perform the
UICC initialisation procedure as specified.
2) The ME shall prevent call set-up to any number stored in EF~BDN~ if BDN
service is enabled.
3) The ME shall allow call set-up to any number stored in EF~BDN~ if BDN
service is disabled.
4) Any change to the EF~BDN~ or EF~EST~ does request PIN2.
5) The ME allows call set-up of an emergency call, even if this number is
stored in the USIM.

\- TS 31.111[15], clause 7.3.1.5
##### 27.22.6.4.3 Test purpose
1) To verify that the Terminal rejects call set-up to any number that has an
entry in EF~BDN~ if BDN service is enabled.
2) To verify that the Terminal allows call set-up to any number not stored in
EF~BDN~.
3) To verify that the Terminal allows emergency call set-up even if the number
is stored in EF~BDN~.
4) To verify that the Rel-4+ Terminal reads correctly the emergency service
category stored in EF~ECC.~
5) To verify that, if the UICC responds with \"not allowed\", the ME does not
set up the call.
6) To verify that, if the UICC responds with \"allowed, no modification\", the
ME shall set up the call (or the supplementary service operation) as proposed.
7) To verify that, if the UICC responds with \"allowed with modifications\",
the ME sets up the call in accordance with the response from the UICC. If the
modifications involve changing the dialled number the ME does not re-check
this modified number against the FDN list when FDN is enabled.
8) To verify that updating EF BDN or changing the status of BDN service shall
be performed by the use of second application PIN only.
9) To verify that the ME allows call set up to a BDN number if BDN service is
disabled.

##### 27.22.6.4.5 Test requirement
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequences 4.1 to 4.3.
#### 27.22.6.5 Barred Dialling Number (BDN) service handling for terminals not
supporting BDN
##### 27.22.6.5.1 Definition and applicability
Barred Dialling Numbers (BDN) is a service defined for the USIM. An enabled
BDN service results in call restrictions for the ME. The call restrictions are
controlled by the Terminal. If BDN is enabled, an ME which does not support
Call Control shall allow emergency calls but shall not allow MO-CS calls.
##### 27.22.6.5.2 Conformance requirement
1) Recognising the state of the USIM (BDN enabled) the ME shall perform the
UICC initialisation procedure as specified.
2) The ME shall prevent MO-CS call set-up to any number except to emergency
call numbers if the BDN service is enabled.
References:
\- Rel-5+: TS 22.101[22], clause 10 and A.21;
TS 31.102[14], clauses 4.2.44, 4.4.2.3, 5.1.1.2 and 5.3.2;
TS 31.111[15], clause 7.3.1.5
##### 27.22.6.5.3 Test purpose
1) To verify that the Terminal rejects MO-CS call set-up to any number except
to emergency call numbers if BDN service is enabled.
2) To verify that the Terminal allows emergency call set-up even if the BDN
service is enabled.
##### 27.22.6.5.4 Method of tests
##### 27.22.6.5.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-328 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure.
The call control service is available in the USIM Service Table.
The elementary files are coded as USIM Application Toolkit default with the
following exceptions:
Barred Dialling Number service is enabled.

##### 27.22.7.9.1.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-330 .H6}
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequence 1.1.
#### 27.22.7.10 Data available event
##### 27.22.7.10.1 Definition and applicability
See clause 3.2.2.
##### 27.22.7.10.2 Conformance requirements
The ME shall support the class \"e\" commands as defined in:
\- TS 31.111 [15].
Additionally the ME shall support ENVELOPE (EVENT DOWNLOAD - Data available).
If the ME supports option A.1/182, and if the UICC supports the UICC
suspension mechanism (SUSPEND UICC command), the ME may suspend the UICC after
entering the PSM. In this case, the ME shall successfully resume the UICC
before it can leave the PSM. Furthermore, the terminal shall maintain the
logical status as before the suspension and it shall resume the UICC for any
event for which it had previously registered: this includes events registered
with SET UP EVENT LIST proactive command, as specified in ETSI TS 102 221
clause 14.5.6
If the ME supports option A.1/182 and/or A.1/181, if the UE is in PSM and in
case the ME wants to deactivate the UICC, it shall wait until the current
proactive UICC session, if any, is terminated.
If the ME supports option A.1/183, and in case the UICC supports the UICC
suspension mechanism (SUSPEND UICC command), the ME may suspend the UICC
during the extended idle mode DRX cycle. In this case, the ME shall resume the
UICC successfully before the end of the extended idle mode DRX cycle or before
any other transmission to the network. Furthermore, the terminal shall
maintain the logical status as before the suspension and it shall resume the
UICC for any event for which it had previously registered: this includes
events registered with SET UP EVENT LIST proactive command, as specified in
ETSI TS 102 221 clause 14.5.6.
\- TS 102 221 [13]
\- TS 31.102 [14]
##### 27.22.7.10.3 Test purpose
To verify that the ME shall send an ENVELOPE (EVENT DOWNLOAD - Data available)
to the UICC after the ME receives a packet of data from the server by the BIP
channel previously opened.
To verify that the ME shall send an ENVELOPE (EVENT DOWNLOAD - Data available)
to the UICC when the ME resumes the UICC and receives a packet of data from
the server by the BIP channel previously opened.
To verify that the ME is performing BIP session correctly when the ME is
configured and using PSM or eDRX.
##### 27.22.7.10.4 Method of test
##### 27.22.7.10.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-340 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and only connected to the USS if the
USS is mentioned in the sequence table.. The elementary files are coded as
Toolkit default for sequence 1.1.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure. The UICC must have sent the SET UP EVENT LIST to the ME to
supply a set of events (event Data available).
For MEs supporting BIP related to GPRS in UDP (i.e condition C121 in table
B.1), The PROACTIVE COMMAND: OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1 shall be executed to open a
channel successfully at the beginning of the test. The corresponding Terminal
Response shall be TERMINAL RESPONSE: OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1A or TERMINAL RESPONSE:
OPEN CHANNEL 1.1.1B.
The PROACTIVE COMMAND: SEND DATA 1.1.1 shall be performed successfully to
detect the ME\'s port number, which has to be addressed by the network
simulator when data has to be transmitted to the card. The corresponding
Terminal Response shall be TERMINAL RESPONSE: SEND DATA 1.1.1.
The channel identifier value used for these tests is set to 1 as an example.
This channel identifier is dependent on the ME\'s default channel identifier
as declared in table A.2/27.
The following Bearer Parameters used are those defined in the default Test PDP
context3, for test cases using packet services:
Bearer Parameters: Same Bearer Parameters as defined in 27.22.4.27.2.4.1
GPRS Parameters: Same GPRS Parameters as defined in 27.22.4.27.2.4.1
UICC/ME interface transport level: Same UICC/ME transport interface level as
defined in 27.22.4.27.2.4.1
Data destination address : Same Data Destination Address as defined in
27.22.4.27.2.4.1.
For sequence 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 the default E-UTRAN/EPC UICC, the default
E-UTRAN parameters and the following parameters are used:
Network access name: TestGp.rs
User login: UserLog
User password: UserPwd
UICC/ME interface transport level: Same UICC/ME transport interface level as
defined in 27.22.4.27.6.4.1
Data destination address : Sames Data Destination Address as defined in
27.22.4.27.6.4.1.
For sequence 1.3 UICC suspension mechanism is indicated as supported by the
UICC in the UICC Maximum Power Consumption file (EF~UMPC~) and the PIN of the
USIM is enabled.
For sequence 1.4, UICC suspension mechanism is not indicated as supported by
the UICC in the UICC Maximum Power Consumption file (EF~UMPC~) and the PIN of
the USIM is disabled.
Prior to sequence 1.3 and 1.4, the ME was prepared to use PSM, has been
powered on, attached to the E-USS/NB-SS where the PSM use was accepted by the
network. Immediately after the Active Time (T3324) is started and the UE has
performed the PROFILE DOWNLOAD procedure, the test sequence shall be executed.
For sequence 1.5 the UICC suspension mechanism is indicated as supported by
the UICC in the UICC Maximum Power Consumption file (EF~UMPC~), the ME is
authorized to modify the polling interval and/or disable the UICC interface
during extended DRX cycle in EF~AD~ (Administrative Data) and the PIN of the
USIM is enabled.
Prior to sequence 1.5, the ME was prepared to use eDRX, has been powered on,
attached to the E-USS/NB-SS where the eDRX use was accepted by the network and
performed the PROFILE DOWNLOAD procedure.

Additionally the ME shall be able to carry out the IMS registration procedure
according to TS 34.229-1 [36], Annex C.2.
##### 27.22.7.20.1.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-346 .H6}
To verify that the ME informs the UICC that an Event: Incoming IMS data has
occurred using the ENVELOPE (EVENT DOWNLOAD -- Incoming IMS data) command when
the ME received a SIP message for the card, including an UICC IARI.

The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the Network Simulator (NWS).
The ME shall be powered on and perform the PROFILE DOWNLOAD procedure.
The ME activates the required bearer, discovers P-CSCF and registers with the
value from the ISIM to IMS services. The ME has registered the IARI associated
with active applications intalled on the UICC, stored in EF_UICCIARI on the
ISIM.
The channel identifier value used for these tests is set to 1 as an example.
This channel identifier is dependent on the ME\'s default channel identifier
as declared in table A.2/27.
The E-UTRAN/EPC ISIM-UICC with the following execptions is used:
**EF~IST~ (ISIM Service Table)**
EF**~IST~** shall be configured as defined in 27.22.2C.3.2 with the exception

The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequence 1.1 to 1.2.
### 27.22.8 MO SHORT MESSAGE CONTROL BY USIM
#### 27.22.8.1 Definition and applicability
See clause 3.2.2.
#### 27.22.8.2 Conformance requirement
The ME shall support the MO SEND SHORT MESSAGE CONTROL facility as defined in:
\- TS 31.111 [15] clause 7.3.2.
The ME shall also support the SEND SMS facility as specified in
\- TS 31.111 [15] clause 6.4.10
#### 27.22.8.3 Test purpose
To verify that for all SMS sending attempts, even those resulting from a SEND
SHORT MESSAGE proactive UICC command, the ME shall first pass the
RP_destination_address of the service center and the TP_Destination_Address to
the UICC, using the ENVELOPE (MO Short Message CONTROL).
To verify that if the UICC responds with \'90 00\', the ME shall send the SMS
with the address unchanged.
To verify that if the UICC responds with \'93 00\', the ME shall not send the
SMS and may retry the command.
To verify that if the UICC returns response data, the ME shall use the
response data appropriately to send the SM as proposed, not send the SM, or
send the SM using the data supplied by the UICC.
To verify that, in the case where the initial SM request results from a
proactive SEND SHORT MESSAGE, if the MO SMS CONTROL result is \"not allowed\"
or \"allowed with modifications\", the ME shall inform the UICC using TERMINAL
RESPONSE \"interaction with call control by UICC or MO short message control
by USIM, action not allowed\".

##### 27.22.11.1.3 Test purpose
To verify that when the service \"call control on GPRS by USIM\" is available
in the USIM Service Table, then for all PS PDP Context Activation (including
those resulting from an OPEN CHANNEL proactive UICC command where UTRAN is
selected), the ME shall first pass the corresponding Activate PDP Context
message to the UICC, using the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command. The ME shall
also pass to the UICC in the ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL) command the current
serving cell.
To verify that the ME interpret the UICC returns response correctly.
##### 27.22.11.1.4 Method of tests
##### 27.22.11.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-350 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the USS/SS. Prior to this test
the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE DOWNLOAD
procedure.
The default GERAN/UTRAN/EPC UICC, the default GERAN/UTRAN parameters and the
following parameters are used:
Network access name: TestGp.rs
User login: UserLog
User password: UserPwd
UICC/ME interface transport level
Transport format: TCP
Port number: 44444
Data destination address: 01.01.01.01 (as an example)
The GERAN/UTRAN parameters of the system simulator are:
\- Mobile Country Code (MCC) = 001;
\- Mobile Network Code (MNC) = 01;
\- Location Area Code (LAC) = 0001;- Cell Identity Value = 0001;
\- The simulator must accept connections requests for APNs: TestGp.rs,
Test12.rs and Test13.rs
The elementary files are coded as USIM Application Toolkit default with the
following exceptions:
\- The call control on GPRS by USIM service is available in the USIM Service
Table.

27.22.11.5 Test requirement
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequences 1.1 to 1.7.
### 27.22.12 Change eCall mode
#### 27.22.12.1 Definition and applicability
See clause 3.2.2.
#### 27.22.12.2 Conformance requirement
The UE shall support eCall feature on the USIM and is able to change the eCall
mode as specified in:
> \- TS 31.102 [14] clause 5.3.40.
#### 27.22.12.3 Test purpose
To verify that the ME is able to change the eCall mode after the re-
configuration of the USIM from eCall only support to eCall and Normal call
support, or vice versa, by changing the content of the USIM Service Table,
and/or by changing the content of the EF~EST~, where the ME shall be notified
of the changes by using the REFRESH proactive command.
#### 27.22.12.4 Method of test
##### 27.22.12.4.1 Initial conditions
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and connected to the E-USS or USS.
For test sequences 1.1 -- 1.3 the E-UTRAN parameters of the E-USS are:
> \- Mobile Country Code (MCC) = 246;
>
> \- Mobile Network Code (MNC) = 81;
>
> \- Tracking Area Code (TAC) = 0001.
>
> For test sequences 1.4 and 1.5 the GERAN or UTRAN parameters of the USS are:
Mobile Country Code (MCC) = 246;
\- Mobile Network Code (MNC) = 81;
\- Location Area Code (LAC) = 0001.
The elementary files are coded as the default E-UTRAN/EPC UICC, with the
following exceptions:
For test sequences 1.1, 1.4:
\- EF~UST~ the services (Service n°2) Fixed Dialling Numbers (FDN), (Service
n°4) Service Dialling Numbers (SDN) and (Service n°89) eCall Data are
available
\- EF~EST~ has the Service n°2 Fixed Dialling Numbers (FDN) is enabled
\- EF~FDN~ contains only two entries: eCall test number (123) and eCall
reconfiguration number (345)
\- EF~SDN~ the last two entries contains two entries: eCall test number (456)
and eCall reconfiguration number (678)
For test sequences 1.2, and 1.5:
\- EF~UST~ the services (Service n°2) Fixed Dialling Numbers (FDN), (Service
n°4) Service Dialling Numbers (SDN) and (Service n°89) eCall Data are
available
\- EF~EST~ has the Service n°2 Fixed Dialling Numbers (FDN) disabled
\- EF~FDN~ contains only two entries: eCall test number (123) and eCall
reconfiguration number (345)
\- EF~SDN~ the last two entries contains two entries: eCall test number (456)
and eCall reconfiguration number (678)
For test sequence 1.3:
\- EF~UST~ the services (Service n°2) Fixed Dialling Numbers (FDN), (Service
n°4) Service Dialling Numbers (SDN), (Service n°99) URI support by UICC and
(Service n°112) eCall Data over IMS are available.
\- EF~EST~ has the Service n°2 Fixed Dialling Numbers (FDN) enabled
\- EF~FDNURI~ contains only two entries: eCall test number (123) and eCall
reconfiguration number (345)
\- EF~SDNURI~ the last two entries contains two entries: eCall test number
(456) and eCall reconfiguration number (678)
PIN of the USIM is disabled.
Prior to this test the ME shall have been powered on, performed the PROFILE
DOWNLOAD procedure and registered to the network.

##### 27.22.12.4.3 Test requirement
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequence 1.1 to 1.5.
### 27.22.13 CALL CONTROL on PDU Session Establishment for NG-RAN
#### 27.22.13.1 Procedure for Mobile Originated calls
##### 27.22.13.1.1 Definition and applicability
See clause 3.2.2.
##### 27.22.13.1.2 Conformance requirement
The ME shall support the CALL CONTROL facility as defined in:
\- 3GPP TS 31.111 [15] clause 7.3.1.6, clause 7.3.1.10, clause 8.143.
\- 3GPP TS 24.501 [40] clause 6.4.1, clause 8.3.1, clause 9.11.4.6 and clause
9.11.4.15.
##### 27.22.13.1.3 Test purpose
To verify that when the service 128 \"Call Control on PDU Session by USIM\" is
available in the USIM Service Table, then for all PDU Session Establishment
Requests (including those resulting from an OPEN CHANNEL proactive command
where NG-RAN is selected), the ME shall first pass the corresponding PDU
Session Establishment Request message to the UICC, using the ENVELOPE (CALL
CONTROL) command. The ME shall also pass to the UICC in the ENVELOPE (CALL
CONTROL) command the current serving cell.
To verify the PDU Session Establishment Request parameters are used in the
ENVELOPE (CALL CONTROL), as defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 [40].
To verify UICC/ME CALL CONTROL modify only the following parameters:
\- SM PDU DN request container; and
\- operator specific parameters in Extended Protocol configuration options,
included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
To verify that the ME interpret the UICC returns response correctly.
##### 27.22.13.1.4 Method of tests
##### 27.22.13.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-352 .H6}
The ME is connected to the USIM Simulator and the NG-SS. Prior to this test
the ME shall have been powered on and performed the PROFILE DOWNLOAD
procedure.
The default NG-RAN UICC and the following parameters are used:
PDU session:
> DNN: TestGp.rs
>
> PDU Session Type: IPv4v6
UICC/ME interface transport level
Transport format: TCP
Port number: 44444
Data destination address: 01.01.01.01 (as an example)
The ME shall be configured with following URSP rules.
> Rule Precedence =1
>
> Traffic Descriptor:
>
> DNN=TestGp.rs
>
> Route Selection Descriptor:
>
> Precedence=1
>
> Network Slice Selection, S-NSSAI: 01 01 01 01 (ST: MBB, SD: 010101)
>
> SSC Mode Selection: SSC Mode 1
>
> Access Type preference: 3GPP access
>
> Rule Precedence = 2
>
> Traffic Descriptor:
>
> DNN= Test12.rs
>
> Route Selection Descriptor:
>
> Precedence =1
>
> Network Slice Selection, S-NSSAI: 01 01 01 02 (ST: MBB, SD: 010102)
>
> SSC Mode Selection: SSC Mode 1\ \ Access Type preference: 3GPP access
The NG-RAN parameters of the system simulator are:
> \- Mobile Country Code (MCC) = 001;
>
> \- Mobile Network Code (MNC) = 01;
>
> \- Tracking Area Code (TAC) = 000001;
>
> \- NG-RAN Cell Id = 0001 (36 bits).
The Allowed S-NSSAI list is configured in NG-SS as \'01 01 01 01\' and \'01 01
01 02\'.
The system simulator should accept connections requests for DNNs: TestGp.rs,
Test12.rs.
The elementary files are coded as USIM Application Toolkit default with the
following exceptions:
> \- The call control on PDU session by USIM service is available in the USIM
> Service Table.

##### 27.22.13.1.5 Test requirement
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequences 1.1 to 1.7.
### 27.22.14 ENVELOPE SMS-PP Data Download on NAS messages
#### 27.22.14.1 Routing Indicator Data update via DL NAS TRANSPORT messages
##### 27.22.14.1.1 Definition and applicability
See clause 3.2.2.
##### 27.22.14.1.2 Conformance requirement
The ME shall support the Proactive UICC: SMS-PP Data Download facility as
defined in the following technical specifications:
\- 3GPP TS 31.111 [15] clause 5, clause 7.1, clause 8.1, clause 8.7, clause
8.13 and clause 11.
\- 3GPP TS 31.115 [28] clause 4.
\- 3GPP TS 23.038 [7] clause 4.
The ME shall support the Procedure for SMS-PP data download via DL NAS
TRANSPORT messages as defined in the following technical specifications:
\- 3GPP TS 31.111 [15] clause 7.1.1.1a.
##### 27.22.14.1.3 Test purpose
To verify that when:
\- the service \"data download via SMS Point-to-point\" is available in the
USIM Service Table
and
\- the ME receives a DL NAS TRANSPORT message that includes
\- a UE parameters update transparent container containing a UE parameters
update data set with UE parameters update data set type with value
\"1\"=Routing Indicator update data
\- containing a secure packet constructed as an SMS-Deliver (as specified in
3GPP TS 23.040 [5]) with:
\- protocol identifier = SIM data download; and
\- data coding scheme = class 2 message
\- and the integrity check of the message was successful
then
\- the ME shall
\- pass the message transparently to the UICC using the ENVELOPE (SMS-PP
DOWNLOAD) command as defined in TS 31.111 [15] clause 7.1.1.2
\- the ME shall not display or alert the user
\- the secure packet is coded as a Command Packet formatted as Short Message
Point to Point (as specified in 3GPP TS 31.115 [28]).
To verify that the ME interprets the UICC returns response correctly.

##### 27.22.14.1.5 Test requirement
The ME shall operate in the manner defined in expected sequences 1.1 to 1.4.
#### 27.22.14.2 Steering of Roaming via DL NAS TRANSPORT message
##### 27.22.14.2.1 Definition and applicability
See clause 3.2.2.
##### 27.22.14.2.2 Conformance requirement
The ME shall support the Proactive UICC: SMS-PP Data Download facility as
defined in the following technical specifications:
\- 3GPP TS 31.111 [15] clause 5, clause 7.1, clause 8.1, clause 8.7, clause
8.13 and clause 11.
\- 3GPP TS 31.115 [28] clause 4.
\- 3GPP TS 23.038 [7] clause 4.
The ME shall support the Procedure for SMS-PP data download via DL NAS
TRANSPORT messages as defined in the following technical specifications:
\- 3GPP TS 31.111 [15] clause 7.1.1.1a.
The ME shall support the steering of roaming procedure as defined in:
\- 3GPP TS 23.122 [29] clause 4.4.6.
##### 27.22.14.2.3 Test purpose
To verify that when the service \"data download via SMS Point-to-point\" is
available in the USIM Service Table and the ME receives a DL NAS TRANSPORT
message that includes:
\- a SOR transparent container information element with list type with value
\"0\"= secured packet, containing a secured packet constructed as an SMS-
Deliver (as specified in TS 23.040 [8]) with:
> \- protocol identifier = SIM data download;
>
> \- data coding scheme = class 2 message;
and the integrity check of the message was successful, then the ME shall:
> \- pass the message transparently to the UICC using the ENVELOPE (SMS-PP
> DOWNLOAD) command as defined in 3GPP TS 31.111 [15] clause 7.1.1.2;
>
> \- not display or alert the user.
Where the secured packet is coded as a Command Packet formatted as Short
Message Point to Point (as specified in TS 31.115 [28]).
For sequence 2.1:
To verify that when the ME receives a USAT REFRESH command qualifier of type
\"Steering of Roaming\", it (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [29], clause
4.4.6):
> \- deletes formerly forbidden PLMNs provided as allowed in the REFRESH
> command from the Forbidden PLMN list and from the Forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
> service list. This includes any information stored in the UICC.
For sequence 2.3:
To verify that when ME receives a USAT REFRESH command qualifier of type
\"Steering of Roaming\", it (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [29], clause
4.4.6):
\- replaces the highest priority entries in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the ME with the list provided
in the REFRESH command;
> Note: This requirement is implicitly verified when the ME attempts to obtain
> service on a higher priority PLMN.
>
> \- deletes formerly forbidden PLMNs provided as allowed in the REFRESH
> command from the Forbidden PLMN list and from the Forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
> service list. This includes any information stored in the UICC;
>
> \- considers new information provided in subsequent attempts to access a
> higher priority PLMN;
and
> \- attempts to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in 3GPP
> TS 23.122 [29], clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that controls
> periodic attempts has expired.

##### 27.22.14.3.1 Definition and applicability
See clause 3.2.2.
##### 27.22.14.3.2 Conformance requirement
The ME shall support the Proactive UICC: SMS-PP Data Download facility as
defined in the following technical specifications:
\- TS 31.111 [15] clause 5, clause 7.1, clause 8.1, clause 8.7, clause 8.13
and clause 11.

\- TS 23.038 [7] clause 4.
The ME shall support the Procedure for SMS-PP data download via REGISTRATION
ACCEPT messages as defined in the following technical specifications:
\- TS 31.111 [15] clause 7.1.1.1a.
The ME shall support the steering of roaming procedure as defined in:
\- TS 23.122 [29] clause 4.4.6.
##### 27.22.14.3.3 Test purpose
To verify that when the service \"data download via SMS Point-to-point\" is
available in the USIM Service Table and the ME receives a REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message that includes:
\- a SOR transparent container information element with list type with value
\"0\"= secure packet containing a secure packet constructed as an SMS-Deliver
(as specified in TS 23.040 [5] with:
\- protocol identifier = SIM data download;
\- data coding scheme = class 2 message;
and the integrity check of the message was successful then the ME shall:
\- pass the message transparently to the UICC using the ENVELOPE (SMS-PP
DOWNLOAD) command as defined in TS 31.111 [15] clause 7.1.1.2;
\- not display or alert the user;
Where the secure packet is coded as a Command Packet formatted as Short
Message Point to Point (as specified in TS 31.115 [41])).
To verify that the ME interprets the UICC returns response correctly.
##### 27.22.14.3.4 Method of Test
