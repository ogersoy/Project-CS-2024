# Introduction
The 3GPP Packet Switch Streaming (PSS) provides a framework for Internet
Protocol (IP) based streaming applications in by specifying protocols and
codecs within the 3GPP system. Protocols for control signalling, capability
exchange, media transport, rate adaptation and protection are specified.
Codecs for speech, natural and synthetic audio, video, still images, bitmap
graphics, vector graphics, timed text and text are specified.
The 3GPP Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS) provides a
framework for broadcast and Multicast streaming and download applications in
3GPP networks supporting the MBMS bearer service. The MBMS user services are
enabled by a set of specified media codecs, formats and transport/application
protocols. MBMS user services are built on top of the MBMS bearer service.
There are two delivery methods for the MBMS user services: download and
streaming.
The 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) enables the deployment of IP multimedia
applications. PSS and MBMS User Services are IP multimedia services but they
were specified before IMS. IMS brings enablers and features to operators and
subscribers that can enhance the experience of PSS and MBMS User Services.
The purpose of the present document is the specification of use of the IMS to
initiate and control PSS and MBMS User Service. This should enable deployment
of PSS and MBMS user services as IMS services. Note that the present
specification uses components of the 3GPP PSS, 3GPP MBMS , ETSI TISPAN IPTV
and Open IPTV Forum standards specifications.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the usage of IMS protocols to initiate and
control PSS and MBMS Streaming and Download User Services based applications.
It applies to IMS enabled UEs that also implement PSS and/or MBMS clients.
Existing protocols that are used are described in reference to relevant
specifications.
The present document is applicable to IP-based packet-switched networks over
3GPP systems.
The present document includes information applicable to network operators,
service providers and manufacturers.

## 4.1 Introduction
This clause describes the IMS initiated and controlled PSS and MBMS User
Service system. It gives a description of the architecture, the role of each
new and modified entity and interface.
The description of the PSS system is in 3GPP TS 22.233 [9] and 3GPP TS 26.233
[10]. The description of the MBMS system is in 3GPP TS 23.246 [4].
## 4.2 Architecture
### 4.2.1 Non IMS 3GPP PSS and MBMS User Service architecture
Figure 1 describes the Non IMS PSS and MBMS User Service architecture.
{width="6.635416666666667in" height="1.8847222222222222in"}
Figure 1: Non IMS PSS and MBMS User Service Architecture
The sources consist of all multimedia content in streaming or file form. E.g.
live encoders processing in feeds from TV or Music Radio channels.
The PSS server performs control and streaming delivery functions on a Unicast
access type.
The BM-SC performs control and streaming/download delivery functions in a
hybrid Unicast/Multicast/Broadcast access type.
The core network and RAN enable the mobility, and provides IP connectivity
over Unicast/Multicast/Broadcast bearers between the servers and the clients.
The PSS & MBMS client, located in the UE, performs service selection and
initiation, receives and present the content to the user.
The PSS client interfaces to the PSS server transparently through the Packet
Switch Network. The PSS client can discover the PSS services via multiple
means like e.g. browsing. The session description protocol is SDP. The session
control protocol is RTSP. The transport protocol is RTP.
The MBMS client interfaces to the BM-SC via layer 3 protocols defined between
the UE and the GGSN and the GGSN with the BM-SC (Gmb).
The PSS and MBMS client interfaces via the Radio interface to the RAN and the
CN.
The interface between the sources and the PSS server & BM-SC are outside the
scope of the present document.
### 4.2.2 IMS based PSS and MBMS User Service architecture
Figure 2 describes the IMS based PSS and MBMS User Service functional
architecture. In addition to PSS and MBMS User Service functions, the IMS core
and various functions are added.
Figure 2: IMS based PSS and MBMS functional architecture
In figure 2:
\- Solid lines are standard interfaces. E.g. interface between PSS server and
UE4.

User Service Description information exists in a BMSC.USD/A of a \"Non-IMS\"
BM-SC, or in a PSS portal, the SSF takes USD information from them. The SSF
may then reformat the USD information before delivery to the UE. The reformat
may include information for the IMS UE to build a SIP URI to initiate PSS and
MBMS user service.
\- SCF: Service Control Function (SCF): it provides service logic and
functions required to support execution of such logic. It does service
authorization during session initiation and session modification, which
includes checking PSS and MBMS user\'s service subscription in order to allow
or deny access to the service. It selects the relevant PSS and MBMS media
functions. In addition to the procedures specified in this document, the SCF
shall support the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [7]:

between SIP and RTSP to offer control of PSS servers as defined in clause
8.2.3.5 and also control of Recording servers as defined in clause 20.1.4. It
proxies RTSP messaging from the UE and SIP/RTSP translation towards the PSS
server and Recording server. Note that these functions can be incorporated
into the SCF, the PSS Server or a new stand-alone entity. In addition to the
procedures specified in this document, the PSS Adapter shall support the
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [7] for the terminating UA functional
entity.

\- The PSS and MBMS UE Capabilities XML document defined in Annex G.
\- The RDF/XML document for the PSS base vocabulary specified in Annex F of TS
26.234 [8].
These 2 documents are sent during the Service Discovery procedure. See clause
6.
### 4.4.3 Storage location
PSS and MBMS user profile and UE capabilities information may be stored in the
following locations:
\- Application Server functions.
\- In a stand-alone server associated with one or more Application Server
functions.
\- In the HSS as transparent data associated to these Application Server
functions.
The first and second options are recommended for data to be accessed by 3rd
party application server functions. In the first and second case the
Application Server function or the stand-alone server may exhibit the
behaviour of an XDMS.
User data stored in the HSS can be accessed by Application Servers at the Sh
reference point.
A subset of PSS and MBMS user-profile information may be accessed from the
User Equipment at the Ut reference point.
For the purpose of personalized service selection, the SSF may need to access
user data.
In the case when such user data is stored in the HSS, it can be accessed by
the SSF at the Sh reference point when the SSF is in the same domain.
On the contrary, when such user data is stored in the AS or in a stand alone
server associated with one or more application servers or if the SSF in not in
the same domain as the HSS, the user data can be accessed by the SSF using an
interface that is out of scope for this release.
The SSF may also request notification of user data updates.
# 5 Service Provider Discovery
## 5.1 Introduction
In order for the UE to access the PSS and MBMS User Service using IMS, it
shall implement an IMS client that registers to the IM CN Subsystem [7]. This
assumes that the UE has attached to a network and established PS connectivity
through a PDP context according to 3GPP TS 23.060 [16] and has successfully
completed the P-CSCF discovery procedure [7]. Once the UE is registered to the
IM CN Subsystem, it can proceed to the Discovery of the PSS and MBMS User
Service.
This clause specifies how the UE performs the PSS and MBMS Service Provider
Discovery. This is equivalent to discovering the list of IMS PSI of the SDF
and relative Service Providers. There are several means for the UE to acquire
this information. The UE shall implement the DNS based Service Provider
Discovery as defined in clause 5.2. Other methods are optional.
## 5.2 DNS
In this case, the SDFs are discovered using the DNS SRV mechanism in
accordance with RFC 2782 [17], with the following input parameters:
\- Service: Defined as \"pss-mbms-user-service\".
NOTE: to be registered with IANA.
\- Protocol: Can take values \"http\" or \"sip\". Specifies the protocol to
contain the particular service.
\- Domain name: the domain for which the returned records are valid. The value
can be derived from the ISIM. Without ISIM it can be derived from USIM
together with MCC (Mobile Country Code) and MNC (Mobile Network Code)
according to TS 23.003 [29]. If not possible, the domain name can be derived
from network attachment phase (DHCP server). Manual configuration overrides
these possibilities.
{width="3.5381944444444446in" height="1.5729166666666667in"}
Figure 5: Service Provider Discovery with DNS
The output of the DNS SRV lookup is an ordered list of domain name, each
pointing to a SDF server available within the specified Domain name.
## 5.3 Others

Figure 6: Service Discovery with Subscribe/Notify
1) The UE sends a SIP SUBSCRIBE message to the IM CN subsystem. It should
indicate its capabilities in the message.
2) The IM CN subsystem forwards the request to the SDF, e.g. thanks to an iFC.
3) The SDF determines the proper service discovery information, e.g. according
to the UE capabilities, the user\'s profile (Personalized Service Discovery).
The user profile may be retrieved from the HSS or any other entity where it is
stored.
4) The SDF sends a SIP 200 OK response to the IM CN subsystem, which forwards
it to the UE.
5) The SDF sends a SIP NOTIFY message to the UE, with service discovery
information that includes the SSF(s) address(es).
6) The IM CN subsystem relays the SIP NOTIFY message back to the UE, with the
service discovery information related to PSS and MBMS user service.
7) The UE sends back a SIP 200 OK response to the IM CN subsystem.
8) The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP 200 OK to the SDF.
### 6.2.2 Procedures at the UE
#### 6.2.2.1 Introduction
The UE shall generate a SUBSCRIBE request. The behaviour of the UE when
processing a SUBSCRIBE request shall conform to 3GPP TS 24.229 [7].
#### 6.2.2.2 Subscription
When the UE intends to retrieve service attachment information from the SDF,
it shall generate a SUBSCRIBE request for the \"ua-profile\" event package
defined in [28] and extended as described in Annex Y of [24].
The contents of the SUBSCRIBE request shall be as follows:
\- The value of the Request-URI shall be set to one of following:
\- - the PSI of the SDF which is retrieved using SDF Discovery procedures in
clause 5 Service Provider Discovery; or
\- - the public user identity of the end user (when the UE does not know the
PSI of the SDF).
\- The From and To header shall be set to the public user identity of the
user.
\- The Accept header shall include the content-type identifier that
corresponds to the registered MIME type of XML documents representing UE
capabilities included in the body, See clause 4.4.2:
\- A first Content Type set to \"application/3gpp-ims-pss-mbms-ue-
capabilities+xml\".
\- A second Content Type set to \"application/rdf+xml\".
\- The Event header shall be set to the \"ua-profile\" event package.
\- The Event parameters shall be set as follows:
\- The \"profile-type\" parameter shall be set to \"application\".
\- The \"vendor\", \"model\" and \"version\" parameter values shall be set to
values specified by the implementer of the user equipment, as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [7].
\- The \"appids\" parameter shall be present and set to
\"urn:org:3gpp:applications:ims-pss-mbms-service-discovery\".
The UE shall include a SIP SUBSCRIBE multipart/mixed content-type message body
associated with the appid including the PSS and MBMS UE Device Capabilities
defined in Annex G and the RDF/XML document describing the PSS base vocabulary
defined in Annex F of TS 26.234 [8].
Upon receipt of a 2xx response to the SUBSCRIBE request, the UE shall store
the information for the established dialog and the expiration time as
indicated in the Expires header of the received response.
The UE shall automatically refresh the subscription, either 600 seconds before
the expiration time if the initial subscription was for greater than 1 200
seconds, or when half of the time has expired if the initial subscription was
for 1 200 seconds or less. If a SUBSCRIBE request to refresh a subscription
fails with a non-481 response, the UE shall still consider the original
subscription valid for the duration of the most recently known \"Expires\"
value according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [7]. Otherwise, the UE shall consider the
subscription invalid and start a new initial subscription according to 3GPP TS
24.229 [7].
#### 6.2.2.3 Receiving notifications
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription, the application within the UE shall parse the XML document
contained in the message body. The XML document schema is defined in Annex H.
The definition of each parameter in the XML document is defined in 5.2.2.3 of
[24]
The list of parameters in the XML document shall be used for service selection
information retrieval according to\ clause 7.
When parsing the list of parameters the UE shall take the following action:
\- information relates to an SSF with whom the UE has already an entry.
\- If the \"\@version\" attribute is present and has not the same value or if
not present, then the UE performs the following actions:
\- for parameters related to this SSF already present in the UE: the UE shall
update these parameters with the new values sent by the SDF. If the
Segment\@Version has not the same value, the UE shall update user service
selection information from the SSF before using it,
\- for parameters related to this SSF not present in the UE: the UE shall
store the new parameters.
\- If the \"\@version\" attribute is present and has the same value, the UE
shall not update the stored SSF information.
\- information relates to an SSF not known by the UE: the UE creates a new
entry for this SSF with all indicated parameters.
After all elements have been processed, the UE shall return a 200 OK response
to the NOTIFY request.
Failure to perform subscription refresh does not imply that there is a loss of
communication to SSF or SCF. The UE has an option to continue using the lists
of parameters from the last NOTIFY.
After deregistration, the UE may keep stored information on per user basis. As
for subscription refresh, the UE may use the stored information if initial
subscription fails after a new registration.
### 6.2.3 Procedures at the SDF
The SDF addresses are determined by the UE using any of the alternatives as
defined in clause 5.
When the SDF receives a SUBSCRIBE request, it may perform user\'s identity
verification as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [7]. After successful user
identification, if a User Profile is available it is possible to perform
personalization of the body (Service Attachment Information) of the NOTIFY
request.
The SDF shall examine the parameters specified in the SIP SUBSCRIBE body and
shall then record UE capabilities information as part of the user profile
data.
NOTE: The UE capabilities that are recorded as part of the user profile may be
used by the SSF for personalization purposes.
In case of successful subscription, the SDF shall generate a SIP 200 OK in
response to the SUBSCRIBE request. The SDF shall then send a NOTIFY request
immediately.
The contents of the NOTIFY request shall be as follows:
\- The Event header shall be set to the \"ua-profile\" event package.
\- The \"effective-by\" parameter for the event header shall be set to 0.
\- The content type shall be set to \"application/3gpp-ims-pss-mbms-service-
discovery+xml\";
\- The message body shall contain an XML document listing SSF addresses and
the means of connecting to the SSFs for retrieving service selection
information defined in Annex H. The definition of each parameter in the XML
document is defined in 5.2.2.3 of [24]. The \"\@technology\" element name
indicates the technology used to for delivering service selection information.
It shall be set to the \"openmobilealliance.org_bcast\".
When any parameter of service configuration information has changed, the SDF
may generate a NOTIFY request including new service configuration information.
# 7 User Service Description retrieval
## 7.1 Introduction
User Service Description retrieval can be done in several ways
\- By retrieving OMA BCAST Service Guide information [27] from the SSF. See
clause 7.2;
\- By retrieving MBMS USD from the SSF as defined in 3GPP TS 26.346 [11]
clause 5.2;
\- By executing the Procedure for providing missing parameters before session
initiation described in clauses 8.2.2 and 8.3.2 for PSS and MBMS user service
respectively.
## 7.2 User Service Description retrieval for PSS and MBMS
### 7.2.1 Procedures at the UE
#### 7.2.1.1 Procedure for Service Personalisation
For HTTP-based data retrieval, when sending the HTTP request to the SSFs, the
UE may provide personalized information to enable a personalized answer. This
shall be done by adding the X-3GPP-Intended-Identity HTTP header to the
request to transmit the public identity.
The authentication shall follow 3GPP TS 33.222 [20].
The UE shall implement Transport Layer Security (TLS), as described in 3GPP TS
33.222 [20].
#### 7.2.1.2 Request of OMA BCAST ESG
In the pull model of unicast delivery of an OMA BCAST ESG, the HTTP protocol
shall be used conforming to OMA BCAST Service_Guide [27], clause 5.4.3.
#### 7.2.1.3 Use of Service Description information
The UE shall use parameters received from the SSF for session initiation.
NOTE: There is no restriction on the UE to use any parameter received from SSF
also for other purposes than session initiation, e.g. to present SSF
information to the user.
The UE may store a part of the ESG information covering certain period of time
and refresh this information periodically This avoid the UE to contact the SSF
every time the user needs to consult the ESG.
If the UE is unable to contact any discovered SSF, it shall not delete stored
information immediately.
### 7.2.2 Procedures at the SSF
#### 7.2.2.1 Authentication and authorisation in case of personalized service
description information
In case of service selection personalisation the SSF shall authenticate the
user.
The authentication shall follow 3GPP TS 33.222 [20].
The SSF shall implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) as described in 3GPP TS
33.222 [20].
An authentication proxy (AP) may exist between the UE and the SSF in which
case the behaviour of the AP is assumed to conform to 3GPP TS 24.423 [21].
If an Authentication Proxy (AP) is provided in the path of the HTTP request,
then the SSF receives an HTTP request from a trusted source (the AP) and the
request contains an HTTP X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity header (3GPP TS 24.109 [22])
that includes an asserted identity of the user. In this case the SSF does not
need to authenticate the user, but just provide authorization to access the
requested resource.
If an HTTP X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity header (3GPP TS 24.109 [22]) is not
present in the HTTP request or if the request is received from a non-trusted
source, then the SSF needs to authenticate the user prior to providing
personalise information by applying the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 33.222
[20] and
authorize or deny authorization depending on the authenticated identity.
#### 7.2.2.2 Procedure for Service Personalization
If the public user identity information is present in the query from the UE,
the SSF shall extract it to customize/personalize the service information that
is returned in the query response.
The SSF shall use the public user identity that is specified in the X-3GPP-
Intended-Identity header or the Xâ€‘3GPPAsserted-Identity header if an
authentication proxy is used to fetch the corresponding user profile
associated with the user. For instance, the Parental Control (if present)
should be used to remove unsuitable elements from the COD listings that are
returned to the UE.
#### 7.2.2.3 Delivery of OMA BCAST ESG
The procedure for retrieving OMA BCAST service selection information is
employed to retrieve one or more Service Guide Delivery Descriptors (SGDD)
and/or Service Guide Delivery Units (SGDU). The SGDD describes service level
information as well as access information to the Service Guide fragments. The
SGDU is the transport-independent network structure for encapsulating Service
Guide fragments.
When the ESG SSF receives a HTTP POST request, if personalization headers are
presents (in the form of key-value pairs) it shall use those headers in order
to build a personalized response. For instance, the ESG SSF may use the
provided user identity to retrieve the associated Parental Control Level in
the user profile. This Parental Control Level would then be used to remove non
suitable elements from the ESG data that are sent back. The provided user
identity may also be used to retrieve a personalized ESG using the method in
OMA BCAST Service Guide [27], clause 5.4.3.3.The ESG SSF shall send an HTTP
response conforming to OMA BCAST Service Guide [27], clause 5.4.3.1. The body
of the HTTP response shall contain an XML document with SGResponse data,
conforming to OMA BCAST Service Guide[27], clause 5.4.3.1.1.
# 8 Streaming session and media control
## 8.1 General
This clause specifies the procedures and protocols used for the IMS based
initiation and control of streaming sessions on PSS or MBMS User Service.
The client shall use SIP to initiate and control PSS and MBMS streaming
sessions. Once a PSS streaming session is established, the client shall use
RTSP protocols to perform media control.
## 8.2 PSS Streaming
### 8.2.1 PSS Media codecs and formats
PSS Media codecs and formats defined in 3GPP TS 26.234 [8] are applicable to
the present document for IMS initiated and controlled PSS services.
### 8.2.2 Procedure for providing missing parameters
#### 8.2.2.1 Procedures at the UE
If the UE does not have all the information it needs to form an SDP offer, the
UE shall send a SIP OPTIONS message:
\- â€¢ The \"Request-URI\" is related to the PSS session that the user wants to
activate. The Request-URI shall be composed of a user and domain part as
defined as follows:
\- The user part contains the content identifier, retrieved from user service
description information from SSF.
\- For COD service, content identifier is constructed by \"PSS_COD_\\", wherein content-id shall be globalContentID defined in [27].
\- For Live service, content identifier shall be globalServiceID defined in
[27] or serviceId defined in [11].
\- The domain part is the Service Provider domain name, obtained from SSF.
\- â€¢ The TO header shall contain the same URI as in the \"Request-URI\"
parameter.
\- The other headers shall be set according to TS 24.229 [7].
Upon reception of the 200 OK including SDP, the UE may initiate PSS session as
described in clause 8.2.3.
#### 8.2.2.2 Procedures at the SCF
When receiving the SIP OPTIONS message, the SCF shall select the appropriate
PSS Adapter and forward the SIP request to the appropriate PSS Adapter by
changing the \"Request-URI\" accordingly.
The SCF shall not change the user-part of the TO header in order to keep the
content-id in the OPTIONS request.
#### 8.2.2.3 Procedures at the PSS Adapter
When receiving SIP OPTIONS request, the PSS Adapter shall examine the content
identifier present in the user-part of the TO header.
If the PSS adapter does not have the user service description information, it
shall send an RTSP DESCRIBE message to the PSS server to retrieve the user
service description information
Then, the PSS Adapter shall answer with the user service description
information of the content delivery channel in SDP as requested by the request
URI.
### 8.2.3 PSS Streaming Session initiation

{width="6.689583333333333in" height="3.734027777777778in"}
Figure 7: IMS based PSS initiation
NOTE 1: This sequence is simplified and does not e.g. show session progress
messages and the ACK message from the UE in response to the reception of 200
OK.
NOTE 2: SIP messages between PSS adapter and SCF go through the IM CN
Subsystem even if not indicated on the sequences.
#### 8.2.3.2 Procedures at the UE
The UE shall generate an initial INVITE request according to TS 24.229 [7]
with the following additions:
\- The Request-URI is related to the PSS session that the user wants to
activate.
\- For an On Demand service, it shall be composed of a user part and a domain
part, as follows:
\- A user part containing the content identifier in a free string format.
\- Content identifier is constructed by \"PSS_COD_\\", wherein
content-id shall be globalContentID defined in [27].
\- A domain part containing the content provider domain name, obtained from
the SSF.
\- For Live content, it shall contain the PSI (Public Service Identity) of the
\"Live stream@\\", wherein the domain name is obtained from
SSF\".
\- The To header shall contain the same URI as in the Request-URI.
\- The Recv-Info header shall be empty [42].
The other headers shall be set according to TS 24.229 [7].
An SDP Offer shall be included in the initial INVITE request, in accordance
with media capabilities and policies available for the PSS session and with
the parameters received from the SSF during service selection procedure.
The SDP offer shall contain a media description for the RTSP content control
channel and one for the content delivery channel. The RTSP content control
media description shall be carried by TCP.
The SDP parameters for the RTSP content control channel shall be set as
follows:
\- a \'m\' line for an RTSP stream of format: m=\ \ \
\
\- The media field shall have a value of \"application\".
\- The port field shall be set to a value of 9, which is the discard port. See
RFC 4145 [13] and RFC 4572 [14].
\- The transport field shall be set to TCP or TCP/TLS. The former is used when
RTSP runs directly on top of TCP and the latter is used when RTSP runs on top
of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP.
\- The \ parameter shall be included and shall be set to _3gpp_rtsp._
NOTE: the _3gpp_rtsp_ application format should have a new MIME subtype
registered in IANA.
\- An \"a=setup\" attribute shall be present and set to \"active\" indicating
that the UE will initiate an outgoing TCP connection to the PSS Adapter [7]
and [13].
\- An \"a= connection\" attribute shall be present and set as \"new\" \"
indicating that the UE will establish a new outgoing TCP connection towards
the PSS Adapter [7] and [13].
\- A \"c\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN, the
address type set to IP4 or IP6 and IP address of the flow of the related RTSP
content control (ex. c=IN IP4 \).
\- For Live service, an \"a=PSS_Live_service: ServiceID\" line shall be
include to indicate the PSS live service which the UE intends to initiate. The
ServiceID shall be globalServiceID defined in [27] or serviceId defined in
[11], which is retrieved from service selection information.
Example of RTSP \'m\' line offer from the UE:
m=application 9 TCP 3gpp_rtsp
c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
a=setup:active
a=connection:new
For each media stream controlled by the RTSP content control channel, the SDP
offer shall include a \"receiver only\" content delivery channel media
description set as defined in 3GPP TS 26.234 [8], clause 5.3.3:
\- the \"m=\" line indicates the type of the media, the transport protocol and
the port of the related content delivery channel. It may also include a fmt
parameter which shall indicate the format given by the SSF or by executing the
procedure for providing missing parameters before session initiation described
in clauses 8.2.2, a subset of them or the format offered by the UE if none is
given by the SSF;
\- the \"c=\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN,
the address type set to IP4 or IP6 and unicast address of the flow of the
related content delivery channel;\ (ex. c=IN IP4 \)
\- optionally a \"b=\" line may contain the proposed bandwidth. If the user
has fetched the bandwidth required for this particular content delivery
channel during service selection retrieval, the bandwidth attribute at media
level shall be set to this value. Otherwise, this attribute shall be set to a
pre-configured value;\ (ex. b=AS:15000)
\- A \"a=\" line with a \"recvonly\".
The UE should receive a SIP 200 OK back containing the answer SDP.
#### 8.2.3.3 Procedures at the IM CN Subsystem
The IM CN Subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
#### 8.2.3.4 Procedures at the SCF
Upon receipt of SIP INVITE request, the SCF shall examine the Request-URI and
SDP parameters to determine that it is a PSS session initiation request for
Live Streaming or Content-On-Demand. According to the user subscription
information, the SCF shall check the service rights of the requested PSS
service.
If the Request-URI contains a content identifier in the user part and a domain
name in the domain part, the SCF determines that the PSS streaming session is
initiated for On Demand content. In this case, the SCF shall select a suitable
PSS adapter and forwards the SIP INVITE to the selected PSS adapter by
changing the Request-URI accordingly. The SCF shall not change the user part
of the To header in order to keep the content identifier in the INVITE
request.
When receiving a 301 or 302 response from the PSS adapter, the SCF shall not
forward this message to the UE. It may check if the PSS adapter indicated in
the Contact header belong to allowed destination. If allowed, the SCF shall
use one of the PSS adapter URI indicated in the Contact header of this
response and use it as a destination for the redirected INVITE.
If the request-URI contains the PSI \" Live Stream\", the SCF determines that
the PSS streaming session is initiated for Live content. In this case, the SCF
shall select a suitable PSS adapter and forwards the SIP INVITE to the
selected PSS adapter. The SCF shall include the list of authorized Live
content channels for the user in the SIP INVITE transmitted to the PSS adapter
by including the package identifiers containing to the list of authorized Live
content channels for the session and optionally transmitting the list of
authorized RTSP URIs.
The Recv-Info header shall indicate the supported Info Package (\"Content-
Reporting\") for reception and processing by the SCF [42]. The \"Content-
Reporting\" info package is defined in annex Q of [44].
Based on the Request-URI and SDP parameters, the SCF selects a suitable PSS
Adapter and forwards the SIP INVITE to the selected PSS Adapter.
Once receiving a SIP 200 OK response from PSS Adapter, the SCF shall check the
Recv-Info header and remove it from the response. Following that the SCF shall
forward the revised response to UE.
#### 8.2.3.5 Procedures at the PSS Adapter
The PSS Adapter shall be statefully aware of any sessions between the PSS
Adapter and a UE, and the PSS Adapter and the PSS Server related to the same
streaming session . This means that the RTSP session between the PSS Adapter
and the PSS Server and the SIP & RTSP sessions between the PSS Adapter and the
UE are associated at the PSS Adapter in order to keep session structure and
alignment. This includes, but is not limited to, RTSP parameters such as
sessionId, IP version, CSeq, etc.
The PSS Adapter shall support the following RTSP methods for PSS Server
session establishment and teardown control:
\- DESCRIBE (PSS Adapter to PSS Server).
\- SETUP (PSS Adapter to PSS Server).
\- TEARDOWN (PSS Adapter to PSS Server).
The PSS Adapter should support the \"3gpp-pipelined\" feature so as to be able
to pipeline SETUP messages.
Upon receipt of a SIP INVITE message, the PSS Adapter performs the following
actions:
\- It shall resolve the RTSP URI based on the R-URI, the SDP parameters and
the selected PSS Server.
\- It may send a DESCRIBE message to the PSS Server to fetch the SDP file.
\- It shall construct and send the RTSP SETUP message(s) to setup the relevant
media streams.
\- Return the answer SDP to the UE in the SIP 200 OK.
The PSS Adapter shall construct the RTSP SETUP message according to the SIP
Invite as follows:
\- The Request-Line shall be present of format: Request-Line = Method SP
Request-URI SP RTSP-Version CRLF:
\- Method field is set to SETUP;
\- RTSP-Version field to be set of RTSP/1.0.
\- The CSeq header field is set to a value allocated by PSS Adapter according
to RFC 2326 [25]
\- The transport header field:
\- the protocol and profile sub-fields together are set to a value of the
protocol sub-field of the corresponding \"m=\" line in the SDP offer,
\- the unicast \| multicast parameter is set to unicast.
\- The destination parameter is set to a value of the \"c=\" line of the
corresponding media delivery channel in the SDP offer,
\- The RTP port value of client_port parameter is set to the value of the port
sub-field of the corresponding \"m=\" line in the SDP offer, and the RTCP port
value of client_port parameter is set to a value of the RTP port value plus 1.
An example of the RTSP SETUP message is:
_PSS Adapter- >PSS Server: SETUP rtsp://media.example.com/movie001/audiotrack
RTSP/1.0_
> _CSeq: 1_
_Transport: RTP/AVP/UDP; unicast; destination=\ ;
client_port=3400-3401_
The PSS Adapter may send multiple RTSP SETUP messages if multiple media
delivery channels are carried within the SDP offer. In this case, the pipeline
of multiple RTSP SETUP messages may be supported.
When receiving a RTSP 200 OK response from the PSS Server, the PSS Adapter
parses the response, constructs a SIP 200 OK response with the final SDP, and
sends the SIP 200 OK response to the SCF. The final SDP shall describe the
RTSP session established by the PSS Adapter and the TCP connection to be
established by the UE.
The PSS Adapter shall construct the SIP 200 OK message according to RTSP 200
OK as follows:
\- The Recv-Info header shall be set to \"ContentReportConfig\" [42].
\- an \'m\' line for an RTSP stream of format: m=\ \ \
\
\- The media field shall have a value of \"application\".
\- The port field shall be set to the value allocated by PSS Adapter for the
UE to establish RTSP session, such as 554.
\- The transport field shall be set to TCP or TCP/TLS. The former is used when
RTSP runs directly on top of TCP and the latter is used when RTSP runs on top
of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP.
\- a \"c\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN, the
address type set to IP4 or IP6 and IP address of PSS Adapter for the flow of
the related RTSP content control (e.g. c=IN IP4 \).
\- The \"setup\" attribute is set to \'passive\' indicating that connection
shall be initiated by the other endpoint (UE).
\- An \"a= connection\" attribute shall be present and set as \"new\"
indicating that the UE will establish a new outgoing TCP connection towards
the PSS Adapter [7][13].
\- An \"a=control\" attribute shall be present in the format of an absolute
URI to be used for the UE in the subsequent RTSP requests.
\- One or more a=fmtp lines representing RTSP specific attributes set as
follows:
\- a \"fmtp:3gpp_rtsp h-session\" attribute representing the session
identifier for the RTSP session to be established with the UE.
The PSS Adapter may include \"fmtp: 3gpp_rtsp h-offset\" attribute that
indicates where the playback is to start from.
Example of RTSP \'m\' line answer from the PSS Adapter:
m=application 554 TCP 3gpp_rtsp
c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
a=setup:passive
a=connection:new
a=control:rtsp://example.com/channel/content1.sdp
a=fmtp 3gpp_rtsp h-session=12345
a=fmtp 3gpp_rtsp h-offset=30
For each media stream controlled by the RTSP content control channel, the SDP
answer shall include a content delivery channel media description set as
follows:
\- the \"m=\" line indicates the type of the media, the transport protocol and
the port of the related content delivery channel.
\- The port value shall be set to the RTP port value retrieved from the
server_port parameter in the RTSP 200 OK message.
\- If an fmt parameter is in the SDP offer it shall be completed with the
supported format by the PSS Server;
\- the \"c=\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN,
the address type set to IP4 or IP6 and the unicast address of the PSS Server
for the flow related to the content delivery channel,\ (ex. c=IN IP4
\);
\- the \"b=\" line shall contain the proposed bandwidth. Since the PSS media
stream is unidirectional the bandwidth shall be set to 0, except for the case
that the transport is RTP and RTCP is allowed.\ (ex. b=AS:0);
\- an \"a=\" line with a value of \"sendonly\". (ex. a=sendonly).
### 8.2.4 PSS Streaming Playback Control
#### 8.2.4.1 General Description
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="2.4097222222222223in"}
Figure 8: Initial Payback
#### 8.2.4.2 Procedures at the UE
The UE shall support the following RTSP methods for RTSP playback control:
\- PLAY (UE to PSS Adapter).
\- PAUSE (UE to PSS Adapter).
\- GET_PARAMETER (UE to PSS Adapter).
\- SET_PARAMETER (UE to PSS Adapter).
\- OPTIONS (UE to PSS Adapter).
When receiving any SIP response, the UE shall examine the media parameters in
the received SDP: the UE shall immediately setup the TCP connection carrying
RTSP. The UE shall fetch the RTSP session ID from the SDP answer contained in
the SIP response. This RTSP session ID shall be used for RTSP media control
messages.
After SIP session establishment, the UE can exchange RTSP messages to start to
receive media streams. The UE shall send an RTSP PLAY message to the PSS
adapter according to 3GPP TS 26.234 [8].
\- The RTSP URL shall be set to the value retrieved from the SDP \"a=control\"
attribute in the case of an absolute URI. If the value of \"a=control\" is a
relative URI that is in the form of a media path, then the RTSP absolute URL
is constructed by the UE using the SDP IP address (from c-line) and port (from

### 8.2.5 PSS content switching
#### 8.2.5.1 PSS Streaming session modification
##### 8.2.5.1.1 General description
NOTE 1: The specification assumes the UE will trigger a Re-INVITE procedure to
change the QoS to fit the new channel requirements. It will be considered
whether the network can trigger the QoS change without the UE taking
management.
This procedure presents the generic PSS streaming session modification
procedure. It can be referred in some cases for PSS Content Switching, when
there is a change of media components and/or bandwidth.

Figure 9: UE-initiated PSS session modification
NOTE 2: Like in other call-flows of the specification, the figure does not
show that messages exchanged between the PSS adapter and the SCF are routed
through the IM CN subsystem.
1) The UE sends the Re-INVITE request containing the SDP offer to the IM CN
Subsystem to establish the content delivery channel. The IM CN Subsystem may
require the PCRF to reserve additional resources for RTP streams according to
the SDP in the Re-INVITE. The IM CN subsystem may also issue the PCRF to
release resources for RTP streams.
2) The IM CN Subsystem forwards the Re-INVITE request to the SCF.
3) The SCF sends the Re-INVITE to the PSS adapter via the IM CN Subsystem.
4) The PSS adapter sends the according number of RTSP SETUP to the PSS server,
if additional media components are described in the SDP.
5) The PSS server responds with RTSP 200 OK to the PSS adapter (only, if the
PSS adapter has send SETUP messages to the PSS Server).
6) The PSS adapter sends one SIP 200 OK to the SCF with the SDP answer
containing the new media descriptions of RTP streams to be used.
7) The SCF sends the SIP 200 OK to the IM CN Subsystem. The IM CN subsystem
interacts with the PCRF to commit the reservation, and then forwards the SIP
200 OK to the UE.
8) The UE sends the SIP ACK to the IM CN subsystem, which forwards to the SCF.
The SCF forwards the SIP ACK to the PSS adapter.
##### 8.2.5.1.2 Procedures at the UE
To modify the session, the UE shall send a Re-INVITE or an UPDATE request as
specified in TS 24.229 [7] for an originating UE.
The UE shall not modify RTSP channel m-line description in the SDP if the
media delivery streams controlled by RTSP are not removed (port not set to 0
in the m lines) in the SDP.

the procedures defined in TS 24.229 [7] concerning the AS acting as a proxy or
a B2BUA.
When receiving an SDP offer, the SCF may modify the SDP offer in accordance to
the user subscription. If the SCF finds a media line not compatible with the
user\'s subscription, it shall set the port of this media line to 0. If none
of the media lines are acceptable, it shall reply with a 403 error response.
Then the SCF forwards the Re-INVITE message to the PSS adapter.
##### 8.2.5.1.5 Procedures at the PSS adapter
Upon receipt of a Re-INVITE request or an UPDATE request, the PSS adapter
shall modify the session as specified in TS 24.229 [7] if the request is
acceptable to the PSS adapter in accordance with the user subscription.
The PSS adapter sets up new media components, if the SDP file contains
additional components.
##### 8.2.5.1.6 Procedures at the PSS server
Upon receipt of an RTSP setup, the PSS server executes the requested method
and responds with an RTSP status code to the PSS adapter.
#### 8.2.5.2 PSS Content switching with available SDP, no change of media
component and bandwidth
##### 8.2.5.2.1 General description
The UE has retrieved the SDP prior to the content switching. The procedure is
as described as in 3GPP TS 26.234 [8], with the server role being played by
the PSS adapter.
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="4.401388888888889in"}
Figure 10: IMS PSS Content switching
1) The UE sends a PLAY request with the aggregated control URI of the new
content to the PSS adapter. The PSS client adds the media control URIs of the
new streams in the \"Switch-Stream\" header field to the RTSP PLAY method
request as defined 3GPP TS 26.234 [8] clause 5.5.4.3.
2) The PSS Adapter sends the RTSP PLAY message to the PSS Server.
3) The PSS Server responses a RTSP 200 OK message to the PSS Adapter.
4) The PSS Adapter sends the RTSP 200 OK message to UE.
5) The PSS server delivers the switched content streams to the UE.
6) The PSS Adapter should send a SIP INFO message including the Info Package
(Content Reporting) to the SCF with content switching information. See clause
8.2.5.2.5.
The SCF may utilize the content switching information for statistic, charging
etc. purpose, and may initiate a SIP Re-INVITE request to the UE to adjust the
QoS reservation if the transport resources changed before and after switching.

#### 8.2.5.3 PSS Content switching with available SDP, change of media
components or QoS
##### 8.2.5.3.1 General Description
Fast Content Switching as defined in 26.234 [8] Clause 5.5.4 allows also
changing content when the new content channel requires a different number or
characteristics of media components as the old content channel, or when the
bandwidth needs to be modified.
For instance, the old content stream consists out of an audio and a video
stream and the new content channel offers an audio, video and 3GPP Timed Text
media component. Addition a media component to an ongoing stream is defined in
26.234 [8] clause 5.5.4.6 and removing a media component in 26.234 [8] clause

from in response to the reception of 200 OK.
NOTE 2: The number of required RTSP SETUP interactions between the PSS Adapter
and the PSS Server depend on the number of new media components in the SDP.
The UE determines that the new SDP file contains a different number of media
components as the old SDP. The UE updates the streaming session by sending a
Re-INVITE with the new SDP file, as described in clause 8.2.3.2. The Re-INVITE
is sent either before, during or after the RTSP PLAY switch. As soon as the UE
receives the 200 OK for the Re-INVITE, the UE initiates a PLAY to get the new
synchronization information.

Streaming User Service the user has chosen.
Step 3, 4: SCF responds UE with a SIP 200 OK message when the SIP INVITE is
successfully handled. The SIP 200 OK contains an SDP files containing the
Multicast address of the service. The UE then activates the MBMS bearers
either using the MBMS Broadcast Service Activation procedure [4] or the MBMS
Multicast Service Activation Procedure [4].
Step 5: The UE can start receiving the MBMS Streaming session data when
transmitted by the BM-SC.UPF.

The UE shall generate an initial INVITE request:
\- The Request-URI in the INVITE request shall be the well known PSI (Public
Service Identifier) of the MBMS Service, i.e. Live Stream@\.
\- The To header shall contain the same URI as in the Request-URI.
\- The From header shall indicate the public user identity of the user.
\- The Recv-Info header shall be set to \"ContentReportConfig\" [42].
An SDP offer shall be included in the request. The SDP offer shall be done in
accordance with the parameters received during UE service selection procedure
and with media capabilities and required bandwidth available for the MBMS
session. The SDP offer corresponds to the MBMS Streaming Session. See 3GPP TS
26.346 [11], clause 8.3.1. . The SDP offer at media level shall include the
following elements:
\- The m-line(s) shall be set to the media parameters retrieved via service
selection procedures for the requested MBMS service.
\- The c-line(s) shall be set according to the multicast address retrieved via
service selection procedures for the requested MBMS service.
\- An a=mbms_service:MBMS_ServiceId line to indicate the MBMS service which
the UE intends to initiate first. The MBMS_ServiceId shall be globalServiceID
defined in [27] or serviceId defined in [11], which is retrieved from service
selection information.
\- The a-attribute shall be set to the value of \"recvonly\".
Once the UE receives the SIP response, the UE shall examine the media
parameters in the received SDP, and initiate the MBMS channel according to the
a=mbms_service line. It can activate the corresponding MBMS User Service as
described in the USDs. MBMS User Service reception initiation may correspond
to the MBMS Broadcast Mode activations as described in 3GPP TS 23.246 [4],
clause 8.12 or the MBMS Multicast Mode activation procedure as described in
3GPP TS 23.246 [4], clause 8.2.
The received SDP may contain an a=suggestedPresentationOffset:value line. The
value of suggestedPresentationOffset specifies a delay offset from the time
when the first octet of a data unit was generated at the sender that is
suggested to be used for presentation of the first octet of the data unit. For
a received RTP packet, if the wall-clock time corresponding to the RTP
timestamp carried in the RTP packet is _T_ , a UE may present the data
contained in the first octet of the associated RTP packet to the user at _T+
suggestedPresentationOffset_ in terms of the wall-clock time if synchronized
playout with other UEs adhering to the same rule is desired.
#### 8.3.3.3 Procedures at the IM CN Subsystem
The IM CN subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
The corresponding PCC procedures are performed as described in clause 9.
#### 8.3.3.4 Procedures at the SCF
The SCF shall support the procedures specified in TS 24.229 [7] applicable to
an AS acting as a terminating UA.
Upon receipt of SIP INVITE request, the SCF shall perform service
authorization procedures to check the service rights of requested MBMS service
according to the user subscription information, See clause 10.4.
The SCF shall examine the SDP parameters in the SDP offer.
\- It shall examine the a=mbms_service parameter. This parameter contains the
channel the UE intends to join. If the mbms_service parameter does not point
to a channel that the UE is allowed to join the SCF shall not accept the offer
and shall answer with a 403 error code.
\- It shall examine the c-line(s) to determine that it is a multicast session.
It may also check that it corresponds to the mbms_service parameter. If not,
the SCF shall answer with a 403 error code.
If the SDP parameters are examined successfully, the SCF shall answer with a
SIP 200 OK, indicating the SDP answer as follows:
\- the c-lines and m-lines shall be identical to ones indicated in the SDP
offer.
\- it shall include an a=sendonly attribute.
\- It may include an a= suggestedPresentationOffset:value line. The value of
suggestedPresentationOffset provides a mapping of the presentation time of
each data unit to the wall-clock time to enable synchronized playout of the
UEs adhering to the same rule.
The SIP 200 OK shall indicate the supported Info Packages in the Recv-Info
header (Content Reporting) [42].
#### 8.3.3.5 Procedures at the BMSC.UPF
The MBMS session is already ongoing at the BMSC.UPF. No specific action is
required.
### 8.3.4 MBMS content switching
#### 8.3.4.1 General Description
It is assumed that MBMS streaming reception is already active and a stream is
delivered to the UE via MBMS. In case of MBMS content switching, the UE tunes
into a new content channel e.g. in case of MBMS multicast mode the UE leaves a
multicast channel and joins another one.
The UE should sent a SIP INFO Message with the included Info Package (Content
Reporting) to inform the SCF about which channel is being received unless the
SCF prohibits it. A timer is started with a preconfigured value with default
value of 10 seconds, when the channel switch is executed. After timer
expiration the SIP INFO message is sent.
{width="5.729166666666667in" height="2.40625in"}
Figure 16: MBMS content switching reporting
The UE sends content switching information to the SCF.
The content switching information may include the serviceId after switching.
The SCF may utilize the content switching information for statistical or
charging purposes etc.
If the SCF does not want to receive content switching information anymore or
would like to start content switching reporting, the SCF should send a SIP
UPDATE message to the UE with the Recv-Info header set appropriately.
{width="5.729166666666667in" height="2.40625in"}
Figure 16a: MBMS content switching reporting update
#### 8.3.4.2 Procedures at the UE
The UE performs MBMS content switching according to the
deactivation/activation procedures defined in [4].
Upon identification of a successful content switch, the UE starts the content
switching timer for a particular session. If another content switch occurs
during the life of the timer, the timer is restarted. If the session is
terminated during the life of the timer, the timer is stopped. After timer
expiration, the UE should send a SIP INFO message with the Info Package
(Content Reporting) to the SCF. The Content Reporting Info Package shall
contain an XML document as defined in Annex D and Annex F.
\- ImsPssMbmsCommand shall be set to \"MbmsSwitch\";
\- ServiceId shall be set to the value of the new channel. If the OMA BCAST
Service Guide [27] is used, this shall be set to Global Service ID, otherwise
shall be set to the MBMS User Service Description serviceId.
\- ProgrammeId may be present and if present shall be set to the identifier of
the current programme of the new channel. If the OMA BCAST Service Guide [27]
is used, this shall be set to service Name.
\- DateTime shall be set to the date & time of the channel switch.
The Content-Type header shall be set to \"application/3gpp-ims-pss-mbms-
command +xml\".
After receiving a SIP UPDATE message from the SCF, the UE shall dependent on
the Recv-Info header, stop or start the content switching reporting.
#### 8.3.4.3 Procedures at the IM CN Subsystem
The IM CN subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
#### 8.3.4.4 Procedures at the SCF
Upon receipt of a SIP INFO message the SCF shall send a SIP 200 OK to the UE.
If the SCF does not want to receive content switching information anymore, it
should send a SIP UPDATE message with the Recv-Info header set to nil.
If the SCF decides to start content switching reports, the SCF should send a
SIP UPDATE message with the Recv-Info header set to Content Reporting to the
UE.
#### 8.3.4.5 Procedures at the BMSC.UPF
The BMSC.UPF transmits the RTP flows, and is not involved in the reporting of
content switching information.

The BMSC.UPF is acting as described in 3GPP TS 23.246 [4].
### 8.3.6 MBMS Content Report Configuration
#### 8.3.6.1 General Description
During service consumption with MBMS session, the SCF may request the UE to
re-config the content report behaviours e.g. report timer, etc. The following
clauses describe how the SCF can reconfigure a UE.
According to sub-clause 8.3.3, a MBMS streaming session was initiated and the
UE has indicated his willing to accept Content Reporting Configuration Info-
Package.
In order to send the updated content report configuration information, the SCF
issues a SIP INFO request to the UE, with the new configuration information.
After receiving SIP INFO request, the UE responses with SIP 200 OK and config
itself with the new configuration information.
Figure 17a: Content Report Configuration Information Delivery to UE
#### 8.3.6.2 Procedures in SCF
Whenever the SCF wants to re-configure an UE, the SCF shall issue a SIP INFO
request to the UE with the Info Package (Content Report Configuration). The
Content Reporting Configuration Package shall contain an XML document as
defined in Annex K.
\- ReportTimer shall be set to the time value (in seconds) of the updated
report timer;

The UE shall then parse the XML file in the message body, according the schema
defined in Annex X. Following that the UE shall configure itself according to
the XML file:
\- If the \"ReportTimer\" is different from the timer which is set for content
report, then reset the timer with the value \"ReportTimer\".
## 8.4 Combined PSS and MBMS Streaming
### 8.4.1 Introduction
Combined PSS and MBMS streaming is important to ensure a consistent user
experience. An UE may switch between one and the other depending on certain
circumstances, e.g. changing between a PSS and MBMS coverage etc., or
triggered by specific user action, e.g. trick play, etc.
It is assumed that the UE has an already established PSS or MBMS session and
is capable of switching to the other delivery method.
Clause 8.4.2 gives the different cases and scenarios for switching between PSS
and MBMS .
### 8.4.2 PSS - MBMS Switching
In the case of hybrid PSS-MBMS switching, it is distinguished between:
(a) switching from MBMS streaming to PSS streaming:
â€¢ Without channel change e.g. when a user is viewing an MBMS user service and
moves out of MBMS coverage, or the user initiates trick play mode action, etc.
â€¢ With channel change e.g. changing to a channel only available on PSS.
(b) switching from PSS streaming to MBMS streaming:
â€¢ Without channel change e.g. the user returns back from trick play mode to a
normal MBMS user service, etc.
â€¢ With channel change e.g. changing to a channel available on MBMS.
### 8.4.3 Switching from MBMS streaming to PSS streaming
According to clause 8.3.3 an MBMS streaming session was initiated and the UE
is receiving the MBMS session from the BM-SC.UPF.
In order to switch from MBMS to unicast reception of a stream via PSS e.g. for
allowing trick play mode, a SIP Re-INVITE is issued by the UE. An SDP offer
and Request-URI shall be included according to clause 8.2.3.
After receiving the 200 OK, the UE leaves the multicast channel and starts
playback.
Figure 18: IMS Hybrid PSS-MBMS-to-PSS content switching
#### 8.4.3.1 Combined Session establishment
##### 8.4.3.1.1 Procedures at the UE
When the UE switches from an MBMS User Service to a PSS user service, the UE
sends a session modification request, i.e. SIP re-INVITE, with an SDP Offer
and Request-URI.
The Request-URI is related to the PSS session that the user wishes to
activate. The Request-URI shall be composed of a user and domain part as
defined in clause 8.2.3.2.
The SDP offer shall include previously negotiated media descriptions with the
port set to zero and two or more additional media descriptions: one for media
control channel (i.e. RTSP control channel) and one or more for media delivery
channel (i.e. delivery channel for the unicast streams).
The RTSP control media descriptor shall follow TS 24.229 [7]. The SDP offer
for media delivery shall be identical to the previous SDP offer done for
broadcast in term of codecs and transport protocol.
The UE may record the media offset for the MBMS user service.
When receiving SIP 200 OK response, the UE shall setup a media control channel
with the PSS Adapter, and setup a media delivery channel with PSS Server
according to the SDP answer. The UE shall send RTSP PLAY message to start the
delivery of the media streams.
##### 8.4.3.1.2 Procedures at the IM CN Subsystem
The IM CN Subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
##### 8.4.3.1.3 Procedures at the SCF
When receiving the SIP modification request, the SCF will determine if the
programme currently broadcasted has MBMS to PSS switching support.
NOTE: The SCF may determine whether the SIP modification request is for MBMS
to PSS switching according to the addition of the RTSP media control channel
or unicast media delivery channel in the SDP offer.
If MBMS to PSS switching is not available for the UE, the session modification
is rejected and the old MBMS session (along with the previous reserved
resources) is maintained.
If MBMS to PSS switching is available for the UE, the SCF acting as a B2BUA,
shall:
\- Handle the SIP modification request as defined in clause 8.2.3.4;
\- If the Request-URI contains a content identifier in the user part and a
domain name in the domain part, the SCF shall select a suitable PSS adapter
and generate a SIP INVITE request to the selected PSS adapter. The To header
of the SIP INVITE request shall contain the same content identifier as in the
Request-URI of the SIP modification request received from the UE;
\- Send the SIP INVITE request to the PSS Adapter with the SDP parameters for
the content control channel of RTSP, and for the media delivery channel of
unicast streams. The SCF shall precise the content identifier in the user part
of the Request-URI.
When sending the SIP INVITE message to PSS Adapter, SCF shall follow the
procedures defined in TS 24.229 [7] concerning the AS acting as B2BUA.
##### 8.4.3.1.4 Procedures at the PSS Adapter
When receiving a SIP INVITE request from SCF, as well as receiving RTSP 200 OK
message from PSS Server, the PSS Adapter shall conform to clause 8.2.3.5.
Prior to replying, the PSS Adapter uses real time to calculate the media
offset for the MBMS user service when replying with the offered media.
When receiving RTSP message from UE, the PSS Adapter shall conform to clause
8.2.4.2.
##### 8.4.3.1.5 Procedures at the PSS Server
The procedures at the PSS Server shall conform to those defined in 3GPP TS
26.234 [8].
#### 8.4.3.2 Combined session teardown
The combined session teardown shall conform to clause 8.2.6.
### 8.4.4 Switching from PSS streaming to MBMS streaming
According to clause 8.2.2 a PSS streaming session was initiated and the UE is
receiving the PSS session from the PSS server.
In order to switch from PSS to MBMS reception of a stream, a SIP Re-INVITE is
issued by the UE and sent to the SCF. The SCF shall act as a B2BUA, and send a
SIP BYE messge to PSS Adapter to terminate the SIP session between them. The
PSS Adapter shall send a RTSP TEARDOWN messag to PSS Server to release the
RTSP session.
Once the UE receives the SIP 200 OK response, it can activate the
corresponding MBMS User Service as described in the SDP as defined in clause
8.3.3.2.
After switching to MBMS reception, the PSS session shall be terminated.
Figure 19: IMS PSS-to-MBMS content switching
#### 8.4.4.1 Combined Session establishment
##### 8.4.4.1.1 Procedures at the UE
When the UE switches from a PSS User Service to an MBMS user service, the UE
sends a session modification request, i.e. SIP re-INVITE, an SDP offer shall
be included according to clause 8.3.3. The SDP offer for media delivery shall
be identical to the previous SDP offer done for PSS in term of codecs and
transport protocol.
Once the UE receives the SIP 200 OK response, it can activate the
corresponding MBMS User Service as described in the SDP as defined in clause
8.3.3.2. MBMS User Service reception initiation may correspond to the MBMS
Broadcast Mode activation procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.246 [4], clause
8.12 or the MBMS Multicast Mode activation procedure as described in 3GPP TS
23.246 [4], clause 8.2.
##### 8.4.4.1.2 Procedures at the IM CN Subsystem
The IM CN Subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
##### 8.4.4.1.3 Procedures at the SCF
When receiving the SIP modification request, the SCF will determine if the
content currently delivered has PSS to MBMS switching support.
If PSS to MBMS switching is not available for the UE, the session modification
is rejected and the old PSS session (along with the previous reserved
resources) is maintained.
If PSS to MBMS switching is available for the UE, the SCF shall act as a
B2BUA, and send a SIP BYE message to the PSS Adapter to terminate the SIP
session between them. When sending the SIP BYE message to PSS Adapter, SCF
shall follow the procedures defined in TS 24.229 [7] concerning the AS acting
as B2BUA.
Once receiving a SIP 200 OK message from PSS Adapter, SCF sends a SIP 200 OK
message to UE with a SDP answer as defined in clause 8.3.3.4.
##### 8.4.4.1.4 Procedures at the PSS Adapter
When receiving a SIP BYE message from SCF, as well as receiving RTSP 200 OK
message from PSS Server, the PSS Adapter shall conform to clause 8.2.6.5.
##### 8.4.4.1.5 Procedures at the PSS Server
The procedures at the PSS Server shall conform to those defined in 3GPP TS
26.234 [8].
#### 8.4.4.2 Combined session teardown
The combined session teardown shall conform to clause 8.3.5.
# 9 Policy and charging control
## 9.1 General
For the purpose of the present specification, the policy and charging control
(PCC) is according to 3GPP TS 23.203 [12]. This clause is relevant when PCC is
present. However, IMS based PSS and MBMS User Services can be realized without
PCC. When PCC is not present, the UE is responsible for allocation of the
resources based on Session Description information.
Service subscription control is performed by the SCF at registration and at
PSS and MBMS session initiation.
QoS control is different for PSS and MBMS User Services.
## 9.2 QoS control
The P-CSCF is used as the Application Function in the PCC architecture. The
PCRF decides how policy control of the QoS is performed for IMS initiated and
controlled PSS and MBMS User Service.
In case of PSS, the PCRF shall use the SDP received from the P-CSCF during
session establishment to calculate the proper QoS authorization. The way the
QoS is enforced in this architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [12].
In case of MBMS, the PCRF shall not initiate the establishment of a specific
bearer.
Figure 20: PSS QoS Policy Control
NOTE: The sequence shown is simplified and does not e.g. show session progress
messages and the ACK message from the UE in response to the reception of 200
OK.
The PSS case of QoS control is shown on figure 20. The appropriate existing
bearers are used or new required bearers are allocated. Network initiated
bearer control and UE initiated bearer control are possible. When receiving
the final SDP, the UE shall initiate the establishment of the required bearers
unless a network initiated bearer allocation procedure is already ongoing, or
the UE has been configured to use network initiated resource control.
# 10 Security Procedures
## 10.1 General
Different security procedures apply for IMS, MBMS and PSS.
IMS level authentication and access security is performed during IMS
registration in accordance to [7].
PSS-Only: PSS defines an optional confidentiality protection of individual RTP
payloads used in a streaming session. If PSS confidentiality protection as
defined in 3GPP TS 26.234 [8], Annex K. is used, then the terminal initiates
the GAA/GBA Bootstrapping procedure 3GPP TS 33.220 [26] after a successful IMS
registration and Service discovery.
MBMS-only and combined PSS/MBMS service offerings: MBMS security is based on
GAA/GBA [26]. The GAA/GBA Bootstrapping procedure is initiated by the UE after
a successful IMS registration and Service discovery. It is necessary before
any service description retrieval and session initiation.
GBA (see 3GPP TS 33.220 [26]) is used to generate a master key Ks from which
NAF specific keys (e.g. Ks_NAF for ME based key management) can be derived
when needed. It is also used to authenticate the user for signaling that is
not performed via the IMS core network (e.g. HTTP based service description
retrieval).
GBA is also used to generate and provision the NAF keys (e.g. Ks_NAF for ME
based key management) - which is the Long Term Key that is used in content
encryption/decryption procedures -- and the B-TID -- which is the
corresponding bootstrapping transaction identifier.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="2.8222222222222224in"}
Figure 21: GBA/GAA Bootstrapping procedure
Figure 21 illustrates the GBA/GAA bootstrapping procedure. The following steps
are performed. See [26] for details:
\- The UE sends a request to the BSF with its IMPI as User ID. The UE
discovers the address of the BSF as specified in [26].
\- The BSF then acquires one Authentication Vector from the HSS and may
acquire the User\'s GUSS (GBA User Security Settings) and forwards the RAND
and AUTN to the UE in the HTTP 401 message.
\- The UE checks AUTN to verify that the challenge is from an authorised
network.
\- The UE sends another HTTP request, containing the Digest AKA response
(calculated using RES), to the BSF.
\- The BSF authenticates the UE by verifying the Digest AKA response. The BSF
shall send a 200 OK message, including a B-TID, to the UE to indicate the
success of the authentication.
> If UICC based MBMS key management is required, then USIM shall be used.
> Otherwise either USIM or ISIM may be used.
NOTE: The reason for this is that UICC based MBMS key management is currently
specified only for USIM.
## 10.2 Secure Service Description Retrieval
The Service Description retrieval procedure allows the UE to acquire the
necessary information to select and initiate PSS and/or MBMS sessions using
IMS procedures. See clause 7 for more details on this procedure.
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="3.1458333333333335in"}
Figure 22: Service Description retrieval with authentication
Figure 22 describes the Service Description retrieval procedure with
authentication.
The UE requesting a service description towards the SSF (acting as a GBA
Network Application Function (NAF)) shall include the B-TID corresponding to
the Ks established during the bootstrapping procedure. When the SSF receives
the service description request, it shall trigger an authentication request
towards the BSF to acquire the NAF keys ( e.g. Ks_NAF for ME based key
management) of the user if the SSF does not already have the NAF keys
available. The SSF shall trigger HTTP digest authentication procedure towards
the UE in accordance with 3GPP TS 33.222 [20].
The SSF shall use TLS to encrypt the Service Description during retrieval.
## 10.3 PSS Authentication and Content encryption
Void (TBD).
## 10.4 MBMS Security procedures
The IMS based MBMS user service security procedures shall fulfil the key
management procedures defined in TS 33.246 [5], including MSKprocedures in
clause 6.3.2 of TS 33.246 [5], and MTK procedures in clause 6.3.3 of TS 33.246
[5]. The MSK procedure further includes MBMS user service registration
procedure, deregistration procedure, MSK request procedure and MSK delivery
procedure.
Clause 10.4.1 describes MBMS security procedures where HTTP is used as
described in TS 33.246 [5], and BMSC.UPF acts as NAF to interact with BSF and
derives security keys.
Clause 10.4.2 describes MBMS security procedures where SIP is used and SCF act
as a NAF to interact with BSF and derives security keys.
The procedures according to clause 10.4.1 and clause 10.4.2, respectively, are
alternatives for MBMS security procedures. They are equal in terms of security
provision. The UE shall support both alternatives for MBMS security
procedures. The UE is informed about the supported MBMS security procedure by
retrieval of the service attachment information from the SDF as defined in
Annex H.
### 10.4.1 HTTP based MBMS security procedure
Clause 10.4.1 describes MSK procedures, and clause 10.4.2 describes MTK
procedures.
#### 10.4.1.1 MSK procedures
The IMS based MBMS user service registration procedure, deregistation
procedure, MSK request procedure and MSK delivery procedure are defined in
clause 10.4.1 to 10.4.4 respectively.

### 10.4.2 SIP based MBMS security procedures
#### 10.4.2.0 General
Clause 10.4.2 describes an alternative to clause 10.4.1 for MBMS security
procedures, where the NAF for the MBMS User Services is implemented in the SCF
and interacts with the BSF. The procedures apply for both ME and UICC based
key management.
The MBMS Security specification 3GPP TS 33.246 [5] defines a set of security
procedures. The following list describes how these procedures are applied in
the context of IMS based MBMS user services when using SIP based MBMS security
procedures.
\- \"MBMS User Service Registration procedure\".
\- In the context of SIP based MBMS security procedure, this procedure is
applied as specified in clause 10.4.2.1 in the present document.
\- \"MBMS User Service Deregistration procedure\".
\- In the context of SIP based MBMS security procedure, this procedure is
applied as specified in clause 10.4.2.1A in the present document.
\- \"Basic MSK request procedure\".
\- In the context of SIP based MBMS security procedure, this procedure is
applied as specified in clause 10.4.2.2 in the present document.
\- \"Missed key update procedure\".
\- This procedure is equivalent to Basic MSK request procedure.
\- \"BM-SC solicited pull procedure\".
\- In the context of SIP based MBMS security procedure, this procedure is
applied as specified in clause 10.4.2.4 in the present document.
\- \"MSK delivery procedure\"
\- In the context of SIP based MBMS security procedure, this procedure is
applied as defined TS 33.246 [5] with exception that SCF FQDN is sent instead
of BM-SC FQDN.
\- \"MTK update procedure\"
\- In the context of SIP based MBMS user services this procedure is applied as
defined TS 33.246 [5].
#### 10.4.2.1 SIP based MBMS User Service Registration
This procedure is used to register a UE with one or more MBMS User Services.
It is assumed that the UE has received the service description (cf. clause
10.2). The service description includes, e.g. the service protection
description. The service protection description is similar as defined in 3GPP
TS 33.246 [5] with the following exception: the FQDN of the BM-SC is not
included in the service protection description. Instead, the service
protection description for the service shall include an FQDN belonging to the
SCF as the SCF acts as a NAF.
NOTE 1: This is to ensure consistent NAF key derivation in the UE and in the
BSF as the SCF acts as a NAF and as the FQDN of the NAF is used as input in
NAF key derivation.
In case more than one BM-SCs are connected to the SCF, the SCF shall locally
associate a different one of its FQDNs to each connected BM-SC. As there is
one NAF FQDN indicated in the service protection description for each service,
the SCF (NAF) will know from the userServiceId indicated by the UE which NAF
FQDN to be used for NAF key derivation.
NOTE 2: This will ensure that each connected BM-SC will get different NAF key,
and consequently will get different MUK. GBA TS 33.220 [26] allows the NAF to
be known in DNS under several FQDNs if it is ensured that the correct NAF FQDN
is used in NAF key derivation.
It is also assumed that the UE has been registered and authenticated to IMS
and the SIP procedures are protected according to 3GPP TS 33.203 [31], and
that the UE has run GBA bootstrapping with the BSF as defined in 3GPP TS
33.220 [26]. It is also assumed that the network interfaces are protected with
Network Domain Security (NDS/IP) as defined in 3GPP TS 33.210 [32].

Figure 24: SIP based MBMS User Service Registration
The procedure is as follows (cf. figure 24 which is simplified as it does not
show all parameters):
\- The UE sends a SIP INVITE to the SCF via the IM CN subsystem. The INVITE
indicates SCF in the Request-URI and the message includes the identities of
the requested MBMS user services (userServiceIds) for which the UE wants to
register and the bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) in the body of
the SIP INVITE. The XML schema for the list of MBMS user service IDs is
defined in TS 26.346 [11] and the XML schema for the B-TID is defined in annex
I.1.
\- The SCF receives the IP address of the UE and the asserted identitie(s) of
the UE from the headers of the SIP INVITE message. The SCF performs a check
based on stored subscription information whether the UE is authorized to
access the requested MBMS user services. If yes, the procedure continues. If
not, the procedure is terminated.
\- If there is no B-TID stored for the UE or if the received B-TID is
different than the one stored for the UE, the SCF runs GBA usage procedure
with the BSF over Zn to fetch the NAF keys corresponding to the UE as defined
in 3GPP TS 33.220 [26]. The NAF-Id which the SCF uses over Zn is constructed
from the NAF FQDN indicated in the service protection description for this
service and Ua security protocol identifier specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [26].
As there is one NAF FQDN indicated in the service protection description for
each service, the SCF will know from the userServiceId indicated by the UE
which FQDN to be used as NAF FQDN. Upon receiving the NAF keys from the BSF,
the SCF derives MBMS User Key (MUK) as defined in TS 33.246 [5].\ If the
received B-TID is not valid or if the SCF desires the UE to make a new GBA
bootstrapping, the SCF shall response to the UE with an appropriate error
message. The error message will trigger the UE to run new GBA bootstrapping.
\- The SCF sends a HTTP POST message to the BM-SC. The SCF populates the HTTP
POST as follows:
\- the HTTP version shall be 1.1 which is specified in RFC 2616 [34];
\- the base of the Request-URI shall contain the full BM-SC key management URI
(e.g. http://bmsc.home1.net:1234);
\- the Request-URI shall contain an URI parameter \"requesttype\" that shall
be set to \"sip-based-register\", i.e. Request-URI takes the form of
\"/keymanagement?requesttype= sip-based-register \";
\- the SCF may add additional URI parameters to the Request-URI;
\- X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity header which includes the identitie(s) of the UE;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be the MIME type of the payloads;
\- the HTTP payload shall contain an XML document including a list of one or
more userServiceIds of MBMS User Services to which the UE wants to register,
IP address of the UE, MBMS user key (MUK), lifetime of MUK, NAF FQDN and
B-TID. NAF FQDN and B-TID are included as they are further included in the
MIKEY MSK messages from the BM-SC to the UE to identify the used MUK (i.e. NAF
key). The XML schema for the list of MBMS user service IDs is defined in TS
26.346 [11] and the XML schema for carrying IP address, MUK, MUK lifetime, NAF
FQDN and BTID is defined in annex x.2.
\- the SCF may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP POST request.
\- Upon receiving the HTTP POST message, the BM-SC checks that the HTTP POST
is valid, and extracts the request for further processing. As the HTTP POST
message came from SCF with asserted identitie(s), the BM-SC does not need to
authenticate the UE as the UE has been authenticated by the IMS. Also, the
HTTP POST message also implicitly indicates to the BM-SC that the SCF has
authorized the UE to register to the indicated MBMS User Service(s).\ \ The
BM-SC stores the received information and returns HTTP 200 OK to the SCF. The
BM-SC shall populate HTTP response as follows:
\- the HTTP status code in the HTTP status line shall be 200;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be the MIME type of the payload, i.e.
\"application/mbms-register-response+xml \";
\- the HTTP payload shall contain an XML document including a list including
one status code for each MBMS User Service. The XML schema of the payload is
the same that is used for MBMS Registration in 3GPP TS 33.246 [5] and it is
specified in 3GPP TS 26.346 [11].
\- Upon receiving the HTTP 200 OK., the SCF then includes the XML body from
the HTTP 200 OK message into a SIP 200 OK message and sends the SIP 200 OK
message to the UE via the IM CN subsystem.
\- Upon receiving the 200 OK the UE derives NAF keys corresponding to the NAF-
Id. The NAF-Id is constructed from the NAF FQDN indicated in the service
description and Ua security protocol identifier specified in 3GPP TS 33.220
[26]. The UE derives MBMS User Key (MUK) from the NAF key as defined in 3GPP
TS 33.246 [5].
BM-SC can now start sending MIKEY MSK messages (protected with MUK) to the UE
as defined in 3GPP TS 33.246 [5]. In MIKEY MSK messages the BM-SC shall
include the NAF FQDN and B-TID received from the SCF as they are used toÂ­
identify the used MUK (i.e. NAF keys).
#### 10.4.2.1a SIP based MBMS User Service De-registration
This procedure is used to de-register a UE from one or more MBMS User
Services.
The same assumptions apply as in SIP based MBMS User Service Registration in
clause 10.4.2.1.
{width="5.997222222222222in" height="3.816666666666667in"}
Figure 24a: SIP based MBMS User Service De-registration
The procedure is as follows (cf. figure 24a which is simplified as it does not
show all parameters):
\- UE sends a SIP re-INVITE to the SCF via the IM CN subsystem. The re-INVITE
indicates SCF in the Request-URI and the message includes the identities of
the requested MBMS user services (userServiceIds) from which the UE wants to
de-register and the bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) in the body
of the SIP INVITE.. The XML schema for the list of MBMS user service IDs is
defined in TS 26.346 [11] and the XML schema for the B-TID is defined in annex
x.1.
\- The SCF receives the asserted identitie(s) of the UE from the headers of
the SIP re-INVITE message.
\- If there is no B-TID stored for the UE or if the received B-TID is
different than the one stored for the UE, the SCF runs GBA usage procedure
with the BSF over Zn to fetch the NAF keys corresponding to the UE as defined
in 3GPP TS 33.220 [26]. The NAF-Id which the SCF uses over Zn constructed from
the NAF FQDN indicated in the service protection description for this service
and Ua security protocol identifier specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [26]. Upon
receiving the NAF key from the BSF, the SCF derives MBMS User Key (MUK) as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.246 [5].\ If the received B-TID is not valid or if the
SCF desires the UE to make a new GBA bootstrapping, the SCF shall response to
the UE with an appropriate error message. The error message will trigger the
UE to run new GBA bootstrapping.
\- The SCF sends a HTTP POST message to the BM-SC. The SCF populates the HTTP
POST as follows:
\- the HTTP version shall be 1.1 which is specified in RFC 2616 [34];
\- the base of the Request-URI shall contain the full BM-SC key management URI
(e.g. http://bmsc.home1.net:1234);
\- the Request-URI shall contain an URI parameter \"requesttype\" that shall
be set to \"sip-based-deregister\", i.e. Request-URI takes the form of
\"keymanagement?requesttype= sip-based-deregister\";
\- the SCF may add additional URI parameters to the Request-URI;
\- X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity header which includes the identities of the UE;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be the MIME type of the payloads;
\- the HTTP payload shall contain the request an XML document including a list
of one or more userServiceIds of MBMS User Services from which the UE wants to
deregister. If new NAF keys were created in the previous step, then the SCF
shall also include MBMS user key (MUK), lifetime of MUK, NAF FQDN and B-TID.
E.g. the BM-SC may send an MSK message to invalidate the MSKs in the UE as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.246 [5]. The XML schema for the list of MBMS user
service IDs is defined in 3GPP TS 26.346 [11] and the XML schema for carrying
MUK, MUK lifetime, NAF FQDN and BTID is defined in annex x.2;
\- the SCF may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP POST request.
\- The BM-SC receives the HTTP POST message. The BM-SC checks that the HTTP
POST is valid, and extracts the request for further processing. As the HTTP
POST message came from SCF with asserted identities, the BM-SC does not need
to authenticate the UE as the UE has been authenticated by the IMS.\ \ The BM-
SC returns HTTP 200 OK to the SCF. The BM-SC shall populate HTTP response as
follows:
\- the HTTP status code in the HTTP status line shall be 200;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be the MIME type of the payload, i.e.
\"application/mbms-register-response+xml\". XML document is the same that is
used for MBMS De-registration in 3GPP TS 33.246 [5] and it is specified in
3GPP TS 26.346 [11];
\- the HTTP payload shall contain a list including one status code for each
MBMS User Service.
\- Upon receiving the HTTP 200 OK, the SCF then includes the XML body from the
HTTP 200 OK message into a SIP 200 OK message and sends the SIP 200 OK message
to the UE via the IM CN subsystem.
#### 10.4.2.2 SIP based Basic MSK Request
This procedure is used to by the UE to request one or more MSKs.
{width="5.997222222222222in" height="3.816666666666667in"}
Figure 25: SIP based MBMS MSK request
The same assumptions apply as in IMS based MBMS User Service Registration in
clause 10.4.2.1.
The procedure is as follows (cf. figure 25 which is simplified as it does not
show all parameters):
\- UE sends a SIP re-INVITE to the SCF via the IM CN subsystem. The re-INVITE
indicates SCF in the Request-URI and the message includes a list of one or
more Key Domain ID - MSK ID pair(s) of the MSKs that the UE wants to receive
and the bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) in the body of the SIP
INVITE. The XML schema for the list of MBMS user service IDs is defined in TS
26.346 [11] and the XML schema for the B-TID is defined in annex x.1.
\- The SCF receives the asserted identitie(s) of the UE from the headers of
the SIP re-INVITE message. The SCF performs a check based on stored
subscription information whether the UE is authorized to receive the specified
MSK(s). If yes, the procedure continues. If not, the procedure is terminated.
\- If there is no B-TID stored for the UE or if the received B-TID is
different than the one stored for the UE, the SCF runs GBA usage procedure
with the BSF over Zn to fetch the NAF keys corresponding to the UE as defined
in 3GPP TS 33.220 [26]. The NAF-Id which the SCF uses over Zn is constructed
from the NAF FQDN indicated in the service protection description for this
service and Ua security protocol identifier specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [26].
Upon receiving the NAF keys from the BSF, the SCF derives MUK from the NAF key
as defined in 3GPP TS 33.246 [5].\ If the received B-TID is not valid or if
the SCF desires the UE to make a new GBA bootstrapping, the SCF shall response
to the UE with an appropriate error message. The error message will trigger
the UE to run new GBA bootstrapping.
\- The SCF sends a HTTP POST message to the BM-SC. The SCF populates the HTTP
POST as follows:
\- the HTTP version shall be 1.1 which is specified in RFC 2616 [34];
\- the base of the Request-URI shall contain the full BM-SC key management URI
(e.g. http://bmsc.home1.net:1234);
\- the Request-URI shall contain an URI parameter \"requesttype\" that shall
be set to \"sip-based-msk-request\", i.e. Request-URI takes the form of
\"/keymanagement?requesttype= sip-based-msk-request\";
\- the SCF may add additional URI parameters to the Request-URI;
\- X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity header which includes the identities of the UE;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be the MIME type of the payloads;
\- the HTTP payload shall contain a list of one or more Key Domain ID - MSK ID
pair(s) of the MSKs that the UE wants to receive. If new NAF keys were created
in the previous step, then the SCF shall also include MBMS user key (MUK),
lifetime of MUK, NAF FQDN and B-TID. NAF FQDN and B-TID are included as they
may be further included in the MIKEY MSK messages from the BM-SC to the UE,
The XML schema for the list of Key Domain ID - MSK ID pair(s) is defined in
3GPP TS 26.346 [11] and the XML schema for carrying IP address, MUK, MUK
lifetime, NAF FQDN and BTID is defined in annex x.2.
\- the UE may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP POST request.
\- The BM-SC receives the HTTP POST message. The BM-SC checks that the HTTP
POST is valid, and extracts the request for further processing. As the HTTP
POST message came from SCF with asserted identities, the BM-SC does not need
to authenticate the UE as the UE has been authenticated by the IMS. Also, the
HTTP POST message also implicitly indicates to the BM-SC that the SCF has
authorized the UE to receive the specified MSK(s).\ \ The BM-SC stores the
received information and returns HTTP 200 OK to the SCF. The BM-SC shall
populate HTTP response as follows:
\- the HTTP status code in the HTTP status line shall be 200;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be the MIME type of the payload, i.e.
\"application/mbms-msk-response+xml\";
\- the HTTP payload shall contain a list including one status code for each
MSK. The XML schema of the payload is the same that is used for MBMS MSK
request in 3GPP TS 33.246 [5] and it is specified in 3GPP TS 26.346 [11].
\- The SCF receives the HTTP 200 OK. The SCF then includes the XML body from
the HTTP 200 OK message into a SIP 200 OK message and sends the SIP 200 OK
message to the UE via the IM CN subsystem.
#### 10.4.2.3 Updating MUK
The GBA session (i.e. key Ks derived NAF specific keys, e.g. MUK) has a
limited lifetime. The GBA session may expire during service consumption. In
this case the UE shall run GBA bootstrapping again to create a new Ks. The UE
shall then re-register to the services with the SIP based MBMS registration
procedure defined in clause 10.4.2.1 with re-INVITE and the new B-TID. This
will create a new MUK in the UE and network.
#### 10.4.2.4 SIP based BM-SC solicited pull
According to 3GPP TS 33.246 BM-SC solicited pull procedure is triggered by the
BM-SC by sending an MSK message with a specific MSK-ID value. This will
trigger the UE to perform MSK request. IMS based MBMS uses the BM-SC solicited
pull procedure as defined in TS 33.246 to trigger the UE to perform SIP based
basic MSK request procedure which is specified in clause 10.4.2.2.
# 11 Blending of Presence and PSS/MBMS user services
## 11.1 General description
This clause describes the mechanisms that apply when IMS based PSS and MBMS
user services are combined with presence service.
The architecture and functional description of the presence service when used
in relation to the IMS based PSS & MBMS services shall conform to [37].
The protocol details for the presence service when used in relation to the IMS
based PSS & MBMS services shall conform to [36].
The following call flow gives a high-level description for presence service
used in the context of IMS based PSS and MBMS. In this example, the UE 1 is
the watcher and the UE 2 is the presentity. The UE 2 is in the UE 1\'s list of
contacts and wants to publish on-demand content currently watching.
Figure 26: High-level description for presence service used in the context of
IMS based PSS and MBMS
1\. The UE 1 subscribes for presence information for a list of contacts which
includes the UE 2, by sending a SIP SUBSCRIBE message to the Presence Server
as defined in [36].
2\. After having initiated the PSS or MBMS session, or after a content
switching, the UE 2 decides to publish what content is being consumed. The UE
2 sends a SIP Publish message to the Presence Server, as defined in [36],
including additional attributes specific to PSS and MBMS such as the content
being consumed.
3\. On reception of the SIP Publish, the Presence server notifies the UE 1 of
what the UE 2 is doing, by sending a SIP NOTIFY message as defined in [36].
## 11.2 Procedures at the UE acting as presentity
The UE acting as presentity may send a SIP PUBLISH in the following cases:
> \- On receipt of a final SIP 200 OK concerning a PSS streaming session
> initiation procedure;
>
> \- On receipt of a final SIP 200 OK concerning a MBMS streaming session
> initiation procedure;
>
> \- On receipt of a final SIP 200 OK concerning a 3GP-DASH session initiation
> procedure;
>
> \- On receipt of a final SIP 200 OK concerning a MBMS download session
> initiation procedure.
During a streaming session (including DASH-formatted content delivery), the UE
may also send a PUBLISH request after having performed content switching. This
includes the cases of:
> \- PSS content switching (for both PSS streaming and 3GP-DASH services),
>
> \- MBMS content switching (for both MBMS streaming and MBMS download
> services),
>
> \- Switching from PSS to MBMS streaming with channel change,
\- Switching from MBMS to PSS streaming with channel change,
> \- Switching from 3GP-DASH to MBMS download service with channel change,
\- Switching from MBMS download to 3GP-DASH service with channel change.
The content of the PUBLISH request shall be set as follows:
> \- The request-URI, the To and the From headers shall be set to the public
> user identity of the user,\ \- The Event header shall be set to the
> \"presence\" event package,\ \- The content type shall be set to
> \"application/pidf+xml\"
The SIP PUBLISH generated by the UE acting as presentity shall conform to
[36].
The presence XML document included in the PUBLISH body shall conform to [36]
and [37].
Additional elements specific to PSS and MBMS services shall be included in the
XML document. In case of a Live TV service, these specific additional elements
are the Live TV channel currently watched, and the current TV program. In case
of an on-demand service, specific additional element is the on-demand content.
The XML schema used when the presence documents are published by the UE is
described in Annex E of [24], with the following conformity:\ \- the
\"currentBCServiceID\" refers to the LiveTV channel delivered in PSS or MBMS,
> \- the \"currentBCProgramID\" refers to the currently watched program
> delivered in PSS or MBMS,
>
> \- the \"currentCoDContentID\" refers to the currently watched on-demand
> content delivered in PSS.
## 11.3 Procedures at the UE acting as watcher
The SIP SUBSCRIBE generated by the UE acting as a watcher shall conform to
[36].
The UE acting as a watcher may then receive a SIP NOTIFY message including the
content consumed by the UE acting as presentity.
# 12 Networked Bookmark Service
Bookmarking allows a user receiving a content item at an UE to mark a point in
time in the streamed content which he can access at a later time. The content
item is CoD delivered by a PSS server.
The user can later retrieve the bookmark from any device on which he is
registered.
The XML schema used for networked bookmark service is defined in Annex J.
## 12.1 Bookmarking Creation and Storage
The call flow in Figure 27 depicts the sequence for creating a bookmark for a
CoD item and storing it in the user\'s service profile for later retrieval.
{width="5.986111111111111in" height="4.104166666666667in"}
Figure 27: IMS-based Content Bookmark creation and Storage
The following is a brief description of the steps:
1\. The UE has established a CoD session. At some point in time, the user
decides he wants to create a bookmark. If the UE does not have the current
play out position, it sends an RTSP GET-PARAMETER request to the PSS server to
request it.
2\. The response to the RTSP GET-PARAMETER request is returned by the PSS
server in an RTSP 200 OK.
3\. The UE sends to the IM CN Subsystem a SIP INFO Message that includes the
Content-Bookmark Info package as well as the CoD content id. The Content Type
shall include the registered MIME type of XML documents representing
bookmarking data, and shall be set to \"application/3gpp-ims-pss-mbms-
bookmark+xml\" (see Annex J).
4\. The IM CN Subsystem forwards the SIP INFO Message to the SCF.
5\. The SCF issues an XCAP request, on behalf of the user, to update the
service profile with the Content-Bookmark Info data.
6\. The Service Profile returns the response to the SCF.
7\. The SCF returns a SIP 200 OK to the IM CN Subsystem.
8\. The IM CN Subsystem forwards the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
## 12.2 Bookmarking Retrieval
Once a bookmark is created, a user can later retrieve the bookmark anytime,
e.g. prior to or during PSS session establishment procedure, from any device
on which he is registered.
Clause 12.2.1 depicts the bookmarking retrieval procedure which is independent
to PSS session establishment procedure, and clause 12.2.2 depicts the
bookmarking retrieval procedure during a PSS session establishment process.
### 12.2.1 Bookmarking Retrieval independent to session establishment
The call flow in Figure 28 depicts the bookmark retrieval procedure for
retrieving bookmarks stored in the user\'s service profile.
{width="5.986111111111111in" height="1.7493055555555554in"}
Figure 28: Bookmark retrieval independent to session establishment
The following is a brief description of the steps:
1\. The UE issues an XCAP GET request to the Service Profile to request the
bookmarks.
2\. The bookmarks are returned in an HTTP 200 OK response.
### 12.2.2 Bookmarking Retrieval during session establishment
The call flow in Figure 29 depicts the bookmark retrieval procedure for
retrieving bookmarks stored in the user\'s service profile during a PSS
session establishment process.
{width="6.69375in" height="4.131944444444445in"}
Figure 29 Bookmark Retrieval during session establishment
1) The UE sends an SIP INVITE to the SCF via the IM CN Subsystem.
2) The IM CN Subsystem forwards the SIP INVITE to the SCF.
3) The SCF validates the SIP INVITE request, and checks the rights of user for
the requested content by sending an XCAP GET with the user ID and content
identifier to the Service Profile.
4) The Service Profile authorizes the user, and returns the user\'s service
profile with the bookmark list if it is set before. Each bookmark in the list
should contain at least the content ID and the time reference.
5) The SCF selects the appropriate PSS Adapter for the requested content, and
sends the SIP INVITE to the PSS Adapter via the IM CN Subsystem. The PSS
Adapter then selects the PSS Server and sends the RTSP SETUP to the PSS
Server.
6) The PSS Server returns an RTSP 200 OK to PSS Adapter, which returns a SIP
200 OK to the SCF via the IM CN Subsystem.
7) The SCF returns the SIP 200 OK to the UE via the IM CN Subsystem, with the
bookmark list.
8) The IM CN Subsystem forwards the SIP 200 OK to UE.
9) The UE plays out the bookmark list to the user, and the user selects the
bookmark from which they wish to start viewing the content.
# 13 User generated content service
This clause defines the provision and distribution procedures of user
generated content (UGC) for IMS based PSS and MBMS User Services.
User generated content refers to content that is provided by an UE e.g. video
or audio captured by an in-built camera or microphone. In the following this
UE is noted as providing UE, and the UE receiving UGC by PSS or MBMS is noted
as receiving UE.
The UGC provision procedure allows a providing UE to declare and
upload/upstream UGC content to the network, which is defined in clasue 13.1.
The UGC distribution procedrue allows a receiving UE to select and watch User
Generated Content which is defined in clause 13.2.
## 13.1 UGC content provision procedure
UGC provision procecure is carried out in four steps as shown in figure 30:
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="4.249305555555556in"}
Figure 30 : IMS Based UGC Provision Procedures
NOTE: The UGC reception server can be implemented independent to, or within
PSS Server, or BMSC.UPF.
[Step 1: Declaration of UGC]{.underline}:
The providing UE sends a UGC declaration request to the SCF. The SCF records
the UGC information, generates a unique UGC content ID and sends a UGC
declaration response with the content ID to the providing UE.
NOTE: The content ID that should be used is out of scope of this release.
[Step 2: Publication of UGC information by the providing UE]{.underline}:
The providing UE sends to the SCF a UGC description request including a UGC
description, e.g. name, type, restriction, textual description, special group
users etc. together with the UGC content ID.
The SCF records the UGC description, establishes the relationship between UGC
content ID and UGC description, and sends UGC description response to the
providing UE.
NOTE: Step 1 is always the first step. Step 2 may happen at any time during
the UGC provision procedure and can be repeated during the lifetime of the
content, e.g. for updating of the UGC description.
NOTE: The messages supporting steps 1 and 2 may be embedded in the messages
supporting step 3.
[Step 3: Creation of UGC]{.underline}:
User generated content could be provided for distribution by different means
i.e. uploading and upstreaming from the providing UE.
Uploading should be used for user generated content that is stored at the UE.
For uploading, HTTP should be used. 3GPP file format according to [39] should
be supported.
Upstreaming should be used for live content that is continuously generated
during upstreaming. For upstreaming, multimedia telephony service over IMS
(MTSI) as defined in [38] should be used.
The SCF should signal the address of the UGC reception server to the providing
UE.
In case of uploading, a HTTP connection is established and UGC is uploaded to
a UGC upload reception server. In this case the upload reception server must
support HTTP.
In case of upstreaming, the providing UE initiates a MTSI session and
upstreams the UGC to the UGC upstreaming reception server. In this case, the
upstreaming reception server must support MTSI specifications [38].
[Step 4: Publication of UGC information by the SCF:]{.underline}
The SCF establishes the relationship between UGC content ID, UGC description
and optionally UGC location (address), and publishes the UGC description
information.
Step 4 may take place before, during or after step 3. In case of upstreaming,
step 4 is carried out before step 3.
The UE can modify or terminate the established UGC creation session later on.
NOTE: Updating the SSF for UGC information from the SCF is required, but the
method for achieving this is out scope of this specification.
## 13.2 UGC distribution procedure
The UGC reception server is responsible for repackaging and/or transcoding the
uploaded or upstreamed content into such a form that can be served to legacy
PSS servers and BMSCs. The UGC reception server is responsible for serving
received UCG to legacy PSS Servers and BMSC in live and pre-recorded forms.
This interface is out of scope for this release.
Content distribution is carried out using either PSS or MBMS. In case of PSS,
UGC is distributed by the PSS server. In case of MBMS, UGC is distributed via
the BMSC.UPF.
Distribution of user generated content to PSS and MBMS clients (receiving UEs)
uses the same procedures for service provider discovery (clause 5), user
service discovery (clause 6) and description retrieval (clause 7), streaming
(clause 8) and download delivery as content that is provided in a different
way.
# 14 MBMS Download Service
This section depicts the procedures for retrieval of missing parameters before
session initiation in clause 14.1, the MBMS download session initiation, file
repair and reception report procedures in clause 14.2, and session teardown
procedure in clause 14.3.
## 14.1 Missing parameters before session initiation
### 14.1.1 Procedures at the UE
If the UE does not have the all the information it needs to form an SDP offer,
the UE shall send a SIP OPTIONS message.
The \"Request-URI\" is related to the MBMS service that the user wants to
activate. The \"Request-URI\" shall be composed of a user and domain part as
defined as follows:
\- The user part contains the serviceId.
\- The domain part is the Service Provider domain name, obtained from SSF.
The TO header shall contain the same URI as in the \"Request-URI\" parameter.
The FROM header shall indicate the public user identity of the user.
Upon reception of the 200 OK including service access information encapsulated
in multipart/MIME, the UE shall initiate MBMS download session as described in
14.2.
### 14.1.2 Procedures at the SCF
When receiving the SIP OPTIONS message, the SCF shall examine the serviceId
present in the user-part of the TO header and lookup the requested User
Service Description information.
The SCF shall answer with the user service description information of the
content delivery channel (encapsulated in multipart/MIME) as requested by the
serviceId.
## 14.2 MBMS Download Session Initiation, File Repair and Reception Report
### 14.2.1 General description
Figure 31 gives an overview about the procedures for an IMS based MBMS
Download Session initiation, File-Repair and reception report.
If an associated delivery procedure description for File-Repair operations is
available, then the UE receiver may use the File-Repair service as specified
in [11] sub-clause 9.3.
If an associated delivery procedure description for reception reporting is
available, then the UE shall provide reception reports as specified in [11]
sub-clause 9.4.
Figure 31 Procedures for IMS based MBMS Download
Step 1, 2: The UE generates an initial SIP INVITE message sent to the SCF,
indicating the chosen MBMS Download Service. A SDP offer is included in the
SIP INVITE message.
Step 3, 4: Upon receipt of SIP INVITE the SCF examine the SDP parameters in
the SDP offer. In case of a successful examination, the SCF answers with a SIP
200 OK including the SDP answer.
Step 5: The UE receives the MBMS download data using FLUTE.
Step 6: In case of incomplete download, file repair procedures are executed.
If the UE uses IMS-based procedures to initiate the file repair session, the
following sequence of steps shall be exercised. Figure 31a gives an overview
of the procedures for an IMS-based MBMS File Repair session initiation.
\- Step 6a: The UE initiates the file repair session and tears down the MBMS
download session by sending a SIP Re-INVITE message to the IM CN subsystem..
\- Step 6b: The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP Re-INVITE message to the SCF.
\- Step 6c: The SCF verifies the user rights for the requested file repair
service, selects a HTTP/SIP adapter, and forwards the SIP Re-INVITE message to
the HTTP/SIP adapter. Furthermore, the SCF shall tear down the FLUTE-based
MBMS download session between the BMSC.UPF and UE.
\- Step 6d: The HTTP/SIP adapter selects a HTTP Server for the file repair
service, and sends an HTTP POST message to the HTTP server, including the IP
address of the UE.
\- Step 6e: The HTTP server answers to the HTTP/SIP adapter with a HTTP 200 OK
response.
\- Step 6f: The HTTP/SIP adapter sends the SIP 200 OK answer to the SCF,
including URI of the file repair server in the SDP answer.
\- Step 6g: The SCF forwards the SIP 200 OK to the IM CN subsystem.
\- Step 6h: The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
\- Step 6i: The UE leaves the multicast channel and sends HTTP request(s) to
the URI obtained from the SIP 200 OK message to execute file repair
procedures. The HTTP server delivers the requested content file(s) for file
repair in the HTTP response(s) to the UE.
Step 7, 8: The UE reports the reception statistics using either HTTP or SIP
INFO message.
Figure 31a Procedures for IMS based MBMS File Repair Session Initiation
### 14.2.2 Procedures at the UE
The UE shall support the procedures specified in TS 24 229 [7] for originating
sessions.
The UE shall generate an initial INVITE request:
\- The Request-URI in the INVITE request shall be the well known PSI (Public
Service Identifier) of the MBMS Download Service.
\- The To header shall contain the same URI as in the Request-URI.
\- The From header shall indicate the public user identity of the user.
An SDP offer shall be included in the request. The SDP offer shall be done in
accordance with the parameters received during UE service selection procedure
and with media capabilities and required bandwidth available for the MBMS
download service. The SDP offer shall include the following elements:
\- An a=source-filter line to indicate the IP source address of the FLUTE
session.
\- An a=flute-tsi line to indicate Transport Session ID (TSI) of the FLUTE
session.
NOTE: The combination of the **TSI** and the **IP source address** identifies
the FLUTE session.
\- The m-line(s) shall be set to the media parameters retrieved via service
selection procedures for the requested MBMS download service.
\- The c-line(s) shall be set according to the multicast address retrieved via
service selection procedures for the requested MBMS download service.
The descriptions of above parameters conform to section 7.3 of 3GPP TS
26.346[11].
\- An a=mbms_download_service:ServiceId line to indicate the MBMS download
service which the UE intends to initiate.
Once the UE receives the SIP response, the UE shall examine the FLUTE session
parameters in the received SDP, and receive the MBMS download data
accordingly.
In case the FDT is unavailable, the UE shall get the FDT according to
fdt_address attribute in the SDP Answer. The FDT contains content description
information for the files delivered in the FLUTE session.
In case of incomplete download, the UE shall execute the file repair
procedures towards the repair server indicated by repair-server-address
attribute in the SDP Answer. In the case the file repair procedures are to be
conducted over broadcast/multicast delivery, the repair-server-address:uri
should instead indicate the Session Description (SDP file) for the
broadcast/multicast repair session and UE shall then use this URI to fetch the
SDP and join the corresponding broadcast/multicast repair session.
If the UE uses IMS-based methods to initiate file repair procedures, it shall
handle this by tearing down the FLUTE-based MBMS download session and
activating the file repair service, by issuing a SIP Re-INVITE sent to the IM
CN subsystem. An SDP offer and Request-URI pointed to the repair server shall
be included in the SIP Re-INVITE message to activate the file repair. The
repair server URI shall be indicated in the Request-URI of the SIP Re-INVITE
message based on the repair-server-address attribute indicated in the SDP
Answer from the SCF during MBMS download session initiation. The To header
shall contain the same URI as in the Request-URI (repair server address URI).
The From header shall indicate the public user identity of the user. An SDP
offer shall be included in the Re-INVITE request. The SDP media parameters
should describe the HTTP-based file repair session and shall be set as
follows:
\- a \'m\' line for an HTTP-based file repair session of format: m=\
\ \ \
\- - The media field shall have a value of \"application\".
\- - The port field shall be set to a value of 9, which is the discard port.
See RFC 4145 [13] and RFC 4572 [14].
\- - The transport field shall be set to TCP or TCP/TLS. The former is used
when HTTP runs directly on top of TCP and the latter is used when HTTP runs on
top of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP.
\- - The \ parameter shall be included and shall be set to _3gpp_http._
NOTE: the _3gpp_http_ application format should have a new MIME subtype
registered in IANA.
\- An \"a=setup\" attribute shall be present and set to \"active\" indicating
that the UE will initiate an outgoing TCP connection to the HTTP Server.
\- An \"a= connection\" attribute shall be present and set as \"new\"
indicating that the UE will establish a new outgoing TCP connection towards
the HTTP Server.
\- A \"c\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN, the
address type set to IP4 or IP6 and IP address of the flow of the related HTTP
download channel (ex. c=IN IP4 \).
\- Optionally a \"b=\" line may contain the proposed bandwidth. If the user
has fetched the bandwidth required for this particular content delivery
channel during service selection retrieval, the bandwidth attribute at media
level shall be set to this value. Otherwise, this attribute shall be set to a
pre-configured value;\ (ex. b=AS:15000)
Once the UE has received the SIP 200 OK from the HTTP/SIP adapter, it sends
the HTTP GET request to the URL obtained in file repair session description.
The UE shall report the reception statistics using either HTTP or SIP INFO
message according to report-channel parameter of the SDP Answer. The XML
contents in the report message refer to section 9.5.3.2 of 3GPP TS 26.346[11].
### 14.2.3 Procedures at the IM CN Subsystem
The IM CN subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
In case of IMS-based MBMS file repair, the IM CN subsystem shall forward the
SIP Re-INVITE from the UE to the SCF. Upon reception of the SIP 200 OK from
the SCF, the IM CN subsystem shall forward the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
### 14.2.4 Procedures at the SCF
The SCF shall support the procedures specified in TS 24.229 [7] applicable to
an AS acting as a terminating UA.
Upon receipt of SIP INVITE request, the SCF shall perform service
authorization procedures to check the service rights of requested MBMS
download service according to the user subscription information, See clause
10.4.
The SCF shall examine the SDP parameters in the SDP offer.
\- It shall examine the a=mbms_download_service parameter. This parameter
contains the channel the UE intends to join. If the mbms_download_service
parameter does not point to a channel that the UE is allowed to join the SCF
shall not accept the offer and shall answer with a 403 error code.
\- It shall examine the c-line(s) to determine that it is a multicast session.
It may also check that it corresponds to the mbms_download_service parameter.
If not, the SCF shall answer with a 403 error code.
If the SDP parameters are examined successfully, the SCF shall answer with a
SIP 200 OK, indicating the SDP answer as follows:
\- the m-line(s) and c-line(s) shall be identical to ones indicated in the SDP
offer.
\- The source-filter and flute-tsi attributes shall be identical to ones
indicated in the SDP offer.
\- An a=fdt_address:uri to indicate the address of the File Delivery Table.
\- An a=repair-server-address:uri to indicate the address of the repair
server. In the case the file repair procedures are to be conducted over
broadcast/multicast delivery, the repair-server-address:uri should instead be
the URI of the Session Description (SDP file) of the broadcast/multicast
repair session.
\- An a=report-channel:SIP/HTTP line to indicate to the UE that the reception
report procedure should be performed by SIP or HTTP channel.
\- It shall include an a=recvonly attribute.
If the SCF receives a SIP modification request from the UE to initiate a file
repair session (i.e., in a SIP Re-INVITE message as described in clause
14.2.2), it shall check the user rights for the requested service, identify
that the request is for MBMS file repair procedures and determine if the
program currently broadcasted has HTTP-based file repair support. If this is
not available for the UE, the session modification shall be rejected and the
old MBMS session (along with the previous reserved resources) is maintained.
Moreover, if broadcast/multicast repair is offered, SCF shall again reject the
SIP modification request and reply with the URI for the SDP of the
broadcast/multicast repair session (in case this is different from the current
FLUTE session).
If HTTP-based file repair is available for the UE, the SCF acting as a B2BUA
shall perform the following:
\- The SCF shall select a HTTP/SIP adapter and generate the SIP INVITE request
to the HTTP/SIP adapter which is in charge of the file repair service by
changing the \"Request-URI\" accordingly. . The \'To\' header of the SIP
INVITE request shall be the same as the Request-URI of the SIP Re-INVITE
request received from the UE. When receiving a 301 or 302 response from the
HTTP/SIP adapter, the SCF shall not forward this message to the UE.
\- The SCF shall tear down the FLUTE-based MBMS download session between the
BMSC.UPF and UE.
### 14.2.5 Procedures at the BMSC.UPF
The MBMS FLUTE session is already ongoing at the BMSC.UPF. No specific action
is required.
### 14.2.6 Procedures at the HTTP/SIP Adapter
In case of IMS-based file repair, upon reception of SIP INVITE request from
the SCF, the HTTP/SIP adapter shall shall examine the To header and the media
parameters in the SDP and select a HTTP Server for the file repair service
according to the Request URI. The HTTP/SIP adapter shall send an HTTP POST
message to the HTTP server, including the IP address of the UE.
The HTTP/SIP adapter may decide to redirect the request to another HTTP/SIP
adapter server. In this case the HTTP/SIP adapter shall return a 301 response
if the file repair service is not managed by this HTTP/SIP adapter or 302
response for any other reasons (e.g. load balancing). The redirecting HTTP/SIP
adapter indicates one or more destination HTTP/SIP adapter addresses in the
Contact header.
The HTTP/SIP adapter shall return the SIP 200 OK message to the SCF, including
the SDP answer. The SDP answer should describe the HTTP-based file repair
session including URI of the designated repair server. The HTTP/SIP adapter
shall construct the SIP 200 OK message as follows:
\- an \'m\' line for an HTTP download channel of format: m=\ \
\ \
\- The media field shall have a value of \"application\".
\- The port field shall be set to the value of HTTP Server for the downlaod
channel, such as 80.
\- The transport field shall be set to TCP or TCP/TLS. The former is used when
HTTP runs directly on top of TCP and the latter is used when HTTP runs on top
of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP.
\- The fmt field shall be identical to the one received in the SDP offer.
\- a \"c\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN, the
address type set to IP4 or IP6 and IP address of HTTP Server for the flow of
the related HTTP download channel (e.g. c=IN IP4 \).
\- The \"a=setup\" attribute shall be present and set to \'passive\'
indicating that connection shall be initiated by the other endpoint (UE).
\- An \"a= connection\" attribute shall be present and set as \"new\"
indicating that the UE will establish a new outgoing TCP connection towards
the HTTP Server.
\- An a=repair-server-address:uri to indicate the address of the repair
server.
\- the \"b=\" line shall contain the proposed bandwidth. Since the content
download is unidirectional the bandwidth shall be set to 0.(ex. b=AS:0).
### 14.2.7 Procedures at the HTTP Server
In case of IMS-based file repair, upon reception of the HTTP POST message
received from the HTTP/SIP adapter, the HTTP server shall answer to the
HTTP/SIP adapter with a HTTP 200 OK response.
## 14.3 MBMS Download Session Teardown
### 14.3.1 General Description
Figure 32: MBMS Download Session Termination
Step 1: UE receives download content from the BM-SC.UPF.
Step 2, 3: UE initiates a SIP BYE message to SCF, indicating which MBMS
download session to close.
Step 4, 5: SCF responds UE with a SIP 200 OK message when the SIP BYE is
successfully handled and session terminated. At this stage, the UE can stop
receiving the MBMS download session.
The UE may deactivate the according MBMS Bearer Service during steps 2 to 5 or
after step 5. The deactivation is either according to the MBMS Broadcast
Service deactivation (3GPP TS 23.246 [4]) or the MBMS Multicast Mode
deactivation procedure (3GPP TS 23.246 [4]).
### 14.3.2 Procedures at the UE
The UE shall send a SIP BYE to the SCF.
The UE may deactivate the according MBMS Bearer Service during steps 2 to 5 or
after step 5 of clause 8.3.5.1. The deactivation is either according to the
MBMS Broadcast Service deactivation (3GPP TS 23.246 [4]) or the MBMS Multicast
Mode deactivation procedure (3GPP TS 23.246 [4]).
### 14.3.3 Procedures at the IM CN Subsystem
The IM CN subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
### 14.3.4 Procedures at the SCF
The SCF responds to the UE with a SIP 200 OK message after handling of the SIP
BYE message.
### 14.3.5 Procedures at the BMSC.UPF
The BMSC.UPF is acting as described in 3GPP TS 23.246 [4].
## 14.4 IMS-based MBMS File Repair Session Teardown
Identical SIP procedures for tearing down PSS download delivery sessions as
described in clause 15.7 shall be used.
## 14.5 IMS-based Switching from MBMS Download to PSS Download
### 14.5.1 General Description
Figure 32b: IMS-based Switching from MBMS Download to PSS download
Figure 32b gives an overview of the procedures for IMS-based switching from
MBMS download to PSS download. The following steps are carried out:
\- Step 1: The UE initiates the PSS download session and tears down the MBMS
download session by sending a SIP Re-INVITE message to the IM CN subsystem
including an SDP offer.
\- Step 2: The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP Re-INVITE message to the SCF.
\- Step 3: The SCF verifies the user rights for the requested PSS download
service, selects a HTTP/SIP adapter, and sends a SIP INVITE message to the
HTTP/SIP adapter. Furthermore, the SCF shall tear down the FLUTE-based MBMS
download session between the BMSC.UPF and UE.
\- Step 4: The HTTP/SIP adapter selects a HTTP Server for the PSS download
service, and sends an HTTP POST message to the HTTP server, including the IP
address of the UE.
\- Step 5: The HTTP server answers to the HTTP/SIP adapter with a HTTP 200 OK
response.
\- Step 6: The HTTP/SIP adapter sends the SIP 200 OK answer to the SCF,
including the URI of the HTTP server in the SDP answer.
\- Step 7: The SCF forwards the SIP 200 OK to the IM CN subsystem.
\- Step 8: The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
\- Step 9: The UE leaves the MBMS download session and sends HTTP request(s)
to the URI obtained from the SIP 200 OK message to execute PSS download
procedures. The HTTP server delivers the requested content file(s) for PSS
download in the HTTP response(s) to the UE.
### 14.5.2 Procedures at the UE
The UE shall tear down the FLUTE-based MBMS download session and initiate the
PSS download service, by issuing a SIP Re-INVITE sent to the IM CN subsystem.
An SDP offer and Request-URI pointed to the HTTP server shall be included in
the SIP Re-INVITE message to initiate the PSS download service. The content of
the SIP Re-INVITE shall be as follows:
\- The Request URI is related to the session the user wants to activate The
Request-URI shall be composed of a user and domain part as defined as follows:
\- The user part contains the content identifier, retrieved from user service
description information from SSF
\- - The domain part is the Service Provider domain name, obtained from SSF.
\- The To header shall contain the same URI as in the Request URI.
\- The From header shall indicate the public user identity of the user.
The content identifier shall be retrieved from service selection information.
An SDP offer shall be included in the SIP Re-INVITE request. The SDP media
parameters should describe the PSS download session and shall be set as
follows:
\- a \'m\' line for an HTTP-based download session of format: m=\
\ \ \
\- - The media field shall have a value of \"application\".
\- - The port field shall be set to a value of 9, which is the discard port.
See RFC 4145 [13] and RFC 4572 [14].
\- - The transport field shall be set to TCP or TCP/TLS. The former is used
when HTTP runs directly on top of TCP and the latter is used when HTTP runs on
top of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP.
\- - The \ parameter shall be included and shall be set to _3gpp_http._
NOTE: the _3gpp_http_ application format should have a new MIME subtype
registered in IANA.
\- An \"a=setup\" attribute shall be present and set to \"active\" indicating
that the UE will initiate an outgoing TCP connection to the HTTP Server.
\- An \"a= connection\" attribute shall be present and set as \"new\"
indicating that the UE will establish a new outgoing TCP connection towards
the HTTP Server.
\- A \"c\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN, the
address type set to IP4 or IP6 and IP address of the flow of the related HTTP
download channel (ex. c=IN IP4 \).
\- Optionally a \"b=\" line may contain the proposed bandwidth. If the user
has fetched the bandwidth required for this particular content delivery
channel during service selection retrieval, the bandwidth attribute at media
level shall be set to this value. Otherwise, this attribute shall be set to a
pre-configured value;\ (ex. b=AS:15000)
Once the UE has received the SIP 200 OK from the HTTP/SIP adapter, it sends
the HTTP GET request to the URL obtained in download session description. The
HTTP \"Connection\" header shall be set to \"Keep-Alive\" to require
persistent TCP connection.
### 14.5.3 Procedures at the IM CN Subsystem
The IM CN subsystem shall forward the SIP Re-INVITE from the UE to the SCF.
Upon reception of the SIP 200 OK from the SCF, the IM CN subsystem shall
forward the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
The IM CN Subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
### 14.5.4 Procedures at the SCF
When the SCF receives a SIP modification request from the UE to initiate a PSS
download session, i.e., in a SIP Re-INVITE message as described in clause
14.5.2, it shall check the user rights for the requested service, identify
that the request is for PSS download procedures and determine if the program
currently broadcasted has HTTP-based PSS download support. If this is not
available for the UE, the session modification shall be rejected and the old
MBMS session (along with the previous reserved resources) is maintained.
If HTTP-based PSS download is available for the UE, the SCF acting as a B2BUA
shall perform the following:
\- The SCF shall select a HTTP/SIP adapter and send the SIP INVITE request to
the HTTP/SIP adapter which is in charge of the PSS download service by
changing the \"Request-URI\" accordingly. The \'To\' header of the SIP INVITE
request shall be the same as the Request-URI of the SIP Re-INVITE request
received from the UE. When receiving a 301 or 302 response from the HTTP/SIP
adapter, the SCF shall not forward this message to the UE. The SCF shall
respond to the UE with a SIP 200 OK message after successful handling of the
SIP Re-INVITE message.
\- The SCF shall tear down the FLUTE-based MBMS download session between the
BMSC.UPF and UE.
### 14.5.5 Procedures at the BMSC.UPF
The BMSC.UPF is acting as described in 3GPP TS 23.246 [4].
### 14.5.6 Procedures at the HTTP/SIP Adapter
Upon reception of SIP INVITE request from the SCF, the HTTP/SIP adapter shall
shall examine the To header and the media parameters in the SDP and select a
HTTP Server for the PSS download service according to the Request URI. The
HTTP/SIP adapter shall send an HTTP POST message to the HTTP server, including
the IP address of the UE.
The HTTP/SIP adapter may decide to redirect the request to another HTTP/SIP
adapter server. In this case the HTTP/SIP adapter shall return a 301 response
if the PSS download service is not managed by this HTTP/SIP adapter or 302
response for any other reasons (e.g. load balancing). The redirecting HTTP/SIP
adapter indicates one or more destination HTTP/SIP adapter addresses in the
Contact header.
The HTTP/SIP adapter shall return the SIP 200 OK message to the SCF, including
the SDP answer. The SDP answer should describe the HTTP-based PSS download
session including URI of the designated HTTP server. The HTTP/SIP adapter
shall construct the SIP 200 OK message as follows:
\- an \'m\' line for an HTTP download channel of format: m=\ \
\ \
\- The media field shall have a value of \"application\".
\- The port field shall be set to the value of HTTP Server for the downlaod
channel, such as 80.
\- The transport field shall be set to TCP or TCP/TLS. The former is used when
HTTP runs directly on top of TCP and the latter is used when HTTP runs on top
of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP.
\- - The fmt field shall be identical to the one received in the SDP offer.
\- a \"c\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN, the
address type set to IP4 or IP6 and IP address of HTTP Server for the flow of
the related HTTP download channel (e.g. c=IN IP4 \).
\- The \"a=setup\" attribute shall be present and set to \'passive\'
indicating that connection shall be initiated by the other endpoint (UE).
\- An \"a= connection\" attribute shall be present and set as \"new\"
indicating that the UE will establish a new outgoing TCP connection towards
the HTTP Server.
\- One or more a=fmtp lines representing HTTP specific attributes set as
follows:
\- a \"fmtp:3gpp_http http-url\" attribute in the format of an absolute URI to
be used for the UE in the subsequent HTTP requests. The hâ€‘uri can be in form
of absolute or relative URI. If absolute URI is specified then it is used as-
is in subsequent HTTP requests. If relative URI is specified in form of a
media path, then the HTTP absolute URI could be constructed by the UE using
the IPAddress (from c-line) and port (from m-line) as the base followed by
h-uri value for the content path.
\- the \"b=\" line shall contain the proposed bandwidth. Since the content
download is unidirectional the bandwidth shall be set to 0.(ex. b=AS:0).
### 14.5.7 Procedures at the HTTP Server
Upon reception of the HTTP POST message received from the HTTP/SIP adapter,
the HTTP server shall answer to the HTTP/SIP adapter with a HTTP 200 OK
response.
Upon reception of the HTTP GET received from the UE, the HTTP server delivers
in the HTTP response the content file corresponding to the URL obtained in the
received HTTP GET. The HTTP \"Connection\" header shall be set to \"Keep-
Alive\" to indicate it is a persistent TCP connection.

Figure 33: IMS based session set-up for progressive download
1) The UE initiates the progressive download session by sending SIP INVITE to
the IM CN subsystem, including an SDP offer.
2) The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP INVITE message to the SCF.
3) The SCF verifies the user rights for the requested content, selects a
HTTP/SIP adapter, and forwards the SIP INVITE message to the HTTP/SIP adapter.
4) The HTTP/SIP adapter selects a HTTP Server, and sends an HTTP POST message
to the HTTP server, including the IP address of the UE.
5) The HTTP server answers to the HTTP/SIP adapter with a HTTP 200 OK
response.
6) The HTTP/SIP adapter sends the SIP 200 OK answer to the SCF, including
download URL of the requested content file in the SDP answer.
7) The SCF forward the SIP 200 OK to the IM CN subsystem.
8) The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
9) The UE sends HTTP request to the URL obtained from the SIP 200 OK message.
10) The HTTP server delivers the content file in the HTTP response to the UE.
## 15.2 Procedures at the UE
The UE initiates the progressive download session by sending SIP INVITE to the
IM CN subsystem. The content of the SIP INVITE shall be as follows:
\- The Request URI is related to the session the user wants to activate The
Request-URI shall be composed of a user and domain part as defined as follows:
\- The user part contains the content identifier, retrieved from user service
description information from SSF
\- The domain part is the Service Provider domain name, obtained from SSF.
\- The To header shall contain the same URI as in the Request URI.
\- The From header shall indicate the public user identity of the user.
The content identifier shall be retrieved from service selection information.
The other headers shall be set according to 24.229 [7].
An SDP offer shall be included in the initial INVITE request, in accordance
with media capabilities and policies available for the PSS session and with
the parameters received from the SSF during service selection procedure or
during the procedure for retrieving missing parameters by SIP OPTIONS.
The SDP media parameters should describe the HTTP progressive download
session. The differences with the SDP offer defined for streaming is the
absence of media line corresponding to the control protocol (RTSP), and the
indication of TCP transport and HTTP progressive download method instead of
streaming in \"m\" line.
The SDP parameters for the HTTP progressive download channel shall be set as
follows:
\- a \'m\' line for an HTTP progressive download channel of format: m=\
\ \ \
\- The media field shall have a value of \"application\".
\- The port field shall be set to a value of 9, which is the discard port. See
RFC 4145 [13] and RFC 4572 [14].
\- The transport field shall be set to TCP or TCP/TLS. The former is used when
HTTP runs directly on top of TCP and the latter is used when HTTP runs on top
of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP.
\- The \ parameter shall be included and shall be set to _3gpp_http._
NOTE: the _3gpp_http_ application format should have a new MIME subtype
registered in IANA.
\- An \"a=setup\" attribute shall be present and set to \"active\" indicating
that the UE will initiate an outgoing TCP connection to the HTTP Server.
\- An \"a= connection\" attribute shall be present and set as \"new\"
indicating that the UE will establish a new outgoing TCP connection towards
the HTTP Server.
\- A \"c\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN, the
address type set to IP4 or IP6 and IP address of the flow of the related HTTP
progressive download channel (ex. c=IN IP4 \).
\- Optionally a \"b=\" line may contain the proposed bandwidth. If the user
has fetched the bandwidth required for this particular content delivery
channel during service selection retrieval, the bandwidth attribute at media
level shall be set to this value. Otherwise, this attribute shall be set to a
pre-configured value;\ (ex. b=AS:15000)
An example of the SDP offer for IMS-based PSS progressive download is:
v=0
o=bob 2890844527 2890844527 IN IP4 192.0.2.2
s=Download Session
i=A download session declared within the session description protocol
t=0 0
m=application 9 TCP 3gpp_http
a=connection:new
a=setup:active
c= IN IP4 192.0.2.2
b=AS:15000
Once the UE has received the SIP 200 OK from the HTTP/SIP adapter, it sends
the HTTP GET request to the URL obtained in download session description. The
HTTP \"Connection\" header shall be set to \"Keep-Alive\" to require
persistent TCP connection.
An example of the HTTP GET request sent by the UE is:
HTTP GET http://123.23.23.23/ movie1.mpeg
## 15.3 Procedures at the IM CN subsystem
The IM CN subsystem shall forward the SIP INVITE to the SCF.
Upon reception of the SIP 200 OK from the SCF, the IM CN subsystem forwards
the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
The IM CN Subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
## 15.4 Procedures at the SCF
Upon reception of the SIP INVITE from the UE, the SCF checks the user rights
for the requested content, identifies that the request is for progressive
download, selects and forwards the SIP request to the HTTP/SIP adapter which
is in charge of the download service by changing the \"Request-URI\"
accordingly.
When receiving a 301 or 302 response from the HTTP/SIP adapter, the SCF shall
not forward this message to the UE.
## 15.5 Procedures at the HTTP/SIP adapter
Upon reception of the download session initiation request, the HTTP/SIP
adapter shall examine the content identifier present in the user-part of the
To header and the media parameters in the SDP, selects a HTTP Server according
to the Request URI, and sends a HTTP POST message to the HTTP server including
the IP address of the UE.
The HTTP/SIP adapter may decide to redirect the request to another HTTP/SIP
adapter server. In this case the HTTP/SIP adapter shall return a 301 response
if the content is not managed by this HTTP/SIP adapter or 302 response for any
other reasons (e.g. load balancing). The redirecting HTTP/SIP adapter
indicates one or more destination HTTP/SIP adapter addresses in the Contact
header.
The HTTP/SIP adapter returns the SIP 200 OK message to the SCF, including the
SDP answer. The SDP answer should describe the HTTP progressive download
session. The differences with the SDP answer defined for streaming is the
absence of media line corresponding to the control protocol (RTSP), the
indication of TCP transport and HTTP progressive download method instead of
streaming in \"m\" line, the indication of HTTP URL instead of RTSP URI.
If the content that the user has selected cannot be found the HTTP/SIP adapter
shall reply with appropriate, SIP error code 404 Not Found response.
The HTTP/SIP adapter shall construct the SIP 200 OK message as follows:
\- an \'m\' line for an HTTP progressive download channel of format:
m=\ \ \ \
\- The media field shall have a value of \"application\".
\- The port field shall be set to the value of HTTP Server for the progressive
download channel, such as 80.
\- The transport field shall be set to TCP or TCP/TLS. The former is used when
HTTP runs directly on top of TCP and the latter is used when HTTP runs on top
of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP.
\- The fmt field shall be identical to the one received in the SDP offer.
-
\- a \"c\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN, the
address type set to IP4 or IP6 and IP address of HTTP Server for the flow of
the related HTTP progressive download channel (e.g. c=IN IP4 \).
\- The \"a=setup\" attribute shall be present and set to \'passive\'
indicating that connection shall be initiated by the other endpoint (UE).
\- An \"a= connection\" attribute shall be present and set as \"new\"
indicating that the UE will establish a new outgoing TCP connection towards
the HTTP Server.
\- One or more a=fmtp lines representing HTTP specific attributes set as
follows:
\- a \"fmtp:3gpp_http http-url\" attribute in the format of an absolute URI to
be used for the UE in the subsequent HTTP requests. The hâ€‘uri can be in form
of absolute or relative URI. If absolute URI is specified then it is used as-
is in subsequent HTTP requests. If relative URI is specified in form of a
media path, then the HTTP absolute URI could be constructed by the UE using
the IPAddress (from c-line) and port (from m-line) as the base followed by
h-uri value for the content path.
\- the \"b=\" line shall contain the proposed bandwidth. Since the content
download is unidirectional the bandwidth shall be set to 0.(ex. b=AS:0).
An example of the SDP answer in the SIP 200 OK response is:
v=0
o=bob 2890844527 2890844527 IN IP4 192.0.2.1
s=Download Session
i=A download session declared within the session description protocol

a=connection:new
a=setup:passive
a=fmtp 3gpp_http h-url http://operator.com/movie1.mpeg
c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
b=AS:0
## 15.6 Procedures at the HTTP server
Upon reception of the HTTP POST message received from the HTTP/SIP adapter,
the HTTP server answers with an HTTP 200 OK message to the HTTP/SIP adapter.
Upon reception of the HTTP GET received from the UE, the HTTP server delivers
in the HTTP response the content file corresponding to the URL obtained in the
received HTTP GET. The HTTP \"Connection\" header shall be set to \"Keep-
Alive\" to indicate it is a persistent TCP connection.

## 15.8 IMS-based Switching from PSS Download to MBMS Download
### 15.8.1 General Description
Figure 33d: IMS-based Switching from PSS Download to MBMS download
Figure 33d gives an overview about the procedures for IMS based switching from
PSS download to MBMS download. The following steps are carried out:
1) The UE sends a SIP Re-INVITE message to the IM CN subsystem indicating the
chosen MBMS download service. A SDP offer is included in the SIP Re-INVITE
message.
2) The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP Re-INVITE message to the SCF.
3) Upon receipt of SIP Re-INVITE message, the SCF examines the parameters in
the SDP offer and verifies the user rights for the requested MBMS download
service. In case of a successful examination, the SCF sends the SIP BYE
message to the HTTP/SIP adapter in order to terminate the PSS download
session.
4) The HTTP/SIP adapter sends an HTTP POST to the HTTP server.
5) In case the HTTP Server is transmitting the content file(s) for the PSS
download service, it stops sending data for this session. The HTTP server
sends a HTTP 200 OK to the HTTP/SIP adapter.
6) The HTTP/SIP adapter sends a SIP 200 OK answer to the SCF.
7) The SCF sends a SIP 200 OK message to the UE via the IM CN subsystem
including the SDP answer to initiate the FLUTE-based MBMS download session.
8) The UE receives the MBMS download data using FLUTE.
### 15.8.2 Procedures at the UE
The UE shall support the procedures specified in TS 24 229 [7] for originating
sessions.
The UE shall tear down the PSS download session and initiate the MBMS download
service, by issuing a SIP Re-INVITE sent to the IM CN subsystem. An SDP offer
shall be included in the SIP Re-INVITE message to initiate the MBMS download
service. The content of the SIP Re-INVITE shall be as follows:
\- The Request-URI in the INVITE request shall be the well known PSI (Public
Service Identifier) of the MBMS Download Service.
\- The To header shall contain the same URI as in the Request-URI.
\- The From header shall indicate the public user identity of the user.
An SDP offer shall be included in the request. The SDP offer shall be done in
accordance with the parameters received during UE service selection procedure
and with media capabilities and required bandwidth available for the MBMS
download service. The SDP offer shall include the following elements:
\- An a=source-filter line to indicate the IP source address of the FLUTE
session.
\- An a=flute-tsi line to indicate Transport Session ID (TSI) of the FLUTE
session.
NOTE: The combination of the **TSI** and the **IP source address** identifies
the FLUTE session.
\- The m-line(s) shall be set to the media parameters retrieved via service
selection procedures for the requested MBMS download service.
\- The c-line(s) shall be set according to the multicast address retrieved via
service selection procedures for the requested MBMS download service.
The descriptions of above parameters conform to section 7.3 of 3GPP TS
26.346[11].
\- An a=mbms_download_service:ServiceId line to indicate the MBMS download
service which the UE intends to initiate.
Once the UE receives the SIP response, the UE shall examine the FLUTE session
parameters in the received SDP, and receive the MBMS download data
accordingly.
In case the FDT is unavailable, the UE shall get the FDT according to
fdt_address attribute in the SDP Answer. The FDT contains content description
information for the files delivered in the FLUTE session.
### 15.8.3 Procedures at the IM CN Subsystem
The IM CN subsystem shall forward the SIP Re-INVITE from the UE to the SCF.
Upon reception of the SIP 200 OK from the SCF, the IM CN subsystem shall
forward the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
The IM CN Subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
### 15.8.4 Procedures at the SCF
Upon receipt of SIP Re-INVITE request from the UE to switch from PSS download
to MBMS download, the SCF shall perform service authorization procedures to
check the service rights of requested MBMS download service according to the
user subscription information, See clause 10.4. If MBMS download service is
not available for the UE, the session modification shall be rejected and the
old PSS download session (along with the previous reserved resources) is
maintained.
The SCF shall examine the SDP parameters in the SDP offer.
\- It shall examine the a=mbms_download_service parameter. This parameter
contains the channel the UE intends to join. If the mbms_download_service
parameter does not point to a channel that the UE is allowed to join the SCF
shall not accept the offer and shall answer with a 403 error code.
\- It shall examine the c-line(s) to determine that it is a multicast session.
It may also check that it corresponds to the mbms_download_service parameter.
If not, the SCF shall answer with a 403 error code.
If the SDP parameters are examined successfully and MBMS download service is
available to the UE, the SCF acting as B2BUA shall perform the following:
\- The SCF shall initiate the FLUTE-based MBMS download session between the
BM-SC.UPF and UE. The SCF shall respond to the UE with a SIP 200 OK message
after successful handling of the SIP Re-INVITE message.
\- The SCF shall tear down the PSS download session by sending a SIP BYE
message to the HTTP/SIP adapter.
The SCF shall answer to the UE with a SIP 200 OK, indicating the SDP answer as

offer.
\- The source-filter and flute-tsi attributes shall be identical to ones
indicated in the SDP offer.
\- An a=fdt_address:uri to indicate the address of the File Delivery Table.
\- An a=repair-server-address:uri to indicate the address of the repair
server. In the case the file repair procedures are to be conducted over
broadcast/multicast delivery, the repair-server-address:uri should instead be
the URI of the Session Description (SDP file) of the broadcast/multicast
repair session.
\- An a=report-channel:SIP/HTTP line to indicate to the UE that the reception
report procedure should be performed by SIP or HTTP channel.
\- It shall include an a=recvonly attribute.
### 15.8.5 Procedures at the HTTP/SIP adapter
Upon receipt of a SIP BYE message from the SCF, the HTTP/SIP adapter shall
send a HTTP POST message to the HTTP Server.
Upon receipt of a HTTP 200 OK message from the HTTP server, the HTTP adapter
shall send a SIP 200 OK message to the SCF.
### 15.8.6 Procedures at the HTTP server

# 16 Inter UE Session Transfer
## 16.0 Introduction
Inter UE Session transfer (IUT) is used for the transfer or replication of an
ongoing PSS session from a transferor UE (UE-1) to a transferee UE (UE-2). IUT
includes the transfer of the session control as well as the media flows.
UE-1 and UE-2 are under the same user subscription and are served by the same
SCF.
Inter UE Session transfer follows the general Inter UE session transfer
procedures as defined in [40] and [41].
NOTE 1: Functionality of SCC AS [40] for Inter UE transfer can be implemented
by the SCF.
In the push mode, the session transfer is initiated by UE-1. In the pull mode,
the session transfer is initiated by UE-2.
## 16.1 Push mode
UE-1 is involved in an IMS session with the PSS server. The information flow
in Figure 34 shows the transfer of the session from UE-1 to UE-2. The grey
boxes refer to the session transfer procedures as defined in clause 15 of
[41].
{width="6.645138888888889in" height="6.803472222222222in"}
Figure 34: Inter UE session transfer (push mode)
Note: This sequence is simplified and does not e.g. show session progress
messages
1.-2. UE-1 is in a IMS controlled PSS session with PSS server receiving a
media stream.
3\. UE-1 may initiate nBookmark procedure according to clause 12.1.
NOTE: When a media session is replicated from UE-1 to UE-2, it may be needed
that the media presentation on the two UEs is synchronized for good user
quality of experience. In order to obtain synchronized playout with UE-2, UE-1
may include \"suggestedPresentationOffset\" in the bookmark.
\"suggestedPresentationOffset\" specifies an offset in time from the bookmark
created time to the bookmark presentation time at UE1.
4.-5. SIP REFER request initiating the inter UE transfer to UE-2 is sent from
UE-1 to SCC
The SIP REFER request shall follow the procedures in [41] section 15.
> Additionally, the Refer-To header shall be extended by a To header field
> which includes the original content identifier copied from the Request URI
> of the original SIP INVITE request initiated from the transferor.
>
> Further a body header that contains the SDP body to be included in the PSS
> session initiation request initiated from the transferee UE. The SDP body
> shall contain the same number of media lines as the SDP used in the original
> PSS session from the transferor. Each media line shall indicate the same
> media type as its corresponding media component in the SDP used in the
> original session by the transferor UE.
>
> The body of the REFER request shall include the bookmark as defined in Annex
> J.
>
> If step 3 is carried out, the bookmark may be not present. In this case, an
> identifier of the stored bookmark is included.
NOTE: Before initiation of IUT, UE 1 may discover UE-2, e.g. by presence
service, which is out of scope of TS 26.237.
6\. The SCC authorizes the request and if authorization is passed
successfully, the SCC forwards the SIP REFER request further.
7.-8. SIP REFER request (SCC to UE-2).
9.-12. SIP 202 response to the SIP REFER request (UE-2 to UE-1).
13\. PSS session initiation using the bookmark according to clause 12.2.2.
NOTE: In order to obtain synchronized media playout with UE-1, when the media
session is replicated on UE-2, at time _T_ (in the wall-clock time), UE-2 may
present the media unit with an offset equal to _T -- bookmarkcreated time +
bookmark offset - suggestedPresentationOffset_ from the beginning of the
program.
14\. UE-2 is in an IMS controlled PSS session with PSS server.
The media path is now established between UE-2 and PSS server and the IMS
service control between UE-2 and SCC AS.
15.-18. SIP NOTIFY request (UE-2 to UE-1 over **intermediate** IM CN subsystem
entities and SCC).
The UE-2 generates the SIP NOTIFY request carrying the message/sipfrag body
and sends it towards UE-1.
> 19.-22. SIP 200 OK response to the SIP NOTIFY request (UE-1 to UE-2 over
> **intermediate** IM CN subsystem entities and SCC).
23\. In case of session transfer, a PSS session teardown between UE-1 and PSS
server according to clause 8.2.6.1.1 is executed. In case of session
replication, no PSS session teardown between UE-1 and PSS server is executed.
The streaming session between UE-1 and PSS server should be still ongoing.
## 16.2 Pull mode
UE-1 is involved in an IMS session with the PSS server. The information flow
in Figure X shows the transfer of the session from UE-1 to UE-2. The grey
boxes refer to the session transfer procedures as defined in sub-clause 27.2
of [41].

NOTE: This sequence is simplified and does not e.g. show session progress
messages
1.-2. UE-1 is in a IMS controlled PSS session with PSS server receiving a
media stream.
3\. UE-2 discovers the sessions of UE-1 as defined in clause 21 of [41].
4.-7. SIP REFER request (UE-2 to UE-1)
The UE-2 sends SIP REFER request to UE-1 to request a bookmark.
8.-11. SIP 202 (Accepted) response for the SIP REFER request (UE-1 to UE-2)

# 17 Parental Control Service
Parental Control provides parents the method to help protect their children
and set restrictions while consuming PSS/MBMS user services. During PSS/MBMS
Session initialization, Preventive Parental Control is executed either based
on the user\'s (child\'s) profile and the minimum allowed age for the content,
as specified in section 17.1. The parents can also temporarily block or allow
a program for his/her child, as specified in section 17.2, referred as
Interactive Parental Control.
The user\'s profile contains the user\'s age and the parents\' parental
control policy. The parental control policy includes allowed program list
(white list) and forbidden program list (black list). The minimum allowed age
for the content is the minimum age of the user who is allowed to watch the
said content. The minimum allowed age is signalled in the service selection
information by various content rating schemas.

Figure 36: Interactive Parental Control Service--Blocking
1 The Parent UE retrieves information about the content which is being watched
by Child UE. This is achieved by the procedure defined in section 11, Blending
of Presence and PSS/MBMS user services.
2 When the parent identifies that the watched content is not suitable for the
child, the Parent UE issue a SIP MESSAGE to SCF, including necessary
information (content identity, identities of parent and child).
3 The SCF feedback with 200 OK.
4 The SCF validates the parental control request. If the request is valid, the
SCF then update the controlled use\'s profile
5 If the request is valid, the SCF initiates the PSS/MBMS streaming session
teardown procedure.
#### **17.2.1.2 Procedure at Parent UE**
When the parent wants to block the program the child is watching, the UE of
the parent shall issue a SIP MESSAGE request for Parental Control. The content

NOTE 1: This sequence is simplified and does not e.g. show session progress
messages and the ACK message from the UE in response to the reception of 200
OK.
NOTE 2: SIP messages between PSS adapter and SCF go through the IM CN
Subsystem even if not indicated on the sequences.
## 18.2 Procedures at the UE
The UE shall perform PSS session initialization as per procedure defined in
sub-clause 8.2.3.2 and playback control as defined in sub-clause 8.2.4.2.
When receiving a SIP INFO message, within a PSS service, the UE shall identify
it contains forced playout constraints policy by checking whether the content-
type in the message header. Following that, the UE shall then extract the
policy from the SIP message body and store it.
During the playback of the PSS service, the UE should not issue any RTSP
request message when it is not supported as indicated in the policy document.
## 18.3 Procedures at the IM CN Subsystem
The IM CN Subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
## 18.4 Procedures at the SCF
The SCF shall perform PSS session initialization as per procedure defined in
sub-clause 8.2.3.4.
To support Forced Playout Constraints, the following shall apply:
\- The SCF shall acquire information about the playout constraints policy from
the content provider. This information shall include the start and end time of
controlled content and a list of RTSP operations that are to be controlled.
The SCF then uses this information to generate the Policy. When a user
requests to consume the content, the SCF shall check the user\'s service
rights and based upon this shall decide whether to issue the policy or not.
\- Once receiving a SIP 200 OK response from PSS Adapter, the SCF shall check
whether it has a forced playout constraints policy applicable to the selected
content. If yes, the SCF shall save the response and :
\- Issue a SIP INFO message contains the policy to the PSS Adapter selected

# 19 3GP-DASH (Dynamic and Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) service
## 19.1 Session initiation and QoS reservation
### 19.1.1 General description
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="3.946527777777778in"}
Figure 40: IMS based session initiation and QoS reservation for 3GP-DASH
1) HTTP streaming has started by fetching media segments from the HTTP server
after obtaining the MPD
2) The UE initiates the streaming session by sending SIP INVITE to the IM CN
subsystem, including an SDP offer.
3) The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP INVITE message to the SCF.
4) The SCF selects a HTTP/SIP adapter, and forwards the SIP INVITE message to
the HTTP/SIP adapter.
5) The HTTP/SIP adapter sends the SIP 200 OK answer to the SCF with the SDP
answer.
6) The SCF forwards the SIP 200 OK to the IM CN subsystem. The IM CN subsystem
interacts with the PCRF to commit the QoS reservation, and then forwards the
SIP 200 OK to the UE
7) The IM CN subsystem forwards the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
Afterwards, media segments are delivered to the UE using the reserved QoS.
### 19.1.2 Procedures at the UE
The UE initiates the HTTP streaming session by sending SIP INVITE to the IM CN
subsystem. The content of the SIP INVITE shall be as follows:
\- The Request URI is related to the session the user wants to activate. The
Request-URI shall be composed of a user and domain part as defined as follows:
\- The user part contains the content identifier, retrieved from user service
description information from SSF
\- The domain part is the Service Provider domain name, obtained from SSF.
\- The To header shall contain the same URI as in the Request URI.
\- The From header shall indicate the public user identity of the user.
The content identifier shall be retrieved from service selection information.
The other headers shall be set according to 24.229 [7].
An SDP offer shall be included in the initial INVITE request, in accordance
with media capabilities and policies available for the HTTP streaming session
and with the parameters received from the SSF during service selection
procedure or during the procedure for retrieving missing parameters by SIP
OPTIONS or by MPD analysis.
The SDP media parameters should describe the HTTP streaming session. The
differences with the SDP offer defined for RTP streaming is the absence of
media line corresponding to the control protocol (RTSP), and the indication of
TCP transport and HTTP download method instead of streaming in \"m\" line.
The SDP parameters for the HTTP download channel shall be set as follows:
\- a \'m\' line for an HTTP download channel of format: m=\ \
\ \
\- The media field shall have a value of \"application\".
\- The port field shall be set to a value of 9, which is the discard port. See
RFC 4145 [13] and RFC 4572 [14].
\- The transport field shall be set to TCP or TCP/TLS. The former is used when
HTTP runs directly on top of TCP and the latter is used when HTTP runs on top
of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP.
\- The \ parameter shall be included and shall be set to _3gpp_http._
NOTE: the _3gpp_http_ application format should have a new MIME subtype
registered in IANA.
\- An \"a=setup\" attribute shall be present and set to \"active\" indicating
that the UE will initiate an outgoing TCP connection to the HTTP Server.
\- An \"a= connection\" attribute shall be present and set as \"existing\".
\- A \"c\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN, the
address type set to IP4 or IP6 and IP address of the flow of the related HTTP
download channel (ex. c=IN IP4 \).
\- A \"b=\" line contains the proposed bandwidth. If the user has fetched the
bandwidth required for this particular content delivery channel by MPD
analysis, the bandwidth attribute at media level shall be set to this value.
Otherwise, this attribute shall be set to a pre-configured value; (ex.
b=AS:15000)
An example of the SDP offer for IMS-based HTTP streaming is:
v=0
o=bob 2890844527 2890844527 IN IP4 192.0.2.2
s=HTTP Streaming Session
i=A HTTP Streaming session declared within the session description protocol
t=0 0
m=application 9 TCP 3gpp_http
a=connection:existing
a=setup:active
c= IN IP4 192.0.2.2
b=AS:15000
### 19.1.3 Procedures at the IM CN subsystem
The IM CN subsystem shall forward the SIP INVITE to the SCF.
Upon reception of the SIP 200 OK from the SCF, the IM CN subsystem forwards
the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
The IM CN Subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
QoS reservation is carried out according to clause 9.
### 19.1.4 Procedures at the SCF
Upon reception of the SIP INVITE from the UE, the SCF checks the user rights
for the requested content, identifies that the request is for HTTP streaming,
selects and forwards the SIP request to the HTTP/SIP adapter which is in
charge of the HTTP streaming service by changing the \"Request-URI\"
accordingly.
When receiving a 301 or 302 response from the HTTP/SIP adapter, the SCF shall
not forward this message to the UE.
### 19.1.5 Procedures at the HTTP/SIP adapter
Upon reception of the HTTP streaming session initiation request, the HTTP/SIP
adapter shall examine the content identifier present in the user-part of the
To header and the media parameters in the SDP and selects a HTTP Server
according to the Request URI.
The HTTP/SIP adapter may decide to redirect the request to another HTTP/SIP
adapter server. In this case the HTTP/SIP adapter shall return a 301 response
if the content is not managed by this HTTP/SIP adapter or 302 response for any
other reasons (e.g. load balancing). The redirecting HTTP/SIP adapter
indicates one or more destination HTTP/SIP adapter addresses in the Contact
header.
The HTTP/SIP adapter returns the SIP 200 OK message to the SCF, including the
SDP answer. The SDP answer should describe the HTTP streaming session. The
differences with the SDP answer defined for RTP streaming is the absence of
media line corresponding to the control protocol (RTSP), the indication of TCP
transport and HTTP download method instead of streaming in \"m\" line.
If the content that the user has selected cannot be found the HTTP/SIP adapter
shall reply with appropriate, SIP error code 404 Not Found response.
The HTTP/SIP adapter shall construct the SIP 200 OK message as follows:
\- an \'m\' line for an HTTP streaming channel of format: m=\ \
\ \
\- The media field shall have a value of \"application\".
\- The port field shall be set to the value of HTTP Server for the HTTP
streaming channel, such as 80.
\- The transport field shall be set to TCP or TCP/TLS. The former is used when
HTTP runs directly on top of TCP and the latter is used when HTTP runs on top
of TLS, which in turn runs on top of TCP.
\- The fmt field shall be identical to the one received in the SDP offer.
\- a \"c\" line shall include the network type with the value set to IN, the
address type set to IP4 or IP6 and IP address of HTTP server for the flow of
the related HTTP download channel (e.g. c=IN IP4 \).
\- The \"a=setup\" attribute shall be present and set to \'passive\'
indicating that connection shall be initiated by the other endpoint (UE).
\- An \"a= connection\" attribute shall be present and set as \"existing\".
\- the \"b=\" line shall contain the proposed bandwidth. Since the content
download is unidirectional the bandwidth shall be set to 0.(ex. b=AS:0).
An example of the SDP answer in the SIP 200 OK response is:
v=0
o=bob 2890844527 2890844527 IN IP4 192.0.2.1
s=Download Session
i=A download session declared within the session description protocol
t=0 0
m=application 80 TCP 3gpp_http
a=connection:existing
a=setup:passive
c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
b=AS:0
### 19.1.6 Procedures at the HTTP server
Upon reception of the HTTP GET message received from the UE, the HTTP server
shall deliver the requested media segments.
## 19.2 MPD Update
### 19.2.1 General description
A SIP event frame work is used in order to inform the UE about a MPD update.
This avoids direct polling of the HTTP server by the UE and reduces the
signalling overhead.
{width="6.690972222222222in" height="3.9138888888888888in"}

7) The HTTP/SIP adapter detects an updated MPD e.g by polling towards the HTTP
server and recognizing a change of the MPD
8) The HTTP/SIP adapter sends a SIP NOTIFY message including the updated MPD
to the SCF.
9) The SCF forwards the SIP NOTIFY message to the IM CN subsystem.
10) The IM CN subsystem forwards the message to the UE.
11) The UE sends a SIP 200 OK to the IM CN subsystem.
12) The IM CN subsystem forwards the response to the SCF.
13) The SCF forwards the SIP 200 OK to the HTTP/SIP adapter.
14) Adaptive HTTP streaming is continued by fetching media segments as
described in the updated MPD.
### 19.2.2 Procedures at the UE
19.2.2.1 Subscription
When the UE intends to retrieve MPD Update information from the SDF, it shall
generate a SUBSCRIBE request for the \"MPD-Update\" event package.
The contents of the SUBSCRIBE request shall be as follows:
\- The value of the Request-URI shall be set to one of following:
\- - the PSI of the SCF; or
\- - the public user identity of the end user (when the UE does not know the
PSI of the SCF).
\- The From and To header shall be set to the public user identity of the
user.
\- The Event header shall be set to the \"MPD-Update\" event package.
\- The message body shall include the MPD URL.
A UE that doesn\'t subscribe for MPD updates may still get new MPD by regular
MPD update procedures as specified in TS 26.247.
19.2.2.2 Receiving Notifications
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription, the application within the UE shall extract the MPD contained in
the message body.
In case the UE does not understand the NOTIFY request or detects errors in the
MPD, the UE shall return a 400 Bad Request to the NOTIFY request. In addition,
the UE should behave in the same way as if erroneous MPD is received directly
from the HTTP server.
Otherwise, the UE shall return a 200 OK response to the NOTIFY request.
### 19.2.3 Procedures at the IM CN subsystem
The IM CN subsystem shall forward the SIP SUBSCRIBE to the SCF.
Upon reception of the SIP 200 OK from the SCF, the IM CN subsystem forwards
the SIP 200 OK to the UE.
The IM CN subsystem shall forward the SIP NOTIFY to the UE.
Upon reception of the SIP 200 OK from the UE, the IM CN subsystem forwards the
SIP 200 OK to the SCF.
The IM CN Subsystem handles the SIP dialog as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6].
### 19.2.4 Procedures at the SCF
Upon reception of the SIP SUBSCRIBE from the UE, the SCF identifies that the
request is for HTTP streaming, selects and forwards the SIP request to the
HTTP/SIP adapter which is in charge of the HTTP streaming service by changing
the \"Request-URI\" accordingly.
When receiving a 301 or 302 response from the HTTP/SIP adapter, the SCF shall
not forward this message to the UE.
### 19.2.5 Procedures at the HTTP/SIP adapter
When the HTTP/SIP adapter receives a SUBSCRIBE request, it shall examine the
parameters specified in the SIP SUBSCRIBE body and extract the MPD URL.
The HTTP/SIP adapter shall generate a SIP 200 OK in response to the SUBSCRIBE
request.
The HTTP/SIP adapter shall be able to detect an updated MPD at the HTTP server
and to download it. The exact procedure for MPD update detection is out of
scope of this specification.
NOTE1: MPD update detection may be done by the following procedures: the
HTTP/SIP adapter may send a HTTP GET message to the HTTP server requesting the
MPD. Upon reception of the HTTP 200 OK the HTTP/SIP adapter may store the
received MPD. The newly received MPD is compared with previously received and
stored MPD. In case of a difference between these two MPD files, an MPD update
is detected. The HTTP \"Connection\" header shall be set to \"Keep-Alive\" to
indicate it is a persistent TCP connection.
NOTE2: In order to avoid the complete download of the MPD at each request
HTTP, conditional GET including an If-Modified-Since header field may be used.
In case of a detected MPD update a SIP NOTIFY message is sent to the SCF. The
contents of the NOTIFY request shall be as follows:
\- The Event header shall be set to the \"MPD-Update\" event package.
\- The content type shall be set to \"video/vnd.3gpp.mpd\".
\- The message body shall contain the updated MPD.
In case of receiving a 400 Bad Request status code after sending the SIP
NOTIFY message, the HTTP/SIP adapter shall repeat the MPD update detection
procedure.
### 19.2.6 Procedures at the HTTP server
Procedures for MPD update detection at the server depend on the selected
method. The exact procedure for MPD update detection is out of scope of this
specification.
NOTE: In case of HTTP polling from the HTTP/SIP adapter and upon reception of
the HTTP GET received from the HTTP/SIP adapter, the HTTP server delivers in
the HTTP response the MPD file corresponding to the URL obtained in the
received HTTP GET. The HTTP \"Connection\" header is set to \"Keep-Alive\" to
indicate it is a persistent TCP connection.
Upon reception of the HTTP GET message received from the UE, the HTTP server
shall deliver the requested media segments.

# 20 Network PVR
## **20.1 NPVR Recording procedure**
### **20.1.1 General Description**
Network-PVR (NPVR) is a function for a user to record program(s) in the
network side for future accessing and consuming.
Figure 45: NPVR
The following is a description of the interactions in the flow:
1\. The UE, on behalf of the user, issues a request to record a live program.
The program can be either currently broadcasting program (instant recording)
or a future program (scheduled recording). The record request includes the
relevant information like program identifier, timing information, etc
2-3. Receiving the record request, the SCF first checks whether the program is
recordable and whether the user has the right to record it. If fine, the SCF
further checks whether the user has enough storage space. Following that, the
SCF creates a context for the record request, and update the user\'s profile
with the record status \"record request captured\".
4-5. The SCF responses to the user, notifying the acceptance of the record
request.
6-7. For instant recording, the SCF starts the recording by selecting a proper
PSS Adapter, and directing it to set up a delivery channel with a content
source to receive content. The PSS service initialization procedure as defined
in section 8.2.3 shall be used.
For scheduled recording, the SCF creates a timer for the request. When the
start time comes, the SCF directs and controls the Recording server for
recording as the case for instant recording.
Notes: Upon reception of more than one NPVR request for the same program, the
SCF, based on local policy, may issue only one record request to Recording
server. In this case, the SCF will update each of the requestor\'s user
profile when recording status changes.
8\. Once the NPVR request is started, the SCF will then update all the
requestors\' user profile with the recording status \"recording started\".
9-12. The PSS Adapter for NPVR setup and starts the recording according NPVR
request; The Recording server retrieves the streamed content for live
streaming service and records the content properly.
13-14. When recording completed, the Recording server send RTSP ANNOUNCE
message to the PSS Adapter;
Note: the Recording server may deliver the recorded content to a PSS Server
for serving any NPVR retrieve, or store the content in itself and acting as
PSS Server later. How to deliver the recorded content to another PSS server is
out of scope of the present document.
15-16. The PSS Adapter send SIP UPDATE to SCF to indicate the ending of NPVR
recording;
17-20. The SCF teardown the SIP session and the PSS Adapter teardowns the RTSP
session for NPVR recording.
21\. Once the NPVR request is completed, the SCF will then update all the
requestors\' user profile with the recording status \"recording completed\".
### **20.1.2 Procedures at UE**
When UE initiates the request for NPVR Request, the UE shall issue a SIP
MESSAGE according to TS 24.229 [7] with the following additions:
\- The Request-URI shall be composed of a user and domain part as defined as
follows:
\- The user part shall be \"PSS_PVR_\\" wherein content-id shall
be globalContentID of the content to be recorded.
\- The domain part is the Service Provider domain name, obtained from SSF.
\- The Content-Type of the message body shall be set to \"application/3gpp-
ims-pss-mbms-npvr+xml\"
\- The message body shall include XML document as defined in Annex N.
\- The NPVRRequest shall be present;
\- ProgramID : if present, identifies the content to be recorded; when occurs,
shall be globalContentID retrieved from User Service Description
\- ServiceID: identifies live channel to be recorded; it shall be
globalServiceID retrieved from User Service Description
\- RecordStartTime: indicates the time to start recording, where \"0\" or time
before now implies instant recording, while other time implies scheduled
recording;
\- RecordDuration: indicates the time duration of the recording;
Upon receiving a SIP MESSAGE, the UE shall identify it as a NPVR response by
comparing the content type of the message body with \"application/3gpp-ims-
pss-mbms-npvr+xml\". Following that, the UE shall response with 200 OK
response.
### **20.1.3 Procedures at SCF**
The SCF shall support the procedures specified in [TS124503] as applicable to
an AS acting as a terminating SIP UA.
When receiving any NPVR request, the SCF shall first response with 200 OK, and
then examine the request to see:
\- If the user subscribed to the PVR service.
\- If the program is allowed to recorded.
\- If it is compatible with the user\'s profile (e.g. parental control level).
\- If the new item to be recorded doesn\'t exceed the user\'s storage quota,
by checking the user\'s profile.
The SCF shall then construct a SIP MESSAGE request towards the UE with the
NPVR response. The content of the message shall be as follows:
\- The Request-URI shall be set to the IMPU of the user.
\- The Content-Type of the message body shall be set to \"application/3gpp-
ims-pss-mbms-npvr+xml\"
\- The message body shall include XML document as defined in Annex N.
\- The NPVRResponse shall be present;
\- Result: indicate the status of the NPVR request, i.e. Error or request
accepted.
Following that, the SCF shall create a context for the request, register
relevant information and update the user profile for that user, with the
status for PVR changing to \"Recording Captured\", meaning that a NPVR request
is pending execution.
For instant recording, the SCF starts the recording immediately by selecting a
proper Recording Server, and sending a SIP INVITE message to the PSS Adapter
to initialize a Recording Session.
For scheduled recording, the SCF creates a timer for the request. When the
start time comes, the SCF starts the recording immediately by selecting a
proper Recording Server, and sending a SIP INVITE message to the PSS Adapter
to initialize a Recording Session.
Based on the local policy, the following should apply to avoid duplicated
recording:
\- Upon receiving a scheduled recording request, the SCF check whether the
same program (identified by ServiceID and ProgramID) has been requested to
record. If yes, the SCF shall not issue another NPVR request for the same
content.
\- Upon receiving an instant recording request, the SCF examines the status of
the program. If the same program (identified by ServiceID and ProgramID) is
already under recording, the SCF shall not issue another NPVR request for the
same content.
When starting the recording, the SCF shall build the SIP INVITE message as
follows:
\- The Request-URI in the INVITE request shall be the IMPU of the selected
Recording server
\- The To header shall contain the same URI as in the Request-URI.
\- The From header shall be set to \"PSS_PVR_\\@domain name\",
wherein content-id shall be globalContentID of the content to be recorded;
A NPVR request XML document and an SDP offer shall be included in the request
body. The SDP offer shall be done in accordance with the parameters signalled
in service selected information. The SDP offer at media level shall include
the following elements:
\- The m-line(s) shall be set to the media parameters retrieved via service
selection procedures for the requested service.
\- The c-line(s) shall be set according to the IP address retrieved via
service selection procedures for the requested service.
Upon receiving the SIP UPDATE message from the PSS Adapter for NPVR, the SCF
shall extract the NPVR recording result from the message and update the user
profile of all the users who requested to record the content. Following that
the SCF shall teardown the session by initiating a SIP BYE to the PSS Adapter.
### **20.1.4 Procedures at PSS Adapter**
The PSS Adapter for NPVR shall support the following RTSP methods for NPVR
session establishment and teardown control:
\- SETUP (PSS Adapter to Recording server).
\- RECORD (PSS Adapter to Recording server).
\- ANNOUNCE (Recording server to PSS Adapter).
\- TEARDOWN (PSS Adapter to Recording server).
Upon receipt of a SIP INVITE message, the PSS Adapter shall identify it as a
NPVR request by the From header, and then performs the following actions:
\- It shall resolve the RTSP URI based on the Request-URI, the SDP parameters
and the selected Recording server.
\- It shall construct and send the RTSP SETUP message(s) to setup the relevant
media streams.
\- Return the answer SDP to the SCF in the SIP 200 OK.
The PSS Adapter shall construct the RTSP SETUP message according to the SIP
INVITE as follows:
The Request-Line shall be present of format: Request-Line = Method SP Request-
URI SP RTSP-Version CRLF:
\- Method field is set to SETUP;
\- RTSP-Version field to be set of RTSP/1.0.
The CSeq header field is set to a value allocated by PSS Adapter according to
RFC 2326 [25]
The transport header field:
\- the protocol and profile sub-fields together are set to a value of the
protocol sub-field of the corresponding \"m=\" line in the SDP offer,
\- the unicast \| multicast parameter is set according to the \"c=\" line.
\- The destination parameter is set to a value of the \"c=\" line in the SDP
offer,
\- The RTP port value is set to the value of the port sub-field of the
corresponding \"m=\" line in the SDP offer, and the RTCP port value is set to
a value of the RTP port value plus 1.
The PSS Adapter may send multiple RTSP SETUP messages if multiple media
delivery channels are carried within the SDP offer. In this case, the pipeline
of multiple RTSP SETUP messages may be supported.
When receiving a RTSP 200 OK response from the Recording server, the PSS
Adapter parses the response, constructs a SIP 200 OK response with the final
SDP, and sends the SIP 200 OK response to the SCF.
Following that, the PSS Adapter shall further send RTSP RECORD message to the
Recording server to start the recording. In the message the range header shall
be set according to the time duration of the NPVR request.
Upon receiving the RTSP ANNOUNCE with NPVR result, the PSS Adapter shall
initiate a SIP UPDATE message to the SCF. The content of the SIP UPDATE
message shall be as following:
\- The Request-Line shall be set to \"PSS_PVR_\\@domain name\",
wherein content-id shall be globalContentID of the content to be recorded
\- The To header shall contain the same URI as in the Request-URI.
\- The From header shall be set to the IMPU of the selected Recording server;
\- The body shall contain the XML document received from the Recording server,
with necessary information (i.e. ProgramID, ServiceID, etc.) added;
Upon receiving SIP BYE message from the SCF, the PSS Adapter shall respond
with a 200 OK and send a RTSP TEARDOWN message to the Recording server.
### **20.1.5 Procedures at Recording server**
The Recording server shall conform toRFC 2326 [25].
Upon receiving a RTSP SETUP request, the Recording server shall validate the
request and setup content delivery channel(s) according to the SDP.
Upon receiving the RTSP RECORD request, the Recording server shall start to
record the media properly according to the time in range header.
When finishing the recording, the Recording server shall issue a RTSP ANNOUNCE
message to the PSS Adapter to report the record result. Within the message
body, the Recording server shall include a XML body associated with the appid
\"urn:3gpp:npvr:2010:IMS-PSS-MBMS\". In the XML document, the NPVRResponse
shall be present and the parameters shall be set:
\- Result: the result of the recording (i.e. Completed, Error).
\- AccessURL: the identifier reference to the recorded content, for UE to
request later.
Upon receiving the RTSP TEARDOWN message, the Recording server shall teardown
the PSS Recording Session according to RFC 2326.
## **20.2 NPVR Retrieving**
### **20.2.1 Procedures at UE**
After the recording is finished, the UE can get the AccessURL as identifier of
the recorded content by checking the user profile.
To consume the recorded content, the UE shall perform PSS session
initialization procedure as defined in sub-clause 8.2.3.2, with the following
additions:
\- The Request-URI shall be \"PSS_COD_\\", where the content-id
shall be set to the AccessURL.
### **20.2.2 Procedures at SCF**
The SCF shall perform the procedure as defined in sub-clause 8.2.3.3.
### **20.2.3 Procedures at PSS Adapter**
The PSS adapter shall perform the procedure as defined in sub-clause 8.2.3.4.

The PSS server shall perform the procedure as defined in sub-clause 8.2.3.5.
# 21 Content Referral Service (CRS)
Content referral service has two different scenarios, namely user initiated
content referral service and service provider initiated content referral
service. They are specified in sub-clauses 21.1 and 21.2, respectively.
## **21.1 User Initiated CRS**
### **21.1.1 General Description**
Content referral service enables a user to recommend a PSS or MBMS user
service to another user.
Following is a general call flow for user initiated content referral service
Figure 46: User initiated content referral service
1-2 The Initiated UE issues a content referral request through the IM CN
Subsystem to the SCF. The request carries the necessary parameters indicating
the type of the recommended service, (e.g. PSS, MBMS or HTTP Streaming
service), content identifier, identifier of target UE.
3 The SCF performs service authorization, to check:
\- If the initiated UE is allowed to perform content referral service;
\- If the target UE/User accepts content referral service from the initiated
UE;
\- Following that, the SCF forwards content referral service request through
the IM CN Subsystem to the target UE. And the user of target UE may deny the
request even if the SCF authorized.
4 The target UE sends a proper response to the initiated UE.
5 The target UE issues a SIP NOTIFY to the initiated UE through the IM CN
Subsystem, indicating the session initialization of the recommended service is
about to start.
6\. The initiated UE response with 200 OK.
7 The target UE initiates the service indicated in the content referral
service request, e.g.
\- PSS session initiation as per the procedures defined in clause 8.2.3, or
\- MBMS session initiation as per the procedures defined in clause 8.3.3
8 The target UE issues a SIP NOTIFY to the initiated UE, indicating the
session initialization of the recommended service is done.
9\. The initiated UE response with 200 OK.
### **21.1.2 Procedure at Initiated UE**
When the initiated UE wants to recommend a PSS or MBMS user service to the
target UE, the initiated UE shall issue a SIP REFER request to target UE as
defined in [43], and the REFER message is routed to SCF. The content of the
SIP REFER request shall be as follows:
\- The Request-URI in the REFER request shall be set to the IMPU of the target
UE;
\- From shall be set to the IMPU of the initiated UE;
\- To headers shall be set to the public GRUU or the IMPU of the target UE;
\- Refer-To shall include the following parameters:
\- the SIP URI shall be set to:
\- \"PSS_COD_\@\\" for CoD service, wherein content-
id shall be globalContentID defined in [27].
\- the well known PSI (Public Service Identifier) for live service, i.e. Live
Stream@\.
\- the \"method\" shall be set to \"INVITE\".
\- Content-Type: shall be set to \"application/3gpp-ims-pss-mbms-
bookmark+xml\", if the message body contains a bookmark.
\- The message body may contain a bookmark as defined in annex J, to indicate
the recommended start time of the recommended service.
When receives the NOTIFY message, the initiated UE shall send a 200 OK to the
target UE.
### **21.1.3 Procedure at SCF**
Upon receiving a SIP REFER request, the SCF shall check:
\- If the initiated UE is allowed to perform content referral service;
\- If the target UE/User accepts content referral service from the initiated
UE, which is set beforehand;
If the request is authorized, the SCF then forwards the request to the target
UE.
### **21.1.4 Procedure at Target UE**
When receiving a SIP REFER request, the target UE shall check whether or not
it is capable of initiating the indicated PSS or MBMS user service, if the
target UE is capable of initiating the service, the target UE shall send a 202
message immediately, and the 202 message shall be the same as the received
REFER request except the \"contact\" head field:
\- Contact shall be set to the IMPU of the target UE;
Then the target UE shall send an immediate NOTIFY message as defined in [43],
to initiated UE for informing the status. The NOTIFY message shall be set as
follows:
\- From shall be set to the IMPU of the target UE;
\- To headers shall be set to IMPU of the initiated UE;
\- Content-Type shall be set to \"message/sipfrag\";
\- Event shall be set to \"refer\";
\- Subscription-State shall be set to \"active\";
When the target UE have sent the NOTIFY message, it shall initiate the PSS or
MBMS service initialization according to the \"Refer-To\" message header of
the REFER. If the REFER request further contains a bookmark, the target UE
shall start the consumption of the service at the time point indicated in the
bookmark.
After completion of the service initiation, it shall send another NOTIFY
message to initiated UE, and the \"Subscription-State\" of such NOTIFY message
shall be set to \"terminated\".
## **21.2 Service Provider Initiated CRS**
### **21.2.1 General Description**
The service provider initiated CRS service procedures include 3 major steps:
1) CRS event detection. This step is triggered according to service
provider\'s policy or user profile. The events may include new content arrival
referral, presence update, request from the UE, channel change report from UE
etc.
2) CRS information generation for specific user according to the preconfigured
content referral policy. The CRS info includes one or more content identifiers
(Annex O), identifying the recommended content. The user profile (e.g. user
preference, watching habits etc) is used for filtering/sorting of CRS info.
3) CRS information delivery to the UE. SCF sends SIP MESSAGE containing the
generated CRS information to the UE.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="3.254861111111111in"}
Figure 47: Procedure for CRS provided by SCF
### **21.2.2 Procedure at Initiated UE**
Upon reception of a SIP MESSAGE request, the UE shall identify it as a content
referral message by comparing the Content-Type header with \"application/3gpp-
ims-pss-mbms-contentreferral+xml\". Following that, the UE shall parse the XML
document according to the schema defined in Annex O, and then take appropriate
further action, e.g. initiate a PSS session as defined in sub-clause 8.2.3.2
### **21.2.3 Procedure at SCF**
Upon detection of a CRS event for a user, the SCF shall generate a SIP MESSAGE
request and send it to the target UE via IM CN Subsystem
The contents of the above SIP MESSAGE request shall be as follows:
\- The Request-URI of the SIP MESSAGE request shall be set to the IMPU of the
target UE.
\- The From header shall be set to the SIP URI of the SCF.
\- The To header shall be set to the IMPU of the target UE.
\- The Content-Type header shall be set to \"application/3gpp-ims-pss-mbms-
contentreferral+xml\".
\- The message body shall carry an XML document conforming to the XML schema
defined in annex Y:
\- ContentIdentifier shall be set to the content identifier related to the
referral, if present;
\- ReferralSender shall be set to the identifier of the originator who
provides the referral, if present;
\- ReferralReceiver shall be set to the identifier of target UE, if present.
\- ContentReferralInfo shall be set to the information for content referral;
###### ## Annex A (normative): 3gpp_rtsp application
The 3gpp_rtsp application defines a set of RTSP parameters. An RTSP parameter
is included in \"a=fmtp\" line of the SDP and is expressed in the form of
parameter=value.
a=fmtp:3gpp_rtsp \=\
The \"version\" parameter sets the \"version-number\" representing the version
of RTSP that will be used in the RTSP media stream. The version number shall
be \"1.0\" in this version of the specification. The RTSP version shall be
included in all SDP offers and answers. The same version shall be used by all
entities.
a=fmtp:3gpp_rtsp version=\
To exchange RTSP header fields within the SIP offer/answer, the RTSP media
stream allows for attributes with the following format:
a=fmtp:3gpp_rtsp h-\=\,
where \"header-name\" is the name of the RTSP header field being described and
\"header-value\" is the value of the RTSP header field. The value of the
header-name is case insensitive. The value of the header-value is interpreted
according to the rules of RTSP. The list of authorized headers in the SIP

The following schema is the release 11 extension to the nBookmark schema. The
schema file name, as referenced in the main nBookmark schema, is 3gpp-
bookmark-2012.xsd.
\
\
\
\nBookmark2012\
\
This Schema is the Rel 11 extension to the nBookmark schema.
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The schemaVersion schema defines two elements, _schemaVersion_ and _delimiter_
for compatibility purpose. The value of the _schemaVersion_ is used in the
main nBookmark schemas above. The value of the _schemaVersion_ element and
_version_ attribute should be set to 2 in this release of the main nBookmark
schema and increased by 1 in every future releases where new element(s) or
attribute(s) are added.The _delimiter_ element is used in the main nBookmark
schema above to avoid the schema validation error (due to the Unique Particle
Attribution rule). The _delimiter_ element shall be set to a value of 0, and
the element content shall be ignored by the receiveing device. The file name
used for this schema is schema-version.xsd,
When a device receives an instantiation of the nBookmark compliant to this
schema, it determines the schema version required to parse the instantiation
as follows:
\- If the device supports one or more versions of the nBookmark schema with
the schema _version_ attribute, then it shall use the schema that has the
highest schema _version_ attribute value that is equal to or less than the
value in the received _schemaVersion_ element;
\
\
\
\
\

###### ## Annex Q (normative): Content Reporting Configuration Info Package
This annex contains the necessary information for the registration of Content
Reporting Configuration Info Package into IANA.
# Q.1 Overall Description
During service consumption (e.g. with a PSS/MBMS session), the centre server,
e.g. Server Control Function, may request to re-config the content report
behaviours. The configuration does not require user intervention
The Content Reporting Configuration Info Package is used to transport the
necessary configuration parameters regarding the content reporting function.
The Content Reporting Configuration Info Package is defined for any multimedia
application that using content reporting. Any application, where sending
content reporting configuration information, using the SIP INFO method is
required, can use the Content Reporting Configuration Info Package.
# Q.2 Applicability
The Info Package mechanism for transporting content reporting configuration
information has been chosen as an optional feature. The mechanism also allows
content reporting configuration information to be sent inside an existing
dialog, using the same signalling path as other SIP messages within the
dialog, rather than having to establish a separate dialog.
# Q.3 Info Package Name
The name of the Info Package is: **ContentReportConfig**.
# Q.4 Info Package Parameters
No parameters are defined for the **Content Reporting Configuration** Info
Package.
# Q.5 SIP Option Tags
No SIP option tags are defined for the **Content Reporting Configuration**
Info Package.
# Q.6 INFO Message Body Parts
## Q.6.1 General
Configuration information of Content Reporting function on a device is sent as
part of the message body of the SIP INFO request. This subclause defines the
information and syntax associated with the message body part used for
transporting the information.
## Q.6.2 SIP Content-Type header field value
The value of the SIP Content-Type header field associated with the **Content
Reporting Configuration** Info Package message body is:
application/3gpp-ims-pss-mbms-contentReportConfig+xml\"
## Q.6.3 SIP Content-Disposition header field value
The value of the SIP Content-Disposition header field associated with the
**Content Reporting Configuration** Info Package message body is: Info-
Package.
## Q.6.4 Message body syntax
