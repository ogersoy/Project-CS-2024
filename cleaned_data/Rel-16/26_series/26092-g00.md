# 4 General
A basic problem when using SCR is that the background acoustic noise, which is
transmitted together with the speech, would disappear when the transmission is
cut, resulting in discontinuities of the background noise. Since the SCR
switching can take place rapidly, it has been found that this effect can be
very annoying for the listener - especially in a car environment with high
background noise levels. In bad cases, the speech may be hardly intelligible.
This document specifies the way to overcome this problem by generating on the
receive (RX) side synthetic noise similar to the transmit (TX) side background
noise. The comfort noise parameters are estimated on the TX side and
transmitted to the RX side at a regular rate when speech is not present. This
allows the comfort noise to adapt to the changes of the noise on the TX side.
# 5 Functions on the transmit (TX) side
The comfort noise evaluation algorithm uses the following parameters of the
AMR speech encoder, defined in [2]:
\- the unquantized Linear Prediction (LP) parameters, using the Line Spectral
Pair (LSP) representation, where the unquantized Line Spectral Frequency (LSF)
vector is given by {width="1.25in" height="0.26319444444444445in"};
\- the unquantized LSF vector for the 12.2 kbit/s mode is given by the second
set of LSF parameters in the frame.
The algorithm computes the following parameters to assist in comfort noise
generation:
\- the averaged LSF parameter vector {width="0.34652777777777777in"
height="0.2076388888888889in"} (average of the LSF parameters of the eight
most recent frames);
\- the averaged logarithmic frame energy {width="0.4861111111111111in"
height="0.3055555555555556in"} (average of the logarithmic energy of the eight
most recent frames).
These parameters give information on the level ({width="0.4861111111111111in"
height="0.3055555555555556in"}) and the spectrum
({width="0.34652777777777777in" height="0.2076388888888889in"}) of the
background noise.
The evaluated comfort noise parameters ({width="0.34652777777777777in"
height="0.2076388888888889in"} and{width="0.4861111111111111in"
height="0.3055555555555556in"}) are encoded into a special frame, called a
Silence Descriptor (SID) frame for transmission to the RX side.
A hangover logic is used to enhance the quality of the silence descriptor
frames. A hangover of seven frames is added to the VAD flag so that the coder
waits with the switch from active to inactive mode for a period of seven
frames, during that time the decoder can compute a silence descriptor frame
from the quantized LSFs and the logarithmic frame energy of the decoded speech
signal. Therefore, no comfort noise description is transmitted in the first
SID frame after active speech. If the background noise contains transients
which will cause the coder to switch to active mode and then back to inactive
mode in a very short time period, no hangover is used. Instead the previously
used comfort noise frames are used for comfort noise generation.
The first SID frame also serves to initiate the comfort noise generation on
the receive side, as a first SID frame is always sent at the end of a speech
burst, i.e., before the transmission is terminated.
The scheduling of SID or speech frames on the network path is described in
[4].
## 5.1 LSF evaluation
The comfort noise parameters to be encoded into a SID frame are calculated
over {width="0.44375in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} consecutive frames
marked with VAD=0, as follows:
The averaged LSF parameter vector {width="0.6666666666666666in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"} of the frame _i_ shall be computed according to
the equation:
{width="1.5694444444444444in" height="0.4722222222222222in"} (1)
where {width="0.5555555555555556in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} is the
(unquantized) LSF parameter vector of the current frame _i_
({width="0.3888888888888889in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}) and past
frames ({width="0.7222222222222222in" height="0.19375in"}).
The averaged LSF parameter vector {width="0.5548611111111111in"
height="0.26319444444444445in"} of the frame _i_ is encoded using the same
encoding tables that are also used by the 7.4 kbit/s mode for the encoding of
the non-averaged LSF parameter vectors in ordinary speech encoding mode, but
the quantization algorithm is modified in order to support the quantization of
comfort noise.
The LSF parameter prediction residual to be quantized for frame _i_ is
obtained according to the following equation:
{width="1.3888888888888888in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} (2)
where {width="0.3194444444444444in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} is a
reference vector picked from a codebook.
The vector {width="0.2777777777777778in" height="0.2222222222222222in"} used
in eq (2) is encoded for each SID frame. A lookup table containing 8 vectors
typical for background noise are searched. The vector which yields the lowest
prediction residual energy is selected. After the above step the LSF parameter
encoding procedure is performed. The 3-bit index for the reference vector and
the 26 bits for LSF parameter are transmitted in the SID frame (see bit
allocation in table 1).
## 5.2 Frame energy calculation
The frame energy is computed for each frame marked with VAD=0 according to the
equation :
{width="2.0277777777777777in" height="0.5in"} (3)
where is the HP-filtered input speech signal of the current frame _i_.
The averaged logarithmic energy is computed by:
{width="1.94375in" height="0.5277777777777778in"}. (4)
The averaged logarithmic energy is quantized means of a 6 bit algorithmic
quantizer. The 6 bits for the energy index are transmitted in the SID frame
(see bit allocation in table 1).
## 5.3 Modification of the speech encoding algorithm during SID frame
generation
When the TX_TYPE is not equal to SPEECH the speech encoding algorithm is
modified in the following way:
\- The non-averaged LP parameters which are used to derive the filter
coefficients of the filters {width="0.38819444444444445in" height="0.25in"}
and {width="0.38819444444444445in" height="0.25in"} of the speech encoder are
not quantized;
\- The open loop pitch lag search is performed, but the closed loop pitch lag
search is inactivated. The adaptive codebook gain and memory is set to zero.
\- No fixed codebook search is made.
\- The memory of weighting filter {width="0.38819444444444445in"
height="0.25in"} is set to zero, i.e., the memory of
{width="0.38819444444444445in" height="0.25in"} is not updated.
\- The ordinary LP parameter quantization algorithm is inactive. The averaged
LSF parameter vector {width="0.40208333333333335in" height="0.25in"} is
calculated each time a new SID frame is to be sent to the AN. This parameter
vector is encoded into the SID frame as defined in subclause 5.1.
\- The ordinary gain quantization algorithm is inactive.
\- The predictor memories of the ordinary LP parameter quantization and fixed
codebook gain quantization algorithms are initialized when TX_TYPE is not
SPEECH, so that the quantizers start from known initial states when the speech
activity begins again.
## 5.4 SID-frame encoding
The encoding of the comfort noise bits in a SID frame is described in [5]
where the indication of the first SID frame is also described. The bit
allocation and sequence of the bits from comfort noise encoding is shown in
Table 1.
# 6 Functions on the receive (RX) side
The situations in which comfort noise shall be generated on the receive side
are defined in [4]. In general, the comfort noise generation is started or
updated whenever a valid SID frame is received.
## 6.1 Averaging and decoding of the LP and energy parameters
When speech frames are received by the decoder the LP and the energy
parameters of the last seven speech frames shall be kept in memory. The
decoder counts the number of frames elapsed since the last SID frame was
updated and passed to the RSS by the encoder. Based on this count, the decoder
determines whether or not there is a hangover period at the end of the speech
burst (defined in[4] ). The interpolation factor is also adapted to the SID
update rate.
As soon as a SID frame is received comfort noise is generated at the decoder
end. The first SID frame parameters are not received but computed from the
parameters stored during the hangover period. If no hangover period is
detected, the parameters from the previous SID update are used.
The averaging procedure for obtaining the comfort noise parameters for the
first SID frame is as follows:
\- when a speech frame is received, the LSF vector is decoded and stored in
memory, moreover the logarithmic frame energy of the decoded signal is also
stored in memory.
\- the averaged values of the quantized LSF vectors and the averaged
logarithmic frame energy of the decoded frames are computed and used for
comfort noise generation.
The averaged value of the LSF vector for the first SID frame is given by:
{width="1.4722222222222223in" height="0.4722222222222222in"} (5)
where {width="0.5277777777777778in" height="0.2638888888888889in"}, _n_ > 0 is
the quantized LSF vector of one of the frames of the hangover period and where
{width="0.5138888888888888in" height="0.2638888888888889in"}=
{width="0.4861111111111111in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} . The averaged
logarithmic frame energy for the first SID frame is given by:
{width="1.7916666666666667in" height="0.4722222222222222in"} (6)
where {width="0.7916666666666666in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} , _n_ > 0
is the logarithmic vector of one of the frames of the hangover period computed
for the decoded frames and where {width="0.7361111111111112in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} = {width="0.7083333333333334in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}.
For ordinary SID frames, the LSF vector and logarithmic frame energy are
computed by table lookup. The energy is also adjusted according to the
signalled speech modes capabilities, as to provide high quality transitions
from Comfort Noise to Speech. The LSF vector is given by the sum of the
decoded reference vector and the decoded LSF prediction residual.
During comfort noise generation the spectrum and energy of the comfort noise
is determined by interpolation between old and new SID frames.
In order to achieve a comfort noise that is less static in appearance the LSF
vector is slightly perturbed for each frame by adding a small component based
on parameters variations computed in the hangover period. The computation of
the perturbation is made by computing the mean LSF vector from the matrix
{width="0.125in" height="0.2222222222222222in"}, this mean vector is then
subtracted from each of the elements of {width="0.125in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}forming a new matrix {width="0.125in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}. For every frame a mean removed LSF vector is
randomly chosen from {width="0.125in" height="0.20833333333333334in"} and
added to the interpolated LSF vector.
## 6.2 Comfort noise generation and updating
The comfort noise generation procedure uses the adaptive multi-rate speech
decoder algorithm defined in [2].
When comfort noise is to be generated, the various encoded parameters are set
as follows:
In each subframe, the pulse positions and signs of the fixed codebook
excitation are locally generated using uniformly distributed pseudo random
numbers. The excitation pulses take values of +1 and ‑1 when comfort noise is
generated. The fixed codebook comfort noise excitation generation algorithm
works as follows:
