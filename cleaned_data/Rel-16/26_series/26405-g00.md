# 5 Parametric stereo encoder
## 5.1 System overview
{width="6.84375in" height="3.09375in"}
Figure 1: Encoder overview
The interface between the parametric stereo encoder tool and the aacPlus
encoder is depicted in Figure 1. In the figure L and R denotes the left and
right channel respectively, while M denotes the down-mixed mono signal which
the aacPlus encoder operates on.
The parametric stereo coding tool is able to capture the stereo image into a
limited number of parameters, requiring only a small overhead of a few kbit/s.
Together with a controlled monaural downmix of the stereo input signal, the
parametric stereo coding tool is able to regenerate the stereo signal at the
decoder side.
The encoder operates as a non-modifying analyzer prior to the aacPlus encoder,
though it shares the same QMF analysis filterbank. The decoder operates as a
post process to aacPlus using the Parametric Stereo data conveyed by the
bitstream to synthesize the stereo properties of the output signal. Part from
the parametric stereo tool, the aacPlus runs in mono mode not affected by
Parametric Stereo.
The bitstream syntax and decoder description of the parametric stereo tool in
combination with aacPlus is defined in [3]. This system includes only the
baseline level defined in that standard.
## 5.2 Analysis filterbank
### 5.2.1 QMF analysis filterbank
This filterbank is identical to the 64 complex QMF analysis filterbank as
defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3/AMD1:2003, sub clause 4.B.18.2 [1], [2]. However,
in the equation for matrix **M**(k,n) and in Figure 4.B.20, the term
\"(2*n+1)\" has to be substituted by \"(2*n-1)\". The input to the filterbank
are blocks of 64 samples of the monaural synthesized signal M. For each block
the filterbank outputs one slot of 64 QMF samples.
### 5.2.2 Low frequency filtering
The lower QMF subbands are further split in order to obtain a higher frequency
resolution enabling a proper stereo analysis and synthesis for the lower
frequencies. To achieve those, in total 77 frequency bands, a hybrid
filterbank configurations have been defined. The filter used for this sub
subband filtering, {width="0.2222222222222222in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} is defined according to:
{width="2.4027777777777777in" height="0.4722222222222222in"}
where represents the prototype filters in QMF subband p. represents the number
of sub-subbands in QMF subband p, q the sub-subband index in QMF channel p and
n the time index. The prototype filters are all of length 13 and have a delay
of 6 QMF samples. The prototype filters are listed in Table 1.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate the hybrid analysis and synthesis filterbank
for the 77 frequency bands configuration.

Figure 2: Hybrid QMF analysis filterbank providing 77 output bands. The three
lower subbands of the 64 QMF (see dashed box) are further split to provide for
increased resolution for the lower frequencies
{width="4.1305555555555555in" height="3.6881944444444446in"}
Figure 3: Hybrid QMF synthesis filterbank using 77 input bands. The
coefficients offering higher resolution for the lower QMF subbands are simply
added prior to the synthesis with the 64 subbands QMF (see dashed box)
In order to time align all the samples originating from the hybrid filterbank,
the remaining QMF subbands that have not been filtered are delay compensated.
This delay amounts to 6 QMF subband samples. This means
{width="0.7638888888888888in" height="0.25in"} for k=3...63. In order to
compensate for the overall delay of the hybrid analysis filterbank, the first
10 sets (6 from delay and 4 from QMF filter) of hybrid subbands are flushed
and therefore not taken into account for processing.
The resultant of this operation is a slot of hybrid subband samples consisting
of a LF (low frequency) sub QMF subband portion and HF (high frequency) QMF
subband portion.
## 5.3 Configurations
The parametric stereo encoder uses two different configurations depending on
desired frequency resolution. The configuration parameter, _num_stereo_bands_
determines what frequency resolution should be used for the stereo parameters.
For all bitrates below 21000 bit/s, _num_stereo_bands_ is set to 10 otherwise
_num_stereo_bands_ is set to 20.
## 5.4 Stereo parameter extraction
### 5.4.1 Parameter estimation
In order to estimate the stereo parameters the signals M, L and R are analyzed
using the hybrid filterbank as in Figure 2 for providing the 77 frequency
bands addressed by the index, {width="0.6527777777777778in"
height="0.18055555555555555in"}. This results in the (sub-)subband domain
signals, {width="0.5138888888888888in" height="0.25in"}, {width="0.44375in"
height="0.25in"} and {width="0.4722222222222222in" height="0.25in"}.
To estimate the parameters for the current frame the following is calculated:
{width="2.2083333333333335in" height="0.5138888888888888in"}
{width="2.25in" height="0.5138888888888888in"}
{width="3.19375in" height="0.4722222222222222in"}
where {width="0.375in" height="0.25in"}, {width="0.375in" height="0.25in"} and
{width="0.4027777777777778in" height="0.25in"} are the left channel
excitation, the right channel excitation and the non-normalized cross-channel
excitation between left and right channel for stereo bin {width="0.125in"
height="0.18055555555555555in"} respectively, L the segment length,
{width="0.125in" height="0.1527777777777778in"} a very small value preventing
division by zero ({width="0.5555555555555556in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}). The summation over
{width="0.1388888888888889in" height="0.18055555555555555in"} is shown in
Table 2 for 20 bands case. For the 10 bands case additional formulas below are
used.

For the 10 band case, summation will be use the same table as the 20 band case
but with the additional summation:
{width="1.7777777777777777in" height="0.4305555555555556in"}
{width="1.8055555555555556in" height="0.4305555555555556in"}
{width="1.875in" height="0.4305555555555556in"}
Where {width="0.25in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} and
{width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} and
{width="0.2916666666666667in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} should replace
{width="0.1388888888888889in" height="0.2222222222222222in"} and
{width="0.1527777777777778in" height="0.2222222222222222in"} and
{width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.2222222222222222in"} in the following
formulas for the 10 band case.
The IID, denoted as iid(b) and the ICC, denoted as icc(b), for each stereo
band {width="0.125in" height="0.18055555555555555in"} are calculated as:
{width="1.5555555555555556in" height="0.5138888888888888in"}
### 5.4.2 Quantization of IID and ICC parameters
The obtained values for IID and ICC are quantized to the nearest lower value
given in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively, then coded into Huffman words
according to Huffman tables found in [4] section 8.B.1 Huffman tables ps_data.

## 5.5 Writing to bitstream
The parametric stereo bitstream should be placed in the SBR extension field
according to syntax in Table 5. The EXTENSION_ID_PS should be used as
extension identifier. Note that due to SBR extension is design, the total
size, in bytes, of the ps_data element has to be added to the SBR extension
element before writing the actual ps_data.

The syntax of the ps_data is defined in [4] Table 8.1. The bitstream elements
in ps_data should be assigned values according to the following list.
**enable_ps_header** \-- Is set to 1 for all frames containing an SBR header.
Is set to 0 for all other cases.
**enable_iid** \-- Is set to 0 if all values in the iid vector after
quantization are zero. Is set to 1 for all other cases.
**enable_icc** \-- Is set to 0 if all values in the icc vector after
quantization are zero. Is set to 1 for all other cases.
**iid_mode** \-- Is set to 0 if 10 stereo bands resolution is chosen. Is set
to 1 for all other cases.
**icc_mode** \-- Is set to 0 if 10 stereo bands resolution is chosen. Is set
to 1 for all other cases.
**enable_ext** \-- Is set to 0.
**frame_class** \-- Is set to 0.
**num_env_idx** \-- Is set to 0 if all values in the iid and icc vectors after
quantization are unchanged since previous frame. Is set to 1 for all other
cases.
**iid_dt** \-- Is set to 1 if differential coding of iid parameters over time
gives a lower total Huffman code length than differential coding of iid
parameters with respect to the previous parameter position. Is set to 0 for
all other cases.
**icc_dt** \-- Is set to 1 if differential coding of icc parameters over time
gives a lower total Huffman code length than differential coding of iid
parameters with respect to the previous parameter position. Is set to 0 for
all other cases.
**iid_par_dt[n]** \-- In case of differential coding of IID parameters over
time (iid_dt==1), iid_par_dt[n] describes the IID difference with respect to
the previous parameter position. If no previous parameter position is
available, iid_par_dt[n] represents the IID difference with respect to the
decoded value 0 (i.e. index=0).
**iid_par_df[n]** \-- In case of differential coding of IID parameters over
frequency (iid_dt==0), iid_par_df[n] describes the Huffman encoded IID
difference with respect to the parameter (n-1).
**iid_par_df[0]** \-- represents the IID difference with respect to the
decoded value 0 (i.e. index=0).
**icc_par_dt[n]** \-- In case of differential coding of ICC parameters over
time (icc_dt==1), icc_par_dt[n] describes the difference with respect to the
previous parameter position. If no previous parameter position is available,
icc_par_dt[n] represents the ICC difference with respect to the decoded value
1 (i.e. index=0).
**icc_par_df[n]** \-- In case of differential coding of ICC parameters over
frequency (icc_dt==0), icc_par_df[n] describes the ICC difference with respect
to the parameter (n-1). icc_par_df[0] represents the ICC difference with
respect to the decoded value 1 (i.e. index=0).
## 5.6 Downmixing to mono
A monaural signal is needed for encoding of the HE AAC mono core. A simple
stereo-to-mono downmixing scheme is performed after extraction of the stereo
parameters. It combines equal parts of left and right channel and scales the
resulting mono signal in order to preserve most of the original total power.
The process is defined according to:
{width="2.1527777777777777in" height="0.4305555555555556in"}
where the stereo scale factor, {width="0.1388888888888889in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} is defined by:
{width="2.638888888888889in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}
{width="1.8333333333333333in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}
## 5.7 Synthesis filterbank
The stereo to mono down-mixed hybrid subband signal
{width="0.5138888888888888in" height="0.25in"} is fed into the hybrid
synthesis filterbank, that is implemented as an adder of sub QMF samples. This
is illustrated in Figure 3.
The synthesis filtering and implicit down-sampling of the 64 subband signals
is achieved using a 32-channel QMF bank. The output from the filterbank is
real-valued time domain samples. The process is given by the flowchart in
Figure 4. The synthesis filtering comprises the following steps, where an
array **v** consisting of 640 samples is assumed:
\- Shift the samples in the array **v** by 64 positions. The oldest 64 samples
are discarded.
\- The array of 32 complex-valued subband samples **Z** is separated into the
real and imaginary components as **Z** = **R** \+ i **I**. The components are
scaled and DCT and DST type IV transformed as
{width="3.3333333333333335in" height="0.8888888888888888in"}
\- The arrays **r** and **i** are combined and stored in the positions 0 to 63
in array **v** as
{width="2.1805555555555554in" height="0.4722222222222222in"}
\- Extract samples from **v** according to the flowchart in Figure 4 to create
the 320-element array **g**.
\- Multiply the samples of array **g** by every other coefficient of window
**w**. The window coefficients of **c** can be found in Figure 4, and are the
same as for the analysis filterbank.
\- Calculate 32 new output samples by summation of samples from array **w**
according to the last step in the flowchart of Figure 4
Every SBR frame produces an output of {width="1.6111111111111112in"
height="0.18055555555555555in"} time domain samples. In the flowchart of
Figure 4 **X**[k][l] corresponds to subband sample l in the QMF subband k, and
every new loop produces 32 time domain samples as output.
