# 3A Overview
## 3A.1 Introduction
This specification defines profiles, codecs and formats for 5G Media
Streaming. In this clause, the connection to 5G Media Streaming Architecture
in TS 26.501 [5] is introduced.
## 3A.2 Codecs and Formats in Downlink Media Streaming
### 3A.2.1 Architecture, Interfaces and APIs
According to TS 26.501 [5], Downlink Media Streaming provides the ability for
content to be distributed using procedures and protocols defined by 5G Media
Streaming as shown in Figure 3A.2.1-1. The detailed procedures for the
interfaces and APIs for 5G Media Streaming are defined in TS 26.512 [10].
{width="5.924305555555556in" height="3.7375in"}
Figure 3A.2.1-1: Downlink 5G Media Streaming architecture
The present document primarily deals with the segment formats delivered on M4d
and the requirements applicable to the media playback platform and content
decryption module. According to Figure 3A.2.1-1, the Access Client in the
5GMSd Client uses the manifest, typically the Media Presentation Description
(MPD) for Dynamic Streaming over HTTP (DASH) as defined in ISO/IEC 23009-1
[20] and TS 26.247 [21] or the Master Playlist for HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)
as defined in IETF RFC 8216 [22] to download Segments to initiate a media
playback session. A 5GMSd Application Provider may publish these segments
directly through M2d such that the 5GMSd AS acts as a hosting server but does
not require the media to be either transcoded or repackaged. Using these
unified formats maximizes cacheability and improves general Content Delivery
Network (CDN) operations, including usage of secure transport protocols such
as HTTPS on interface M4d.
5G Media Streaming segment formats are defined based on the Common Media
Application Format (CMAF) as specified in ISO/IEC 23000-19 [7]. By using this
format, 5G Media Streaming is compatible with a broad set of segment-based
streaming protocols including Dynamic Streaming over HTTP (DASH) and HTTP Live
Streaming (HLS). For example, ISO/IEC 23009-1 [20] defines a detailed DASH
profile for delivering CMAF content within a DASH Media Presentation using a
converged format for segmented media content.
Readers of the present document are encouraged to familiarize themselves with
terms defined in CMAF such as CMAF Headers, CMAF Fragments, CMAF Tracks and
CMAF Switching Sets. CMAF defines a content model for adaptive playback of
segmented media (enabling seamless switching across tracks encoded from the
same media) and late binding of tracks from different media types, associated
with the same presentation. CMAF also defines a content protection and
encryption framework for multi-DRM support based on ISO/IEC 23001-7 [8].
Furthermore, CMAF defines media profiles, i.e. encoding constraints on a CMAF
track and its contained media samples associated with a specific codec. This
specification only uses the structural constraints of CMAF as defined in
clause 7 of ISO/IEC 23000-19 [7] and in clause 8 of ISO/IEC 23000-19 [7] for
encrypted content. Specific 5GMS media profiles for video, audio and subtitles
based on the general constraints of ISO/IEC 23000-19 [7], clauses 9, 10 and
11, respectively, are defined in the present document. However, Downlink Media
Streaming is not restricted to the media profiles defined in the present
document: any codec that defines a CMAF media profile may be used and
distributed with Downlink Media Streaming.
### 3A.2.2 Hypothetical Device Playback Model
The media playback platform is initiated and used by the Access Client to
create a streaming session and experience. The Access Client itself handles
the download of segmented media content via interface M4d. This specification
is based on a hypothetical playback model that permits an 5GMSd-Aware
Application and/or a media Access Client to play back segmented media content
streamed via 5G Media Streaming for downlink. Playback receiver requirements
for CMAF content are defined in the CTA WAVE Device Playback Specification [9]
documenting how an Access Client can use manifest information for establishing
and performing playback of CMAF content based on a CMAF Reference Player
model.
Following the details in Figure 3A.2-1, playback functionalities include:
> 1) Querying the capabilities of the device to determine if it supports the
> playback of a specific media profile. Different means exist and are
> described in CTA-5003 [9], but minimally a well-defined MIME type and a
> well-defined codecs parameter following the requirements in RFC 6381 [11] is
> needed.
>
> 2) Initializing the playback platform with the codec by providing
> appropriate initialization information. At minimum, a CMAF Header is needed
> for initializing the decoder. Initialization of content decryption, if
> needed, depends on the used DRM system.
>
> 3) Playback itself, by appending data to source and track buffers and
> providing additional instructions such as seek, accelerated playback, random
> access, etc
>
> 4) The ability to check the status of the playback platform, for example the
> size and duration of the media buffers, current playback time, etc. Relevant
> APIs exposed by the 5GMSd Client via M7d are defined in TS 26.512 [21].
>
> 5) The ability to receive notifications and and error events from the
> playback platform, for example non-conforming content, buffer unde-runs,
> etc. Relevant APIs exposed by the 5GMSd Client via M7d are defined in TS
> 26.512 [21].
### 3A.2.3 Necessary Conditions for Codecs and Formats in 5GMSd
In order to use a media codec or a specific media profile of the codec in the
context of 5G Media Streaming, the following aspects need to be defined:
> \- A CMAF media profile definition with all the requirements according to
> ISO/IEC 23000-19 [7] for a media profile.
>
> \- A definition of how capability discovery can be done, at the minimum a
> suitable and well-defined MIME type following the requirements in RFC 6381
> [11], and in particular the definition of the codecs and profiles
> parameters.
>
> \- The mapping of media profile parameters to a DASH MPD. The mapping
> includes the static information (i.e. fixed parameters in the MPD) and
> dynamic information (e.g., depending on information in the CMAF Header).
>
> \- Potential requirements and restrictions for encrypted content.
This specification defines the above information for several media codecs in
clause 4, and provides requirements and recommendations for the support of
these media profiles in specific 5G Media Streaming profiles in clause 5.
NOTE: Downlink Media Streaming is not restricted to the media profiles defined
in this specification: any CMAF media profile may be used and distributed
within Downlink Media Streaming as long as it can be used with APIs and
interfaces defined in TS 26.512 [21] and the above information is provided.
## 3A.3 Codecs and Formats in Uplink Media Streaming
Codecs and formats for uplink streaming are defined in the remainder of this
specification.

### 5.2.8 Capability discovery
#### 5.2.8.1 General
A 5GMSd Client is expected to support capability discovery such that 5GMS-
Aware Applications can identify if a specific media profile is supported. In
order to identify whether a media profile is supported, the 5GMSd Client may
provide an API as defined in TS 26.512 [10] via the M7d interface, for which
the client can be queried with a specific MIME type string, if the media
profile is supported.
The MIME types follow RFC 6381 [11].
A 5GMSd Client should support at least one of the following capability
discovery mechanisms for media profiles:
\- If isTypeSupported() for the media profile with argument \
results in a yes, then the respective media profile is supported with the
requirements defined in a specific clause.
\- If isTypeSupported() for the media profile with argument \ results
in a yes, then the respective media profile is supported with the requirements
defined in a specific clause.
\- If a conforming CMAF header is provided for playback initialization and the
5GMSd Client does not throw an error response, then the respective media
profile is supported with the requirements defined in a specific clause.
