The present document collects together temporary documents of ETSI SMG and STC
SMG2 and 3GPP GERAN which can be seen as base line material for the RF
requirements in GSM 05.05. The documents are divided into several clauses
In each clause there is a short description of the documents. The documents
themselves are annexed to this report.
A list of phase 2 change requests to SMG2 related documents are annexed to the
SMG meeting reports.
# 3 DCS1800 system scenarios
There are two documents describing the basis of the DCS1800 RF requirements.
They are:
\- DCS1800 System scenarios (TDoc SMG 259/90, reproduced as TDoc SMG 60/91).
\- Justifications for the DCS1800 05.05 (TDoc SMG 260/90, revised as TDoc SMG
60/91)).
These documents have been derived first by the UK PCN operators and later by
GSM2 ad hoc group working on DCS 1800 requirements during 1990. The documents
were presented to TC SMG in October 1990.
**DCS1800 System Scenarios** describes six scenarios which are considered to
be the relevant cases for DCS1800. The six scenarios described are:
\- Single MS - Single BTS.
\- Multiple MSs - Multiple co-ordinated BTSs.
\- Multiple MSs - Multiple uncoordinated BTSs.
\- Co-located MSs, co-ordinated/uncoordinated.
\- Co-located BTSs, co-ordinated/uncoordinated.
\- Co-location with other systems.
On each of these scenarios the system constraints related to the scenario are
described, the RF requirements affected by the scenario are identified and the
input information needed to study the scenario in detail is listed.
**Justifications for the DCS1800 05.05** includes the analysis of the system
scenarios to detailed RF requirements and presents and justifies the proposed
changes to GSM 05.05 for DCS1800. In the analysis part the relevant scenario
calculations are made for each RF requirement and the most critical scenario
requirement identified. The justification part then looks at the identified
scenario requirement, compares it to the corresponding existing GSM900
requirement and taking also into account the implementation issues and finally
gives reasoning to the proposed change of the specific RF requirement.
These documents are in annex A.
The DCS1800 requirements were originally developed for Phase 1 as a separate
set of specifications, called DCS-specifications. For Phase two the DCS1800
and GSM900 requirements are merged. The main Phase 2 change requests of SMG2
in which the requirements for the DCS1800 system were included into are listed
below.
\- CR 05.01-04 Combination of GSM900 and DCS1800 specifications.
\- CR 05.05-37 rev1 Combination of 05.05 (GSM900) and 05.05-DCS (DCS1800)
specifications.
\- CR 05.08-55 rev1 Combination of GSM900 and DCS1800 and addition of National
roaming.
Further development of the DCS1800 requirements for Phase 2 can be found in
the other Phase 2 CRs of SMG2, the vast majority of which are valid both for
DCS1800 and GSM900. The list of Phase 2 CRs of SMG2 can be found in annex E.
# 4 GSM900 small cell system scenarios
There is one document which discusses the small cell system scenarios for
GSM900. The document is:
\- Small cell system scenarios for GSM900 (TDoc SMG2 104/92, revised as TDoc
SMG2 104/92 rev1).
**Small cell system scenarios for GSM900** uses the DCS1800 system scenarios
and justification document and derives from them the scenario requirements for
GSM900 small cells. It also calculates the worst case requirements based on
minimum coupling loss of 59 dB.
The document on GSM900 small cell system scenarios is in annex B.
CR 03.30-02 on \"Propagation models for different types of cells\" gives a
definition for a small cell and the typical cell parameters to calculate the
propagation loss in a small cell.
# 5 GSM900 and DCS1800 microcell system scenarios
GSM900 and DCS1800 microcells have been discussed by SMG2 in various meetings
since late 1991. In SMG2#2 (May 1992) a small group was formed to collect
together the various documents and make a proposal for the microcell RF
parameters. As agreed by SMG2 there should be four microcell specific
requirements, namely:
\- transmit power;
\- receive sensitivity;
\- wideband noise;
\- blocking.
As a result of the subgroup and other SMG2 activities there are three
documents which can be used as baseline material for the microcell
requirements. They are:
\- Microcell BTS RF parameters (TDoc SMG2 163/92);
\- Comments and proposals on Microcell RF parameters (TDoc 144/92);
\- Revised proposal for microcell RF parameters (TDoc SMG2 ad hoc 4/92).
**Microcell BTS RF parameters** and **Comments and proposals on Microcell RF
parameters** are joint papers giving the microcell scenarios and the
requirements. The first one describes the two microcell scenarios, namely
range and proximity, and presents the method to derive the detailed
requirements starting from the scenarios. The latter document includes some
corrections/updates to the scenarios, and proposes the detailed requirements.
As described in the documents there are three classes of microcells, depending
on the expected Minimum Coupling Loss between BTS and MS. This is to guarantee
the optimum choice of BTS transmit powers while maintaining the operability of
the system. The last of the microcell documents, **Revised proposal for
microcell RF parameters** includes updates to the detailed requirement
figures.
All the microcell requirements were collected together and were presented to
and approved by SMG#5.
The documents on GSM900 and DCS1800 microcells are in annex C.
The relevant change requests where the detailed microcell requirements can be
found, are listed below.
\- CR 03.30-04 Microcell Radio planning aspects;
\- CR 03.30-08 Microcell minimum coupling loss for small frequency offsets;
\- CR 05.05-69 rev1 Microcell BTS RF parameters;
\- CR 05.05-79 rev1 Alignment of microcell maximum peak power requirement
presentation;
\- CR 05.05-90 Update of DCS1800 microcell RF parameters.
# 6 Conversion factors
One of the tasks in ETSI/STC SMG2 has been to align the different RF
requirements for the Phase 2 specifications. This was found necessary because
in phase 1 some of the RF requirements dominated over others making them
almost obsolete. Related to the alignment process it was found necessary to
introduce a set of conversion factors to be able to compare different types of
requirements measured with different measurement techniques. The original work
assumptions were agreed on at SMG2#1 in February 1992 and they were reviewed
in SMG2 ad hoc meeting in April 1992.
There are two documents related to the conversion factors. They are:
\- Report of the ad hoc meeting on RF parameters (TDoc SMG2 61/92).
\- Agreed SMG2 conversion factors (TDoc SMG2 287/92).
**Report of the ad hoc meeting on RF parameters** describes the process of
deriving the conversion factors. In the ad hoc meeting there were number of
input papers with practical measurement results of different measurement
techniques, and in the ad hoc those measurement results were compared and the
average of the results was chosen as a conversion factor. The following
conversion factors were agreed on.
\- conversion from maximum peak power to average power in a 30 kHz bandwidth
on carrier:
=> -8 dB.
\- conversion from average power to maximum peak power in 30 kHz bandwidth:
=> +8 dB at zero offset from carrier and + 9 dB at all other offsets.
\- conversion from average power in 100 kHz bandwidth to maximum peak power in
30 kHz bandwidth:
=> +5 dB at offset above 1 800 kHz from carrier.
On the conversion factor from maximum peak power in 300 kHz bandwidth to
maximum peak power in 30 kHz bandwidth no agreement was reached in the ad hoc
meeting and hence the working assumption agreed on in SMG2 meeting is still
assumed while pending for further validation.
=> -8 dB at offset above 6 MHz from the carrier.
**Agreed SMG2 conversion factors** lists the above agreed conversion factors
and proposes further a conversion factor of +5 dB for conversions from 100 kHz
bandwidth to 300 kHz bandwidth at offsets above 1 800 kHz from the carrier.
These documents are in annex D.
# 7 Repeaters
There are a number of documents describing the background to repeater
scenarios. These are:
\- Repeater operating scenarios (Tdoc SMG2 29/94);
\- Repeater scenarios for DCS1800 (Tdoc SMG2 24/94);
\- Repeater scenarios (Tdoc SMG2 25/94);
\- Repeater out of band gain (Tdoc SMG2-RPT 20/94).
**Repeater operating scenarios:** describes the many different scenarios for
which a repeater device might be used.
**Repeater scenarios for DCS1800:** describes two scenarios for DCS1800
repeaters, the outdoor scenario and the indoor scenario. For each scenario,
the performance requirements on the repeater are derived.
**Repeater scenarios:** derives the equations that describe the uplink and
downlink performance of a repeater. Co‑ordinated and uncoordinated scenarios
are analysed resulting in outline proposals for repeater hardware requirements
in GSM 05.05 and outline planning guidelines in GSM 03.30.
**Repeater out of band gain:** derives the requirements for the repeater out
of band gain and provides planning guidelines when a repeater is in close
proximity to other communication systems.
These documents are in annex E.
The documents were presented to STC SMG2 in March 1994. In conclusion, it was
decided that no single repeater specification would serve the large number of
repeater scenarios that exist. As a consequence, it was agreed to add a
specification for the repeater out of band performance to GSM 05.05 with
guidelines for the specification and planning of repeaters in the GSM/DCS
bands in GSM 03.30.
# 8 Error Patterns for Speech Coder Developments
TD 164/95 in annex F describes available error patterns.
# 9 Simulations of Performance
Several documents in annex G gives background information and simulation
results of the GSM performance.
# 10 GSM900 railway system scenarios
In 1993, the \"Union Internationale de Chemin de Fer\", UIC, decided to base a
new railways pan-European system on GSM technology operating in the 900 MHz
band.
In 1995, the CEPT, in recommendation T/R 25-09, decided that \" the
international requirements without excluding national requirements of railways
for non-public digital radiocommunication system in the 900 MHz band should be
covered by selecting appropriate sub-bands from the designated band 876 MHz to
880 MHz (mobile station transmit) paired with 921 MHz to 925 MHz (base station
transmit) with a duplex separation of 45 MHz\".
During 1996, SMG2 in a two-step process discussed the RF parameters in GSM
05.05 for GSM-type equipments operating in this frequency band, called UIC
equipments. Two documents were elaborated for this purpose. They are:
\- UIC system scenarios requirements;
\- UIC RF parameters.
In **UIC system scenarios requirements** , the relevant system and
interference scenarios for UIC equipments are identified and the noise levels
allowed and the signal levels arising out of the worst cases are derived, both
as regards intra-systems performance of a UIC network and towards other GSM-
type systems in the neighbouring frequency bands.
Basing on the former, **UIC RF parameters** discusses all the parameters in
GSM 05.05 and determines the RF requirements for UIC equipments, to be in line
with the scenario requirements where possible and feasible, or being a
reasonable compromise where not. The specifications for other GSM900 and
DCS1800 types of equipment are not affected, except possibly where there is
absolutely no implications for their implementation.
These documents are in clauses H.1 and H.2, respectively.
The resulting specifications were incorporated into GSM 05.05 by Change
Request no. A027.
# 11 Simulation results for GPRS receiver performance
The documents in annexes K, L, M, N, P, Q and W give background information
and simulation results of GPRS receiver performance
# 12 Pico BTS RF scenarios
The documents in annex R give background information on pico BTS RF scenarios.
# 13 CTS system scenarios
The document in annex S gives background information on CTS system scenarios.
# 14 GSM400 system scenarios
There is one document describing the GSM400 system scenarios. The present
document is:
\- GSM400 system scenarios (Tdoc SMG2 190/99, revised as Tdoc SMG2 542/99).
GSM400 System Scenarios document presents GSM400 operation primarily in
respect of the GSM 05.05 series of recommendations. All relevant scenarios for
each part of GSM 05.05 are considered and the most critical cases identified.
As a result the present document gives background information for GSM400 RF
requirements presented in GSM 05.05 specification.
The present document on GSM400 system scenarios is in annex T.
# 15 MXM system scenarios
The document in Annex U gives background information for 850 MHz and 1 900 MHz
mixed mode system operation. 850 MHz and 1 900 MHz mixed-mode is defined as a
network that deploys both 30 kHz RF carriers and 200 kHz RF carriers in
geographic regions where the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
regulations are applied.
# 16 LCS scenarios
The documents in annex V gives background information on LCS scenarios.
# 17 8-PSK Scenarios
The document in annex X gives background information on 8-PSK scenarios.
# 18 T-GSM 900 System Scenarios
The document in annex Y gives background information on T-GSM 900 scenarios.
# 19 MBMS System Scenarios
The document in annex Z gives background information and simulation results of
MBMS receiver performance.
# 20 T-GSM 810 System Scenarios
The document in annex ZA gives background information on coexistence scenarios
for T-GSM810.
# 21 Multicarrier BTS Class
The document in annex ZB gives background information on introduction of
multicarrier BTS class.
# 22 ER-GSM band introduction
As per the Work Item RT_ERGSM approved at 3GPP GERAN #51 in ZD.6 [1], it is
required that investigations are performed to ensure that introduction of RF
requirements for ER-GSM equipments usage will minimize the potential impacts
to existing 3GPP systems in the E-GSM band and secure that the current 3GPP
GERAN requirements of the existing GSM 900 bands and therefore dedicated
equipment and services are not affected.
Annex ZD is therefore created to meet that requirement and gives background
information on introduction of ER-GSM band scenarios.
# 23 Extended Training Sequence Code Sets
## 23.1 Background
All burst types, except the frequency correction burst, contain a training
sequence (also referred to as a synchronization sequence). Its purpose is to
facilitate synchronization, channel estimation and blind detection of
modulation on the radio interface.
For normal bursts (NB) and higher symbol rate bursts (HB) a set of eight
training sequences is defined for each modulation (GMSK, 8PSK, 16QAM and 32QAM
for NB, and QPSK, 16QAM and 32QAM for HB) to facilitate training sequence
planning, i.e., avoiding that strong interfering bursts have the same training
sequence as the wanted signal bursts.
For VAMOS, a second set of eight training sequences (TSC Set 2) is defined for
GMSK modulated normal bursts (see 3GPP TS 45.002). Two GMSK training sequences
are used to form the AQPSK training sequence (see 3GPP TS 45.002) for the
downlink VAMOS modulation. The VAMOS (Set 2) training sequences have superior
cross-correlation properties compared to the first set. This has facilitated
improved Circuit Switched (CS) link level performance leading to enhanced BTS
hardware capacity and improved spectral utilization in CS deployments compared
to only using the existing TSC set.
All training sequences are defined in 3GPP TS 45.002.
## 23.2 Extended TSC Sets
### 23.2.1 Scope
When using extended TSC sets additional sets, each of eight training
sequences, are defined for the different modulations when using normal bursts.
The number of additional TSC sets depends on the domain (circuit switched or
packet switched) they operate in and the modulation scheme used.
For the circuit switched domain, two new GMSK sets, referred to as GMSK TSC
Set 3 and GMSK TSC Set 4 are defined. For VAMOS, the two GMSK training
sequence sets can be used to form the AQPSK training sequence (see 3GPP TS
45.002) for the downlink VAMOS modulation.
For the packet switched domain, including EGPRS and EGPRS2-A, one additional
set of eight training sequences is defined for each of GMSK, 8PSK, 16QAM and
32QAM normal bursts, referred to as TSC Set 2 for 8PSK, 16QAM and 32QAM
modulation, while for GMSK, TSC set 3, which is identical to TSC set 3 used
for circuit switched channels, is used.
With 16 new sequences for GMSK and 8 new sequences for 8PSK, 16QAM and 32QAM a
total of 40 new sequences are introduced.
### 23.2.2 Design criteria
The new sequences have good cross-correlation properties both within the sets
for each modulation but also between the different modulations and towards all
TSC sets that existed before the extention was introduced, for all modulations
as well as the dummy burst. When designing the sequences, care was taken to
make sure the cross correlation properties were especially good for co-channel
interference, but also to have good properties for adjacent channel
interference. With better cross-correlation properties the link level
performance is improved and hence also the spectral efficiency for both the
Packet Switched (PS) and the Circuit Switched (CS) domain. The gains will be
most evident in the case of synchronous network operation, where the training
sequence of wanted signal and interferer to a large extent overlap.
### 23.2.3 Design methodology
The design of the training sequences is described in detail in the document in
Subclause ZE.1. The sets were derived one at a time in the order GMSK Set 3,
GMSK Set 4, 8PSK Set 2, 16QAM Set 2, 32QAM Set 2. Each new set was designed
such that the cross-correlation properties were good not only within the set
but also towards all other existing sets, currently available, and the already
generated extended TSC sets in the step-wise approacch.
First an exhaustive search was performed and a large number of sequences with
good auto-correlation properties and good cross-correlation properties against
all existing sets were selected. Measures of both auto-correlation and all
combinations of cross-correlation for all these sequences were calculated. The
set was then selected as the one minimizing the cost function based on these
correlations.
### 23.2.4 Evaluation methodology
A methodology framework for evaluating the extended TSC set was followed
according to the document in Subclause ZE.2. In short the extended TSC set was
evaluated in both interference limited (including both CCI and ACI) and
sensitivity limited scenario. For interference limited scenarios the relative
delay of the interferer was derived using system level simulations with
different cell sizes and re-use factors. The evaluation was based on
simulations. These simulations covered both the CS and PS domain for the 900
MHz frequency band. All modulations, including GPRS, EGPRS and EGPRS2-A were
considered. Besides sensitivity evaluations, co-channel and adjacent channel
interference evaluations were performed. Both non-VAMOS and VAMOS test cases
were included in the evaluation. Different weight factors were applied, to
arrive at a final performance figure, depending on interference scenario and
modulation used. For more details see the document in Subclause ZE.3. The
working assumptions in Subclause ZE.3 constitute the basis of what is expected
from the extended TSC sets. They are a set of rules defining not only how to
evaluate the sets, but also highlighting what is considered to be important
during the design of the sequences. Since the working assumptions describe
what the extended TSC sets are designed for they are valuable to include in
this document for future reference.
### 23.2.5 Performance evaluation
The performance evaluation, appended in Subclause ZE.4, show the gains of
extending the TSC sets. For the performance evaluation a synchronous network
has been assumed.
It is shown that increasing the TSC plan from 8 TSCs to 16 TSCs for speech
channels give a link level gain of roughly 2 dB and a system capacity gain of
34 ‑ 47 % because of the reduced probability of co-TSC interference and
improved TSC correlation properties.
System level capacity gains with VAMOS have also been evaluated, see Subclause
ZE.4, where additional gains compared to VAMOS when using existing TSC sets
was shown to be 12 -- 18 percentage points.
Evaluation of the extended TSC sets described in Section 23.2.3 has been
performed according to the evaluation methodology described in Section 23.2.4
resulting in an average gain of 1.5 dB and 0.7 dB compared to TSC set 1, and
TSC set 1 and 2 respectively.
# 24 Machine-type-communication (MTC) deployment, including EC-GSM-IoT, in a
reduced BCCH spectrum allocation
## 24.1 Introduction
In GSM networks supporting both voice and data services a typical network
deployment includes a frequency layer of broadcast carriers using a 4/12 re-
use. This implies that the network deployment at least occupies a 2.4 MHz
bandwidth. In addition, in case more capacity is needed, one or more
additional frequency layers can be deployed which can have any re-use factor,
down to, and including, a 1/1 re-use. In any re-use factor in a typical
deployment however co-channel as well as adjacent channel interference caused
by channels in the same cell is always avoided.
In case the GSM network only supports data services, the quality of service
requirement compared to the general GSM/EDGE deployment changes.
In a circuit switched call, the quality of service requirements need to be
fulfilled in order for the service to work, e.g. a speech frame erasure rate
below a certain target. For packet switched services running RLC acknowledge
operation, with relaxed delay requirements, the control channel need to be
operable at a low enough block error rate (BLER), and the data channel need to
be operable at a BLER level where HARQ type I or type II can work.
As these data services are targeting small data transmissions where devices
are stationary or moving with a limited speed, idle mode mobility is
furthermore foreseen to be sufficient for these devices. So although supported
by the 3GPP standards, packet transfer mode handover is not expected to be
used by these devices, and only idle mode autonomous cell reselection is
expected to be used. For EC-GSM-IoT devices autonomous cell reselection is the
only means defined to provide mobility between cells.
These aspects provide a possibility to operate a GSM network in a tighter re-
use frequency scenario of the broadcast carrier, where the SINR levels in the
network will be reduced compared to traditional operation of the broadcast
layer.
## 24.2 Simulation campaign
### 24.2.1 Introduction
To evaluate the impact of a tighter broadcast layer frequency re-use factor,
three different re-use factors are investigated: 4/12, 3/9 and 1/3.
The system impact is evaluated by three main system aspects:
\- Idle mode procedures
\- The impact on aspects of cell selection and cell reselection, including the
impact on device synchronization to the FCCH and EC-SCH in terms of time to
synchronize, residual frequency offset and residual time offset, is evaluated
by means of network simulations. Impact on PLMN selection is presented based
on link level and analytical analysis.
\- Common control channels
\- The analysis on the common control channels have been investigated
separately to, in detail, study the impact on random access channel, and
access grant. Also some analysis on paging load is provided.
\- Data traffic and control channel
\- The data traffic channel and the associated control channel are
investigated where for example resource usage, data capacity and latency are
evaluated.
In all evaluations, the working assumptions listed in the framework in Annex
ZF.1 have been used, unless otherwise stated.
Both GPRS and EC-GSM-IoT have been investigated. There is a significant
difference in how these different MS behave in a network with regards to a
tight frequency re-use, justifying separate evaluations:
\- **Coverage / interference performance:** EC-GSM-IoT can operate in what is
referred to as extended coverage (see 3GPP TS 43.064). The extended coverage
is achieved by blind physical layer transmissions.that are collected by the
receiver to achieve processing gain, and effectively operate at a lower SNR
compared to not using the blind physical layer transmissions. The use of blind
physical layer transmissions not only extend coverage but will also lower the
operating point in an interference limited scenario in that an EC-GSM-IoT
capable device can operate at a lower C/I.
\- **Idle mode procedures:** EC-GSM-IoT devices will select cells at a maximum
coupling loss of 164 dB. In addition they should be functional in a low
frequency reuse. Therefore they are designed to perform signal level
measurements only including the wanted signal level, excluding sources from
interference and nosie. They are also mandated to measure a sub-set of the
logical channels of the BCCH carrier where power down regulation is not
permitted. So in case the network uses BCCH power saving functionality, down-
regulating the power of the broadcast carrier, will not impact the EC-GSM-IoT
measurement accuracy.
\- **Common control channel:** On the random access channel, an open-loop
power control, as well as an adaptation of the coverage class used on the
common control channel are used by EC-GSM-IoT MS which differs from non-EC-
GSM-IoT MS where such adaptation is not used, and the power control only
includes a coarse one power step approach to avoid too high signal levels at
the BTS receiver.
\- **Deployment** : EC-GSM-IoT devices are assumed to be placed in more
challenging radio conditions, for example indoors behind different number of
walls, or in a basement. Hence, the distance dependent path loss, and log-
normal fading component is complemented with a model of building penetration
loss in case EC-GSM-IoT is simulated. Even with the additional component of
building penetration loss, the majority of devices are placed within
GPRS/EGPRS coverage, but a small portion are also placed in extended coverage
taking up proportionally more resources per user.
### 24.2.2 Idle mode procedures
#### 24.2.2.1 General
##### 24.2.2.1.1 Simulator support
To model idle mode procedures a GSM link simulator has been integrated in a
network simulator where a full GSM network can be configured and interference
generated accordingly. The simulator has been used to evaluate GSM and EC-GSM-
IoT cell selection including synchronization performance and supports e.g.:
\- Modelling of the BCCH frequency layer with frequency reuses 1/3, 3/9 and
4/12
\- A BSIC and TSC plan
\- A correct mapping of applicable logical channels upon the 51--multiframe
\- Modelling of interferers and thermal noise on IQ level
\- BTS TX and MS RX performance modelled on IQ/bit level
Annex ZF.2 elaborates on details of the simulator implementation.
In addition the simulator could be configured to evaluate a single BTS to MS
link. This simulator mode was used to provide input to the PLMN selection
analysis.
##### 24.2.2.1.2 Performance metrics
The synchronization simulator has been used to investigate the ability of GSM
and EC-GSM-IoT devices to synchronize to a GSM/EC-GSM-IoT network, to perform
PLMN selection, to select a suitable cell based on RLA_C and RLA_EC
measurments and to reconfirm the BSIC of the serving cell. To synchronize in
this context refers to first successfully detect and synchronizing to the
FCCH, and secondly to decode the (EC-)SCH to extract and confirm the BSIC of
the camped on cell.
To characterize the synchronization performance of a GSM/EC-GSM-IoT network
the following results were derived:
\- Percentage of all devices in a network that manages to synchronize within
12 51-multframes, i.e. within \~2 seconds.
\- Time to synchronization, i.e. time until decoding of the (EC-)SCH including
confirmation of the BSIC.
\- Residual time offset after detection of and synchronization to the FCCH.
\- Residual frequency offset after detection of and synchronization to the
FCCH.
For PLMN selection a worst case analysis was performed where the performance
metric is the time needed to scan all ARFCNs in a set of supported frequency
bands during the search e.g. for a HPLMN.
For cell selection the performance is presented in terms of the probability of
selecting the strongest cell.
In addition the impact on cell selection performance from configuring a BSIC
plan using as few as 8 unique BSIC code points was investigated. The
likelihood of synchronization to a neighbouring cell during the search for the
serving cell was recorded. Two cases were distinguished, a first where the
neighbour cell uses a BSIC code point different from the code point used by
the serving cell, and a second where the neighbour cell reuses the BSIC code
point used by the serving cell. In the former case the device was configured
to continue its synchronization procedure. In the second case, known as BSIC
confusion, the device will synchronize to and select a neighbour cell, but not
detect a change in BSIC.
##### 24.2.2.1.3 Simulation assumptions
Simulation assumptions listed in the framework in Annex ZF.1 have been used,
including the assumption that GSM simulations were performed without building
penetration loss and with a cell radius of 2500 meter to span the full GSM
Maximum coupling loss of 144 dB, as claimed by TR 45.820 [1]. For the EC-GSM-
IoT simulations the assumptions from the TR 45.820 [1] was followed.
The logical channels modelled, e.g. the FCCH and (EC-)SCH, were modulated,
encoded and mapped in the 51-multiframe as specified in TS 45.002 [2], TS
45.003 [3] and TS 45.004 [4].
#### 24.2.2.2 PLMN selection
When performing initial PLMN selection a device needs to scan all ARFCNs of
its supported frequency bands. For a quad band device supporting GSM 850, 900,
1850 and 1900 frequency bands this implies that in total 124+174+374+299 =
971ARFCNs needs to be scanned. The total time to do so may in a worst case
scenario equate to 971 multipled by the time needed to connect to the system
from the supported maximum coupling loss (MCL).
It has been shown that an EC-GSM-IoT device can synchronize to a cell within
at most two seconds when being at the edge of the system, i.e. at 164 dBs MCL.
With this in mind the total time to scan the four mentioned frequency bands
will require roughly 32 minutes.

Figure 24.2.2-1: Total time to synchronization when at 164 dB coupling loss
The above reasoning is however based on an assumption that all bands and
ARFCNs are scanned in sequence, and that the EC-SCH is used as qualifier for
the presence of an EC-GSM-IoT system. If the ARFCNs are scanned in an
interleaved manner the search time can be shorted to around 10 minutes with
the FCCH as primary identifier for the presence of EC-GSM-IoT.
#### 24.2.2.3 Cell selection
##### 24.2.2.3.1 General
When performing cell selection a GPRS device follows the procedures specified
in 3GPP TSs 43.022 and 45.008. TS 43.022 mandate a device to select the
strongest cell from a received signal strength perspective that qualifies as
\"suitable\". TS 45.008 specify how the signal strength is to be measured in
terms of RLA_C, which is an average signal strength estimate calculated over
at least five samples during three to five seconds.
For EC-GSM-IoT the cell selection procedure has been updated to improve the
support of signal strength measurements in an interference limited
environment. TS 45.008 therefore specify a two-step approach as follows:
1\. Measure the signal strength of each RF channel in the selected PLMN using
RLA_C.
2\. For each of the strongest RF channels measured RLA_EC for the strongest
EC-BCCH carrier.
In the second step only the RF channels that are no more than
CELL_SELECTION_RLA_MARGIN dB below the strongest estimated RF channel needs to
be considered.
The next two sub-clauses present the cell selection performance that was
recorded during a simulation campaign for evaluation of cell selection
performance when following the mentioned procedures.
##### 24.2.2.3.2 GPRS/EGPRS
As EC-GSM-IoT is fully backwards compatible and intended to coexist with
(E)GPRS devices also (E)GPRS cell selection performance was evaluated in 1/3,
3/9 and 4/12 frequency reuse scenarios. The table below summarizes the
performance and it is seen that the cell selection procedure selects the best
ARFCN with a likelihood of 87-88 %, and is fairly insensitive to the frequency
reuse. This can be understood as a consequence of the symmetric cell plan used
in the network simulator, leading to a similar power ratio between the
simulated ARFCNs regardless of the frequency plan.
After ARFCN selection it was assumed that a (E)GPRS device selects the cell to
camp on based on the first BCCH carrier it manages to synchronize to and read
BSIC on. In high reuse systems with low interference ratio a device more or
less always selects the optimal cell to camp on. In the 1/3 frequency reuse
scenario with a high degree of interference the likelihood of selecting the
optimal BCCH carrier is reduced down to 83.6 %.
The GPRS devices always manage to synchronize to and select a cell, even
though it may not be an optimal cell from a signal strength perspective.
Table 24.2.2-1: The probability for a (E)GPRS device to select the optimal
ARFCN, the optimal BCCH carrier or any BCCH carrier.

* * *
The below figure depicts the CDF over the power of the selected BCCH carrier
relative to the best BCCH carrier. For 3/9 and 4/12 reuse the curves are more
or less identical. For 1/3 reuse the ratio is increased, or worsened, as a
consequence of suboptimal BCCH carrier selections occurring even though the
best ARFCN had been selected in the first step.
{width="3.6743055555555557in" height="2.75625in"}
Figure 24.2.2-2: Selected BCCH carrier to best BCCH carrier power ratio
Although the performance presented indicates a certain likelihood of selecting
a suboptimal cell, the sourcing company believes that this in general is not a
major issue in a PS only network. The cell selection performance depicted for
4/12 reuse should correspond to what typical GSM/EDGE networks and devices
experiences today. The increase when going to 1/3 reuse in suboptimal
selections is not dramatic, and is expected to be of minor concern but still
deserves attention in case an operator strives to implement a 1/3 BCCH
frequency reuse.
##### 24.2.2.3.3 EC-GSM-IoT
For EC-GSM-IoT the ARFCN selection performs similar to what was presented
above for (E)GPRS. But what is important is that the BCCH carrier selection
has improved as a consequence of the RLA_EC procedure. Higher propability
numbers are observed for all studied scenarios. An improvement in the selected
BCCH carrier relative to the best BCCH carrier power is also observed for the
1/3 reuse when comparing GSM with EC-GSM-IoT performance in figures 24.2.2-2
and 24.2.2-3.
It can again be noticed that in virtually all cases the device selects a cell,
even though it is sub-optimal in \~10 % of the cases.

ARFCN, the optimal BCCH carrier or any BCCH carrier.

Furthermore by increasing the number of samples taken when estimating RLA_EC
from five to 10, the likelihood of selecting the best BCCH carrier improves
further up to 92.6% in the critical 1/3 frequency reuse network, as seen in
table 24.2.2.2-3

#### 24.2.2.4 Cell reconfirmation
##### 24.2.2.4.1 GPRS/EGPRS
One important trigger for cell reselecton is failure to reconfirm the serving
cell. Annex ZF.5 presents an analysis of GSM/EDGE performance in terms of cell
reconfirmation when a devices wakes up e.g. after eDRX or PSM in a reduced
BCCH frequency allocation network. A summary of the results is presented in
table 24.2.2-4, figure 24.2.2-4, figure 24.2.2-5 and figure 24.2.2-6.
The overall synchronization success rate and time to synchronization to the
serving cell are presented in below table for the investigated frequency reuse
scenarios.

During the search for the serving cell FCCH and SCH a device may detect the
FCCH from a neighboring cell and successfully decode its SCH and read the
BSIC. The below figure depicts the likelihood of decoding neighboring cells
SCH and BSIC. Since a cell reconfirmation scenario was studied each device was
configured to continue its search for the serving cell SCH upon detecting that
the decoded BSIC did not match the serving cell BSIC. As a result a device may
decode neighboring SCHs multiple times before receiving the serving cell SCH
and confirming its BSIC. This is illustrated in the below figure for the three
studied frequency reuses.
{width="3.50625in" height="2.7555555555555555in"}
Figure 24.2.2-6: Likelihood of decoding the BSIC of a neighboring cell with
different BSIC than the serving cell.
In case a decoded neighboring SCH is configured with the same BSIC as the
serving cell a device will not detect that it has synchronized to new cell.
This unwanted event is known as BSIC confusion. A BSIC plan based on eight
unique BSICs was configured for each reuse. The BSIC plan for the 1/3
frequency reuse is illustrated in Annex ZF.2. The below table presents the
likelihood of BSIC confusion for each reuse. It can be concluded that even for
this tight BSIC plan, BSIC confusion is not an issue in case of stationary
devices attempting to reconfirm the serving cell.

# A.7 Title: Justifications for the proposed Rec. 05.05_DCS
##### I INTRODUCTION {#i-introduction .H6}
The DCS1800 system requirements are defined in a paper entitled \'DCS1800 -
System Scenarios\' (GSM TDoc 259/90) and the parameters chosen either meet
these requirements or represent a compromise between them and what can be
manufactured at an appropriate cost. Changes to the 900 MHz standard have only
been made where there is a specific system advantage or cost saving.
Consideration has been given to methods of measurement for the changed
specifications.
Section II expands the scenarios paper into more detailed requirements for RF
parameters. Section III follows the section numbering of GSM 05.05 and
justifies the desired changes for DCS1800. The present document does not
comment on simple changes from GSM900 to DCS1800 frequency bands since this
change is assumed.
##### II METHODOLOGY {#ii-methodology .H6}
Unless otherwise stated the results of scenario calculations assume transmit
powers of 39 dBm for the base and a 30 dBm for the mobile, both measured at
their respective antenna connectors. The equivalent noise bandwidth of the
transmitted signal is taken to be 120 kHz and that of the receiver 180 kHz.
Worst case scenarios usually involve a \"near/far\" problem of some kind, the
component scenario assumptions (as given in the scenarios paper for \"near\"
and \"far\" can be summarised as follows.
* * *
\"Near\" Coupling loss (dB) BTS -> MS 65 MS -> BTS 65 MS-> MS 40.5 BTS -> BTS
30
* * *
The coupling loss is defined between antenna connectors. The powers and
sensitivities are discussed in section III of this paper, they are quoted here
to enable scenario calculations to be performed. The transmitter power and
receiver sensitivity are measured at the respective antenna connectors.
* * *
\"Far\" Tx power (dBm) Rx Sensitivity (dBm) BTS 39 -104 MS 30 -100
* * *
Scenarios can involve uncoordinated or co-ordinated entities (MS or BTS)
depending on whether they are from the same PLMN. With uncoordinated operation
handover and power control are not used in response to the proximity of the
BTS and more severe near/far problems can arise, however, co-ordinated
scenarios are often more likely spatially and more likely to occur at lower
frequency offsets. Unco-ordinated scenarios become critical when they involve
mobiles being simultaneously on the edge of their serving cell and close to
another operator\'s BTS, also the transmitter and affected receiver will be in
different operator frequency allocations. It is most important that the co-
ordinated scenario requirements are met where possible.
The probability and consequences of the various scenarios must be taken into
account when choosing the actual specification. For example, jamming a whole
base station is a more serious consequence than jamming a single mobile and
intermodulation scenarios which involve the co-location of 3 entities are
consequently less likely than those which only involve 2.
The remainder of this section outlines the key scenario calculations which
affect the choice of parameters for GSM 05.05. Transmitted levels are those in
the receiver bandwidth, although in many cases the test bandwidths are
narrower because of the need to avoid switching transients affecting the
measurement.
## A.7.1 Transmitter
### A.7.1.1 Modulation, Spurs and Noise
#### A.7.1.1.1 Co-ordinated, BTS -> MS (Scenario 2, figure 2.1)
Since the affected MS is close to its own base we only need to ensure adequate
C/I at the BTS.
Max. Tx noise level in Rx bandwidth = [BTS power] - [Power control range] -
[C/I margin] - [Multiple interferers margin] = 39 - 30 - 9 \- 10 = **-10
dBm**.
(BTS dynamic power control is optional, in the worst case it will be employed
on the link to the affected MS but the other link will be at full power).
#### A.7.1.1.2 Uncoordinated, BTS -> MS (Scenario 3, figure 3.1)
Max. Tx. level of **noise** in Rx. bandwidth = [MS sensitivity] - [C/I margin]
- [Multiple interferers margin] + [Coupling loss] = -100 - 9 -10 + 65 = **-54
dBm**.
Max. Tx level of **spur** in Rx bandwidth = [MS sensitivity] - [C/I margin] +
[Coupling loss] = -100 - 9 + 65 = **-44 dBm**.
### A.7.1.1.3 Co-ordinated & Uncoordinated MS -> BTS (Scenarios 2 and 3,
figures 2.1 and 3.1)
Max. Tx level in Rx bandwidth = [BTS sensitivity] - [C/I margin] + [Coupling
loss] = -104 - 9 + 65 = **‑48 dBm**.
Although the absolute spec. is the same the MS may find it easier to meet
scenario 2 because it will be powered down.
#### A.7.1.1.4 Co-ordinated & Uncoordinated MS->MS (Scenario 4)
Max Tx level in Rx bandwidth = [MS sensitivity] - [C/I margin] + [Coupling
loss] = -100 - 9 + 40.5 = **‑68.5 dBm**.
#### A.7.1.1.5 Co-ordinated & Uncoordinated BTS->BTS (Scenario 5)
Max Tx level **noise** in Rx bandwidth= [BTS sensitivity] - [C/I margin] -
[Multiple interferers margin] + [Coupling loss] = -104 - 9 - 10 + 30 = **-93
dBm**.
### A.7.1.2 Switching Transients
The peak level of transients in a 5 pole synchronously tuned measurement
filter of bandwidth 100 kHz simulates their effect on the receiver. The
transients only effect a few bits per timeslot and have approximately 20 dB
less effect than continuous interference. Their peak level falls off at 20 dB
decade both with increasing frequency offset and measurement bandwidth.
#### A.7.1.2.1 Uncoordinated MS -> BTS (Scenario 3, figure 3.1)
Max. peak level in effective Rx BW at MS = [Base sensitivity] - [C/I margin] +
[Coupling loss] + [Transient margin] = -104 - 9 +65 + 20 = **-28 dBm**.
#### A.7.1.2.2 Uncoordinated BTS -> MS (Scenario 3, figure 3.1)
Max. peak level in effective Rx BW at BTS = [MS sensitivity] - [C/I margin] +
[Coupling loss] + [Transient margin] = ‑100 - 9 + 65 + 20 = **-24 dBm**.
### A.7.1.3 Intermodulation
#### A.7.1.3.1 Co-ordinated, BTS -> MS (Scenario 2, figures 2.2 and 2.3)
(Level of input signal 30 dB below wanted transmission).
Required IM attenuation in BTS = [C/I margin] + [BTS power control range] +
[margin for other IMs] = 9 + 30 + 3 = **42 dB**.
#### A.7.1.3.2 Uncoordinated, BTS ->MS (Scenario 3, figure 3.2 top)
(Level of input signal 30 dB below wanted transmission).
Required IM attenuation in BTS = [BTS power] - {[Max. allowed level at MS1] +
[coupling loss BTS2‑>MS1]} = 39 ‑{{-100 - 9 - 3} + 65} = **86 dB**.
#### A.7.1.3.3 Uncoordinated, MS&MS-> BTS (Scenario 4, figure 4.1 bottom)
(Level of input signal 40,5 dB below wanted transmission).
Required IM attenuation in MS = [MS power] - {[Max. allowed level at BTS2] +
[coupling loss MS->BTS2]} = 30 ‑{{‑104 - 9 - 3} + 65} = **81 dB**.
#### A.7.1.3.4 Uncoordinated MS&MS-> MS (Scenario 4, figure 4.1 top)
(Level of input signal 40,5 dB below wanted transmission).
Required IM attenuation in MS = [MS power] - {[Max. allowed level at MS3] +
[coupling loss MS->MS3]} = 30 ‑{{‑100 - 9 - 3} + 40,5} = **101,5 dB**.
## A.7.2 Receiver
### A.7.2.1 Blocking
### A.7.2.1.1 Co-ordinated & Uncoordinated BTS-> MS (Scenarios 2 and 3,
figures 2.1 and 3.1)
Max. level at MS receiver = [BTS power] + [Multiple interferers margin] -
[Coupling loss] = 39 + 10 - 65 = **‑16 dBm**.
#### A.7.2.1.2 Co-ordinated MS-> BTS (Scenario 2, figure 2.1)
Max level at BTS receiver = [MS power] - [Power control range] - [Coupling
loss] = 30 - 20 - 65 = **-55 dBm**.
#### A.7.2.1.3 Uncoordinated MS-> BTS (Scenario 3, figure 3.1)
Max level at BTS receiver = [MS power] - [Coupling loss] = 30 - 65 = **-35
dBm**.
#### A.7.2.1.4 Co-ordinated & Uncoordinated MS-> MS (Scenario 4)
Max. level at MS receiver = [MS power] - [Coupling loss] = 30 - 40,5 = **-10,5
dBm**.
#### A.7.2.1.5 Co-ordinated & Uncoordinated BTS-> BTS (Scenario 5)
Max. level at BTS receiver = [BTS power] + [Multiple interferers margin] -
[Coupling loss] = 39 +10 - 30 = **19 dBm**.
### A.7.2.2 Intermodulation
#### A.7.2.2.1 Co-ordinated & Uncoordinated BTS-> MS (Scenarios 2 and 3,
figure 3.2 middle)
Max. received level at MS1 = [BTS power] - [Coupling loss BTS2->MS1] + [Margin
for other IMs] = 39 - 65 + 3 = **‑23 dBm**.
Required IM attenuation in MS is 42 dB for scenario 2 and 86 dB for scenario
3. TheGSM 05.05 clause 5.2 test simulates scenario 3.
#### A.7.2.2.2 Co-ordinated MS & MS -> BTS (Scenario 4)
Max. received level at BTS1 = [MS power] - [MS power control range] \-
[Coupling loss MS-> BTS1] + [Margin for other IMs] = 30 - 20 - 65 \+ 3 = **-52
dBm**.
#### A.7.2.2.3 Uncoordinated MS & MS -> BTS (Scenario 4, figure 3.2 lower)
Max. received level at BTS1 = [MS power] - [Coupling loss MS-> BTS1] + [Margin
for other IM\'s] = 30 - 65 + 3 = **‑32 dBm**.
### A.7.2.3 Maximum level
#### A.7.2.3.1 Co-ordinated MS -> BTS (Scenario 1)
Max level at BTS = [MS power] - [Coupling loss] = 30 - 65 = **-35 dBm**.
(The BTS must be capable of decoding the RACH which is at full power).
#### A.7.2.3.2 Co-ordinated BTS -> MS (Scenario 1)
Max level at MS = [BTS power] - [Coupling loss] = 39 - 65 = **-26 dBm**.
(BTS dynamic power control is optional, in the worst case it will not be
employed, also the MS must be capable of decoding the BCCH carrier).
##### III JUSTIFICATIONS {#iii-justifications .H6}
## A.8.1 SCOPE
## A.8.2 FREQUENCY BANDS AND CHANNEL ARRANGEMENT
The up and downlink frequencies have been changed to cover the 1,8 GHz band.
The 374 carrier frequencies have been assigned ARFCNs starting at 512.
## A.8.3 REFERENCE CONFIGURATION
## A.8.4 TRANSMITTER CHARACTERISTICS
### A.8.4.1 Output power
#### A.8.4.1.1 Mobile Station
MS power classes of 1 and ¼W have been chosen for DCS1800 defined in the same
way as for GSM900. With a 30 m antenna height Hata\'s model predicts that the
higher MS power class will not quite meet the target ranges given in the
system scenarios paper both for urban and rural areas. The requirement for a
cheap, small, low power handset is also an important constraint. It is felt
that the chosen power classes represent a reasonable compromise between these
conflicting requirements.
A 20 dB power control range has been chosen for both classes of mobile since
it is believed that this will give most of the available improvement in uplink
co-channel interference.
Since the chosen power classes and hence power control levels are even numbers
in dBm they will not fit into the existing numbering scheme, so a new one has
been used. These numbers are only of editorial significance.
The absolute tolerance on power control levels below 13 dBm has been increased
by:
\- 1 dB because of manufacturers\' concerns about implementation.
#### A.8.4.1.2 Base Station
Following GSM900, the BTS power classes are specified at the combiner input.
In order to provide the operator some flexibility four power classes have been
specified in the range 34 dBm to 43 dBm. In fact the four lowest power classes
from GSM900 have been retained although the numbering has been changed. The 39
dBm BTS power measured at the antenna connector might typically match a 30 dBm
mobile.
The tolerance on the BTS static power control step size has been relaxed to
simplify implementation, control of the BTS power to an accuracy of less than
1dB was felt to be unnecessary.
The penultimate paragraph has been reworded because a class 1 mobile no longer
has 15 power steps.
### A.8.4.2 Output RF spectrum
The BTS is not tested in frequency hopping mode. If the BTS uses baseband
frequency hopping then it would add little to test in FH mode; if it uses RF
hopping then the test will be complicated by permissible intermodulation
products (see subclause 4.7) from BTSs which do not de-activate unallocated
timeslots.
#### A.8.4.2.1 Spectrum due to the modulation
The relaxation for MSs with integral antennas has been removed.
The measurement has been extended to cover the whole transmit band and beyond
1 800 kHz from carrier measurements are only taken on DCS1800 carrier
frequencies using a 100 kHz bandwidth. This technique still avoids permissible
switching transients, is fairly quick and closely reflects the receiver
bandwidth and hence the system scenario. It is now a measurement of broadband
noise as well as modulation.
The technique proposed in CR 30 for counting spur exceptions in FH mode for
GSM 05.05 is also included here.
The table has been split into those parts which apply to the mobile and those
which apply to the base reflecting the difference in their respective scenario
requirements.
When operating at full power, the table below shows the frequency offset at
which scenario requirements are met.
+------------+--------------------------+-----------------+ | | 39 dBm BTS at ant. conn. | 30 dBm MS | +------------+--------------------------+-----------------+ | Scenario 2 | 400 kHz (1.1.1) | 400 kHz (1.1.3) | +------------+--------------------------+-----------------+ | Scenario 3 | missed by 10dB | 6 MHz (1.1.3) | | | | | | | at 6 MHz (1.1.2) | | +------------+--------------------------+-----------------+
The figures in brackets are the relevant scenario requirement sub-section
numbers in section II of the present document.
Exceptions i and ii below the table define the maximum number of exception
channels appropriate to the frequency bands tested. For the BTS permissible
intermodulation products must be avoided.
Since the table entries are relative, as the power level of the transmitter is
reduced, the absolute specification becomes tighter. Exceptions iii and iv
stop the transmitters having to exceed the requirement of scenario 3. Further
relaxations are permitted at low frequency offsets; for the MS scenario 3 is
unlikely below 600 kHz and the requirement of scenario 2 is used; for the BTS,
the 10 dB multiple interferers margin is excessive below 1 800 kHz and the
minimum level is increased by 5 dB.
#### A.8.4.2.2 Spectrum due to switching transients
a) Mobile Station
The table has been modified in accordance with the new mobile power classes.
The transients are always above the modulation at 400 kHz offset and so the
table collapses to a single row.
Requirement 1.2.1 for scenario 3 becomes -38,5 dBm in 30 kHz. The current
specification meets this requirement at offsets above 2.4 MHz while the 4.2.1
test only meets scenario 3 at offsets above 6 MHz. The specification on
transients is not the limiting case and need not be changed.
b) Base Station
Requirement 1.2.2 for scenario 3 becomes -34,5 dBm in 30 kHz. With the current
specification a 39 dBm BTS meets this requirement at 600 kHz. Again no change
is proposed. This figure assumes that \"dBc\" means relative to the on-carrier
power in 30 kHz; a possible ambiguity in the wording has been removed.
### A.8.4.3 Spurious emissions
#### A.8.4.3.1 Principle of the specification
Although 4.2.1 now covers the whole transmit band, the in band part of 4.3.1
is still required to check the behaviour of switching transients beyond 1800
kHz and to catch any spurs missed in 4.2.1.
#### A.8.4.3.2 Base Station
The protection of frequencies outside the DCS1800 band is unchanged, but the
spurious emissions in the transmit band are only permitted up to -36 dBm which
is below the CEPT limit of -30 dBm but the same as GSM 05.05. The same applies
to the MS transmit band in 4.3.3. The new base receive band is given the same
protection as before measured in the modified conditions of 4.2.1, this meets
scenario requirement 1.1.5 scaled to a measurement bandwidth of 100 kHz. The
GSM900 base receive band is also protected but only when the co-siting of GSM
and DCS BTSs occurs.
#### A.8.4.3.3 Mobile Station
This section consists of two blanket specifications one for transmit mode and
one for idle mode Specific tests of the MS receive band are also given.
When allocated a channel, the transmit band and out-of-band specifications are
the same as for the BTS in 4.3.2. These are consistent with 4.2.1 and the CEPT
specifications for spurious emissions.
In idle mode the CEPT specification below 1 GHz is also applied to the DCS
transmit and receive bands using a 100 kHz measurement bandwidth, this
specification also exceeds scenario requirement 1.1.3 for the MS transmit
band. however, the number of mobiles in idle mode may be quite large.
The test of the MS receive band meets scenario requirement 1.1.4 and uses the
modified conditions of 4.2.1. 5 exception channels are permitted for discrete
spurious, it is rather unlikely that two MS will be one metre apart and
receiving at one of these exception channels. Protection of the GSM900 MS
receive band is also provided. The specification is 6 dB tighter reflecting
the reduced propagation loss between colocated MS at 900 MHz. The dependence
of this test on power class has been removed since all mobiles are hand
portables. No extra testing of the MS receive band in idle mode is made
because it is unlikely to be worse than when allocated a channel.
### A.8.4.4 Radio frequency tolerance
### A.8.4.5 Output level dynamic operation
#### A.8.4.5.1 Base station
This specification only affects the interference experienced by co-channel
cells in the same PLMN. The requirement on the relative power level of
unactivated timeslots has been relaxed from -70 dBc to -30 dBc in line with
the BTS power control range. It is understood that \"dBc\" includes the static
but not dynamic power control.The specification has been extended to cover the
whole transmit band because the residual power may not be highest on carrier.
The measurement bandwidth is specified as **at least** 300 kHz due to problems
with ringing of the measurement filter just after an active burst has
finished.
#### A.8.4.5.2 Mobile station:
The power level between active bursts from the MS affects the serving BTS
receiver. The power measured in 100 kHz on carrier will be similar to that
measured in the receiver bandwidth which must be less than -48 dBm to meet
scenario requirement 1.1.3. The absolute specification has been tightened from
-36 dBm to -47 dBm in line with this requirement but the relative
specification has been retained. Allowing 10 dB for the peak-to-mean ratio of
the power between active bursts if it is noise-like, the relative
specification will meet this scenario requirement for a 1W MS.
### A.8.4.6 Phase accuracy
### A.8.4.7 Intermodulation attenuation
The definition of intermodulation attenuation has been moved from subclause
4.7.1 to subclause 4.7 to make it clear that it applies to subclauses 4.7.1,
4.7.2 and 4.7.3. A note concerning possible problems with VHF broadcast
signals has been added because these are at the difference between the DCS up
and downlink frequencies.
#### A.8.4.7.1 Base transceiver station
#### A.8.4.7.2 Intra BTS intermodulation attenuation
#### A.8.4.7.3 Intermodulation between MS
Section 4.7.3 of the 900 MHz specification concerned the mobile PBX. The
mobile PBX is no longer included in GSM 02.06, there is no type approval for
it and consequently the original subclause 4.7.3 text has been removed. The
new section 4.7.3 relates to intermodulation between MS transmitters, an area
which was not covered in the 900 MHz standard.
In the proposed measurement, the level of the interfering signal simulates
that from a very close MS and the required IM attenuation is to protect MS or
BS receivers in the vicinity. MS transmit intermods are covered by scenario
requirements 1.3.3 and 1.3.4. If the product lands in the BTS receive band 81
dB IM attenuation is required, if the product lands in the MS receive band
101,5 dB IM attenuation is required in the MS transmitter which produces the
IM.
Both these scenarios require the co-location of 3 objects (MS or BTS) with the
correct frequency relationship. Experiments performed by manufacturers on 900
MHz PA\'s indicate that 50 dB attenuation is achievable at all frequency
offsets. A tighter specification would require the use of an isolator or more
linearity in the PA design. A specification of 50 dB tested at 800 kHz offset
was agreed.
## A.8.5 RECEIVER CHARACTERISTICS
A clarification of the of the measurement point for the receiver
specifications in line with that for the transmitter has been made.
### A.8.5.1 Blocking characteristics
The MS blocking specification close to the received channel has not been
changed, this is limited by the receive synthesizer phase noise. At higher
frequency offsets the blocking specification relates to the DCS1800 band and
the feasibility of the receive filter. The proposed specification is shown
below, the dashed line shows a possible receive filter frequency response.
The blocking specification at > 3 MHz offset in the receive band misses the
scenario requirement 2.1.1 (-16 dBm) by 10 dB, but the transmit band
specification meets scenario requirement 2.1.4 (-10,5 dBm). Power consumption
considerations make it undesirable to tighten the receive band specification.
The outside the DCS1800 band the 0 dBm specification has been retained. The
combination of these proposals amounts to a filter specification over the MS
receive band as shown below.
{width="6.16875in" height="4.445138888888889in"}
The BTS blocking requirement has been significantly relaxed because the MS
power classes are lower. Scenario requirement 2.1.2 is -55 dBm which considers
blocking from the bases own MS\'s. Requirement 2.1.3 is -35 dBm which is for
mobiles from other operators. The proposal meets the scenario requirements
even at 600 kHz offset and exceeds it by 10 dB beyond 800 kHz.
The consequence of failing to meet this scenario is that the whole base
station is blocked. For this reason it is desirable for the base station to
exceed the scenario requirement if possible.
The out-of-band specification has not been changed, although it does not meet
scenario requirement 2.1.5 (19 dBm). This is because the 30 dB coupling loss
assumption between base stations is rather pessimistic, it corresponds to two
18 dBi antennas on boresight 17 m apart. Under these circumstances, operators
may need to adopt specific mutual arrangements (eg. extra operator specific
receive filters) which need not form part of the DCS1800 standard.
### A.8.5.2 Intermodulation characteristics
The 900 MHz standard for handportables limits the maximum level to -49 dBm.
Any tightening of this specification will increase the power consumption of
the receiver. Since DCS1800 is designed for handportables this figure is now
applied to all MSs. The proposed level of -49 dBm for the MS fails to meet
scenario requirement 2.2.1 by 23 dB, but the only consequence is that the MS
is de-sensed when close to a BTS with the appropriate transmitters active.
The worst case for BTS receiver IMs is when two MSs approach the base, the
scenario requirement is covered in subclauses 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 and is -55 dBm
for co-ordinated mobiles and -35 dBm for uncoordinated.
Again -49 dBm has been proposed since the probability of the uncoordinated
scenario is low both spatially and spectrally. If the coupling loss between
both MSs and the BTS increases by 1dB the level of a third order IM product
will reduce by 3 dB, thus if the coupling loss assumption between MS and BTS
is increased by 5 dB to 70 dB then the scenario would be met.
A note concerning the VHF broadcast problem has been added as in subclause 4.7
for transmiiter intermodulation.
### A.8.5.3 Spurious response rejection
This section concerns exceptions to the blocking specification due to spurs in
the receive synthesizer and mixer causing spurious responses. The numbers of
exception channels has been doubled to reflect the wider receive band. For the
BTS the in-band blocking specification can cover frequency offsets of 95 MHz
depending on the receive frequency and including the 20 MHz extension of the
receive band defined in subclause 5.1. Thus the boundary between parts a and b
of the specification has been moved from 45 MHz to 95 MHz because the receive
band is now 50 MHz wider.
Following the above logic the breakpoint between parts a and b for the MS
should occur at -95 MHz and +115 MHz but in the interests of simplicity the
same breakpoint is proposed as for the BTS.
### A.8.5.4 Spurious emissions
Since the MS receiver spurious emissions are covered by the idle mode aspect
of 4.3.3 this section now only refers to the BTS.
## A.8.6 TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER PERFORMANCE
### A.8.6.1 Nominal error rates (NER)
The scenario requirement for the maximum received level at the MS is -26 dBm
(requirement 2.3.2). The figure of ‑23 dBm is also in approximate alignment
with the blocking specification at >3 MHz.
The required NER for the static channel above at -23 dBm has been increased to
½% in line with CR 28
Under multipath conditions the peak signal level exceeds the mean level. In
order to prevent significant clipping the maximum level under multipath
conditions has been set to -40 dBm. Multipath reception conditions occur when
there is no line of sight path and the received signal level is likely to be
lower.
The same specifications have been applied to the BTS receiver.
### A.8.6.2 Reference sensitivity level
Simulations of TU50 and HT100 at 1,8 GHz have been performed and table 1 has
been modified appropriately. The RA130 results at 1,8 GHz are taken from the
RA250 results at 900 MHz. Allowance has been made for enhanced bad frame
indication in accordance with CR 27.
The MS sensitivity has been relaxed by 2 dB to simplify the MS at the expense
of a slightly higher BTS power requirement, to balance the up and downlinks.
### A.8.6.3 Reference interference level
TU1.5 and RA 130 results at 1,8 GHz in table 2 are taken from TU3 and RA250 in
GSM 05.05 respectively. TU 50 at 1,8 GHz has been simulated and the results
are incorporated in the table. Allowance has been made for enhanced bad frame
indication in accordance with CR 27.
The effect of doubling the Doppler spread is in general to improve the
performance without FH due to increased decorrelation between bursts and to
slightly degrade performance with FH because the channel is less stationary
during the burst.
### A.8.6.4 Erroneous frame indication performance

**Title: Small Cell System Scenarios for GSM900.**
Source: Vodafone, UK
Introduction
Small cells are defined in GSM 03.30 as having antennas above median roof
height but below maximum, whereas Large cells have antennas above the maximum
roof height. Median roof heights vary with location, in particular between
City Centre and Suburban locations. Suburban median roof heights vary with
type of housing and may often be characteristic of a particular country but
are likely to fall between 8 m and 20 m.
Small cells feature much lower antennas than large cells and as such the
minimum coupling loss between base and mobile antenna is significantly
decreased. In practice small cells are likely to operate at a lower transmit
power level, being aimed at providing limited coverage, but not necessarily
capacity, in urban/suburban environments.
This paper presents the results of applying the propagation loss at 100m BTS
to MS antenna separation from the GSM 03.30 Small Cell example, to the system
scenarios in TDoc GSM 61/91 which details system scenarios for DCS1800. The
results are presented in a similar manner as TDoc GSM 60/91 and will be
applicable to a 75% location probability.
A further set of results is presented for the worst case scenario where the
agreed Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) of 59 dB from T.Doc SMG 49/91 is used.
Both sets of results assume a Class 2 coordinated and uncoordinated MS but the
effect of MS power control is taken into account for the coordinated MS.
**Small Cell Example**
The definition of the small cell example in GSM 03.30 annex A.4 is as follows.
* * *
Base TX Configuration  
Antenna Gain: +16 dBi (BAG) Antenna Height: 17 m  
Roof Height 15 m  
Antenna Feeder Loss: 2 dB (BFL)
* * *
* * *
Mobile RX Configuration  
Antenna Gain: 2 dBi (MAG) Antenna Height 1,5 m  
Antenna Feeder Loss: 2 dB (MFL) Propagation Loss  
Loss (dB) = 132,8 + 38 log(d/km)
* * *
The coupling loss for this scenario is then:
132,8 + 38 log(d/km) - BAG + BFL - MAG + MFL= 80,8 dB at a MS to base
separation of 100 m.
The system scenarios at 100 m are presented in Appendix 1.
**Minimum Coupling Loss Case**
The system scenarios based on the same small cell example as above but using a
MCL of 59 dB are presented in Appendix 2.
It should be noted that this produces worse case figures, assuming operation
at limit sensitivity, i.e. in a noise limited environment. For the small cell
case the MS at least, is likely to be operating in an interference limited
environment with an effective sensitivity worse than limit sensitivity.

Subject: **Microcell BTS RF Parameters**
Background
Since the Ronneby meeting of SMG2 there have been a number of input papers
concerning the specification of RP parameters for a microcell BTS. In
particular T.Docs 184/91, 16/92, 28/92, 80/92, 86/92 and 90/92 from AT&T NSI,
MPC, BTL and Alcatel propose specific RF parameters. At the Turin SMG2 meeting
it was agreed that the best way to include a microcell BTS specification into
the GSM recommendations was as an annex to GSM 05.05 that would specify:
\- Transmit powers.
\- Receive sensitivities.
\- Wideband noise.
\- Blocking.
It was also agreed that it would not be practical to specify a single
microcell BTS for all applications and that a number of BTS classes would need
to be specified. It was noted that this may require guidelines to be added to
03.30 to ensure successful operation.
_Scenario Requirements_
In order to clarify the requirements for microcell BTS RF parameters we must
first look at the scenario requirements. It was agreed at the Amsterdam
meeting that the 2 groups of scenarios were \'range\' and \'close proximity\'
as shown in figure 1.
**Range:**
The general requirements of the range scenario are that:
\- Maximum BTS receive sensitivity is required for some applications.
\- The uplink and downlink paths should be capable of being balanced.
It has been agreed that the COST 231 propagation model will be used for
microcell propagation when a fine of sight street canyon exist. This has been
included in GSM 03.30 for guidance (T.Docs 88/92 and 93/92). In order to
estimate the maximum, worst case path loss experienced by a microcell BTS we
would also have to define.
Table 2: Close Proximity Parameters

                                      GSM900   DCS1800
Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) 44 dB 50 dB Multiple Interferers Margin (MIM) 10
dB 10 dB C/I margin 9 dB 9 dB
* * *
Before we can calculate the scenario requirements shown in figure 1 we must
identify some further MS RF parameters in addition to those in table 1.
Table 3: Further MS RF Parameters
* * *
                                        GSM900 (class 5)   DCS1800 (class 1)
Most stringent blocking requirement ‑23 dBm ‑26 dBm Wideband noise emission in
200 kHz ‑44 dB ‑48 dB
* * *
NOTE: Currently no specification for GSM900 MS wideband noise beyond 1,8 MHz
offset and therefore figures proposed at Aalborg meeting used (as shown in
T.Doc 11 1/92).
The wideband noise figures in table 3 have been adjusted by 3 dB since they
are specified in a 100 kHz bandwidth in GSM 05.05 but are required in a
receiver bandwidth for the scenarios (200 kHz).
_BTS Tx power_
This requirement (as shown in figure 1) is the maximum microcell BTS transmit
power that can be tolerated in order to prevent MS blocking.
BTS Tx power = [MCL] \~ [blocking requirement].
GSM900 BTS Tx power = 44 + (‑23) = 21 dBm.
DCS1800 BTS Tx power = 50 + (‑26) = 24 dBm.
_BTS wideband noise_
This requirement (as shown in figure 1) is the maximum microcell BTS wideband
noise that can be tolerated in order to prevent MS \'noise masking\'. A signal
lever lOdB above limit sensitivity is taken.
BTS wideband noise (in 100 kHz) = [signal lever] ‑ [C/I margin] ‑ [MIM] +
[MCL] ‑ [200 - 100 kHz BW conversion].
GSM900 BTS wideband noise = (‑92) ‑ 9 ‑ 10 + 44 ‑3 = ‑70 dBm DCS1800 BTS
wideband noise = (‑90) ‑ 9 ‑ 10 + 50 ‑3 = ‑62 dBm.
\- Non fine of sight propagation model.
\- Log normal fading margin.
\- Rician fading margin.
\- Corner attenuation.
\- Building penetration loss.
To find the range from this path loss we would have to define the link budget
parameters such as antennae gains and cable losses. It is thought to be
impractical to define all these parameters as part of this work. However, if
we substitute some approximate numbers for the above parameters (such as those
in T.Doc 80/92) we can see that with ‑104 dBm receive sensitivity at the
microcell BTS worst case ranges could still be as low as 200 m to 300 m.
In order to define relationships for path balancing we need only to identify
the mobile RF parameters and any differences in the uplink and downlink paths
(e.g. diversity). The assumptions made here are:
\- Class 5 MS for GSM900 and Class 1 MS for DCS1800.
\- Same antennae used for transmit and receive at MS and BTS (therefore gain
cancers).
\- No diversity.
\- Path balancing performed for maximum MS transmit power (to give absolute
max. BTS transmit power required).
The following MS RF parameters are used:
Table 1: MS RF Parameter
* * *
            MS Tx power   MS Rx sensitivity
GSM900 29 dBm ‑102 dBm DCS1800 30 dBm ‑100 dBm
* * *
For balanced paths the uplink max path loss must equal the downlink max path
loss. In other words:
[MS Tx power] + [‑BTS Rx sens] = [BTS Tx power] + [‑MS Rx sens].
The following relationships can therefore be defined:
GSM900 [BTS Tx power] + 73 = ‑ [BTS Rx sensitivity].
DCS1800 [BTS Tx power] + 70 = ‑ [BTS Rx sensitivity].
**Close Proximity**
At the Amsterdam microcell sub‑group the Minimum Coupling Losses (MCL) for
Microcell BTS to MS coupling were agreed (T.Doc 41/92 Rev 1). Further work
showed that these figures were very worst case and had a low probability of
occurring (T.Doc 90/92). The following parameters will be used in the close
proximity scenarios.
_BTS blocking_
This requirement (as shown in Fig. 1) is the maximum signal lever that may be
presented to a microcell BTS from an uncoordinated MS.
BTS blocking level = [MS Tx power] ‑ [MCL].
GSM900 BTS blocking level = 29 ‑ 44 = ‑15 dBm.
DCS1800 BTS blocking level = 30 ‑ 50 = ‑20 dBm.
_BTS Rx sensitivity_
This requirement (as shown in figure 1) is the maximum receive sensitivity a
microcell BTS can have in order to prevent \'noise masking\' from an
uncoordinated MS.
BTS Rx sensitivity = [wideband noise from MS] + [C/I margin] ‑ [MCL].
GSM900 BTS Rx sensitivity = ‑44 + 9 ‑ 44 = ‑79 dBm.
DCS1800 BTS Rx sensitivity = \~8 + 9 ‑ 50 = ‑89 dBm.
_Practical specification_
So far, we have identified the requirements for the range and close proximity
scenarios for a microcell BTS. We now need to move towards a practical
specification.
_Microcell BTS Tx power and Rx sensitivity_
If we study the scenario requirements for transmit power and receive
sensitivity we find the following:
\- The Rx sensitivities needed to satisfy the close proximity scenarios are
much less those required for the range scenarios.
\- The Tx powers and Rx sensitivities from the close proximity scenarios lead
to a 15 dB downlink bias for GSM900 and a 5 dB downlink bias for DCS1800.
In order to satisfy both the path balance relationships in the range scenario
and the close proximity scenarios we can either reduce the Tx power or reduce
the Rx sensitivity even further. Since the Rx sensitivity is well short of the
range requirements already we shall choose to balance paths by reducing Tx
power. This gives the following Tx powers:
GSM900 BTS Tx power = ‑(‑79) + 73 = 6 dBm.
DCS1800 BTS Tx power = ‑(‑89) + 70 = 19 dBm.
However, if we want to specify microcell BTS classes with better Rx
sensitivities than these (and hence higher Tx powers) then the value for MCL
has to be increased in order to ensure the close proximity scenarios are
satisfied. Popular Rx sensitivities to choose in order to optimise microcell
BTS size and cost are ‑89 Bm and ‑95 dBm (from SMG2 input papers). Since the
limiting close proximity scenario is MS wideband noise masking the microcell
BTS receiver we must use this to determine the new MCL requirements as
follows:
MCL = [wideband noise from MS] + [C/I margin] ‑ [BTS Rx sensitivity].
Having clone this we can path balance to find the new Tx powers. These results
are shown in table 4.
Table 4: New MCLs with balanced Rx sens and Tx powers
* * *
            MCL     Rx sens    Tx power
GSM900 44 dB ‑79 dBm 6 dBm 54 dB ‑89 dBm 16 dBm 60 dB ‑95 dBm 22 dBm 69 dB
‑104 dBm 31 dBm DCS1800 50 dB ‑89 dBm 19 dBm 56 dB ‑95 dBm 25 dBm 65 dB ‑104
dBm 34 dBm
* * *
_Microcell blocting_
It has been agreed that by reducing the Rx sensitivity we do not want to imply
a relaxation in the blocking requirements for the microcell BTS. Therefore the
blocking values will simply be increased by the same amount as the Rx
sensitivity has decreased.
Table 5 Change in blocking requirement
* * *
            Rx sens    Change in blocking values
GSM900 ‑79 dBm +25 dB ‑89 dBm +15 dB ‑95 dBm +9 dB ‑104 dBm No change DCS1800
‑89 dBm +15 dB ‑95 dBm +5 dB ‑104 dBm No change
* * *
_Microcell BTS wideband noise_
The scenario requirement for wideband noise will obviously change with the
MCL. The wideband noise specification currently in GSM 05.05 is ‑80 dBc at
greater than 6 MHz offsets. For low Tx power BTSs a noise floor of ‑57 dBm is
specified for DCS1800 and 45 dBm (>6 MHz) for GSM900. Table 6 shows the
scenario requirements for wideband noise with the ‑80 dBc values (relative to
the microcell. Tx power ‑ not shown) and the current specification values
(i.e. either the ‑80 dBc or the noise floor value).
Table 6: Wideband noise requirements
* * *
            MCL     Scenario Requirement   ‑80 dBc values   Current Spec
GSM900 44 dB 70 dBm ‑74 dBm ‑45 dBm 54 dB ‑60 dBm ‑64 dBm ‑45 dBm 60 dB ‑54
dBm ‑58 dBm ‑45 dBm 69 dB ‑45 dBm ‑49 dBm ‑45 dBm DCS1800 50 dB ‑62 dBm ‑61
dBm ‑57 dBm 56 dB ‑56 dBm ‑55 dBm ‑55 dBm 65 dB ‑47 dBm ‑46 dBm ‑46 dBm
* * *
It can be seen that for DCS1800 the current specification satisfies the
scenario requirements. However, for GSM900 there is up to a 25 dB discrepancy.
A noise floor of ‑60dBm is proposed for GSM900 which would change the
specification to ‑60 dBm, ‑60 dBm, ‑58 dBm and ‑49 dBm in the top right hand 4
boxes of table 6. This meets the scenario requirement in three cases and
exceeds it by 10 dB in one case.
_Proposed changes to GSM recommendations_
The following changes have been Proposed to GSM 05.05.
Table 7: Microcell BTS Classes
* * *
            Microcell\   Tx power (dBm)   Rx sensitivity   Blocking\
            BTS Class                                      (rel to current)
GSM900 1 31 -104 No change
            2            22               -95              +9 dB
            3            16               -89              +15 dB
            4            6                -79              +25 dB
DCS1800 1 34 -104 No change
            2            25               -95              +9 dB
            3            19               -89              +15 dB
* * *
Although the longer classes came from the original MCL figures it is
recommended that certainly the GSM900 Class 4 BTS be removed as not practical
and possibly both Class 3 BTSs also. This is open for discussion.
We have also shown that:
\- The GSM900 MS wideband noise needs specifying to the band edge (as for
DCS1800 MSs) with values at least as good as those proposed in Aalborg.
\- The wideband noise floor for GSM900 microcell BTSs needs to be ‑60 dBm. No
change is required for DCS1800.
The following additions are proposed to GSM 03.30.
The recommended MCL values for the different microcell BTS classes should be
included in GSM 03.30 for guidance on installation. These MCL values are
connector to connector values and therefore include antennae effects. The
following should be added.
Table 8: Recommended MCLs
* * *
            Microcell BTS Class   Recommended MCL (dB)
GSM900 1 69 2 60 3 54 4 44 DCS1800 1 65 2 56 3 50
* * *
Removing the GSM900 Class 4 BTS would eliminate the 44 dB MCL from the table.
It can be seen that higher MCLs are needed for GSM900 than for DCS1800. This
will translate into even larger separations in the field due to the 6 dB fall
in path loss when moving from 1,8 GHz to 900 MHz The only way to restore this
balance is to specify a tighter MS wideband noise specification for GSM900
than that proposed in Aalborg.

Title: **Comments and Proposals on Microcell RF Parameters**
Having read the paper from BTL on this subject and as a result of discussions
with the author, the following additional comments and proposals have been
agreed with him.
1) uBTS classes can be defined to meet MCLs in 5 dB steps GSM {45, 50, 55, 60}
DCS {50, 55, 60}. This will aid the cell planner and manufacturers in choosing
appropriate equipment for a given ucell site. It is also simpler.
2) Since DCS1800 r.f. parameters were defined using the scenarios approach
used here for microcells, a DCS uBTS with a sensitivity of -104 dBm will be
identical to a permitted normal BTS and there is therefore little point in
defining it.
3) Diversity is possible in ucells. I suggest we allow 3 dB for this in the
uBTS maximum power.
4) Parameters which affect the uBTS receiver should meet the MCL. Those which
only affect the closest mobile can miss the MCL by 10 dB. The Telia research
measurements (SMG2 T.doc. 90/92) show that this 10 dB translates a 0,1%
probability to 10% probability of interference.
5) uBTS blocking should exceed the MCL requirement by 10 dB.
a) To allow for interfering signals from outside the system.
b) Because the consequences of the BTS being blocked are severe.
c) To improve the MCL performance with MSs which exceed their noise spec.
_Proposed Procedure for Defining the Parameters (Similar to the BTL paper)_
1) Choose uBTS sensitivity to match MS noise at MCL.
2) Choose uBTS power to balance links.
3) Set uBTS noise and blocking to be the same as for a normal BTS relative to
the power and sensitivity respectively.
4) Relax the uBTS noise and blocking where possible to the point where it just
meets the MCL requirements.
_Spread Sheets giving uBTS RF Parameters (figures 1 to 3)_
1) Microcell RF parameters proposed by BTL paper.
2) Parameters after stages 1-3 in the procedure above.
3) Proposed parameters after stages 1-4 above.
The final proposals are in figure 3. Notice that the class 1 uBTS can be
converted into a class 2 with the addition of 5 dB attenuators on transmit and
receive paths.

**Title: REVISED PROPOSALS FOR MICROCELL RF PARAMETERS**
The present document is an update to SMG2 T.doc 144/92 presented in Strasbourg
to include:
1) the new proposed GSM MS noise figures (note).
2) the method of interpreting GSM 05.05 subclause 4.2.1 agreed at the SMG2 ad
hoc in Malmesbury (a 2 dB correction).
The table below shows the calculation of the noise floor.
+---------+----------+-------------+--------------+----------+----------+ | | MS power | 4.2.1 table | at frequency | level in | level in | | | | | | | | | | | entry | offset | 100 kHz | 180 kHz | +---------+----------+-------------+--------------+----------+----------+ | **GSM** | 29 dBm | -71 dB | 1,8 MHz | -50 dBm | -43 dBm | +---------+----------+-------------+--------------+----------+----------+ | **DCS** | 30 dBm | -75 dB | 6 MHz | -53 dBm | -50 dBm | +---------+----------+-------------+--------------+----------+----------+
The conversion factor of total MS power to that measured in 30 kHz on carrier
is taken to be 8 dB rather than the 6 dB assumed for phase 1 DCS1800.
The revised proposals are shown in figure 1 and are otherwise calculated in
the same manner as described in SMG2 T.doc 144/92. Since the MS noise was the
limiting factor in close proximity performance, the change leads to a
significant improvement in the overall system especially for microcells.

###### ### Annex D: Conversion factors
**REPORT OF AD HOC MEETING ON RF PARAMETERS**
The aim of the meeting was to define BTS transmitter requirements that are
consistent with each other (TD 42/92), the following are the specifications
that were discussed:
\- Modulation Mask.
\- Switching Transients.
\- Spurious Emissions.
\- Intermodulation.
The following plan was agreed:
1\. Agree normalised measurement conversion numbers.
2\. Define the modulation mask based upon scenario requirements and what is
practically feasible.
3\. Define new specifications that provide consistent requirements and propose
these changes at the next SMG2 meeting in May.
**SCENARIO REQUIREMENTS**
MPC presented TD 46/92 that described the scenario requirements for DCS1800
which are derived from GSM TDs 60/91 and 61/91. The following principles are
contained in TD 46/92:
A) Specifications should satisfy the requirements of the system scenarios
unless evidence is presented that they are not practical.
B) Since all specifications must be met, only the most stringent is important.
C) So far as possible, a test should be the tightest constraint on what it is
intended to measure. for example, the 4.2.1 test on modulation and noise
should be the toughest requirement on these quantities.
The document proposes a change to the modulation mask at 1.8MHz offset to
align with the spurious test. It was also stated that the intra-
intermodulation requirement at 1.8MHz offset from carrier is tighter than the
modulation test, TD 46/92 proposed that the test be modified to say that if
the test failed, all carriers but the nearest one be switched off. If the
measured level remains the same then the failure can be attributed to
modulation and can be ignored. TD 46/92 also proposed a tightening of the
modulation requirement at 6MHz offset to comply with the scenario requirement.
There was much discussion on this subject and the values used in the scenario
were questioned particularly the Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) and the MS
threshold level. It was stated by Motorola that -65 dB appears to be too
stringent for MCL. AT&T stated that it was unusual to design coverageor
reference sensitivity at the cell boundary. AEG questioned the statistical
reasoning behind a tightening of the specification for modulation. It was
generally agreed that the more important scenario was with the BTS as the
victim and not the MS as the victim.
Vodafone presented TD 52/92 that covered the system scenarios for GSM900, the
MCL that was used for GSM900 was 59 dB. In conclusion it was recommended to
try to improve limits if at all possible.
**NORMALISATION OF CONVERSION NUMBERS**
The TDs presented were 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54 and 55/92. It was decided to
discuss TD 47/92 at the next SMG2 meeting. TD 48/92 (AT&T) was an updated
version of TD 42/92 including the normalisation numbers agreed at the
Amsterdam meeting of SMG2. TD 49/92 (CSELT) illustrates the differences
between peak and average in a 30 kHz bandwidth at different offsets using
three different commercial spectrum analysers. A bandwidth of 300 kHz is also
used but due to the low offset from carrier it was commented that a resolution
bandwidth of 300 kHz was too large to be accurate. TD 50/92 (France Telecom)
presented information on scaling factors to be used in the normalisation
process. From the plots provided in TD 50/92 evidently below 1,8 MHz offset
the resolution bandwidth has to be set to less than or equal to 30kHz for an
accurate representation of the signal. TD 51/92 (Vodafone) shows that an
additional allowance needs to be considered depending on the effect of a
particular kind of interference. The example shown is that switching
transients have an effect that is 20dB less than continuous interference,
therefore, a relaxation of modulation to allow consistency would have more of
an effect than a relaxation of switching transients. TD 53/92 (Cellnet)
investigates the propositions outlined in TD 42/92 using practical
measurements. The paper supports all the propositions of TD 42/92 apart from
one. TD 42/92 was in error in the description of the bandwidth used for the
average to peak conversion, this error had been corrected in TD 48/92. TD
54/92 (BTL) describes normalisation parameters derived from measurement and
states that the following measurements are equal to or below the modulation
mask; GSM900 switching transients beyond 1 200 kHz to 1 800 kHz, all in-band
spurious values and Intermodulation products less than 6 MHz are masked by the
modulation. TD 55/92 (Motorola) presents measured values of modulation at
various offsets, using an average 30 kHz bandwidth. Peak measurements using 30
kHz, 100 kHz and 300 kHz bandwidths at various offsets are also presented. The
conversion factors are then measured at varying offsets. On the basis of the
conversion tables in TD 55/92 it was stated that a 100kHz resolution bandwidth
is only meaningful at offsets greater than 1,2 MHz and a 300 kHz bandwidth is
only meaningful at offsets greater than 6MHz. This corresponds with the plots
in TD 50/92.
To derive the conversion numbers to be used in the normalisation process a
comparison of all the numbers presented to the meeting was discussed.
It was agreed that the conversion process would be combined into three
distinct steps, these steps are:
1\. Average in a 30kHz BW to peak in a 30 kHz BW. All offsets.
2\. Average in a 100kHz BW to peak in a 30 kHz BW. Offsets greater than or
equal to 1,8 MHz.
3\. Peak in a 300kHz bandwidth to peak in a 30 kHz bandwidth. Offsets greater
than or equal to 6 MHz.
During the meeting it was decided that a clarification of the definition of
peak hold is required in GSM 05.05 clause 4. MPC prepared a CR that stated
what had been decided at the meeting. However, there was no time to discuss
the CR and it will be presented at the next SMG2 plenary.

The agreed conversion factors are 8 dB at zero offset and 9 dB at all other

It was agreed that the conversion factor should be 5 dB at offsets above 1 800
kHz.
**Peak in a 300 kHz bandwidth to Peak in a 30 kHz bandwidth.**
No agreement was reached on this value so the working assumption as agreed at
SMG2 was assumed pending any further validation. The conversion factor is 8 dB
at offsets greater than or equal to 6 MHz.
**MODULATION MASK**
It was agreed that the title for subclause 4.2.1 should be changed to
\'Spectrum due to the Modulation and Wide band Noise\'.
In accordance with TD 46/92 (MPC) the modulation mask was tightened at 1
800kHz offset to align with the spurious requirement for DCS1800.

This was also agreed for GSM900.
It was also agreed to define the modulation mask beyond 1 800 kHz for GSM900
and the value specified would be the same as the present DCS1800 requirements.
To account for lower GSM900 power levels an additional note will be added to
4.2.1:
vi) For GSM900 BTS, if the limit according to the above table between 1 800
kHz to 6 MHz is below -40 dBm, a value of:
\- -40 dBm shall be used instead. If the limit above 6 MHz is below.
\- -45 dBm, a value of -45 dBm shall be used instead.
It was noted that this additional note for GSM900 was based upon an alignment
with the spurious requirement and the scenario requirement was not discussed.

**Title: Agreed SMG2 Conversion Factors**
Maximum peak power to average power in a 30 kHz bandwidth on carrier:
\- A conversion factor of -8 dB was agreed.
Average to Peak power in a 30 kHz bandwidth:
\- The agreed conversion factors are +8 dB at zero offset and +9 dB at all
other offsets.
Average in a 100 kHz bandwidth to Peak in a 30 kHz bandwidth:
\- It was agreed that the conversion factor shall be +5 dB at offsets above 1
800 kHz from carrier.
Peak in a 300 kHz bandwidth to Peak in a 30 kHz bandwidth:
\- No agreement was reached on this value so the working assumption as agreed
at SMG2 was assumed pending any further validation. The conversion factor is
-8 dB at offsets greater than or equal to 6 MHz.
Bandwidth conversion from 100 kHz to 300 kHz:
\- This was not discussed but a working assumption of +5 dB can be assumed at
greater than 1.8 MHz offset from carrier.
EXAMPLE: To calculate the absolute level of wideband noise for a GSM900 BTS at
greater than or equal to 1,8 MHz offset for BTS power greater than or equal to
+43 dBm measured in a 300 kHz bandwidth.
The specification is -75 dB (100 kHz bandwidth) relative to an average
measurement in a 30 kHz bandwidth at zero offset.
Therefore, the difference between peak power and average (30 kHz bandwidth) at
zero offset = +8 dB.
Therefore, the absolute level = BTS power(+43 dBm) - 8 - 75
= -40 dBm (100 kHz).
= -35 dBm (300 kHz).
The above conversion factors can also be used to compare all transmitter
parameters using a normalised peak measurement in a 30 kHz bandwidth.
###### ### Annex E: Repeater Scenarios
ETSI SMG2 ad-hoc \~ Tdoc. 24/94
Rome, 8 March 1994
**Title: REPEATER SCENARIOS FOR DCS1800**
Source: Mercury One-2-One
# E.1 INTRODUCTION
Repeaters represent a relatively low cost means of enhancing a network\'s
coverage in certain locations. Their behaviour is fundamentally different to
BTS\'s in that their output power levels are input level dependent. The RF
requirements for these repeater should therefore not be automatically derived
from existing BTS specifications, but rather should be derived from realistic
scenarios, with due attention paid to what is feasible and economically
reasonable to implement.
# E.2 REPEATER APPLICATIONS - OUTDOOR AND INDOOR
Mercury One_2_One considers that most repeater applications fall into two
types: outdoor and indoor.
In _outdoor_ applications there is normally a need to cover a limited outdoor
area into which propagation from existing cell sites is restricted due to
terrain or other shadowing effects. Minimum coupling losses from the repeater
to nearby MSs are similar to those for existing BTSs (65 dB), and the required
gain to provide a reasonable area of effective enhancement is of the order of
70 dB.
_Indoor_ applications are characterised by smaller minimum coupling losses (45
dB), and in order to avoid very high output powers towards the BTS as a result
of close-by MSs, the gain of such indoor repeaters is smaller and of the order
of 40 dB.
Both of these applications will be considered in more detail in the following
subclauses.
# E.3 OUTDOOR REPEATER SCENARIO
Figure 3 illustrates a typical outdoor repeater scenario.
{width="5.309722222222222in" height="2.109722222222222in"}
Figure 3: Outdoor Repeater Scenario
The repeater is typically located close to an area of marginal coverage (-95
dBm average signal strength at \"ground level). By placing a directional
antenna (20 dBi) on a tower (15 dB gain from extra height and shadowing
avoidance), the received signal strength can be increased around ‑60 dBm,
equivalent to a typical pattern loss between BTS and repeater antenna
connectors of 100 dB. A variation of 10 dB either side of this figure is
assumed to provide flexibility to deal with local site variations.
The minimum coupling loss between the MS and the repeater is assumed to be 65
dB, the same as a normal DCS1800 BTS.
Two cases for differing mobile locations with respect to the repeater are
shown in figure 3: an MS near to the repeater at the MCL values, and an MS at
the edge of the repeater coverage area. A diversity gain of; 3 dB is assumed.
The dynamic range of the repeater is seen to be 42 dB.
# E.4 OUTDOOR REPEATER PERFORMANCE Requirements
In this clause we consider the performance requirements for the outdoor
repeater scenario.
## E.4.1 Wideband Noise
The wideband noise requirement can be split into two separate case for inside
and outside of the repeaters gain bandwidth.
Within the gain bandwidth, a co-ordinated scenario is applicable, whereby the
noise should be an interference margin below the minimum signal likely be
output by the repeater. For the downlink, the permitted in‑repeater‑band noise
lever is therefore given by the following:
In-repeater-band Noise Level \ (1,5 x Output Power) - (0,5 x Intermodulation Product Power)
> (1,5 x 19) - (0,5 x -36)
> **+47,5 dBm**
For broadband repeaters with duplexors in which it is possible for
intermodulation products generated in the downlink direction to fall into the
uplink; repeater pass band, additional protection is required. The
intermodulation product at the MS end of the repeater should at least 9 dB
less than the minimum input levels for MSs at the edge of coverage served by
that repeater (-86 dBm in scenario considered, and -96 dBm for scenario with
90 dB BTS to repeater path loss).
In the uplink direction, the output power of the repeater when the MS at the
MCL distance is +15 dBm. The required third order intercept point is therefore
given by:
TOI > (Output Power) - (0,5 x Intermodulation Product Power)
> (1,5 x 15) - (0,5 x -36)
**> +40,5 dBm**
It should be noted that the above maximum uplink output of **+15 dBm** only
applies to powered‑down MSs. At the start of a call the MS will be at higher
power and this may cause a higher temporary intermodulation product if two
mobiles at the start of calls are both transmitting in the same timeslot. It
is recommended that this unlikely transient scenario is ignored.
## E.4.3 Output Power
In the downlink direction, the maximum single carrier output power of +19 dBm
with a BTS to repeater path loss of 90 dB needs to multiplied by a factor to
allow for the amplification of multiple carriers. If we assume 10 carriers,
this gives a maximum output power of the repeater, as determined by the 1 dB
compression point, of **+29 dBm**.
In the **uplink** direction, it is important that the repeater does not
seriously distort the initial access bursts transmitted at full power by a
nearby mobile. The required 1 dB compression point for correct amplification
of such bursts is therefore **+35 dB**.
## E.4.4 Blocking by Uncoordinated BTS
The bandedge filtering should provide adequate rejection of other operators
frequencies to ensure that the output power and intermodulation product
requirements specified in subclauses 4.2 and 4.3 are not exceeded if the
repeater is placed close to a BTS of a different operator.
In order to ensure this the limit to the gain for the operators channels is
given by:
Gain in other operator\'s band \ (1,5 x Output Power) - (0,5 x Intermodulation Product Power)
> (1,5 x -6) - (0,5 x -61)
**>** **+21,5 dBm**
For the uplink to minimise costs of the indoor repeater amplifiers, it is
proposed that the CEPT input of **-30 dBm** should apply to interrnodulation
products, rather than the **-36 dBm** GSM figure. This is justified on the
basis that the much smaller coverage area of the indoor enhancer will make it
unlikely for two MSs close to the enhancer to be using the same timeslot at
the same time.
In calculating the third order intercept point requirement for intermodulation
products the uplink repeater output lever in figure 5 is increased by 5 dB in
order to cover the case where the MS is not fully powered down. The third
order intercept point therefore becomes:
TOI > (1,5 x Output Power) - (0,5 x Intermodulation Product Power)
> (1,5 x 15) - (0,5 x -30)
> **+37,5 dBm**
## E.6.3 Output Power
In the downlink direction, allowing for ten carrier each at an output power of
-6 dB (value for BTS to repeater path loss of 95 dB), the maximum output
power, as determined the 1 dB compression point is **+4 dBm**.
**In the uplink** direction, as in the case of the outdoor repeater, it is
important that the repeater does not seriously distort the initial access
bursts transmitted at full power by a nearby MS. The required 1 dB compression
point for correct amplification of such bursts is **+30 dB**.
## E.6.4 Blocking by Uncoordinated BTS
The bandedge filtering should provide adequate rejection of other operators
frequencies to ensure that the output power and intermodulation product
requirements specified in subclauses 6.2 and 6.3 are not exceeded if the
repeater is placed close to a BTS of a different operator.
In order to ensure this the limit to the gain for the operators charnels is
given by:
Gain in other operator\'s band \ G = [BTS~A~_RXlev_max] - [MS~A~_TXpwr_min] + [CL1] + [CL2min]
Where MS~A~_TXpwr_min is the minimum transmit power for MS~A~ G the repeater
gain and BTS~A~_RXlev_max, the maximum allowed receive level at the BTS before
MS power control is applied. At the maximum coupling loss between MS~A~ and
repeater, CL2~A~max:
[MS~A~_TXpwr_max] - [CL2~A~max] + [G] - [CL1~A~] = [BTS~A~_sensitivity]
where MS~A~_TXpwr_max is the maximum MS transmit power for MS~A~ and
BTS~A~_sensitivity, the reference sensitivity Ievel for BTS~A~. The operating
dynamic range for MS~A~ is:
[CL2~A~max] - [CL2~A~min] = [MS~A~_TXpwr_max] - [MS~A~_TXpwr_min] -
[BTS~A~_sensitivity] + [BTS~A~_RXlev_max] Eq. 2
and the repeater output powers in the uplink; and downlink; directions given
by the equations:
Uplink operating power = [MS~A~_TXpwr_min] - [CL2~A~minl + [G]
Max. uplink RACH power = [MS~A~_TXpwr_max] - [CL2~A~min] + [G]
Downlink operating power = [BTS~A~_TXpwr] - [CL1~A~] + [G]
### E.7.2.2 Co-ordinated Scenario
In the co-ordinated scenario, MS~B~ is also power controlled by BTS~B~ through
the repeater. A similar analysis for BTS~B~, leads to the following equations
for the minimum MS transmit power, operating dynamic range and repeater output
powers:
[MS~B~_TXpwr_min] - [CL2~B~min]+[G] - [CL1B] = [BTS~B~_RXlev_max] Eq. 3
## [CL2~B~max] - lCL2~B~min] = [MSB_TXpwr_max] - [MSB_TXpwr_min]
[BT~B~_sensitivity] + [BTS~B~_RXIev_max] Eq. 4
Uplink operating power = [MS~B~_TXpwr_min] - ECL2~B~min] + [G]
Max uplink; RACH power = [MS~B~_TXpwr_max] - [CL2~B~min] + [G]
Downlink operating power = [BTS~B~_TXpwr] - [CL1~B~] + [G]
If the following assumptions are made:
MS~A~ TXpwr_max - MS~B~_TXpwr_max
CL2~A~min = CL2~B~min, and
BTS~A~_sensitivity = BTS~B~_sensitivity
Then, subtracting Equation 4 from Equation 2, and using equations 1 and 3 to
eliminate the minimum MS transmit powers leads to the difference in operating
dynamic range between the two systems:
[CL2~A~max] - lCL2~A~min] - ([CL2~B~max] - [CL2~B~min]) = CL1~B~ \- CL1~A~
It can be seen that both BTS~A~ and BTS~B~, must be equally coupled into the
repeater if the operating dynamic range is to be optimised for both donor BTS.
In the co-ordinated scenario the repeater would be configured to operate
across the whole of the GSM band.
### E.7.2.3 Uncoordinated Scenario
In the uncoordinated scenario, MS~B~ will not be power controlled through the
repeater. This is only true if the BTS‑repeater-MS path loss is greater than
the direct BTS-MS path loss.
It is important that the repeater wideband noise (see subclause 2.4) does not
desense an uncoordinated MS. The repeater gain to uncoordinated signals also
needs to be controlled, which will require filtering within the repeater
device. At the minimum coupling loss, the level of enhanced signal/WBN for an
uncoordinated MS should be at Ieast 9 dB lower than the uncoordinated wanted
signal level.
### E.7.2.4 Wideband Noise
Noise considerations are likely to limit the maximum useable gain of the
repeater. Considering thermal noise, in the GSM receiver bandwidth (assuming a
bandwidth in kHz), the noise output of a repeater with noise figure NF and
gain G is described by the equation:
Noise output in GSM Rx BW = -144 + 10*log(RX_BW) + G + NF
For low CL2min and high gains, the wideband noise generated by the MS may be
amplified by the repeater to a significant level. To prevent degradation of
the BTS receivers, the repeater gain will be limited to the minimum value of
G~1~ or G~2~ calculated from the following equations:
G~1~ = [BTS sensitivity] - [C/I margin] - [MS WBN in Rxr BW] + [CL2min] +
[CL1]
G~2~ = [BTS sensitivity] - [C/I margin]+[CL1] - (-1)4 + 10*log(RX_BU))-[NF]
### E.7.2.5 3rd order Intermodulation (IM3) performance/Spurious emissions:
If N carriers, each with outp^ut^ powers RPT_TXpwr, are amplified by a
repeater with a 3rd order intercept point ICP, the highest level of 3rd order
intermodulation tones produced ^PI^~M3~ is given by the formula:
P~IM3~ = RPT_TXpwr - 2(^IC^P - [RPT_TXpwr]) + 20 log (N/2)
Therefore, to meet the CEPT limits of -36dBm below 1 GHz and -30 dBm above 1
GHz, the repeater should have an output intercept point calculated as follows:
ICP = (3*[RPT_TXpwr] - [CEPT limit])/2 + 10log(N/2)
Where an IM3 tone is generated in the duplex passband, sufficient isolation is
required between the duplex paths of the repeater to prevent re-amplification
of the IM3 product in the duplex path. The requirement on the BTS IM3 products
in the BTS receive band of -91 dBm exists to protect the BTS receivers from
their respective transmitters and co-located operators BTS transmitters. In
practice close coupling between a BTS and repeater should be avoided if
spurious/IM3 products or wideband noise from a BTS is not to be amplified by
the high repeater gain. Therefore, the -91 dBm BTS requirement is not
necessary for the repeater. With careful planning of the repeater site the
CEPT limits are sufficient.
Spurious emissions should meet the -36 dBm CEPT requirement.
In normal operation, the IM3 products generated by the repeater will be
largely due to intermodulation between BCCH/TCH bursts. However, during RACH
bursts increased levels of IMP will be produced in the uplink path. Automatic
gain control (AGC) that is activated at a threshold above the normal uplink
operating power may be necessary to prevent these increased levels from
exceeding the CEPT limits.
The AGC threshold will be set 3 dB above the maximum allowed power per tone
for two tones whose IM3 products just meet the CEPT limits. Careful design of
the attack and delay characteristics of the AGC is required to prevent adverse
interactions with MS power control and this is for further study. When AGC is
activated, all channels operating, through the repeater will be subject to a
gain reduction.
## E.7.3 Repeater scenarios
Example repeater scenarios are presented below. The figures have been
calculated using the equations derived in clauses 2 and 3.
### E.7.3.1 Rural scenario
Typical parameters for a repeater operating in a rural environment are:
CL1: 90 dB
CT2min: 75 dB
MS_TXpwr_max: 39 dBm (class 2)
MS_sensitivity: -104 dBm
BTS_TXpwr 43 dBm
BTS_Rxlev_rnax: -70dBm
Repeater noise figure 8 dB
N (no of carriers) 4
Assuming that the MS is powered controlled clown to 30 dBm at CL2min
(MS_TXpwr_min = 30 dBm), the repeater operating parameters are as follows:
Dynamic range: 43 dB
Gain: 65 dB
Uplink operating power: 20 dBm
Downlink operating power: 18 dBm
Min. 3rd order ICP 51 dBm (based on 20 dBm operating power)
### E.7.3.2 Urban Scenario
Typical paramet^er^s for a repeater operating in a rural environment are:
CL1: 80 dB
CL2min: 45dB
MS_TXpwr_max: 33 dBm (class 4)
MS_sensitivity: -102 dBm
BTS Txpwr: 36 dBm
BTS_Rxlev_max: -70 dBm
Repeater noise figure 6 dB
N (no of carriers) 2
Assuming that the MS is powered controlled down to 20 dBm at CL2min
(MS_TXpwr_rnin = 20 dBm), the repeater operating parameters are as follows:
Dynamic range: 47 dB
Gain: 35 dB
Uplink; operating power: 10 dBm
Downlink; operating power: -9 dBm
Min. 3rd order ICP 36 dBm
## E.7.4 Summary
It has been illustrated how repeater devices operate in th^e^ co-ordinated and
uncoordinated environments. Example figures have been presented based on urban
and rural scenarios. The following repeater specification and planning
considerations are proposed.
### E.7.4.1 Repeater Specification
**Selectivity out of band (i.e. outside the GSM band):**
Offset from band edge Filter rejection
1 Mhz 30 dB
2 MHz 50 dB
**Spurious Emissions (including wideband noise):**
Below 1 GHz: less than -36 dBm measured in 100 kHz bandwidth.
Above 1Ghz: less than -30 dBm measured in 100 kHz bandwidth.
**Intermodulation products:**
Below 1 GHz: less than -36 dBm measured in 100 kHz bandwidth.
Above 1 Ghz: less than -30 dBm measured in 100 kHz bandwidth.
### E.7.4.2 Planning considerations
The following planning rules are proposed:
**-** Where a number of BTS operate through a repeater, operators must
consider carefully the coupling between BTS and repeater. The operating
dynamic range will only be optimised for all BTS when they are equally coupled
into the repeater.
**-** When selecting a repeater site consideration needs to be given to the
proximity of the repeater to uncoordinated BTS. IM3 products/WBN generated in
the BTS receive band by the repeater may be transmitted at a level defined by
the CEPT limit. This requires a minimum coupling loss:
[CL1min] = [CEPT limit] - [BTS sensitivity] + [C/l margin]
Below 1 GHz this equates to 77 dB. Where IM3 products generated by the
repeater are the limiting factor, separate repeater transmit and receive
antennas can be used to reduce the minimum coupling loss.
**-** For co-ordinated MS, the maximum repeater gain shall be the minimum
value of G~1~, G~2~ and G~3~, calculated from the following equations.
G~1~ = [BTS sensitivity] - [C/l margin] - [MS WBN in Rxr BW] + [CL2min] +
[CL1]
G~2~ = [BTS sensitivity] - [C/l margin] + [CL1] - ()144 + l0*log(RX_BW)) -
[NF]
G~3~ = [BTS~A~_RXlev_max] - [MS~A~_TXpwr_min] + [CL1] + [CL2min]
**-** For uncoordinated MS, filtering is necessary to reject the uncoordinated
frequencies from the repeater. When selecting a repeater site, operators
should implement sufficient filtering of uncoordinated frequencies to ensure
that the following is satisfied. At CL2min (the minimum coupling loss between
MS and repeater), uncoordinated frequencies enhanced by the repeater shall be
at last 9 dB below the wanted signals of the uncoordinated operator.
**-** These factors will require review during the lifetime of the repeater to
account for the developments in both the co-ordinated and uncoordinated
networks.

Repeater characteristics and GSM 03.30‑RPT Version Annex D PLANNING GUIDELINES
FOR REPEATERS. There is also text describing the background to the
requirements.
GSM 05.05 annex E (normative): Repeater characteristics
## E.7.5 Out of band Gain
The following requirements apply at all frequencies from 9 kHz to 12,75 GHz
excluding the GSM/DCS 1800 bands defined in GSM 05.05 and declared by the
manufacturer as the operational bands for the equipment.
The out of band gain in both directions through the repeater shall be less
than +25 dB at [5] MHz and greater from the GSM and DCS1800 band edges. The
repeater gain shall fall to 0 dB at [10] Mhz and greater from the GSM and DCS
1800 band edges.
In special circumstances additional filtering may be required out of band and
reference should be made to GSM 03.30.
### E.7.6 Planning guidelines for repeaters
## E.7.7 Indoor Repeater Scenario
For equipment used inside public buildings where other communication systems
could operate in very close vicinity (less than [5]m) of the repeater
,antennas special care must be taken such that out of band signals are not re-
radiated from within the building to the outside via the repeater system and
vice versa. When using repeaters with an antenna mounted on the outside of a
buildings the effect of any additional height gain should be considered. If
the close coupled communication system is usually constrained, within the
building it may be necessary to consider the negation of building penetration
loss when planning the installation. It is the operator\'s responsibility to
ensure that the out of band gain of the repeater does not cause disruption to
other existing and future co-located radio communication equipment. This can
be done by careful, choice of the repeater antennas and siting or if
necessary, the inclusion of in-line filters to attenuate the out of band
signals from other systems operating in the close vicinity of the repeater.
The following equation can be used to ensure an adequate safety margin in
these cases:
G~sys~ ≤ G~com_3~ + CL~3~ - M~s~
Where G~sys~ is the out of band repeater gain plus the gain of external
repeater ,antenna less the cable loss to that antenna. G~com~_~3~ is the
antenna gain of the close coupled communication [ ]{.underline} system (use
2dBi if not known).CL~3~ is the measured or estimated out of band coupling
loss between the close coupled communication system and the repeater (terminal
to terminal) and M~s~ is the safety margin which should include the height
gain of the external repeater antenna plus, if appropriate, the out of band
building penetration loss (use 15dB If not known). See above.
**REPEATER OUT OF BAND REQUIREMENT BACK GROUND**
Consider the signals passing between two systems, which could be any desired
radio communication systems (eg. mobile to base) or incompatible systems (eg.
two different mobiles or bases operating on the same frequency). There will be
a path loss between these systems which we need to ensure is not significantly
affected by the addition of a GSM/DCS repeater in the environment. These
systems are uncoordinated with GSM/DCS and the words _out_ _of band are_ used
below to refer to the repeater performance outside of the allocated GSM/DCS
bands. See below.
{width="6.1in" height="2.7in"}
Taking the simple outdoor case first and assuming a general propagation loss
model of the form C +klog(r) the total gain budget between System A and System
B via a repeater system with out of band gain G~sys~ (which includes antenna
gain) is:
-pL~ar~ + G~sys~ - PL~rb~ = -2C - k(log x + log y) + G~sys~ dB
Where x is the distance from System A to the repeater system and y is the
distance between the repeater and System B.
Thus the minimum total path loss occurs when either x or y is at its minimum
value independent of the propagation type. In other words the worse case
situation will arise when the repeater is physically close to one or other of
the systems (A or B). In this case the \"direct\" path loss pL~ab~ can be
assumed to be very similar to the path loss from the repeater system to the
far system excluding, for the moment, any differences in the height gain.
i.e.: pL~ab~ ≅ pL~rb~ for System A close to the repeater System.
The coupling losses between the radio stations in each system will also depend
upon the respective antenna gains. In the following situation a repeater and
Station A are closely coupled.
{width="5.1in" height="3.3in"}
Since the path loss between System B and the repeater (pL~rb~) and System A
and B (pL~ab~) is similar for a closely coupled situation it is useful to
compare the EIRP of a signal transmitted from Station A with the signal re-
transmitted from the repeater.
EIRP~A~ = P~TX~ + G~ANT~_~1~
EIRP~R~ = P~TX~ - C~ar~+ G~R~+ G~ANT~_~3~
Where C~ar~ is the close coupling loss between the terminals of System A and
the repeater, G~R~ is the gain of the repeater in the direction A to B,
G~ANT_1~ and G~ANT_3~ are the gain of Ant_1 and Ant_3 respectively (including
cable loss).
If we constrain EIRP~R~ to be less than EIRP~A~ by a safety margin M~s~ dB to
\"protect\" System B against height gain differences between Ant_1 and Ant_3
and any other implementation factor we wish to include (eg: building
penetration losses) then:
EIRP~R~ + M~S~ + EIRP~A~
And the repeater gain at a given frequency out of band should be:
GR ≤ G~ANT~_~1~ + C~ar~ - G~ANT~_~3~ - M~S~
The above also holds for the effect of System B upon A if the value of
repeater gain out of band in the direction B to A is substituted for G~R~.
This value of gain would ensure that an out of band system would see an added
component via the repeater no greater than the \"direct\" path. This must be
considered further for the case when the systems A and B are part of a desired
radio communication link. The worse case scenario would be if a direct sine of
sight exists between Ant_4 and Ant_1 and also Ant_3, producing strong Rayleigh
fading. Although this is unlikely since Ant_1 and Ant_2 must be closely
coupled and Ant_2 must be physically remote from Ant_3 to achieve the desired
isolation in band operators should take steps to avoid this occurrence. In a
typical urban situation a large number of multipath components are more likely
and the effect of the repeater would be to increase the signal mean (about 3
dB?) and erode some of the fade margin. This should be well within the
implementation margin of all mobile communication systems. It is not
anticipated that static communication systems would suffer either (however if
the unforeseen case arose the repeater antenna could be easily re-sited to
give the required isolation). Note that the susceptible area will depend upon
the directional properties of Ant_3 and therefore will be smaller for a higher
gain antenna.
Since the out of band frequency response adjacent to the inband frequencies
will be the most design critical the values for parameters in band are used
for the out of band frequencies. Thus the values given in GSM 03.30 can be
used in the limiting case to calculate the safety margin for the adjacent out
of band systems.
Taking the scenario for a repeater antenna mounted on a building or tower with
undesired close coupling between an out of band system and the repeater at
ground lever, GSM 03.30 gives a value for height gain of 9 dB for a change in
reference height from 1.5 to 10 m. A safety margin of +9dB is proposed for the
outdoor case.
A practical figure of 50dB for the close coupling (terminal to terminal) is
proposed for C~ar~. The worst case re-radiation of undesired signals arises
when the gain of Ant_3 is much larger than the gain of Ant_1, therefore the
following figures are used to calculate the out of band gain for the repeater
from the equation above:
M~S~ = +9 dB
C~ar~ = 50 dB
G~ANT_3~ = +18 dBi
G~ANT_1~ = +2 dBi
**This gives the maximum bi-directional out of band gain for the repeater as
+25 dB for the worst outdoor case.**
In the vast majority of cases the coupling loss between the repeater and the
out of band communication system will be greater than 50 dB and the safety
margin accordingly much higher. For out of band frequencies far from the
inband frequencies the safety margin above will not degrade therefore a roll
off in the repeater response does not seem to be necessary but has been
included in the specification to avoid leaving the gain wideband and
uncontrolled. Further study is required to check that transmitted power levers
from out of band systems will not compromise the in-band performance with this
level of gain.
**In-building Public, Case**
The scenario below is relevant to a repeater installed in a public building
where other out of band communication systems may be operating in close
vicinity. If close coupling between an indoor out of band system and a
repeater with an externally mounted antenna takes place the normal building
penetration loss are not experienced by the out of band system, this will
affect the safety margin. Figures for building penetration losses are
notoriously varied and a range of values for building penetration losses are
discussed in GSM 03.30. A value of 15 dB is proposed as representative.
Building penetration losses tend to increase with frequency and this will
affect the safety margin. On the other hand path losses are greater at higher
frequencies so that the areas that might be affected are smaller. It is
possible that the externally mounted repeater antenna may have additional
height gain if it is mounted on an upper floor. In these cases it is the
responsibility of the operator to ensure that close coupling between an out of
band system and the repeater is avoided or reduced to cause no disruption to
other radio communication systems.
Because of the range in operational and installation possibilities it is more
appropriate to give general guidance in GSM 03.03 on the use of in-building
repeaters rather than a specify a gain figure for indoor applications. A
simple formulae to estimate the maximum gain the repeater should be set to is
given in GSM 03.30 to allow the operator to plan installations on a site by
site basis.
###### ### Annex F: Error Patterns for Speech Coder Development
# F.0 Introduction
This annex attempts to summarise all necessary background information for
\"Error Patterns for Speech Codec Development\", (Change request SMG 117/96 to
GSM 05.50, SMG2 TDoc 164/95). The annex contains information on the file
structure and the usage of given soft decision values.
# F.1 Channel Conditions
The number of test conditions have to be limited in order not to have to many
subjective test conditions. Therefore pure rayleigh fading has been chosen as
a propagation condition. This condition represents all multipath conditions
which have a delay spread significant shorter than one bit period (3,7 μs).
Therefore the pure rayleigh fading statistics of bit errors is similar to
those of TU and RA ( although this is a rice statistic) propagation
conditions. Even for HT the energy of pathes with big delay is small compared
to the energy transmitted in the first bit period. Therefore the HT bit error
statistics is not so far away from pure rayleigh fading. Significant
differences can be expected for EQ conditions or a real two path model with
equal strength of both pathes. Nevertheless pure rayleigh fading seems to be
sufficient for speech codec optimization.
For the FH case vehicular speed within one time slot is assumed to be zero and
consecutive time slots are completely decorrelated ( ideal FH ). It has to be
noted that up to 200 / 100 km/h for GSM /DCS the variation of the channel
impulse response within one time slot can be neglected. Also for RA250 / 130
the effect is not very big. Therefore no vehicle speed within one time slot is
a reasonable assumption. Complete decorrelation of consecutive time slots can
be achieved by a vehicle speed of 70 / 35 km/h for GSM/ DCS without FH or by
FH over a sufficient frequency range depending on the vehicular speed (4
frequencies spread over 10 Mhz should be sufficient to achieve almost ideal FH
performance at low vehicular speed). Therefore ideal FH is a good assumption
for a lot of cases in GSM. Especially at the beginning of GSM FH is not always
available. Therefore for TCH / HS development two error patterns without FH
and 3 km/h were provided.
As a disturbance source co-channel interference has been chosen .It can be
stated that the bit error statistics for the noise and adjacent channel
interference is similar to co-channel interference. Therefore this condition
is sufficient for codec development.
## F.1.1 Simulation Conditions
All simulations are based on floating point calculations in all parts of the
transmission chain. No quantization effects are taken into account. Channel
filtering is assumed in order to achieve the performance for co-and adjacent
channel performance. No tolerance of the filter bandwidth are taken into
account . The equalizer consists of a 16 state viterbi equalizer.
## F.1.2 Available Error Patterns
For TCH/ HS 6 error patterns were available. They are described in the
attached documents from 1991. Due to the fact that this error patterns are not
available anymore at ETSI 4 new patterns with ideal FH and co-channel
interference have been produced and will be distributed SEG ( 4 dB, 7 dB, 10
dB and 13 dB).
# F.2 Test Data for the half rate speech coder
## F.2.1 File description
This section gives a description of the test pattern available for the
development of the half rate speech coder and the associated channel coding.
All files mentioned in the present document are recorded on 1600 BPI.
There are six different test patterns : EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, EP5 and EP6. Two
files are available for each error pattern. The first one contains the soft
decision values and chip errors and the second the error patterns of the
corresponding TCH / FS channel. All test patterns are generated under the
condition of rayleigh fading and co-channel interference.
EP1/ 2 / 3 are without any speed ( no doppler spectrum ) but with frequency
hopping over an unlimited number of frequencies. This means, that the fading
of different time slots is uncorrelated.
EP4 and EP5 is without frequency hopping and the mobile speed is 3 km/h.
EP6 is with a random input (noise ).
In the following table the file names are given for each test pattern.
* * *
Test pattern File name\ File name\ Soft decision values\ Error pattern\ and
chip error patterns TCH / FS

EP6 SDCEPRAN_1.DAT EPTCHFSRAN_1.DAT
* * *
## F.2.2 Soft decision values and chip error patterns
Each file consists of 6 001 records with a fixed record length of 512 byte.
The program RCEPSD.FOR can read these files (FORTRAN 77). The error patterns
and soft decision values of selected records are written to SYS\$OUTPUT. The
first record contains some parameters of the simulation in the order as
described in the following:
1\. NTSLOT : number of times slots (INTEGER*4)
2\. EBN : Chip energy divided by noise density (REAL*4)
if greater than 50 no noise at all
3\. SIDB : co-channel interference C/I (REAL *4)
if greater than 50 no interference at all
4\. LFN : Indication frequency hopping (LOGICAL* 4)
=.TRUE with frequency hopping
=.FALSE. without frequency hopping
In the following records the time slots of a GSM full rate TCH are stored (
two half rate channels). The test data are starting at the beginning of a
26-frame multiframe. One record contains four time slots and each time slot
consists of 2*57=114 bytes ( one byte for one info chip of a time slot). The
last 56 byte of each record are not used. Each byte contains a seven bit
integer value and a sign ( twos complement representation, range -128 to 127).
This data representation is supported by VAX FORTRAN 77 BYTE representation.
The soft decision value of a demodulated chip can be calculated by dividing
the stored integer value by eight and by taking the absolute value. If the
chip is demodulated correctly, the sign is positive and in the case of an chip
error the sign is negative. The soft decision information is given by the
following equation:
sd _= -_ ln(P~e~ /(1-P~e~ ))
P~e~ _-_ error probability of a chip
In the case of a TCH/FS the error patterns can be used in the following way
(multiplication of the bits with the soft decision values including the sign).
{width="5.3in" height="2.2in"}
Figure F.1
The input of the Viterbi decoder can be used for the metric computation in the
usual way. For the TCH / HS the error patterns can be used in the same way for
convolutional coding. If block codes with hard decision only are used the soft
decision has to be exchanged by the hard decision value.
## F.2.3 Error patterns of corresponding TCH/FS
These error patterns are generated from the soft decision values described
above. They consist of the error positions of the speech frames. The program
REPTCHFS.FOR can read files containing error patterns of a TCH / FS (FORTRAN
77). The record length used in the files is not fixed. The following table
gives the structure of the file. Each line is one record:
NBITCI, NBICHII, IDUMMY 3 values INTEGER*4
NLOOP 1 value INTEGER*4
LFH 1 value LOGICAL*4
EBN 1 value REAL*4
SIDB 1 value REAL*4
DUMMY 1 value REAL*4
ILOOP 1 value INTEGER*4
NFEHLERG, IED 2 values INTEGER*2
IFV(I), I=1,.....,NFEHLER NFEHLERG values INTEGER*4
ILOOP 1 value INTEGER*4
NFEHLERG, IED 2 values INTEGER*2
IFV(I), I=1,.....,NFEHLER NFEHLERG values INTEGER*4
ILOOP 1 value INTEGER*4
NFEHLERG, IED 2 values INTEGER*2
IFV(I), I=1,.....,NFEHLERG NFEHLERG values INTEGER*4
-1 1 value INTEGER*4
PFEHLCI,PFEHVCII,DUMMY 3 values REAL*4
In the following example the variables are described with more details:
NBITCI - number of bits in class I
NBITCII - number of bits in class II
EBN, SIDB, LFH - as described above
NLOOP - number of the next speech frames
ILOOP - position of the next speech frame with bit errors
1 i= ILOOP i= NLOOP
NFEHLERG - number of errors in this speech frame
IED - bad frame indication of this speech frame
= 1 : bad frame detected
= 0 : no bad frame detected
IFV (I) - array with all error positions in this speech
frame:
possible positions of class I : 1,....,182
possible positions of class II : 183,....,260
PFEHLCI - error probability class I
PFEHLCII - error probability class II
DUMMY,
IDUMMY - these values have no information
(for compatibility reasons necessary)
Speech frames without any errors are not included in the error pattern.
The number of correct speech frames can be calculated by the difference of
numbers ILOOP. The end of the error pattern is indicated by the ILOOP =-1.
In the data delivered by the TCH / FS speech coder bits have to be changed at
the positions indicated in the error patterns.
###### ### Annex G: Simulation of Performance
# G.1 Implementation Losses and Noise Figure
All simulations are based on floating point calculations in all parts of the
transmission chain. No quantization effects are taken into account. Channel
filtering is assumed in order to achieve the performance for co.- and adjacent
channel performance. No tolerance of the filter bandwidth are taken into
account. In order to cover the performance of a real receiver an additional
implementation margin of two dB shall be allowed. This means, that a simulated
value at 7 dB C/I~c~ corresponds to the performance of a real receiver at 9 dB
C/I~c~. Taking a reasonable noise figure (8 dB) into account a simulated value
of 6 dB Eb/N0 corresponds to the performance of a real receiver at 8 dB Eb/N0
which corresponds to the ref. Sensitivity input level of GSM 05.05.
## G.1.1 Assumed Equalizer
The equalizer consists of a 16 state viterbi equalizer.
## G.1.2 Accuracy of Simulations
At very low error rates the accuracy of the simulations become poor. The
following table gives the lowest error rate for a certain GSM channel at which
error rates can be taken from the simulations.
TCH / F4.8 10^-4^
TCH / F2.4 10^-5^
TCH / H2.4 10^-4^
In case that a simulated value is below the given minimum in the curves the
minimum is indicated.
## G.1.3 Simulation Results
Figures 1 to 18 show the performance (simulated values) for ref.sensitivity

# G.2 Reference Structure
The reference configuration with respect to channel coding is according to
\'Proposed text for draft Recommendation GSM 05.03\', August 1994 from Alcatel
(vers. 4.1.2H). \'Most recent text for subclause 3.2 of GSM 05.03\', Motorola,
September 1994 contains a slightly modified interleaving scheme\'. This means
the exchange of the ,mapping of bits on even and odd positions within a time
slot. It can be stated that the performance is independent from the
modification.
In the following the most significant bits of class I which are protected by a
CRC code are called class Ia. The other bits of class I are called class Ib.
The terms FER and RBER have the same meanings described in GSM 05.05 for the
TCH/FS.
## G.2.1 Error Concealment
Error concealment is done in a way as described in the TCH/HS C-code which is
provided by Motorola. This means that bad frames are detected by the CRC and
an additional criterium in the channel decoder. Computation of FER and RBER
includes the use of both criteria. Therefore no specification of the α factor
is required. In addition the UFI according to the ANT proposal is calculated.
It has to be noted that the present document does not include additional BFI
according to a set UFI flag and an inconsistency in the speech codec data.
This means that type approval and testing has to be done only with BFI and UFI
indication given by the channel decoder.
## G.2.2 Implementation Losses and Noise Figure
All simulation are based on floating point calculations in all parts of the
transmission chain.
No quantization effects are taken into account. Channel filtering is assumed
in order to achieve the performance for co.-and adjacent channel performance.
No tolerance of the filter bandwidth are taken into account. In order to cover
the performance of a real receiver an additional implementation margin of two
dB shall be allowed. This means, that a simulated value at 7 db C/I~c~
corresponds to the performance of a real receiver at 9 dB C/I~c~.
Taking a reasonable noise figure (8 dB) into account a simulated value of 6 dB
Eb/NO corresponds to the performance of a real receiver at 8 dB Eb/NO which
corresponds to the ref. Sensitivity input level of GSM 05.05.
## G.2.3 Assumed Equalizer
The equalizer consists of a 16 state viterbi equalizer.
## G.2.4 Simulation Results
All simulations are based on 40 000 simulated speech frames. Figures 1 to 15
show the performance (simulated values) for ref. sensitivity and interference
propagation conditions. The FER and RBER class Ib and II is given.
Furthermore the probability that the BFI or UFI is set is given: FER (BFI or
UFI). A RBER class Ib is given for those frames which have not a BFI or UFI
indication (bit error in those frames which are considered not to be bad or
unreliable ): UFI RBER class Ib.
## G.2.5 Proposed Values for Recommendation GSM 05.05
The following values are proposed for ref. Sesitivity of GSM900 in GSM 05.05.

It has to be noted that for the static case the error rates for FER, UFI and
RBER class Ib are so low that an upper bound according to the simulation
results at 3 dB E~b~ / N~o~ has been taken.
The following values are proposed for ref. Interference of GSM900 in GSM

* * *
For a ramdom RF input the overall reception performance shall be such that, on
average less than one undetected bad speech frame ( false bad frame indication
BFI) in 10 s will be measured.
# G.3 Simulation of performance for AMR
This clause provides some background information about the simulation results
of AMR reference sensitivity and interference performance given in GSM 05.05.
The simulations were carried out jointly by Ericsson, Nokia and Siemens.
## G.3.1 System Configuration
The reference system for AMR channel coding simulation is configured according
to GSM 05.03. The simulations were carried out by using the simulator
developed for the AMR qualification and selection.
## G.3.2 Error Concealment
Computation of FER and RBER relies on the CRC only. In other words, no other
mean than the CRC have been used to identify bad frames.
## G.3.3 Implementation Losses and Noise Figure
All simulations are based on floating point calculations in all parts of the
transmission chain. No quantization effects are taken into account. Channel
filtering is assumed in order to achieve the performance for co- and adjacent
channel performance. No tolerance of the filter bandwidth are taken into
account. In order to cover the performance of a real receiver an
implementation margin of two dB shall be allowed. This means that a simulated
value at 7 dB C/I~c~ corresponds to the performance of a real receiver at 9 dB
C/I~c~. Accordingly, the \"-3dB\" C/I~c~ condition was simulated at 4 dB
C/I~c~ and the \"+3dB\" C/I~c~ condition at 10 dB C/I~c~.
Taking a reasonable noise figure (8dB) into account, a value of 6 dB E~b~/N~0~
was used to simulate the performance of a real receiver at 8 dB E~b~/N~0~
which corresponds to the Reference Sensitivity input level of GSM 05.05.
## G.3.4 Assumed Equalizer
The equalizer which is imbedded in the ETSI AMR radio simulator consists of a
16 state Viterbi equalizer.
## G.3.5 Simulation Methods
A total of 200 000 frames of data were used for each simulated condition.
Correspondingly, the soft error patterns used in the simulations were 200 000
speech frames long. The ETSI (AMR) radio simulator was used to generate the
necessary error patterns. The same error pattern generated for a propagation
condition (e.g. TU50 no FH at 7 dB C/I~c~) was used to simulate all types of
channel (TCH/AFS12.2, TCH/AFS10.2, TCH/AFS7.9, TCH/AHS7.9, ...).
### G.3.5.1 Simulation for speech
Random data of 200 000 speech frames were used as input data of channel
encoder.
### G.3.5.2 Simulation for DTX
The performance of the SID update transmission was simulated by calculating
EVSIDUR (Erased Valid SID_UPDATE frame Rate) associated to an adaptive speech
traffic channel. In DTX testing we must ensure that codec continuously
operates in discontinuous transmission mode and this was achieved by
connecting all zero signal into speech codec input.
EVSIDUR figures were derived by taking frame classification for each
transmitted SID_UPDATE frame and counting the number of incorrect
classifications respect to the total amount of the transmitted SID_UPDATE
frames. Transmission period of SID_UPDATE frames was 6 frames in TCH/AFS
channel and 8 frames in TCH/AHS channel.
The length of the simulations was 200 000 frames which resulted in the
transmission of 24 999 SID_UPDATE frames in TCH/AHS channel and 33 332 frames
in TCH/AFS channel.
### G.3.5.3 Simulation for inband channel
There are two parallel inband channels, one for ModeIndication and one for
ModeCommand/ModeRequest. For each of the two inband channels the same
algorithm where used. First the current mode was set to a random mode (one of
four). Then after every 8 times the current mode had been transmitted a fair
coin was flipped, and depending on the outcome of that the current mode was
changed to the next higher or lower mode. If the current mode was already the
lowest and the coin indicated that a lower mode should be selected, the
current mode was retained. Similarly, if the current mode was the highest and
the coin indicated that a higher mode should be selected, the current mode was
retained. This means that there was a coin flip once every 2*8 = 16 speech
frames (once every 320 ms) for each of the two inband channels or that in
total there was a coin flip once every 160 ms. The simulation results put into
the table was then the mean FER for the two inband channels.
All simulations for inband performance assumed that four modes where currently
active.
## G.3.6 Remarks to the Data in GSM 05.05
Like the specifications for GSM HS and EFS, all data given in GSM 05.05 are
properly rounded.
In the case of TU50, TU50 no FH leads systematically to _a little bit_ better
performance than TU50 IFH in many cases of GSM900 AHS, DCS1800 AFS and DCS1800
AHS. Possible explanation is that the FH algorithm used in the AMR radio
simulator is not good enough to simulate the ideal FH, e.g. it may not be so
good as that used for the GSM EFR simulations. Take the reference interference
performance in the case of GSM900 as an example. TCH/EFS has an FER of 9%/3%
for TU50 no FH/IFH, respectively, which corresponds to a factor of 3 (=9/3).
In our simulation, TCH/AFS12.2 has an FER of 6%/3.5% for TU50 no FH/IFH,
respectively, i.e. a factor of only 1.7 (=6/3.5). Regarding to this point, the
following solution approved at SMG2#31 meeting was used: For the TU50 IFH
(GSM900 AHS, DCS1800 AFS & AHS), the same requirements as for the TU50 no FH
are set in GSM 05.05 ‑ as people may have done also for GSM FR, HR and EFR
simulations. This is reasonable since theoretically the TU50 IFH performance
should be at least as good as TU50 no FH.

Date: 04.09.1996
# H.1 Scope
The present document discusses relevant system and interference scenarios of
UIC equipments as a first step in determining the RF requirements in GSM 05.05
for the R‑GSM band, both as regards intra‑system performance of a UIC network
and towards other systems.

# H.2 Constraints
## H.2.1 GSM based systems in the 900 MHz band
Following the decision by CEPT ERC in their June 95 meeting to shift the UIC
frequencies and to amend CEPT recommendation TR 25‑09 accordingly, UIC systems
are now designated on a European basis the band 876 MHz to 880 MHz (mobile
station transmit) paired with 921 MHz to 925 MHz (base station transmit).
The GSM based systems in the 900 MHz band are thus, cf. GSM 05.05 and TD
139/95 of SMG2#15).

## H.2.2 Other systems
Other possible systems in the 900 MHz band include TETRA and various national
public and military systems. These systems are not considered any further in
the present document.
Neither is UIC co‑existance with DCS1800 considered in any detail, assuming
that the RF requirements for UIC equipments at frequencies far away from the
operational frequencies shall be identical to P‑GSM.
## H.2.3 UIC systems outline
For reasons of economies of scale, timescales required, availability of
equipment, the possibility to use also public networks, etc., it has been
important for the UIC that its new radio system for integrated train
communications as far as possible is based on an existing standard, namely
GSM900.
This also implies that UIC RF parameters should not be different to P‑GSM,
except where justified by the different frequency band requiring modified
filters.
In order to able to roam onto public networks, a UIC MS as a minimum shall be
able to operate over both the UIC and the P‑GSM band and it must meet the RF
requirements of either. This requires a pass band of any \"duplex\" filters in
the UIC MS of 39 MHz. At the same time the transition band is only 6 MHz
between the downlink (of UIC) and the uplink (of P‑GSM). This implies a
greater filter complexity than for P‑GSM and probably even E‑GSM, unless
possibly some related RF performance parameters are relaxed for the UIC MS,
e.g. blocking and wide band noise - in line with the scenarios.
It should be studied whether the UIC MS filtering can be of a less order if
operation is not required or tolerances (filter ripple) are relaxed in the GSM
extension band.
## H.2.4 Fixed UIC RF parameters
At least the following GSM900 parameters in GSM 05.05 are expected to apply
equally to UIC equipments, referred to by the relevant section in GSM 05.05:
> 4.1 Output power and power levels.
>
> 4.4 Radio frequency tolerance.
>
> 4.6 Phase accuracy.
>
> 6.2 Ref. sensitivity level.
>
> 6.3 Ref. interference level.
>
> 6.4 Erroneous frame indication performance.
# H.3 Methodology
The relevant scenarios of interference are identified and a worst case
analysis is applied along the lines of GSM 05.50. Thus, assuming a single
interferer, the performance required to avoid the interference altogether is
calculated based on the minimum coupling loss to the victim.
This method is justified by its simplicity and the typical applications of a
UIC system for train control purposes and exchange of voice messages to
override signalling information etc., whereby safety is a major concern.
Furthermore, UIC systems will typically be noise limited, and any interference
scenario not meeting the requirements will lead to a less reliable coverage.
To take in account any multiple interferers, the likelihood of a scenario and
the possible consequences of it not being met, interference margins to the
worst case requirement may be introduced.
## H.3.1 Scenarios
The identification of relevant scenarios is based on the system scenarios of
TD SMG 61/91 (part of technical report GSM 05.50). These are:
1\. Single BTS and MS.
2\. Multiple MS and BTS, one network.
3\. Multiple MS and BTS, different networks.
4\. Colocated MS, different networks.
5\. Colocated BTS, different networks.
6\. Colocation with other systems.
Only the scenario aspects related to close proximity are considered, as the
fixed UIC RF parameters set the range as for GSM.
For UIC systems there will not be more than one operator in a region. Even at
the border between such regions, the train control applications shall assure
that an MS does not get close to a new BTS while still remaining on the old
network. Thus 1 and 2 above are the only relevant UIC intra‑system close
proximity scenarios, with the addition of 4bis (colocated MS, one network) and
5bis (colocated BTS, one network).
Scenarios 3 to 5 are related to coexistance between UIC and other GSM900
systems.
Other systems in the 900 MHz band (scenario 6) are not considered further, as
explained in subclause 2.2.
Thus the scenarios for investigation are as follows:
**Scenario 1:** Single BTS and MS (UIC only)
Consider a UIC MS close to its serving BTS and no interferers, i.e. only the
wanted signal levels involved and no interferers.
**Scenario 2:** Multiple MS and BTS of one network (UIC only)
Consider multiple UIC MS at different distances from a common serving site,
i.e. mostly near‑far effects. The site will typically be a single BTS with one
or two carriers. Sectored cells or umbrella cells will seldom be used in
railways networks.
**Scenario 3:** Multiple MS and BTS of different networks (UIC vs GSM)
Consider interference between a BTS and foreign MS\'s at close proximity: An
MS being distant from its own BTS may transmit at maximum power close to a
foreign BTS, and may be exposed to that one transmitting at maximum power to
distant MS\'s of its own.
**Scenario 4:** Colocated MS of different networks (UIC vs GSM)
Consider GSM and UIC MS\'s at close proximity, each being served by its own
BTS, neither colocated nor synchronised. Thus the uplink of the one MS
transmitting at full power can interfere with the downlink of the other MS
receiving at reference sensitivity.
**Scenario 4bis:** Colocated UIC MS (UIC only)
Consider UIC MS\'s at close proximity, transmitting at full power and
receiving at the limit sensitivity.
**Scenario 5:** Colocated BTS of different networks (UIC vs GSM)
Consider a BTS transmitting to a distant MS at full power, thus possibly
interfering with a close proximity BTS of the other system receiving a faint
signal from a distant MS.
A co‑siting and optimised UIC BTS ‑ GSM BTS scenario could be relevant in some
cases, e.g. where a public GSM operator operates a UIC system on behalf of a
railway, or where the same sites (e.g. a leaky cable system in tunnels) are
used for the UIC system and a public GSM system, in order to provide public
service to train passengers or to reduce cost for either system.
**Scenario 5bis:** Colocated UIC BTS (UIC only)
Consider the interactions between transmitters and receivers of a single or
cosited BTS\'s.
## H.3.2 Format of calculations
The max emissions level allowed is calculated to give the requirement on any
noise of the source of interference, overlapping the wanted signal of the
victim receiver at reference sensitivity (assume 200 kHz bandwidth).
The maximum exposure signal level is calculated to give the requirement on the
victim resilience against a strong signal off the channel of its wanted
signal.
The interference signal levels are calculated at the antenna connector of the
equipments, in line with GSM 05.05. For equipment with integral antenna only,
a reference antenna with 0 dBi gain is assumed.
Correspondingly, the Minimum Coupling Loss is defined between the antenna
connectors of either end of the interference link, i.e. it includes the
antenna gains and any losses.
## H.3.3 GSM900 systems parameters
Throughout the analysis the following parameter values are assumed, using
values from GSM 03.30 clause A.2 where applicable.
+-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | | UIC | GSM | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | **MS (vehicle mounted):** | | | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Antenna gain | 4 dBi | 2 dBi | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Cable and connector losses | 2 dB | 2 dB | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Antenna height | 4 m | 1,5 m | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Output power | 39 dBm | 39 dBm | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | | | | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | **Small MS (sMS): (note 1)** | | | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Antenna gain | 0 dBi | 0 dBi | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Body losses (note 2) | 3 dB | 10 dB | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Antenna height | 1,5 m | 1,5 m | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Output power | 33 dBm | 33 dBm | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | | | | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | **BTS:** | | | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Antenna gain, bore sight | 18 dBi (note 3) | 12 dBi | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Antenna gain, 30 degr. off bore sight | 4 dBi | 4 dBi | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Cable and connector losses | 2 dB | 2 dB | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Antenna height | 30 m | 30 m | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Output power (note 4) | 39 dBm | 39 dBm | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | Interference limit (note 5) | | | | | | | | = Sensitivity ‑ C/I ‑ interference | | | | degradation margin (note 6) | | | | | | | | = | | | | | | | | BTS and vehicle mounted MS: ‑104 ‑ 9 ‑ | | | | 3 = ‑116 dBm | | | | | | | | Small MS: ‑102 ‑ 9 ‑ 3 = ‑114 dBm | | | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+ | NOTE 0: All power levels are at the | | | | antenna connector of the equipment. | | | | | | | | NOTE 1: As defined in GSM 05.05, a | | | | small UIC MS pertains to power class 4 | | | | or 5 (i.e. max 2W) and is not designed | | | | to be vehicle mounted. | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: For GSM sMS a body loss of 10 | | | | dB is assumed, in line with recent | | | | experiences and measurements. The lower | | | | value of 3 dB assumed for UIC sMS may | | | | reflect a typical use, being carried on | | | | the body rather than held at the head. | | | | By the way, this is also the value | | | | given in GSM 03.30. | | | | | | | | NOTE 3: For UIC base stations, | | | | especially serving high speed line | | | | sections, it is likely that high | | | | directivity antennas with a | | | | correspondingly high gain will be used | | | | to provide the required high grade and | | | | quality of coverage. | | | | | | | | NOTE 4: BTS RX diversity has not been | | | | considered. If this should be the case | | | | the BTS transmit power should be | | | | increased about 3 dB. | | | | | | | | NOTE 5: In receiver bandwidth: Assume | | | | 200 kHz. | | | | | | | | NOTE 6: For a noise limited system, the | | | | GSM reference sensitivity is not valid | | | | if the receiver is exposed to | | | | interference at the same time, nor is | | | | the 9 dB C/I ratio valid at the | | | | sensitivity limit. Thus a 3 db | | | | interference degradation margin is | | | | added in the worst case analysis in | | | | accordance with GSM 03.30. This is a | | | | compromise value, that allows a slight | | | | desensitisation of the victim in the | | | | case of interference. | | | +-----------------------------------------+-----------------+--------+
## H.3.4 Minimum Coupling Loss
The minimum coupling loss is calculated assuming free space path loss at 900
MHz (31,5 dB + 20l og(d) [m]), a reasonable assumption for the close proximity
scenarios in question.
For all MS to BTS scenarios, as a simple assumption, the minimum coupling loss
is assumed to be at a downward angle of 30 deg. off bore sight (i.e. double
the vertical distance) with a reduced BTS antenna gain as given above.

A Multiple Interferers Margin (MIM) of 6 dB is introduced to tighten the
scenarios requirements where GSM base stations are the source of interference,
to take into account their multiple and continuous carriers. The likelihood of
multiple close proximity mobiles active on overlapping timeslots is considered
rather small, so no MIM applies for mobiles producing interference. Also for
interfering UIC base stations no MIM applies, considering the low number of
carriers.
However, no MIM shall apply for scenario requirements for blocking, which is
considered a non‑additive narrow band phenomenon.
## H.3.6 Differences between E- and P-GSM
Concluding the above determination of scenarios and parameters, it may be
noted that no differences apply between E‑ and P‑GSM as regards co‑existence
scenarios with UIC.
# H4 Transmitter requirements
If not otherwise stated, the max emissions level allowed from an interference
source for a given scenario is calculated as follows:

# H.6 Wanted signals levels
In this clause the intra UIC system wanted signal levels are calculated.
## H.6.1 Maximum wanted signal level
Scenario 1, single MS and BTS, refers.
Adaptive power control is not considered. At very high speeds and a BTS
antenna located close to the track, it is expected to be too slow to react
quickly enough to reduce the signal levels substantially at the passage of the
mast.
**Vehicle Mounted MS:**
1) Max MS RX wanted signal level:
Source output power ‑ MCL = 39 ‑ 62
= ‑23dBm
2) Max BTS RX wanted signal level:
Source output power ‑ MCL = 39 ‑ 62
= ‑23dBm
**Small MS:**
1) Max sMS RX wanted signal level:
Source output power ‑ MCL = 39 ‑ 68
= ‑29dBm
2) Max BTS RX wanted signal level:
Source output power ‑ MCL = 33 ‑ 68
= ‑35dBm
i.e. the value above takes precedence.
## H.6.2 Dynamic range of wanted signals
Scenario 2, multiple MS and BTS of one network, refers.
Within one carrier, in the extreme the BTS adjacent timeslots RX levels may
range between the max level calculated above and the reference sensitivity.

**Title: UIC RF parameters**
Source: UIC / DSB
Date: 28.11.1996
# J.1 Introduction
The present document presents the results of a small working group aiming to
determine the RF‑parameters for UIC equipments, to be in line with the
scenario requirements where possible and feasible, and to find a reasonable
compromise where not.
The current specifications for GSM and DCS equipments are not changed, except
possibly where absolutely no implications for their implementation are
expected. It has not been investigated, if and to what extent this means that
some close proximity co‑existance scenarios towards UIC equipments are not
met.
The document is largely structured as follows:
\- Basic considerations.
\- Discussion of transmitter characteristics.
\- Discussion of receiver characteristics.
\- Discussion of transmitter/receiver performance.
At the end of the document, a list of references is given.
# J.2 Basic considerations
As explained in [2] for reasons of economies of scale, availability of
equipment and the timescales required, in principle, the RF‑parameters for UIC
equipments should not be different to standard GSM, except where affected by
the different frequency band requiring modified filters.
In order to able to roam onto public networks, a UIC mobile as a minimum shall
be able to operate over both the band designated for the UIC and the P‑GSM
band, fulfilling the RF requirements of either.
This requires a pass band of any \"duplex\" filters in the UIC mobile of 39
MHz. At the same time the transition band is only 6 MHz between the downlink
(of UIC) and the uplink (of P‑GSM). This implies a greater filter complexity
than for P‑GSM and probably even E‑GSM. Therefore relaxations should be sought
for RF parameters related to the filter in the UIC mobile, where possible
while still meeting the scenario requirements. It should also be studied
whether the filtering in the UIC mobile can be of a less order, if operation
is not required or performance and tolerances are relaxed in the GSM extension
band.
## J.2.1 Types of equipment and frequency ranges
For reasons of interoperability and economies of scales, all UIC mobiles must
have the capability to operate in the frequency bands mentioned above. UIC
base stations, however, in general will only be required to operate in the UIC
band, although co‑operation arrangements could be envisaged with public band
operators, requiring base stations to operate on either band.
One way of reflecting this is to define the R‑GSM band to cover the UIC band
only, and to require UIC mobiles to have \"multiband\" capabilities. However,
the current principle in GSM 05.05 requires multiband equipment to meet all
requirements for each of the bands supported (and this is only described for
mobiles). At the same time, in‑band performances in general are referred to
the frequencies of the individual bands, rather than considering that only GSM
type scenarios apply within the full relevant GSM900 band, whereas the
unwanted out‑of‑band signals originate from the other link direction and from
other systems. For the UIC equipments, this approach leads to an unnecessary
overlapping of the more strict out‑of‑band requirements with the in‑band
performance required to meet the relevant scenarios.
An alternative approach, to define the R‑GSM band to cover both the UIC, P‑
and possibly E‑GSM bands, is not appropriate for the general type of UIC base
stations, and it does not reflect what is needed for railways operation,
namely a stand alone band which mobiles would only leave under controlled
circumstances for roaming.
The approach taken in here is the pragmatic one, whereever relevant for the
specification, to discuss and describe the frequency ranges that must actually
apply for the \"UIC equipment\" types described above, when later elaborating
the exact wordings.
\"UIC mobiles\" is used throughout the text to designate either of the
following:
\- an MS, being a vehicle mounted equipment; or
\- a small MS, for which the abbreviation \"sMS\" is used.
# J.3 Discussion of the individual sections in GSM 05.05
This clause discusses the RF‑parameters for UIC equipments and the changes
required in GSM 05.05 for their inclusion in GSM phase 2+.
Where possible and feasible, the RF‑parameters are derived from the scenario
requirements as set out in [2]. Otherwise a reasonable compromise is sought.
## J.3.1 Scope
No change required.
## J.3.2 Frequency bands and channel arrangement
As a working assumption, the UIC GSM900 band is to be included in the GSM
05.xx series under the term R‑GSM, as described and agreed by SMG2 in [3].
Please refer to the present document for the details of the CR required for
the change, but to summarise it, the GSM based systems in the 900 MHz band
are:

## J.3.3 Reference configuration
No changes are required in this subclause of GSM 05.05.
## J.3.4 Transmitter characteristics
The following table, copied from clause 4 in [2], gives the scenarios
requirements for the maximum allowed unwanted emissions of a UIC transmitter,
in order not to interfere with another link.
The values corresponds to average measurements in dBm in a 200 kHz bandwidth.
As in GSM 05.05, the reference point is the antenna connector of the
equipment.

### J.3.4.1 Output power
No change is required.
NOTE 1: Also for UIC mobiles the lowest power control level is assumed to be
5dBm.
NOTE 2: Micro BTS is not expected to be used in UIC networks.
### J.3.4.2 Void
#### J.3.4.2.1 Spectrum due to the modulation and wide band noise
This specification is related to in‑band performance only, and is closely
related to the modulation, i.e. it does not include any effects of the
\"duplex\" filter. Thus the performance should be as for standard GSM, also
because the requirements are already close to what is obtainable.
Thus, as a working assumption, no change is proposed to this subclause of GSM
05.05.
NOTE: Comparing with the applicable scenario requirements:
‑ UIC BTS victimising UIC downlink: 0dBm;
‑ UIC MS or sMS victimising the UIC uplink: ‑54dBm and ‑48dBm, respectively;
the performance specified in GSM 05.05 is fully sufficient for the BTS,
whereas the scenarios will not be met in all cases involving MS or sMS. A
detailed calculation, however, has not been performed.
#### J.3.4.2.2a MS spectrum due to switching transients
This being a specification close to the carrier, the applicable scenarios deal
with UIC MS or sMS victimising UIC or GSM uplinks.
* * *
MS sMS  
-54 -48 dBm Scenarios requirement +20 +20 dB Transient margin (GSM 05.50 p. A‑18 [4]) -8 -8 dB Bandwidth conversion factor into 30 kHz \- -   
-42 -36 dBm Performance requirement
* * *
For feasibility reasons, this is compared with the requirement in GSM 05.05 at
1 800 kHz offset only, implying a tightening for UIC MS. Nevertheless, no
change is proposed, because this could make it difficult to use standard GSM
technology, and because only a balanced specification with the \'spectrum due
to the modulation and wide band noise\' makes sense, by which the scenario
requirement is not fully met anyhow, as discussed above (see subclause 4.2.1).
#### J.3.4.2.2b BTS spectrum due to switching transients
Here, for one, the scenario of UIC BTS victimising the UIC downlink applies.
The corresponding requirement is 0dBm, which is uncritial and requires no
change to GSM 05.05.
NOTE: The high value reflects the assumption that there will only be one UIC
operator in an area, and thus only the coordinated case with power control to
consider.
At the upper end of the transmit band, however, UIC BTS switching transients
may extend into and victimise the E‑GSM downlink, whereby the following
applies:
‑51 dBm Scenarios requirement
+20 dB Transient margin (GSM 05.50 p. A‑18 [4])
‑8 dB Bandwidth conversion factor into 30 kHz
‑39 dBm Performance requirement onto E‑GSM downlink
The UIC BTS power being 39 dBm measured in a 300 kHz bandwidth, this
corresponds to ‑78 dBc. The requirement in GSM 05.05 at 1,2 MHz to 1,8 MHz
from the carrier is ‑74 dBc or ‑36 dBm, whichever is the higher.
Nevertheless, it is suggested to stay with the GSM 05.05 specification,
considering that only mobiles operating on the outermost frequencies of the
E‑GSM and very close to their reference sensitivity will possibly be
interfered with.
#### J.3.4.3.1 Spurious emissions
The principle of the spurious emissions specification in 05.05 is basically a
split in two, an in‑band part a), and an out‑of‑band part b) with more strict
requirements. However, the specification is not fully clear on what is the
in‑band part: Does the term \"relevant transmit band\" refer to:
‑ the actual transmit band of an equipment; or
‑ the total combined range of GSM9 00 as opposed to DCS1800?
The latter seems the more appropriate, assuming that the out‑of‑band
requirement is adapted from general CEPT limits to protect all other various
applications of radio reception, whereas the in‑band part of the requirements
should relate to co‑existence scenarios for GSM network operation.
For implementation of E‑ or P‑GSM equipments, the difference between the two
interpretations may be negligible, but in any case the latter is more relaxed
than the first.
For UIC equipments, capable of operation over the full GSM900 band, however,
the latter definition must apply. Otherwise, requiring for multiband operation
that all the requirements for each of the bands must be met, unnecessarily
strict requirements would result by overlapping an out‑of‑band with the
in‑band of another band.
Thus, for UIC equipments, the \"relevant transmit band\" shall be:
MS and sMS: 876 MHz to 915 MHz;
BTS: 921 MHz to 960 MHz.
#### J.3.4.3.2 BTS spurious emissions
In order to keep a balanced specification, the BTS spurious emissions
requirement in the first paragraph of this subclause of GSM 05.05, referring
to the conditions specified in subclause 4.3.1a (at 1,8 MHz or greater offset
from the carrier), should not be tighter than what is applied for the
switching transients (in subclause 4.2.2b, at 1,8 MHz or less offset from the
carrier), i.e. also here the current GSM 05.05 specification should be kept.
A tighter specification would not be of much use anyhow. For UIC, with its
narrow downlink band, the BTS noise closer to the carrier is expected to be
dominant, and even this is not critical, due to the coordinated scenarios. For
GSM mobiles suffering this kind of interference when being close to a base
station, in most cases the source would rather be a GSM BTS (by their
multitude, and being closer in frequency).
In the second paragraph of the section, referring to the conditions in
subclause 4.3.1b, the \"out‑of‑band\" requirements should not be changed,
assuming these are adopted from general CEPT limits.
Regarding protection of the BTS receive band, the UIC BTS victimising UIC or
GSM uplinks scenarios apply:
* * *
UIC GSM  
-86 -76 dBm Scenarios requirement -3 -3 dB Bandwidth conversion factor into 100 kHz \- -   
-89 -79 dBm Performance requirement
* * *
NOTE 1: The less tight requirement against the E‑ and P‑GSM bands reflects the
scenarios assumption that such cositings would be subject to optimised
arrangements providing a coupling loss of at least 40 dB, see [2].
Thus, for UIC, a limit of ‑89 dBm towards the full BTS receive band should
apply, taking the more strict value. This still forms a relaxation compared
with standard GSM that can assist the implementation, considering the narrower
transition band for the filtering implicated.
NOTE 2: The relaxation largely reflects that no multiple interferers margin is
applied for a UIC BTS.
No change is suggested against DCS, assuming implementations based on standard
GSM and thus meeting the current requirement.
Considering the above relaxation of the protection of the UIC uplink as
compared with GSM, the GSM 05.05 note on protection from co‑sited DCS
transmitters should be sufficient for protection of the UIC band as well, if
ever needed. Nevertheless, it is suggested to include it in the GSM uplink
frequency range specified for protection (to read 876 MHz to 915 MHz). This
downwards extension by 4 MHz should pose no problem for actual DCS equipments,
considering the large spacing to its wanted signal.
By the same principle, also in the last paragraph of this section of GSM
05.05, for protection of the GSM downlink from DCS, the frequency range should
be extended to include the UIC band (to read 921 MHz to 960 MHz), and again
this should pose no problems for actual DCS equipments.
#### J.3.4.3.3 MS spurious emissions
For the \"in‑band\" part of the specification, the applicable scenarios deal
with UIC MS or sMS victimising UIC or GSM uplinks:
* * *
MS sMs  
-54 -48 dBm Scenarios requirement +20 +20 dB Transient margin -8 -8 dB Bandwidth conversion factor into 30 kHz \- -   
-42 -36 dBm Performance requirement
* * *
The first paragraph of GSM 05.05 subclause 4.3.3 should be amended
accordingly, to include the above more strict requirement on UIC MS, whereas
it is unchanged for UIC sMS.
As above in subclause 4.3.2, the \"out‑of‑band\" requirements in the second
paragraph should not be changed, assuming these are adopted from general CEPT
limits.
Regarding the requirements in idle mode in the 3^rd^ paragraph, the following
applies towards the UIC and GSM uplinks:
* * *
MS sMS  
-54 -48 dBm Scenarios requirement -3 -3 dB Bandwidth conversion factor into 100 kHz \- -   
-57 -51 dBm Performance requirement
* * *
Comparing this with the existing requirements, for UIC the following
differences arise:
UIC MS: ‑57dBm throughout, below 1 GHz;
UIC sMS: ‑51dBm in the frequency band 876 MHz to 915 MHz.
No change is assumed above 1 GHz.
#### J.3.4.3.4 MS spurious emissions onto downlinks
For UIC MS or sMS victimising the UIC downlink, the scenario requirement is
‑82 dBm and ‑70 dBm, i.e. the performance requirement is ‑85 dBm and ‑73 dBm
in 100 kHz, respectively.
However, for UIC mobiles, featuring all 3 GSM bands and having a narrower
duplex gap of 6MHz only, it is considered unrealistic to have a performance
any better than for GSM MS and sMS. For such, a maximum of ‑79 dBm and ‑67 dBm
is allowed in the P‑GSM and E‑GSM downlink bands, respectively. By a simple
extrapolation of 79 dB - 67 dB / 10 MHz = 1,2 dB/MHz as a roll‑off function
towards the edge of the E‑GSM downlink, the estimated performance of GSM
mobiles in the UIC downlink band is ‑62 dBm. This is summarised in the figure
below.
{width="4.75in" height="2.8958333333333335in"}
More detailed investigations and measurements by Philips Semiconductors [5],
however, have shown that ‑60 dBm is a more realistic and feasible value at 921
MHz, using currently available GSM duplexers without extra effort or costs.
It should also be noted, that if UIC mobiles would have a better performance
than GSM, then the GSM sMS would remain as the more significant interference
source, considering their large numbers and similar close proximity scenarios.
Actually, it would be more important to set a corresponding limit for GSM
equipments, considering that none exists currently.
Thus a limit of ‑60 dBm is proposed to go into GSM 05.05 for UIC MS and sMS in
the UIC downlink frequency range, and to maintain the limits for the GSM
downlink. This satisfies the scenario requirements for UIC mobiles victimising
the GSM downlink, whereas the scenario requirements for close proximity
between UIC mobiles are not met.
Therefore a backwards calculation is performed to determine the resulting
minimum distances required to avoid the interference, see also [2].

When evaluating the consequencies of these UIC mobile to mobile close
proximity scenarios not being met, the following preconditions for the
interference actually to occur must be borne in mind, that significantly
decrease the likelihood of interference:
\- although the interference limit applies also to the idle mode, in practice,
the worst case is expected to require that the victim and the interfering
mobile are both active and operating on overlapping timeslots;
\- the victim mobile must be receiving at reference sensitivity.
In addition, for the UIC vehicle mounted MS to MS scenario, along a railways
line two locomotives moving in opposite directions must be within 27 m of each
other. Thus the overall likelihood of the UIC MS to MS interference is
considered small enough to be acceptable, also when seen in relation to the
large number of operating GSM MS and sMS, each of which presents a similar
potential level of interference.
Whereever UIC sMS are typically being used, such as in stations and shunting
yards, a better radio coverage is needed to provide service for such
equipments. This implies generally higher wanted signal levels in scenarios
involving an sMS, further decreasing the overall likelihood of interference.
Thus it is considered acceptable that the scenarios involving UIC sMS are
missed by a factor of about 3.
No changes are proposed to the last two paragraphs of this section of GSM
05.05.
### J.3.4.4 Radio frequency tolerance
No issues, no change required.
### J.3.4.5 Output level dynamic operation
As in subclause 4.3.3, also here it is not fully clear what is the \"relevant
transmit band\". Assuming again that \"in‑band\" requirements relate to
co‑existence scenarios for operation of GSM networks, it is proposed to apply
the same definition, i.e. it is the total combined range of GSM900.
#### J.3.4.5.1 BTS output level dynamic operation
No changes required.
#### J.3.4.5.2 MS output level dynamic operation
For the present document, the applicable scenarios deal with UIC MS or sMS
victimising UIC or GSM uplinks.
For the UIC MS, the scenario requirement is ‑54 dBm. At the lowest transmit
power level, 5 dBm, this corresponds to ‑59 dBc, assuming 17 power control
steps as for standard GSM. I.e. no change is required to GSM 05.05.
For the UIC sMS, the scenario requirement is no tighter than ‑48 dBm. This
relaxation should be included in GMS 05.05.
### J.3.4.6 Phase accuracy
No issues, no change required.
#### J.3.4.7.1 Intra BTS intermod attenuation
Throughout this section of GSM 05.05, it is supposed that the BTS transmit and
receive bands are referred to, although this is not clearly stated in the
first paragraph.
The second paragraph is understood only to give requirements on
intermodulation products falling into the BTS transmit band, i.e. victimising
downlinks.
The scenario requirement for UIC BTS victimising the UIC downlink is 0dBm,
which is absolutely no problem with the current specification.
NOTE: This reflects the assumption, that for UIC only coordinated scenarios
apply, whereas for GSM the intermodulation product could interfere with a
close proximity foreign mobile at reference sensitivity.
However, for any UIC BTS intermodulation product falling into the GSM
downlink, a scenario requirement of ‑51 dBm applies. For comparison, for GSM
uncoordinated networks the corresponding traditional scenario requirement
calculation is:
‑104 dBm Reference sensitivity
‑9 dB C/I
+59 dB MCL
‑54 dBm Performance limit
This is not met by the specification either, probably for feasibility reasons.
Thus no change is proposed to the second paragraph of this subclause in GSM
05.05.
Considering the likely network implementation, with a UIC BTS operating only
in the UIC band, normally no 3^rd^ order intermodulation products will fall
into any of the UIC or GSM uplinks. In any case, the scenarios requirements
for UIC BTS victimising UIC and GSM uplinks are ‑86 dBm and ‑76d Bm,
respectively. These are the same scenario requirements as in subclause 4.3.2,
and for which a TX filter is introduced to protect the BTS receive bands in
general. Thus the requirement in the 3\'rd paragraph of this section in GSM
05.05 is not a significant problem, and no change is proposed here either.
#### J.3.4.7.2 Intermodulation between MS (DCS1800 only)
Not applicable.
#### J.3.4.7.3 Mobile PBX
No change proposed.
## J.3.5 Receiver characteristics
The following table of scenario requirements, copied from clause 5 in [2],
gives the required blocking performance of UIC receivers against strong
off‑channel signals of another link.
The values are given in dBm. As in GSM 05.05, the reference point is the
antenna connector of the equipment.
* * *
              (Source uplinks)   (Source downlinks)          
              UIC                GSM                  UIC    GSM
              876                \(880\) 890          921    \(925\) 935
              ‑880               ‑915                 ‑925   ‑960 MHz
(Victim:)  
UIC BTS ‑57 ‑26 +9 ‑1 UIC MS +5 ‑17 ‑23 ‑23 UIC sMS ‑7 ‑18 ‑29 ‑29
* * *
### J.3.5.1 Blocking characteristics
The \"in‑band\" and \"out‑of‑band\" frequency ranges to apply for the blocking
performance of a UIC receiver are determined as follows:
1) one of the out‑of‑bands must include the combined unwanted UIC and GSM
transmit band;
2) the in‑band, containing wanted as well as unwanted signals and having the
more relaxed performance, adjoins the above out‑of‑band on the one side;
3) the in‑band adjoins the other out‑of‑band at 20 MHz beyond the combined
wanted UIC and GSM band.
NOTE: Referring to the combined ranges of UIC and GSM bands is necessary, in
1) to cover the UIC/UIC as well as the UIC/GSM scenarios, and in 3) to avoid
possibly extending the stricter requirements of the out‑of‑band to where the
corresponding scenarios are not applicable. This definition is also in line
with the assumed wide band capabilities of UIC equipments.
The following results:
* * *
                              UIC BTS              UIC mobiles
out‑of‑band, incl TX band > 921 MHz \ 980 MHz
* * *
Thus the table in GSM 05.05 for GSM900 MS applies to UIC MS as well with no
change, whereas a new entry is needed for the UIC BTS.
The specification in GSM 05.05 on exceptions is proposed not to be changed.
The changes needed to the GSM 05.05 blocking specification for the UIC
equipments are discussed in the following.
As micro BTS is not considered an issue for UIC networks, no changes apply to
the last table in subclause 5.1 of GSM 05.05.
### J.3.5.2 Blocking characteristics (in‑band)
For UIC MS in‑band blocking performance, the scenario requirement is ‑23 dBm
to protect against unwanted UIC and GSM downlinks. This is in line with the
current specification.
For UIC sMS, the scenario requirement is ‑29 dBm to protect against unwanted
UIC and GSM downlinks.
For UIC BTS, to protect against unwanted GSM uplinks, the scenario requirement
is ‑26 dBm. To protect against unwanted UIC uplinks, the requirement is only
‑57 dBm, reflecting the coordinated scenario.
In summary, this points to the possibility of relaxing some in‑band blocking
requirements for UIC equipments as compared with GSM. However, there are a
number of good reasons not to do so: These requirements are not related to the
different frequency band and the narrower duplex gap for filtering. They are
not difficult to meet. And this allows for a better performance than for the
typical close proximity scenarios, e.g. in a BTS‑MS case where antennas are
used at the mouth of tunnels to provide inside coverage. Thus it is proposed
to retain the same in‑band specification as for GSM throughout the table in
GSM 05.05.
### J.3.5.3 Blocking characteristics (out‑of‑band)
For UIC MS out‑of‑band blocking performance, the scenario requirement is +5
dBm or ‑13 dBm, where the source is a UIC MS or sMS uplink, respectively (see
[2]). However, the UIC MS / UIC MS scenario is being failed by the MS spurious
emissions anyhow (27 m distance required instead of 2 m, as discussed above on
subclause 4.3.3). Thus it is proposed to maintain the 0 dBm specification in
GSM 05.05.
For UIC MS, to protect against the GSM uplink, the scenario requirement is
‑17dBm. Thus, in the band 880 MHz to 915 MHz the out‑of‑band requirement is
suggested to be relaxed to ‑5 dBm, as in note 2 of GSM 05.05.
For UIC sMS, ‑7 dBm is sufficient to protect against either of the UIC and GSM
uplinks. Thus, a relaxation to ‑7 dBm is suggested for the UIC sMS in the
frequency range 876 MHz to 915 MHz.
For UIC BTS, to protect against other UIC and GSM downlinks, the scenario
requirements are +9 dBm and -1 dBm, respectively. This is only a very small
difference to the requirements in GSM 05.05, and thus no change is proposed,
incl. retaining note 3 although a relaxation to an inside part of the
out‑of‑band is probably not usefull for the UIC BTS.
### J.3.5.4 AM suppresion characteristics
No change is proposed.
### J.3.5.5 Intermodulation characteristics
No change is assumed, as this specification is not directly based on system
scenarios.
### J.3.5.6 Spurious emissions
This section has not been examined in detail, but no change is assumed.
## J.3.6 Transmitter/receiver performance
### J.3.6.1 Nominal error rates
For UIC equipments the highest wanted signal levels are:
UIC BTS ‑23 dBm.
UIC MS ‑23 dBm.
UIC sMS ‑29 dBm.
Although this reflects a possible relaxation, it is proposed to stay with the
current specification in GSM 05.05, considering, that in the worst case UIC
BTS and mobiles may be much closer to each other than in the more typical case
used to calculate the scenario, and that the requirement poses no problem for
implementation anyhow.
Thus, no changes are suggested for this section of GSM 05.05.
### J.3.6.2 Reference sensitivity level
No changes are assumed to this subclause of GSM 05.05. This also applies to
the last paragraph, which is assumed to reflect feasibility.
Hint: In some places of a radio network design, not the natural noise floor
may be dominant (as assumed in determining the sensitivity), but rather other
uncoordinated mobiles by their wide band noise setting an artificial and
actual higher noise floor, desensitising the BTS.
**The rest of GSM 05.05**
No change is assumed, except for annex D.

**Title: Block Erasure Rate Performance for GPRS/CS-1, CS-2, CS-3 and CS-4 in
TU50 ideal FH and TU3 no FH, in the presence of co-channel interference**
Source: CSELT, Ericsson
# K.1 Introduction
Block Erasure Rate (BLER) performance for GPRS/CS-1, CS-2, CS-3 and CS-4 are
provided in the case of Typical Urban 50 km/h with ideal frequency hopping and
TU3 no FH, in the presence of co-channel interference. CS-1 BLER performance
is to be compared with SDCCH FER performance provided by AEG and used for
specifying the reference performance in GSM 05.05.
# K.2 Simulation Model
Hereunder the main assumptions used for carrying out the simulations are
reported:
\- TU50 ideal FH and TU3 no FH propagation models, as defined in GSM 05.05.
In case of ideal FH, independent fadings over consecutive bursts are assumed:
\- Varying fading during one burst.
\- One single interfering signal.
\- Eb/No = 28 dB (according to GSM 05.05).
\- No antenna diversity.
\- Burst synchronisation recovery based on the cross-correlation properties of
the training sequence.
\- Soft output equaliser.
\- Channel decoding (for CS-1, performance includes Fire decoding and
correction, as for AEG SDCCH FER performance; for CS-2, CS-3 and CS-4, CRC are
used for detection only).
# K.3 Results
Figure 1 shows Block Erasure Rate curves for GPRS/CS-1, CS-2, CS-3 and CS-4 in
TU50 ideal FH, coming from CSELT and Ericsson. Moreover SDCCH FER performance
from AEG is reported.

# K.4 Conclusions
CSELT and Ericsson results are similar for all the 4 coding schemes and may be
assumed as a basis for specifying the reference values in GSM 05.05. For CS-1
the results are very similar and there is also a good alignment with SDCCH FER
results provided by AEG, especially at BLER = 10%, which is the proposed
reference performance value.

# L.1 Introduction
The present document reports GPRS Block Erasure Rate (BLER) performance and
throughput analyses obtained by simulations for GPRS/CS-1, CS-2, CS-3 and CS-4
coding schemes, in order to provide reference performance in GSM 05.05. The

deviation of 7 dB.

and packet length distributed according to the Railway traffic model.

**TRANSMITTER CHARACTERISTICS**
# R.3 Maximum BTS Output Power
Based upon the calculations in SMG 2 TDoc 144/92 the maximum output power from
an in-building cell is:
P = MS blocking level + MCL - MIM + MSM
At 900 MHz:
P = -23 + 34 - 3 + 10 = +18 dBm
At 1 800 MHz:
P = -26 + 40 - 3 + 10 = +21 dBm
Based upon calculations in SMG2 Tdoc 144/92, an MSM margin corresponding to
10% of affected mobiles can be tolerated according to measurements presented
in SMG2 Tdoc 32/97 this corresponds to an MSM value of 15 dB in a picocell.
At 900 MHz:
P = -23 + 34 - 3 + 15 = +23 dBm
At 1 800 MHz:
P = -26 + 40 - 3 + 15 = +26 dBm
It was suggested during SMG2 #21 that picocells should not necessarily be
restricted to 2 carriers particularly for DCS1800. Correspondingly, values of
multiple interferer margin for 4-carrier scenarios should be considered. That
is MIM = 6 dB. Using these values in the calculations above gives.
At 900 MHz:
P = -23 + 34 - 6 + 15 = +20dBm
At 1 800 MHz:
P = -26 + 40 - 6 + 15 = +23dBm
It is suggested that the values nominal maximum output power levels of 20 dBm
(13 - 20 dBm ± 2 dB) and 23 dBm (16 - 23 dBm ± 2 dB) are chosen as this yields
greatest flexibility of deployment and manufacture for the proposed pico-BTS
class.
The lower value of power for 900 MHz is derived from (18 dBm - 5 dB) and that
for 1 800 MHz from (21 dBm - 5 dB) following the first scenario calculation,
the higher value is derived from the last scenario calculation above.
# R.4 BTS Receiver Sensitivity
## R.4.1 Balanced link (zero interference scenario)
To match the up and down links the maximum receiver reference sensitivity at
the BTS, BTS sens BL, is:
BTS sens BL = MS output power - max. path loss.
max. path loss = BTS output power - MS ref. sens.
At 900 MHz:
BTS sens BL = 33 - (+ 20 - 102) = -89 dBm
At 1 800 MHz:
BTS ref. sens. = 30 - (+23 - 102) = -95 dBm
## R.4.2 Interferer at MCL scenario
However, using an other argument from SMG 2 TDoc 144/92 that the BTS receiver
noise floor will be dominated by another mobile\'s wideband noise when it is
at MCL, the sensitivity in this scenario, BTS sens MCL, is:
BTS sens MCL = MS wideband noise (in 200 kHz) - MCL + C/N
MS wideband noise (in 200 kHz) = MS output power in 30 kHz - noise (dBc/100
kHz) + conversion factor (100 kHz -> 200 kHz).
At 900 MHz:
BTS sens MCL = (25 - 71 + 3) - 34 + 9 = -68 dBm
At 1 800 MHz:
BTS ref. sens. = (22 - 73 + 3) - 40 + 9 = -79 dBm
## R.4.3 Power control (zero interference scenario)
So we have a choice of receiver sensitivities based upon a balanced link
budget with maximum cell radius or on one of the possible scenarios (an
uncoordinated mobile at MCL). To choose between them we can assume that an
operator will want the cell radius to stay constant under all conditions, but
that the mobile should be operating at minimum output power. Here we have to
use the second set of figures but increase the sensitivity by the amount of
power control required. For a phase 1 mobile the power control range is 20 dB.
Therefore the maximum required sensitivity when power control is employed, BTS
sens PC, is:
At 900 MHz:
BTS sens PC = -68 - 20 = -88 dBm (-89dBm, subclause R.4.1)
At 1800 MHz
BTS sens PC = -79 - 20 = -99 dBm (-95dBm, subclause R.4.1)
## R.4.4 Sensitivity overview
At 900 MHz the value in subclause 2.2.3 above is 1 dB lower than that
calculated in subclause R.4.1 for an MCL of 34 dB so we choose -88 dBm
sensitivity.
At 1800MHz the value in 2.2.3 above is 4dB higher than that calculated in
subclause R.4.1 for an MCL of 34dB so we choose -95dBm sensitivity.
Subclause R.4.3 shows that a pico-BTS with a high sensitivity will be able to
make use of MS power control when in-band noise from an uncoordinated
interferer at MCL is not the limiting scenario.
# R.5 BTS Power Control Range
The minimum BTS output power is derived from balancing the link budget for the
maximum permitted path loss. The appropriate value of sensitivity to use
calculating the maximum path loss is for the case when an uncoordinated MS is
close to the BTS. Choice of any other value would imply a cell area that would
vary depending on the presence of close in interferers.
Min. BTS power = MS ref. sens. + max. path loss
max. path loss = MS output power - BTS sens MCL
At 900 MHz:
Min BTS power = -102 + (33 - 68) = -1 dBm (range 20-1 = 21 dB)
At 1 800 MHz:
Min BTS power = -102 + (30 - 79) = 7 dBm (range 23-9 = 16 dBm)
# R.6 BTS Spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise
The BTS wideband noise has to be reduced to a level, which will not degrade
receiver performance of an uncoordinated mobile at MCL. Using the formula for
the small cell environments (SMG2 TDoc 63/92) with MSM given in SMG2 TDoc
144/92.
Wideband noise >= 1,8 MHz = MS ref. sens. + MSM + C/N + MIM + MCL + conversion
factor (200 kHz -> 100 kHz)
At 900 MHz:
Wideband noise = -102 + 15 - 9 - 3 + 34 + -3 = -68 dBm
At 1 800 MHz:
Wideband noise = -102 + 15 - 9 - 6 + 40 + -3 = -65dBm
At 900 MHz it is suggested we choose -68 dBm and at 1800MHz -65 dBm. These
values correspond to spectrum due to modulation with respect to 30 kHz on
carrier of:
Spectrum due to modn = - [max BTS power] + [200 - 30 kHz conversion] \+ [max
wideband noise in dBm]
At 900 MHz:
Spectrum due to modn = -20 + 8 - 68 = -80 dB
At 1 800MHz:
Spectrum due to modn = -23 + 8 - 65 = -80 dB
These values represent a tightening of the values in GSM 05.05, subclause
4.2.1, in comparison with other BTS classes. It is suggested that a compromise
between the values suggested by the scenario and equipment complexity
considerations be adopted.
The pico-BTS noise specifications should be tightened with respect to the
micro BTS classes for offsets beyond 6 000 kHz up to the limits for the normal
BTS. For offsets ≥ 1 800 \MS

## R.10.4 The AM suppression requirement
### R.10.4.1 Downlink, BTS->MS
With reference to the calculations in clause 1) the following scenario
failures occur
(R.10.1.1) Maximum noise at MS due to BTS modulation sidebands fails the
scenario requirement by 15 dB for GSM900 and by 15 dBfor DCS1800.
The most significant failures of the GSM and DCS scenarios occur for BTS
modulation sidebands. If we include the MCL relaxation for interference from
the BTS to its nearest MS stations of 15 dB the scenarios are passed.
### R.10.4.2 Uplink, MS->BTS
With reference to the calculations in subclause R.10.1) the following scenario
failures occur
(R.10.1.2) Maximum noise at BTS due to MS modulation sidebands fails the
scenario requirement by 20 dB for GSM900 and by 16 dBfor DCS1800.
(R.10.2.2) Maximum noise at BTS due to MS switching transients fails the
scenario requirement by 7 dB for GSM900 and by 8 dB for DCS1800.
The most significant failures of the GSM and DCS scenarios occur for MS
modulation sidebands. The failure margin is 20 dB for GSM900 and 16 dB for
DCS1800.
### R.10.4.3 Interference levels
Thus for an AM suppression test, the interferer co-channel components in the
above scenarios based on GSM 05.05 specification limits (pico-BTS) are too
high and would affect the test result. Therefore, the test signal level must
be reduced to a level, which will not compromise the co-channel performance.
The maximum permissible interferer signal level to be used for an AM
suppression test:
= [Tx power] - MCL - [scenario failure margin]
These levels are calculated in the following table. Following the argument in
Tdoc SMG2 246/94, values for BTS->MS testing do not need to be altered.

# R.11 intermodulation
## R.11.1 co-ordinated and uncoordinated BTS -> MS (scenarios 2 & 3, figure
3.2 middle)
[max received level at MS1] = [BTS power] - [coupling loss BTS2 -> MS1] +
[margin for other IMs]
At GSM900 = 20 - 34 + 3 = -11 dBm
AT DCS1800 = 23 - 40 + 6 = -11 dBm
The required IM attenuation in MS is for scenario 2 and for scenario 3. The
GSM 05.05 subclause 5.3 simulates scenario 3.
## R.11.2 coordinated MS&MS -> BTS (scenario 4)
[max received level at BTS1] = [MS power] - [MS power control range] -
[coupling loss MS -> BTS1] + [margin for other IMs]
At GSM900 = 33 - 20 - 34 + 3 = -18 dBm
At DCS1800 = 30 - 20 - 40 + 6 = -24 dBm
## R.11.3 uncoordinated MS&MS -> BTS (scenario 4, figure 3.2 lower)
[max received level at BTS1] = [MS power] - [coupling loss MS - BTS1] +
[margin for other IMs]
At GSM900 = 33 - 34 + 3 = 2 dBm
At DCS1800 = 30 - 40 + 6 = -4 dBm
## R.11.4 MCL relaxation
The worst case for BTS receiver IMs is when two MSs approach the base, the
scenario requirement is covered in subclauses 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 of GSM 05.50
annex. The argument is reproduced above.
Following the argument in GSM 05.50 annex A, If the coupling loss between both
the MSs and the BTS increases by 1 dB the level of a 3^rd^ order IM product
will reduce by 3 dB. Thus, if the coupling loss assumption between MS and BTS
is increased by 15dB to 50dB, the requirements become:
At 900 MHz 2 - 45 = -43 dBm
At 1 800 MHz -4 - 45 = -49 dB
GSM 05.05 gives a level of -43 dBm for 900MHz BTS and -49 dBm for 1 800 BTS
for intermodulation performance. The values above meet the GSM 05.05
scenarios.
# R.12 Pico BTS TI1.5 performance requirements
The pico-BTS shall meet the static channel performance as specified in GSM
05.05. The only other radio propagation channel that is relevant to the
performance of the pico-BTS is the TI 5 channel. At these speeds the GSM
interleaving process no-longer works very well. This can be seen in the
existing non-hopping performance figures for the TU3 environment which are not
that useful. For the performance specified in this channel to be useful for
radio planning purposes we propose to follow to some extent the approach
adopted for GPRS. To allow easy comparison we suggest the adoption of the
performance figures for TU50 no FH at 900 MHz and that we specify the extra
signal level and C/I margins that are required over reference levels in order
to meet this performance in the TI5 channel.
Simulation shows that sensitivity performance is exceeded when the signal
level is increased by 3dB above reference sensitivity.
Simulation shows that interference performance is exceeded when the carrier to
interference level is increased by 4 dB above reference sensitivity.
## R.12.1 Nominal Error Rates for Pico-BTS
The pico-BTS scenarios imply a greater chance that mobile stations will make
high power RACH attempts. Therefore it is necessary to update the NER
requirements for pico-BTS. In the following we reproduce the MCL distribution
table first presented by Motorola in SMG2 32/97 and develop a table of
occurrence probability for RACH power with mobile stations making RACH
attempts at 33 dBm. The table below shows the MCL loss versus the chance of
occurrence.
* * *
\% of measurements 900 MHz MCL dB 1 800 MHz MCL dB 0,03 -33 -39 0,1 -34 -40
0,53 -36 -42 1,0 -38 -48 1,43 -39 -45 2,86 -42 -48 4,66 -45 -51 9,58 -49 -55
* * *
If we now consider a mobile at MCL sending a RACH at maximum power, we can
generate a table, which shows received RACH power at the BTS versus
probability of occurrence.
* * *
\% of measurements 900 MHz RACH dBm 1 800 MHz RACH dBm 0,03 -0 -9 0,1 -1 -10
0,53 -3 -12 1,0 -5 -14 1,43 -6 -15 2,86 -9 -18 4,66 -12 -21 9,58 -16 -25
* * *
If we take the 1% level then 99% of all full power RACH attempts by a mobile
will fall below this level. We suggest that this is the level at which pico-
BTS NER performance should be met. Thus, we need to maintain RACH error
performance and \ 6 MHz / 100 kHz bdw | | | | | | +--------------------------------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+-----------+

# S.2 Transmitter characteristics
## S.2.1 Maximum CTS-FP Transmit Power limited by MS blocking
An upper limit for the maximum transmit power of the CTS-FP TxPwr~max~ is
given, according to the calculations in SMG2 Tdoc 144/92 for indoor cells, by
the blocking of an uncoordinated MS for:
> 3 MHz frequency separation (compare SMG2 WPB Tdoc 188/98).
This maximum TxPwr~max~ is:
**TxPwr~max~ = MS blocking level + MCL + MSM - MIM.**
_For GSM900:_
Taking into account that the CTS-FP is a one-carrier BS and using 10 dB MSM
the maximum transmit power is:
**TxPwr~max~** [dBm] = -23 + 34,5 + 10 = **+21,5 dBm** GSM900
Assuming a multiple interferer condition with four CTS-FPs located around an
uncoordinated GSM-MS at minimum loss condition (6 dB MIM):
**TxPwr~max~** [dBm] = -23 + 34,5 + 10 - 6 = **+15,5 dBm** GSM900
Considering the measurement based statistics for indoor cells of SMG2 Tdoc
32/97 which tolerates 10% affected mobiles a MSM of 15 dB has to be used
instead of 10 dB
**TxPwr~max~** [dBm] = -23 + 34,5 + 15 - 6 = **+20,5 dBm** GSM900
_For DCS1800:_
Taking into account the CTS-FP as a one-carrier BS and 10dB MSM the maximum
transmit power is:
**TxPwr~max~** [dBm] = -26 + 40 + 10 = **+24 dBm** DCS1800
Assuming a multiple interferer condition with four CTS-FPs located around an
uncoordinated GSM-MS at minimum loss condition (6 dB MIM):
**TxPwr~max~** [dBm] = -26 + 40 + 10 - 6 = **+18 dBm** DCS1800
Considering the measurement based statistics for indoor cells of SMG2 Tdoc
32/97 which tolerates 10% affected mobiles a MSM of 15 dB has to be used
instead of 10 dB:
**TxPwr~max~** [dBm] = -26 + 40 + 15 - 6 = **+23 dBm** DCS1800
The calculated maximum transmit power levels are in the range from +15 dBm to
+20 dBm for GSM900 and from +18 dBm to +24 dBm for DCS1800. A further
requirement can be deduced from spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise
which will be considered below.
## S.2.2 Maximum CTS-FP Transmit Power limited by Spectrum due to Modulation
and WBN
Again the TxPwr~max~ limit will be given by the requirement not to degrade the
receiver performance of an uncoordinated MS. For small cell environments (SMG2
Tdoc 63/92) the maximum allowed wideband noise in a 100kHz measurement
bandwidth for >= 1.8MHz frequency separation is:
**Wideband noise = MS ref. sens. - C/N + MCL - MIM + MSM + conv. fac. (200 - >
100 kHz)**
_For GSM900:_
Considering the MSM from SMG2 Tdoc 32/97 and the CTS-FP as single carrier BS:
**Max. wideband noise** [dBm] = -102 - 9 + 34,5 - 0 + 15 ‑ 3 = **-64,5 dBm**
GSM900
For a multiple interferer situation with 4 CTS-FPs in close proximity:
**Max. wideband noise** [dBm] = -102 - 9 + 34,5 - 6 + 15 - 3 = **-70,5 dBm**
GSM900
_For DCS1800:_
Considering the MSM from SMG2 Tdoc 32/97 and the CTS-FP as single carrier BS:
**Max wideband noise** [dBm] = -102 - 9 + 40 - 0 + 15 ‑ 3 = **-59 dBm**
DCS1800
For a multiple interferer situation with 4 CTS-FPs in close proximity:
**Max. wideband noise** [dBm] = -102 - 9 + 40 - 6 + 15 ‑ 3 = **-65 dBm**
DCS1800
For a multiple interferer condition four active CTS-FPs using the same
timeslot as an interfered MS have to be located in close proximity to the MS.
This situation is very unlikely taking into account that all four CTS-FPs are
not synchronised and must all affect the one distinct timeslot used by the MS.
Therefore, this situation is not considered furthermore.
From the maximum allowed wideband noise the maximum transmit power of the CTS-
FP can be calculated using the spectrum mask values taken as an assumption for
the CTS-FP:
TxPwr~max~ [dBm] = max. wideband noise - Spectrum due to modulation with
respect to\ 30 kHz bandwidth on carrier + conv. fac. (200 kHz -> 30 kHz).
For frequency separation >= 1,8 MHz and \= 3 MHz and \ 6 MHz:
**TxPwr~max~** [dBm] = -64,5 + 71 + 8 = **+14,5 dBm** GSM900
**TxPwr~max~** [dBm] = -59 + 67 + 8 = **+16 dBm** DCS1800
It has to be noted that for secure coexistence of CTS and GSM no compromise
has been made here for higher maximum transmit power or lower spectrum mask
requirements as for example for the pico-BTS case in SMG2 Tdoc 188/98.
Overview over all values:

## S.2.3 Specification of max. CTS-FP Transmit Power and CTS-FP Spectrum due
to modulation and wide band noise
### S.2.3.1 Maximum CTS-FP transmit power
In subclauses 2.1 and 2.2 requirements for the maximum transmit power of the
CTS-FP for GSM900 and DCS1800 are given. This results for GSM900 and DCS1800
are in the range from TxPwr~max~ = +6,5 dBm up to +21,5 dBm and from
TxPwr~max~ = +8 dBm up to +24 dBm, respectively. Of course, the choice of the
TxPwr~max~ has to be adapted more close to the lower limit of that range. A
more clear view can be obtained by a detailed analysis of the system scenarios
under the aspect of CTS interfering GSM-BTS and GSM-MS in single interferer
scenarios.
Regarding the two scenarios, blocking and spectrum due to modulation and
wideband noise, this analysis shows that for up to +13 dBm TxPwr~max~ for
GSM900 and up to +15,5 dBm TxPwr~max~ for DCS1800 of CTS-FP and CTS-MS, the
available pathloss is only in one scenario lower than the required pathloss.
This case is a GSM-MS located indoors close to a CTS-FP and being interfered
by the spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise of the CTS-FP. For that
case the required pathloss for 1,8 MHz frequency separation is:
min PL ~CTS-FP/GSM-MS~ = TxPwr~max~ ~CTS-FP~ + conv. fac. (200 kHz -> 30 kHz)
‑ ref. sens ~GSM-MS~ + C/I ‑\ MSM ‑ body loss - spectrum mask ~CTS-FP~
~(dBc/100kHz)~ +\ conv. fac. (100 kHz -> 200 kHz).
_For GSM900:_
**min PL** [dB] = TxPwr~max~ ~CTS-FP~ ‑ 8 + 102 + 9 ‑ 15 ‑ 3 - 63 + 3 =
**TxPwr~max~ ~CTS-FP~** \+ 25
The following table shows the comparison of available and required pathloss
(including body loss) between CTS-FP and GSM-MS. The GSM-MS operates in a
coverage limited operation receiving at sensitivity level.
* * *
TxPwr~max~ [dBm] 5 9 11 13 required coupling loss [dB] 33 37 39 41 available
coupling loss [dB] 34.5 34.5 34.5 34.5
* * *
In order to best fulfil the coupling loss requirements, it is proposed to
tighten the spectrum mask of the CTS-FP by 5 dB:
proposed **spectrum mask ~CTS-FP~ ~(dBc/100kHz)~** at 1,8 MHz frequency
separation: **-68 dBc** GSM900
Then, the comparison of available and required pathloss (including body loss)
between CTS-FP and GSM-MS (with the GSM-MS operating in a coverage limited
operation receiving at sensitivity level) becomes.
* * *
TxPwr~max~ [dBm] 5 9 11 13 required coupling loss [dB] 30 32 34 36 available
coupling loss [dB] 34,5 34,5 34,5 34,5
* * *
Regarding these values, we propose a maximum CTS-FP transmit power TxPwr~max~
of +11 dBm for GSM900.
_For DCS1800:_
**min PL** [dB] = TxPwr~max~ ~CTS-FP~ ‑ 8 + 102 + 9 ‑ 15 ‑ 3 ‑ 59 + 3 =
**TxPwr~max~ ~CTS-FP~** \+ 29
The following table which shows again the comparison of available and required
pathloss (including body loss) between CTS-FP and GSM-MS is made for the GSM-
MS being in a coverage limited operation and receiving at sensitivity level.
* * *
TxPwr~max~ [dBm] 8 12 14 16 required coupling loss [dB] 40 44 46 48 available
coupling loss [dB] 40 40 40 40
* * *
Again here, in order to best fulfil the coupling loss requirements, it is
proposed to tighten the spectrum mask of the CTS-FP by 4 dB:
proposed **spectrum mask ~CTS-FP~ ~(dBc/100kHz)~** at 1,8 MHz frequency
separation: **-63 dBc** DCS1800
Then, the comparison of available and required pathloss (including body loss)
between CTS-FP and GSM-MS (with the GSM-MS operating in a coverage limited
operation receiving at sensitivity level) becomes.
* * *
TxPwr~max~ [dBm] 8 12 14 16 required coupling loss [dB] 36 40 42 44 available
coupling loss [dB] 40 40 40 40
* * *
Regarding these values, we propose **a maximum CTS-FP transmit power
TxPwr~max~ of +12 dBm for DCS1800.**
### S.2.3.2 Spectrum due to modulation and wide band noise
In the previous section, a tightening of the spectrum mask for the CTS-FP is
proposed for 1,8 MHz frequency separation. In order to simplify the
specification of the spectrum due to modulation and wide band noise, it is
proposed to consider only two frequency bands above 1,8 MHz: 1,8 - 6MHz and >
6 MHz. The resulting CTS-FP spectrum mask is.
+-------------------------------+--------+---------+ | | GSM900 | DCS1800 | +-------------------------------+--------+---------+ | spectrum mask [dBc] | -68 | -63 | | | | | | 1,8 MHz ‑ 6 MHz / 100 kHz bdw | | | +-------------------------------+--------+---------+ | spectrum mask [dBc] | -71 | -67 | | | | | | > 6 MHz / 100 kHz bdw | | | +-------------------------------+--------+---------+
Below 1,8 MHz frequency separation, the existing MS spectrum due to modulation
and wide band noise characteristics shall be used for the CTS-FP
specification.
_Exception levels:_
Exceptions in the spectrum due to modulation and wide band noise requirements
are specified today in subclause 4.2.1 iii), iv) and v) of GSM 05.05. It has
been calculated in subclause 2.2 the maximum allowed wide band noise in a 100
kHz measurement bandwidth; the results are:
**Max. wide band noise** [dBm] in a 100 kHz measurement bandwidth = **-64,5
dBm** GSM900
**Max. wide band noise** [dBm] in a 100kHz measurement bandwidth = **-59 dBm**
DCS1800
These values have been used to calculate the maximum CTS-FP transmit power and
the CTS-FP spectrum mask, therefore it is proposed to use them as exception
levels for the spectrum due to modulation and wide band noise requirements for
frequency offsets above 1.8MHz : no further requirement below **-64 dBm
(GSM900)** or **-59 dBm (DCS1800)** is necessary.
For frequency offsets below 1.8MHz, the maximum allowed wide band noise in a
_30 kHz_ measurement bandwidth, derived from the maximum allowed wide band
noise in a _100 kHz_ measurement bandwidth can be calculated:
**Max. wide band noise** [dBm] in a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth
= Max. wbn [dBm] in a 100 kHz measurement bw + conv. fac. (100 -> 30 kHz) =
-64 - 5
= **-69 dBm** GSM900
**Max. wide band noise** [dBm] in a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth
= Max. wbn [dBm] in a 100 kHz measurement bw + conv. fac. (100 -> 30 kHz) =
-59 - 5
= **-64 dBm** DCS1800
It is proposed to use these values as exception levels for the spectrum due to
modulation and wide band noise requirements for frequency offset below 1,8
MHz: no further requirement below **-69 dBm (GSM900)** or **-64 dBm
(DCS1800)** is necessary.
## S.2.4 Balanced link for zero interference scenario (Interferer at MCL
scenario)
The maximum pathloss is given by:
**max PL = TxPwr~max\ CTS-FP~ ‑ body loss ‑ ref. sens.~CTS-MS~**
**max** **PL** [dB] = 11 ‑ 3 + 102 = **110 dB** GSM900
**max** **PL** [dB] = 12 ‑ 3 + 102 = **111 dB** DCS1800
In SMG2 Tdoc 188/98 the receiver sensitivity for pico-BTSs is deduced under
the boundary condition that the cell size will stay constant under all
conditions. However, this is not so important in a CTS environment. Here we
attach more importance to operate at a minimum transmit power. Therefore, the
receiver sensitivity of the CTS-FP should be the same as for the CTS-MS : ‑102
dBm. In that case, for balanced link operation, the TxPwr~max~ of the CTS-MS
is the same as for the CTS-FP:
**TxPwr~max\ CTS-MS~ = ref. sens.~CTS-FP~ + body loss + max PL**
**TxPwr~max~** **~CTS-MS~ =** -102 + 3 + 110 = **11 dBm** GSM900
**TxPwr~max~** **~CTS-MS~** = -102 + 3 + 111 = **12 dBm** DCS1800
Following the outcome of the discussion in SMG2 WPB meeting in Milano, 2^nd^ ‑
6^th^ November 1998, the minimum transmit power TxPwr~min~ of the CTS-FP shall
be reduced in order to decrease further interference form CTS on GSM (see
subclause 2.6). However, the minimum transmit power of the CTS-MS shall be
kept at +5 dBm for GSM900 and 0 dBm for DCS1800 for practical reasons
concerning implementation.
This will lead to the fact that the link will be balanced for CTS-FP transmit
power levels above +5 dBm for GSM900 and 0 dBm for DCS1800. For CTS-FP
transmit power levels below +5 dBm for GSM900 and 0 dBm for DCS1800 it is
acceptable that the link will not be balanced anymore in favour of
interference reduction.
## S.2.5 Range of Coverage for CTS:
Using the indoor pathloss law (see subclause 1.1.4) the range of coverage
(maximum distance between CTS-FP and CTS-MS d~max~) can be calculated. The
pathloss is given by:
**PL [dB] = 31,5 + 20 log[d] + 0,9 d** GSM900
and
**PL [dB] = 37,5 + 20 log[d] + 0,9 d** DCS1800
Two cases have to be distinguished, the zero interference and the MCL
scenario.
_For GSM900:_
Zero interference scenario:
**max** **PL** [dB] = 11 ‑ 3 + 102 = **110 dB**
=> d~max~ = 49,5 m
Interferer at MCL scenario:
The minimum wanted signal level Rlev for the CTS-FP is given by the spectrum
due to modulation and wideband noise of an uncoordinated GSM-MS (interferer).
The receive level Rlev for 1,8 MHz frequency separation is:
**Rlev = TxPwr~GSM-MS~ + conv. fac. (200 - > 30 kHz) - spectrum mask~GSM-MS~
+\ conv. fac. (100 -> 200 kHz) ‑ MCL + C/I**
**Rlev** [dBm] = 33 ‑ 8 ‑ 63 + 3 ‑ 34.5 + 9 = **‑60,5 dBm**
The available pathloss for the CTS in that case and the corresponding maximum
distance between CTS-FP and CTS-MS are:
**max** **PL = TxPwr ‑ Rlev ‑ 3 dB body loss**
**max** **PL** [dB] = 11 + 60,5 ‑ 3 = **68,5 dB**
**= > d~max~ = 14,9 m**
_For DCS1800:_
Zero interference scenario:
**max** **PL** [dB] = 12 ‑ 3 + 102 = **111 dB**
**= > d~max~ = 45 m**
Interferer at MCL scenario:
Again, the minimum wanted signal level Rlev for the CTS-FP is given by the
spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise of an uncoordinated GSM-MS
(interferer). The receive level Rlev for 1,8 MHz frequency separation is:
**Rlev = TxPwr~GSM-MS~ + conv. fac. (200 - > 30 kHz) - spectrum mask~GSM-MS~\
conv. fac. (100 -> 200 kHz) ‑ MCL + C/I**
**Rlev** [dBm] = 30 ‑ 8 ‑ 60 + 3 ‑ 40.5 + 9 = **‑66,5 dBm**
The available pathloss for the CTS in that case and the corresponding maximum
distance between CTS-FP and CTS-MS are:
**max** **PL = TxPwr ‑ Rlev ‑ 3 dB body loss**
**max** **PL** [dB] = 12 + 66,5 ‑ 3 = **75,5 dB**
**= > d~max~ = 15,6 m**
For both frequency bands, GSM900 and DCS1800, this range is reasonable for CTS
applications, but **it shows also clearly that the maximum transmit power
TxPwr~max~ specified above shall not be below +11 dBm for GSM900 and +12 dBm
for DCS1800**.
## S.2.6 Minimum CTS-FP transmit power
As already mentioned above, the outcome of the discussion in SMG2 WPB meeting
in Milano, 2^nd^ - 6^th^ November 1998, is that the minimum transmit power of
the CTS-FP shall be reduced in order to decrease further interference from CTS
on GSM. The minimum transmit power of the CTS-MS shall be kept at +5 dBm for
GSM900 and 0 dBm for DCS1800 to ease the implementation of CTS in the CTS-MS
(no hardware changes).
The CTS-FP shall have a certain transmit power range in order to use an
efficient power control on the downlink. However, an acceptable compromise has
to be found between a low minimum transmit power and the implementation cost
in the CTS-FP.
The CTS-FP is a new GSM component which is likely to re-use existing
technologies which have shown effectiveness in the past and present. In
particular technologies used for the MS have some similarities to those needed
for the CTS-FP and CTS-MS. Among these technologies are the components for the
RF front end of the terminal, i.e. power amplification, power detection (loop
back control), etc... which will be directly impacted by lower transmit power
levels.
A reasonable evolution of those components, necessary to obtain lower transmit
power levels, can be achieved with the following proposal for the power
control range:
**CTS-FP power control range = 20 dB.**
From that value and from the maximum transmit power levels TxPwr~max\ CTS-FP~
defined in subclause 2.3.1 it follows for the minimum CTS-FP transmit power
level TxPwr~min~:
**TxPwr~min\ CTS-FP~ = -9 dBm** for GSM900
and
**TxPwr~min\ CTS-FP~ = -8dBm** for DCS1800
## S.2.7 Power Level Distribution
For the CTS-FP power control range defined above, it can be roughly estimated
which percentage of calls will be operated with the minimum transmit power
under zero interference condition. We assume that the CTS-MSs will be evenly
distributed over the coverage range. This is really a worst case with respect
to the transmit power because there will be clearly a maximum in the distances
distribution of the CTS-MS more closer to the CTS-FP. However it gives a first
impression about power level distribution.
For the calculations we use the power control range of 20 dB proposed in
subclause 2.6. Furthermore it is assumed that power control optimises the
transmit power to achieve a receive level of ‑85 dBm at the CTS-MS receiver.
_GSM900:_
For the assumed power control range and using the assumed spatial distribution
of CTS-MSs within the coverage range as well as the pathloss law defined in
subclause 1.1.4, the CTS-FP transmit power level is in:
**28%** of the calls at the minimum transmit power level of **TxPwr~min\ CTS-
FP~ = ‑9 dBm**
_DCS1800:_
The minimum transmit power level for DCS1800 was defined to be ‑8 dBm and the
maximum transmit power level +12 dBm. For these data the CTS-FP transmit power
is in:
**24%** of the calls at the minimum transmit power level of **TxPwr~min\ CTS-
FP~ = ‑8 dBm**
Though this is only a very rough estimation it shows clearly that power
control can reduce interference for a significant percentage of calls. A more
realistic distances distribution will increase these figures while
consideration of interference limited situations will cause a decrease.
Nevertheless, the power control range of 20 dB for the CTS-FP seems to be
reasonable with respect to implementation and interference reduction.
## S.2.8 Spurious Emission
The spurious transmission in the relevant transmit band of the CTS-FP should
remain at ‑36 dBm measured in 30 kHz bandwidth for an offset between 1,8 MHz
and 6 MHz and in 100 kHz bandwidth for an offset larger than 6 MHz.
Within the receive band the maximum allowed power level Txlev~max~ is given by
the receiver sensitivity and the coupling loss. Two cases have been
considered, the reception by an uncoordinated CTS-FP receiver and by an
uncoordinated pico-BTS. For the coupling loss a minimum distance of 1 m with
one wall in-between (7 dB loss) or, which is equivalent for GSM900 and
DCS1800, a distance of 2 m without wall is assumed. The corresponding losses
are 39,4 dB for GSM900 and 45,4 dB for DCS1800 (indoor path loss model from
subclause 1.1.4).
Due to the fact that the CTS-PF is a one carrier base station no multiple
interferer margin was considered.
**Txlev~max~ = ref.sens. ‑ C/I + coupling loss + conv. fac. (200 - > 100
kHz)**
1) Spurious emission received by an uncoordinated CTS-FP:
**Txlev~max\ ~**[dBm] = -102 ‑ 9 + 39,4 - 3 = -74,6 dBm GSM900
**Txlev~max\ ~**[dBm] = -102 ‑ 9 + 45,4 - 3 = -68,6 dBm DCS1800
2) Spurious emission received by an uncoordinated pico-BTS:
This case is less stringent because of the higher receiver sensitivity level
of the pico-BTS compared to a CTS-FP:
**Txlev~max\ ~**[dBm] = -88 ‑ 9 + 39,4 - 3 = -60,6 dBm GSM900
**Txlev~max\ ~**[dBm] = -95 ‑ 9 + 45,4 - 3 = -61,6 dBm DCS1800
In both cases the requirements are less stringent than for the MS->MS case
which allows manufacturer a low cost re-use of hardware components.
We propose the maximum allowed power level Txlev~max~ in the receive band to
be **‑75 dBm for GSM900** and **‑69 dBm for DCS1800**.
# S.3 Receiver characteristics
## S.3.1 Blocking
Following SMG2 Tdoc 188/98 the dynamic range of the receiver is given by the
maximum power received from a MS at MCL (upper level) and by the minimum
signal level to be received from a MS to meet the reference sensitivity
requirement (lower level) ; in this case, the lower level is defined by the
wideband noise of an uncoordinated MS:
**dynamic range = max. power from uncoord. MS ‑ wanted CTS-FP receive level**
**during blocking = (TxPwr~GSM-MS~ ‑ MCL) ‑ ( MS wideband noise in 200 kHz ‑
MCL + C/I)**
_GSM900:_
dynamic range [dB] = (33 ‑ 34) ‑ (33 + conv.fac. (200 -> 30 kHz) ‑ spectrum
mask + conv. fac. (30 -> 200 kHz) ‑ 34 + 9)
_DCS1800:_
dynamic range [dB] = (30 ‑ 40) ‑ (30 + conv. fac. (200 -> 30 kHz) ‑ spectrum
mask + conv. fac. (30 -> 200 kHz) ‑ 40 + 9)
* * *
Dynamic range GSM900 DCS1800 600 kHz ≤ \|f-f~0~\| \= 3 MHz: **CTS-FP blocking level** [dBm] **=** -102 + 3 + 69 =
**-30 dBm**
For GSM900 and DCS1800 these values are between 2 dB and 9 dB less stringent
than the MS blocking levels. However, we propose not to loosen the blocking
requirement of the CTS-FP in order to keep a similar hardware for the CTS-FP
and CTS-MS; **the assumptions for blocking in subclause 1.1.2 are therefore
justified**.
## S.3.2 AM suppression
GSM-CTS is basically very similar to a pico BTS environment. In order to allow
a direct comparison with pico BTS scenarios, this chapter is made analog to
the argumentation in SMG2 WBP Tdoc 188/98. There it is shown that, especially
for the for AM suppression test scenarios, precautions have to be made in
order to prevent other interference mechanisms to falsify the measurement
results. For the test scenarios no MSM margin must be applied. First of all
these interference mechanisms will be investigated.
### S.3.2.1 Spectrum due to modulation
a) uncoordinated MS -> CTS-FP
The maximum allowed noise level at the interferer site is:
**Rlev~max\ noise\ at\ FP~ = CTS-FP ref. sensitivity ‑ C/I + MCL**
This leads to
**Rlev~max\ noise\ at\ FP~**[dB] = -102 ‑ 9 + 34.5 = **-76,5 dBm** GSM900
and
**Rlev~max\ noise\ at\ FP~**[dB] = -102 ‑ 9 + 40 = **-71 dBm** DCS1800
The maximum generated noise due to modulation for >6MHz frequency offset is:
**MS~noise~ = TxPwr~max\ MS~ + conv. factor (peak - > 30kHz) ‑ spectrum mask +
conv. factor (100 kHz -> 200 kHz)**
For an interfering CTS-MS:
**CTS-MS~noise~**[dBm] = 11 ‑8 ‑71 +3 = **-65 dBm** GSM900
**CTS-MS~noise~**[dBm] = 12 ‑8 ‑67 +3 = **-60 dBm** DCS1800
For an interfering GSM-MS the maximum noise is larger due to the higher
transmit power:
**GSM-MS~noise~**[dBm] = 33 ‑8 ‑71 +3 = **-43 dBm** GSM900
**GSM -MS~noise~**[dBm] = 30 ‑8 ‑73 +3 = **-48 dBm** DCS1800
The maximum noise requirement is missed by 11,5 dB for an interfering CTS-MS,
by 33,5 dB for an interfering GSM900 GSM-MS and by 23 dB for an interfering
DCS1800 GSM-MS.
b) uncoordinated BTS/CTS-FP -> CTS-MS
The maximum allowed noise level at the interferer site is:
**Rlev~max\ noise\ at\ MS~ = CTS-MS ref. sensitivity ‑ C/I + MCL**
This leads due to equivalent reference sensitivities to the same figures as in
case a):
**Rlev~max\ noise\ at\ MS~**[dB] = -102 ‑ 9 + 34.5 = **-76,5 dBm** GSM900
and
**Rlev~max\ noise\ at\ MS~**[dB] = -102 ‑ 9 + 40 = **-71 dBm** DCS1800
The maximum noise due to modulation for > 6 MHz frequency offset is
BTS~noise~ = TxPwr~max\ BTS~ + conv. factor (peak -> 30 kHz) ‑ spectrum mask +
conv. factor (100 kHz -> 200 kHz)
For an interfering CTS-FP the maximum noise is:
**CTS-FP~noise~**[dBm] = 11 ‑8 ‑71 +3 = **-65 dBm** GSM900
**CTS-FP~noise~**[dBm] = 12 ‑8 ‑67 +3 = **-60 dBm** DCS1800
For an interfering pico-BTSa higher transmit power and a higher sideband
modulation suppression applies:
**pico BTS~noise~**[dBm] = 20 ‑8 ‑80 +3 = **-65dBm** GSM900
**pico BTS~noise\ ~**[dBm] = 23 ‑8 ‑80 +3 = **-62dBm** DCS1800
The maximum noise requirement is missed by 11,5 dB for GSM900 and by 11 dB for
DCS1800.
### S.3.2.2 Switching transients
a) uncoordinated MS -> CTS-FP
The maximum allowed peak level at the interferer site is:
**Plev~max\ at\ FP~ = CTS-FP ref. sensitivity ‑ C/I + MCL + transient margin**
This leads to:
**Plev~max\ at\ FP~**[dB] = -102 ‑ 9 + 34.5 +20 = **-56,5 dBm** GSM900
and
**Plev~max\ at\ FP~**[dB] = -102 ‑ 9 + 40 + 20 = **-51 dBm** DCS1800
The maximum generated power level for >1.8MHZ frequency offset according to
GSM 05.05 is:
**MS~switching\ transients~ = -36 dBm** GSM900/DCS1800
The requirement is therefore missed by 20,5 dB for GSM900 and by 15 dB for
DCS1800.
b) uncoordinated BTS/CTS-FP -> CTS-MS
The maximum allowed peak level at the interferer site is:
**Plev~max\ at\ MS~ = CTS-MS ref. sensitivity ‑ C/I + MCL + transient margin**
This leads to:
**Plev~max\ at\ MS~**[dB] = -102 ‑ 9 + 34.5 +20 = **-56,5 dBm** GSM900
and
**Plev~max\ at\ MS~**[dB] = -102 ‑ 9 + 40 + 20 = **-51 dBm** DCS1800
The maximum generated power level for a CTS-FP and a pico-BTS and >1.8MHZ
frequency offset according to GSM 05.05:
**CTS-FP~switching\ transients~ = -36 dBm** GSM900/DCS1800
Due to the same reference sensitivities and the same requirement for the
maximum generated power level from GSM05.05 the figures are the same as for
case a). Therefore, the requirement is also missed by 20,5 dB for GSM900 and
by 15 dB for DCS1800.
### S.3.2.3 Blocking
a) uncoordinated MS -> CTS-FP
The maximum generated signal power level at the CTS-FP receiver site is:
Plev~max\ at\ FP~ = TxPwr~MS~ - MCL
For a CTS-MS:
**Plev~max\ at\ FP~**[dBm] = 11 ‑34.5 = **-23,5 dBm** GSM900
**Plev~max\ at\ FP~**[dBm] = 12 ‑40 = **-28 dBm** DCS1800
The blocking requirements for the CTS-FP according to subclause 3.1 are ‑23
dBm for GSM900 and ‑26 dBm for DCS1800. These requirements are fulfilled.
For a GSM-MS a higher transmit power applies:
**Plev~max\ at\ FP~**[dBm] = 33 ‑ 34,5 = **-1,5 dBm** GSM900
**Plev~max\ at\ FP~**[dBm] = 30 ‑ 40 = **-10,dBm** DCS1800
Here the blocking requirement is missed by 22 dB for GSM900 and 18 dB for
DCS1800.
b) uncoordinated BTS/CTS-FP -> CTS-MS
The maximum generated signal power level at the CTS-MS receiver site is:
**Plev~max\ at\ MS~ = TxPwr~BTS/FP~ ‑MCL**
For a CTS-FP:
**Plev~max\ at\ MS~**[dBm] = 11 ‑ 34,5 = **-23,5 dBm** GSM900
**Plev~max\ at\ MS~**[dBm] = 12 ‑ 40 = **-28 dBm** DCS1800
The blocking requirements for the CTS-MS according to GSM 05.05 are ‑23 dBm
for GSM900 and ‑26 dBm for DCS1800. These requirements are fulfilled.
For a pico BTS:
**Plev~max\ at\ MS~**[dBm] = 20 ‑ 34,5 = **-14,5 dBm** GSM900
**Plev~max\ at\ MS~**[dBm] = 23 ‑ 40 = **-17 dBm** DCS1800
In this case the blocking requirement is missed by 8,5 dB for GSM900 and 9 dB
for DCS1800.
### S.3.2.4 Specification of AM Suppression
The scenarios of subclauses 3.2.1 to 3.2.3 show that, based on GSM 05.05
specifications, interference from these scenarios will limit the receiver
performance. This will also give an indication for the AM suppression test
condition. For that we have to distinguish two cases concerning CTS and GSM
interferers separately.
Concerning interference from CTS-MS or CTS-FP transmitters the largest
deviation from the requirements in the scenarios discussed above comes from
switching transients. The maximum failure from the requirement is 20,5 dB for
GSM900 and 15 dB for DCS1800, same for uplink and downlink. These figures are
essentially the same as for the pico BTS scenarios, see for comparison SMG2
WPB Tdoc 188/98.
Following the logic from that paper, the signal level for the AM suppression
test has to be lowered by the maximum deviation outlined above in order to
allow proper testing. From that the maximum interferer power levels for the AM
suppression test are:
**PL~AM\ suppression\ test~ = TxPwr~max~ ‑ MCL ‑ deviation**
Therefore:
**PL~AM\ suppression\ test~[dBm] = 11 ‑ 34,5 ‑ 20,5 = ‑44d Bm** GSM900
and
**PL~AM\ suppression\ test~[dBm] = 12 ‑ 40 ‑ 15 = ‑43 dBm** DCS1800
Concerning interference from a GSM-MS, the largest deviation comes from the
spectrum mask. The maximum failure is 33,5 dB for GSM900 and 23 dB for
DCS1800. The maximum interferer power levels for the AM suppression test for
this case are:
**PL~AM\ suppression\ test~**[dBm] = 33 ‑ 34,5 ‑ 33,5 = **‑35 dBm** GSM900
and
**PL~AM\ suppression\ test~**[dBm] = 30 ‑ 40 ‑ 23 = **‑33 dBm** DCS1800
All these values are less stringent than the actual GSM 05.05 specification
for the AM suppression of a GSM-MS (which is ‑31 dBm for both, GSM900 and
DCS1800) and of a pico-BTS (which is -21 dBm in GSM900 and -26 dBm in
DCS1800). Due to the fact, that the CTS-FP shall re-use the existing MS
hardware as far as possible, we propose to take the GSM 05.05 AM suppression
specification of ‑31 dBm for the CTS-FP.
## S.3.3 Intermodulation
### S.3.3.1 uncoordinated CTS-MSs -> GSM-BTS
Two cases will be considered here concerning CTS to GSM interactions. In the
first one, the transmission of two CTS‑MSs will cause intermodulation products
in a GSM BTS receiver located in close proximity to the CTS-MSs. The most
critical case is that of a pico-BTS because distances to the CTS-MSs down to 1
meter have to be considered here. Both CTS-MSs are uncoordinated to the GSM-
BTS. This corresponds to scenario 4 of GSM 05.50 annex A, figure 3.2 bottom.
The maximum received power level at the GSM-BTS is:
**Rlev = TxPwr~CTS-MS~ ‑ MCL~CTS-MS\ - >\ GSM-BTS~ + margin for other IMs**
For the maximum CTS-MS transmit power defined in subclause 2.4 it follows:
**Rlev** [dBm] = 11 ‑ 34.5 + 3 = **-20,5 dBm** GSM900
and
**Rlev** [dBm] = 12 ‑ 40 + 6 = **-22 dBm** DCS1800
### S.3.3.2 uncoordinated CTS-FPs -> MS
In the second case, the transmission of two CTS-FPs will cause intermodulation
products in a MS (CTS or GSM) receiver located in close proximity to the CTS-
FPs. This scenario is similar to scenario 3 of GSM 05.50 annex A, figure 3.2
middle, except for the fact that the CTS-FP is a one carrier machine and both
signals will stem from two uncoordinated CTS-FPs.
The maximum received power level, now at the MS site, is given by the same
expression as above:
**Rlev = TxPwr~CTS-FP~ ‑ MCL~CTS-FP\ - >\ MS~ + margin for other IMs**
For the maximum CTS-FP transmit power defined in subclause 2.3 it follows:
**Rlev** [dBm] = 11 ‑ 34.5 + 3 = **-20,5 dBm** GSM900
and
**Rlev** [dBm] = 12 ‑ 40 + 6 = **-22dBm** DCS1800
In both cases considered above (subclauses 3.3.1 and 3.3.2), the MCLs have to
be relaxed in order to meet the requirements of GSM 05.05. However, comparison
to pico-BTS scenarios (SMG2 WPB Tdoc 188/98) show that here, for both cases,
the situation is much less critical. According to GSM 05.50 annex A, an
increase of the coupling loss of 1 dB will reduce the 3^rd^ order IM product
by 3 dB; thus if the MCL assumption is increased by 10 dB, the maximum power
level for generated intermodulation products for both cases discussed above to
will be:
> **PL** ~Intermodulation\ test~ [dBm] = -20,5 dBm - 30 dB = **-50,5dBm**
> GSM900
and
> **PL** ~Intermodulation\ test~ [dBm] = -22 dBm - 30 dB = **-52 dBm** DCS1800
These figures meet, for both cases discussed above, the intermodulation
requirements of GSM 05.05 subclause 5.3 for both the MS (CTS and GSM) and the
BTS.
### S.3.3.3 uncoordinated GSM-MSs -> CTS-FP
For the case of two GSM-MSs located close to a CTS-FP a higher receive level
is observed due to the higher GSM-MS transmit power. This scenario corresponds
to scenario 4 of GSM 05.50 annex A, figure 3.2 bottom:
**Rlev** [dBm] = 33 ‑ 34,5 + 3 = **1,5 dBm** GSM900
and
**Rlev** [dBm] = 30 ‑ 40 + 6 = **-4 dBm** DCS1800
These figures correspond exactly to those of uncoordinated GSM-MSs located in
close proximity of a pico BTS (see Tdoc SMG2 WPB Tdoc 188/98). Like there a
relaxation of the MCL of 17 dB will reduce the IM products by 52 dB and the
requirements become:
**PL** ~Intermodulation\ test~ [dBm] = 1,5 dBm - 52 dB = **-50,5 dBm** GSM900
and
**PL** ~Intermodulation\ test~ [dBm] = -4 dBm - 52 dB = **-56 dBm** DCS1800
These figures meet the requirements of GSM 05.05, subclause 5.3, which give
intermodulation levels of -49 dBm for both GSM900 and DCS1800 MS. Due to the
fact, that the CTS-FP shall re-use the existing MS hardware as far as
possible, it is proposed to re-use the MS requirements for the specification
of the CTS-FP intermodulation.
# S.4 CTS-FP TI5 performance requirements
The CTS-FP shall meet the static channel performance as specified in GSM
05.05. The only other radio propagation channel that is relevant to the
performance of the CTS-FP is as for the pico-BTS the TI 5 channel.
Therefore the argumentation developed in Tdoc SMG2 WPB 188/98 clause 12 is
proposed to be applied to the CTS‑FP : the performance figures for TU50 no FH
at 900MHz are adopted and are met in the TI5 channel when the signal level is
increased by 3 dB above reference sensitivity level (for sensitivity
performance) and the carrier to interference level is increased by 4 dB above
reference sensitivity level (for interference performance).
## S.4.1 Nominal Error Rates for the CTS-FP
In CTS, the CTS-MS will access the CTS-FP on the CTSARCH at a distance smaller
than for a GSM MS accessing a BTS, however the transmit power for such
attempts will be decreased to 11 dBm in GSM900 and 12 dBm in DCS1800 (absolute
max. transmit powers in CTS).
In the following we reproduce the MCL distribution table first presented by
Motorola in SMG2 32/97 and Tdoc SMG2 WPB 188/98, and develop a table of
occurance probability for CTSARCH transmit power with a CTS-MS making CTSARCH
attempts at 11 dBm (GSM900) and 12 dBm (DCS1800).
The table below shows the MCL loss versus the chance of occurance.

* * *
If we now consider a CTS-MS at MCL sending a CTSARCH at maximum transmit power
(11 dBm for GSM900, 12 dBm for DCS1800), we can generate a table which shows
the received CTSARCH power levels at the CTS-FP versus probability of
occurance.

These maximum received levels are below the existing maximum received power
levels at which the NER performance of a MS shall be maintained (-15 dBm in
GSM900 and -23 dBm in DCS1800). As the CTS-FP shall re-use the existing MS
hardware as far as possible, it is proposed to specify that the CTS-FP shall
maintain a BER \ 380.2 -- 389.8 MHz: mobile transmit, base receive;

be selected from any part of the band consistent with this transition band.

# T.2 System Scenario Calculations for GSM400 systems
## T.2.1 Worst case proximity scenarios
The purpose of the present document is to justify the adoption of E-GSM900
radio frequency requirements to GSM400 systems with minimal changes. This will
make it easy to adapt standard GSM technology. Parameters like body loss and
multiple interference margin are chosen to be identical that was used in
GSM900 or DCS1800 system scenario calculations performed earlier in SMG. This
was decided for to keep comparison with different system scenario calculations
easy. It has to be noted that with chosen approach the GSM400 scenario
calculations are little too pessimistic compared for scenarios in reality.
As was seen with GSM900 and DCS1800 cases all worst case scenarios are not
met. Compromises have been made while the parameters have been statistical
probabilities of occurrences and implementation issues. Evidently it would
also be more severe to block a BTS than a single MS. Statistical properties of
occurrence state that coordinated case is more important to fulfill than
uncoordinated case. Because of narrow spectrum available at GSM400 bands it is
relevant to assume that systems are operated in a coordinated manner in vast
majority of cases. Uncoordinated scenarios might happen in some cases and thus
those are also discussed in scenario calculations.
Tables below show examples of close proximity scenarios in urban and rural
environments for GSM400 and GSM900 systems. Different antenna heights are
considered in different environments. Low antennas are assumed to have lower
gain (10 dBi) than high antennas, that is (18 dBi) for GSM900 and (14 dBi) for
GSM400.

Path loss is assumed to be free space i.e. 25,5 + 20 log d(m) dB for GSM400
systems and 31,5 + 20 log d(m) dB for GSM900 systems, where d is the length of
the sloping line connecting the transmit and receive antennas. The coupling
loss is defined between antenna connectors. The transmitter power and receiver
sensitivity is measured at the respective antenna connectors.
Coupling between BTSs may result either from the co-siting of BTSs or from
several BTSs in close proximity with directional antenna. The minimum coupling
loss between BTSs is assumed to be 30 dB. This is defined as the loss between
the transmitter combiner output and the receiver multi-coupler input.
GSM400 systems are targeted to offer large coverage in rural areas. It is
reasonable to assume that BTS heights in rural area are higher than in urban
area thus minimum coupling loss (MCL) value of 65 dB between BTS and MS is
valid assumption in rural areas. For GSM900 system scenario calculations
performed earlier dense urban area MCL value of 59 dB was used. With the
identical scenario GSM400 systems will provide 6 dB less MCL thus resulting
into the value 53 dB.
MS to MS close proximity MCL for DCS1800 was 40,5 dB and 6 dB less for GSM900.
Straightforward calculation suggests using MCL of 28,5 dB for the worst case
MS to MS scenario. Recent measures indicate that body loss for small hand sets
is rather 10 dB than 1 dB (GSM 05.50 V6.0.2 annex H). By using this higher
body loss factor worst case scenario requirements were much milder.
It can be concluded that worst case scenario requirements for GSM400 systems
are in some cases 6 dB tighter than for GSM900. This must be considered in
cellular planning recommendation GSM 03.30. It may be necessary to recommend
to utilise lower output power at GSM400 band BTSs in dense urban area if MCL
can be very small (i.e. low antenna heights). This is not a drawback anyway
while we remember that a useful carrier too has a smaller path loss at lower
frequencies, thus reduced output power is gained back and coverage for urban
cells can be maintained the same as at higher bands.
Worst case scenarios usually involve a \"near/far\" problem of some kind, the
component scenario assumptions as given in the scenarios paper for \"near\"
and \"far\" can be summarised as follows.
* * *
\"Near\" MCL [dB] BTS -> MS 53 MS -> BTS 53 MS -> MS 28.5 BTS -> BTS 30
* * *
* * *
\"Far\" TX power [dBm] RX Sensitivity [dBm] BTS 39 -104 MS 33 -102
* * *
Other parameters used in scenario calculations are:
* * *
Parameter Value [dB] BTS power control range 30 MS power control range 26 C/I
margin 9 Multiple interferers margin (MIM) 10 Transient margin 20 Margin for
other IM\'s 3
* * *
It can be speculated that MIM for GSM400 should be lower than 10 dB because of
lesser amount of carriers, but as was stated in the beginning GSM900 system
scenario calculation parameters are chosen for comparison reasons.

# T.4 Transmitter characteristics
For readability the chapter numbering in the transmitter and receiver
characteristics chapters are aligned with current GSM 05.05 chapter numbering.
The worst case scenario requirements and current GSM 05.05 specification for
GSM900 are summarized in the tables beginning of each relevant chapter.
Specification requirements in the table entries are converted to 200 kHz
bandwidth to be comparable for scenario calculation results.
## T.4.1 Output power
### T.4.1.1 Mobile Station
Coverage gain is seen as one of the major benefits for the down banded GSM
system. In order to gain the most of this benefit it was decided to allow the
same power classes for GSM400 as was initially chosen for GSM900.
The absolute tolerance on power control levels has been chosen to be the same
as with GSM900.
### T.4.1.2 Base Station
Following GSM900, the BTS power classes are specified at the combiner input.
In order to provide the operator some flexibility same power classes as for
GSM900 are chosen.
The tolerance on the BTS static power control step size is same as for GSM900.
## T.4.2 Output RF Spectrum
### T.4.2.1 Spectrum due to the modulation and wideband noise
_Coordinated case_
In coordinated case BTS wideband noise requirement are fulfilled with both
GSM900 and GSM400 systems and thus there is no need to change the
specification for BTS TX mask.
Worst case scenario requirements for MS wideband noise are tighter than for
BTS. Since the table entries in GSM 05.05 are relative, as the level of the
transmitter is reduced, the absolute specification becomes tighter. For
coordinated MS to BTS interference it is to be noted that power control works
and MS will be powered down. For MS close to BTS it is relevant to expect that
minimum MS TX power is used. Thus introduced wideband noise is reduced
accordingly down to ‑43 dBm at 600 kHz offset. Still there is a gap of 11 dB
in GSM900 scenarios and specification.
Probability of this scenario is low and actually allowing this to happen is
not practical cellular planning. Low power users operating very close to BTS
may block users locating in the edge area of very large cells that operate
with full power and still close to sensitivity level. In other words blocking
of some users at cell edge would require large cells in dense urban areas with
very small handover margin. In sensible cellular planning these should be
contradictory occurrences. Thus it was felt that there is no need to make
specification too tight because of speculation of some unpractical
occurrences.
_Uncoordinated case_
The theoretical worst case uncoordinated scenarios are missed quite a lot.
This was situation also in higher bands. Now the mismatch is about 6 dB worse
than in GSM900. In practice this situation is very rare. First as was
discussed earlier it is not probable that uncoordinated scenario should happen
in narrowband. Secondly the theoretical calculations are done while MS close
to disturbing BTS operates at sensitivity level which is not a common
situation.
If uncoordinated scenarios are planned it may be decided by the operators that
in dense urban areas where MCL may reach low values maximum power level is
reduced by 6 dB in respect to those used in GSM900 case. Still due to smaller
path loss, low powered GSM400 systems would offer equal coverage than GSM900
system. Down powering of system is a natural choice anyway in urban areas
where cellular planning is capacity driven rather than targeting to large
cells.
As a conclusion it is seen unnecessary to do any changes to existing GSM900
modulation mask while it is adapted to GSM400 systems.
### T.4.2.2 Spectrum due to switching transients
_Coordinated case_
GSM 05.05 defines modulation mask, switching transients, spurious emissions
and intermodulation specifications to be consistent with each other (GSM 05.50
V6.0.2 annex D). In previous it was justified that GSM900 modulation mask is
seen to be appropriate at 400 MHz bands. Due the consistence, current
switching transient requirements at 900 MHz band are enough at 400 MHz bands
also.
_Uncoordinated case_
For uncoordinated scenarios down banded system may need to be down powered in
dense urban scenarios to fulfil GSM900 performance. Down powering will affect
similarly for switching transients also and again it is felt that down powered
GSM400 systems perform as well as GSM900.
No changes in respect to GSM900 requirements are thus proposed.
## T.4.3 Spurious emissions
### T.4.3.1 Principle of the specification
No changes to measurement conditions are needed.

> {width="5.991666666666666in" height="0.9361111111111111in"}
### T.4.3.2 Base transceiver station
Current specification for BTS introduces ‑95 dBm level of spurious emissions
in 200 kHz BTS RX band. The transition band between TX and RX band is only 3
MHz for GSM400 systems that operate with full bandwidth and thus rather deep
sloped filtering is required. Current understanding is that the GSM900
specification can be adopted to GSM400 systems. (For R-GSM the requirement is
relaxed down to ‑86 dBm because of low number of carriers expected in R-GSM
BTS.)
While GSM400 BTS is co-sited with higher bands, measures must be taken for
mutual protection of receivers. GSM400 systems must not produce exceeding
noise level in relevant up-link bands for GSM900 and DCS1800. GSM900 and
DCS1800 are currently specified to allow at maximum ‑36 dBm spurious emissions
at 400 MHz bands while measured the peak power in 3 MHz band. This corresponds
to about ‑56 dBm at 200 kHz peak power value. This does not quite match with
the requirements for GSM400 systems. However no changes to higher band
specifications are proposed anyway while GSM400 system is specified. If BTSs
of different frequency bands are co-sited the coupling loss must be increased
by antenna arrangement or with external filters, but this must not be a part
of GSM specification.
### T.4.3.3 Mobile station
In idle mode power measured in GSM900 down link band is limited to ‑57 dBm at
100 kHz measurement band. In up link band allowed level is ‑59 dBm. For uplink
the wideband noise scenario requirement is ‑60 dBm at 200 kHz band. Due to
different measurement methods (i.e. average vs. peak value) in wideband noise
and spurious emission conditions it is reasonable to assume that GSM900
requirements can be adopted to GSM400 systems.
When allocated a channel existing GSM900 and DCS1800 are currently specified
to allow at maximum ‑36 dBm spurious emission peaks at 9 kHz ‑ 1 GHz bands
with measurement conditions specified in GSM 05.05. No changes is proposed for
GSM400 systems.
When allocated a channel spurious emission at MS RX band for E-GSM is ‑67 dBm
at 100 kHz band. This is relaxed from the original P-GSM requirement ‑79 dBm.
Requirement is further relaxed to ‑60 dBm for R-GSM MS. The initial
discussions with component manufacturers indicate that TX filter that limits
spurious emissions at 3 MHz from the band edge down to ‑67 dBm in GSM400 bands
would be feasible. It is considered that -62 dBm for T-GSM 380 & 410 is
achievable even with a transition band of only 2 MHz. The requirement is in
line with the requirements for existing services in these bands.
## T.4.4 Radio frequency tolerance
No reason for changes in GSM 05.05 (defined in GSM 05.10).
## T.4.5 Output level dynamic operation
### T.4.5.1 Base station
This specification only affects the interference experienced by co-channel
cells in the same PLMN. The requirement on the relative power level of
unactivated timeslots is -30 dBc that is in line with the BTS power control
range.
No reason to modify current specification.
### T.4.5.2 Mobile station
Tightening this requirement from current GSM900 specification would mean that
the requirement for active MS would be about as tight as requirement in idle
mode. This is not felt to be a reasonable requirement and thus it is proposed
that GSM900 specification is adopted without changes.
The same relaxation as for GSM900 at preceding slot is allowed.
## T.4.6 Phase accuracy
No reason for changes in GSM 05.05 (defined in GSM 05.04).
## T.4.7 Intermodulation attenuation
For GSM900 system intermodulation attenuation is specified only for BTS.
Required intermodulation attenuation in coordinated case for both GSM900 and
GSM400 systems is 42 dB while current specification states that attenuation is
70 dB.
No changes are proposed for intermodulation attenuation specification.

GSM400 system passband and transition band between TX and RX bands are much
smaller than in GSM900 system. While determining out-of-band limits it was
decided to keep the ratio of passband and transition band about the same as
for GSM900 system. Thus out-of-band transition bandwidth at high frequencies
is chosen to be 6 MHz, which is relatively the same as for GSM where 20 MHz
was chosen. Passband to transition band ratio for GSM400 system is quite close
to the respective ratio in E-GSM, thus E-GSM has been chosen as a reference
system for low out-of-band blocking requirements.

NOTE: Although the T-GSM 380 and T-GSM 410 bands are 10 MHz wide, because a

be selected from any part of the band consistent with this transition band.

* * *
The out-of-band blocking specification relates to the GSM400 band and the
feasibility of the receiver filter. Due to narrow gap between TX and RX bands
at low frequency side of the MS out-of-band blocking requirement is chosen to
be same as for EGSM i.e. ‑5 dBm. At the high frequency side of the MS GSM900
out-of-band blocking requirement of value 0 dBm has been chosen.
The MS in-band blocking specification close to the received channel has not
been changed, this is limited by the receiver synthesizer phase noise. The
blocking specification at > 3 MHz offset still misses the scenario
requirements T.3.2.1.1 and T.3.2.1.4. Power consumption considerations make it
anyway undesirable to further tighten the specification. Power consumption
would grow, because of the extra current needed to compensate the losses in
filters. While considering the low amount of interfering carriers in GSM400
systems the scenario is in practice very close to current GSM900 scenario.
The combinations of these proposal amounts to a filter specification over the
MS receive band as shown below.

# V.5 Discussion of RIT measurement performance of TOA LMU
For Uplink-TOA, the LMU is required to perform Radio Interface Timing (RIT)
measurements to associate GSM time for a BTS to the time base the LMU is using
(i.e. GPS time) (GSM 04.71). This RIT measurement allows the SMLC to calculate
for each TOA measuring LMU a correlation search window which contains the
correlation peak corresponding to the propagation delay of the mobiles signal.
The width of this correlation search window is established by the maximum
range ambiguity from the mobile to each LMU plus additional system errors. The
range ambiguity arrises because the location of the mobile prior to the
location measurement is known only to within the serving cell or sector plus
Timing Advance (TA) radius. Additional ambiguity is introduced from Timing
Advance errors, BTS and LMU location errors, MS transmitt timing uncertainties
and RIT measurement errors. An RIT measurement error up to ±2 bits is
typically a minor component of the overall ambiguity and does not impact the
performance of the Uplink TOA location system.
# V.6 Simulations Results for E-OTD LMUs and E-OTD Capable MSs
## V.6.1 Introduction
E-OTD LMUs\' and E-OTD MSs measurement performance are specified in GSM 05.05
annex H.2 and I, respectively. The object of this section is to give some
justification for the figures found in the requirements in GSM 05.05.
First, a presentation of the simulation results for E-OTD measurement accuracy
is given. The simulations show the E‑OTD accuracy achieved for the
configurations used in GSM 05.05. Secondly, simulation results for the overall
location accuracy achieved in an idealised network are also provided.
There are equal requirements for an E-OTD LMU and an E-OTD capable MS. Hence,
the simulation results apply to both.
## V.6.2 E-OTD Measurement Accuracy
The downlink E-OTD positioning method requires the mobile to measure the time
of arrival of bursts received on the BCCH of neighbor sites relative to a
reference (or serving) site. Since a position calculation requires
measurements from at least three sites, the caller is positioned by measuring
the time of arrival of multiple GSM bursts transmitted on the Broadcast
Control Channel (BCCH) from at least three sites on the cell plan. The
simulations in this report only cover GMSK modulated bursts. In EDGE, it is
allowed to have 8-PSK modulated bursts on the BCCH carrier (on time slots
1-7). Annex V.B gives a presentation of the probability of distinguishing
8-PSK modulated bursts from GMSK modulated bursts.
For more detailed information about the E-OTD location method, see GSM 03.71
annex C.
### V.6.2.1 Sensitivity Performance
The been performed in the following way based on the requirements in GSM
05.05:
\- GMSK modulated normal bursts (TSC #0) have been used for E-OTD measurement.
The E-OTD MS receives a reference BCCH carrier with a power level of 20 dB
above the reference sensitivity level of ‑102 dBm.
The E-OTD MS receives a neighbour BCCH carrier with power levels in the range
of ‑8 to 20 dB relative the reference sensitivity level of ‑102 dBm.
The channel is static, remaining at a constant signal level throughout the
measurements.
The E-OTD Mobile Station receives twenty-six GMSK modulated normal bursts from
the reference site, and twenty-six GMSK modulated normal bursts from the
neighbour site.
The E-OTD Mobile Station uses a correlation search window of 9 bit periods,
i.e. it searches within ±4 bit periods of the actual location of the training
sequence. This corresponds to measurement uncertainty of ±14.76 μs (or ±4.4
km).
The E-OTD measurement algorithm was implemented using multipath rejection with
no measurement weighting.
The measurement accuracy of the E-OTD Mobile Station is defined as the RMS
value of 90% of the measurements that result in the least E-OTD error,
according to annex I.2.1 of GSM 05.05.
N=300 trials were used to determine the measurement error.
A SNR of 0 dB is assumed at an input power level of ‑110 dBm.
The simulation results are shown in figure V.6.1.

### V.6.2.2 Interference Performance
For interference simulations, conditions are for the static channel case, but
the neighbour BCCH carrier is now fixed at a power level of ‑82 dBm and has
one of the following interfering channels:
* * *
Interfering channel C/I Simulation range [dB] Co-channel interference 0 → 10
Adjacent channel interference: 200 kHz -18 → -8 Adjacent channel interference:
400 kHz -41 → -39

### V.6.2.3 Multipath performance
For multipath simulations, conditions are for the static channel case, but the
neighbour BCCH carrier now propagates through the TU3 channel. Results are
shown in figure V.6.5.
{width="5.115277777777778in" height="3.4229166666666666in"}
Figure V.6.5: E-OTD Mobile Station accuracy in the TU3 channel
NOTE: The purpose of the multipath test case in GSM 05.05 is only to guarantee
that the LMU and MS are able to handle multipath errors. The channel models
defined in GSM 05.05 (annex C) have only been chosen here to simplify testing
of LMUs and MSs. For evaluation of positioning systems, more complex channel
models have been developed, which are described in annex V.A.
## V.6.3 Location accuracy
This subclause aims to give a presentation of simulated location accuracy with
the simulation results shown in the previous section.
NOTE: Positioning performance is determined from a multitude of individual
links each with distinct operating point (_C/I_ and _E~b~/N~0~_), shadow
fading, and multipath dispersion. These random parameters, the random delay
estimates corresponding to unique realisations of noise and interference, plus
the unique solution geometry for any mobile location chosen in the service
area mean there is not a straightforward, systematic way to relate average
position location performance to individual link performance. The analysis
above is only valid under the given assumptions.
### V.6.3.1 Network parameters
Thirty-six base stations were arranged in a uniform 6 x 6 pattern over the
simulation area and assigned to the 4/12‑frequency plan. This frequency plan
is defined as having three (120°) sectors per site and four sites per cluster,
for a total of 108 sites on the cell plan. It is configured such that the same
sector of every other site is a co-channel interferer. The distance between
adjacent base stations was defined according to the assigned multipath
channel, in accordance with annex V.A.
Two hundred fifty mobile stations were randomly placed over the entire
simulation area. In order to simulate an infinite network (and thereby avoid
edge effects), the simulation area was wrapped around so that base stations
always surrounded every mobile, even those located at the edge. This technique
circumvented the problem of having a mobile at the edge experience less
interference than one located in the geometrical centre of the simulation
area. This wrap‑around technique permits a mobile that is making measurement
on the BCCH of a site located on the northwest border to experience
interference from co-channel sites located on the southeast border.
The following gives a summary of the simulation assumptions/parameters have
been used to simulate the network.

* * *
Only the MS E-OTD measurement accuracy has been taken into account in the
simulations. Perfect knowledge of RTD values is assumed. The channel models
used are the ones defined in annex V.A.
A least squares (LS) method has been used to calculate the position of the MS.

# V.7 BTS Frequency Source Stability, E-OTD reporting periods and E-OTD
Location Accuracy
## V.7.1 Factors determining E-OTD stability
In order to minimise network traffic required to support E-OTD LCS the OTDs
must be reported as infrequently as possible and so it becomes important to
determine the accuracy with which OTDs can be predicted. By viewing OTDs as
measuring the relative phase of BTS transmissions it is clear that it is the
phase stability of the BTS frequency source which determines the maximum
acceptable OTD reporting period.
Assuming that the systemic phase noise disturbances are Gaussian and that LMU
reporting period {width="0.1388888888888889in"
height="0.1527777777777778in"}is relatively short (1000s of seconds) then the
OTD Maximum Time Interval Error (MTIE, see ITU-T Recommendation G.810) is
related to the OTD reporting period τ by:
{width="2.9305555555555554in" height="0.5833333333333334in"}
where _E_[ ] denotes the mathematical expectation operator, _Var_[ ] denotes
the statistical variance of the bracketed quantity, _∆f/f~0~_ characterizes
the clock frequency accuracy, _D/f~0~_ characterizes the normalized clock
frequency drift rate, τ characterizes the time required to accumulate an OTD
error of MTIE = ∆ _t_ sec due to frequency instabilities, _C_ ~p~ sets the OTD
measurement integrity at probability percentile 100 _p_ , and (_∆f(τ)/f~0~_)
characterizes the RMS fractional frequency deviation which is related to the
TIE~rms~ (RMS Time Interval Error, see ITU-T Recommendation G.810).
The physics of equation (1) is particularly interesting, since it partitions
the frequency stability effects into two terms. The first term characterizes
the frequency instability degradations due to the average values of the
frequency offsets between BTS OTD reference signals. The second term
characterizes the RMS fluctuations of the BTS OTD reference signal frequency
offsets, their frequency drifts and the time dependent phase noise
fluctuations.
Since the OTD reference signal drift rate (aging) times the measurement period
will be small relative to the clock frequency offset and phase noise effects,
these terms can be neglected (or they can be estimated through signal
processing) for the {width="0.125in" height="0.1527777777777778in"} intervals
of interest. Thus (1) reduces to:
{width="1.625in" height="0.5555555555555556in"}
{width="4.44375in" height="0.69375in"}
From the perspectives of Equations (1-2), the OTD time stability requirements
can be assessed. Here _CP_ sets the OTD measurement integrity in a probability
sense that, after {width="0.1388888888888889in" height="0.1527777777777778in"}
seconds, the relative frequency difference between two BTS clocks will cause
{width="0.20833333333333334in" height="0.18055555555555555in"} seconds of time
error to accumulate between BTS clocks with probability _p_. For example, with
_p_ =0.997, then _C_ ~p~=3 and with _p_ =0.90, _C_ ~p~=1.65. The value of _C_
~p~ also serves to weight the relative importance of the systematic and random
frequency instability effects on the accumulation of time error.
Finally, if one further assumes that the OTD reference signal frequency
accuracies are also estimated using signal processing methods and that these
estimates are sufficiently accurate so as to place these disturbances well
below those set by the random phase noise effects, then (2) reduces to:
∆t = {width="1.2777777777777777in" height="0.2777777777777778in"}
This equation relates MTIE to the TIE~rms~ value as a function of the OTD
reporting period, τ, and can be used to demonstrate trade-offs between
location accuracy, MTIE, OTD reporting period and TIE~rms~ for a confidence
level of _p_.
## V.7.2 Relationship between range errors and location error
The relationship between E-OTD range measurement errors and location errors
depends on the number and relative positions of the BTSs present. This
relationship is sometimes summarised by a value known as the horizontal
dilution of precision, HDOP. Since at least three BTSs are required for E-OTD
location we consider as a reference scenario the case of three BTSs arranged
in an equilateral triangle. As an MS moves inside the equilateral triangle
defined by the BTSs the HDOP varies between 1.2, when the MS is at the
centroid, to a maximum of 2.6.
Table V.7.1: Location error as a function of OTD MTIE
+--------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------+ | E-OTD MTIE ± @ 95% | _r_ ~max~ ± @ 95% | E-OTD radial location error (rms) | +--------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------+ | 50 ns | 15 m | 09.1 m to 19.1 m | | | | | | 100 ns | 30 m | 18.3 m to 38.2 m | | | | | | 200 ns | 60 m | 36.7 m to 76.4 m | +--------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------+
Table V.7.1 shows the behaviour of location accuracy under the reference
scenario for three levels of timing error, OTD MTIE, and corresponding range
error, {width="0.2777777777777778in" height="0.25in"}. Note that the timing
error, E-OTD MTIE, is a function of both BTS frequency source stability and
the E-OTD reporting period (see GSM 5.10).
###### ### Annex V.A: Evaluation of Positioning Measurement Systems
# 1 Introduction
In order to evaluate and compare different positioning measurement systems, it
is highly desirable to define a common positioning simulator.
The single most important effect when evaluating positioning performance is
multi-path propagation. The performance of positioning measurement systems is
very dependent on the severity of the multi-path propagation. A simulator is
more efficient than field trials when evaluating performance with respect to
multi-path, since it can model a vast number of radio channels. Due to the
importance of multi-path, it is essential to define a common channel model
when comparing positioning performance.
The present document proposes a complete positioning simulator. The details
are however focused on the essential channel model. The proposed channel model
has a multi-path statistic that corresponds to a large number of field
measurements.
The outline is as follows. In Section 2 an overview of the positioning
simulator is provided. The remaining part of the document describes the
various components of the positioning simulator:
\- System Simulator (see clause 3).
\- Radio Link Simulator (see clause 4).
\- Channel Model (clauses 5 to 7).
\- Position Calculation and Statistical Evaluation (clause 8).
# 2 Positioning Simulator
In order to evaluate the positioning performance, it is not sufficient to only
simulate the measurement performance over a radio link. Instead an integrated
positioning simulator is needed. The positioning simulator performs the
following steps (see figure 2.1):
_Define environments and system parameters:_ This includes multi-path channel
characteristics, path loss parameters, inter-BS distance and frequency plans.
_System simulation:_ Generate frequency and cell plan. Randomly place MS on
the cell pattern. For each MS:
_Select measurement links:_ A strategy needs to be implemented which links to
use when to positioning the particular MS
_Determine characteristics for each link:_
EXAMPLE: C/I, C/N, C/A, distance (d), angle (α).
_Radio Link Simulation:_ For each link a realization of the channel model
needs to be utilized by the radio link simulator to determine the measurement
value and its corresponding measurement quality for the specific link.
_Position Calculation and Statistical Evaluation:_ Estimate the position of
the MS given the measurement data and BS locations. Compute circular error and
present statistics.

Figure 2.1: Positioning Simulator
# 3 System Simulator
The System Simulator is the basis of the Positioning Simulator. Here a cell
and frequency plan is created and mobile stations to be positioned are
randomly distributed over the cell structure (see Figure 3.1). In order to
save infra-structure costs, usually one physical base station is built to
serve three different cells. Directional antennas are used to differentiate
the coverage areas, as shown in figure 3.1. Each base station serves three
surrounding cells. The coverage area of the cells are represented by hexagons.
{width="4.495833333333334in" height="3.1006944444444446in"}
Figure 3.1: A MS in system
## 3.1 Initiation
BS\'s are placed over an area in a uniform hexagonal pattern, and a frequency
plan is defined. The frequency plan assigns each BS a number of traffic
channels and one Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH). MS\'s are placed randomly
on the cell plan. The number of MS\'s is chosen corresponding to the desired
offered traffic. In order to avoid that MS\'s close to the borders of the cell
area have a more advantageous interference situation, a wrap around technique
is used. This means for example that an MS located on the northeast border can
be disturbed by BS\'s on the southwest side.
## 3.2 Path loss calculations
The received signal power is computed according to the Okumura-Hata formula
(see [10]) as:
* * *
{width="2.25in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} (3.1)
* * *
In (3.1),{width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"} is the transmitted
power,{width="0.20833333333333334in" height="0.25in"} is the antenna gain in
the direction to the MS,{width="0.2222222222222222in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} and γ are environmental dependent constants,
_d_ is the distance in km, and{width="0.2361111111111111in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} is the lognormal fading. The lognormal fading
is determined from a \"lognormal fading map\", which defines the excess path
loss at different points on the cell plan. Parameters such as correlation
distance for the lognormal fading and inter-BS lognormal fading correlation
are taken into account. If the inter-BS lognormal fading correlation is zero
the excess path losses to different BS\'s are independent.
The excess path loss in indoor environments is modeled as a lognormal random
variable with mean _m_ and standard deviation σ. In practice this is
implemented by adding _m_ to the path loss and increasing the standard
deviation of the lognormal fading, so that the lognormal fading consists of
the sum of the outdoor and indoor fading.
For the uplink, the MS peak output power used is 0.8W (29dBm) and receiver
noise in the BS -118 dBm. It is possible to simulate the effect of MS power
control. If this option is used less output powers can be used e.g. close to
the serving cell.
On the downlink, the BS transmits continuously with full power on the BCCH
channel and is not subject to any power control. Simulations are run for
balanced links, i.e. the relation between transmission power and receiver
noise is the same as for uplink. Note that _absolute_ values of transmit power
and noise do not affect the result and do not need to be specified.
## 3.3 Channel allocation
The system simulator is static, i.e. snapshots of the system are taken. To
model the dynamic behavior, handover margins are used. A mobile randomly tries
to connect to a BS with a signal strength that is within the handover margin
from the strongest BS. The number of available channels in the system is fixed
and finite. Thus, only a part of the MSs is able to connect. The fraction of
connected MS\'s to the total number of channels is calculated and is called
channel utilization. The total number of placed MS\'s is chosen to give
desired channel utilization.
## 3.4 C and I calculations
Based on the channel allocations, the total received signal powers and
interference powers for all possible radio links are computed. Thereby,
cochannel and adjacent channel interference, and receiver noise is taken into
account. For communication, only C/I (note) on the allocated channel for a
particular MS is interesting. For positioning, C and I for all BS-MS radio
links are interesting since measurements must be performed to more than one
BS. The C and I values are passed to the radio link simulator. Note that the
calculated C and I are average values. Fast fading and multi-path propagation
is modeled in the radio link simulator.
NOTE: To simplify notation we let I denote the combined effect of cochannel
interference (I), adjacent channel interference (A) and receiver noise (N).
On TCH channels Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) may be used. With this
feature the MS does not transmit during speech pauses. The model assumed is
that MS is active 60 % of the time. The effect of DTX is that the interference
levels are lowered. DTX does not apply to BCCH channels.
## 3.5 Dropping calls with too low C/I
The C/I on the traffic channel is checked. If TCH C/I is below 9 dB on
downlink or uplink traffic channel, the MS is considered not to be able to
maintain the call, and the MS is omitted from the calculation. From a
positioning perspective this is acceptable since MS will anyway not be able to
communicate its position.
## 3.6 System simulator parameters
All parameters common to the system simulator are listed in table 3.1.
Environment dependent parameters are listed in table 3.2.

# 4 Radio Link Level Simulator
The radio link simulator needs to be developed according to the proposed
positioning measurement method. As stated, an essential part is the channel
model. Multi-path propagation and fading which is inherent in mobile
communications has a great influence on the positioning performance.
It is therefore crucial that the same channel model is used when evaluating
different positioning measurement systems. The proposed channel model is
presented in its wide-band version in clause 5 and with a GSM adaptation in
clause 6.
Assuming a certain channel model environment, a measurement value and quality
can be determined for each link realization based on distance, angle, speed,
C/I, C/A and C/N. These results are of course interesting, e.g. to find the
rmse under certain assumptions, but the bottom line results are achieved when
combined with the system simulator in clause 3.

Figure 4.1: Radio Link Simulator
# 5 Channel Model
In order to compare different proposals for positioning measurement systems, a
common channel model is required. In this clause, such a channel model is
proposed based on requirements specific to evaluation of positioning
techniques.
## 5.1 Channel model requirements
Important factors when modelling the radio channel for positioning evaluation
are the following:
\- The channel model should be based on physical, measurable parameters. Such
parameters are; power delay profile shape, delay spread, angle of arrival
distributions and fading statistics.
\- Mean excess delays are important, due to the fact that positioning
techniques often use time estimations to position the mobile, and the accuracy
of such techniques depends on the mean excess delay of the impulse response.
Therefore the mean excess delays generated by the model should conform to
measurements.
\- The model should be based on a wide-band channel that can be adapted to the
GSM bandwidth.
\- The model should represent the general channel behaviour in a range of
typical environments, corresponding to geographically diverse conditions.
It should be possible to study the influence of antenna diversity.
## 5.2 Channel model
The channel model uses the same basic structure as the CODIT model [1], [2],
but with some fundamental differences. These differences are due to the
following:
\- The modelling of the delay spread as a distance dependent parameter.
\- Field measurements presented by Motorola, and by Ericsson, and results
found in the literature [3]-[5].
\- Modelling of base station antenna diversity.
Generation of the modelled radio channel for a specific MS-BS configuration is
a 6-step process:
\- Generate the delay spread.
\- Generate an average power delay profile (_apdp_).
\- Adjust the power delay profile so that it produces the desired delay
spread.
\- Generate short-term fading of the impulse response by the physical process
of summation of partial waves.
\- Generate multiple, partially correlated channels for multiple BS antennas
(space diversity).
\- Filtering to GSM bandwidth.
## 5.3 Delay spread
Due to the impact of multi-path propagation on positioning accuracy, modelling
of the delay spread is of importance. The model used is from Greenstein [3],
and is based on two conjectures:
\- At any given distance from the base station, the delay spread is
lognormally distributed.
The median delay spread increases with distance.
Both these conjectures are supported by measurements to a certain degree. The
proposed model is the following:
* * *
{width="0.7777777777777778in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} (5.1)
* * *
Here τ _~rms~_ is the rms delay spread,{width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} is the median value of the delay spread at _d_
= 1 km, ε is a distance-dependence exponent, and _y_ is a lognormal variate,
meaning that $Y = \text{10}\text{log}y$ is a Gaussian random variable with
standard deviation σ _~Y~_.
Parameter values have been chosen based on the recommendations in [3] and the
following reported measurements:
\- Motorola reports on field measurements where the distance dependence is
weaker than what is suggested by [3], suggesting a lower value for ε.
\- Ericsson reports on field measurement results showing that for the urban
environment the original recommendations for ε in [3] gives the best fit.
To accomodate both types of distance dependence of the delay spread into the
model, two Urban environments are included: UrbanA which fits the Ericsson
observations and UrbanB which fits the Motorola observations. In other
environments the weaker distance dependence is used.
The parameter values of the model are given in table 5.1.
Table 5.1: Parameter values for the delay spread model
* * *
Environment ε σ~Y~ Bad Urban 1.0 μs 0.3 4 dB UrbanA 0.4 μs 0.5 4 dB UrbanB 0.4
μs 0.3 4 dB Suburban 0.3 μs 0.3 4 dB Rural 0.1 μs 0.3 4 dB
* * *
The model also assumes that there is no correlation between delay spread
values measured to different base stations from the same mobile.
## 5.4 Average power delay profile
The average power delay profile (local average of the squared magnitude of the
impulse response) is modelled as the sum of a number of discrete impulses.
* * *
{width="1.5416666666666667in" height="0.375in"} (5.2)
* * *
Each impulse corresponds to an infinite bandwidth representation of an
impinging wave which has been scattered (reflected, diffracted) in the
propagation environment.
The original procedures for generating{width="0.19375in"
height="0.25in"}and{width="0.16666666666666666in" height="0.25in"}in the CODIT
model [2] has been expanded and changed as more information on the shape of
the _apdp_ has been presented, such as:
\- The field measurement results presented by Motorola, which shows that the
ratio between delay spread and mean excess delay is of the order 2:1 for rural
and suburban,, and of the order 1:1 to 2:1 for urban environments.
\- Measurement results by Ericsson showing a 1:1 ratio for urban environments.
Table 5.2 shows the parameters used for generating the _apdp_ :s in the
different environments. Again, the UrbanA parameters correspond to the results
presented by Ericsson and the UrbanB parameters correspond to Motorola\'s
results.

calculating relative powers: 1.5:1 1  
Suburban 1 0 4.3 2:1 15 2-6 0-τ~max~ 0.1-0.4 1-5 Rural As suburban
* * *
## 5.5 Matching the delay spread of the channel model to the delay spread
model
A simple rescaling of the time delay axis is used to compress or expand the
average power delay profiles to give the desired delay spread. To elaborate,
if a given realization of an average power delay profile has delay spread
_d~1~_ , but the delay spread model realization value is _d~2~_ , the time
delays of the _apdp_ scatterers are simply multiplied by _d~2~_ /_d~1~_. The
_apdp_ will then have delay spread _d~2~_.
## 5.6 Short-term fading
The modelling assumption is that each of the scatterers in the impulse
response fades individually. The fading is modelled by the physical process of
summation of a large number of waves, where the power distribution of the
waves is chosen in order to generate Nakagami-m fading statistics [6]. The
m-parameter values in the model are given in table 5.2. (m = 1 for Rayleigh,
m>>1 for Rice). The complex phase of each wave is random.
The arrival angles of the waves at the mobile are generated from a truncated
Gaussian distribution (standard dev. = 0.15 rad) around a mean AoA. The mean
AoA for each scatterer is generated from a uniform (0-2π) distribution. 100
waves are used for each scatterer.
The knowledge of all arrival angles, amplitudes and phases of the waves allows
us to calculate the complex sum at any position of the mobile. In this way we
are able to physically generate the fading of the scatterers as the mobile
moves.
## 5.7 Diversity
When using more than one base station antenna for reception/transmission, we
need to model the channel for each antenna, with a certain amount of
decorrelation between the antenna signals. This is modelled in the same
physical manner as the short-term fading, we only need to obtain knowledge
about the angles of arrival (departure) at the base station. The following
assumptions are made:
\- Scattering is primarily occurring close to the mobile [7], so that each
scatterer can be viewed as a point source from the base station. (All partial
waves for that scatterer have the same angle of arrival at the BS)
The angle of arrival of each scatterer is modelled from a Gaussian with
standard deviation:
* * *
{width="0.9305555555555556in" height="0.4305555555555556in"} (5.3)
* * *
This approach is is similar to that in [8], but with the inclusion of the time
delays of the scatterers. The expression above can be shown [6] to lead to
approximately a Laplacian power azimuth spectrum, which has been observed in
measurements [9].
## 5.8 Limitations
The following limitations of the model should be kept in mind, so as not to
apply the model outside its area of validity.
Wide-Sense Stationarity is assumed, so dynamic changes in the propagation
envi­ronment is not modelled. All movement of the mobile is assumed to be on a
local scale, with no movements around street corners or into houses etc.
The model, especially the delay spread model, is intended to give the average
behaviour rather than be able to reproduce the specifics of any given real-
world location.
## 5.9 Summary of the channel model
The model is summarized below:
\- Delay spreads are generated according to {width="0.8333333333333334in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} (see equation 5.1). The chosen parameter values
are given in table 5.3.

Short-term fading is generated with:
\- 100 partial waves for each scatterer.
Partial wave phases: {0-2π}
Base station angles of arrival are generated from a Gaussian distribution with
standard deviation: {width="1.0965277777777778in" height="0.25in"}. The base
station angles of arrival, in conjunction with the positions of the base
station antennas, are sufficient for calculating the channel at different base
antennas.
# 6 GSM Adaptation
This clause describes a FIR Filter Implementation of the Channel Model for GSM
Simulations.
## 6.1 FIR Filter Implementation
The implementation of the CODIT based channel model in GSM simulations is by
means of a FIR filter. The channel model delivers the complex amplitude
_a~i~(t)_ and delay _τ~i~(t)_ of each path _i_ from which the time-variant
infinite bandwidth channel impulse response _h(t,τ)_ is formed and which is
the basis of the FIR filter implementation:
{width="1.5555555555555556in" height="0.5138888888888888in"} (6.1)
The discrete time implementation of the channel model consists of a tapped-
delay-line with a tap spacing defined by the system sampling period _T_ and
tap weight coefficients _g~n~(t)_ , where _n=0,...,L_ is the tap index. The
number of required taps _L_ , _i.e.,_ the length of the FIR filter, is
determined by the product of the maximum excess delay of the environment and
the system sampling rate.
The tap weights _g~n~(t)_ can be calculated by taking the signal bandwidth
into account. The bandwidth occupied by the real band-pass signal is denoted
by _W_. Then the band occupancy of the equivalent low-pass signal is _\| f \|_
≤½ _W_ , which allows to define the system sampling rate _1/T=W_. By this, the
channel can be considered band-limited with null spectral components out of
the system bandwidth, sampling it with the same rate. Thus, the multiplicative
tap weights _g~n~(t)_ are obtained by filtering _h(t,τ)_ with an ideal low-
pass filter with cut-off frequency ½ _T=W_ /2 and sampled at rate 1/_T_ =_W_
[2]:
{width="2.1666666666666665in" height="0.8194444444444444in"} (6.2)
Substituting _h(t,τ)_ (equation (6.1)) into the equation above yields the tap
weights of the FIR filter implementation of the channel model:
{width="2.1805555555555554in" height="0.8194444444444444in"} (6.3)
Thus, each complex amplitude _a~i~(t)_ delivered by the CODIT model is
multiplied by a sinc function shifted by the amount of the corresponding time
delay _τ~i~(t)_ and summed up for all scatterers _N_.
The sampling frequency used for the \"Positioning Simulator\" has been chosen
to 16 times the bit rate in GSM, _i.e.,_ 1/_T_ = _W_ = 16 · (13e6/48) Hz ≈ 16
· 270833 Hz ≈ 4333333 Hz. This relative high sampling frequency has been
chosen to allow in the simulations over-sampling at the receiver which may
improve the performance of time delay estimation algorithms in a TOA or TDOA
based positioning system. In order to implement the above equation (6.3) the
sinc function has to be truncated. In the proposed \"Positioning Simulator\",
the impulse responses are truncated to 30 microseconds.
The channel output signal is obtained by convolution of this sampled impulse
response with the simulated GMSK signal (sampled at the same rate). Since the
channel is power normalized, the signal mean power is kept after this
convolution. This allows to simulate interference signals and thermal noise
which can be added to the channel output signal.
## 6.2 Sampling in Time Domain
With time-variance being relatively slow for all bands (900 MHz, 1 800 MHz and
1 900 MHz), the channel can be assumed quasi time-invariant, i.e. time-
invariant over the duration of one burst. Therefore, no change of the delay
profile during a burst has to be modeled and hence, only one sample of the
delay profile is required for each burst. Since the channel model is only a
function of position, moving vehicles can be easily simulated. For each burst
a new channel impulse response is computed based on a given desired position.
This allows also to simulate accelerating moving mobiles.
## 6.3 Frequency Hopping
The radio interface of GSM uses slow frequency hopping. Because the channel
impulse response delivered by the proposed modified CODIT model has infinite
bandwidth, frequency hopping can be easily implemented by filtering out the
frequency bands of interest. The complex impulse response of equation (6.1)
for one burst is multiplied by exp(_j_ 2 _πf~H~τ~i~(t)_), which results in a
frequency translation with magnitude _f~H~_ , _i.e.,_ with spectrum
_H(f-f~H~)_. Defining for each burst a different frequency _f~H~_ the channel
to use for each burst is centered around frequency 0 in base-band. This
translated impulse responses are then filtered and sampled as described in
subclause 6.1.
# 7 Position Calculation and Statistical Evaluation
The position calculation function utilizes the available measurements, e.g
time of arrival (TOA) measurements from three or more BS-MS links, to produce
a position estimate. It is desirable that a position estimate is delivered
even in cases where it is not possible to produce the number of measurements
required by the particular method. In the latter case e.g. a position estimate
related to the position of the serving cell can be used.
The statistical evaluation is based on computing the difference between the
estimated position $\left( \hat{x},\hat{y} \right)$ and the true position
(_x,y_). One possible error measure is to define the circular error:
* * *
{width="2.0in" height="0.3194444444444444in"} (8.1)
* * *
Here subscript _i_ denotes quantities related to the _i_ th MS. Statistics on
the circular error could be presented by:
\- Plotting the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of _ce_.
\- Displaying certain CDF percentile values, like e.g. 67% and 90% levels.
\- Determine the amount of position estimates satisfying _ce_ \ 6 000 kHz offset.
Where the uncoordinated MS is operating on an ARFCN, which is exposed to
intermodulation products, it has been found that the MS receiver performance
limits the link, since the BTS tx intermodulation products and the MS receiver
intermodulation products will land on exactly the same frequencies. In that
scenario, the required coupling losses were found to be 96 dB and 102 dB
respectively for 900 MHz and 1 800 MHz operation respectively.
# X.3 Analysis of Specifications
Given the analysis in subclause X.2 to establish propagation conditions which
will allow coordinated and uncoordinated MSs to successfully operate on the up
and down links this section will examine the specifications of GSM 05.05 for
EDGE operation.
## X.3.1 Scenario 1: Single BTS and MS
### X.3.1.1 Specifications Affected (GSM 05.05)
Subclause 6.1 Nominal error rates (maximum receiver levels).
Subclause 6.2 Nominal error rates (maximum receiver levels).
### X.3.1.2 Maximum Receiver Levels
This case has been analyzed in subclause X.2.1.1.1.
### X.3.1.3 Reference Sensitivity Level
#### X.3.1.3.1 Coverage Limit
The absolute sensitivity of the BTS and MS will determine the coverage
characteristics of the BTS and MS. The actual result is a complex function of
building geometry, antenna height, building penetration loss, and a number of
other factors.
#### X.3.1.3.2 Link Balance
Link balance for symmetric operation is determined from relatively few factors
assuming that the uplink and downlink channels are reciprocal. Assuming
equivalent Eb/No for the MS and BTS, and given a MS with a transmit power of
33 dBm at 900 MHz, and 30 dBm at 1800 MHz, and a receiver noise floor of -110
dBm in both bands, and a BTS with a noise floor of -112 dBm and a diversity
benefit of 5 dB in the uplink balance occurs at the following BTS power:
BTS Transmit Power (Balanced) = MS tx power - BTS noise floor + BTS Diversity
+ MS noise floor.
For 900 MHz
BTS Transmit Power (Balanced) = 33 dBm - (-112 dBm) + 5 dB + (-110 dBm) = 40
dBm.
For 1800 MHz
BTS Transmit Power (Balanced) = 30 dBm - (-112 dBm) + 5 dB + (-110 dBm) = 37
dBm.
## X.3.2 Scenario 2: Multiple MS and BTS, Coordinated
Coordinated operation is assumed ie BTS\'s belong to same PLMN. Collocated
MS\'s and collocated BTS\'s are dealt with in Scenarios 4 and 5, respectively.

In closest approach to a BTS, a single MS will transmit energy into adjacent
channels and beyond. For channels, which are offset from the MS ARFCN by 200
kHz, 400 kHz, and 600 kHz:
[TBD]
For larger offsets the amount of desensitization of the BTS can be calculated.
For GSM900, given a BTS noise floor -112 dBm, with downlink power control
enabled the closest approach mobile will induce.

### X.3.2.4 Inter/Intra Modulation Attenuation, BTS (GSM 05.05, subclauses
4.7.1 and 4.7.2)
With 30 dB of coupling assumed between the antenna faces of a sectorized
cellsite the intermodulation distortions should be same or less than the
allowable intra BTS intermodulation levels.
For coordinated system with even channel spacing inter/intra modulation
products can land on channel as in band interference.
Given an MCS 9 channel that requires, for example, 25 dB of C/I, and the BTS
supports 30 dB of dynamic power control then the system would have to provide
at least 55 dB of suppression to mitigate the impact of Inter/Intra Modulation
products.
The uncoordinated problem is examined in more detail in clause X.5.
The impacts of transmit and receive intermodulations are also examined in
subclauses X.2.1.1.2, X.2.2.1.2, X.2.2.1.3, and clause X.5.
### X.3.2.5 Blocking (GSM 05.05, subclause 5.1)
Blocking occurs when a receiver is unable to distinguish between a low power
desired signal in the presence of a high powered interferer which is not on
channel (distinct from C/I).
In a coordinated scenario these conditions are manifest where a desired MS is
operating far from the serving BTS and there are other coordinated mobile in
close proximity to the BTS. This case was analyzed for the uplink in subclause
X.3.2.3 and from those results it can be seen that the desensitization
associated with the MS wide band noise is in fact a dominant mechanism for
operational blocking.
For the downlink the coordinated case is not applicable since a single BTS has
all of its transceivers in one place.
In the case of multiple BTSs this is an issue of network C/I performance and
is a function of the deployed channel reuse rate. This is covered more
extensively in clause X.4.

Subclause 4.2 Output RF spectrum.
Subclause 4.7 Intermodulation (see figure X.5).
Subclause 5.1 Blocking, in-band, up and down links (see figure X.4).
Subclause 5.3 Intermodulation, in-band (see figure X.6).
### X.3.3.2 Output RF Spectrum (GSM 05.05, subclause 4.2)
This case was examined in X.2.2.1.1 for the downlink.
_Uplink:_
In closest approach to a BTS, a single MS will transmit energy into adjacent
channels and beyond. For larger offsets, which is the case that applies to
uncoordinated scenarios, the amount of desensitization of the BTS can be
calculated.
For GSM900, given a BTS noise floor -112 dBm, noise masking only, a closest
approach uncoordinated mobile will induce.
Table X.8: Desensitization of BTS due to the presence of close in
uncoordinated GSM900 MS

Offset 1 800 kHz 3 000 kHz 6 000 kHz Mobile Power (dBm) 33 33 33 Mask at

(dB) 5.4 4.1 3.5 MS Power at BTS (dBm) -40 -40 -35
* * *
For DCS1800, given a BTS noise floor -112 dBm, noise masking only, a closest
approach uncoordinated mobile will induce.
Table X.9: Desensitization of BTS due to the presence of close in
uncoordinated DCS1800 MS.

Power at BTS (dBm) -113 -116 Desensitization (dB) 2.5 1.5 MS Power at BTS
(dBm) -43 -38
* * *
From the above, it can be seen, that even with relatively large coupling
losses the wideband noise of the mobile is a dominant desensitization
mechanism.
In situations where an uncoordinated mobile is experiencing receive
intermodulation events the coupling loss required for it to work are much
larger and would not be able to get close enough to the BTS to measurably
desensitize it.
### X.3.3.3 Transmit Intermodulation (GSM 05.05, subclause 4.7)
This case was examined in subclause X.2.2.1.3.
### X.3.3.4 Blocking, In-Band Up and Down Links (GSM 05.05, subclause 5.1)
The downlink scenario is examined in subclause X.2.2.1.1.
_Uplink:_
From subclause X.2.2.2, the minimum coupling losses when intermodulation
products are not involved are 83 dB for MS operating 1 800 kHz to 6 000 kHz
away from the desired channel, and 78 dB for MS > 6 000 kHz offset in
frequency. From the BTS these coupling losses set the noise at the MS antenna
equal to the noise in the MS which yields a 3 dB desensitization in the MS. In
the reverse direction these coupling losses yield:
MS Power + Antenna (BTS + MS) - Coupling loss
33 dBm + 10 dB - 83 dB = -40 dBm at the BTS (GSM900, 1 800 kHz to 6 000 kHz
offset)
30 dBm + 10 dB - 83 dB = -43 dBm at the BTS (DCS1800, 1 800 kHz to 6 000 kHz
offset)
33 dBm + 10 dB - 78 dB = -35 dBm at the BTS (GSM900, > 6 000 kHz offset)
30 dBm + 10 dB - 78 dB = -38 dBm at the BTS (DCS1800, > 6 000 kHz offset)
For these values the associated amount of BTS desensitization is.
Table X.10: Achievable Operational Blocking Levels

4.1 3.5 2.5 1.5
* * *
These values represent the signals that would be observed in practice at a BTS
that is operating in a near far relationship with different PLMN. Since the
exiting test levels in GSM 05.05 subclause 5.1 are significantly higher than
the above the BTS response to the MS tone levels received operationally there
is significant margin in that specification.
When the frequency planning of the serving network is such that the MS
generates intermodulation products which land on its operating channel the MS
will need significantly more coupling loss in order to operate.
### X.3.3.5 BTS Receiver Intermodulation (GSM 05.05, subclause 5.3)
From GSM 05.50, the input levels, which will generate intermodulation products
at the same level as the BTS noise floor are:
\- -43 dBm for GSM900.
\- -49 dBm for DCS1800.
Table X.11: Minimum Coupling Losses Based on MS receiver Intermodulation
Requirements

                              GSM900   DCS1800

(dBm) -43.0 -49.0 Coupling loss Req\'d (dB) 86.0 89.0
* * *
If the coupling loss exceeds this the intermodulation products will not be
high enough to cause a problem. As noted in subclause X.2.2.2 in situations
where intermodulation generation is possible on the up and down links the
coupling losses required to allow a mobile to operate are much larger than and
as such this should not be a normal operational impairment.
# X.4 C/I Limited Coordinated MS and BTS
This is the situation where a mobile is operating in a system with many BTSs
arranged in regular reuse patterns. In this case it is necessary to understand
the baseline C/I condition that will apply in the coverage area. The following
assumes that the system would be otherwise functional from an absolute signal
level standpoint.
## X.4.1 N=4/12 Reuse Pattern, Geometric C/I
The following figure shows the mean C/I levels expected in a N=4/12 reuse
pattern. This was generated assuming a propagation factor of 38 dB/decade.

assumption of a 6 dB standard deviation for the shadowing component.

deviation of 6 dB
## X.4.3 Adjacent Channel Interference
Adjacent channel interference can be represented as a co channel interference
which the system is more tolerant of.
[TBD]
# X.5 BTS Inter and Intra Modulation
BTS inter and intra modulations are additional sources of interfering energy
between systems. For coordinated MS if the inter/intra modulation energy is
too high it would have the potential to limit the available downlink power
control range. For uncoordinated MS there is potential for inter/intra
modulation components falling on channel and causing undesirable interference.
The worst case for the uncoordinated systems is that the serving and
interfering cell are at opposite ends of the same coverage area with the
uncoordinated MS close to the interferer and far from the serving BTS.
In operation, the use of DTX and forward link power control will significantly
reduce the actual inter/intra modulation energy radiated from the interfering
BTS. Figure X.7 illustrated the inherent C/I baseline for the network deployed
on an N=4/12 reuse plan. That figure does not show the impact of shadowing,
however, it can be seen that the average C/I at the cell EDGE at the extreme
opposite end of the coverage is \~ 20 dB. It is thus desirable then that the
inter /intra modulation performance would not adversely impact that
performance.
## X.5.1 Simplified Analysis
The following analysis examines the impact on performance of -60 dBc
intra/inter intermodulation. (while the calculations make use of absolute
values for distance, the results are dependent upon relative geometry).
{width="4.801388888888889in" height="0.775in"}
Figure X.9: Representation of relative geometry for BTS intra/inter modulation
performance
The parameters are:
_IMD_ = -60 dBc (intra BTS intermodulation attentuation level).
γ = 38 (decade loss figure).

C/I).
{width="1.375in" height="0.34652777777777777in"}(distance ratio which will
meet desired C/I given IMD).

site radius).
{width="0.5833333333333334in" height="0.4166666666666667in"} (base to
coordinated mobile R~2~ / interfering base to mobile R~1~).
{width="1.69375in" height="0.375in"}m (R where C/I due to interfering base
meets required minimum C/I).
Because the distance to the interfering base station is small, the reduction
in antenna gain has to be accounted for. An additional factor of 10 dB needs
to be accounted for.
Therefore, the region below 10 dB is restricted to:
{width="1.0965277777777778in" height="0.19375in"} dB (assumed antenna gain
correction).
{width="2.0in" height="0.34652777777777777in"}
{width="1.69375in" height="0.375in"} m
So in this case, it has been shown that only the last 2.6% of the range is
potentially exposed.
{width="0.6805555555555556in" height="0.4166666666666667in"}
This is 0.23% of the area.
{width="0.9583333333333334in" height="0.4861111111111111in"}
Where power control is used and when less than the maximum number of channels
is operating, the actual IMD levels will be significantly reduced.

to Micro BTS
In this case the microcell is assumed to have an EIRP which is 20 dB less than
the normal BTS. Since the normal BTS is transmitting with an EIRP which is 20
dB higher than the micro BTS the apparent inter/ intra modulation energy is 20
dB higher relative to the micro transmit power.
The serving cell is an omni microcell which is part of an N=7 reuse plan. The
microcell network is assumed to have its antennas deployed at 20 m.

provide very little vertical pattern rolloff close in to the BTSs. Propagation

###### ### Annex Y: T-GSM 900 system scenarios
# Y.0 Introduction
This paper discusses system scenarios for T-GSM 900 operation primarily in
respect of the 05.05 series of recommendations. To develop the T-GSM 900
standard, all the relevant scenarios need to be considered for each part of
05.05 and the most critical cases identified. The process may then be iterated
to arrive at final parameters that meet both service and implementation
requirements.
# Y.1 Frequency bands and channel arrangement
T-GSM 900 systems are specified for the following frequency band. It is
recognised that a guard band is required at the crossover from up link to down
link at 915 MHz. See also CEPT ECC Report No. 5 on Adjacent Band Compatibility
between TAPS (T-GSM 900) and GSM at 915 MHz:
T-GSM 900 Band
> 870.4 -- 876 MHz: mobile transmit, base receive;
>
> 915.4 -- 921 MHz: base transmit, mobile receive;
with a carrier spacing of 200 kHz.
# Y.2 System Scenario Calculations for T-GSM 900 systems
## Y.2.1 Worst case proximity scenarios
The purpose of the present document is to justify the adoption of E-GSM 900
radio frequency requirements to the T-GSM 900 system with minimal changes.
This will make it easy to adapt standard GSM technology. Parameters like body
loss and multiple interference margin are chosen to be identical that was used
in GSM 900 or DCS 1800 system scenario calculations performed earlier in SMG.
This was decided for to keep comparison with different system scenario
calculations easy. It has to be noted that with chosen approach the T-GSM 900
scenario calculations are somewhat pessimistic compared to the scenarios for
GSM 900. This is because the user densities expected in the T-GSM 900 are much
lower than those of GSM 900.
As was seen with GSM 900 and DCS 1800 cases all worst case scenarios are not
met. Compromises have been made where the parameters have statistical
probabilities of occurrences and implementation issues. Evidently it would
also be more severe to block a BTS than a single MS. Statistical properties of
occurrence determine that the co-ordinated case is more important to meet than
the uncoordinated case. Because of limited spectrum available in the T-GSM 900
band and the adjacent location to the GSM P band at 915 MHz it is relevant to
assume that systems are operated in a co-ordinated manner in all cases.
Tables below show examples of close proximity scenarios in urban and rural
environments for GSM 900 and T-GSM 900 systems.

Path loss is assumed to be free space i.e. 31.5 + 20 log d(m) dB for GSM 900
and T-GSM 900 systems, where d is the length of the sloping line connecting
the transmit and receive antennas. The coupling loss is defined between
antenna connectors. The transmitter power and receiver sensitivity is measured
at the respective antenna connectors.
Coupling between BTSs may result either from the co-siting of BTSs or from
several BTSs in close proximity with directional antenna. The minimum coupling
loss between BTSs is assumed to be 30 dB. This is defined as the loss between
the transmitter combiner output and the receiver multi-coupler input.
T-GSM 900 system scenario calculations use a value for dense urban area MCL of
59 dB.
MS to MS close proximity MCL is 34.5 dB for GSM 900 and T-GSM 900. Recent
measures indicate that body loss for small hand-sets is closer to 10 dB rather
than the used 1 dB (05.50 v 6.0.2 Appendix H). The requirements for the worst
case scenario would be relaxed by this difference and easier to meet.
Worst case scenarios usually involve a \"near/far\" problem of some kind, the
component scenario assumptions as given in the scenarios paper for \"near\"
and \"far\" can be summarised as follows.
* * *
\"Near\" MCL [dB] BTS -> MS 59 MS -> BTS 59 MS -> MS 34.5 BTS -> BTS 30
* * *
* * *
\"Far\" TX power [dBm] RX Sensitivity [dBm] BTS 39 -104 MS 33 -102
* * *
Other parameters used in scenario calculations are:
* * *
**Parameter** **Value [dB]** BTS power control range 30 MS power control range
26 C/I margin 9 Multiple interferers margin (MIM) 10 Transient margin 20
Margin for other IM\'s 3
* * *
It is suggested that MIM for T-GSM 900 should be much lower than 10 dB because
of the lower amount of carriers possible, but as was stated in the beginning
GSM 900 system scenario calculation parameters are chosen for comparison
reasons.

# Y.4 Transmitter characteristics
For readability the chapter numbering in the transmitter and receiver
characteristics chapters are aligned with current GSM 05.05 chapter numbering.
The worst case scenario requirements and current GSM 05.05 specification for
GSM 900 are summarized in the tables beginning of each relevant chapter.
Specification requirements in the table entries are converted to 200 kHz
bandwidth to be comparable for scenario calculation results.
## Y.4.1 Output power
### Y.4.1.1 Mobile Station
T-GSM 900 uses the same power classes as GSM 900.
The absolute tolerance on power control levels has been chosen to be the same
as with GSM 900.
### Y.4.1.2 Base Station
T-GSM 900 uses the same power classes as GSM 900.
The tolerance on the BTS static power control step size is the same as for GSM
900.
## Y.4.2 Output RF Spectrum
### Y.4.2.1 Spectrum due to the modulation and wideband noise
[Coordinated case]{.underline}
In the coordinated case the BTS wideband noise requirement are fulfilled with
both GSM 900 and T-GSM 900 systems and thus there is no need to change the
specification for BTS TX mask.
Worst case scenario requirements for MS wideband noise are tighter than for
BTS. Since the table entries in GSM 05.05 are relative, as the level of the
transmitter is reduced, the absolute specification becomes tighter. For
coordinated MS to BTS interference it is to be noted that power control works
and MS will be powered down. For MS close to BTS it is relevant to expect that
minimum MS TX power is used. Thus introduced wideband noise is reduced
accordingly down to --43 dBm at 600 kHz offset. Still there is a gap of 9 dB
in GSM 900 scenarios and specification.
Probability of this scenario is low and actually allowing this to happen is
not practical cellular planning. Low power users operating very close to BTS
may block users locating in the edge area of very large cells that operate
with full power and still close to sensitivity level. In other words blocking
of some users at cell edge would require large cells in dense urban areas with
very small handover margin. In sensible cellular planning these should be
contradictory occurrences. Thus it was felt that there is no need to make
specification too tight because of speculation of some unpractical
occurrences.
[Uncoordinated case]{.underline}
The theoretical worst case uncoordinated scenarios are failing by a large
margin. This has always been the case for all bands. In reality this situation
is very rare. An uncoordinated scenario is unlikely in the spectrum available
for T-GSM 900. Secondly the theoretical calculations assumes the MS to be
operating at its sensitivity limit while being close to a disturbing BTS. This
is not a likely scenario. Experience has proved that there is no reason to
require a change in the existing GSM900 transmitter mask.
Special Case
The normal requirement to wideband noise is inadequate in the case of a GSM
BTS receiver operating just below 915 MHz and a T-GSM 900 BTS operating above
915 MHz. In this case coordination is required. The TAPS BTS will need to be
fitted with an additional filter to suppress the wideband noise according to
the physical distance and separation in frequency. See ECC Report no. 5.
### Y.4.2.2 Spectrum due to switching transients
[Coordinated case]{.underline}
GSM 05.05 defines modulation mask, switching transients, spurious emissions
and intermodulation specifications to be consistent with each other (GSM 05.50
V6.0.2 Annex D). The requirements for GSM900 are considered adequate also for
T-GSM 900.
[Uncoordinated case]{.underline}
The requirements for GSM900 are considered adequate also for T-GSM 900.
No changes in respect to GSM 900 requirements are proposed.
## Y.4.3 Spurious emissions
### Y.4.3.1 Principle of the specification
No changes to measurement conditions are needed.
### Y.4.3.2 Base transceiver station
The current specification for BTS requires --98 dBm level of spurious
emissions suppression in a 200 kHz BTS RX band. Current understanding is that
the GSM 900 specification can be adopted for T-GSM 900 systems.
When T-GSM 900 BTS is co-sited with GSM systems in other bands, measures must
be taken for mutual protection of receivers. T-GSM 900 systems must not
produce excessive level of noise in the relevant up-link bands for GSM 900 and
DCS 1800. GSM 900 and DCS 1800 are currently specified to allow a maximum of
--36 dBm spurious emissions in the T-GSM 900 MHz band. This does not quite
match with the requirements for T-GSM 900 systems. However no changes to the
specifications are proposed as it is considered highly unlikely that these
levels will exist so close to own receive band for GSM 900 and even more
unlikely for DCS 1800. If BTSs of different frequency bands are co-sited the
coupling loss must be increased by antenna arrangement or with external
filters, but this must not be a part of GSM specification.
### Y.4.3.3 Mobile station
In idle mode power measured in GSM 900 down link band is limited to --57 dBm
at 100 kHz measurement band. In up link band allowed level is --59 dBm. For
uplink the wideband noise scenario requirement is --60 dBm at 200 kHz band.
Due to different measurement methods (i.e. average vs. peak value) in wideband
noise and spurious emission conditions it is reasonable to assume that GSM 900
requirements can be adopted as is for T-GSM 900 systems.
When allocated a channel the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 systems are currently
specified to allow at maximum --36 dBm spurious emission in the 9 kHz -- 1 GHz
frequency range with measurement conditions as specified in GSM 05.05.
However, no changes are proposed for the GSM 900 or DCS 1800 systems.
## Y.4.4 Radio frequency tolerance
Maintain requirements in GSM 05.05 (defined in GSM 05.10).
## Y.4.5 Output level dynamic operation
### Y.4.5.1 Base station
This specification only affects the interference experienced by co-channel
cells in the same PLMN. The requirement on the relative power level of
unactivated timeslots is -30 dBc that is in line with the BTS power control
range.
Maintain current specification.
### Y.4.5.2 Mobile station
Maintain current specification.
## Y.4.6 Phase accuracy
Maintain current specification for GSM 900 in 05.05 (defined in GSM 05.04).
## Y.4.7 Intermodulation attenuation
For GSM 900 system intermodulation attenuation is specified only for BTS.
Required intermodulation attenuation in the coordinated case for both GSM 900
and T-GSM 900 systems is 42 dB while the current specification states that
attenuation is 70 dB.
No changes are proposed for intermodulation attenuation specification.
# Y.5 Receiver characteristics
## Y.5.1 Blocking characteristics
{width="5.761111111111111in" height="0.33402777777777776in"}
{width="5.7625in" height="0.4479166666666667in"}
The scenario where MS is blocked by BTS is considered to have insignificant
influence because of the GSM-R band that separates T-GSM 900 and GSM 900. In
respect of the GSM-R again no significant influence is expected because of the
relative low user densities in this band and the statistical probability of a
GSM-R MS to be close to a T-GSM BST and far away from its own BST while
wanting to communicate.
The scenario where MS is blocking MS is very depending on statistical
probabilities. It is considered highly unlikely that two MS will be in
operation on the same timeslot within a few meters and one is at the
sensitivity limit also considering the relatively low user densities of T-GSM.
The BTS to BTS blocking is a special case for T-GSM because of the frequency
allocation. T-GSM BTS transmitter is operating from 915.6 MHz and the GSM BST
receiver may be at 914.8 MHz in the same geographical area. This situation
requires co-ordination and may require additional filters at the GSM BST
receiver where the physical distance is short between a T-GSM BTS and the GSM
BTS. See also ECC Report No. 5.

The BTS in-band blocking requirement has kept same as for the GSM 900 system.
The out-of-band specification has been changed for MS. It has taken
implementation issues into account but is based on the low probability of
occurrence.
## Y.5.2 AM suppression characteristics
AM suppression requirement is targeted for uncoordinated operation where two
operators share the band. Current requirements are about the same for both GSM
900 and DCS 1800 systems. Because of the closeness of GSM 900, GSM-R and T-GSM
900 it is considered that the current GSM 900 requirement also shall cover
T-GSM 900.
## Y.5.3 Intermodulation Characteristics
T-GSM 900 has the same characteristics as GSM 900 although with much reduced
user densities. Because of the ramifications of a change in the specification
it is not proposed to change the intermodulation requirements for T-GSM 900.
## Y.5.4 Spurious emissions
No changes are proposed for this requirement.
# Y.6 Receiver performance
T-GSM 900 is sufficiently close in frequency to GSM 900 not to make any
changes to the specification for T-GSM 900.
###### ### Annex Z: MBMS system scenarios
The following section contains simulation results for MBMS repetition schemes,
to be used in the definition of receiver performance requirements of MBMS.
In the figures below, the performance of repetition redundancy (i.e.
transmission without ARQ, as defined in 3GPP TS 43.246) for different coding
schemes and with different numbers of repetitions is shown. The performance is
defined in terms of the C/I required to achieve the target SDU Frame Erasure
Rate. The simulations have been carried out using the TU3iFH radio channel
profile defined in 3GPP TS 45.005, with co-channel interference.
A Service Data Unit (SDU) is defined as the basic unit of data transported
over the GERAN. In the case of _A/Gb mode_ , an SDU is an LLC frame. Since the
performance of the repetitions schemes is dependent upon the size of the SDUs,
a fixed size needs to be defined. For these results a fixed LLC frame size of
510 octets has been used. This assumes an IP packet of 500 octets plus 10
octets deriving from the overhead introduced by the SNDCP and LLC protocols.
For transmission without feedback, the LLC operates in unacknowledged mode.
The 10 octets consists of 4 octets for the SNDCP header (for the SN UNITDATA
PDU format, see 3GPP TS 44.065), 1 octet for the LLC address field, 2 octets
for the LLC control field (UI format, see 3GPP TS 44.064) and 3 octets for the
LLC Frame Check Sequence. This overhead is present only for transmission over
GERAN _A/G~b~ mode_.
In the simulations each RLC/MAC block is repeat _k_ times. At the receiver the
repetitions of each block are combined and then the block is decoded. For GPRS
coding schemes, performance results are presented without any combining of the
repetitions of each block. Each block is decoded independently, and if all of
the repetitions of a block are found to be in error, then a block error will
be counted.
For EGPRS coding schemes, Incremental Redundancy has been used to combine the
blocks. In this case, only blocks for which the header has been successfully
decoded have their payloads combined. If after combining the decoded block is
still found to be erroneous, then a block error is counted.
The performance for SDU FER of 10%, 1% and 0.1% are presented for both GPRS
and EGPRS coding schemes. Each point in the graphs defines the throughput per
timeslot corresponding C/I required to meet the SDU FER target for a
repetition scheme.
The parameters used in the simulations are summarised in Table 1.

###### ### Annex ZA: T-GSM 810 system scenarios
# ZA.1 Introduction
The T-GSM 810 frequency band has been introduced in the GERAN specifications
in order to allow the operation of a trunking system based on GSM in the 810
MHz band. The band is as follows:
\- 806 -- 821 MHz: Uplink (MS transmit, BTS receive)
\- 851 -- 866 MHz: Downlink (BTS transmit, MS receive)
In China, regulations allow four trunking systems to be deployed in this band:
\- T-GSM 810: GSM-based Digital Trunking Mobile Communication System in the
810 MHz frequency band [2].
\- T-CDMA: CDMA-based Digital Trunking Mobile Communication System in the 810
MHz frequency band [3].
\- Trunking System A and Trunking System B: Digital Trunking Mobile
Communication System [4].
Trunking System A and Trunking System B specified by the Chinese government in
[4] correspond to the trunking systems TETRA and iDEN^TM^, respectively. In
the following description, the four trunking systems are denoted T-GSM810,
T-CDMA, TETRA and iDEN^TM^.
NOTE: iDEN^TM^ is a trademark of Motorola Inc.
In this Annex, the results of a partial coexistence analysis between these
systems are presented. The study is based on a worst-case scenario.
Coexistence of other system carriers and T-GSM 810 system carriers of the same
duplex direction are assumed. As a consequence, the interference scenarios
considered for the downlink study are:
\- Other system BTS  T-GSM 810 MS
\- T-GSM 810 BTS  Other system MS
For these scenarios, the objective is to evaluate the impact of other system
BTS interference on T-GSM 810 MS and T-GSM 810 BTS interference on other
system MS.
For the uplink study, the interference scenarios considered are:
\- Other system MS  T-GSM 810 BTS
\- T-GSM 810 MS  Other system BTS
For these scenarios, the objective is to evaluate the impact of other system
MS interference on T-GSM 810 BTS and T-GSM 810 MS interference on other system
BTS.
Both TETRA and iDEN^TM^ are TDMA systems. The carrier separation is both
25kHz. There are similar wireless characteristics between the two systems. The
following analysis focuses on the T-GSM 810, iDEN^TM^, TETRA and T-CDMA
systems. It should also be noted that the coexistence between T-GSM 810 and
TETRA is considered to be feasible according to the ECC study [1].
# ZA.2 Coexistence scenario study
In this study, the coexistence scenarios are studied between T-GSM
810-iDEN^TM^, T-GSM 810-TETRA, T-GSM 810-T-CDMA systems. The following
subclauses provide coexistence analysis results for these three scenarios.
## ZA.2.1 T-GSM 810-iDEN^TM^
### ZA.2.1.1 Downlink study
In Table ZA.1 the calculations of the interference that occurs in different
downlink scenarios are provided.
Table ZA.1

* * *
NOTE 1: Required separation distance is calculated by Okumura/Hata urban
propagation loss model.
NOTE 2: T-GSM 810 BTS power = 60W, feed loss is 8dB.
NOTE 3: The significant source of iDEN^TM^ BTS interference on T-GSM 810 MS is
spectrum emission due to modulation of iDEN^TM^ BTS.
For the scenario T-GSM 810 BTS interfere iDEN^TM^ MS, when an iDEN^TM^ MS is
at a distance of 0.54km, the noise of the iDEN^TM^ MS increases by 3dB. The
signal to interference ratio is still 19dB. When an iDEN^TM^ MS is at a
distance of less than 0.54km from a T-GSM 810 BTS, the actual interference
exist in some area, but will not be significant, which can be eliminated by
site engineering solution in a real network deployment.
For the scenario iDEN^TM^ BTS interfere T-GSM 810 MS, when a T-GSM 810 MS is
at a distance of 150m from an iDEN^TM^ BTS, the noise of the T-GSM 810 MS
increases by 3dB. The signal to interference ratio is still 20dB. When a T-GSM
810 MS is at a distance of less than 150m from an iDEN^TM^ BTS, power control
is used, the actual interference will not be significant.
### ZA.2.1.2 Uplink study
In Table ZA.2 the calculations of the interference that occurs in different
uplink scenarios are provided.

NOTE 1: Required separation distance is calculated by Okumura/Hata urban
propagation loss model.
NOTE 2: The power -43dBm of iDEN^TM^ MS is spurious emission power.
For the scenario T-GSM 810 MS interfere iDEN^TM^ BTS, in the above table the
worst case is considered. In a real network, the T-GSM 810 MS transmit power
is far below the maximum output power and the required separation distance is
only about several meters. So the interference influence is not significant.
For the scenario iDEN^TM^ MS interfere T-GSM 810 BTS, from the above table,
the interference is small and can be tolerable. When an iDEN^TM^ MS is at a
distance of less than 0.15km from a T-GSM 810 BTS, the adjacent interference
can be tolerable. That can be solved by frequency plan solution in a real
network deployment. And the probability that the transmit power of an iDEN^TM^
MS is equal to the maximum output power is small. So the interference
influence is not significant.

significant.

When in China T-GSM 810 system is deployed together with other three systems,
the interference influence is not significant. Though in some scenarios the
requirements for T-GSM 810 and other systems are not sufficient to fulfill the
coexistence, this can be solved by co-ordination using site engineering
solutions and appropriate frequency planning in network deployment, or a guard
band can also be considered.

###### ### Annex ZB: Introduction of multicarrier BTS class
# ZB.1 Introduction
Multicarrier transceiver architectures applied to GSM BTSs would allow several
GSM carriers to be processed by a single transmitter and power amplifier in
the downlink and by a single wideband receiver in the uplink.
Given the recent advances in components technology, these architectures seem
more and more feasible, however feasibility is still conditioned by the
relaxation of some of the most severe requirements in 3GPP TS 45.005. Those
requirements are the ones related to intermodulation (clause 4.7) and spurious
emission (clause 4.3) for the transmitter part and to blocking characteristics
(clause 5.1) for the receiver part.
During the discussions in 3GPP TSG GERAN, for each of these three
specification parameters, a way to relax the standard was proposed and
evidence was given why such a relaxation has negligible impact on existing GSM
systems. This is due to the fact that in every case, an inconsistency exists
to another GSM specification requirement. Furthermore, scenarios were
presented and investigated in which the equipment features better performance
than according to the specifications. It was shown by means of calculations
and simulations that even then, the proposed relaxations have negligible
system impact. It was then agreed that the best way to apply the relaxations
is to introduce two multicarrier BTS classes with different levels of
relaxation concerning Tx intermodulation attenuation and spurious emissions.
This allows the adoption of the principle of the relaxation while being able
to address special regulatory issues in different geographical areas
separately. In addition, it was found necessary to measure also the spectrum
due to modulation and wideband noise of the transmitter with all carriers
active. It was recognized that with this setting, the spectrum due to
modulation and wideband noise cannot be distinguished in general from
intermodulation products. In order to simplify the measurements, a common
spectrum mask was defined covering all effects of interference (wideband
noise, intermodulation, spurious emissions) together. When deriving this
spectrum mask, it was recognized that in existing BTSs using several single
carrier transmitters, the wideband noise sums up at the antenna. As a
consequence, the \"cumulated wideband noise\" of existing BTSs was used as one
limit of the common spectrum mask.
In this chapter, the investigations done for the introduction of the new
multicarrier BTS classes are summarized.
# ZB.2 Transmitter
## ZB.2.1 Introduction
According to recent advances in components technology, implementation of
multicarrier transmitter architectures seems more and more feasible. However,
feasibility and power-efficient usage of hard-ware are still conditioned by
the relaxation of some requirements in 3GPP TS 45.005. The requirements that
need considerations are: Spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise (clause
4.2.1), spurious emission (clause 4.3) and intermodulation (clause 4.7). In
present specification these requirements are specified in different ways, i.e.
spurious emissions and Intermodulation are defined as peak-hold measurements
while Spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise is an average measurement.
This difference, which has been known since GSM phase 1, imply an
inconsistency between wideband noise measurement and IM/spurious emission
requirements. In the IM and spurious measurements, wideband noise peaks may
exceed IM and spurious emission although the equipment fulfils the
requirements for Spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise. This
difficulty is removed if average measurements are introduced for all these
parameters. In addition this is also in line with the specifications for other
3GPP access technologies. Another reason why a relaxation of the
Intermodulation Attenuation was seen as reasonable is the fact that not only
the BTS transmitter generates intermodulation products but also the MS
receiver: in an uncoordinated scenario, if an MS served by one operator is
very close to a BTS of another operator, the intermodulation products in the
MS receiver might exceed by far the intermodulation products received from the
BTS. But even with equipment over-performing the specifications and in case of
higher distances between the BTS and the MS, it was shown that the proposed
relaxation has negligible system impact. This can be seen in ZB.2.3.
## ZB.2.2 Proposal for relaxation and change
### ZB.2.2.1 Introduction of MCBTS class 1 and class 2
Initially, for each of the targeted specifications, one way of relaxation was
proposed. However, during the discussions within GERAN, it was found
reasonable to introduce not only one Multicarrier BTS class but two. The two
classes differ in the following way:
To make multicarrier transmitter feasible at all and still get reasonable
consistency between the intermodulation requirements for the mobile station
and the BTS requirements for intermodulation and spurious emission, the values
are proposed to be kept as today but measured in average mode. These
relaxations are defining multicarrier BTS class 1 requirements.
However, the relaxations for multicarrier BTS class 1 do not allow taking best
advantage of the power amplifier technology as power efficiency will suffer
from stringent Intermodulation requirements. To achieve improved efficiency of
the equipment, further relaxation of intermodulation attenuation requirements
is needed. The proposed level of relaxation is to allow closer alignment with
the corresponding requirements for other 3GPP access technologies. The
proposal is to, in addition to the relaxation for class 1, allow less
stringent requirements for third order intermodulation products, which are the
most crucial parameter to consider, and related out-of-band spurious
emissions. These relaxations are defining multicarrier BTS class 2
requirements.
### ZB.2.2.2 Spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise
Present requirement is a single-carrier measurement. To assure same
performance in multicarrier operation using multicarrier BTS as when using
single-carrier amplifiers combined in a combiner, additional requirements are
needed, when more than one carrier is active. The proposal is to, for
frequency offsets between 1.8 MHz and transmit band edge, reuse the
requirements for single-carrier amplifiers but allow for an increase of
wideband noise level of 10*LOG(N) dB, where N is the number of active
carriers. At appropriate third order intermodulation frequency offsets, taking
spectrum widening into account, the least stringent requirement of this
multicarrier wideband noise requirement and intermodulation requirement,
according to applicable multicarrier class, apply. For other frequency offsets
up to the highest third order intermodulation frequency + 200 kHz or 6 MHz,
whichever is highest, the least stringent requirement of the multicarrier
wideband noise requirement and the requirement for intermodulation according
to multicarrier class 1 apply. For larger offsets the multicarrier wideband
noise requirement applies.
To take the relaxed spurious emission requirements into account and potential
existence of higher intermodulation products, a number of exceptions are
allowed for frequency offsets higher than 1.8 MHz. The number of exceptions M
is proposed to increase linearly from the single-carrier requirements of 15
bands up to a maximum of 40 bands of 200 kHz, centered on a frequency that is
multiple of 200 kHz, according to the formula M= 15 + 3*(N-1), where N is the
number of active carriers.
### ZB.2.2.3 Spurious emission
The proposal is to introduce average measurements for spurious emission while
keeping the requirement value. As this corresponds to a relaxation of the
maximum level by approximately 9 dB and, in some scenarios, in the same order
of magnitude as the intermodulation, the number of allowable occurrences
inband and close proximity of transmit band is limited as described in section
ZB 2.2.2.
The out-of-band requirements for class 1 are proposed to be relaxed by
changing the measurement method, i.e. -36 dBm in average detector mode,
reusing the same measurement bandwidths as before. In addition to remove the
existing steps in the requirements a slope from 5 MHzto 10 MHz frequency
offset.
For class 2 additional relaxations are proposed to align with the
intermodulation requirements at frequencies where filtering is not feasible.
The proposal is to align with the requirements for UTRA and E-UTRA BS, where
appropriate. The same for principle with a slope for 5-10 MHz offset is used
here as well. For offsets ≥ 10 MHz the requirements are the same for all
multicarrier BTS classes.
The proposed requirements for class 1 and 2 are shown in the table below,
while reusing the same measurement bandwidths as for other BTS than
multicarrier BTS:

* * *
### ZB.2.2.4 BSS Intermodulation attenuation
The proposed requirements are as follows:
For multicarrier BTS class 1, the average value of intermodulation components
over a timeslot shall not exceed -70 dBc, -36 dBm or the requirements
specified in subclause 4.2.1, whichever is less stringent, for frequency
offsets between 1.8 MHz and the edge of the relevant Tx band. The measurement
bandwidth for both the carrier and the intermodulation products is 300 kHz for
offsets larger than 6 MHz and 100 kHz for offsets between 1.8 and 6 MHz.
For multicarrier BTS class 2, the average value of intermodulation components
over a timeslot shall not exceed the values required for multicarrier BTS
class 1 except that at third order intermodulation frequencies and their
adjacent channels (±200 kHz) the total power of the intermodulation components
may increase up to -60 dBc . The measurement conditions regarding frequency
offsets and measurement bandwidths are the same as defined for multicarrier
BTS class 1.
In addition the intermodulation products, for any output power of the BTS,
shall never exceed -16 dBm. This is aligned with requirements in UTRA and
E-UTRA.
## ZB.2.3 Simulation results
This clause provides the simulation results of impact due to relaxation of RF
requirements for MCBTS.
In the simulation two uncoordinated systems using GSM 900 were assumed to be
operating in the same location. The interfering system was using MCBTS(s) with
relaxed or un-relaxed requirement while the victim was using traditional
BTS(s). It was assumed that their operating frequency bands were next to each
other with 200 kHz guard band, so that all the relaxed IM and SE products fall
into the victim system band and, the BTSs of the interfering system were
assumed to be placed at the edge of the victim cells so that the impact would
be the worst. These settings correspond to very severe scenarios but yet
relevant for comparing the impact due to the relaxation.
The simulations were carried out separately by Alcatel-Lucent (scenario 1),
ZTE (scenario 2-3) and Ericsson (scenario 4-8). The according settings are
listed in Table 1 and Table 2 below.

## ZB.2.4 Impact to GSM-R due to relaxation
During the discussions within GERAN, great care was taken to consider possible
system impacts of the relaxations on GSM-R applications in railway networks.
Concerning the receiver blocking, a compromise could be found very easily by
not allowing the according relaxation for GSM-R receiver equipment. Concerning
the relaxations on the transmitter side, more investigations had to be done in
order to assess the impact of increased interference levels close to railway
lines. Since railway operators were not directly present at the GERAN
meetings, discussions were established with a railway operator in order to
clarify the worst case scenario from the railway perspective. This scenario is
given if a BTS of a \"public\" GSM network transmits close to the handover
zone between two GSM-R BTSs along a railway line. If the interferences caused
by the transmitter of the \"public\" GSM BTS are exceeding the minimum receive
level defined for GSM-R receivers in trains (between --92 and \--98 dBm
depending on the type of train), the link between the train and the GSM-R
network might be lost. For security reasons, the train then has to be braked
thus leading to unacceptable delays in the railway operation. During the
discussions with the railway operator, it was recognized that such situations
could occur in principle in uncoordinated scenarios. It was also recognized
that a whole number of counter measures can be applied to protect the GSM-R
system from such impacts. Such measures could be e.g.
\- Frequency coordination between the \"public\" GSM and the GSM-R network.
\- Minimum distance between the \"public\" BTS and the closest railway line.
\- Usage of duplex filters within the \"public\" BTS with sufficient
attenuation in the GSM-R frequency band.
\- Suited setting of output power and antenna directivity in the \"public\"
BTS.
It was agreed that the according measures have to be specified in detail as
\"regulatory restrictions\" for the usage of MCBTS during the regulatory
process after the GERAN approval of the relaxations.
# ZB.3 Receiver
## ZB.3.1 Proposal for the relaxation
Initially, it was proposed to relax the blocking requirements of the BTS
receiver by aligning them to those of DCS 1800. During the discussions, it was
found that on the GSM-R field, there are some differences to GSM networks used
for public communication: there are still high power MSs in use and the
antenna patterns differ concerning the directivity and the location. As a
consequence, it was agreed to split the blocking requirements in the way that
those of GSM-R application are unchanged and only those of \"public\" GSM
networks are relaxed by aligning to the values defined for DCS 1800. Later on
it was discussed how to deal with receive levels exceeding the relaxed
blocking values. Such high levels occur with a rather small probability but
due to complete blocking of the BTS receiver, they can lead to an amount of
drop calls that is not acceptable within GSM networks. Several possibilities
cover such rare cases were discussed. Finally, it was agreed that the best way
to solve this problem is to introduce a second higher blocking level at which
the sensitivity may degrade compared to the sensitivity that must be ensured
in the \"normal\" blocking case.
## ZB.3.2 Treatment of receive levels exceeding the new blocking limit
Collected path loss data from live networks shows that in dense city areas
input signal level will occur above the proposed blocking requirement.
However, the probability is low in most cells but there exist cells with
significant probability of higher input signal. This is probably due to
difficulties to locate base station in other location.
If the receiver was designed to process signals just up to this level, it
could be completely blocked by higher signal levels. This is due to the fact
that the AD converters have a fixed limit of their dynamic range.
Several possibilities were considered to deal with or avoid such situations:
\- Define a second higher blocking level (e.g. 3 dB higher) where larger
desensitization could be allowed.
\- Define a requirement on duration and levels of \"blind\" periods.
\- Increase the proposed blocking level to be 2-3 dB higher.
It was found that the first proposal delivers the most suitable solution which
fits best to the situation in the field: It leaves the value of \--25 dBm as
target value for the relaxation at which the full \"blocking sensitivity\" of
--101 dBm (original sensitivity of --104 dBm, desensitized in the blocking
case by 3 dB) has to be achieved. On the other side, it covers the rare cases
where very high blocking signals occur at the receiver. As it was shown above,
in such cases the receiver suffers also from a very high wideband noise level
caused by the transmitters of mobiles located close to the BTS in the
uncoordinated scenario. This noise level anyway leads to a significant
desensitization of the BTS receiver. That means that a certain desensitization
defined in the standard could not be \"seen\" by the GSM system. It was then
proposed to introduce a second higher blocking level with degraded
sensitivity.
### ZB.3.2.1 Simulation results
Both interfering system and victim system are modeled to investigate the
impact due to blocking requirement relaxation in near-far problem scenario.
Four different cases were simulated in the victim network:
\- M0: The current requirement where receiver is blocked for Blocking Signal
Strength (BSS) > -13 dBm.
\- M1: Receiver blocked at BSS > -25 dBm.
\- M2: Receiver blocked at BSS > -20 dBm.
\- -25 \ -15 dBm.
\- -25 \ **Nominal Sensitivity**
\- GSM BTS nominal sensitivity: -110 dBm
NOTE: Reference sensitivity for GSM BTS systems is specified at -104 dBm.
However, state of the art BTS have significantly better sensitivity than
specified. Therefore, this is considered in the feasibility study
\- UTRA BS nominal sensitivity: -121 dBm
\- E-UTRA BS nominal sensitivity: -101.5 dBm
NOTE: Nominal sensitivity for UTRA and E-UTRA BS are aligned to specifications
[6] and [7] as outlined by TSG RAN4 in [8].
> **Acceptable desensitization**
\- Acceptable desensitization of victim system: 0.8 dB
NOTE: While specified desensitization criteria for blocking and
intermodulation interferers are 3 dB for GSM BTS and 6 dB for UTRA and E-UTRA
BS, feasibility study on ER-GSM introduction considered desensitization of
impacted systems of 0.8 dB. This is because emissions of ER-GSM BTS in the DL
band 918-921 MHz are likely to be more continuous. The 0.8 dB desensitization
criteria was found acceptable by TSG RAN4[8].
> **Minimum Coupling Loss**
\- Minimum coupling loss between ER-GSM BTS and victim base station receiver
for uncoordinated deployment scenario: 67 dB.
NOTE: This figure is based on the assumed minimum coupling loss between base
stations [5].
> **Blocking performance**
\- Blocking performance for a GSM victim BTS is derived based on GERAN
specification [4] for an inband blocker with an offset larger than 3 MHz as
outlined in section ZD.2.2.3.
\- For blocking performance of UTRA and E-UTRA BS in the ER-GSM band feedback
was received in [8] that the assumed performance should be as specified in [6]
and [7] meaning that the inband blocking requirement in the band 880-915 MHz
is also applicable for the blocker at lowermost ER-GSM carrier frequency at
918.2 MHz and that there is no specific requirement in RAN4 specifications for
a blocker at uppermost ER-GSM carrier frequency at 921.0 MHz. Further
information on the derived performance at 918.2 MHz is provided in section
ZD.2.2.3.
### ZD.2.2.2 Blocker rejection by victim public base station
Receiver from victim system could be partly protected by rejection of diplexer
or Rx filter.
It was however agreed in TSG GERAN that public BSs exist where there is no
rejection at lowermost ER-GSM carrier frequency at 918.2 MHz (taking into
account frequency drift and ensure a flat insertion loss over the frequencies
in the pass band). In addition 0 dB rejection at 918.2 MHz corresponds to
assumptions for victim UTRA and E-UTRA BS in 3GPP RAN4[8]. Hence this worst
case scenario has been considered for the evaluation in the present annex in
order to determine the maximum ER-GSM output power per carrier in case of
uncoordinated and coordinated networks. For the transition region between
918.2-921.0 MHz a linear slope was agreed. The blocking rejection model for
the victim receiver is depicted below in Figure 1.
{width="3.2597222222222224in" height="2.727777777777778in"}
Figure 1: Blocker rejection model over UL/DL guard band assumed for victim
base station (E-GSM, UTRA, E-UTRA BS).
Based on feedback received from several network manufacturers, the two
parameters of the blocker rejection model for the victim base station were
defined in TSG GERAN:
\- There is no protection for the lowest ER-GSM carrier frequency at 918.2
MHz, hence the cut-of.frequency for the slope is at 918.2 MHz.
\- The slope coefficient of the linear slope in the frequency range between
918.2 and 921.0 MHz is 6 dB/MHz for GSM BTS victim system.
\- The slope coefficient of the linear slope in the frequency range between
918.2 and 921.0 MHz is 11 dB/MHz for UTRA BS or E-UTRA BS victim system.
### ZD.2.2.3 Blocking and Intermodulation reminders
In case of impact of ER-GSM BTS to GSM BTS victim station, a blocker level of
-13 dBm was assumed for single carrier legacy BTS and a blocker level of -25
dBm for MCBTS according to inband blocking specification for a blocker with a
larger offset than 3 MHz specified in [4].
In case of impact of ER-GSM BTS to UTRA/E-UTRA BS victim station, from the
investigation carried out in 3GPP RAN4 [8], a required isolation between GSM
BTS and UTRA/E-UTRA BS systems of 104 dB / 106 dB for an assumed output power
of 45 dBm per GSM carrier for ER-GSM BTS is determined. This investigation is
based on different assumed modulations for the narrowband blocker level:
whilst UTRA narrow blocking specification [6] is based on -47 dBm for a GMSK
modulated blocker, E-UTRA narrow blocking specification [7] is based on -49
dBm for an E-UTRAN UE blocker carrying 1 Resource Block having a higher PAPR
than the GMSK signal. Thus it was agreed to align the UTRA and E-UTRA blocking
requirements for the present study by reusing the blocker level defined for
UTRA (-47 dBm) for the E-UTRA analysis. Application of intermodulation
requirements was not considered further, since these correspond to inband
interferers with same interferer power, whilst in the present scenario victim
receiver filter attenuation on two carriers from the ER-GSM BTS is assumed to
be different.
### ZD.2.2.4 Desensitization computing method
In order to simplify the computations a method has been elaborated to evaluate
requested protection level for a given desensitization (0.8 dB) from
applicable specifications. Specified desensitization criteria are 3 dB for GSM
and 6 dB for UTRA and E-UTRA.
In order to simplify the computations a general desensitization computation is
developed to quickly estimate acceptable interferer. Starting from
desensitization as specified by a standard for a given interferer level, the
goal is to evaluate what interferer level can be accepted for a given
desensitization.
Comparing noise in a given bandwidth:
> Thermal noise floor: KTB\ After amplification with noise figure N: NKTB
> (equivalent at Rx input)\ Desensitization by X, noise floor becomes: X NKTB\
> Added noise = (X-1) NKTB\ Desensitization by Y, noise floor becomes: Y NKTB\
> Added noise = (Y-1) NKTB\ Ratio: (NKTB (X-1) / NKTB (Y-1))\ (X-1) / (Y-1)
>
> Ratio in dB is the interferer power level reduction requested to get YdB
> desensitization when a system is specified for XdB desensitization with a
> given interferer power level
For example with GSM (normal BTS):
> Specified blocker for -101 dBm sensitivity is -13 dBm (over 3 MHz offset)\
> Nominal sensitivity = -110 dBm,\ therefore desensitization is 9 dB with
> blocker as specified by 3GPP 45.005\ Acceptable desensitization in normal
> operation = 0.8 dB\ Delta (dB) = 15.4 dB.\ Acceptable blocker for a BTS with
> -110 dBm nominal sensitivity is:\ -13 dBm -- 15.4 dB = -28.4 dBm (for 0.8 dB
> desensitization)
### ZD.2.2.5 Coordinated and uncoordinated deployment
At CEPT coordination between public and railway operators is recommended to
alleviate interference cases reported by some railway operators (see [9]).
This recommendation would be applicable to ER-GSM deployment as well.
Considering this possibility, requirements on RF parameters in coordinated
case could be adjusted, in particular for the Minimum Coupling Loss to be
used.
### ZD.2.2.6 Exception to blocking requirement for ER-GSM mobiles
Because of the reduction of the guard band between RX and TX band to 3MHz it
was assumed that some relaxation related to out-of-band blocking performance
for interferers in the upper 3 MHz range of the E-GSM UL band is needed for
implementation reasons. A relaxed value for the blocking requirement (see
Table 5.1-2b Exceptions to Blocking requirements of [4]) is therefore
considered: -12 dBm instead of -7 dBm (R-GSM small MS) and -5 dBm (R-GSM MS),
respectively.
# ZD.3 Victim receiver performance for lowest frequency offset of ER-GSM
interferer
In this section the assumed receiver performance for the victim base station
(E-GSM, UTRA, E-UTRA) is derived from existing blocking performance
requirements in 3GPP specifications ([4],[6],[7]) and based on the assumptions
in section ZD.2. The performance is applicable for the lowest frequency offset
of the ER-GSM carrier from the EGSM UL band, i.e. at 918.2 MHz, where no
receiver filter attenuation is assumed, see clause ZD 2.2.2. The case of co-
existence between public and railway GSM systems is considered only.
## ZD.3.1 GSM BTS as victim receiver
In this section GSM BTS of a public GSM system is considered as victim
receiver and the maximum interferer level of the DL carrier frequency of the
ER-GSM base station at the victim receiver antenna port is determined for the
lowest frequency offset (918.2 MHz). In-Band blocking is defined up to bottom
of DL band (925 MHz) according to applicable standards, therefore, enough
isolation shall be met so that base station are not blocking each others.
Desentisitization from standard is converted to acceptable desensitization
using the desensitization computing method. The analysis is performed for
blocking.
Table 1 presents these evaluations for GSM legacy BTS and GSM MCBTS as victim
receiver for nominal performance level.
Table 1: Maximum ER-GSM blocker leval at victim base station (GSM BTS).
+--------------------------+---------------------------+------------+ | | One BCCH at full power, | | | | fixed frequency at lower | | | | Tx channel edge | | +--------------------------+---------------------------+------------+ | Accepted desensitization | SCBTS | MCBTS | | | | | | 0.8 dB | Nominal | Nominal | +--------------------------+---------------------------+------------+ | Sensitivity with blocker | -101.0 dBm | -101.0 dBm | +--------------------------+---------------------------+------------+ | Nominal sensitivity | -110.0 dBm | -110.0 dBm | +--------------------------+---------------------------+------------+ | Desensitization | 9.0 dB | 9.0 dB | +--------------------------+---------------------------+------------+ | Accepted desensitization | 0.8 dB | 0.8 dB | +--------------------------+---------------------------+------------+ | Delta | 15.4 dB | 15.4 dB | +--------------------------+---------------------------+------------+ | Blocker level | -13.0 dBm | -25.0 dB | +--------------------------+---------------------------+------------+ | Corrected blocker level | -28.4 dBm | -40.4 dBm | +--------------------------+---------------------------+------------+
From this evaluation the maximum allowed blocker level at victim receiver
antenna connector of -28.4 dBm results in case of GSM legacy BTS and of -40.4
dBm in case of GSM MCBTS as victim receiver.
## ZD.3.2 UTRA/E-UTRA BS as victim receiver
In this section UTRA or E-UTRA BS, respectively, of a public GSM system is
considered as victim receiver and the maximum interferer level of the DL
carrier frequency of the ER-GSM base station at the victim receiver antenna
port is determined for the lowest frequency offset (918.2 MHz). In-Band
blocking is defined up to bottom of DL band (925 MHz) according to applicable
standards, therefore, enough isolation shall be met so that base station are
not blocking each others. Desentisitization from standard is converted to
acceptable desensitization using the desensitization computing method. The
analysisis is performed for blocking.
Table 2 presents the evaluation for UTRA BS as victim receiver for the nominal
performance level.
Table 2: Maximum ER-GSM blocker leval at victim base station (UTRA BS).
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | | One BCCH at full power, fixed frequency | | | at lower Tx channel edge | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Accepted desensitization | UTRA BS | | | | | 0.8 dB | Nominal | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Sensitivity with blocker | -110.0 dBm | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Nominal sensitivity | -121.0 dBm | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Desensitization | 6.0 dB | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Accepted desensitization | 0.8 dB | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Delta | 11.7 dB | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Blocker level | -47.0 dBm | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Corrected blocker level | -58.7 dBm | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+
From this evaluation the maximum allowed blocker level at victim receiver
antenna connector of -58.7 dBm results in case of UTRA BS as victim receiver.
According to the consideration in clause 2.2.3 the maximum ER-GSM blocker
level for UTRA BS is also assumed for E-UTRA BS.
# ZD.4 Victim receiver performance in the ER-GSM frequency range
In this section the assumed receiver performance for the victim base station
(E-GSM, UTRA, E-UTRA) is derived from the receiver blocker rejection model in
the frequency range 918.2 to 921.0 MHz for victim base station depicted in
clause ZD.2.2.2 as well as from the determination of the maximum allowed
blocker level at lowest frequency offset of the ER-GSM interferer, i.e. at
918.2 MHz, depicted in table 1 in clause ZD.3 for GSM victim base station and
in table 2 for UTRA/E-UTRA base station, respectively for the case of co-
existence between public and railway GSM systems.
## ZD.4.1 GSM BTS as victim receiver
In the ER-GSM frequency range 918 to 921 MHz victim receiver has got
additional protection according to the blocker rejection model in clause ZD
2.2.2. Hence the maximum blocker level at victim GSM base station as depicted
in clause ZD 3.1 for a blocker at 918.2 MHz can be increased by the additional
rejection provided for the ER-GSM carrier frequency under investigation.
Thus the ER-GSM blocker level Pin,max at the victim BTS receiver should be at
most:
\- Pin,max = -28.4 dBm + (f-918.2)*6 dB in case of coexistence with legacy GSM
BTS
\- Pin,max = -40.4 dBm + (f-918.2)*6 dB in case of coexistence with GSM MCBTS
The calculation rule related to MCBTS as victim requiring a higher receiver
protection is selected for coexistence with public GSM systems.
It has been agreed in 3GPP TSG GERAN to specify for unccordinated operation
between public mobile and GSM railway networks the maximum output power level
at the agreessor side (ER-GSM) rather than the maximum allowed interferer
level at victim BS receiver side.
Taking into account the assumed MCL=67 dB for uncoordinated network operation,
see clause ZD.2.2.1, the maximum output power Pout,max of the ER-GSM BTS per
GSM carrier for uncoordinated networks with GSM BTS as victim receiver will be
:
\- Pout,max = -40.4 dBm + 67 dB + (f-918.2)*6 dB = 26.6 dBm + (f-918.2)*6 dB
with f being the DL frequency between 918.2 ... 921.0 MHz.
## ZD.4.2 UTRA/E-UTRA BS as victim receiver
As for GSM victim BTS, victim UTRA/E-UTRA BS receiver in the ER-GSM frequency
range 918 to 921 MHz has got additional protection according to the blocker
rejection model in clause ZD 2.2.2. Hence the maximum blocker level at victim
UTRA/E-UTRA base station as depicted in clause ZD 3.2 for a blocker at 918.2
MHz can be increased by the additional rejection provided for the ER-GSM
carrier frequency under investigation.
Thus the ER-GSM blocker level Pin,max at the victim BS receiver should be at
most:
\- Pin,max = -58.7 dBm + (f-918.2)*11 dB in case of coexistence with UTRA or
E-UTRA BS
It has been agreed in 3GPP TSG GERAN to specify for unccordinated operation
between public mobile and GSM railway networks the maximum output power level
at the agreessor side (ER-GSM) rather than the maximum allowed interferer
level at victim BS receiver side.
Taking into account the assumed MCL=67 dB for uncoordinated network operation,
see clause ZD.2.2.1, the maximum output power Pout,max of the ER-GSM BTS per
GSM carrier for uncoordinated networks with GSM BTS as victim receiver will be
:
\- Pout,max = -58.7 dBm + 67 dB + (f-918.2)*11 dB = 8.3 dBm + (f-918.2)*11 dB
with f being the DL frequency between 918.2 ... 921.0 MHz.
# ZD.5 Specified requirement based on co-existence analysis
From the evaluations in the present annex, it appears some specific RF
requirements are needed to ensure co-existence of ER-GSM and other 3GPP
systems deployed in E-GSM band. In particular the BTS transmitter maximum
rated output power per carrier shall be subject to regulatory coordination to
avoid uncoordinated system impacts based on the case of uncoordinated or
coordinated deployment in the same geographical area with other systems in the
E-GSM band as given in the present annex.
## ZD.5.1 Uncoordinated deployment
In case of uncoordinated deployment with other systems in the E-GSM band, in
order to prevent blocking, the BTS transmitter maximum rated output power per
carrier, measured at the input of the transmitter combiner, in the frequency
range 918-921 MHz shall be at most:
\- -40.4 dBm + MCL + (f-918.2)*6 dB in case of coexistence with GSM BTS
\- -58.7 dBm + MCL + (f-918.2)*11 dB in case of coexistence with UTRA and
E-UTRA BS
where f = DL frequency in MHz, 918.2 ≤ f ≤ 921.0 and MCL=67dB.
NOTE: While specified desensitization criteria for blocking and
intermodulation interferers are 3 dB for GSM BTS and 6 dB for UTRA and E-UTRA
BS, feasibility study on ER-GSM introduction considered desensitization of
impacted systems of 0.8 dB. This is because emissions of ER-GSM BTS in the DL
band 918-921 MHz are likely to be more continuous.
## ZD.5.2 Coordinated deployment
In case of uncoordinated deployment with other systems in the E-GSM band, MCL
higher than 67 dB can be taken into account to allow higher output power from
an ER-GSM BTS transmitting in 918-921 MHz.

**Title: Training Sequence Design for NewToN**
## ZE.1.1 Introduction
In this Subclause, a Training Sequence Code (TSC) set for NewToN is proposed.
In Subclause ZE.1.2, a method for designing training sequences is described.
In Subclause ZE.1.3, the proposed TSC set from Ericsson is presented.
## ZE.1.2 Training Sequence Design
The training sequence set candidate presented in this contribution has been
found using the search based method described in this section.
Consider candidate training sequences, $s(n)$, of length N
$s(n) = \left{ \begin{matrix} 0,\ n = 0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},N - 1 \ 0,\
\text{otherwise} \ \end{matrix} \right.\ $ (1)
and already decided training sequences, i.e. legacy training sequences and
possibly already decided NewToN sequences, $x(n)$, of length N
$x(n) = \left{ \begin{matrix} 0,\ n = 0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},N - 1 \ 0,\
\text{otherwise} \ \end{matrix} \right.\ $. (2)
Let $s^{'}(n)$ and $x^{'}(n)$ denote the rotated sequences. The $s(n)$:s are
rotated according to desired modulation and the $x(n)$:s are rotated according
to the modulation the sequence is defined for. Legacy sequences are rotated
for all modulations, i.e. 16 GMSK + 8 8PSK + 8 16QAM + 8 32QAM = 40 rotated
sequences. Also the GMSK dummy burst and possibly already decided NewToN
sequences are rotated according to the modulation used.
### ZE.1.2.1 Initial Search
Let $\Phi(s)$ denote cross correlation,
$\Phi(s) = \underset{\left{ \begin{matrix} k \in \left{ -
K,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},K \right} \ x^{'} \in X \ \end{matrix} \right.\
}{\text{max}}\left( \sum_{n = - \infty}^{\infty}{s^{'}(n)x^{}(n - k)}
\right)$, (3)
where
$K$ is a suitable maximum considered lag
$X$ is a suitable subset of all known $x^{'}(n)$
$(\text{.})^{}$ denotes complex conjugate
An exhaustive search through all possible training sequences was performed and
N~L~, a large number, sequences with the lowest $\Phi(s)$, were selected using
a suitably small value for $K$.
Also, any candidate sequence not fulfilling the following three requirements
where disqualified from the search.
\- Autocorrelation, $A(s)$, $\left| r_{s}\left( 1 \right) \right|$ and $\left|
r_{s}\left( 2 \right) \right|$ must be small.
$A(s) = \sum_{k = 1}^{N - 1}\left| r_{s}(k) \right|^{2},\ r_{s}(k) = \sum_{n =
k}^{N - 1}{s(n)s^{}(n - k)}$. (4)
\- Possible Least Squares (LS) regression matrices must have a low matrix
condition value (the ratio between maximum and minimum singular value).\ $C(s)
= \underset{L \in \left{ 3,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\text{10}
\right}}{\text{max}}\left{ \text{cond}(S^{H}S) \right},\ S = \begin{bmatrix}
s(L - 1) & s(L - 2) & \cdots & s(0) \ s(L) & s(L - 1) & & \vdots \ \vdots & &
\ddots & \vdots \ s(N - 1) & \cdots & \cdots & s(N - L) \ \end{bmatrix}$. (5)\
where $L$ is the channel length used in LS. A high condition value is
associated with high energy leakage from an interfering signal according to
the maximum channel estimation error defined in Subclause ZE.1.2.2.2.
\- The cross correlation $\Phi(s)$ against all known sequences must not be
high for large $K$. In this case $X$ is the set of all known rotated
sequences, including the dummy burst and possibly already decided NewToN
sequences.
### ZE.1.2.2 Building the Cost Function
#### ZE.1.2.2.1 Auto Correlation Cost
A maximized and normalized SNR-degradation, Ψ(s), was calculated for each of
the N~L~ best sequences. The normalized SNR-degradation, Ψ(s,L). The
maximization and normalization is done with respect to the channel length, L.
$\begin{matrix} \Psi(s) = \underset{L \in \left{
3,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\text{10} \right}}{\text{max}}\left{ \Psi(s,L)
\right},\ \Psi(s,L) = \text{10}\text{log}_{\text{10}}\left( 1 + \frac{N - L +
1}{L}\text{tr}\left{ \left\lbrack S^{H}S \right\rbrack^{- 1} \right} \right) \
S = \begin{bmatrix} s(L - 1) & s(L - 2) & \cdots & s(0) \ s(L) & s(L - 1) & &
\vdots \ \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots \ s(N - 1) & \cdots & \cdots & s(N - L) \
\end{bmatrix} \ \end{matrix}$, (6)
where tr{.} denotes the trace operator and (.)^H^ denotes complex conjugate
transpose. $L$ in the denominator of the scale factor compensates for the L
additions done by the trace operator. $N - L + 1$ in the nominator of the
scale factor compensates for the N-L+1 additions done for all elements in
$S^{H}S$.
#### ZE.1.2.2.2 Cross Correlation Cost
##### ZE.1.2.2.2.1 Basic Principle
The cross correlation cost between two sequences was calculated as the maximum
channel estimate error caused by the interfering training sequence when
employing a least squares estimator. The maximum is with respect to channel
length and time lag due to an unsynchronized interfering training sequence.
Consider the received signal during the training period from user \"k\" and
interferer \"p\",
$R = S_{k}h_{k} + S_{p}h_{p} + \text{noise}$, (7)
where h~k~ and h~p~ denotes the channel of interest and interfering channel,
respectively. Given the received vector R, the least squares estimate of h~k~
is given by,
${\hat{h}}_{k} = h_{k} + \left( S_{k}^{H}S_{k} \right)^{-
1}S_{k}^{H}S_{p}h_{p} + \text{error}$, (8)
where the error includes the contribution not captured by the model, i.e.
thermal noise, model error, etc. The training sequences should be selected
such that the energy leaked from an interfering signal $E\left\lbrack
h_{p,k}^{}h_{p,k} \right\rbrack$ is minimized, where $h_{p,k} = \left(
S_{k}^{H}S_{k} \right)^{- 1}S_{k}^{H}S_{p}h_{p}$. Assume a one branch receiver
and that the covariance of the channel h~p~ is equal to identity
(corresponding to independent and identically distributed taps). Using the
properties
$\text{tr}\left{ E\left\lbrack \right\rbrack \right} = E\left\lbrack
\text{tr}\left{ \right} \right\rbrack$ (9)
and
$\text{tr}\left{ \text{ABC} \right} = \text{tr}\left{ \text{BCA} \right} =
\text{tr}\left{ \text{CAB} \right}$ (10)
yields
$E\left\lbrack h_{p,k}^{}h_{p,k} \right\rbrack = \text{tr}\left{ \
S_{p}^{H}S_{k}\left( S_{k}^{H}S_{k} \right)^{- 1}\left( S_{k}^{H}S_{k}
\right)^{- 1}S_{k}^{H}S_{p} \right}$. (11)
The expression is normalized with respect to the channel length and scaled in
the same way as the SNR-degradation. If the interfering signal is
unsynchronized, the sequences do not completely overlap. The error due to the
interfering training sequence only depends on the overlapping part. This means
that the non-overlapping parts of the sequences need to be removed from S.
Denote these truncated versions of S as S(μ), where μ is the time lag between
user \"k\" and interferer \"p\". Note that the least squares algorithm still
remains the same, therefore the factors $\left( S_{k}^{H}S_{k} \right)^{- 1}$
are unchanged. The maximum impact from an interfering sequence s~p~ using the
carrier sequence s~k~ is denoted \"cross correlation cost\" and is defined as,
$\begin{matrix} \Delta_{b}(s_{k},s_{p}) = \underset{\left{ \begin{matrix} L
\in \left{ 3,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\text{10} \right} \ \mu \in \left{ -
6,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},6 \right} \ \end{matrix} \right.\
}{\text{max}}\left{ \Delta_{b}(s_{k},s_{p},L,\mu) \right} \
\Delta_{b}(s_{k},s_{p},L,\mu) = \text{10}\text{log}_{\text{10}}\left( 1 +
\left( \frac{N - L + 1}{N - L + 1 - \left| \mu \right|}
\right)^{2}\frac{1}{L}\text{tr}\left{ S\left( \mu
\right)_{p}^{H}S(\mu)_{k}\left( S_{k}^{H}S_{k} \right)^{- 1}\left(
S_{k}^{H}S_{k} \right)^{- 1}S(\mu)_{k}^{H}S(\mu)_{p} \right} \right) \
\end{matrix}$ (12)
$L$ in the denominator of the scale factor compensates for the L additions
done by the trace operator. For lag equal to zero, $\mu = 0$, the N-L+1
additions for each element in the $\left( S^{H}S \right)^{- 1}$:s are
compensated by the N-L+1 additions for each element in $S_{k}^{H}S_{p}$ and
$S_{p}^{H}S_{k}$. The scale factor $\left( \frac{N - L + 1}{N - L + 1 - \left|
\mu \right|} \right)^{2}$ compensates for the reduced number of additions in
$S_{k}^{H}S_{p}$ and $S_{p}^{H}S_{k}$ for lags not equal to zero.
The auto correlation cost Ψ(s) and cross correlation cost Δ~b~(s~k~,s~p~) for
all N~L~ sequences are stored in a matrix X.
$X = \begin{bmatrix} \Psi(s_{0}) & \Delta_{b}(s_{0},s_{1}) & \cdots &
\Delta_{b}(s_{0},s_{N_{L} - 1}) \ \Delta_{b}(s_{1},s_{0}) & \Psi(s_{1}) & &
\vdots \ \vdots & & \ddots & \Delta_{b}(s_{N_{L} - 2},s_{N_{L} - 1}) \
\Delta_{b}(s_{N_{L} - 1},s_{0}) & \cdots & \Delta_{b}(s_{N_{L} - 1},s_{N_{L} -
2}) & \Psi(s_{N_{L} - 1}) \ \end{bmatrix}$ (13)
##### ZE.1.2.2.2.2 Used Model
Subclause ZE.1.2.2.2.1 describes the basic principle used when searching for
TSCs. However, for the NewToN work the basic principle was modified to
include:
\- Adjacent channel interference.
\- Modulation rotations.
\- Cross correlation between different modulations and between NewToN
candidates and legacy sequences. Thus, the training sequence code of the
desired signal,$s_{k}(n)$, is not necessarily taken from the same TSC set or
list as the training sequence code of the interfering signal, $s_{p}(n)$.
The channel h~p~ is split into Tx-filter, $y$, Rx-filter, $g$ and channel,
$h$.
$h_{p} = \text{YGh}$ (14)
An adjacent channel interferer with frequency offset $f_{\Delta} = \pm
\text{200}\ \text{kHz}$ is perceived as a rotated interferer with rotation
$e^{j2\text{πf}_{\Delta}\text{nT}} = e^{\pm j\frac{\text{96}}{\text{65}}n}$,
for $T = 1\frac{\text{13}}{\text{48}}\text{10}^{6}\ s$.
The interfering signal after the Tx-filter is
$\gamma\left( n \right) = e^{\text{jφn}}\sum_{k = 0}^{L_{y} - 1}{s_{p}^{'}(n -
k)y(k)},\ \varphi = \left{ \begin{matrix} \pm \frac{\text{96}}{\text{65}}\pi,\
\text{adjacent}\ \text{channel} \ 0,\ \text{co}\ \text{channel} \ \end{matrix}
\right.\ $. (15)
After the combined channel and Rx-filter ($z(t) = g(t) \ast h(t)$), where *
denotes convolution, the received signal is
$\begin{matrix} r(n) = \sum_{m = 0}^{L_{z} - 1}{\gamma(n - m)z(m) =}\sum_{m =
0}^{L_{z} - 1}{e^{\text{jφ}(n - m)}\sum_{k = 0}^{L_{y} - 1}{\left( s_{p}^{'}(n
- k - m)y(k) \right)z(m) =}} \ = e^{\text{jφn}}\sum_{m = 0}^{L_{z} -
1}{\sum_{k = 0}^{L_{y} - 1}{\left( s_{p}^{'}(n - k - m)y(k) \right)z(m)e^{-
\text{jφm}}}} \ \end{matrix}$, (16)
i.e. a rotated received signal and a de-rotated channel z(t). The received
signal in matrix notation is
$R = S_{k}^{'}h_{k} + e_{+}S_{p}^{'}\text{Ye}_{-}\text{Gh} + \text{noise}$,
(17)
where
$\begin{matrix} e_{+} = \begin{bmatrix} e^{\text{jφ}0} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \ 0 &
e^{\text{jφ}1} & \ddots & \vdots \ \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \ 0 & \cdots &
0 & e^{\text{jφ}(N - L)} \ \end{bmatrix},\ e_{-} = \begin{bmatrix} e^{-
\text{jφ}0} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \ 0 & e^{- \text{jφ}1} & \ddots & \vdots \ \vdots
& \ddots & \ddots & 0 \ 0 & \cdots & 0 & e^{- \text{jφ}(L_{g} + L_{h} - 2)} \
\end{bmatrix} \ S^{'} = \begin{bmatrix} s^{'}(L - 1) & s^{'}(L - 2) & \cdots &
s^{'}(0) \ s^{'}(L) & s^{'}(L - 1) & & \vdots \ \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots \
s^{'}(N - 1) & \cdots & \cdots & s^{'}(N - L) \ \end{bmatrix} \ \end{matrix}$
(18)
The least squares estimate of h~k~ is
${\hat{h}}_{k} = h_{k} + \left( S_{k}^{}S_{k}^{'} \right)^{-
1}S_{k}^{}e_{+}S_{p}^{'}\text{Ye}_{-}\text{Gh} + \text{error}$. (19)
Note that this least squares use rotated sequences, this is equivalent to
using un-rotated sequences and de-rotating the received signal, this is shown
inSubclause ZE.1.4. Rotated sequences are used here for simplicity.
The training sequences should be selected such that the energy leaked from an
interfering signal $E\left\lbrack h_{p,k}^{}h_{p,k} \right\rbrack$ is
minimized, where $h_{p,k} = \left( S_{k}^{}S_{k}^{'} \right)^{-
1}S_{k}^{}e_{+}S_{p}^{'}\text{Ye}_{-}\text{Gh}$. Assume a one branch receiver,
an unknown Rx-filter and that the covariance of the Rx-filter and channel are
equal to identity (corresponding to independent and identically distributed
taps).
Similarly as in Subclause ZE.1.2.2.2.1
$E\left\lbrack h_{p,k}^{}h_{p,k} \right\rbrack = \text{tr}\left{ \
Y^{H}S_{p}^{}e_{+}^{}S_{k}^{'}\left( S_{k}^{}S_{k}^{'} \right)^{- 1}\left(
S_{k}^{}S_{k}^{'} \right)^{- 1}S_{k}^{}e_{+}S_{p}^{'}Y \right}$. (20)
Because of the assumptions on G and h $E\left\lbrack h_{p,k}^{}h_{p,k}
\right\rbrack$ becomes independent of G, h and $e_{-}$. The expression is
normalized with respect to the total unknown channel length (L~h~+L~g~-1 =
L-L~y~+1) and scaled in the same way as the SNR-degradation. The resulting
cost is cubed to increase the dynamic range to punish bad pairs.
If the interfering signal is unsynchronized, the sequences do not completely
overlap. The error due to the interfering training sequence only depends on
the overlapping part. This means that the non-overlapping parts of the
sequences need to be removed from S\', denote these truncated versions of S\'
as S\'(μ), where μ is the time lag between user \"k\" and interferer \"p\".
Note that the least squares algorithm still remains the same, therefore the
factors $\left( S_{k}^{}S_{k}^{'} \right)^{- 1}$ are unchanged. The maximum
impact from an interfering sequence s\'~p~ (with some modulation) when using
the carrier sequence s\'~k~ (with some modulation) is denoted \"cross
correlation cost\" and is defined as,
$\begin{matrix} \Delta(s_{k}^{'},s_{p}^{'}) = \underset{\left{ \begin{matrix}
L \in \left{ 3,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\text{10} \right} \ \mu \in \left{ -
6,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},6 \right} \ \end{matrix} \right.\
}{\text{max}}\left{ \Delta(s_{k}^{'},s_{p}^{'},L,\mu) \right} \
\Delta(s_{k}^{'},s_{p}^{'},L,\mu) = \left(
\text{10}\text{log}_{\text{10}}\left( 1 + \frac{\left( \frac{N - L + 1}{N - L
+ 1 - \left| \mu \right|} \right)^{2}}{\text{max}(L - L_{y} +
1,1)}\text{tr}\left{ Y^{H}S_{p}^{}(\mu)e_{+}^{}S_{k}^{'}(\mu)\left(
S_{k}^{}S_{k}^{'} \right)^{- 1}\left( S_{k}^{}S_{k}^{'} \right)^{-
1}S_{k}^{}(\mu)e_{+}S_{p}^{'}(\mu)Y \right} \right) \right)^{3} \
\end{matrix}$ (21)
Note that if L is smaller than L~y~ the length of the total unknown channel is
1 and the Tx-filter is truncated to its strongest taps. For scaling purposes
the sum of the used Tx-filter taps should be equal to one.
The cost matrices when comparing candidate sequences of the same modulation
for co-channel interference are
$D(s^{'}) = \begin{bmatrix} \Psi(s_{0}) & \Delta(s_{0}^{'},s_{1}^{'}) & \cdots
& \Delta(s_{0}^{'},s_{N_{L} - 1}^{'}) \ \Delta(s_{1}^{'},s_{0}^{'}) &
\Psi(s_{1}) & & \vdots \ \vdots & & \ddots & \Delta(s_{N_{L} - 2}^{'},s_{N_{L}
- 1}^{'}) \ \Delta(s_{N_{L} - 1}^{'},s_{0}^{'}) & \cdots & \Delta(s_{N_{L} -
1}^{'},s_{N_{L} - 2}^{'}) & \Psi(s_{N_{L} - 1}) \ \end{bmatrix}$, (22)
where the sub-scripted number denotes a unique sequence among the candidates.
The cost matrices when comparing sequences of different modulation, with
adjacent channel interference or when comparing against legacy sequences are
$F(s_{k}^{'},s_{p}^{'}) = \begin{bmatrix}
\overset{\sim}{\Delta}(s_{k}^{},s_{p}^{}) &
\overset{\sim}{\Delta}(s_{k}^{},s_{p}^{}) & \cdots &
\overset{\sim}{\Delta}(s_{k}^{},s_{p}^{}) \
\overset{\sim}{\Delta}(s_{k}^{},s_{p}^{}) &
\overset{\sim}{\Delta}(s_{k}^{},s_{p}^{}) & & \vdots \ \vdots & & \ddots &
\overset{\sim}{\Delta}(s_{k}^{},s_{p}^{}) \
\overset{\sim}{\Delta}(s_{k}^{},s_{p}^{}) & \cdots &
\overset{\sim}{\Delta}(s_{k}^{},s_{p}^{}) &
\overset{\sim}{\Delta}(s_{k}^{},s_{p}^{}) \ \end{bmatrix}$, (23)
where k and p denote two different sets of sequences and the super-scripted
number denotes unique sequences in those sets. Each element in F is calculated
as the maximum value of $\Delta(s_{k}^{'},s_{p}^{'})$ and
$\Delta(s_{p}^{'},s_{k}^{'})$,
$\overset{\sim}{\Delta}(s_{k}^{'},s_{p}^{'}) = \text{max}\left(
\Delta(s_{k}^{'},s_{p}^{'}),\Delta(s_{p}^{'},s_{k}^{'}) \right)$. (24)
The cost function for co-channel interference becomes (including sensitivity)
$\begin{matrix} \text{Cost}_{\text{co} - \text{channel}} =
a_{{\text{Mod}1}^{H}}D\left( s_{\text{Mod}1}^{'} \right)a_{\text{Mod}1} +
a_{{\text{Mod}2}^{H}}D\left( s_{\text{Mod}2}^{'} \right)a_{\text{Mod}2} +
a_{{\text{Mod}1}^{H}}F\left( s_{\text{Mod}1}^{'},s_{\text{Mod}2}^{'}
\right)a_{\text{Mod}2} + \ \+ a_{{\text{Mod}1}^{H}}F\left(
s_{\text{Mod}1}^{'},\text{Legacy} \right)1 + a_{{\text{Mod}2}^{H}}F\left(
s_{\text{Mod}2}^{'},\text{Legacy} \right)1 + \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} \
\end{matrix}$ (25)
for the relevant modulations (here only two are shown). \"Legacy\" includes
the legacy sequences rotated for each modulation (including set 2 for GMSK)
and the GMSK dummy burst. The cost functions for adjacent channel interference
becomes
$\begin{matrix} \text{Cost}_{\text{adj} - \text{channel}} =
a_{{\text{Mod}1}^{H}}F_{\text{ADJ}}\left(
s_{\text{Mod}1}^{'},s_{\text{Mod}1}^{'} \right)a_{\text{Mod}1} +
a_{{\text{Mod}2}^{H}}F_{\text{ADJ}}\left(
s_{\text{Mod}2}^{'},s_{\text{Mod}2}^{'} \right)a_{\text{Mod}2} + \ \+
a_{{\text{Mod}1}^{H}}F_{\text{ADJ}}\left(
s_{\text{Mod}1}^{'},s_{\text{Mod}2}^{'} \right)a_{\text{Mod}2} +
a_{{\text{Mod}1}^{H}}F_{\text{ADJ}}\left( s_{\text{Mod}1}^{'},\text{Legacy}
\right)1 + a_{{\text{Mod}2}^{H}}F_{\text{ADJ}}\left(
s_{\text{Mod}2}^{'},\text{Legacy} \right)1 + \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} \
\end{matrix}$ (26)
where \"ADJ\" indicates that $\varphi \neq 0$ when calculating
$\Delta(\text{.},\text{.})$.
The total cost function is
$\overset{\sim}{a} = \underset{\left{ \begin{matrix} a:\
\sum_{i}^{}{a_{n}\left( i \right)} = b_{n} \ a_{n}(i) \in \left{ 0,1 \right},\
i = 0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},N_{L} - 1 \ \end{matrix} \right.\
}{\text{argmin}}\left{ w_{\text{co}}\text{Cost}_{\text{co} - \text{channel}} +
w_{\text{adj} +}\text{Cost}_{\text{adj} - \text{channel}}^{+} + w_{\text{adj}
-}\text{Cost}_{\text{adj} - \text{channel}}^{-} \right}$, (27)
where b~n~ is the number of desired sequences for NewToN set n and $w_{x}$ are
weights.
The NewToN sequences are found by minimizing the cost function. The solution
was found using a combination of the steepest descent method and a full search
approach.
### ZE.1.2.3 Performing the search
The search can be performed either by searching for all sequences at once or
by searching in multiple iterations - one iteration for each new NewToN
subset. The first iteration decides the NewToN GMSK sequences. The second
iteration decides the 8PSK sequences, and so on. The decided sequences from
the previous iterations are considered both in the initial search and in the
resulting cost function. When calculating $\Phi(s)$ during the initial search
only the legacy sequences up to the currently considered modulation is
considered. For example when searching for a GMSK set, only legacy GMSK is
considered and when searching for an 8PSK set, the legacy GMSK sets the new
GMSK sets and the legacy 8PSK set are considered.
To optimize performance for VAMOS the resulting NewToN GMSK sequences are
sorted to maximize the paired performance between set 3 and set 4 for GMSK.
Also the best sequence in each pair is assigned to set 3 to maximize non-VAMOS
GMSK performance.
## ZE.1.3 Proposed Training Sequence Code Set
The training sequence symbols used in the extended training sequence sets are
captured in Table 2 to Table 6.
Antipodal constellation points from each modulation scheme are used to
construct the training sequence in the burst mapping. The mapping of training
sequence symbols to bit sequences follow the mapping used for the legacy TSC
sets and is captured in Table 1.

## ZE.1.4 Equivalence of rotational approaches
The most straight-forward way to model cross correlations between sequences of
different modulation (or same modulation) is to:
a) Rotate carrier according to carrier modulation and interferer according to
interfering modulation and de-rotate the received signal according to the
carrier modulation. Use least squares with un-rotated sequences.
For simplicity in this case it is more convenient to:
b) Rotate carrier according to carrier modulation and interferer according to
interfering modulation, do not de-rotate. Use least squares with sequences
rotated according to carrier modulation.
For the purpose of calculating $E\left\lbrack h_{p,k}^{}h_{p,k} \right\rbrack$
a) and b) are equivalent, this is shown below.
Let $\varphi$ be the carrier modulation rotation and $\phi$ be the interferer
modulation rotation.
The rotated carrier can be expressed as:
Similarly the rotated interferer can be expressed as:
Some useful identities (valid both for $\varphi$ and $\phi$):
The model for b) is
$b):\left{ \begin{matrix} R = S_{k}^{'}h_{k} + e_{+}S_{p}^{'}\text{Yz} +
\text{noise} \ h_{p,k} = \underset{\text{rotated}\ \text{LS}\
\text{sequences}}{\overset{\left( S_{k}^{}S_{k}^{'} \right)^{-
1}S_{k}^{}}{\underbrace{}}}e_{+}S_{p}^{'}\text{Yz} \ \end{matrix} \right.\ $,
where $z$ is the combined channel and Rx-filter which is assumed unknown and
$e_{-}$ is omitted based on results in Subclause ZE.1.2.2.2.2.
Similarly as in Subclause ZE.1.2.2.2.1
$E\left\lbrack h_{p,k}^{}h_{p,k} \right\rbrack = \text{tr}\left{ \
Y^{H}S_{p}^{}e_{+}^{}S_{k}^{'}\left( S_{k}^{}S_{k}^{'} \right)^{- 1}\left(
S_{k}^{}S_{k}^{'} \right)^{- 1}S_{k}^{}e_{+}S_{p}^{'}Y \right}$.
Using the identities shown above yields
which corresponds to
and the received signal
$\begin{matrix} \overset{\sim}{R} =
\varphi_{+}^{}\varphi_{+}S_{k}\underset{{\overset{\sim}{h}}_{k}}{\overset{\varphi_{-}h_{k}}{\underbrace{}}}
+ \varphi_{+}^{}e_{+}\phi_{+}S_{p}\phi_{-}\text{Yz} + \text{noise} = \
S_{k}{\overset{\sim}{h}}_{k} +
\varphi_{+}^{}e_{+}\underset{\text{rot}\text{.}\
\text{in}\text{terf}\text{.}}{\overset{\phi_{+}S_{p}\phi_{-}}{\underbrace{}}}\text{Yz}
+ \text{noise} \ \end{matrix}$$$.
The term $\varphi_{+}^{}$ is the de-rotation with the rotation of the carrier,
hence the model above is a).
Which proves that when calculating $E\left\lbrack h_{p,k}^{}h_{p,k}
\right\rbrack$ a) and b) are equivalent.

The relation between cell radius and ISD is a factor x3, i.e. the ISDs
simulated are 1500m (baseline MUROS assumption), 750 m, 500 m and 300 m, since
a hexagonal cell structure is used.
Each network simulated is evaluated at 2 % blocking without activation of the
VAMOS feature.
Delay statistics are collected separately for UL/DL and separately for CCI (Co
Channel Interference) and ACI (Adjacent Channel Interference).
An interfering burst is only logged if the signal level is above the thermal
noise level at the receiver reference point.
### ZE.3.2.2 Non-ideal network synchronization
Network synchronization in GSM is typically done using either GPS based
synchronization or a software based synchronization.
A non-ideal factor of network synchronization has been used as described in
Table 3.
Table 3. VAMOS time offset model.
* * *
Time offset [symbol] Probability [%] -1 25% 0 50% 1 25%
* * *
### ZE.3.2.3 Collection of results
The results are analyzed for each frequency re-use pattern, ISD, use of power
control, network load and split between UL/DL. The interference is separated
on CCI and ACI, and for each interference type the distribution of the three
strongest interferers is collected.
It has been assumed that any variation of parameter not having significant
impact on the final distribution will not be separated. For example, if no
significant difference is seen between the DL and UL distribution, the same
distribution (an average of the UL and DL distribution) is proposed to be used
for both UL and DL simulations.
The different scenarios simulated have been weighted based on input from
operators. Equal weights have been used except for different frequency re-use
patterns where the weighting factors are captured in Table 4.

Frequency re-use Weight 1/1 10 % 1/3 20 % 3/9 35 % 4/12 35 %

Apart from using a 0.5 symbol delay resolution, the distribution is limited to
0.5 resolution of percentage figures.

**Title: NewToN -- Performance evaluation**
## ZE.4.1 Introduction
A new work item on **New** **T** raining Sequences f**o** r GERA**N** ,
acronym NewToN, was approved at GERAN#60.
The work consists of defining new training sequences for both CS and PS
services in GERAN with the aim to reduce the cross correlation between TSCs to
primarily allow for a more spectral efficient implementation of synchronized
GSM networks.
The new TSC sets are referred to as Set 3 and Set 4 for GMSK modulation (two
sets introduced double the TSC sets in the CS domain), while for other
modulations referred to as Set 2.
A performance evaluation framework has been agreed to be able to select among
different TSC proposals. Currently, there is only one TSC proposal available,
but the framework can also be used to compare a TSC proposal to the legacy TSC
sets. In Annex A, a relative performance comparison according to the framework
is shown. The final metric (basically a weighted average of the performance
with all possible combinations of TSCs for carrier and interferer in various
scenarios) for the new TSC set is found to be 0.7 dB better than legacy when
including TSC set 2 for GMSK, and 1.5 dB if only TSC set 1 from all
modulations are considered.
Whereas this is an attractive improvement, it may not fully reflect the
expected gains of NewToN. One important aspect of extending the set of
training sequences is that it increases the possibilities of TSC planning so
that under-performing TSC combinations can more easily be avoided.
In this contribution, the following aspects of using an extended TSC set are
investigated:
\- The benefits of extended TSC sets for TSC planning are investigated:
\- In Section ZE.4.2, the impact of co-TSC interference -- interference from
an interferer with the same TSC as the wanted signal -- is studied on link
level based on system level statistics.
\- In Section ZE.4.3 system level simulations using TSC planning with current
and existing TSC sets are evaluated both in a non-VAMOS and VAMOS network
scenario.
\- The benefit of extended TSCs sets according to the agreed performance
framework is presented in Section ZE.4.4.
## ZE.4.2 Impact of co-TSC interference
### ZE.4.2.1 Introduction
Figure 1 illustrates an extreme example of the impact of co-TSC interference.
An IRC receiver interfered by a single co-channel interferer has been
simulated. The interferer is synchronized to the carrier but has a propagation
delay according to the agreed propagation delay model for NewToN.
In the \"Co-TSC\" case, the interferer always has the same TSC as the carrier,
whereas in the \"Other TSC\" case, the interferer TSC is randomly chosen from
the other seven TSCs in GMSK set 1.
At 1% FER, the difference between the two curves is about 18 dB. Even though
this is in an extreme scenario, it is obvious that co-TSC interference is very
detrimental to IRC. Similar results (not shown here) have been noticed for a
SAIC receiver.

Figure 1: FER vs C/I with single CCI.
### ZE.4.2.2 System model of co-TSC interference
To assess the impact of TSC planning to reduce co-TSC interference in real
networks, the following approach has been taken:
1) For a given network, TSC planning is performed seeking to avoid strong co-
TSC interference. Two different TSC plans were derived using eight TSCs
(corresponding to the legacy case without VAMOS) and 16 TSCs (corresponding
e.g. to the case of extended TSC sets), respectively. The TSC planning
algorithm is proprietary but should be seen to reflect a realistic TSC
planning in the field.
2) System simulations are run using the derived TSC plans to get statistics of
interference levels and co-TSC probabilities.
3) The statistics are used to build an interference model that is used in a
link simulator to derive link performance impacts.
#### ZE.4.2.2.1 Network configuration
The considered network is a tight reuse network with 100% speech users and
with the network load placed at around 2% hard blocking. The configuration is
summarized in Table 1.
Table 1: Parameters for the system simulations.

* * *
#### ZE.4.2.2.2 Interferer strength
The strength of the carrier and the two strongest CCI interferers, the two
strongest ACI+ interferers and the two strongest ACI- interferers are logged
for each transmitted burst in the system. The statistics are binned based on
the C/I~tot~ (where I~tot~ is the total interferer energy) before fast fading.
For a given C/I~tot~, the median strength of each of the interferers is
stored. This way, a C/I-dependent interferer strength profile is derived.
The results are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 for the uplink and for the
downlink, respectively. The individual interferer strengths as well as I~tot~
are defined after the RX filter assuming and an ACP of 18 dB.
An interesting observation is that at low C/I levels, the interference is
dominated by the strongest CCI (especially for downlink), whereas at higher
C/I, the second strongest CCI and the ACIs become increasingly prominent
(i.e., closer in strength to the strongest CCI).

#### ZE.4.2.2.3 Co-TSC probability
The co-TSC probabilities for the two strongest CCIs are also derived from the
system simulation statistics. The probabilities are calculated per cell. CDFs
over all cells are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 for uplink and downlink,
respectively.

Figure 5: CDFs of co-TSC probability in downlink scenarios.
To cover a wide range of situations in the network, three different scenarios
are considered when deriving the likelihood of co-TSC in the interferer
models: the 10^th^ percentile (corresponding to a good cell from a TSC
planning perspective), the median (corresponding to a median cell) and the
90^th^ percentile (bad cell). The probabilities are summarized in Table 2.

### ZE.4.2.3 Link level simulations
Based on the statistics derived in Section ZE.4.3, an interference model is
built and used in link simulations.
#### ZE.4.2.3.1 Interference model
The interference model consists of two CCI interferers, two ACI+ interferers
and two ACI- interferers. Their relative strengths (before fast fading) are
set according to Figure 2 (for uplink simulations) and Figure 3 (for downlink
simulations) depending on the C/I.
The CCI interferers randomly use the same TSC as the carrier with
probabilities given in Table 2 for a given configuration (in total there are
12 configurations in Table 2 -- two link directions, two different TSC plans
and three different percentiles). When the co-TSC is not chosen, one of the
other TSCs (7 or 15 other, depending on the used TSC plan) is chosen randomly
with a uniform distribution. The ACI interferers randomly choose a TSC from
all available (8 or 16) TSCs. The carrier always uses TSC 0 from legacy set 1.
In the 16 TSC plan case, the GMSK TSC Set 3 is used in addition to the legacy
GMSK TSC Set 1.
All interferers are GMSK modulated. The NewToN propagation delay models are
used.
#### ZE.4.2.3.2 Other simulation parameters
Other simulation parameters are listed in Table 3.

#### ZE.4.2.3.3 Results and discussion
Plots of class 1A FER versus C/I are shown in sub clause ZE.4.7) for both
uplink and downlink. The gains at 1% FER are collected from all scenarios into
a CDF in Figure 6.
It is evident that even though the co-TSC probabilities are much smaller than
in the 100% co-TSC scenario in Figure 1, they have a significant impact on
performance. The average gain seen is roughly 2 dB. This gain is partly due to
the reduced co-TSC probability and partly due to the better cross correlation
properties of the extended TSC set.

## ZE.4.3 System level simulations
### ZE.4.3.1 Introduction
System level simulations have been carried out using a dynamic system
simulator where a link simulator object has been integrated in each radio link
to model the link level performance of each user.
Hence, instead of using Link-2-System mappings, which is the conventional
method to model radio link performance on system level, the link performance
is modeled on IQ-level with demodulators called for each user and each burst.
This allows the evaluation of system performance to fully take into account
complex aspects such as TSC allocation and their impact on system capacity.
### ZE.4.3.2 Simulation assumptions
The same system level configuration as presented in Table 1 was used to
simulate UL network performance. AFS12.2 was used for the non-VAMOS network
performance evaluations and AFS7.95 for the VAMOS network performance
evaluations to get a quality limited network below the load of 2 % blocking.
I.e. using for example AFS4.75 results in a blocking limited network where
system capacity gains due to improved network quality cannot be measured.
The same TSC planning algorithm was used as described in Section ZE.4.2.2.
Since this planning principle mainly aims at avoiding co-TSC interference
there is a need to map a specific TSC value/index to each specific TSC value
in the plan. In other words, the TSC planning algorithm will determine for
example that e.g. cells [1,15,27,35,52,89,115,132,145] should have the same
TSC in order to avoid co-TSC in the network (and similar cell-vectors exist
for all 8 or 16 TSCs). It will however, not map a specific TSC to these cells.
In order to estimate the impact on the results from different TSC plans, three
different, randomly chosen, mapping vectors were generated and simulated. The
result for each simulated scenario is an average of these three mapping
alternatives. It can be noted that the TSC planning implies that TSCs from
one, or two sets, are used for a basic TSC plan in the network. This implies
that legacy TSC set 1 is not used in half of the cells (in case of using a TSC
plan of 16).
The two TSC planning scenarios as described in Section ZE.4.2.3.1 was also
evaluated on system level. In addition, the TSC plan of 16 available TSCs,
only taken from the proposed NewToN set was also simulated. This scenario
would represent a system with a high penetration of NewToN MS where the new
set could be used as a baseline in the TSC planning, and the legacy set is
only used when allocating users in a VAMOS channel.
The metric on \"Happy users\" is taken from the MUROS study where a \<2% call
FER is classified as a \"Happy user\" when simulating FR channels.In the non-
VAMOS simulations a 100 % MS penetration level of legacy MS, or NewToN MS
(when TSC set 3 and TSC set4 is used) has been assumed.
In the VAMOS simulations a 100 % MS penetration level of VAMOS MS, or NewToN
VAMOS MS (when TSC set 3 and TSC set4 is used) has been assumed.
### ZE.4.3.3 Results -- non-VAMOS
The results are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7. System level results with different TSC mapping plans -- non VAMOS
It can be seen that the system level capacity gains in reference to the legacy
8 TSC planning are quite substantial both for the case of using legacy set 1
together with NewToN set 3, with further gains when adding a complete TSC plan
using the NewToN set.
The results in terms of system capacity gains are also summarized in Table 4
at the quality limit of 95% Happy users.

### ZE.4.3.4 Results -- VAMOS
The intention of the NewToN work, by increasing the number of TSCs in the CS
domain from 16 to 32 was to realize a two times increase in the number of TSCs
used for TSC planning when supporting VAMOS.
In this section VAMOS performance is evaluated assuming different TSC planning
strategies with and without NewToN TSCs. The TSC sets used for the TSC plans
are represented by \'TSC sets for TSC plan\' : \'Paired TSC sets for VAMOS
allocation\'. For example \"Set 1 : Set 2\" implies that TSC set 1 is used for
the baseline TSC plan (i.e. TSC re-use eight), and that TSC set 2 is used in
case of users being in VAMOS mode. The VAMOS principle is followed in that
only paired TSCs of the same index are considered. For example, in \'Set 1+3 :
Set 2+4\' TSCs of set 1 is only paired with TSCs of set 2 using the same TSC
index.
The simulation assumptions in Section ZE4.3.2 are followed.
The results are shown in Figure 8. The system capacity gains with VAMOS are
shown in the legend (i.e. capacity gains compared to the non-VAMOS case when
the system is at 2% blocking).
{width="6.325in" height="4.218055555555556in"}
Figure 8. System level results with different TSC mapping plans -- VAMOS.
Two different TSC plans without NewToN have been used, either applying an 8
re-use or a 16 re-use. The benefit of using a 16 re-use is that the
probability of co-TSC is vastly reduced in case of a low loaded network (not
many VAMOS connections), while at high loads the VAMOS connections increase
and the plan, in the extreme case of only VAMOS connections, effectively
reduces to an 8 TSC re-use. It can be seen from the simulations that the gap
between the two curves without NewToN (blue) diminishes with increasing load.
For NewToN both using TSC set 1+3 (16 re-use), and TSC set 2+3 (16 re-use) was
simulated. TSC set 2+3 was simulated to see what could be gained at a high
loaded network scenario with NewToN MS (i.e. where TSC set 1 is not used for
basic TSC planning but only in VAMOS connections).
It can be seen that additional system capacity gains of 12-18 percentage
points are brought by using NewToN with the VAMOS feature compared to using a
16 TSC re-use without NewToN.
## ZE.4.4 Performance comparison according to NewToN framework
In Section ZE.4.6, the performance gain of the proposed TSC set according to
the performance evaluation framework is shown. The gain is shown compared to
two different references. The first reference is the legacy training sequences
for all modulations, excluding GMSK TSC Set 2 (except for the VAMOS
performance, for which both GMSK TSC sets were used). Compared to this
reference, the gain is 1.5 dB, when averaged across all scenarios defined in
the framework.
The second reference is using all legacy training sequences, i.e., GMSK TSC
Set 2 is included. The gain compared to this reference is 0.7 dB.
It can be seen that gains of up to 4.8 dB is observed in the extreme scenario
(32QAM carrier, GMSK interferer) while some performance losses are also
observed, mainly in scenarios where low weight is given to the interferer
scenario, modulation combination according to the agreed framework. The most
extreme loss is observed in the ACI performance scenario with 32QAM carrier
and 8PSK interferer.
To illustrate the performance Figure 9 is used, reflecting the difference of
the 16 CCI modulation combinations in the Annex. As can be seen, 50% of the
combinations are above 3 dB and 2 dB respectively for \'TSC set 1\' and \'TSC
set 1 and 2\' respectively. The losses are at most 1 dB, but most of them ≤
0.5 dB.

Figure 9. \'CDF\' of NewToN gains compared to performance evaluation framework
-- CCI.
To further analyze the point where of a loss of 1 dB is observed (C: GMSK, I:
8PSK versus TSC set 1), Figure 10 has been produced that shows the linear
average of C/I at 5 % BER for different TSC sets combinations for this
specific modulation combination.
{width="5.747916666666667in" height="3.5208333333333335in"}
Figure 10. Breakdown of CCI case with C: GMSK, I: 8PSK.
It can be observed that:
\- The legacy case (red color in figure) consist of two parts, \"GMSK1 +
8PSK1\" and \"GMSK2 + 8PSK1\". These differ significantly in performance. The
average of these, denoted \"GMSK1/2 + 8PSK1\", constitutes our reference case.
Compared to this, there is a gain of 0.3 dB for NewToN, \"GMSK1/2/3/4 +
8PSK1/2\".
\- If comparing only to legacy set 1 (\"GMSK1+8PSK1\"), there is a loss of 1
dB.
\- Looking more into details, one can see:
\- \"GMSK3 + 8PSK1\" and \"GMSK4 + 8PSK1\", i.e. new TSC:s for carrier and
legacy TSC:s for interferer, are both better than \"GMSK1 + 8PSK1\". This is
good and should be the most important case for a NewToN MS (using GMSK and
being interfered by 8PSK), and is roughly 1.5 dB better than the collected
legacy performance of TSC set 1 and 2 (\"GMSK1/2 + 8PSK1\").
\- \"GMSK1 + 8PSK2\" and \"GMSK2 + 8PSK2\", i.e. how legacy GMSK sets perform
when interfered by the new 8PSK set, is in the middle, on each side of the
legacy case with difference around 0.3 dB.
\- \"GMSK3 + 8PSK2\" and \"GMSK4 + 8PSK2\" are worse (but still better than
the legacy \"GMSK2 + 8PSK1\" case). This is the least likely case (NewToN MS
interfered by other NewToN MS).
\- The differences seen can be taken into account in network planning, i.e. it
is shown that the NewToN sets are superior when interfered by the legacy set,
while NewToN GMSK sets interfered by NewToN 8PSK set is inferior. Hence,
effectively a network could have more loose relation between cells of new
TSCs, and stronger relation between cells using new and legacy sets
respectively.
## ZE.4.5 Conclusions
In this contribution, the impact of co-TSC interference (interference with the
same TSC as the wanted signal in a synchronized network) has been
investigated. Further, the gains of having a sparser TSC plan (as enabled by
e.g. NewToN) have been assessed. It was found that by using 16 TSCs instead of
eight in the TSC plan, the probability of strong co-TSC interference can be
reduced, resulting in a link level gain of around 2 dB.
The new TSC set has also been investigated on system level using a dynamic
system level simulator with an integrated link level simulator object in
detail modeling the impact of TSCs allocation for each radio link. System
capacity gains in the range of 34 - 47 % were observed compared to a system
utilizing TSC set 1 for the TSC plan. When NewToN was used together with
VAMOS, additional VAMOS capacity gains of 12 - 18 percentage points were
observed. The simulations does not take into account the most likely
deployment scenario where TSC set 1 is planned in all cells, in which case
lower system capacity gains are expected. For example, if a 5 % penetration
level is assumed, the system capacity gains would be significantly reduced.
Furthermore, the proposed TSC set was evaluated with the agreed framework to
provide on average 1.5 dB and 0.7 dB gains respectively when compared with TSC
set 1 and TSC set 1 and TSC set 2. The gains were seen to provide rather large
variations depending on scenario with maximum gain at 4.8 dB, but also noting
some losses mainly in the less prioritized scenarios according to the agreed
framework. For one important case a loss of up to 1 dB was observed. More
analysis was provided to explain the reason for the performance difference,
showing that the new GMSK sets interfered by legacy 8PSK set (sub-set of the
total metric) provides a gain of roughly 1.5 dB, which is considered to be the
most important sub-set of this metric.

**Title: Simulator for investigation of GPRS & EC-EGPRS synchronization
performance (update of GP-151123)**
## ZF.2.2 Introduction
The purpose of this discussion paper is to describe a new simulator dedicated
to investigate (E)GPRS, and EC-GSM-IoT, network synchronization. The ability
to configure TSC and BSIC plans is also described.
## ZF.2.3 Simulator description
### ZF.2.3.1 General
In the FS_IoT_LC SI synchronization performance was investigated in a
sensitivity limited scenario to capture performance at the coverage limit of
the proposed candidate solutions. Results for EC-GSM-IoT are captured under
the name EC-EGPRS in sub-clause 6.2.6.1 of TR 45.820 [1].
The scope for the EC-GSM-IoT WI is expanded compared to the FS_IoT_LC SI, in
that performance in tight frequency reuse is to be investigated. It is
therefore expected that sensitivity limited simulations is not sufficient to
capture effects expected on synchronization performance from interference due
to tightening of the frequency reuse.
The EC-GSM-IoT/(E)GPRS link level simulator developed during the FS_IoT_LC SI
has therefore been integrated in a network simulator where a full EC-GSM-IoT
or GSM system can be configured and interference generated accordingly. The
simulator is designed to evaluate network synchronization performance. It can
also be easily modified to evaluate cell selection, as presented in GP-160270,
Cell Selection Performance for (E)GPRS and EC-GSM-IoT.
Since EC-GSM-IoT is backwards compatible and expected to co-exist with GSM it
is required to, in addition to modelling EC-GSM-IoT performance, also study
legacy (E)GPRS performance. The simulator is capable of evaluating both
technologies.
### ZF.2.3.2 Network configuration and plan
The simulator is capable of modelling the GSM/EC-GSM-IoT BCCH layer, using a
configurable frequency, normal burst TSC and BSIC plan. Typically special
importance is given to the frequency plan, but in this context also the BISC
plan is of high importance since the BSIC is the cell identifier used at cell
selection and synchronization.
Below is illustrated a BSIC and normal burst TSC plan, using 8 unique BSICs
and TSCs, when a 1/3 frequency reuse pattern is configured in a network
consisting of 16 sites and 48 three sector cells. Each site is marked as a
star (*) and each frequency and BSIC pair is marked as _fx,by_ where x and y
denotes the assigned ARFCN and BSIC numbers. The ARFCN is selected from the
set {1,2,3} and the BSIC from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, using decimal
encoding. The TSC was selected from TSC set 1 and use same plan as the BSIC.
It is worth to notice that both GSM and EC-GSM-IoT uses a single Extended TSC
on the SCH and a single Extended TSC on the EC-SCH (see 3GPP TS 45.002). So
the below TSC plan is only applicable on the normal bursts mapped on the
51-multiframe structure of the BCCH carrier.
{width="3.6743055555555557in" height="2.75625in"}
Figure ZF.2.3-1: Frequency, BSIC and TSC plan in a 1/3 frequency reuse network
Furthermore, to align with the work done during the FS_IoT_LC SI the network
was in general configured in accordance with the settings agreed for system
level simulations captured in Table D.1. \"Assumptions for system level
simulations\" in TR 45.820. When legacy (E)GPRS performance was studied it
should be noted that no Building penetration loss (BPL) was modelled (see WA10
in Annex ZF.1), the MS antenna gain was set to 0 dBi (see WA11c in Annex ZF.1)
and the cell radius was set to 577 or 2500 meter (see WA11b in Annex ZF.1).
### ZF.2.3.3 Mapping and timing of logical channels
To mimic real network performance the simulator supports a correct mapping of
the logical channels onto the BCCH carrier 51-MF structure. Support for both
GSM 51-MF containing the FCCH and SCH being mapped on Time slot 0 (TS) and the
EC-GSM-IoT 51-MF containing e.g. the EC-SCH mapped on TS 1 is implemented. The
EC-CCCH/D on TS 1 was modelled as normal burst repeated twice to capture the
EC-AGCH and EC-PACH Coverage Class 1 dual burst blocks. See 3GPP TS 45.002 for
a detailed description of the mapping of logical channels onto the 51-MF.
The starting frame number for each modelled BCCH carrier was selected randomly
according to a uniform distribution.
### ZF.2.3.4 Relevant range of coupling loss
In the FS_IoT_LC SI a inter site distance of 1732 meter, corresponding to a
cell radius of 577 meter, was modelled. When combining the distance dependent
path loss with shadow fading and building penetration loss (BPL), a Maximum
Coupling Loss (MCL) of 164 dB was targeted, and achieved with EC-GSM-IoT.
When investigating impact on legacy devices it is assumed that BPL does not
apply, and that the antenna gain is set to 0 dBi. Note that loss of 4 dB was
assumed in the FS_IoT_LC SI for EC-GSM-IoT devices due to the ultra-low cost
and small form factor. As a result the MCL achieved with a cell radius of 577
m will not reach the desired 144 dB. To model the maximum coupling loss for
legacy devices, the cell radius is increased to 2500 meter. This cell size
gives a path loss model that, when combined with a lognormal shadow fading
component with a standard deviation of 8 dB, will result in roughly 0.5% of
all devices being at 144 dB coupling loss or beyond. This provides a
background and an explanation to the agreed WA11b in Annex ZF.1.

Figure ZF.2.3-1: Coupling loss at a cell radius of 2500 meters
### ZF.2.3.5 Realistic interference model
In the simulator, a network is laid out according to the chosen configurations
and a number of users are spread out over the system. For each user, the best
serving cell, as well as all neighboring interfering cells, are found. Co-
channel, and adjacent-channel (on both sides of the wanted signal) interferer
types and levels are identified. For each user attempting to synchronize to a
cell a wanted signal and a set of interfering signals are generated which are
all independently faded and scaled with the applicable BS-to-MS gain
(excluding fast fading). Thermal noise from the receiver is also added to the
signal to model the radio environment as experienced by each user in the
system. The signals are represented by an oversampled IQ trace, generated from
a number of 51-multiframes (MF) with a frame structure according to the BCCH
carrier.
At most 2n-2 adjacent interferers are generated in the simulator, where n
equals the number of clusters configured. The number of co-channel interferers
is at most n-1. To get sufficient statistics it is useful to simulate a system
containing at least 9 clusters. In a 9 cluster system up to eight co-channel,
eight adj.-plus and eight adj.-minus interferers may exist. Modelling all
these interferers are however computational heavy, and make the simulation
work impractical. It is hence desirable to minimize the number of modelled
interferers, while not sacrificing result accuracy.
Figure ZF.2.3-2 shows the overall DL SINR CDF for a 1/3 frequency reuse system
built on nine clusters. Each curve depicts the total SINR taking the x
strongest co-channel, x strongest adj.-plus, x strongest adj.-minus
interferers and thermal noise into account. It can be seen that modelling only
the four strongest co-channel, four strongest adj.-plus, four strongest
adj.-minus interferers have a small impact on the overall SINR
characteristics. The median value is e.g. impacted less than 0.5 dB compared
with modelling the eight strongest co-channels, eight strongest adj.-plus, and
eight strongest adj.-minus interferers. At the important tail of the CDF
approaching the lower SINR range the difference between the curves diminish
further.
{width="3.6805555555555554in" height="2.754861111111111in"}
Figure ZF.2.3-2: DL SINR CDF for one to eight interferers modelled in a 1/3
reuse system
To evaluate the impact from the number of modelled interferers on actual
network synchronization performance more in detail, a full simulation was run.
Again a 1/3 frequency reuse system was studied, where the number of modelled
interferers was varied. The system was configured in accordance with Annex D
of TR 45.820 with the exception that 100% legacy (E)GPRS users was simulated
meaning that BPL was turned off and MS antenna gain was set to 0 dBi. The cell
radius was set to 2500 meter.
To compensate for the loss in interference energy, seen in figure ZF.2.3-2,
when a reduced set of interferers are modelled an energy scaling of the
modelled interferers was introduced so that the total energy remains
unaffected by the number of modelled interferers.
Figure ZF.2.3-3 depicts the time to synchronization for between one and six
modelled interferers of each interferer type. It can be seen that the results
are fairly insensitive to the modelled number of interferers. It seems to be
the interfering energy that is of highest relevance for the time until
synchronization. This may be explained by the simple energy detector used to
detect presence of a FCCH burst. More details on the detector are given in
sub-clause ZF.2.3.6.
In figure ZF.2.3-3 and figure ZF.2.3-4, results for time and frequency error
after FCCH detection is presented. Also these results suggest that a reduced
number of interferers can be modelled with limited and acceptable impact on
accuracy.

### ZF.2.3.6 Receiver model
The EC-GSM-IoT FCCH detector and EC-SCH decoder have been inherited from the
studies performed during the FS_IoT_LC SI on EC-GSM-IoT and captured in the TR
45.820 in sub-clause 6.2.6.1. EC-SCH performance is based on the so called
alternative EC-SCH design where the requirement on phase continuity has been
removed. EC-SCH support for the proposed Radio Frequency Colour Code (see e.g.
GP-160292, \"Introduction of Radio Frequency Colour Code\") is implemented.
The (E)GPRS FCCH detector is just as the EC-GSM-IoT version built around a FFT
module computing the energy in frequency bins of gradually finer granularity.
To keep the computational complexity low the FFT is implemented as a sliding
DFT working on a four times down sampled signal. To make the detector
insensitive to path gain, and to follow fading variations the energy in
frequency f and burst b is calculated relative the energy in frequency f and
burst n-1. If this relative energy exceeds a configured threshold it is
assumed a FCCH is found. A know offset to the closest SCH is added, and the
SCH is extracted and decoded. If the CRC fails, the search continues for the
next FCCH instance.
The performance of the SCH decoder for a TU1.2 channel is presented below.

Figure ZF.2.3-6: SCH TU1.2 performance in sensitivity limited scenario
Typical output from the simulator are time to first (EC-)SCH decoding, as
depicted in figure ZF.2.3-5, and residual frequency and time error, as
depicted in figure ZF.2.3-3 and figure ZF.2.3-4, for legacy (E)GPRS devices in
a 1/3 frequency reuse scenario. The introduction of the BSIC plan also allows
for studying the likelihood of detecting and synchronizing to sub-optimal
cells configured with the same or a different BSIC as the optimal cell.
The false detection rate performance of the (E)GPRS receiver was also
investigated. In simulation with random input a false detection rate of
9x10^-5^ was recorded for 25.000 iterations, where each iteration lasted two
51-multiframes.
## ZF.2.4 Discussion and conclusions
This paper introduces a simulator dedicated to evaluation of (E)GPRS and EC-
GSM-IoT network synchronization. Typical output from the simulator are
presented for a 1/3 frequency reuse network in a scenario where a device wakes
up and reconfirms its FCCH and SCH.
The sourcing company believes this simulator serves as a good basis to model
network synchronization procedures in a tight frequency reuse network, but
also understands that the results presented are linked to the scenario
investigated as well as the FCCH detector implemented and the (EC-)SCH
performance modelled.
It can finally be noted that the simulator was used to derive the
synchronization and cell selection performance presented in Annex ZF.5 for
1/3, 3/9 and 4/12 frequency reuse networks.

**Title: EC-GSM, Link modeling methodology for EC-RACH capacity evaluations
(update of GPC150193)**
## ZF.3.2 General
Instead of using mapping tables to model link performance as traditionally
used in system level simulations, a methodology is used where the link
simulator is integrated in the system, so that a link simulator object is used
for each radio link.
Effectively this can be seen as running thousands of parallel link level
simulators, each with unique interferer profiles per transmitted block.
## ZF.3.3 Minimizing execution time
### ZF.3.3.1 General
Significant increase in computational complexity is expected when comparing
the use of a link level based methodology compared to a mapping based
methodology. Instead of basically handling a few scalars, and doing one or
more table look-up(s) per user, signals are modeled down to IQ-sample level
with channel propagation and demodulation of each block.
Hence, some simplifications are used to speed up the simulation time. Some
general description is also provided below on interference modeling
### ZF.3.3.2 Interferers
#### ZF.3.3.2.1 Interferer types
Only CCI (Co-Channel Interference) and first adj-channel interferer is modeled
by the link simulator. Thus, any higher order adj-channel interferers are
discarded.
The interferer bursts are all modeled with random bits in the TSC symbol
positions to model a non-synchronized network. Also, this is typically what is
used in legacy L2S mapping procedures for GSM when generating the mapping
tables.
#### ZF.3.3.2.2 Minimum number of interferers
In a system simulation there are typically a significant number of interferers
experienced by each radio link. Due to the frequency re-use of the system,
interferers at longer distance to the receiver will generally have lower
gains. How different number and types of (e.g. co-channel and/or adj-channel)
interferers impact the receiver performance is very dependent on the receiver
architecture.
In conventional L2S mappings all interferers are typically converted to a
corresponding co-channel interferer power and the L2S mapping only takes into
account a total interferer power. For more advanced receiver architectures,
utilizing e.g. some kind of interference suppression, this approximation is
too coarse and the L2S mapping model need to be extended with e.g. the number
of interferers, type of interferers and relative power of the interferers.
By integrating the link level simulator in the system level simulator the
problem of correctly capturing these effects is no longer a concern. However,
modeling all interferers in a system will require unnecessary processing power
without adding value to the evaluation of the receiver performance.
The minimum number of interfering bursts that needs to be generated for each
carrier burst is set to a fixed number per interfering class.
\'Class\' is here referring to any difference in Tx-characteristics between
interferers and/or interferer types. Thus, an EC-RACH CCI using a single
transmission would be classified as a different class compared to a EC-RACH
CCI using two transmissions.
The minimum number used in the evaluations is set to three interferers per
class.
So, for example, one possible combination could be:
3 {CCI, 1 Tx} + 3 {CCI, 2 Tx} + 1 {CCI, 4 Tx} + 3 {ACI+, 1 Tx} + 3 {ACI-, 1
Tx} + 1 {ACI-, 2 Tx} = 14 interferers modeled.
#### ZF.3.3.2.3 Requirement on modeled energy level
An additional requirement on the total interfering enery level in each class
is also added. This is to ensure that at least a certain amount of the energy
in each class is modeled. This would primarily ensure performance accuracy in
cases where the number of interferers is higher than the minimum number
modeled and the interferers are at similar signal levels. The requirement of
minimum modeled energy will also result in interferers with low energy to be
discarded but the total interfering level remain unchanged.
#### ZF.3.3.2.4 Conservation of energy
Both when limiting the interferers based on a fixed number and/or a
requirement on modeled energy level it is always the momentary, faded energy
level that is used.
Further, in order to conserve interferer energy the remaining interferers are
scaled based on the residual interferer power discarded per each class. Hence,
no interference energy is lost, only the number of signals used to model the
interference.
### ZF.3.3.3 Oversampling
An oversampling rate of four has been used for evaluation of the link
performance.
### ZF.3.3.4 Pre-generation of bursts
To avoid the rather computational-heavy propagation of the radio channel of
each user to each base station (this is needed for each carrier, but also for
every interfering burst), pre-generation of bursts are used with the assumed
channel propagation profile (TU 1.2 km/h).
Since the EC-RACH is a single block transmission (i.e. a user will only
transmit one block and then turn to the CCCH DL to look for an assignment),
with a time interval in-between attempts that exceed the time coherency of
TU1.2, the generation of bursts will follow TU1.2 within a repetition
interval, but a new channel realization is used between each repetition
interval.
### ZF.3.3.5 Verification
#### ZF.3.3.5.1 General
Link level assumptions for the verification simulations are listed in table
ZF.3.3-1.

The interferer model used is mostly used to construct a pessimistic scenario
for verification. It should be noted that due to the methodology used, any
interference scenario will be correctly modeled, and hence this is only to
force a worst case scenario in terms of evaluating the impact on the
limitation of number of interferers used, and in this regard, the scenario
with equal power of all interferers, and having all interferers of the same
type, is the scenario most impacted by the limitation.
All simulations are run with 20 different seeds when generating the bursts for
the integrated link simulator. From the outcome of the simulations, a root
mean square error is calculated to get an understanding of the modeling error
caused by the simplification seen.
#### ZF.3.3.5.2 Sensitivity limited performance
The sensitivity performance for different number of pre-generated bursts has
been used to understand the impact on the root mean square error (RMSE)
introduced by the simplifications used.
As can be seen from figure ZF.3.3-1, using 1000 pre-generated bursts causes a
RMSE of around 0.2 dB over the 20 seeds generated. This is seen as more than
enough to model accurate EC-RACH performance, and hence is assumed to be used
in all system level simulations.
{width="4.126388888888889in" height="2.754166666666667in"}
Figure ZF.3.3-1: Sensitivity performance
#### ZF.3.3.5.3 Interference limited performance
For the interference scenarios, more diversity is collected within one
simulation due to the interference diversity and hence the conclusion from the
sensitivity simulations of 1000 pre-generated frames is used in all
simulations.
In figure ZF.3.3-2, CO-3 scenarios have been simulated for EC-RACH. This is
considered to be a worst case scenario in terms of the number of interferers
needed to model correct link level performance. The structure of the
interfering signal is most impacted if the interfering levels are similar for
the different interferers.
The number of external co-channel interferers has been set to 3 and different
requirements on minimum level of total modeled signal energy have been
scanned.
The reference performance is the true performance from the link level
simulator.
In the figures the performance difference (y-axis) is compared at 10% EC-RACH
BLER to the performance with no limitation on interferers.

Figure ZF.3.3-2: Different CO-interferers with one (top), and three (bottom)
minimum number of interferers assumed
As can be seen, the RMSE of the performance difference is very small.
Based on these results it is concluded that for system level simulations, the
minimum number of interferers can safely be set to 3, and the minimum modeled
energy to 90 % in order to correctly model link performance. In the worst case
scenario considered here, this ensures a RMSE modeling error of around 0.1 dB
for CCI, and 0.2 dB for ACI.

(update of GPC150441)**
## ZF.4.2 Model
### ZF.4.2.1 General
The link level performance is modeled by several mapping tables using a two-
stage mapping.
{width="3.7868055555555555in" height="1.2666666666666666in"}
Figure ZF.4.2-1: Traditional mapping methodology for GSM
The first stage maps instantaneous SINR per burst to raw BER. This will
consider impairments of different kinds, demodulator performance etc. Four
instantaneous SINR values are collected for PS services in GERAN, representing
the four bursts of a radio block.
The second stage typically maps the mean and standard deviation of the raw BER
values of the different bursts (four bursts in case of a radio block) to a
Block Error Rate Probability (BLEP). This is to reflect the impact of the
channel coding of the MCS. Typically one mapping is required per MCS.
### ZF.4.2.2 Mapping tables
#### ZF.4.2.2.1 First stage mapping (SINR → BER)
The mapping tables used for the first stage mapping are based on single
antenna performance. Impairment models, e.g. frequency offset, are used in the
generation of the results. Since only one modulation type and one demodulator
is considered there is no multitude of mapping tables for this reason.
No separate mapping is used for repeated bursts (see how SINR is derived in
this case in Section 3.3).
The mapping is done by linear interpolation of a tabulated SINR to BER values
from link level simulations.
Two different mappings are used; one to represent interference limited
scenarios, and one for sensitivity limited scenarios.
The different mapping tables are applied on a burst-by-burst basis. I.e. for a
specific radio block, which consists of four bursts, some of the bursts could
be taken from the interference mapping, and some from the sensitivity mapping.
An 18 dB suppression of adjacent channel interference is assumed to arrive at
a corresponding co-channel interference level, in order to define SINR
consistently. The same suppression is used in the system level simulations.
No specific interference suppression is used by the receiver, and hence no
advanced mapping methodology with for example dominant-to-rest-of-interferer
ratio is needed, as used for example in the SAIC study is needed.
#### ZF.4.2.2.2 Second stage mapping (BER → BLEP)
The second stage mapping is generated per used MCS. That is, one mapping is
generated for MCS-1, MCS-2, MCS-3 and MCS-4 respectively.
This mapping is only dependent on the input bit error rates (BER), and hence
the BER from both the sensitivity and interference limited first stage mapping
is using the same second stage mapping.
To capture the impact on the error correction capabilities by the different
code rates of the MCSs both the average BER and the standard deviation of the
BER over the four bursts are collected. A high standard deviation indicates
more diversity, and is typically favorable for MCSs with low enough code rate,
while the opposite is true for MCSs with code rate close to 1.
#### ZF.4.2.2.3 Mapping choice
With these mappings figure ZF.4.2-1 can be expanded to what is shown in figure
ZF.4.2-2.
In the first stage mapping the mapping table is chosen based on sensitivity or
interference per burst and instantaneous SINR value. In the second stage
mapping, the mapping table is chosen based on the MCS used by the radio link.

Figure ZF.4.2-2: L2S methodology and mapping selection
### ZF.4.2.3 SINR handling
#### ZF.4.2.3.1 Blind repetition
In EC-GSM-IoT blind repetitions are performed when in extended coverage. At
the receiver side, the blind repetitions can be accumulated on IQ level or on
soft bit level. How the receiver handles the multiple repetitions being
received is implementation dependent. To model this in a straightforward way
the following approach is taken.
First, assume that the wanted signals are added coherently. This is the case
for the EC-GSM simulations that have so far been provided within the study.
The propagation channel is stationary/close to stationary during the IQ
accumulation, so that coherent accumulation can be performed. This implies
that the _amplitudes_ of the signals are added, but the interfering
signal/noise are added in terms of their _powers_ , here the
interference/noise is represented by _n_. Assume further that a weight can be
put to the received signals when combined and that noise is limiting the
performance. This is shown in eq. 1.
{width="2.46875in" height="0.4791666666666667in"} (1)
The combined SINR is maximized when the derivative of eq 1 is 0.
{width="1.0in" height="0.4583333333333333in"} (2)
This gives the result in eq. 3.
{width="0.7708333333333334in" height="0.4895833333333333in"} (3)
Insertion into eq 1 yields eq 4.
{width="1.25in" height="0.4479166666666667in"} (4)
Hence, the maximization of SINR occurs when the linear SINRs are summarized.
It can be noted that for EC-GSM-IoT and coherent IQ accumulation, s~1~ and
s~2~ would be identical, and hence it is the ratio of interfering levels that
is of importance for the signal combinations.
Equation 4 is used to model the accumulation of IQ samples and/or soft bits
when using blind repetitions in the system level simulator.
The model in Figure 1 has been modified to describe this aspect in Figure 3.
{width="5.176388888888889in" height="2.217361111111111in"}
Figure ZF.4.2-3: SINR handling for MRC and blind repetition
#### ZF.4.2.3.2 MRC (uplink only)
Since the first stage mapping tables are based on single antenna performance,
a conversion from single antenna SINR to experienced SINR by the uplink MRC
receiver is needed.
This is modeled by eq. 5.
{width="1.375in" height="0.25in"} (5)
## ZF.4.3 Verification
The verification of the performance is only shown for UL sensitivity and
multi-interference performance (DTS-2, see 3GPP TS 45.005). Other verification
conditions can be found in the Tdoc reference, see subclause ZF.4.1.
### ZF.4.3.1 Sensitivity
In figure ZF.4.2-4 the link level simulation (LLS) results are compared to the
Link-to-system mapping approach. As can be seen, the agreement is good with a
difference of less than 0.4 dB.

verified. For the worst case, less than 0.5 dB difference is seen except for
MCS-4 where the difference is less than 1 dB.

spectrum allocation**
### ZF.5.1.1 Simulator configuration
The simulator was configured in accordance to the TR45.820 Annex D, and
following the assumptions presented in Annex ZF.1. In total four co-channel
interferers and eight adjacent channel interferers were modelled. As only
legacy GPRS devices were investigated the following new settings are worth
highlighting (see Annex ZF.1 for details behind the assumptions):
\- The MS antenna gain was set to 0 dBi .
\- Building penetration loss was turned off.
\- The cell radius was set to 2500 meter[^1], to reach a desired Maximum
Coupling Loss of 144 dB, or to 577 m to follow the agreed working assumptions
(see [2]).
\- For each configuration a full simulation with in total \~25 000
synchronization attempts from users spread out over the entire cell grid was
simulated.
\- The scenario modelled was a cell reconfirmation scenario, where stationary
devices e.g. after waking up from PSM or eDRX attempts to re-confirm its
earlier camped on cell. It was assumed that the earlier camped on cell
corresponds to the optimal cell from a path loss perspective.
\- Each device was configured to search during at most two 51-multiframes for
an FCCH and SCH combination to reconfirm the BSIC of the serving cell. If no
SCH was decoded successfully within this search time the attempt was
registered as a failure.
A BSIC plan was configured as elaborated in Annex ZF.3.
### ZF.5.1.2 Results
Figure 1 below depicts the total search time before SCH is decoded
successfully, i.e. when the device is synchronized, for 4/12, 3/9 and 1/3
reuse. Table ZF.5.1-1 presents the overall success rate and the 50^th^ and
99^th^ percentile times until synchronization is achieved.

Figure ZF.5.1-2 and figure ZF.5.1-3 depicts the residual frequency and time
offset after FCCH detection, for devices that successfully decoded the SCH. As
seen the impact from going to tighter frequency reuse with respect to residual
frequency and time offset is limited for these devices. It shall be noted that
the residual frequency and timing offset seen in figure ZF.5.1-2 and figure
ZF.5.1-3 represents the rough synchronization after FCCH only, and that
further refinements in both frequency and time estimation will be done when
acquiring the SCH.

Figure ZF.5.1-3: Synchronization frequency error after FCCH detection
During the search for the serving cell FCCH and SCH a device may detect the
FCCH from a neighboring cell and successfully decode its SCH and read the
BSIC. Figure ZF.5.1-4 depicts the likelihood of decoding neighboring cells SCH
and BSIC. Each device was configured to continue its search for the serving
cell SCH upon detecting that the decoded BSIC did not match the serving cell
BSIC. As a result a device may decode neighboring SCHs multiple times before
receiving the serving cell SCH and confirming its BSIC. This is illustrated in
the below figure for the three studied frequency reuses.
{width="3.50625in" height="2.7555555555555555in"}
Figure ZF.5.1-4: Likelihood of decoding the BSIC of a neighboring cell
In case a decoded neighboring SCH is configured with the same BSIC as the
serving cell a device will not detect that it has synchronized to new cell.
This unwanted event is known as BSIC confusion. A BSIC plan based on eight
unique BSICs was configured for each reuse. The BSIC plan for the 1/3
frequency reuse is illustrated in Annex ZF.2. Table 2 presents the likelihood
of BSIC confusion for each reuse. It can be concluded that even for this tight
BSIC plan, BSIC confusion is not an issue in case of stationary devices
attempting to reconfirm the serving cell.

Reuse 4/12 3/9 1/3 Likelihood of BSIC confusion 0% 0% \< 0.1%

The performance was also evaluated for a cell radius of 577 m. The results are
depicted in Table 3, and are comparable with the results seen for a cell
radius of 2500 m.

The likelihood of decoding the BSIC of a neighboring cell, and for BSIC
confusion, was more or less identical for cell radiuses of 577 and 2500 m.
### ZF.5.1.3 Discussion and conclusions
This contribution has investigated the impact on legacy (E)GPRS
synchronization performance in frequency reuse scenarios of 4/12, 3/9 and 1/3.
The performance is as expected similar for 4/12 and 3/9 reuse. A clear impact
on the total time to decode the SCH is seen when going to 1/3 reuse. The
performance is however convincing for all investigated reuses, and indicate
that legacy (E)GPRS device will be able to synchronize the a network also in
case of a tight BCCH spectrum allocation.

### ZF.5.2.2 Simulator configuration
The simulator was configured in accordance to the system simulation
assumptions agreed in 3GPP TR 45.820 Annex D, and following the assumptions
presented in Annex ZF.1 on interference modelling.
The scenario modelled was a cell reconfirmation scenario, where stationary
devices e.g. after waking up from PSM or eDRX attempts to re-confirm its
earlier camped on cell. It was assumed that the earlier camped on cell
corresponds to the optimal cell from a path loss perspective.
The FCCH detector used to derive the results for EC-GSM in TR 45.820 was re-
used during the simulations. The EC-SCH receiver did not rely on IQ combining,
but performed soft combining between successive blind physical layer
transmissions of the EC-SCH.
Each device was configured to search during at most twelve 51-multiframes for
an FCCH and EC-SCH combination. If no EC-SCH was decoded successfully within
this search time the attempt was registered as a failure. This is in line with
the assumptions used during earlier evaluations.
A BSIC plan was configured as elaborated upon in Annex ZF.2.
### ZF.5.2.3 Results
Only results from devices successfully synchronizing within twelve
51-multiframes were recorded, and are presented in the following. Table
ZF.5.2-1 lists the recorded successful synchronization ratio for the three
studied frequency reuses. A high success rate is observed for all scenarios,
and only a minor degradation is noticeable when going from 4/12 and 3/9 reuse
to 1/3 reuse. The 50^th^ and 99^th^ percentiles time until EC-SCH decoding,
i.e. completed synchronization is also presented in the table. It can be
observed that a reduced BCCH spectrum allocation impacts the synchronization
times.

Figure ZF.5.2-2 and figure ZF.5.2-3 depicts the residual frequency and time
offset after FCCH detection, for devices that successfully decoded the EC-SCH.
As seen the impact from going to tighter frequency reuse with respect to
residual frequency and timing error is very limited.

Figure ZF.5.2-3: Synchronization frequency error after FCCH detection
In addition to the limited impact it should also be noticed that the above
results were achieved already after the FCCH detection. Frequency and time
errors after EC-SCH decoding is expected to be even smaller than the results
depicted but were not recorded in this set of simulations.
During the search for the serving cell FCCH and EC-SCH a device may detect the
FCCH from a neighboring cell and successfully decode its EC-SCH and read the
BSIC. Figure ZF.5.2-4 depicts the likelihood of decoding neighboring cells EC-
SCH and BSIC. Each device was configured to continue its search for the
serving cell EC-SCH upon detecting that the decoded BSIC did not match the
serving cell BSIC. As a result a device may decode neighboring EC-SCHs
multiple times before receiving the serving cell EC-SCH and confirming its
BSIC. This is illustrated in the below figure for the three studied frequency
reuses.

Figure ZF.5.2-4: Likelihood of decoding the BSIC of a neighboring cell
In case a decoded neighboring EC**-** SCH is configured with the same BSIC as
the serving cell a device will not detect that it has synchronized to new
cell. This unwanted event is known as BSIC confusion. A BSIC plan based on
eight unique BSICs was configured for each reuse. The BSIC plan for the 1/3
frequency reuse is illustrated in Annex ZF.2. Table 2 presents the likelihood
of BSIC confusion for each reuse. It can be concluded that even for this tight
BSIC plan, BSIC confusion is not an issue in case of stationary devices
attempting to reconfirm the serving cell.

### ZF.5.2.4 Conclusions
This contribution has investigated the impact on EC-GSM-IoT synchronization
performance in frequency reuse scenarios of 4/12, 3/9 and 1/3. The performance
is as expected similar for 4/12 and 3/9 reuse. An impact on the ratio of
successful synchronization attempts as well as on the total time to decode the
EC-SCH is seen when going to 1/3 reuse. This indicates that a 1/3 frequency
reuse may prove challenging for EC-GSM-IoT Still, the 99^th^ percentile
synchronization time in case of 1/3 re-use is 1.4 sec implying that the system
is still operable at this tight re-use factor.

spectrum allocation**
### ZF.6.1.2 Assumptions
#### ZF.6.1.2.1 General
Applicable assumptions in Annex ZF.1 were followed in the simulations.
#### ZF.6.1.2.2 Network synchronization
The interference situation modeled by the simulation is limited to timeslot
synchronized network. This means AGCH / RACH channels are both interfered by
other CCCH channels, and PDTCH/PACCH interference in other cells.
#### ZF.6.1.2.3 BCCH Power Savings
BCCH power savings can be used to reduce interference on the BCCH frequency
layer. With tighter BCCH frequency re-use the importance of this functionality
increases. BCCH power savings can be used with various levels of reduction and
selections of what timeslots and channels it should be applied to. For the
simulator a simple implementation for BCCH PS was used with a reduction of 6
dB for 60% of the dummy bursts transmitted on the CCCH DL. I.e. no power
control was applied to Immediate Assignment messages. The choice not to down-
regulate all dummy bursts on the CCCH is to also include a more highly loaded
network where not only AGCH but also PCH would be transmitted (assumed to be
not power regulated).
#### ZF.6.1.3.4 Frequency planning
The frequency planning simulated have been based on regular re-use clusters in
a 4/12, 3/9, and 1/3 re-use.
### ZF.6.1.4 Simulations
#### ZF.6.1.4.1 Simulation assumptions
The system level simulation assumptions in Annex ZF.1 have been followed.
Other specific assumptions are shown in Table ZF.6.1.4.1.1-1.

### ZF.6.1.5 Results
The results presented are:
\- Resource Usage
\- Average amount of bursts used per user, including all transmissions per
system access attempt.
\- Common control signaling delay
\- The delay includes time from initial RACH transmission to a received
matching Immediate Assignment.
\- Failed attempts
\- This represents the percentage of the attempts that were not successful,
after the maximum attempts.
#### ZF.6.1.5.1 Resource Usage
The resource usage in terms of bursts is shown in Table ZF.6.1-2.
Table ZF.6.1-2: Resource Usage for the downlink and uplink, 33 dBm

BCCH\ Resource usage\ Resource usage\ Re-use DL [#bursts] UL [#bursts]
12 4.0 1.0
9 4.0 1.0
3 4.6 1.2
* * *
As can be seen, the difference between 12 and 9 re-use is not visible, while
the change from a 9 re-use factor to a 3 re-use factor has a clearly visible
impact on the results.
#### ZF.6.1.5.2 Common control channel delay
In Figure ZF.6.1-1the common control channel delay is shown. As can be seen,
95% of the users experience lower delay than 50 ms in all cases.

Figure ZF.6.1-1: Common Control Signaling Delay, 33 dBm
#### ZF.6.1.5.3 Failed Attempts
The overall failed attempts are in all simulations well below 0.1%, but to
avoid the risk of not running too long simulations to come up with a number
with enough statistical significance, it can safely be assumed that less than
0.1% of the system access attempts fail.
### ZF.6.1.6 Discussion
The paper has investigated the performance of the CCCH in a tight BCCH re-use
scenario. Frequency re-use factors from 12, 9 and 3 has been investigated
using a regular frequency re-use cluster deployment.
BCCH power savings has been applied, but only on dummy bursts transmitted on
the CCCH, and down-regulation has only been allowed in 60% of the bursts. This
is to model a higher load on the CCCH, considering also for example PCH
traffic would be present in a real network deployment.
### ZF.6.1.7 Conclusions
The paper has investigated the impact on the CCCH in a tight BCCH spectrum.
The results are encouraging showing extremely low failed rates even in a very
tight re-use pattern. The resource usage is increased by roughly 20% when
going from 12 to 3 in frequency re-use. The overall common control signaling
delay is slightly increased, as expected, but still the 95 percentile is
around 50 ms for all cases

### ZF.6.2.2 Assumptions
#### ZF.6.2.2.1 Link model
The link level model used in the simulator is described in Annex ZF3.
#### ZF.6.2.2.2 Blind transmissions
The blind transmissions used in the simulations are those used in 3GPP TS
45.003 see table ZF.6.2-1.

#### ZF.6.2.2.3 Network synchronization
The interference situation modeled by the simulation is limited to timeslot
synchronized network. This means EC-AGCH / EC-RACH channels are both
interfered by other EC-CCCH channels, and EC-PDTCH/EC-PACCH interference in
other cells.
#### ZF.6.2.2.4 Coverage class adaptation
Coverage class adaptation has been applied as described in 3GPP TS 44.018 with
two failed attempts before adaptation of the coverage class is allowed. At
most two increments in CC from the initially estimated class are allowed.
#### ZF.6.2.2.5 BCCH Power Savings
BCCH power savings can be used to reduce interference on the BCCH frequency
layer. With tighter BCCH frequency re-use the importance of this functionality
increases. BCCH power savings can be used with various levels of reduction and
selections of what timeslots and channels it should be applied to. For the
simulator a simple implementation for BCCH PS was used with a reduction of 6
dB for 60% of the dummy bursts transmitted on the EC-CCCH DL. I.e. no power
control was applied to Immediate Assignment messages. The choice not to down-
regulate all dummy bursts on the EC-CCCH is to also include a more highly
loaded network where not only EC-AGCH but also EC-PCH would be transmitted
(assumed to be not power regulated).
#### ZF.6.2.2.6 Frequency planning
The frequency planning simulated have been based on regular re-use clusters in
a 4/12, 3/9, and 1/3 re-use.

### ZF.6.2.4 Results
#### ZF.6.2.4.1 General
The results presented are:
\- Resource Usage
\- Average amount of bursts used per user, including all transmissions per
system access attempt.
\- % of total resources available used on one TS where EC-CCCH is mapped
\- Common control signaling delay
\- The delay includes time from initial EC-RACH transmission to a received
matching Immediate Assignment.
\- Failed attempts
\- This represents the percentage of the attempts that were not successful,
after the maximum attempts.
\- Coverage class distribution
\- This shows the % of devices ending up in different coverage classes for 33
dBm and 23 dBm devices respectively, with the coverage class thresholds used
in the simulations for the respective frequency re-use factor.
#### ZF.6.2.4.2 Resource Usage
The resource usage in terms of bursts is shown in table ZF.6.2-3 and table
ZF.6.2-4.
Table ZF.6.2-3: Resource Usage for the downlink and uplink, 33 dBm
* * *
BCCH\ Resource usage\ Resource usage\ Re-use DL [#bursts] UL [#bursts]
12 2.3 1.1
9 2.3 1.1
3 3.3 1.3
* * *
Table ZF.6.2-4: Resource Usage for the downlink and uplink, 23 dBm
* * *
BCCH\ Resource usage\ Resource usage\ Re-use DL [#bursts] UL [#bursts]
12 2.3 1.7
9 2.3 1.8
3 3.3 2.6
* * *
As can be seen, the difference between 12 and 9 re-use is quite small, or not
visible, while the change from a 9 re-use factor to a 3 re-use factor has a
rather large relative impact on the results on the DL, and for 23 dBm devices
on the UL. The reason that the resource usage is increased on the DL is due to
the BCCH layer transmitting constantly on all resources. Using power savings
on the BCCH layer up to 6 dB helps, but the overall interference situation
still reflects a rather highly loaded system. On the UL, the requirement on
constant transmission does not exist, but for 23 dBm devices, more would have
to use repetitions to reach the network, which increases resources usage.
Still, it should be noted that the out of coverage level is not different for
33 dBm devices and 23 dBm devices, implying that 23 dBm devices can cope with
the network deployment, even if resource usage is significantly increased
compared to the 33 dBm device deployment.
In table ZF.6.2-5 and table ZF.6.2-6 the same figures are shown expressed as
percent of total resources available on one TS EC-CCCH (in total up to 36
bursts out of the 51 in the multiframe can be used for EC-AGCH).
For example, for a resources usage of 2.3 bursts, and with an arrival rate of
6.8 users/s, the total number of bursts used for EC-AGCH per second is on
average 15.64, and hence the percent of EC-CCCH resources used is
15.64/(13/3.060*36) = 10.2%.
Table ZF.6.2-5: % of total resource for EC-CCCH occupied, 33 dBm
* * *
BCCH\ Resource usage\ Resource usage\ Re-use DL [#bursts] UL [#bursts][^2]
12 10.2% 3.5%
9 10.2% 3.5%
3 14.7% 4.1%
* * *
Table ZF.6.2-6: % of total resource for EC-CCCH occupied, 23 dBm
* * *
BCCH\ Resource usage\ Resource usage\ Re-use DL [#bursts] UL [#bursts]
12 10.2% 5.3%
9 10.2% 5.6%
3 14.7% 8.2%
* * *
It can be seen that there is somewhat higher load on the DL EC-CCCH resources
than on the UL. Also, EC-PCH load will add to the overall EC-CCCH/DL load.
Still, the load visible is at rather moderate levels, and considering the EC-
RACH channel being of slotted ALOHA design, an as high resource usage as on
the DL would not be expected in a well operated system. Also, there will be
collisions on the EC-RACH channel, which is not taken into account by the
calculations above. Hence, if determining the amount of resources being
occupied by one or more access bursts, the figures in the table above would be
lower than presented.
#### ZF.6.2.4.3 Common control channel delay
In figure ZF.6.2-1 the delay seen on the common control channel is presented
for both simulated cases of 100% 33 dBm MS penetration and 100% 23 dBm MS
penetration. As can be seen, 95% of the users experience lower delay than 100
ms in all cases, except for 3-re-use where the 95 percentile is around 500 ms.
The reason for the longer delay in the 23 dBm case is that these MS are
generally in higher CCs to compensate for the reduced output power, which
implies longer transmission times and response waiting times. Also, in these
simulations, even if 23 dBm devices are placed at higher CL than 154 dB, they
have not been excluded from the simulations, which implies that they could
take up a proportionally higher amount of resources, and also contribute to a
proportionally higher delay than if excluded from network access.

#### ZF.6.2.4.4 Failed Attempts
The overall failed attempts are in all simulations well below 0.1%, but to
avoid the risk of not running too long simulations to come up with a number
with enough statistical significance, it can safely be assumed that less than
0.1% of the system access attempts fail.

### ZF.6.2.5 Discussion
The paper has investigated the performance of the EC-CCCH in a tight BCCH re-
use scenario. Frequency re-use factors from 12, 9 and 3 has been investigated
using a regular frequency re-use cluster deployment.
One can note from the results that the failed rate is extremely low,
indicating that a more aggressive system setting in specifically the CC
thresholds could be applied resulting in less resources used by the EC-CCCH.
BCCH power savings has been applied, but only on dummy bursts transmitted on
the EC-CCCH, and down-regulation has only been allowed in 60% of the bursts.
This is to model a higher load on the EC-CCCH, considering also for example
EC-PCH traffic would be present in a real network deployment.
The simulations have assumed a timeslot synchronized network meaning that EC-
PDTCH and EC-PACCH, as well as, EC-CCCH interfering signals are modeled. The
load on EC-PDTCH and EC-PACCH is aligned with what is seen in Annex ZF.7.
### ZF.6.2.6 Conclusions
The paper has investigated the impact on the EC-CCCH in a tight BCCH spectrum.
The results are encouraging showing extremely low failed rates even in a very
tight re-use pattern. The resource usage is increased by roughly 40% when
going from 12 to 3 in frequency re-use. The overall common control signaling
delay is increased, as expected, but still the 95 percentile is around 0.1 sec
for all cases, except for re-use 3 where the 95 percentile delay increase to
0.5 s.

### ZF.7.1.2 Assumptions
#### ZF.7.1.2.1 Traffic generation
MTC traffic is generated according to \'Global traffic model for MTC traffic
of legacy GPRS\', see Annex ZF.1. It could be noted that with the aggressive
model approach chosen, the load in the network will increase compared to the
IoT model previously used in the study by around 40 % on the UL.
#### ZF.7.1.2.2 RACH interference
Interference from RACH has been modelled. The power reduction on RACH
introduced in GERAN Rel-11 is assumed not to be supported by the MSs, and
hence full power is used on the RACH channel.
#### ZF.7.1.2.3 BCCH Power Savings
BCCH power savings can be used to reduce interference on the BCCH frequency
layer. With tighter BCCH frequency re-use the importance of this functionality
increases. BCCH power savings can be used with various levels of reduction and
selections of what timeslots and channels it should be applied to. For
simulator implementation, a simple implementation for BCCH power savings was
used with a reduction of 6 dB for timeslots not used for PDTCH or PACCH. In
case PDTCH or PACCH are used on the DL, no power regulation is used. Timeslots
TS0 (carrying BCCH, FCCH, SCH, CCCH) and TS1 (carrying EC-BCCH, EC-CCCH, EC-
SCH) are excluded from BCCH Power Savings.
### ZF.7.1.3 Simulations
#### ZF.7.1.3.1 Simulation assumptions
The system level simulation assumptions in Annex ZF.1 have been followed.
Other specific assumptions are shown in Table ZF.7.1-1.

##### ZF.7.1.3.1.2 Cell selection and coding scheme selection
Cell selection was based on the calculated path gain and a N(0,2) dB
measurement error. All devices are stationary in the simulations so there will
be no cell re-selection.
In the simulations, no link adaptation was used. Instead, the coding scheme
was always selected to CS-1 and remained the same throughout the duration of
the TBF.
##### ZF.7.1.3.1.3 Control signaling
Packet uplink ACK/NACK (PUAN) is sent on PACCH/D to (negatively) acknowledge
data sent in the UL, as well as Packet downlink ACK/NACK (PDAN) sent on
PACCH/U to (negatively) acknowledge data sent on the DL. In the simulations
its performance is modeled with EGPRS MCS-1. If a PUAN/PDAN is unsuccessfully
received, the negative acknowledged blocks will not be transmitted. In the UL
this means that the allocated MS will not transmit anything, but the radio
block resources are consumed, and, on the DL the BTS will not be able to
schedule retransmissions.
##### ZF.7.1.3.1.4 Simulated scenarios
Table ZF.7.1-2 summarizes the simulated scenarios and clarifies the legends in
the figures presented in section ZF.7.1.4.2. No explicit frequency planning
effort has been made and the simulations only use regular repeatable cluster

i.e. did not manage to get the report through during 20 seconds.
\- Capacity (section ZF.7.1.3.2.5)
\- Capacity is defined as \"spectral efficiency in number of reports/200
kHz/hour\". Results are shown in Table ZF.7.1-5.
##### ZF.7.1.3.2.1 Time Slot Usage
The TS Usage is shown in Table ZF.7.1-3 for the downlink and uplink
respectively. On the downlink, the TS Usage increases with roughly 12% from
0.26 to 0.29 when the re-use is changed from 9 to 3, and on the UL with 2%.
Table ZF.7.1-3: TS Usage for the downlink and uplink
* * *
BCCH\ TS usage DL [#TS] TS usage UL [#TS] Re-use
12 0.26 0.89
9 0.26 0.89
3 0.29 0.91
* * *
For the uplink, the TS Utilization also increases only marginally from 0.89 to
0.91 when the re-use is changed from 9 to 3.
##### ZF.7.1.3.2.2 Latency of Uplink Transmissions
The latency of Uplink transmissions is represented by the latency of the data
transfer, i.e. the common control signaling delay is not included. A few users
will experience an increased delay as seen in Figure ZF.7.1-1. The delays are
increasing with tighter frequency re-use.

Figure ZF.7.1-1: Uplink Transmission Delay
The \"knees\" in the distribution are due to the three different packet sizes
used in the traffic model. In the figure only the impact from the two biggest
packet sizes can be seen, but there is also a small \"knee\" just below 30%
for the smallest packet size.
##### ZF.7.1.3.2.3 Latency of Downlink Transmissions
A few users will experience an increased delay as seen in Figure ZF.7.1-2.
Also in this case, the delay is increased with tighter frequency re-use.

##### ZF.7.1.3.2.4 Failed Attempts
At the traffic load 5.4 events per cell and second, the percentage of failed
attempts (i.e., the report did not get delivered within 20 seconds) is found
to be 0 % in the 12, 9 and 3 re-use scenarios. Failed attempts are shown in
Table ZF.7.1-4.

##### ZF.7.1.3.2.5 Capacity
In 3GPP TR 45.820 the capacity is defined as \"spectral efficiency in number
of reports/200 kHz/hour\". This definition is made with a standalone CIoT
system in mind. The system in this evaluation serves only one traffic type
(MTC traffic), but the event intensities and packet sizes differ on the
downlink and uplink. On the downlink all packet sizes are the same (45 bytes),
and have the intensity of 1.4 reports per sector and second. On the uplink the
packet sizes are \'randomly\' picked from 40, 150 or 1200 bytes and have the
intensity of 3 reports per sector and second. Due to the mix of packet sizes
and different intensities on uplink and downlink the capacity definition may
be less meaningful, but anyway an attempt has been made to present the
capacity for the combined intensity of 5.4 reports per sector and second. It
should be noted that the measure is not really a capacity measure since it
does not reflect the capacity limit of the system but rather at an assumed
fixed load.
Capacity is here calculated as
(#sent reports per sector per hour)*(1 - failed attempts)/reuse
The capacity is shown in Table ZF.7.1-5 for the simulated scenarios.
Table ZF.7.1-5: Capacity
+--------+-------------------------+ | BCCH | Capacity | | | | | Re-use | [reports/200kHz/hour] | +--------+-------------------------+ | 12 | 1620 | +--------+-------------------------+ | 9 | 2160 | +--------+-------------------------+ | 3 | 6480 | +--------+-------------------------+
As can be seen from the table, the 3-reuse scenario has three times higher
capacity than the 9-reuse scenario, as expected considering the change in re-
use factor, and the fact that no reports fails to be delivered.
### ZF.7.1.4 Discussion and conclusions
This paper shows that legacy MTC services may be accommodated on as low BCCH
spectrum allocations as 600 kHz with a very marginal increase in TS
utilization compared to 1.8 MHz. The transmission delays are increased for
some devices; the effect is however rather small compared to the 67% reduction
of the required frequency spectrum, corresponding to three times the spectral
efficiency. For the 600 kHz spectrum allocation, the network interference
levels may need to be controlled by efficient GPRS/EGPRS MS power control
settings and BCCH Power Savings.
## ZF.7.2 EC-GSM-IoT
### ZF.7.2.1 Assumptions
#### ZF.7.2.1.1 Traffic generation
MTC traffic is generated according to the MAR periodic reporting and Network
Command traffic models in 3GPP TR 45.820. The split between these is 80 % MAR
periodic and 20 % Network command.
#### ZF.7.2.1.2 EC-RACH interference
Interference from EC-RACH without power control has been modelled.
#### ZF.7.2.1.3 BCCH Power Savings
BCCH power savings can be used to reduce interference on the BCCH frequency
layer. With tighter BCCH frequency re-use the importance of this functionality
increases. BCCH power savings can be used with various levels of reduction and
selections of what timeslots and channels it should be applied to. For
simulator implementation a simple implementation for BCCH PS was used with a
reduction of 6 dB for timeslots not used for EC-PDTCH or EC-PACCH.
#### ZF.7.2.1.4 Uplink Power Backoff
A power backoff of maximum 4 dB is used on EC-PDTCH and EC-PACCH in uplink.
This power regulation is based on signal strength measurements. It is worth to
note the following:
\- The applied model follows the information provided in the EC-EGPRS CHANNEL
REQUEST, see 3GPP TS 44.018.
### ZF.7.2.2 Simulations
#### ZF.7.2.2.1 Simulation assumptions
The system level simulation assumptions in Annex ZF.1 have been followed.
Other specific assumptions are shown in Table ZF.7.2‑1.

##### ZF.7.2.2.1.2 Cell selection and uplink coverage class selection
Cell selection and uplink coverage class selection was based on carrier
measurements according to the simulator model in Annex ZF.9 taking 5 samples
per measured cell over 5 seconds.
No cell re-selection has been modeled. The users arrive in the system, perform
measurements in idle mode to select a cell to camp on, and then connect to the
network. As per the EC-GSM-IoT specification, no measurements for cell
reselection are performed in packet transfer mode (PTM), and consequently no
cell reselection is performed in PTM.
##### ZF.7.2.2.1.3 Downlink coverage class selection and coding scheme
selection
Downlink coverage class selection was based on either SINR or carrier
measurements according to the model in Annex ZF.9 taking 5 samples per
measured cell over 5 seconds. The BT_Threshold_DL and X used for the
simulations are reported in Table ZF.7.2‑2.
Table ZF.7.2-2: BT_Threshold_DL and X for Carrier and SINR CC DL.
+-------------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+--------+ | BCCH re-use | Carrier CC DL | SINR CC DL | | | +-------------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+--------+ | | BT_Threshold_DL | X | BT_Threshold_UL | X | | | | | | | | | [dBm] | [dB] | [dB] | [dB] | +-------------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+--------+ | 4/12 re-use | -103 | 6 | 9 | 3 | +-------------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+--------+ | 3/9 re-use | -101 | 6 | 9 | 3 | +-------------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+--------+ | 1/3 re-use | -92 | 6 | 9 | 3 | +-------------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+--------+
In the simulations no link adaptation was used. Instead the coding scheme was
intially selected to MCS-1, MCS-2, MCS-3 or MCS-4 depending on the measured
SINR or carrier value reported in the EC-EGPRS CHANNEL REQUEST by the MS, see
3GPP TS 44.018, and remained the same throughout the duration of the EC TBF.
The MCS choice for carrier based and SINR based downlink coverage class
selection are reported in Table ZF.7.2‑3 and Table ZF.7.2‑4 respectively and
are based on the \"DL Coverage Class\" field reported by the MS in the channel
request. This is a 3-bit field and hence 8 different code points can be
communicated. The code points for the DL Coverage Class field are referred to
as \"CC CP\".

selection.

##### ZF.7.2.2.1.4 Control signaling
Packet uplink ACK/NACK (PUAN) is sent on EC-PACCH/D to (negatively)
acknowledge data sent in the UL and assign fixed allocations to the MS. If a
PUAN is unsuccessfully received the negative acknowledged blocks will not be
transmitted, i.e. the allocated MS will not transmit anything, but the radio
block resources are consumed and logged as such, contributing to the overall
resource usage.
Packet downlink ACK/NACK (PDAN) is sent on EC-PACCH/U to (negatively)
acknowledge data sent in the DL.
EC-PACCH specific Link to System mappings has been used for EC-PACCH/D and EC-
PACCH/U.
##### ZF.7.2.2.1.5 Simulated scenarios
The simulated scenarios are for downlink coverage class selection based on
measured SINR and carrier signal strength for 4/12, 3/9 and 1/3 re-use, and
tables and figures are presented in section ZF.7.2.3.2. The thresholds and the
coverage class code point dependent DL MCS choice both for the SINR and
carrier scenarios have been optimized to give low timeslot utilization, short
delay and high capacity while aiming for an EC-PDTCH DL BLER target of 20 %
for MCS-1 in order to ensure robustness of the system. For higher MCSs a
higher BLER has been allowed, considering that the RCL/MAC header would still
experience a low BLER level at the SINR where the higher MCSs are used.
#### ZF.7.2.2.2 Results
The results presented are:
\- Resource (TS) Usage (section ZF.7.2.3.2.1)
\- This represents the average amount of EC-PDTCH DL and UL TS resources
required on average per cell in the system, for the different scenarios, see
Table ZF.7.2‑5.
\- Latency of MAR periodic reports (section ZF.7.2.3.2.2)
\- The latency includes time to transfer the message excluding common control
signaling delay (presented in a separate evaluation, see Annex ZF.3).
\- The results are presented as CDFs of the delay at the target traffic load
(6.81 users per cell and second).
\- Failed attempts are not included in the statistics (following the agreed
methodology).
\- Latency of DL application Ack (section ZF.7.2.3.2.3)
\- Latency is measured from the time an application layer DL ACK is received
at the base station till the time when the device has successfully received
the application layer DL ACK
\- The results are presented as CDFs of the delay at the target traffic load
(6.8 users per cell and second).
\- Failed attempts (section ZF.7.2.3.2.4)
\- This represents the percentage of the attempts that were not successful,
i.e. did not manage to get the report through during 20 seconds.
\- Uplink capacity (section ZF.7.2.3.2.5)
\- Uplink capacity is defined as \"spectral efficiency in number of
reports/200 kHz/hour\". Results are shown in Table ZF.7.2‑6.
##### ZF.7.2.2.2.1 TS Usage
The TS Usage is shown in Table ZF.7.2‑5 for the downlink and uplink. On the
downlink, the TS Usage increases from 0.35 TS to 0.70 TS for SINR based
downlink coverage class selection and to 0.77 TS for carrier based downlink
coverage class when the reuse is changed from 4/12 to 1/3. Thus, the timeslot
utilization increases approximately 2.0 times for SINR and 2.2 times for
carrier based downlink coverage class selection while the used frequency
bandwidth is reduced four times.
Table ZF7.2-5: PDCH resource usage for EC-GSM-IoT on the downlink and uplink,
33 / 23 dBm
* * *
BCCH\ Resource usage\ Resource usage\  
Re-use DL [#TS] UL [#TS]
           **SINR CC DL**    **Carrier CC DL**   **SINR CC DL**   **Carrier CC DL**
12 0.35 / 0.35 0.35 / 0.36 0.85 / 1.60 0.84 / 1.59
9 0.37 / 0.37 0.37 / 0.38 0.85 / 1.59 0.85 / 1.60
3 0.70 / 0.68 0.75 / 0.73 0.91 / 1.69 0.92 / 1.68
* * *
It can be noted that the resource increase for the carrier based CC selection
is mainly due to more conservative settings (see Table ZF.7.2‑2) when
switching between coverage classes with the aim to roughly operate in the same
BLER region irrespective of re-use. Generally it applies that the tighter the
re-use the more interference in the system, the more conservative the coverage
class thresholds (to lower operative BLER points by using blind
transmissions), and the more resources are used. For SINR the same thresholds
are used in all simulations (see Table ZF.7.2‑2) which will shift the coverage
class distribution to more users in CC2 and above, when increasing the
interference levels in the system (going to a tighter re-use).
Further, it can be noted that carrier based downlink coverage class selection
gives approximately 7 % higher downlink TS usage than SINR based downlink
coverage class selection in 1/3 re-use. This is however not the only benefit
seen, as will be seen below. In actuality there is a trade-off between all
metrics presented in this paper, e.g. a lower resource usage would have an
impact on latency, CC distribution and failed attempts. All output need to be
analyzed jointly.
##### ZF.7.2.2.2.2 Latency of MAR periodic reports
The latency of MAR periodic reports is represented by the latency of the data
transfer, i.e. the common control signaling delay is not included. A few users
will experience an increased delay as seen in Figure ZF.7.2-1. The delays are
increasing with tighter frequency re-use.

##### ZF.7.2.2.2.3 Latency of Downlink Application Ack
A few users will experience an increased Downlink Application Ack delay when
going to tighter re-use as seen in Figure ZF.7.2‑2. It can be noted that the
Downlink Application Ack delay for 3/9 and 4/12 re-use is almost the same for
the two downlink coverage class selection cases. However, for 1/3 re-use the
delay is larger with carrier based selection compared to the SINR based
selection.

(right)
##### ZF.7.2.2.2.4 Failed Attempts
At the traffic load 6.8 users per cell and second and device output power of
33 dBm, the percentage of failed attempts (i.e., the report did not get
delivered within 20 seconds) is found to be less than 0.1 % in all scenarios.
##### ZF.7.2.2.2.5 Capacity
In 3GPP TR 45.820 capacity is defined as \"spectral efficiency in number of
reports/200 kHz/hour\". This definition is made with a standalone CIoT system
in mind. Since the system in this evaluation serves only one traffic type (MTC
traffic), the capacity definition is more meaningful in this case than in the
previous EC-GSM-IoT investigations in which mixed services were assumed. Still
it should be noted that the measure is not really a capacity measure since it
does not reflect the capacity limit of the system but rather at an assumed
fixed load.
Capacity is here calculated as
(#sent reports per sector per hour)*(1 - failed attempts)/reuse
The capacity is shown in Table ZF.7.2‑6 for the simulated scenarios.
Table ZF.7.2-6: Capacity for EC-GSM-IoT at 6.81 users per cell and second
+--------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | BCCH\ | Capacity for | Capacity for | | | | Re-use | 33 dBm | 23 dBm | | | | | devices | devices | | | | | | | | | | | [reports/2 | [reports/2 | | | | | 00kHz/hour] | 00kHz/hour] | | | +--------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | | **SINR CC |** Carrier CC | **SINR CC |** Carrier CC | | | DL**| DL** | DL**| DL** | +--------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 12 | 2038 | 2038 | 2055 | 2055 | +--------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 9 | 2724 | 2725 | 2738 | 2738 | +--------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 3 | 8150 | 8150 | 8220 | 8219 | +--------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
As can be seen from the table, the 3-reuse scenario has four times capacity
than the 12-reuse scenario, as expected considering the change in re-use
factor, and the fact that almost no reports fails to be delivered. The
capacity for the 23 dBm is a little higher than the capacity for the 33 dBm
case and even higher than the theoretical capacity of 8172 for 6.81 users per
cell and second due to randomization.
#### ZF.7.2.2.3 DL and UL Coverage Class Distribution
Table ZF.7.2‑7 and Table ZF.7.2‑8 summarizes the DL and UL CC distribution for
the 4/12 and 1/3 re-use scenarios for both measured SINR and Carrier
thresholds. Approximately 98 % and 97 % of all mobiles uses coverage class 1
in downlink for the 4/12 re-use and 3/9 re-use scenarios respectively. For 1/3
re-use only 79 % for SINR based and 87 % for carrier based downlink coverage
class selection of all mobiles uses coverage class 1 in downlink.
Approximately 98 % and 84 % of all 33 dBm and 23 dBm mobiles respectively uses
coverage class 1 in uplink irrespective of the re-use.

### ZF.7.2.3 Discussion and conclusions
#### ZF.7.2.3.1 Impact from frequency re-use
This paper adds simulation results for 1/3 re-use and shows that EC-GSM-IoT
MTC services may be accommodated on the PDCH of a single BCCH carrier network
on as low BCCH spectrum allocations as 600 kHz. For 600 kHz there is less than
2.2 times increase in Downlink TS utilization compared to 2.4 MHz. The
transmission delays are increased when going to a tighter re-use. The effect
is however rather moderate compared to the 75% reduction of the required
frequency spectrum, corresponding to four times the spectral efficiency.
Failed rates are in all scenarios kept at a low level.
#### ZF.7.2.3.2 SINR vs carrier based measurements
##### ZF.7.2.3.2.1 General
This paper also compares performance between SINR based and carrier signal
strength based downlink coverage class selection methods. It shows that
downlink coverage class selection based on SINR has more potential than signal
strength measurements, specifically in the 1/3 re-use. For 4/12 re-use the
downlink TS utilization is the same for both selection methods, but also here
there is a visible difference in the delay of the DL delivered reports. For
1/3 re-use, carrier based downlink coverage class selection gives
approximately 7 % higher downlink TS utilization compared to SINR based
downlink coverage class selection.
It should be mentioned that carrier based measurements and SINR based
measurements need to be compared taking the full system impact into account.
The coverage class settings will be different, and influence how devices
behave in the network. Hence, all metrics investigated will be influenced when
changing the CC selection method.
##### ZF.7.2.3.2.2 Coverage class distribution
The main intention to go from carrier based measurements to SINR based
measurements is to get a more accurate CC selection that better reflects the
experienced SINR when transmitting the block (although the measurement to base
the SINR CC selection on is taken at another point in time). In contrast, for
carrier based selection, the selection will not take interference into
account, and hence the thresholds need to be set more conservatively (more
users in higher CC) when interference is increased in order to keep the
timeslot utilization and delays low.
In Figure ZF.7.2‑3 and Figure ZF.7.2‑6 the coverage class distribution between
carrier based and SINR based measurements are shown. As can be seen in Figure
ZF.7.2‑3 and Figure ZF.7.2‑6 the downlink coverage class and coverage class
code point distribution over experienced SINR is much wider for carrier
measurement based than SINR measurement based downlink coverage class
selection. That means that more mobiles will make a better downlink coverage
class selection if SINR measurement based downlink coverage class selection is
used.
It can be noted that for carrier measurements approximately 10 % of the
mobiles experiencing a downlink SINR of only 0 dB will flag the highest
coverage class code point 7.
It can also be noted that the width at half height for the distribution of
coverage class code point 3 to 6 is approximately 7 to 8 dB for SINR
measurements.

##### ZF.7.2.3.2.3 BLER
To understand the system behavior it is of interest to look at the BLER
performance. One way to look at it is to investigate the BLER at different
coupling loss. At high coupling loss close to the coverage limit, both C based
selection and SINR based selection will use higher CCs (for C based selection
a MS will estimate itself to be below BT_Threshold_DL, and for SINR based
selection, the SINR will be low enough even without added interference).
However, for lower coupling loss ranges, a difference is expected, depending
on the coverage class threshold settings for the different approaches. In
Figure ZF.7.2‑5 the BLER versus Coupling Loss is shown at Coupling Loss 100 to
140 dB. As can be seen, even with a lower resource usage (as shown in Table
ZF.7.2‑5) for SINR based selection, the BLER is significantly lower compared
to the C based selection.
{width="3.7090277777777776in" height="2.7819444444444446in"}
Figure ZF.7.2-5: Average downlink BLER vs Coupling Loss for 33 dBm
One can see that the BLER level is for some coupling losses higher than the
aimed for 20 %. However, in these regions MCS-4 can have been used, where the
RLC/MAC header still would have a low BLER, and IR could be used (although not
activated in the simulations). For SINR based selection, the BLER is low due
to the limited MCSs usage (maximum MCS-4) and the limitation in power down-
regulation on the BCCH carrier (max 6 dB). Hence, even if 8PSK MCSs have not
been used in the simulations (MCS-5-9) the simulations show a potential of
using these to minimize resource usage in the network and improve spectral
efficiency also reducing resource usage further.
### ZF.7.2.4 Conclusion
EC-GSM-IoT MTC services may be accommodated on the PDCH of a single BCCH
carrier network on as low BCCH spectrum allocations as 600 kHz.
Downlink coverage class selection based on SINR has more potential than signal
strength measurements, specifically in the 1/3 re-use. It gives lower downlink
timeslot utilization and lower delays thanks to increased probability to
choose a coverage class and MCS that matches the experienced SINR.

**Title: Traffic model for legacy GPRS MTC**
## ZF.8.2 Legacy GRPS MTC uses cases and scenarios
Legacy GPRS, since the early years of M2M, is the most used access network for
Machine to Machine application. As a consequence the number and the diversity
of applications generating MTC traffic in a GSM/GPRS network is extremely
large, even if they often imply only a very limited number of UE. Therefore,
building a traffic model for all of them so that they can be taken into
account in a generic MTC traffic model for legacy GPRS is seen as impossible.
This is the reason why the approach proposed in this document is rather to
identify a limited set of representative application and uses cases that will
be or are already typically operating over a GSM/GPRS network on a large
scale, and to model them in a rather extreme situation. The resulting over-
estimation is expected to reflect applications and use cases that weren\'t
considered.
The set of considered use cases and the related parameters are summarized in
Table 1. It includes:
\- Pay as you drive
\- Bike fleet management : This model reflect the use case of asset tracking
\- Coffee Machine :This model reflect the use case of a remotely managed
electrical appliance
\- Smart-Grid:
\- Reading: classical remote meter reading, adapted to electric metering
\- Load monitoring: in addition to metering, utility usually retrieve
statistical data on the daily electrical consumption to improve production
management.
Deployment hypotheses are those considered in 3GPP TR 45.820 [1]. Consequently
the inter-site distance is 1732 meters, leading to cell area of 0,866 km^2^.
The number of UE has been calculated for this cell area and on the basis of
the city of Paris which is a very dense city and with the hypothesis that all
of the devices are served by a single PLMN having 100% market share.

## ZF.8.3 Aggregated traffic model of MTC over Legacy GPRS
The aforementioned per application traffic models are then aggregated to
obtain a global traffic model for MTC traffic over legacy GPRS that could be
used as a unique traffic model for MTC traffic over legacy GPRS.
For the uplink, there is a large variation in the packet sizes between the per
application models. In the aggregate model, the uplink packet size is
therefore randomly picked among the packet sizes of the different per
application traffic models. For the downlink, the packet sizes of the per
application traffic models are more similar. Therefore, the downlink packet
size is assumed to be fixed (always using the worst case packet size).
For simplicity, it is assumed that uplink and downlink packets are sent
independently.
Resulting parameters for this traffic model are given in table ZF.8-2.

**Title: Received signal level measurements for EC-EGPRS (update of
GP-151135)**
## ZF.9.2 Model
In EC-GSM-IoT the MS measures the wanted received signal level on the FCCH
and/or EC-SCH. To average out fast fading, the MS should take several (e.g. 5)
measurement samples spread out in time (e.g. over 5 s). Further, SINR
estimation is discussed above as an alternative or complement to signal level
estimation.
When studying EC-EGPRS performance in tight reuse networks, WA9.2 of Annex
ZF.1states that \"Cell reselection shall be based on realistic models of
neighbor cell measurements in idle mode [...]\". Therefore, when modeling cell
re-selection in system simulations for tight reuse networks, the measurement
procedure of the MS should be accurately modelled. Since fast fading is
typically modelled in the system simulator, the averaging across multiple
samples spaced in time can be directly implemented. However, for the first
step of taking measurement samples on the EC-SCH, the measurement inaccuracy
needs to be taken into account in order not to overestimate the performance of
cell re-selection. Unless the system simulator models the signals on I/Q
sample level, a statistical measurement inaccuracy model is needed.
The proposed model is as follows:
\- For each measurement sample taken on one instance of the EC-SCH (up to 7
EC-SCH bursts)
\- Calculate the true wanted signal level and true SINR
\- Add a random measurement error to the true wanted signal level, with a
distribution depending on the true SINR
\- Average (e.g.) 5 measurement samples over time (e.g. 5 s).
To derive a statistical distribution for the measurement inaccuracy in 1b,
link simulations have been run. For each measurement (done as described in
section 4.2 above), the true SINR and the estimated wanted signal level are
logged. From this, the error distribution at each given instantaneous true
wanted signal level is derived.
## ZF.9.3 Noise-limited case
Distributions (PDFs) of the wanted signal level estimation error are shown in
Figure ZF.9-1 for different true SINRs (-15 dB, -5 dB and 0 dB) and different
number of EC-SCH burst pairs used for signal level estimation (1 and 6). For
comparison, a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as
the estimation error is shown.

(top), -5 dB (middle) and 0 dB (bottom), respectively. Either 1 correlation
pair (left) or 6 correlation pairs (right) have been used.
It can be seen that the estimation error is reasonably accurately modelled by
a normal distribution.
The mean and standard deviation of the wanted signal level estimation error is
shown in figure ZF.9-2.

SINR. Noise-limited case.
For SINR estimation, the SINR is calculated from wanted signal level and total
signal level (see section 3). The total signal level estimation can be assumed
to be error-free.
## ZF.9.4 Interference-limited case
The wanted signal level estimation error was found to be approximately normal
distributed also in the interference limited case (not shown here). The mean
and standard deviation of the wanted signal level estimation error is shown in
figure ZF.9-3

Figure ZF.9-3: Mean and standard deviation of estimation error versus true
SINR. Interference-limited case.
## ZF.9.5 Discussion and conclusions
General principles of signal level estimation for EC-GSM-IoT have been
outlined. The use of SINR as an alternative or complement to wanted signal
level has been proposed to cope with cell e.g. re-selection and coverage class
selection in interference limited situations. These principles have also been
used when performing simulations, estimating the wanted signal level and SINR
accuracy achievable over the EC-SCH repetitions.
The FCCH is a natural channel to be used for signal level estimation
considering its high PSD characteristics in extended coverage. This should
help in refining the estimation results presented in this paper.
A signal level estimation with an RMSE accuracy of lower than 2 dB was
observed if averaging over 5 signal level samples, performing the averaging in
the linear domain. Similar accuracy was observed for SINR estimation in the
range -10 dB \< Average SINR \< 30 dB.
Finally, a system simulator model for wanted signal level and SINR estimation
errors has been outlined.
Considering the additional investigated SINR based estimator, this could be
seen as a complement or replacement of a signal based estimator.
