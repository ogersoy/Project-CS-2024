# Introduction
GERAN is a result of over a decade of radio interface evolution that is still
ongoing. While GERAN is or is being deployed worldwide also in emerging
markets, evolving further the GERAN radio interface needs to be studied to
ensure not only that the same services are available regardless of the
underlying radio technology UTRAN or GERAN, but essentially that service
continuity exists across these radio technologies supported by core network
evolution e.g. IMS. Such an evolution is also needed to maintain GERAN
competitiveness as well as UTRAN competitiveness.
# 1 Scope
The present document is an output of the 3GPP work item \"Future GERAN
Evolution\" [1].
The scope of this document is to capture the results of the feasibility study
on the GERAN, the objectives of which are to: increase capacity, coverage and
data rates; reduce latency; and enhance service continuity with other RATs;
while minimising impacts to infrastructure.

# 4 Objectives
## 4.1 General
The general objective of this study is to improve the service performance and
to provide efficient bearers for GERAN to meet enhanced demands for different
types of services. Some examples of services considered are given below.
  * Interactive and Best-effort services (like web browsing, file > download and image or video clip upload) typically gain from > increased mean bit rates, but also gain from reduced latency, e.g. > throughput is limited by the TCP window size divided by the round > trip time.
  * Conversational services (like Voice over IP (VoIP) and enhanced Push > to talk over Cellular (PoC)), as well as, e.g. on-line gaming > services typically have high requirements on latency and fast > access.
  * All services may gain from improved coverage, e.g. video-telephony > is a service that will need (better) coverage for higher bit rates > for both uplink and downlink.
  * All services may gain from a mobile station always being connected > to the most appropriate base station, i.e. as seen from a radio > performance perspective, as this may yield higher capacity, reduce > latency etc. due to improved interference conditions.
  * Particular requirements may be set by services like broadcast TV > over MBMS bearers. Typically, high bit rates are required at the > same time as robustness is important to fulfil coverage and > latency requirements as well as providing interactivity.
A GSM/EDGE network may interoperate with WCDMA RAT, either within an
operator\'s network or with different operators. There are also standalone
GSM/EDGE networks. Both the GSM/WCDMA networks and the GSM only networks will
benefit from the increased GSM/EDGE service portfolio. A combined WCDMA &
GSM/EDGE network will benefit from better service continuity between the
accesses resulting in an easier resource utilisation and service provisioning.
GSM/EDGE only networks can give their users an increased range of end user
services/applications and possibly make use of applications/services that do
not require adaptations to access specific capabilities. This could
potentially lead to reduce cost of provisioning and create a wider use of
services.
As a general guideline, the following subclauses detail the performance
requirements and design constraints the proposed features/candidates should
take into account. Taking those in consideration would enable easy network
evolution and be able to efficiently use existing network equipment and
support legacy mobile stations.
Each candidate should describe the compliance to the following relevant
assumptions and pre-requisites. If non-compliant the reasons and consequences
need to be detailed.
## 4.2 Performance objectives
The enhancements are expected to provide (either a single one or as a group of
enhancements per listed requirement):
  * Spectrum efficiency/capacity (interference limited scenario):
\- 50 % better (measured in kbps/MHz/cell for data and Erl/MHz/cell for
speech).
  * Increase peak data rates:
\- 100 % better in downlink and uplink.
  * Improved coverage (noise limited scenario):
\- Speech and data:
  * Sensitivity increase in downlink of 3 dB.
  * Improved service availability (when cells are planned for speech):
\- Increase mean bit rate by 50% at cell edges for uplink and downlink.
  * Reduced latency:
\- Initial access (\"no TBF assigned\"):
  * A round trip time less than 450 milliseconds (in non-ideal radio > conditions on the radio interface).
\- After initial access:
  * A round trip time less than 100 milliseconds (in non-ideal radio > conditions on the radio interface).
NOTE: Round trip time means end-to-end; i.e. the time between sending an echo
request from the end user to the server and receiving the response, but in
this document only contributions from the mobile station up to the Gi
interface and vice versa are included in the RTT figure.
  * Balanced performance improvements:
\- Throughput improvements should be supported by available round trip time
e.g. RTT-bit rate-product should not increase over typical TCP window size.
\- Relatively similar uplink and downlink improvements on bit rates, coverage,
capacity and latency.
\- Peak bit rate or improvements in ideal conditions should not be primary
optimisation goal, but typical performance in real network.
## 4.3 Compatibility objectives
The proposals should consider the following compatibility objectives:
  * Coexist with existing legacy frequency planning:
\- This will enable an operator to deploy the enhancements in existing network
given already existing adjacent frequency protection levels, sensitivity and
interference levels.
\- This will enable an operator to do plug-and-play deployment of new enhanced
radio bearers in existing networks.
  * Coexist with legacy mobile stations:
\- This will enable compatibility with legacy (E)GPRS terminals by allowing
multiplexing of shared resources and thereby avoiding radio resource
segregation.
  * Avoid impacts on existing BTS, BSC and CN hardware:
\- This will enable use of already existing hardware and only require a
software upgrade.
  * Be based on the existing network architecture and minimal impact on > core network:
This will enable an operator to re-use existing network nodes.
  * Be applicable also for Dual Transfer Mode.
  * Be applicable for the A/Gb mode interface.
# 5 Conclusions and recommendations
Within a relatively short period of time a significant number of proposals has
been put forward to determine the next steps on future GERAN evolution. The
general viability of proposals can be determined by comparing how those fit
with the given objectives in chapter 4, which are summarised in table 1.
Conclusions and recommendations for downlink, uplink and latency enhancements
are summarised in subclauses 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 respectively.
Numbers in the table refer to the related chapter of the feasibility study.
Some proposals are combined to achieve better performance. Some performance
objectives like \"balanced performance improvements\" are considered as
general objectives, thus not included in the table. Downlink and uplink
performance objectives are separated, since most of the proposals are meant
only for one link.
Table 1 should be seen as giving the current status for each proposal and is
subject to change with each forthcoming meeting.

## 5.1 Conclusions and recommendations for Downlink
**Mobile Station Receive Diversity (MSRD) is a downlink feature, which
improves the receiver performance of the mobile station by means of an
additional antenna. The introduction of Single Antenna Interference
Cancellation (SAIC) characterised by the Downlink Advanced Receiver
Performance (DARP) requirements has already shown that receiver enhancements
in the MS can provide significant gains in terms of spectral efficiency. MS
receive diversity offers the possibility of enhanced channel diversity and the
potential for further improved interference cancellation performance for GMSK
modulated signals. Also, as opposed to SAIC, receive diversity enables
significant gains for 8PSK-modulated signals. It has been noted that MSRD has
significant impact on the MS hardware, and may impact both terminal power
consumption and size.**
Simulations and literature surveys in clause 6 have shown that considerable
gains are achievable for both 8-PSK and GMSK modulated signals, although it is
recognized that factors such as antenna performance and terminal design may
impact the performance in a live network. To study the performance in more
detail a simple channel model was derived, which includes antenna correlation
and gain imbalance between the receiver antennas.
Subclauses 6.3.4.2 to 6.3.4.4 have assessed the impact of these parameters
using the MSRD channel models as well as provided a small literature survey of
publications related to the achievable performance MS receive diversity.
Several contributions have shown the impact in terms of receiver performance
for different architectures and in general it seems that the diversity
receivers are relatively insensitive to parameter variations. That is, large
gains are achieved even for high values of correlation and antenna gain
imbalance. Link- and system level simulations have been provided for speech
services (AMR) and data services (EGPRS).
Based on the results reported in chapter 6, it has been decided to open a work
item on MSRD characterised by DARP Phase II. This was agreed at TSG GERAN#27.
**Multi-carrier** is a performance-enhancing feature whereby data to a single
user can be transmitted on multiple carriers (see clause 7). The feature is
aimed at enabling higher data rates in GERAN with minimal impacts to
infrastructure. Currently, the theoretical peak data rate of EGPRS is 473.6
kbps for a single user. In a real network, average bit rates in the order of
100 kb/s to 200 kb/s are feasible on four timeslots. With multi-carrier, both
peak and average user throughput are increased proportionally to the number of
carriers. With a dual-carrier configuration, the peak data rate would be close
to 1 Mb/s. With this feature, peak and average bit rates can be increased in a
very flexible and backwards-compatible manner.
Given the current technical and implementation limitations, it is considered
acceptable in an initial phase to restrict the number of carriers to two. The
need for higher bit rates could make it desirable to support more than two
carriers in future releases of the GERAN standards.
**Dual Carrier in the Downlink** has been shown to meet some of the
performance objectives of GERAN Evolution (in particular it enables an
increase in the peak downlink data rate) without impairing any of the other
performance metrics. Also, it satisfies all the compatibility objectives for
candidate features; in particular, it is expected that it will have no impact
on BSS hardware, given that there are no changes to the modulation and to the
coding schemes. It is also anticipated that implementation in the MS is
feasible.
Dual Carrier in the Downlink can optionally be combined with MS Receive
Diversity. Provided that the MS supports this capability, it could be possible
for a dual antenna terminal to switch between dual carrier reception and MS
receive diversity (see clause 12).
Based on the results of the Feasibility Study (as detailed in clause 7), it
has been decided to open a work item on Dual Carrier in the Downlink. This was
agreed at GERAN#28.

# 6 Mobile station receiver diversity
## 6.1 Introduction
Mobile Station receiver diversity is a downlink feature, which improves the
receiver performance of the mobile station by means of an additional antenna.
The introduction of Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC)
characterised by the Downlink Advanced Receiver Performance (DARP)
requirements has already shown that receiver enhancements in the MS can
provide significant gains in terms of spectral efficiency [1]. MS receiver
diversity offers the possibility of enhanced channel diversity and the
potential for further improved interference cancellation performance for GMSK
modulated signals as well as significant gains for 8PSK-modulated signals. As
stated in clause 4 one of the key objectives of the GERAN evolution is to
improve the end user performance, for instance by increasing the average data
rates, and the receiver performance improvement introduced by MS receiver
diversity has the potential to do exactly that by e.g. improving user
throughput for downlink EGPRS services.
## 6.2 Concept description
The aim of MS diversity is to enhance the reception of a given link in the
downlink direction, by means of diversity provided by an additional antenna.
Thus, receiver diversity is based on reception of the _same_ signal on two
antennas in the MS. Therefore no changes are made to the transmissions schemes
in the Base Transceiver Station (BTS).
{width="2.8402777777777777in" height="2.4145833333333333in"}
Figure 1: Concept of MS Receive Diversity
Seen from the Layer 1 in the MS, the introduction of MS Receiver diversity
will be a general _link level_ improvement. That is, the signals received by
the two antennas are to be combined as one link. Therefore existing algorithms
and procedures such as link adaptation, bit error probability estimation and
RXQUAL are expected to remain unchanged in the sense that these measures
simply reflect improved link quality.
## 6.3 Modelling Assumptions and Requirements
To evaluate the performance of dual-antenna terminals, the channel models
currently used in TSG GERAN must be extended to model two parallel channels.
Figure 2 depicts a model of the environment surrounding a dual antenna MS.
{width="5.913888888888889in" height="2.5409722222222224in"}
Figure 2: Interferer environment for a dual antenna MS
As seen from the figure, the MS has two receiver branches, each influenced by
both interference and thermal noise (modelled by AWGN). The figure also
illustrates how the signal received at one antenna will be correlated with the
signal received at the other. For instance, the desired signal received at the
two antennas is correlated with a correlation factor
{width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}. This
correlation factor is a function of the radio propagation environment, the
physical design of the MS as well as the presence of a user.
Besides the correlation factors, the model shows individual gain for each
antenna, {width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}and
{width="0.20833333333333334in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}. The difference
between these values is sometimes referred to as the branch power difference
(BPD) or the Antenna Gain Imbalance (AGI). This difference is dependent on the
physical design of the transmitting and receiving antennas, the scattering
medium and also on other factors including user interaction. For example, the
user may cover one of the two antennas with his/her hand during reception. The
BPD is only considered most relevant for noise-limited scenarios (i.e. at, or
close to the minimum supportable received power level), since - to a first-
order approximation - the carrier to interference ratio (CIR) can be
considered the same for each antenna although one has less gain than the
other. That is, both carrier and interferer are attenuated thus maintaining
the same CIR.
In order to evaluate the performance of dual antenna mobiles, a dual channel
model must be defined, which takes the impact of antenna correlation and gain
differences into account. The following subclauses deals with how to define
such as model and the parameters associated with it.
### 6.3.1 Spatial Modelling
As a starting point, a 2x2 MIMO channel model [3] is assumed, where the first
transmit antenna transmits the signal of the desired user, and the second
transmit antenna transmits the signal of the interferer. For convenience, flat
fading is assumed, where the transmission coefficients
{width="0.2361111111111111in" height="0.2222222222222222in"} describe the
transmission paths of between transmit antenna {width="0.125in"
height="0.1388888888888889in"} and receive antenna
{width="0.16666666666666666in" height="0.1388888888888889in"} (see note), see
figure 3.
NOTE: The first index of the transmission coefficients denotes the receive
antenna and the second index the transmit antenna.
{width="3.571527777777778in" height="1.8076388888888888in"}
Figure 3: Scattering environment for a dual antenna MS [13]
It is assumed that the channel coefficients {width="0.2361111111111111in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"} are superpositions of
{width="0.1388888888888889in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} multipath
components (MPC), each of which interacting with the scattering medium through
a different path. Each MPC is described by its angle of departure (AOD),
denoted as{width="0.1527777777777778in" height="0.2222222222222222in"}, and
its Angle Of Arrival (AOA), denoted as{width="0.1527777777777778in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}, and its complex amplitude
{width="0.7083333333333334in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}. Note that
nothing is assumed on the relationship between AOD and AOA of a MPC. A MPC may
arise due to single scattering, multiple scattering, or line-of-sight
transmission.
First, we consider the TX antennas to be far-distanced, and the TX antennas of
the desired user and the interferer illuminate different scatterers. Such a
situation arises as inter-site interference, i.e. the BTS antennas of the
desired user and the interferer belong to different BTS sites, see figure 4.
{width="4.503472222222222in" height="2.79375in"}
Figure 4: Inter-site interference scenario [13]
We denote the complex amplitudes of the MPCs between TX antenna 1 and RX
antenna 1 as {width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"}and
between TX antenna 2 and RX antenna 1 as{width="0.2777777777777778in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}. The phase shifts between the RX antennas are
denoted as {width="0.25in" height="0.2361111111111111in"}for the MPCs from the
first TX antenna and {width="0.2777777777777778in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}for the MPCs of the second TX antenna,
respectively. Note that the far-field and the narrow-band condition is assumed
to be valid for the RX antennas.
The transmission coefficients are:
{width="3.0555555555555554in" height="2.2083333333333335in"} (1)
Here, {width="0.1388888888888889in" height="0.18055555555555555in"} is the
wavelength, {width="0.4305555555555556in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} is a
unit vector pointing toward the AOA of the {width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.18055555555555555in"}th MPC, and {width="0.2638888888888889in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} and {width="0.2638888888888889in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}are the locations of the transmit and receive
antennas, respectively, relative to an arbitrary coordinate system. Moreover,
{width="0.25in" height="0.25in"} denotes the scalar product of two vectors.
With regard to the statistics of the transmission coefficients, it is assumed
that each {width="0.2361111111111111in" height="0.2222222222222222in"} is a
zero-mean complex circularly symmetric Gaussian random variable, i.e.
{width="0.6666666666666666in" height="0.2222222222222222in"} and
{width="0.7222222222222222in" height="0.2777777777777778in"} for all
{width="0.2916666666666667in" height="0.1527777777777778in"}. Moreover, it is
assumed that the complex amplitudes of the MPC are mutually uncorrelated, i.e.
{width="1.0833333333333333in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} for
{width="0.3055555555555556in" height="0.18055555555555555in"}.
**Receive Correlation**
Since the signals of TX antenna 1 and TX antenna 2 are transmitted over two
completely different propagation paths, the two correlation factors between
the RX signals are different:
{width="2.375in" height="1.0965277777777778in"} (2)
The RX correlation factors may differ in their absolute value, but also in
their phase angle. The phase angle of the correlation factor depends on the
main direction at which the received signal arrives at the MS. When the latter
differs much for desired user and interferer, there is also a huge difference
in the phase angle.
**Transmit Correlation**
Due to uncorrelated MPC between TX antenna 1 and the receiver and TX antenna 2
and the receiver, respectively, the TX correlation factors are zero:
{width="1.2083333333333333in" height="0.5416666666666666in"} (3)
Therefore, considering only correlation on the receiver side a suitable
channel model can be implemented as described in subclauses 6.3.2 and 6.3.3.
### 6.3.2 Single input - dual output channel model
Figure 5 shows a simple linear model that can be used to generate a two branch
fading signal.
{width="3.696527777777778in" height="1.6222222222222222in"}
Figure 5: Single input - dual output channel model for MS Receiver Diversity
The model consists of a single input signal, which is sent through two fading
channels. The multipath fading is independent Rayleigh fading processes but
the channel profile, e.g. TU50 is the same for each branch. The correlation
between the two branches is generated using the weighting factor
{width="0.1527777777777778in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}. The system
equations of the linear model are:
{width="1.44375in" height="0.5138888888888888in"}
The magnitude of the complex cross-correlation between the two received
signals _Y~1~_ and _Y~2~_ is then:
{width="3.388888888888889in" height="0.5694444444444444in"}
Assuming that _X~1~_ and _X~2~_ are independent processes and thus orthogonal
results in:
{width="2.611111111111111in" height="0.5138888888888888in"}
Since:
{width="0.7777777777777778in" height="0.4583333333333333in"}
Similarly the denominator reduces to:
{width="6.125in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}
An alternative description of the correlation, the envelope correlation, is
sometimes used in the literature. The relation between these two correlation
measures can be approximated as [19]:
{width="0.5277777777777778in" height="0.2638888888888889in"}
Figure 6 show the coupling between the two measures.
{width="4.05625in" height="3.042361111111111in"}
Figure 6: Coupling between the envelope correlation and the magnitude of the
complex correlation for Gaussian fading I and Q-part of the complex channel
taps
### 6.3.3 Multiple interferer model
The single input-dual output model is easily extended to a multi-interferer
scenario as shown in figure 7. The model uses instances of the single input
dual output channel model to instantiate the interfering signals. After
summation of the interfering signals and the desired signal an AWGN signal is
added to the received signal at each antenna to model the internal noise of
the receiver. A gain scaling is also applied to model the difference in
antenna gains.
{width="5.897222222222222in" height="4.141666666666667in"}
Figure 7: Multi interferer model
Figures 8 and 9 show the correlation as a function of time when applying a
sliding window on a TU3nFH channel @ 945 MHz using the channel model above.
The mean correlation was set to 0.7 and a single cochannel interferer was
applied. Additional plots can be found in [26].

### 6.3.4 Channel Model Parameters
In this subclause the parameters of the channel model is studied in more
detail in order to be able to select a suitable parameter set for evaluation
of the MSRD feature. The studies are based on measurements, surveys and
simulations showing the characteristics and impact of the antenna correlation
and the antenna gain imbalance.
#### 6.3.4.1 Measurement results on Antenna Correlation
The following subclauses provide correlation measurements for three routes,
with a full view and a zoomed view into one of the more interesting areas. The
routes/scenarios are:
1\. Indoor, Pedestrian Speed. No repeater.
2\. Indoor, Pedestrian Speed. With Repeater.
3\. Outdoor (U.S. Highway 163-South).
These field data were taken with a QUALCOMM MSM6500 diversity FFA. The phone
has an external stubby dipole antenna and an internal meander line antenna.
Data were recorded during traffic calls on Verizon\'s San Diego network at 800
MHz. Note that Verizon\'s network is not a GSM network but the correlation
measurements do not depend on the employed airlink.
The measurements are derived from complex estimates from each receive chain
correlated over a sliding 1-second period. The plots show {width="0.25in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"} on the y-axis.
In all of the following plots some of the BTS\'s are collocated, i.e. signals
from different BTS\'s come from the same physical site. This will be indicated
when applicable.
##### 6.3.4.1.1 Indoor, Pedestrian Speed. No repeater
Figures 10 and 11 come from measurements performed at pedestrian speed in an
indoor scenario. In this scenario, BTS B and BTS C are from the same site.
However, due to the rich scattering environment, even the correlation of those

Figures 12 and 13 come from measurements performed at pedestrian speed in an
indoor scenario with the presence of a repeater. In this scenario, BTS A and
BTS B are from the same site, while BTS C is not. However, due to the

obvious conclusion can be considered as a validation of the measurement
process.

#### 6.3.4.2 Literature Survey
This subclause summarises measurements of the envelope correlation and mean
branch power imbalance found in scientific publications [4], [5] and [6].
##### 6.3.4.2.1 Envelope correlation
The correlation between the two branches can vary considerably and depend on
many factors. These include the scattering environment, handset orientation,
head-and-hand-to-handset interaction, antenna spacing and the antenna design.
##### 6.3.4.2.2 Spatial diversity
Spatial diversity is achieved by using two antennas separated in space. The
correlation between the two signals is related to the distance between the
antennas relative to the wavelength of the signal. The possible separation is
limited by the size of the mobile station. A reasonable separation could be 4
cm (1.6 inches), which corresponds to roughly 0.1 wavelengths at 800 MHz to
900 MHz and 0.25 wavelengths at 1 800 MHz to 1 900 MHz.
The measurement results in [4] show the effect of antenna spacing on the
envelope correlation for a 2.05 GHz carrier frequency system. In an urban
canyon NLOS (non-line-of-sight), the mean envelope correlation is roughly 0.75
at an antenna spacing of 0.1 of the wavelength and stays at roughly 0.6 across
0.15 to 0.45 of the wavelength. Additional measurements in the same paper show
lower correlation values for other environments, ranging from 0.4 to 0.65
(mean values for the respective environments) at 0.1 wavelength antenna
distance and 0.3 to 0.6 at 0.25 wavelength antenna distance. It is interesting
to note that the difference between 0.1 and 0.25 wavelengths separation is
quite small and clearly smaller than expected from theory. This is further
discussed in subclause 6.3.4.2.4.
Additional measurement distributions for various channel and test conditions
in an operational GSM network are described in [6], according to which the
correlation coefficient can have a mean and standard deviation of (0.44, 0.3)
in rural measurements with a wide yet fairly flat distribution from roughly
0.2 to 0.8. In an urban environment, the measured correlation coefficient has
a mean and standard deviation of (0.23, 0.33) and a wide non-uniform
distribution. It should be noted that the measurements in [6] are conducted on
the uplink, with antenna spacing significantly larger than what is possible in
a mobile station. Nevertheless, the results are similar to the downlink
measurements in [4].
In [23] the performance of different antenna types (dipole, patch in 3
configurations) on a small handset is studied with and without the presence of
a user by means of measurements. The correlation is found to be below 0.4 in
free space and rises to around 0.6 when the user is present for the different
antenna types. In [24] the diversity gains of handheld phones are assessed by
means of measurements. Also here the presence of a user\'s head is included,
and low correlation is obtained (\~ 0.1). In [25] the potential diversity
performance of a handheld phone is studied in a UMTS bandwidth scenario. 150
test persons used the handset in a normal speaking position, and for all 150
persons the correlation was always below 0.7. The antenna gain imbalance had a
maximum of around 4 dB when using a dipole and a patch antenna for certain
users.
##### 6.3.4.2.3 Polarization diversity
Polarization diversity is achieved by using two antennas with different
(typically orthogonal) polarization relative to each other.
With polarization diversity, a very good de-correlation between the branches
can be achieved. Measurements in e.g. [4] and [6] typically show average
values below 0.3.
##### 6.3.4.2.4 Antenna pattern diversity
Diversity can also be achieved by using antennas with different antenna
patterns (i.e. the antenna gain varies with the direction in the horizontal
plane and the elevation angle). Due to this the received signals of the two
antennas will be composed by reflections from different scatterers in the
local environment.
As with polarization diversity, a very good de-correlation between the
branches can be achieved with antenna patterns diversity. Again, measurements
in [4] show average values below 0.3.
It should be noted that also a pair of omnidirectional antennas used for
spatial diversity will experience antenna pattern diversity [4]. This is since
the antennas will be coupled if their distance to each other is small. This in
turn will change the individual antenna patterns from omnidirectional to
directional. Therefore, the correlation of a spatial antenna pair with small
separation will be lower than expected from theory for omnidirectional
antennas (as indicated by the measurements recited in subclause 6.3.4.2.2).
##### 6.3.4.2.5 Mean branch power imbalance
This parameter models the difference in mean received signal power between the
two antennas. It is affected, for example, by the handset orientation, the
head-and-hand-to-handset interaction, the antenna spacing and the dual-antenna
design.
The power imbalance has a large range depending on the environment. In [4],
values from 0 dB to 7 dB are reported for different types of dual-antennas for
mobile station, except in one situation where 13 dB imbalance is shown. In [5]
and [6], values are presented (for uplink) in a large range mainly below 10 dB
for polarization diversity.
#### 6.3.4.3 Results from measurements at Ericsson Research
This subclause summarises not yet published results from experiments conducted
at Ericsson Research.
Various dual terminal antenna prototypes have been tested, giving different
combinations of spatial, polarization and antenna pattern diversity. The
experiments were conducted in an indoor office environment at 1 880 MHz. The
effects of a user were included. The user either held the prototype close to
the right ear (\"talk mode\") or in a position in front of the body, typical
for viewing the terminal screen (\"data mode\").
The base station was transmitting at 22 dBm. Both horizontal and vertical
polarization of the base antenna was evaluated with similar results.
##### 6.3.4.3.1 Envelope correlation
The measurements show similar results as in subclause 6.3.4.2. The envelope
correlation is found to range mainly from 0 to 0.7, both in talk mode and data
mode.
##### 6.3.4.3.2 Mean branch power imbalance
Again, the measurements resemble those in subclause 3.1 The measured mean
branch power imbalance is in the range 1 dB to 4.5 dB in data mode, while it
is in the range 2 dB to 13 dB in talk mode.
#### 6.3.4.4 Results From Simulations
In this subclause some preliminary simulation results are presented to show
how the choice of parameters for the channel/antenna model impacts the
performance of an interference cancellation algorithm. Note that results are
not yet available with the multiple-interferer model in figure 7. Instead,
results with a single co-channel interferer are shown.
The following simulation assumptions were used:
  * TU3 channel with ideal frequency hopping.
  * Realistic MS receiver impairments.
  * Noise level is 25 dB below carrier.
  * Desired signal is GMSK modulated (MCS-3).
  * Interferer is 8PSK modulated.
  * Interference cancellation was used.
##### 6.3.4.4.1 Impact of branch correlation
The impact of branch correlation is shown in figure 16 for envelope
correlations in the range 0 to 0.9 for the carrier and interferer signals. It
can be seen that the performance (gain at BLER=10 %, compared to a
conventional single-antenna receiver) is relatively insensitive to the
correlation. The largest gain is achieved when the correlation of the carrier
is low while the correlation of the interferer is high. With equal correlation
of the carrier and interferer, the gain is more or less constant regardless of
the correlation value chosen.
{width="3.9583333333333335in" height="3.0in"}
Figure 16: Impact of antenna correlation [11]
It should be noted that a random phase offset was applied to one of the
antenna branches when deriving the results of figure 14.
##### 6.3.4.4.2 Impact of branch power imbalance
Figure 17 shows the impact of branch power imbalance. In this figure, the
correlation of the carrier and interferer are the same. The results indicate
that the branch power imbalance is more important than the correlation.
However, for imbalance levels less than 10 dB, the gain is more or less the
same. For imbalance levels larger than 10 dB the gain is reduced. This is
likely due to the noise component at 25 dB below the carrier (on average).
{width="3.9375in" height="2.9479166666666665in"}
Figure 17: Impact of mean branch power imbalance (G) [11]
The results are consistent with those presented to GERAN in [7] and [8]. Note
though that the results in [8] are in a sensitivity-limited environment, which
explains the larger impact of the branch power imbalance. Generally, the
branch power imbalance does not significantly impact the performance in purely
interference limited scenarios, since the attenuation impacts carrier and
interference equally. However, when the received signal level is close to the
sensitivity level, the imbalance will degrade performance.
##### 6.3.4.4.3 Phase offset
As mentioned in subclauses 6.3 and 6.3.1, there may be a phase offset between
the signals received at the two antennas in the MS, This phase offset may
originate from different antenna spacing and/or angle of arrival in a line of
sight scenario. In [13], [22], [14], [26], [28] and [29] it has been discussed
whether or not to implement such a phase offset in the MSRD channel models,
considering that different branches of the channel model fade independently.
In the following, the effect of applying both a random and a constant phase
offset is studied by means of simulations.
To study the effect of applying a random phase offset in one of the antenna
branches, a set of simulations was run for a sensitivity limited scenario as
well as DTS-1 and DTS-2. A TU50 nFH channel was used and 5 000 blocks were
simulated. The phase shift was randomly selected per burst in the range
{width="0.375in" height="0.19375in"}, and correlation factors in the range
from 0 to 1.0 were applied. The results are presented in figures 18 to 20.
{width="4.375in" height="3.28125in"}

[26]
{width="4.375in" height="3.28125in"}
Figure 20: BER performance. TU50nFH1845. DTS-2 - With and without phase offset
[26]
The conclusion of the simulations can be summarized as:
  * Co-channel: For correlation values in the range of 0 to 0.8 the > largest impact of the phase offset is 0.5 dB. For correlations of > 0.9 and 1.0 there is a gain of 1 and 2.5 dB when applying a phase > offset.
  * Adjacent: For correlation values in the range of 0 to 0.9 the > largest impact of the phase offset is 0.4 dB. For a correlation of > 1.0 there is a gain of 1 dB when applying a phase offset.
  * Sensitivity: The phase offset has no impact.
The impact on MSRD performance originating from a constant difference in phase
angle on the desired and interfering user was studied in [22]. The studies
were based on a scenario comprising of two direct incoming waves as shown in
figure 21.
{width="2.3625in" height="2.488888888888889in"}
Figure 21: Antenna setup at MS side for evaluation of the impact\ on phase
difference between antenna correlations [22]
In [22] examples of the relationship between phase angle and envelope
correlation are given assuming an angular spread of 35 degrees and three
different antenna spacings. Based on this a set of simulations were run to
study the impact of phase difference between desired and interfering signals.
For the simulations, an 8-PSK modulated transmission in a co-channel
interference scenario is considered, and the multiple interferer model shown
in [1], figure 4 is assumed. The channel profile is TU3iFH.
The signals of desired user and interferer may arrive from different incidence
directions, resulting in different phase angles in the correlation factors.
The absolute value of the correlation factor is assumed to be 0.9 for both
users.
Figure 22 depicts the raw bit error rate of the desired user as a function of
the carrier-to-interferer ratio. For comparison, the raw BER of a conventional
single-antenna 8-PSK receiver is also shown.
{width="5.231944444444444in" height="3.926388888888889in"}
Figure 22: Raw bit error rate of an 8-PSK receiver in a co-channel interferer
scenario [22]
It becomes obvious that receiver performance improves for increasing phase
difference of the correlation factors. At a BER level of 10^-2^ for example,
the improvement between 0^º^ and 180^º^ phase difference is around 10 dB. With
the findings of the previous subclause, it can be concluded that the
performance of interference cancellation schemes is significantly dependent on
the incidence direction of the incoming signals in the scenarios applied here.
The worst-case is when the signals of desired user and interferer arrive from
the same direction.
The dependency of receiver performance on the correlation factors\' phase
difference is at maximum for a correlation factor of 1.0 and decreases for
lower correlation factors. This becomes obvious when considering the multiple
interferer of subclause 6.3.3. For an absolute value of the correlation
factors of 1.0 and a phase difference of 0 degrees, no interference can be
cancelled at all. On the other hand, for a phase difference of 180 degrees,
interference can be cancelled perfectly just by adding the signals of the two
antenna branches. In the other extreme, when the correlation factors of both
users are equal to zero, the phase angle just plays no role. Simulations
showed that the phase angle of the correlation factors should be considered
for envelope correlation factors above 0.7.
##### 6.3.4.4.4 Impact of Antenna correlation Factors in desired and
interfering branches
In [14], plots showing performance as a function of correlation in the
interferer signal branch for a fixed correlation in the desired branch of 0.4
and 0.6 were presented. In the following results are provided for a
correlation range of [0, 0.3 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0] for both desired and
interferer. The multi-interferer model specified in subclause 6.3.3 was used.
Figure 23 shows the performance for the MSRD receiver, as a function of the
correlation in the desired and interferer branch. The performance is measured
as the C/I level in dB at which a raw BER of 1 % is reached.
{width="4.36875in" height="3.276388888888889in"}
Figure 23: Impact of correlation in desired and interfere branch. DTS-1 \-
GMSK [26]
As seen on figure 23, the performance is relatively constant across the
performance surface, except when the correlation is close to one. At this
point the performance becomes similar to the performance of a single branch
receiver with SAIC (see note). Applying the same correlation in desired and
interferer branch seems to result in average to worst-case performance.
NOTE: A SAIC receiver would cross the 1 % raw BER at around 5 dB.
{width="4.36875in" height="3.276388888888889in"}
Figure 24: Impact of correlation in desired and interfere branch - DTS-2 \-
GMSK [26]
Figure 24 shows the corresponding plots for DTS-2, which contains multiple
interferers. The MSRD receiver shows a performance surface similar to the
DTS-1 scenario. That is, a relatively flat performance surface except for very
high correlations.
In [21], the impact of antenna correlation and antenna gain imbalance was
studied for the GERAN configuration 2 scenario [1]. The performance obtained
when applying a correlation coefficient of 0.7 and a gain imbalance of 3 dB is
shown in figures 25 and 26.

#### 6.3.4.5 Discussion
Subclauses 6.3.4.2 to 6.3.4.4 have assessed the impact of various parameters
of the MSRD channel models as well as provided a small literature survey of
publications related to the achievable performance of diversity in mobile
terminals. It seems clear that the performance of a diversity terminal is
impacted by several factors, such as antenna correlation, gain imbalance,
presence of a user, antenna spacing, etc.
In order to evaluate the gains of MS receive diversity, these values should be
carefully selected so that when used in simulations, the results will reflect
realistic link level performance. Now, since both parameters are influenced by
a number of MS implementation and user dependent factors it may be most
suitable to specify a set of parameters that would reflect the performance
bounds. That is, best and worst case values. Obviously, best case values would
be uncorrelated signals and no gain imbalance.
As for selecting the worst case or typical values, several contributions have
proposed values and shown the impact in terms of receiver performance for
different architectures [7], [8], [11], [17], [18] and [21]. In general, it
seems that the diversity receivers are relatively insensitive to parameter
variations. That is, large gains are achieved even for high values of both
correlation and antenna gain imbalance. Based on these studies and
simulations, it has been agreed that the parameters of table 2 is to be used
for specifying the link level performance of MS receive diversity.

##### 6.4.1.1.6 EGPRS Throughput
The optimal throughput curves for GPRS and EGPRS are shown in this subclause.
These curves are obtained by selecting the CS or MCS that yields the maximal
throughput for each C/I.
Figure 39 compares the hull curves of the DAIC and SAIC receivers to that of a
conventional receiver for GPRS CS1-4 in loaded network scenarios.
Figure 40 compares the hull curve of the DAIC receiver to that of a
conventional receiver for EGPRS MCS5-9 in loaded network scenarios.
It could be appreciated how much better the throughput performance of DAIC
with respect to SAIC or conventional receivers, and what enormous performance
boost EGPRS gets at typical C/I levels of 10 dB to 20dB.

#### 6.4.1.2 DARP Test Scenarios (DTS)
This subclause contains simulation results using the test scenarios defined
for DARP [20]. Assuming identical signal correlations for the wanted signal
and all interferers, simulations are run with parameter sets 1 to 3 for
antenna gain imbalance and correlation (see table 4) while choosing for all
users the same multipath profile and frequency bands.
Table 4: Gain and correlation parameters used for tests
* * *
Parameter set Antenna Gain Imbalance G [dB] Correlation
{width="0.1527777777777778in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} PS 1 0 0 PS 2 0
0.7 PS 3 -3 0.7
* * *
By applying these parameter sets, the performance of MS RX diversity is
evaluated under following conditions:
  * PS 1: uncorrelated signals/antennas and equal average receive power.
  * PS 2: highly correlated signals/antennas, e.g. due to angle of > arrival or small antenna spacing, and equal average receive power.
  * PS 3: highly correlated signals/antennas, e.g. due to angle of > arrival or small antenna spacing, and unequal average receive > power, e.g. due to shadowing of one antenna by hand or head.
Note that the reference single antenna receiver is favoured by allowing only
negative values for G as in practice a second antenna might also have a larger
gain than the first one.
Please note that the assumption of identical correlations is backed by the
observation that the actual choice of interferers\' signal correlations has
minor influence on the performance compared to the number of interferers,
their modulation schemes and signal powers [7], [8] and [9].
The interferers\' statistics itself is chosen according to test cases DTS-1
and DTS-2 specified in 3GPP TS 45.005 for DARP/SAIC, i.e. the interference
robustness improvement is investigated for:
  * a single synchronous co-channel interferer (DTS-1);
  * multiple synchronous co- and adjacent channel interferers (DTS-2).
Table 5: DARP Test Scenarios, DTS-1 and DTS-2
+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Test case | Interfering | Interferer | Interferer | Interferer | | | Signal | relative | TSC | delay range | | | | power level | | | +-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | DTS-1 | Co-Channel | 0 dB | None | No delay | | | 1 | | | | +-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | DTS-2 | Co-Channel | 0 dB | None | No delay | | | 1 | | | | | | | -10 dB | None | No delay | | | Co-Channel | | | | | | 2 | 3 dB | None | No delay | | | | | | | | | Adjacent 1 | -17 dB | --- | --- | | | | | | | | | AWGN | | | | +-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
For both interferer models, the performance is studied for the combination of:
  * GMSK modulated wanted signal and GMSK modulated interferer(s).
  * 8PSK modulated wanted signal and 8PSK modulated interferer(s).
Like for DARP/SAIC, the wanted signal always uses training sequence 0 while
the midamble of the interferers is filled with random data bits.
The power of the co-channel and adjacent channel interferer is measured in the
signal r1 before any receiver filtering and during the active part of the
desired burst. All power levels are relative to the signal level of the
strongest co-channel interferer. The level of the strongest co-channel
interferer (Co-channel 1) is -80 dBm and the AWGN power is measured over a
bandwidth of 270,833 kHz (see DARP test cases in 3GPP TS 45.005).
Performance results in interference-limited scenarios are provided for packet
switched channels in table 6. The carrier-to-dominant co-channel interference
ratio (C/I1) is given in dB for which a block error ratio of 10 % and 30 % is
achieved for MCS-1 to MCS-9 and MCS-8/MCS-9, respectively.
For benchmarking of MS RX diversity and GMSK modulated signals, the
corresponding DARP-phase 1 limits (3GPP TS 45.005, table 2o) as well as the
co-channel interference performance limits (derived1 from 3GPP TS 45.005,
table 2a) are included in table 4 for MCS-1 to MCS-4.
For assessment of MS RX diversity and 8PSK modulated signals, the 8PSK co-
channel interference performance limits specified for MCS-5 to MCS-9 are used
(derived1 from 3GPP TS 45.005, table 2c).
NOTE 1: The limits given in tables 2a and 2c of 3GPP TS 45.005, which
correspond to a single synchronous interferer test case (DTS-1), are applied
to C/I and increased by 0,61 dB when used as reference for C/I1 in DTS-2.

### 6.4.2 System level Performance
#### 6.4.2.1 Voice Capacity
This subclause provides results of system level simulations from [7], [12]
evaluating the potential gains in voice capacity when introducing MS receive
diversity.
##### 6.4.2.1.1 Link to System Mapping
The link-to-system mapping was validated by comparing the actual link
simulator to a \"mapped link simulator\". The \"mapped link simulator\" read
the desired and interfering signal levels from the actual link simulator on
every burst and translated them to estimated BEP and FEP with the stage-1 and
stage-2 maps. The actual and estimated FER for one antenna are shown in figure
41. The degradation from the mapping process is considered negligible.
For two antennas, we showed in [7] that Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) and
Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC) could be used as a
conservative estimate of the performance of Dual Antenna Interference
Cancellation (DAIC). In this method, the MRC branch gains were determined and
applied to the desired and interfering signals. The CIR and DIR were
calculated from the resulting summed branches, and then used to estimate BEP
and FEP through the stage-1 and stage-2 maps derived from non-diversity link
simulations.

The system voice capacity is Effective Frequency Load (EFL) at which 95 % of
the calls have less than 2% FER over the call duration. Blocked calls are
counted against the call satisfaction statistics.
Figures 42 and 43 show the system capacity at 3 km/hr and 50 km/hr,
respectively. Both figures show the Conventional Receiver (CR), 1-antenna
DARP, or DARP+MSRD. The DARP+MSRD receiver is shown with or without the
combined antenna impairments of 2 dB Antenna Gain Imbalance (AGI) and an
antenna correlation of 0.4. The antenna correlation is the magnitude of the
complex correlation. Note that the curves with DARP+MSRD use the MRC+SAIC
conservative approximation to dual antenna interference cancellation, as
presented in [7]. Table 15 contains a summary of the performance curves at the
95 %-ile point, which is defined as the system capacity.
With only one antenna, the channel model has quite a significant effect, the
TU channel being much more benign than flat fading. With DARP+MSRD, TU is
slightly better than flat fading. Both MSRD and the TU channel tend to reduce
the deep nulls experienced in flat fading.
The effects of antenna gain imbalance and correlation are shown together, and
only compared to the case of no impairments with flat fading. The degradation
is insignificant, which is consistent with previous link simulations [7] and
[8] that showed a smaller impact to interference-limited situations than noise
-limited situations.

# 7 Dual-carrier and multi-carrier
## 7.1 Introduction
Multi-carrier GERAN is a performance-enhancing feature aimed at improving peak
and average user throughput, increase trunking gain, and to reduce latency.
Currently, the theoretical peak data rate of EGPRS is 473.6 kbps. In a real
network, bit rates in the order of 100 kb/s to 200 kb/s are feasible on four
timeslots. With multi-carrier, both peak and average user throughput is
increased proportionally to the number of carriers. With a dual-carrier
constellation, the peak data rate would be close to 1 Mb/s. The need for
higher bit rates could make it desirable to support multi-carrier GERAN in
future releases of the GERAN standard. With this feature, peak and average bit
rates can be increased in a very flexible and backwards-compatible manner. The
improved data rates are needed in order to ensure that the same services are
available regardless of the underlying radio technology, GERAN or UTRAN.
The most obvious benefit of multi-carrier GERAN is that it overcomes one
limitation of the GSM radio interface - the 200 kHz carrier bandwidth. This
limitation puts a restriction on the rate of data transfer to one and the same
user, and is the fundamental difference between GSM/EDGE and other radio
access technologies such as WCDMA. Multi-carrier GERAN gives increased
flexibility in how the system throughput is divided among users.
Conceptually, dual-carrier is a special case of multi-carrier. Since there may
be differences mainly in terms of MS implementation, special consideration is
sometimes given to dual-carrier is the descriptions below.
In this chapter, it is assumed that the dual-carrier and multi-carrier concept
applies to the downlink and uplink except where explicitly indicated.
## 7.2 Concept description
### 7.2.1 Basic concept
Multi-carrier GERAN means that multiple GERAN carriers on independent carrier
frequencies (or MAIO:s in the frequency hopping case) are received or are
transmitted by the same terminal. A straightforward solution would be to split
the data flow of one user onto multiple carriers below RLC/MAC, reusing the
current physical layer per carrier without modifications. This could be seen
as a natural extension to the multi-slot principle, where a multi-slot
allocation is now allowed to span across more than one carrier. This is
illustrated in figure 48.

allocation.\ Right: Illustration of radio blocks in a 2*4-slot dual-carrier

typically not adjacent.
## 7.3 Modelling assumptions and requirements
There are no special requirements for the modelling of the multi-carrier
concept. The same principles as with EGPRS can be used.
## 7.4 Performance characterization
### 7.4.1 Peak data rates
The peak data rates for EGPRS for different number of carriers are shown in
table 20. The increase in average data rate is also proportional to the number
of carriers. Since there are also some additional degrees of freedom in the
channel allocation and link adaptation (trunking gain), the improvement can be
somewhat larger.

### 7.4.2 Window size limited TCP throughput
The high latency is a potential problem for the transport layer protocol. In
particular, the throughput and RTT should satisfy the \"throughput x RTT = TCP
window size\" limit, which gives the maximum throughput for a given TCP round
trip delay and TCP window size. This relation is illustrated in figure 22,
which shows the maximum RTT for throughputs between 50 kbit/s to 1 500 kbit/s.
{width="5.834027777777778in" height="3.9590277777777776in"}

### 7.4.3 Error-limited TCP throughput
#### 7.4.3.1 Introduction
The TCP throughput may also be limited by the segment error rate and by the
delay. This is generally referred to as the error-limited TCP throughput. In
this subclause, the performance of TCP is considered as not limited by the TCP
window.
#### 7.4.3.2 TCP modelling
The error-limited TCP throughput has been analyzed in the literature, and is
modelled by the following empiric formula (see [1] in clause 2):
{width="4.990972222222222in" height="0.5in"}
Where the following parameters are defined.
Table 21: TCP modelling parameters
* * *
Parameters Description MSS IP segment size (bits) RTT Round-trip time T~0~
Timeout (assumed = 5 * RTT) p Probability of IP segment loss No limit on
window size
* * *
#### 7.4.3.3 Multi-carrier GERAN modelling
**Air Interface**
The air interface peak data rate for Multi-carrier GERAN has been computed as
the simple multiplication of the per-carrier peak data rate times the number
of carriers. Two cases have been considered: the ideal case of 8 allocated
slots per carriers, and the more realistic case of 4 allocated slots per
carrier. The peak data rates are shown in table 20 in subclause 7.4.1.
TCP related figures
The TCP error-limited throughput has been modelled by the following set of
parameters.
Table 22: Figures used to model the TCP error-limited throughput
* * *
Parameter Figure(s) IP segment size [bytes] 1 500 IP segment error rate

Includes internet/backhaul delay + radio-related delay (including
retransmission overhead).
* * *
In reality, there will be some relationship between the number of carriers,
the IP segment error rate, and the associated delay. In that sense, by
neglecting such association we have performed some level of approximation.
However, given that the result is essentially driven by the delay figure, and,
within this, by its fixed component, we believe the formula yield an accurate
enough model of the expected behaviour.
#### 7.4.3.4 Results
The plots provided in annex A show how the error-limited TCP throughput may
turn into a performance upper bound, no matter how many carriers are combined
for MC GERAN.
When the two curves (i.e. the air interface peak data rate and the TCP error-
limited throughput) cross, it means that the increase of air interface peak
data rate is not translating into increase of TCP throughput. In these cases,
the TCP throughput is de-facto bounded by its error-limited performance (which
is in turn driven by the delay component).
Table 23 summarizes for the considered cases of multislot allocation and IP
error rate the number of carriers at which performance is bounded by the TCP
error-limited throughput.

The limit would obviously be reached earlier for if a more pessimistic IP
error rate were assumed.
## 7.5 Impacts to protocol architecture
### 7.5.1 Physical Layer
#### 7.5.1.1 Modulation, multiplexing, and radio transmission
No changes are expected.
#### 7.5.1.2 Channel coding
The channel coding of the basic multi-carrier concept (without inter-carrier
interleaving) can be carried out with the existing modulation and coding
schemes of EGPRS (MCS 1-9).
#### 7.5.1.3 Mobile capabilities
The multi-carrier capability could be defined either as a simple indication,
or as a set of dedicated multi-slot classes for multi-carrier. The first
option implies that the multi-carrier mobile would act like a time-slot
multiplier, the time and frequency domains being fully independent from each
other. With the latter option, there would be more flexibility to control the
number of time slots, but a set of new multi-slot classes would need to be
specified.
#### 7.5.1.4 Channel quality measurements
The current EGPRS mobiles are required to support the reporting of four
different types of measurements: MEAN_BEP measurements, CV_BEP measurements,
interference measurements (γ~CH~), and slot-wise MEAN_BEP measurements
(MEAN_BEP_TS).
For multi-carrier mobiles, the MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP reporting could be done
either in a carrier wise or combined manner. In the carrier wise scheme, the
MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP figures are individually calculated for each carrier,
whereas in the combined scheme, the MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP values are averaged
over multiple carriers.
The main benefit of the carrier wise MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP reporting is that the
potential imbalance between the carriers is taken into account. This is
especially important for the network deployments, where one carrier is placed
on the BCCH layer and the other carriers on the hopping layer. In such case,
the averaging over several carriers would produce an erroneous result, because
the fading statistics of hopping and non-hopping carriers are different. The
evident drawback of the carrier wise reporting is the increased size of the
channel quality report. The increased message size can be avoided by using the
poll-based reporting strategy, which is explained in subclause 7.5.2.6.
The main benefit of the combined MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP reporting is that the
size of the channel quality report remains unchanged. The obvious drawback is
the degraded estimation accuracy, when at least one of the carriers is
deployed on a non-hopping layer. This problem could be avoided by limiting the
scope of multi-carrier on the hopping layer, i.e. by using the same frequency
parameters (except MAIO) for both carriers. Besides enabling a more reliable
measurement reporting, such strategy would also simplify assignment
procedures.
Regardless of the reporting strategy for MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP measurements, the
interference and MEAN_BEP_TS measurements need to be reported per time slot.
Again, the method of subclause 7.5.2.6 can be exploited to avoid the increased
message size.
### 7.5.2 RLC/MAC
#### 7.5.2.1 Multiplexing with legacy MSs
The same principles apply for multiplexing on multiple carriers as on a single
carrier. There is no radio resource segregation: provided that the intra-
carrier interleaving is not used, the multi-carrier data flows can be
multiplexed with the single carrier data flows on the same timeslots.
#### 7.5.2.2 Multiplexing data on multiple carriers
##### 7.5.2.2.1 Simultaneous transmission over multiple carriers
The most straightforward way to allow for transmission over multiple carriers
is to allow a TBF to span over two carriers, like it would span over several
timeslots. The same TFI can be used over all carriers (even a different TFI
could be used per carrier, if deemed necessary). However RLC limitations
(window size) may come into effect if the total amount of timeslots exceeds 8:
this is looked at in subclause 7.5.2.4.
##### 7.5.2.2.2 Time-divided transmission over multiple carriers
Uplink transmission is ruled by dynamic allocation i.e. through USF. RRBP is
also used for reserving uplink radio blocks for transmission of RLC/MAC
control blocks by the mobile station.
With multi-carrier on the downlink, receiving over multiple carriers brings
about the transmission over multiple carriers (distinctively, as opposed to
simultaneously). The following behaviour is proposed:
  * Reception of an assigned USF on a given carrier grants uplink > transmission on the same carrier.
  * Reception of a valid RRBP on a given carrier grants uplink > transmission on the same carrier.
  * In case of a conflict (abnormal case, from the network side), i.e. > more than one uplink radio block reserved on the same time slot > and TDMA frames (see note) it is proposed that:
\- If one of the uplink radio block is reserved by means of RRBP for an
RLC/MAC control message, the MS shall respond in that uplink radio block.
\- If more than one uplink radio block are reserved by means of RRBP, the MS
shall respond in one of them (e.g. randomly selected). The MS shall send the
RLC/MAC control message according to the priorities defined in 3GPP TS 44.060.
\- If more than one uplink radio block are reserved by means of USF, the MS
shall respond in one of them (e.g. randomly selected).
NOTE: This may occur in case of colliding USF allocations (i.e. USFs detected
in the same block on more than one carrier at the same time), RRBP allocation
on one carrier colliding with a USF allocation on another carrier, or
colliding RRBP allocations hence granting the same uplink block on more than
one carrier at the same time.
#### 7.5.2.3 Segmentation / reassembly
Reassembly in multi-carrier case is comparable to reassembly in multi-slot
case; additional timeslots are monitored on the allocated carriers. Note that
additional requirement is put on mobile station side given all carriers have
to be monitored simultaneously: the MS has to monitor all allocated timeslots
on both carriers. While timeslots on a carrier are separated in time, carriers
are separated in frequency (hence timeslots (with same TN) on different
carriers occur at the same time).
#### 7.5.2.4 RLC window size
The RLC window size needs to cope with the maximum amount of outstanding RLC
data blocks within RLC roundtrip time. Otherwise too small a window starts to
limit the peak throughput. This amount is given as follows when _N_ carriers,
all timeslots (8 per carrier) and two RLC data blocks per radio block (20ms)
are used:
{width="2.4305555555555554in" height="0.3611111111111111in"} (4)
Typical RLC roundtrip time is 160 ms corresponding with BS_CV_MAX value of 6.
The RLC roundtrip time could however be significantly higher if Abis transport
is arranged by geo-stationary satellite hop, yielding to about 640ms RTT.
As can be seen from the Equation 1, the current maximum RLC Window Size for
EGPRS (1024) is well adapted for multi-carrier (except possibly in case of
Abis over satellite hop), but definitely too small for GPRS (64). The usage of
multi-carrier could be hence restricted to EGPRS.
#### 7.5.2.5 Incremental redundancy
In order to retain full retransmission flexibility, the incremental redundancy
(IR) within all carriers should be supported. This feature would be mandatory
for MS and optional for BSS.
#### 7.5.2.6 Link adaptation
Link quality measurements are reported in acknowledgement message, upon
request from the network. As described in subclause 7.5.1.4, it would be
beneficial to report the measurements separately for all carriers. In order to
avoid reporting a large amount of measurement data in a single EGPRS channel
quality report, the following approach could be considered.
Report measurements for only one carrier in the acknowledgement message (i.e.
report measurements for the carrier on which the poll was received).
Indication of the reported carrier is needed.
#### 7.5.2.7 Signalling
The allocation of multiple carriers needs to be supported through signalling
(assignment, reconfiguration of resources) between the network and the mobile
station. This will increase the likelihood for segmentation of the
corresponding RLC/MAC control messages. Note however that extended RLC/MAC
control message segmentation was introduced in Rel-6 for messages that span
over more than two radio blocks, and can be used in this case as well.
### 7.5.3 Higher layers
The support of multi-carrier by the mobile station needs to be indicated with
sufficient flexibility as part of the mobile station\'s capabilities.
It is assumed that the indication (broadcast) of the network support for
multi-carrier is not needed, given no need is identified for the MS to request
a multi-carrier transmission.
## 7.6 Downlink Dual Carrier
### 7.6.1 Overall throughput considerations for dual carrier on the downlink
A preliminary assessment is that multi-carrier is most feasible for the
downlink. Whether is can be applied also to the uplink depends on MS
implementation constraints which are studied in further subclauses. However,
even by just allowing multi-carrier reception in the downlink, it is possible
to increase the uplink data rates since receiving more effective downlink time
slots in a shorter period of time allows to accommodate more uplink timeslots.
For instance, the definition of higher multi-slot classes with effective sum=9
could be studied for the case of dual-carrier reception, as shown in figure
50. Although fast frequency synthesizers are assumed, the monitoring slot will
be a little bit shorter to allow for tuning from the Tx to the monitoring
frequency and from the monitoring to the Rx frequency. As figure 50 shows,
this concept is compatible with DTM. This allocation gives a gain of 80 % in
the overall throughput compared with a state of the art multislot class 12 MS
(sum = 5).
{width="5.767361111111111in" height="1.1152777777777778in"}
Figure 50: Example of higher multislot classes with effective sum=9\ using a
second receiver for downlink reception
If multi-carrier is not applied in the uplink, it would still be advantageous
if the MS was capable of alternating between the uplink carriers corresponding
to the allocated downlink carriers according to the dynamic allocation (see
subclause 7.5.2.2 for detailed description).
The multi-carrier operation is illustrated in figure 51, which shows a dual-
carrier mobile (4+1) multiplexed with two legacy mobiles (2+1). Note the
multiplexing of the dual-carrier MS on two uplink carriers.
{width="5.998611111111111in" height="1.6680555555555556in"}
Figure 51: Dual carrier multiplexing
### 7.6.2 Inter-carrier interleaving
This is investigated in clause 10.
### 7.6.3 Dual-carrier diversity
The same baseband signal is transmitted over two carrier frequencies. At the
receiver, the signals on the two carriers are converted to baseband, providing
two diversity branches.
### 7.6.4 Adaptation between dual carrier and receive diversity
In many cases, the dual-carrier on the downlink would be deployed in a network
that already supports the MS RX diversity. In order to guarantee the most
optimal utilization of network resources, it should be possible to switch
between the two modes. The performance evaluation of this scheme is studied in
clause 12.
### 7.6.5 Impacts to the mobile station
#### 7.6.5.1 Multiple narrowband receivers
There are different options for the implementation of the multi-carrier RF in
the MS receiver. One option, suitable mainly for a small number of carriers
(e.g. dual-carrier), is to have separate receiver chains for each carrier.
This means that the multi-carrier terminals exploit an architecture, where the
receiver branches can be tuned to different frequencies (see figure 52). The
receiver branches can use either the same antenna or separate antennas.
{width="3.60625in" height="2.129166666666667in"}
Figure 52: RF architecture for dual-carrier receiver with separate receiver
chains for each carrier
#### 7.6.5.2 Wideband receiver
Another option, mainly suitable for a larger number of carriers, is a wideband
receiver. This option may have additional impacts to the network since it may
be necessary to limit the carrier spacing of the multi-carrier assignment.
Also, blocking requirements may be an issue.
##### 7.6.5.2.1 Larger bandwidth
Simultaneous reception of n carriers would obviously imply larger bandwidth
for the receiver front-end. This is in itself a source for additional
complexity. However, it is difficult to assess such complexity without a clear
requirement on the width of the wideband front-end.
Given that most, if not all, of the GERAN carriers of the multi-carrier
allocation will effectively be MAIO\'s, the receiving interval (from the
lowest frequency carrier to the highest frequency carrier) might even be
variable. Obviously the receiver shall be dimensioned for the worst case.
Thus, it would be beneficial to establish some assumptions in that sense. In
other words:
  * Can there be any assumption on the maximum interval between carriers > for which the multi-carrier receiver shall be dimensioned for?
##### 7.6.5.2.2 Channel separation
As mentioned in a previous contribution (see [2] in subclause 7.12), channel
separation may be performed with known techniques, e.g. digitally.
However, it is important to note that the complexity of digital channel
separation is also dependent on the width of the wideband receiver, which
shall maintain the same C/N applicable today for GERAN (see note), which in
turn is likely to have an effect on power consumption.
NOTE: The C/N requirement for GERAN is 28 dB, while the C/N requirement for
WCDMA is 16 dB.
##### 7.6.5.2.3 Blocking requirements
Blocking requirements are described in 3GPP TS 45.005.
In-band blocking requirements are obviously defined assuming that there is one
\"useful\" carrier, and the receiver has to fulfil some blocking requirements
towards all frequencies higher and lower than the \"useful\" carrier.
This can be illustrated pictorially by figure 53, which refers to a \"small
MS\" in the GSM900 band.
{width="5.991666666666666in" height="1.8666666666666667in"}
Figure 53: In-band blocking requirements for a Rel-6 \"small MS\" in GSM900
It is very unlikely that a similar blocking requirement structure can be
maintained for a wideband multi-carrier receiver.
In essence, we would now have multiple \"useful signals\", around each of
which we should depict a structure as in figure 53. This is obviously not a
practicable option as we would end with drawing a blocking requirement on top
of a \"useful signal\".
Thus, it seems that blocking requirements should be relaxed. A qualitative
sketch of such relaxation is illustrated in figure 54.
{width="5.991666666666666in" height="1.8659722222222221in"}
Figure 54: Possible relaxation of blocking requirements for a multi-carrier
\"small MS\" in GSM900
Note that the \"grey area\" between the \"useful signals\" corresponds to the
area where the performance requirements for adjacent interference apply. A
redefinition of these requirements may also be needed, depending on the
respective spacing of the \"useful signals\".
Further, it is important to consider that, if the frequencies of \"useful
signals\" are effectively MAIO\'s, then also the respective spacing are
changing on a TDMA frame basis. Thus, it should be discussed
  * Whether any bound on the respective spacing of the multiple carriers > can be assumed.
  * How blocking should be defined (qualitatively) for a receiver > expected to receive multiple carriers at once (i.e. should it look > like figure 54?).
#### 7.6.5.3 Baseband
On baseband, the receiver is required to process multiple RLC/MAC blocks per
time slot. This requirement may have an impact on meeting the timing
requirements of baseband processing. The baseband complexity is directly
proportional to the number of carriers.
The support for multi-carrier incremental redundancy may have an impact on the
baseband design. In practice, it is required that the channel decoder of a
multi-carrier mobile is able to store and retrieve soft decisions from a
common pool of soft values.
## 7.7 Uplink Dual Carrier
### 7.7.1 Concept description for dual carrier on the uplink
Dual Carrier in the Uplink shall be operated in such a way that it is
compatible with legacy network operation. Multiplexing with existing GSM/EDGE
bearers and a minimized BSS impact should therefore be ensured according to
the objectives of the Feasibility Study.
It may be applied on non-hopping carriers as well as on hopping carriers. In
case of configured frequency hopping, independent frequency hopping sequences
are assumed to be present on both carriers.
### 7.7.2 Mobile Station Capabilities
The mobile station is required to include a second transmitter for Dual
Carrier in the Uplink. It is also possible that a second transmit antenna at
the mobile station might be necessary in order to avoid additional insertion
loss. The impacts on the mobile station are described in subclause 7.6.1.
### 7.7.3 Increase in Peak Data Rate
The performance gain in peak data rate can be up to 100 % for dual carrier.
Specifically, in interference limited scenarios which are typical for high
traffic densities, it is expected that dual carrier leads to a doubled average
data rate on UL. In sensitivity limited scenarios the average data rate may be
doubled for a large portion of cell locations. Depending on the mobile station
capabilities, even at the cell boundary an increase of the average data rates
can be achieved when compared to single carrier.
### 7.7.4 Decrease of Latency
The main impact on latency would be the decrease in delays due to the higher
bit rates that would be possible with dual carrier in the uplink. However, a
reduced TTI could also be implemented, bringing additional improvements for
the latency of small amounts of data. By using dual carrier on uplink with
inter carrier interleaving of the bursts to reduce the latency, air interface
latency of 10 ms could be achieved (see clause 10).
### 7.7.5 Impact on Cell Coverage
The cell coverage is dependent on the propagation conditions, the cell overlap
and the required Eb/No for a particular service.
At cell edges when 8PSK can not be supported, the GMSK transmission can be
used on two carriers with appropriate back off as pointed out in subclause
7.7.1 and thus data rates even at the cell edges can be improved when compared
to single carrier transmission.
### 7.7.6 Impacts to the mobile station
#### 7.7.6.1 RF Architecture options
Dual carrier requires duplication of the whole TX path e.g. from DSP to PA
including own VCOs for both carriers. The architecture for a Dual Carrier RF
in UL could be based on the following options:
A) Combined single carrier transmitters with single antenna.
B) Single carrier transmitters with separate antennas.
C) Wideband multicarrier transmitter with single antenna.
For a wideband multicarrier transmitter with single antenna architecture
option it may be challenging to keep intermodulation (IM) products and
spectral growth due to high PAR below acceptable level. Also, TX bandwidth may
be limited by DAC or used PA linearization technique. Efficiency may also be
significantly worse than with a single carrier transmitter options A) and B).
Restricting frequency spacing of carriers e.g. to 800 kHz would not be
compatible with the existing frequency definitions or any frequency planning
either.
{width="4.045138888888889in" height="2.0243055555555554in"}

Figure 57: RF architecture of Dual Carrier MS with wideband PA and single
antenna (Option C)
For option B, the Modified Concept for Uplink Dual Carrier (see subclause
7.7.3) could mean that no TX filters are required.
#### 7.7.6.2 Evaluation of option A and option B (Taken from GP-060188)
##### 7.7.6.2.1 Combining loss
With single antenna option A) a combiner is needed. Insertion loss of hybrid
combiner is about 3 dB to 3.5dB, and that loss should be included to the RF
loss budget in the architecture option A).
##### 7.7.6.2.2 Intermodulation (IM)
Intermodulation products, due to various mechanisms are a challenge for
systems with multiple carriers. Good isolation between transmitters is
essential to avoid IM products. In this subclause, so called reverse
intermodulation is assumed to have highest IM contribution.
Typically 3rd order IM results are dominating and those fall to the
frequencies 2 x f1- f2 and 2 x f2 - f1, where f1 and f2 are carrier
frequencies. Other products than 3rd order IM products may also exist e.g. sum
of 900 MHz carriers (f1+ f2~)~ may fall to the 1 800 band.
IM products may reduce link and system performance in uplink; furthermore IM
products falling to receiving band of MS may block adjacent MSs to perform DL
reception.
##### 7.7.6.2.2.1 Reverse Inter Modulation (RIM) {#reverse-inter-modulation-
rim .H6}
Reverse intermodulation products are generated in the transmitter by wanted
signal and external signal coming to transmitter\'s output port e.g. from an
adjacent transmitter. Typically the reverse IM is tested at -40 dBc level of
external signal thereby indicating needed level of isolation between
transmitters. With that 40dB isolation it\'s possible, but not trivial, to
obtain about -70 dBc IMD levels, e.g. to meet current spectrum due to
modulation limits at > 6 MHz offsets. Typical reverse IM attenuation in the
EDGE PAs is slightly above 20dB i.e. reverse IMD level is slightly less than
‑60 dBc at -40 dBc test level. Linearization of the PA would also improve the
reverse IM characteristics, however this would mean in practice lower
efficiency and higher current consumption.
The needed isolation may be reduced by amount of antenna isolation in case of
architecture option B) and by amount of antenna return loss in case of option
A). It needs to be noted that e.g. a hand on top of the MS antennas may reduce
the obtainable antenna isolation e.g. down to a level of 6 dB to 12 dB and
also reduce the antenna return loss e.g. down to a level of 6 dB to 12 dB.
Isolation of 12 dB is assumed in the following for both. Thus additional
isolation requirements are likely about the same \~30 dB to 40 dB for both
options with the same susceptibility of transmitter for reverse IM.
##### 7.7.6.2.2.1.1 Isolators {#isolators .H6}
This \~30 dB isolation requirement between transmitters should be taken into
account with both architecture options A) and B). It would mean e.g. to use
isolators at the transmitter output. Isolators are narrow band devices, thus
multiband MS should have separate isolators on lower and upper bands.
Furthermore 2 to 4 isolators may be needed in series because one provides
typically about 10 dB to 12dB isolation. These isolators introduce also
insertion loss e.g. 0.8 dB per isolator. For example quad band MS and dual
carrier transmitter MS could need up to 8 to 16 isolators.
##### 7.7.6.2.2.1.2 RX band rejection of TX filter {#rx-band-rejection-of-tx-
filter .H6}
Assuming IM level of -70dBc and spurious requirement of \ 0, then 3^rd^ order intermodulation
products are generated at;
  * f~a,3~ = f~1~ - ∆f; and
  * f~b,3~ = f~2~ + ∆f;
as well as 5^th^ order intermodulation products are generated at:
  * f~a,5~ = f~1~ - 2*∆f; and
  * f~b,5~ = f~2~ + 2*∆f.
In the following it is assumed that 3^rd^ order intermodulation products are
dominating and that it is sufficient to avoid that these fall into the RX
band. This assumption needs to be proven by measurements (see subclause
7.7.8.4).
The receive band of the mobile is always at higher frequencies than the
transmit band, hence the 3^rd^ order intermodulation product at f~b,3~ is of
interest here.
If the condition is satisfied that:
  * f~b,3~ \ mode = 0.8 + 0.8 = 1.6 dB (path 1).
  * Insertion loss in the lower TX path, reused for single carrier mode > = 0.5 + 0.8 + 0.8 = 2.1 dB (path 2).
It should be noted that the output power reduction caused by the insertion
losses is inside the allowed tolerance for 8‑PSK (±3 dB in low band). Hence
the nominal output power of 27 dBm in low band can still apply.
The following formulae based on 3GPP TS 45.005 are used according to
MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE 3 to calculate the actual output power depending on
the number of timeslots and the respective insertion loss:
  * Output power for normal EGPRS = min (27, [27 + 6 - > 10*log10(#Timeslots)]) dBm.
  * Output power for the TX path1 = min (27 - 1.6, [27 + 6 - > 10*log10(#Timeslots)]) dBm.
  * Output power for the TX path2 = min (27 - 2.1, [27 + 6 - > 10*log10(#Timeslots)]) dBm.
The throughput as a function of the number of used timeslots is shown in
figure 76.
{width="4.28125in" height="3.3465277777777778in"}
Figure 76: Throughput of dual carrier and single carrier EGPRS mobiles as a
function\ of the number of uplink timeslots under coverage limited conditions
The proposed architecture for an uplink dual carrier mobile provides almost
normal talk time in single carrier mode.
It can be seen that even under coverage limited conditions, very high uplink
throughputs can be achieved, and at the same number of uplink slots, the
throughput is almost as high as with a single carrier EGPRS MS.
In this subclause, the assumption has been made that the antenna imbalance is
zero. However, this is considered to be very optimistic; in particular, it may
not be economically feasible to build a mobile with very low antenna
imbalance.
### 7.7.9 Discussion on Uplink Coverage
#### 7.7.9.1 Introduction
In this subclause coverage aspects for some uplink proposals are discussed.
Coverage analysis includes multislot power reduction with different multislot
profiles and also impact of insertion losses e.g. due to duplexers and
isolators. Analyzed proposals include DSR, MDSR, UL DC with independent
carriers, modified UL DC with constrained frequency separation and Type-2 MS.
16QAM combined with turbo coding were not included, because no coverage gain
at median is shown so far. UL DC with wideband transmitter was also excluded,
because output power constraints due to IMD [12] will likely make this option
unviable for coverage improvements.
It should be noted that both capacity and coverage should be improved in a
balance, since performance in real networks is limited by both of them and
typically worst of them.
#### 7.7.9.2 Assumptions for power reductions and power consumption
Multi slot power reduction was taken into account by applying multi slot
profiles (0 and 3) for all the cases. For 8PSK modulation in the case of EGPRS
and DSR 4 dB power reduction was applied related to GMSK [9]. For MDSR 16QAM 6
dB power reduction was applied at highest power level and 4 dB for other
levels [10].
The uplink dual carrier has 5 dB lower output power related to EGPRS due to
IMD constraints [11] and [12]. The modified UL DC has 2 dB lower power related
to EGPRS. Multi slot power profiles were applied for UL DC so that actual
number of transmitted slots was divided by 2, although this leads to double
power consumption related to single carrier transmission. 3 dB duplexer loss
was assumed for Type-2 MS. Transmitter output powers versus number of time
slots are shown in figures 77 and 78.

### 7.7.10 Improvements for DTM and MBMS
This subclause highlights the additional gains for MBMS and DTM in terms of
added flexibility for resource allocation and additional downlink throughput
that can be obtained if mobile stations support dual carrier on the uplink.
#### 7.7.10.1 Assumptions
The following assumptions are made about the dual carrier technology
applicable to the MS:
  * The MS cannot transmit and receive in the same slot.
  * The MS can receive on both carriers on a given timeslot. (Dual > Carrier in the downlink).
  * The MS cannot transmit on any carrier on the slot immediately > following a slot it is receiving on (due to the timing advance).
  * The MS can receive on both receivers in a slot immediately after > transmitting.
  * Only one Tx->Rx and one Rx->Tx transition is allowed in a TDMA > frame per radio transceiver.
  * Frequency Hopping is used.
  * CS traffic takes up one DL+UL TS pair.
#### 7.7.10.2 Gains for DTM Multislot Capacity
With dual carrier only in the downlink, it is shown in [7] that the maximum
capacity for a downlink biased DTM call is 10 TSs for reception and up to 2
TSs for transmission (with sum = 12). For an uplink biased allocation the
corresponding figures are shown to be up to 4 TSs for reception and 5 TSs for
transmission ( with Sum = 9).

Figure 86: DL DTM DC Mobile Multislot Capability (DC in UL and DL)
With dual carrier transmission on the uplink it is possible to receive on 12
downlink TSs and transmit on 2 uplink TSs as shown in figure 86 (Sum = 14) as
the uplink PS TS can be provided in parallel with the uplink CS timeslot.
Similarly, for uplink biased asymmetric allocation, it is shown in [7] that it
is possible to receive on as many as 4 TSs and transmit on up to 10 TSs (Sum =
14).
In addition to gains for downlink throughput, there is also added flexibility
in resource allocation for the BSS. For a given number of DL or UL TSs, the
BSS can choose to allocate the required resources in a flexible way, as it now
has the option to allocate resources on two downlink and two uplink carriers.
There is an additional benefit that the unit of allocation now could be
smaller on each carrier. For instance, if 6 uplink time slots are needed for a
service, then it can be distributed among the two uplink carriers in many ways
(3+3 or 4+2, etc.). As described in subclause 7.7.10.3, this avoids the need
for any resource re-allocation during call setup thus reducing the signalling
load on the BSS.
#### 7.7.10.3 CS Connection setup while in packet transfer mode
According to the existing Rel-6 DTM behaviour, if the network wishes to
establish an SDCCH for CS connection set-up before allocating a TCH, the
likelihood is that the existing packet resources will first have to be moved
to be next to an SDCCH, and then moved again when a TCH is required for
speech. This involves two resource re-allocations which is inefficient in
terms of radio resource management and increases processing and signalling
load for the BSS.
Figure 87 shows how an SDCCH can be allocated on the second carrier pair (on
any free frequency) without disturbing existing packet resources on the first
carrier pair. The example shows 2 DL TSs and one UL TS allocated to packet
resources on the first carrier pair (f1, f3). The second carrier pair can be
changed by the network to select an appropriate TCH without disturbing the
existing PS resources.

#### 7.7.10.4 Gains for MBMS + CS
Increased capabilities of Mobile stations like dual carrier in DL/UL etc may
in the future allow users to receive MBMS and CS calls simultaneously.
Currently, it is not possible to support a CS call for any mobile which is
already receiving the MBMS session with feedback if the mobile is not capable
of transmitting or receiving on dual carrier.
If the mobile is capable of receiving on two carriers, then it is possible to
allow 1 mobile in the cell to have a CS call in parallel with the MBMS session
as shown in figure 88. This requires that PBCCH is deployed and has the same
hopping sequence as the MBMS carrier. It can be seen that in figure 88, the
frequency pairing for uplink and downlink has to be violated either for the
MBMS session or for the CS call.

### 7.7.11 Performance enhancing features
#### 7.7.11.1 Intercarrier Interleaving
##### 7.7.11.1.1 Introduction
Diagonal intercarrier interleaving can be used to gain additional frequency
diversity for dual carrier transmission on the uplink (see clause 10 on the
use of intercarrier interleaving for reducing latency). This concept is likely
not applicable as-it-is on the downlink because, downlink is a shared channel
and old and new mobiles shall be multiplexed on the same shared channel on the
downlink and hence, the header (and in particular the Uplink State Flag (USF))
can not be interleaved across the carriers because of interworking
requirements with legacy mobiles. Hence to extend the concept to downlink it
might be necessary to leave the header and the USF bits as-they-are now and
perhaps interleave only the data across the carriers.
On the uplink, diagonal interleaving across two carriers is used for this
purpose. The header and the payload data are interleaved across the two
carriers. The interleaving scheme used is based on existing block rectangular
interleaving defined for MCS schemes with a different burst mapping to achieve
the diagonal interleaving across two carriers on the uplink. The interleaved
blocks are redistributed across the two carriers on the uplink as shown in
figure 90.

##### 7.7.11.1.2.1 Used Simulation Parameters {#used-simulation-parameters
.H6}
Simulations are performed for TU50 channel model for receiver sensitivity
case. Initial simulations show the performance comparison for MCS-5 and MCS-6
with and without intercarrier interleaving. Both ideal frequency hopping and
no frequency hopping cases are simulated.
##### 7.7.11.1.2.2 Impairments {#impairments .H6}
Transmitter and receiver impairments have not been included in the currently
presented set of simulation results.
##### 7.7.11.1.2.3 Simulation Results {#simulation-results .H6}
The results presented here are only for the sensitivity limited scenarios as
the sensitivity limited scenarios are of main concern when applying dual
carrier on the uplink as there is a reduced power transmission on the uplink.
It can be observed in figure 91 for a non frequency hopping channel and in
figure 92 for a frequency hopping channel that gains of around 1 dB (for 10 %
BLER) to 2dB (for 1 % BLER) could be obtained by using intercarrier
interleaving for uplink dual carrier. Intercarrier interleaving shows high
link level gains for lower MCS. The gain will be reduced as the amount of
coding reduces with higher MCS. However it is expected that when incremental
redundancy is used, even higher MCS schemes will show some gains for
subsequent retransmissions.

#### 7.7.11.2 Advanced Coding Schemes
Advanced coding schemes like turbo coding [5] etc are known to perform better
with longer input block lengths. Further link level gains are foreseen with
dual carrier transmission on uplink with turbo coding. The idea is to
compensate the loss in coverage due to reduced power transmission of the MS
using additional link level gains.
Doubled block sizes can be used with dual carrier transmission on the uplink
and this, when combined with the additional frequency diversity that can be
obtained using intercarrier interleaving, is expected to compensate for the
loss in power due to additional backoff at the MS.
## 7.8 Impacts to the BSS
Multi-carrier is expected to have no impact on EDGE transceivers, but the BSS
needs to perform data transfer (possibly including incremental redundancy
transmission), resource allocation and link control for more than one carrier.
Dual Carrier in the UL enables maximum reuse of the existing BSS
infrastructure, avoiding HW impacts both to the BTS and BSC. Some SW impacts
are foreseen due to the need of combining the data streams over both carriers
if intercarrier interleaving is used. Incremental redundancy if no
intercarrier interleaving is applied will be dedicated to one carrier and
hence operate as for the single carrier approach. If intercarrier interleaving
is in operation, it is required that the soft decision values of the
transmission and retransmission related to a particular RLC block can be
exchanged between the transceivers. The complexity increase in the BTS is
reduced to combining the data streams of both receivers. A doubled data rate
must be supported by Abis as well.
## 7.9 Impacts to the Core Network
No changes are expected to the core network except that new capabilities shall
be signalled by the MS to the network. For DC in the uplink, no further
changes to Gb interface are required.
## 7.10 Radio network planning aspects
### 7.10.1 Analysis for Option C
#### 7.10.1.1 Introduction
Due to the issues and complexity regarding dual carrier in uplink with two
separate transmitters, the use of a wideband transmitter has been proposed in
order to simplify the implementation (see subclause 7.7.11.4).
The maximum carrier separation for a wideband transmitter is estimated to be 1
MHz. The impact of this limitation on the legacy frequency planning is
described in this subclause.
#### 7.10.1.2 Legacy Frequency Planning
There exists a number of different frequency planning techniques all depending
on numerous parameters as e.g. geographical environment, traffic load,
frequency hopping etc. In this report we will focus on two main techniques -
Fractional Load Planning (FLP) and Multiple Reuse Planning (MRP).
**FLP:** A FLP network is planned with two or more frequency groups, one for
the non-hopping BCCH and one or several for the hopping TCHs. The BCCH is
normally planned with a 4/12 or sparser reuse whiles the hopping TCHs normally
is planned with a 1/1 or 1/3 reuse.
The available frequency spectrum can either be divided in blocks between the
BCCH and the TCHs or it can be evenly spread between them.
**MRP:** The fundamental idea with MRP is to apply different reuse patterns
with different degrees of tightness. MRP uses base-band frequency hopping,
which means that the number of transceivers in a cell is equal to the number
of assigned frequencies. A benefit with MRP is that the BCCH can be included
in the hopping sequence. In figure 93 it is shown how the available frequency
spectrum is divided into different frequency groups. The number of frequency
groups corresponds to the maximum number of transceivers in a cell.
{width="4.509722222222222in" height="0.9159722222222222in"}
Figure 93: Frequency planning using MRP technique
#### 7.10.1.3 Impact of Wideband transmitter on legacy frequency planning
The maximum carrier separation in a wideband transmitter is e.g. 1 MHz, due to
InterModulation (IM) products and the linearization of the PA. From a system
point-of-view there is a requirement on the minimum carrier separation in
order to ensure a certain quality level in a cell. The minimum carrier
separation is 400 kHz (measured from the centre of each carrier), i.e.
adjacent frequencies should not be used in the same cell.
One drawback with the limited carrier separation is in the case of inter-
carrier interleaving, where a reduced carrier separation will have negative
impact on the frequency diversity.
##### 7.10.1.3.1 FLP-1/1 or 1/3
When considering frequency planning for a wideband transmitter there is no
difference between the 1/1-frequency reuse or 1/3. Two different cases have
been considered for the FLP network: in the first case both carriers are
placed in the same TCH hopping group and in the second case one of the
carriers is placed on the BCCH.
##### 7.10.1.3.1.1 Both Carriers in the TCH hopping group {#both-carriers-in-
the-tch-hopping-group .H6}
In figure 94 a blocked configuration is used and each cell has two
transceivers in the TCH hopping group. There are two different Mobile
Allocation alternatives, and only alternative 2 is applicable for dual carrier
in the uplink with a wideband transmitter.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="4.134722222222222in"}
Figure 94: Different Mobile Allocation alternatives in a FLP network
However, also with alternative 2 there will be occasions when the separation
between the carriers is too large. For example this will occur when carrier 1
is using ARFCN 12 and carrier 2 is using ARFCN 2 (due to wrap-around). This
problem can be avoided if the allocated Hopping Frequency Set (HFS) for one of
the two TRXs is slightly modified, see figure 95.
{width="4.654861111111111in" height="3.0756944444444443in"}
Figure 95: Two different HFS are used in a cell to avoid a too large carrier
separation\ for a dual carrier in uplink configuration
##### 7.10.1.3.1.2 One of the carriers on the BCCH {#one-of-the-carriers-on-
the-bcch .H6}
If the two carriers are separated between the BCCH and the TCH hopping group
it will be more or less impossible to fulfil the requirement on the maximum
carrier separation. If the requirement is to be fulfilled in this
configuration the MS must be able to support a carrier separation that is
equal to the total bandwidth of the BCCH and TCH group. In the example in
figure 96 the requirement on the maximum carrier separation is 5 MHz.
{width="4.625in" height="1.6854166666666666in"}
Figure 96: Maximum carrier separation when the two carriers are placed\ in
different frequency groups
If one of the carriers shall be configured on the BCCH there is only one
alternative left and that is to allocate a new non-hopping frequency to the
cell. This will require a re-planning of the BCCH frequencies and will require
that the operator has more frequencies than needed today, otherwise the total
capacity in the system will be reduced. An example of this configuration is
shown in figure 97.
{width="5.075in" height="1.426388888888889in"}
Figure 97: An extra frequency group with the same reuse as the BCCH has been
added\ to comply with the requirement on maximum carrier separation
##### 7.10.1.3.2 MRP
Most MRP networks are including the BCCH frequency in the hopping set, the
separation between two carriers in a MRP cell is therefore >> 1 MHz. This
makes it impossible to include dual carrier in uplink using a wideband
transmitter in a MRP network.
However, if a re-planning of the frequencies is allowed it could be possible
to have two non-hopping carriers with the same sparse reuse as the BCCH in a
cell. This is the same solution as described at the end of subclause
7.10.1.3.1.2. An example of this solution for an MRP network is presented in
figure 98, the same frequency spectrum as in figure 93 is used.

#### 7.10.1.4 Extended frequency allocation
##### 7.10.1.4.1 Introduction
A conclusion from subclause 7.10.1.3 is that in some networks it will be
rather tricky to implement dual carrier in uplink using a wideband transmitter
without any impact to the legacy frequency planning. A solution that removes
this obstacle is therefore investigated in this subclause. Note that some
operators do not consider Extended Frequency Allocation described here as
feasible due to the high impact on frequency planning.
##### 7.10.1.4.2 Description of Extended Frequency Allocation
The idea with the solution is to temporarily assign an uplink frequency for
carrier two that is within the maximum carrier separation to carrier one. This
temporarily used frequency does not need to be a frequency that is normally
allocated in the cell. This solution will work in all kinds of networks and
there is no impact on the legacy frequency planning. However, simulations are
needed in order to estimate the impact on the system performance.
Two examples of this solution are shown in figures 99 and 100. In the first
example (figure 99) both carriers are allocated in a TCH hopping group and in
the second example the carriers are divided between the BCCH and the TCH
hopping group.
In figure 99 it is illustrated how this would work in a FLP network when both
carriers are placed in the TCH hopping group.

carrier separation of 600 kHz
##### 7.10.1.4.3 Impact of EFA on the BTS
EFA shall only be applied to the timeslots that are used by dual carrier in
uplink and the duplex distance can therefore be different between the
timeslots within a TRX. The impact of changed duplex distance can be
implementation dependent and needs to be investigated by each network vendor.
In the Ericsson BTS there is no problem to handle the change of duplex
distance as the TX and RX part of a TRX can have different frequency lists
allocated. When EFA is used the RX part will receive two different frequency
allocation lists, one to use in normal mode and one to use in EFA mode.
In some BTS configurations there are requirements on minimum frequency
separation when distributing several frequencies on to the same antenna. This
requirement is related to the combiner on the TX side and should therefore not
been an issue for EFA. In figure 101 is a diagram over the different filters
that are used in the BTS.
{width="5.375in" height="3.25625in"}

The splitter on the RX side has no problem to handle adjacent frequencies.
##### 7.10.1.4.2.1 Non-frequency hopping {#non-frequency-hopping .H6}
The use of EFA with a fixed frequency has already been described in subclause
7.10.1.4.2, but in this subclause is an example with EFA in a network with a
frequency reuse of 12 presented. Each cell in table 32 has two TRXs with a
frequency reuse of 12, but when resources are assigned for dual carrier in
uplink this reuse distance is decreased for the uplink. The cells with the
same letter belong to the same site. Simulations have been performed to
evaluate how large impact this decrease in frequency reuse has on the system
performance, results from these simulations are shown in subclause 7.10.1.5.

##### 7.10.1.4.2.2 Frequency Hopping {#frequency-hopping .H6}
It has already been shown in subclause 7.10.1.3 that dual carrier in uplink
could work in a network using synthesized frequency hopping and legacy
frequency allocation. However, it could be needed to decrease the number of
frequencies allocated per TRX in order to avoid the \"wrap-around\" problem.
If this reduction in allocated frequencies is not possible in a network an
alternative solution could be to use EFA as described in figure 102.
{width="5.989583333333333in" height="4.051388888888889in"}
Figure 102: How EFA should work when frequency hopping is used
Both carriers in figure 102 have the same MAIO but carrier two has an
additional frequency offset of 400 kHz. The sign of the additional frequency
offset for carrier two is changed when a frequency above the highest allocated
frequency is to be used. In this way it is ensured that the dual carrier in
uplink MS will not use other operators\' frequency spectrum.
**Baseband hopping:**
In figure 103 is the method described in the previous text applied to a
baseband frequency hopping cell. The TX part has only one configured frequency
at baseband frequency hopping, the different bursts for a connection must
therefore be distributed between the different TXs to achieve frequency
hopping in the downlink. The RX part of a TRX is only used by the MSs that has
been assigned resources on that particular TRX.

frequency hopping.

All TXs are configured with the same frequencies and is only separated with a
MAIO value. The RX part is the same as for baseband frequency hopping.
##### 7.10.1.4.3 Separation of carriers
Different separation between the carriers can be needed in order to avoid co-
channel and adjacent channel interference within a site.
#### 7.10.1.5 Evaluation of network performance
##### 7.10.1.5.1 Setup
Simulations have been performed to evaluate the system impact from the
introduction of dual carrier in uplink with EFA. The following settings have
been used.
* * *
Frequency reuse 12 Sectors (cells) per site 3 Number of TCH frequencies 36
(7.2 MHz), not including BCCH Number of cells simulated 75 + wrap around IRC
No Cell radius 500 m Frequency Hopping No Rayleigh fading Yes Coherence
Bandwidth 1 MHz Frequency Band 900 MHz Log-normal fading standard deviation 8
dB Log-normal fading correlation distance 110 m Simulation time 200 s Terminal
speed 3 m/s
* * *
The service mix was 80 % speech users and 20 % data users, where data users
were one of EDGE, or Dual Carrier EDGE, in two different scenarios. Speech and
data users were modeled as:
  * Speech users: Normal speech users on 1TS, with DTX on and Power > control.
  * EDGE users: Continuous transmission on 1TS, no Power control and > output power 27 dBm.
  * Dual Carrier EDGE users: Simply by doubling the EDGE load, i.e. in > practice twice as many EDGE users. Output power for dual carrier > is 2 × 21 dBm.
##### 7.10.1.5.2 Results
The results are presented in the form of a CDF of the uplink C/I distribution
for the speech users of each case. C/I is averaged over measurement periods of
480 ms.
{width="5.989583333333333in" height="4.40625in"}
Figure 105: C/I distribution for speech users in a network with a frequency
reuse of 12\ The dashed line is for dual carrier in uplink with EFA
From figure 105 it can be seen that the negative impact of dual carrier in
uplink and EFA is very small, and instead an improvement can be seen for
almost the whole C/I range. The improvement comes from the reduced output
power for dual carrier in uplink and it is the connections that had good
quality before that is improved. What it is more important is that the
percentage of samples with a C/I below 10 dB has not increased, this indicates
that speech quality can be maintained in a network at introduction of dual
carrier in uplink with EFA.
## 7.11 Impacts to the specifications
The impacted 3GPP specifications are listed in 33.

several carriers).

# 8 Higher Order Modulation and Turbo Codes
## 8.1 Introduction
Higher order modulations should be considered as a candidate to increase peak
rates and, more importantly, to increase the mean bit rates. Convolutional
coding is currently used for MCS coding for packet service over EGPRS. As a
replacement to these within Future GERAN Evolution, Turbo Coding schemes can
also be considered as a candidate to increase the mean bit rates.
This subclause analyses the impact of introducing higher order modulation
based on QAM and Turbo coding in EGPRS. Simulations to evaluate link
performance have taken reasonable practical impairments in the receiver and
transmit implementations into consideration.
## 8.2 Concept Description
The coding and modulation schemes that are already available for the current
EDGE system are enhanced with the introduction of higher order modulations and
Turbo coding. Since the higher order modulations enable higher data rates, new
coding schemes may also be introduced.
### 8.2.1 Higher Order Modulations
#### 8.2.1.1 Square 16QAM Modulation
New modes for MCS-8 and MCS-9 schemes are introduced that use 16-QAM
modulation. With the same payload, 16‑QAM allows lower coding rate (as it
enables a higher modem bit rate). Note that 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM
modulations allow modem bit rates of 1224, 1688 and 2152 per block
respectively (excluding the RLC/MAC header bits, USF and stealing bits). The
payloads for MCS-8 and MCS-9 are 2X564 = 1128 and 2X612 = 1224 (including the
CRC bits) respectively. Therefore, 8-PSK with MCS-8 coding scheme allows a
coding rate of 1128/1224 = 0.92, whereas 16-QAM modulation allows a coding
rate of 1128/1688 = 0.67. More coding power introduces more diversity, and
thus achieving significant gains over existing EDGE schemes.
Similarly, for MCS-9 coding scheme, using 16-QAM instead of 8-PSK enables
lower rate coding 0.73 instead of 1.00.
The new proposed coding schemes MCS-10 and MCS-11 use higher order modulations
with increased data rates.
The data and coding rates for a number of possible alternative schemes can be
found in table 34, together with the current EGPRS coding schemes.
Table 34: Coding configurations and parameters for modified and new coding
schemes proposed.

The information bits are always coded using convolutional coding with coding
rate of1/3 and constraint length of 7. The coded bits are then punctured using
uniform puncturing to obtain desired coding rate.
The signal constellations for QAM are used in figure 106. The bits are mapped
to the symbols using Gray mapping.

Figure 106: Signal constellations for QAM. Left: 16QAM. Right: 32QAM
The Peak-to Average-Ratio (PAR) for different modulation constellations is
shown in table 35.
Table 35: PAR for different modulations
* * *
Modulation PAR (dB) 8-PSK with 3π/8 rotation 3.3 16-QAM 5.9 16-QAM with π/4
rotation 5.3 32-QAM 5.7
* * *
The PAR of 32 QAM is lower than that of 16 QAM due to the shaping gain of the
32-QAM cross arrangement. There are other methods to modify the modulations to
reduce the PAR, e.g. PAR for Q-O-QAM is 4.6 dB, see Feasibility report on EDGE
[4].
In simulations for Implementation B (see subclause 8.3), 45 deg shifted
constellation for 16-QAM has been used, but this has no impact on PAR.
#### 8.2.1.2 Other 16-ary Modulations
The performance of square 16QAM modulation and Turbo coding schemes (HOMTC)
has been evaluated [14], [12], [9]. It has been shown to have much improved
performance as compared with EGPRS. However, inherent in using a square 16QAM
constellation, there are some practical implementation issues that arise.
  * The higher peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) typically requires a > larger backoff of the PA at maximum output power; This affects > coverage areas in noise-limited environments. The 99.99 % PAPR of > square 16QAM is higher by about 2dB than that of 8PSK.
  * The higher backoff may also cause issues when using 16QAM on the > BCCH channel. See [33], [45] and subclause 8.7b for more > details.
  * The dynamic range of square 16QAM modulation reaches 40dB. This > leads to wider linearity range requirements in the RF front end, > and may be more difficult to implement on legacy BTSs.
A comparison of circular 16APK (Amplitude Phase Keying) constellations (see
[34] and [35]) to the square 16QAM constellation is presented in subclause
8.7.
#### 8.2.1.3 32QAM Modulation
16QAM and circular 16-ary modulation schemes for enhancements in GERAN
Evolution [9], [12] and [14]. 32QAM modulation is considered as an additional,
and possibly alternative, modulation to 16QAM. 32QAM presents the opportunity
to achieve higher peak throughput bit rates, and possibly also more robust
channel coding schemes for existing MCSs.
The 32QAM constellation used in implementation D is shown in figure 107. The
constellation follows the structure described in [40]. It is a cross
constellation that has almost Gray coding between adjacent symbols in the
constellation.
A rotation of the 32QAM constellation is applied between symbol periods, as
was done for 8PSK and the square 16QAM modulation, in order to avoid
transition through the origin between symbols. The rotation used is π/4.

Figure 107: 32 QAM Cross Constellation
### 8.2.2 Channel Coding
Much work has been done within the framework of 3GPP RAN standardization with
Turbo coding. This chapter takes the turbo coding scheme, and subsequent rate
matching as it is used in RAN [15].
The reference configuration used is the existing EGPRS coding schemes MCS-1 to
MCS-9. This is compared to the performance of Turbo Coding schemes with the
same coding rate.
The performance of convolutional coding with 16-QAM modulation is also
considered.
Also, it is known in the literature that, unlike Convolutional coding schemes,
the performance of turbo codes tends to improve with source code block length.
The basic simulations were extended to investigate the potential of this
property. Doubling of the source code block length was considered.
### 8.2.3 Symbol Mapping and Interleaving
For non-MCS coding schemes, rectangular interleaving is done across the
bursts. For basic block, it is done across 4 bursts. For a doubling of the
source code word, interleaving across 8 bursts is used to transmit the block.
Bit-wise interleaving is performed. The structure for interleaving over 8
bursts, and the structure for interleaving for 16-QAM modulation are similar
to that for EGPRS interleaving.
Further performance enhancement is achieved by introducing a symbol mapping
method of turbo coded bits for 16‑QAM modulation in order to improve the
performance of such turbo coded systems. The symbol mapping follows the rule
that systematic bits are assigned into higher reliability positions while
parity bits into lower reliability positions on 16-QAM symbols. This symbol
mapping method has already been included as part of the coding chain for
HS‑DSCH [15]. For further details and for simulation results see subclause
8.5.
### 8.2.4 Header Block
The header block would most likely require modification. Since the header is
relatively short, a change from Convolutional to Turbo coding is probably not
relevant. However, some improvement of the header coding may be required to be
properly aligned with the improvement in the performance of the data block
reception. This aspect is left for further study.
### 8.2.5 USF Signaling
The USF signaling to instruct transmission from MS would probably not be
affected for a finally selected scheme for 8‑PSK modulation.
For 16-QAM modulation a stronger block code would have to be devised to
maintain robustness, and the network would probably be limited for the case
that it was required to signal to legacy mobiles that support only EGPRS. This
is similar to the case today for GPRS-only legacy mobiles in a EGPRS
environment.
### 8.2.6 Link Adaptation
The current mechanism for EGPRS link adaptation is based on BEP reporting. BEP
measurements are independent of specific coding scheme used as it essentially
estimates the expected uncoded BER. So it is anticipated that the current BEP
scheme could be utilized with appropriate modifications to the link adaptation
mapping.
### 8.2.7 Incremental Redundancy Combining
The current mechanism for incremental redundancy combining is based on a
\"family\" of MCSs where the members of the family have multiples of a basic
payload unit [7]. A modified form of this could be used for Turbo codes MCSs.
### 8.2.8 Multislot Classes
For configurations that interleave a block over 4 bursts, there should be no
need for modifications to the Multislot classes. There may be a need for
additional multislot class to support signalling of configurations that
interleave across dual carriers.
### 8.2.9 Non-core Components
The components described below are not necessary to the core concept of turbo
coding within GERAN. However, during the work we observed, particularly for
16-QAM modulation, that the combined effect together with Turbo coding was
greater than the sum of the parts. They have therefore been included as sub-
components as an addition to the core concept, and the combined performance is
also reported.
#### 8.2.9.1 Dual Carrier
The dual carrier concept has been described in detail in [7]. We have
investigated the improvement in throughput performance that can be obtained by
defining a configuration where the turbo-coded RLC block is interleaved
between the different carriers (or hopping sequences). This is a specific
example of doubling the source block length which can fit within the same TTI
and be interleaved over 8 essentially decorrelated bursts.
It is considered unlikely that a dual carrier configuration would be deployed
on 2 carriers in the non-hopping layer. However, as a lower limit, the
performance under these conditions is considered.
Note, it is instructive to consider what frequency separation is needed in
order to have carrier channels that can be considered as largely independent
for fast fading. For channels such as TU which has rms delay spread of \~1 µs,
which corresponds to a coherence bandwidth of \~160 kHz, significant
decorrelation may be assumed for channels even 600 kHz apart.
#### 8.2.9.2 MS Receiver Diversity
The potential interdependence of performance enhancements of MSRD and Higher
order modulations (with or without Turbo coding) has been investigated in
reference [26], when the features are used simultaneously. A particular aim
was to assess whether 16QAM/TC would bring a similar improvement also in the
case of MSRD, i.e. whether the gains from 16QAM/TC and MSRD are additive.
Furthermore, the performance of 16QAM/TC EGPRS in a sensitivity limited
environment is shown, taking into account the additional back off for 16QAM
modulated radio blocks.
These issues are presented in subclause 8.6.
## 8.3 Modelling Assumptions and Requirements
The impairments include typical imperfections like I/Q modulator/demodulator
imbalance, receiver and transmitter synthesizer (phase) noise, frequency error
and non-linear characteristics of the power amplifier.
The impairment models used for the simulations are described in SMG2 EDGE
workshop contributions from Toulouse meeting March 1999 (see reference [3] and
[4]).
The frequency error is added as a rotation of the received signal.
The impairments in I/Q modulator and demodulator (gain imbalance and phase
imbalance) are added.
The phase noise (synthesizer impairment) is added as a normal distributed AWGN
source filtered through a low pass filter.
The power amplifier (PA) is characterized by amplitude and phase transfer
characteristics, and it is memoryless.
Simulations from different sources have used different assumptions. The sets
of assumptions are denoted Implementation set A, Implementation set B,
Implementation set C and Implementation D in the following. Further details
are found for Implementation set A are described in reference [1] and [17],
for Set B in reference [7], for set C in reference [6] and [8], and for set D
in reference [11], [12], [13] and [14].
### 8.3.1 Transmitter Impairments
The transmitter impairments that are used in this report are:
  * IQ phase imbalance (phase deviation from 90 degrees between I and Q) > and IQ gain imbalance (gain difference between I and Q) which are > due to the I/Q modulator that produces the analogue baseband > signal from the I and Q signals;
  * Phase noise due to the synthesizer that converts the baseband signal > into an RF signal;
  * Non-linearities in the Power Amplifier (PA) that introduces a > certain EVM and phase noise depending on the back off (PA back > off) from the 1-dB compression point.
The following values have been used in the simulations.
Table 36: TX impairments

The average EVM values are calculated by averaging the EVM values among all
the blocks. The average EVM measures depend on the transmitted impairments as
well as the modulation method. One major factor that contributes to the EVM
measurement is the PA back off. Table 37 shows the average EVM values with
different PA back off values and modulations for the PA model used in TX
impairment set A.

### 8.3.2 Receiver Impairments
The receiver impairments that are used in this report are:
  * the I/Q demodulator has IQ phase and gain imbalances as in the > transmitter;
  * the receiver synthesizer introduces phase noise like the transmitter > synthesizer;
  * the frequency error can be seen as a constant frequency offset > between the reference oscillator and the received signal.

### 8.3.3 Equalizer
**Set A:** A DFSE is used, where 2-taps are handled by MLSE and the rest of
the taps are handled by DFE structure. In 8‑PSK modulation the number of
states is 8, while in 16-QAM and 32-QAM, the number of states are 16 and 32,
respectively.
**Set B:** The equalizer utilizes the reduced-state sequence estimation (RSSE)
with set partitioning, the number of states being 16 for 16-QAM and 4 for
8-PSK. The trellis length is one for both modulations.
**Set C:** A 4-state RSSE receiver has been used. The complexity of the 16QAM
RSSE is just 20 % higher than a conventional 8-PSK receiver.
**Set D:** DFSE is used, where 2-taps are handled by MLSE and the rest of the
taps are handled by DFE structure. In 8‑PSK modulation the number of states is
8, while in 16-QAM the number of states is 16.
## 8.4 Performance Characterization
### 8.4.1 Implementation Set A
Source: reference [1] and [6].\ Implementation set A evaluates the performance
of introduction of higher order modulation only using the EGPRS convolutional
channel coding. This is now superseded by other implementations where the
performance is evaluated for Higher Order Modulation as well as combination of
Higher Order Modulation and Turbo Codes (HOMTC).
#### 8.4.1.1 Modelling assumptions and requirements
The results are obtained in a co-channel interference limited environment.
A Typical urban channel with 3 km/h mobile speed (TU-3) at 900 MHz carrier
frequency is considered.
Single transmit and receive antenna receivers are used.
A linerarised GMSK pulse shaping filter with BT product 0.3 was used.
Blind detection for different modulation schemes is not considered in the
simulations (i.e. it is assumed that the modulation scheme that is used in the
transmitter is known by the receiver). An evaluation of blind detection
performance can be found in subclause 8.7a.
#### 8.4.1.2 Comparison of BLER Performance
The results indicate that higher order modulations are more sensitive to the
impairments compared to 8-PSK modulation for the same back off. However, a
good alternative is to increase the back off for QAM modulations to a level
that maintains constant impairment. According to our calculations in table 36
the back off value of 6.3 dB for the QAM modulations is selected.
Figures 108 and-109 show block-error-rate (BLER) results for constant EVM. The
results are obtained with different PA back offs for 8PSK and 16 QAM and
identical average EVM values. Significant amounts of gain are observed with
MCS-8 and MCS-9 coding schemes. For example, gains of 4 dB and 5.5 dB with
respect to the 8PSK equivalents are observed when 16 QAM is used. The results
show that with transmit and receiver impairments 16-QAM and 32-QAM modulations
perform well subject to back off being increased.
Figures 110 and 111 plot the performance of the new coding schemes MCS-10 and
MCS-11 with different modulation schemes. It is seen that 32-QAM, if used,
should give better performance for both these coding schemes.

Higher order modulation than 32 QAM was not considered relevant any longer, as
the impact of impairments was very high.
#### 8.4.1.3 Link Performance with Link Adaptation
Link performance for three cases with modified and new modulation schemes
according to table 39 including the impact of transmitter/receiver impairments
are investigated and compared to existing 8-PSK.

The throughput of case A-D is shown the figure 112. Note that the rightmost
parts of the curves (the thin part of the curves) are extrapolated. Simulation
results for this region need to be provided.
{width="4.375in" height="3.28125in"}
Figure 112: Throughput vs. C/I with transmitter/receiver impairments in TU3
Figure 112 plots the improvement of throughput (calculated as 1-error rate)
with link adaptation. It is seen that significant increases in throughput are
observed over the range of C/I where EDGE will currently be used.
#### 8.4.1.4 System Simulation Results
Systems simulations have been performed with no impairments included. These
are not included in this subclause, as we need to consider the impact of
impairments comparable with existing HW.
No system simulation results including impairment consideration are available
today. To further estimate the throughput gains in this case, the link results
were mapped to the C/I distribution measured in live network, presented by
TeliaSonera in GP-042355 [5]. The resulting CDF is shown below.
{width="3.9791666666666665in" height="3.134027777777778in"}
Figure 113: Estimated throughput CDF by mapping link performance with
impairments\ to C/I distribution of live TeliaSonera network
From this curves the median value of the throughput increase is estimated to
be 13 % in case B and about the same for case C and D. For the 10 percentile
with best C/I the improvement increases 18 % in case B. The additional
improvement in case C and D is very small in this scenario as the increase in
peak rate is effective for C/I> 24 dB and there are very few reported values
in this C/I range. Thus the addition of MCS-10 (16-QAM or 32-QAM) and MCS-11
(32-QAM) will contribute very little to the overall improvement. This could be
different for other scenarios. It is anyway worth noting that the main part of
the gain is found when improving MCS-8 and MCS-9 codings by replacing 8-PSK
with 16QAM.
The CDF of C/I above indicates very few occurrences of C/I above 22 dB. This
would indicate little use of MCS-9 in such an environment, but this is not the
case in reality. Probably this is due to limited reporting capability of the
measuring device for high C/I. The Telia measurements are based on measuring
equipment optimised for good accuracy in the C/I range less than 20 dB. The
accuracy above 20 dB is lower and probably the equipment does not distinguish
between 25 and 30 dB C/I. To find a CDF describing the real situation better,
a CDF from simulations of a similar 3/9 frequency reuse scenario with
approximately the same mean C/I value is used. The table below summarises the
system parameters:

Blocking limit 2 %

The resulting CDF is shown in figure 114. To be able to map link throughput
curves to this C/I mapping, the effects of fast fading are not included in the
C/I distribution (since fast fading is modeled in the link level simulations).

Mapping the link results in figure 112 on this CDF results in the estimated

above 30 dB, the throughput distribution for the 13 % best users is
preliminary in figure 115)

### 8.4.2 Implementation B
Source: Reference [7].
#### 8.4.2.1 Introduction
The impact of the following factors is evaluated:
  * Frequency hopping.
  * Incremental redundancy.
  * Propagation environment.
  * RX and TX impairments.
  * RRC pulse shaping: Linearized Gaussian pulse (BT=0.3) or Root-raised > cosine pulse (rolloff=0.3).
#### 8.4.2.2 Basic Link Layer Performance
The purpose of this subclause is to assess the basic link layer performance of
the 16-QAM coding schemes. The simulations are carried out without frequency
hopping, impairments, and incremental redundancy, which are separately
evaluated in the later subclauses. The applied pulse shaping method is
linearized Gaussian (BT=0.3).
##### 8.4.2.2.1 BER Performance
The raw BER performance is illustrated in the figure 117. As can be seen,
16-QAM is approximately 2 dB to 3 dB less sensitive than 8-PSK.
{width="5.64375in" height="3.665277777777778in"}
Figure 117: Raw BER (TU3nFH\@900MHz, no impairments)
##### 8.4.2.2.2 BLER Performance
The BLER performance of the three highest MCSs is shown in figures 118, 119
and 120 and summarized in table 41.
{width="5.648611111111111in" height="3.670138888888889in"}

As can be seen, the gain due to 16-QAM modulation is approximately 2 dB for
MCS-9, 1 dB for MCS-8, and 0 dB for MCS-7.
##### 8.4.2.2.3 Throughput
The slot-wise throughput is illustrated in figure 121. As can be seen from the
figure, 16-QAM brings some improvement to the range of medium and high CIR
values, the throughput gain varying between 0 and 10 %. The applied LA
switching points are marked with squares.

Figure 121: Throughput (TU3nFH\@900MHz, no impairments, ideal LA)
#### 8.4.2.3 Impact of Frequency Hopping
The results from the frequency hopping simulations are shown in Appendix A and
summarized in tables 42 and 43. Due to the lower coding rate and increased
interleaving depth, the FH gain is larger for 16-QAM than for 8‑PSK. It is
good to note that also MCS-8 and MCS-9 benefit from the frequency hopping in
the case of 16-QAM.

The FH gain is also illustrated in figure 122, which shows the throughput for
both modulation methods with and without FH. As can be seen, the throughput
gain is approximately 0 to 20 % in the case of FH, while in the case of nFH it
is only 0 to 10 %.

Figure 122: Impact of frequency hopping (TU3nFH/iFH\@900MHz, no impairments,
ideal LA)
#### 8.4.2.4 Impact of Incremental Redundancy
The results from the IR simulations are shown in figure 123, which shows the
performance of MCS-9 with and without IR. As can be seen, 8-PSK benefits more
from the incremental redundancy than 16-QAM. This is due to the already lower
coding rate of 16QAM, which mitigates the gain from the further increases in
the redundancy.
{width="5.652777777777778in" height="3.323611111111111in"}
Figure 123: Impact of incremental redundancy\ (TU3nFH\@900MHz, no impairments,
ideal IR for MCS-9)
#### 8.4.2.5 Impact of Propagation Environment
The impact of the propagation environment is illustrated in figure 124. As can
be seen, the Doppler effect degrades the throughput of the highest MCSs in the
case of fast-moving terminals. In addition, the high delay spread of the HT
channel manifests itself as a reduced throughput.
{width="5.690277777777778in" height="3.69375in"}
Figure 124: Impact of the propagation environment (no impairments, ideal LA)
#### 8.4.2.6 Impact of RX and TX Impairments
Given equal coding rates, it is obvious that 16-QAM is more sensitive to the
RX and TX impairments than 8-PSK. However, when comparing 8-PSK and 16-QAM
with equal payload sizes, the lower operating point of 16-QAM effectively
compensates the sensitivity loss due to tighter constellation. This fact can
be easily seen from figure 125, which shows that the MCS-9-16QAM is less
sensitive to the impairments than the MCS-9-8PSK.
{width="5.704861111111111in" height="3.675in"}
Figure 125: Impact of RX and TX impairments (TU3nFH\@900MHz, MCS-9)
In order to evaluate the potential of 16-QAM coding schemes above MCS-9, a set
of high coding rates (0.8, 0.9 and 1.0) are evaluated. The results from these
simulations are shown in figure 126.
As can be seen, the higher coding rate means also higher sensitivity to the
RX/TX impairments. While the uncoded 16-QAM is heavily impaired, the slightly
lower coding rates are considerably less affected by the impairments. Hence,
it could be possible to increase the peak data rates by adopting MCS10 and
MCS11 with coding rates 0.8 and 0.9, respectively.
{width="5.648611111111111in" height="3.651388888888889in"}
Figure 126: Impact of high coding rates (TU3nFH\@900MHz)
#### 8.4.2.7 Impact of RRC Pulse Shaping
The performance of 16-QAM could be, in principle, enhanced by replacing the
Gaussian pulse with an RRC pulse. The impact of the improved TX filtering is
shown in figure 127, which shows the throughput curves for Gaussian and RRC
pulse shapes.
{width="5.713888888888889in" height="3.698611111111111in"}
Figure 127: Impact of RRC pulse shaping (TU3nFH\@900MHz, no impairments, ideal
LA)
The main drawback of the RRC filtering is that the signal spectrum cannot be
fitted into the existing GSM spectrum mask. This can be clearly seen from
figure 128, which shows the RRC spectrum with all relevant TX impairments
included. The adoption of RRC would hence require a specification of a new
spectrum mask.
{width="4.624305555555556in" height="3.473611111111111in"}
Figure 128: RRC spectrum (backoff=6dB, typical impairments)
#### 8.4.2.8 Evaluation of Performance
The throughput gain (versus 8-PSK) for different C/I values is shown in figure
129.
{width="5.7375in" height="3.69375in"}
Figure 129: Throughput gain from 16-QAM (TU3, typical impairments, ideal LA)
As can be seen, the throughput gain for 16-QAM modulation varies between 0 to
19 % in the case of ideal frequency hopping, and between 0 to 9 % when no
hopping is applied. The requirement for 50 % throughput improvement at cell
border is not reached, because 16-QAM does not improve the performance of the
most robust coding schemes at all. The peak data rates are neither improved,
given that the current payloads for MCS7-9 are used. By introducing less
robust MCSs, the peak data rates could be improved by 24 % (assuming code-rate
0.9 MCS), but the coverage of these high bit rates would be extremely limited.
As a summary, the following improvements could be (ideally) achieved by the
use of 16-QAM:
  * 24 % gain for peak data rates (with limited coverage).
  * 0 to 19 % throughput gain over cell range.
  * 0 % gain for throughput at cell border in power-limited conditions > due to increased PA backoff (up to 2 dB).
In a real network, the following characteristics should be considered as well:
  * The increased PA backoff degrades the link layer performance of > 16-QAM by some 2 dB in power-limited conditions. By considering > that the link level gain for 16-QAM modulation can be as low as > 0-2 dB (nFH), it is possible that, in some cases, no improvements > in performance is seen for 16-QAM compared to 8-PSK (e.g. a > sensitivity-limited non-hopping network).
  * 16-QAM benefits less from the incremental redundancy than 8-PSK due > to the already lower coding rate of 16QAM, which mitigates the > gain from the further increases in the redundancy.
  * 16-QAM benefits less from the BTS antenna diversity than 8-PSK for > the same coding rate, because the degree of diversity is already > higher due to lower coding rate and longer interleaving depth.
### 8.4.3 Implementation C
Source: Reference [6], [19], [8], [28], [30], [42] and [43]. Note that there
are additional details of simulation results in annex B.
Higher order modulations and turbo codes have been proposed as candidates for
the GERAN continued evolution feasibility study. The performance gains of
16QAM, 32QAM, turbo codes and the combination of these are evaluated on link
and system level.
In addition a short investigation is included regarding the impact on
performance if the 16QAM DFSE equalizer is replaced by RSSE.
#### 8.4.3.1 Channel coding
##### 8.4.3.1.1 EGPRS
As reference, the regular EGPRS coding schemes MCS-1 to MCS-9 are used, see
table 34. The only deviation from table 34 is that Tail bits are viewed as
channel coding redundancy.
##### 8.4.3.1.2 Convolutional Codes with 16QAM
Three 16QAM-modulated coding schemes with convolutional codes are evaluated.
These are called MCS-7-16QAM-2, MCS-8-16QAM-2 and MCS-9-16QAM-2 in table 34
and have the same payload size as MCS-7, MCS-8 and MCS-9, respectively. The
mother code of EGPRS (R=1/3, k=7) has been used. Uniform (FLO) puncturing has
been used for the RLC/MAC header and RLC data blocks. Interleaving is done
over four bursts. The only deviation from table 34 is that Tail bits are
viewed as channel coding redundancy.
##### 8.4.3.1.3 Turbo Codes with 8-PSK Modulation
Two new 8PSK-modulated coding schemes with turbo codes are evaluated. These
are called MTCS-5 and MTCS-6 and have the same payload size as MCS-5 and
MCS-6, respectively, as defined in table 44.
The RLC/MAC header, USF and stealing flags have the same channel coding as
MCS-5 and MCS-6. The RLC data block has been encoded with a turbo code. For
the turbo codes, the constituent codes, internal interleaver and rate matching
defined for UTRAN [12] have been reused. Uniform (FLO) puncturing has been
used for the RLC/MAC header and RLC data blocks. Interleaving is done over
four bursts.

##### 8.4.3.1.4 Turbo Codes with 16QAM Modulation
Three new 16QAM-modulated coding schemes with turbo codes are evaluated,
called MTCS-7-16QAM, MTCS‑8‑16QAM and MTCS-9-16QAM, as defined in table 45\.
These have the same payload size as MCS-7, MCS-8 and MCS-9, respectively.
The RLC/MAC header, USF and stealing flags have the same channel coding as
MCS-7-16QAM, MCS-8-16QAM and MCS-9-16QAM. The RLC data block has been encoded
with a turbo code. For the turbo codes, the constituent codes, internal
interleaver and rate matching defined for UTRAN [12] have been reused. Uniform
(FLO) puncturing has been used for the RLC/MAC header and RLC data blocks.
Interleaving is done over four bursts.

#### 8.4.3.2 Modulation
Simulations are run with 8PSK and 16QAM modulation. The 8PSK modulation is
according to the definition in 3GPP TS 45.003.
The 16QAM modulation constellation is shown in figure 106. To reduce the Peak-
to-AveRage ratio (PAR), the constellation is rotated by π/4 radians per
symbol.
#### 8.4.3.3 Pulse Shaping
For both 8PSK and 16QAM, the regular linearized GMSK pulse shape is used.

**Impairments**
Realistic transmitter and receiver impairment levels have been used. The
details are described in tables 36 and 38 respectively. The power amplifier
model reflects a state-of-the-art power amplifier with sufficient back-off.
The distortion from the PA is in the order of 0.25 % EVM rms, which does not
give noticeable impact on performance.
The downlink direction is studied, i.e. the transmitter is a BTS transmitter
and the receiver is a terminal receiver.
**Demodulator**
8PSK: A state-of-the-art receiver is used.
16QAM: A 4-state RSSE equaliser is used. Channel tracking/frequency error
correction is not implemented (for further study; the results for 16QAM may be
slightly pessimistic). This receiver complexity is about 20 % higher than the
8PSK receiver.
**Decoder for turbo codes**
The turbo decoder is run eight iterations per decoding attempt. The
constituent decoders are sub-optimum LOGMAX decoders.

NOTE: Turbo coded equivalents of MCS-7, MCS-8 and MCS-9 with 8PSK modulation
have also been evaluated but no gains were seen compared to convolutional
codes. Therefore these results are not included in this report.
#### 8.4.3.5 Link-to-system Interface
A two-stage mapping has been used. With this approach, the C/I is mapped to a
block error ratio (BLEP) in two stages. In stage one, the model takes burst
level C/I samples as input and maps them onto the (raw) Bit Error Probability
(BEP) for a burst. In stage two, the BEP samples of one radio block are
grouped together and used to estimate the BLEP. This is done by calculating
the mean and the standard deviation of the burst BEP samples of the block, and
mapping these parameters onto the BLEP. Finally, the BLEP value is used to
calculate whether the particular radio block was in error.

The system performance is measured as the average FTP session bit rate versus
offered load. Offered load is defined as the total amount of transferred bits
in the system averaged over all available timeslots and time.
##### 8.4.3.6.2 Results
The three different modulation and coding sets have been investigated in the
above described radio network scenarios. Below, the system level results are
summarised. Power backoff according to table 50 is included in all
simulations. A comparison of performance with and without backoff is presented
in subclause 8.4.3.6.2.4.
##### 8.4.3.6.2.1 Scenario 1: 1-reuse with Random Frequency Hopping
{#scenario-1-1-reuse-with-random-frequency-hopping .H6}
Scenario 1, 1-reuse with random frequency hopping, is the tight reuse scenario
of the investigation and could for example be users on traffic channels that
are tightly planned due to limited spectrum.
Figure 130 shows the average session bit rate for different user percentiles
(10^th^, 50^th^ and 90^th^ percentile). This allows for an analysis of how
users in different radio quality situations are affected by the introduction
of higher order modulation and turbo coding.
{width="5.735416666666667in" height="4.311805555555556in"}
Figure 130: Average session bit rate percentiles, 10^th^ percentile (blue),
50^th^ percentile (red)\ and 90^th^ percentile, as a function of offered FTP
load, for MCS set 1, 2 and 3
In figure 130 it can be seen that the users with the best radio quality
(90^th^ percentile) do not gain very much, up to approximately 10 % gain for
the highest load case. However, the users with worse radio quality (10^th^ and
50^th^ percentiles) experience significantly higher gains. The general gains
on the 10^th^ percentile are approximately 35 % to 40 % for 16QAM + turbo, and
15 % to 20 % with plain 16QAM. For the median users (50^th^ percentile) the
general session bit rate gains are approximately 20 % to 30 % for the 16QAM +
turbo set, and 5 % to 15% for the 16QAM set.
Furthermore, the improvement in bit rate performance lowers the load of the
system, since the staying time of each user gets shorter. This improves the
capacity of the system. Figure 131 shows an example where the normalised
spectrum efficiency is shown for different service requirements. It is
important to note that the relative capacity gain depends highly on the chosen
service requirement. If the bit rate requirement is higher, the relative
capacity gain from higher order modulation and turbo coding gets higher, but
the total capacity gets lower. Taking that into account and choosing for
example a 60 kbps bit rate requirement, it can be seen in figure 131 that the
capacity gain with 16QAM + turbo is just below 50 %.

requirements,\ for 1-reuse with frequency hopping
##### 8.4.3.6.2.2 Scenario 2: 12-reuse without Frequency Hopping
{#scenario-2-12-reuse-without-frequency-hopping .H6}
Scenario 2, 12-reuse without frequency hopping, is one of the sparse reuse
scenarios investigated and could for example be users on a broadcast channel
(see Note) that is sparsely planned to ensure secure signalling operation.
NOTE : three non-hopping frequencies are used per cell in this scenario, thus
it is not identical to a scenario where EDGE is deployed on BCCH frequencies.
However, similar performance can be expected. This scenario was chosen to
allow a comparison with the other scenarios.
Figure 132 shows the average session bit rate for different user percentiles
(10^th^, 50^th^, and 90^th^ percentile). This allows for an analysis of how
users in different radio quality situations are affected by the introduction
of higher order modulation and turbo coding.
{width="5.740277777777778in" height="4.627777777777778in"}
Figure 132: Average session bit rate percentiles, 10^th^ percentile (blue),
50^th^ percentile (red),\ 90^th^ percentile (black), as a function of
normalised system load, for MCS set 1, 2 and 3
In figure 132 it can be seen that also for the 12-reuse, the gains for the
90^th^ percentile users are limited. For the users with lower radio quality
(10^th^ and 50^th^ percentiles) the gain is substantial. The general gain at
the 10^th^ percentile is approximately 40 % to 45 % with the 16QAM + turbo set
and 20 % to 25 % with the 16QAM set, depending on system load. For the 50^th^
percentile these general gains are approximately 20 % to 40 % for 16QAM +
turbo and 10 % to 20 % for 16QAM, depending on system load.
NOTE: The bit rate curves for EGPRS do not reach an offered load of 30 kbps/TS
since that load cannot be offered with EGPRS in this scenario.
Furthermore, the improvement in bit rate performance lowers the load of the
system, since the staying time of each user gets shorter. This improves the
capacity of the system. Figure 133 shows an example where the normalised
spectrum efficiency is shown for different service requirements. It is
important to note that the relative capacity gain depends highly on the chosen
service requirement. If the bit rate requirement is higher, the relative
capacity gain from higher order modulation and turbo coding gets higher, but
the total capacity gets lower. Taking that into account and choosing for
example a 80 kbps bit rate requirement (see Note), it can be seen in figure
133 that the capacity gain with 16QAM + turbo is just above 60 %.
NOTE : A different level is chosen here since all curves do not reach the 60
kbps/TS level used in the 1-reuse scenario.

##### 8.4.3.6.2.3 Scenario 3: 12-reuse with Random Frequency Hopping
{#scenario-3-12-reuse-with-random-frequency-hopping .H6}
Scenario 3, 12-reuse with frequency hopping, is the other of the sparse reuse
scenarios investigated and could for example be users on a traffic channel
that is sparsely planned due to more generous spectrum availability.
Since frequency hopping does not make very large differences in performance
for packet data services in sparse reuse scenarios, performance with and
without frequency hopping are given in the same plot.
Figure 134 shows the same curves as in figure 132 only the corresponding
results with frequency hopping have been added with dashed lines.

50^th^ percentile (red),\ 90^th^ percentile (black). 12-reuse without
frequency hopping (solid) and\ with frequency hopping (dashed), for MCS set 1,
2 and 3
Figure 134 shows that the performance is quite similar both with and without
frequency hopping in the 12 reuse scenario. It is however visible that
frequency hopping gives a very slight decrease in performance for standard
8PSK, while it gives a very small improvement for 16 QAM and a slightly higher
performance with 16QAM + turbo, where the increased diversity can be
exploited. In total, the general improvements in session bit rates are further
increased by a few percent with 16QAM and slightly more with 16QAM + turbo, by
the introduction of frequency hopping.
##### 8.4.3.6.2.4 Scenario 4 and 5: 1/3-reuse {#scenario-4-and-5-13-reuse .H6}
Figure 135 shows the average session bit rate for different user percentiles
(10^th^, 50^th^ and 90^th^ percentile). Dashed lines are with frequency
hopping, solid lines are without frequency hopping. As in [4], the gains for
the 90^th^ percentile of users (session bit rates) are small since they are
near the peak bit rate already with EGPRS. The gains on the 10^th^ percentile
are 35 % to 50 % for 16QAM+turbo codes and 10 % to 15 % from 16QAM alone. On
the 50^th^ percentile, the gains are 10 % to 30 % for 16QAM+turbo codes and 5
% to 15 % from 16QAM. The lower end of the gain intervals corresponds to the
lowest offered FTP load. Note that the lower gain (5 % or 10 %) of the 50^th^
percentile is due to that the peak rate is almost reached.
{width="5.735416666666667in" height="4.30625in"}

hopping, solid lines are without frequency hopping
Figure 136 shows normalized spectrum efficiency. The spectrum efficiency
depends on the required bit rate (for the 10^th^ percentile, i.e. for 90 % of
the sessions). If for example the requirement is 60 kbps (shown as a red
dashed line in the figure), the spectrum efficiency gain for 16QAM+turbo codes
is 44 % without frequency hopping and 42 % with frequency hopping. For plain
16QAM, the gain is 21 % without frequency hopping and 16 % with frequency
hopping.

##### 8.4.3.6.2.5 Scenario 6 and 7: 3/9-reuse {#scenario-6-and-7-39-reuse .H6}
Figure 137 shows the average session bit rate for different user percentiles
(10^th^, 50^th^, and 90^th^ percentile). Dashed lines are with frequency
hopping, solid lines are without frequency hopping. Again, the gains for the
90^th^ percentile of users (session bit rates) are small since the bit rates
are near the peak bit rate already with EGPRS. The gains on the 10^th^
percentile are 30 % to 40 % for 16QAM+turbo codes and 10 % to 25 % from 16QAM
alone. On the 50^th^ percentile, the gains are 2 % to 35 % for 16QAM+turbo
codes and 2 % to 20 % from 16QAM. The lower end of the gain interval
corresponds to the lowest offered FTP load. Note that the lower gains (2 %) at
the 50^th^ percentile are due to that the peak rate is almost reached.

hopping, solid lines are without frequency hopping
Figure 138 shows normalised spectrum efficiency. The spectrum efficiency
depends on the required bit rate (for the 10^th^ percentile, i.e. for 90 % of
the sessions). If for example the requirement is 90 kbps (shown as a red
dashed line in the figure), the spectrum efficiency gain for 16QAM+turbo codes
is 82 % without frequency hopping and 87 % with frequency hopping. For plain
16QAM, the gain is 40% without frequency hopping and 44% with frequency
hopping.

##### 8.4.3.6.2.6 The Impact of Power Back Off {#the-impact-of-power-back-off
.H6}
In the above results, the power back off factors given in table 50 have been
used. In a similar manner as with frequency hopping, it has also been
investigated how the removal of the power back off factors affects the
results. This means that all the three modulations (GMSK, 8PSK, and 16QAM)
will be using the same output power.
Figure 139 shows the same plot as in figure 132, but the corresponding results
without power back off have been added with dashed lines.
{width="5.735416666666667in" height="4.311805555555556in"}

50^th^ percentile (red),\ 90^th^ percentile (black). 12-reuse with power back
off (solid) and without power back off (dashed),\ for MCS set 1, 2 and 3
Figure 139 shows that average session bit rates are slightly higher without
power back off. However, the relative gains achieved by using higher order
modulation and turbo coding are quite similar both with and without power back
off.
#### 8.4.3.7 Increased Peak Throughput with 16QAM and Turbo Codes
In this subclause two new MCSs are defined that increase the peak throughput
compared to the conventional MCSs in EDGE today.
##### 8.4.3.7.1 Modulation, Coding and Interleaving
To increase the peak throughput higher than MCS-9, new modulation and coding
schemes need to be defined. Two new MCSs have been considered, MCS-10 and
MCS-11, the former one has also been evaluated in combination with turbo codes
(MTCS-10). MCS-11 has been chosen to be un-coded and thus the addition of
turbo codes will not have an impact on the performance. In table 51 the PDU
sizes, code rates of the data and header and interleaving depth are shown.
Note that in table 51 only the uplink is considered but the MCSs can also be
defined for the downlink. The only difference will be an addition of USF bits,
resulting in a slightly less robust header.
Table 51: Block sizes, code rates and interleaving depth of MCS-10 and MCS-11
* * *
MCS Family Dir. User PDU [bytes] User data rate [kbps] Payload [bits]
Interleaving depth Data code rate Header code rate MCS-10 B UL 3x56 67.2 3x448
4 0.83 0.42 MTCS-10 B UL 3x56 67.2 3x448 4 0.82 0.42 MCS-11 A UL 3x68 81.6
3x544 2 1 0.42
* * *
It can be seen that both MSC-10 and MCS-11 consist of 3 RLC-blocks which fall
into the families B and A respectively. Thus MCS-10 contains three MCS-7 RLC
blocks and MCS-11 contains three MCS-8 RLC blocks.
##### 8.4.3.7.1.1 Coding {#coding .H6}
Each RLC block is encoded separately (joint coding is for further study). The
same mother convolutional code as used today in combination with linear
puncturing has generated the coded header and data bits. For MCS-10 with turbo
coding (MTCS-10) the turbo code defined for UTRAN has been used [15]. The
puncturing schemes for the turbo codes have been generated by prioritizing the
systematic bits and additionally puncturing the two parity bits streams (rate
1/3 code) in a linear manner with minimal overlap between IR puncturing
schemes.
##### 8.4.3.7.1.2 Interleaving {#interleaving .H6}
For the MCS used today, depending on what MCS is used the number of bursts
over where the interleaving is performed differs. For MCS-7 the data bits in
the RLC block is interleaved over all four bursts while for MCS-8-9 the
interleaving is performed over two bursts for each RLC block. The reason for
this is the coding rate of the MCSs; a high code rate will experience small
gains (or even lose) in performance with increased diversity. This also
applies to MCS‑10 and MCS-11 where the RLC blocks for MCS-10 are interleaved
over all four bursts while for MCS-11 the interleaving is performed over two
bursts. One difference between MCS-11 compared to MCS-8-9 is that the RLC
block errors will be more correlated since the different blocks are not
entirely separated, as is depicted in figure 140.

##### 8.4.3.7.2 Link Performance
A state-of-the art link level simulator for GSM/EDGE has been used to evaluate
the performance of the new modulation and coding schemes. The simulator

Figure 141 shows the throughput curves of MCS-10 and MCS-11 both using 16QAM
modulation. For MCS-10 the performance when adding turbo codes is also shown.
MCS-9 as used in EDGE today is shown as reference.

Figure 141: Throughput gain by using HOMTC including MTCS-10 and MCS-11\ The
different sets are defined in table 53
It can be seen that MTCS-10 is superior to MCS-9 at C/I levels above 17 dB.
When turbo coding is added the point is moved to 15 dB. It should be noted
that the puncturing scheme for MTCS-10 has been improved since the results in
[29] giving an additional improvement of approximately 0.5 dB. From the figure
it can also be seen that the peak throughput can be increased from 59.2 kbps
to 81.6 kbps by using MCS-11 - an increase of 38 %. The peak throughput
available today, 59.2 kbps, is exceeded at C/I levels above 23 dB.
Figure 142 evaluates the throughput performance at different C/Is when MCS-10
and MCS‑11 is combined with MCS‑5-9 with and without turbo codes and 16QAM,
see table 53.

Ideal link adaptation has been assumed for the sets both with and without
incremental redundancy. Thus, for a certain C/I level the MCS giving the
largest throughput is chosen.

Figure 142: Throughput as a function of C/I. Ideal LA assumed
Figure 142 shows that there are substantial gains by introducing the MCSs for
increased peak throughput. The peak throughput increased by 38 %. Without IR,
the peak throughput of today is exceeded for C/I above 23 dB (comparing Set 2
with the EDGE set). Similar gains are shown when IR is introduced as shown in
Set 3 and 5. Comparing Set 4 and Set 5 it is seen that, in IR mode (two
retransmissions included), MCS-11 is actually used until C/I = 12 dB.
In table 143 the throughput gains by using HOM and TC are compared to the MCSs
used today in EDGE. As was also seen in figure 142 there is a gain in the
whole C/I region. The largest gains are at high C/I and is a result from the
introduction of MCS-10 and MCS-11. Similar gains are seen when IR is
introduced. The average gain in throughput is approximately 25 % both with and
without incremental redundancy.

##### 8.4.3.7.3 System Performance
System simulations in subclause 8.4.3.6 have shown significant gains in
spectral efficiency and average session bit rates when introducing HOM and/or
TC for robustness (MCS-5-9), see [8], [9] and [29]. It was shown that the
spectral efficiency could be increased up to 40 % to 60 % depending on the
frequency reuse in the system. Also, gains in average session bit rates were
shown to be between 30 % to 45 % for the median and worst users. For users in
good radio conditions the gain was not seen as clear, thus the performance
limitation lied clearly in the peak throughput that was reached both with and
without HOM+TC. In this subclause additional results are shown where MCS-10
and MCS-11 also have been included in the simulations. Since these MCSs
increase the peak throughput, an increase of mean throughput in the system is
expected, especially for the users in good radio conditions. Also, since the
staying time in the system will be shorter for users utilizing these higher
MCS, the overall interference level will decrease and giving rise to a more
spectrally efficient system and an increase of average user bit rates.
It should be noted that the simulations presented in this subclause have used
a link quality controller (LQC) not optimized for the addition of MCS-10 and
MCS-11.
In table 54 the simulation parameters are shown for the simulated scenario.
Frequency reuse 1 is used where the traffic model consists of each user
downloading a file of 100 kB with FTP.

Simulations with two different sets of MCSs have been performed. Both sets use
the newly defined 16QAM MCSs with turbo coding, but Set B also include MTCS-10
and MCS-11; details are shown in table 55.

In figure 144 the average session bit rates versus offered load are shown. It
can be seen that there is a significant throughput gain for the 90^th^
percentile of between 12 % to 20 % depending on the load. For the 10^th^ and
50^th^ percentile the session bit rates seem to be unchanged since the small
difference in bit rates that are seen can rather be explained by statistical
effects than difference in performance. With an optimized LQC gains are
expected also for these percentiles.

#### 8.4.3.8 16QAM with Alternative Transmit Pulse Shaping
Since decoding of turbo codes is computationally complex, it may not be
feasible in all legacy BTS equipment without hardware impacts. Hardware
impacts to legacy networks should be avoided according to the objectives of
the GERAN Evolution Feasibility Study [2]. It is therefore of interest to look
at alternative improvement methods for the uplink that can be combined with
higher order modulations.
One such enhancement is to use other transmit pulse shapes than the linearised
GMSK pulse normally used for EDGE. In the following subclauses, root-raised
cosine (RRC) pulses are evaluated.
##### 8.4.3.8.1 Link Performance
Link simulations have been run to evaluate the performance of different RRC Tx
pulses.

the GSM spectrum mask.

pulses\ The 8PSK spectrum mask for MS [8] is also shown
##### 8.4.3.8.3 Discussion
Figure 145 shows that a RRC Tx pulse with a SSB bandwidth of 135 kHz gives
gains of 1.5 dB in a co-channel interference limited scenario. Figure 146
shows that the gain in a sensitivity limited scenario is 2.5 dB for the same
Tx pulse. With a narrower RRC Tx pulse, the gain is reduced. A pulse with a
SSB bandwidth of 110 kHz gives a loss of 1 dB in the co-channel scenario but a
sensitivity gain of 0.5 dB.
The gains with a wide RRC Tx pulse are in the same order as those of turbo
codes, or even larger. A preliminary conclusion is therefore that the system
level gains in the order of 30 % shown previously for 16QAM+turbo codes can be
achieved with this alternative method (i.e., higher order modulation combined
with a wider Tx pulse).
Note that the gains from turbo codes and the gains from a new transmit pulse
shape are likely additive. Therefore, it can be considered to have an option
of turbo codes in addition to the higher order modulation with new transmit
pulse shape.
#### 8.4.3.9 Higher order modulation than 16-QAM
Increasing the modulation order will make the symbols more susceptible to
interference and thus the higher order the modulation the better radio
conditions are needed to gain in performance. Also, increasing the modulation
order to 32QAM, or maybe even to 64QAM, will probably result in such an
increase of receiver complexity that new hardware is needed in both base
stations and mobile stations.
Three new MCSs have been defined for 32QAM, giving a peak throughput of up to
99.2 kbps.
##### 8.4.3.9.1 Modulation, coding and interleaving
The new MCSs for 32QAM are used to increase the robustness of the previously
defined 16QAM MCSs, MCS-10 and MCS-11, but also to increase the peak
throughput even further to 99.2 kbps with MCS-12.
The MCSs are summarized in table 57. For comparison previously defined
MCS-7-11 for 16QAM are also included.
Table 57: Definitions 32QAM MCSs. Previously defined MCSs for 16QAM are also
shown\ for comparison. Different shades of gray are used for the different
modulation orders
MCS | Family | Dir. | User PDU [bytes] | User data rate [kbps] | Modulation | Payload [bits] | Int. depth | Data code rate | Header code rate  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
7 | B | UL | 2x56 | 44.8 | 16QAM | 2x468 | 4 | 0.55 | 0.34

11 | A | UL | 3x68 | 81.6 | 16QAM | 3x564 | 2 | 1 | 0.42

It can be seen that MCS-12 is actually a multi-family MCS, i.e. it consists of
PDU sizes from both family A and B. Only the code rates of the UL MCSs are
shown in the table but worth noting is that the basic difference in
performance for the DL MCSs would be the addition of USF bits which could
result in a slightly less robust header.
In table 58 the conventional 8PSK MCSs and the currently defined HOM MCSs are
shown with corresponding data code rate. It is seen that HOM is used for
making a more robust transmission (no increase in data rates) but also for
increasing the peak rates. MCSs defined both with and without turbo coding are
shadowed in gray.

##### 8.4.3.9.1.1 Coding {#coding-1 .H6}
Each RLC block is encoded separately (joint coding is for further study). The
same mother convolutional code as used today in combination with linear
puncturing has generated the coded header and data bits. For the turbo coded
MCSs the code defined for UTRAN has been used [15]. The puncturing schemes for
the turbo coded data have been generated by prioritizing the systematic bits
and additionally puncturing the two parity bits streams (rate 1/3 code) in a
linear manner with minimal overlap between IR puncturing schemes.
##### 8.4.3.9.1.2 Interleaving {#interleaving-1 .H6}
The interleaving depth used for an MCS will basically depend on the number of
RLC blocks in one radio block and the code rate of the data. For example,
conventional MCS-9 is uncoded and will therefore not gain from an increased
diversity. Thus, each RLC data block is interleaved over 2 bursts:
interleaving depth 2. MCSs with low code rates on the other hand will gain
from diversity and the RLC blocks are interleaved over all four bursts:
interleaving depth 4. Figure 148 shows the implementation of the interleaving
for all HOM MCSs in table 57.

MCS-12-32QAM
Worth noting is that the RLC-blocks for MCS-12-32QAM (uncoded) is interleaved
over either one or two bursts. This is a result of the different RLC block
sizes shown in table 57.
##### 8.4.3.9.2 Interference Rejection Combining, IRC
Interference rejection combining, IRC, is a diversity combining method that
can be used in a multiple antenna system for suppressing mainly CO-channel
interference. The suppression is possible by utilizing the cross-covariance of
the interference received in the different antennas. Figure 149 shows the
basic principle of IRC.
{width="3.551388888888889in" height="1.6347222222222222in"}
Figure 149: Illustration of the principle of IRC with two receiving antennas
IRC is basically an expansion of Maximum Ratio Combining, MRC, in which only
the noise variance is utilized. The performance of the IRC algorithm will
largely depend on the interference scenario, the synchronization of the
interfering and carrier burst and the correlation of the receiving antennas.
Synchronization between carrier and interferer is assumed in the simulations.
Table 59 shows the interference scenario that has been used in the
simulations.

The fewer interferers there are, the more efficient the IRC performs. The
chosen scenario, DTS2 [21], is a complex interference model containing two co-
channel interferers, one adjacent interferer and two AWGN sources, which
corresponds to the interference of a heavily loaded system. The first AWGN
source is a Gaussian approximation of the remaining interferers, apart from
the strong co and adjacent interferers, while the second source is modelling
the Gaussian noise in the receiver, e.g. thermal noise.

##### 8.4.3.9.3.2 Link Simulations {#link-simulations .H6}
In this subclause the link level results of the 32QAM MCSs are shown. Both
results with and without turbo coding are presented.
{width="5.7375in" height="3.7708333333333335in"}
Figure 150: Link performance (without antenna diversity)\ of
MCS-10/11/12-32QAM and MTCS-10/11-32QAM
It can be seen that the turbo coding gives an additional gain in performance
of approximately 1 dB at 10 % BLER (as has been seen before in e.g. [28]). The
performance of uncoded 32QAM, MCS-12, seems to experience an error floor at
high C/I. This is due to the transmitter and receiver impairments that are not
dependent on the radio conditions.
In table 61 the performance of MCS-7-12 at a BLER of 10 % is shown.

NOTE: If there is no turbo code performance result for different modulations
of one MCS, the performance of the convolutional code is used instead.
* * *
It can be seen that there is a performance gain when HOM is used for
robustness. The gain is however smaller between 16QAM and 32QAM compared to
8PSK and 16QAM. For all MCSs the turbo coding gives an additional gain of
around 1 dB.
In figures 151 and 152 the achieved throughput with ideal Link Adaptation, LA,
is shown (no IR is used). The sets of MCSs used are defined in table 62.

Figure 151: Throughput of different sets of MCSs with no antenna diversity\ or
incremental redundancy
Using 16QAM to increase robustness and to increase peak throughput (Set 1)
gives gains at high C/I of, at the most, 38 %. Gains of more than 20 % are
however achieved at C/I > 20 dB. 32QAM will increase performance even further
(Set 2) with performance improvements compared to 16QAM from approximately a
C/I of 22 dB. Throughput gains of higher than 50 %, compared to EDGE, are
experienced at C/I > 34 dB.
Even further gains are achieved when combining the HOM with receiver diversity
as figure 152 shows.

Figure 152: Throughput of different sets of MCSs with two receiving antennas
using IRC\ Interference scenario \'DTS2\'
The same sets of MCSs have been used as in figure 151, but there are two
receiving antennas and in the equalizer IRC is used. It can be seen that the
gains are approximately the same, or somewhat less, up to approximately C/I of
17 dB. Gains of more than 20 % are experienced with 16QAM at C/I > 20 dB and
the gain with 32QAM is above 50 % for C/I > 25 dB.
In figure 153 the throughput of the highest MCS of set EDGE, Set 1 and Set 2
is shown when using incremental redundancy, IR (but no antenna diversity). The
number of IR retransmissions has been limited to 2. It can be seen that the
throughput gains are similar to the ones in figure 151 where ideal LA without
IR was utilized.

C/I-distribution have been performed. The distribution used is from a 3/9
freq. reuse with a 2 % blocking limit, see annex B, figure B.9.

In table 63 it can be seen that there are substantial gains by using both
16QAM and 32QAM, both with and without IRC. Previously it has been shown that
32QAM can increase the peak bit rate with 66 % and in this calculation it is
shown that the average throughput gain for all users can be close to 40 %. The
gains shown when IRC is used are expected also for downlink if MSRD is used.

#### 8.4.3.10 Comparison between DFSE and RSSE Performance
To evaluate the impact on performance when using the RSSE of implementation
set C and a DFSE, MCS-9 performance has been simulated on a TU3 channel with
ideal frequency hopping at 900 MHz. For the receiver impairments mainly the
contribution from phase noise was included while transmitter impairments were
not. These simulations were run with a π/4 rotation per symbol of the 16QAM
constellation, which will reduce the peak-to-average (PAR) ratio to 5.3 dB.
This should be compared to the PAR of 3.3 dB for 8PSK with 3π/8 rotation and
the PAR of 16QAM without rotation of 6 dB.
In figure 154 it is shown that the loss is less than 0.5 dB.

#### 8.4.3.11 Discussion
##### 8.4.3.11.1 Link Level Performance
Turbo codes show gains in the order of 1 dB in all evaluated cases (MTCS-5,
MTCS-6, MTCS-7-16QAM, MTCS‑8‑16QAM, MTCS-9-16QAM), compared to convolutional
codes. No gains have been found for 8PSK‑modulated turbo-coded equivalents of
MCS-7 to MCS-9 (simulation results not shown in this report). It is clear that
in order to get gains with turbo codes for a wide range of MCSs, they need to
be combined with higher order modulations. The combination of 16QAM and turbo
codes gives gains up to 5.5 dB at 10%BLER and up to 7.9 dB at 1 % BLER.
##### 8.4.3.11.2 System Level Performance
Turbo codes together with 16QAM will give significant gains in average session
bit rate also in a 1-reuse network. The gains are present (and even seem to
increase) with higher loads. At 8 kbps/timeslot offered FTP load, the average
session bit rate gain is about 20 % to 25 % (see figure 130). 8 kbps/timeslot
offered FTP load corresponds to a frequency load of 10 % to 15 %, which is a
higher load than in most networks deployed today.
It is interesting to notice (see figure 130) that all users benefit from the
improvements. In fact, the relative gains are larger, about 30 % to 40 %, for
the average users and the users experiencing the worst conditions (50^th^ and
10^th^ percentile).
The reason why lower percentiles are so positively affected is that users in
worse radio conditions have very varying radio conditions, but high MCSs are
still sometimes used. With 16QAM, and particularly with the addition of turbo
coding as well, these radio quality variations can be exploited through
interference diversity gains. This is not the case with traditional EGPRS,
where the higher MCS:s cannot benefit from interference diversity due to the
high coding rates.
Users with high average radio quality (higher percentiles) will use the high
MCSs far more regularly, which increases the possibilities to gain from the
enhanced robustness. However, due to the fair and stable radio conditions the
robustness gains are limited and the bit rates are high, resulting in a
smaller relative gain than what is seen in lower percentiles.
Turbo codes together with 16QAM also give significant gains in average session
bit rate in a 12-reuse scenario, regardless of if frequency hopping is used or
not. In the 12-reuse scenario the users with the best radio quality (90^th^
percentile) will experience only small gains. However, for the 10^th^ and
50^th^ percentiles, performance increases by as much as 40 % to 45 %.
Thus, higher order modulation and turbo coding improves session bit rate
performance significantly, both in tight and sparse reuse.
In addition, regardless of reuse scenario, since 16QAM and turbo codes make
the transmission more efficient, FTP session airtime will be reduced. Thereby
less interference will be generated in the system, which benefits all users-
and increases the capacity of the system. It is important to note that the
relative capacity gain depends highly on the chosen service requirement. If
the bit rate requirement is higher, the relative capacity gain from higher
order modulation and turbo coding gets higher, but the total capacity gets
lower. Taking that into account the gains in spectral efficiency where around
50 % for a 60 kbps bit rate requirement in 1-reuse, and around 60 % for an 80
kbps requirement in 12‑reuse.
The performance of adding 32QAM has also been evaluated. Also the performance
gain of higher order modulation with turbo codes has been evaluated in
combination with IRC.
The results have shown that 32QAM can increase the peak data bit rates up to
99.2 kbps - an increase from EDGE of 68 %. In interference limited scenario,
the throughput with 32QAM reaches above 59.2 kbps (peak rate of MCS-9) at C/I
> 22.5 dB and throughput gains above 40 % are achieved at C/I > 31 dB. When
using antenna receiver diversity in combination with IRC the respective
C/I-levels are at 17 dB and 23.5 dB respectively. An estimation of the mean
user throughput using a C/I-distribution from a 3/9 freq. reuse shows mean
throughput gains of 38 % with 32QAM and IRC. The gains shown when IRC is used
are expected also for downlink if MSRD is used.
Thus, a combination of higher order modulation and turbo coding improves
capacity significantly.

#### 8.4.4.1 Performance Characterisation
##### 8.4.4.1.1 Uncoded BER Performance

and 16-QAM modulation. This shows good alignment of the basic receiver
performance with previously reported results by other contributors [6].

##### 8.4.4.1.2 BLER Performance of Turbo Coding with 8PSK
This subclause reports the results of simulations using logical channel
configurations defined in table 64. These define combinations of Turbo coding
with 8-PSK modulation only.
Table 66 shows the relative gains for TU3iFH Co-Channel scenario. As can be
observed, the gains are relatively modest, in the region of 1 dB to 1.5 dB for
a 4 slot interleaver, improving to 1.5 dB to 2.5 dB for 8 slot interleaver.
Note that for MCS-9 there is no improvement in basic BLER to be made, since
the code rate is already 1.
It was assessed that the relatively modest improvements were most likely due
to the relatively high code rates (MCS-6 already has code rate 0.76), and that
a combination of Turbo Coding with 16-QAM would provide more potential for
gain. The performance results for this are reported in the following
subclauses.

The BLER performance has been considered under a number of different channel
configurations and conditions. In the main body of the text, the results for
TU3 channel with ideal hopping are presented, for both co-channel interferer
and sensitivity limited scenarios.
The other detailed BLER results, from which the throughput curves in subclause
8.4.4.1.7 are derived, are presented in annex C. Those results look at the
impact of non hopping channels.
Figures 161 to 162 show the BLER performance curves for TU3iFH under co-
channel scenario; figures 168 to 169 show the BLER curves for TU3iFH under
sensitivity limited scenario. The performance improvements for BLER=10 % are
shown in tables 66 and 68.
The results for the Turbo coded configurations are consistently better than
both the current MCS configurations, and equivalent configurations using
16-QAM modulation. The improvement increases in going from MCS-5 to MCS-9 with
gains in the region of 1.5 dB to 12 dB for 4 slot interleaving, rising to
gains of 2.6 dB to 13.7 dB for 8 slot interleaving.
Significant gains of up to 4.2 dB are obtained for equivalent configurations
to MCS-5 and MCS-6, compared to both standard MCS codes, and a configuration
using 16-QAM with convolutional coding. These are gains that are particularly
helpful at a system level in improving throughput for the worst condition
users. This will be noted in more detail in subclause 8.4.4.1.9.
##### 8.4.4.1.4 Comparison to Ericsson Results
These results have been compared to those reported by [19] for the co-channel
scenario. Although, there is not an exact alignment, the Ericsson results also
confirm the assertions based on the results presented here. It should be noted
that the improvements (both as absolute C/Ico and relative) are larger than
those reported in [19].
It should also be noted that there is also substantial further gain to be
achieved by interleaving blocks over 8 slots (for example using dual carrier
to maintain TTI value).

##### 8.4.4.1.7 Throughput Performance Gain
##### 8.4.4.1.7.1 Approximation for Throughput Gain {#approximation-for-
throughput-gain .H6}
This subclause presents the performance gain of a number of different logical
channel set combinations under the physical channel scenarios considered. It
is assumed that there is ideal Link Adaptation. The throughput of a logical
channel combination is approximated as:
Throughput = (1-BLER) * DataPayloadPerBlock * BlockPerSecond
The logical channel configuration combinations used are shown in table 69\.
Figures 170 to 175 show the absolute throughput and throughput gains for these
schemes under the different channel scenarios.
Performance results were not available for MCS-x-16QAM using data rates above
59kb/s. Therefore that throughput gain curve has been curtailed above 95 % *
59 kb/s.
For the TU3iFH co-channel case (figures 170 and 171) and sensitivity case
(figures 178 and 179) the average throughput gains are approx 20 % and 30 %
respectively.
For the non-hopping case under TU50 conditions (figures 174 and 175) the
throughput gains are in the region of 15 % to 20 %.

Note that figures 170, 173 and 174 all show a \"knee\" effect in throughput
for Scheme C (Turbo) at around 59 kb/s. This occurs because of the superior
performance of the turbo code, and a relatively large jump in maximum
throughput changing from MCS-9 to MCS-10 (59 kb/s to 70 kb/s) as it has been
defined here. As an updated proposal we would modify the definitions of
MCS-10/11 (and probably add a further MCS) to cover the range of data rates
above 59 kb/s.

Although different Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCS) are typically compared
on a scale of Eb/No, this does not give a clear indication of what will be the
relative performance under thermal noise limited conditions when different
MCSs are transmitted at the same power. Also, in the case that the transmitter
is operating at close to maximum power, there will be a different backoff for
each modulation scheme.
Figures 176 to 179 show the performance of the selected coding schemes as a
function of received power. It has been assumed that the receiver has a
constant noise figure of 7 dB.
The logical channel configuration combinations used are shown in table 69\.
Figures 176 and 177 show the absolute throughput and throughput gain for the
TU3iFH channel scenario.
If the transmitter is operating at close to maximum output power, a different
backoff is needed in order to maintain EVM for the different modulations. As
per [5], back offs of 4.3dB and 6.3dB are used for 8PSK and 16QAM respectively
for the graphs that include the impact of transmitter backoff. The resulting
throughput and throughput gain graphs are shown in figures 178 and 179. For
these graphs, the Power (dBm) scale shows the power received for a non-backed
off (i.e. GMSK) signal. In building the hull curves, the 8PSK and 16QAM
performance have been shifted to account for the reduced output power from the
transmitter.
It can be seen that the improvement from the Turbo coding extends down to a
receive power of about -102dBm for the configurations tested, in the case that
there is transmitter backoff.

##### 8.4.4.1.7.2 Full Incremental Redundancy {#full-incremental-redundancy
.H6}
Incremental redundancy is now included for simulation of throughput for EGPRS
and the Turbo coded logical channels. This is now using RLC/MAC to perform
Incremental Redundancy rather than throughput approximations previously used.
Puncturing (or repetition) is applied as defined in 3GPP RAN [15]. For a
target coding rate greater than R=0.75, the RAN rate matching scheme is not
optimal, as some of the parity symbols are never transmitted. For these cases,
some modification to the scheme has been made to ensure that all symbols are
transmitted at least once after 3 transmissions of a block. This improves
throughput performance for regions relevant to the 1^st^ re-transmission and
onwards by 1 dB to 2.5dB.
In this subclause, results have been included that compare MCS9-T4-16QAM
throughput performance to EGPRS MCS9
##### 8.4.4.1.7.2.1 Impact of Mobile Speed {#impact-of-mobile-speed .H6}
The variety of mobile speeds in the network is taken into consideration here.
Performance results are included for speeds of 3 km/h, 50 km/h and 120 km/h.
An example of expected distribution of users as a function of speed is taken
from the Nortel OFDM study that pre-dates the current RAN LTE work [23]. Table
70 shows this distribution and the relative importance of higher mobile
speeds.

* * *
The throughput performance of MCS9 and MCS9-T4-16QAM in the TU channel are
shown in this subclause. It has been noted that many operators prefer to use
EGPRS on the non-hopping layer rather than the hopping, as it allows superior
throughput performance for the MCS7, MCS8 and MCS9 schemes. So to make a fair
comparison to the proposed schemes we have used as a reference MCS9
performance on non-hopping channel.
Figures 181, 182 and 183 show the throughput of MCS9-T4-16QAM as compared to
MCS9 for different vehicle speeds (3 km/h, 50 km/h and 120km/h). Figure 184
shows the throughput gain provided by MCS9-T4-16QAM as compared to MCS9 at the
same speed. [Note that a test was done to extend to (unrealistically) high
C/Ic with MCS9 at TU 3km/h. We saw that full throughput is achieved, and that
the limiting effect is not due to equalizer limitations.]
Looking for example at the 3km/h curve, it can be seen that gains of 20-60%
are achieved in the range C/Ic \~5 dB to 22 dB.
Below C/Ic of 5dB there are larger gains; however, these seem to be less
relevant because of the system delay incurred by the many repetitions to work
in this region. It is expected that this would be covered by link adaptation
to lower MCSs.
It can also be seen that the MCS9 performance reduces fairly rapidly with
increasing vehicle speed - this severely limits the maximum throughput with
EGPRS. The MCS9-T4-16QAM configuration shows minimal impact with increasing
mobile speed. This is seen as a marked gain improvement in figure 184, with
gains of 30 % to 60 % for 120 km/h in the expected relevant C/Ic range.
The improvement is larger at higher speeds is expected, since MCS9 on its
first transmission has no coding protection, while the 16QAM allows for a
reasonable coding rate (0.75), which can then correct some errors due to
fading. As speed increases, the probability to have a fading event in a block
increases, and therefore MCS9 tends to fail more.
##### 8.4.4.1.7.2.2 Hilly Terrain Channel {#hilly-terrain-channel .H6}
Figure 185 shows the throughput for MCS9 and MCS9-T4-16QAM in the HT 100 km/h
channel. The throughput performance gain is shown in figure 186. It can be
seen that for SNR above 10 dB that throughput improvements of up to 50 % are
achievable.
[Note that the scale PathGain represents SNR in dB for GMSK modulation. For
8PSK and 16QAM modulations, backoffs of 3.3 dB and 5.3 dB respectively are
applied. Thus, for example, the performance at a PathGain=0dB for 16QAM
modulation is generated from 16QAM performance at SNR=5.3dB.]

{#performance-of-homtc-in-non-hopping-configuration .H6}
A comparison of throughput performance for both hopping and non-hopping
layers, and at different mobile speeds, is shown in figure 187 for the
MCS9-T4-16QAM logical channel. Also included for reference is the MCS9
throughput for TU 3 km/h non-hopping; remember from figure 180 that MCS9
performance decreases with speed. It can be seen that the MCS9-T4-16QAM
throughput is largely unaffected under the differing conditions. There is some
degradation for low speed non-hopping; though it still substantially increases
throughput as compared to MCS9.

##### 8.4.4.1.8 Number of Turbo Decoding Iterations
Figures 188 and 189 (zoomed version of figure 188) show the impact on
performance of reduced iterations in the Turbo decoder. As expected there is
some degradation of throughput performance with reduced Turbo iterations, but
it is by no means catastrophic. This would make use of Turbo coding on the
uplink easier to employ; in the case of low loading on the uplink, more
iterations could be used for a certain block, and for higher loading
processing could be allocated between a number of blocks.

##### 8.4.4.1.9 Improved Cell Edge Performance
This subclause shows initial results of investigation to improve throughput
performance at the cell edge. As described earlier, 8PSK modulated Turbo coded
schemes have been compared to the current EGPRS GMSK modulated schemes, MCS1
to MCS4. The new MCSs are defined in table 71 such that the new logical
channels carry the same payloads as MCS1 through MCS4. The BLER results for
MCS1 to MCS4 compared to Turbo coded schemes are shown in figures 192 to 193.
The performance gains at 10 % BLER are shown in table 72. It can be seen that
gains of up to 10dB are achieved. The throughput performance curves for the
schemes are shown in figure 194 for ideal link adaptation; both hopping and
non-hopping are shown for EGPRS.
As with the 16QAM case, the lower coding rate afforded by 8PSK modulation is
advantageous, as it gives better immunity to fading.

##### 8.4.4.1.10 System Performance
A full system analysis has not been performed. However, based on the results
it is possible to make some general comments.
In order to understand relevant C/I operating values, the C/I CDFs presented
recently in contributions by Ericsson [8] and TeliaSonera [5] have been used.
The curves are shown in figure 195.
Turbo codes together with 16QAM modulation give a significant increase in the
average throughput across all the C/I range. The increase is in the region of
15 % to 30 % across the scenarios reported.
The increases are not limited to certain user conditions; the benefit is
observed across the range of conditions, so that the 5 % worst case users also
benefit substantially. From figure 179 the throughput gains for the relevant
C./Ico range (3 dB to 12 dB) is in the region of 15 % to 35 %.
The maximum throughput is ultimately determined by the modulation scheme as
the code rate tends to 1. This is not dependent on the channel coding scheme
used.
It should also be noted that the block lengths used here do not lead to smooth
throughput hull curves. Further study will be required to optimize the
selection of new MCS configurations.

##### 8.4.4.1.11.2 BLER Performance {#bler-performance-1 .H6}
Link simulations were carried out for both a noise limited environment, and an
interference limited environment. The TU3iFH channel model was used. It was
assumed that for the noise limited sensitivity case full transmit power is
always used, with backoff values applied for 8PSK, 16QAM, and 32QAM as 3.2dB,
5.3dB and 5.3dB respectively (note that the PAR value used for 32QAM here may
be optimistic). The impairments detailed in tables 36 and 38 were used.
This uncoded BER performance of 16QAM and 32QAM modulations are shown in
figure 196 for the co-channel interferer case.
{width="5.311805555555556in" height="3.977777777777778in"}
Figure 196: Uncoded BER of 16QAM and 32QAM Modulations
BLER performance graphs comparing the different logical channels are shown in
figures 201 to 202 for sensitivity conditions, and figures 207 to 208 for co-
channel interferer conditions. The conditions at which 10% BLER is achieved
are summarized in tabular form in tables 75 and 76.
Of particular note are the performance results for MCS7/8/9 channels. It can
be see that for MCS8 and MCS9 and their equivalents, the configuration using
32QAM HOMTC actually improves performance as compared to 16QAM HOMTC. For MCS7
payload, the performance of 32QAM is slightly degraded as compared to 16QAM.
On the basis of these results, it may be possible to consider an HOMTC
enhancement that only requires a new 32QAM modulation, without the need to
include a new 16QAM modulation as well. However, further analysis should
consider channel profiles with longer delay spreads and the complexity of
32QAM verses 16QAM.

This subclause presents the throughput performance of the HOMTC logical

set are given in table 77. Type II Incremental Redundancy is included.
Graphs of throughput performance and gain relative to EGPRS are shown in
figures 209 and 210 respectively. Set 3 in the graphs includes also 32QAM
modulation. As can be seen from the graphs, the throughput gain can be further
extended by use of 32QAM, as compared to 16QAM, as well as achieving higher
peak bit rate.

##### 8.4.4.1.11.4 Discussion {#discussion-3 .H6}
The results above have shown the feasibility of using 32QAM modulation with
Turbo coding for GERAN Evolution. It has been seen that it may be possible to
define standardization using only 32QAM, instead of both 16QAM and 32QAM.
Previous work [9] has shown that the increase in spectral efficiency using
16QAM modulation is around 40 % to 60 %. Although no system simulation data is
currently available for 32QAM modulation, it is clear that, based on the link
simulation data, spectral efficiency by the inclusion of 32QAM modulation will
be further increased.
Peak data rate per timeslot can be increased by a factor of 1.66 as compared
to EGPRS.
It is possible to allocate 5 timeslots to a Type I mobile, either DL or UL,
for example using Multislot class 34. For the uplink, this would entail a 7dB
backoff from maximum power, as compared to 6dB for 4 timeslots.
A combination of HOMTC including 32QAM, together with a 5 timeslot allocation,
gives a factor of 1.66 x 1.25 which will exceed 100% peak data rate increase
as compared to EGPRS. Thus the combination can double peak bit rate, and
simultaneously improve spectral efficiency by the order of 50 %.
#### 8.4.4.2 Comparison of Different Coding Configurations for Higher Order
Modulation and Turbo Coding Schemes
For thermal noise limited scenarios, results presented in [7] and [26]
indicated poor results of HOMTC as compared with EGPRS, both with and without
Rx Diversity. This contradiction to performance results that are reported in
subclause 8.4.4.1. This subclause reports comparative performance of
configurations used in [12] and [26] and examines the source for the reported
performance difference.
##### 8.4.4.2.1 HOMTC Coding Scheme Configurations
The logical channel configurations used are defined in table 79. Two
configurations of HOMTC have been used. MCSx-T4-16QAM is the configuration
used in [12], where the payload is Turbo encoded as a single block.
MCSx‑T4‑16QAM_2 is the configuration used in [26], where the payload is Turbo
encoded as 2 half length blocks.

The simulations are carried out for both an interference limited environment,
and a noise limited environment. The TU3iFH channel model is used.
It is assumed that, for the noise limited case, full transmit power is always
used, thus implying that the power of 8-PSK modulated blocks is backed off by
3.3 dB and the power of 16-QAM modulated blocks by 5.3 dB.
Mobile station impairments are included as in table 79. No base station

##### 8.4.4.2.3 Discussion
##### 8.4.4.2.3.1 Interference Limited Channel {#interference-limited-
channel-1 .H6}
As can be seen from the results, the BLER performance is affected by
partitioning of the block. This is particularly noticeable in the
configurations equivalent to MCS7, where coding the payload as two separate
blocks cuts the gain roughly in half from 3.3 dB to 1.7 dB. For the MCS8 and
MCS9 equivalent cases, the loss by division of the payload block is slightly
over 1 dB, reducing gain for the MCS8 cases down from 6.1 dB to 5 dB.
##### 8.4.4.2.3.2 Noise Limited Channel {#noise-limited-channel .H6}
As was seen in the interference limited cases, the noise limited cases are
also adversely affected by splitting the payload into 2 blocks. In particular,
for the MCS7 equivalent case, the 2 block coding causes a loss in BLER
performance as compared to MCS7 - this is in line with the result reported in
[26]. However, if the payload is encoded as a single block, this becomes a 1.5
dB gain as compared to MCS7. For the MCS8 and MCS9 equivalent cases, the loss
by division of the payload block is approximately 1 dB, reducing gain for the
MCS8 cases from 4.9 dB down to 3.7 dB.
#### 8.4.4.3 Impact of Blind Modulation Detection
##### 8.4.4.3.1 Blind Modulation Detection
The training sequences for 8PSK modulation in EDGE were selected to be rotated
versions of the original GMSK training sequences. For GMSK, the rotation was
π/2 between symbols. For 8PSK, it was selected to be 3π/8.
The principle is extended for 16QAM and 32QAM, with different rotations used
as shown in Table 81a.
Table 81a: Rotation Angles for Different Modulation Constellations
* * *
**Modulation** **Rotation (rad)** GMSK π/2 8PSK 3π/8 16QAM π/4 32QAM -π/4
* * *
It will be seen in the results section that incorrect modulation selection
increases as the SNR or C/I decreases. But also the quality of the data from
the equalizer decreases. An incorrect modulation selection will lead to a
performance loss only if the output of the equalizer would have contributed to
the decoding phase.
##### 8.4.4.3.2 Simulation Configuration
The results shown are for the simulation configuration described in Section
8.3.
Results are presented for the following channel conditions:
  1. Sensitivity: TU50iFH, HT100nH
  2. Co-Channel: Tu3iFH, TU50iFH
##### 8.4.4.3.3 Performance Results
The results given in the Annex B.4 show the performance of the selected
logical channels at 10% BLER. The performance is shown for the cases when the
modulation is known and when blind modulation detection is used in the
presence of 4 possible modulations: GMSK, 8PSK, 16QAM and 32QAM. Also shown on
each graph is the modulation detection error curve.
Note: a simple modulation detection scheme was used that determines the
modulation on a burst by burst basis.
##### 8.4.4.3.4 Discussion
The loss due to blind modulation is insignificant, being no more than 0.1dB in
all cases. As is seen in the performance graphs, the modulation detection is
far more robust than the data decoding, even when considering 4 modulations,
rather than 2 in EGPRS. There are even some cases that the BLER is improved
relative to the known modulation case.
##### 8.4.4.3.5 Conclusion
Blind modulation detection does not degrade performance of HOT.
## 8.5 Symbol Mapping of Turbo Coded Bits
Source: Reference [24].
In this subclause, a symbol mapping method of turbo coded bits for 16-QAM
modulation is introduced in order to improve the performance of such turbo
coded systems. It is noted that this symbol mapping method has already been
included as part of the coding chain for HS-DSCH [15].
### 8.5.1 Symbol mapping for 16-QAM Modulation
#### 8.5.2.1 Concept description
In high order modulation schemes, such as 16-QAM, 32-QAM and 64-QAM, each
symbol consists of bits with different reliabilities. Figure 1 shows the
signal constellation diagram of 16-QAM used in 3GPP TS 25.213 [25]. A 16‑QAM
symbol has a set of four consecutive data bits {width="1.0833333333333333in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"} with (n mod 4)=0 and this set is separated
into two consecutive data bits{width="1.0833333333333333in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"} on the I-axis and two consecutive data
bits{width="1.2777777777777777in" height="0.20833333333333334in"} on the
Q-axis. This four consecutive bits ({width="0.6388888888888888in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}) are mapped to a 16-QAM symbol by the
modulation mapper. It is noted that in the 16-QAM constellation shown in
figure 106, the first two bits ({width="0.125in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"} and {width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}) which are in higher reliable positions result
in bit error rate (BER) than the last two bits ({width="0.1527777777777778in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"} and {width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}) which are in lower reliable positions. To
justify the performance difference between the higher reliable positions and
the lower reliable positions, we show simulation results for uncoded 16-QAM
symbol transmission over both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channel. Figure 218(a)
demonstrates that the higher reliable positions achieve a performance gain of
0.7 dB at BER of {width="0.3055555555555556in" height="0.2222222222222222in"}
over AWGN channel compared to the lower reliable positions. As shown in figure
218(b), further performance gap of about 3 dB at BER of
{width="0.3055555555555556in" height="0.2222222222222222in"} exists between
the higher reliable positions and the lower reliable positions over Rayleigh
fading channel.
As shown in figure 219, higher priority bits can be assigned on higher
reliable positions (H part) while lower priority bits can be assigned on lower
reliable positions (L part). This symbol mapping concept can be applied to
turbo coded bits for 16-QAM modulation in order to attain performance gain
without additional complexity.

#### 8.5.2.2 16-QAM Symbol Mapping of Turbo Coded Bits
An example of transmit architecture for MCS-7, MCS-8 and MCS-9 in downlink is
shown in figure 220. Differences from the architecture considered in the
feasibility study of GERAN evolution [12, 13, 8] are in fact that a
conventional convolutional encoder is replaced by a turbo encoder and an
interleaver is replaced by a symbol mapping block. The output sequence of
turbo encoder can be separated into two groups: a systematic bit stream (S)
and a parity bit stream (P). Since the systematic bits have higher priority
than the parity bits in turbo decoding procedure, a performance gain can be
achieved by mapping higher priority bits into higher reliable positions in
16-QAM modulation.

Figure 219: Reliability of bit positions in 16-QAM symbols
Figure 221 shows a structure of symbol mapping. After passing through a rate
matching algorithm, turbo coded bits are separated into systematic bits and
parity bits. As shown in figure 5(a), the turbo coded bits are separated into
two data streams by a bit separation block: systematic bits
{width="1.0416666666666667in" height="0.20833333333333334in"} and parity bits
{width="1.125in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}. These two data streams can
be the inputs to two independent block interleavers (1st and 2nd
interleavers), which perform inter-column block interleaving and are identical
as described in [15]. The two logically-divided interleavers make 16-QAM
symbol mapping feasible, i.e. bits in the higher priority sequence (S*) can be
assigned into higher reliable positions and bits in lower priority sequence
(P*) can be mapped into lower reliable positions on 16-QAM symbols.
In the bit collection mechanism, two data sequences (S* and P*) are parallel-
to-serial converted to a single bit stream (V), where higher priority (H) part
and lower priority (L) part are allocated in an alternating sequence.
Therefore, the output {width="1.2361111111111112in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"} of the bit collection block is collected two
by two from the sequences S* and P*, if {width="0.40555555555555556in"
height="0.14652777777777778in"}. The output of the symbol mapping block is
mapped into 16-QAM symbol, as shown in figure 5(b). It is noted that
{width="0.40555555555555556in" height="0.14652777777777778in"} may not be held
because of different data rates of MCSs. Therefore appropriate techniques will
be required in implementation of the symbol mapping.

### 8.5.2 Performance Evaluation
Performance of turbo coding with 16-QAM with a symbol mapping is evaluated on
link level. Monte Carlo simulations for MCS-7-T4-16QAM, MCS-8-T4-16QAM and
MCS-9-T4-16QAM are performed over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels,
respectively.
Table 82 depicts modulation and coding configuration used in simulations.
Simulation results of each MCS are depicted in figure D.1, figure D.2 and
figure D.3 in annex D, respectively, where burst mapping was not considered.
Figure D.1 shows performance gains of MCS-7-T4-16QAM in terms of BER and Block
Error Rate (BLER) over AWGN and Rayleigh channel. Referring to figure D.1, by
using the symbol mapping performance gains of 0.4 dB have been achieved at BER
of {width="0.3055555555555556in" height="0.2222222222222222in"}and BLER of
{width="0.3055555555555556in" height="0.2222222222222222in"}, respectively.
For Rayleigh fading channel, performance gains of 0.4 dB and 0.2 dB have been
attained for BER and BLER, respectively. Similarly, performance gains have
been attained for MCS-8-T4-16QAM and MCS-9-T4-16QAM. The results are
summarized in table 2.

## 8.6 Higher Order Modulation, Turbo Codes Combined with MS Receiver
Diversity
Source: Reference [26].
### 8.6.1 Simulation Model
The simulation model is described in [7]. The following text explains the
features that are not treated in that contribution.
The antenna correlation is assumed to be zero and the gain imbalance 0 dB.
The interference model is DTS-1 for the single-antenna receiver and DTS-2 for
the dual-antenna receiver. The interferers are GMSK-modulated in both cases.
The signal-to-interference ratio is normalized so that it represents the total
received power after RX filtering, hence including an 18 dB reduction for the
adjacent channel interference. Such approach is taken in order to enable a
fair comparison between DTS-1 and DTS-2.
The channel coding of the MCS5 - MCS9 is carried out with 1/3-rate turbo code.
The internal interleaver and generator polynomials are implemented as
specified for UTRAN [15], the non-systematic parity bits being punctured with
an even-spaced pattern. The number of decoding iterations is fixed to 8, the
decoding algorithm being LOGMAX. No scaling is applied to the extrinsic
information. Turbo coding is applied only for the data bits, while the other
fields of an RLC/MAC block are encoded according to current EGPRS
specification. The simulated modulation and coding schemes are summarized in
table 84.

### 8.6.2 Simulation Results
The simulations are carried out in interference limited and noise limited
environments. In the interference limited scenario, it is assumed that the
highest power levels are never reached and no back off is hence needed. In the
noise limited scenario, it is assumed that the full transmit power is always
used, thus implying that the power of 8-PSK modulated blocks is backed off by
3 dB and the power of 16-QAM modulated blocks by 5 dB.
The link adaptation is assumed to occur in ideal manner without any
incremental redundancy combining. The channel model is TU3iFH.

### 8.6.3 Discussion
#### 8.6.3.1 Interference Limited Scenario
As can be seen from the results, the gains from 16QAM/TC and MSRD are rather
close to additive, i.e. the total gain is close to the sum of the individual
gains in decibel scale. It is also interesting to note that the throughput of
the MSRD/16QAM/TC configuration is close to the throughput of the dual-carrier
up to a CIR of 16 dB.
Most of the throughput gain for 16QAM/TC clearly comes from 16-QAM (see yellow
curve). The only exception is MCS-7, for which about one half of the gain
comes from 16-QAM and one half from the turbo codes. This result is somewhat
contradictory with the system level results of [8], where most of the
throughput gain in cell border and median is reported to come from turbo
codes. One reason for this difference is that no IR is applied in [8], hence
implying that the two highest MCSs are possibly not used very often.
It can be seen from figure 222 that the maximum throughput with MSRD/16QAM/TC
is achieved with the same signal quality where the single-carrier MCS-7 is
switched on. There could be hence some room for higher coding rate MCSs when
MSRD is used.
The results indicate that a throughput gains up to \~30 % could be achieved
with the combination of 16-QAM and turbo codes. However, it is important to
notice that the evaluated scenario represents the performance of 16QAM/TC in
very favourable conditions. It has been already shown in [7] that the
inclusion of non-hopping environment and IR can drastically reduce the
achieved gains. Another impairment that is not visible in the link layer
simulations is the power back off, i.e. it is assumed that the highest power
levels are never touched. This might not be a valid assumption even in the
case of an interference limited network, since the downlink power control is
not necessarily used at all, and on the BCCH layer a constant transmission
power has to be used. As will be shown in next subclause, the inclusion of
full back off can easily translate the achieved gains into loss.
One comment should be made about the performance of the dual-antenna
scenarios. The average DIR of the applied interference scenario (DTS-2) is
expected to be somewhat higher than the average DIR of a typical network
scenario (see e.g. [27]). Hence, the gain from MSRD is expected to be somewhat
optimistic in the given results.
#### 8.6.3.2 Noise Limited Scenario
As can be seen from figure 223, the gain from 16QAM/TC is heavily impacted by
the inclusion of 5 dB back off for 16‑QAM modulation. For MCS-8 and MCS-9
there is a gain of \~10 %, and for MCS-7 a loss of similar magnitude. This
example hence illustrates that the 16QAM/TC does not necessarily bring any
improvement, but can even induce some loss compared to the current EGPRS.
## 8.7 Modified 16-ary Constellations for Higher Order Modulation and Turbo
Coding Schemes
Source: Reference [32].
### 8.7.1 Introduction
A number of circular 16APK (Amplitude Phase Keying) constellations are
compared to the square 16QAM constellation. The modulations are compared in
terms of their PAPR and dynamic range, and their impact on BLER performance.
### 8.7.2 Circular 16APK Constellations
In this subclause two circular constellations are considered. The Circular
16APK(12,4) constellation consists of two concentric circles, the inner one
containing four symbols while the outer one contains the remaining 12 symbols.
The Circular 16APK(8,8) constellation consists of two concentric circles, with
both the inner and outer circles containing 8 symbols, at coincident angles.
The constellation design parameter is the ratio R between the outer and inner
circle radii. Usually values of R may range from 1.2 to 3. The effect of the
parameter R is as follows: larger values of R will generally improve the
performance, while smaller values of R will degrade performance but also lower
the PAPR and dynamic range of the modulation. Examples of 16APK (12,4) and
(8,8) with R=1.5 are given in figures 224 and 225.
In order to avoid transition through the origin between symbols, a rotation of
the constellation is applied between symbol periods, as was done for 8PSK and
the square 16QAM modulation. For 16APK(12,4), the optimal rotation is 5π/12.
For 16APK(8,8), as with 8PSK the optimal rotation is 3π/8.

Figure 225: 16APK (8,8) Constellation
#### 8.7.2.1 PAPR and Dynamic Range Comparison
Table 87 shows a comparison of PAPR and dynamic range for square 16QAM, 8PSK
and circular 16APK in (12,4) and (8,8) constellations with R=1.5 and R=2.0.
The values of PAPR (99.99 %) and Dynamic Range (99.99 %) are shown for each
modulation.
As can be seen, it is possible to make a substantial reduction in PAPR to
around 4dB by using 16APK modulations. From the simulations done in the EDGE
Feasibility Study and reported in [33], a modulation backoff of 4dB has a
minimal impact on system handover performance. It can also be seen that 16APK
(8,8) reduces the dynamic range to 22dB, that is only 5dB above that of 8PSK.
The performance of the 16APK modulations is compared below, with the exception
of 16APK (8,8) with R=2.0 that does not have sufficiently good PAPR and
dynamic range characteristics.

### 8.7.3 Logical Channel Configurations
The channel configurations used for simulations are shown in table 88. The
configurations are used to compare performance of circular 16QAM modulation
with that of MCS7, MCS8 and MCS9. For each of the MCS schemes, 3 other options
are considered, as taken from table 87.

### 8.7.4 Performance Characterisation
The simulations were carried out for both a noise limited environment, and an
interference limited environment. The TU3iFH channel model was used.
It was assumed that for the noise limited case, full transmit power is always
used, implying that the power of 8PSK modulated blocks is backed off by 3.2 dB
and the power of 16QAM/16APK modulated slots according to the relevant PAPR in
table 87.
For the simulations, the impairments detailed in table 89 were used.

#### 8.7.4.1 Uncoded BER Performance
This subclause shows the uncoded BER performance of the 16QAM and 16APK
modulations from table 87. The uncoded BER results are shown in figure 226.
It can be seen that for circular 16APK(12,4) with R=2.0, UBER performance is
about 0.5 dB better compared to 16QAM - helped by the 1.2 dB advantage in
backoff; with R=1.5, UBER performance degraded by about 0.6dB at UBER=10%
though this gap increases noticeably at higher SNRs.
For circular 16APK(8,8) with R=2.0, UBER performance is worse by about 0.2 dB.
With R reduced to 1.5, the UBER as compared to 16QAM is degraded by 0.5 dB.
However, as we shall see in the next subclause on BLER performance, the impact
on BLER performance at the critical points is not severe.

#### 8.7.4.2 BLER Performance
##### 8.7.4.2.1 Sensitivity Limited Channel
Figure 227 shows the BLER performance for MCS7, and the three 16-ary modulated
configurations carrying the same payload as MCS7. Figures 228 and 229 show the
BLER performance for MCS8 and MCS9 respectively.
The results from the sensitivity limited simulations are summarized in table
90. For each configuration the table shows the link layer performance in terms
of SNR at BLER=10%. The gain relative to the relevant EGPRS MCS is also given.
It can be seen that the results for 16APK (12,4) with R=2.0 are slightly
better than 16QAM. For both (12,4) and (8.8) with R=1.5, the gains are
slightly reduced, though provide a good tradeoff for the less stringent
modulation requirements.
##### 8.7.4.2.2 Interference Limited Channel
Figure 230 shows the BLER performance for MCS7, and the three 16-ary modulated
configurations carrying the same payload as MCS7. Figures 231 and 232 show the
BLER performance for MCS8 and MCS9 respectively.
The results from the interference limited simulations are summarized in table
91. For each configuration the table shows the link layer performance in terms
of C/I at BLER=10%. The gain relative to the relevant EGPRS MCS is also given.
For the interference limited cases, the 16APK (12,4) and 16APK (8,8)
modulations perform less well than the 16QAM modulation. However, the gains
compared to EGPRS are still substantial. The 16APK (8,8) modulation with R=1.5
has almost the same performance as the 16APK (12,4) with R=2.0. Of these
modulations, the PAPR and dynamic range of the (8,8) R=1.5 modulation are far
more relaxed.

## 8.7a Blind modulation detection performance
### 8.7a.1 Introduction
When new modulations are introduced, the receiver must blindly detect which
modulation is used for each reveiced radio block. In this subclause, the
performance of blind modulation detection is evaluated. The results are taken
from [44].
### 8.7a.2 Blind modulation detection
Modulation detection in EDGE is made possible by constellation rotation during
the training sequence. The same training sequence is used for GMSK and 8PSK
blocks, but with different rotations; π/2 for GMSK and 3π/8 for 8PSK. This
principle is straightforward to extend to more than two modulations. In this
contribution, the same training sequence but different rotations have been
used for all modulations. The rotation angles are listed in table 91a.
Table 91a. Constellation rotation angles for different modulations.
* * *
Modulation Rotation angle GMSK π/2 8PSK 3π/8 16QAM π/4 32QAM -π/4
* * *
The method for modulation detection used in this contribution is a direct
extension of the method used in state-of-the-art terminals. The rotation is
hypothesised to each of the possible rotations (two for EDGE, four if 16QAM
and 32QAM are added). The residual interference/noise during the training
sequence is calculated for each hypothesis. The modulation giving the least
residual noise/interference is assumed to be the correct one.
In general, the probability of a false modulation detection is higher the more
interference and/or noise that is present. Further, a false modulation
detection will lead to a performance loss only if the data block would have
been correctly decoded with a correct modulation detection.
Therefore, the biggest challenge is not to correctly detect the modulation of
a 16QAM or 32QAM modulated radio block (since these modulations are typically
not used at the very lowest SNR or C/I ratios), but rather to correctly detect
the modulation of a robustly encoded GMSK modulated radio block. Therefore,
the main results in the next clauses show performance impact on MCS-1, the MCS
that is used in the worst radio conditions. The performance impact on other
MCS:s will be less. MCS-5 performance is also shown to exemplify this.
NOTE: According to the HOT proposal, the HOT MS would not use regular MCS-5
but a turbo encoded version of it. Therefore, the performance of the HOT MS
would be better than the EGPRS MS. However, in order to allow a comparison
with EGPRS (to assess the loss due to blind detection with more candidates),
regular MCS-5 was used also for the HOT MS in the simulations. It should be
noted however that with the method used in EGPRS, the modulation detection
performance is not dependent on the channel coding nor the modulation, only on
the number of candidate modulations and the radio conditions.
### 8.7a.3 Simulation conditions
Results are shown for the following scenarios (all for the 900 MHz band):
  * Sensitivity: TU50 ideal FH, HT100 no FH and RA250 no FH
  * Interference: DTS-2, TU50 ideal FH
Further, the following receiver types are evaluated:
  * Single-antenna receiver (no diversity)
  * Dual-antenna receiver with maximum ratio combining
  * Dual-antenna receiver with interference cancellation
10000 radio blocks were run per simulation point.
### 8.7a.4 Results
The results are presented as the relative performance loss at 10% total BLER
(i.e., including errors in stealing flags, header and data) when the receiver
has to blindly select between GMSK, 8PSK, 16QAM and 32QAM, compared to EDGE
(that has to select only between GMSK and 8PSK). Results are show for MCS-1
and MCS-5. Detailed results can be found in [44].

### 8.7a.5 Discussion
The loss due to blind modulation detection is negligible (at most 0.1 dB) in
all scenarios. The reason is that even if the modulation detection performance
is slightly less robust with four candidate modulations instead of two, it is
still much more reliable than the decoding of the data itself.
Still, it is possible to create artificial situations where the modulation
detection performance actually has an impact on the BLER performance. For
instance, in the extreme case of an MCS-1 block interfered by a single
adjacent channel interferer and received by a dual-antenna receiver with
interference cancellation, the C/I level required to decode the data block is
in the region of -40 to -20 dB. At this level, modulation detection is more
challenging. When this scenario was simulated for different channel profiles,
a BLER loss of up to 1 dB was seen (see [44] for details).
## 8.7b Impact of using higher order modulations on the BCCH carrier
### 8.7b.1 Introduction
If higher order modulations are used on the BCCH carriers, the necessary power
decrease would result in biased neighbour cell measurements, which could have
an impact on cell selection.
This problem was faced and evaluated when EDGE was introduced in release 99
‎(see [33]). Power decreases of up to 4 dB were evaluated and the impact
considered acceptable.
In this subclause, larger power decreases, corresponding to the necessary
levels for 16QAM and 32QAM when used on the BCCH carrier, are investigated.
### 8.7b.2 Impact on cell selection and reselection
#### 8.7b.2.1 Simulation assumptions
To investigate the impact of non-constant BCCH power some simple system level
simulations are run. The simulator is a static (snapshot) system simulator.
The effect of the non-constant BCCH carrier power is modelled by subtracting
the APD (average power decrease) from the pathgain for some of the BS
candidates before cell selection is made. To model a handover hysteresis the
MS randomly selects a BS within 3 dB from the strongest. Further assumptions
are given in table 91e.
Table 91e. Simulation assumptions.
+--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | Simulation Assumptions | | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | Frequency reuse | 4/12 | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | Frequency hopping | No | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | Resource utilization | 50% | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | Traffic mix | 50% GMSK modulated speech | | | | | | 50% packet-switched data | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | Average Power Decrease (APD) | GMSK: 0 dB | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | | 8PSK: 3.3 dB | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | | 16QAM: 5.3 dB | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | | 32QAM: 5.6 dB | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | Pathloss | L = C + 35 log (d) | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | Log-normal fading standard deviation | 6 dB | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | Multipath fading | Not included | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------+
Four different scenarios, with different modulations of the data traffic are
studied:
  1. 100% GMSK
  2. 100% 8PSK
  3. 100% 16QAM
  4. 100% 32QAM
The data traffic is assumed to be 50% of the total traffic on the BCCH
carriers on average (the rest is GMSK modulated speech or control channels).
This can be seen as a worst case, since a lower or higher penetration would
result in a more stable power level on the BCCH carriers.
It should be noted that the assumption that all data traffic uses the highest
possible modulation is pessimistic (from an APD point of view). Thus, the
evaluated scenarios (especially scenario 4) should be considered as a worst
case scenario.
#### 8.7b.2.2 Results and discussion
Figure 232a to 232d show received signal strength (C) and carrier to
interference ratio (C/I) distributions for up- and downlink.
{width="5.1875in" height="3.875in"}

Figure 232c. Downlink distribution of C/I.
{width="5.1875in" height="3.8875in"}
Figure 232e. Uplink distribution of C/I.
It is seen that the impact on C and C/I distributions is moderate. In scenario
4 (50% GMSK modulated speech, 50% 32QAM modulated data), 4% of the users have
a downlink C/I worse than 10 dB. This should be compared to the EDGE-like
scenario 2 (50% GMSK modulated speech, 50% 8PSK modulated data), in which 3.4%
of the users have a downlink C/I worse than 10 dB. If all traffic on the BCCH
is GMSK modulated (scenario 1), the corresponding figure is 3%. In uplink, the
impact is very similar.
Fast fading is not modelled in these simulations. If fast fading was included,
the variance of the MS power (RXLEV) measurements would be much larger and
hence the cell selection decisions less reliable. The signal strength can
easity vary by \~20 dB due to fast fading. Averaged over a measurement period,
the variation is smaller but could still be in the order of several dB. In
addition, the RXLEV measurements are assumed to be ideal. In reality, the
RXLEV measurements are allowed a certain inaccuracy. The effect of APD is
likely less if these effects are taken into account.
### 8.7b.3 Impact on GPRS/EGPRS MS open loop power control
In GPRS and EGPRS, the MS power is set according to the following formula:
where $C$ is the received signal level at the MS on either the BCCH or PDCH,
and $\alpha \in \left\lbrack 0,1 \right\rbrack$ is a system parameter
determining the ratio between open and closed loop power control used. In case
the BCCH is used for deriving $C$, the result of an $Y$ dB APD on the BCCH
would be that the MS in the worst case 'underestimates' the received power by
$Y$ dB, and consequently -- in cases down regulation is invoked - transmits
with a $\alpha \cdot Y$dB too high power.
## 8.7c Multiplexing higher order modulation MS with legacy MS
### 8.7c.1 Introduction
If higher order modulation MS are multiplexed with legacy GPRS/EGPRS MS on the
same downlink PDCH:s, the USF (uplink state flag), when transmitted with 16QAM
or 32QAM, cannot be received by a legacy MS. Therefore, multiplexing losses
may occur.
This problem was faced already when EDGE was introduced in release 99, as 8PSK
modulated EGPRS USF:s cannot be read by GPRS MS.
In this subclause, the multiplexing issues of higher order modulations are
investigated. The higher order modulation and turbo coding feature will be
referred to as _HOT_ (Higher Order modulations and Turbo codes), and MS
supporting it _HOT MS_.
### 8.7c.2 Background and problem description
In GPRS and EGPRS, the scheduling of MS transmission in the uplink is
controlled by the BSS. An information field in each block on a downlink PDCH,
the USF (uplink state flag), tells the MS:s listening to the PDCH on which
block(s) on corresponding uplink PDCH(s) it is allowed to transmit.
When EGPRS MS are multiplexed with GPRS MS on the same PDCH, it was necessary
to assure that GPRS MS could be scheduled for uplink transmission, even if
EGPRS blocks were sometimes sent on the downlink. When GMSK modulated EGPRS
downlink blocks are transmitted, the USF is encoded in such a way that GPRS MS
can decode it. On the other hand, when 8PSK modulated EGPRS downlink blocks
are transmitted, only USF:s to EGPRS MS can be transmitted. To minimise the
losses due to this, the following means can be used:
  1. Use USF granularity. This means that one USF schedules not one but four uplink blocks to the same MS. During the first of four downlink blocks, the USF is transmitted with GMSK modulation. In the three remaining downlink blocks, no scheduling information is needed and any modulation can be used on the downlink.
  2. To the largest extent possible, coordinate the downlink and uplink scheduling, in order to transmit downlink blocks to an MS that prefers GMSK (GPRS MS or EGPRS MS in bad radio conditions) when a GPRS MS is scheduled in the uplink.
  3. If, for some reason, an EGPRS downlink block has to be transmitted at the same time as a GPRS MS is scheduled in the uplink, a GMSK modulated MCS is chosen for the downlink block, even if an 8PSK modulated MCS would have been more suitable for the (good) radio conditions.
These methods are proven to work in practice, since indeed GPRS and EGPRS MS
are multiplexed on the same PDCH:s. The same methods can be used when HOT MS
are multiplexed with legacy MS. In the following subclauses, the performance
of this is evaluated by means of simulations.
### 8.7c.3 Simulation setup
#### 8.7c.3.1 Simulator description
The simulator used is a dynamic GSM/EDGE traffic simulator with channel
management, DL scheduling and UL scheduling. The traffic model used is file
download and file upload with fixed file sizes (100 kB). MCSs are chosen based
on the specified CIR and the MS capabilities. The mix of HOT and EDGE mobile
stations is specified as HOT penetration. The HOT penetration is swept from 0%
to 100 % in steps of 10%. The offered traffic load is specified as a
percentage (70 or 80) of the theoretical cell capacity (kbps/cell) at HOT
penetration 0% and for the given CIR level (for the corresponding MCS which is
chosen for that CIR).
Radio link modelling is simplified, with a fixed CIR for all users. MCSs are
chosen (to maximise throughput) based on the specified CIR and the MS
capabilities. Block errors are assumed to be independent.
Simulation parameters are summarised in table 91f.
Table 91f. Summary of simulation parameters.
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Parameter | Value | +-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | TRXs per cell | 2 (16 timeslots) | +-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Multislot class | Class 32 (i.e., Rx=5, Tx=3, Sum=6) | | | | | | Up to 5+1 for downlink users | | | | | | Up to 3+3 for uplink users | +-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Traffic model | FTP download/upload | | | | | | 100 kB packet size | | | | | | Poisson user arrival process. | | | | | | A user leaves the system when download/upload is | | | completed. | +-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | USF granularity | 1 or 4 for EDGE MS | | | | | | 1 for HOT MS | +-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
It is assumed that HOT MS can decode the USF of legacy blocks as well as
16/32QAM modulated blocks while the EDGE MS can only decode the USF of 8PSK
modulated blocks (and GMSK modulated blocks; however, GMSK is not used in the
simulations). Since HOT is a candidate Rel-7 feature, it is assumed that the
fraction of MS supporting only GPRS is small and can be approximated to 0 when
HOT is available on the market.
#### 8.7c.3.2 Scheduling strategies
Two strategies are investigated:
  1. Strategy 1 does not take the USF problem into account. If a downlink block is sent with 16/32QAM modulation, containing a USF to a legacy MS, the legacy MS will not receive the USF and no transmission will occur in the corresponding uplink block. The USF granularity is 1 for all users.
  2. Strategy 2 is a simple attempt to reduce the USF problem. If there is a conflict between preferred downlink modulation (16/32QAM) and USF decoding, the MCS of the downlink block is reduced to an 8PSK modulated one. USF granularity 4 is used for EDGE MSs and USF granularity 1 for HOT MSs.
Strategy 2 corresponds to a combination of bullet 1 and 3 in subclause 8.7c.2.
Note that this is still a very simple strategy that does not attempt to
coordinate uplink and downlink scheduling. More sophisticated strategies would
be used in practice.
#### 8.7c.3.3 Performance measure
Performance is shown as the relative gain (at a certain HOT penetration) of
the mean user throughput (mean over users) compared to that for HOT
penetration 0%. The user throughput is defined as the number of
downloaded/uploaded bits divided by the download/upload time. The
download/upload time comprises transmission time, scheduling delays, TBF set-
up delays and TCP impact.
#### 8.7c.3.4 MS capabilities and MCS selection
It is assumed that HOT capable MSs can use up to MTCS-12-32QAM (i.e., HOT
level 2). The MCS with the highest throughput for the given CIR is selected
(i.e., no link adaptation is used). MCS choices and block error probabilities
are summarised in table 91g (see Annex B for further details).

HOT MS.

For the case with DL transmissions to HOT mobiles, which are adjusted for EDGE
UL scheduling, MTCS-6 is used in the simulations. The block error probability

### 8.7c.4 Results and discussion
#### 8.7c.4.1 Case 1: EDGE/HOT mix on downlink, EDGE on uplink
In this subclause, there is a mix of EDGE and HOT MS. In the uplink, it is
assumed that all MS use EDGE.
The results are shown in figure 232e to figure 232h for two different loads
(70% and 80%) and two different CIR levels (15 dB and 35 dB). Additional
results can be found in [46]. The figures show significant performance gains
on the downlink, but performance loss on the uplink for scheduling strategy 1.
However, scheduling strategy 2 (modulation fallback and granularity 4)
eliminates this loss. The large downlink gain is a combination of increased
transmission bitrate and decreased scheduling delays. The reason for the
decreased scheduling delays is the decrease in channel utilization (i.e. that
less time is needed to serve the offered traffic).
In fact, there seems to be also a small UL gain for scheduling strategy 2\.
This gain (albeit small and uncertain) is probably related to the
implementation of the channel handling and scheduling in the simulator. There
are two factors that might affect the performance depending on HOT
penetration. One is the uplink scheduling of the mix of EDGE MSs (granularity
4) and HOT MSs (granularity 1). A perfectly fair scheduling of users with
different granularity might be hard to achieve. A possible result of slight
unfairness can then be a gain in the mean user throughput. This would
(partially) explain why there appears to be small gains at (certain)
penetrations between 0% and 100%.
The other factor is the downlink channel utilization (or the number of TBFs)
which decreases as the HOT penetration increases. This might have impact on
the uplink performance since the uplink TBF allocation in the simulator also
takes the downlink TBF occupancies into account. Depending on present multi-
slot classes, a higher downlink load might lead to more uneven uplink TBF
distribution over the channels and thereby more uplink channel sharing and
scheduling delays. This would explain why there appears to be a small gain at
100% penetration.
NOTE: The curves are a bit shaky in some plots, due to a somewhat limited
statistical confidence. Therefore, some caution is necessary when interpreting
the results. E.g., in some plots, the downlink performance with scheduling
strategy 2 sometimes appears to be slightly better than strategy 1. This could
in principle be due to that there is some impact of the improved uplink
efficiency on the downlink TBF allocation, but is more likely just due to
statistical variations. Longer simulations would remove this shakiness. Still,
the trend in all results clearly shows that the multiplexing issue to a large
extent can be removed by simple means.

#### 8.7c.4.2 Case 2: EDGE/HOT mix on downlink, EDGE/HOT mix on uplink
In this subclause, there is a mix of EDGE and HOT MS in both uplink and
downlink. Obviously, HOT is not proposed for uplink; a better choice would
have been using HUGE for uplink. However, no link performance results for HUGE
were available when these simulations were run. The use of HOT performance for
uplink can be seen as a (slightly pessimistic) estimate of HUGE performance.
The results are shown in figure 232i to figure 232l for two different loads
(70% and 80%) and two different CIR levels (15 dB and 35 dB). Additional
results can be found in annex [46]. The figures show significant performance
gains on the downlink, but performance loss on the uplink for scheduling
strategy 1 and low to moderate HOT penetration and low CIR. However,
scheduling strategy 2 (modulation fallback and granularity 4) eliminates this
loss and yields a significant performance gain.
The large gains at high penetration levels are a combination of increased
transmission bitrate and decreased scheduling delays. The reason for the
decreased scheduling delays is the decrease in channel utilization (i.e. that
less time is needed to serve the offered traffic).

#### 8.7c.4.3 Discussion
The simulations show that if no means are taken to solve the issue of
multiplexing HOT MS and EDGE MS, there are indeed multiplexing losses. They
also show that the losses can be almost completely avoided with a very simple
strategy.
## 8.8 Incremental Redundancy for Higher Order Modulation and Turbo Coding
Schemes (HOMTC)
Source: Reference [36].
### 8.8.1 Introduction
The current EGPRS capability includes an ARQ mechanism [22]. This allows for
re-transmission of blocks that have failed to be decoded correctly on first or
subsequent transmissions, using Link Adaptation and/or Incremental Redundancy.
The receiver side signals back to the transmission side using ACK/NACK
messages, and the relevant block can be re-transmitted using either different
puncturing of the initial MCS for the block, or a MCS in the same family.
Hybrid ARQ using IR was an important conceptual step in the transition from
GPRS, and provides considerable additional throughput. This is a component
that is important to retain for inclusion within HOMTC.
This subclause discusses how Type I and Type II ARQ capabilities can be
included for the HOMTC proposal.
### 8.8.2 EGPRS ARQ Scheme
The payload structure currently used in EGPRS is currently built around 3
\"families\" of MCSs as shown in 233. This format was originally proposed
during the EDGE Feasibility Study (e.g.[37]). The family structure is
constructed such that units of data already segmented from the Logical Link
Control (LLC) layer can be transmitted using different MCSs depending on
prevailing signal conditions. Alternatively, the punctured redundancy versions
for each MCS allow for incremental redundancy.
For example, consider Family A. The data is segmented in multiples of 37 octet
units. Say a MCS9 block is transmitted. This contains 2 RLC packet data units
(PDU) each one of 74 octets (2x37). Suppose that one of the PDU fails to be
decoded on reception. If the separately (very robustly) coded header block is
decoded, or if a higher block sequence number (BSN) is received, then the
block is known by the receiver to have failed. This failure is indicated by MS
uplink ACK/NACK signalling to the base station (BTS) for the case of downlink
transmissions (and vice versa for uplink). There are then a number of options
for re-sending the data (the detailed explanation is given in [38], subclause
8.1.1):
i) the failed PDU can be re-transmitted either as a PDU in another MCS9 block
using a different redundancy version;
ii) it can be re-transmitted as the content of an MCS6 block; or
iii) the 74 octet PDU can be split down into 2 separate 37 octet blocks, each
of which is re-encoded separately as 2 MCS blocks. These are transmitted using
MCS3 with signalling that the original PDU has been re-segmented.
It is noted that the MCS7, MCS8 and MCS9 channel coding schemes have 2 RLC
PDUs, each of which is separately encoded before combination into the MCS.
This was done because for convolutional coded blocks the probability of a
block error reduces as the length of the block decreases. As noted during the
EDGE Feasibility study [37], if this split is not done, and a 4x37 octet PDU
is encoded with a single convolutional coded block the BLER performance
becomes poor.
Turbo codes perform in the opposite manner. As is well known [39], the
performance improves as the information length in a coded block becomes
longer. This principle is used in the next subclause.

Figure 233: General description of the Modulation and Coding Schemes for EGPRS
### 8.8.3 Concept Proposal for ARQ with HOMTC
As we noted, in EGPRS the payloads for the higher MCSs were split to avoid the
poorer performance when using higher coding rate blocks with convolutional
coding. In this subclause we first examine the Turbo code structure, and note
simulation data showing that for HOMTC, the performance is improved by
encoding the payload as a single block. The proposal for management of ARQ and
Link Adaptation is then discussed.
#### 8.8.3.1 Turbo Coding Block Structure
The 3GPP RAN Turbo code is a Parallel concatenated code [15]. The structure is
shown in figure 234. It is a Rate 1/3 code, with the output bits being
systematic bits (the original information bits), plus 2 parity bits. There are
2 separate parity coding structures; the 1^st^ encoder uses the information
bits in the original order; the 2^nd^ encoder uses the information bits after
the internal Turbo interleaver. The internal interleaver causes the original
bit order to be lost in parity 2 calculation - this produces a useful effect
in terms of decoding in that, for the block lengths considered for HOMTC, we
will not observe frame errors where only one half of the information data is
in error. Either the complete block is correctly decoded, or neither half.
This behaviour was verified in simulation. The same is also seen when
simulating MCS8 and MCS9 as single and double blocks.
{width="3.811111111111111in" height="2.6979166666666665in"}
Figure 234: Structure of rate 1/3 Turbo coder (dotted lines apply for trellis
termination only)
The comparison of performance for single and double RLC PDU blocks has been
reported in [31]. It has been seen that, for Turbo coded configurations there
is a clear advantage in encoding the information as a single RLC PDU. As was
seen in the EDGE Feasibility study [37], this is not the case for
convolutional coding, and so in the EDGE standardization process the data was
split into 2 RLC PDUs for the higher MCSs.
The implication of this is that there is no reason to retain the split used in
EGPRS for MCS7, MCS and MCS9 when using Turbo coding. As is seen in [31],
performance degrades for shortened blocks.
#### 8.8.3.2 RLC/MAC Operation for HOMTC
As with EGPRS, the transfer of RLC Data Blocks in the acknowledged RLC/MAC
mode can be controlled by a selective type I ARQ mechanism, or by type II
hybrid ARQ (incremental redundancy (IR)) mechanism, coupled with the numbering
of the RLC Data Blocks within one Temporary Block Flow. The sending side (the
MS or the network) transmits blocks within a window and the receiving side
sends Packet Uplink Ack/Nack or Packet Downlink Ack/Nack message when needed.
The ARQ mechanism is considered for 3 cases:
i) Type I ARQ with Link Adaptation.
ii) Type II Hybrid ARQ with no intra block Link Adaptation.
iii) Type II Hybrid ARQ with intra block Link Adaptation.
##### 8.8.3.2.1 Type I ARQ for HOMTC with Link Adaptation
The concept for Type I ARQ is almost identical to that for EGPRS. A slight
modification is made to take advantage of the improved performance of Turbo
coded blocks as the source code block length increases, and also to exploit
the potential for higher throughput from the Higher order 16-ary modulation.
The new MCSs are shown in table 93; for reference current EGPRS MCSs are shown
in table 92.
Existing MCS7, MCS8 and MCS9 payloads are modified so the payload is encoded
as a single PDU. These are configurations MCS7-T4-16APK, MCS8-T4-16APK and
MCS9-T4-16APK in table 93.
The MCS10-T4-16APK and MCS11-T4-16APK coding schemes are included to provide
higher throughputs. The payloads for these are now aligned with existing MCS
families.
The usage of the family structure is then as for EGPRS.

NOTE. For code rates below R=0.33, the rate is an effective one created by
repetition of bit according to 3GPP TS 25.212 rate matching. The Turbo code
mother code rate is R=0.33.
##### 8.8.3.2.2 Type II Hybrid ARQ for HOMTC
The method proposed for Type II HARQ with HOMTC is similar to that for EGPRS,
however the limitation regarding how re-transmissions may be done is removed.
Currently, on re-segmenting a payload, the new payload parts are separately
re-encoded and the re-segmentation is signalled. This occurs for example on
re-transmission of data from MCS6 block using MCS3 \- 2 MCS3 blocks need to be
transmitted to transfer the original, and no capability of incremental
redundancy combining is available.
The following gives a description of how the modified HARQ would work. First
we consider the case without LA, and then the case with LA.
##### 8.8.3.2.2.1 No Link Adaptation {#no-link-adaptation .H6}
Consider a simplified example of a short block, ignoring tail bits also for
simplicity. Suppose we have an information block of 16 information bits,
{width="0.625in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}. This is encoded as:
{width="1.9583333333333333in" height="0.2222222222222222in"}
where {width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.20833333333333334in"} and
{width="0.25in" height="0.20833333333333334in"} are the parity bits output
with the _kth_ systematic bit. Suppose we transmit the code word using 16APK
with initial code rate 1. Then, until the codeword is correctly decoded, the
transmission redundancy versions might follow a pattern such as that shown
below (see note). On the first transmission, 16 systematic bits are sent. If
the block is not received correctly, Transmission 2 is sent using a punctured
redundancy version of 16 bits. This can be combined at the receiver for an
additional attempt to decode. If, again the block is not received correctly,
Transmission 3 is sent using another redundancy version of the bits. At this
point all bits have been transmitted at least once. Again, an attempt at
decoding is made. Should this fail the redundancy version sequence is repeated
until the block is correctly decoded. At each stage the newly received bits
can be combined with those received in previous punctured versions of the
block, in order to improve the initial data input to the Turbo decoder.
Transmission 1: {width="0.625in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}
Transmission 2: {width="1.5694444444444444in" height="0.2222222222222222in"}
Transmission 3: {width="1.5694444444444444in" height="0.2222222222222222in"}
NOTE. The precise redundancy versions should be set to allow use of 3GPP RAN
rate matching algorithms[15].

##### _8.8.3.2.2.2 With Link Adaptation_ {#with-link-adaptation .H6}
This subclause now considers an extension to the case of subclause
8.8.3.2.2.1, where in this case a change of modulation is allowed. As above,
the first transmission of the block is as for Transmission 1. Suppose that LA
now occurs, and the transmissions will be made using 8PSK instead of 16APK
(see note).
NOTE. In the case of moving from 8PSK to GMSK (MCS6 to MCS3), this results in
a loss of previously received data.
Instead of dumping previously transmitted data from the higher modulation (as
happens in re-segmentation from MCS6 to MCS3), it would be preserved on
switching modulation. The new modulation scheme, say 8PSK, is used as a medium
to continue bit transfer of the coded data block that we have already started
transmission using 16APK. The advance of the coding rate for the cases with
and without modulation change is shown in table 94. This gives an advantage
over EGPRS when switching modulations. Additionally, it is possible that the
receiver will decode the source data after only one transmission over 8PSK,
instead of 2 blocks over 8PSK as would be done using the EGPRS concept,
thereby improving the throughput.
With regard to how to distribute the un-punctured bits for each re-
transmission, a number of approaches could be taken. One possibility is to
treat the 8PSK re-transmissions similar to split block, transmitting first the
early part of the puncturing sequence, then on the next block transmitting the
late part of the next sequence (see figure 235 (b)). Alternatively, the rate
matching can be configured to distribute the un-punctured bits evenly
throughout the coded block for each re-transmission (see figure 235 (c)). It
is expected that Option 2 will give better performance.
##### 8.8.3.2.3 Header Format
Some modification of the header format will be required to manage the
signalling of a block using different modulation sequences.
Note that it is possible that the header of the first version of the BSN
transmission is not decoded correctly, and then the modulation is changed.
There are 2 options for how to handle this. The first option is to include in
the ACK/NACK signalling a flag bit for each block not correctly received, that
indicates if the header was decoded or not. A block whose header was not
decoded yet, can be moved to a different MCS in the family as no redundancy
information is yet stored at the receiver. Another option is not to signal
this, and to allow the transmitter to change modulation in the middle of a
block and allow the IR combining mechanism to reduce the code rate. It is
anticipated that the second option is probably preferable. It avoids the
modification to the ACK/NACK; and also the throughput performance is improved
by using the longer source block length.
#### 8.8.3.3 USF Signalling
In most cases that there are EGPRS and HOMTC MSs operating in the same cell,
it will be possible to avoid any multiplexing loss. Strategies such as
allocation to different hop sequences and timeslots, and intelligent
alignments of signalling USFs for EGPRS only mobiles can mitigate most of the
impact. However, there will be cases that there is no choice but to signal a
USF to an EGPRS mobile on a block used for DL to a HOMTC mobile. In this case
we should avoid the severe multiplexing loss that occurred by multiplexing in
EGPRS over a previously GPRS service. If we were using MCS7 for transmission,
then the EGPRS family would push us down to MCS2 to signal to a GPRS MS.
However, in principle there is no reason to do this with HOMTC. As described
in subclause 8.8.3.2.2.2, we can use 8PSK modulation to provide an additional
redundancy version of a previously transmitted block with minimal impact on
the throughput.
## 8.8a **Modulation Order and symbol Rate Enhancement (MORE) [48]**
In this subclause, the combination of higher order modulation with 20 % higher
symbol rate is investigated.
### 8.8a.1 Concept Description
The concept includes the following **_elements :_**
  * higher order modulations (16-ary and 32-ary modulations)
  * higher symbol rate (the same as for HUGE, i.e. 325 ksymbols/s)
  * slightly broader pulse shaping than the linearised GMSK (similar to HUGE)
  * use of both convolutional and turbo codes
### 8.8a.2 Discussion of the Concept
#### 8.8a.2.1 Benefits
**_Synergies between HUGE and MORE_** related to modulation, coding schemes,
increased symbol rate and pulse shaping can be exploited.
MORE **_can be_** **_combined with MSRD_** to achieve good performance already
at moderate C/I ratios and hence increase the spectral efficiency.
MORE **_can be_** **_combined with downlink dual carrier_** to achieve higher
peak data rates on the downlink. Up to a quadrupling of the EDGE data rate is
possible using 32-ary modulation, which would allow peak data rates of
approximately 950 kbps for a MS with 4 TS.
A phased approach is proposed which allows for **_proper interoperability
testing_** of mobiles with networks based on a phased implementation for both
mobiles and networks.
MORE **_takes into account legacy networks_** by including improvements to
throughput and spectral efficiency on basis of 8-PSK modulation.
Together with HUGE, MORE can provide both **_higher spectral efficiency and
higher peak data rates_** for operators with scarce radio resources, relying
on symmetrical single carrier traffic channel deployments. Hence the GERAN
Evolution performance requirements are met.
In combination with improvements being standardized under the latency
reductions work item, HUGE and MORE can provide bearers for **_support of
bidirectional real-time data or conversational services_** over PS.
Hence MORE provides a **_future proof path for GSM/GERAN operators_**
intending to deploy GERAN Evolution features.
#### 8.8a.2.2 Drawbacks
Higher symbol rates with 16-ary and 32-ary modulations may not be supported on
many legacy networks. However, as 8-PSK with 325 ksymbols/s is also considered
as an option for the downlink, some legacy networks might be able to support
at least the first level of the proposed downlink enhancements.
One additional work item is to be treated. However given synergies between
HUGE and MORE, the **_additional standardisation effort_** due to MORE should
be rather moderate and the standardization of MORE can even be time aligned
with HUGE.
### 8.8a.3 Performance Estimation
In this section, the performance of an example coding scheme is studied at
higher symbol rate and different bandwidths. Studying different bandwidths is
of greater importance because it might be necessary to limit the bandwidth of
transmission on the downlink to today\'s bandwidth despite the higher symbol
rate as greater adjacent channel interference might have more impact on legacy
mobiles unlike HUGE where most networks are expected to cope with the higher
interference using diversity reception.
For this initial study, linearised GMSK pulse shaping is assumed. It is
expected that the performance shown in this contribution could be bettered
using enhanced pulse shapes. For the purpose of simulations, an ideal single
antenna receiver for the downlink without RF impairments is assumed.
At this time no new coding schemes for higher symbol rate are defined. It
should be noted that by using transmissions at higher symbol rate, there is
space for more symbols in a given burst.
With 1.2 times the legacy symbol rate (325 ksymbols/s), we have 20 % more room
for additional symbols and hence additional bits. One way of using this
additional space is to have more robust coding for the data. Hence, for
comparison, we selected two EGPRS coding schemes - MCS-8 @ 0.92 code rate and
MCS-7 \@0.76 code rate. Note that the relation between the code rates of the
two coding schemes is a factor of 1.21 which is close to what could be gained
using additional symbols from increased symbol rate. The performance of a
legacy transmission using MCS-8 is then compared with that of MCS-7 with
legacy and new pulse shape and the channel is run at higher symbol rate. The
impact of additional inter symbol interference due to wider pulse shape in
terms of symbol periods (depending on pulse width) is modeled. The delay
spread of the channel in terms of symbol periods also increases at higher
symbol rate and this effect is also modeled in the link simulator. Three
different bandwidths are considered for the simulations as shown in Figure
232.b1. The spectra of the modulated signals are measured during the
simulation and Figure 232.a1 shows the spectra. It can be seen that when 20 %
higher bandwidth is allowed for the modulated signal, the spectrum mask cannot
be met (red curve in). However, by reducing the bandwidth of the signal (green
and blue curves) it is possible to meet the spectrum mask. The performance of
these modulated signals is studied and is compared with transmission at legacy
symbol rate (Figure 232.b1).

{width="4.94375in" height="5.038888888888889in"}
Figure 232.b1: Expected performance of higher symbol rate coding schemes
From the above results, it could be observed that though there is some loss
(\~ 0.5 to 1dB) in performance due to higher symbol rate without corresponding
bandwidth increase; it is still possible to have huge gains (almost 5 dB in
the simulated case @ 10% FER). Since most of the gain is coming because of
additional code space, it is expected that such gains are not possible for all
coding schemes (in particular coding schemes which are already robustly coded
may have lesser gains). Under sensitivity limited conditions, a higher inter
symbol interference will result in slightly lower coverage as the peak to
average ratio of the signal will then be slightly higher. However, as can be
seen from the performance improvement shown in Figure 232.a, it is expected
that a considerable improvement can still be achieved.
It can hence be concluded that even at the current bandwidth, the performance
of the coding schemes at higher symbol rate is significantly better and thus
it is expected that MORE could be deployed on the downlink with out any impact
to the legacy mobiles.
## 8.9 Implementation Impact
There are a number of alternatives when applying higher order modulations with
increasing degree of impact to consider:
a) Replacing 8-PSK with 16-QAM for MCS-8 and MCS-9 only with the same user
data rate (case B in subclause 8.4.1.3). The impact is mainly on the RF
receiver and transmitter.
b) Modify MCS-8 and MCS-9 as above and in addition add new coding scheme for
16-QAM to increase the available peak rate (case C in chapter 8.4.1.3). This
option will increase the peak user data rate as well. Thus the handling of
data flows with higher rates need to be considered.
c) Modify MCS-8 and MCS-9 as above and in addition add new coding schemes for
16-QAM and 32-QAM (case D in subclause 8.4.1.3). The impact is similar to
option b, but requests even better receiver/transmitter performance as well a
handling of higher user data rates.
In addition the modifications could be applied to DL only or both UL and DL.
The improvement in performance and capacity due to higher order modulations
will require modest increases in computational complexity at the receiver. The
complexity of channel estimation, prefilter calculation, AFC etc. are in the
same order as in the case of 8-PSK modulation. However, the equalizer
complexity is increased depending on the modulation level. Depending on the
implementation structure, the complexity increases between linearly and
exponential. Using RSSE implementation may drastically reduce the complexity
increase with moderate impact on performance, see subclauses 8.3.3 and
8.4.3.8.
To include improved performance and capacity due to higher order modulations
will require EVM performance of the transmitter for these modulations to be
comparable with that for 8-PSK. This may put more stringent requirements on PA
linearity and, to some extent, on synthesizer noise characteristics.
### 8.9.1 Impacts on the Mobile Station
If higher order modulation is applied to DL only, then the main impact is the
increased complexity of the receiver as described above.
The capability to receive and decode correctly QAM modulations need to be
signalled in classmark 3 and MS-RAC, so the network know which coding schemes
that could be used to each mobile. In addition, if new coding schemes are
introduced, new capabilities for this need to be introduced.
If applied to UL as well, the challenge is to keep EVM low enough for the
higher order modulations. Mainly this will put requirements on synthesizer
noise and on PA linearity. The maximum output power may decrease by 2 dB
compared to 8-PSK.
The capability to transmit QAM modulations need to be signalled in classmark 3
and MS-RAC.
### 8.9.2 Impacts on the BSS
If higher order modulation is applied to DL only, then the main impact is the
potentially more stringent requirements on PA and synthesizer for keeping EVM
approximately constant for all modulations. However, if only 16-QAM is
considered, there is fair chance that the HW impact is small or none. The
impact on HW depends on the performance of present 8-PSK BSS. The increase of
PAR may reduce the available maximum output power for QAM-modulations by 2 dB
compared to 8-PSK, assuming the power capability of present BTSs is unchanged.
If applied to UL as well, then the main impact is the increased complexity of
the receiver as described above. If peak user data rate is increased, the
handling of higher peak data flow also needs to be considered.
Thus introducing only 16-QAM on MCS-8 and MCS-9 will probably affect only SW.
### 8.9.3 Impacts on the Core Network
The impact on core network is negligible and only on SW. Addition of new
signalling parameter is as simple as any other new feature.

# 9 Dual symbol rate and modified dual symbol rate
## 9.1 Introduction
This paragraph proposes two alternative uplink concepts: Dual Symbol Rate
(DSR) and Modified Dual Symbol Rate (MDSR) for Future GERAN evolution to
double bitrates in uplink. DSR doubles the modulation rate in the transmitter
of the mobile station and MDSR combines higher symbol rate (3/2) with 16QAM
and optionally with QPSK. Both options offer about similar bit rates and
performance in uplink e.g. 1.8 to 1.9 times higher average bit rates at
coverage and 1.7 to 1.9 times higher bit rates at interference limited
scenarios.
The main benefit of MDSR is the narrower signal bandwidth of two 200 kHz GSM
channels instead of three in the case of DSR. This could simplify dual
transceiver implementation compared to DSR e.g. narrower channel filter may be
applied and oscillators are not needed to tune out of 200 kHz channel raster.
It was found earlier that DSR and MDSR with 2.0 and 1.5 times higher symbol
rates clearly exceed the given performance objectives on coverage and spectral
efficiency but that two legacy TRX implementation option was not favoured.
Optimisation of MDSR concept for single legacy TRX implementation may be done
by removing the 100 kHz offset and reducing the symbol rate further e.g. to
1.2 (6/5) or 1.33 (4/3) times higher than the legacy symbol rate, to produce
High Symbol Rate schemes (HSR). To meet peak throughput objectives, e.g. 32QAM
modulation is then needed.
The BTS receiver needs to cope with wider transmission bandwidth and could
beneficially utilise the gain of interference rejection combining (IRC) for
reception of dual symbol rate. The receiver complexity for DSR is about up to
50 % more complex per bit than for 8PSK. The dual symbol rate applies to
normal GSM frequency planning for all re-uses up to 1/1. Evolution in uplink
bit rates is needed to support uploading of images or video from camera phones
and also to maintain a balance in bit rates and in coverage with downlink
enhancements e.g. with dual carrier.
### 9.1.1 Technology outline
The transmitter power of Mobile Station is limited e.g. by multi slot power
reduction, thus more effective method than adding uplink timeslots or carriers
(7.) is needed to improve uplink throughput. Interference Rejection Combining
diversity algorithm is widely used in EDGE BSS and it has potentially some
unused gain e.g. IRC could cope with higher amount of uplink interference.
### 9.1.2 Service outline
The EGPRS uplink bit rate evolution is needed to support e.g. imaging feature
evolution in EGPRS mobile phones. Camera phones have couple of Mpixel
resolution, high quality optics and integrated flash producing decent pictures
for family use. In consequence camera phones are replacing point-and-shoot
cameras - the biggest segment in the digital photography.
Although mobiles may have high capacity memory cards or even integrated hard
disc drive, it would be likely irresistible not to send taken pictures or
videos immediately to friends or family by email, post them to a web blog or a
photo printing service with EGPRS phone in hand. As a bonus those camera
phones would increase also downlink data traffic by peoples reading emails or
visiting in blocks. So each camera phone owner would be a significant mobile
content creator in terms of Mbytes and freshness of the created information.
Dual Symbol Rate EGPRS could approximately halve image upload times, or
provide almost double bit rates or better uplink coverage for real time video
sharing with DTM.
## 9.2 Concept description
The dual symbol rate and modified dual symbol rate double up link bit rates
with minimal impact to mobile stations. The transmission bandwidth is widened
and needs appropriate receiver in BTS. According to simulations both spectral
efficiency and coverage can be enhanced significantly. With widened signal
bandwidth it\'s possible to utilise properties of interference rejection
combining diversity receiver for both DSR/MDSR reception and also to provide
additional robustness against wideband interference to normal 8PSK and GMSK
reception.
DSR or MDSR are likely not applicable in downlink until penetration of
diversity MS\'s employing IRC is high enough to cope with widened bandwidth as
base stations do in uplink.
A communication link equipped with multiple transmit and receive antennas
(\~MIMO, Multiple Input Multiple Output) can achieve higher link data rates.
DSR can be seen as a \"Multi User\"-MIMO system, where multiple users, with
single transmitter antenna for each, share the same uplink band width with
simultaneous signals received by BTSs equipped with diversity antennas to
achieve better spectral efficiency, as illustrated in figure 236.
{width="2.4895833333333335in" height="1.7916666666666667in"}
Figure 236:DSR is as a distributed MIMO scheme
### 9.2.1 Comparison with MIMO
A MIMO receiver needs at least as many Rx antennas as there are data streams
occupying the same timeslot and channel. With DSR, spatial multiplexing is
proposed without ensuring that this MIMO requirement is fulfilled. A BTS has
typically 2 Rx antennas, but there may be more than two data streams in a
given timeslot and channel. For instance see 101.
Moreover, the weighting coefficients of the two Rx antennas can only be set
either for spatial filtering or for maximum ratio combining (MRC), but not for
both at the same time. Hence, if the two Rx antennas are used for spatial
filtering to separate a conventional GSM signal and a DSR signal which
occupies the same channel, the two Rx antennas can no more be used to improve
the SNR by MRC.
Since in MIMO the TX antennas are located on the same terminal, only the
throughput of that single terminal suffers if spatial multiplexing fails (e.g.
because of insufficient rank of the channel matrix), whereas with this
proposal, since the two transmit antennas are on different terminals, a DSR
user can jam the uplink of another MS\'s voice call (for more on voice impact
see subclause 9.5.11.2).
### 9.2.2 Modulation
The Dual Symbol Rate could apply the existing 8PSK parameters excluding symbol
rate and shaping filter. The Modified Dual Symbol Rate uses 16QAM modulation
at 3/2 times higher symbol rate compared to GSM. QPSK is considered optionally
for coverage extension. MDSR modulator could produce 100 kHz frequency offset
to locate the MDSR carrier effectively in the middle of two GSM channels. The
following table compares modulation parameters of 8PSK, DSR and MDSR. The
signal bandwidths of DSR and MDSR are compared with three and two 8PSK
carriers respectively in figures **237** and **238**.

### 9.2.3 Multiplexing
#### 9.2.3.1 Burst format
In DSR burst one 8PSK modulated symbol corresponds to three Gray mapped bits
as defined in 3GPP 45.004, subclause 3.2 Symbol mapping. In MDSR burst, one
16QAM modulated symbol corresponds to four Gray mapped bits, thus with 3/2
symbol rate MDSR burst carries double amount of bits (as in DSR) compared
normal 8PSK. A particular bits within a timeslot are referenced by a Bit
Number (BN), with the first bit being numbered 0, and the last (1/2) bit being
numbered 937. The bits are mapped to symbols in ascending order according to
3GPP TS 45.004.The normal burst format has an equal structure in time with
existing GMSK and 8PSK modulated normal bursts excluding 0.5 symbol periods
longer tails for MDSR as shown in table 97. For optional QPSK the number of
bits is the same as in EGPRS.

The training sequence bits should be defined so that amplitude variations are
minimized similar to 8PSK training sequences. Furthermore, the training
sequence design should consider both autocorrelation and cross-correlations
properties to achieve good channel estimation performance in high noise and
interfering conditions. An example set of new sequences, based on exhaustive
search, are proposed for DSR in table 98. The training sequence bits and tail
bits for MDSR are FFS.

The tails (6 symbols each) are defined as modulating bits same as for 8PSK
with the following states:
(BN0, BN1 .. BN17) = (1,1,1; 1,1,1; 1,1,1; 1,1,1; 1,1,1; 1,1,1)
(BN870, BN871 .. BN887) = (1,1,1; 1,1,1; 1,1,1; 1,1,1; 1,1,1; 1,1,1)
#### 9.2.3.2 Blind symbol rate and modulation detection
A BSS needs to detect which symbol rate and modulation were used in the
received burst. Detection may be enabled by orthogonal training sequences as
in blind modulation detection between 8PSK and GMSK modulations as illustrated
fin figure 239.
{width="4.325694444444444in" height="1.9743055555555555in"}
Figure 239: Illustration of blind symbol rate and modulation detection for
received burst
Next, a simple procedure to perform channel estimation for each modulation and
symbol rate option is presented shortly.
The received signal is presented by linear model **y** =**Xh** +**n**.
Narrowband channel filtering and rotation can be presented by multiplications
of matrices **G** and **R** , respectively. Thus LS estimator for each channel
can be expressed in form of: **h** = **Py** , where **P** = (**X** ^H^**G**
^H^**GX**)^-1^**X** ^H^**G** ^H^**R** ^H^ and is pre-calculated for each
modulation and training sequence.
Thus further narrow band channel filtering, and also symbol rotation can be
incorporated to the channel estimator. For MDSR the frequency offset could
also be included.
Performance of blind detection is FFS.
In MDSR, the signal has a different symbol rate (1.5 times normal EDGE) and
higher order modulation is also proposed. This has the following implications:
  * The maximum output power is lower by 2 dB because of higher > peak-to-average ratio (PAR).
  * The energy per bit is lower by 1.8 dB because of shorter symbol > period.
  * The energy per bit is a further 1.2 dB lower because of higher > number of bits per symbol.
The above implies that there is a total reduction of approximately 5 dB in
terms of energy per bit and this has significant impact on the cell edge
performance. Thus QPSK as an alternative modulation scheme is seen as
mandatory for the concept to work with reasonable cell edge throughput.
However, this would complicate the blind detection process for the MDSR and
also traditional EGPRS MCS because of the choice between 4 different
modulation formats: GMSK, 8‑PSK, 16-QAM and QPSK, the latter two modulation
formats being at 1.5 times the symbol rate and at 100 kHz offset from the
center frequency of the former two modulation formats. One solution would be
to define MCS selection rules in RLC retransmission, so that only one linear
modulation in addition to GMSK is possible to send by MS assuming that the
same set of MCS families are applied for each modulation. Thus number of
modulations on blind detection is not increased compared to EGPRS. The
performance of blind modulation detection especially at low C/I and low input
level where EGPRS starts working (e.g. where MCS-1 has a BLER of 50 %) should
be investigated to see the impact of such a new proposal on the uplink.
A BSS needs to detect which symbol rate and modulation was used in the
received burst. It is possible, as is shown in table 99, to limit detection
within two modulation alternatives as it is a case in EGPRS today. Thus number
of modulations can be increased without increasing the complexity of blind
modulation and symbol rate detection.

#### 9.2.3.3 Multi slot classes
Current 8PSK multi slot classes or DTM multi slot classes should apply for DSR
and MDSR.
### 9.2.4 Channel coding
The channel coding of dual symbol rate should be carried out in a similar way
as with existing 8PSK modulated coding schemes of EGPRS (MCS5-5 to 9), so that
incremental redundancy (IR) can be supported between 8PSK and DSR or MDSR
blocks.
Table 100 illustrates possible new modulation and coding schemes. The coding
rate could be a bit lower than for relative 8PSK MCSs depending on the coding
of header. The interleaving of RLC blocs could be optimised according to
coding rate similarly as in EGPRS. Optional QPSK schemes are similar to
existing EGPRS schemes except to the modulation and symbol rate.
Table 100: DSR and MDSR modulation and coding schemes

### 9.2.5 RLC/MAC
The RLC/MAC header need to carry information of 4 RLC blocks thus new header
type is needed, but the EGPRS uplink RLC/MAC header type-1 could be re-used
for 2 lowest DSR MCSs, without adding new bytes. Three highest DSR MCSs
carrying 4 blocks would need the following additions to the EGPRS uplink
RLC/MAC header type-1:
  * 2 octets to indicate block sequence numbers (BSN3, BSN4).
  * 5 bits to enhance Coding and Puncturing Scheme indicator field > (CPS).
Detection of the new header type is FFS.
In downlink, _EGPRS MCS IE_ needs to be enhanced by 1 bit to carry also DSR
MCSes.
The DSR do not need changes to the existing RLC/MAC procedures and for example
current uplink allocation methods e.g. dynamic allocation through USF and RRBP
mechanisms should apply for DSR.
Current maximum RLC Window size for EGPRS (1024) should apply for DSR as well
as for dual carrier (subclause 7.5.2.4).
The EGPRS link adaptation may be enhanced for DSR by adding new rules to for
MCS selection for retransmission with and without re-segmentation enabling
incremental redundancy and ensuring optimal performance.
The same RLC/MAC changes required for DSR applies also for MDSR, but impact of
optional QPSK is FFS.
### 9.2.6 RRC
Introduction of new Radio Access Capability is needed.
### 9.2.7 Radio transmission and reception
It could be assumed that Dual Symbol Rate has quite similar properties as 8PSK
and the same approach as used for specifying properties 8PSK could be applied,
but some considerations are needed due to wider spectrum.
It is assumed that BTS uses IRC diversity allowing interferes to overlap from
adjacent carriers. BTS performance for DSR should likely be specified with
diversity, since that is typical BTS configuration. For performance evaluation
and requirements the network interference scenario needs to be defined e.g.
similar to DARP, but considering wider and thus overlapping bandwidth of DSR,
IRC capability, uplink interference statistical distribution rather than just
average and mixed voice and data traffic model.
#### 9.2.7.1 Transmitter output power and power classes
No changes expected for DSR and existing E-power classes could be applied due
to similar linearity requirements with 8PSK.
#### 9.2.7.2 Modulation accuracy
Current EVM figures should likely apply for DSR with a note of different
symbol rate and shaping filter. EVM for MDSR is FFS.
#### 9.2.7.3 Power vs. time
No major changes are expected for DSR, since PAR is similar with current 8PSK
and burst structure is specified according to the current 8PSK modulated
normal burst. Due to the shaping filtering the lower limit during random data
symbols may need to be removed due to possible zero crossings. PVT for MDSR is
FFS.
#### 9.2.7.4 Spectrum due to modulation
Spectrum due to modulation mask needs to be changed to apply for dual symbol
rate. As an initial starting point the current spectrum mask for 8PSK could
shifted by 200 kHz for DSR and 100 kHz for MDSR and relative amplitude
normalized to correspond the same absolute power with 8PSK.
#### 9.2.7.5 Spectrum due to transients
Spectrum due to transients needs to reflect changes in spectrum due to
modulation.
#### 9.2.7.6 Receiver blocking characteristics
Channel filtering of BTS transceiver is assumed to meet existing blocking
characteristics for GMSK despite being wide enough to pass through DSR or MDSR
signal.
#### 9.2.7.7 AM suppression characteristics
No changes expected.
#### 9.2.7.8 Inter-modulation characteristics
No changes expected.
#### 9.2.7.9 Nominal Error Rates (NER)
Similar limits as for 8PSK could be applied.
#### 9.2.7.10 Reference sensitivity level
Adding diversity cases need to be considered.
#### 9.2.7.11 Reference interference level
Adding diversity cases need to be considered.
## 9.3 Modelling assumptions and requirements
### 9.3.1 MS transmitter modelling
Ideal transmitter was used in coverage and interference scenarios, but power
amplifier model based on the GaAs HBT technology was used in spectrum due to
modulation and adjacent channel power evaluations.
### 9.3.2 BTS receiver modelling
Uplink Interference Rejection Combining diversity (IRC) was used in
simulations and some reference simulations were also performed with Maximum
Ratio Combining (MRC) or without diversity. The effective noise figure was 5
dB, antenna branches were uncorrelated and no other impairments were included
to receiver simulations, if not otherwise stated.
### 9.3.3 Simulation approach for interference modelling
As seen in figure 237 DSR spectrum overlaps over three normal 200 kHz carriers
resulting in about 3 to 5 times more stringent interference situation for the
BTS receiver. Thus conventional single interferer models (like CCI, ACI) or
even the multi-interferer method used in SAIC cannot be used for DSR
performance evaluations.
The interference modelling used burst-wise data recorded from dynamic system
simulator in link simulator to simulate multiple interferers. This approach
combines benefits of both simulation environments, providing accurate
evaluation of IRC algorithm to cope with multiple interferers having variable
bandwidth and modulation. The number of simultaneous interferers varied
dynamically burst by burst up to more than 20 as depicted in a spectral
snapshot in figure 101.
Network level results e.g. spectral efficiency was obtained by combining link
results with wanted signal level statistics.
Burst-wise interference data from dynamic system simulator included MS Id,
signal level and modulation information for co-channel, 1^st^ and 2^nd^
adjacent channel interferers, that enable to produce system level interference
environment in link simulator using similar structure as in 6.3. The signal
level information was averaged in system simulator so that fast fading was
simulated only once in link simulator for both wanted and all interfering
signals. DSR simulations were performed by changing 8PSK modulated bursts to
be DSR-8PSK modulated.
Link adaptation was not dynamic, but MCS giving the best average throughput
was selected for each signal level in link simulator. It is assumed to have
better results with dynamic link adaptation.
The impact of dual symbol rate signal to TCH/AFS5.9 was simulated in link
simulator.

## **9.4** System level model
### 9.4.1 Network model and system scenarios
4 different system scenarios were used to collect burst-wise interference data
and wanted signal statistics. Network configurations and simulation parameters
are listed in the tables 101 and 102. Frequency re-use 4/12 was studied for
BCCH, and reuses 1/1 (1/3 load), 1/3 and 3/9 for hopping layer. It should be
noted that frequency re-use is determined for normal 200 kHz carrier and with
overlapping DSR carrier it is effectively 2 times higher e.g. at re-use 1/1
case the effective re-use for DSR is about 2/1. Network load was about 75 % in
all cases. In BCCH case it was assumed that all traffic is EGPRS data, whereas
in TCH cases there were 4 TCH TRXs in each cell serving 19.2 voice Erlangs and
about 210 kb/s for EGPRS traffic in average, yielding to 17 % to 25 % share of
slots for data. Voice load alone introduced 20 % effective frequency load
(EFL) for frequency re-uses 1/1 and 1/3.
Amount of recorded bursts was large enough to achieve statistically reliable
results for evaluating relative DSR gain over EDGE, because exactly the same
interference statistics was used within each data scenario. On the other hand
accuracy is likely not sufficient with used files to make accurate absolute
performance evaluations with other than 1/1 or 1/3 re-uses.
Site-to-site distance was 3 000 meters in interference scenarios and 12 000
meters in the coverage scenario. The propagation environment was typical urban
at 3 km/h. DTX and power control algorithms were enabled for voice and EGPRS.
FTP traffic model with 120 kB file size was used for EGPRS and the same amount
of traffic was assumed in UL and DL, causing sufficient uplink load. This FTP
model corresponds to about 200 kB to 230 kB file size with DSR.

## 9.5 Performance characterization
### 9.5.1 Spectrum due to modulation
Figure **246** shows simulated example of spectrum due to modulation with GaAs
HBT PA model biased near to class-B resulting 35 % power added efficiency
(PAE) for DSR. For comparison the spectrum due to modulation for 8PSK would
kiss the existing limit line at 400 kHz offset with the same PA as depicted in

The existing 8PSK spectrum mask was shifted by 200 kHz for DSR and is plotted
as a reference to demonstrate the impact of DSR. The carrier power of DSR is
corrected by 3dB to match with the same absolute power with 8PSK measured
through the 30kHz filter.
This spectrum due to modulation is further analysed in subclause 9.5.2.

### 9.5.2 Adjacent channel power
The adjacent channel power due to DSR transmission was evaluated by using GaAs
HBT PA model biased near to class-B yielding to 35 % power added efficiency.
Simulated spectrum is shown in figure **246**.
#### 9.5.2.1 Adjacent channel power to GSM/EDGE uplink
Adjacent Channel Power (ACP) for different offsets was estimated through 180
kHz rectangular filter compared to the total transmitted signal power. The
adjacent channel power limits were derived from the reference interference
level limits for 3 lowest offsets and from spectrum due to modulation mask for
higher offsets. Indeed existing limits are shifted by 200 kHz.
Results are in table **248**. Adjacent channel power due to DSR seems to
comply with existing ACP limits excluding 800 kHz offset, where limit was
exceeded by 2 dB and could likely be improved e.g. by compromising in power
added efficiency. The system impact of this 2 dB exception at level of -56 dB
would be likely negligible.

The used guard band used between operators depends on regulatory requirements
and possible agreements and typically does not exist or is single 200 kHz
channel. Thus existing ACP between operators varies and is typically 18 dB or
50 dB. Similar ACP values for DSR can be obtained by 200 kHz or 400 kHz guard
band.
To ensure 50 dB ACP, it is possible to use DSR at BCCH layer allocated in the
middle of operator\'s frequency band, so that use of edge channels can be
avoided. Or it is also possible to use restricted MA list for DSR/EGPRS
avoiding edge channels of operator\'s frequency allocation, which still can be
used for voice. Thus DSR can be used with existing guard band and without
segregation in EGPRS, but may need some support from BSS resource allocation.
#### 9.5.2.2 Adjacent channel power to WCDMA uplink
Adjacent channel power (ACP) was estimated through 3840 kHz rectangular filter
compared to the total transmitted signal power. The impact to adjacent WCDMA
uplink was estimated by determining ACP at 2.7 MHz offset and comparing it to
allowed ACP of WCDMA transmitter at 5MHz offset.
As a result modelled PA has 19 dB margin on ACP introduced to adjacent WCDMA.
So, dual symbol rate can be applied with current 200 kHz guard band adjacent
to WCDMA.

#### 9.5.2.3 Spectrum mask and spurious emissions
At first glance, the spectrum of MDSR looks as wide as the spectrum of two
adjacent GMSK modulated carriers. However, the adjacent channel performance is
worse.
##### 9.5.2.3.1 Adjacent channel protection
Today, the attenuation of the first adjacent channel interferer (±200 kHz)
through reference, 180 kHz wide RX filter amounts to 18 dB. However, for MDSR,
the attenuation in -200 kHz/+400 kHz offset would be only 16 dB as shown in
table 117. 2 dB lower adjacent channel protection correspond to almost 60 %
more power leaking into the adjacent channels.
##### 9.5.2.3.2 Spectrum after PA and spectrum mask
The simulated spectrum after a PA model and the comparison with a spectrum
mask, shifted by 100 kHz as shown in figure 247, shows that the mask is
violated at 300 kHz and continuously between 500 kHz and 1 000 kHz carrier
offset despite a 2 dB higher output power back-off than for 8-PSK. It can be
concluded that:
  * either the additional back-off of 2 dB is still too low; or
  * a more linear and hence less efficient PA would be needed; or
  * the constellation diagram needs to be optimized with respect to the > peak-to-average and peak-to-minimum ratio; or
  * more spectrum relaxation than just a horizontal shift of the mask > will be needed, leading to more adjacent channel interference.
Furthermore, the wide band noise emissions of an MDSR Tx chain need to be
investigated too, in particular the noise in the downlink band.
### 9.5.3 Coverage
The DSR and MDSR coverage was modelled with the following assumptions,
resulting to level of -108 dBm at cell border (95 %).
+---------------------------------------------+-----------------------+ | Noise floor of BTS with NF=5dB - see note) | -115 dBm | +---------------------------------------------+-----------------------+ | Required Eb/No for EFR (FER \ voice users in TCH carriers eliminates possible impact to voice > users and provides 1.8 times higher spectral efficiency of BCCH UL > as shown in scenario 1 in subclause 9.5.5.

  * DSR power control e.g. lowering DSR power by 2 dB may ensure no > impacts to voice quality or signalling performance.
The impact of DSR signal for voice users was studied by comparing FER of
TCH/AFS5.9 with 8PSK and DSR interferes at interference scenario 4 (1/1 re-
use). UL FER was also compared with DL SAIC FER to ensure that the assumption
to have room for DSR interference is valid. Comparison has been made at 95 %
signal level for both UL and DL as shown in figure 110\. Note that the load
was 430 kbit/s in uplink with DSR, 220 kbit/s in downlink and voice load 19.2
Erl.
The following findings can be listed at cell border:
  * With similar UL cell throughput as in DL, DSR has similar impact to > voice than EDGE.
  * With 1.7 higher UL cell throughput DSR has 0.7 dB smaller impact to > voice than EDGE.

* * *
### 9.5.8 Impact to voice users C/I distribution with 1/3 re-use
The wider frequency spectrum of DSR will spread interference over a larger
frequency range an increased interference on neighbouring channels. This is
shown in figure **246** and table 111. The interference in the adjacent
channel is just about 1 dB less than in the centre channel.
Table 111: Power distribution over 3 channels (1^st^ lower adjacent channel,
co-channel\ and 1^st^ upper adjacent channel) measured with 180 kHz
rectangular filter

**Frequency offset [kHz]** **-290 to -110** **-90 to 90** **110 to 290**
Energy distribution DSR [dB] -5.05 -3.91 -5.05
* * *
While this will not increase the total amount of emitted interference in the
system (assuming that a DSR terminal uses the same transmit power as an EGPRS
terminal), the interference will be distributed differently for DSR than for
EGPRS. Since network frequency planning is optimised for regular 200 kHz
GSM/EDGE carriers, the received interference levels may despite this be
different in the two cases.
#### 9.5.8.1 Simulation results for uplink
In order to investigate this effect, system simulations have been run. A mixed
traffic scenario with 80 % speech traffic and 20 % data traffic was
considered. The simulation parameters are summarised in table 112.
**Table** **112: Summary of system simulation parameters**
+-------------------+----------------------+ | Parameter | Value | +-------------------+----------------------+ | Reuse | 1/3 | +-------------------+----------------------+ | Traffic mix | 80% speech, 20% data | | | | | | data is EGPRS | | | | | | data is DSR | +-------------------+----------------------+ | Power control | Yes (for speech) | +-------------------+----------------------+ | DTX | Yes (for speech) | +-------------------+----------------------+ | Frequency load | 10% and 20% | +-------------------+----------------------+ | Receive diversity | IRC | +-------------------+----------------------+
The impact on uplink carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) is shown in figure
257. The C/I for the speech users is 1 dB to 2 dB lower in the DSR case with
1.7x higher throughput than in the EGPRS case.
{width="3.9833333333333334in" height="2.990972222222222in"}
Figure 257: Uplink C/I distributions (left y-axis)\ Also, the C/I difference
is shown for the two cases (right y-axis)
The difference is caused by a blurred reuse in the DSR case. In an ordinary
1/3-reuse (as well as in a 1-reuse with MAIO planning), only adjacent channel
interferers appear in the closest surrounding cells. If these are EDGE
interferers, most of their energy will be in the adjacent channel and the
receiver filter in the BTS will suppress it. In the DSR case however, the
adjacent channel interferer will have a large part of its energy in the
desired band (of the speech user) and the receiver filter in the BTS will not
suppress it.
### 9.5.9 Uplink/downlink balance
It is earlier assumed that a degradation of uplink speech performance is not a
problem, since the downlink performance is anyway limiting the overall
performance. While this may be true in some scenarios, it is not always the
case.
For instance, shadowing from buildings and other obstacles will impact the
uplink-downlink balance. The effect of shadow fading is that the received
signal strength will vary with the position of the receiver, the transmitters
of the desired signal and interferers, and obstacles such as buildings. While
the desired signal will be impacted equally in uplink and downlink by shadow
fading, the interferers will not, since they do not originate from the same
source (uplink interference from terminals, downlink interference from base
stations).
One particular, but very relevant, example of this is indoor coverage, as
illustrated in figure 259. The speech user is located in a building and
connected to a macro-cell outside the building. Other interfering users are
located elsewhere, outside the building. The building will attenuate the
desired signal (uplink and downlink) by, say, 10 dB. The downlink interference
coming from other base stations outside the building will be attenuated by the
same amount. Therefore, the downlink C/I will not be impacted by the building.
The uplink interference, on the other hand, coming from terminals outside the
building, will not be attenuated. Therefore, the uplink C/I will be reduced by
10 dB. The consequence is that the indoor speech performance may be limited by
the uplink, not the downlink.
{width="3.8465277777777778in" height="3.107638888888889in"}
Figure 258: Indoor/outdoor interference scenario
To conclude, the increased interference levels due to DSR interference may
degrade speech performance in some scenarios and areas, in particular indoors.
On the other hand IRC can effectively reject the most dominant interferer,
thus impact may be negligible in typical scenarios where most of users are in
indoor locations e.g. 80 % (FFS).
### 9.5.10 Real Time service coverage
The coverage for real time data service was evaluated by using RLC un-ACK mode
and next MCS exceeding 64 kbps with 2 uplink slots for both the EDGE and DSR
resulting to 89.6 kbit/s. At 0.1 % target BLER the DSR gain was about 6.4 dB.
It could be possible to develop optimised DSR coding schemes for real time.

### 9.5.11 DSR and Speech Performance in Legacy MRC Network
Dual Symbol Rate performance in mixed voice and data interference scenario,
with Interference Rejection Combining (IRC) in all the BTS receivers show 1.7
to 1.9 fold data capacity gain in uplink. In this subclause DSR performance is
evaluated assuming legacy Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) receivers for voice
time slots in uplink and data time slots use IRC. So results would reflect the
initial deployment case of DSR to the legacy GSM network.
In the presented simulations, the DSR transmitter power was adjusted by
dynamic system simulator so that the same UL speech performance was achieved
in both EGPRS and DSR cases i.e. DSR impact to voice was cleared out by DSR
power control. Burst level information from system level simulator was
collected separately for EGPRS and DSR, making simulation results more
reliable.
#### 9.5.11.1 DSR interference model for system simulation
Used dynamic system simulator calculates total received interference (for C/I
definition) as a sum of co- and first adjacent channel interference levels
through a reference, 180 kHz wide, RX filter, which provides 18 dB adjacent
channel attenuation for EGPRS and GMSK interferers.
In the case of DSR interferer co-channel attenuation was 4.7 dB and adjacent
channel attenuation 5.7 dB related to total DSR signal power. Impact of the
second adjacent interferer (21.3 dB) was found to be negligible for the voice
performance. The attenuation values of RX filter are also shown in table 113.
Table 113: Attenuation due to a reference RX channel filtering for EGPRS and
DSR
+----------+--------------------------------------+--------+ | Channel | Attenuation due to channel filtering | | | | | | | Offset | | | +----------+--------------------------------------+--------+ | | EGPRS | DSR | +----------+--------------------------------------+--------+ | 0 kHz | 0 | 4.7 dB | +----------+--------------------------------------+--------+ | ±200 kHz | 18 dB | 5.7 dB | +----------+--------------------------------------+--------+
#### 9.5.11.2 UL speech performance in legacy MRC network
Dynamic system simulations were run with the frequency reuse of 1/3, which is
basically the same as the DSR scenario 2.
At first, the reference EGPRS simulation was run (20 % EGPRS FTP data and 80 %
AMR 5.9 kbit/s voice). Speech service quality was evaluated with the following
criteria:
  * Relative number of bad quality connections (connection average > FER > 1 %).
  * Relative number of bad quality samples (FER > 4 % measured for 2 > seconds samples).
  * Network level total average FER.
  * Network level average UL TX power.
DSR simulation was first run with the exactly same power control parameters as
used for EGPRS and with 2 dB and 4 dB lower power. Figure 260 presents network
speech quality in terms of bad quality connections for different simulations.
It is seen that without DSR power reduction the number of bad quality speech
connections is slightly increased compared to reference EGPRS simulation.
However, already 2 dB power reduction was enough to maintain speech
performance at the reference level.
Table 114 presents required DSR power reduction values for all the examined
speech quality criteria. It is seen that 2 dB power reduction was enough for
all used criteria. Therefore, 2 dB power reduction was selected for the DSR
data capacity evaluation. Required 2 dB power reduction is also in line with
the C/I results presented in subclause 9.5.8.1, where it was found out that
network C/I distribution increased about 1 dB to 2 dB due to DSR.

#### 9.5.11.3 DSR performance in legacy MRC network
EGPRS and DSR data throughputs were studied with link level simulations based
on recorded bursts resulting similar voice performance i.e. DSR TX power was
limited by 2 dB. Median interference level and variance for 3 strongest
co‑channel interference levels and 2 strongest adjacent-channel interference
levels are shown in tables 115 and 116. DSR TX power reduction is clearly seen
in data interference levels. Strongest co-channel DSR interference is about
2.3 dB lower compared to strongest EGPRS interference. The difference between
voice and data statistics is mainly due to quality based power control applied
for voice.

Throughput versus received signal level is depicted in figure 261. 95 % signal
level at the cell border is -88 dBm for EGPRS and -90 dBm for DSR. The DSR,
with 2dB lower power, achieves 29 % better throughout at the capacity limited
cell border than EGPRS (34 kbit/s for EGPRS and 44 kbit/s for DSR). It is
expected that by more intelligent power control than just fixed 2 dB offset,
the throughput gain at cell border could be in order of 50 %.
The cell level throughput values for EGPRS and DSR is presented in figure 263.
DSR achieves 1.7 x higher data capacity compared to EGPRS.

### 9.5.12 Impacts to the signalling
As shown in subclause 9.5.11, the DSR power control can be used to remove
voice impacts due to DSR, thus it\'s expected that the same would apply also
for signalling.
### 9.5.13 MDSR performance at interference scenario 2
#### 9.5.13.1 Modelling assumptions and requirements
The modelling assumptions were the same as for DSR, excluding the following:
  * MS use 2dB lower maximum power for 16QAM.
  * Spectral properties, e.g. adjacent channel power levels of MDSR, > were taken into account.
#### 9.5.13.2 System level model
The system model and simulation approaches were the same as for DSR in purpose
of compare MDSR to DSR. Only 1/3 re-use (the scenario 2) was studied assuming
MRC for voice as in chapter 9.5.11. Power control was applied for MDSR so that
voice performance is not reduced but rather improved related to EGPRS.
Two different MDSR loads were simulated:
  * The same amount of timeslots as in EGPRS, to study cell capacity.
  * The same cell throughput as in EGPRS, to study data rates at cell > border.
Used dynamic system simulator calculates total received interference (for C/I
definition) as a sum of co- and first adjacent channel interference levels
through reference, 180 kHz wide RX filter. The attenuation values of RX filter
for MDSR and EGPRS are shown in table 117.

and MDSR

#### 9.5.13.3 Performance at mixed voice and data interference scenario 2
Throughputs versus signal level at interference limited scenario are shown in
figure 263. The following MDSR power control scheme was used to maintain the
same or better voice quality than with EGPRS:
  * Maximum MDSR power was 2 dB lower than EGPRS or DSR due to increased > PAR.
  * 4 dB power reduction related to EGPRS UL power control was applied > at uplink levels higher than 86 dBm.
Due to difference in power control the cell edge and average levels are not
the same for EGPRS, DSR and MDSR as shown in table 118. The MDSR performance
with MRC instead of IRC was also simulated to demonstrate the role of IRC in
MDSR performance.

As conclusion MDSR provided 1.6 times higher average cell throughput i.e.
spectral efficiency with 1/3 re-use in interference limited scenario. At cell
border the throughput gain was 67 %.
MDSR with MRC receiver has also reasonable performance against interference
providing 20 % gain over EGPRS with IRC receiver. Thus IRC is not mandatory to
obtain capacity gains by MDSR.
##### 9.5.13.3.1 Impact of antenna correlation
The impact of receiver antenna correlation to MDSR throughput was studied by
repeating scenario 2 by assuming RX antenna correlation of 0.7. This inclusion
of interference distribution from system simulator instead of link level
analysis should give realistic outcome. The results are plotted in figure 264.
{width="4.514583333333333in" height="3.29375in"}

#### 9.5.13.4 Network performance at data only interference scenarios
MDSR network level performance was studied with dynamic system simulations.
Wide MDSR carriers were modelled in the simulator e.g. carriers were shifted
+100 kHz so that MDSR signal was overlapping with two basic 200 kHz carriers.
Presented simulation results are uplink results assuming 2-antenna diversity.
MRC and IRC diversity receiver models were included in the simulations.
Simulator uses well-known two phase link-to-system mapping method. At first,
C/I of burst is mapped to a burst Bit Error Probability (BEP) and after that a
Block Error Probability (BLEP) is estimated based on mean and standard
deviation of the burst BEP values during the radio block period.
For the diversity simulations the mapping method was extended to include
wanted and interfering signals for two antennas, and, furthermore, strongest
interference levels were needed one by one for the IRC modelling. Verification
simulations showed that the used modelling achieved high accuracy for all
diversity cases. In figure 119 an example verification result is shown for
MDSR IRC case. It can be seen that difference between the IRC model and actual
link level simulation is less than 0.5 dB for the BLER values higher than 1.0
%.

studied with IRC only.
The network capacity gains were measured versus average session bit rate for

respective scenarios 5, 6, and 7 are shown in table 119. Scenario 5 is BCCH
layer simulation with one non hopping TRX and scenarios 6 and 7 are hopping

Figure 268 depicts reuse 4/12 simulation results. 10th percentile of
connection bit rates are shown for EGPRS with MRC, EGPRS with IRC and MDSR
versus offered FTP load. Then, MDSR capacity gains are compared to EGPRS with
MRC and IRC are shown for different 10^th^ percentile session bit rate
requirements. Network capacity gain is 200 % to 270 % for 100 kbps requirement
and 340 % to 550 % for the 144 kbps connection average bit rate requirement.
The simulation was an example BCCH layer data traffic capacity simulation.
BCCH layer was more radio resource than spectrum limited for both EGPRS and
MDSR in this example simulation. It can be seen, for example, that worst
10^th^ percentile of the connections achieved as high as 220 kbps average bit
rate in case of MDSR whereas only 50 kbps was obtained in case of EGPRS at the
same traffic load.

In case of re-use 1/3 capacity gain at 100 kbps session bit rate is 120 % to

the 144 kbps bit rate requirement gains are 180 % to 420 % and 140 % to 340 %,
respectively. Reuse 1/3 was found to be spectrum limited and therefore 2-TRX
implementation achieved nearly the same network performance than with 1-TRX
MDSR implementation.

#### 9.5.13.5 Performance of two transceiver implementation
This paragraph presents a dual TRX performance at DTS-2 scenario with
impairments.
Two conventional receivers e.g. like used in the first generation GSM BTS over
decade ago were assumed. Both receivers have independent impairments as listed
in table 120. The used channel filter has 200 kHz bandwidth and in addition to
that a random phase offset between receivers was generated for every burst.

Impairment Value I/Q gain imbalance 0.125 dB I/Q phase mismatch 1° DC offset

* * *
The DTS-2 link level interference scenario, illustrated in figure 269 and
table 121, was used for both EGPRS and MDSR. In the case of MDSR, the
frequency of adjacent-1 interference was chosen so that, it became as 3rd co-
channel interference for MDSR with +3dB power level. Thus, it was not
attenuated by channel filter providing adjacent channel protection like in the
case of EGPRS. The used noise bandwidth was 271 kHz in both cases, i.e. it is
-15.2 dB for 405 kHz bandwidth. Despite of these hardenings, interference
levels in simulations referred to the level of co-channel-1 for both EGPRS and
MDSR.

#### 9.5.13.6 Voice and higher symbol rate in asynchronous interference
scenario
This subclause presents some results for voice performance with asynchronous
MDSR interference that has no 100 kHz offset. Offset was removed since two TRX
implementation option found to have low interest. In addition IRC performance
at low SNR conditions is also evaluated.
Simulations shown, 1.5 times higher symbol rate has lower voice impact than
EGPRS with legacy MRC receiver.
##### 9.5.13.6.1 Simulation assumptions
General modelling assumptions were:
  * MRC and IRC receivers were used for AMR 5.9.
  * Asynchronous and synchronous DTS-2 scenarios were used.
  * Interfering signal were 8PSK and 16QAM with 1.5 symbol rate.
  * Low SNR simulation was modelled with noise floor at 0dB instead of > -17dB from I~1~.
  * Receiver impairments were included.

The DTS-2 link level interference scenario is illustrated in figure **272**
and table 124. Note that DTS-2 provides a link level approximation of system
interference of a typical interference limited network for speech, which was
agreed in TSG-GERAN for testing SAIC performance. The interference
distribution for mixed speech and data on the uplink may therefore be
different.
A random time offset was used for asynchronous interferers per frame. Two
consecutive bursts with independent fast fading were generated to provide the
same average interference power over the burst length as in the synchronous
case.

{#voice-performance-at-asynchronous-and-synchronous-scenario .H6}
It can be seen from DTS-2 results with MRC that higher symbol has a bit
smaller impact to voice than EGPRS interference at 1 % FER.
In asynchronous scenario MDSR interference has about similar impact to voice
as EGPRS. But with IRC and in synchronous scenario, voice performance was
degraded by 0.3 dB with MDSR interference (without 100 kHz offset) compared to
EGPRS.

### 9.5.14 High Symbol Rate (HSR) performance
Evaluated concept uses 1.2 times higher symbol rate i.e. 325 ksymbol/s and
32QAM modulation with convolution channel coding.
#### 9.5.14.1 Modelling assumptions
Legacy EGPRS receiver SAW filter with 240 kHz BW (3GPP TR 45.912, subclause
9.7.1.1.1.1) was assumed. Two different transmitter shaping pulses were used
with bandwidths of 240 kHz and 325 kHz to determine the performance impact of
shaping filter.
The receiver performance modelling assumptions were:
In the receiver simulations BTS used legacy 8PSK receiver filter, a SAW filter
model, with 240 kHz BW (subclause 9.7.1.1.1.1). Additionally receiver filter,
which bandwidth was matched with the symbol rate was used as a reference.
Asynchronous DTS-2 scenario with 1.2 times higher symbol rate interferers was
used.
Data performance was evaluated with Interference Rejection Combining (IRC)
algorithm with 2 receiver antennas.
Voice impact (AMR 5.9) was analyzed with above mentioned asynchronous DTS-2
scenario with Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) receiver.
Receiver impairments were included.

The DTS-2 link level interference scenario, illustrated in figure 275 and
table 125, was used 1.2 times higher symbol rate with different shaping pulses
and receiver filters.
A random time offset was used for asynchronous interferers per radio frame.
Two consecutive bursts with independent fast fading were generated to provide
the same average interference power over the burst period as in the
synchronous case.

##### 9.5.14.2.1 Coverage
Throughput versus received signal level is depicted in figure 276 for
1.2x32QAM with different shaping and receiver filters at TU3iFH conditions
with receiver impairments given in table 124.
Table 126 shows average throughputs and throughput gains at -98 dBm median RX
level. 1.2 x 32QAM used additional power due to higher PAR.
1.2x32QAM seems to provide up to 46 % higher average throughput than EGPRS
with 325 kHz shaping pulse. It can be also seen that 32QAM is not sufficient
and there is room for 1.2x16QAM below about 15 dB point.

##### 9.5.14.2.2 Data performance in synchronous DTS-2 interference scenario
The throughput of 1.2 x 32QAM was evaluated in Figure 277 for the following
cases:
  * 1.2x32QAM with 325 kHz shaping filter and 325 kHz receiver filter.
  * 12x32QAM with 325 kHz shaping filter and 240 kHz receiver filter.
  * 12x32QAM with 240 kHz shaping filter and 240 kHz receiver filter.
It can be seen that wider shaping filter linked with wider receive filter
outperforms other options and next best is wider shaping linked with narrow
receiver filter.

##### 9.5.14.2.3 Voice impact in asynchronous DTS-2 interference scenario
The AMR 5.9 FER was simulated with asynchronous DTS-2 scenario. Three curves
are presented:
  * AMR 5.9 FER with EGPRS interference.
  * AMR 5.9 FER with 1.2x32QAM interference with 240 kHz shaping filter.
  * AMR 5.9 FER with 1.2x32QAM interference with 325 kHz shaping filter.
{width="5.833333333333333in" height="4.375in"}
Figure 278: AMR 5.9 FER versus C/I~1~ in asynchronous DTS-2 scenario
It can be seen that EGPRS as an interference seems to cause higher impact to
AMR than 1.2 symbol rate. Indeed 240 kHz shaping filter seems to cause higher
FER than 325 kHz shaping filter.
## 9.6 Impacts to the mobile station
### 9.6.1 DSR
Dual symbol rate has small impact to terminal e.g. HW changes could be limited
to the modulator. Linearity requirements due to peak to average ratio are
similar as for 8PSK. Requirements due to peak to minimum may be higher.
Modulation spectrum mask at 800 kHz offset may need to be optimised allowing
reasonable transmitter efficiency.
Encoding complexity of DSR is 2 times higher per timeslot than for 8PSK.
Switching between DSR and voice would be about similar than between GMSK and
8PSK today. Doubling the modulation rate is likely quite straightforward e.g.
basic GSM clock 13 MHz is divided by 24 instead of 48, i.e. integer divider
can be used. Existing guard band is sufficient for switching because length of
shaping filter is not longer in time than that used for GMSK or 8PSK.
With DSR, the DAC would have to run at a higher sampling rate which would
require a wider filter after the DAC. The wider Tx filter would in turn
increase the Tx noise power [7].
NOTE: The impact of the higher Tx noise power on wide band noise and spurious
emissions needs to be investigated [7].
### 9.6.2 MDSR
MDSR has small impact to terminal e.g. HW changes could be limited to the
modulator. Generation of 100 kHz offset is considered to be done by the
modulator on burst basis thus additional synthesizer settling time is not
needed for it. Linearity requirements, e.g. due to peak to average ratio are a
bit higher than for 8PSK. Encoding complexity of MDSR is 2 times higher per
timeslot than for 8PSK, i.e. the same as for DSR.
#### 9.6.2.1 MS implementation issues
To generate the MDSR modulation in the MS, it was proposed to apply an offset
of 100 kHz in the baseband modulator. This means that the required baseband
bandwidth will double although the symbol rate is only 50 % higher. The two
different symbol rates and the doubled bandwidth may require a different,
higher DAC sampling frequency and a wider filter bandwidth of the subsequent
low-pass filters. A higher total noise power is expected. Therefore the
achievable spectrum mask as well as wideband noise and spurious emissions
should be investigated. If MDSR needs a relaxation of spectrum requirements,
the MS should have the possibility to switch between two filter bandwidth
settings, one for legacy EGPRS and one for MDSR.
Because of the higher PAR of 16-QAM, PAs with reasonable efficiency would need
a higher output power back-off than for 8-PSK. New power classes would have to
be defined. Furthermore, not only the higher PAR, but also the zero crossings
may require higher linearity, and polar loops could not be used.
## 9.7 Impacts to the BSS
### 9.7.1 Impacts to the transceiver
The BTS receiver is required to have sufficient channel bandwidth and also
should have sufficient processing power for double amount of uplink data. The
sampling rate should be at least equal to the symbol rate. So DSR is not
compatible with all legacy BTS hardware.
#### 9.7.1.1 Two transceiver implementation for DSR
The secondary BTS transceiver implementation option may be based on the use of
pair of legacy transceivers instead of one. This option utilises half band
sampling where sampling rate can be half of DSR symbol rate and channel filter
half of the BW of DSR i.e. like in EDGE. Indeed it is possible to share the
DSP processing load over 2 transceivers for both equalizing and decoding and
utilize Abis links of both transceivers. The main requirement in this option
is to have inter-transceiver communication capability, almost similar to inter
carrier interleaving, to share samples and detected soft-bits between 2
transceivers and possibility to tune receivers to offset from wanted DSR
channel frequency. The radio performance would be similar to single
transceiver option.

Figure 280: TRX reconfiguration for DSR receiv**e** r synthesis [8]
##### 9.7.1.1.1 Performance impact of two TRX implementation
Uncoded DSR performance has been evaluated by simulations. A conventional DSR
receiver is compared to a two TRX receiver. The DSR equalizer has the
following characteristics.
  * 11 channel taps.
  * Synchronization window that handles time offsets comparable to the > EDGE 8PSK equalizer.
  * DFSE equaliser with 2 MLSE taps.
##### 9.7.1.1.1.1 Impact of decreased receiver bandwidth {#impact-of-
decreased-receiver-bandwidth .H6}
With a two TRX receiver, the signal is received through two separate receiver
filters, each having a bandwidth optimised for a conventional GSM/EDGE
carrier. Since a DSR signal has a bandwidth of 540 kHz, two GSM/EDGE receiver
filters typically cannot receive the entire signal. In the simulations, the
two receivers are assumed to be separated by 200 kHz and to have a filter
bandwidth of 240 kHz each. This gives a total received bandwidth of 440 kHz.
It is assumed that the signal can be perfectly reconstructed within this
bandwidth from the two composite signals. Figure 281 shows the effect of the
decreased bandwidth. This gives a lower bound on the losses due to bandwidth
for a 2 TRX DSR receiver. The loss is at least 1 dB.
{width="5.736111111111111in" height="4.002777777777778in"}
Figure 281: Performance loss due to limited receiver bandwidth
##### 9.7.1.1.1.2 Impact of other analogue components {#impact-of-other-
analogue-components .H6}
When two receivers are used to receive one wideband signal, a tight match of
the analogue components of the two receivers is essential; otherwise the
reconstructed signal will be distorted. The analogue parts of a GSM/EDGE
receiver are designed for optimal reception of a single GSM/EDGE carrier and
the tolerances of components are chosen to meet this requirement. With two
receivers, deviations will be added, which may have an impact of the receiver
performance.
One aspect of this was investigated by simulations. It was found that a loss
of at least 2 dB (compared to a single TRX solution) can be expected due to
this, with a catastrophic behaviour if the tolerances are exceeded. Other
aspects that may further degrade performance are for further study.
NOTE: This subclause is deliberately vague to avoid revealing implementation-
specific details of the BTS architecture.
#### 9.7.1.2 Processing complexity
The complexity increase due to DSR varies depending on the type and
architecture of used receiver and performance requirements for DSR. Next is
characterised the complexity of the receiver used for DSR simulations.
{width="6.6375in" height="0.8993055555555556in"}
Table 127: Processing complexity estimation for dual symbol rate
* * *

Channel estimation \~ SR^2^ 4 x Pre-filtering \~ SR^2^ 4 x Equalizer \~ SR 2 x
De-coding \~ SR 2 x **Total** **2 - 3 x**
* * *
The channel estimate used in the simulated receiver has 11 taps i.e. about
twice as much as in EDGE causing added complexity to the channel estimation
and pre-filtering. The amount of equalizer states is the same as for EDGE
receiver, thus the equalizer complexity is doubled due to symbol rate. The
total complexity of inner receiver for DSR is about 3x higher than for EDGE.
The decoding complexity is 2 times higher per timeslot than for 8PSK due to
doubled amount of bits.
Total processing complexity of DSR is in order of 2-3 times higher than for
EDGE i.e. up to 50 % higher per bit.
##### 9.7.1.2.1 Evaluation of receiver complexity
Above it stated that the receiver complexity for DSR is about up to 50% higher
per bit under the condition that the simulated receiver has 11 taps. We think
the complexity is different for different propagation models. For TU channel
model, the maximum RMS delay is 5.0 μs, its influence to the taps number of
channel estimation is smaller than the influence which the shaping pulse
filter creates. So when the symbol rate doubles, the receiver taps number is
nearly unchanged. But the max RMS delay of HT channel model is 20.0μs which
will influence the receiver taps number more seriously than the shaping pulse
filter dose, so the simulated receiver has 11 taps, some parameters of pre-
filtering is also enlarged to make the complexity of pre-filtering about twice
as much as in ordinary 8-PSK.

For convenience, only pay attention to the BER performance. Figure 282 shows
the performance of 8-PSK with 6 taps and performance of DSR with taps equal to
6, 8 and 11 in TU50. It\'s obvious that the performance of DSR with 6 taps is
best, just like analysed above. Figure 283 shows that in HT100 using 11 taps
cause best performance, and as the number of taps decreases, the performance
decreases quickly.
To show the inapplicability of 11 taps in TU50 more clearly, the influence of
taps number using two antennas IRC/MRC is also presented, see figures 284 and
285. The performance shows that the influence of taps number is more sensitive
when two antennas IRC is used. At high CIR level, performance of 11 taps is
very bad and is almost near the performance limit, because 11 taps have
exceeded the estimated TU channel length which is about 8T, and longer taps
will introduce more noise. Table 128 will show the CIR gain(at BER=4%) using 6
taps against 11 taps at different scenarios.
Table 128: performance gain using 6 taps against 11 taps in TU50 at
interference scenarios

In summary, for TU channel model the receiver complexity for DSR is as same as
for EDGE receiver per bit, and for HT channel model the receiver complexity
for DSR is about 50% higher per bit because the complexity of channel

#### 9.7.1.3 MDSR impacts to the transceiver
In simulations a Frequency Domain MMSE equalizer was used. The channel
estimate used in the simulated receiver has 9 taps i.e. about 1.5 times as
much as in EDGE. The decoding complexity is 2 times higher per timeslot than
for 8PSK due to doubled amount of bits. Total processing complexity of MDSR is
in order of 2 times higher than for EDGE. Thus it is not increased per bit.
The MDSR may also use two transceiver implementation proposed in [1] with the
following changes:
  * No need to tune receivers out of 200 kHz raster.
  * Narrow reference channel filtering is sufficient.
Sampling rate conversion related symbol rate needs to be considered in DSP.
#### 9.7.1.4 Network implementation issues
The IRC performance which was assumed in the MDSR simulations was based on
synchronous networks. However, most networks are asynchronous. IRC performance
in asynchronous networks may be lower. Since IRC is a prerequisite for full
MDSR performance, simulations would be appreciated which prove that MDSR
provides similar gains in asynchronous networks.
Since the MDSR signal occupies two channels, IRC will have to cope with a
higher number of interferers, distributed over wider spectrum (at least 2 GSM
channels). To assess the MDSR performance under more adverse conditions for
IRC, simulations similar to those presented for DTS-2 scenario would be
appreciated, however with 2 equally strong adjacent channel interferers at 0
dB power each instead of one adjacent channel interferer at +3 dB.
The MDSR spectrum occupies two channels. This means that MDSR cannot be used
on the highest channel of an operator\'s frequency band. This restriction may
have an impact on the frequency planning. MDSR may require other channel
assignments or hopping sequences than legacy EGPRS.
Blind detection needs to be extended as shown in subclause 9.2.2.2.
The equaliser would have to cope with:
  * a longer impulse response in terms of taps;
  * more symbols and, in addition;
  * more states per symbol.
### 9.7.2 Impacts to the PCU
PCU needs to be able to handle double amount of bits per radio slot in uplink.
Other impacts to the PCU are minimal e.g. related to the RLC/MAC and resource
management.
### 9.7.3 Impacts to the BSS radio network planning
Without any DSR specific RRM optimisation the DSR can be used for frequency
reuses up to 1/1. IRC receiver can typically cope with increased UL
interference and voice capacity is not decreased e.g. assuming existing
networks employ MRC or have sufficient unused gain from IRC as shown in
subclause 9.5.5.
Indeed it is possible to use DSR specific RRM e.g. power control as depicted
in subclause 9.5.7, to ensure no impact to voice quality with legacy MRC
transceivers.
Possibly some considerations would be needed for edge channels of the operator
band e.g. use of DSR/EGPRS is restricted at edge channels by punctured MA list
, i.e. the applicable MA list will depend of the service.
With the new punctured MA list, there will be collisions in the used
frequencies in the hopping patterns because of unequal number of hopping
frequencies in the hopping lists [7].
The dual symbol rate benefits from synchronised BSS for tightest frequency
reuses, as does AMR with SAIC.
Performance in asynchronous networks is FFS. It could be assumed that DSR
power control can be optimised for asynchronous networks as well.
Neighbouring base stations on the same band with DSR should preferably use
interference rejection combining, and so would be more robust against uplink
interference from other cells. This may not be possible by all legacy
transceivers, e.g. MRC receivers thus RRM e.g. power control may be used to
cope with it.
Thus DSR does not need changes on the existing frequency planning and DSR may
be enabled like any plug and play feature to the existing networks.

## 9.10 Possible enhancements
### 9.10.1 Dual Symbol Rate in downlink
The deployment of DSR in DL as well would need either high diversity terminal
penetration or dedicated band and radio resources for DSR users. Both of these
are pretty unrealistic in release 7 timeline. Indeed dual carrier offers
already similar throughput gain in DL.

# 10 Latency enhancements
## 10.1 Introduction
Four different enhancements are studied and evaluated:
  * Improved ACK/NACK reporting.
  * Reduced Transmission Time Interval (TTI).
  * Variable sized Radio Blocks.
  * Hybrid ARQ.
The enhancements reduce overall latency and have a second order effect on
mean/average and peak bit rates as reduced latency (i.e. lowering the round
trip time) may provide better throughput if the bit rate on the link becomes
so high that the maximum buffer window size limits the transmission rate.
The improved ACK/NACK reporting and hybrid ARQ mainly provide reduced latency
in non-ideal radio conditions, as the number of re-transmissions is almost
zero in ideal conditions. The reduced TTI and Variable sized radio blocks
takes effect in both non-ideal radio conditions and ideal radio conditions.
### 10.1.1 Performance gains
#### 10.1.1.1 Web-browsing
Tests have been performed using a \"frozen\" CNN-test page of a size 137 kB
built by 37 objects. Results of \"time to download\" the web page have been
obtained as a function of different latency and bit rate combinations. The
values are based on measured results in lab with interpolation of values in-
between.
Figure 286 shows the download time as a function of throughput that are based
on measurements with throughput 40 kbps (web download time 51 s; not shown in
figure 286) and 200 kbps (web download time 25 s).

At higher throughputs the gain is reduced since the latency becomes the
limiting factor.
Figure 287 shows results for download time versus latency/RTT. The result is
based on lab measurements with latency 400 ms (web download time 25 s) and 150

#### 10.1.1.2 Delay estimations
Figure 289 shows a sequence chart containing GERAN interfaces identifying the
interfaces for possible delay reductions in GERAN, namely Abis and Um. The
Abis interface is typically not a matter of standardisation but have an
important role. Delay estimations for a few cases are shown below for
different cases including a VoIP case end-to-end, i.e. mouth-to-ear. The
latter case can be found in table 4. Note that these cases do not consider
multiplexing issues between 10 ms and legacy 20 ms users.

Figure 289: Indicative delays in GERAN network for a time slot\ Note that it
is assumed that the Abis delay is the same as the TTI value
Table 135 shows a delay scenario of typical existing deployments including
assumed node delays. It is calculated from when a BSC/PCU has received a
packet starting to send it to the MS assuming the RLC block included a poll
with RRBP=13, and ending when an answer has been received.

one retransmission the total transmission time is in the range of 70 ms to 95
ms.
Table 139 shows a end-to-end delay, mouth-to-ear, for a VoIP service that
utilises the latency enhancements and if these are not used (legacy case).
Note that it is assumed that one retransmission is enough, as incremental
redundancy would enable feasible frame error rates for speech. The use of the
IR functionality allows for a better radio resource usage than using a pure
un-acknowledgement mode.

The result is in the order of 240 ms. The required value for satisfied users
is around 200 ms to 300 ms according to ITU-T Recommendation G.114 [3]. The
result in table 4 is within that range.
#### 10.1.1.3 Email
There are number of email protocols defined, including X400, IMAP, and POP
(ref [1]). Of these, the widest used are POP and IMAP. This document considers
some performance issues of the POP3 protocol. First the use case of a user
downloading email headers from a server is considered. Then the use case of a
user downloading email content is considered.
##### 10.1.1.3.1 Download of Email Headers
Initially the user is able to download the message headers, in order to
quickly decide which emails should be downloaded in their entirety.
Assumptions are as follows:
* * *
Item _Value_ _Note_ Coding Scheme on downlink MCS-8 or MCS-9 permits at least
130 octets/ MAC PDU Timeslot allocation 4 down, 1 up  
E-mail download protocol POP3  
Average message header size 500 octets Including protocol overhead. Requires 1
RLC frame period @ 4 slots
* * *
The POP3 command sequence used to download message headers is defined in ref
[4], of which the following is an illustration (C: indicates command from
client, S: response from Server):
C: TOP 1 2
S: +OK
\
C: TOP 2 2
S: +OK
\
... etc
Assuming that there are _N_ email messages, the number of application layer
message and radio data transfer time _**T** ~trnsf~_ is as shown below:
* * *
Message Size Time/msg Number Total Time TOP command from client small 20ms _N_
_N_ × 20ms response to TOPfrom server 500 octets 20ms _N_ _N_ × 20ms **Total
(_T_** _~trnsf~_ **)** _N_**× 40ms**
* * *
The number of synchronous application protocol turnarounds (i.e. events where
an application level transmitter has to wait for a response before
proceeding), is denoted, **_P_** ~t~ and:
**_P_** ~t~ = 2 _N_
That is, between the TOP and the subsequent response there is one synchronous
turnaround event, as the client waits for the server to respond. Then there is
another turnaround event before the client sends the subsequent TOP command,
and so on.
**Existing value of 20 ms TTI**
Assuming the availability of high speed broadband links, it is assumed that
transaction time is dominated by the radio interface. The minimum transaction
time on the radio interface is computed by:
(time for data transfer _**T** ~trnsf~_)+ (minimum protocol turnaround time)
= _N_ × 40 ms + **_P_** ~t~ × (minimum wait for next RLC block period)
= _N_ × 40 ms + 2 _N_ × 20 ms
For 100 email message headers, this yields 8 sec.
**Advantage of 10 ms TTI**
In this case minimum wait for next RLC block period is 10ms. Minimum
transaction time is:
= _N_ × 40 ms + 2 _N_ × 10 ms
For 100 email message headers, this yields 6 sec
From the point of view of the user, the waiting time is reduced by a
perceptible 25 %.
Note that this analysis assumes the TTI reduction on the radio interface can
also be supported in on other parts of the network. Also note also that the
time to transfer should be reduced to 30 ms (=20 ms + 10 ms) since assumption
should be that TTI for both uplink and downlink is 10ms, and the small request
message can be transmitted uplink in this time.
##### 10.1.1.3.2 Download of Email Content
After the download of the email headers, the client typically downloads the
emails. This may take place in the background, allowing the user to examine
the headers for priority. Nevertheless, the faster this can be done the
better.
Assumptions are as follows:
* * *
Item _Value_ _Note_ Coding Scheme on downlink MCS-8 or MCS-9 permits at least
130 octets/ MAC PDU Timeslot allocation 4 down, 1 up  
E-mail download protocol POP3  
Average message download size 3 000 octets Including protocol overhead.
Requires 1 RLC frame period @ 4 slots
* * *
In order to very large messages blocking smaller ones for unlimited periods of
time, it is assumed that some strategy is adopted such as limiting the
download message size. Other strategies may be used, for example modifying
email content at the server to suit mobile device characteristics. Therefore
in this analysis the time taken to download a set of messages of average size
3 000 octets is considered.
The POP3 command sequence used to download messages is illustrated in ref [4],
of which the following is an extract (C: indicates command from client, S:
response from Server):
C: RETR 1
S: +OK 120 octets
S: \
S: .
C: DELE 1
S: +OK message 1 deleted
C: RETR 2
S: +OK 200 octets
S: \
S: .
C: DELE 2
S: +OK message 2 deleted
(etc, repeated once for each message)
C: QUIT
Assuming that there are _N_ messages, the number of application layer message
and radio transmission time is as shown below:
* * *
Message Size Time/msg Number Total Time RETR from client small 20ms _N_ _N_ ×
20ms response to RETR from server 3000 bytes 120ms _N_ _N_ × 120ms DELE from
client small 20ms _N_ _N_ × 20ms response to DELE from server small 20ms _N_
_N_ × 20ms **Total** _N_**× 180ms**
* * *
The number of synchronous application protocol turnarounds (i.e. events where
an application level transmitter has to wait for a response before
proceeding), is denoted, **_P_** ~t~ and since there are 2 commands and 2
responses sent per email:
**_P_** ~t~ = 4 _N_
By the same reasoning as above, the time to receive 100 message would be the
following:
  * At 20ms TTI: 26 sec.
  * At 10 ms TTI: 22 sec (15 % improvement).
  * At 5 ms TTI: 20 sec (23 % improvement).
Note that this analysis assumes client request messages are short and 10 ms
TTI should be allowed for uplink transmission. Transmission time above should
thus be 160 ms instead of 180 ms.
#### 10.1.1.4 Impact to TCP performance
##### 10.1.1.4.1 Introduction
Reducing the latency is not only important for VoIP but also for other
services, notably those run over TCP/IP. The purpose of this subclause is to
show that reduced latency is also important for FTP and HTTP applications that
use TCP. To this end, simulations have been made on a model of the BSS and CN
to obtain values of the user bit rate and download times for these
applications.
##### 10.1.1.4.2 System model and TCP parameters
We begin by describing the simulation network topology and method.
RTT simulations using constant bit rates are performed using a simplified
model of GERAN and the CN, see figure 290. We only consider RLC
retransmissions, the most important loop.
{width="4.519444444444445in" height="2.752083333333333in"}
Figure 290: Simulation network topology
The purpose of the simulations is to obtain end-2-end bit rates and download
times as functions of RLC RTT and \"Server to BTS latency\". The latter is a
one way delay, whereas RLC RTT is a delay loop in UL and DL. More precisely,
the RLC RTT is the delay from a TTI is received until erroneous PDUs are
filtered out for retransmission plus one TTI, i.e. it includes processing
delay, delay for sending RLC NACKs/ACKs and an immediate retransmission.
Furthermore, Server to BTS latency is the time from an IP packet is sent from
the server to it is available in the buffer for the first transmission over
the radio.
The radio link model can be described as follows: IP packets are segmented
into PDUs in the BTS node, and a TTI contains a number of PDUs. The number of
PDUs depends on the channel bit rate and PDU size. The simulator waits TTI ms
and determines which PDUs are erroneous. The erroneous PDUs are scheduled for
retransmission (RLC RTT - 1 TTI) ms later.
A PDU is determined to be erroneous or not by drawing a uniformly distributed
random number between 1 and 100. If the random number is less than a constant
\"target number\" (BLER), this PDU is considered as erroneous, and is thus
scheduled for retransmission (RLC RTT - 1 TTI) ms later. The errors of the
following PDUs are independently generated. We assume that an unlimited number
of retransmissions can occur, and that the RLC buffer and window size are
unlimited. PDUs for retransmission are prioritized over PDUs that are waiting
for a first transmission. The possibility that NACKs are erroneously
interpreted in the Node B (which would lead to unnecessary RLC
retransmissions) is **not** modelled. IP packets are forwarded to the upper
layers in-sequence.
The DL and UL bit rates are assumed to be constant. Two sets of rates are used
in order to show the impact of RTT on the PHY improvements suggested. To this
end, standard MCS-6 EDGE rates in a 4+2 timeslot configuration is compared to
an GERAN Evolution counterpart with four times higher bit rate.
The radio link parameters are summarized in table 140.
Table 140: System parameters
* * *
Parameters GERAN ev. EDGE DL bit rate [kbps] 454.4 113.6 UL bit rate [kbps]
227.2 56.8 DL PDU size [bytes] 142 71 UL PDU size [bytes] 71 71 In sequence
delivery Yes Yes TTI [ms] 20 20 DL and UL BLER [%] 10 10
* * *
The BLER value is important: a reduction to 1% will essentially remove the
impact of RLC RTT, but the capacity will be lower. We only use a 20 ms TTI
value here, this is not important for the performance results shown later.
However, a 10 ms TTI would enable lower RLC RTT values; these are just assumed
below.
The TCP settings are shown in table 141.
Table 141: TCP settings
* * *
TCP settings  
TCP version NewReno Packet size [bytes] 1500 TCP initial cwnd [packets] 2 TCP
max cwnd [packets] 42 TCP ssthresh [packets] 40 ACK delay at receiver [ms] 100
Min RTO [sec] 1.0
* * *
There are no packet losses in the network. The TCP ssthresh is the window size
at which TCP enters congestion avoidance. Hence, up to ssthresh TCP window
increases exponentially and after ssthresh the TCP window increases linearly.
Generally, TCP is in the exponentially increasing phase at all times in the
simulations performed in this contribution.
The TCP timeout timer (Retransmission Timeout, RTO) is set to 1 s, timeouts do
only occur for the largest values of RLC RTT.
##### 10.1.1.4.3 FTP performance
First we consider an ftp application. An ftp download of 100 kB application
data is performed 10 times. Figure 291 displays the end-2-end average bit
rates for EDGE MCS-6. Rates above 90 kbps are obtained for RLC below 100 ms if
the Server to BTS delay (one way) is low, but the decay of the bit rate with
delay is rather slow for these PHY (radio link) rates as expected.
Higher PHY rates are more sensitive to delays as shown in figure 292, which
shows the corresponding results for the four times faster GERAN Evolution
(GEV) radio link. For low latencies peak rates exceed 280 kbps, and these are
substantially reduced if the RTT is higher. The reductions are of the order of
30 % to 40 % if the RLC RTT increases from 50 ms to 300 ms depending on the
Server to BTS latency. The gains are larger if the latter (one-way) delay is
smaller: up to 80 % in some cases by reducing the RLC RTT from 300 ms to 50
ms.
Figure 293 displays the GEV result in a different form. The jerk in the curve
at 300 ms RLC RTT and 50 ms Server to BTS latency is due to a TCP timeout
occurring once out of 10 simulations.
It is concluded that reducing the RLC RTT to exploit the increased link rates
in GEV is important also for the FTP application. It is also important to
reduce the Server to BTS delay.

##### 10.1.1.4.4 HTTP download
Next we consider download of a WEB page (http). The format of the web page is
shown in table 142.
Table 142: WEB page
* * *
WEB page  
Number of objects 8 Packet size [bytes] 1 500 Size object 1 [packets] 41 Size
object 2 [packets] 45 Size object 3 [packets] 8 Size object 4 [packets] 7 Size
object 5 [packets] 4 Size object 6 [packets] 4 Size object 7 [packets] 3 Size
object 8 [packets] 2
* * *
The HTTP download is only performed once. The WEB page objects are downloaded
in sequence, i.e. the download of the second object starts after the first
object has been completely downloaded. For the HTTP we show download times
rather than bit rates to get an indication of the user experience.
The download time for the WEB page in table 135 is shown in figure 294 as a
function of the Server to BTS latency. The reduction of download time varies
between 40 % to 60 % as server to BTS latency is reduced from 200 ms to 10 ms,
with lager reductions the lower the RLC RTT.
The same results for constant Server to BTS delays are shown in figure 295\.
The reduction of download time varies between 25 % to 50% if RLC RTT is
reduced from 300 ms to 50 ms, with larger reductions the lower the Server to
BTS latency.
In the extreme case the download reduces from 30.3 sec to 8.8 sec if both RLC
RTT and Server to BTS latency is reduced simultaneously.

Like for the FTP application, it is concluded that the HTTP application will
also benefit from the GEV PHY if the latency is reduced.
It is noted that the TCP performance as a function of the delays defined above
will not change if the TTI is reduced, but a reduction of the TTI will make it
possible to attain lower values of the RLC RTT and the Server to BTS latency.
The gains will increase then, and the GEV PHY improvements will be exploited.
##### 10.1.1.4.5 Measured delays in BSS and CN
The above results have shown the importance of reducing the RLC RTT and Server
to BTS latency. The BSS to MS delay is indeed the major contributor to the
delay, at least in the current network implementations.
To give an idea about the delay values some measurement data is presented
below. The measurements were taken using a Nokia 6230 TEMS connected to a PC
in a lab environment with a single EDGE capable TRX and a 4*64 kbps dynamic
ABIS pool. 855 PING (32 Bytes) requests were captured. There was no other
traffic in the network.
The results show that the CN delay (RTT_Gb_Gb: observed on Gb uplink to seen
on Gb downlink) is about 1.5 % of the total PING delay to the DNS server. The
downlink BSC delay is larger than UL due to TBF allocations.
The RTT_MS_MS (total round trip) varied between 540 ms to 1 200 ms, whereas
the RTT_Abis_Abis (Abis up to Abis down) varied from about 70 ms to 190 ms.
Hence the BSS to MS is the major contributor to the end-2-end delay.
The measurements indicated that the RLC_RTT constitutes the main part of the
delay. It is likely that the PC-MS PPP link delay and the MS processing delay
is significant, but that could not be measured.
##### 10.1.1.4.6 The importance of the PING size
The average end-2-end RTT is important for TCP, but the smaller PING sizes do
not show the impact of the RLC RTT for TCP. A 64 byte PING will be contained
in a single PDU, whereas a 1 500 Byte PING is segmented into many PDUs where
the probability that at least one of them is retransmitted is substantially
higher.
To show this effect we consider PING sizes of 64 and 1 500 Bytes,
respectively. In the simulations, the end-2-end RTT is measured 50 times and
the time between the pings are set to 2.002 sec. By the 2 ms extra wait
between the PINGs, the time that the IP packets arrive to the buffer for first
transmission over the radio is phase shifted compared to the TTI clock. Hence,
in average each packet will wait ½ TTI before next TTI is sent.
Figure 296 shows the average end-2-end delay as a function of the RLC RTT and
the Server to BTS latency for a 64 Byte PING. Note that there is hardly any
dependence on the RLC RTT since retransmissions occurs infrequently. Even
though the GERAN evolution RTT requirement is 100 ms, it is worth to notice
that at 50 ms RLC RTT and 10 ms Server to BTS latency the average end-2-end
RTT is around 90 ms.
{width="5.975694444444445in" height="4.492361111111111in"}
Figure 296: Average end-2-end RTT
The results for a 1 500 Byte PING are shown in figure 297, which clearly shows
the effect of an increased RLC RTT on the average end-2-end RTT.
Figures 298 and 299 show the minimum observed end-2-end delay. For the 64 Byte
PING there are no retransmissions over the radio link and essentially no
dependence on RLC RTT. The increase of the delay for higher RLC RTT that can
be observed in figure 299 are due to none of the 50 IP packets are transferred
without RLC retransmissions, which indicates the high probability of
retransmissions for large IP packets. Thus, for TCP traffic, it is not enough
to put a requirement on PING RTT of small packets, since RLC RTT may be high
and give poor TCP throughput.

## 10.2 Improved ACK/NACK reporting
### 10.2.1 Concept description
#### 10.2.1.1 Event based RLC ACK/NACK reports
Currently, the RLC/MAC ACK/NACK reporting is a time consuming procedure. This
is especially true for downlink transfers. The procedure for DL transfers is
that the BSS periodically (RRBP) polls the mobile for ACK/NACK reports.
Considering the periodicity for the polling, it is realistic that it takes in
the order of 150 ms to 250 ms from an RLC block is considered lost in the MS
until the PCU realises it. This is a large problem especially considering
delay sensitive applications such as Push-To-Talk over Cellular (PoC) and
Voice over IP (VoIP). Consider also that in RLC Acknowledged mode the LLC
layer in the receiver applies \"in-order-delivery\" to upper layers, which
means that a single lost RLC data block will delay all consecutive LLC packets
until this RLC data block has been successfully transmitted. A high-level
example of the procedure is shown in figure 300 assuming a regular poll at
every 12^th^ RLC block.
{width="4.50625in" height="2.433333333333333in"}
Figure 300: The principle of ARQ handling of DL RLC/MAC data block
transmission assuming\ a poll every 12^th^ RLC data block
\"RRBP poll\" in this context means a BSS ordered periodic poll for DL
ACK/NACK from the MS. \"USF scheduling\" is the procedure for BSS to allow a
specific MS to send data uplink on the specified UL channel.
Two methods to improve ACK/NACK reporting are:
  * Event based RLC ACK/NACK reports.
  * Downlink ACK/NACK in uplink data.
Those are detailed in next sub-chapters.
It is also possible to reduce the delay for the regular polling method. The
scheduling of the \"RRBP poll\" can set a lowest possible value for an answer
to 13 TDMA frames after the start of the reception. This could be lowered to 4
or 5 frames instead with a possible reduction of the delay of around 40
milliseconds.
#### 10.2.1.2 Event based RLC ACK/NACK reports
A different approach to the periodic polls from the BSS would be that when the
receiver (MS) realises that a RLC data block is missing - from BSN sequence
out of order or, in the EGPRS case, when the BSN is successfully decoded but
the RLC data is not - it could report this to the BSS without waiting for a
regular poll. The \"event\" is occurring when the mobile station discovers a
missing/erroneous RLC block. To avoid collisions on the shared UL physical
channel(s) the event based ACK/NACK would have to be scheduled by BSS, and
thus sent as a response to an USF scheduling. To let the BSS still have
control over the balance between payload and ACK/NACKs in the UL direction, it
may be desired that the BSS still control the mobile station usage also if the
MS will be using the USF method. This can be done for example by setting a
maximum ratio between ACK/NACK and payload, and/or set how many RLC data
blocks that shall be missing before an event based DL ACK/NACK is sent. This
would let the BSS dynamically control the DL ACK/NACK reporting depending on
what is currently the main payload direction and also considering QoS
requirements. In addition, by using USF scheduling the BSS would also have
control over multiplexing of different users versus DL ACK/NACK reporting.
Figure 301 gives an example of a possible event based ACK/NACK protocol
sequence.
{width="4.802777777777778in" height="2.470138888888889in"}
Figure 301: The principle of event based ARQ handling of DL RLC data block
transmission\ including a regular poll defined to occur at every 12^th^ RLC
data block transmission
The regular poll is still expected to be needed even when using the event
based ACK/NACK procedure, e.g. because there could be no or very few errors
and the network could need ACKs, \"I\'m alive function\", and performance
feedback, but it could be sent less often and not be dependent on neither
#errors nor QoS requirements. It is assumed that the event based ACK/NACK uses
the same message as the answer to the regular poll, i.e. the Packet Downlink
ACK/NACK. Since the response from the mobile station contains enough
information, the network side knows when the ACK/NACK message was constructed
and sent, the BSS RLC/MAC scheduling can avoid any duplicated re-transmission
despite that the same error may be reported twice before retransmitted on the
first occasion, e.g. reported by both the regular RRBP poll and the event
based method.
It is assumed that an UL TBF exists. Typically this is true in many use cases
(together with Extended UL TBF). If an UL TBF does not exist a \"TBF/USF\"
could be established for the ACK/NACK procedure or the conventional polling
need to be used.
#### 10.2.1.3 ACK/NACK in Uplink Data
There are two ways how ACK/NACK information can be included (piggy-backed)
into RLC data blocks:
  * Include ACK/NACK in the header of an RLC data block.
  * Include the ACK/NACK in the payload part of an RLC data block.
##### 10.2.1.3.1 ACK/NACK in RLC header
There are spare bits in the RLC/MAC header for EGPRS uplink data blocks. These
could be used for ACK/NACK blocks for the DL TBF. The method should be event
based as described in subclause 10.2.1.2, which means that the bits shall be
used only if there are lost blocks. Since there are very little room for
sending BSN, the exact meaning of the bits needs to be defined.
The advantages with this method may be:
  * Immediate NACK of lost RLC block possible -> low latency.
  * No reduction of uplink capacity.
This method should be regarded as a complement to the method described in
subclause 10.2.1.2.
##### 10.2.1.3.2 Fast Ack/Nack reporting sending Ack/Nack in payload of an RLC
data block
Due to the very little room in the header of EGPRS uplink RLC data blocks, an
alternative to the solution outlined in the sub-clause above (subclause
10.2.1.3.1) is to reuse part of the payload of an EGPRS uplink RLC data block
to convey signalling information.
##### 10.2.1.3.2.1 Short bitmap in an RLC data block {#short-bitmap-in-an-rlc-
data-block .H6}
The principle is that, instead of sending back to the transmitter a long
bitmap in a dedicated radio block (i.e. the PDAN), the receiver could send
back a very short bitmap, embedded in a normal RLC data block, leaving a lot
of space to carry user plane data in the reverse direction.
The short bitmap would contain information about the recently received radio
blocks, independently of their Block Sequence Number. The new bitmap would
therefore be no longer indexed by a Starting Sequence Number, but on a time
basis. More precisely, if a polling indication is received in radio block at
time x, the mobile station would send back a short bitmap indicating the
status of all the radio blocks received in all the assigned timeslots at time
x, x-1, etc. depending on the size of the short bitmap and the number of
assigned timeslots. The network as the sender knows the BSNs of the
corresponding RLC blocks, when receiving the short bitmap, so that the correct
information can be derived.
The length of the short bitmap has to be linked to the maximum number of RLC
blocks that can be submitted during two successive pollings, and should take
into account that some polling requests/short bitmaps might get lost. A
suitable size for the short bitmap (which is anyway suggested to be fixed) is
expected to be 4 octets.
Note that size of short bitmap is also linked to the acceptable TBF
multiplexing level. Once the size of the short bitmap is fixed, also the
maximum allowed TBF multiplexing level is fixed (on the timeslots where the
Fast Ack/Nack reporting scheme is used).
Since there might be two RLC data blocks per radio block (in case of MCS
7/8/9), two bits per radio block are needed in the bitmap. For every radio
block received in the assigned timeslots, the receiver shall set the pair of
bits in the short bitmap in the following way:
+-----+---------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0 0 | - failed header decoding | | | | | | - header correctly received but with a different DL TFI | | | | | | - header correctly received (with the correct DL TFI) but | | | failed decoding of the payload of the RLC block (or blocks, | | | in case of MCS 7/8/9) | +-----+---------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0 1 | header correctly received (with the correct DL TFI), failed | | | decoding of the first RLC data block, correct decoding of the | | | second RLC data block | +-----+---------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1 0 | header correctly received (with the correct DL TFI), correct | | | decoding of the first RLC data block, failed decoding of the | | | second RLC data block | +-----+---------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1 1 | correct decoding of the payload of the RLC block, or correct | | | decoding of both the first and second RLC data blocks | +-----+---------------------------------------------------------------+
In case of multiple TBFs, the same bitmap could carry the information for all
the TBFs. In this case bits would be set to 1 for RLC blocks correctly
received with any of the assigned DL TFIs. This would further optimize the
procedure since feedback for all the TBFs could be provided at the same time.
If the polling is received in a radio block at time x, the first pair of bits
in the short bitmap shall refer to the radio block received on the first
assigned timeslot at time x, the second pair of bits shall refer to the radio
block received on the second assigned timeslot at time x, etc. If there is
still free space in the bitmap, the next pair of shall refer to the radio
block received on the first assigned timeslot at time x-1 (i.e. in the
previous 20 ms) and so on.
Note that the option of polling in different radio blocks with different RRBP
values pointing at the same frame in the UL should not be allowed in this
case. Note also that to minimize the effect of the MS reaction time, a further
option could be to include in the bitmap information about the radio blocks
received between the polling request and the polling response.
In figure 302 and the example is shown, referring to a DL TBF allocated on
timeslots 0, 1, 2 and 3 (TBF1) and multiplexed with other TBFs (TBF2 and
TBF3). The length of the short bitmap is assumed to be of only 2 octets in
this example.

Figure 302: Example of fast ack/nack reporting operation
EGPRS uplink RLC data block would be formatted according to the figure below,
where the insertion of the optional Short Bitmap field would depend on the
presence of a polling indication in the previous corresponding DL radio block.
This would also be signalled by a bit indicator reusing one of the spare bits
in the UL RLC data block header.

Figure 303: New Uplink EGPRS RLC data block
To preserve normal RLC operation, if an UL RLC data block has to be
retransmitted, the size of the data part will have to remain the same as
before. A different short bitmap shall anyway be included (independently of
polling from the network) if the original transmission contained one. In case
of EGPRS this means that if the new bit indicator in the UL RLC data block
header indicates that the last 4 octets of the payload contain a Short Bitmap,
the corresponding octets shall not be used when joint decoding is applied.
When Incremental redundancy is used, soft combining / depuncturing before
convolutional decoding shall be applied only to the RLC data part (which
remains the same for all the retransmissions). Incremental redundancy is not
used for the decoding of octets of the short bitmap: only the last
retransmission is used.
This is highlighted in the following diagram, that shows the encoded bits for
two repetitions of the same RLC block:
{width="4.936805555555556in" height="1.770138888888889in"}
In case of repetitions, only the bits in the completely green part can be used
for soft combining. Other bits should be excluded from the soft combining
process. Note that this would result in a different (lower) decoding
performance for the last k bits of the data part (where k is the constraint
length) since soft combining cannot be used to derive their values.
An alternative would be to reduce the length of the data part by k bits by
setting the last k bits to zero. In this case the encoded bits for two
repetitions of the same RLC block are shown in the following diagram:
{width="4.978472222222222in" height="1.8125in"}
In this case it is possible to apply soft combining to derive all the bits of
the data part so that decoding performance would not be affected. In practice,
with this solution, it would be possible to keep the convolutional decoding
algorithms unchanged: in other words, convolutional decoding could be
performed over the whole block length, and the \'0\' bits would ensure that
the Viterbi algorithm trellis is properly terminated at the end of the data
part, and the last M decoded bits (where M is the length of the short bitmap)
could just be discarded. Obviously, the short bitmap would need to be decoded
separately.
##### 10.2.1.3.2.2 Short bitmap in a single burst {#short-bitmap-in-a-single-
burst .H6}
A further possibility is the alternative submission of the short bitmap in a
single burst (e.g. a newly formatted normal burst), if no other data and/or
measurement reports have to be submitted.
As soon as the MS has no additional data payload to submit, e.g. during the
Extended UL TBF phase, the MS could send a single burst carrying the short
bitmap. This could save MS battery life and keep the UL interference low in
the network, since only 1 out of 4 bursts of a radio block might be used.
##### 10.2.1.3.2.3 Reduced MS reaction time {#reduced-ms-reaction-time .H6}
The other proposal is to reduce the minimum reaction time during the polling
procedure, bringing it from 13 TDMA frames to 8 (or 9) TDMA frames, thus
gaining 20 ms.
##### 10.2.1.3.2.4 Co-existence with legacy procedures {#co-existence-with-
legacy-procedures .H6}
In any case the new reporting mechanism based on the short bitmap has to co-
exist with the old one. This is needed for instance when several subsequent
polling requests/short bitmaps are not received (by the MS or the network). To
obtain feedback information from the MS the only possibility in this case
would be to ask for the normal PDAN message.
This can be done by a redefinition of the RRBP and ES/P fields in the header
of EGPRS DL data blocks. The RRBP field could be split into 2 field: a new
RRBP field (defining only two possible values: 20 ms and 40 ms reaction time)
and a RS field defining the Reporting Scheme.

to the tables below.

1 1 RRBP field is valid - Ack/Nack bitmap type NPB, measurement report

NOTE: This applies only if the RS bit is set to 0.
* * *
With this approach the network could dynamically request either the short
bitmap (default case) or the conventional Ack/Nack message when necessary to
recover from the loss of several successive polling requests / polling
responses.
#### 10.2.1.4 Fast Ack/Nack reporting in UL and DL
Piggybacking Ack/Nack reporting in both Uplink and downlink can be done by
locating the Ack/Nack data in the payload. An example is shown in subclause
10.2.1.3.2 for piggybacking in UL. This subchapter describes a method to do it
in both UL and DL; including a BSN based short Ack/Nack structure.
##### 10.2.1.4.1 BSN based short Ack/Nack report
The suggested report has the size of n*3 byte, where n is the minimum number
of segments that are needed for a report. Each segment of 3 byte consists of 5
fields, as shown in Table 9. One segment of 3 bytes is normally sufficient if
errors are close together and belong to only one TBF, but it can be extended
if needed for reports of different TBFs allocated to the same MS to allow for
a combined Ack/Nack report to be sent or reporting of several erroneous BSN:s
with large separation.
The Ack/Nack report is placed in the data field of the radio block, and is
covered by the current channel coding and CRC. However, even if errors are
detected in the data field, there should still be a good chance that the
Ack/Nack report is correct. A separate CRC is therefore proposed for each
Ack/Nack segment, so that the segments can be used if correct. If the radio
block is erroneous, the Ack/Nack report will also be retransmitted together
with the data, and IR is used for decoding of the second transmission.
Table 146: Data fields in one Ack/Nack report segment
* * *
Field Size Usage Address 0 bit to 3 bits TBF of the Ack/Nack information
(identified by TFI). The size is a function of the number of active TBF:s for
the user. BSN_NACK 11 bits BSN of a radio block that has not been correctly
received. BSN_MAP 6 bits to 9 bits Ack/Nack bitmap of the block sequence
numbers following BSN_NACK Extension bit 1 bit 0: Report is complete, 1: A new
Ack/Nack segment follows, using the same format. CRC 3 bits CRC covering the 3
byte segment
* * *
EXAMPLE: A user has 2 allocated TBFs and shall send a short Ack/Nack report of
the current status. Acknowledged mode is used, so all errors should be
reported. (If non-persistent mode had been used, only the most recent errors
would be reported.) The TBF with lowest ID have received BSN 1, 2, 4 and 7
without error. The BSNs 3, 5 and 6 was erroneous while BSN 8 and higher
numbers have not yet arrived.
The TBF with highest ID has received BSNs 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15.
The BSNs 2, 6, 7, 13, 14 and 16 was erroneous while BSN 17 and higher have not
yet arrived.
In table 147 the Ack/Nack report is shown. Three segments are needed: one for
the first TBF and two segments for the second TBF. Note that for the second
TBF, BSN 11 and 12 are not covered by any of the two bitmaps. That is not
needed, since they are implicitly acknowledged when the BSN_NACK number in the

##### 10.2.1.4.2 Ack/Nack reporting sent in UL direction
Subclause 10.2.1.3.2 describes a method how to do fast reporting in the UL
direction by using piggybacking if data blocks are to be sent and it reuses
the polling mechanisms with a slightly modified header such that legacy
operation is still possible.
Legacy polling is still needed in order to support legacy MSs and as well as
for keep-alive and Link Quality Control (LQC) purposes for mobile that support
fast Ack/Nack reporting. The result would be a (substantially) reduced legacy
polling repetition rate being applied for MSs that support fast Ack/Nack
reporting compared to MSs that only support the legacy Packet Ack/Nack
reporting scheme. Using the proposed short bitmap in [5], also described in
option 1 of Chapter 2, the repetition rate of the legacy polling need also to
be chosen to cater for the case when the short bitmap moves outside the short
bit map window with errors. This is not the case if the Ack/Nack report is
based on sequence numbers as suggested in option 2 of chapter 2.
The objective is to keep the network in control of how often an MS is allowed
to send Ack/Nack reports. The reporting is performed as follows using the poll
(RRBP) and USF fields in the downlink direction. If a mobile station has
received a:
  * RRBP (identified by the poll-bit) + USF for the same UL block period > as identified in the poll (RRBP) the MS shall send:
\- A piggybacked DL Ack/Nack with data payload if one or more RLC data blocks
have been received in error and are still outstanding.
\- A normal RLC data block (no piggybacking of Ack/Nack) if RLC data block
have been received in error.
\- Normal (legacy) Ack/Nack report if there are no data payload to be sent.
  * RRBP (identified by the poll-bit) and no USF in same period, the MS > shall send a Normal Ack/Nack report (legacy case).
Thus, the network remains in control of the reporting (as in legacy case). In
addition to the above scheme it could also be possible for the MS to report on
its own (i.e. independent of RRBP) but then it needs to do this only when it
is USF-scheduled. This should be limited to the case when there is space left
in the UL data block or there is no data block to be sent in order to reduce
potential increase of signalling and reduced overall performance. The event-
driven MS controlled reporting could be allowed by the network so an operator
could set a parameter at TBF set-up or, in general such as on a per cell
basis, if this should be allowed or not.
The mobile station may, typically, need to prepare in advance both a short
piggy-backed Ack/Nack report and a normal, non-piggybacked Ack/Nack report
(where the non-piggybacked report may be a short Ack/Nack report or a full
report) when the polling bit is received since a USF may or may not be
allocated immediately before the report is to be transmitted in uplink
direction.
In order for the receiver to know if there is a short (piggybacked) Ack/Nack
report included in the UL RLC data block a header bit is needed to indicate if
a piggy-backed Ack/Nack is added to the data block. A spare bit in the RLC/MAC
header is used to indicate if a piggy-backed Ack/Nack is included in the UL
RLC data block or not. A spare bit exists in all three EGPRS header types and
will be used for this case. The different Header types are shown in figures
307 to 309 (taken from 3GPP TS 44.060).

##### 10.2.1.4.3 Ack/Nack reporting sent in DL direction
In order for the mobile station to determine that a short Ack/Nack report is
included in the data block, the receiver need to know determine this, if
possible without any double decoding. A bit in the header would indicate this.
A redefinition of the RRBP and ES/P fields in the header of the EGPRS DL data
blocks can be utilised (in [5] the same principle is used in another way to
support UL piggybacking). The RRBP field is split into 2 fields: a new RRBP
field (defining only two possible values: 20 ms and 40 ms reaction time) and
an Ack/Nack field indicating a short Ack/Nack bitmap has been included in the
data part, see figure 310.

* * *
Figure 310: RRBP, AN and ES/P fields in modified EGPRS downlink RLC data block
headers
The meaning of the RRBP, RS and ES/P fields would be interpreted according to
tables 148 to 150 (note that the \"Bit\" or \"Bits\" indicates the #bits and
individual order and not the actual bit position in the header). Note that the
modification is backward compatible as used only for MSs capable of this
reporting. The legacy header structure will still remain for legacy MSs and if
fast reporting is not needed.

1 0 RRBP field is valid - Extended Ack/Nack bitmap type NPB
1 1 RRBP field is valid - Ack/Nack bitmap type NPB, measurement report
included
* * *
It is assumed that the RRBP can be reduced for this case of reporting. The old
reporting scheme could very easily be supported by initialising this at e.g.
TBF set-up, if necessary.
#### 10.2.1.5 Possible usage
A possible use of the improved ACK/NACK procedures is (considering data
transmitted in downlink):
UL TBF exist:
  * If UL data is sent  use the \"ACK/NACK in uplink data\" / \"Fast > Ack/Nack reporting\" mechanism.
  * If UL data is not sent  use the Packet Downlink Ack/Nack message as > a response to a USF/ \"Fast Ack/Nack reporting\" mechanism by > sending a short bitmap/short Ack/Nack report in a single burst.
UL TBF does not exist:
  * The normal poll mechanism, i.e. use the Packet Downlink Ack/Nack > message as a response to a \"RRBP poll\" / \"Fast Ack/Nack > reporting\" mechanism by sending a short bitmap/short Ack/Nack > report in a single burst.
  * In case of data sent in the uplink, the network can decide whether > or not to piggy-back the Ack/Nack reports in downlink RLC data > blocks, if there is such possibility, since network performs the > scheduling.
### 10.2.2 Modelling assumptions and requirements
The simulation environment is shown in figure 311. It is a single user RLC
protocol simulator where the LLC packet sizes, MCS, multislot and polling
could be set. The radio channel is modelled by a BLER setting that also
includes incremental redundancy. The feedback channel is ideal. The radio
channel introduces the radio transmission delay (TTI).

### 10.2.3 Performance characterization
#### 10.2.3.1 Performance gain of \"Event based RLC Ack/Nack reports\"
The performance results are shown in figures 312 and 313. The reference case
is when polling is used (a poll is executed every 12^th^ RLC block). For each
case of the cases, i.e. event based and polling, a poll is also done on the
last RLC block in the RLC send buffer.

The performance gain of having an event-based scheme is obvious. Table 151
summarises the gain at the median and 90 % CDF levels. The gain for the Event
based Ack/Nack is relative the polling case.
Table 151

Table 152 shows the number of average sent Ack/Nack reports for the different
simulated cases. Note also that so called \"final\" Ack/Nack reports are
included in the figures (i.e. for the poll sent in the last RLC block in sent
buffer). Table 152 also shows the relative increase of Ack/Nack reports for
the event case compared to the simulated polling case.
Table 152
+-------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----+ | Case | Average number of | Event/Poll ratio | | | | Ack/Nack per LLC | | | | | block | | | +-------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----+ | | Poll | Event | | +-------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----+ | 500B MCS-6\ | 1.8 | 3.4 | 1.8 | | (7 radio blocks) | | | | +-------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----+ | 500B MCS-9 | 1.6 | 2.4 | 1.5 | | | | | | | (4 radio blocks) | | | | +-------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----+ | 1 500B MCS-6\ | 3.1 | 6.2 | 2.0 | | (21 radio blocks) | | | | +-------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----+ | 1 500B MCS-9\ | 2.0 | 4.1 | 2.0 | | (11 radio blocks) | | | | +-------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----+
The event/poll ratio shows that between 1.5 up to 2 times more reports are
sent. How the increase in number of Ack/Nack events will affect the radio
resource usage depends if, and how much, event based reports can be sent
within any UL data blocks.
Table153 summarizes the gains from a time perspective, i.e. how many users
have received the data without errors within a specific time. The specific
time instants are taken at the 50 % CDF level for regular polling and are
shown in table 151.
Table 153
+--------------------------------------+---------------------+-------+ | Case | Percentage of users | | | | | | | | [%] | | +--------------------------------------+---------------------+-------+ | | poll | event | +--------------------------------------+---------------------+-------+ | 500B, MCS-6; #user\'s LLC ≤ 0.3 s | 56 | 96 | +--------------------------------------+---------------------+-------+ | 500B, MCS-9; #user\'s LLC ≤ 0.24 s | 82 | 98 | +--------------------------------------+---------------------+-------+ | 1500B, MCS-6; #user\'s LLC ≤ 0.64 s | 66 | 86 | +--------------------------------------+---------------------+-------+ | 1500B, MCS-9; #user\'s LLC ≤ 0.4 s | 60 | 92 | +--------------------------------------+---------------------+-------+
The gains are quite substantial and a larger number of users receive an LLC
packet within a certain time limit than with a regular polling (here assumed
set to 12).
NOTE: Gain does not assume similar uplink loads (feedback channel) between
regular poll and the event-based approach.
#### **10.2.3.2 Performance gain of the** \"Fast Ack/Nack reporting\"
mechanism
The following assumption are considered:
  * The intrinsic _RLC RTT_ (i.e. the time to cross two times the A-bis > and Um interfaces plus the processing delay of network nodes) is > assumed to be of 100 ms.
  * The considered multislot allocation is 4 (DL) + 1 (UL).
  * In case of conventional Ack/Nack reporting procedure, the polling > period is 12 RLC blocks, i.e. the polling bit is set every 60 ms. > The minimum (legacy) RRBP value is considered, leading to an MS > reaction time of 40 ms.
  * In case of the proposed fast Ack/Nack reporting strategy, the > polling is set at every radio block (i.e. every 20 ms). The > minimum new RRBP value is considered, leading to an MS reaction > time of 20 ms.
Based on these values, the table below reports, for the conventional and the
new proposed schemes:
the maximum time (_RLC RTT + MS React Time + (Polling Period - 20 ms)_) in
order to receive a retransmission (when a lost RLC block is detected) the
percentage of available bandwidth for data transmission on the UL TBF.
+------------------------+------------------------+------------------+ | | _Conventional |_ Fast reporting _| | | reporting_ | | +------------------------+------------------------+------------------+ | Maximum retransmission | 100+40+40= | 100+20 = | | time | | | | | **180 ms** | **120 ms** | +------------------------+------------------------+------------------+ | Percentage of | 66.6% | **80%** (MCS1) | | available bandwidth in | | | | the UL | | **94.6%** (MCS6) | | | | | | | | **97.3%** (MCS9) | +------------------------+------------------------+------------------+
The example indicates that a huge benefit is expected in terms of reduced
transfer delay since the retransmission time of single RLC block is reduced by
one third. At the same time a consistent improvement is expected in terms of
uplink capacity that would increase from 66.6 % (with respect to the
theoretically available one) to 80 % in the worst case, up to 95 % to 97 % if
higher MCSs are used in the UL.
### 10.2.4 Impacts to the mobile station
The mobile station needs be able to schedule and send event based ACK/NACK.
The mobile station needs be able to insert a short bitmap or a short Ack/Nack
report in an UL RLC data block when polled accordingly.
The mobile station needs to be able to receive a short Ack/Nack report in a DL
RLC data block.
### 10.2.5 Impacts to the BSS
The PCU needs to be updated to handle new ACK/NACK scheme. Reuse of existing
signalling messages except for the case using ACK/NACK in uplink data/\"Fast
Ack/Nack reporting\" mechanism. There is an impact on BTS algorithms to
exploit Incremental Redundancy in case of the \"Fast Ack/Nack reporting\"
mechanism.. No impacts to the BTS. Potentially some new parameter setting
ACK/NACK reporting constraints need to be signalled to the Mobile station
### 10.2.6 Impacts to the Core Network
No impacts.
### 10.2.7 Impacts to the specifications
The impacted 3GPP specifications are listed in table 154.

## 10.3 Reduced transmission time interval

A reduced transmission time interval (TTI) will reduce the Round Trip Time.

on the MS capability and the radio conditions one or more radio blocks are
necessary to send a Ping. By reducing the TTI the time needed to complete a
Ping will be lowered.

conditions\ (note that the delay over Abis depends on configuration). In
addition, node processing delay,\ core network delay and internet delay will
contribute to the end-to-end delay
Today a radio block is divided into four bursts that are mapped onto four
consecutive TDMA frames using one timeslot per frame, giving a TTI of 20 ms.
This together with frequency hopping provides frequency diversity since coding
and interleaving is done over one radio block. There are two ways to extend
this to become more generic and reduce the delay for one radio block: in time-
slot domain and in frequency domain.
#### 10.3.1.1 Radio block mapping in time-slot domain
Figure 315 shows two examples of radio block mapping in time-slot domain.

Figure 315: Different mappings in time-slot domain of four bursts onto a radio
block
The mapping of the four bursts to a radio block consists of:
i) two consecutive TDMA frames and two consecutive timeslots (left figure).
ii) one TDMA frame and four consecutive timeslots (right figure).
Alternative (i) reduces the TTI from 20 ms to 10 ms and alternative (ii) to 5
ms.
#### 10.3.1.2 Radio block mapping in frequency domain (inter-carrier
interleaving)
By mapping the four bursts of a radio block onto two consecutive TDMA frames
on two separate carriers, the TTI can be reduced to 10 ms - without
sacrificing frequency diversity. Similarly, quadruple-carrier EGPRS can be
used to reduce the TTI to 5 ms. This is illustrated in figure 316. In order to
avoid losing frequency diversity, the carriers should not be adjacent in
frequency (in figure 316, they are depicted as adjacent only for simplicity).

Alternative (iii) reduces the TTI from 20 ms to 10 ms and alternative (iv) to
5 ms.
Frequency hopping can be applied as in the single-carrier case by assigning
the same hopping sequence but different offsets (MAIO:s) to the different
carriers.
#### 10.3.1.3 USF scheduling of shorter TTI and legacy mobile stations
##### 10.3.1.3.1 Basic principle
In order to support legacy mobile stations the USF structure must remain the
same. This means that also the new, shorter TTI mobile stations need to adhere
to the basic principle, possibly including some backward compatible additions
if needed. However, one simple and backward compatible way is to completely
rely on the existing USF scheduling method.
With this method, all USFs are always sent in the same dimension as the
traditional USF, i.e. using a 20 ms USF allocation period for the next UL data
period of 20 ms (that may be subdivided into 10 or even 5 ms TTIs). The USFs
belonging to mobile stations with a lower TTI, such as 10 ms, are redefined so
that an USF on carrier 1 corresponds to the first 10 ms radio block in the
coming 20 ms period, while an USF on PDCH 2 corresponds to the second 10 ms
period. In table 155 an allocation example is shown. Mobile stations \"A\" and
\"D\" is using 10 ms TTI. Mobile stations \"B\" and \"C\" are legacy mobile
stations having 20 ms TTI. The downlink data blocks can be sent to any mobile
station and the 10 ms and 20 ms (legacy) TTI mobile stations can be
multiplexed freely. Chapter 2.2 investigates potential issues related to USF
decoding in downlink when 10 ms and 20 ms TTIs data blocks are multiplexed on
same DL PDCH. Note that all UL frames can be allocated if within each 20 ms
block period the same TTI is used. That is, it is only possible to change TTI
at 20 ms intervals (this is also valid for DL data frames).
Table 155: Example of a 12-frame sequence with USF allocation, B and C are
legacy users (20 ms)\ while users A and D are 10 ms TTI users (note that TDMA
frame numbering is\ only based on data carrying frames)

.
##### 10.3.1.3.2 Decoding USF in downlink when having both 10 ms and 20 ms
TTIs
The issue investigated is if USF and Stealing Flags (SF) can still be used for
the different multiplexing possibilities deployed in downlink (i.e.
multiplexing of 10 ms and 20 ms TTIs). Tables 156 and 157 give an analysis and
solutions. Based on the analysis and solutions it can be concluded that there
is no real problems to multiplex different TTIs in downlink direction.
It should also be understood that legacy mobile stations cannot decode the
relevant SF and USF portions if the modulation method (GMSK or 8PSK) changes
from one 10 ms TTI to another during a 20 ms legacy block period so modulation
method in DL needs to remain the same within each such legacy block boundary.

#### **10.3.1.4 Introducing 2-burst radio block option**
One of the advantages of reducing the TTI by transmitting 4 bursts in parallel
onto 2 different timeslots is that legacy MCSs could be probably maintained,
although changes would anyway be needed to the header and the interleaving
scheme. Note that the assumption is that the header would be distributed
across the 2 timeslots in this case.
But for low bandwidth applications such as VoIP it makes sense to define
2-burst radio blocks, i.e. radio blocks with a TTI of 10 ms transmitted on a
single timeslot, as depicted in Figure 22. These radio blocks could be used in
case of higher quality over the radio interface. In this case, assuming that
such radio blocks could transport an IP packet (containing an AMR frame) every
20 ms, we could achieve a timeslot utilization of 50 %, also in case of
continuous voice transmission (i.e. without considering any form of DTX). The
spare bandwidth could be used by other TBFs, not necessarily carrying
Conversational Services.

Figure 317: Conventional and RTTI radio blocks
##### **10.3.1.5** Detailed proposal for a 5 ms TTI solution
The problem of a \"5 ms TTI\" solution is that it is apparently not possible
to have a symmetric solution (i.e. a solution which is valid for both the
downlink and the uplink) due to impossibility for (single-carrier) mobile
stations to receive and transmit on 4 timeslots in the same TDMA frame.
But receiving and transmitting a radio block in the same TDMA frame is not
strictly necessary to help reduce the latency. A solution that allows mobile
stations to alternate between receiving a radio block in a TDMA frame and then
transmitting a radio block in the subsequent TDMA frame would also yield
significant benefit.
This is possible as outlined in figure 318.
{width="6.715972222222222in" height="2.6326388888888888in"}
Figure 318: 5 ms TTI solution: transmission/reception in DL and UL
In the figure a DL radio block is sent in TDMA frame N, also containing the
USF to allow transmission in the next uplink TDMA frame (N+1). If the mobile
station needs to transmit in frame N+1 it might not be able (depending on MS
capabilities) to monitor all the needed DL timeslots in the same TDMA frame.
But we could easily specify that in this case (i.e. when the mobile station
needs to transmit in a given frame) the mobile station is not mandated to read
(all of) the DL timeslots in the same frame. This could be very similar to the
current rule for EDA.
Referring again to figure 318, since the mobile station cannot receive any USF
in the TDMA frame N+1, it will not transmit anything in the TDMA frame N+2 and
therefore will be allowed to receive a further DL radio block in the same
period, and so on.
The only constraint of this solution is that it will not be possible for both
the network and the mobile station to transmit radio blocks onto two
consecutive TDMA frames (this restriction is valid with currently available MS
capabilities, but can be overcome with dual-carrier configurations).
The overall effect is that, even if 4 timeslots are allocated to a given
mobile station in both directions, they can be used (if there is the need to
maintain the same bandwidth in UL and DL) only every other frame. Therefore,
the corresponding maximum throughput equals the one that can be achieved with
a 2 DL + 2 UL configuration. But the benefit would be in terms of reduced
latency.
Furthermore, even though the 4 allocated timeslots can only be used every
other frame for a given mobile station, other mobile stations in RTTI TBF mode
can be easily multiplexed on the same radio resources, thus reducing the risk
of radio inefficiencies.
Figure 319 shows the scheduling opportunities for 2 RTTI TBFs on the same
resources: the resources that cannot be used by a given TBF can be used by the
other one.
{width="2.922222222222222in" height="1.9229166666666666in"}
Figure 319: 5 ms TTI solution: Scheduling opportunities for 2 RTTI TBFs on the
same resources
The benefit of this approach in terms of latency reduction is evident when
deriving the corresponding RLC RTT.
Assuming that the \"MS reaction time\" (time between setting a polling
indication in the DL and sending a feedback information in the UL) could be
lower than one TDMA frame (as shown in Figure 23), the RLC RTT would result
in:
RLC RTT = BSC delay (10) + 2x Abis delay (5) + 2x BTS delay (\ blocks. In this case 2-burst RTTI radio blocks would be sent by > using just two timeslots in the same TDMA frame (and the > restriction to transmit every other frame could thus be > limited/avoided).
  * The rules regarding the stealing flags settings can be easily > adapted.
  * The rules regarding the USF scheduling can also be easily adapted.
#### 10.3.1.6 Coexistence of legacy and RTTI TBFs (including 4-burst and
2-burst options)
##### 10.3.1.6.1 Stealing Flags setting and decoding
For RTTI blocks transmitted with GMSK there is the need to specify how the MS
could distinguish them from GPRS Coding Schemes (CS1-4) and EGPRS ones
(MCS1-4), and in particular how the MS could distinguish between the 2‑burst
or 4-burst format of RTTI blocks.
The solution could reuse the same approach adopted when EGPRS was introduced:
for MCS1-4 all the \"legacy\" stealing flags are set to indicate CS4, while
four extra stealing flags (i.e. 1 per burst) are set to \'0,0,0,0\' to
identify MCS1-4 (see definition of q(8),q(9),...,q(11) in subclause 5.1.5.1.5
of TS 45.003). Anyway, a mobile station in EGPRS TBF mode will always assume
that MCS1-4 are used if \"legacy\" stealing flags indicating CS4 are detected.
Starting from the 2 following considerations:
1\. Legacy MSs assume that transmission of radio blocks is synchronized on a
20 ms TTI basis. This means that the basic \"time unit\" should remain 20 ms.
If an RTTI block is transmitted in the first 10 ms of a 20 ms time unit, then
another RTTI block must follow (and not a normal radio block, since it would
break the synchronization rule).
2\. Two RTTI blocks transmitted in the same time unit of 20 ms have to use the
same modulation (this is needed at least to allow legacy MSs to perform USF
decoding).
It is assumed that, if 2 consecutive RTTI blocks are sent in the same 20 ms
time unit using GMSK all the \"legacy\" stealing flags have to be set to
indicate CS4.
The following basic rule could therefore be defined:
  * When detecting the \"legacy\" stealing flags set to indicate CS4, a > mobile station in RTTI TBF mode will always assume that 2 > consecutive GMSK RTTI blocks are sent in the 20 ms time unit.
Additionally, the four extra stealing flags (i.e. q(8),q(9),...,q(11) in
subclause 5.1.5.1.5 of 3GPP TS 45.003) could be set to discriminate between
\"4-burst RTTI blocks\" (extra stealing flags set to \'0\') and \"2-burst RTTI
blocks\" (extra stealing flags set to \'1\').
To decrease the risk of erroneous detection, 4 additional \"RTTI-type\"
stealing flags are defined, one per burst in the 20 ms time unit, as shown in
figure 320.
{width="5.377083333333333in" height="1.9569444444444444in"}
Figure 320: burst format for RTTI blocks.
The four additional \"RTTI-type\" stealing flags could be set to the same
value as the extra stealing flags to discriminate between \"4-burst RTTI
blocks\" (\"RTTI-type\" stealing flags set to \'0\') and \"2-burst RTTI
blocks\" (\"RTTI-type\" stealing flags set to \'1\').
The overall rule that a mobile station in RTTI TBF mode should follow to
detect different types of radio blocks would be then the following:
  * **A MS in RTTI TBF mode will identify a block as a \"GMSK 2-burst > RTTI block\" (after 10 ms, as required) by detecting:**
\- **(part of) the \"legacy\" stealing flags set to indicate CS4** :
  * For the first RTTI block in the 20 ms time unit, the MS would have > to discriminate between \'0,0,0,1\' (first 4 stealing flags to > indicate CS4) and the other initial 4-bit configurations to > indicate CS1/CS2/CS3.
  * For the second RTTI block in the 20 ms time unit, the MS could use > all the stealing flags in the 20 ms time unit, i.e. it could > discriminate between \'0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0\' (stealing flags to > indicate CS4) and the other stealing flags settings indicating > CS1/CS2/CS3.
\- **_plus 4 stealing flags set to \'1\'_ , i.e.**:
  * 2 extra stealing flags (those that can be read in the 10 ms time > unit); plus
  * 2 additional \"RTTI-type\" stealing flags (those that can be read in > the 10 ms time unit).
  * **Similarly, a MS in RTTI TBF mode will identify a block as a \"GMSK > 4-burst RTTI block\" (after 10 ms, as required) by detecting:**
\- **(part of) the \"legacy\" stealing flags set to indicate CS4** (as
described above);
\- **_plus 8 stealing flags set to \'0\'_ , i.e.**:
  * 4 extra stealing flags (the 2 that can be read in the 10 ms time > unit on a given timeslot and the 2 on the subsequently allocated > one); plus
  * 4 additional \"RTTI-type\" stealing flags (the 2 that can be read in > the 10 ms time unit on a given timeslot and the 2 on the > subsequently allocated one).
  * **In any case a MS in RTTI TBF mode will be able to read a CS1-coded > block (after 20 ms) by detecting the \"legacy\" stealing flags set > to indicate CS1.**
This is needed to allow a mobile station to read distribution messages (CS1
coded).
The behaviour of a mobile station depending on the setting of legacy, extra
and newly introduced \"RTTI-type\" stealing flags is summarized in table 159,
according to the specific TBF mode.

Regarding 8-PSK modulation, it can be assumed that when 8-PSK RTTI blocks are
sent, the legacy stealing flags are set to one of the currently defined values
- i.e. \'0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\' (indicating MCS5 and 6) or \'1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1\'
(indicating MCS7, 8 and 9). This would indicate the USF positions for a legacy
MS (and also for a MS in RTTI TBF mode).
The first basic rule for 8-PSK modulated blocks would be the following:
  * **When detecting the legacy stealing flags set to indicate MCS5 &6 or > MCS7,8&9, a mobile station in RTTI TBF mode will always assume > that 2 consecutive 8-PSK RTTI blocks are sent in the 20 ms time > unit.**
However, \"extra\" stealing flags are not defined for MCS5-9. Hence, we can
define a whole set of 8 \"RTTI-type\" stealing flags for 8-PSK RTTI blocks, to
discriminate between \"8-PSK 4-burst RTTI blocks\" (\"RTTI-type\" stealing
flags set to \'0\') and \"8-PSK 2-burst RTTI blocks\" (\"RTTI-type\" stealing
flags set to \'1\').
The overall rule that a mobile station in RTTI TBF mode should follow to
detect different types of 8-PSK modulated radio blocks would be then the
following:
  * **A MS in RTTI TBF mode will identify a block as a \"8-PSK 2-burst > RTTI block\" (after 10 ms, as required) by detecting:**
\- **(part of) the \"legacy\" stealing flags set to indicate MCS5 &6 or
MCS7,8&9**:
  * For the first RTTI block in the 20 ms time unit, the MS would have > to discriminate between \'0,0,0,0\' (first 4 stealing flags to > indicate MCS5&6) and the other initial 4-bit configurations to > indicate MCS7,8&9, i.e. \'1,1,1,0\'.
  * For the second RTTI block in the 20 ms time unit, the MS could use > all the stealing flags in the 20 ms time unit, i.e. it could > discriminate between \'0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\' (stealing flags to > indicate MCS5&6) and the other stealing flags settings indicating > MCS7,8&9, i.e. \'1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1\'.
\- **_plus 4 additional \"RTTI-type\" stealing flags set to \'1\'_** (the four
that can be read in the 10 ms time unit)
  * **Similarly, a MS in RTTI TBF mode will identify a block as a > \"8-PSK 4-burst RTTI block\" (after 10 ms, as required) by > detecting:**
\- **(part of) the \"legacy\" stealing flags set to indicate MCS5 &6 or
MCS7,8&9** (as described above).
\- **_plus 8 additional \"RTTI-type\" stealing flags set to \'0\'_** (the four
that can be read in the 10 ms time unit on a given timeslot and the four on
the subsequently allocated one).
The description above refers to the MS behaviour for downlink transmission. In
case of uplink transmission, the behaviour of the receiver in network would be
similar (the network has more information though, since it controls the UL
transmission via the USF scheduling).
##### 10.3.1.6.2 USF setting and decoding
NOTE: This subclause addresses the issue handled in subclause above, but when
the 2-burst radio blocks option is considered.
Another problem to solve is to allow legacy USF decoding (which needs 20 ms),
in conjunction with fast (10ms) USF scheduling for RTTI TBFs.
The solution could be to have both a normal USF (read also by legacy MSs) plus
2 \"10 ms USFs\" (read only by MSs in RTTI TBF mode) defined in the 20 ms time
unit on a given timeslot. Clearly, if the normal USF is set to a valid value,
the 2 \"10 ms USFs\" will have to be set to an undefined value, and vice
versa.
Note that the assumption here is that the \"10 ms USFs\" is defined per
timeslot, regardless of the 2-burst or 4-burst RTTI block format of the DL
RTTI block containing it.
  * If a MS in RTTI TBF mode reads the corresponding \"10 ms USFs\" on a > given timeslot it will be allowed to send a \"2-burst RTTI > blocks\" on the corresponding timeslot.
  * If a MS in RTTI TBF mode reads the corresponding \"10 ms USFs\" on a > given timeslot and also on the subsequently allocated one, it will > be allowed to send either a \"4-burst RTTI blocks\", or 2 > different \"2-burst RTTI blocks\" on the two timeslots.
Furthermore, a normal USF could be assigned to an RTTI TBF as well. This would
allow to transmit legacy blocks in the DL (with legacy USF), but still
schedule RTTI blocks in the UL:
  * If a MS in RTTI TBF mode reads the corresponding normal USF in a > legacy downlink radio block on a given timeslot, it will be > allowed to send 2 consecutive \"2-burst RTTI blocks\" on the > corresponding timeslot.
  * If a MS in RTTI TBF mode reads the corresponding normal USF in 2 > legacy downlink radio blocks transmitted on a given timeslot and > on the subsequently allocated one, in addition to the options > above it will be also allowed to send 2 consecutive \"4-burst RTTI > blocks\".
It has to be noticed that the \"10 ms USF\" would anyway refer to a point in
time 20 ms ahead (not 10), to allow multiplexing with legacy MSs. This is
shown in figure 321. The benefit of the proposal would be mainly in the higher
scheduling flexibility.
{width="5.940277777777778in" height="1.7652777777777777in"}
Figure 321: USF scheduling in case of multiplexing with legacy TBFs
Things would change if multiplexing with legacy MSs were not required. In this
case it is not necessary to maintain the normal USF (to be read in 20 ms) and
RTTI blocks could just carry 1 or 2 \"10 ms USF\" (1 in case of \"2-burst
format\", 2 in case of \"4-burst format\"). In this case the USF would refer
to a point in time 10 ms ahead allowing a further 10 ms reduction in latency.
This is shown in figure 322.

Figure 322: USF scheduling in case of no multiplexing with legacy TBFs
A further proposal is therefore to allow the possibility to define, in the
RTTI TBF establishment phase, whether the \"10 ms USF\" has to be considered
as a pointer to 20 ms ahead (scenario where multiplexing with legacy MSs is
needed) or as a pointer to 10 ms ahead (scenario where multiplexing with
legacy MSs is not needed).
#### 10.3.1.7 Coexistence of legacy and RTTI TBFs (simplified RTTI solution)
The introduction of all the options in 10.3.1.6 would increase the complexity
of the RTTI proposal:
  * The 5 ms TTI solution would imply a 4 DL + 4 UL timeslots capable > mobile station (although it would not be required to transmit AND > receive on 4 timeslots during the same TDMA frame, see [6]). > Furthermore the 5 ms TTI option would be hardly compatible with a > DTM configuration.
  * The introduction of the 2-burst radio block option would lead to the > definition of:
\- completely new modulation and coding schemes;
\- the need to introduce additional stealing flags to signal the new radio
block formats, see [7];
\- the need to add additional USF fields in a DL RTTI block, see [7].
In the following we assume that only the \"4-bursts radio blocks with 10 ms
TTI\" option is supported. As has already described this can be achieved by
transmitting 4 bursts in parallel onto 2 different timeslots.
The basic advantage of this approach is that legacy MCSs can be maintained,
apart from the interleaving scheme. If the RTTI solution is combined with the
Fast Ack/Nack Reporting proposal, some modifications will anyway be needed to
the payload coding, in case where an RLC data block needs to contain a short
bitmap.
In any case no additional stealing flags would have to be defined, nor
additional USF fields in DL RTTI blocks, as described in the following.
##### 10.3.1.7.1 The Stealing Flags problem
For RTTI blocks transmitted with GMSK there is the need to specify how the MS
could distinguish them from GPRS Coding Schemes (CS1-4) and EGPRS ones
(MCS1-4).
The solution is simple and reuses the same approach adopted when EGPRS was
introduced: for MCS1-4 all the legacy stealing flags are set to indicate CS4,
while four extra stealing flags (i.e. 1 per burst) are set to \'0,0,0,0\' to
identify MCS1-4 (see definition of q(8),q(9),...,q(11) in subclause 5.1.5.1.5
of 3GPP TS 45.003). Anyway, a mobile station in EGPRS TBF mode will always
assume that MCS1-4 are used if legacy stealing flags indicating CS4 are
detected.
Starting from the 3 following considerations:
1\. Legacy MSs assume that transmission of radio blocks is synchronized on a
20 ms TTI basis. This means that the basic \"time unit\" should remain 20 ms.
If an RTTI block is transmitted in the first 10 ms of a 20 ms time unit, then
another RTTI block must follow (and not a normal radio block, since it would
break the synchronization rule).
2\. Two RTTI blocks transmitted in the same time unit of 20 ms have to use the
same modulation (this is needed at least to allow legacy MSs to perform USF
decoding).
3\. A MS in RTTI TBF mode doesn\'t have to distinguish between EGPRS MCSs and
RTTI MCSs on the same resources.
We can assume that, if 2 consecutive RTTI blocks are sent in the same 20 ms
time unit using GMSK all the legacy stealing flags - on both timeslots - have
to be set to indicate CS4 (while the four extra stealing could be set again to
\'0\', see note).
NOTE. This is possible considering the assumption 3 above.
Correspondingly, in case of GMSK modulation, a MS in RTTI TBF mode will only
have to distinguish between two different cases:
  * **A MS in RTTI TBF mode will identify a block as a \"GMSK RTTI > block\" (after 10 ms, as required) by detecting (part of) the > legacy stealing flags set to indicate CS4:**
\- For the first RTTI block in the 20 ms time unit, the MS would have to
discriminate between \'0,0,0,1\' (first 4 stealing flags to indicate CS4) and
the other initial 4-bit configurations to indicate CS1/CS2/CS3 (on both
timeslots).
\- For the second RTTI block in the 20 ms time unit, the MS could use all the
stealing flags in the 20 ms time unit, i.e. it could discriminate between
\'0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0\' (stealing flags to indicate CS4) and the other stealing
flags settings indicating CS1/CS2/CS3 (on both timeslots).
  * **A MS in RTTI TBF mode will be able to read a CS1-coded block > (after 20 ms) by detecting the legacy stealing flags set to > indicate CS1:**
\- This is needed to allow a mobile station to read distribution messages (CS1
coded).
The behaviour of a mobile station depending on the setting of the stealing
flags is summarized in the table below, according to the specific TBF mode.
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Type of | Stealing | Behaviour | | | | transmitted | flag | of the MS | | | | block | settings | according | | | | | | to the | | | | | | specific | | | | | | TBF mode | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | | | GPRS TBF | EGPRS TBF | RTTI TBF | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | CS1 block | Legacy | CS1 | CS1 | CS1 | | | stealing | decoding | decoding | decoding | | | flags set | | | | | | to CS1 | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | CS2-3 block | Legacy | CS2-3 | No decoding | No | | | stealing | decoding | | | | | flags set | | | decoding | | | to CS2-3 | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | CS4 block | Legacy | CS4 | MCS1-4 | \"GMSK RTTI | | | stealing | decoding | decoding | block\" | | | flags set | | | decoding | | | to CS4 | | [decoding | | | | | | will fail] | [decoding | | | | | | will fail] | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | MCS1-4 | Legacy | CS4 | MCS1-4 | \"GMSK RTTI | | block | stealing | decoding | decoding | block\" | | | flags set | | | decoding | | | to CS4 | [decoding | | | | | | will fail] | | [decoding | | | Extra | | | will fail] | | | stealing | | | | | | flags set | | | | | | to | | | | | | \'0,0,0,0\' | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | GMSK RTTI | Legacy | CS4 | MCS1-4 | \"GMSK RTTI | | block | stealing | decoding | decoding | block\" | | | flags set | | | decoding | | | to CS4 | [decoding | [decoding | | | | | will fail] | will fail] | (after 10 | | | Extra | | | ms) | | | stealing | | | | | | flags set | | | | | | to | | | | | | \'0,0,0,0\' | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
This shows that the behaviour of a mobile station in RTTI TBF mode is the same
with respect to a mobile station in EGPRS TBF mode (i.e. the same complexity
is expected).
Regarding 8-PSK modulation, we can assume that when 8-PSK RTTI blocks are
sent, the legacy stealing flags are set to one of the currently defined values
- i.e. \'0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\' (indicating MCS5/6) or \'1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1\'
(indicating MCS7/8/9). This would indicate the USF positions for a legacy MS
(and also for a MS in RTTI TBF mode).
Correspondingly, in case of 8-PSK modulation, a MS in RTTI TBF mode will only
have to distinguish between two different cases:
  * A MS in RTTI TBF mode will identify a block as a \"MCS5/6 RTTI > block\" (after 10 ms, as required) by detecting (part of) the > legacy stealing flags set to indicate MCS5/6.
  * Alternatively, a MS in RTTI TBF mode will identify a block as a > \"MCS7/8/9 RTTI block\" (after 10 ms, as required) by detecting > (part of) the legacy stealing flags set to indicate MCS7/8/9.
NOTE 1: For the first RTTI block in the 20 ms time unit, the MS would have to
discriminate between \'0,0,0,0\' (first 4 stealing flags to indicate MCS5&6)
and the other initial 4-bit configurations to indicate MCS7,8&9, i.e.
\'1,1,1,0\' (on both timeslots).
NOTE 2: For the second RTTI block in the 20 ms time unit, the MS could use all
the stealing flags in the 20 ms time unit, i.e. it could discriminate between
\'0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\' (stealing flags to indicate MCS5&6) and the other stealing
flags settings indicating MCS7,8&9, i.e. \'1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1\' (on both
timeslots).
The description above refers to the MS behaviour for downlink transmission. In
case of uplink transmission, the behaviour of the receiver in network would be
similar (the network has more information though, since it controls the UL
transmission via the USF scheduling).
##### 10.3.1.7.2 The USF decoding problem
Another problem to solve is to allow legacy USF decoding (which needs 20 ms),
in conjunction with the need to schedule RTTI blocks in the UL every 10 ms.
A simple solution - already included in the Feasibility Study on GERAN
Evolution - is to specify that MS in RTTI TBF mode will read:
  * the USF allowing UL transmission in the first 10 ms of the next 20 > ms time unit during 4 TDMA frames (i.e. legacy USF decoding) on > the first allocated DL timeslot;
  * the USF allowing UL transmission in the second 10 ms of the next 20 > ms time unit during 4 TDMA frames (i.e. legacy USF decoding) on > the second allocated DL timeslot.
With this proposal a MS in RTTI TBF mode would have to wait 20 ms to read the
2 USFs on the 2 allocated DL timeslots, so the USF would anyway refer to a
point in time 20 ms ahead (not 10). This would not necessarily impact the RLC
RTT (i.e. the time to perform an RLC retransmission) and would only slightly
impact the upper layer RTT (e.g. the ping delay). In any case full
interworking with legacy TBFs and full UL scheduling flexibility for RTTI
blocks would be guaranteed.
The USF decoding procedure could be further optimized in case multiplexing
with legacy TBFs is not required.
In this case it is not necessary to maintain the legacy USF decoding (i.e. USF
to be read in 20 ms). Instead, the USF could be coded using the same 4 bursts
used for a DL RTTI block (i.e. 4 bursts transmitted in parallel onto 2
different timeslots in 10 ms).
In this case a MS in RTTI TBF mode will read the USF allowing UL transmission
in the next 10 ms time unit during 10 ms on 2 different DL timeslots. The USF
would therefore refer to a point in time 10 ms ahead allowing a further 10 ms
reduction in the upper layer RTT (e.g. the ping delay).
NOTE: Another possible improvement, in case multiplexing with legacy TBFs is
not required, is the possibility to change modulation in DL every 10 ms,
further increasing the DL scheduling flexibility.
In both cases (i.e. where multiplexing with legacy TBFs is / is not required)
the structure of the DL RTTI blocks would be the same. Only the way the USF is
interleaved would change (during 20 ms on a single timeslot OR during 10 ms on
2 different timeslots). Considering this, it is possible to define in the RTTI
TBF establishment phase whether the USF has to be read per timeslot in 20 ms
(scenario where multiplexing with legacy TBFs is needed) or in 10 ms on 2
different timeslots (scenario where multiplexing with legacy TBFs is not
needed).
### 10.3.2 Link level performance
#### **10.3.2.1 Modelling Assumptions and Requirements**
The following EGPRS services have been simulated for the timeslot mapping
option; MCS-1, MCS-4, MCS-5 and MCS-9. Each simulation point has been run with
10 000 radio blocks (40 000 bursts).
**Simulated radio scenarios:**
  * Sensitivity: TU50iFH.
  * Co-channel interference: TU3iFH and TU3noFH.
**Other simulator settings:**
  * Blind detection of modulation was used.
  * RX impairments typical to a base transceiver station were used.
  * Uplink direction.
  * No antenna diversity.
  * When multiple time-slots are used in a TDMA frame, they are adjacent > in time.
  * When multiple frequencies are used, they are separated in frequency > to give independent multi-path fading.
#### 10.3.2.2 Performance Characterization
The link level performance for case i, ii, iii and iv (as described in
subclause 10.3.2.1) is summarised in tables 160 and 161. Reference performance
with the regular radio block mapping is also shown. Detailed results can be
found in Annex A. BLER means the total BLER, i.e. both header BLER and data
BLER are considered. A \'-\' means the case has not been simulated. Note:
different IP packet sizes (different types of services) could be considered
further.

* * *
The following observations of the performance relative to the regular radio
block mapping can be made:
  * Radio block mapping in time-slot domain:
\- With ideal frequency hopping, performance is degraded by up to 3.5 dB for
MCS-1 and MCS-5 since they have strong channel coding and frequency diversity
is reduced, whereas performance is improved by up to 1.7 dB for MCS-4 and
MCS-9 since they have no channel coding.
  * Radio block mapping in frequency domain:
\- With ideal frequency hopping, performance is unchanged for all MCS:s since
frequency diversity is maintained.
\- Without frequency hopping, case iv has the same performance as with ideal
frequency hopping since interleaving is done over four frequencies.
#### 10.3.2.3 Conversational services with reduced TTI
##### 10.3.2.3.1 Introduction
This subclause aims at evaluating some worst case scenarios compared to
TU3iFH. From the link level results some conclusions are drawn on the effects
on application level.
The losses at more severe radio conditions are relevant regardless of the
service. However, for other services than VoIP, the reference is legacy EGPRS,
for which the losses will be the same as with reduced TTI. Therefore, the
relative latency gains will be approximately the same regardless of the speed
and channel profile. For VoIP, on the other hand, the latency gain relative to
legacy EGPRS is not the main interest; instead it is necessary to fulfil an
absolute latency requirement with sufficient coverage. The reference for VoIP
is rather circuit switched speech. Therefore, this contribution focuses at
VoIP, and consequently the performance loss after one retransmission is of
interest (recall that it is possible to send one retransmission within the
delay budget with a TTI of 10 ms).
##### 10.3.2.3.2 Application Level Effects
In the previous Ericsson contributions a reduced transmission time interval
(RTTI) of 10 ms was evaluated where the reduction in transmission time was
achieved in the downlink by dual carrier and in the uplink by dual time slot
transmission. Therefore, the link level simulations in this contribution have
both been evaluated with the conventional radio block format, i.e. a radio
block is transmitted on one time slot in four consecutive TDMA frames, but
also with a dual time slot format where two time slots are used in two
consecutive TDMA frames. These two alternatives are referred to as radio block
format 1 and 2 respectively. The performance of the dual carrier scheme will
be identical to radio block format 1 if ideal frequency hopping is utilized.
Previously it has been shown that the worse radio conditions experienced by
the terminal the harder it is to fulfil the latency requirements of the chosen
service, see ‎[8]. Thus, the performance losses or gains are evaluated at the
cell border where a C/I of 9 dB is assumed. The performance measure is
loss/gain in coverage compared to TU3iFH.
At present time no protocol level simulations have been conducted to verify
the effects on the application layer. Thus, only preliminary conclusions can
be made.
##### 10.3.2.3.3 Simulator settings
A state-of-the art link level simulator has been used for the evaluation of
the different channel models. The parameter settings are shown in table 162.
Thus, the frequency band is kept at 900 MHz for all simulations. However,
since RA250noFH is simulated, the faster fading experienced at higher
frequency bands is assumed to be somewhat covered.
NOTE. RA250 at 800/900 MHz is replaced by RA130 at 1800/1900 MHz in the
receiver performance requirements in 3GPP TS 45.005. Therefore, this is the
channel with the maximum Doppler frequency.

The simulations have been conducted with incremental redundancy, IR. For the
cases where there is no frequency hopping between the bursts within a radio
block, there is a delay between the different IR transmissions to account for
the time it takes for the control signalling (the round-trip time). This time
has been chosen to be 70 ms and 120 ms for 10 ms and 20 ms TTI respectively.
##### 10.3.2.3.4 Simulation results
Simulations have been performed on different channel profiles with different
speeds depending on the channel used. For the evaluation of each channel
model, TU3iFH is used as reference.
**RA250noFH**
In figure 323 the performance of MCS-2 on Rural Area channel at terminal speed
250 km/h is shown when radio block format 1 is used (conventional radio block
transmission).
{width="4.395138888888889in" height="3.1486111111111112in"}
Figure 323: Link performance of MCS-2 for TU3iFH and RA250noFH\ when
incremental redundancy and radio block format 1 is used
It is seen that the coverage loss at the cell border could be expected to be
at the most 1.2 dB for the first IR retransmission. In the first transmission
the loss is approximately 0.7 dB. Also MCS-1 and MCS-5 has been evaluated, see
table 163.
Figure 324 shows the corresponding plots when radio block format 2 has been
used. It is seen that the loss is somewhat larger than for radio block format
1 with a coverage loss of 1 dB in the first transmission and 1.3 dB in the
second transmission.
{width="4.395138888888889in" height="3.1486111111111112in"}
Figure 324: Link performance of MCS-2 for TU3iFH and RA250noFH\ when
incremental redundancy and radio block format 2 is used
Thus, it seems that the RA250noFH channel model degrades the performance of
coded MCSs compared to TU3iFH, which was expected. The performance loss is at
the most 1.3 dB for MCS-2 using radio block format 2 in the first IR
retransmission. However, for the most coded MCSs, MCS-1 and MCS-5, the
degradation is not as large probably since the time diversity from the high
speed can be used. Note that according to GP-060753 and G2-060186, the end-to-
end latency requirement is fulfilled with minimised resource utilisation with
MCS-5 at 9 dB C/I on a TU3iFH channel. Therefore, with MCS-5 it will also be
fulfilled on a RA250noFH channel, but at 9.3 dB C/I.
The results are summarized in table 163.

NOTE. The coverage loss has been measured given a BLER for TU3iFH @ C/I=9 dB
It is seen that the losses are larger than for RA250noFH but the difference in
loss between the first and second transmission is approximately the same. For
this channel model the loss is largest for MCS-5 with a loss of, at the most,
2.8 dB. This could be explained by Hilly Terrain having a larger time
dispersion than Typical Urban. Since the 8-PSK equalizer has fewer taps than
the GMSK-equalizer it is more susceptible to Inter Symbol Interference, ISI.
According to GP-060753 and G2-060186, the end-to-end latency requirement is
fulfilled with MCS-2 at 9 dB C/I on a TU3iFH channel. Therefore, with MCS-2 it
will also be fulfilled on a RA250noFH channel, but at 11.1 dB C/I.
#### 10.3.2.4 Reduced TTI and fast ACK/NACK
##### 10.3.2.4.1 Definition of the new coding schemes
New RTTI coding schemes are defined as shown in table 165.
Table 165: Definition of new coding schemes
|  | RTTI 2 w/o bitmap | RTTI 2 w/ bitmap | RTTI 3 w/o bitmap | RTTI 3 w/ bitmap | RTTI 5 w/o bitmap | RTTI 5 w/ bitmap | RTTI 6 w/o bitmap | RTTI 6 w/ bitmap

Total |  | 464 | 464 | 464 | 464 | 1 392 | 13 92 | 1 392 | **1 392**  
**The Header coding is kept unchanged:** The bitmap is independently coded (with a 6 bit CRC). Data has 12 bit CRC. USF bits are included in the header (the coding of USF is unchanged). Over head refers to stealing flags (and extra stealing flags in case of MCS 1-4). The coding of the data for RTTI-MCS 2 and RTTI-MCS 3 with bitmap is slightly less robust than the corresponding coding schemes without bitmap. The coding of the data for RTTI-MCS 5 and RTTI-MCS 6 with bitmap is slightly more robust than the corresponding coding schemes without bitmap. The coding schemes for RTTI MCS schemes without bitmap is kept exactly same as the current MCS schemes (Only the burst mapping changes to allow RTTI option). |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
The new (RTTI 5 and RTTI 6) coding schemes are defined in such a way that
there is always a possibility of retransmission using RTTI 2 and RTTI 3 coding
schemes respectively, should link adaptation change the coding scheme by the
time of retransmission.
##### 10.3.2.4.2 Header coding
The coding of the header is kept unchanged. Only the burst mapping changes in
order to allow reduced TTI operation. In other words, the header bits are
mapped on to four bursts and the first two bursts are transmitted in the same
TDMA frame in a multislot transmission and the other two bursts are
transmitted in the next TDMA frame. The process is illustrated in figure 325.

Figure 325: Reduced TTI burst mapping
##### 10.3.2.4.3 Bitmap coding
A constant number of bits (20) per block are assumed as the payload size of
the bitmap. The coding of the bitmap is done independently.
##### 10.3.2.4.4 Block code
A 6 bit CRC is added to the 20 bitmap bits. The method used for generating the
CRC bits of TCH/AFS logical channels is reused for this purpose. The result is
a block of 26 bits.
##### 10.3.2.4.5 Convolutional code
Tail biting convolutional code of 1/3 rate is used to encode the resultant 26
bits (from the block coding mentioned above) the code polynomials used for
MCS-1 header coding are used for this purpose. The result is a block of 78
bits.
##### 10.3.2.4.6 Puncturing
For RTTI 2 and RTTI 3 type logical channels, the convolutionally coded bitmap
data bits are punctured from 78 bits to 54 bits. A pseudo random uniform
puncturing pattern is used for this purpose.
##### 10.3.2.4.7 Interleaving and burst mapping
The bitmap is interleaved as if it is part of data. The method is described in
figure 326.
{width="4.1930555555555555in" height="3.0722222222222224in"}
Figure 326: Interleaving of RTTI type data
##### 10.3.2.4.8 Data coding
The size of the payload for each RTTI scheme is as shown in table 165. The
basic coding scheme of the data is kept unchanged. (i.e. block coding,
convolutional coding etc). However the algorithms operate on blocks of
different sizes. The puncturing is done again using a pseudo random uniform
puncturing pattern. The interleaving and burst mapping is done as specified in
subclause 10.3.2.4.7.
##### 10.3.2.4.9 Simulation results
Simulations are done for RTTI 3 and RTTI 6 type coding schemes for TU3 and TU
50 ideal frequency hopping channels for low band (GSM 800) and also for TU 50
in upper band (GSM 1800/1900). The results are shown in this subclause. The
RTTI type coding schemes are assumed to always have the bitmap for first and
second transmissions. A comparison is made against standard MCS schemes as
defined currently. The idea is to have an insight of the performance achieved
by the new coding schemes and the loss in the performance due to loss of
frequency diversity.

### 10.3.3 Application performance
This subclause makes an evaluation of five traffic cases with use of a
simulator:
1\. End-to-end latency with Ping.
2\. Conversational service over packet data (VoIP).
3\. E-mail receiving and sending, using POP3 and SMTP respectively.
4\. E-mail synchronization, using IMAP.
5\. Web page download, using HTTP/1.1 without Pipelining.
The Ping analysis could be seen as a background to any further discussions
whether a Reduced TTI has any potential to give gains to end-user services or
not.
The analysis is made for single-user cases as well as for multiplexing of
users in multiple-user cases. The RTT mode used is \"active RTT\", which means
that TBF setup procedures are not considered.
#### 10.3.3.1 Modelling Assumptions and Requirements
Table 166 gives the simulation assumptions. Any further assumptions are
defined in direct relation to the results in next subclause.

Different Ack/Nack (RRBP) polling strategies were applied for VoIP compared to
the other traffic cases. In case of VoIP a frequent polling strategy was
applied, whereas a relaxed frequency was applied for the other traffic cases.
#### **10.3.3.2 Performance Characterization**
##### 10.3.3.2.1 Single-user cases
##### 10.3.3.2.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-19 .H6}
Single-user cases have been analysed with simulations for Ping, VoIP and
e-mail sending and receiving. Single-user means, in this context, that there
is only one mobile reserved per packet channel. Thus, more users can be served
by one base station or cell (and even TRX) and the results in this subclause
are still applicable.
The mobile is reserved with 4 timeslots downlink and 4 timeslots uplink in all
scenarios for a fair comparison. For the VoIP cases, this is applicable to
both the talker and the listener. For the RTTI cases, Dual-carrier is used in
the downlink, whereas Dual-timeslot is used in the uplink to achieve the 10ms
TTI. Thus a two TDMA frame interleaving scheme is applicable. The only used
Ack/Nack enhancement is a shorter RRBP. Neither event based Ack/Nack nor
piggy-backing of Ack/Nacks are included in the simulations. RLC/MAC control
signalling is transmitted with the same TTI as the data blocks. Since the RTT
mode is \"Active RTT\", only non-distribution RLC/MAC control signalling is
applicable.
##### 10.3.3.2.1.2 Ping {#ping .H6}
End-to-end latency is typically benchmarked with a Ping traffic case. The
default Ping size is 32 bytes which typically ends up with 70 bytes of RLC
data: 32 bytes ICMP payload, 8 bytes ICMP header, 20 bytes IP header and 10
bytes LLC/SNDCP header. 70 bytes is valid both for request and response. The
simulations performed uses 70 bytes as RLC data payload in uplink as well as
downlink, and the Pings are sent back-to-back.
The simulation parameters used in the Ping simulations are listed in table
166.
The results from the simulations are summarized in table 167.

An e-mail service is analysed in this subclause. The scenarios analysed are
sending of an e-mail using the SMTP protocol and reception of an e-mail using
the POP3 protocol.

##### 10.3.3.2.1.4.3 E-mail synchronization using IMAP {#e-mail-
synchronization-using-imap .H6}
The scenario analyzed is a synchronization of an e-mail inbox using the IMAP
protocol. The e-mail account consists of a number of folders, where only the
Inbox is synchronized. The scenario starts with the e-mail client already
running and when establishing a TCP connection. Then the e-mail client
performs a login to the e-mail account. The scenario ends when all headers are
downloaded and displayed in the e-mail client. Only the headers and flags
(indicating \"read\"/\"answered\" etc) of the e-mails are downloaded. A flow-
graph of a typical IMAP scenario is described in annex B.
Two Inbox scenarios are simulated, first where the Inbox consists of 100
e-mails where 27 of them are new since the last synchronization. Secondly,
where the Inbox consists of 20 e-mails where 5 of them are new.
The results, expressed as session time, from the simulations are summarized in
tables 174 and 175.

##### 10.3.3.2.1.5 Web service {#web-service .H6}
A large web page, consisting of 53 objects and 289 kbytes in total, was used
in this analysis. HTTP/1.1 without Pipelining, as used for example by
Microsoft Internet Explorer, was used for the analysis. Two parallel TCP
connections are used to download the objects.
The results, expressed as session time, from the simulations are summarized in
the table below. It should be noted that in a use case where the end-user uses
links from a page to another page, the gain in seconds is applicable to all
web pages. The gain in seconds is thus applicable to each move to a new page
and can be very large in the end. As an example of 5 equally large web pages,
the total gain in seconds would be 5*10=50 seconds (C/I 9dB).

##### 10.3.3.2.2 Multiple-user cases
##### 10.3.3.2.2.1 Introduction {#introduction-20 .H6}
Multiple-user cases have been analysed with simulations for Ping, VoIP and Web
download. Multiple-user means, in this context, that there is more than one
mobile reserved per packet channel. Thus, the results in this subclause are
applicable when packet channel sharing applies. The purposes with the multi-
user cases are to analyse the multiplexing delays introduced from scheduling
and the possible resource segregation from multiplexing different users on the
same packet channels.
Time-slot reservation in the multiple-user cases are done so that there are
two mobiles reserved on each packet channel, where one of them is the
reference mobile. The reference mobile(s) is the mobile(s) for which end-user
performance is measured and presented. Thus, a packet channel sharing of 2
applies for all used packet channels throughout the sessions. The reference
mobile(s) has a 4+4 reservation, as in the single user cases. For the legacy
case, this thus assumes a type 2 mobile. For the VoIP cases, there are two
reference mobiles, since the results are presented in mouth-to-ear delay for a
mobile-to-mobile conversation. The same time-slot reservation principle apply,
i.e. two mobiles reserved on each packet channel, where one of them is the
reference mobile. The two reference mobiles are not multiplexed on the same
packet channels.
For the RTTI cases, Dual-carrier is used in the downlink, whereas Dual-
timeslot is used in the uplink to achieve the 10 ms TTI. Thus a two TDMA frame
interleaving scheme is applicable. The only used Ack/Nack enhancement is a
shorter RRBP. Neither event based Ack/Nack nor piggy-backing of Ack/Nacks are
included in the simulations. RLC/MAC control signalling is transmitted with
the same TTI as the data blocks.
MAC scheduling principles applied are of course important and might differ
between implementations. In this context two scheduling principles are
applicable: \"round-robin\" and \"QoS-based\". \"Round-robin\" means that the
mobiles get an equal share of the packet channels\' bandwidth. \"QoS-based\"
means that the priority (relative or absolute) between mobiles are applied in
MAC scheduling, which means, higher priority mobiles will get a higher share
of the packet channels\' bandwidth than lower priority mobiles. For
simplicity, only one packet flow per mobile is applied.
Three different multiple-user cases are analysed:
a) Reference mobile(s): 10ms TTI, Other mobiles: 20ms TTI.
b) Reference mobile(s): 10ms TTI, Other mobiles: 10ms TTI.
c) Reference mobile(s): 20ms TTI, Other mobiles: 20ms TTI.
Case c) is considered the reference case, where case a) and b) shall be
compared to.
NOTE: All the multiplexed users use the same Abis transmission time, for a
fair comparison. That is, 10 ms Abis is used for case a and b and 20ms Abis is
used for case c.
Multiplexing loss, used in the following chapters, is defined as how much of
the timeslots that can not be utilised due to scheduling constraints, even
though any transmitter has data buffered for transmitting.
##### 10.3.3.2.2.2 Ping {#ping-1 .H6}
The same Ping case is used as described in subclause 10.3.3.2.1.2. The
reference mobile is performing Pings, whereas the other mobiles perform a
constant UDP flow in both UL and DL. A \"round-robin\" MAC scheduling is
applied to all mobiles, which means that all mobiles have the same priority.
The simulation parameters used in the Ping simulations are listed in table
166. Note that table 166 only shows the single-user delays. Any additional
delay from multiplexing and USF scheduling is fully considered in the
simulator.
The results from the simulations are summarized in table 177. The A, B and C
cases are described in subclause 10.3.3.2.2.1.
**Table** 177**:** Results for the multiple-user Ping simulations
(milliseconds)
| **MCS-5** | **MCS-6** | **MCS-7** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| **Min** | **Median** | **Ave** | **95 th ** | **Multiplexing Loss** | ** large e-mails (5 + 100 kbytes).
  * POP3: 30 % to 38 % for small e-mails and 21 % to 24 % for large > e-mails.
  * IMAP: 30 % to 37 % for small Inbox and 26 % to 34 % for medium sized > Inbox.
Conversational VoIP targets are assumed as:
  * Mouth-to-ear delay target of ≤ 300 ms [3].
  * FER target of ≤ 1 % per link => ≤ 2 % end-to-end [9] (for speech > channels).
As can be seen from the result tables (and yellow marks), the legacy case does
not meet the targets of 300ms\@2% FER at all at C/I 9dB. The RTTI case meets
these targets with MCS-5. At C/I 15dB the legacy case meets the targets with
MCS-5 whereas the RTTI case meets the targets using MCS-9. This implies that
RTTI is needed to meet the conversational targets at lower C/I, and that the
RTTI cases gives significant capacity increase potential, since a higher MCS
can be used and still meet the targets.
The improvement in round-trip also gives gains to a Web download. The Web
download using HTTP/1.1 gives a gain of 17 % for a large Web page.
##### 10.3.3.2.4.3 Multiple-user cases {#multiple-user-cases-1 .H6}
Reduced TTI, shorter RRBP and related Abis improvement give an end-to-end
latency gain (as measured with Ping) of around 35 % in the multiple-user
cases. Note that the same Abis transmission time is used for all multiplexed
mobiles, for a fair comparison.
For VoIP (as can be seen from the result tables and yellow marks), the legacy
case does not meet the targets of 300ms\@2% FER at all at C/I 9dB. The RTTI
cases meets these targets with MCS-5 (308 ms). At C/I 15 dB the legacy case
meets the targets with MCS-5 whereas the RTTI case meets the targets using
MCS-9 (302 ms). This implies that RTTI is needed to meet the conversational
targets at lower C/I, and that the RTTI cases gives significant capacity
increase potential, since a higher MCS can be used and still meet the targets.
In the cases of multiplexing RTTI and legacy mobiles the multiplexing loss, or
resource segregation, for the Ping cases are 5 % to 8 % and for the VoIP cases
3 % to 13 %. The loss is due to that the Ping and VoIP cases implies many
starts and stops of data transfer (short bursts of payload), and could
therefore be seen as worst case scenarios. Note also that the analysis
considers only one RTTI mobile per packet channel. As can be concluded from
the Web download cases, the multiplexing loss is very small, ≤ 0.2 %.
Modulation segregation (i.e. the same modulation needs to be used on both 10ms
sub-slots to be able to USF schedule other mobiles) is not considered in this
analysis, since fixed MCSs are used. Possible techniques to handle modulation
segregation are discussed in ref [10].
##### 10.3.3.2.4.4 Capacity gain {#capacity-gain .H6}
Even though capacity gains have not been explicitly evaluated, it is clear
that a shorter session time gives a capacity gain, since any pooled resources
may be re-used earlier, for other sessions, from the pool.
In the simplest model, where up-to one user is located in each cell, the gain
per application can be directly translated into HW savings of any HW resources
that are pooled between the cells. As an example, this would mean a HW saving
of 4 % to 40 % for e-mail and web services.
The timeslot utilization, for the used VoIP model, has been shown to be 0.6 to
0.7 timeslots per user.
## 10.4 Variable-sized Radio Blocks
### 10.4.1 Introduction
One of the goals of GERAN Evolution is to reduce the latency between the
mobile station and the Gi interface. Although a significant proportion of this
latency is incurred in devices and interfaces which are outside the scope of
standardization, we should not ignore the delay incurred over the radio
interface.
This paper presents a proposal for Variable Sized Radio Blocks (VSRB) which
could reduce the radio-interface delay for small amounts of PS data, both in
the uplink and in the downlink.
### 10.4.2 Motivation
For the transfer of large amounts of data, the latency is primarily determined
by the bandwidth available, and, for a given resource allocation and
modulation/coding scheme, this is fixed. In fact, the delay (as noticed by the
user) is only affected only by the delay of the _last_ radio block in the LLC
frame (since the LLC frame cannot be passed to higher layers before it has
been reassembled).
For the last block in an LLC frame, and for small amounts of data in general,
the limiting factor is the delay while the receiver waits for all four bursts
to arrive. VSRB aims to reduce this delay in those situations where the amount
of data to be sent is small (compared with the amount which could be
transmitted in 4 bursts frames).
### 10.4.3 Concept Description
#### 10.4.3.1 Overview
Under the proposed scheme, new burst mapping rules would be defined (using
existing burst structures) which would allow a receiver to decode both the
data and header parts of a frame using fewer than four bursts; the exact
number would depend on the amount of data to be sent.
Convolutional encoding and puncturing would be used as in the current schemes,
although with modified input and output block lengths.
The existing allocations (4 bursts over 4 TDMA frames) are used, which means
there are no impacts on the scheduling algorithms or channel assignments, and
hence no need for resource segregation.
#### 10.4.3.2 Example: TCP ACK (52 octets)
Using the proposed scheme, an uncompressed TCP Acknowledgement (52 octets)
could be mapped onto only 2 bursts, using either MCS-8 or MCS-9, allowing the
receiver to decode the data and header 10 ms earlier than it would if using
the existing burst mapping.
The new burst mapping for \'MCS-9_2\' is shown below for the first two bursts
(note that the normal burst structure is used unchanged):
{width="5.766666666666667in" height="1.7666666666666666in"}
Figure 333: New burst mapping for \'MCS-9_2\'
In order for the receiver to be able to decode the header using only two
bursts, the header bits that are currently sent in bursts 3 and 4 would be
sent in bursts 1 and 2. The current bit-swapping procedures would need to be
modified to account for the additional header information in these bursts.
For reference, the current burst mapping is, for all four bursts:
{width="5.766666666666667in" height="0.3715277777777778in"}
Figure 334: Current burst mapping
In this example, bursts 3 and 4 would not be needed by the receiver to decode
the header and data. However, in order to ensure backwards-compatibility, the
USF in downlink blocks must be mapped onto the bursts in the same way as
currently. Furthermore it is proposed that \'unused\' blocks contain redundant
data (using Incremental Redundancy) so that if the receiver is unable to
decode the data using just two bursts, it may use soft-combining to attempt to
decode the data after all four blocks have been decoded. Note that other
possibilities for the last two bursts could also be considered - e.g. sending
additional data.
The timeline is shown below comparing existing and proposed schemes:
{width="5.254861111111111in" height="2.91875in"}
Figure 335: Comparison of existing and proposed schemes
#### 10.4.3.3 Signalling/Detection
The signalling of the use of the new mapping schemes remains an open issue and
FFS. Possible approaches may include:
  * Using the stealing bits (subject to the restriction, obviously, that > the receiver must be able to determine that this block should be > decoded after _n_ bursts, having received _2n_ stealing bits).
  * Blind detection (by attempting to decode the header).
  * Indication in the previous block that the next block may use a > shorter block.
If stealing flags were used, it may be possible to allow a legacy mobile to
decode the header (and thereby determine that the block was not intended for
them), by mapping header bits to all blocks as done currently, and defining
stealing flag patterns so that a legacy mobile would \'correct\' the new
unknown pattern to a currently-defined pattern corresponding to the legacy
4-burst modulation/coding scheme.
Note that while indication in the previous block may be the most robust
option, there remains a problem if the previous block is erroneous.
#### 10.4.3.4 Radio Block Capacity
The amount of (uncoded) data that can be transmitted in each radio block is
shown in the table below for MCS-7 to MCS-9.
EXAMPLE: If 18 octets (or fewer) are to be sent using MCS-7 coding and
puncturing, this can be sent in one burst, allowing a reduction of 15ms in the
one-way delay.

#### 10.4.3.5 Retransmissions
Existing modulation and coding schemes belong to one of three families for the
purpose of retransmissions. However, for the MCS7/8/9 1- and 2-burst options,
the overall code rate (using all four bursts) would be lower than other code
rates, and may not benefit from retransmission using a lower coding scheme.
For the 3-burst options (using 2 RLC blocks), retransmissions could be carried
out using lower coding schemes in the families shown below (requiring some
additional padding).
**Table** 184
* * *
Bursts used RLC Blocks MCS 7 MCS 8 MCS 9 3 2 C B A (possibly B) 4 (Legacy) 2 B
A A NOTE: \"(possibly ...)\" indicates that the amount of data in the original
block would need to be reduced slightly.
* * *
#### 10.4.3.6 Benefits
As stated in the introduction, the majority of the delay from MS to SGSN is
incurred away from the air interface. However, the benefits described here may
be combined with improvements to other interfaces/nodes.
As already stated, the latency for a TCP ACK can be reduced by 10ms; this
benefit will apply (cumulatively) to _every_ TCP ACK sent in a TCP session.
A similar reduction can be achieved for small RTP or IP packets, especially
when using header compression. (e.g. 40 ms of G.729 VoIP data could be
transmitted in 2 bursts of MCS 7, 8 or 9 using header compression [11]).
In addition, the use of incremental redundancy _within the complete radio
block would make such transmissions more robust than if sent using the legacy
bit mapping (see subclause 10.5.4)._
_See subclause 10.10.1 for benefits of reduced latency on TCP layer._
### 10.4.4 Performance Characterization
#### 10.4.4.1 Bandwidth Efficiency
Obviously this proposal increases the overhead as a proportion of the amount
of data sent; however, since this scheme would only be used when there was no
other data to send, the reduced efficiency is not an issue.
#### 10.4.4.2 Latency
The delay incurred by a radio block currently is fixed at 20 ms. By using
VSRB, the latency would be lower in those cases where fewer than four bursts
are required to transmit the final radio block.
The figure below compares the total air interface delay for varying amounts of
data to be sent. (The graph continues in a similar manner _ad infinitum_).
{width="5.7659722222222225in" height="4.852083333333334in"}
Figure 336: Delay / data sent
#### 10.4.4.3 Block Error Probability
Because the code rate for the reduced-sized blocks will be the same as in the
current coding schemes, the block error probability will be very similar,
although because of reduced diversity, the probability that a block can be
decoded with just the minimum number of bursts may be slightly lower than at
present.
However, by using incremental redundancy in the \'unused\' bursts, the
resulting BLER (using all four bursts) will be **lower** than the legacy
scheme (since the overall code rate including all four bursts will be lower
than at present), making it less likely that the data must be retransmitted.
This scheme may therefore be appropriate for use where, currently, the coding
and modulation scheme would be changed (to a more robust scheme) for the last
block of a TBF when a small amount of data is to be sent.
Although the motivation for this feature was the reduction of latency, it may
be that the increased redundancy and lower code rate may make this suitable
for use in low C/I scenarios.
#### 10.4.4.4 Simulation results
##### 10.4.4.4.1 Simulation Parameters
Simulations are performed for normal BTS and the physical channel used is the
TU3 idFH channel. Interleaving is done by random permutation of the bits and
new puncturing patterns are used to achieve the required number of output bits
after coding for VSRB blocks. It should be noted that the performance of the
VSRB might be further optimised by changing the interleaving and puncturing
patterns. Simulations are run for 10 000 frames at each C/I point.
##### 10.4.4.4.2 Header Error Rate
The proposed change in the way the header is mapped onto bursts is shown in
figure 337. This allows the receiver to decode both the header and data having
received only 2 bursts.
{width="5.759722222222222in" height="3.198611111111111in"}
Figure 337: Header sent in first two bursts
{width="5.764583333333333in" height="4.510416666666667in"}
Figure 338: VSRB Header Probability
In figure 338 we plot the probability of (MCS-7/8/9) header error for TU3 with
ideal frequency hopping. We also plot, for reference, the BLER for MCS-7 and
MCS-9.
The probability of an error in the legacy header is negligible, and is not
plotted.
As can be seen from the figure, the reduction of frequency diversity does have
an impact on the probability of header error, however, this remains negligible
compared to the overall probability that the data block will be received in
error. It should be noted that the data error rate includes the header error
rate. In other words, the entire data block is treated to be in error when
there is a header error.
##### 10.4.4.4.3 Equal Code Rate Comparison
As described in GP-052598, the underlying code rate for the data sent in the
first two blocks would be the same as in the existing coding schemes. The
proposed arrangement of data using VSRB is shown in figure 339.
Although the code rate will remain the same, the performance may suffer due to
reduced frequency diversity.
{width="5.770138888888889in" height="4.490277777777778in"}
Figure 339: Arrangement of Data using VSRB
{width="5.764583333333333in" height="4.597916666666666in"}
Figure 340: BLER Comparison between VSRB (2-bursts) and legacy MCS
Because there is no interleaving between the first and second pairs of bursts
in MCS-9, there is no difference in the block error rate for VSRB-MCS-9 and
legacy MCS-9.
For MCS-7, the legacy interleaving scheme spreads the data bits of a single
block over all four bursts where as the new interleaving scheme spans only
across two bursts; hence, there is some degradation of performance for VSRB
compared with the legacy scheme: approximately 2 dB at 10 % BLER as shown in
the above Figure. The loss is mainly due to the loss in frequency diversity in
case of frequency hopping scenarios.
##### 10.4.4.4.4 Equal Data Load Comparison
In practice, when transmitting small amounts of data, lower coding schemes may
be used in preference to using a higher rate coding scheme with extra padding.
This has the benefit that small amounts of data are transmitted more robustly,
reducing the probability that a retransmission will be required.
In order to give comparable performance, it is proposed that, for VSRB,
redundant information is sent in the second pair of bursts; if decoding is not
successful after two bursts, then incremental redundancy is used, as shown in
figure 341.
{width="5.259722222222222in" height="2.9270833333333335in"}
Figure 341: Use of Incremental Redundancy
VSRB-MCS-9 (2 bursts) can transmit approximately the same amount of data as
MCS-6; VSRB-MCS-7 (2 bursts) can transmit approximately the same amount of
data as MCS-5. In figure 342 we compare the BLER for each VSRB scheme, decoded
after all four bursts have been received, and legacy MCS-5 and 6.
{width="5.764583333333333in" height="3.770138888888889in"}
Figure 342: Comparison of BLER between VSRB (4-bursts) and legacy MCS
As can be seen from figure 342, there is almost no difference in performance
between using VSRB with incremental redundancy, and the lower encoding scheme
carrying the same amount of data.
### 10.4.5 Impacts on Network Entities and Standards
#### 10.4.5.1 Impacts to the Mobile Station
The following modifications are required to the mobile station:
  * (Transmit) Addition of new interleaving and burst mapping schemes.
  * (Receive) Addition of new de-interleaving schemes.
  * (Receive) Addition of soft-combining using redundant data in \'end\' > bursts.
#### 10.4.5.2 Impacts to the BSS
The impacts on the BSS are the same as for the mobile station.
#### 10.4.5.3 Impacts to the Core Network
There is no impact on the core network
#### 10.4.5.4 Impacts to the specifications
The impacted 3GPP specifications are listed in table 185.

### 10.4.6 Comparison of VSRB and RTTI
In subclause 10.3 the use of a reduced TTI (RTTI) is described. In this
subclause, we compare RTTI and VSRB.
Figure 343 shows the delay incurred over the radio interface for sending data
where the allocation is 2 TS per TDMA frame; for the RTTI scheme this allows a
TTI of 10 ms.
{width="5.28125in" height="4.197916666666667in"}
Figure 343: Delay over the radio interface / data sent
As can be seen, RTTI and VSRB provide broadly comparable delay improvements,
although there are ranges over which the delay using VSRB is lower than with
RTTI, and (for some small ranges) vice versa. (Explanation for the case at
A-A\' is shown in figure 344.)
If, for simplicity, the VSRB scheme is restricted to 4-burst or 2-burst blocks
(i.e. 1-burst and 3-burst blocks not possible), the comparison is as shown in
figure 344.
{width="5.260416666666667in" height="4.166666666666667in"}
Figure 344: Delay over the radio interface / data sent (4-burst or 2-burst
blocks)
One benefit of the RTTI scheme is that it does not reduce bandwidth
efficiency; therefore, latency may be reduced for blocks even where more LLC
data is buffered (in such circumstances, VSRB would most likely not be
appropriate). However, in order to achieve this, new (multislot, or multi-
carrier) channels must be defined; these would not be compatible with legacy
mobiles, requiring resource segregation.
VSRB is fully backwards-compatible, as it uses existing allocation schemes and
therefore does not need new channel definitions or resource segregation (a
method of scheduling RTTI has also been proposed so that avoids resource
segregation). However, as shown above, it can provide similar latency
improvements (if not better) compared with RTTI. VSRB can also be applied
where a single TS allocation is made (cf. RTTI requires an allocation of two
or more timeslots).
## 10.5 Combining Methods
### 10.5.1 Preface
Latency can be improved during short transmissions by allowing earlier
decoding of the final RLC block. As noted in [3] from Siemens, early decoding
the final RLC block of a short transmission is a valuable contribution to
reducing system latency since this decoding operation limits the earliest
response time.
A number of methods have been proposed to GERAN which can lead to earlier
decoding of the final RLC block. These include:
  * Methods which pack the RLC block into a shorter duration (measured > in TDMA periods) by distributing the block on multiple frequencies > within each TDMA period [12] and [13].
  * A concept introduced in GERAN#27 [14], called Variable Size Radio > Block (VSRB), which shortens the block when it is not full.
This contribution shows how these concepts can be combined to achieve even
earlier decoding of the final RLC block than would be possible individually.
### 10.5.2 Early Decode with Multi-Frequency
The use of multiple receiver frequencies inside the same TDMA period allows
the early decode of a RLC frame as shown below, while maintaining a level of
frequency diversity gain equivalent to legacy mobiles (diversity over 4
frequencies, denoted F1 to F4). In this case the mobile station must contain
two receive paths capable of operating simultaneously. Unused blocks can
contain redundancy information which can be combined with the used block to
allow error correction.
The benefit of using Multiple frequencies in the same TDMA frame can also be
applied to a single frequency receive path as illustrated in the following
figure. In this case bursts are distributed on two frequencies in each TDMA
frame by ensuring there is a \'gap\' to retune within the TDMA frame (in the
illustration below the mobile has 1 slot to re-tune). Then two bursts from
each RLC block can be transmitted in a single TDMA period. In this case, where
only one RLC frame needed to be transmitted, its decoding is brought forward
by 10 ms without impact on frequency diversity gain.
{width="5.584027777777778in" height="4.0in"}
Figure 345: Early RLC frame decode with dual frequency/ single trx
The benefit of multiple frequency can be extended beyond the use of 2
frequencies in a TDMA frame. In the following figure early decode is
illustrated in the case of a 4 frequency trx, where only 3 RLC frames need to
be send in the final RLC block period. The final RLC frame can contain
redundancy information. In the illustration below, where 3 out of 4 possible
RLC frames contain data, the decode time is advanced by 5 ms compared with
legacy receivers.
{width="3.908333333333333in" height="3.8340277777777776in"}
Figure 346: Early RLC frame decode with quad frequency
### 10.5.3 Early Decode with VSRB
Latency can be improved when the final RLC radio block of a transmission is
only partially full. The basic idea, called VSRB, is to ensure all the
information needed to decode the RLC block is contained in earliest bursts,
provided it fits in these bursts.
VSRB is fully described in [14] but for convenience is illustrated below. It
is assumed that enough information is in the first two bursts of the RLC block
period for a decode attempt to take place. The second two bursts contain
redundant information to allow further decode attempts using incremental
redundancy decoding. Although frequency diversity is reduced for the first
decode attempt, it is fully exploited during later attempts and on average
earlier decoding can be expected.
EXAMPLE: If the radio block is half full it can be decoded up to 10 ms earlier
with a consequent improvement in latency. This is illustrated in figure 347.
{width="4.479861111111111in" height="3.7930555555555556in"}
Figure 347: VSRB
### 10.5.4 Early Decode with combined VSRB and Multi-Frequency
VSRB can be combined with multiple frequency/ multislot operation. In this
case _N_ RLC frames are sent in a single RLC period, assuming _N_ slots are
used. With legacy mobiles, each burst of the RLC frames must be transmitted
over a different one of the 4 TDMA frames otherwise frequency diversity gain
is lost.
During the final RLC block period of a transmission, only a subset of the _N_
available RLC frames may be actually needed for data (since the number of RLC
frames transmitted is not necessarily an exact multiple of _N_); the remaining
frames can contain redundancy information. With a legacy mobile, not capable
of multi-frequency operation with one TDMA frame, none of the RLC frames can
be decoded early, since all frames are spread over the entire RLC block
period, i.e. 4 TDMA frames.
If the last RLC frame is not full, then multi-frequency operation can be
combined with VSRB to deliver the last RLC frame even earlier. In the
illustration below the last RLC frame is only 50% full, and is coded according
to VSRB principles. A single receive path is assumed with multi-frequency
operation achieved by using timeslots with time separation for retuning. In
the illustration below, decoding of the final RLC frame is advanced by:
  * 5 ms compared to pure dual-frequency without VSRB;
  * 5 ms compared to pure VSRB without dual-frequency; and
  * by 15ms compared to legacy mobiles.
{width="4.841666666666667in" height="3.988888888888889in"}
Figure 348: VSRB and dual frequency/ single trx
In summary, the following steps can be taken to reduce latency by advancing in
time the decode of the final RLC frame of a multislot transmission:
1) Reduce the TTI of each RLC frame to 10ms (if two frequencies used) or 5 ms
(if 4 frequencies used).
2) Use VSRB coding during the final RLC block period, if this would bring
forward decode time.
## 10.6 Performance characterization of combined proposals
### 10.6.1 RTTI and Fast Ack/Nack Reporting
#### 10.6.1.1 Simulation results for VoIP
In the following some results are shown regarding a VoIP service realized over
a GERAN network that implements the following \"latency reduction\" features:
1\. **Reduced TTI radio blocks**. Both \"10 ms TTI\" and \"5 ms TTI\" are
considered. The \"2-burst RTTI radio blocks\" option is not taken into
account. For the \"5 ms TTI\" case, the constraint described in subclause
10.3.1.5, mandating the transmission/reception of RTTI blocks every other TTI
period (i.e. every other TDMA frame) is also considered in the simulations.
2\. **A Fast Ack/Nack reporting scheme** , as described in subclause
10.2.1.3.2, i.e. the approach where a short bitmap is included in RLC data
blocks.
3\. **A shorter MS reaction time** : \~10 ms is assumed for the \"10 ms TTI\"
case, while less than 1 TDMA frame is assumed for the \"5 ms TTI\" case, as
described in subclause 10.3.1.5.
4\. **TBFs operated in RLC Non-Persistent mode**. The maximum number of
retransmissions per RLC block is set to 1 or 2 (i.e. the total number of
transmissions for a given RLC block cannot exceed 2 or 3, respectively). The
RLC Window Size is set to 6, i.e. a considerably lower value than the
currently minimum possible of 64 (this issue is analyzed in more detail in
GP-060780 (GERAN#29).
In addition, it is assumed that **SNDCP/LLC headers are reduced to 2 bytes** ,
as described in G2-022708 (GERAN WG2#11bis).
Four different low-latency scenarios are simulated, as described in table 186.

##### 11.3.2.1.3 A numerology
The following table summarizes the numerology associated with the schemes
described in subclause 11.3.2.1.2. This table also captures the fact that MCSs
are still grouped in families (A, B, C).
All figures in bits.
The nomenclature is as follows.
**Uncoded Header:** Header before coding. It changes for the GMSK blocks, the
8PSK blocks and the 8PSK blocks carrying two RLC blocks.\ **HCS:** Protection
for the header.
**Uncoded Data:** \"raw\" data, i.e. data coming from the upper layers before
coding and puncturing. This is consistently larger than the corresponding
value presented in subclause 2.5. In other words, all of the additional
bandwidth coming from the timeslot aggregation has been employed to provide a
larger RLC payload.\ **BCS:** Protection for the data part.
**Coded Header:** Header + HCS after coding and puncturing.
**Coded Data:** Data + BCS after coding and puncturing.\ **Code rate:**
effective code rate for the data part (the mother code is the same, but the
amount of puncturing changes from MCS to MCS). It shall be noted that the code
rate is always equal to the code rate of the existing RLC blocks, as indicated
in table 2.
**Total:** number of bits that are passed to the fourtet of timeslots are the
physical layer.

* * *
For this Option, new MCS schemes will be needed for this concept. Note that
for different levels of aggregation at the physical layer, different set of
MCS schemes may need to be defined - for instance, assuming that aggregation
of 2 to 4 timeslots on uplink is proposed; it may be necessary to define a
total of 27 new MCS schemes.
A change in the number of allotted timeslots on the uplink at the physical
layer leads to an automatic change in the MCS scheme because of aggregated
timeslot configurations and this is undesirable. This might need complicated
inter layer communication between the physical layer and the RLC/MAC layer
both at the sender and the receiver.
There will be some implications on the incremental redundancy support across
different new MCS schemes and this would lead to further losses from the
system perspective if seamless incremental redundancy support is not possible
across all the new MCS schemes.
#### 11.3.2.2 Option 2: Reduced code rate for the 2-slot aggregation
##### 11.3.2.2.1 Principles
The working principles and inter-relations of RLC, MAC, and physical layer for
this option are summarized as follows for the case of the 2-slot aggregation.
The same working principles illustrated in subclause 11.3.2.1.1 are
maintained. Additionally:
  * The header is assumed to be larger to indicate the multiple blocks.
  * Data (non coded) has been kept the same as for the existing RLC/MAC > blocks.
  * 12 stealing flags (SF) were accounted for the New Formats:
\- Cope with eventual definition of additional MCS\'s for reduced TTI.
  * A, B, C indicates the EGPRS family. The same concept remains the > same.
  * The code rate has been reduced for each MCS:
\- All of the bandwidth made available from the new burst format is used to
reduce the code rate for the same payload size.

Options 1 and 2 are describing a trade-off curve between larger block size and
more robust code rate. The optimum point of this curve would most likely have
to be found with simulations.
Option 4 is also attractive in case one is willing to pursue changes to the
employed coding technique. This in any case would be worth an investigation.
Note that if one of the uplink timeslots is a CS timeslot, then it is likely
that aggregation of that CS timeslot is not possible. In such a case, in order
to make the aggregation among the PS timeslots feasible, the CS time slot has
to be moved to either the beginning or to the end of the allotted uplink
timeslots. Whilst this is not a problem in general, it should be noted that in
some cases, the CS timeslot has to stay in between the uplink PS timeslots.
In EGPRS the control messages are transmitted using CS-1. The timeslots on
which these control messages are sent can not be aggregated with other
timeslots. Since the network does not know in advance when exactly a MS
transmits a CS-1 coded control message, the network would have to find out by
blind detection if all allotted timeslots are aggregated or if there is a
separate CS-1 coded timeslot.
## 11.4 Performance Characterization
### 11.4.1 Performance calculations
For a two timeslot allocation the gain of the new slot format (consisting of
removal of guard times and TSC) measured at L1 would be 18.53 %. Within a
n-timeslot allocation the gain would therefore be proportional to n, as
illustrated by table 194.
**Table** 194: Bandwidth gain of the new slot format **(see note)**
* * *
Allocated Timeslots Symbols in new slot format Gain 2 270.25 18.53 % 3 426.5
24.7 % 4 582.75 27.8 %
* * *
NOTE. Performance figures will have to be verified with respect to the
identified issues (e.g. high speed case).
It is worth noting that the above-mentioned gain merely include the additional
L1 bandwidth. It does not include the fact that the additional bandwidth could
be exploited e.g. for better coding. In fact, while tail-biting convolutional
coding with Viterbi decoding is optimal for small block sizes (up to 150
bits), other coding schemes, such as turbo codes or hyper-codes, outperform
TB-convolutional for blocks larger than 150 bits. Further, we note that the
power employed in correspondence of each timeslot is obviously increased,
since more bits are transmitted (e.g. in correspondence of guard times).
However, the transmitted energy per bit remains unchanged.
### 11.4.2 Link Level Simulations
#### 11.4.2.1 GMSK Modulated Channels with legacy equalizers
##### 11.4.2.1.1 First simulation run
Simulations have been run for the following settings:
  * RawBER simulation results.
  * Results based on SNR-limited scenarios (i.e. no variation of > interference within the aggregated timeslot).
  * Results expressed in terms of performance degradation (or lack of > performance degradation) due to the timeslot aggregation, i.e. the > penalty (or lack of penalty) paid on the link budget because of > the timeslot expansion and correspondent training sequence > removal:
\- E.g. \"0 dB\" means that the non-aggregated format and the aggregated
format were found to have the same performance.
  * UL Receiver (in the BTS) assumed to be the same as a MS receiver > (likely a pessimistic assumption).
  * Frequency tracking errors and various impairments not considered > neither for the non-aggregated nor for the aggregated format:
\- The goal being to evaluate the equalizer performance against the proposed
new formats.
  * \"EQ-A\" is a reference GMSK equalizer employing MLSE.
  * \"EQ-B\" is another reference GMSK equalizer, employing MLSE + LMS > with Per-Survivor Processing.
The results are summarized by table 195.
**No performance requirements for the uncoded case exists certain channels:
these cases have been shaded dark grey in table** 195**.**
**Also, the specification does not say anything for the certain channels:
these cases have been shaded light grey in table** 195**.**

##### 11.4.2.1.2 Second simulation run
Further simulations were run independently of the former.
Those confirmed that the BER performance of aggregated new burst became worse
for certain scenarios. The performance degradation of 3 burst aggregation in
co-channel interference condition is listed in table 196 for GMSK channels.

#### 11.4.2.2 8PSK Modulated Channels with legacy equalizers
##### 11.4.2.2.1 First simulation run
Simulations have been run with the same settings as subclause 11.4.2.1.1.
Additionally
  * \"EQ-A\" is a reference EDGE equalizer, essentially replicating the > same performance of an EDGE mobile receiver available today.
\- Note that the complexity of running EQ-A over a 2-slot aggregation is lower
than running EQ-A twice over a non-aggregated slot, since some channel
processing associated to the TSC reception is run only once per aggregation.
(Same applies for a 3 slot aggregation).
  * \"EQ-B\" is a variant of \"EQ-A\" with slightly more frequent > channel tracking.
\- The complexity of running EQ-B over a 2-slot aggregation is only marginally
higher than running EQ-A twice over a non-aggregated slot. In fact, while
channel processing is more frequent, this is offset by the fact that more TSC
processing would have been performed over adjacent non-aggregated slots. In
other words, EQ-B entails little complexity increase compared to EQ-A.
The results are summarized by table 197.

subclause 11.4.2.1.1. Additionally, Random SNR variations on a per-timeslot
basis were simulated.
Effectively, this has been done by applying a random variation (± 1 dB) around
the \"nominal SNR\" on a per-timeslot basis within a 2-slot and a 3-slot
aggregation.
Figure 367 illustrates this simulation principle.

Figure 367: Per-timeslot SNR variations for a 3-slot aggregation
The simulation results can be summarized by the following table, expressed in
terms of performance degradation (or lack of it) with respect to the
\"standard burst\".
**Note that for some profiles the standard has currently no performance
requirements for the uncoded case.**
**In particular, no performance requirements for the uncoded case exist for
RA130 and HT100. These cases have been shaded dark grey in table** 199**.**
A rapid inspection of the results indicates that, for the evaluated cases
(which obviously includes some amongst the most challenging ones, i.e. high
speed at higher frequency), no difference exists from the cases where \"non-
advanced\" simulation settings had been used.
This means that the simulated variation on a per-timeslot basis produced no
discernible effect in the evaluation of the aggregated formats.

#### 11.4.2.4 Interference limited scenarios
Interference Limited scenarios are relevant to an evaluation of the new
formats from two points of view.
First, the SINR could change within one aggregated slot in those scenarios
where the interference conditions change on a per-timeslot basis.
Secondly, some interference cancellation implementation at the receiver (in
the uplink) would have to cope with the removal of some of the training
sequences within an aggregated format. This effect is difficult to study since
uplink interference cancellation techniques are proprietary and no details or
performance requirements are available for it. The only reference of some
relevance is DARP, i.e. downlink interference cancellation. It is therefore
interesting to notice how DARP performance is tested in scenarios where the
training sequence is removed, thus de-facto assuming that the interference
cancellation algorithm will not, at least to achieve the required performance,
rely on the TSC.
The interference scenario shown in figure 368 was simulated. All the
interferer timeslots shown are assumed to be of same mean power.
Equalizer used for the simulations already includes channel tracking to
compensate the channel variations during the longer burst.
Interference cancellation was not used.
{width="5.761111111111111in" height="2.701388888888889in"}
NOTE: The lengths of the burst shown above are not to the same scale.
Figure 368: Interference scenario simulated
The results are summarized in the table 200.

5 % BER 1.2 2.2 5 > 20 > 20 > 20
* * *
Such a link level loss would simply negate any gains achieved through timeslot
aggregation for these high velocities at high frequency bands, when NO
interference cancellation is used.
#### 11.4.2.5 RLC Simulations
##### 11.4.2.5.1 RLC Simulations with New Coding Schemes
As the aggregated RLC block can provide the longer data block length before
channel coding, so using turbo codes as channel coding become realistic. In
this subclause, turbo codes is introduced in the aggregated RLC data block and
LA and IR simulation results are provided based on new defined coding schemes.
This subclause therefore corresponds to Option 4 of subclause 11.3.
Refer to the current EGPRS uplink MCS coding schemes, new uplink coding
schemes is defined in the simulation, listed in table 201.
It is defined as the same data rate (per legacy burst) with legacy MCS.
MB3MCS10 and MB3MCS11 are added to the coding schemes to reach peak data rate.
In MB3MCS1 to MB3MCS9, the redundancy bit from burst aggregation and RLC
aggregation are used as the protection bit in coding. Head length and coding
schemes of new MCS type is the same with the legacy MCS in the simulation and
it needs further study.

  * **Scenarios:**
\- co-channel interference

  * TU3iFH: 900 MHz.
  * TU50: 900 MHz.
  * RA250: 900 MHz.
  * TU50: 1 800 MHz.
Table 202 shows the data throughput of new defined MCS and standard MCS. The
CDF of C/I presented by TeliaSonera in _GP-042355_ , indicates very few
occurrences of C/I above 22 dB. According to the C/I pdf in _GP-042355_ , the
average data throughput can be calculated, the average gains are listed as
following.

The figures show that the data throughput gains of new coding schemes with
turbo codes are very close to the theoretical gains with aggregated formats at
L1 and L2.
## 11.5 Additional technical aspects
### 11.5.1 Influence of TSC Position
#### 11.5.1.1 New slot formats in simulation
In modern mobile communication, coherent time {width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.25in"} of the wireless channel is defined as [1].
{width="2.1805555555555554in" height="0.5277777777777778in"}
{width="0.1527777777777778in" height="0.19375in"} is the wave-length of
carrier,{width="0.125in" height="0.1527777777777778in"} is the velocity of
mobile terminal and {width="0.20833333333333334in" height="0.25in"} is the
maximum Doppler frequency. At 250 km/h, {width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.25in"} is about 2.03 ms for 900 MHz GSM system, a little shorter
than the time duration of 4 legacy slots. So the maximum number of legacy
slots we used in the new slot aggregation is 4 because the RA250 is the
fastest fading channel in our simulation.
According to the rule of aggregation and the maximum number of slots, we use
three new slot formats in the simulation, aggregation of two slots, three
slots and four slots. As the current rule of aggregation, the position of TSC
in the new slot is relatively not changed, and just remains in one of the
legacy slots in the aggregation. In the new slot format we will find the
lengths of data block before the TSC and data block following the TSC are not
equal, and will induce the unbalance of channel estimation or channel tracking
for the two data blocks. Furthermore, the unbalance will lead to demodulation
and block error performance losses.
In order to evaluate the performance degradation, two types of new slot format
are used in the simulation. One is that TSC remains in the first slot, denoted
by Type A; another is that the TSC located at the middle of the new slot,
denoted by Type B. Figures 369 to 371 show the details. As we know, the
channel tracking makes the receiver more robust to the channel fluctuation and
may influence the decision for the TSC position scheme. We include the LMS
channel tracking in Viterbi algorithm [3] in our simulations to discuss this
effect.
For the simulation convenience, the 0.25{width="0.125in"
height="0.1388888888888889in"}n symbols of guard period (see note) form n
legacy slots are moved into the new guard period in the new slot. For
instance, the guard period in the aggregation of two slots is 8.5 symbols and
the guard period in the aggregation of three slots is 8.75 symbols.
NOTE. The new slot is the aggregation of n legacy slots; n may equals 2, 3, 4
or more.

#### 11.5.1.2 Simulation Results
In the following, the simulation results are presented to show the influence
of the TSC position in the new slot on the link performance.
In the simulation, both GMSK and 8PSK modulation are applied. The wireless
channel model used in the simulation is TU50, HT100 and RA250, which defined
in [2].
Nomenclature is as follows.
**Table** 203: Description of curves
* * *
Type Description Type_A_ChTrac TSC in the first slot and receiver with channel
tracking Type_B_ChTrac TSC in the middle of new slot and receiver with channel
tracking Type_A_NoChTrac TSC in the first slot and receiver without channel
tracking Type_B_NoChTrac TSC in the middle of new slot and receiver without
channel tracing
* * *
For convenience of compare, when the TSC is located in the middle of the new
slot, the performance gains at BER level of 7 % for GMSK are summarised in the
table 204.
**Table** 204: Performance gain (dB) at the BER level of 7 %, GMSK
+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+ | Channel | Aggr | Aggr | Aggr | | | | | | egation | egation | egation | | | | | type | of two | of | of four | | | | | | slot | three | slot | | | | | | | slot | | | | | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+ | | ChTrac | N | ChTrac | N | ChTrac | N | | | | oChTrac | | oChTrac | | oChTrac | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+ | TU50 | 0.0 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.5 | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+ | HT100 | 0.1 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 1.5 | 1.2 | > 3 | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+ | RA250 | 0.7 | 1.5 | 2.0 | > 3 | > 3 | > 3 | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+
It\'s obvious that receiver gets better performance when the TSC is located in
middle of the new slot, especially under faster fading channel, such as RA250;
for instance, at the BER level of 10 % for GMSK modulation, aggregation of
four slots and receiver with channel tracking, the performance gain is about 3
dB under RA250, while 1.0 dB under HT100. More instances can be seen in table
204.
This phenomenon can be explained by following description. If the TSC is
always located in the first slot, the lengths of data block before and behind
the TSC are not equal, and the estimation error variance of the channel
estimation for the two blocks is not equal. This will lead to the overall
performance degradation of the receiver. While the TSC is located in the
middle of new slot, the channel estimation for the two blocks is balanced. The
fading in RA250 is faster than that in HT100. To the same new slot in which
the TSC is located in the first slot, the unbalance of channel estimation in
RA250 is more serious, and more improvement can be obtained by putting the TSC
in the middle position of new slot.
At the same time, the performance gain is sensitive to the number of legacy
slots in the new slot aggregation. The more legacy slots in the aggregation,
the more gain will be obtained. For instance, at the 10 % BER for 8PSK
modulation under HT100, the gain is 1.7 dB for aggregation of four slots and
only 0.8 dB for aggregation of three slots, 0.1 dB for aggregation of two
slots. And the statistical data in table 203 shows the gain\'s trend more
clearly. To the new slot aggregation in which the TSC located in the first
slot, the more slots used in new slot aggregation, the larger difference
between the length of the two data blocks, and the more unbalance induced in
channel estimation for two data blocks.
The simulation results also show that when the equalization receiver without
channel tracking, the BER performance is more sensitive to the position of TSC
in the new slot. Although the time duration of new slot in the simulations is
shorter than the coherent time{width="0.20833333333333334in" height="0.25in"},
fading over the time duration is changing slowly. If the equalization does not
track the slowly changing channel, the mismatch of channel estimation will be
raised as the equalization processes. Hence, the BER unbalance of the receiver
without channel tracking is more serious than that of receiver with channel
tracking.
For real application, we may have more interest on the performance gain of
8PSK modulated new slot aggregation of two slots. At the BER level of 2 %
under TU50, the performance gain is 0.3 dB for receiver with channel tracking,
and 1.0 dB for receiver without channel tracking. More gains can be obtained
under HT100 and RA250.
### 11.5.2 BER Distribution Aspects
With the aggregated bursts, the bit error rate would vary significantly over
the whole burst. This is illustrated in figure 372.
{width="4.866666666666666in" height="3.870833333333333in"}
NOTE: Higher BER is experienced by every third bit in the 8 PSK symbol hence
there are two distinct traces of BER profiles in the plot for each physical
channel mode.

simulation of a 4 slot aggregated burst) - Cochannel interference
### 11.5.3 Relationship between performance penalty and aggregation size
#### 11.5.3.1 Simulation Setting
The purpose of this subclause is to investigate the degradation structure of
the new bursts.
The simulation is designed to have a 26-symbol training sequence in the middle
of the aggregated burst, and 4 segments of symbols are placed on each side of
the training sequence and 3 tail symbols on each end as shown in figure 373.
The 4 segments correspond to the message symbols of the standard burst, 1^st^
burst expansion, 2^nd^ burst expansion, and 3^rd^ burst expansion. The raw BER
of the symmetric pairs of the symbol segments are collected. Name the pair
closest to the training sequence the Segment-I and the pair that is 2^nd^
closest to training sequence the Segment-II, and so on; giving us Segment-I,
Segment-II, Segment-III, and Segment-IV, see figure 373.
{width="4.863888888888889in" height="1.5833333333333333in"}
Figure 373: The burst structure used in the simulation analysis
#### 11.5.3.2 Simulation Results and Analysis
The raw BER of the Segment-I, Segment-II, Segment-III, and Segment-IV are
shown in figure 374.
The Segment-I performance can be considered as the performance of the standard
burst. The equalizer is a well-known adaptive equalizer, which is per-survivor
based adaptive RSSE. It is shown that the penalty accelerates as each legacy
burst slot is added into the aggregated burst. On each step of the burst size
expansion, the date rate increase of the expanded portion is (156-116)/116 =
34.5 %. The penalty of the expanded portion in difference levels of the
expansion is given in table 205.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="2.895138888888889in"}
Figure 374: Raw BERs of Segment-I,II,II,IV, and aggregated burst
It is shown that the penalty accelerates as each legacy burst is added into
the aggregated burst. The penalty will get worse for higher speed fading such
as RA250. As the center frequency goes to 1 900 MHz, extra penalty can be
expected. Although equalizer improvement can reduce the acceleration, the
penalty structure will not be shifted dramatically. Thus as each legacy burst
is added to the new burst, the value is diminishing, and it even could
contribute negatively.
**Table** 205: Date rate increase on each level of expansion vs. its cost in
TU50 and HT100
* * *
                                      1^st^ expansion   2^nd^ expansion   3^rd^ expansion

dB 2.5 dB 7 dB Penalty HT100\@10%RBER 1 dB 2 dB 7 dB
* * *
The normalized goodputs of the different levels of aggregation are given in
figure 375, which is defined as the product of the (1-RBER) multiplied by the
ratio of number of information symbols to the total symbols sent.
It can be seen that 2-burst aggregation gives the most gain in terms of
goodput. The value of expansion from 3-burst aggregation to 4-burst
aggregation is minimal. Actually, for higher speed fading in 1 900 MHz, adding
the 4^th^ burst could contribute negatively.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="2.8222222222222224in"}
Figure 375: Goodput with different level of aggregation
It is important to point out that in interference limited cases, the penalty
can be even worse since the variation of interferes across a standard burst
boundary can be dramatic, which disturbs the equalizer tracking for the new
burst structure.
## 11.6 New Burst Structures with Turbo Codes
According to the simulation results, even though the TSC is placed in the
middle of the new burst, the BER performance of new burst structure will
degrade under many scenarios, especially under faster fading channel. There
are many ways to reduce the degradation, such as increasing the trellis size
of the equalizer, using more frequently channel tracking algorithm or
optimized channel tracking algorithm, but the degradation will still exist.
The degraded BER performance will induce the degradation of upper layer BLER
of channel decoding, so more powerful error corrective channel coding may be
considered to use.
This paper presents performance on new defined coding schemes with turbo codes
on new burst structure and some compatibility problems of new burst structure
used in uplink.
### 11.6.1 BER Degradation of New Burst
The BER performance of aggregated new burst became worse. The performance
degradation of 3 burst aggregation in co-channel interference condition is
listed in tables 206 and 207.
Table 206: BER degradation of 3 burst aggregation compared to legacy burst,

TU50 1 800 MHz 1.0 dB 6.5 dB RA250 900 MHz 6 dB > 10 dB
* * *
The equalizer here used is based on normal implementation complexity.
The coding scheme\'s BLER is sensitive to the BER, especially when higher
coding rate. Very low level BER is needed to obtain peak data rate. Figures in
table 1 and 2 show lager degradations at lower BER.
So more powerful error corrective channel coding may be used in upper layer
when BER degradation can\'t be avoided.
### 11.6.2 New Coding schemes and Simulation
The target of GERAN evolution is to improve the data throughput. In [2], RLC
aggregation is proposed to get more gains of data throughput, but the gains
listed in the paper is the theoretical results. No proposals to get the gains
are provided.
As the aggregated RLC block can provide the longer data block length before
channel coding, so using turbo codes as channel coding become realistic. In
this subclause, turbo codes is introduced in the aggregated RLC data block and
LA and IR simulation results are provided based on new defined coding schemes.
#### 11.6.2.1 Coding schemes
Refer to the current EGPRS uplink MCS coding schemes, new uplink coding
schemes is defined in the simulation, listed in table 208. It is defined as
the same data rate (per legacy burst) with legacy MCS. MB3MCS10 and MB3MCS11
are added to the coding schemes to reach peak data rate. In MB3MCS1 to
MB3MCS9, the redundancy bit from burst aggregation and RLC aggregation are
used as the protection bit in coding. Head length and coding schemes of new
MCS type is the same with the legacy MCS in the simulation and it need further
study.

#### 11.6.2.3 Simulation results
The curves in figures 376 to 379 show data throughput vs. C/I of new defined
MCS and standard MCS. Different gains of new defined MCS against standard MCS
with different C/I can be seen in the figure. The CDF of C/I presented by
TeliaSonera in [4] indicates very few occurrences of C/I above 22 dB.
According to the C/I pdfi, average data throughput can be calculated, the
average gains are listed as following.

## 11.7 Timeslot Aggregation for RTTI TBF and Link Performance
### 11.7.1 Introduction
Reduced TTI (RTTI) and Fast Ack/Nack Reporting (FANR) are accepted as
effective enhancements to reduce latency [14], [15] and [16]. To get room for
the FANR short bitmap, the coding schemes (convolution, puncturing and
interleaving) of RLC data shall be modified due to the reduction of RLC data
payload, or the RLC data code rate shall be increased. [17].
In this contribution, timeslot aggregation is introduced. A fat New Burst is
formatted by aggregating the two uplink allocated timeslots of RTTI TBF and
extra symbols are obtained. Some of the extra symbols are used to bear the
short bitmap, thus the RLC data payload and its coding scheme can be
maintained as before. The simulation results for the link performance of the
legacy MCSs, RTTI + FANR and the New Burst + RTTI + FANR are also presented.
### 11.7.2 Timeslot aggregation for RTTI
At least two timeslots will be allocated to a RTTI TBF. If the two timeslots
are consecutive, they can be aggregated to form a fat timeslot, thus can bear
a fat burst. [18] That is, the radio blocks would still span two TDMA frames
after aggregation, but would now consist of two \"aggregated\" bursts, instead
of four ordinary bursts, as shown in figure 380.

Figure 380: Normal Burst format after two timeslots aggregation for RTTI TBF
The stealing bits and extra stealing bits on both timeslots are preserved
after aggregation because the block is composed of only two aggregated bursts.
The preserved stealing bits and extra stealing bits are located next to the
Training sequence as shown in figure 380. In case of MCS5-9, there will be no
extra stealing bits. To improve the receiver performance, the TSC is located
in the middle of new aggregated slot [19].
After the removal of Guard period and Tail Bits between the two bursts, and
the Training Sequence of one burst, 40.25 extra symbols will be retrieved from
each aggregated fat burst. Therefore, 80 or 240 extra bits will be retrieved
for each block using MCS1-4 or MCS5-9 respectively.
The extra bits can be used to improve the throughput, or to reduce the RLC
code rate, or to transfer the piggy-backed FANR bitmap.
In this contribution, some of the extra bits are used as FANR bitmap. For
MCS1-4, all the 80 extra bits are used as the bitmap. For MCS 5-9, 120 bits
are used, and the other 120 bits are used for redundancy or other purpose.
### 11.7.3 Definition of the new coding schemes

### 11.7.4 Header and Data coding
The coding of RLC header and data is kept unchanged. Only the burst mapping is
changed in order to allow Reduced TTI operation and aggregated bursts. The
header and data bits are mapped on two aggregated fat bursts spanning two
consecutive TDMA frames. The process is illustrated in the figure 380.
### 11.7.5 Bitmap coding
The bitmap payload has a length of 32 bits, thus is more robust or able to
take more Ack/Nack information compared with 20 bits usually used for FANR.
The coding of the bitmap is independent of RLC header and data.
To get a similar code rate as RLC header, 8 CRC bits are added to the bitmap
payload. The method for generating the CRC and the convolutional coding
polynomials of MCS header are reused here. For NBRTTI1-4, the convolutional
coded bitmap data is uniformly punctured from 120 bits to 80 bits. For
NBRTTI5-9, no bits are punctured from the coded bitmap. See table 211. After
punctured, the bitmap is interleaved independently and mapped uniformly on the
encryption bits. The method is described in the figure 381.

### 11.7.6 Simulation results
Simulations are done for two types coding schemes (MCS-2-like and MCS-6-like)
for TU3iFH and TU 50iFH channels for low band (GSM 900) and upper band (GSM
1800). Every type has three specific coding schemes: the standard MCS schemes,
the RTTI type coding schemes assumed to have a 20-bit FANR bitmap, and the
NBRTTI coding schemes assumed to have a 32-bit bitmap.
The idea is to have an insight of the performance achieved (e.g. higher
throughput) through the NBRTTI coding schemes and the loss in the performance
due to timeslot aggregation.

schemes, including the data, header and the bitmap.

## 11.7 Impacts to the Mobile Station
From the point of view of the transmitter, implementation aspects may be
simplified by the usage of the 157/156/156/156 transmission option, as
referenced in subclause 5.7 of 3GPP TS 45.010 (see note), as this would remove
the complication introduced by the 0.25 bit.
NOTE. \"Optionally, the BTS may use a timeslot length of 157 symbol periods on
timeslots with TN = 0 and 4, and 156 symbol periods on timeslots with TN = 1,
2, 3, 5, 6, 7, rather than 156,25 symbol periods on all timeslots\".
From the point of view of the receiver, the removal of the TSC will require
enhanced receiver and equalization capabilities (for example channel tracking
equalization). Resilience to higher Doppler and phase rotation will have to be
investigated in particular for the high-speed case.
In an interference-limited scenario, the interference profile is likely to
change within an aggregated timeslot (which would be subject to the
interference from multiple independent bursts). This is not different from
what interference cancellation algorithms (e.g. SAIC) already have to cope
with today at the timeslot level in an asynchronous network. In general, we
note that receiver capabilities in the mobile station have improved largely
with DARP Phase 1.
From the point of view of the protocol stack on the transmission side, the
proposal introduces some dependencies between the MAC layer and the RLC layer,
as the RLC has to be aware of the ongoing timeslot aggregation.
## 11.8 Impacts to the BSS
From the point of view of transmission and reception, the impact is the same
as in subclause 11.6.
Further, the BSS has to be able to handle received timeslots in a joint
manner.
## 11.9 Impacts to the Core Network
The core network impact is minimal, e.g. indication of feature support.
## 11.10 Impacts to the Specification
A preliminary assessment of impacted specification follows. A more complete
assessment can be done depending on whether the full set, or a subset, of
components is pursued.

# 12 Adaptation between mobile station receiver diversity and dual-carrier
## 12.1 Introduction
Within the context of the GERAN Physical Layer evolution, where one of the
prime targets is a smooth evolutionary path, two proposed candidates are
receive diversity (see clause 6), and dual/multi-carrier (see clause 7).
This Subclause deals with a proposed technique, referred to as Capabilities
Switching, which is applicable if the two aforementioned candidates are
introduced in the GERAN specification.
## 12.2 Concept description
The underlying assumption of the proposal outlined in this subclause is that,
if and when Receive Diversity (RxDiv) and Multi-carrier GERAN (MC) are
introduced in the specification, it makes sense to allow the existence of a
class of mobiles operating with the following two constraints.
a) RxDiv performances are required only when the terminal acts in single-
carrier mode.
b) Not more than two carriers are supported by the terminal when in Multi-
carrier mode.
The existence of such a class of mobiles should be seen as the enabler for a
faster and gradual implementation and introduction of the corresponding
features. It shall not be seen as a limiting factor for further evolution
steps.
The two constraints mentioned above can and should be exploited by the network
to better control the performance of the terminals. This is possible by
allowing the network to command the terminal whether to act in receive
diversity (RxDiv) mode or in Dual/Multi-carrier mode (MC). In this context,
the RxDiv mode implies that both antennas are tuned to the same carrier, and
the MC mode implies that each antenna is tuned to a separate carrier.
NOTE. The idea is in fact extensible to n antennas and n carriers.
The components of the idea are as follows:
  * The MS signals its capabilities are per point a) and b) above, > associated with its switching capability.
  * By default, the terminal exploits the RxDiv capability:
\- Therefore, both antennas will be tuned to the same carrier and the MS
performance will be increased as a consequence.
  * When appropriate, the network may signal to the MS to switch to the > multi-carrier mode:
\- The signalling could be done in the assignment phase (e.g. in the EGPRS
Packet Downlink Assignment)**,** i.e. per MS.
\- Consequently, the MS leaves the first antenna tuned to the first carrier,
and tunes the second antenna to the second carrier.
  * The network can switch between the two modes to trade-off capacity > vs peak data rate.

Figure 392: RxDiv - Multi-carrier switching
## 12.3 Performance Characterization
The performance of Capability Switching is the combination of the respective
performances of Receive Diversity (see clause 6) and Dual/Multi-carrier (see
clause 7). The combination depends on how the adaptation between the two modes
is performed.
## 12.4 Impacts to the Mobile Station
**The MS will have to support switching commands between the two modes, and
will have to indicate the switching capability.**
## 12.5 Impacts to the BSS
The BSS may have to add the switching option to its RRM algorithms.
## 12.6 Impacts to the Core Network
The CN will have support the signalling of the switching capability support.
## 12.7 Impacts to the Specification
The impact to specification is considered to be minimal, and depending on the
specification impact of Receive Diversity and Dual/Multi-carrier.
# 13 Enhancements to resource allocation
## 13.1 Introduction
There are a number of allocation schemes defined for GPRS, including fixed
allocation, Dynamic Allocation (DA) and Extended Dynamic Allocation (EDA). Of
these EDA is the most capable since it permits the network to vary the
weighting between transmit/receive slots from maximum downlink weighting to
maximum uplink weighting. The other dynamic allocation scheme, namely DA,
requires the mobile to monitor at least as many downlink slots as it transmits
on the uplink, so using DA it cannot transmit more uplink slots than it can
monitor downlink slots, even though the mobile may have hardware capable of
such behaviour. The method of allocating uplink resources in EDA is explained
in 3GPP TS 44.060, subclause 8.1.1.2.1.
The example below (figure 393) illustrates that sometimes EDA is inefficient
at sharing uplink resources between mobiles. In this illustration the network
needs to share allocated slots between two class 12 mobiles, MS1 and MS2, both
of which are capable of using up to 4 slots in the downlink or uplink (the
example applies equally to both downlink and uplink). Also, for purposes of
illustration, we have assumed that only slots 0 to 5 are available for
allocation (so we assume that slots 6 and 7 are being used for other mobiles).
There is a limitation of EDA that limits its efficiency when sharing resources
between different mobiles. The limitation is that dynamic allocation can only
grow \"backwards\", i.e. if the potentially transmitted slots are in the range
[_N, M_], where 0≤ _N_ ≤ _M_ ≤ 7, then for slot _k (N_ ≤ _k_ ≤ _M)_ to be
transmitted, all higher numbered slots (i.e. slots _k+1, k+2,..._ _M_) must
also be transmitted.
In the example, when using EDA, a \'fair\' allocation might be to give MS2 an
allocation starting at slot 0, and MS1 an allocation starting at slot 2. This
is shown in the top illustration in figure 393. With such an allocation it is
certain the MS2 can transmit at least 2 timeslots without blocking or being
blocked by MS1. Also, both MS\'s can potentially transmit 4 slots, which is
their maximum capability since they are multislot class 12 mobiles. But note
that if MS2 transmits even one slot, then MS1 cannot transmit more then 2
slots without mutual blocking; this is an inefficiency of EDA.
In the second part of the illustration the new concept is shown, Back to Back
Dynamic Allocation (B^2^DA). The new approach is that allocation can proceed
in an upward direction for some mobiles, but continue in the downward
direction for other mobiles as in the existing standards.
It is easily seen that using this approach the likelihood of one mobile
blocking the transmissions of the other is reduced; indeed in the example
shown, provided both mobiles have three or less slots allocated they cannot
block each other. However the number of timeslots required has not been
increased; all that is done is to use them more efficiently.
{width="6.136111111111111in" height="4.770138888888889in"}
Figure 393: Advantage of B^2^DA operation
Clearly if this were adopted by the 3GPP standards a number of other issues
would need to be addressed, for example mapping of USF to allocated timeslots
(analogous to Special Extended Dynamic Allocation) and compatibility issues.
Note that this example assumes that resources are restricted to some degree
and timeslot sharing between two mobiles is needed. If resources are not
scarce and TS6 and 7 are available an alternative would be to exclusively
allocate TS 6 and 7 to MS1. The general idea of GPRS is to allow sharing of
limited resources as efficiently as possible between multiple mobile stations.
### 13.1.1 Benefits of the Solution
The proposed improvement will increase the statistical multiplexing efficiency
of resource allocation on both the uplink and downlink during bursty packet
data flows. It therefore constitutes a potential improvement to the 3GPP GPRS
standards, enabling more efficient use of spectrum resources.
The benefit is likely to be greatest when a number of mobiles potentially have
simultaneous requirements for dynamically allocated uplink resources, and
uplink resources are limited due to the volume of traffic. An example
situation might be if two mobiles are simultaneously requesting a web page
download, or simultaneously servicing requests for data upload.
### 13.1.2 Details of Allocation Rule
For B2DA a new rule of allocation and USF monitoring is proposed as follows
which is illustrated below:
_\"The mobile station shall monitor the lowest numbered assigned PDCH. If the
mobile station detects an assigned USF value for an assigned PDCH on the
lowest numbered PDCH, the mobile station shall transmit RLC/MAC blocks on all
assigned PDCHs apart from the higher numbered assigned PDCHs.\"_
In the illustration below, 4 uplink PDCHs are assigned, from slot 0 to slot 3.
Therefore in this example the \'lowest numbered assigned PDCH\' is 0 and the
highest numbered assigned PDCH is 3. In order to distinguish the different
allocations, different USF values may be used.
{width="4.773611111111111in" height="3.779166666666667in"}
Figure 394: Illustration of B^2^DA allocation
Note that different USF values used to allow changing of dynamic allocations
could reduce the multiplexing flexibility.
## 13.2 USF and Timeslot Resources
A combination of USF and timeslot can be considered as a resource. There are 7
USF values for allocation to each mobile station on each timeslot, hence there
are 56 USF-TS resources available for sharing across various mobile stations.
Both Dynamic Allocation and Extended Dynamic Allocation schemes use _N_ USF-TS
resources, where _N_ is the number of uplink timeslots assigned to the mobile
stations. The situation is different with B^2^DA.
In the example in figure 394, the USF values (v0-v3) for all assigned
timeslots are transmitted on the lowest numbered assigned timeslots. It is
proposed that either:
1) the value USF=FREE would be transmitted on the other timeslots allocated to
the B^2^DA mobile, to prevent other mobiles using the uplink on those
timeslots; or
2) some other USF value that is not significant to any other mobile could be
transmitted (there are 7 such possible values apart from USF=FREE, and it is
unlikely that 7 mobiles would multiplex onto one timeslot).
In summary, the B^2^DA mobile makes use of 2*_N-1_ USF-TN resources, _N_ of
which are used exclusively for signalling allocation on the downlink on the
lowest numbered assigned timeslot and _N-1_ for preventing other mobiles using
the allocation on the remaining timeslots: . In the example in figure 394, The
USF values (v0-v3) are available and can be transmitted and used as normal by
another mobile on timeslots other than slot 0 (the lowest numbered timeslot
assigned to the B^2^DA mobile).
With B^2^DA the USF-TN resources are concentrated on lowest numbered assigned
timeslot and nearly twice the USF values are required. This may be considered
a restriction but the advantages out weigh the disadvantages. In any case,
with some other multislot class mobile stations it could be possible for the
MS to monitor the lowest two assigned timeslots for USF, allowing the USF-TN
resources to be distributed on two timeslots; this is for further study.
### 13.2.1 Co-existence with existing allocation schemes
In order that uplink resources can be allocated using dynamic allocation via
the USF, two conditions must apply:
  * the uplink resources are not also used by another mobile (since only > one mobile can transmit on a given slot);
  * the downlink slot on which the USF requires to be transmitted, in > order to allocate the desired uplink resources, is not required to > transmit the USF for another mobile.
In the following it is shown that B^2^DA and EDA can co-exist and produce
performance gains compared with homogenous allocations just using EDA,
although some combinations are shown not to be possible. The following table
shows possible configurations, where two mobiles are sharing slots 2 and 3
with timeslots 0, 1, 4 and 5 assigned to mobile 1 or mobile 2. In fact, the
following combinations are possible, by combining EDA and B^2^DA.

Note that very efficient uplink allocation is possible: specifically either
one of them can transmit 4 slots, while the other is still able to transmit 2
slots. This is not possible in the EDA example allocating the same number of
timeslots.
However, if EDA can only be combined with EDA, then only the following
combinations are possible. As can be seen, if mobile 1 transmits 3 or more
slots, mobile 2 cannot transmit any slots, and if mobile 2 transmits any slot,
mobile 1 cannot transmit more than 2 slots.

NOTE. In these cases uplink slot 3 required by both MS1 and MS2.
In conclusion, by suitable combinations with EDA, the use of B^2^DA can
provide superior sharing of the uplink than can be achieved with homogeneous
EDA allocation schemes.
## 13.3 Modelling Assumptions and Requirements
The proposal is likely to be beneficial when a number of users are employing
data oriented services based on GPRS.
In order to quantify the benefits of the proposal the following modelling
assumptions require to be specified:
  * Modelling assumptions of traffic activity factors for uplink data > services over GPRS. Note that detailed assumptions for uplink data > traffic model parameters can be found in [1].
### 13.3.1 Illustration
In the following four scenarios are provided to show the potential use and
advantages of B^2^DA. The following is assumed in all cases.
  * 6 slots are available for 2 mobiles.
  * Both are sending variable rate encoded video data at 15 frames per > sec (60 ms rate) with a video frame timing offset of 20 ms.
  * Assume that the data rate is dimensioned for \~80 % average loading, > i.e. 7 RLC blocks per video frame.
Scenario 1 shows that when data rates are fixed, resource sharing via EDA or
B^2^DA does not confer an advantage. Scenarios 2 and 3 show that resource
sharing using EDA confers an advantage in the presence of variable data rates.
Scenario 4 shows that B^2^DA confers an even greater advantage.
**Scenario 1:** This illustrates the case where there is no sharing of
resources, and no fluctuations in data rate.
The network assigns 3 slots to MS1, 3 slots to MS2, and the USF constantly
allows transmission in both cases (the \'spare\' blocks are transmitted with
repeated data). As can be seen, there is a constant delay from \'frame
available\' to \'frame transmitted\' is 60 ms.
Note that worst case delay from \'frame available\' to \'frame transmitted\'
is 60 ms. In this case B2DA does not provide any additional advantage compared
with EDA.
{width="6.34375in" height="5.510416666666667in"}
Figure 395: Scenario 1: No resource sharing, constant data rate
**Scenario 2:** The resource allocation is identical to scenario 1, but this
scenario shows the consequence of MS 2 wanting to send two 200 % \'overlong
frames\' in succession, i.e. two successive video frames requiring 21 RLC
blocks each. After this, average length frames are sent.
In this example the transmit delay is increased to 220ms. In scenario 3, it
will be shown how dynamic allocation improves this.
Note that the value of the Countdown Variable CV is shown for illustrative
purposes.
{width="6.46875in" height="3.9368055555555554in"}
Figure 396: Scenario 2: No resource sharing, sudden data rate peak for MS2
**Scenario 3:** In this scenario there is the same data rate peak as scenario
2, (MS 2 wanting to send two 200 % \'overlong frames\' in succession), but
resources are shared using EDA. It is seen that there is some improvement
regarding the peak transmit delay for MS2, but MS1 is severely impacted (in
Scenario 4 this problem is solved by using B^2^DA).
This scenario shows how: EDA can improve the maximum delay to MS2. It assumes
uneven assignment, i.e. MS1 assigned slots 0 to 2 using EDA, and MS2 is
assigned slots 2 to 5 using EDA (this allows 3-3 split without MS1 being
blocked by MS2).
The CV is read by network and allocation provided to after a delay of 2 Radio
blocks (i.e. 1 block for BS to decode the CV, 1 block to transmit USF
corresponding to the subsequent block). The assumed network policy is to
increase allocation of MS2 to 4 slots whenever CV≥5 (but with above time delay
of 2 Radio blocks).
Then by using this scheme, we reduce the max delay of MS2 to 180 ms (down from
220 ms). However, the maximum delay of MS1 is severely impacted and is
increased to 200 ms (from 80 ms).
{width="6.46875in" height="4.625in"}
Figure 397: Scenario 3:EDA, sudden data rate peak for MS2
**Scenario 4:** This shows the same data rate peak as scenarios 2 and 3, (MS 2
wanting to send two 200 % \'overlong frames\' in succession), but resources
are shared using B^2^DA. It is seen that this gives the most improvement in
the peak transmit delay. In this case the peak transmit delay for MS2 is 180
ms (identical with scenario 3), and the peak delay for MS1 is only 80 ms
(considerably less than scenario 3).
{width="6.46875in" height="4.625in"}
Figure 398: Scenario 4: B^2^DA, sudden data rate peak for MS2
**Conclusion:** The above scenarios show how B^2^DA can provide a performance
benefit in the presence of fluctuating data rates.
## 13.4 Performance Characterization
Since a video stream is isochronous there is a \"hard\" deadline for every
video frame by which time it must have been transmitted; any later and it
becomes a missing frame in the video output. According to [2] the number of
erased frames must be limited to at most 2 %, but the delay is also a key
component of the QoS. In this analysis we assume the only reason for packet
loss is excess transmit buffer delay; if the frame spends too long in the
transmit buffer, it is thrown away. Provided the data is sent in acknowledged
mode this is a realistic model.
The following figure is a typical extract from the 10 hour simulation sequence
of two mobile stations transmitting MPEG4 data. For illustrative purposes it
was assumed that two mobiles (MS1 and MS2) were sharing six available slots
per radio block, as illustrated in figure 393\. MS1 and MS2 were supplied with
independent video sources and these were transmitted using both the EDA and
the B^2^DA schemes to enable direct comparison. The coding scheme selected was
MCS-1. The MPEG4 video source was scaled to represent the bits per video frame
that would typically be found with QCIF video and streamed at a rate of 30
frames per second. For both EDA and B^2^DA, the allocation was identical (MS2
slots 0 to 2, MS1 slots 2 to 5). If MS2 CV was ≥ 5, and MS2 CV> MS1 CV, then
allocation of MS2 was increased to 4 slots.
To assist comparison of EDA and B^2^DA, a trace of the number of pending RLC
blocks in the uplink transmit buffer is shown for MS1 in figure 399. Similarly
figure 400 shows the data for MS2. It can be seen from these results that
B^2^DA gives a useful reduction in transmission delays when peak loads occur.

Figure 400: Trace of Uplink transmit buffer length for MS2s
### 13.4.1 Cumulative Probability Distribution- MCS-1, QCIF 30 FPS
In order to quantify this benefit the cumulative probability distribution
function of the transmit buffer length of MS2 for 10 hours of MPEG4 is shown
below in figure 401. The CDF in this figure shows the probability that
transmit buffer length is less than given number of RLC blocks. This indicates
that when only EDA is used, the transmission delay has a 2 % probability of
exceeding 110 RLC block periods (2.2 seconds, which actually exceeds the time
delay requirement stated in [2]). By contrast, when B^2^DA is used, then
transmission delay has a 2 % probability of exceeding 40 RLC Block periods
(0.8 seconds). Assuming that packets with excess delay are deleted, and 2 %
loss is acceptable, it is clear that the B^2^DA scheme more than halves the
required delay.

Figure 401: CDF of transmission buffer length for MS2 (QCIF 30 FPS)
As expected there is no significant difference in performance for MS1, since
in both cases MS1 is using EDA, and only MS2 uses B^2^DA (figure 402). The
performance trend is very similar between MS1, and MS2 when using B^2^DA,
showing that MS1 and MS2 experience the same QoS when B^2^DA is used in
conjunction with EDA. This is clearly not the case when only EDA is used.

### 13.4.2 Cumulative Probability Distribution- MCS-5, CIF 15 FPS
In order to illustrate that the benefits apply to more than one coding scheme
and configuration, analogous results are shown in figure 404 for a situation
where two mobiles transmit CIF at 15 frames per second using MCS-5.
Performance advantage is greater than 50 %.

### 13.4.3 Summary of Performance Characterization
Using EDA alone, it would not be possible to share uplink resources between
more than one mobile when transmitting variable rate delay sensitive real time
streaming data such as MPEG4 video and expect both mobiles to receive a
satisfactory QoS. For example, if each mobile individually needed 4 uplink
slots, then the requirement for two mobiles would be 8 uplink slots. However
using B^2^DA it is possible to achieve 25 % multiplexing and achieve the same
QoS; rather than 8 uplink slots, only 6 uplink slots are needed
To summarize, there is a 25 % improvement in data throughput efficiency in the
given scenario.
## 13.5 Discussion: Improvement of B^2^DA
### 13.5.1 Introduction
In order to enhance the resource allocation in GERAN Evolution, a new dynamic
allocation scheme, Back to Back Dynamic Allocation, is presented above. B^2^DA
can grow assigned uplink timeslots \"forwards\" and reduce the mutual blocking
when sharing resources between different mobiles during burst packet data
flows.
As mentioned above, with B^2^DA the number of USF values assigned to a mobile
station is equal to the number of assigned uplink PDCHs, and these USF values
are different from each other and concentrated on the lowest numbered
timeslot. This will reduce the multiplexing flexibility as more than one USF
value may be needed by one mobile on the lowest numbered timeslot while with
existing schemes only one USF value is needed for one mobile on each assigned
timeslot.
This subclause contains a proposal which aims to improve the multiplexing
flexibility of B^2^DA by using fewer amounts of USF values, and meanwhile not
impact the efficient resource allocation as B^2^DA. subclause 13.5.22 presents
the detailed allocation scheme. Subclause 13.5.3 shows the benefits of this
solution. Conclusions are given in subclause 13.5.4.
### 13.5.2 Details of proposed allocation scheme
#### 13.5.2.1 New allocation rule based on B^2^DA
The main idea is that, the network could reduce the number of USF values
allocated to a mobile station, each different assigned USF value would
represent a different allocation and one of these assigned USF values should
indicate an allocation of all assigned uplink PDCHs. Due to the reduction of
USF values, an adjusting rule of allocation and USF monitoring is proposed as
follows.
The mobile station shall monitor the lowest numbered assigned PDCH. When an
assigned USF value is detected on the lowest numbered PDCH, the mobile station
shall transmit RLC/MAC blocks on all assigned PDCHs whose timeslot number is
lower or equal to the corresponding assigned PDCH.
Considering a multislot class 12 mobile station, 4 uplink PDCHs are assigned,
from slot 0 to slot 3. Only three different USF values, v0, v1 and v2,
corresponding to PDCH0, PDCH1 and PDCH3 respectively, are assigned to the
mobile station. USF value v0 indicates an allocation that the mobile can
transmit RLC/MAC blocks on PDCH0, while v1 indicates PDCH0 to PDCH1, and v2
indicates all assigned PDCHs from PDCH0 to PDCH3. Figure 405 shows that three
different USF values may be used to allocate PDCHs dynamically.
{width="5.780555555555556in" height="3.7402777777777776in"}
Figure 405: Illustration of the proposed allocation based on three USF values
#### 13.5.2.1 USF resource
The amount of USF values remaining unused on the lowest numbered assigned PDCH
will influence the potential applicability of B^2^DA. However, it is possible
to reduce the amount of USF values needed. The network can determine the
amount of USF values needed in this allocation and establish the mapping of
USF onto assigned PDCH according to the current situation including the USF
recourse, the requesting service and etc. When the USF resource is limited,
only two USF values are available for the situation illustrated in Figure
below. One possible solution for the mapping of USF onto PDCH is shown in
figure 406.
{width="5.686805555555556in" height="2.8340277777777776in"}
Figure 406: Illustration of the proposed allocation based on two USF values
### 13.5.3 Benefits of the Solution
The improvement reduces the amount of USF values needed on the lowest numbered
assigned PDCH. This will increase the statistical multiplexing efficiency of
resource allocation when a number of mobile stations simultaneously require
for dynamically allocated uplink resources. This allocation can also co-exist
with extended dynamic allocation to acquire performance gains compared with
homogenous allocations just using EDA.
Elaborate allocation may be impossible with the proposed allocation in some
situation. For example, it is impossible to allocate 3 uplink PDCHs in the
instance as shown in figures 405 and 406. However, the proposed allocation
make it possible for the BSS to use B^2^DA in some USF resource limited
situation.
Note that usage of USF-timeslot resources is increased in comparison to other
dynamic allocation schemes, which require only _N_ exclusive USF resources, by
a factor of 100 %.

# 14 Modified MBMS Service
## 14.1 Introduction
Release 6 adds new components to the GSM/EDGE air interface in support of
Multicast Broadcast Multimedia Subsystem (MBMS) operation, including MBMS-
specific re-transmission protocols and enhanced outer coding techniques.
Although new and efficient competitive technologies are becoming available for
multimedia service delivery, re-use of the existing GSM infrastructure and
mobile designs remains a highly cost-effective option for multimedia service
delivery. Enhanced MBMS offers spectrally efficient operation in synchronous
GSM networks through simulcast transmission in single-frequency network
fashion. Provided the composite multipath channel impulse response is within
the capabilities of the receiver, much higher signal-noise ratios (SNR\'s) can
be achieved than for unicast traffic enabling high broadcast network spectral
efficiency [1].
Note that use-cases may be needed to justify the introduction of modified MBMS
with SFN in GERAN, since MBMS in GERAN is not intended to be a competing
technology with e.g. DVB-H, but, conversely, a complementary technology.
## 14.2 Concept description
Contemporary network designs for the delivery of spectrally efficient
broadcast services - such as DVB-H and MediaFLO, and even hybrid systems such
as 3GPP2 BCMCS simulcast transmissions from individual cells in single-
frequency network (SFN) fashion where the participating cells support
sufficiently precise time- and frequency-synchronization to construct a single
multipath channel from the network to the mobile device consisting of the sum
of the individual per-cell channel impulse responses. Provided the composite
multipath channel impulse response length is sufficiently small , broadcast
receiver performance is limited not by co-channel interference, but rather by
a) base station (BS) and MS implementation impairments (such as transmitter
non-linearities, receiver thermal and phase noise, quadrature error etc.), b)
adjacent channel interference, and c) any residual excess time-delay
components.
## 14.3 Modelling Assumptions and Requirements
To evaluate the performance of single frequency network operation, the
concatenated multipath channel experienced by the receiver must be
characterised and then performance compared with unicast transmission. The
following subclauses deal with modelling both methods of transmission in the
same network for fair comparison.
### 14.3.1 Channel Modelling
The Root Mean Square (RMS) delay spread measure provides a crude means of
assessing the amount of time dispersion in the resulting SFN. In order to
assess the effect of the SFN operation on RMS delay spread, _System
Configuration 2_ defined in the GERAN SAIC Feasibility Study ([2], Clause 4)
was used as the basis for assessing the RMS delay spread distribution of a
simulated network. The primary parameters of the simulated network are given
below in table 215.
Key parameters to note are the cell radius (1 000 m) and BS per-carrier
radiated power level (43 dBm).
Figure 407 (left plot) shows an example composite Multipath Intensity Profile
(MIP), with an RMS delay spread of 2.39 μs, constructed by combining the
delayed MIP associated with each cell (i.e. sector) when the per-cell MIP is
the 3GPP Typical Urban (TU) channel. The particular MIP shown in 407 was
generated at position A in the network topology of figure 408. Figure 407
(right plot) shows the effective MIP generated by re-distributing the
composite MIP onto a uniformly-sampled grid at 16x the GSM symbol rate. This
approach will be used later to permit direct assessment of equalizer
performance in the resulting composite channel.

Clearly, the composite MIP changes with each location in the network due to
variation in path loss, shadow fading, antenna angle, relative BTS delay and
so on. Figures 409 and 410 show the distribution of the composite RMS delay
spread for all locations in the simulated network where sector 0 (see figure
408) of the centre cell is the best-serving cell (the serving cell distance is
therefore distance to sector 0 of the centre site) and when a) the per-cell
multipath channel is respectively TU and flat, and b) when all network cells
are assumed to participate in the SFN. By comparing the figures, it can be
seen that the distribution of RMS delay spread is dominated not by the per-
cell MIP, but rather by the SFN dimensions.

The RMS delay spread of the standard 3GPP GSM (TU, HT) and ITU channel models
(PA, PB, VA, VB) also appear in figures 409 and 410. It can be seen that the
composite MIP of the broadcast network is generally distributed between the TU
and HT RMS delay spread values of 1.02μs and 5.10μs respectively. The median
delay spread for the broadcast network is 2.3μs for the TU channel case, and
2.0μs for the flat channel case. Accordingly, since GSM MS receiver
conformance testing includes the HT channel condition, there is some
indication that contemporary GSM mobile receivers could maintain good link
performance in the presence of SFN-induced delay spread. This suggests a more
detailed comparison with conventional re-use based interference avoidance
broadcast modes.
### 14.3.2 Broadcast Network C/I and C/N Distributions
At the outset of the original GERAN MBMS work [3] the channel to interference
plus noise ratios (CINR) characterising GERAN networks in a variety of re-use
patterns were studied. The CINR distributions for the centre site (all
sectors) of _System Configuration 2_ of [2] assuming an MS noise-equivalent
bandwidth of 200kHz appear in figure 411, where the triplet _(p,q,r)_
corresponds to:
a) _p_ \- site re-use group dimension;
b) _q_ \- number of sectors per site;
c) _r_ \- number of carrier frequency groups;
and where MS receiver impairments and BTS transmitter impairments are
neglected, but the BTS antenna front-back ratio (20 dB) is included (as
evidenced by the _(1,3,1)_ reuse pattern whose asymptotic CINR is equal to the
front-back ratio minus 3 dB).
{width="6.51875in" height="1.976388888888889in"}
Figure 411: CINR distribution vs. re-use pattern
Assuming, say, 95 % broadcast channel coverage is required, the 5 %-ile CINR
values for each re-use pattern appear in table 216. Note that for the system
configuration parameters studied here, network operation is substantially
interference-limited and so the CINR and CIR distributions are virtually
identical.

* * *
Re-use Pattern 5%-ile CINR (dB) (1,3,1) -4.2 (1,3,3) 1.5 (4,3,12) 10.7
* * *
Of course, in contemporary network design, the 5%-ile CINR values of table 216
are moderated by various techniques including fraction loading, discontinuous
transmission, power control and so on. Nevertheless, application of these
techniques here would reduce area spectral efficiency. Accordingly, for
simplicity, the present analysis does not consider those approaches.
Further assuming that all of the cells in the simulated system are
participating in the broadcast SFN, the performance-limiting C/I ratio is
replaced with a signal to noise ratio distribution, or more usefully for link
performance assessment, the ratio {width="0.375in" height="0.19375in"} of
coded (i.e. transmitted) bit energy to receiver thermal noise density. Note
again that it is assumed for the present purpose that other performance-
limiting aspects - such as transmitter/receiver impairments, and adjacent
channel interference - are neglected.
The resulting distribution of {width="0.375in" height="0.19375in"} for the
center site (sector 0) of the simulated network appears in figure 412. It can
be seen that the 5%-ile points for {width="0.375in" height="0.19375in"} at the
GMSK and 8PSK coded bit rates are 38.6 dB and 33.8 dB respectively, although
of course in this case, the broadcast channel has a larger delay spread than
the underlying cell multipath channel.

for centre cell
Accordingly, while the optimum approach to establishing broadcast channel
coverage is to apply an appropriate link-system mapping at each point in the
simulated network and then assessing the distribution of broadcast channel
block error probability, a crude means of establishing broadcast channel
coverage is to compare:
a) _Re-use Mode_ \- interference-limited performance at the
{width="0.2777777777777778in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} ratios specified
in table 215 for the TU channel, and
b) _SFN Mode_ \- noise-limited performance at {width="1.0965277777777778in"
height="0.19375in"} for GMSK and 8PSK respectively, using a example broadcast
channel such as that of figure 407.
Note that in the SFN mode b), however, the RMS delay spread of the composite
MIP example of figure 407 is approximately equal to the median RMS delay
spread of figure 409. Accordingly, an example composite MIP with larger delay
spread equal to the 3.6 μs 95 %-ile point in figure 409 was selected. This MIP
- which had an RMS delay spread of 3.68 μs (still 1.4 μs less RMS delay spread
than the HT channel) - appears in figure 413. Note that the simultaneous
assumption of 5 %-ile SNR and 95 %-ile delay spread is potentially
pessimistic, although in practice these parameters would be correlated.

## 14.4 Receiver Link Performance
Table 217 lists {width="0.2777777777777778in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}
and {width="0.3888888888888889in" height="0.19375in"} values required for
operation at 10% radio link control (RLC) block error rate (BLER) under the
SFN mode and re-use mode defined above for the example MIP\'s defined in
figures 407 and 413 respectively. The specified values were derived from
single-port receiver link simulations, but obviously dual-port (MSRD)
receivers will offer better performance. Note that the selection of RLC block
BLER was based on an assessment of potential application layer coding gain and
H-ARQ, but this value could be further refined. Note also that the simulated
values are ideal, since they disregard several significant implementation
elements, but they do provide a useful guide to performance.
Here, it is assumed that the interference experienced in the conventional re-
use case of figure 411 is structured according to the multi-interferer DARP
model of TS 45.005, Annex L. For each MIP, ideal frequency hopping at 3km/h
was applied.
Table 217: {width="0.2777777777777778in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} and
{width="0.3888888888888889in" height="0.19375in"} values required for 10%
PDTCH BLER.
{width="3.142361111111111in" height="2.0770833333333334in"}
Comparing the 95%-ile {width="0.2777777777777778in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} values of table 215 with the required targets
of table 217 suggest that for the conventional reuse system only relatively
relaxed re-use patterns such as the _(4,3,12)_ pattern are feasible at the
required BLER. For the _(4,3,12)_ pattern, MCS-2 is feasible. MCS-2 delivers
an RLC PDU payload of 226 bits, which - neglecting H-ARQ re-transmissions -
supports a per-cell throughput on the PDTCH logical channel of
{width="2.736111111111111in" height="0.20833333333333334in"} where
{width="0.16666666666666666in" height="0.20833333333333334in"} is the radio
frame duration of 4.615ms. For the _(4,3,12)_ re-use factor, this corresponds
to an area spectral efficiency of {width="1.9166666666666667in"
height="0.18055555555555555in"}.
Figure 412 and the 5%-ile 8PSK coded bit {width="0.375in" height="0.19375in"}
of 33.8dB suggests that - again neglecting adjacent channel interference
effects and BS/MS implementation SNR limitations - MCS-9 could be feasible for
the median MIP of figure 407. MCS-9 delivers an RLC PDU payload of 1188 bits,
and would therefore support a per-carrier throughput of
{width="2.8465277777777778in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}. Since this
could nominally be supported by a single carrier SFN, the area spectral
efficiency is {width="1.7361111111111112in" height="0.18055555555555555in"}.
This represents an improvement in area spectral efficiency of
{width="0.8333333333333334in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}-fold. It is
again noted that the assumption of the _(4,3,12)_ pattern may be a
conservative assumption, and that the use of \'tighter\' re-use patterns (such
as _(1,3,1)_ or _(1,3,3)_) with fraction loading etc. could result in higher
spectral efficiencies for the re-use mode, but such modifications are not
expected to match the spectral efficiency of the SFN.
The 95%-ile MIP of figure 413 gives marginally worse performance, suggesting
support of only MCS-8 may be feasible at the 10 % RLC block error rate. This
would slightly reduce the overall SFN spectral efficiency, but would not
radically alter the conclusions.
## 14.5 Radio Resource Management
A number of options could be available for providing radio resources to
support a GSM SFN broadcast mode.
In the simplest approach, one or more non-hopping radio frequency channels
could be dedicated on a network-wide basis or over a local set
{width="0.1527777777777778in" height="0.1527777777777778in"} of cells to
support the SFN, with a common training sequence code (TSC) applied to the
common channel(s) at each participating cell (the TSC need not be tied to the
Base Station Colour Codes, or BCC\'s). When the SFN is applied substantially
over the entire network, there would appear to be relatively few TSC planning
issues associated with such a deployment. When the SFN is constructed over a
local set {width="0.1527777777777778in" height="0.1527777777777778in"} of
cells, TSC planning could be required at the edge of the SFN, but this
challenge appears similar to conventional TSC planning (if used). In order to
prevent adjacent channel interference of the BCCH pattern, the SFN radio
channel or channels could be located non-adjacent to the BCCH carriers. Note
that SFN operation would not be applicable to BCCH carrier frequencies since
the SFN apparent _(1,3,1)_ re-use pattern would deviate from conventional
_(3,3,9)_ or _(4,3,12)_ (or larger) patterns, leading to an unallowed
variation in the MS-observed RSSI on the BCCH carrier during timeslots devoted
to broadcast use.
One drawback with such a configuration, however, is that an entire carrier
frequency would be dedicated to the SFN. This could consume an excessive
amount of radio frequency or BTS transceiver (TRX) resources in lightly
resourced cells. As an alternative, individual timeslots on each non-hopping
radio channel could be associated with the SFN on a per-timeslot basis,
permitting improved granularity of radio resource assignment to the broadcast
service. Of course, the associated SFN timeslot assignments would need to be
coordinated between the participating cells in set
{width="0.1527777777777778in" height="0.1527777777777778in"}, but the required
TRX hardware resources would be available for other logical channels (TCH/AxS,
PDTCH, etc.) on timeslots not dedicated to SFN operation. For example, similar
to conventional practice during the BCCH timeslot, the Mobile Allocation (MA)
of MS\'s receiving a hopping TCH/AxS logical channel could be modified to
exclude SFN-dedicated radio channels in any particular timeslot.
Neither of these approaches support, however, the use of frequency hopping
which would entail a loss in performance for lower coding rates such as MCS5
and MCS6. Clearly, unidirectional broadcast services generally allow larger
interleaving delays - and so improved time diversity - compared to real time
services. This potentially allows the loss of hopping-induced frequency
diversity benefits to be overcome. Reuse, however, of the current set of EDGE
PDTCH MCS block structures (and 20 ms TTI) would minimise the impact of SFN
operation on both the base and mobile station implementations.
Notwithstanding, therefore, the marginal benefit (and occasional performance
loss) of frequency hopping at very high code rates (e.g. MCS-4, MCS-9) the
application of frequency hopping to a GSM SFN could offer performance
benefits.
Permitting SFN frequency hopping over a set of cells
{width="0.1527777777777778in" height="0.1527777777777778in"} in a network
supporting intra-cell orthogonal hopping such as GSM presents some obvious
challenges. In order to maximise compatibility with existing specifications,
the application of a common Hopping Sequence Number (HSN) and common TSC to
the SFN over the set of participating cells {width="0.1527777777777778in"
height="0.1527777777777778in"} appears feasible. Contention or \'collisions\'
with other non-orthogonal transmissions from each cell could be handled by
either a) defining a set of rules to permit arbitration of physical channel
contention, or b) in the case of BTS\' equipped with more than one transmit
antenna (to support, for example, delay diversity), permit the broadcast burst
to be transmitted on one antenna, and the contending burst on the second
antenna.
Note that the impact on existing frequency planning need to be evaluated,
since:
1\. one or more non-hopping radio frequency channels are needed even in a NW
fully supporting FH;
2\. the SFN frequency allocation needs to take into account the BCCH carrier
allocation.
Further, the worsening of radio performance for all the users whose FH set
size is reduced, due to the introduction of SFN (without FH) in a NW fully
supporting FH, needs to be evaluated as well as any increase in blocking
probability in the CS domain and any increase in packet transfer delay in the
PS domain needs.
## 14.6 Impacts to the Mobile Station
If the existing PDTCH MCS are retained for use in a GSM SFN broadcast channel
mode, there would appear to be marginal impact to the MS RF subsystem
specification, with the exception of the ability of the equalizer to deal with
SFN-induced delay spread. However, as discussed in subclause 6.4, for
contemporary medium- to small-cell GSM network deployments where spectral
efficiency is most critical, the resulting composite channel delay spread does
not appear to exceed the capability of current-generation MS\'.
## 14.7 Impacts to the BSS
If the existing PDTCH MCS are retained for use in a GSM SFN broadcast channel
mode, there would appear to be marginal impact on the BTS hardware, with the
exception of the frequency hopping case. Existing transmitter designs capable
of supporting error vector magnitudes consistent with MCS-9 transmission can
clearly support adequate transmitter waveform qualities for MCS-9 delivery
over SFN.
## 14.8 Impacts to the Core Network
Modified MBMS is seen as a feature that will enhance the performance of
synchronous networks. It is not suitable for use in asynchronous networks.
## 14.9 Impacts to the Specification
The specifications listed in table 218 will be impacted by Modified MBMS.

# 15 Uplink throughput enhancements with low standard impact
## 15.1 MS multislot capability switching
### 15.1.1 Introduction
For the downlink, two enhancements have been agreed as part of GERAN
Evolution: Downlink dual carrier (see clause 7) doubles the peak data rate,
and MSRD (see clause 6) increases both spectrum efficiency and data rate, the
latter in particular at the cell edge. For balance between downlink and
uplink, it would be desirable to find also an uplink enhancement that meets
the objectives of the FS. Since (almost all) BTS have 2 Rx antennas with
sufficiently low correlation, spectrum efficiency is already high in the
uplink, compared with the downlink. Hence for the uplink, a method to increase
data rates has higher priority than a method for higher spectrum efficiency.
Today, the typical EGPRS multislot class is 10 although the GSM standard
allows for more than 2 uplink slots. If a few obstacles are removed and if
some new multislot classes are defined, handsets supporting much higher uplink
data rates can be brought onto the market without radical changes of the air
interface.
### 15.1.2 Timeslot allocation
For type 1 MS which cannot transmit and receive at the same time, 6 uplink
timeslots are a realistic limit if one timeslot is needed for the downlink,
e.g. to transmit ACK/NACK messages. The following examples are based on a
downlink dual carrier MS since MS supporting more than 4 Tx slots can be
expected to support downlink dual carrier, too.

In order not to require too short synthesiser lock time, the local oscillator
for the Tx should be used for the monitoring in the following TDMA frame since
monitoring need not start right at the beginning of the burst, and a small
phase error does not matter either.
For DTM however, the synthesisers must be able to change the frequency between
the end of the down-ramping and the beginning of an Rx burst. Furthermore, the
time for monitoring may be shorter than one burst because of timing advance.

* * *
Relaxations for BSIC decoding like those in 3GPP TS 45.008 may be needed.
To support 6 uplink timeslots and at the same time more than 2 downlink
timeslots, the MS would need to be type 2 (full-duplex).
For applications such as Netmeeting, web browsing or file upload/download
where either the uplink or the downlink clearly dominates, type 1 MS (half-
duplex) are sufficient. Networks monitor which direction needs more bandwidth
and they adapt the number of uplink and downlink timeslots accordingly.
For bidirectional video telephony however, high uplink and downlink data rates
are needed simultaneously. The uplink transmission would either be limited to
4 timeslots (see subclause 7.6.1), or a full-duplex MS or a MS supporting dual
carrier also in the uplink would be needed.
### 15.1.3 Full-duplex MS
When either the receiver or the transmitter is inactive, the duplex filter can
be bypassed. However, during simultaneous reception and transmission, the
duplex filter causes considerable insertion loss in both directions.
In the downlink, the duplex filter insertion loss and the Tx noise in the Rx
band will lower the sensitivity. However, this desensitisation can now be
compensated by the new feature MSRD. The intention of the multislot classes
13...18 was to allow for full-duplex operation. As long as the radio
requirements do not take inevitable hardware limitations into account, the
specified feature will never be implemented. Hence the sensitivity
requirements for Rx slots which overlap with Tx slots should be relaxed by
e.g. 4 dB for type 2 MS supporting MSRD. MSRD need not be supported
simultaneously with downlink dual carrier, the more so as the downlink
throughput also benefits from full-duplex operation.
For full-duplex operation, the relevant timeslot assignments will have at
least 2 Tx slots. Hence a multislot power reduction by 3 dB would be allowed
anyway if MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE 0 was chosen. This means that a lower output
power due to the duplex filter insertion loss will not require a completely
new relaxation. The objective should be that full-duplex MS need only reduce
their nominal maximum output power by 3 dB, and this should be permitted. Even
if the actual insertion loss of a duplex filter sample exceeds these 3 dB by
1...2 dB, the output power will still fit into the tolerance range.
The reduction may be limited to those Tx timeslots which overlap with Rx
slots.
For further analysis of full-duplex MS, see subclause 15.2.
### 15.1.4 Tx power
From Rel-5 onwards, the MS sends multislot power profiles to the network which
indicate for each modulation separately the need for lower output power under
multislot uplink operation.
With regard to average current drawn from the battery and radiated power, a
multislot power reduction will probably continue to be needed for GMSK, at
least for more than two uplink slots.
For 8-PSK however, the output power of the usual power class E2 is much lower
than the typical GMSK output power. Hence overheating - which was the reason
for the introduction of multislot power reduction - is for 8-PSK a little bit
less critical than for GMSK. Moreover, the risk that an MS might in the end
overheat if it was operated under extreme conditions is not a convincing
reason to always apply an output power reduction and a lower multislot class,
even at normal conditions where overheating would be no issue. If overheating
really becomes imminent, the MS has still the possibility to reduce its RAC to
that RAC which it would have declared otherwise right from the beginning.
Currently the mobile stations have to declare a RAC which, even at 55 °C
ambient temperature, is sustainable over more than 15 minutes (test case
13.15.3). This makes it impossible to exploit the possibility to transmit on a
higher number of timeslots, under normal conditions as well as under extreme
conditions for the initial duration as long as heating is not a problem.
Hence it is suggested to usually signal 8-PSK_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE 3, which
allows for an 8-PSK output power of:
* * *
# uplink slots low band high band 6 27 dBm 26 dBm 8 26 dBm 26 dBm
* * *
(Even the GMSK output power should not be higher than what is listed above.)
Uplink dual carrier MS can support even more than 8 effective uplink slots.
For designs using two PAs, the 8-PSK output power of each carrier should be
also according to range defined in 3GPP TS 45.005 for power class E2 with
8‑PSK_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE 3.
Type 2 MS would have to reduce the maximum 8-PSK power to 24 dBm (±
tolerances) in low band and 23 dBm (± tolerances) in high band during full-
duplex operation. This reduction should be allowed without forcing type 2 MS
to generally declare a lower power class or a lower multislot power profile.
### 15.1.5 Data rate increase
Under interference limited conditions where Tx power is not limiting the
throughput, the throughput will scale with the number of uplink timeslots. If
an MS supporting 6 uplink slots is compared with an MS supporting 4 uplink
slots, the link-level throughput increase is 50 %.
In many cases, the link-level throughput gain will be higher under coverage
limited conditions than under interference limited conditions since a higher
8-PSK multislot output power than assumed in the reference will be achievable.
In addition to the higher number of uplink slots, the throughput per timeslot
will also be higher if higher Tx power is used. This is illustrated based on
figure 2 of [2] (coverage limited scenario, -98 dBm) where the green curve
represents today\'s EGPRS with maximum multislot output power reduction and
where the red curve shows what the combination of full Tx power (8-PSK only)
with up to 6 timeslots can achieve - unless the MS overheats. The blue curves
were left in the diagram just to show that a similar throughput can be
achieved without radical changes of GSM\'s physical layer.

Figure 414: Uplink throughput comparison
### 15.1.6 Data rate increase at the cell edge
In this subclause, the throughput curves of [1] and the assumption of an Rx
level of -109 dBm at the cell edge [1] are used.
The MS is assumed to support 6 uplink slots 8-PSK without output power
reduction. This MS is compared with a reference MS that supports 4 uplink
slots with 6 dB power reduction as in [1]. The MS\'s single slot output power
is assumed to be 27 dBm for 8-PSK and 33 dBm for GMSK, i.e. 6 dB higher. Hence
the Rx level at the BTS will rise by 6 dB after a link adaptation from 8-PSK
to GMSK.

The throughput gain amounts to 73 %. However, in the case of overheating, the
MS would have to reduce its multislot class and fall back to the baseline (0 %
gain). The requirement for mean bit rate increase by 50 % at the cell edge is
exceeded if the gain of 73 % is available on average during 70 % of the time.
Under normal conditions (25 °C, no load mismatch), it is expected that a
typical MS won\'t overheat. Under extreme conditions (55 °C, no load
mismatch), it is expected that an MS could continuously transmit on 6
timeslots at 27 dBm 8‑PSK for 10 minutes before it overheats. At 90 kbit/s,
this would correspond to an upload of 6 MB. For files \ 8 MB, the throughput gain would be \ 8 MB (or uninterrupted sending of more than 25 MMS at
300 kB each) are not deemed typical, we conclude that the requirement of 50 %
higher mean bit rate at the cell edge will be fulfilled for the uplink.
### 15.1.7 Impacts on mobile stations
The MS needs to have one or more temperature sensors to detect if overheating
is imminent. However, a temperature sensor in the RF part is already state of
the art.
Under normal conditions - 25 °C and 50 Ω load at the antenna port - handsets
can be designed to support up to six 8-PSK modulated Tx slots at 27 dBm
without overheating. However, in the unlikely event that at least two of the
following adverse, unusual circumstances coincide:
  * high ambient temperature;
  * substantial load mismatch;
  * long uplink transmissions without interruption.
The MS will have to downgrade either the multislot or the power class by a RAU
with the new MS RAC IE [3], the reduction of the multislot class being much
more efficient than a power reduction. Although a downgrade of RAC is expected
to be a rare exception, MS manufacturers need to be sure that the network
reacts to a multislot class reduction within a reasonable period of time.
Otherwise, the mobile station might have to stop transmitting. To avoid such a
situation, it is suggested to add an appropriate network test in 3GPP TS
51.021.
The peak current will not increase, but the average current that the battery
needs to support will increase, depending on the multislot class, in
particular for type 2 MS.
Typical EGPRS PAs are specified for supporting the maximum GMSK output power
(without multislot power reduction) at a duty cycle of 50 %. Hence it can be
expected that the support of 8-PSK at 27 dBm with a duty cycle of 75 %
requires only an amendment of the PA specification, not a PA redesign.
The matching of PA and antenna should be designed such that an antenna
mismatch, e.g. by a piece of metal close to the antenna, does not increase the
heat dissipation in the MS. This may be not achievable for all channels, in
particular for quad-band terminals, but even under load mismatch, the
transmission can at least start with the full data rate.
Faster or more synthesizers will be needed to support more than 5 uplink
slots, in particular if more than one downlink slot shall be supported at the
same time (e.g. for DTM). Progress in digital frequency synthesis such as fast
locking fractional-N synthesisers allows for faster switching between
reception, transmission and monitoring.
New multislot classes need to be supported by the chipset and the software.
Today, most chipsets support multislot class 12.
For uplink dual carrier MS, see clause 7.
#### 15.1.7.1 Full-duplex MS
Full-duplex MS will need a duplex filter with bypasses for Rx and Tx
direction, and Rx and Tx synthesisers will have to run at the same time. (For
the GSM-R band, a duplex filter may be not feasible.)
The I/Q interface between the baseband and the transceiver chip needs to
support simultaneous reception and transmission.
If the antenna switch causes harmonics during Tx operation, the harmonics
could mix down with blockers, and blocking performance might be lower during
full-duplex operation. In this case, another relaxation of the GSM
specification could be required.
### 15.1.8 Impacts on the BSS
New multislot classes need to be implemented.
### 15.1.9 Impacts on the core network
No impacts expected.
### 15.1.10 Impacts on the specification
Since the standard already allows:
  * different output power reductions for GMSK and 8-PSK from Rel-5 > onwards;
  * the possibility to reduce the multislot or power class if really > needed; and
  * full-duplex MS;
  * only a few amendments are necessary;
  * definition of new multislot classes: 3GPP TS 45.002;

### 15.1.11 Summary
In order to increase the uplink throughput, it is proposed that half-duplex MS
use up to 6 uplink timeslots and that full-duplex MS use up to 8 uplink
timeslots. Half-duplex EGPRS handsets with RLC/MAC uplink data rates of up to
355 kbit/s and full-duplex EGPRS handsets with RLC/MAC uplink data rates of up
to 473 kbit/s will be feasible. Even legacy GPRS networks can benefit from the
higher number of timeslots. Moreover, the coverage of 8-PSK multislot uplink
transmissions will become larger since multislot output power reduction
usually need not be applied. This will help EGPRS extend the coverage of 3G
services. In the rare case of imminent overheating, the MS can dynamically
adapt its multislot or power class by a routing area update.
This proposal is based on features which are already part of the GSM standard,
but which should be amended in order to become usable. Only a few changes in
the standard are required which can be completed in time for Release 7.
## 15.2 Type 2 MS Implementation
### 15.2.1 Concept Description
Full duplex operation is defined as the simultaneous transmission and
reception of a signal. This technique requires a duplex filter in order to
isolate receive and transmit paths.
Small ceramic, SAW, Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR), and Bulk Acoustic
Wave (BAW) based duplexers are available today and exhibit reasonably good
isolation in a small package, which improves the possibility of implementing a
type 2 mobile station. In addition, advanced receiver techniques such as DARP
and mobile station receiver diversity (see clause 6) can help to overcome the
loss in receiver sensitivity.
Enabling a type 2 mobile offers the possibility of transmitting more uplink
slots while not affecting the downlink slot allocation. Type 2 mobiles also
permit full flexibility in scheduling uplink timeslots (one or more) which can
ease scheduling restrictions.

### 15.2.2a Interference Frequencies
#### 15.2.2a.1 Introduction and Purpose
One of the types of interference in the receive band of a type 2 GSM mobile
results from non-linear components in the receiver (such as the LNA and the
mixer) combining the attenuated signal from the transmitter with other
unwanted signals. These unwanted signals are typically called intermodulation
interference or blocking signals. The products of these signals with the
transmitter signal fall into the receive frequency band of the mobile station
and can cause the receiver to behave non-linearly or can impact the receiver's
sensitivity. This discussion document looks at the intermodulation
interference frequencies that are of concern with four common GSM frequency
bands. This information is referred to for the analysis of the intermodulation
interference immunity of different type 2 MS architectures.
#### 15.2.2a.2 Frequencies of Interest
Not all interference or blocking signals cause products that affect the GSM
receive band. The first task therefore is to identify the frequency bands for
interfering signals that pollute the receive GSM band when mixed with the
transmit signal.
Let the transmitter signal be represented by
$A_{\text{TX}}\text{cos}\omega_{\text{TX}}t$, where A~TX~ is the amplitude of
the transmit signal, and ω~TX~ represents the angular frequency of the
transmit signal. Similarly the interferer signal is represented by
$A_{I}\text{cos}\omega_{I}t$, where A~I~ is the amplitude of the interferer
signal and ω~I~ is the frequency.
Non-linearity in a receiver is typically modelled by a power series expansion
(and limiting the expansion to only the first, second, and third order terms):
where $V$ is the receiver output voltage; $V_{\text{in}}$ is the receiver
input voltage; $k_{1},k_{2},$ and $k_{3}$ are the first, second, and third
order voltage gain terms respectively; and $k_{0}$ is a DC offset term.
Substituting $V_{\text{in}} = A_{\text{TX}}\text{cos}\omega_{\text{TX}}t +
A_{I}\text{cos}\omega_{I}t$ into the above equation gives:
Expanding out the power terms gives the following:
The second and third order intermodulation terms are of concern, since they
can be close to the band of interest. Harmonics typically fall far out of band
and are easily rejected with filtering. The cross modulation product on the
interferer frequency is very critical where the interference frequency is
close to the receive band (i.e. adjacent channel interferers). This is
discussed in more detail in 15.2.2a.5.
#### 15.2.2a.3 Intermodulation Interference
##### 15.2.2a.3.1 Second Order Intermodulation Term
Looking first at the 2^nd^ order intermodulation term:
The frequencies terms of interest are $\omega_{\text{TX}} + \omega_{I}$ and
$\omega_{\text{TX}} - \omega_{I}$. Because of the Even-Odd trigonometric
identity cos(-x)=cos(x), the frequency term $\omega_{I} -
\omega_{\text{TX}}$needs to be considered as well. Next, solve for the
interferer frequencies, where these terms fall into the RX band:
$\begin{matrix} \omega_{\text{RX}} = \omega_{\text{TX}} + \omega_{I} \
\omega_{I} = \omega_{\text{RX}} - \omega_{\text{TX}} \ \end{matrix}$ [1]
$\begin{matrix} \omega_{\text{RX}} = \omega_{\text{TX}} - \omega_{I} \
\omega_{I} = \omega_{\text{TX}} - \omega_{\text{RX}} \ \end{matrix}$ [2]
$\begin{matrix} \omega_{\text{RX}} = \omega_{I} - \omega_{\text{TX}} \
\omega_{I} = \omega_{\text{RX}} + \omega_{\text{TX}} \ \end{matrix}$ [3]
Cases [1] and [3] represent valid interference frequencies. Case [2] results
in a negative frequency, because $\omega_{\text{RX}} > \omega_{\text{TX}}$,
and is therefore discarded.
##### 15.2.2a.3.2 Third Order Intermodulation Terms
Consider next the 3^rd^ order intermodulation terms:
$\frac{3}{4}k_{3}A_{\text{TX}^{2}}A_{I}\text{cos}\left( 2\omega_{\text{TX}} +
\omega_{I} \right)t\ + \
\frac{3}{4}k_{3}A_{\text{TX}^{2}}A_{I}\text{cos}\left( 2\omega_{\text{TX}} -
\omega_{I} \right)t\ $, and
The frequencies terms of interest are $2\omega_{\text{TX}} + \omega_{I}$,
$2\omega_{\text{TX}} - \omega_{I}$, $2\omega_{I} + \omega_{\text{TX}}$, and
$2\omega_{I} - \omega_{\text{TX}}$. Again because of the Even-Odd
trigonometric identity cos(-x)=cos(x), the frequency terms $\omega_{I} -
2\omega_{\text{TX}}$and $\omega_{\text{TX}} - 2\omega_{I}$need to be
considered as well. Next, solve for the interferer frequency, where these
terms fall into the RX band:
$\begin{matrix} \omega_{\text{RX}} = 2\omega_{\text{TX}} + \omega_{I} \
\omega_{I} = \omega_{\text{RX}} - 2\omega_{\text{TX}} \ \end{matrix}$ [4]
$\begin{matrix} \omega_{\text{RX}} = 2\omega_{\text{TX}} - \omega_{I} \
\omega_{I} = 2\omega_{\text{TX}} - \omega_{\text{RX}} \ \end{matrix}$ [5]
$\begin{matrix} \omega_{\text{RX}} = 2\omega_{I} + \omega_{\text{TX}} \
\omega_{I} = \frac{\omega_{\text{RX}} - \omega_{\text{TX}}}{2} \ \end{matrix}$
[6]
$\begin{matrix} \omega_{\text{RX}} = 2\omega_{I} - \omega_{\text{TX}} \
\omega_{I} = \frac{\omega_{\text{RX}} + \omega_{\text{TX}}}{2} \ \end{matrix}$
[7] $\begin{matrix} \omega_{\text{RX}} = \omega_{I} - 2\omega_{\text{TX}} \
\omega_{I} = \omega_{\text{RX}} + 2\omega_{\text{TX}} \ \end{matrix}$ [8]
$\begin{matrix} \omega_{\text{RX}} = \omega_{\text{TX}} - 2\omega_{I} \
\omega_{I} = \frac{\omega_{\text{TX}} - \omega_{\text{RX}}}{2} \ \end{matrix}$
[9]
Case [4] and case [9] result in negative frequencies and are therefore
discarded.
#### 15.2.2a.4 Intermodulation Frequency Bands
Now treating each frequency band as having a given bandwidth, the following
substitutions can be made:
$\omega_{\text{RX}} \Rightarrow F_{\text{RXH}} - F_{\text{RXL}}$
$\omega_{\text{TX}} \Rightarrow F_{\text{TXH}} - F_{\text{TXL}}$ $\omega_{I}
\Rightarrow F_{\text{IH}} - F_{\text{IL}}$
$\omega_{\text{RX}}$and $\omega_{\text{TX}}$can be any frequencies within a
given GSM RX and TX band respectively. The intermodulation interference band
frequency ranges are shown in Figure 417.
Figure 417: Intermodulation Interference Bands
The interference band frequency ranges are bounded by considering the extreme
frequencies of each receive and transmit band. This method is described by the
equations in Table 224. The angular frequencies ($\omega$) have been replaced
with ordinary frequencies using the relationship $F = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}$.

Applying the definitions in Table 224 for each GSM band gives the

In each of the GSM bands there is overlap between the band F~T2~ and the TX
band. Also there is overlap between the F~T3~ band and both the TX and RX
bands. These two 3^rd^ order product bands may prove to be the most
troublesome. While the F~T2~ product band can be rejected by the filtering in
the receiver, the F~T3~ product band will not be well rejected as it lies
directly across the transition band of the duplexer and receive filter as well
as in a portion of the Rx band where there is no duplexer and filter
rejection.
The interference signal power levels that may be seen in these frequency
ranges will vary depending on the RF environment. However the blocking signal
levels that the MS must handle are specified in Section 5.1 of [8]. The
document specifies blocking tone powers for each GSM band and classifies them
as "in-band" (frequencies near or in the receive band) or "out-of-band"
(frequencies farther away from the receive band). For DCS1800 and PCS1900 the
out-of-band frequencies are subdivided into sections (a), (b), (c), and (d).
The blocker powers and frequencies as stated in [8] are given in Table 226.

#### 15.2.2a.5 Cross Modulation Interference
Cross modulation is caused by the transfer of the amplitude modulation of a
strong signal (like the transmitter in a handset) onto another signal (the
adjacent channel) in a nonlinear processing block (i.e. the LNA). There can be
cross modulation between any two signals if one or both have some form of
amplitude modulation. In this case, we are interested in the cross modulation
from the transmitter signal of the mobile (which is relatively strong) and an
adjacent channel interferer in the mobile. This is shown in Figure 418.
Figure 418: Cross modulation of the Adjacent Channel Signal by the TX Signal
Causes Interference with the RX Signal.
Cross modulation power is proportional to the adjacent channel power and
proportional to the square of the TX power (in Watts). Cross modulation is
often the driver for linearity requirements in full duplex technologies such
as CDMA. Analyzing this effect accurately requires statistic modelling of the
modulated signal. The effect of cross modulation is not discussed at this
time.
#### 15.2.2a.6 Summary
This section defines the interference frequency bands that will combine with
the TX signal and cause interference in the receiver. Some of these
interference frequency bands lie close or even inside the TX and RX bands. It
also reiterates the blocking requirements set by [8].
Other interference bands are far from the operating frequencies of the MS and
should be strongly rejected by the MS antenna. However, as the transceiver
requirements set out in [8] state that interference signal power levels must
be considered at the antenna connector, the filtering benefits provided by the
antenna cannot be accounted for in subsequent analysis.
### 15.2.3 Void
### 15.2.3a Transmitter Output Power Levels
Three cases for the transmitter output power levels are considered.
#### 15.2.3a.1 No Maximum Output Power Reduction
The first case illustrates the situation where the type 2 mobile is expected
to meet the maximum output power requirements as specified for the mobile
class in [8]. In order to meet this specification the PA must exceed the
specified maximum power (33 dBm for 850/900 MHz and 30 dBm for 1800/1900 MHz)
by the total passive loss to the antenna port of the switchplexer. This output
power case illustrates the worst situation for receiver interference in this
frequency band, as the maximum amount of TX power will leak through to the RX
chain.
As an example, consider the basic type 2 architecture outlined in Section
15.2.6a in the GSM 850 band. The SPDT maximum insertion loss is 0.45 dB, the
maximum insertion loss of the duplexer in the TX path is 2.3dB and the maximum
insertion loss of the SP4T switchplexer is 0.85 dB. This means that the
maximum power at the PA output needs to be 33dBm \+ 0.85 dB + 2.3 dB + 0.45 dB
= **36.6** dBm.
In order to achieve this elevated output power, the size of the PA would have
to be increased significantly, and there would be a substantial increase in
current consumption. The current consumption can be estimated with the
equation:
P~out~ is in Watts, P~in~ can be ignored as the gain is high, Eff is the
efficiency (assumed 50% for GMSK, and V is the applied voltage (assume 3.8
volts).
Consider the GSM 850 band; with a type 1 mobile, the maximum loss after the PA
is approximately 0.2 dB for the harmonic filter, and 0.7 dB for the SP6T
switch. Therefore the power at the output of the PA is 33 dBm + 0.9 dB =
**33.9** dBm. The current draw for this output power is 1.29 A (during
transmit).
Next look at the example described above with the basic type 2 architecture
operating in the GSM850 frequency band. With the output power increased to
**36.6** dBm, the current draw increases to 2.41 A (during transmit). Power
consumption has almost doubled, which will have a significant impact on talk
time. Furthermore, the acoustic duplex filters are not designed to tolerate
such a high applied power level, and it is expected that this situation would
significantly decrease the life of the duplex filter. However for compliance
to the specifications this output power level should be analyzed.
#### 15.2.3a.2 No Change in PA Capabilities
The second case that is considered is where the PA puts out the same maximum
output power as it does with the current type 1 GSM architecture. As described
in Section 15.2.3a.1, for GSM 850 the maximum power at the output of the PA is
**33.9** dB. In DCS and PCS bands the maximum power measured at the PA output
(based on typical type 1 mobile) is 30 dBm + 0.2 (harmonic filter) + 0.9 (max
loss of SP6T switch in this frequency range) = **30.9** dBm. This output power
is held constant.
As an example consider the basic type 2 architecture given in Section 15.2.6a.
In this case, the maximum output power that the duplex filter sees is 33.9 dBm
-- 0.3 dB (typical insertion loss of the SPDT switch in this frequency range)
= **33.6** dBm[^1]. The maximum output power at the antenna port of the
switchplexer varies depending on the duplexer and the switchplexer losses. For
this architecture example in the GSM850 band it could vary between (33.6 dBm
-- 0.85 dB -- 2.3 dB) = **30.45** dBm and (33.6 dBm -- 0.7 dB -- 2.0 dB) =
**30.9** dBm. For the DCS/PCS band the maximum power at the TX port of the
duplex filter is 30.9 dBm \-- 0.4 dB (typical insertion loss of the SPDT
switch in this frequency range) = **30.5** dBm. The maximum output power at
the antenna port of the switchplexer varies depending on the duplexer and the
switchplexer loss. In both DCS and PCS band it would vary between (30.5 dBm --
0.8 dB \-- 2.1 dB) = **27.6** dBm and (30.5 dBm -- 0.95 dB-- 3.5 dB) =
**26.05** dBm.
This power case assumption means that type 2 mobiles would require a maximum
power reduction (even in single slot mode).
#### 15.2.3a.3 Power Back Off based on Duplexer Power Tolerance
Duplex filters have a limit to how much input power they can tolerate. The
specification for the GSM 850 SAW duplex filter (EPCOS B7638) states that it
can handle 30 dBm CW in the TX band. The PCS band BAW duplex specification
(EPCOS B7633) states that the filter can handle 29 dBm with a CDMA modulated
signal in the TX Band. These parameters are incomplete. It is not specified
whether these power limits are for RMS or peak power when a modulated signal
is presented. The effect of duty cycle of the signal presented is not
considered. Also, the percentage of the time that the signal is at or over the
rated maximum is not considered.
Regardless of the limited information available, there is a possibility of
damaging or reducing the life of the duplexer if the maximum rated power is
exceeded. Therefore the analysis is repeated with the TX output power backed
off to 29 dBm at the TX Port of the duplexer (30dBm for the GSM850 case).
The maximum output power at the antenna port of the switchplexer can vary
depending on the duplexer and switchplexer loss. As an example consider the
basic type 2 architecture given in Section 15.2.6a. In GSM850 band the maximum
output power would vary between (30 dBm -- 0.7 dB -- 2.0 dB) = **27.3** dBm
and (30 dBm -- 0.85 dB -- 2.3 dB) = **26.85** dBm. In EGSM900 it would vary
between (29 dBm -- 0.7 dB -- 2.1 dB) = **26.2** dBm and (29 dBm -- 0.85 dB --
3.5 dB) = **24.65** dBm. In PCS and DCS it would vary between **26.1** dBm and
**24.55** dBm.
This power case assumption means that type 2 mobiles would require a maximum
uplink power reduction (even in single slot mode).
### 15.2.4 Void
### 15.2.4a Analysis Assumptions
The interference and blocking signal frequencies and power levels are
discussed in Section 15.2.2a.
Sensitivity requirements depend on the logical channel, the expected error
rate, and the propagation environment. For AMR12.2 with FER 1%, the required
SNR can easily vary between 8 dB and 16 dB depending on the channel
conditions. For MCS-1 with 10% BLER, the required SNR can vary from 6 dB to 11
dB depending on the environment. To examine all the possible logical channels
and environments at this feasibility stage is unrealistic. Hence the analysis
in this document assumes that a signal to noise ratio of 10 dB is needed
between the desired signal and cochannel noise and interferers in order to
meet the bit error rate requirement with sufficient margin.
When verifying the immunity to blockers, the desired signal power is raised by
3dB to -99dBm. In a type 1 mobile there are typically only two components
between the antenna and the receiver, the switchplexer and the RF filter. The
maximum insertion loss of the switchplexer and receive filter occurs in the
DCS/PCS bands and is equal to 4.6 dB. Therefore, the minimum signal power
arriving at the receiver during blocker immunity testing is -99 dBm -- 4.6 dB
= **-103.6** dBm. If the cochannel noise and intermodulation products are to
be 10 dB below the signal power, their combined power must not exceed -113.6
dBm.
The thermal noise in a single 200 kHz GSM channel is -121 dBm. Adding the
maximum RF receiver noise figure (4.6 dB) to the thermal noise yields -116.4
dBm. Removing -116.4dBm from the permitted noise and interference level of
-113.6 dBm gives the maximum power intermodulation products can have without
violating the 10 dB SNR requirement. This value works out to be -116.8 dBm.
This same analysis is done for the various architectures in each band, since
the insertion losses of the components vary depending on the frequency, and
different components are present in different architectures.
The receiver's tolerance to interference signal power is determined by the
rejection provided by any receive band filtering, and by the linearity of the
receiver. Based on the maximum interference signal level [9], the amount of
transmitter power that leaks through to the receiver input, and the
duplexer/filter performance [10], the receiver linearity (IIP2, IIP3, and the
1 dB compression point (C1dB)) required to prevent saturation by the transmit
signal and degradation of the receiver sensitivity are determined.
In some cases, the passive losses degrade the receiver sensitivity to the
point that the 10 dB SNR cannot be maintained at the receiver. In these cases,
the input signal level must be increased to meet the performance requirements.
### 15.2.5 Duplexer and Receive Filter Requirements
#### 15.2.5.1 Introduction
This section discusses the filter parameters that are used in the various
analyses for different type 2 mobile architectures. Specifications that are
used in these analyses are given. As type 2 GSM mobiles are not currently
manufactured, some of the filters required are not available. Filter
specifications for some bands had to be derived from existing filters.
#### 15.2.5.2 Methodology
Frequency scaling allows filters with different centre frequencies to be
compared. To estimate filter parameters, it is necessary to find a filter with
similar scaled bandwidth and transition bands as the required filter. Figure
419 illustrates typical bandpass filter characteristics and defines parameters
that are subsequently used in the equations.
Figure 419: Diagram Showing Bandpass Filter Characteristics
The scaled bandwidth, the scaled transition band, and the shape factor are
used to map filter requirements:
$\text{scaled}\text{bandwidth} = \left( \frac{\text{BW}}{F_{C}} \right)$
$\text{scaled}\text{transition}\text{band} = \left(
\frac{F_{\text{TL}}}{F_{C}} \right)$ $\text{shapefactor} = \left(
\frac{\text{BW}}{F_{\text{TL}} + \text{BW}} \right)$
$F_{\text{TH}}$ is not used in the above equations as it is on the high side
of the RX band, away from the TX band, and therefore its value is not
critical.
By matching the normalized bandwidth, normalized transition bands, and shape
factor relatively closely, filter performance can be projected for other
frequency bands. This method is just used to give approximate filter
performance, and does not confirm that filters can be fabricated with these
specifications.
The EGSM and DCS frequency bands did not have sample high TX rejection filters
or duplexers available. The normalized bandwidth, transition bands and shape
factor for EGSM and DCS are given in Table 227.
Table 227: Key Filter Parameters for the EGSM and DCS Band
#### 15.2.5.3 Receiver Bandpass Filter Specifications
Two sets of receiver bandpass filters are considered in this analysis. Filters
designed for current GSM receivers (i.e. type 1) have not been optimized for
high rejection of the transmitter band since full duplex operation is not
required. Sample filter specifications for these filters are given in Section
15.2.5.6.
For the GSM bands that are coincident with CDMA bands (i.e. GSM 850 and PCS
1900), there are sample high TX rejection filters targeted for the CDMA market
that can be used for a type 2 mobile. The sample high TX rejection filter used
in this analysis for the 850 MHz band is the EPCOS B9035. For PCS band the
sample filter used is the EPCOS B9034. Filters were not found for the EGSM and
DCS bands, so the filter specifications for these bands were derived from the
B9034 according to the procedure described in Section 15.2.5.2.
Table 228 compares the normalized key filter parameters for the EGSM and DCS
bands with those of the two high TX rejection filters.
Table 228: Key Filter Parameters for Each GSM Band
It can be seen that the scaled parameters and shape factor for the DCS and
EGSM bands more closely match the B9034, therefore values for passband
attenuation and rejection in the TX band for EGSM900 and DCS were taken
directly from the B9034. For specifications outside of the RX and TX band
frequencies, the frequency ranges were directly scaled by the ratio of the
centre frequencies; $F_{c - \text{EGSM}}F_{c - B\text{9034}}$for the EGSM
band, and$F_{c - \text{DCS}}F_{c - B\text{9034}}$ for the DCS band.
The high TX rejection bandpass specifications for all of the bands are given
in Section 15.2.5.6.
#### 15.2.5.4 Duplexer Filter Specifications
The EPCOS B7638 duplexer was available for the GSM 850 band and is used in
this analysis. For the PCS band, the EPCOS BAW B7633 duplex filter for CDMA
applications was used in this analysis. Duplex filters were not found for the
EGSM and DCS bands, so the filter specifications for these bands were derived
from the B7633 according to the procedure described in Section 15.2.5.2.
Table 229 and Table 230 compare the normalized key filter parameters for the
EGSM and DCS bands with those of the two high TX rejection filters.
Table 229: Key Duplexer Filter Parameters for TX-ANT
Table 230: Key Duplexer Filter Parameters for ANT-RX
It can be seen that the scaled parameters for both DCS and EGSM 900 bands more
closely match the B7633, in both the transmit and receive path. Therefore
values for TX-ANT attenuation, ANT-RX attenuation, and TX-RX isolation are
taken from the B7633. For specifications outside of the RX and TX band
frequencies, the frequency ranges were directly scaled by the ratio of the
centre frequencies as described in Section 15.2.5.2.
While bandpass SAW filters are available for the EGSM and DCS bands (but just
not optimized for TX rejection performance), it seems that making duplexers
for these frequency band has not been tried. The methodology here is a way to
estimate the performance of a duplexer in these bands, and is not a guarantee
that the filter will have this performance in reality. In addition, the EGSM
filter estimation is based on the PCS filter, which is fabricated using bulk
acoustic wave (BAW) technology. However, it is more likely that the EGSM
filter would be fabricated using SAW technology, similar to the filter for GSM
850. Similar performance would be expected.
The duplex filter specifications for all of the frequency bands are given
Section 15.2.5.6.
#### 15.2.5.5 Worst Case Assumption
For simplicity, only worst case conditions were considered. Minimum rejection
figures over temperature were used for the filters and duplexers. Maximum in-
band attenuation (insertion loss) figures were also used. If a particular
frequency band of interest straddled two different rejection performance
regions of a filter, the lowest rejection was assumed to apply to the entire
frequency band.

#### 15.2.5.7 New Duplexer Arrangement for Lower Insertion Loss
In order to alleviate the tough requirements on the duplex filters\'
transition band slope which leads to high insertion loss, it is proposed to
divide the receive/transmit band into two halves and to use different duplex
filters for each half band. In this section the concept is explained with the
example of EGSM900. However, the relationship between the guard band width and
the carrier frequency is similar for DCS1800 or PCS1900. Hence the proposed
solution could be attractive for the high bands as well.
##### 15.2.5.7.1 Concept Description
The receive/transmit band is divided into two equal sub-bands. Each duplexer
will then have a passband which is only half as wide, and a guard band which
is increased by half the passband width. Therefore it can be implemented with
a relatively simple filter design which will have very much reduced insertion
loss. Extra signal routing switches are needed, but these do not add much
loss.
Figure 419a and Figure 4196b show an EGSM900 example:
Figure 419a: Block diagram of new duplexer architecture
Figure 419b: Frequency plan of new duplexer (EGSM band)
A lower insertion loss can be achieved since the transition band slope of each
of the duplex filters does not need to be as steep as in the case of a duplex
filter covering the whole band. Each of the new duplex filters needs fewer
resonators than a conventional duplex filter. However, the total size may not
decrease because the number of duplex filters doubles. This also depends on
the size of individual duplex filters and this aspect is for further study.
##### 15.2.5.7.2 Impacts on the Specification
There may be a need to change 45.002 annex B1 because the new technique can
only support full duplex operation if the uplink and downlink channels are in
the same half of the band. A problem will arise if the MS has to monitor a
channel in the lower downlink half band (Duplexer 1 RX in Figure 419b) at the
same time as transmitting in the upper uplink half band (Duplexer 2 TX in
Figure 419b). To allow that the MS monitors all downlink channels with full
sensitivity, there should be a point in time in every TDMA frame in which the
network neither assigns an uplink nor a downlink slot -- at least if the TX
channel is in the upper half of the TX band. A similar problem may also occur
with frequency hopping and this may further reduce the number of timeslots
within a TDMA frame in which full duplex operation is possible using this
architecture.
##### 15.2.5.7.3 Impacts on the Analysis
Determination of the estimated filter parameters using this duplexer
arrangement, and the subsequent analysis of the various architectures, is TBD.
### 15.2.6 Void
## 15.2.6a Basic Type 2 Architecture
#### 15.2.6a.1 Introduction
This section discusses interference in the receive band of a type 2 mobile
resulting from non-linearity in the receiver coupled with the presence of a
transmit signal. Three different options for basic type 2 receiver
architecture are discussed and analyzed. Using the duplexers and filters
discussed in section 15.2.5, receiver linearity requirements are determined
with respect to TX signal power leakage and interferer signal power (as
discussed in section 15.2.2a).
#### 15.2.6a.2 Receiver performance
The RF section receiver performance and linearity values were taken from a
typical quad band GSM/EDGE chipset. The parameter values relevant to this
analysis are given in Table 231.
Table 231: Typical GSM/EDGE Receiver Performance Specifications
#### 15.2.6a.3 Mapping Filter Specifications
The duplexers used for this analysis are described in detail in section
15.2.5. The typical GSM receive bandpass filters and the high TX Rejection
bandpass filters are also described in that section.
#### 15.2.6a.4 Architecture Details
##### 15.2.6a.4.1 Architecture 1 -- The Basic Type 2 Mobile
The first analysis is performed using the architecture shown in Figure 420\.
This architecture assumes that there is no change in the transmission path
regardless of whether the mobile is operating in half duplex mode (a type 1
mobile) or full duplex mode (a type 2 mobile).
Figure 420: Basic Type 2 Architecture
The PA module shown in the figure comprises one PA for cellular band and one
PA for PCS/DCS band. Since the duplex filters that follow the PA modules are
band specific, this requires that SPDT switches [17] are placed after the PA.
The insertion losses of the duplex filters are discussed in detail in section
15.2.5. The antenna switchplexer requires a SP4T switch [18]. The typical type
1 architecture requires a SP6T switchplexer [19] to support the TX and RX
paths. The insertion losses of all the switches and switchplexers in the
transmit or receive path are given in Table 232.
Table 232: Switch and Switchplexer Insertion Losses
##### 15.2.6a.4.2 Architecture 2 -- The Basic Type 2 Mobile with Additional
Filtering
In order to reduce the receiver linearity requirements, the TX signal power
leakage and the intermodulation interferer power must be reduced. One way to
do this is to add a bandpass filter between the duplexer and the receiver
input, as shown in Figure 421.
Figure 421: Basic Type 2 Architecture with Additional RX Filtering
The isolators between the duplexers and filters are included to provide a 50Ω
impedance to the output of the duplexer and the input of the filter.[^2] They
have a maximum insertion loss of 0.6 dB [20].
Two different choices of bandpass filters are analyzed. Typical filters used
in type 1 GSM mobile stations are considered first. Then high TX rejection
filters are considered.
#### 15.2.6a.5 Analysis of the Basic Type 2 Architecture
This section looks at two different architectures for a basic type 2 GSM
mobile. The first uses only the duplex filter for out of band rejection. This
architecture is illustrated in Figure 420 and discussed in section
15.2.6a.4.1. Full duplexer specifications are given in section 15.2.5.
The allowable intermodulation interference level for each band is determined
using the method outlined in section 15.2.4a. The target SNR is achievable at
the specified input level for all frequency bands, thus no change in the
reference sensitivity level is required in this case. The maximum allowable
intermodulation interference for each frequency band is given in Table 233.
Table 233: Maximum Allowable Intermodulation Interference for Duplexer Only
Case
Three cases for the transmitter output power levels are considered.
##### 15.2.6a.5.1 No Maximum Output power Reduction
In this case, in order to meet this specification the PA must exceed the
specified maximum power (33 dBm for 850/900 MHz and 30 dBm for 1800/1900 MHz)
by the total passive loss to the output of the switchplexer. This output power
case illustrates the worst situation for receiver interference in this
frequency band, as the maximum amount of TX power will leak through to the RX
chain. The transmit signal power that reaches the receiver input is shown in
Table 234.

* * *
As given in Table 231, the estimated 1 dB compression point of the receiver
(C1dB) is -28 dBm. The transmit power at the receiver input exceeds C1dB for
all frequency bands, therefore already it can be seen that this metric must be
increased just due to TX power leakage alone.
Table 234 shows that the TX power leakage is greatest in the EGSM 900 band.
Therefore intermodulation interference, which increases with increasing TX
signal power, is also greatest in this band, and so this band is used to
determine receiver requirements.
Table 235 shows the second order interferer power level limits (based on the
degradation limit discussed in section 15.2.6a.5) for different IIP2 levels.
The IIP2 of the typical transceiver chip (42.9 dBm) was far less than needed.
To meet the specified blocker requirements with this basic architecture, an
IIP2 of 76 dBm is required. This value is much higher than the approximately
60 dBm given in [21]; it is expected that this value is not readily achievable
with an integrated receiver.

insufficient to meet the blocker specification.
* * *
Table 236 shows maximum interferer power levels the receiver could handle for
three different values of IIP3. The typical transceiver IIP3 (-18 dBm) was far
less than was needed. The value IIP3 = 5 dBm value was considered as it
represents approximately what is used in CDMA mobile chipsets [23]. This too
was insufficient. An IIP3 of 36.8 dBm was required to meet the specified
blocker levels. This value is much higher than the IIP3 demonstrated in [21];
it is expected that this value is not achievable.

The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 237. The required
linearity requirements are unrealistic.

Receiver Linearity Parameter Value P~TX\ port~ 37.4 dBm IIP2 76.0 dBm IIP3
36.8 dBm C1dB (IIP3 -- 10dB) 26.8 dBm
* * *
##### 15.2.6a.5.2 No Change in PA Capabilities
The second case that is considered is where the PA outputs the same maximum
output power as it does with current GSM architectures. The EGSM band is still
the hardest to meet because of the duplex filter characteristics. For a type 1
mobile, for EGSM band the maximum PA output power is 33dBm + 0.2 dB (harmonic
filter) + 0.7 dB (SP6T switch) = 33.9 dBm. Therefore the maximum output power
at the TX port of the duplex filter for the basic type 2 architecture is 33.9
dBm -- 0.3 dB = 33.6 dB.
The required receiver linearity parameters for this case are summarized in
Table 238.

* * *
Receiver Linearity Parameter Value P~TX\ port~ 33.6 dBm IIP2 72.5 dBm IIP3
33.1 dBm C1dB (IIP3 -- 10dB) 23.1 dBm
* * *
This reduction in output power does little to make the required linearity
values more reasonable.
##### 15.2.6a.5.3 Power Back Off based on Duplexer Power Tolerance
In this analysis, the TX output power is backed off to 29 dBm at the TX Port
of the duplexer. The required receiver linearity parameters for this case are
summarized in Table 239.
Table 239: Linearity Requirements Duplexer Only, Power Based on Duplexer
Tolerance
* * *
Receiver Linearity Parameter Value P~TX\ port~ 29.0 dBm IIP2 67.7 dBm IIP3
28.3 dBm C1dB (IIP3 -- 10dB) 18.3 dBm
* * *
Even with this very significant back off in power, the linearity requirements
are still very high. Clearly the duplex filter alone is insufficient for this
application.
#### 15.2.6a.6 Analysis of the Basic Type 2 Architecture with Typical GSM
Receiver Filters
In order to reduce the receiver linearity requirements, the TX signal power
leakage and the intermodulation interferer power must be reduced. One way to
do this is to add a bandpass filter between the duplexer and the receiver
input. This architecture is shown in Figure 421 and discussed in section
15.2.6a.4.2. This architecture will first be analyzed with typical filters
used in type 1 GSM mobile stations. Full specifications for these filters are
given in section 15.2.5.
The allowable intermodulation interference level for each band is determined
using the method outlined in section 15.2.4a. The target SNR is not achievable
at the specified input level for all frequency bands. The desired signal level
needs to be increased by 3 dB to overcome the increased noise figure of the
receiver in this architecture. Given the new input signal level (-96 dBm with
interference), the maximum allowable intermodulation interference for each
frequency band is given in Table 240.
Table 240: Maximum Allowable Intermodulation Interference for Duplexer +
Standard GSM Filter Case
##### 15.2.6a.6.1 No Maximum Output Power Reduction
Table 241 shows the TX signal power that reaches the receiver in this
scenario.
Table 241: Transmit Signal Power at Receiver Input

                                        GSM Band                               
                                        GSM850       EGSM900      DCS1800      PCS1900

Transmit Power at Receiver Input -54.45 dBm -30.25 dBm -27.15 dBm -26.15 dBm
* * *
In this combined filtering case, the TX signal power leakage was greatest in
the PCS1900 band. Therefore intermodulation interference, which increases with
increasing TX signal power, is also greatest in this band, and so this band is
used to determine receiver requirements.
The rejection from the filter improved the second order interference tolerance
to the point where the IIP2 performance is sufficient (Table 242).
Table 242: Interferer Power Limits for 2nd Order Interference Bands in the
PCS1900 Receiver
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------+ | | 2^nd^ Order Interference | | | | Bands for PCS1900 | | | | | | | | (Frequencies are in MHz) | | +--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------+ | | 20 -- 140 | 3780 -- 3900 | +--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------+ | Total Isolation | 64.3 dB | 56.6 dB | | (switchplexer + duplexer | | | | + isolator + filter) | | | +--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------+ | Specified Blocker Power | 0 dBm | 0 dBm | +--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------+ | Threshold Interference | 14.45 dBm | 6.75 dBm | | Power, IIP2 = 42.9 dBm | | | +--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------+
Analysis of third order interference tolerance indicated that IIP3 was
insufficient. As shown in Table 243, an IIP3 of 17.2 dBm was required to meet
the blocker power specifications. This represents an enormous upgrade in the
receiver linearity (from the current -18 dBm). It is also well beyond the +5
dBm typically seen in CDMA receivers [23].

##### 15.2.6a.6.2 No Change in PA Capabilities
In this case the maximum power measured at the PA output for type 1 mobile is
30 dBm + 0.2 dB (harmonic filter) + 1.6 dB (switchplexer) = 31.8 dBm.
Therefore the maximum power at the TX port of the duplexer is 31.8 dBm -- 0.4
dB (minimum insertion loss of the SPDT) = 31.4
The required receiver linearity parameters for this case are summarized in
Table 245.

The IIP3 requirement is still very high with this power back off.
##### 15.2.6a.6.3 Power Back Off based on Duplexer Power Tolerance
In this analysis, the TX output power is backed off to 29 dBm at the TX Port
of the duplexer (PCS band). The required receiver linearity parameters for
this case are summarized in Table 246.

This small additional power reduction does little to change the requirements.
#### 15.2.6a.7 Analysis of the Basic Type 2 Architecture with High TX
Rejection Receiver Filters
TX signal power and intermodulation interference signal power at the receiver
input can be further reduced by replacing the standard GSM filters with
filters that offer a higher rejection in the TX frequency band. Such filters
are available for the GSM800 and PCS1900 bands. The B9035 and B9034 filters
from EPCOS are used in this analysis. As described in section 15.2.5, filter
characteristics for the EGSM900 and DCS1800 frequency bands were estimated
based on the performance of the B9034.
The allowable intermodulation interference level for each band is determined
using the method outlined in section 15.2.4a. The target SNR is not achievable
at the specified input level for all frequency bands. The desired signal level
needs to be increased by 3 dB to overcome the increased noise figure of the
receiver in this architecture. Given the new input signal level (-96 dBm with
interference), the maximum allowable intermodulation interference for each
frequency band is given in Table 247.

Due to the different filter rejections, the EGSM band is now the worst case.
Examining IIP2 with the new filter rejection for this band illustrates that
the IIP2 of the receiver is sufficient to meet the blocker specifications with
ample margin (see Table 249).
Table 249: Power Limits for 2nd Order Interference Bands in the EGSM900

Third order intermodulation interference was also greatly reduced with higher
rejection filters. Table 250 shows a receiver IIP3 value of 2.5 dBm was
sufficient to meet the blocker requirements. This value of IIP3 is in the
range of values given in published CDMA receivers ([21], [22]), suggesting
these linearity figures are reasonable for an integrated receiver.

#### 15.2.6a.8 Summary
This discussion document has looked at the intermodulation interference in a
basic type 2 mobile. While this is a significant impairment in the receiver,
there are other impairments that have not been analyzed here.
Considering only the intermodulation interference analyzed in this document,
the analysis above has shown that it is likely possible to build a basic type
2 mobile receiver with sufficient intermodulation immunity given the
architecture shown in Figure 421 and the assumptions described.
To address the intermodulation interference it seems that the IIP2 of a
typical GSM RF transceiver is sufficient, however the IIP3 would need to be
increased to approximately 2.5 dBm (in the case where the output power is not
reduced). This value is typical for CDMA receivers and so is likely to be
achievable in a highly integrated chipset. If it is permissible to reduce the
output power to a level tolerated by the duplexers (30 dBm in GSM850, 29 dBm
in EGSM, DCS and PCS bands at the duplexer TX port), then the IP3 requirement
is reduced to approximately -1.7 dBm.
With this power reduction, the maximum output power at the antenna port of the
switchplexer in GSM850 band is (30dBm - 2.0 dB - 0.7) = 27.3 dB. For EGSM900
the maximum output power would be (29dBm - 2.1 dB - 0.7 dB) = 26.2 dBm. For
PCS and DCS the maximum output power would be (29 dBm -- 2.1 dB - 0.8 dB) =
26.1. For GSM and EGSM a power backoff of about 7 dB is required for GMSK. For
DCS/PCS a power back off of about 4 dB is required for GMSK.
The trade offs of building such a type 2 mobile are:
  * Output power level must be significantly lowered to not violate duplexer limits. Receive signal power requires an increase of 4 dB to operate at the same S/ (N+I). Thus it is only appropriate in areas with strong signal coverage
  * the increase IIP3 and C1dB of the receiver may result in a large receive IC and/or greater power consumption
  * there are several new parts required for this architecture, which will increase the physical size and cost to manufacturer of mobiles regardless of the mode of operation
The gains achieved with type 2 operation needs to then be examined in light of
the tradeoffs involved in the manufacturing of such a device with the basic
architectures presented in this section.
### 15.2.7 Void
### 15.2.7a Modified Type 2 Architecture
#### 15.2.7a.1 Introduction
This section discusses interference in the receive band of a GSM850 and
EGSM900 type 2 mobile resulting from non-linearity in the receiver coupled
with the presence of a transmit signal. In section 15.2.6a, a basic receiver
architecture that used a duplexer followed by a receive band filter is
discussed. While this architecture placed seemingly achievable linearity
requirements on the receiver active circuitry, it also reduced the receiver
sensitivity. In this paper a receiver architecture that places an LNA between
the duplexer and receive band filter is examined. Using the duplexers and
filters discussed in section 15.2.5, LNA and receiver linearity requirements
are determined with respect to TX signal power leakage and interferer signal
power (as discussed in section 15.2.2a).
#### 15.2.7a.2 LNA and Post-Filter Receiver Performance
Type 2 GSM mobile chipsets are not currently available; however the
architecture presented here is similar to architectures proposed for CDMA
receivers ([21] and [22]). The receiver presented in [21] is a good candidate
for use in this analysis as it is a recent work and it is a zero-IF
architecture, using only a few discrete components. Unfortunately, this
receiver was targeted at the cell band (850MHz) only. Because the cell band
frequencies are close to the EGSM900 band, it is assumed that a receiver could
be fabricated with the same characteristics for the EGSM900 band. The PCS and
DCS bands are at approximately twice the frequency of the cell band and will
require separate analysis. Therefore this analysis is limited to the cell band
and the LNA and post-filter receiver characteristics as presented in [21] are
used (Table 254 and Table 255).

#### 15.2.7a.3 Mapping Filter Specifications
The duplexers and filters used for this analysis are described in detail in
section 15.2.5.
#### 15.2.7a.4 Modified Architecture Details
The modified architecture is based on the basic architecture discussed in
section 15.2.6a. An LNA is placed between the duplexer and filter in the
receive chain as shown in Figure 422. This architecture assumes that there is
no change in the transmitter or receive path regardless of whether the mobile
is operating in half duplex mode (a type 1 mobile) or full duplex mode (a type
2 mobile).
The PA module shown in the figure comprises one PA for cellular band and one
PA for PCS/DCS band. Since the duplex filters that follow the PA modules are
band specific, SPDT switches [17] are placed after the PA. The antenna
switchplexer requires a SP4T switch [18]. The specifications for the switches
used in this application (and in type 1 mobiles for comparison) are given in
Table 256. The duplex filters also have insertion losses associated with them.
This is discussed in detail in section 15.2.5.
Table 256: Switch and Switchplexer Insertion Losses
In the receive chain, an LNA is placed between the duplexer and the receive
band filter. A separate LNA is assumed for each GSM band. By placing switches
at the inputs and outputs of the LNAs, it may be possible to use only two LNAs
- a single LNA for GSM850 and EGSM900, and a single LNA for DCS1800 and
PCS1900. Doing so would require four additional SPDT switches and would
desensitize each receiver path by more than the loss of the SPDT switch. This
option is not examined here.
Figure 422: Modified Type 2 Architecture.
The integrated portions of the transmitter and receiver are shown as separate
parts to avoid substrate coupling of noise from the transmitter to the
receiver. More research is required to determine if it is necessary to
separate the two parts, or if they could be integrated together.
#### 15.2.7a.5 Receiver Sensitivity
The analysis assumptions are given in detail in section 15.2.4a.
The advantage to placing an LNA between the duplexer and filters (as shown in
Figure 422) is improved sensitivity. Table 257 shows the minimum gain and the
maximum noise figure of each component in the entire receive chain from the
antenna to the output of the post-filter receiver.
Table 257: EGSM900 Receive Chain Gain and Noise Figure.
MS receiver sensitivity testing is conducted with a -102 dBm signal applied to
the antenna connector [8]. Using the values in Table 257, the signal power at
the output of the post-filter receiver is ‑48.15 dBm (-102 dBm + 53.85 dB).
The total noise power at the output of the post-filter receiver is -59.03 dBm
(-121 dBm (thermal noise in 200 kHz BW) + 8.12 dB (cascaded NF)[^4] + 53.85
dB). The difference between the signal power and noise power at the output is
10.88 dBm. Thus, during simple sensitivity testing, this receiver architecture
meets the 10 dBm SNR goal assumed in this document.
#### 15.2.7a.6 Transmitter Output Power Levels
Three cases for the transmitter output power levels are considered as
described in section 15.2.3a. They are given again in Table 258 for the GSM
850 and EGSM 900 frequency bands.

* * *
#### 15.2.7a.7 Analysis Assumptions
The interference and blocking signal frequencies and power levels are
discussed in section 15.2.2a.
GSM Type 1 mobile station receivers must pass a sensitivity test with -102 dBm
of signal power. The analysis assumes that a signal to noise ratio of 10 dB is
needed between the desired signal and cochannel noise and interferers in order
to meet the bit error rate requirement with sufficient margin (as described in
section 15.2.3a).
When verifying the immunity to blockers, the desired signal power is raised by
3 dB to -99 dBm. As shown in Figure 422, between the antenna and the post-
filter receiver are a switchplexer, a duplexer, an LNA, and an RF filter. The
insertion loss of the switches, duplexers and filters is dependent on the GSM
band in question. For the EGSM900 band the worst case switchplexer loss (0.85
dB), duplexer loss (4.5 dB), and filter loss (4.3 dB) combine to produce 9.65
dB of loss. Adding the LNA gain of 15.5 dB produces a desired signal level of
-93.15 dBm. In keeping with the 10 dB SNR goal, noise and interferer power
combined must not exceed -103.15 dBm.
In a 200 kHz bandwidth, there is -121 dBm of thermal noise. Using information
from Table 257, the gain up to the input of the post-filter receiver is (-0.85
dB -- 4.5 dB + 15.5 dB -- 4.3 dB) = 5.85 dB and the cascaded noise figure is
8.12 dB. Adding these numbers gives the noise power referred to the post-
filter receiver input (-121 dBm + 5.85 dB + 8.12 dB) = -107.03 dBm.
Converting -103.15 dBm and -107.03 dBm to linear units and subtracting the
thermal noise from the total noise and interferer level gives the maximum
allowable intermodulation interference before the target 10 dB SNR goal is
violated; -105.44 dBm. This number is used to assess the immunity of the
receiver to blockers in the intermodulation interference bands. If the power
in the intermodulation product of the TX signal and the blocker exceeds
‑105.44 dBm in the following analysis, the LNA and/or post-filter receiver
linearity are deemed insufficient.
Performing the same analysis for the GSM850 case reveals -100.9 dBm as the
limit for intermodulation product power.
The receiver's tolerance to interference signal power is determined by the
rejection provided by any filtering, and by the linearity of the receiver.
Based on the maximum interference signal level, the amount of transmitter
power that leaks through to the receiver input, and the duplexer/filter
performance, the receiver linearity (IIP2, IIP3, and the 1 dB compression
point (C1dB)) required to prevent saturation by the transmit signal and
degradation of the receiver sensitivity are determined.
#### 15.2.7a.8 Analysis of the Modified Type 2 Architecture
Analysis of this architecture concentrates on the EGSM900 band as its receiver
linearity requirements are more stringent than those of the GSM850 band. There
are three reasons for this:
  * The EGSM900 filters and duplexers used in this analysis offer less rejection of the TX signal and blockers than GSM850 filters (section 15.2.5).
  * The EGSM900 duplexer has higher insertion loss in the transmit path than the GSM850 duplexer, requiring a stronger TX signal to achieve a given antenna port power. This results in higher TX power leakage to the receiver.
  * The EGSM900 band has less SNR margin for intermodulation interference (-105.4 dBm vs. -100.9 dBm for GSM850).
Second and third order intermodulation interference signal power levels at the
LNA input and at the input to the post-filter receiver are shown in Table 259
and Table 260. These values are used in the following sections to assess the
receiver linearity and determine the required IIP2 and IIP3 values.
In this architecture, there is some flexibility in how gain and linearity is
budgeted to the LNA and the post-filter receiver. Because a pre-existing LNA
and post-filter receiver is used in this analysis, the gain and linearity
budget is set. However, in the analysis that follows, minimum linearity values
for the LNA and the post-filter receiver are given when the existing values
prove insufficient.
The required IIP3 value for either the LNA or the post-filter receiver depends
on the power of the TX signal, and on the power in the strongest interference
signal in the third order intermodulation interference bands. As Table 260
shows, with the EGSM900 band duplexers and filters used in this analysis, the
strongest third order intermodulation interference signal at the LNA input is
in the frequency range 2685 MHz \-- 2790 MHz (see section 15.2.2a for more on
the intermodulation interference frequencies). Over this frequency range, the
duplexer provides only 20dB of rejection, much less than in any other
interference band. Thus it is the third order intermodulation interference
signal power and the TX signal power in this frequency range that dictate the
required IIP3 for the LNA.
For the post-filter receiver, it is the third order intermodulation
interference signal power that falls in the frequency range 915 MHz -- 937.5
MHz that is strongest (Table 260). Thus this frequency range dictates the
required IIP3 for the post-filter receiver.

##### 15.2.7a.8.1 No Maximum Output power Reduction
With 37.35 dBm (Table 258) of TX signal power at the duplexer TX port for the
EGSM900 case, the TX signal power levels shown in Table 261 are present in the
receiver.
Table 261: Transmit Signal Power Levels and Rejection in Receiver Chain for
EGSM900 with No Maximum Power Reduction.

* * *
The 1 dB compression point of both the LNA and post-filter receiver (C1dB~LNA~
= 1 dBm and C1dB~PFR~ = -0.8 dBm) is sufficient to handle the leaked TX signal
power.
The IIP2 performance of the LNA is not given in [21]; therefore its immunity
to intermodulation interference in the second order interference bands cannot
be assessed. The analysis can be used to determine the required minimum value
for IIP2. Table 259 shows the second order interferer power levels at the LNA
input. Using the second order interferer with the highest power level at the
LNA input (1805 MHz \-- 1875 MHz), the required minimum LNA IIP2 of 74.8 dBm
is found. This value is very high and it may be difficult to achieve in the
LNA.
The additive rejection of the duplexer and the filter reduces the maximum
power levels in the second order interference bands to -50.2 dBm at the input
to the post-filter receiver. This level is quite low, and the 60 dBm IIP2 of
the post-filter receiver is adequate.
Considering the IIP3 performance, Table 262 shows maximum interferer power
levels the receiver can tolerate for two different values of IIP3. The
existing LNA and post-filter receiver IIP3 (11 dBm and 9.2 dBm respectively)
are less than what is needed. The LNA IIP3 must increase to 36.1 dBm and the
post-filter receiver IIP3 must increase to 18.1 dBm to tolerate the
interference levels. These values are very high, likely beyond what is
practical for the integration level of a GSM radio. The required LNA IIP3 is
far beyond the demonstrated IIP3 in any of the integrated LNAs summarized in
[25].

The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 263. The required
linearity requirements are likely unrealistic.

##### 15.2.7a.8.2 No Change in PA Capabilities
As shown in Table 258 the TX signal power level at the duplexer TX port is
33.6 dBm. The TX signal power levels shown in Table 264 are present in the
receiver.

* * *
With this power level reduction at the duplexer TX port, the required IIP2 of
the LNA is reduced somewhat to 71 dBm. This IIP2 value may not be easily
achieved in the LNA. The post-filter receiver's IIP2 value of 60dB is
sufficient.
The reduction in duplexer TX port signal power reduces the susceptibility of
the entire receiver to third order intermodulation interference. Table 265
shows that while the receiver used in this analysis does not have sufficient
linearity, the required minimum IIP3 is considerably lower than in the no
power reduction case. Minimum LNA and post-filter receiver IIP3 requirements
are 32.3 dBm and 16.2 dBm respectively.

The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 266. The required
linearity values are reduced considerably, but not enough to make them
reasonable. The required LNA IIP3 in particular is still extremely high
relative to recently published LNA performance [25].

##### 15.2.7a.8.3 Power Back Off based on Duplexer Power Tolerance
In this analysis, the TX output power is backed off to 29 dBm at the TX Port
of the duplexer for EGSM900. For GSM850 the TX duplexer port power only needs
to be relaxed to 30 dBm as the duplexer for this band can tolerate an extra
1dB of power. Even with this extra power the GSM850 case requires less IIP2
and IIP3 than the EGSM900 case, as the duplexer and receive band filter for
GSM850 reject interfering signals more effectively than the EGSM900 duplexer
and receive band filter (see section 15.2.5).
Table 267 shows the TX signal power levels for this case.

EGSM900 with PA Output Power Reduced to 29 dBm

Input** **-51.5 dBm**
* * *
Using the TX power at the LNA input (Table 267) and the second order blocker
power levels (Table 259), the LNA IIP2 requirement is found to be 66.5 dBm.
This value is quite high, and whether it can be achieved in an integrated LNA
is FFS. The 60 dBm IIP2 of the post-filter receiver is sufficient.
The reduction in TX power eases the IIP3 requirements slightly. As shown in
Table 268, the required minimum LNA IIP3 is 27.8 dBm and the required minimum
post-filter receiver IIP3 is 14.1 dBm.

The required receiver linearity parameters for this case are summarized in
Table 269. The required IIP3 of the LNA is well beyond recently published
results [25]. Even with this very significant back off in power, the post-
filter receiver IIP3 requirements are still very high and are well beyond the
performance of the receiver used in this analysis.

#### 15.2.7a.9 Blocker Power Reduction
As shown in section 15.2.7a.8, the integrated receiver together with the
duplexers and filters used in this analysis were unable to provide the needed
linearity. However this architecture is used in CDMA designs. The
applicability in one case but not the other relates to the way that GSM
receivers are evaluated compared to CDMA receivers, in particular with respect
to blocking specifications.
In [27], minimum performance of cdma2000 receivers is specified. Referring to
section 3.5 of [27], it can be seen that blocker specifications are only given
for Band Class 6 mobile stations. Band Class 6 mobile stations are for the
2GHz IMT - 2000 band (TX 1920-1980MHz and RX 2110-2170MHz). As given in table
3.5.5.2-1 of [27], the in-band blocker power is -56 dBm for close in blockers,
and -44 dBm for other in-band blockers. Out of band blockers are defined in
table 3.5.5.2-2 of [27]. The out of band blocker power varies depending on
frequency offset. Closest to the desired frequency band the blocker level is
given as -44 dBm. Slightly further out the blocker level increases to -30 dBm.
Further out the blocker level rises to -15 dBm. However 24 exceptions are
allowed where the blocker level requirement is subsequently dropped to -44
dBm. Clearly these blocker levels are significantly lower than those specified
in [8] for GSM.
In all other band classes except band 6, the single tone desensitization test
applies. This test measures the receiver's ability to receive a CDMA signal on
its assigned channel frequency in the presence of a single tone spaced at a
given frequency offset from the center frequency of the assigned channel.
For the single tone desense test, the blocker power levels are -30 dBm and -40
dBm (depending on the frequency offset, see table 3.5.2.2-1 of [27]). As
described in [23], the limiting factor in this test is typically cross
modulation. The AM portion of the TX signal modulates the blocker tone which
is close to the desired signal. This is the primary consideration given to TX
signal related intermodulation in a CDMA MS.
It may be possible to make this architectural option applicable to GSM by
reducing the blocker power levels as specified in [8]. For EGSM900, in-band
and out of band blocker power levels are -23 dBm and 0 dBm respectively. For
the case where the transmitter output power is reduced to 29 dBm, the blocker
specifications need to be dropped to -34 dBm for out of band blockers and to
-35 dBm for in-band blockers in order for the receiver, duplexers, and filters
used in this analysis to have sufficient performance (see Table 268).
Maintaining the output power as per the specifications would require the in-
band blocker level to be reduced to -39 dBm and out of band blocker level
reduced to -- 50 dBm. Also, this does not consider the cross-modulation
analysis,
which may further reduce the tolerable blocker levels.
Reducing blocker levels will decrease system capacity depending on factors
such as cell radii, reuse pattern, and desense from other sources. Significant
analysis would be required to determine if this is an acceptable approach.
#### 15.2.7a.10 Summary
The analysis above has shown that it is likely not possible to build a type 2
mobile receiver (using the presented receiver architecture) with sufficient
interferer immunity, based on currently available components and the current
blocker specifications.
Even with the TX power backed off to the limit the duplexer can handle, the
required LNA IIP3 is 27.8 dBm and the required post-filter receiver IIP3 is
14.1 dBm. The required LNA IIP3 is beyond recently published integrated LNA
results [25]. Achieving this linearity in an integrated LNA while maintaining
an acceptably low noise figure and reasonable power consumption may not be
possible.
Achieving the required IIP3 performance required in the integrated post-filter
receiver may, similarly, prove difficult trading off other performance metrics
such as receiver noise figure, size, and current consumption.
The required LNA IIP2 is as high as 74.8 dBm (for the full TX power case) and
as low as 66.5 dBm (for the TX power backed off to the duplexer limit). Recent
publications regarding achievable IIP2 concentrate on mixer performance, as
the mixer appears to be the limiting component in determining the overall IIP2
performance of a direct down conversion receiver [26]. There is little
available literature concerning LNA IIP2 therefore more research is required
to determine if the requirements determined in this document can be achieved.
With the additional suppression of the second order intermodulation
interference bands provided by the filter, the post-filter receiver's IIP2
value was sufficient for all the TX power levels examined.
Improving the duplexer and filter rejection of the TX signal would reduce the
linearity requirements of the LNA and post-filter receiver. Unfortunately
there do not appear to be any duplexers or filters (SAW, BAW, or FBAR)
currently available that offer significant improvement over the ones used in
this analysis. It may be unrealistic to expect greater TX rejection,
particularly from the duplexer. Reducing the blocker power levels may make
this architecture useful for use in a type 2 mobile, however the consequences
of reducing blocker power levels must be carefully considered. More analysis
is need before this option can be considered.
The IIP3 and IIP2 values presented in this analysis considered only
intermodulation interference involving the TX signal. Other issues such as
cross modulation, and zero IF related baseband sensitivity degradation may
require even higher values of IIP2 and IIP3.

### 15.2.8a Hybrid Type 2 Architecture
#### 15.2.8a.1 Introduction
This section discusses interference in the receive band of a type 2 mobile
resulting from non-linearity in the receiver coupled with the presence of a
transmit signal. A hybrid architecture is discussed, which allows the mobile
to operate as a type 2 mobile, but also permits it to operate in type 1 mode
with less loss than the type 2 architecture imposes. Using the duplexers and
filters discussed in section 15.2.5, receiver linearity requirements (for type
2 operation) are determined with respect to TX signal power leakage and
interferer signal power (as discussed in section 15.2.2a). The performance in
type 1 mode with the hybrid architecture is compared to that of a traditional
quad-band GSM mobile to examine the additional losses. A variation is proposed
to minimize the additional losses.
#### 15.2.8a.2 Receiver performance
The RF section receiver performance and linearity values were taken from a
typical Quad Band GSM/EDGE chipset. The parameter values relevant to this
analysis are given in Table 270.

#### 15.2.8a.3 Mapping Filter Specifications
The duplexers used for this analysis are described in detail in section
15.2.5. The typical GSM receive bandpass filters and the high TX Rejection
bandpass filters are also described in that document.
#### 15.2.8a.4 Architecture Details
##### 15.2.8a.4.1 The Hybrid Type 2 Architecture
This section analyzes the intermodulation interference using the type 2 mobile
architecture shown in Figure 423. The motivation behind this hybrid
architecture is to permit the mobile to operate in type 1 (i.e. half duplex)
mode when appropriate, while minimizing the additional path loss.
As it was determined in section 15.2.6a that the standard GSM receiver filters
used in type 1 mobiles were insufficient for type 2 operation, the receive
filters considered in the hybrid architecture are the high TX rejection RX
filters that are discussed in section 15.2.5. Because the insertion loss of
these filters is slightly higher than that of the typical GSM receiver
filters, and due to the higher insertion loss from the addition of the
switches, the performance of the hybrid mobile when operating in type 1 mode
will not be equivalent to a legacy type 1 mobile, however it will be
significantly better than the performance of the basic type 2 architecture
described in section 15.2.6a.
Figure 423: Hybrid Type 2 Architecture
The hybrid type 2 mobile architecture allows the duplexers to be switched out
of the TX/RX path when not necessary. In the receive path, a SPDT switch [17]
needs to be placed before the RX filters to allow a direct path from the
antenna switch and the RF transceiver.
A SP3T switch [28] is required after the PA to allow for a bypass around the
duplex filters. When the duplexers are bypassed, a harmonic filter is required
prior to the switchplexer. This is the same as in the type 1 architecture
shown in Figure 424.
The switchplexer connecting the various RX and TX paths to the antenna
requires a SP10T switch. An example for this part was not found; therefore the
characteristics of this switch were taken from a SP9T switch [29].
The typical type 1 architecture requires a SP6T switchplexer [19] to support
the TX and RX paths. The basic type 2 architecture requires a SP4T
switchplexer [18]. The insertion losses of all the switches and switchplexers
in the transmit or receive path are given in Table 271.
Table 271: Switch and Switchplexer Insertion Losses
##### 15.2.8a.4.2 Traditional Type 1 Architecture
The traditional type 1 architecture shown in Figure 424 is used as a
performance benchmark for the hybrid architecture when operating in type 1
mode. The increased requirements for TX output power due to additional losses
in the TX path, and the loss of sensitivity due to additional losses in the RX
path are considered. The linearity requirements for this architecture are met
with the standard GSM chipset specifications as given in Table 270.
Figure 424: Typical Type 1 Architecture
#### 15.2.8a.5 Type 2 Operation Analysis
##### 15.2.8a.5.1 Assumptions
Three output power cases (as described in section 15.2.3a) for type 2
operation are considered. The interference and blocking signal frequencies and
power levels are discussed in section 15.2.2a. Analysis assumptions are given
in section 15.2.4a.
For this hybrid architecture, the required SNR is not achievable at the
specified input level for all frequency bands. The desired signal level needs
to be increased by 4 dB to overcome the increased noise figure of the receiver
in this architecture. Given the new input signal level (-95 dBm with
interference), the maximum allowable intermodulation interference for each
frequency band is given in Table 272.
Table 272: Maximum Allowable Intermodulation Interference Hybrid Architecture
##### 15.2.8a.5.2 No Maximum Output power Reduction
In this case, in order to meet this specification the PA must exceed the
specified maximum power (33 dBm for 850/900 MHz and 30 dBm for 1800/1900 MHz)
by the total passive loss to the output of the switchplexer. This output power
case illustrates the worst situation for receiver interference in this
frequency band, as the maximum amount of TX power will leak through to the RX
chain.

Table 273 shows that the TX power leakage is greatest in the EGSM 900 band.
Therefore intermodulation interference, which increases with increasing TX
signal power, is also greatest in this band, and so this band is used to
determine receiver requirements.
Table 274 shows the second order interferer power level limits (based on the
degradation limit discussed in section 15.2.8a.5.1) for different IIP2 levels.
The second order input intermodulation point of the typical transceiver chip
(42.9 dBm) was easily sufficient.

In the third order intermodulation interference analysis shown in Table 275,
it is seen that a receiver IIP3 value of 2 dBm was sufficient to meet the
blocker requirements. This value of IIP3 is in the range of values given in
published CDMA receivers ([21],[22]), suggesting this linearity figure is
likely reasonable for an integrated receiver.

#### 15.2.8a.6 Type 1 Operation -- Comparison with Legacy Terminals
##### 15.2.8a.6.1 Transmitter Path
The transmitter path of the legacy mobile and the transmitter path of the
hybrid operating in type 1 mode differ in two ways. The SP3T switch after the
PA is added, and the SP6T switchplexer is changed to an SP10T switch.
The SP3T switch has a maximum insertion loss of 0.6 dB. The maximum insertion
loss of the SP6T switchplexer in the TX path is 0.9 dB, while the maximum
insertion loss of the SP10T switch is 1.40 dB. Therefore there is a 0.5 dB
increase loss increase due to the switch. The total increase in the transmit
insertion loss for type 1 mode is 1.1 dB. The maximum insertion losses occur
for the DCS/PCS band. For a type 1 mobile in DCS/PCS, the maximum power
required at the output of the PA is (30 dBm + 0.2 dB (harmonic filter) + 0.9 B
SP6T insertion loss) = 31.1 dBm. With the assumptions given in section
15.2.8a.5, the current draw for this output is 0.68 A (during TX, assuming 1/8
duty cycle, i.e. voice).
The increase of 1.1 dB means that the PA in a hybrid architecture operating in
type 1 mode will need to put out 1.1 dB more power to have the same output
power at the antenna port of the switchplexer. Therefore the output power is
32.2 dBm. The current draw for this output is 0.87 A. This represents an
increase in power consumption during TX of approximately 29%. This will have
an impact on talk time.
##### 15.2.8a.6.2 Receiver Path
The receive path of the legacy mobile and the receive path of the hybrid
operating in type 1 mode differ in two ways. The SPDT switch is added, and the
SP6T switchplexer is changed to an SP10T switch. Also instead of typical GSM
receive filters, high TX rejection filters have had to be used.
**Maximum losses are in the DCS/PCS frequency band.** The SPDT switch has a
maximum insertion loss of 0.6 dB. The maximum insertion loss of the SP6T
switchplexer in the RX path is 1.6 dB, while the maximum insertion loss of the
SP10T switch is 1.55 dB, for a -0.05 dB difference. The typical GSM filter has
a maximum insertion loss of 3.0 dB, while the high TX rejection filter has an
insertion loss of 4.4 dB. Therefore the total increase in path loss for the
hybrid architecture operating in type 1 mode (compared to a legacy mobile) is
1.95 dB.
#### 15.2.8a.7 Type 1 Operation -- Comparison with Legacy Terminals Using a
Modified Hybrid Architecture
This increase can be significantly reduced by increasing the part count and
rearranging the architecture slightly. The modified hybrid architecture is
shown in Figure 425.
Figure 425 - Modified Hybrid Type 2 Architecture
The modification in this architecture places the standard GSM bandpass filters
between the switchplexer and the SPDT switches on the type 1 path, and places
the high TX rejection filters between the duplex filter and the SPDT switches
on the type 2 paths. This means that when operating in type 1 mode, the mobile
doesn't have to incur the additional insertion loss of the high TX rejection
filters, which aren't needed in this mode in any case. This would save 1.4 dB
of the 1.95 dB additional loss, making the different in receiver sensitivity
only 0.55 dB. The architecture change does not improve the additional loss in
the transmit path, and adding the two extra receive filters However having two
extra receive filters in the design increases the space requirements and the
BOM costs, and the benefit would have to be weighed against these costs.
#### 15.2.8a.8 Summary
This discussion document has looked at the intermodulation interference in a
hybrid type 2 mobile. While this is a significant impairment in the receiver,
there are other impairments that have not been analyzed here.
Considering only the intermodulation interference analyzed in this document,
the analysis above has shown that it is likely possible to build a hybrid type
2 mobile receiver with sufficient intermodulation immunity. If the
architecture shown in Figure 425 is utilized, the sensitivity degradation in
type 1 mode can be reduced to just a little over 0.5 dB. To address the
intermodulation interference it seems that the IIP2 of a typical GSM RF
Transceiver is sufficient, however the IIP3 would need to be increased to
approximately 2 dBm (in the case where the output power is not reduced). If it
is permissible to reduce the output power to a level tolerated by the
duplexers (30 dBm in GSM850, 29 dBm in EGSM, DCS and PCS bands at the duplexer
TX port), then the IP3 requirement is reduced to approximately -2 dBm.
With this power reduction, the maximum output power at the antenna port of the
switchplexer in GSM850 band is (30dBm - 2.0 dB - 0.9) = 27.1 dB. For EGSM900
the maximum output power would be (29dBm - 2.1 dB - 0.9 dB) = 26 dBm. For PCS
and DCS the maximum output power would be (29 dBm -- 2.1 dB - 1.15 dB) =
25.75. For GSM and EGSM a power backoff of 7 dB is required for GMSK. For
DCS/PCS a power back off of 4.25 dB is required for GMSK.
The trade offs of building such a hybrid mobile are:
  * type 2 mode of operation must operate at significantly lower output power and requires an increase of 4dB in the receive signal level for the same SNR. Thus it is only appropriate in areas of strong signal coverage
  * the increase IIP3 and C1dB of the receiver may result in a large receive IC and/or greater power consumption
  * type 1 mode of operation requires 1.1 dB greater PA output power to transmit at the same power level. This increases the current consumption when transmitting by approximately 29%.
  * there are several new parts required for this architecture, which will increase the physical size and cost to manufacturer of mobiles regardless of the mode of operation
The remaining impairments need to be analyzed to determine the full
requirements. The gains achieved with type 2 operation needs to then be
examined in light of the tradeoffs involved in the manufacturing of such a
device.
### 15.2.9 Areas for Further Study
There are several areas that need further study for this implementation. To
name a few:
  * It needs to be evaluated whether the attenuation in the paired > frequency bands that is offered by the duplex filters is enough to > meet spectral and interference requirements for GSM.
  * The impact of the duplex filter return loss (both TX and RX port) on > mismatch loss needs to be assessed.
  * The impact of the inband ripple of the duplex filters (up to 3.0 dB > at temperature extremes) on equalizer performance needs to be > assessed.
  * Current integrated circuits would have to be redesigned because of > the changes in integration and routing in the major blocks.
  * The mobile station would need to support power control in type 2 > mode. The power level changes between slots and the initially > power ramping all need to be done without impacting the receiver > performance.
  * Mobile type switching between slots should be evaluated.
```{=html}
``` \- RX Band Noise from the PA leaking into the receiver should be evaluated
band (likely insignificant, but would have an additive effect).
  * Cross modulation effects when close in blockers or adjacent channels are present (likely significant, needs a thorough and statistical analysis).
```{=html}
``` \- Reverse intermodulation products of the PA in the presence of an >
external blocker (may necessitate an isolator at the output of the > PA, which
would add more loss in the TX path).

###### ### Annex E: Detailed simulation results for reduced transmission time
interval (subclause 10.3.2)
This annex contains detailed simulation results for reduced transmission time
interval. The following notation has been used in the legends:
> Radio block format 1: One timeslot in each of four consecutive TDMA frames
> (the regular radio block mapping).
>
> Radio block format 2: Two consecutive time-slots in each of two consecutive
> TDMA frames (case i in subclause 10.3).
>
> Radio block format 3: Four consecutive time-slots in one TDMA frame (case ii
> in subclause 10.3).
Results for inter-carrier interleaving (case iii and iv in subclause 10.3)
with ideal frequency hopping are not included here since they are identical to
results with radio block format 1. Results for inter-carrier interleaving
without frequency hopping for case iv are not included since they are
identical to results with radio block format 1 with ideal frequency hopping.
