# 4 Subclauses in Mission Critical Specifications containing 4G specific
terminology
## 4.1 Introduction
Editor\'s note: To be replaced by introductory text describing the approach.
## 4.2 TS 23.280
### 4.2.1 Proposed change to 1 Scope
This document specifies the common functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support mission critical services including the
common services core architecture.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2], 3GPP
TS 22.280 [3], 3GPP TS 22.281 [4] and 3GPP TS 22.282 [5].
The present document is applicable primarily to mission critical services
using E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401
[17] [and using 5GS access based on the 5G System architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.501[X]]{.underline}. Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and
administrative functions could also be supported via non-3GPP access networks
but no additional functionality is specified to support non-3GPP access.
The common functional architecture to support mission critical services can be
used for public safety applications and also for general commercial
applications e.g. utility companies and railways.
### 4.2.2 Proposed change to 2 References
Add reference:
[[X] 3GPP TS 23.501: \"System Architecture for the 5G System\".]{.underline}
### 4.2.3 Proposed change to 3.2 Abbreviations
Insert abbreviation:
[5GC 5G Core Network]{.underline}
### 4.2.4 Proposed change to 4 Introduction
A common functional architecture to support MC services (i.e., MCPTT defined
in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], MCVideo defined in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12], MCData defined
in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]) including common application plane and signalling
plane entities is specified in this document.
Each MC service supports several types of communications amongst the users
(e.g. group call, private call). There are several common functions and
entities (e.g. group, configuration, identity) which are used by the MC
services.
The common functional architecture to support MC services utilises aspects of
the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9], the Proximity-based
Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [18] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS
23.237 [10].
The MC service UE primarily obtains access to a MC service via E-UTRAN, using
the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [17] [and using 5GS access
based on the 5G System architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501[X]]{.underline}.
Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and administrative functions can
be supported using either MC service UEs in E-UTRAN[, using MC service UEs in
5GS]{.underline} or using MC service UEs via non-3GPP access networks.
External applications usage of MC services can be enabled via E-UTRAN[,
5GS]{.underline} or non-3GPP access networks.
NOTE: Dispatch consoles and devices used by MC service administrators are
considered MC service UEs in the common functional architecture to support MC
services.
