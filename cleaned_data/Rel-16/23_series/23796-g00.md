# Introduction
The railway community\'s requirements for next generation railway
communications have been captured in 3GPP stage 1 requirements. This study
provides architectural analysis for the functionality to be specified to meet
those requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document captures architectural requirements to develop solutions
for the Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) to meet Rel-16
normative Stage 1 requirements.
The normative Stage 1 requirements are specified in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2], 3GPP
TS 22.179 [3], 3GPP TS 22.281 [4], 3GPP TS 22.282 [5] and 3GPP TS 22.289 [6].
The study uses existing 3GPP functionality and those specified for Mission
Critical Communication in normative specifications 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], 3GPP TS
23.280 [8], 3GPP TS 23.281 [9], 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] and 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] as
working basis.
This document will provide recommendations for normative work.

# 4 Scenarios
## 4.1 Interworking scenarios with GSM-R
### 4.1.1 Interworking scenarios for private calls
#### 4.1.1.1 General
There are two scenarios of private call between MCPTT system and GSM-R system.
These scenarios consider two terminals, UE A in the MCPTT system and UE B in
the GSM-R system, could initiate a private call in either direction. For
example, in a scenario UE A could initiate a private call to UE B, or UE B
could initiate a private call to UE A.
#### 4.1.1.2 MCPTT UE A initiates a private call to GSM-R UE B
Figure 4.1.1.2-1: MCPTT UE A initiates a private call to GSM-R UE B
In figure 4.1.1.2-1, MCPTT UE A is served by MCPTT system A (coloured yellow),
while GSM-R UE B is a served by GSM-R system B (coloured blue). The MCPTT and
GSM-R systems are independent and connected via the interworking interface.
MCPTT UE A initiates a private call to GSM-R UE B.
#### 4.1.1.3 GSM-R UE B initiates a private call to MCPTT UE A
Figure 4.1.1.3-1: GSM-R UE B initiates a private call to MCPTT UE A
In figure 4.1.1.3-1, MCPTT UE A is served by MCPTT system A, while GSM-R UE B
is served by GSM-R system B. The MCPTT and GSM-R systems are independent and
are connected via the interworking interface. GSM-R UE B initiates a private
call to MCPTT UE A.
### 4.1.2 Interworking scenarios for group calls
#### 4.1.2.1 Voice group communications between the systems
Figure 4.1.2.1-1: Voice group communication between the systems
**Figure 4.1.2.1-1 shows the group call scenario between MCPTT user(s) that
includes the corresponding ASCI Group Call Area/Broadcast area of the GSM-R
system.** MCPTT user A, other MCPTT users are authorized by the MCPTT system
and GSM-R users are authorized by the GSM-R system to participate. MCPTT user
A initiates a voice group call which encompasses other MCPTT users belonging
to the same group defined by the MCPTT system and the corresponding group ID
in the GSM-R system. The scenario depicted in figure 4.1.2.1-1 is applicable
to the different multiuser communication types of the MCPTT system.
For the interworking between GSM-R group/broadcast communication towards the
MCPTT system group communication the scenario described and depicted in figure
4.1.2.1-1 applies.
# 5 Key issues
## 5.1 Key issue 1 -- Allowed private communications
An MCPTT server verifies, during the private call setup, whether an MCPTT user
can initiate and receive private calls, i.e. the server verifies whether a
user is allowed to use private calls or not. The verification is described in
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] by step 4 in subclause 10.7.2.2.1 and by step 4 in
subclause 10.7.2.2.2. Further restrictions are possible by configuring for a
specific MCPTT user a list of MCPPT users to which outgoing calls are allowed.
Similar mechanisms exist for MCVideo and MCData.
New Rel-16 stage 1 requirements were agreed which shall allow to limit
incoming private communications as well by configuring MC service users from
which a specific MC service user can receive private communications.
Gaps:
\- Evaluate which existing private call setup can be re-used or must be
extended (for MCPTT, MCData and MCVideo).
\- Study which entity acts as enforcement entity and how required policies are
made available to this entity.
\- Study which configuration data is needed.
## 5.2 Key issue 2 -- Dynamic group changes based on pre-configured conditions
New Rel-16 stage 1 requirements are requesting automatic combining of users
into a temporary group based on certain criteria (3GPP TS 22.280 [2]
[R-6.6.4.2-002], [R-6.6.4.2-002a], [R-6.6.4.2-002b]). The list of users shall
be automatically updated if the criteria is met or is no longer met. The
intention of building a so-called temporary group call is to have all those
users in the group call who met the condition(s). Examples of such pre-
configured criteria are activated functional alias(es) or the location (incl.
heading and speed) of an MC service UE. The pre-configuration of the
conditions is controlled by the mission critical organisation.
Additional Rel-16 stage 1 requirements are requesting mechanisms for dynamic
group participation (3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-6.6.5.2-001], [R-6.6.5.2-002],
[R-6.6.5.2-003], [R-6.6.5.2-004], [R-6.6.5.2-005], [R-6.6.5.2-006],
[R-6.6.5.2-007]). If required, the MC system shall also prevent de-affiliation
from groups when requested by an MC service user.
Basically, both sets of requirements require dynamic group changes or dynamic
group affiliations based on pre-configured criteria.
Gaps:
\- Evaluate which existing procedures can be re-used or must be extended to
ensure dynamic group changes based on pre-configured criteria.
\- Study which entity starts to trigger initiates the entering/leaving of the
group communication and how this entity becomes aware that certain criteria
are met.
\- Study how the MC system can prevent an MC service user to trigger
affiliation/de-affiliation when this conflicts with the pre-configured
criteria.
\- Study how pre-configured criteria are stored and available when needed.
## 5.3 Key issue 3 -- Arbitration of incoming communications
The floor control procedures for group communication allow to accept, reject,
hold or queue communications but there is no possibility which supports
arbitration among different group calls, private calls or a mixture of both to
the user.
Rel-16 stage 1 requirements are requesting a mechanism for a service
administrator and/or an authorized user to set priorities for handling and
arbitration of multiple simultaneous incoming service communications for a
user (3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-5.4.2-004A], [R-5.4.2-004B]).
Gaps:
\- Evaluate existing procedures and evaluate if those can be re-used, extended
or whether new mechanisms are required.
\- Study which entity(ies) ensure(s) how multiple communications are delivered
to the user as configured.
\- Study how pre-configuration is done and provided to the enforcement
entity(ies) when needed.
## 5.4 Key issue 4 -- Providing data for a user entering an ongoing MCData
group conversation
Rel-16 stage 1 requires that a MCData user receives data that had previously
been distributed in an ongoing MCData group conversation when the MCData user
affiliates to the MCData group (3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-6.1.1.2-011]).
Gaps:
\- Evaluate for which data services such mechanism might be useful (e.g. SDS,
file distribution).
\- Study which entity stores and forwards the data.
\- Study when/how the data distribution is triggered and ensured that data is
only provided once.
\- Study which configuration management data is required (e.g. storage time,
data size, which users).
## 5.5 Key issue 5 -- Communication priority for functional aliases
Priority based communication handling for individual users is supported for
all MC services. 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] allows to configure a specific user
priority within a certain group, i.e. to prioritize users within a group
communication.
For MCPTT in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] there is the possibility to set the priority
to communications of users when they are initiating or receiving private
calls.
Communication priority in conjunction with functional aliases is missing at
all.
Gaps:
\- Study the MC application layer impacts to assign a communication priority
to every allocated functional alias.
\- Study the impact of communication priority if a functional alias can be
assigned to multiple MC service users.
\- Study the impact if a MC service user is using the functional alias during
a communication and this functional alias is taken over by another MC service
user.
\- Identify for which communication scenarios (MCPTT, MCVideo, MCData, private
call, group call or emergency call) functional alias prioritised communication
handling is useful.
\- Study if functional alias prioritised communication handling can rely on
existing procedures and evaluate if those can be re-used, must be extended or
if new mechanisms are required.
\- Clarify the relationship to those MC service users using having no priority
assigned.
\- Study which configuration data is required.
## 5.6 Key issue 6 -- Network initiated activation and de-activation of
functional alias(es)
3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.13.4 describes a procedure when a MC service
user activates functional alias(es) and subclause 10.13.5 describes when a MC
service user de-activates functional alias(es).
Within both procedures the MC service user takes the initiative to start the
functional alias(es) procedures, there are currently no procedures defined in
3GPP TS 23.280 [8] or any other MC specification where the network initiates
functional alias(es) activation/de-activation procedures.
New stage 1 requirements were agreed where the Mission Critical Organisation
can assign a time limit to a functional alias after which the functional alias
will be de-activated. In addition, the Mission Critical Service shall support
activation and de-activation of a functional alias based on operational
criteria like registration or de-registration of an MC service ID or if
triggered by any external information supplied by external systems.
Gaps:
\- Identify which entity in the MC system triggers activation or de-activation
procedures for functional alias(es) and how this entity becomes aware that
certain operational criteria are met.
\- Study if existing functional alias(es) activation and de-activation
procedures can be re-used, otherwise develop new procedures.
\- Study which configuration data is required, especially when setting a time
limit (i.e. clock time / date) to a functional alias.
5.7 Void
## 5.8 Key issue 8 -- Functional alias support enhancements for MCPTT
### 5.8.0 General
In Rel-15 functional aliases were specified for the following MCPTT group
calls:
\- Pre-arranged group calls, and
\- chat group calls.
Other MCPTT call or communication types were not addressed. According to stage
1 requirements the use of functional aliases shall be generic as there were
required in TS 22.280 [2], i.e. functional aliases shall be applicable to all
MCPTT communication types not only within regular MCPTT group calls as today.
### 5.8.1 Key issue 8-1 -- Emergency and imminent peril groups
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] contains MCPTT procedures related to emergency and imminent
peril groups for which functional alias can be supported:
\- Emergency group calls (3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.1)
\- Imminent peril group calls (3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.2)
\- Group emergency alerts (3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.3)
Gaps:
\- Identify those MCPTT procedures for which use of functional alias is
beneficial and shall be applicable.
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary and
develop new procedures if required.
\- Elaborate which configuration data is needed to support the use of
functional aliases within emergency and imminent peril groups.
### 5.8.2 Key issue 8-2 -- Private calls and private emergency calls
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] contains MCPTT procedures related to private calls and
private emergency calls for which functional alias can be supported:
\- Private calls and private emergency calls (3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.7)
Gaps:
\- Identify whether the use of functional alias is beneficial and shall be
applicable.
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary and
develop new procedures if required.
\- Elaborate what configuration data is needed to support the use of
functional aliases for private calls and private emergency calls.
### 5.8.3 Key issue 8-3 -- Temporary voice group calls
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] contains MCPTT procedures to enable temporary voice group
calls and procedures for regrouping of users for which functional alias can be
supported:
Temporary group calls - user regroup (3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.8)
Temporary user regroup using group creation procedure (3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
subclause 10.6.2.10)
Gaps:
\- Identify whether the use of functional alias is beneficial and shall be
applicable.
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary and
develop new procedures if required.
\- Elaborate what configuration data is needed to support the use of
functional aliases for temporary group calls.
### 5.8.4 Key issue 8-4 -- Ambient listening and remotely initiated calls
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] contains MCPTT procedures to enable ambient listening and
remotely initiated calls for which functional alias can be supported:
\- Ambient listening call (3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.14)
\- Remotely initiated calls (3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.16)
Gaps:
\- Identify whether the use of functional alias is beneficial and shall be
applicable.
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary and
develop new procedures if required.
\- Elaborate what configuration data is needed to support the use of
functional aliases for ambient listening and remotely initiated calls.
### 5.8.5 Key issue 8-5 -- Use of location dependent functional aliases for
private calls
According requirement [R-5.9a-019] in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] the use of functional
aliases within private calls can be location dependent, i.e. a functional
alias is only active when the MC service client location matches to the
location applicable for that functional alias.
Functional aliases have no geographic relationship so far.
Gaps:
\- Further clarify the scenarios and use cases and discuss possible solution
principles.
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary and
develop new procedures if required.
\- Elaborate the configuration data is needed to support location dependent
private call delivery.
### 5.8.6 Key issue 8-6 -- Call restrictions when using functional aliases for
private calls
The requirements [R-5.9a-020], [R-5.9a-021] and [R-5.9a-022] in 3GPP TS 22.280
[2] address call restrictions for outgoing and incoming private calls in
relationship with functional aliases, i.e. an MC service user using a certain
functional alias can have private calls only with those MC service users using
certain (other) functional aliases.
Nothing has been specified yet, i.e. no related functionality is supported by
the MC service server nor configurable with the configuration data.
Gaps:
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary and
develop new procedures if required.
\- Clarify whether there are any implications with existing call restriction
based on the MC service ID.
\- Elaborate which configuration data is needed to perform call restrictions
as requested.
### 5.8.7 Key issue 8-7 -- Multiple use of a functional alias for private
calls
The requirements [R-5.9a-023] and [R-5.9a-024] in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] address
the case when multiple MC service users are using the same functional alias.
Such scenario is not really covered by the mission critical system as defined
today.
Nothing is specified in respect to simultaneous use of functional aliases (by
several MC service users) for private calls delivery.
Gaps:
\- Clarify whether any existing procedures or concepts can be re-used and if
not, develop new mechanism.
\- Clarify whether there are any implications with existing mechanisms or
configurations (see above, e.g. multiple UEs).
\- Elaborate which configuration data is needed to support the requested call
delivery types (i.e. sequential/parallel calling).
### 5.8.8 Key issue 8-8 -- Limit the number of parallel emergency group
communications
MCPTT emergency group call procedures are described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
subclause 10.6.2.6.1 [7] and those do not allow to control the number of
parallel emergency group calls for a user as requested by 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]
[R-5.4.2-007a].
Both stage 1 requirements are service generic, i.e. they are also applicable
to MCData and MCVideo. Even not stated clearly, it is assumed that any
restrictions are applied for each service individually and the focus is on
MCPTT.
Gaps:
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary or
develop new procedures, if required.
\- Elaborate which configuration data is needed.
## 5.9 Key issue 9 -- Functional alias used via broadcast
Today functional aliases are not used via broadcast, neither for MCPTT,
MCVideo nor MCData services.
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] and 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] contain
procedures for communications using broadcast and for that functional alias
can be supported:
\- Group calls using broadcast (3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.5.2)
\- Group short data service (SDS) and group file distribution (FD) using
broadcast (3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4 and subclause 7.5)
\- Group video calls using broadcast (3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.10)
Gaps:
\- Identify for the procedures using broadcast where the use of functional
alias is useful and shall be applicable.
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary or create
new procedures if required.
\- Elaborate whether any changes to configuration data are needed.
## 5.10 Key issue 10 -- Functional alias using off-network communication mode
Today functional aliases are not used in off-network communication mode,
neither for MCPTT, MCVideo nor MCData services.
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] and 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] contain
procedures to have communications using broadcast and for that functional
alias can be supported:
\- Short data service (SDS) and File distribution (FD) (see 3GPP TS 23.282
[10] subclause 7.4 and subclause 7.5)
\- MCPTT calls using off-network communication mode (for various voice call
types, see 3GPP TS 23.379 [7])
\- MCVideo using off-network communication mode (for various video call
scenarios, see 3GPP TS 23.281 [9])
Gaps:
\- Identify for which procedures from the above set of services the use of
functional alias is useful and shall be applicable.
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary and
create new procedures if required.
\- Elaborate if changes to configuration data are needed to support off-
network support for functional aliases in conjunction with MCPTT, MCData and
MCVideo.
## 5.11 Key issue 11 -- Multiple functional alias use
A functional alias can be used by multiple MC service users simultaneously.
A functional alias may also be used for different services by one or by
different MC service users.
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] and 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] contain the
procedures which may be impacted by the multiple use of functional aliases.
Gaps:
\- Study the impact of multiple associations of a single functional alias.
\- Study the impacts of using a single functional alias by different services.
\- Identify if modifications are needed to existing procedures based on
identified impacts.
\- Elaborate if changes to configuration data are needed.
## 5.12 Key issue 12 -- Functional alias support for MCData
### 5.12.0 General
According stage 1 requirements the use of functional aliases shall be
applicable to all MC services, i.e. also for MCData.
For none of the existing MCData services the use of functional alias is
supported.

and subclause 7.4)
Gaps:
\- Identify for which of the above emergency call types the use of functional
alias is useful and applicable.
\- Elaborate which modifications to existing procedures are needed and specify
new procedures if necessary.
\- Describe the required configuration data.
### 5.13.4 Key issue 13-4 -- Video control functions
Video emergency call procedures are described in 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] for which
functional alias support can be supported:
\- Capability information sharing (3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.5)
\- Transmission control (3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.7)
\- MCVideo client query (3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.16)
\- MCVideo adaptation during MCVideo communication (3GPP TS 23.281 [9]
subclause 7.17)
Gaps:
\- Identify for which of the above control functions the use of functional
alias is useful and applicable.
\- Elaborate which modifications to existing procedures are needed and specify
new procedures if necessary.
\- Describe the required configuration data.
### 5.13.5 Key issue 13-5 -- Ambient viewing call
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] contain MCPTT procedures to enable ambient listening and
remotely initiated calls for which functional alias can be supported:
\- Ambient viewing call (3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.6)
Gaps:
\- Identify whether the use of functional alias is beneficial and shall be
applicable.
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary and
develop new procedures if required.
\- Elaborate which configuration data is needed to support the use of
functional aliases for an ambient viewing call.
## 5.14 Key issue 14 -- Location information of an MC service user using a
specific functional alias
3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.9 contains the message flows for location
information and the related procedures. Subclause 10.9.3.3 provides a client-
triggered location reporting procedure. The client-triggered location
reporting procedure relies on two other procedures described in subclause
10.9.3.1 describing an event-triggered location reporting procedure and in
subclause 10.9.3.2 describing an on-demand location reporting procedure. The
first procedure also allows to request periodic location information, if
requested.
A new stage 1 requirement was agreed which shall provide a means for an
authorized MC service user to activate a one-time location information report
of an MC service user or periodic location information update reports of an MC
service user having activated a specific functional alias.
Within 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.9 all messages flows use the MC service
ID to identify the requesting MC service user and the MC service user whose
location information is requested. Currently the use of functional alias(es)
is not considered in subclause 10.9.
The location management server is part of the common core, whereas the MC
service server is aware of (and controls) the current binding between the MC
service ID and the functional alias.
Gaps:
\- Study which modifications to existing procedures or whether new procedures
are required to provide means for an authorized MC service user to request the
location information from another MC service users using a specific functional
alias.
\- Study whether the required location retrieval functionalities have any
architectural implications.
\- Study which configuration data is needed.
## 5.15 Key issue 15 -- Prevent de-affiliation when using a specific
functional alias(es)
3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.8.4.2 describes the MC service group de-
affiliation procedure. In step 2 of this procedure the MC service server
checks if the user of the MC service client is authorized to de-affiliate from
the requested MC service group(s).
New stage 1 requirements were agreed which shall allow the MC system
\- to prevent the MC service user from de-affiliation when a certain
functional alias is used, or
\- to prevent de-affiliation from an MC service user when the MC service user
is the only user using a specific functional alias.
Currently the authorisation checks done by the MC service server in step 2 do
not take the use of functional alias(es) into account and there are no rules
or configuration data which allows to prevent the MC service client from
sending de-affiliation requests.
NOTE: The MC service user can select an activated functional alias for use
within a certain group communication, which may become the criteria to prevent
de-affiliation.
Gaps:
\- Study which mechanisms and configuration data are required to prevent the
MC service client from de-affiliation when a specific functional alias is
used.
\- Study how existing de-affiliation procedures can be extended, and which
additional configuration data is needed to prevent that an MC service user de-
affiliates from a MC service group when the MC service user is the only
(remaining) user using a specific functional alias in that group.
\- Study how a MC service server and/or a MC service client knows which
functional alias activated by a user is to be used to prevent de-affiliation
on a group.
\- Study whether there is an interaction between needing to prevent de-
affiliation to the group and preventing the MC service user from deselecting
the functional alias.
## 5.16 Key issue 16 -- Interworking with GSM-R
### 5.16.0 General
As indicated in normative stage 1 requirements for GSM-R interworking in 3GPP
TS 22.280 [2], 3GPP TS 22.179 [3], 3GPP TS 22.282 [5] and subclause 4 about
the interworking scenarios with GSM-R, the following aspects are required for
interworking with GSM-R:
\- Functional alias and alternative user addressing scheme used in GSM-R.
\- Interworking between an MCPTT group call and advanced speech call items
used in GSM-R.
\- Private call between an MCPTT user and a GSM-R mobile station or
controller.
\- Bi-directional interworking for MCPTT user positioning information and the
location information provided for a GSM-R mobile station.
\- Bi-directional interworking between the MCData SDS and GSM-R SMS.
### 5.16.1 Key issue 16-1 - Functional alias and alternative addressing scheme
for interworking with GSM-R
In MCPTT system, the MCPTT server provides the centralized control for
functional alias management including functional alias activation,
deactivation, take over and retrieval to maintain the association between the
MCPTT ID and the functional alias. However, addressing schemes used in GSM-R
are different.
Gaps:
\- Bi-directional protocol translation between the MCPTT system and the GSM-R
system.
\- Mapping between the functional alias of the MCPTT user in the MCPTT system
and the function address of the GSM-R user used in the GSM-R system.
\- Determine impact on interworking of functionality introduced for functional
alias in MCPTT that is not available in GSM-R. These are for example:
\- Functional alias shared between multiple MCPTT users.
\- Functional alias allowed to be taken over.
\- Time limit after which the functional alias will be automatically
deactivated.
### 5.16.2 Key issue 16-2 - Interworking between MCPTT group call and advanced
speech call items used in GSM-R
There are differences between the group call mechanism in MCPTT system and the
advanced speech call items mechanisms such as voice broadcast service (VBS)
and voice group call service (VGCS) in GSM-R system considering aspects
including group identity, codec, floor control and protocol, etc.
Gaps:
\- Mapping of the group identity in the MCPTT system and the group identity in
the GSM-R system; and
\- Floor control arbitration between the MCPTT system and the GSM-R system
during a group communication.
\- Determine the controlling system of the group call; and
\- Reconciling codecs used for communication between users in GSM-R system and
MCPTT system.
\- Handling of the fact that there is no PTT indication available on the GSM-R
side to drive the behaviour of multi talker control on the MCPTT side.
\- Handling of the fact that GSM-R has an explicit procedure to terminate a
group call by an authorized user, whereas in MCPTT a group call is terminated
by the MCPTT server based on criteria.
\- Determine how to handle the different call related timers on both systems,
like for example inactivity timers.
### 5.16.3 Key issue 16-3 - Private call between an MCPTT user and a GSM-R
mobile station or controller
There are differences between the private call mechanism in MCPTT system and
private call mechanism in GSM-R system considering aspects including user
identity, codec, floor control and protocol, etc.
Gaps:
\- Mapping of the user identity in the MCPTT system and the mobile station
identity in the GSM-R system.
\- Floor control arbitration between the MCPTT system and the GSM-R system
during a private communication; and
\- Reconciling codecs used for communication between users in the GSM-R system
and the MCPTT system.
\- Determine interaction of auto/manual commencement mode in MCPTT and auto
answer functionality in GSM-R.
\- Handling of audible ringing, usage of early media.
### 5.16.4 Key issue 16-4 - Bi-directional interworking for MCPTT user
positioning information and location information provided for a GSM-R mobile
station
The formats of the positioning information of the MCPTT user in the MCPTT
system and the location information of the GSM-R mobile station in the GSM-R
system are not compatible. Location of the user is used to initiate group call
or private call for interworking with GSM-R.
Gaps:
\- Location format conversion.
\- Synchronisation of user location information between the MCPTT system and
the GSM-R system.
### 5.16.5 Key issue 16-5 - Bi-directional interworking between MCData SDS and
GSM-R SMS
There are differences between MCData SDS and SMS in GSM-R considering aspects
including user identity, processing, storage, delivery receipt, protocols,
etc.
Gaps:
\- Determine impact of different size limitations for MCData SDS and GSM-R SMS
\- Mapping of the user identity in the MCData system and the mobile station
identity in the GSM-R system
\- Mapping of functional alias in the MCData system and Functional Number in
the GSM-R system
\- Determine impact of store and forward principle in GSM-R SMS on MCData SDS
principles
\- Determine impact of MCData SDS read and delivery receipt and GSM-R delivery
receipt
\- Determine impact on interworking for one to one messaging and group
messaging
NOTE: It is assumed that the identities used from the IWF to the 3GPP MC
system will be the native MC service identities.
## 5.17 Key issue 17 -- Provide a list of currently affiliated members of an
MC service group associated with the activated functional alias(es)
[R-5.9a-029] requires that the MC service shall provide, upon request, the
list of currently affiliated members of an MC service group which encompasses
the MC service ID and the associated functional alias(es) of each member in
accordance with subclause 6.4.5 (see 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]).
3GPP TS 23.280 describes membership and affiliation list queries in subclause
10.2.5 and the functional alias management procedures are described in
subclause 10.13. Groups and functional alias(es) are configured independently
for a specific user, i.e. there is no linkage between both configuration data
as such.
The network handles the group management within the group management server,
but the affiliation status (which is part of the dynamic data) is stored in
the (controlling) MC service server. The MC service server also captures the
activation status of functional aliases.
Gaps:
\- Study which modifications to existing procedures or whether new procedures
are required.
\- Study whether there are any architectural implications.
\- Study which configuration data is needed.
## 5.18 Key issue 18 -- List of MCPTT group members who did not acknowledge
the group call request
According requirement [R-6.2.1-010a] in 3GPP TS 22.179 [3] the initiating
MCPTT user of an MCPTT group call shall receive a list of those MCPTT group
members, who were required to acknowledge the group call request but did not
acknowledge the call.
Current standard provides means which allows the initiating MCPTT user to
receive a list of those users who are not required to acknowledge the call,
but a list who did not acknowledge the call is missing.
Gaps:
\- Clarify whether an acknowledgement from the MC service client or the MC
service user is relevant.
\- Clarify which group call procedures described in 3GPP TS 22.179 [3] are
relevant.
\- Describe which modifications are required on existing procedures and
information flows.
\- Elaborate if any additional configuration data is required and if yes,
describe it.
## 5.19 Key issue 19 -- Limit the number of simultaneous successful service
authorizations
Requirement [R-5.10-001a] in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] requests that the MC system
shall be able to allow to limit the number of simultaneous log ins of an MC
service user to multiple MC service clients.
Current standard does not provide any means which allow to configure and
control the maximum number of successful simultaneous service authorizations
of clients from a MC service user.
Gaps:
\- Clarify which functional entity or layer (application, signalling) can
enforce the configured maximum upper limit of successful service
authorizations per MC service user to an MC service client.
\- Identify whether any existing procedure can be re-used and describe the
required changes. If the candidate procedure is outside the scope of SA6 than
involve the relevant group (e.g. SA3).
\- Depending on the outcome of the previous bullet, consider which additional
configuration data is required and clarify whether those are service specific.
## 5.20 Key issue 20 -- User requests application layer priorities
New stage 1 requirements have been defined requesting support for additional
capabilities involving priorities for communications within the application
layer (3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-6.8.7.2-006], [R-6.8.7.2-007], [R-6.8.7.2-008],
[R-6.8.7.2-009], [R-6.8.7.2-010]). The existing standard has already defined
priorities for different communication types and related mechanism to
prioritise communications when needed. The new requirements define the need
for mechanisms where the MC service user can request for a certain priority,
i.e. it is not the MC system which, based on configuration, assigns priorities
to certain communication types or events, independent from the MC service
users\' preference.
Gaps:
\- Study how the user can request application priorities for certain
communications.
\- Study the implications of the existing application priority handling when
the MC service user has the possibility to request for certain priorities.
\- Develop procedures or solutions which allow the MC system to control and
negotiate priority requests coming from an MC service user.
\- Study which configuration data is required to control priority requests and
to guarantee minimum priority levels if the MC service user has not requested
any priority for a certain communication.
## 5.21 Key issue 21 -- Group creation using functional aliases
Group management procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause
10.2. These procedures do not support the use of functional aliases.
Gaps:
\- Study how group management procedures can support functional alias.
\- Study whether there are any architectural implications.
\- Study necessary changes to the configuration data.
## 5.22 Key issue 22 -- Application layer IP connectivity
Stage 1 requirements have been defined requesting support for application
layer IP connectivity. The existing standard has already defined the service
subtypes i.e. Short Data Services, File Distribution, Data Streaming
capability.
The intention of application layer enabled IP connectivity is a bidirectional
exchange of user data without message size limitations.
Application layer IP connectivity is applicable for on-network off-network
operation.
Gaps:
\- Study the necessary extension of the present on-network and off-network
functional architecture defined for MCData services;
\- Study the necessary extensions of the MCData user profile;
\- Study the necessary extensions for specifying the MCData IP connectivity
service;
\- Study the necessary extensions of MCData transmission control and reception
control procedures;
\- Study how an authorised MCData user can obtain IP connectivity towards a
server located in an external network;
\- Study the impact if functional alias for MCData user addressing is used;
\- Study the impact on end-to-end user data encryption among MCData users or
between MCData user and the involved external or internal server(s).
## 5.23 Key issue 23 -- Gateway UE function
Stage 1 requirements have been defined requesting support for gateway UE
functionality.
Figure 5.23-1 shows an example for using gateway UEs for rail communication:
{width="6.516666666666667in" height="2.796527777777778in"}
Figure 5.23-1: Gateway UE function for railways
The intention is to allow multiple MC Service users to access the MC Service
system by using one or multiple gateway UEs ensuring the integrity of
communication of each individual MC Service user.
Gaps:
\- Study required definitions and scope for a gateway UE;
\- Study the necessary extension of the On-network functional model;
\- Study the implications for the bearer/MBMS bearer management;
\- Study the implications to affiliation/de-affiliation mechanisms;
\- Study the necessary extensions for the management of the authorised MC
Service user on a gateway UE;
## 5.24 Key issue 24 -- Automatic start of an emergency group communication
after an emergency group alert
MCPTT group emergency alert procedures are described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
subclause 10.6.2.6.3 [7] and do not provide any option to configure that the
initiation of an emergency alert automatically triggers an emergency group
communication as requested by 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-5.6.2.4.1-013].
Stage 1 requirements are service generic, i.e. they are also applicable to
MCData and MCVideo.
Gaps:
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary or
develop new procedures, if required.
\- Elaborate which configuration data is needed.
## 5.25 Key issue 25 -- Additional commencement conditions for MCPTT group
call setup
The following stage 1 requirements define commencement conditions when setting
up an MCPTT group call.
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] describes MCPTT group call procedures for two group call
models, the pre-arranged group call model and the chat group call group model.
Currently both models do not support the above commencement conditions.
\- 3GPP TS 22.179 [3] [R-6.2.1-001a] requires that the MCPTT system allows an
MCPTT group call setup request to proceed only if a minimum number of group
members are currently affiliated.
\- 3GPP TS 22.179 [3] [R-6.2.1-001b] requires that the MCPTT system allows an
MCPTT group call setup request to proceed only if specific MCPTT group
member(s) are currently affiliated.
Gaps:
\- Identify for which group call models the commencement conditions shall be
applicable.
\- Identify which entity within the MCPTT system enforces the commencement
conditions.
\- Identify which modifications to existing procedures are necessary and
develop new procedures if required.
\- Elaborate which configuration data is needed.
## 5.26 Key issue 26 -- Call forwarding and call transfer for private calls
Stage 1 requirements have been defined requesting support for call fowarding
and call transfer for private calls with and without floor control. The
requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [3] [R-5.6.3-014], [R-5.6.3-015],
[R-6.7.4-015], and [R-6.7.4-016.].
Gaps related to call forwarding:
\- Study possibilities to control if an MCPTT user is authorised to activate
call forwarding for private call with and without floor control.
\- Study possibilities on where to store the different conditions to be
covered: Always, for MCPTT user not reachable, for incoming private calls with
manual commencement mode if the MCPTT user does not answer within a configured
period, Based on manual input by the MCPTT user.
\- Study how to change the target MCPTT users for the different conditions.
\- Study how to enable/disable call forwarding for the different conditions.
\- Study how to set the target MCPTT user entered via manual input.
\- Identify the impact on the existing service logic for private call with and
without floor control.
Gaps related to call transfer:
\- Study on how to control if an MCPTT user is authorised to perform a call
transfer for private call with and without floor control.
\- Study on.how the MCPTT client can indicate to the MCPTT application server
that the ongoing private call with or without floor control has to be
transferred.
\- Identify the impact on the existing service logic for private call with and
without floor control
Editor\'s note: Call forwarding busy is FFS.
Editor\'s note: For both call forwarding, and call transfer the handling of
functional alias is FFS.

### 6.1.1 Description
\
# 7 Solutions
## 7.1 Solution 1 -- Restricting incoming private communications
### 7.1.1 Solution description
#### 7.1.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #1 described in subclause 5.1 on limiting
private communications.
According stage 1 requirements (3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-6.7.3-007],
[R-6.7.3-007a]) an MC service user shall only have private communications with
those MC service users which are configured, whereas private communications
with other MC service users shall not be allowed. Existing solutions already
allow to limit outgoing private communications, related solutions for incoming
private communications are missing.
#### 7.1.1.2 Mission Critical Push-to-Talk
7.1.1.2.1 Private call setup procedures
An MCPTT server verifies whether an MCPTT user can initiate and receive
private calls, i.e. the server verifies whether a user is allowed to use
private calls as such. The verification is described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] by
step 4 in subclause 10.7.2.2.1 and by step 4 in subclause 10.7.2.2.2. Further
restrictions are possible when configuring for a specific MCPTT user a list of
MCPPT users to which outgoing calls are allowed. The list of MCPTT users is
part of the MCPTT user profile configuration data and is available in the
MCPTT server acting as policy enforcement entity. To restrict incoming private
calls, the MCPTT user profile configuration data can be enhanced by adding a
list of those MCPPT users from which private calls are allowed. The MCPTT
server acts as the policy enforcement entity for incoming private calls as for
outgoing private calls with the current specification.
7.1.1.2.2 Configuration data for private calls
To limit the MCPTT users from which private MCPTT calls can be received, the
following user profile configuration data needs to be added:
Table 7.1.1.2.2-1: MCPTT user profile data (on and off network)
* * *
Reference Parameter description MCPTT UE MCPTT Server Configuration management

* * *
NOTE: In current table A.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [8], the requirement
[R-6.7.4-004] of should be moved from line \"List of user(s) who can be called
in private call\" down to line \"> Presentation priority relative to other
users and groups (see NOTE 2)\". And requirement [R-6.7.3-007] should be added
to line \"List of user(s) who can be called in private call\". Additionally,
the MCPTT Server should not be configured with the User info ID and ProSe
discovery group ID.
#### 7.1.1.3 Mission Critical Video
##### 7.1.1.3.1 Private video call setup procedures
An MCVideo server authorizes whether an MCVideo user is authorized to initiate
a private video call and whether the other MCVideo user is authorized to
receive the private video call. The authorization is described in 3GPP TS
23.281 [9] by step 3 in subclause 7.2.2.3.1 (automatic commencement mode) and
by step 3 in subclause 7.2.2.3.2 (manual commencement mode). Current standard
allows to define a list of MCVideo user(s) who can be called. The list of
MCVideo users is part of the MCVideo user profile configuration data and is
available in the MCVideo server. To restrict incoming private video calls as
well, the MCVideo user profile configuration data can be enhanced by adding a
list of those MCVideo users from which private video calls are allowed. The
MCVideo server can act as the policy enforcement entity for incoming private
video calls as for outgoing private video calls today.
##### 7.1.1.3.2 Configuration data for private video calls
To limit the MCVideo users from which private MCVideo calls can be received,
the following user profile configuration data needs to be added:
Table 7.1.1.3.2-1: MCVideo user profile data (on and off network)

NOTE: Current table A.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] does not contain a row on
authorised to make a private video call to users not included in \"list of
user(s) to which private video calls can be made\".
#### 7.1.1.4 Mission Critical Data
##### 7.1.1.4.1 One-to-one communication procedures
An MCData server authorizes whether an MCData user is authorized to initiate a
one-to-one communication. The authorization is described in 3GPP TS 23.282
[10]:
\- step 3 in subclause 7.4.2.2 (One-to-one standalone short data service using
signalling control plane)
\- step 3 in subclause 7.4.2.3 (One-to-one standalone short data service using
media plane)
\- step 3 in subclause 7.4.2.4 (One-to-one short data service session)
\- step 3 in subclause 7.5.2.4 (One-to-one file distribution using HTTP)
\- step 3 in subclause 7.5.2.5 (One-to-one file distribution using media
plane)
Current standard allows to define a list of MCData user(s) this MCData user is
authorized to initiate a one to-one communication. The list of MCData users is
part of the MCData user profile configuration data and is available in the
MCData server. To restrict incoming private video calls as well, the MCVideo
user profile configuration data can be enhanced by adding a list of those
MCData users from which one-to-one communications are allowed. The MCData
server can act as the policy enforcement entity for incoming one-to-one
communications as for outgoing one-to-one communications today.
##### 7.1.1.4.2 Configuration data for one-to-one communication
To limit the MCData users from which one-to-one communications can be
received, the following user profile configuration data needs to be added:

### 7.1.2 Solution evaluation
The solution uses existing functionalities without requiring architectural
changes.
There are no changes to existing procedures needed.
The MC service user profile configuration data must be extended.
## 7.2 Solution 2 -- Implicit activation and deactivation of functional
alias(es)
### 7.2.1 Solution description
#### 7.2.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #6 described in subclause 5.6 on network
initiated activation and deactivation of functional alias(es).
According stage 1 requirement 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-5.9a-017] the mission
critical organisation can assign a time limit to a functional alias after
which the functional alias will be deactivated.
Another stage 1 requirement 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-5.9a-018]) shall support
activation and deactivation of a functional alias based on operational
criteria like registration or de-registration of an MC service ID or if
triggered by any external information supplied by external systems, which are
not further elaborated.
For both requirements implicit functional alias status change procedures are
needed, so far functional alias activation and deactivation is triggered by
the MC service client.
#### 7.2.1.2 Implicit activation of functional alias(es) within an MC system
The procedure for implicit activation of functional alias(es) within an MC
system is illustrated in figure 7.2.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service server may have retrieved the user subscription and functional
alias policy e.g. which user(s) are authorized to activate to what functional
alias, priority, and other configuration data.
2\. MC service client has already been provisioned (statically or dynamically)
with the functional alias(es) information that the MC service client is
allowed to activate.
3\. The condition for functional alias(es) activation is met. The trigger may
come from internal or external MC system information. The MC service server
checks if there are any conflicts with active functional alias(es).

1\. The MC service server checks if there are any conflicts with active
functional alias(es).
If a certain functional alias(es) can be simultaneously active for multiple MC
service users and the upper limit of number of simultaneous MC service users
is not reached, the MC service shall activate the functional alias(es) for the
MC service user and inform all other MC service user(s) with sharing the same
functional alias(es) (step 4).
If the limit of number of simultaneous MC service users is reached or the
functional alias is not allowed to be shared then the MC service server does
not proceed with the functional alias(es) activation procedure or takes over
the functional alias from the MC service user currently using the functional
alias(es).
2\. MC service server notifies the MC service client about the activation of
the functional alias(es).
3\. The MC service server stores the functional alias(es) status for the
functional alias(es), including date/time of activation.
4\. The MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) sharing the
same functional alias(es).
#### 7.2.1.3 Implicit deactivation of functional alias(es) within an MC system
The procedure for implicit deactivation of functional alias(es) within an MC
system is illustrated in figure 7.2.1.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service server has already subscribed to the functional alias(es)
information from the functional alias management server and has stored the
data of the functional alias(es) a MC service user has activated.
2\. The condition for functional alias(es) deactivation is met. The trigger
may come from internal or external MC system information.

### 7.2.2 Solution evaluation
The solution uses existing functionalities without requiring architectural
changes but requires new procedures to be specified.
## 7.3 Solution 3 -- Client performs automatic group affiliation/de-
affiliation
### 7.3.1 Solution description
#### 7.3.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #2 described in subclause 5.2 on dynamic
group changes based on pre-configured conditions.
Stage 1 requirements (3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-6.6.4.2-002], [R-6.6.4.2-002a] and
[R-6.6.4.2-002b]) are requesting automatic user regrouping based on a variety
of pre-configured criteria controlled by the mission critical organisation
(e.g. functional alias activated, current location). Other requirements (3GPP
TS 22.280 [2] [R-6.6.5.2-001], [R-6.6.5.2-002], [R-6.6.5.2-003],
[R-6.6.5.2-004], [R-6.6.5.2-005], [R-6.6.5.2-006], [R-6.6.5.2-007]) request
dynamic group participation. Basically, both sets of requirements shall enable
that the list of affiliated users to certain groups shall be updated, if
criteria are met or are no longer met. In addition, manually triggered de-
affiliation may be prevented in some cases of automatic affiliation to a
group.
#### 7.3.1.2 Solution principles
It is suggested to re-use existing affiliation/de-affiliation procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.8 to perform automatic re-
grouping. Especially the client-initiated affiliation/de-affiliation
procedures are needed as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.8.3.1
and 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.8.4.2. As existing client-initiated
affiliation/de-affiliation procedures are used, and it is further assumed that
the user of the client is already configured as a member of the group, the
trigger criteria defined by the mission critical organisation require special
focus, i.e. additional configuration management data is required to be
specified in order to control the client behaviour.

The MC service specific user profile configuration data are extended.
## 7.4 Solution 4 -- Support of functional aliases in private calls and
private emergency calls
### 7.4.1 Solution description
#### 7.4.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #8-2 described in subclause 5.8.3 on support
of functional aliases private calls and private emergency calls.
Private calls (within one MCPTT system) are described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
subclause 10.7.2.2. Two variants were specified: Private call setup in
automatic commencement mode in subclause 10.7.2.2.1 and private call setup in
manual commencement mode in subclause 10.7.2.2.2.
MCPTT emergency private calls are described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.7.2.4. Two procedures were specified: MCPTT emergency private call
commencement in subclause 10.7.2.4.1 and MCPTT private call emergency upgrade
in subclause 10.7.2.4.2.
NOTE: Scenarios when multiple users share the same functional alias are not
considered.
#### 7.4.1.2 Private calls using functional aliases
Figure 7.4.1.2-1 below illustrates the private call setup procedure (automatic
commencement mode) based on the private call setup in automatic commencement
mode in described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.2.2.1:
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.2.2.1.
2\. Optionally, the MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 may have an activated
functional alias to be used.
{width="3.9069444444444446in" height="3.252083333333333in"}
Figure 7.4.1.2-1: Private call setup using functional aliases
1\. MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCPTT service.
2\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call to the
chosen MCPTT user by using a functional alias.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server. The MCPTT private call request contains the functional alias (instead
of the MCPTT ID) of invited user and, optionally, a functional alias of the
calling user.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized
to initiate the private call and whether the provided functional alias, if
present, can be used and has been activated for the user. The MCPTT server
checks whether MCPTT client 1 is allowed to use the functional alias of MCPTT
client 2 to setup a private call and whether MCPTT client 2 is allowed to
receive a private call from MCPTT client 1 using a functional alias. The MCPTT
server uses the functional alias of the called user to identify the related
MCPTT ID of MCPTT client 2 and checks if it is authorized to receive the
private call. To identify the MCPTT ID of the called user, the functional
alias must have been activated.
5\. MCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
6\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT client
2, including the MCPTT ID and the functional alias of the calling MCPTT user 1
and the called MCPTT user 2.
7\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private
call and displays the functional alias of calling MCPTT user 1.
8\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an MCPTT private call response is sent to the MCPTT server.
9\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client
1 about successful call establishment.
10\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 have successfully established media
plane for communication and either user can transmit media.
NOTE: The clients use the same functional alias within floor control
procedures as used during private call setup.
For the following messages the functional alias of the calling party and the
called party must be added (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]):
\- 10.7.2.1.1 MCPTT private call request (MCPTT client to MCPTT server)
\- 10.7.2.1.2 MCPTT private call request (MCPTT server to MCPTT server for
several MCPTT systems)
\- 10.7.2.1.2a MCPTT private call request (MCPTT server to MCPTT client)
Similar changes as above are needed for the private call release procedures
described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.2.2.3, i.e. adding functional
aliases to the private call end request message (subclause 10.7.2.1.4a) and
the private call end response message (subclause 10.7.2.1.4b) and perform
related authorisation checks in the MCPTT server.
The MCPTT user profile configuration data in Annex A.3 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
is enhanced by a list of functional alias which can be called within private
calls.

NOTE: A list of user(s) who can be called in private call already exists in
3GPP TS 23.379 [7], those users are identified by the MCPTT ID.
#### 7.4.1.3 MCPTT private emergency calls using functional aliases
Figure 7.4.1.3-1 below illustrates when the MCPTT client initiating
establishment of an MCPTT emergency private call based on the MCPTT emergency
private call commencement procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.7.2.4.1:
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.2.4.1.
2\. Optionally, the MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 may have an activated
functional alias to be used.
{width="4.249305555555556in" height="4.257638888888889in"}
Figure 7.4.1.3-1 MCPTT emergency private call using functional aliases
1\. The user of MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency private call by
using the functional alias of the user of MCPTT client 2.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency private call request towards the
MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency and
the functional alias of MCPTT client 2. The request may also contain the
functional alias of calling MCPTT client 1. The MCPTT server checks whether
the functional alias of MCPTT client 1, if present, can be used and has been
activated for the user. The MCPTT server uses the functional alias of the
called user to identify the related MCPTT ID of MCPTT client 2. To identify
the MCPTT ID of the called user, the functional alias must have been
activated.
3\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency private call request towards the
target MCPTT client. The request contains an indication of an MCPTT emergency
alert if the request from the originator indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
4\. The MCPTT user on MCPTT client 2 is notified of the incoming MCPTT
emergency private call and, if present, the functional alias of the calling
MCPTT user 1 is displayed.
The procedure is continued as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.7.2.4.1.
For the following messages the functional alias of the calling party and the
called party must be added (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]):
\- 10.7.2.1.5 MCPTT emergency private call request (MCPTT client to MCPTT
server)
\- 10.7.2.1.5a MCPTT emergency private call request (MCPTT server to MCPTT
client)
Same changes as above are needed for the MCPTT private call emergency upgrade
procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.2.4.2, i.e. adding
functional aliases to the MCPTT emergency private call request messages
(subclause 10.7.2.1.5 and subclause 10.7.2.1.5a) and perform related
authorisation checks in the MCPTT server.
The MCPTT user profile configuration data in Annex A.3 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
provides all required configuration data needed to apply the procedures above,
i.e. no additional data or changes to existing data is required.
### 7.4.2 Solution evaluation
The solutions rely on the MCPTT server capability to correlate the functional
alias with the MCPTT ID, so that a functional alias can be used as target
address for calling other MCPTT clients. All procedures are derived from
existing procedures enhanced with functional alias specific handing similar as
done within Rel-15 group call procedures. Rel-15 user profile configuration
data is sufficient to perform verification checks and allows correlation
between functional aliases and MCPTT IDs. The MCPTT user data profile data is
enhanced with the list of functional alias(es) which can be called within
private calls.
## 7.5 Solution 5 -- Support of functional aliases in emergency and imminent
peril groups calls
### 7.5.1 Solution description
#### 7.5.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #8-1 described in subclause 5.8.1 on support
of functional aliases in emergency and imminent peril groups calls and key
issue #8-8 described in subclause 5.8-8 on limiting the number of parallel
emergency group calls as requested by 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-5.4.2-007a].
Emergency group calls are described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.6.2.6.1. Imminent peril group calls are described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
subclause 10.6.2.6.2. Group emergency alerts are described in 3GPP TS 23.379
[7] subclause 10.6.2.6.3.
#### 7.5.1.2 Emergency group calls using functional aliases
Figure 7.5.1.2-1 below illustrates the MCPTT emergency group call commencement
using functional aliases based on the MCPTT emergency group call commencement
procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.1.1:
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.1.1.
2\. Optionally, the MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may have
an activated functional alias to be used during the group communication.
NOTE 1: The selected functional alias is not changed during the group call,
i.e. a MCPTT client uses the same functional alias until the group call is
released or the MCPTT client has left the group call.
{width="5.316666666666666in" height="5.516666666666667in"}
Figure 7.5.1.2-1: MCPTT emergency group call using functional aliases
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency group call
request.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT group call request towards the MCPTT server.
The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency. The MCPTT server
checks whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has
been activated for the user.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates MCPTT client 1 to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized
for initiation of MCPTT emergency calls on the indicated MCPTT group, and if
authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status.
5\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
6\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members.
7\. MCPTT users are notified of the incoming MCPTT group call. The functional
alias of the group call initiating MC service user may be displayed.
8\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT emergency group call request. The
response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MC service
user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCPTT
server. In addition, a receiving MCPTT client check whether it is already
involved in an MCPTT emergency group call when using this functional alias and
whether the maximum number of parallel MCPTT emergency group calls when using
this functional alias has been reached. If so, an MCPTT client rejects the
MCPTT emergency group call request and does not participate in this MCPTT
emergency group call.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to inform the successful MCPTT emergency call establishment. The
response may contain the functional alias(es), which may be displayed.
NOTE 2: The clients use the same functional alias within floor control
procedures as used during group call setup.
For the following messages the functional alias of the calling or called party
must be added (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]):
\- 10.6.2.2.1 MCPTT emergency group call request
\- 10.6.2.2.1a MCPTT emergency group call response
\- 10.6.2.2.2 MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request
\- 10.6.2.2.2a MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel response
NOTE 3: Current MCPTT emergency group call response message (3GPP TS 23.379
[7] subclause 10.6.2.2.1a) shows the MCPTT ID of the calling party, but it
should be the called party. Other messages in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.6.2.2 need this correction too.
Same changes as above are needed for the MCPTT group call upgraded to an MCPTT
emergency group call procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.6.2.6.1.2, i.e. adding functional aliases to the MCPTT in-progress
emergency group state cancel request/response messages (subclause 10.6.2.2.2
and subclause 10.6.2.2.2a) and perform related authorisation checks in the
MCPTT server.
The MCPTT user profile configuration data in Annex A.3 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
is enhanced by the maximum number of parallel emergency group calls.

#### 7.5.1.3 MCPTT imminent peril group call using functional aliases
The MCPTT imminent peril group call is described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
subclause 10.6.2.6.2 and contain the MCPTT imminent peril group call
commencement procedure in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.2, the
imminent peril group call upgrade procedure in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.6.2.6.2.2 and the MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state cancel
procedure in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.2.3.
For the three procedures the same changes are required as described for the
emergency group call procedures, the differences between both sets of
procedures are independent from using functional aliases.
Same applies for the MCPTT user profile configuration data, which does not
require any modifications.
For the following messages the functional alias of the calling or called party
must be added (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]):
\- 10.6.2.2.5 MCPTT imminent peril group call request
\- 10.6.2.2.5a MCPTT imminent peril group call response
\- 10.6.2.2.6 MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state cancel request
\- 10.6.2.2.6a MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state cancel response
#### 7.5.1.4 MCPTT emergency alert
The MCPTT emergency alert is described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.6.2.6.3 and contain the MCPTT emergency alert initiation procedure in 3GPP
TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.3.1, the MCPTT emergency alert cancel
procedure in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.3.2 and the entering MCPTT
emergency alert area procedure in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.3.3.
Only the first two procedures are considered as the entering MCPTT emergency
alert area procedure is not fully specified. As for the procedures in the
previous sections, same changes allow using functional aliases also for the
MCPTT emergency alert.
Same applies for the MCPTT user profile configuration data, which does not
require any modifications.
For the following messages the functional alias of the alerting or cancelling
party must be added (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]):
\- 10.6.2.2.3 MCPTT emergency alert request
\- 10.6.2.2.3a MCPTT emergency alert response
\- 10.6.2.2.4 MCPTT emergency alert cancel request
\- 10.6.2.2.4a MCPTT emergency alert cancel response
NOTE: The decision on moving MCPTT emergency alert procedures to 3GPP TS
23.280 [8] is pending.
### 7.5.2 Solution evaluation
The solution supports to use of functional aliases within emergency and
imminent peril groups calls and MCPTT alerts. The principles are the same as
specified for pre-configured group calls and chat group calls. There are
several changes needed to existing messages. The MCPTT user profile data is
enhanced to control the maximum number of parallel emergency group calls.
Functional aliases are as useful for emergency group calls, imminent peril
group calls and MCPTT emergency (group) alerts as specified for non-emergency
group call models.
## 7.6 Solution 6 -- Support of functional aliases in temporary voice group
calls
### 7.6.1 Solution description
#### 7.6.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue #8-3 described in subclause 5.8.3 which
aims to support functional aliases within temporary voice group calls and for
procedures for regrouping of users.
The solution is based on the temporary user regroup using group creation
procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.210. The procedure
can be initiated by an authorized user creating a temporary group with a list
of MCPTT users and after that by initiating a group call.
#### 7.6.1.2 Temporary user regroup using group creation procedure
Figure 7.6.1.2-1 shows the temporary group call creation followed by a call
setup procedure, both initiated by an authorized user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The authorized user is aware of the functional aliases who will be invited
to the temporary group call.
2\. Optionally, the MCPTT UE 1, MCPTT UE 2 and MCPTT UE 3 have activated
functional aliases.
{width="6.520138888888889in" height="1.7805555555555554in"}
Figure 7.6.1.2-1: Temporary user regroup
1\. The authorized user of MCPTT UE 1 makes use of the group management client
of MCPTT UE 1 to create the temporary group according to the group creation
procedure in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.2.3. The group is created by a
list of functional aliases, instead of MC service IDs. For establishing the
group communication, the group management server queries the MCPTT server to
verify the status of the functional alias and to retrieve the corresponding
MCPTT ID.
2\. The user of MCPTT UE 1 initiates a group call according to existing
procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].
The temporary group call is ended by existing call release procedures
described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]. If the authorized user wishes to end the use
of the temporary group, the procedure for group deletion described in 3GPP TS
23.280 [8] is followed.
Editor\'s note: The solution requires that group management procedures,
described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.2, are enhanced to support
functional aliases.
Editor\'s note: The impacts of functional alias status changes, e.g. implicit
functional alias de-activation, needs further consideration.
### 7.6.2 Solution evaluation
The solution relies on group management and group call procedures, where both
are required to support functional aliases. The solution relies on the
capability of the group management server to verify the functional alias
activation status and to retrieve the corresponding MCPTT ID from the MCPTT
server for creating the group, which then enables the group communication.
## 7.7 Solution 7 -- Architecture to support GSM-R interworking
### 7.7.1 Solution description
#### 7.7.1.1 General
This solution addresses s set of key issues listed in subclause 5.16 and is
related to the architectural requirements described in subclause 6.1 on
interworking with GSM-R.
Stage 1 requirements on supporting GSM-R interworking are listed in 3GPP TS
22.280 [2] ([R-6.17.3.1-001]) and 3GPP TS 22.179 [3] ([R-6.18.4.2-001],
[R-6.18.4.2-002], [R-6.18.4.2-002a], [R-6.18.4.2-002b], [R-6.18.4.2-003],
[R-6.18.4.2-004], [R-6.18.4.2-005]).
Mission Critical Communication Interworking with Land Mobile Radio is
described in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] and the functional model is provided in
subclause 7.
The GSM-R and the MC system interworking needs to support:
\- Communication between GSM-R teleservices and on-network private/group
communications in the MC system;
\- A subset of supplementary services applicable to certain teleservices;
\- A mapping between GSM-R and MC service user identities;
\- Reaching a GSM-R user using the corresponding MCPTT ID;
\- Reaching a MCPTT user using the corresponding GSM-R user ID (MSISDN);
\- A mapping between GSM-R and MC service user identities and alternative
addressing schemes;
\- Reaching a GSM-R user using the corresponding functional alias activated by
the MC system;
\- Reaching an MC service user by a functional alias on the MC system or on
the GSM-R system;
\- A linkage between voice group communications of the GSM-R system and the MC
system applicable for group communications;
\- Independent authorisation of GSM-R users and MC service users;
\- Independent encryption of GSM-R user communication and MC service user
communication;
\- Bi-directional interworking of user related location information.
\- Bi-directional interworking between the MCData SDS and GSM-R SMS.
#### 7.7.1.2 Functional model for application plane interworking
Figure 7.7.1.2â€‘1 shows the functional model for the application plane for
interworking between MC systems and GSM-R systems.
Figure 7.7.1.2-1: Functional model for application plane for GSM-R
interworking
#### 7.7.1.3 Functional entities description
##### 7.7.1.3.1 IWFR
The IWFR supports necessary protocol translation and performs identity, group
and location mapping between the MC system and the GSM-R system. The internal
function of the IWFR is out of scope of the present document.
#### 7.7.1.4 Reference points
##### 7.7.1.4.1 IWFR-1
The IWFRâ€‘1 reference point, which exists between the IWFR and the MCPTT
server, provides peer to peer interconnection between a GSM-R system and the
MCPTT system. IWFRâ€‘1 is based on and may extend the functionality of IWF-1 as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11].
##### 7.7.1.4.2 IWFR-2
The IWFRâ€‘2 reference point, which exists between the IWFR and the MCData
server, provides SDS interconnection between a GSM-R system and the MCData
system. IWFRâ€‘2 is based on and may extend the functionality of IWF-2 as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11].
##### 7.7.1.4.3 IWFR-3
The IWFRâ€‘3 reference point, which exists between the IWFR and the group
management server, provides group management interconnection between a GSM-R
system and the MC service system. IWFRâ€‘3 is based on and may extend the
functionality of IWF-3 as defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11].
### 7.7.2 Solution evaluation
The solution describes an interworking architecture towards a GSM-R system
aligned with the existing Mission Critical Communication Interworking with
Land Mobile Radio as specified in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11].
The interworking architecture aims to be the basis for developing specific
solutions for those key issues listed in subclause 5.16. The overall target of
this solution is to hide specific GSM-R system aspects from an MC system which
needs to interwork with GSM-R.
Detailed analysis of requirements:
1\. Bi-directional protocol translation between the MCPTT system and the GSM-R
system.
\- 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] provides the necessary transactions for MCPTT services
and MCData services towards the IWF. The required protocol translation within
the IWF is out of scope in 3GPP. It is recommended that a regional
standardisation body e.g. ETSI provide the necessary framework.
2\. Mapping between the functional alias of the MCPTT user in the MCPTT system
and the functional address of the GSM-R user used in the GSM-R system.
\- 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] forms the basis for the interworking with LMR systems
(e.g. TETRA, P25). This specification requires extensions for supporting
interworking with the GSM-R system.
\- 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] subclause 8 defines the usage of different identities
for an LMR user (MCPTT ID / MCData ID) and an LMR group for voice and data
communication (MCPTT group ID, MCData group ID). 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] subclause
8 refers to 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 8 with regarding the identities, but
the specification does not provide any guidance on functional alias(es).
Identified gaps:
\- Missing reference/clarification in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 8 for the
use of functional alias.
\- Missing information in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] subclause 4 regarding the fact
that besides LMR GSM-R is also within the scope of this document.
\- Update of 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] subclause 5 that E2E encryption is not
possible with GSM-R.
\- Missing reference/clarification in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] subclause 8 for the
use of functional alias.
\- Update the corresponding messages in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] subclause 10.3 to
allow the use of functional alias.
\- Update the corresponding messages in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] subclause 10.4 to
allow the use of functional alias.
\- Update the corresponding messages in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] subclause 10.5 to
allow the use of functional alias.
\- Update the corresponding messages in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] subclause 10.6 to
allow the use of functional alias.
\- Update the corresponding messages in 3GPP TS 23.283 [11] subclause 10.8 to
allow the use of functional alias.
Editor\'s note: Further changes against the above Technical Specifications to
support functional alias interworking are for FFS.
> The following topics still require further study to complete this solution.
\- Further changes against the above Technical Specifications to reflect the
different capabilities of GSM-R and the MC service system are FFS. E.g. in
GSM-R no exact location of current talker is available. Is group call
reference (consisting of group call area and group ID) enough?
\- Further changes against the above Technical Specifications are expected to
consider the implications of the fact that no indication for floor control is
available from the GSM-R side. The proposed approach for a group call with
multi talker control (which is planned to be used for Railway group calls) is
to give the user representing the GSM-R side permanently the floor. Details on
how to do that are FFS.
\- Further changes against the above Technical Specifications to cover bi-
directional interworking between the MCData SDS and GSM-R SMS are FFS.
The mapping between functional alias and the identities in the GSM-R system
within the IWF is out of scope of 3GPP.
## 7.8 Solution 8 -- Solution to support functional alias via broadcast group
calls
### 7.8.1 Solution description
#### 7.8.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #9 described in subclause 5.9 to support the
functional alias via broadcast group calls.
Group calls using broadcast are described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.6.2.5.2. The common broadcast group call procedure is described in 3GPP TS
23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.5.2 and the group-broadcast group call procedure
is described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.5.2.1.
#### 7.8.1.2 Common broadcast group call procedure
Figure 7.8.1.2-1 illustrates the common procedure both for group-broadcast
group call and user-broadcast group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.5.2.
2\. Optionally, the MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 may have an activated
functional alias to be used during the group communication.
{width="4.6625in" height="2.3041666666666667in"}
Figure 7.8.1.2-1: Broadcast group call using functional aliases
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates the broadcast group call setup
procedure with the indication of broadcast group call. The signalling
procedure is identical to the group call setup as described in subclause
10.6.2 with the inclusion of the parameter for broadcast group call indicator.
The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias, if present, can
be used and has been activated for the user.
The functional alias is already available within the messages needed for the
above procedure since Rel-15, i.e. no message impacts.
7.8.1.3 Group-broadcast group call procedure using functional aliases
Figure 7.8.1.3-1 illustrates the procedure for the group-broadcast group call
establishment using functional aliases.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.5.2.1.
2\. Optionally, the MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may have
an activated functional alias to be used during the group communication.
NOTE 1: The selected functional alias is not changed during the group call,
i.e. a MCPTT client uses the same functional alias until the group call is
released or the MCPTT client has left the group call.
{width="5.0777777777777775in" height="5.455555555555556in"}
Figure 7.8.1.3-1: Group-broadcast group call using functional aliases
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 initiates the group-broadcast group call
setup procedure.
2\. The MCPTT client 3 sends a group-broadcast group call request to the MCPTT
server. The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias, if
present, can be used and has been activated for the user.
The steps 3 to 7 are identical as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.6.2.5.2.1.
8\. A group-broadcast group call request is sent to both the MCPTT client 1
and the MCPTT client 2. The request may contain the functional alias of the
calling party.
9\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 notify their users of the incoming
group-broadcast group call. The functional alias of the calling party, if
available, is presented to the users.
10\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 respond to the group-broadcast group
call request by sending a group-broadcast group call response. The response
may contain the functional alias of the target MCPTT group member
The procedure is continued as as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.6.2.5.2.1.
For the following messages the functional alias of the called party is
required (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]):
\- 10.6.2.2.26 Group-broadcast group call request (MCPTT client -- MCPTT
server)
\- 10.6.2.2.27 Group-broadcast group call request (MCPTT server -- MCPTT
client)
\- 10.6.2.2.28 Group-broadcast group call response (MCPTT client -- MCPTT
server)
\- 10.6.2.2.29 Group-broadcast group call response (MCPTT server -- MCPTT
client)
\- 10.6.2.2.30 Group-broadcast group call release request (MCPTT client \--
MCPTT server)
\- 10.6.2.2.31 Group-broadcast group call release request (MCPTT server \--
MCPTT client)
\- 10.6.2.2.32 Group-broadcast group call release response (MCPTT server \--
MCPTT client)
\- 10.6.2.2.33 Group-broadcast group call release response (MCPTT client \--
MCPTT server)
The functional alias is available within the above messages since Rel-15, i.e.
no need to enhance those messages.
### 7.8.2 Solution evaluation
The solution supports the use of functional aliases within broadcast group
calls. The principles are the same as for group calls without using broadcast,
i.e. the MCPTT server needs to verify whether the functional alias has been
activated and is allowed to be used. No changes are required to the messages
and within the configuration data.
## 7.9 Solution 9 -- Solution to support multiple functional alias use in
private calls
### 7.9.1 Solution description
#### 7.9.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #11 described in subclause 5.11 to support
multiple functional alias use.
A functional alias can be simultaneously used by more than one user, i.e. a
functional alias has been activated with more than one MCPTT client. The
subsequent subclauses describe how the multiple use of a functional alias is
handled within private calls.
#### 7.9.1.2 Private call setup procedure
Figure 7.9.1.2-1 shows a private call using manual commencement mode when
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 have activated the same functional alias.
The baseline for the procedure is the first-to-answer call as described in
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.15.3.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT clients 2 to n have activated the same functional alias.
Figure 7.9.1.2-1: Private call using with multiple functional alias use
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to establish a private call by
calling a functional alias.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call request containing the functional alias
(instead of the MCPTT ID) of the invited user. Because the client is using a
functional alias, it knows to use a first-to-answer call request.
3-4. The MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to make this call. The MCPTT server uses the functional alias (of
the called user) to identify the related MCPTT IDs of MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT
client n. To identify the MCPTT ID of the called users, the functional aliases
from the MCPTT clients 2 to MCPTT client n must have been activated.
> 5a, 5b, 5c. The MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using
> MCPTT service.
>
> 6a, 6b, 6c. The MCPTT users are alerted, regardless of the commencement
> mode.
7\. MCPTT user **at MCPTT client** 2 accepted the call which causes MCPTT
client 2 to send an MCPTT call response to the MCPTT server.
8\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT a call response to MCPTT client 1
indicating that MCPTT user **at MCPTT client** 2 has accepted the call.
9\. The media plane for communication is established.
10\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 has also accepted the call which causes
MCPTT client 3 to send an MCPTT call response to the MCPTT server.
11\. Since the MCPTT call response from MCPTT client 2 is already accepted,
the MCPTT server sends a MCPTT call cancel request to MCPTT client 3.
12-13. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 may be notified that the MCPTT call is
released with a reason for call release and MCPTT client 3 sends a MCPTT call
cancel response.
14\. MCPTT server sends a MCPTT call cancel request to all other MCPTT call
request receiving users from that call. This step may happen immediately after
Step 9.
15-16. MCPTT user at MCPTT client n may be notified that the MCPTT call is
cancelled with a reason for call cancel and MCPTT client n sends a MCPTT call
cancel response.
The first-to-answer call information flows in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.15.2 are still to be included, i.e. they must be specified, and the
functional alias needs to be added into those messages. The MCPTT user profile
configuration data in Annex A.3 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] provides all required
configuration data needed to apply the procedures above, i.e. no additional
data or changes to existing data is required.
### 7.9.2 Solution evaluation
The solution relies on the MCPTT server capability to correlate the functional
alias with all MCPTT IDs, so that a functional alias can be used as target
address for calling more than one MCPTT client, whereas the media plane is
only established between the calling MCPTT client and one of the called MCPTT
clients. The solution relies on an existing procedure describing a first-to-
answer call setup in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.15 and requires
specifying the information flows for that procedure.
NOTE: The implications of using a single functional alias by different
services are not considered.
## 7.10 Solution 10 -- Location information for a specific functional alias
### 7.10.1 Solution description
#### 7.10.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #14 described in subclause 5.14 to get the
location information of an MC service user using a specific functional alias.
The related stage 1 requirement are in 3GPP TS 22.280 ([R-6.12-006],
[R-5.9a-027]).
The following subclauses describe two different solution variants: subclause
7.10.1.2 uses one-time reporting method whereas subclause 7.10.1.3 relies on
periodic reporting to provide location information for a specific functional
alias.
#### 7.10.1.2 Client-triggered one-time location information request
Figure 7.10.1.2-1 shows the procedure when a client requests location
information from other clients by using a specific functional alias using one-
time location information reporting.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client 2 and MC service client 3 have activated the same
functional alias.
{width="4.9222222222222225in" height="2.5444444444444443in"}
Figure 7.10.1.2-1: Client-triggered one-time location information report
1\. Location management client 1 (authorized MC service user) sends a location
reporting trigger to the location management server to activate a location
reporting procedure for obtaining the location information for a specific
functional alias.
2\. Location management server checks whether location management client 1 is
authorized to send a location reporting trigger. To get the MC service user
IDs for triggering the location information from the location management
clients, the location management server uses the provided functional alias and
queries the MC service IDs from the MC service server.
3- Depending on the information specified by the location reporting trigger,
the location management server uses on-demand location reporting procedures
and initiates the immediately request location information from the location
management clients.
4\. MC service users may be notified about the location query.
5\. The location management clients immediately respond to the location
management server with a report containing location information identified by
the location management server and available to the location management
clients.
6\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management clients. If the location management
server does not have location information of a reporting location management
client before, then just stores the reporting location information for that
location management client.
7\. The location management server sends a location reporting response to
location management client 1 containing the provided location information from
location management client 2 and location management client 3. If only not all
location management clients immediately respond to the location management
server, i.e. others report some time later, subsequent location reporting
responses may be sent.
List of information flows in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8], which needs to add functional
alias related information elements:
\- Location reporting trigger (subclause 10.9.2.4)
List of new information to be added to 3GPP TS 23.280 [8]:
\- Location reporting response indicating different clients
Procedures to retrieve the functional alias status and the corresponding MC
service IDs are required between the location management server and the MC
service server.
No additional configuration data is required for this solution.
#### 7.10.1.3 Client triggered periodic location information reporting
Figure 7.10.1.3-1 shows the procedure when a client requests location
information from other clients identified by functional alias shared among MC
service users. The procedure relies on periodic location information
reporting.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Periodic location information reporting is configured using the event-
triggered location reporting procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] sub-
clause 10.9.3.1.
2\. MC service client 2 and MC service client 3 are sharing the same
functional alias which has been activated.
3\. The MC service server is the functional alias controlling server.
Figure 7.10.1.3-1: Client-trigged periodic location information reporting
1\. Location management client 1 sends a location reporting trigger to the
location management server encompassing the functional alias shared by MC
service client 2 and MC service client 3.
2\. The location management server verifies whether location management client
1 is authorized to send a location reporting trigger. The location management
server subscribes to the MC service server to get notifications from the MC
service server which provide the functional alias activation status and the
corresponding MC service IDs.
3\. The location management server decides to request location information
from the location management clients identified in the previous step.
4\. The location management server requests periodic location information from
the location management client 2 and location management client 3.
5\. MC service users associated with location management client 2 and location
management client may be notified about the periodic location information
reporting.
6\. Location management client 2 and location management client 3 send
periodic location information reports.
7\. The location management server updates the stored location information.
8\. Based on the received location information reports, the location
management server will periodically issue a location reporting response
encompassing the MC service IDs and the associated functional alias shared by
the MC service IDs and the individual positioning information of the addressed
MC service IDs.
NOTE 1: If a functional alias is deactivated for an MC service client, the
corresponding location management client stops sending periodic location
information.
NOTE 2: If a functional alias has been newly activated for an MC service
client, the location management server activates location information
reporting for the MC service client.
List of information flows in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8], which needs to add functional
alias related information elements:
\- Location reporting configuration (subclause 10.9.2.1)
\- Location information report (subclause 10.9.2.2)
\- Location reporting trigger (subclause 10.9.2.4)
List of new information to be added to 3GPP TS 23.280 [8]:
\- Location reporting response indicating different clients
Subscribe/notify procedures to retrieve the functional alias status and the
corresponding MC service IDs is required between the location management
server and the MC service server.
No additional configuration data is required for this solution.
7.10.2 Solution evaluation
Both solution variants allow an authorised MC service user to get the location
information of the MC service user(s) sharing the same functional alias. The
solution re-uses existing location management procedures and messages
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.9 as far as possible and requires
no configuration data modifications. The key for the first solution variant is
that the location management server queries the associated MCPTT IDs based on
a given functional alias from the MC service server to subsequently trigger an
immediate location information report from all clients sharing that functional
alias. The second solution variant requires that the location management
clients periodically report their location information together with the
functional alias to the location management server, so that the server has the
required information available when needed. Both solution variants require new
procedures between the location management server and the MC service server to
retrieve the functional alias status and the corresponding MC service IDs.
7.11 Solution 11 -- MC service server prevents de-affiliation when using a
specific functional alias(es)
7.11.1 Solution description
7.11.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #15 described in subclause 5.15 to prevent
de-affiliation when using a specific functional alias(es). The related stage 1
requirement are listed in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-6.4.4-003] and [R-6.4.4-004].
The solution relies on the MC service server capability to control de-
affiliation as guided (i.e. configured) by the common group configuration
data.
The following subclauses describe the solution when either the MC service user
is initiating de-affiliation or when the de-affiliation is initiated by the MC
service server. For the MC service server-initiated scenario existing
procedures are applied, i.e. there is no need to outline an additional
information flow. The described common group configuration data further down
below is applicable to both scenarios.
7.11.1.2 MC service server prevents from de-affiliation from a group
Figure 7.11.1.2-1 shows the procedure for revoking the affiliation with an MC
service group for a single MC service user having activated a certain
functional alias to be used within a certain group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.8.4.2.
2\. The MC service user of the MC service client has activated a functional
alias to be used within the group communication.

Figure 7.11.1.2-1: MC service prevents from group de-affiliation
1\. MC service client requests the MC service server to de-affiliate from an
MC service group or a set of MC service groups.
2\. Based on the user subscription and stored group policy, the MC service
server checks if the user of the MC service client is authorized to de-
affiliate from the requested MC service group(s). The authorisation check
includes if the MC service user has activated a certain functional alias(es)
which allows de-affiliation and whether the MC service user is the last user
using a certain functional alias, and if so, the user is not allowed to de-
affiliate.
3\. MC service server provides to the MC service client the group de-
affiliation response including the de-affiliation result.
#### 7.11.1.3 Group configuration data
Table 7.11.1.3-1 shows the additional common group configuration data needed
to prevent de-affiliation in conjunction with using functional alias(es).
Table 7.11.1.3-1: Common group configuration data
* * *
Reference Parameter description MC service UE MC service Server Group
management server [R-6.4.4-003] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [8] List of functional
aliases which are prevented from de-affiliation  
> Functional alias Y Y Y [R-6.4.4-004] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [8] List of
> functional aliases which are prevented de-affiliation, if used only once in
> the group  
> Functional alias N Y Y
* * *
The common group communication data above is applied to both, the MC service
group de-affiliation procedure (initiated by the MC service client) as
described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.8.4.2 and for the MC server-
initiated group de-affiliation procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8]
subclause 10.8.4.4.
### 7.11.2 Solution evaluation
The solution reuses the existing de-affiliation procedure described in in 3GPP
TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.8.4.2 and the MC service server\'s capability to
control de-affiliation and reject incoming requests when necessary. Additional
configuration data is needed for the MC service server to make the right
decisions, which is stored in common group configuration data. The solution
satisfies both, the case when the MC service user triggers de-affiliation as
well as when network internal reasons for de-affiliation occur.
## 7.12 Solution 12 -- List of functional aliases used by affiliated group
members
### 7.12.1 Solution description
#### 7.12.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #17 described in subclause 5.17 to get the
list of currently affiliated members of an MC service group including the
activated functional alias(es), if any (see 3GPP TS 22.280 [R-5.9a-029]).
The solution is following the procedure from 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause
10.1.5.6.2 (Procedure for subscription and notification for dynamic data
associated with a group). These procedures are between the MC service client
and the MC service server. The contents of the group dynamic data are defined
in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.1.5.5 and contains the affiliation status
of each MC service ID of the group.
#### 7.12.1.2 Procedure for subscription and notification of activated
functional aliases used associated with a group
The figure 7.12.1.2-1 showing the subscription procedure for providing the
dynamic data associated with an MC service group is copied from 3GPP TS 23.280
[8] subclause 10.1.5.6.2 and is used by the MC service client of an authorized
user (e.g. dispatcher) to obtain the dynamic data from the MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service server holds dynamic data associated with the MC service
group.
2\. The MC service server holds the information about activated functional
alias used with the MC service group.
3\. The MC service client is authorized to request the dynamic data associated
with the MC service group including information about activated functional
aliases.
{width="3.5409722222222224in" height="1.1625in"}
Figure 7.12.1.2-1: Subscription for group dynamic / activated aliases
information
> 1\. The MC service client subscribes to the group dynamic data stored in the
> MC service server using the subscribe group dynamic data request including
> an indication to receive information about activated functional aliases used

>
> 2\. The MC service server checks that the MC service client is authorized to
> receive dynamic data associated with the MC service group.
>
> 3\. The MC service server provides a subscribe group dynamic data response
> to the MC service client indicating success or failure of the request.
The figure 7.12.1.2-2 showing a procedure for notification of group dynamic
data is copied from 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.1.5.6.2 and is used by the
MC service server to inform the MC service client about new group dynamic data
including new information about functional alias used in the group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client has subscribed to the group dynamic data.
2\. The MC service server holds the information about activated functional
alias used with the MC service group.
3\. The MC service server has new group dynamic data including information on
activated functional alias available.
{width="3.535416666666667in" height="1.4229166666666666in"}
Figure 7.12.1.2-2: Notification of group dynamic data / activated functional
alias information
1\. The MC service server provides the notification to the MC service client,
who previously subscribed for the group dynamic data. The notification
contains information about activated functional aliases by affiliated members
used in the group.
2\. The MC service client provides a notify group dynamic data response to the
MC service server.
Two further enhancements are needed:
\- Add an indication to the Subscribe group dynamic data request message (3GPP
TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.1.5.6.1.1), that the MC service server also
provides the functional alias used in the group.
\- Enhance the \"Affiliation status of each MC service ID of the group
corresponding to the MC service and the Contact URI(s) from which the user
affiliated\" data set (3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.1.5.5) with additional
information about activated functional aliases.
The current configuration data controlling whether an MC service user has the
allowance to make the query can be reused, i.e. nothing in addition is needed
when querying used functional alias(es).
### 7.12.2 Solution evaluation
The solution allows an authorised MC service user to retrieve a list of
functional alias(es) used within a MC service group by the affiliated members.
The solution relies on existing procedures specified for subscription and
notification for dynamic data associated with a group described in 3GPP TS
23.280 [8] subclause 10.1.5.6.2. No configuration data modifications are
required.
## 7.13 Solution 13 -- List of MCPTT group members who did not acknowledge the
group call request
### 7.13.1 Solution description
#### 7.13.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #18 described in subclause 5.18 to provide a
list of those MCPTT group members to the initiator of the group communication
who did not acknowledge the group call request (see stage 1 requirement in
3GPP TS 22.179 [3] [R-6.2.1-010a]).
Two different group call models are described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], the pre-
arranged and the chat group call model. The stage 1 requirement above is only
useful for the pre-arranged group call model, where an initiator invites other
group members in adhoc fashion and expects them to join the MCPTT group call.
Within the chat group call model, the MCPTT user individually joins a group
call without being invited.
#### 7.13.1.2 Pre-arranged group call setup
Figure 7.13.1.2-1 shows that MCPTT client 1 is initiating an MCPTT group call
with the affiliated MCPTT members of that group (MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3). MCPTT client 2 acknowledges the group call request, whereas MCPTT
client 3 does not acknowledge the group call request. The acknowledgement can
be generated by the client either automatically, or due to manual action by
the MC service user.
The procedure is based on 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.3.1.1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.3.1.1.2.
{width="4.4944444444444445in" height="3.9930555555555554in"}
Figure 7.13.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup -- MCPTT client 3 does not
acknowledge the request
1\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT group call with a
selected group (identified by MCPTT group ID).
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCPTT server.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized to
initiate a group call for the selected group.
4\. MCPTT server sends the group call request towards the MCPTT clients of
each of those affiliated group members. MCPTT users are notified about the
incoming group call.
5\. MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 reply with a group call response back to
the group host MCPTT server. MCPTT client 2 acknowledges the group call
request, whereas MCPTT client 3 does not acknowledge the group call request.
6\. MCPTT server sends a group call response to the MCPTT client 1.
7\. If the initiating MCPTT user requires acknowledgement from affiliated
MCPTT group members, and the required MCPTT group members do not acknowledge
the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup
timeout\"), then the MCPTT server may proceed with, or abandon, the call. In
either case it provides a notification to the initiating MCPTT user of all
members (i.e. MCPTT client 3) who did not acknowledge the group call request
within the configured time according to group policy. If the MCPTT server
proceeds with the call, then this notification may be sent to the initiating
MCPTT user by the MCPTT server more than once during the call as MCPTT users
join or leave the MCPTT group call.
8\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 have established media
plane for communication.
No changes to existing configuration data is requested, but the MCPTT server
needs to be configured whether the group call notify message sent to the
initiating MCPTT client provides a list of all members who did not acknowledge
the group call request.
### 7.13.2 Solution evaluation
The solution suggests modifications to the pre-arranged group call setup
procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.3.1.1. Mainly an
additional IE (optional) is added to the group call notify message sent from
the group hosting MCPTT server back to the group call initiating MCPTT client.
Configuration data modifications are not needed.
## 7.14 Solution 14 -- MC service server limits the number of simultaneous
successful service authorisations
### 7.14.1 Solution description
#### 7.14.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #19 described in subclause 5.19 to limit the
number of simultaneous successful user service authorizations (related
requirement is in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-5.10-001a]).
The following subclauses highlights the solution principles, which mostly
relies on the existing standard.
#### 7.14.1.2 Using the client ID provided during user service authorisation
The solution relies on the client ID provided by the MC service client during
the user service authorisation procedure (e.g. see 3GPP TS 24.379 [19]
subclause 7.2 (client side) and subclause 7.3 (server side) for further
details). Once the MC service server has knowledge of the client ID, it can
identify different clients used by the same MC service user. The client ID is
service specific, i.e. there exist separate client IDs for MCPTT, MCData and
MCVideo. Both user service authorisation methods support client ID delivery
from the client to the server (i.e. SIP REGISTER and SIP PUBLISH). The user
service authorisation procedures for MCVideo are described in 3GPP TS 24.281
[20] subclause 7 and for MCData in 3GPP TS 24.282 [21] subclause 7.
The use of a SIP PUBLISH message to provide the client ID to the MC service
server is shown in figure 7.14.1.2-1.
{width="5.1090277777777775in" height="1.492361111111111in"}
Figure 7.14.1.2-1: MC user service authorization using SIP PUBLISH message
As shown in step 1 of figure 7.14.1.2-1, the SIP PUBLISH message carries the
client ID token through the SIP core to the MC service server. In steps 1 and
2, the MC service server receives the SIP PUBLISH message, validates the
access token, binds the IMPU and MC service ID (MCPTT ID, MCVideo ID or MCData
ID), if the access token is valid, and responds to the SIP PUBLISH message.
Further and in addition, if the client ID check allows to register (another)
MC service client for this IMPU/MC service user, it sends a positive response
to the MC service client (step 3).
#### 7.14.1.3 Service configuration data
Table 7.14.1.3-1 shows the additional MCPTT service configuration data needed
to control the maximum number of successful simultaneous service
authorizations of clients per MC service user.
Table 7.14.1.3-1: MCPTT service configuration data (on network)
* * *
Reference Parameter description MCPTT UE MCPTT Server Configuration management
server [R-5.10-001a] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] Maximum number of successful
simultaneous service authorizations of clients from a MC service user N Y Y
* * *
Same changes are required for MCVideo in 3GPP TS 23.281 subclause A.5 and for
MCData in 3GPP TS 23.282 subclause A.5.
### 7.14.2 Solution evaluation
The solution relies on the MC service client capability to provide the client
ID to the MC service server during the user service authentication procedure.
Having the client ID available, the MC service server can limit the number of
clients as configured by additional (i.e. new) parameters in the configuration
data.
NOTE 1: The procedure shown in this solution is not to be added to 3GPP TS
23.280 [8], but some statement is needed to indicate that the MC service
server controls the number of successful simultaneous authentications for
clients used by an MC service user.
NOTE 2: The working assumption of this solution is that in one MC UE only one
MC service client is used per MC service type.
## 7.15 Solution 15 -- Support functional aliases for SDS
### 7.15.1 Solution description
#### 7.15.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue #12-1 described in subclause 5.12.1
which aims to support functional aliases when applying the short data service
(SDS).
The solution addresses the one-to-one short data service (SDS) described in
3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2, subclause 7.4.3 and subclause 7.4.4 and
the group short data service (SDS) described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause
7.4.5, subclause 7.4.6 and subclause 7.4.7. The related messages for both
features are in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.1 and the required changes
for allowing to use functional aliases are addressed. Finally, the solution
addresses the required changes within the configuration data.
#### 7.15.1.2 One-to-one short data service (SDS)
The procedure in figure 7.15.1.2-1 shows an MCData user initiating a
standalone SDS data transfer with another MCData user by using the signalling
plane.
NOTE: Scenarios when multiple users share the same functional alias are not
considered.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.2.2.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 may have an activated
functional alias to be used.
{width="5.5256944444444445in" height="3.1125in"}
Figure 7.15.1.2-1: One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling
control plane
1\. The user at MCData client 1 initiates an SDS data transfer for the chosen
MCData user by using a functional alias.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData standalone data request towards the MCData
server. The MCData standalone data request contains the functional alias
(instead of the MCData ID) of the receiving user and, optionally, a functional
alias of the sending user.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData standalone data request and whether the provided
functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.
The MCData server uses the functional alias of the receiving user to identify
the related MCData ID of MCData client 2 and checks if it is authorized to
receive the SDS data transfer. To identify the MCData ID of the receiving
user, the functional alias must have been activated.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData standalone data request towards the
MCData user, including the MCData ID and the functional alias of the sending
MCData user 1 and the receiving MCData user 2.
5\. The MCData user of MCData client 2 may be notified and the functional
alias of the sending MCData user is displayed to the receiving MCData user.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report.
7\. MCData data disposition notification is sent to the disposition requesting
user at MCData client 1.
8\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report.
9\. MCData data disposition notification is sent to the disposition requesting
user at MCData client 1.
For the following messages the functional alias must be added (see 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.1):
\- 7.4.2.1.1 MCData standalone data request
\- 7.4.2.1.2 MCData data disposition notification
Similar changes are required when applying the one-to-one standalone short
data service using media plane procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10]
subclause 7.4.2.3 and when applying the one-to-one short data service session
procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.4.
In addition, the following messages require that the functional alias must be
added (see 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.1):
\- 7.4.2.1.3 MCData standalone session data request
\- 7.4.2.1.4 MCData standalone session data response
\- 7.4.2.1.5 MCData session data request
\- 7.4.2.1.6 MCData session data response
7.15.1.3 Group short data service (SDS)
The initiation of a group SDS to a selected group results in affiliated group
members receiving the SDS data. The procedure in figure 7.15.1.3-1 describes
the case where an MCData user is initiating group standalone MCData data
communication to a group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.5.2.
2\. Optionally, the MCData clients 1 to n may have activated functional
aliases to be used.
{width="4.14375in" height="3.4118055555555555in"}
Figure 7.15.1.3-1: Group standalone SDS using signalling control plane
1\. The user at MCData client 1 initiates an SDS data transfer to multiple
MCData users selecting a pre-configured group. The MCData user may select a
functional alias, which is displayed to other users in the group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData group standalone data request towards the
MCData server. The MCData group data request contains the functional alias of
MCData client 1.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData group standalone data request and whether the
provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the
user.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone data request towards
each MCData client determined in step 3 and provides the functional alias of
the sending user.
5\. The functional alias may be displayed to the receiving MCData user.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client(s) initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report. The response contains the
functional alias of the responding MCData user, which is verified (activated
for the user) by the MCData server.
7\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report. The response contains the functional alias of the responding MCData
user, which is verified (activated for the user) by the MCData server.
8\. The MCData data disposition notification(s) from MCData client may be
stored by the MCData server for disposition history interrogation from
authorized MCData users. The MCData data disposition notification(s) from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
9\. Aggregated or individual MCData data disposition notification(s) is sent
to the disposition requesting user at MCData client 1. The response contains
the functional alias(es) of the responding MCData user(s).
For the following messages the functional alias must be added (see 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.1):
\- 7.4.2.1.7 MCData group standalone data request (MCData client -- MCData
server)
\- 7.4.2.1.8 MCData group standalone data request (MCData server -- MCData
client)
\- 7.4.2.1.2 MCData data disposition notification
\- 7.4.2.1.9 MCData data disposition notification(s) (MCData server -- MCData
client)
Similar changes are required when applying the group standalone short data
service using media plane procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause
7.4.2.6 and when applying the group short data service session procedure
described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.7.
In addition, the following messages require that the functional alias must be
added (see 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.1):
\- 7.4.2.1.10 MCData group session standalone data request (MCData client --
MCData server)
\- 7.4.2.1.11 MCData group session standalone data request (MCData server --

### 7.15.2 Solution evaluation
The solution supports the use of functional aliases within all short data
service (SDS) procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4. The
solution relies on the principles which were specified in Rel-15 for group
calls or are suggested for other solutions like private calls. Basically, the
MCData server checks whether a functional alias can be used by an MCData user
within a SDS communication. The solution lists those messages, which must be
extended to transfer functional aliases and details the changes required
within the configuration data.
## 7.16 Solution 16 -- Support functional aliases for File distribution (FD)
### 7.16.1 Solution description
#### 7.16.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue #12-2 described in subclause 5.12.2
which aims to support functional aliases for File distribution (FD).
File distribution procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.5
can be grouped into procedures for uploading/downloading of files to/from a
content server described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.5.2.2 and
subclause 7.5.2.3, into procedures for one-to-one file distribution described
in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.5.2.4 and subclause 7.5.2.5 and into
procedures for group file distribution described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10]
subclause 7.5.2.6 and subclause 7.5.2.7.
The solution addresses one-to-one and group file distribution procedures only
as the use of functional aliases is to allow users to know the role of
communication partners. When uploading/downloading files from a content
server, the role of a user is irrelevant as not seen by another user. For
applying access control, the MCData ID can be used.
#### 7.16.1.2 One-to-one file distribution using HTTP
The procedure in figure 7.16.1.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating one-to-one data communication for sending file to another MCData
user.
NOTE: Scenarios when multiple users share the same functional alias are not
considered.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.5.2.4.2.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 may have an activated
functional alias to be used.
{width="5.811805555555556in" height="3.04375in"}
Figure 7.16.1.2-1: One-to-one file distribution using HTTP
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
the chosen MCData user by using a functional alias.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends a MCData FD request towards the MCData server.
The MCData FD request contains the functional alias (instead of the MCData ID)
of the receiving user and, optionally, a functional alias of the sending user.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData FD request and whether the provided functional
alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user. The MCData
server uses the functional alias of the receiving user to identify the related
MCData ID of MCData client 2 and checks if it is authorized to receive the
MCData FD request. To identify the MCData ID of the receiving user, the
functional alias must have been activated.
4\. The MCData server applies transmission and reception control.
5\. MCData server initiates the MCData FD request towards the MCData user,
including the MCData ID and the functional alias of MCData user 1 and MCData
user 2.
6\. The receiving MCData client 2 notifies the user about the incoming MCData
FD request and the functional alias of the requesting MCData user is
displayed.
7\. MCData user 2 may provide a response (accept or reject) or not (ignore) to
the notification, then MCData client 2 sends the MCData FD response to the
MCData server, including the functional alias.
8\. After checking the functional alias, the MCData server forwards the MCData
FD response to the MCData client 1.
9\. MCData client 2 downloads the file.
10\. MCData client 2 initiates a MCData download completed report for
reporting file download completed. The report contains the functional alias
used by MCData client 2.
11\. The MCData file download completed report is sent to the user at MCData
client 1.
For the following messages the functional alias must be added (see 3GPP TS

\- 7.5.2.1.5 MCData FD request (using HTTP)
\- 7.5.2.1.6 MCData FD response (using HTTP)
\- 7.5.2.1.7 MCData download completed report
Similar changes are required when applying the one-to-one file distribution
using media plane procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause
7.5.2.5.
In addition, the following messages require that the functional alias must be
added (see 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.5.2.1):
\- 7.5.2.1.8 MCData FD request (using media plane)
\- 7.5.2.1.9 MCData FD response (using media plane)
#### 7.16.1.3 Group standalone file distribution using HTTP
The procedure in figure 7.16.1.3-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating group standalone data communication for sending file to multiple
MCData users within a group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.5.2.6.2.
2\. Optionally, the MCData clients 1 to n may have activated functional
aliases to be used.
{width="4.397222222222222in" height="3.661111111111111in"}
Figure 7.16.1.3-1: Group standalone FD using HTTP
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
multiple MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified by MCData
group ID). The MCData user selects a functional alias, which may be displayed
to other users in the group.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends a MCData group standalone FD request towards the
MCData server. The MCData group standalone FD request contains the functional
alias of MCData client 1.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData group standalone FD request and resolves the MCData
group ID to determine the members of that group and their affiliation status,
based on the information from the group management server. The MCData server
checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has
been activated for the user.
4\. The MCData server also applies transmission and reception control.
5\. MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone FD request towards
each MCData user determined in step 3 and provides the functional alias of the
sending user.
6\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n notify the user about the incoming
MCData group standalone FD request and displays the functional alias.
7\. MCData user on MCData clients 2 to n provides a response to the
notification and the respective MCData client sends the MCData group
standalone FD response to the MCData server, which contains the functional
alias of the responding MCData user. The functional alias is verified (valid
and activated for the user) by the MCData server.
8\. The MCData server forwards the MCData group standalone FD response to the
MCData client 1. The response contains the functional alias(es) of the
responding MCData user(s).
9\. MCData client(s) downloads the file and notifies the MCData user.
10\. The MCData client(s), successfully receiving the file, initiate a MCData
download completed report for reporting file download completed, if requested
by the user at MCData client 1. The report contains the functional alias(es)
of the responding MCData user(s).
11\. The MCData file download completed report from each MCData user may be
aggregated.
12\. Aggregated or individual MCData download completed report is sent by the
MCData server to the user at MCData client 1. The report contains the
functional alias(es) of the responding MCData user(s).
For the following messages the functional alias must be added (see 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.5.2.1):
\- 7.5.2.1.10 MCData group standalone FD request (using HTTP)
\- 7.5.2.1.11 MCData group standalone FD response (using HTTP)
\- 7.5.2.1.7 MCData download completed report
Similar changes are required when applying the group standalone group
standalone file distribution using media plane procedure described in 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.5.2.7.
In addition, the following messages require that the functional alias must be
added (see 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.1):
\- 7.5.2.1.12 MCData group standalone FD request (using media plane)
\- 7.5.2.1.13 MCData group standalone FD response (using media plane)
\- 7.5.2.1.7 MCData download completed report
### 7.16.2 Solution evaluation
The solution supports the use of functional aliases within one-to-one and
group file distribution procedures. The solution relies on the principles
which were specified in Rel-15 for group calls or are suggested for other
solutions like private calls, i.e. the MCData server checks whether a
functional alias can be used by an MCData user for file distribution. The
solution lists all messages, which must be extended to provide the functional
aliases.
## 7.17 Solution 17 -- Support functional aliases within MCData control
procedures
### 7.17.1 Solution description
#### 7.17.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue #12-3 described in subclause 5.12.3
which aims to find solutions using a functional alias within MCData control
functions as specified to apply transmission and reception control described
in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.6 and control and conversation release
procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.7.
The transmission and reception control procedures consist of a procedure which
allows automatic transmission for SDS in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause
7.6.2.2, a procedure to send data with mandatory download in 3GPP TS 23.282
[10] subclause 7.6.2.3, a procedure to send data without mandatory download in
3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.6.2.4, for which the use functional alias is
useful.
For another procedure which allows accessing a list of deferred data group
communications in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.6.2.5, the use of functional
alias is not required as the functional alias of the user is irrelevant.
The control and conversation release procedures consist of procedures which
allows an MCData user-initiated communication release in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10]
subclause 7.7.2.2 for which the use functional alias is useful.
For other procedures in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] the use of functional alias is not
required as the role of the user and so the functional alias is irrelevant:
\- subclause 7.7.2.3 MCData server-initiated communication release without
prior indication
\- subclause 7.7.2.4 MCData server-initiated communication release with prior
indication
\- subclause 7.7.2.5 MCData server-initiated communication release without
prior indication
\- subclause 7.7.2.6 Authorized MCData user-initiated communication release
without prior indication
NOTE: Scenarios when multiple users share the same functional alias are not
considered.
#### 7.17.1.2 Transmission and reception control procedures
As indicated above the transmission and reception control procedures consist
of a set of different procedures. For simplicity the use of functional aliases
within the procedure allowing automatic transmission for SDS in 3GPP TS 23.282
[10] subclause 7.6.2.2 is further detailed, for all other procedures similar
changes are required.
The procedure in figure 7.17.1.2-1 describes the case where MC Data SDS is
automatically transmitted to the selected recipient user or affiliated members
of the selected MCData group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.6.2.2.2.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 may have an activated
functional alias to be used.
{width="5.271527777777778in" height="2.095138888888889in"}
Figure 7.17.1.2-1: Automatic transmission for SDS
1\. MCData user selects the data to transmit and the recipient MCData user (by
using a functional alias) or MCData group.
2\. MCData server checks for MCData user\'s permission to transmit data. The
MCData transmission to MCData server request contains the functional alias
(instead of the MCData ID) of the receiving user (if not a group) and,
optionally, a functional alias of the transmitting user.
3\. Transmission control on the server verifies if the MCData user is
authorized to transmit and whether the provided functional alias can be used
and has been activated for the user. The MCData server uses the functional
alias of the receiving user to identify the related MCData ID of MCData client
2. To identify the MCData ID of the receiving user(s), the related functional
alias must have been activated.
4\. MCData server may send MCData control indications:
5\. MCData server automatically transmits the data to the selected MCData user
or the affiliated members of the selected MCData group.
None of the messages in the flow require any update to support functional
aliases.
Similar changes are required when using functional alias within the procedure
on sending data with mandatory download (see 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause
7.6.2.3) and the procedure to send data without mandatory download (see 3GPP
TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.6.2.4).
#### 7.17.1.3 Control and conversation release procedures
As outlined above the Control and conversation release procedures consist of a
set of different procedures. For simplicity the use of functional aliases
within the procedure on release of MCData communication using media plane in
3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.7.2.2.2 is further detailed, for the other
procedure similar changes are required.
The procedure in figure 7.17.1.3-1 describes signalling control plane
procedure for the case where MCData communication is ongoing and transmitting
participant initiates MCData communication release. The procedure is
applicable for one-to-one and group MCData communications.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.7.2.2.2.2.
2\. Optionally, the MCData clients 1 to n may have activated functional
aliases to be used.
{width="5.106944444444444in" height="3.4868055555555557in"}
Figure 7.17.1.3-1: Release of MCData communication using media plane
1\. MCData user at MCData client 1 requests to release ongoing MCData
communication.
2\. MCData client 1 sends MCData communication release request towards MCData
server, for tearing down the communication with the other MCData client(s).
The request contains the functional alias of MC client 1 and the other MCData
client(s). The MCData server checks whether the provided functional alias(es)
are allowed to be used and have been activated for the user(s). The MCData
server is able to correlate MCData IDs with functional alias(es).
3\. MCData server sends MCData communication release request to all the
participants of the MCData communication.
4\. Recipient MCData clients notifies respective MCData user about the release
of MCData communication.
5\. MCData clients receiving the MCData communication release request provide
communication release response back towards MCData server.
6\. MCData server sends MCData communication release response back to MCData
client 1.
7\. All participants of the MCData communication have successfully released
the media plane resources associated with the MCData communication that is
released.
8\. MCData client 1 notifies the MCData user about the communication release.
For the following messages the functional alias must be added (see 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.7.2.1):
\- 7.7.2.1.8 MCData server communication release request (one-to-one
communication using media plane)
\- 7.7.2.1.9 MCData server communication release response (one-to-one
communication using media plane)
\- 7.7.2.1.10 MCData server communication release request (group communication
using media plane)
\- 7.7.2.1.11 MCData server communication release response (group
communication using media plane)
Similar changes are required when applying the release of MCData communication
using HTTP procedure in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.7.2.2.3.
### 7.17.2 Solution evaluation
The solution supports the use of functional aliases within a set of so-called
MCData control functional procedures. The solution relies on the principles
which were specified in Rel-15 for group calls or are suggested for other
solutions like private calls, i.e. the MCData server checks whether a
functional alias can be used by an MCData user and performs correlation
between functional aliases and MCData IDs. The solution describes
modifications to existing messages.
## 7.18 Solution 18 -- Support of functional aliases for video emergency group
calls
### 7.18.1 Solution description
#### 7.18.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue #13-2 described in subclause 5.13.2
which aims to support functional aliases for video emergency group calls.
Three different kinds of emergency group calls solutions for using functional
aliases are provided: a solution for emergency video group calls derived from
3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.1.2.5.1, a second solution for imminent peril
video group calls derived from 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.1.2.5.2 and a
third solution for group emergency video alerts derived from 3GPP TS 23.281
[9] subclause 7.1.2.6. Also, the required configuration data is addressed.
#### 7.18.1.2 Emergency video group calls
The procedure in figure 7.18.1.2-1 describes the case where an MCVideo client
is initiating an MCVideo emergency group call with the affiliated MCVideo
group members of that MCVideo group and functional aliases are used.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.1.2.5.1.1.
2\. MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 have an activated
functional alias to be used during the emergency group communication.
{width="5.1097222222222225in" height="4.658333333333333in"}
Figure 7.18.1.2-1: MCVideo emergency group call
1\. The user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency group
call. MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo group call request towards the MCVideo
server. If the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 has selected a functional
alias, then the group call request contains that functional alias.
3\. The MCVideo server implicitly affiliates MCVideo client 1 to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 is
authorized for initiation of MCVideo emergency calls on the indicated on the
indicated MCVideo group, and if authorized, it resolves the MCVideo group ID
to determine the members of that MCVideo group and their affiliation status,
based on the information from group management server. The MCVideo server
checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has
been activated for the MCVideo user.
5\. The MCVideo server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for
all participants in the MCVideo group.
6\. MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call request towards the
MCVideo clients of each of those affiliated MCVideo group members.
7\. MCVideo users are notified of the incoming MCVideo group call and the
functional alias of the initiating user is displayed.
8\. The receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo emergency group call
response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the MCVideo emergency group call
request. The response may contain the functional alias of the responding MC
service user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the
MCVideo server.
9\. The MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call response to the
MCVideo user 1, which may contain the functional aliases of the responding
MCVideo clients.
Similar changes are required when applying MCVideo group call upgraded to an
MCVideo emergency group call procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10]
subclause 7.1.2.5.1.2, the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel
procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.1.2.5.1.3 and the
various MCVideo imminent peril group call procedures described in 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.1.2.5.2.
For the following messages the functional alias must be added (see 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.1.2.2):
\- 7.1.2.2.18 MCVideo emergency group call request
\- 7.1.2.2.19 MCVideo emergency group call response
\- 7.1.2.2.20 MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel request
\- 7.1.2.2.21 MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel response
\- 7.1.2.2.22 MCVideo imminent peril group call request
\- 7.1.2.2.23 MCVideo imminent peril group call response
\- 7.1.2.2.24 MCVideo imminent peril group call cancel request
\- 7.1.2.2.25 MCVideo imminent peril group call cancel response
#### 7.18.1.3 Group emergency video alerts
The procedure in figure 7.18.1.3-1 describes the procedure for the MCVideo
client initiating an MCVideo emergency alert with an MCVideo group, i.e.,
MCVideo users on MC service client 1, MC service client 2 and MC service
client 3 belong to the same MC service group which is defined on group
management server. For the MCVideo group emergency alert functional aliases
are used.
NOTE: The procedure described here after is generic, i.e. it is also
applicable for MCData emergency group alerts.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.10.1.2.1.
2\. MC service clients 1 to 3 may have activated functional aliases to be used
to be used for the group emergency video alert.
{width="5.315972222222222in" height="4.344444444444444in"}
Figure 7.18.1.3-1: MC service emergency alert
1\. The user at the MC service client 1 initiates an MC service emergency
alert. MC service client 1 sets its MC service emergency state.
2\. MC service client 1 requests the MC service server to send an MC service
emergency alert request to the MC service group designated as the MC service
emergency group. The request contains the functional alias selected by the MC
service user.
3\. MC service server checks whether the MC service user of MC service client
1 is authorized for initiation of MC service emergency alerts for the
indicated MC service group. The MC service server checks whether the provided
functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the MC
service user.
4\. MC service server resolves the MC service group ID to determine the
members of that MC service group and their affiliation status, based on the
information from group management server.
5\. The MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert response to the
MC service user 1 to confirm the MC service emergency alert request.
6\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert request towards
the MC service clients of each of those affiliated MC service group members
containing the functional alias of the MC service client 1.
7\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency. The functional
alias of the MCVideo clients are displayed where appropriate.
8\. The receiving MC service clients send the MC service emergency alert
response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency
alert.
9\. The MC service server implicitly affiliates the client to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
For the following messages the functional alias must be added for MCVideo
emergency group alerts (see 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.5.2.2):
\- 7.1.2.2.14 MCVideo emergency alert request
\- 7.1.2.2.15 MCVideo emergency alert response
\- 7.1.2.2.16 MCVideo emergency alert cancel request
\- 7.1.2.2.17 MCVideo emergency alert cancel response
### 7.18.2 Solution evaluation
The solution supports the use of functional aliases within emergency video
group calls and emergency video group alerts. The solution relies on the
principles which were specified in Rel-15 for group calls, i.e. the MCVideo
server checks whether a functional alias can be used by an MCVideo user within
the group call. The solution lists all those messages which must be extended
to provide the functional aliases.
## 7.19 Solution 19 -- Support of functional aliases in private calls and
private emergency calls
### 7.19.1 Solution description
#### 7.19.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #8-2 described in subclause 5.8.3 on support
of functional aliases private calls and private emergency calls.
#### 7.19.1.2 Private calls using functional aliases
Figure 7.19.1.2-1 below illustrates the private call setup procedure
(automatic commencement mode) based on the private call setup in automatic
commencement mode in described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.2.2.1:
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.2.2.1.
2\. Optionally, the MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 may have an activated
functional alias to be used.
{width="5.620138888888889in" height="4.073611111111111in"}
Figure 7.19.1.2-1: Private call setup using functional aliases
1\. MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCPTT service.
2\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call to the
chosen MCPTT user by using a functional alias.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server (call controlling). The MCPTT private call request contains the
functional alias (instead of the MCPTT ID) of invited user and, optionally, a
functional alias of the calling user.
4\. MCPTT server (call controlling) checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT
client 1 is authorized to initiate the private call and whether the provided
functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.
5\. MCPTT server (call controlling) may provide a progress indication to MCPTT
client 1 to indicate progress in the call setup process.
6\. MCPTT server (call controlling) forwards the MCPTT private call request to
the MCPTT server (FA controlling).
7\. MCPTT server (FA controlling) determines related MCPTT ID of MCPTT client
2 who has activated the functional alias. To identify the MCPTT ID of the
called user, the functional alias must have been activated
8\. MCPTT server (FA controlling) sends the MCPTT private call request towards
the MCPTT client 2, including the MCPTT IDs and the functional aliases of the
calling MCPTT user 1 and the called MCPTT user 2.
9\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private
call and displays the functional alias of calling MCPTT user 1.
10\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an MCPTT private call response is sent to the MCPTT server (FA controlling).
11\. MCPTT server (FA controlling) forwards the MCPTT private call response to
MCPTT server (call controlling).
12\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, the MCPTT server (call controlling)
informs the MCPTT client 1 about successful call establishment.
13\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 have successfully established media
plane for communication and either user can transmit media.
NOTE: The clients use the same functional alias within floor control
procedures as used during private call setup.
For the following messages the functional alias of the calling party and the
called party must be added (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]):
\- 10.7.2.1.1 MCPTT private call request (MCPTT client to MCPTT server)
\- 10.7.2.1.2 MCPTT private call request (MCPTT server to MCPTT server for
several MCPTT systems)
\- 10.7.2.1.2a MCPTT private call request (MCPTT server to MCPTT client)
Similar changes as above are needed for the private call release procedures
described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.2.2.3, i.e. adding functional
aliases to the private call end request message (subclause 10.7.2.1.4a) and
the private call end response message (subclause 10.7.2.1.4b) and perform
related authorisation checks in the MCPTT server.
The MCPTT user profile configuration data in Annex A.3 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
provides all required configuration data needed to apply the procedures above,
i.e. no additional data or changes to existing data is required.
#### 7.19.1.3 MCPTT private emergency calls using functional aliases
Figure 7.19.1.3-1 below illustrates when the MCPTT client initiating
establishment of an MCPTT emergency private call based on the MCPTT emergency
private call commencement procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.7.2.4.1:
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.2.4.1.
2\. Optionally, the MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 may have an activated
functional alias to be used.
{width="5.813194444444444in" height="4.5472222222222225in"}
Figure 7.19.1.3-1 MCPTT emergency private call using functional aliases
1\. The user of MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency private call by
using the functional alias of the user of MCPTT client 2.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency private call request towards the
MCPTT server (call controlling). The request contains an indication of the
MCPTT emergency and the functional alias of MCPTT client 2. The request may
also contain the functional alias of calling MCPTT client 1. The MCPTT server
checks whether the functional alias of MCPTT client 1, if present, can be used
and has been activated for the user.
3\. MCPTT server (call controlling) forwards the MCPTT emergency private call
request towards MCPTT server (FA controlling) of the functional alias of the
user of MCPTT client 2.
4\. The MCPTT server (FA controlling) uses the functional alias of the called
user to identify the related MCPTT ID of MCPTT client 2. To identify the MCPTT
ID of the called user, the functional alias must have been activated. MCPTT
server (FA controlling) sends the MCPTT emergency private call request towards
the target MCPTT client. The request contains an indication of an MCPTT
emergency alert if the request from the originator indicated MCPTT emergency
alert.
5\. The MCPTT user on MCPTT client 2 is notified of the incoming MCPTT
emergency private call and, if present, the functional alias of the calling
MCPTT user 1 is displayed.
6\. The MCPTT emergency private call response is returned to MCPTT server (FA
controlling).
7\. MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT emergency private call response to MCPTT
server (call controlling).
The procedure is continued as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
10.7.2.4.1.
For the following messages the functional alias of the calling party and the
called party must be added (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]):
\- 10.7.2.1.5 MCPTT emergency private call request (MCPTT client to MCPTT
server)
\- 10.7.2.1.5a MCPTT emergency private call request (MCPTT server to MCPTT
client)
Same changes as above are needed for the MCPTT private call emergency upgrade
procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.2.4.2, i.e. adding
functional aliases to the MCPTT emergency private call request messages
(subclause 10.7.2.1.5 and subclause 10.7.2.1.5a) and perform related
authorisation checks in the MCPTT server.
The MCPTT user profile configuration data in Annex A.3 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [7]
provides all required configuration data needed to apply the procedures above,
i.e. no additional data or changes to existing data is required.
The server URI of the controlling MCPTT server for functional alias is added
in table A.5-2 MCPTT service configuration.

Editor\'s note: Whether the Server URI of the controlling MCPTT server for
functional alias is required is FFS.
### 7.19.2 Solution evaluation
The solutions rely on the FA controlling function of MCPTT server which stores
the functional alias with the MCPTT ID who activates this functional alias, so
that a functional alias can be used as target address for calling other MCPTT
clients. All procedures are derived from existing procedures enhanced with
functional alias specific handing similar as done within Rel-15 group call
procedures, and including the FA controlling function of MCPTT server during
the call setup to route the call request. Rel-15 user profile configuration
data is sufficient to perform verification checks and allows correlation
between functional aliases and MCPTT IDs.
## 7.20 Solution 20 -- Support of functional aliases for video group calls
### 7.20.1 Solution description
#### 7.20.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue #13-1 described in subclause 5.13.1
which aims to support functional aliases for video group calls.
The solution addresses the following procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.281
[9] (on-network only):
\- subclause 7.1.2.3.1.1 Pre-arranged video group calls
\- subclause 7.1.2.3.1.2 Chat video group calls as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281
[9] subclause 7.1.2.3.1.2
Within another subclause, the set of required configuration data is described.
#### 7.20.1.2 Pre-arranged video group calls
The procedure in figure 7.20.1.2-1 describes the case where an MCVideo user,
who is a group member, initiates a pre-arranged group call. The initiation of
a pre-arranged group call results in all other affiliated group members being
invited and functional aliases are used.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.1.2.3.1.1.2.
2\. Optionally, the MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3
may have an activated functional alias to be used during the group
communication.
{width="5.120138888888889in" height="4.143055555555556in"}
Figure 7.20.1.2-1: Pre-arranged video group calls
1\. User at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an MCVideo group call with
a selected group (identified by MCVideo group ID).
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCVideo server via
the SIP core, which hosts the group selected by the user and identified by
MCVideo group ID. If the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 has selected a
functional alias, then the group call request contains that functional alias.
3\. MCVideo server checks whether the user of MCVideo client 1 is authorized
to initiate a group call for the selected group. MCVideo server resolves the
MCVideo group ID to determine the members of that group and their affiliation
status, based on the information from the group management server. The MCVideo
server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and
has been activated for the user.
4\. MCVideo server includes information that it communicates using MCVideo
service. MCVideo users are notified about the incoming group call and the
functional alias of the group call initiating user is displayed if present.
5\. The receiving MCVideo clients accept the group call request, and a group
call response is sent to the group host MCVideo server. The response may
contain the functional alias of the responding MC service user, which is
verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCVideo server.
6\. MCVideo server sends the group call response to the MCVideo client 1,
which may contain the functional alias.
7\. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCVideo user by the
MCVideo server more than once during the call.
8\. MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully established
media plane.
Similar changes are required when applying release pre-arranged group call
procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.1.2.3.1.1.3, late entry
pre-arranged group call procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause
7.1.2.3.1.1.4 and rejoining call procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10]
subclause 7.1.2.3.1.1.5.
For the following messages the functional alias must be added (see 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.1.2.2):
\- 7.1.2.2.1 Group call request (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)
\- 7.1.2.2.2 Group call request (MCVideo server -- MCVideo client)
\- 7.1.2.2.3 Group call response (MCVideo server -- MCVideo client)
\- 7.1.2.2.4 Group call response (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)
\- 7.1.2.2.5 Group call release request (MCVideo server -- MCVideo client)
\- 7.1.2.2.6 Group call release request (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)
\- 7.1.2.2.7 Group call release response (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)
\- 7.1.2.2.8 Group call rejoin request (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)
\- 7.1.2.2.9 Group call rejoin response (MCVideo server -- MCVideo client)
#### 7.20.1.3 Chat video group calls
The procedure in figure 7.20.1.3-1 describes the procedure for the MCVideo
client initiating an MCVideo group call which uses the chat group call model
and functional aliases are used.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.1.2.3.1.2.2.
2\. Optionally, the MCVideo clients 1 to 3 may have activated functional
aliases to be used.
{width="5.934722222222222in" height="2.984722222222222in"}
Figure 7.20.1.3-1: MCVideo chat group call
1\. MCVideo user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group.
1a. MCVideo client 1 sends a group call join request with the MCVideo group ID
of the desired group. It contains the functional alias selected by the MCVideo
user.
1b. The MCVideo server receives the group call join request and verifies that
MCVideo user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group. The MCVideo server
checks whether the MCVideo client 1 is allowed to use the provided functional
alias and whether that functional alias has been activated for the MCVideo
user.
1c. The MCVideo server replies with a group call join response indicating the
acceptance of the group call join request.
2\. The MCVideo server establishes the media plane (if not already
established) for the call. The functional alias of the MCVideo clients are
displayed where appropriate.
3\. Transmission control will continue to be used by the transmission control
participants associated with MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo
client 3 for the duration of the call.
Similar changes are required when applying the release chat group call
described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.1.2.3.1.2.3 and rejoin a chat
group call described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.1.2.3.1.2.4.
For the following messages the functional alias must be added (see 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.5.2.1):
\- 7.1.2.2.10 Group call join request (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)
\- 7.1.2.2.11 Group call join response (MCVideo server -- MCVideo client)
\- 7.1.2.2.12 Group call leave request (MCVideo server -- MCVideo client)
\- 7.1.2.2.13 Group call leave response (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)

### 7.20.2 Solution evaluation
The solution supports the use of functional aliases within pre-arranged group
and chat group call procedures. The solution relies on the principles which
were specified in Rel-15 for group calls, i.e. the MCVideo server checks
whether a functional alias can be used by an MCVideo user within the group
call. The solution lists all messages, which must be extended to provide the
functional aliases and also details the changes required within the
configuration data.
## 7.21 Solution 21 -- Support of functional aliases for private and emergency
video calls
### 7.21.1 Solution description
#### 7.21.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue #13-3 described in subclause 5.13.3
which aims to support functional aliases for private video calls, for video
emergency calls and private video calls using pull or push.
The solution addresses the following procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.281
[9] (on-network only):
\- subclause 7.2.2.3 Private call within one MC system
\- subclause 7.2.2.4 MCVideo emergency private call
\- subclause 7.3.2.3 One-to-one video pull
\- subclause 7.4.2.3 On-network video push
NOTE: Scenarios when multiple users share the same functional alias are not
considered.
#### 7.21.1.2 Private video calls
The procedure in figure 7.21.1.2-1 describes the case where an MCVideo user is
initiating an MCVideo private call for communicating with another MCVideo user
in automatic commencement mode.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.2.2.3.1.
1\. Optionally, the MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 may have an
activated functional alias to be used.
{width="5.488194444444445in" height="3.745138888888889in"}
Figure 7.21.1.2-1: Private video call using functional aliases
1\. User at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an MCVideo private call
for an MCVideo user represented by a functional alias.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo private call request towards the MCVideo
server. The MCVideo private call request contains the functional alias
(instead of the MCVideo ID) of the invited user and, optionally, a functional
alias of the calling user.
3\. MCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call and whether the provided functional
alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user. The
MCVideo server uses the functional alias of the called user to identify the
related MCVideo ID of MCVideo client 2 and checks if it is authorized to
receive the private call. To identify the MCVideo ID of the called user, the
functional alias must have been activated.
4\. MCVideo server may provide a progress indication to MCVideo client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
5\. MCVideo server sends the MCVideo private call request towards the MCVideo
client 2, including the MCVideo ID and the functional alias of the calling
MCVideo user 1 and the called MCVideo user 2.
6\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 notifies the user about the incoming
private call and displays the functional alias of calling MCVideo user 1.
7\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an MCVideo private call response is sent to the MCVideo server.
8\. Upon receiving the MCVideo private call response from MCVideo client 2
accepting the private call request, the MCVideo server informs the MCVideo
client 1 about successful call establishment.
9\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 have successfully established media
plane and can transmit media.
Similar changes are required when using manual commencement mode as described
in 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.2.2.3.2 and private call release (client
initiated) in 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.2.2.3.3.
For the following messages the functional alias must be added (see 3GPP TS
23.281 [9] subclause 7.2.2.2):
\- 7.2.2.2.1 MCVideo private call request (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)
\- 7.2.2.2.2 MCVideo private call request (MCVideo server -- MCVideo client)
\- 7.2.2.2.3 MCVideo private call response (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)
\- 7.2.2.2.4 MCVideo private call response (MCVideo server -- MCVideo client)
\- 7.2.2.2.5 MCVideo call end request
Same applies for the MCVideo emergency private call procedures (regular
initiated and upgraded) described in 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.2.2.4. For
those procedures the following messages require addition of functional aliases
(see 3GPP TS 23.281 [9] subclause 7.2.2.2):
\- 7.2.2.2.6 MCVideo emergency private call request (MCVideo client to MCVideo
server)
\- 7.2.2.2.7 MCVideo emergency private call request (MCVideo server to MCVideo
client)
\- 7.2.2.2.8 Emergency MCVideo private call response (MCVideo client --
MCVideo server)
\- 7.2.2.2.9 Emergency MCVideo private call response (MCVideo server --
MCVideo client)
#### 7.21.1.3 One-to-one video pull
The procedure in figure 7.21.1.3-1 describes the procedure where an MCVideo
user is initiating an MCVideo private call to pull video from a called
MCVideo.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 may have an activated functional
alias to be used.
{width="6.022916666666666in" height="2.5972222222222223in"}
Figure 7.21.1.3-1: One-to-one video pull using functional aliases
1\. MCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 initiates video pull from an MCVideo
client 2 represented by a functional alias. A private call request is sent to
the MCVideo server, which contains the functional alias (instead of the
MCVideo ID) of MCVideo client 2 and, optionally, the functional alias of
MCVideo client 1.
2\. MCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call for video pull, and whether the
provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for
the user. The MCVideo server uses the functional alias of the called user to
identify the related MCVideo ID of MCVideo client 2 and checks if it is
authorized to receive the private call. To identify the MCVideo ID of the
called user, the functional alias must have been activated.
3\. MCVideo server may provide a progress indication to MCVideo client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
4\. MCVideo server sends the private call request towards the MCVideo client
2, including the MCVideo ID and the functional alias of MCVideo client 1 and
the MCVideo client 2.
5\. The MCVideo client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private call for
video pull and displays the functional alias of calling MCVideo client 1.
6\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 accepts the private call for video pull and
sends an MCVideo private call response to the MCVideo server.
7\. Upon receiving the MCVideo private call response from MCVideo client 2
accepting the private call request for video pull, the MCVideo server informs
the MCVideo client 1 about successful call establishment via a private call
response message.
8\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 have successfully established media
plane.
For the following messages the functional alias must be added (see 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.5.2.1):
\- 7.2.2.2.1 MCVideo private call request (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)
\- 7.2.2.2.2 MCVideo private call request (MCVideo server -- MCVideo client)
\- 7.2.2.2.3 MCVideo private call response (MCVideo client -- MCVideo server)
\- 7.2.2.2.4 MCVideo private call response (MCVideo server -- MCVideo client)
\- 7.2.2.2.5 MCVideo call end request
Similar changes are required when applying one-to-one video push as described
in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.3, for the remotely initiated video
push procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.5 and for
the remotely initiated video push to group procedure as described in 3GPP TS
23.282 [10] subclause 7.4.2.6.
In addition, for the following messages the functional alias must be added
(see 3GPP TS 23.282 [10] subclause 7.5.2.1):
\- 7.4.2.2.1 Remote video push request
\- 7.4.2.2.2 Remote video push response
\- 7.4.2.2.3 Remote video push release request
### 7.21.2 Solution evaluation
The solution relies on the MCVideo server capability to correlate the
functional alias with the MCVideo ID, so that a functional alias can be used
as target address for calling other MCVideo clients. The solution relies on
the principles which were specified in Rel-15 for MCPTT group calls, i.e. the
MCVideo server checks whether a functional alias can be used by an MCVideo
user. The solution lists all messages, which must be extended to support
functional aliases. The solution does not cover scenarios when multiple users
share the same functional alias.
## 7.22 Solution 22 -- Support functional alias controlling for MCData
services
### 7.22.1 Solution description
This solution addresses the key issue #12-1, key issue#12-2 and key issue#12-3
described in subclause 5.12.1, subclause 5.12.2 and subclause 5.12.3
respectively which aims to support functional aliases when applying the short
data service (SDS), file distribution (FD), MCData control.
This solution enhances the following solutions with addition of FA controlling
role for the MCData server:
\- Solution#15 as described in subclause 7.15.
\- Solution#16 as described in subclause 7.16.
\- Solution#17 as described in subclause 7.17.
A MCData server (FA controlling role) is used in the path of the MCData server
(controlling) and the terminating MCData UE(s). The MCData server
(controlling) forwards the MCData signalling control plane messages or the
transmission and reception control messages to the MCData server (FA
controlling role) which is further forwarded to the MCData UE(s) based on
functional alias of the MCData user(s).
### 7.22.2 Solution evaluation
The solutions rely on the FA controlling function of MCData server which
stores the functional alias with the MCData ID who activates this functional
alias, so that a functional alias can be used as target address for calling
other MCData clients. All procedures are derived from existing procedures
enhanced with functional alias specific handing similar as done within Rel-15
group call procedures, and including the FA controlling function of MCData
server during the call setup to route the call request. Rel-15 user profile
configuration data is sufficient to perform verification checks and allows
correlation between functional aliases and MCData IDs.
## 7.23 Solution 23 -- Support functional alias controlling for MCVideo
service
### 7.23.1 Solution description
This solution addresses the key issue #13-1, key issue#13-2 and key issue#13-3
described in subclause 5.13.1, subclause 5.13.2 and subclause 5.13.3
respectively which aims to support functional aliases for video emergency
group calls, video group calls, private video calls, for video emergency calls
and private video calls using pull or push.
This solution enhances the following solutions with addition of FA controlling
role for the MCVideo server:
\- Solution#18 as described in subclause 7.18.
\- Solution#20 as described in subclause 7.20.
\- Solution#21 as described in subclause 7.21.
A MCVideo server (FA controlling role) is used in the path of the MCVideo
server (controlling) and the terminating MCVideo UE(s). The MCVideo server
(controlling) forwards the MCVideo signalling control plane messages or the
transmission and reception control messages to the MCVideo server (FA
controlling role) which is further forwarded to the MCVideo UE(s) based on
functional alias of the MCVideo user(s).
### 7.23.2 Solution evaluation
The solutions rely on the FA controlling function of MCVideo server which
stores the functional alias with the MCVideo ID who activates this functional
alias, so that a functional alias can be used as target address for calling
other MCVideo clients. All procedures are derived from existing procedures
enhanced with functional alias specific handing similar as done within Rel-15

## 7.24 Solution 24 -- Additional commencement modes for MCPTT Group calls
### 7.24.1 Solution description
#### 7.24.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #25 described in subclause 5.25 on
additional commencement modes for MCPTT Group calls and as requested by 3GPP
TS 22.179 [3] [R-6.2.1-001a] and [R-6.2.1-001b].
3GPP TS 22.179 [3] [R-6.2.1-001a] requires, if configured, that an MCPTT group
call setup can only proceed when a minimum number of MCPTT group members are
currently affiliated.
3GPP TS 22.179 [3] [R-6.2.1-001b] requires, if configured, that an MCPTT group
call setup can only proceed when specific MCPTT group members are currently
affiliated.
The solution relies on the existing procedure describing the pre-arranged
group call setup (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.3.1.1.2). The MCPTT
server is pre-configured and verifies whether the additional conditions are
met before continuing with the establishment of a pre-arranged group call.
#### 7.24.1.2 Procedure
Figure 7.24.1.2-1 below illustrates a modified pre-arranged group call setup
procedure which takes the additional commencement conditions into account.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 are registered for
receiving MCPTT service and affiliated.
{width="5.80625in" height="5.253472222222222in"}
Figure 7.24.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup
> Step 1 and step 2 are the same as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
> 10.6.2.3.1.1.2.
3\. [The]{.underline} MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1
is authorized to initiate a group call for the selected group. If authorized
and the group call is ongoing for that MCPTT group ID, the MCPTT server adds
the requesting MCPTT client 1 to the existing MCPTT group call and notifies
the MCPTT client 1 that the MCPTT group call is already in progress.
Otherwise, MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members
of that group and their affiliation status, based on the information from the
group management server. [The MCPTT server evaluates the applicable group call
start criteria defined for this group (e.g. minimum number of members.
specific members affiliated) and determines whether the group call setup can
proceed.]{.underline}
NOTE: If the MCPTT group call start criteria are not fulfilled the MCPTT group
call setup does not proceed.
If present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is
allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
If location information was included in the group call request, the MCPTT
server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location
information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call
(refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other
MCPTT users on a call when talking\").
> The procedure is continued as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause
> 10.6.2.3.1.1.2.
The MCPTT group configuration data in Annex A.4 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] is
enhanced by affiliated member criteria which must be met before a pre-arranged
group call can be setup.

### 7.24.2 Solution evaluation
The solution suggests modifying the existing pre-arranged group call setup
procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.3.1.1.2. The MCPTT
server is pre-configured and performs verifications checks before
establishment a pre-arranged group call. The pre-configuration requires
additional parameters within the MCPTT specific group configuration data.
## 7.25 Solution 25 -- Triggering an emergency group communication after an
emergency alert automatically
### 7.25.1 Solution description
#### 7.25.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #24 described in subclause 5.24 on automatic
start of an emergency group communication after an emergency group alert and
as requested by 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-5.6.2.4.1-013].
The solution reuses the existing procedures for initiating an MCPTT emergency
alert as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.3.1 and the
existing procedure for an MCPTT emergency group call commencement as described
in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.1.1. The addition is that the MCPTT
client is configured to trigger a subsequent MCPTT emergency group call. The
subsequent MCPTT emergency group call setup requires no MCPTT user interaction
and is automatically initiated by the MCPTT client. The MCPTT client
configuration is up to implementation and requires no changes within the
configuration data.
#### 7.25.1.2 Procedure
Figure 7.25.1.2-1 below illustrates an MCPTT emergency group call
automatically triggered right after a successful MCPTT emergency group alert.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Same as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.3.1 and
subclause 10.6.2.6.1.1.
{width="6.519444444444445in" height="2.6173611111111112in"}
Figure 7.25.1.2-1: MCPTT emergency group call using functional aliases
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency alert which
triggers the MCPTT emergency alert towards a group as described in 3GPP TS
23.379 [7] subclause 10.6.2.6.3.1.
2\. After completing the MCPTT emergency group alert procedure and without any
MCPTT user interaction, MCPTT client 1 establishes an MCPTT emergency group
call.
It is suggested to add the following note to subclause 10.6.2.6.3.1 of 3GPP TS
23.379 [7]:
NOTE: It is up to MCPTT client implementation whether the MCPTT client
automatically triggers a subsequent MCPTT emergency group call.
### 7.25.2 Solution evaluation
The solution suggests relying on MCPTT client implementation and requires no
changes within the configuration data. The solution is built on existing MCPTT
procedures. A note within normative specification shall hint towards the
suggested solution.
## 7.26 Solution 26 -- User requests application layer priorities
### 7.26.1 Solution description
#### 7.26.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #20 described in subclause 5.20 on user

[R-6.8.7.2-006], [R-6.8.7.2-007], [R-6.8.7.2-008], [R-6.8.7.2-009] and
[R-6.8.7.2-010] defined in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2].
An optional parameter application resource priority is added to the call
requests sent from the MC service client to the MC service server. This
parameter indicates the service level application priority requested by the
user for a specific call or communication. The usage of this requested
application layer priority may differ depending on the deployment
requirements. How the MC service server handles the priorities is
implementation specific.
#### 7.26.1.2 Mission Critical Push-to-Talk

### 7.26.2 Solution evaluation
This solution allows for flexibility at user/terminal side to request a
certain service level priority preference for a specific call or communication
The solution does not change or add any procedures to the existing
specification. The MC service server needs to be able to identify the
application level priorities.
## 7.27 Solution 27 -- MC gateway UE
### 7.27.1 Solution description
#### 7.27.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue #23 described in subclause 5.23.3 which
aims to share a MC service UE by multiple MC service clients without limits in
the number MC service clients per MC service.
Stage 1 requirements (3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [[R-5.15-001]], [[R-5.15-002]] and
[[R-5.15-003]]) are requesting the uses of a gateway UE by MC service users.
The gateway UE need to treat the traffic of the individual MC service users
unaltered and communication traffic attributes, e.g. priority and QoS, of an
MCX User using to a gateway UE need to be treated independently.
#### 7.27.1.2 MC gateway UE definition
For differentiation to other MC services instances, the function of the MC
gateway UE is defined as follows:
**MC gateway UE** A UE that can be simultaneously shared between multiple MC
service clients using the same or different MC services.
#### 7.27.1.3 Baseline MC gateway UE architecture
An MC gateway UE has the option of providing access to the MC service system
for several MC service clients (Figure 7.27.1.3-1). The corresponding MC
service clients can be located directly on the MC gateway UE or outside the MC
gateway UE e.g. non-MC service UE or generally non-MC service device assuming
no UICC capabilities are present. The use of the MC gateway UE does not
restrict the number of identical MC service clients.
{width="5.665972222222222in" height="1.9569444444444444in"}
Figure 7.27.1.3-1: Illustration of the MC gateway UE
In addition, the MC gateway UE enables MC service access for MC service
clients operating on devices that have no MC service UE capabilities.
An MC gateway UE forwards unchanged signalling and user content of the
individual MC service clients. The MC system have to recognize regarding the
binding between MC service client and MC gateway UE.
NOTE: MC service clients using an MC gateway UE may not have an UICC to
authorize against the 3GPP system.
MC service clients using an MC gateway UE may be informed about the
availability of the transport services provided by the MC gateway UE, so that
the MC service client can be enabled to appropriately control the assignment
for the communication.
Editor\'s note: This solution requires further study like positioning of the
individual MC service clients associated with the MC gateway UE, QoS
management of the individual MC service clients and the necessary binding MC
gateway UE and MC service clients etc.
#### 7.27.1.4 Layer 7 versus layer 3 MC gateway consideration
##### 7.27.1.4.1 Introduction
There several boundary conditions apply to the provision and use of a MC
gateway UE that are elaborated in the coming sub-clauses. The items in the
following sub-clause are not exhaustive but address the main requirements
resulting from 3GPP TS 22.280.
##### 7.27.1.4.2 User identification
The users of the MC gateway UE shall remain uniquely identifiable, so that
measures can be taken to exclude users from using the MC gateway UE or add
them for the use of the MC gateway UEs. At this point it should be pointed out
again that the users behind the MC gateway UE do not necessarily have a USIM,
but a clear identification is to be ensured.
Layer 3: With a layer 3 design of a MC gateway UE, the IP address becomes the
identification element that can change over time. Thus, a clear assignment of
user traffic to the individual user is only conditional guaranteed.
Furthermore, the users behind the MC gateway UE have to share the IP address
the MC gateway UE received during the context activation. In this case the MC
gateway UE proxies the individual user traffic identified by the IP address
behind the gateway to a single PDP context IP address. This fact shows even
more that the user behind the traffic is even less identifiable.
Layer 7: With a layer 7 design, the user and his traffic behind the MC gateway
UE can be clearly identified by his MC service ID.
##### 7.27.1.4.3 Communication priority and QoS treatment
The various communications of the users behind the MC gateway UE require
different priorities, latencies, and reliability parameters for their
communications.
Layer 3: The IP protocol has only limited mechanisms to distinguish between
priority of communication and other QoS parameters i.e. latency and
reliability.
Layer 7: The user has the ability to request independently e.g. different
priorities and other QoS parameter for each individual communication.
##### 7.27.1.4.4 Resource sharing of the MC gateway UE
Transport resources provided by the MC gateway UE and the own processing
resources that can be provided by the MC gateway UE are finite. Accordingly,
the number of concurrent users is limited behind the MC gateway UE.
Accordingly, provision should be made for adapting the number of concurrent
users.
Layer 3: Since the IP address does not guarantee a clear identification of the
user behind the MC gateway UE, even with the reference to the IP proxy
function, no restrictions on the number of users and their communications can
be made.
Layer 7: By using the MC service IDs, each individual user behind the MC
gateway UE can be uniquely identified and their use of the MC gateway UE can
be restricted.
##### 7.27.1.4.5 Summary layer 3 versus layer 7 MC gateway UE
Based on the comparison of layer 3 versus layer 7 MC gateway UE, the approach
of the Application MC gateway UE (layer 7) clearly identifies the user behind
the MC gateway UE, allows the control of the QoS parameters per user and
selectively controls the utilization of an MC gateway. Accordingly, future
versions will refer exclusively to the application MC gateway UE (layer 7).
#### 7.27.1.5 User identities
##### 7.27.1.5.1 User identities in the control plane
Currently, the following analysis refers exclusively to the use of the on-
network communication mode.
Sharing of an MC gateway UE by different MC service client simultaneously
using the same or different services requires a one-to-one matching of the MC
service identities to the simultaneously running communication streams passing
through the MC gateway UE. MC service clients shares the available resources
at the MC gateway UE e.g. APN (s) and reference points provided by the MC
gateway UE.
In existing MC services, there is a one-to-one correspondence of MC service ID
with an IMPU which enables routing of signalling between MC service server and
MC service clients. Changes need to be made at application level, to allow the
association of a single control plane reference point to multiple MC service
IDs.
For the control plane, this means that all control plane messages must contain
the target and originator MC service ID information to associate the
communication accordingly. This approach is not common to all MC services
today. While MCData [3GPP TS 23.282] includes the MC service ID of the target
and the originator, this can be found e.g. not fully present in MCPTT [3GPP TS
23.379 [7]].
For the user plane, simultaneous session is already a functionality whereby
the MC service client can receive the media from multiple MC service sessions
over the same SIP session and media bearer(s) between the MC service client
and the MC service server.
##### 7.27.1.5.2 Conclusion on user identities
Accordingly, it must be ensured within the individual MC services that the MC
service ID of the initiator or addressee is contained in the control plane
information as there are:
\- Any kind of request message(s);
\- Any kind of response message(s);
\- Any kind of release message(s);
\- Any kind of notification message(s).
#### 7.27.1.6 User identification behind the MC gateway UE
##### 7.27.1.6.1 IMS subscription options
The basis for the following description is according to 3GPP TS 23.280 [2]
subclause 10.1.4.
The starting point is that the users behind the MC gateway UE have no USIM,
but the MC system is based on the use of the IMPUs. Accordingly, the settings
of the USIM information form the basis for providing the MC service IDs
accordingly. There are two user identity association options for using the MC
gateway UE:
Option 1 (figure 7.27.1.6.1-1) uses the MC service IDs provided with the USIM
of the MC gateway UE. All users behind the MC gateway UE share the credentials
of the IMS subscription associated with the USIM of the MC gateway UE. The
number of users behind the MC gateway UE is determined by the number of
subscribed MC service IDs that are associated with the IMS subscription
associated with the USIM used by the MC gateway UE.
{width="6.745138888888889in" height="2.6666666666666665in"}
Figure 7.27.1.6.1-1: Option 1 - Sharing MC gateway UE IMS subscription
Option 2 (figure 7.27.1.6.1-2) provides user subscriptions using the IMS
Credential Application (IMC) for the users behind the MC gateway UE, which are
independent to the IMS subscription associated with the USIM of the MC gateway
UE. The MC gateway UE MC service ID and the MC service ID used by the devices
share the resources and the reference points of the MC gateway UE accordingly.
{width="6.745138888888889in" height="2.6666666666666665in"}
Figure 7.27.1.6.1-2: Option 2 Devices using dedicated IMS subscription
##### 7.27.1.6.2 Comparison IMS subscription options
Both options support the unambiguous identification of the users behind the MC
gateway UE. Option 2 also has the degree of freedom that the user profiles
associated with the devices behind the MC gateway UE are independent of the MC
gateway user profile.
## 7.28 Solution 28 -- IP connectivity
### 7.28.1 Solution description
#### 7.28.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue #22 described in subclause 5.22 which
aims for a IP based data communication using MCData service.
Stage 1 requirements (3GPP TS 22.282 [5] [[R-5.5.2-001]], [[R-5.5.2-002]],
[[R-5.5.2-003]], [[R-5.5.2-004]], [[R-5.5.2-005]] and [[R-5.5.2-006]]) are
requesting IP connectivity to be used for applications that are based on the
IP client-server paradigm or IP based communication between MCData users.
#### 7.28.1.2 Baseline IP connectivity
IP connectivity provides a IP based virtual network service using an MCData
bearer between MC service clients which is transparent to the 3GPP system
(Figure 7.28.1.2-1). The MCData client enables IP-based communication with the
support of MCData service and thus forms the gateway to data hosts or servers.
Therefore, the MCData client manages the provision of the MCData bearer, the
associated QoS requirement and communication priority.
{width="5.409722222222222in" height="1.1215277777777777in"}
Figure 7.28.1.2-1: MCData IP connectivity model
With the support of the MCData client IP connectivity enables bidirectional
data communication between two or more MCData clients which can be associated
with MC service UEs, servers or devices without 3GPP system access.
#### 7.28.1.3 IP connectivity communication modes
MCData IP connectivity can be done between two MCData clients or several
MCData clients. Accordingly, there are two IP connectivity communication
modes:
Point-to-point MC Data IP connectivity (Figure 7.28.1.3-1) that is limited to
two MCData clients according to requirement [R-5.5.2-001] in 3GPP TS 22.282
[5].

Figure 7.28.1.3-2: Multipoint MC Data IP connectivity
Editor\'s note: This solution requires further study like the impact of IP
versions, addressing of the individual MCData clients, authorisation, reject
and revoke IP connectivity (incoming and outgoing), (Remote) Priority
adjustment per package (Priority Application Layer to Priority Transport
System) according to 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] requirement [R-5.5.2-006] and possible
impact of group regrouping.
#### 7.28.1.4 Distinction between IP connectivity and other MCData services
IP connectivity service enables the exchange of IP data using MCData bearer
service. The relevant RFCs for the Internet Protocol are assumed to be given
here. IP data will not show limitations in the payload size and differentiates
from SDS as follows:
**IP Data:** structured or unstructured payload that is transparent to the
MCData bearer service.
IP connectivity provides the transport of IP Data for e.g. data hosts,
servers, etc. that do not have mission critical communication capabilities.
The corresponding MCData client for IP connectivity manages the necessary
registration to the MCData service, communication establishment, communication
termination and the management of the required priority for the exchange of IP
Data. An MCData client that supports IP connectivity can detect IP data sent
by a data host and forwards that IP Data passing through MCData Servers to the
destination IP connectivity capable MCData client(s).
An authorised MCData client for IP connectivity is able to bar incoming IP
connectity requests either on demand or by providing a list of excluded
origins identified by the MCData ID and, if available, by the functional
alias.
For IP connectivity, the MCData server may support following limitation to
exchange IP Data:
\- limit the total data volume between the authorized MCData clients, divided
by transmission and reception;
\- max time limit, e.g. total minutes or allow exchange between predefined
start and end time.
IP connectivity MCData service supports MCData bearer services for one-to-one
and group communication. IP address allocation necessary for IP connectivity
MCData bearer service is independent to the IP address allocation of the
individual data hosts using IP connectivy. The required IP address pools for
the IP connectivity MCData service are managed by the IP connectivity MCData
Bearer service.
#### 7.28.1.5 IP connectivity point-to-point MCData bearer service
##### 7.28.1.5.1 General
A capable IP connectivity MCData client establishes an MCData bearer services
with another MCData client. For the IP Data the media plane is used.
##### 7.28.1.5.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.28.1.5.2-1 describes the case where an IP
connectivity capable MCData client is initiating a point-to-point IP
connectivity MCData Bearer Service with another IP connectivity capable MCData
client.
Pre-conditions:
\- The total data volume limit, e.g. daily time limit or total data volume per
day does not restrict the establishment of an IP connectivity IP data
exchange.
\- MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are linked with individual data hosts.
\- MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 belong to the same MCData system.
\- The data hosts linked with MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 already have
an IP address allocated.

1\. MCData client 1 initiates an IP connectivity point-to-point request to
MCData client 2.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData IPcon point-to-point request towards the
MCData server. The MCData IPcon point-to-point request contains only one
target MCData client for point-to-point data communication as requested by
MCData client 1.
3\. MCData server checks whether MCData client 1 is authorized to send an
MCData IPcon point-to-point request and if MCData client 2 is authorised to
receive the IP connectivity service. If a functional alias is active and
associated with the MCData ID, the MC Data server verifies if certain
conditions shall be considered, e.g. MC service user location, to establish
the communication.
4\. The MCData server also applies transmission and reception control and the
necessary policy to ensure that appropriate data is transmitted between the
MCData clients.
5\. MCData server initiates the MCData IPcon point-to-point request towards
the MCData client 2.
6\. MCData client 2 sends a MC Data IPcon point-to-point response to the
MCData server that contains the information if the request is accepted or the
reason of rejection. If accepted, the MCData client 2 will incorporate the
time limit if required.
7\. MCData server forwards the MCData IPcon response of MCData client 2 to
MCData client 1.
8\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 obtain the relevant IP addresses used
for the MCData bearer service.
9\. MCData client 1 and MCData Client 2 use the MCData bearer service to
exchange IP Data over the established media plane.

##### 7.28.1.5.4 IP connectivity group service
###### 7.28.1.5.4.1 General
The initiation of a group IP connectivity to a selected group results in
affiliated group members exchanging IP Data between associated data hosts
linked with IP connectivity capable MCData clients.
###### 7.28.1.5.4.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.28.1.5.4.2-1 describes the case where an IP
connectivity capable MCData client associated with a data host is initiating
group MCData IP connectivity communication to other IP connectivity capable
MCData clients associated with other data hosts.
Pre-conditions:
\- Data hosts linked with MCData client 1 to MCData client n belong to the
same group and are already registered for receiving MCData service and are
affiliated.
\- The total data volume limit, e.g. daily time limit or total data volume per
day, does not restrict the establishment of an IP connectivity IP data
exchange.
\- MCData client 1 to MCData client n are linked with individual data hosts.
\- MCData client 1 and MCData client n belong to the same MCData system.
\- The data hosts linked with the IP connectivity capable MCData clients
already have an IP address allocated.

Figure 7.28.1.5.4.2: Establishment of IPcon group communication
1\. MCData client 1 initiates an IP connectivity group request to a pre-
configured group (identified by MCData group ID) and optionally particular
members from that group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData IPcon group request towards the MCData
server. The MCData IPcon group request contains target recipient(s) as
provided by the MCData client 1.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData client 1 is authorized to send
MCData IPcon group data request and that the target MCData clients are
authorised to receive the IP connectivity service.
4\. The MCData server resolves the MCData group ID to determine the members of
that group and their affiliation status, based on the information from the
group management server. If a functional alias is active and associated with
the MCData ID, the MC Data server verifies if certain conditions shall be
considered, e.g. MCData client location, to establish the communication.
5\. The MCData server also applies transmission and reception control and the
necessary policy to ensure that appropriate IP Data are transmitted between
the MCData clients.
6\. MCData server initiates the MCData IPcon group request towards each MCData
client determined in step 4.
7\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n automatically accept the MCData IPcon
group request and respond with MCData IPcon group response towards MCData
server that contains the information if the request is accepted or the reason
of rejection. If accepted, the MCData clients 2 to n will incorporate the time
limit if required.
8\. MCData server forwards the MCData clients 2 to n accepted response to the
MCData user of MCData client 1 who initiated the MCData IPcon group request.
NOTE: The MCData client 1 considers the individual received time limits for
discrimination purposes.
9\. All involved MCData clients obtain the relevant IP addresses used for the
MCData bearer service.
10\. All MCData clients exchange IP Data over the established media plane. The
MCData server forwards the IP Data received from one MCData client to the
target MCData client(s).

#### 7.28.1.6 Functional model update
IP connectivity as a new service requires the integration into the general
MCData functional model and a detailed description as an IP connectivity
functional model. Currently, IP connectivity is considered as an on-network
service only.

In the model shown in figure 7.28.1.6-2, the following apply:
\- MCData-IPcon-1 reference point is used for MCData application signalling
for establishing a session in support of MCData IP connectivity.
\- MCData-IPcon-2 reference point carries bidirectional IP Data for point-to-
point MCData IP connectivity over the media plane between the IPcon
distribution function of the MCData server and the IPcon function of the
MCData client(s).
\- MCData-IPcon-3 reference point carries simultaneous bidirectional IP Data
between multiple MCData clients over the media plane between the IPcon
distribution function of the MCData server and the IPcon function of the
MCData client(s).
### 7.28.2 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution allows the use for two or more MCData clients to
participate in an IP connectivity session. The MCData client is addressed by
means of MCData ID or optionally by means of a functional alias. IP
connectivity can be limited in time by default.
Editor\'s note: The withdrawal of an IP connectivity connection by an
authorized user is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The remote initiation of IP connectivity service is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The control of QoS based on per packet priority is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The impact of IP connectivity services on interworking is FFS.
## 7.29 Solution 29 -- Call forwarding and call transfer for private calls
### 7.29.1 Solution description
### 7.29.1.1 General
This solution addresses a key issue listed in subclause 5.26 on call
forwarding and call transfer for private calls. It is based on the similar
concepts as used by the TAS services in public networks for public users, but
they are adapted to support the service functionality based on MCPTT IDs.
Additionallly the scope is limited to cover only the small subset of services
needed by the mission critical user community.

is enhanced by the following parameters to support call forwarding and call
transfer functionality.
Table 7.29.1.8-1: MCPTT user profile data (on and off network)
* * *
Reference Parameter description MCPTT UE MCPTT Server Configuration management
server MCPTT user database Allow private call forwarding Y Y Y Allow private

List containing pairs of target MCPTT ID and condition Y Y Y
* * *
Because the forwarding/transfer is done based on MCPTT user identities, the
related details have to be visible for the affected MCPTT users. Therefore,
for conveying redirection-related information the following new parameters
will be introduced in mcpttinfo.
\- Mcptt redirecting ID
\- Mcptt redirection target ID
Additionally, to support the transfer functionality the existing parameter
\ can be used. However, to be able to distinguish between
\"normal\" call setup and call transfer for a pre-established session, it is
required to introduce a new value \'transfer\' for this parameter.
Editor\'s note: For call forwarding the handling of the busy condition is FFS.
Editor\'s note: For both call forwarding, and call transfer the handling of
functional alias is FFS.
Editor\'s note: How the user can change the configuration of call forwarding
is FFS.
#### 7.29.1.9 Update configuration of call forwarding
An authorized user can update the call forwarding related parameters stored in
the user profile using the procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8]
subclause 10.1.4.5.
### 7.29.2 Solution evaluation
The solution relies on existing procedures for user profile data management
and private calls. For user profile data management, the user data profile
data is enhanced with the parameters as listed in table 7.29.1.8-1. No changes
for the flows are required.
For the solution of the call forwarding and transfer new procedures are
defined which are re-using the principles of the existing procedures for
private calls. The solution lists all messages, which must be extended to
provide the functionality required for call forwarding and transfer.
Identified gaps:
\- Add the procedures for call transfer and call forwarding of private calls
to 3GPP TS 23.379 [7] subclause 10.7.
## 7.30 Solution 30 -- Arbitration of incoming communications
### 7.30.1 Solution description
#### 7.30.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #3 described in subclause 5.3 on arbitration
of incoming communications. The relevant requirements are [R-5.4.2-004A] and
[R-5.4.2-004B] as defined in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2].
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] table A.3-1 allows to configure a list of users who can be
called via a private call. For each user a presentation priority relative to
other users and groups can be defined.
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] table A.3-2 allows to configure a presentation priority for
MCPTT groups relative to other groups and users.
The use of the presentation priority parameter by the MCPTT UE is not
specified.
That means that current standard already fulfils arbitration/presentation of
incoming communications via pre-configuration, whereas it does not allow
authorised users to change the pre-configuration and so does not allow to
change the presentation order of incoming communications. It is suggested to
rely on the current standard for this release.
### 7.30.2 Solution evaluation
Existing procedures and configuration data are used. Normative changes are not
required.
## 7.31 Solution 31 -- Client performs automatic activation and deactivation
of functional aliases based on location
### 7.31.1 Solution description
#### 7.31.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #8-5 described in subclause 5.8.5 on use of
location dependent functional aliases for private calls.
Stage 1 requirement (3GPP TS 22.280 [2] [R-5.9a-019]) is requesting a
mechanism to define a functional alias with related geographic areas that can
be associated to MC service users for routing location dependent private
communications.
#### 7.31.1.2 Solution principles
It is suggested to re-use existing functional alias management procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [8] subclause 10.13.4 (MC service user activates
functional alias(es) within an MC system) and subclause 10.13.5 (MC service
user de-activates functional alias(es) within an MC system). Both procedures
do already foresee, as described within the pre-conditions, that an activation
or de-activation request may be triggered by an event such as the MC service
UE is entering/leaving a geographic operational area of a functional alias.
That means there are no changes needed within the existing procedures, but
there is a need to configure the client properly by defining additional
configuration management data.
#### 7.31.1.3 Configuration management data

The solution re-uses existing functionalities, no changes to existing
procedures are needed.
The MC service specific user profile configuration data are extended.
## 7.32 Solution 32 -- Functional alias and alternative addressing scheme for
interworking with LMR systems
### 7.32.1 Solution description
#### 7.32.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue #16-1, #16-2, #16-3 described in
subclauses 5.16-1, 5.16-2 and 5.16-3 which aim for the support of functional
alias towards legacy mission critical communication systems e.g. TETRA, GSM-R
etc.
Note that bi-directional protocol translation between the MC service system
and the LMR systems as well as the mapping between the functional alias of the
MC service user in the MC system and the alternative functional address of the
LMR user used in the LMR system are out of scope in 3GPP.
\- Determine impact on interworking of functionality introduced for functional
alias in MCPTT that is not available in LMR systems. These are for example:
\- Functional alias shared between multiple MCPTT users.
\- Functional alias allowed to be taken over.
\- Time limit after which the functional alias will be automatically
deactivated.
### 7.32.1 Solution description for key issues #16-2 and #16-3
#### 7.32.1.1 Identity mapping for alternative user addressing schemes
The IWF as coupling unit to LMR systems has the possibility to link
alternative addressing user systems of the LMR systems with the functional
alias approach provided by the MC system. Accordingly, the functional alias
can be used in communication with the users of the LMR systems. In addition to
the use of the functional alias for the individual types of communication,
this also serves as a prerequisite for participating in a communication.
#### 7.32.1.2 Affected messages

### 7.32.1 Solution description for key issues #16-1
#### 7.32.1.1 IWF functional alias management
##### 7.32.1.1.1 General
LMR users (MC service client behind the IWF) are external to the MC system,
which should also have the ability to enable, apply, or disable Functional

Figure 7.32.1.1.3-1 below illustrates the active functional alias list query
for a certain MC service user.
{width="4.594444444444444in" height="2.2604166666666665in"}
Figure 7.32.1.1.3-1: IWF active functional alias list query
1\. The IWF (MC service client of the MC service user behind the IWF) requests
a list of active functional aliases for a certain MC service user from the MC
service server by sending a IWF functional alias information query request.
The corresponding MC service ID of the queried user is included.
2\. The MC service server checks whether the querying MC service user is
authorized to perform the query. If authorized, then the MC service server
retrieves the requested active functional alias information based on the
corresponding MC service ID.
3\. The MC service server sends a IWF functional alias information query
response including the active functional alias information to the IWF (MC
service client of the MC service user behind the IWF).
##### 7.32.1.1.4 IWF (MC service user) activates functional alias(es) within
an MC system
The procedure for MC service user (client associated with the MC service ID)
behind the IWF activates functional alias(es) within an MC system is
illustrated in figure 7.32.1.1.4-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client behind the IWF has already been provisioned (statically
or dynamically) with the functional alias(es) information that the MC service
client behind the IWF is allowed to activate.
2\. MC service server may have retrieved the user subscription and functional
alias policy e.g. which user(s) are authorized to activate to what functional
alias, priority, and other configuration data.
3\. MC service client behind the IWF may have indicated to the functional
alias management server that it wishes to receive updates of functional alias
data for the functional aliases for which it is authorized.
4\. The MC service client behind the IWF triggers the functional alias
activation procedure. This is an explicit activation caused either by the MC
service user or determined by a trigger event such as the MC service user
coming within a permitted geographic operational area of a functional alias.
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="3.2631944444444443in"}
Figure 7.32.1.1.4-1: IWF functional alias activation procedure within an MC
system
1\. MC service client of the MC service user behind the IWF requests the MC
service server to activate a functional alias or a set of functional aliases.
2\. The MC service server checks if there are any conflicts with active
functional alias(es).
3\. If the user behind the IWF of the MC service client is authorised to
activate the requested functional alias(es) then the MC service server stores
the functional alias(es) status of the requested functional alias(es).
If a certain functional alias(es) can be simultaneously active for multiple MC
service users and the upper limit of number of simultaneous MC service users
is not reached, the MC service shall activate the functional alias(es) for the
MC service user and inform all other MC service user(s) with sharing the same
functional alias(es) (step 5). If the limit of number of simultaneous MC
service users is reached or the functional alias is not allowed to be shared,
the request is rejected, and the MC service user is notified (step 4).
If the functional alias(es) is (are) already used by another MC service
user(s), an authorized MC service user gets an offer to take over the
functional alias from the MC service user currently using the functional
alias(es).
4\. MC service server sends a IWF functional alias(es) activation response to
the IWF.
5\. The MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) and/or IWF
sharing the same functional alias(es).
##### 7.32.1.1.5 IWF (MC service user) de-activates functional alias(es)
within an MC system
The procedure for IWF (MC service client behind the IWF) de-activates
functional alias(es) within an MC system is illustrated in figure
7.32.1.1.5-1.
When an MC service user hidden by the IWF does not want to use a functional
alias(es) anymore, then the MC service user hidden by the IWF can de-activate
functional alias(es).
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service server has already subscribed to the functional alias(es)
information from the functional alias management server and has stored the
data of the functional alias(es) a MC service user hidden by the IWF has
activated.
2\. The IWF (MC service client hidden by the IWF) triggers the functional
alias(es) de-activation procedure. This is an explicit de-activation request
either by the IWF (hidden MC service user) or determined by a trigger event
such as the user moving outside a permitted geographic operational area of a
functional alias.
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="3.2631944444444443in"}
Figure 7.32.1.1.5-1: IWF functional alias de-activation procedure within an MC
system
1\. The IWF (hidden MC service client) requests the MC service server to de-
activate a functional alias or a set of functional aliases.
2\. Based on the MC service user subscription and stored functional alias
policy, the MC service server checks if the MC service user (hidden by the
IWF) of the MC service client is authorized to de-activate from the requested
functional alias(es) and if the MC service user (hidden by the IWF) of the MC
service client has activated to the requested functional alias(es).
3\. If the MC service user hidden by the IWF is authorized to de-activate from
the requested functional alias(es) then the MC service server updates the
functional alias activation status of the MC service user.
4\. MC service server provides to the MC service client (hidden by the IWF)
the functional alias de-activation response.
5\. The MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) and/or IWF
sharing the same functional alias(es).
##### 7.32.1.1.6 IWF (Authorised MC service user) takes over functional
alias(es) within an MC system
The procedure for MC service user hidden by the IWF takes over functional
alias(es) within an MC system is illustrated in figure 7.32.1.1.6-1.
During functional alias(es) activation, if the functional alias(es) is (are)
already used by another MC service user(s), an authorized MC service user
hidden by the IWF may get an offer to take over the functional alias(es) from
the MC service user currently using the functional alias(es).
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client 1 has performed the functional alias(es) activation
procedure as described in subclause 7.32.1.1.4.
2\. As result of the functional alias(es) activation procedure, the user
hidden by the IWF is aware which functional alias(es) are already used but can
be taken over.
3\. The user hidden by the IWF decides to take over a functional alias.
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="2.8881944444444443in"}
Figure 7.32.1.1.6-1: IWF functional alias taking over procedure within an MC
system
1\. MC service client 1 hidden by the IWF 1 requests the MC service server to
take over a functional alias by sending a IWF functional alias take over
request.
2\. The MC service server checks if there are any conflicts taking over the
functional alias.
3\. If the user (MC service client 1 hidden by the IWF) is authorised to take
over the requested functional alias then the MC service server sends a
functional alias revoke notification to inform MC service client 2 that the
functional alias has been revoked and is not any longer active for the user of
MC service client 2.
4\. The MC service server stores the functional alias status of the requested
functional alias.
5\. MC service server sends a IWF functional alias take over response to the
IWF where the MC service client 1 is hidden.
6\. The MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) including the
one hidden by the IWF sharing the same functional alias.
### 7.32.2 Solution evaluation
The solution consists of two parts.
Part 1 allows the functional alias management as well for LMR users that is a
precondition to allow functional alias as during the communication
establishment and later during the conversation phase and addresses key-issue
16-1.
Part 2 address the use of functional alias during communication establishment
and the conversation phase and addresses key issue 16-2 and 16-3.
Editor\'s Note: Time limit after which the functional alias will be
automatically deactivated is FFS.
## 7.33 Solution 33 -- Communication priority for functional aliases
### 7.33.1 Solution description
#### 7.33.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue #5 described in subclause 5.5 on
communication priority for functional aliases. The relevant requirement is
[R-5.9a-016] defined in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2].
Communication priorities in conjunction with functional aliases can be handled
by the MC service server without additional interactions with the MC service
client. The MC service server is pre-configured to associate the functional
alias with a certain priority, which then allows the MC service server to
arbitrate parallel communications.
NOTE: How the MC service server handles the relationship with the priority of
the user for initiating/receiving calls is implementation specific.
#### 7.33.1.3 Configuration management data
Table 7.33.1.3-1 contains the MCPTT user profile configuration enhancements to
3GPP TS 23.379 [7] table A.3-2.
Table 7.33.1.3-1: MCPTT user profile data (on network)

* * *
### 7.33.2 Solution evaluation
The solution re-uses existing procedures without any changes.
The MCPTT service configuration data is enhanced by adding a communication
priority associated to a functional alias.

service. While PtP voice communication is using the ISDN style approach,
multipoint voice communication is based on the ASCI feature. For the general
GSM-R architecture 3GPP TS 23.002 [12] applies. ASCI provide voice broadcast
communication (see 3GPP TS 43.069 [14]) as well as voice group call
communication (see 3GPP TS 43.068 [13]) which are only applicable within the
GSM-R system. Dispatcher/controller are using ISDN or SIP style communication.
The groups and their related attributes as well as dispatcher/controller
associated to the group are managed by the Group Call Register (GCR). The GCR
function is mainly a database function, holding information about voice
group/voice broadcast calls. GCR data for a specific voice group call is set
at the creation of the group call attributes, and can be subsequently
modified. The GCR implementation is not specified. It can be realized e.g. as
a new network node, in a PABX directly attached to an MSC, inside an MSC or
inside an HLR. Thus, the interface between the GCR function and other
functions is not specified in the GSM technical specifications and allows
other functional splits.
An Group Call Area/Broadcast Area can encompass one or multiple cells managed
by one anchor-MSC and multiple relay-MSCs. The anchor- MSC provides the
management towards the relay-MSCs and does not necessarily administrate cells
for a certain group call area. The cell(s) associated with the Group Call
Area/Broadcast Area implicitly addresses the geographical area applicable for
group communication or broadcast. A cell can be associated with multiple Group
Call Areas/Broadcast Areas.

## B.2 Numbering plans
### B.2.1 E.164 und functional addressing
E.164 addressing scheme is primarily used for Point-to-Point communication
between GSM-R users and to allow communication towards networks using E.164
numbering e.g. PLMN, PSTN.
On top of E.164 numbering plan alternative addressing scheme called functional
addressing in accordance with EIRENE specification [16] is used in the context
with GSM-R. Functional addressing scheme allows the establishment of
communication without knowing the particular E.164 number associated with the
train UE e.g. cab radio.
A functional address consists of IC+CT+UN:
IC: International code is used to route calls to the appropriate GSM-R network
CT: Call Type prefix defines how to interpret the User Number (UN) as train
function number, engine function number, group calls etc.
UN: User Number is of variable length and depends on the information i.e.
train function number etc. Within the UN a Functional Code (FC) is associated
and provides the information of the person or equipment on a particular train,
or a particular team within a given area. Therefore, the UN consists of User
Identification Number (UIN) i.e. train number etc. and the Functional Code
(FC) resulting into: UN= UIN+FC
### B.2.2 Addressing scheme for multipoint voice communication
A controller can address a VBS/VGCS communication by using the elementary
identities described in 3GPP TS 43.068 [13], 3GPP TS 43.069 [14] respecting
the numbering scheme provided by ITU-T Recommendation E.164 [15].
ASCI is using a group call reference which consists of an group call area ID
and a group ID which can be used to address an individual communication.
\- The group ID is a sequence of decimal digits with a maximum length
depending on the composition of the group call reference. The length of Group
ID is in a range of 1 to 8 digits.
\- The group call area ID is a sequence of decimal digits uniquely assigned to
a group call area in one network and with a maximum length depending on the
composition of the group call reference defined under c).
A voice group call in a network is uniquely identified by its group call
reference. The group call reference is a concatenated sequence of the group ID
(as the least significant part) and the group call area ID (as the most
significant part). The group call reference has a maximum length of 8 decimal
digits. The composition of the group call area ID and the group ID can be
specific for each network operator.
* * *
Group call area ID Group ID
* * *
The broadcast call reference applicable for VBS relies on the definition of
the group call reference.
A service subscriber initiating a voice group call must call the wanted group
ID. The MSC in which the call is originated accumulates from the BSS the
called group ID and the originating cell ID.
* * *
Originating cell ID Group ID
* * *
The use of VGCS service or VBS service is indicated during communication
service request.
For dispatcher originated calls an MSISDN is dialled. The Country Code (CC)
and National Destination Code (NDC) are used as normal for routing purposes.
The CC and NDC may be omitted for internal calls. The numbering scheme is
based on ITUâ€‘T Recommendation E.164 [15]. The Subscriber Number (SN) is used
to indicate:
\- the request of a group call or broadcast call by use of a prefix. The
length of the prefix consits of 1 to 2 digits;
\- the wanted group call reference as described above.
* * *
CC NDC Prefix Group call reference
* * *
Identities used for notification messages to dispatchers are identical to
those used by dispatchers to initiate calls as described.
The applicable cells for VBS/VGCS communication are aggregated under the
corresponding area ID. A group ID is used to address a certain function of the
group communication e.g. railway emergency or communication between drivers in
the same area. Table B.2.2-1 provides a non-exhaustive list about the use of
Group IDs in the railway operational environment.

Operational Communication 270 - 279 VGCS Train Preparation 299 VGCS Train
groups: Emergency call 203 VBS Multi train On-board PA systems

## B.3 Pre-emption and arbitration of communication
For the arbitration of the individual communication, enhanced Multi Level
Precedence and Pre-emption (eMLPP) service in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.067
[17] is used. Precedence involves assigning a priority level to a call-in
combination with fast call set up. Pre-emption involves the seizing of
resources, which are in use by a call of a lower precedence, by a higher-level
precedence call in the absence of idle resources. Pre-emption can also involve
the disconnection of an on-going call of lower precedence to accept an
incoming call of higher precedence. eMLPP is only applicable for the use
between GSM-R UE and GSM network.
For the interworking to communication systems external to GSM-R Multi Level
Precedence and Pre-emption (MLPP) can be used to address arbitration of the
individual communication.
B.4 Talker Control
B.4.1 VGCS
Within each voice group call starting from the instant where the calling
service subscriber first becomes a listening service subscriber, one service
subscriber has the access at any one time to the uplink and his speech is then
broadcast on all downlinks accordingly. The mobile station of the talking
service subscriber who uses the uplink of the voice group call channel can be
commanded by the network to mute or unmute the downlink when needed. The
mobile station is commanded:
\- to mute the downlink in order to avoid non- intelligible echoes (in this
case, the talking service subscriber cannot hear dispatcher\'s voice); and
\- to unmute the downlink to hear dispatcher\'s voice.
Dispatchers\' voice involved shall be broadcast at any time. Mobile
dispatchers are provided with a standard link and thus with a dedicated
permanent uplink.
B.4.2 VBS
Within each voice broadcast call only the voice of the calling service
subscriber or calling dispatcher is transmitted on the downlink.
