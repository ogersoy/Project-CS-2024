# 4 Scenarios
## 4.1 General
The following subclauses describe scenarios that will arise from a request
from an authorized MC user for discreet listening of the communications of a
second MC user within the authority of the authorized MC user. Use cases for
MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData are captured.
In each case, the authorized MC user will be presented with media which has
originated from or is destined for the target MC user of the discreet
listening request. If this media is protected by encryption and other security
measures, the mechanism by which the actual content of the media is revealed
to the authorized MC user is outside the scope of the present document.
## 4.2 Scenario 1: Discreet listening of MCPTT and MCVideo private calls
### 4.2.1 Scenario 1.1: Discreet listening of MCPTT and MCVideo private calls
in same MC service server
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for communications involving MC user B where MC user A and MC user B
are served by the same MC service server, MC service server A and MC service
user B is within the authority of authorized MC user A. The scenario is
illustrated in figure 4.2.1-1 below.
Figure 4.2.1-1: Discreet listening of MCPTT or MCVideo private call in single
MC service server
The scenario consists of the following aspects:
\- Authorized MC user A identifies MC user B as the target for discreet
listening, and the request for discreet listening is sent by MC service client
A to MC service server A, which verifies that MC user A is authorized to
perform discreet listening on MC user B. This aspect takes place before any
communications involving MC user B can be subject to discreet listening.
\- MC user B places or receives an MCPTT or MCVideo private call to or from MC
user C.
\- MC service server A provides MC service client A with information
concerning the initiation of the call, including the identity of MC user C,
and also provides the media exchanged between the two parties in the call.
\- When the private call completes, the call completion is also conveyed to MC
service client A.
NOTE: The scenario also applies to emergency private calls.
### 4.2.2 Scenario 1.2: Discreet listening of MCPTT and MCVideo private calls
with target receiving service from different MC service server
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for communications involving MC user B where MC service user B is
within the authority of authorized MC user A and where MC user A and MC user B
have different primary MC service servers, MC service servers A and B. The
scenario is illustrated in figure 4.2.2-1 below.
Figure 4.2.2-1: Discreet listening of MCPTT or MCVideo private call with
target served by different MC service servers
The scenario consists of the following aspects:
\- Authorized MC user A identifies MC user B as the target for discreet
listening, and the request for discreet listening is sent by MC service client
A to MC service server A, which verifies that MC user A is authorized to
perform discreet listening on MC user B. This aspect takes place before any
communications involving MC user B can be subject to discreet listening.
\- MC service server A identifies MC service server B as the primary MC
service server for MC user B. MC service server A requests the discreet
listening function from MC service server B.
\- MC user B places or receives an MCPTT or MCVideo private call to or from MC
user C.
\- MC service server A provides MC service client A with information
concerning the initiation of the call, including the identity of MC user C,
and also provides the media exchanged between the two parties in the call. MC
service server B and MC service server A share the relevant information for
this to take place.
\- When the private call completes, the call completion is also conveyed to MC
service client A.
NOTE 1: The scenario is the same whether MC user C, the other party in the
private call, is receiving MC service from MC service server A or MC service
server B.
NOTE 2: The scenario does not imply any requirement for media routing, whether
MC user C receives service from MC service server A or MC service server B.
NOTE 3: The scenario also applies to emergency private calls.
## 4.3 Scenario 2: Discreet listening of MCPTT and MCVideo group calls
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for communications involving MC user B where MC service user B is
within the authority of authorized MC user A, where MC user A and MC user B
have the same primary MC service server, MC service server A. MC user B is a
member of MC service group X together with MC users C to N, and therefore the
communications in MC service group X are to be provided to MC user A. The
primary MC service server of MC service group X is also MC service server A.
The scenario is illustrated in figure 4.3.1-1 below.
Figure 4.3.1-1: Discreet listening of MCPTT or MCVideo group call
The scenario consists of the following aspects:
\- Authorized MC user A identifies MC user B as the target for discreet
listening, and the request for discreet listening is sent by MC service client
A to MC service server A, which verifies that MC user A is authorized to
perform discreet listening on MC user B. This aspect takes place before any
communications involving MC user B can be subject to discreet listening.
\- MC service server A identifies MC user B as a member of MC service group X
\- A group member in MC service group X (one of MC users B or C to N) makes an
MCPTT or MCVideo group call.
\- MC service server A provides MC service client A with information
concerning the initiation of the call, including the identity of the calling
MC user, and also provides the media exchanged throughout the group call.
\- When the group call completes, the call completion is also conveyed to MC
service client A.
NOTE 1: The scenario does not determine whether authorized MC user A is a
member of MC service group X or not.
NOTE 2: The scenario also applies to other variants of group call, such as
emergency group call, imminent peril group call, broadcast group call and
calls to temporary groups where MC user B is a group member.
NOTE 3: If any of MC users B or C to N is receiving MC service from a
different MC service server from authorized MC user A, or if the group host MC
service server is different from the MC service server serving authorized MC
user A, the scenario is similar to that described in subclause 4.2.2 for
private call with different MC service servers.
## 4.4 Scenario 3: Discreet listening of MCVideo pull
### 4.4.1 Scenario 3.1: Discreet listening of one to one MCVideo pull
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for MC user B where MC user B is within the authority of authorized
MC user A, and authorized MC user A receives MCVideo pulls where MC user B is
the initiator of the MCVideo pull request to a third MC user, or is the
recipient of an MCVideo pull request from a third MC user and so provides
video as a result of this request. As a one to one MCVideo pull is
procedurally identical to an MCVideo private call, the scenarios are the same
as those described within the present document in subclause 4.2.1 for MCVideo
private call within a single MC service server, and in subclause 4.2.2 where
the authorized MC user and target MC user are receiving service from different
MC service servers.
### 4.4.2 Scenario 3.2: Discreet listening of one from server MCVideo pull
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for MC user B where MC user B is within the authority of authorized
MC user A, and where authorized MC user A receives MCVideo pulls from the
MCVideo server initiated by MC user B. In figure 4.4.2-1 below, MC user A and
MC user B have the same primary MCVideo server, MCVideo server A.
Figure 4.4.2-1: Discreet listening of MCVideo pull from server
The scenario consists of the following aspects:
\- Authorized MC user A identifies MC user B as the target for discreet
listening, and the request for discreet listening is sent by MC service client
A to MCVideo server A. This aspect takes place before any communications
involving MC user B can be subject to discreet listening.
\- MC user B initiates an MCVideo pull from the MCVideo server.
\- MCVideo server A provides MC service client A with information concerning
the initiation of the MCVideo pull, and provides the MCVideo media sent from
the MCVideo server to MC user B.
NOTE 1: An alternative would be to notify authorized MC user A when MC user B
requests to make an MCVideo pull, and allow MC user A to decide whether to
receive the video media.
NOTE 2: Authorized MC user A may receive separate notifications when the
MCVideo pull is initiated, and when the MCVideo is provided.
NOTE 3: The provision of MCVideo media to authorized MC user A may be in real
time, or on demand with intermediate storage in the MCVideo server.
If MC user B receives MC service from a different MCVideo server, MCVideo
server A will request the discreet listening function from the serving MCVideo
server of MC user B.
## 4.5 Scenario 4: Discreet listening of MCVideo push
### 4.5.1 Scenario 4.1: Discreet listening of one to one MCVideo push
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for MC user B where MC user B is within the authority of authorized
MC user A, and authorized MC user A receives MCVideo pushes initiated or
received by MC user B. As a one to one MCVideo push is procedurally identical
to an MCVideo private call, the scenarios are the same as those described
within the present document in subclause 4.2.1 for MCVideo private call within
a single MC service server, and in subclause 4.2.2 where the authorized MC
user and target MC user are receiving service from different MC service
servers.
### 4.5.2 Scenario 4.2: Discreet listening of one to server MCVideo push
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for MC user B where MC user B is within the authority of authorized
MC user A, and where authorized MC user A receives MCVideo pushes to the
MCVideo server that have been initiated by MC user B. In figure 4.5.2-1 below,
MC user A and MC user B have the same primary MCVideo server, MCVideo server
A.
Figure 4.5.2-1: Discreet listening of MCVideo push to server
The scenario consists of the following aspects:
\- Authorized MC user A identifies MC user B as the target for discreet
listening, and the request for discreet listening is sent by MC service client
A to MCVideo server A. This aspect takes place before any communications
involving MC user B can be subject to discreet listening.
\- MC user B initiates an MCVideo push to the MCVideo server.
\- MCVideo server A provides MC service client A with information concerning
the initiation of the MCVideo push, and provides the MCVideo media sent from
MC user B to the MCVideo server.
NOTE 1: An alternative would be to notify authorized MC user A when MC user B
requests to make an MCVideo push, and allow MC user A to decide whether to
receive the video media.
NOTE 2: Authorized MC user A may receive separate notifications when the
MCVideo push is initiated, and when the MCVideo is provided.
NOTE 3: The provision of MCVideo media to authorized MC user A may be in real
time, or on demand with intermediate storage in the MCVideo server. This
aspect may need an additional requirement on media storage server.
If MC user B receives MC service from a different MCVideo server, MCVideo
server A will request the discreet listening function from the serving MCVideo
server of MC user B.
### 4.5.3 Scenario 4.3: Discreet listening of remotely initiated MCVideo push
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for communications involving MC user B where MC user B is within the
authority of authorized MC user A, and where MC user C causes a remotely
initiated MCVideo push from MC user B to MC user D. The scenario is
illustrated in figure 4.5.3-1 below.
Figure 4.5.3-1: Discreet listening of remotely initiated MCVideo push
The scenario consists of the following aspects:
\- Authorized MC user A identifies MC user B as the target for discreet
listening, and the request for discreet listening is sent by MC service client
A to MCVideo server A. This aspect takes place before any communications
involving MC user B can be subject to discreet listening.
\- MC user C initiates a remotely initiated MCVideo push procedure, wherein MC
user B pushes video to MC user D.
\- MCVideo server A provides MC service client A with information concerning
the initiation of the MCVideo push including the identities of MC users C and
D, and provides the MCVideo media sent from MC user B to MC user D.
NOTE 1: An alternative would be to notify authorized MC user A when MC user B
initiates the MCVideo push, and to allow MC user A to decide whether to
receive the video media.
NOTE 2: Authorized MC user A may receive separate notifications when the
MCVideo pull is initiated, and when the MCVideo is provided.
NOTE 3: The provision of MCVideo media to authorized MC user A may be in real
time, or on demand with intermediate storage in the MCVideo server. This
aspect may need an additional requirement on media storage server.
NOTE 4: The scenario is the same where MC user C causes MC user D to push
MCVideo media towards MC user B; MCVideo server A also sends the pushed video
from MC user D to authorized MC user A.
If MC user B receives MC service from a different MCVideo server, MCVideo
server A will request the discreet listening function from the serving MCVideo
server of MC user B.
## 4.6 Scenario 5: Discreet listening of MCData SDS
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for communications involving MC user B where MC user B is within the
authority of authorized MC user A, and where MC user A and MC user B have the
same primary MCData server. The scenario is illustrated in figure 4.6.1-1
below.
Figure 4.6.1-1: Discreet listening of one to one MCData SDS
The scenario consists of the following aspects:
\- Authorized MC user A identifies MC user B as the target for discreet
listening, and the request for discreet listening is sent by MC service client
A to MCData server A. This aspect takes place before any communications
involving MC user B can be subject to discreet listening.
\- MC user B sends or receives an MCData SDS data request to or from MC user
C.
\- MCData server A provides MC service client A with the MCData SDS data
request, including relevant information such as conversation identifier and
transaction identifier.
\- If the recipient sends one or more disposition notifications, these are
also sent to MC user A.
NOTE 1: The scenario applies whether the data is sent over the signalling
plane or the media plane.
NOTE 2: The scenario applies whether the data is sent in standalone
transactions, or as part of a session.
NOTE 3: The use applies to enhanced status sent over SDS.
NOTE 4: If authorized MC user A is receiving MC service from a different
MCData server to that of MC user B, the serving MCData server of MC user A
communicates with the serving MCData server of MC user B to provide the
discreet listening service. This is similar to the case of MCPTT and MCVideo
private calls described in subclause 4.2.2.
NOTE 5: If MC user B is sending or receiving SDS within a group, the scenario
is similar to that described in subclause 4.3 for MCPTT and MCVideo group
call.
## 4.7 Scenario 6: Discreet listening of MCData file distribution
### 4.7.1 Scenario 6.1: Discreet listening of file upload and file download
This scenario is similar to those for MCVideo push and MCVideo pull from
server described in subclauses 4.4.2 and 4.5.2 of the present document.
### 4.7.2 Scenario 6.2: Discreet listening of one to one file distribution
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for communications involving MC user B where MC user B is within the
authority of authorized MC user A, and where MC user A and MC user B have the
same primary MCData server. The scenario is the same whether the file is
distributed over HTTP or over the media plane. The scenario is illustrated in
figure 4.7.2-1 below.
Figure 4.7.2-1: Discreet listening of one to one MCData file distribution
The scenario consists of the following aspects:
\- Authorized MC user A identifies MC user B as the target for discreet
listening, and the request for discreet listening is sent by MC service client
A to MCData server A. This aspect takes place before any communications
involving MC user B can be subject to discreet listening.
\- MC user B sends or receives an MCData file distribution request to or from
MC user C.
\- MC service server A provides MC service client A with the transferred file,
including relevant information such as the identity of MC user C, the
conversation identifier and transaction identifier.
\- The MCData download completed report is also sent to MC service client A.
NOTE 1: The scenario applies whether the file is sent over HTTP or the media
plane.
NOTE 2: Authorized MC user A may receive separate notifications when the
MCData file transfer is initiated, and when the MCData file is provided.
NOTE 3: The provision of the MCData file to authorized MC user A may be in
real time, or on demand with intermediate storage in the MCData server.
NOTE 4: If authorized MC user A is receiving MC service on a different MCData
server to that of MC user B, the serving MCData server of MC user A
communicates with the serving MCData server of MC user B to provide the
discreet listening service. This is similar to the case of MCPTT and MCVideo
private calls described in subclause 4.2.2.
## 4.8 Scenario 7: Logging scenarios
### 4.8.1 General
According to the requirements for logging in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] and 3GPP TS
22.281 [3] which are also reproduced in Annex A of the present document,
mechanisms are to be provided to log both media and metadata for call related
and call unrelated activity of the target MC service users and MC service
groups.
The call related scenarios can be considered to be the same as those described
in scenarios 1 to 6 related to discreet listening, except that the recipient
of the information is a logging client or interface instead of the authorized
user.
## 4.9 Scenario 8: Limitations on discreet listening due to regulatory
constraints and operator security policies
### 4.9.1 Scenario 8.1: Private communication transmissions
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for communications involving MC user B where MC user B is within the
authority of authorized MC user A. MC user C can be, but does not have to be
within the authority of the authorized MC user A. The MC user C is not the
target of the discreet listening request executed by the authorized MC user A.
The scenario would allow MC user A to be part of the communication coming from
MC user B, but not the communication coming from MC user C. The scenario is
illustrated in figure 4.9.1-1 below.
Figure 4.9.1-1: Discreet listening with regulatory constraints on private
communication transmissions
NOTE 1: As the communication originated from MC user C is restricted,
authorized user A is not able to receive the full context of the
communications from MC user B which may limit the usefulness of the discreet
listening of user B.
NOTE 2: As authorized user A will know that user B and user C are
communicating, and able to receive all conversation from user B, the security
of user C is not preserved in this scenario.
### 4.9.2 Scenario 8.2: Group communication transmissions
This scenario describes the case where authorized MC user A requests discreet
listening for a set of users being part of group communications involving MC
user B to MC user D where MC user B to MC user D are within the authority of
authorized MC user A. All other participants on these group communications
can, but do not have to be within the authority of the authorized MC user A.
The scenario would allow MC user A to be part of the communications coming
from MC user B to MC user D, but not the communication coming from MC user E.
The scenario is illustrated in figure 4.9.2-1 below.
Figure 4.9.2-1: Discreet listening with regulatory constraints on users being
part of group communication transmissions
The scenario consists of the following aspect:
\- Authorized MC user A is requesting group communication transmissions by
identifying the target users being part of group communications.
NOTE 1: As the communication originated from MC user E is restricted,
authorized user A is not able to receive the full context of the
communications in the rest of the group which may limit the discreet listening
service capability.
NOTE 2: As authorized user A will know that the other group members are
communicating with user E, and able to receive all conversation from the rest
of the group, the security of user E is not preserved in this scenario.
# 5 Key Issues
## 5.1 Key Issue 1: Selection of MC service for discreet listening
The single requirement for discreet listening [R-6.15.1-001] provided in 3GPP
TS 23.280 [2] and reproduced in Annex A of the present document requires that
all group or private communication transmissions from the target MC user are
to be subject to discreet listening by an authorized MC user.
In practice, selection at the MC service level will automatically take place,
as the MC service clients for each MC service will be used to place the
discreet listening requests on behalf of the authorized MC user, for example
if the authorized MC user only places the discreet listening request using an
MCPTT client, only MCPTT transmissions will be available to the authorized MC
user.
Within each of the MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData services, there are a number of
separate services available and it is not clear whether the authorized MC user
would wish to automatically receive content involving the target MC user
within these separate services; for example whether the authorized MC user
would require to receive MCData SDS transmissions but not MCData file upload
and downloads.
NOTE: It is assumed that when discreet listening is invoked by the authorized
MC user, the authorized MC user is provided with communications transmitted by
the target MC user, and communications received by the target MC user.
Issues:
\- Whether there should be granularity of discreet listening within each MC
service, or whether all services within each MC service should always be
provided to the authorized MC user following a request for discreet listening
of a target MC user within an MC service.
## 5.2 Key issue 2: Group membership of authorized MC user for discreet
listening
The target of discreet listening may be a member of an MC service group, and
be able to take part in group communications. The authorized MC user will
expect to receive all MC service group communication transmissions involving
the target MC user, however the authorized MC user might not be defined as an
MC service group member of the MC service group in which the target MC user is
communicating.
Issues:
\- Whether the authorized MC user should be a pre-defined member of an MC
service group in order to receive group communications in which the target MC
user is involved.
\- Whether the authorized MC user should be temporarily made an MC service
group member in order to receive group communications in which the target MC
user is involved.
\- Whether, if the authorized MC user is not an MC service group member, there
should be any restriction on the communications involving the target MC user
that are provided to the authorized MC user, e.g. provision of the target\'s
transmissions to the MC service group, but not transmissions of other MC
service group members.
\- Whether any restrictions on requiring MC service group membership are
different when the MC service group is defined in a different primary MC
system to that of the authorized MC user.
\- If the authorized MC user affiliates to the MC service group in order to
receive the media in group communications, the affiliation of the authorized
MC user to the MC service group may be visible to the target MC user and to
other members of the MC service group; and the stage 1 requirement is that
discreet listening takes place without the knowledge of the target MC user.
\- How the authorized MC user is able to recover the content of communications
within the group that are protected by end to end encryption.
Editor\'s note: Membership of a group homed in an interworked system is FFS.
## 5.3 Key issue 3: Discreet listening for MCVideo push and pull and MCData
file upload and download
The MCVideo video push and video pull services each start with a negotiation
phase, where information related to the video content to be pushed or pulled
such as URL, media characteristics etc is provided and agreed. The MC user can
be notified and asked to accept incoming video within a video push.
Similarly, the MCData file upload and file download services each start with a
negotiation phase where information related to the file transfer such as URL
is provided and agreed. The MC user can be notified and asked whether to
accept an incoming file transfer.
The discreet listening service could either allow the authorized MC user who
is the recipient of the information to accept video or data before that video
or data is sent to the authorized MC user, or could be provided with the video
or data sent to or from the target MC user of the discreet listening service
automatically.
Issues:
\- Whether the authorized MC user should be notified about the start of video
push and pull or file upload or download transactions involving the MC user
who is the target of discreet listening and given the choice to accept and
receive the information or reject receiving the information; or whether the
authorized MC user should always receive the information without any choice
being needed.
\- Whether the authorized MC user should receive notification both when the
file upload or download negotiation phase takes place, and a second
notification when the file upload or download takes place.
\- Whether the authorized MC user should automatically be presented with the
file date if a mandatory download takes place to the target MC user
\- Whether the file content should be saved by the MCData server (or another
suitable entity) until the authorized MC user decides to retrieve the file,
and if so, whether there should be a time limit on this storage.
## 5.4 Key issue 4: Discreet listening of end to end encrypted calls
An authorized user may perform discreet listening on end to end encrypted
communications, where those communications can be private calls, individual
communications with a server (e.g. pull from or push to a server), and group
calls where the target of the discreet listening is engaged in group
communications. In order to comprehend the communications, the authorized
user\'s MC service client needs to be provided with the end to end encryption
key used to encrypt the content of the call.
NOTE: This key issue assumes that the decryption process is located in the
authorized user\'s MC service client, to avoid violating the stage 1
requirement [R-5.12-009] in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] for end to end encryption of
media traffic.
For private or individual communications, a session key is used to encrypt the
content of the communications, which is protected in transfer between the call
participants by an encryption process making use of the identity of the
destination party. The mechanism is described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [6].
For group communications, a GMK is originated by the GMS and protected in
transfer to group members one at a time by an encryption process making use of
the identity of each group member. The mechanism is described in 3GPP TS
33.180 [6].
According to the requirement in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] and reproduced in Annex A
of the present document, the participants in the call will not be aware of the
discreet listening.
Issues:
\- In order to successfully discreet listen to private or individual
communications without violating the requirement for end to end encryption,
the authorized user\'s MC service client needs access to the session key
exchanged between the parties in the private or individual communication. To
fulfil the requirement reproduced in Annex A.1, the parties in the call will
not have knowledge of the authorized user possessing the encryption key.
\- In order to successfully discreet listen to group communications without
violating the requirement for end to end encryption, the authorized user\'s MC
service client needs access to the GMK for the group. To fulfil the
requirement reproduced in Annex A.1, the group members in the call will not
have knowledge of the authorized user possessing the encryption key.
## 5.5 Key issue 5: Logging and replay of end to end encrypted calls
A logging entity requires to be able to record the content of end to end
encrypted private calls, individual communications with a server (e.g. pull
from or push to a server) and group calls. In order to permit replay of the
content of the recorded calls, the encryption key must be available to provide
decryption at some point in the process, either during recording, at some time
during storage subsequent to recording, or on playback.
Issues:
\- Whether the content should be decrypted at the point of recording, at some
time during storage, or at the time of playback of the recorded material.
\- How the entity performing the decryption obtains the encryption key to
enable the decryption of the media content.
## 5.6 Key issue 6: Source MC service server for discreet listening of user in
group call
An authorized user may perform discreet listening on an MC service user, where
that MC service user is taking part in group communications. The primary MC
service server of that MC service group may be a different MC service server
to the primary MC service server of the target MC service user.
Issues:
\- Which MC service server should provide the content of group call
communications in which the target user takes part: the primary MC service
server of the target user or the primary MC service server of the MC service
group.
\- How the solution prevents the discreet listening service being apparent to
the target MC service user, or to other MC service group members.
## 5.7 Key issue 7: Discreet listening and logging for interconnected MC
system
An authorized user may attempt to perform discreet listening on an MC service
user that has a different primary MC system to that of the authorized user,
where that target MC service user is taking part in private communications, or
in group communications where the MC service group also has a different
primary MC system to that of the authorized user. This could raise concerns
about eavesdropping on communications in another security domain. The group
case is illustrated in figure 5.7-1 below.
Figure 5.7-1: Discreet listening for a group entirely in a partner MC system
However, if MC service users in an MC system join an MC service group where
that group has a different primary MC system which is connected by
interconnection, it is likely that the MC system providing service for those
MC service group members would wish to log communications within that group,
and likely that an authorized user within that MC system may wish to perform
discreet listening on group members who are receiving service in the same MC
system as that authorized user. This is illustrated in figure 5.7-2 below.
Figure 5.7-2: Discreet listening or logging for group with group members in
discreet listening /logging system
Issues:
\- Discreet listening of individual or group communications may need to be
restricted to target MC service users with the same primary MC system as the
authorized user for discreet listening.
\- Logging of individual or group communications may need to be restricted to
target MC service users or groups which are receiving service in the same
primary MC system as the logging entity.
\- If discreet listening or logging of individual communications is permitted
where the target is receiving service in an interconnected MC system, both the
MC system where the target is receiving service and the MC system where the
request for discreet listening or logging originates may need to authorize the
discreet listening or logging service.
## 5.8 Key issue 8: Discreet listening and logging for migrated MC service
user
An MC service user that has migrated to another MC system receives MC service
within the security domain of that MC system.
Issues:
\- The primary MC system of the MC service user and the migrated MC system of
the MC service user may both wish to authorize discreet listening and/or
logging of the migrated MC service user by the primary MC system of that
migrated MC service user.
\- The primary MC system of the migrated MC service users and the migrated MC
system of the migrated MC service user may both wish to authorize any logging
or discreet listening of the migrated MC service user by the migrated MC
system.
\- There may be a need to restrict the provided content of communications to
that which is originated by the migrated MC service user, and not to provide
content which originates from other users receiving service within the
migrated MC system.
\- There may be a need to restrict metadata relating to the communications to
hide the identities and other information relating to MC service users and MC
service groups whose primary MC system is the migrated MC system of the MC
service user who is the target of the discreet listening or logging.
## 5.9 Key Issue 9: Discreet listening and logging for user receiving MC
service on multiple devices
An MC service user may be service authorized on multiple MC service UEs, and
may be receiving the same or different MC services on each of these. It is
possible that an MC service user will receive the same communications content
on more than one device simultaneously. Both the discreet listening and the
logging services target a specific MC service user, and therefore both
services will expect to obtain the content of communications and relevant
communication related information whichever device the MC service user makes
use of.
Issues:
\- Whether there is any need to identify the MC service UE that was used for
each communication, and how such identification of the relevant MC service UE
is possible.
\- Whether there is any need to capture or to remove duplicated content of the
MC service user receives the same communications content on more than one MC
service UE.
## 5.10 Key Issue 10: Logging of MC service users and MC service groups
An entity is required to perform logging of the communications and
communications related information of MC service users and MC service groups.
Issues:
\- Whether an existing functional entity such as an MC service client can
provide the logging function, or whether a new functional entity is required.
\- Whether new reference points are needed to support logging.
\- Whether there are any explicit protocol transactions and procedures needed
to support logging.
\- The configuration needed to support logging.
\- Whether the logging entity is considered a group member, and whether it
requires affiliation to an MC service group, in order to log group
communications.
\- Whether any aspect of the replay equipment needed to replay recorded
communications is in scope of standardization
## 5.11 Key Issue 11: Logging of MCData content server and message store
services
An MCData user may make use of a content server for upload and download of
MCData content. An MCData user may also have the use of a message store where
content of MCData transactions can be stored for later retrieval. Logging of
information stored on the content server or message store could be achieved by
storage capabilities of those entities, or could be achieved using a separate
MC logging function.
Issues:
\- Whether logging of transactions to and from an MCData content server is
required.
\- Whether logging of transactions to and from a message store is required.
\- Whether logging of transactions which involve a content server or a message
store can be satisfied by the content server or message store providing
logging as an intrinsic function without the need for separate MC logging
function.
\- If a separate MC logging function is required to log transactions to and
from a message store or content server, which additional reference points are
needed to fulfil the functionality.
## 5.12 Key Issue 12: Discreet listening of MCData content server and message
store services
An MCData user may make use of a content server for upload and download of
MCData content. An MCData user may also have the use of a message store where
content of MCData transactions can be stored for later retrieval. An
authorized user may require discreet listening of transactions between the
MCData user and the the content server or message store. If provided, the
authorized user may need access to the content of information exchanged, or
may require notification that the information is being exchanged without
needing the content.
Issues:
\- Whether discreet listening of transactions to and from an MCData content
server is required.
\- Whether discreet listening of transactions to and from a message store is
required.
\- Whether discreet listening requires notification that transactions are
taking place without providing the content, or whether the content itself is
also needed.
\- Whether the content of transactions needs to follow the same path as
notification of the transactions, if both notification and content are
required, or whether content can be accessible by the authorized user directly
from the message store or content server.
\- Whether activation of discreet listening against a target user also gives
the authorized user access to previous transactions to or from the target user
which have been stored in a content server or message store, or whether access
is only possible to transactions in progress.
\- Whether activation of discreet listening to a group gives access to
transactions (e.g. for group SDS) which have been exchanged prior to that
activation.
\- Whether discreet listening allows the authorized user to receive
synchronization between the message store client of an MCData user and a
message store, for example when the MCData client uploads transactions that
took place whilst operating in off-network mode.
\- Whether discreet listening allows the authorized user access to data
content which an MCData user has created and stored in a message store,
without that content being sent to or received from another MCData user.
## 5.13 Key issue 13: Discreet listening towards an MC service group
The target of discreet listening can be an MC service group specified by the
authorized user. The authorized user receives all the group communications of
this target group in a real time manner.
The authorized user (listener) can be within the primary MC system of the
target group, or can be in a partner MC system of the target group.
The following aspects need to be further studied to support group based
discreet listening:
\- Procedures and information flows based on the reuse of existing solutions;
\- Configurations that are needed for the authorizations for discreet
listening.
## 5.14 Key Issue 14: Limitations on discreet listening due to regulatory
constraints and operator security policies
An authorized MC user has requested discreet listening either on one MC user
or a group of MC users. Regulatory constraints and operator security policies
can require specifying the exact communication transmissions that are allowed
to be part of the discreet listening service, which would result in
limitations on discreet listening on all parties in the communication. The
communication transmissions from a single target user as well as target users
within a group can listened to by the authorized user while leaving everything
else out of scope of the requested discreet listening. The regulatory
constraints and operator security policies can have impact on all types of
communication transmissions and is therefore mission critical service
independent.
Issues:
\- How only the communication transmissions coming from the target MC user
involved in a private communication can be part of discreet listening.
\- How only the communication transmissions coming from one target MC user or
a group of target MC users involved in a group communication can be part of
discreet listening.
\- How any other communication transmissions are made unavailable to the
authorized MC user, as they are not part of discreet listening requests.
\- Whether any of the communication related signalling should be restricted.
NOTE: There may be security issues relating to the users that are outside the
scope of the discreet listening, as the fact that communications are taking
place, and the contents of those communications sent to those users is
available to the authorized user.
# 6 Solutions
## 6.1 Solution 1: Functionality for discreet listening
### 6.1.1 Description
#### 6.1.1.1 Functional model
Discreet listening is carried out by an authorized user, who requests discreet
listening for the communications of another user. The authorized user will
require a client entity capable of fulfilling the discreet listening request.
The functionality required is the same as that of an MC service client, with
the addition of the capability to request discreet listening and specify a
target MC service user. Therefore the solution is to reuse the MC service
client, and make no additions to the functional model.
This solution addresses aspects of key issue 1, Selection of MC service for
discreet listening, and key issue 2, Group membership of authorized user for
discreet listening.
#### 6.1.1.2 Configuration
The user profiles for MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData which are specified in 3GPP TS
23.379 [7], 3GPP TS 23.281 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.282 [9] will need additional
configuration to be added as shown in Table 6.1.1.2-1 below.
Table 6.1.1.2-1: Addition to MC service user profiles (on network)
* * *
Reference Parameter description MCPTT UE MCPTT Server Configuration management
server MCPTT user database Authorized to perform discreet listening on another
MC service user Y Y Y Y List of users upon whom discreet listening can be
invoked  
> MC service ID Y Y Y Y
* * *
In Table 6.1.1.2-1 \'MC service\' represents one of MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData.
#### 6.1.1.3 Procedures
##### 6.1.1.3.1 General
New procedures are added to allow the MC service client of the authorized user
to invoke and revoke discreet listening of a target MC user, and to allow the
MC service server to provide the content of calls in which the target user is
involved.
##### 6.1.1.3.2 Discreet listening invocation and revocation procedures
The procedure allows the MC service client of the authorized user to request
discreet listening of a target MC service user. The procedure is illustrated
in figure 6.1.1.3.2-1 below.
Figure 6.1.1.3.2-1: Discreet listening invocation
The information flows needed to support such a procedure are shown in tables
6.1.1.3.2-1 and 6.1.1.3.2-2 below.
Table 6.1.1.3.2-1: Discreet listening activation request
* * *
Information element Status Description MC service ID M MC service ID of the
target of the discreet listening request
* * *
Table 6.1.1.3.2-2: Discreet listening activation response
* * *
Information element Status Description MC service ID M MC service ID of the
target of the discreet listening request Result M Indicates the success or
failure of the discreet listening request
* * *
Invocation of discreet listening of a target MC service user will result in
all communications sent or received to any MC service client on which the
target MC service user is receiving MC service being provided to the
authorized user.
A similar procedure, not illustrated here, is required for revocation of the
discreet listening function.
##### 6.1.1.3.3 Provision of discreet listening content for private
communications
When the target user makes or receives a private call or initiates individual
communications with a server, the authorized user needs to be informed and
provided with the media. Figure 6.1.1.3.3-1 below illustrates a procedure
where discreet listening target MC service client 1 sets up a call.
Figure 6.1.1.3.3-1: Discreet listening of target initiated private call
The procedure is similar if the target of the discreet listening is the
recipient of the private call.
If the target initiated the private call, the discreet listening call request
may include the client ID associated with the MC service client on which the
target initiates the call. If the target receives a request for a private
call, the discreet listening call request may include the client ID(s) of the
MC service clients on which the private call request is received.
NOTE: If the MC service server does not receive the \'discreet listening call
response\' for any reason, the call should still proceed so that the
requirement that the call is not affected and the target user is not aware of
the discreet listening process is satisfied.
##### 6.1.1.3.4 Provision of discreet listening content for group
communications
When the target user makes or receives a group call, the authorized user needs
to be informed and provided with the media. Figure 6.1.1.3.4-1 below
illustrates a procedure where discreet listening target MC service client 2 is
a receiving party in a group call initiated by another affiliated group
member.
Figure 6.1.1.3.4-1: Discreet listening of target initiated group call
If the target initiated the group call, the discreet listening call request
may include the client ID associated with the MC service client on which the
target initiates the call. If the target receives a request for a group call,
the discreet listening call request may include the client ID(s) of the MC
service clients on which the group call request is received.
The procedure is similar if the target of the discreet listening is the
initiator of the group call.
NOTE 1: If the MC service server does not receive the \'discreet listening
call response\' for any reason, the call should still proceed so that the
requirement that the call is not affected and the target user is not aware of
the discreet listening process is satisfied.
NOTE 2: It is irrelevant whether the authorized user is or is not a member of
the MC service group.
##### 6.1.1.3.5 Information flows for discreet listening
A single pair of information flows can support provision of discreet listening
content of individual communications and group communications. Suitable
information elements are shown in tables 6.1.1.3.5-1 and 6.1.1.3.5-2 below.
Table 6.1.1.3.5-1: Discreet listening call request
+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | Information element | Status | Description | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | MC service ID | M | MC service ID of the target | | | | of discreet listening | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | MC service client ID list | O | List of MC service client | | | | IDs of the target user on | | (see NOTE) | | which the call is requested | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | MC service ID | M | MC service ID of the other | | | | party in individual call, | | | | or MC service ID of talking | | | | party in group call | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | Call direction | M | Indicates whether the | | | | target or another party | | | | initiated the call | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | Call type | M | Indicates the type of | | | | communication (private | | | | call, group call etc) | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | MC service group ID | O | Provided if the | | | | communication is a group | | | | call | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | NOTE: MC service client ID | | | | identifies a specific | | | | installation of an MC | | | | service client on an MC | | | | service UE and is provided | | | | to the MC service server at | | | | service authorization of | | | | the MC service user.

### 6.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
This solution results in the following impacts on existing entities and
reference points:
\- MC service clients and MC service-1 reference points: addition of
functionality to request discreet listening and to specify a target MC user.
\- MC service user configuration: authorization to request discreet listening
on a list of target MC service IDs.
\- A new procedure to request discreet listening specifying a target MC
service user.
\- A new procedure to provide the content of discreet listening.
In each case, MC service is one of MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData.
### 6.1.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution allows discreet listening to be achieved with minimal changes to
the functional model as it only requires enhancement to existing functional
entities and reference points. It also allows discreet listening to be invoked
on a service dependent basis as it is achieved as a function of the MC service
specific MC service clients. It supports the situations where the MC service
user is receiving MC service on multiple MC service clients.
## 6.2 Solution 2: Discreet listening of MCVideo push and pull
### 6.2.1 Description
#### 6.2.1.1 Overview
This solution addresses the MCVideo aspects of key issue 3 for discreet
listening of MCVideo push and pull.
#### 6.2.1.2 Invocation
Discreet listening is activated by the MC service client of the authorized
user according to the invocation procedures described in subclause 6.1.1.3.2
of the present document.
#### 6.2.1.3 MCVideo push discreet listening procedure
The procedure for discreet listening of a one to server push is shown in
figure 6.2.1.3-1 below.
Figure 6.2.1.3-1: MCVideo push to server discreet listening
Steps 1 to 7 are described in 3GPP TS 23.281 [3] subclause 7.4.2.4, the
procedure for one to server video push. Additional steps to support discreet
listening are as follow:
11\. The MCVideo server notifies MCVideo client 2 of the authorized user that
MCVideo client 1 has been authorized to push video to the MCVideo server. The
notification includes the MCVideo ID of the MCVideo user and may include an
MCVideo client ID of the MCVideo client from which the request to push video
to the server was made. This step may take place at any time following step 2.
12\. The authorized user is notified and decides whether to receive the
MCVideo stream, or whether to just remain aware that an MCVideo push is taking
place from the target MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1.
13\. MCVideo client 2 provides the response to the MCVideo server, indicating
whether the authorized user wishes to receive the video stream or not.
NOTE: Steps 12 and 13 may utilise an automatic process, such that a human user
does not need to make a decision at the time that the video stream push
commences.
If the authorized user decides to receive the video stream, steps 14 and 15
establish the media plane and transmission control, and transmit the video to
the authorized user. Steps 16 and 17 complete the transaction.
If step 14 is completed before step 5 occurs, i.e. the media plane is set up
to the authorized user but video streaming has not commenced from MCVideo
client 1, the video stream sent to MCVideo client 2 of the authorized user in
step 15 does not start until the stream in step 5 is received by the MCVideo
server.
If step 14 has not completed before step 5 occurs, i.e. the MCVideo stream
from MCVideo client 1 has commenced before the media plane is setup between
the MCVideo server and MCVideo client 2 of the authorized user, the video
stream in step 15 is either delayed so that the authorized user is able to
view the stream from its commencement, or the stream is not delayed and so the
authorized user receives the stream in real time, but does not receive the
start of the video stream.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the decision to delay or to truncate the
start of the video stream sent to the authorized user is determined by
configuration or by some other mechanism.
The same procedure can be followed between the MCVideo server and MCVideo
client 2 of the authorized user where the MCVideo push is remotely initiated
as described in subclause 7.4.2.5 of 3GPP TS 23.281 [3], and where the MCVideo
push is sent to a group as described in subclause 7.4.2.6 of 3GPP TS 23.281
[3].
#### 6.2.1.4 MCVideo pull discreet listening procedure
The procedure for discreet listening of a one from server pull is shown in
figure 6.2.1.4-1 below.
Figure 6.2.1.4-1: MCVideo pull from server discreet listening
Steps 1 to 7 are described in 3GPP TS 23.281 [3] subclause 7.3.2.4, the
procedure for one from server video pull. Additional steps to support discreet
listening are as follow:
11\. The MCVideo server notifies MCVideo client 2 of the authorized user that
MCVideo client 1 has been authorized to pull video from the MCVideo server.
The notification includes the MCVideo ID of the MCVideo user and may include
an MCVideo client ID of the MCVideo client from which the request to pull
video from the server was made. This step may take place at any time following
step 2.
12\. The authorized user is notified and decides whether to receive the
MCVideo stream, or whether to just remain aware that an MCVideo pull is taking
place to the target MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1.
13\. MCVideo client 2 provides the response to the MCVideo server, indicating
whether the authorized user wishes to receive the video stream or not.
NOTE: Steps 12 and 13 may utilise an automatic process, such that a human user
does not need to make a decision at the time that the video stream pull
commences.
If the authorized user decides to receive the video stream, steps 14 and 15
establish the media plane and transmission control, and transmit the video to
the authorized user. Steps 16 and 17 complete the transaction.
If step 14 is completed before step 5 occurs, i.e. the media plane is set up
to the authorized user but video streaming has not commenced from the MCVideo
server, the video stream sent to MCVideo client 2 of the authorized user in
step 15 does not start until the stream in step 5 starts streaming from the
MCVideo server.
If step 14 has not completed before step 5 occurs, i.e. the MCVideo stream
from the MCVideo server has commenced before the media plane is setup between
the MCVideo server and MCVideo client 2 of the authorized user, the video
stream in step 15 is either delayed so that the authorized user is able to
view the stream from its commencement, or the stream is not delayed and so the
authorized user receives the stream in real time, but does not receive the
start of the video stream.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the decision to delay or to truncate the
start of the video stream sent to the authorized user is determined by
configuration or by some other mechanism.
#### 6.2.1.5 Information flows for discreet listening of MCVideo push and pull
A single pair of information flows can support the request and response for
discreet listening of MCVideo push and pull video transfers. Suitable
information elements are shown in tables 6.2.1.5-1 and 6.2.1.5-2 below.
Table 6.2.1.5-1: MCVideo push-pull discreet listening request

communication is a push to an MCVideo push NOTE: MCVideo client ID identifies
a specific installation of an MCVideo client on an MCVideo UE and is provided

### 6.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
This solution results in the following impacts on existing entities and
reference points:
\- MCVideo clients and MCVideo-1 reference points: addition of functionality
to offer and accept discreet listening MCVideo push and pull content.
\- New procedures to provide discreet listening of MCVideo push and pull
transactions.
\- New configuration parameters may be needed to determine whether the MCVideo
server truncates or caches video streams forwarded to the authorized user.
\- New configuration parameters may be needed to authorize the discreet
listening of MCVideo push and pull transactions.
### 6.2.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution allows discreet listening of MCVideo push and pull transactions
to be achieved with minimal changes to existing MCVideo functionality, as the
provision of discreet listening is based on existing MCVideo push and pull
procedures. The solution includes a means of identifying the MCVideo client
where an MCVideo user is receiving MCVideo service from multiple MCVideo
clients. Additional configuration parameters are likely to be needed to
support the service.
## 6.3 Solution 3: Functionality for on-network logging and replay
### 6.3.1 Description
#### 6.3.1.1 Functional model
To support on-network logging and replay, existing common service core
functional entities are reused. The MC logging function makes use of a new MC
logging client which has a subset of the functionality of an existing MC
service client, in that it can receive communications information and
communications content relating to logged users, but cannot set up calls or
demand to take part in calls. Provision of call related information and call
content is achieved by configuration in the MC service server. The MC logging
client uses an MC service ID to allow call related information and call
content to be routed to the MC logging client, reusing functionality from
existing reference points.
NOTE 1: An MC logging function may contain multiple MC service clients to
allow the separate services MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData to be logged within the
same function. However this is out of scope of the description of the
functional model.
Figure 6.3.1.1-1 below illustrates the functional entities and reference
points of the common services core in the application plane that are used for
logging.
Figure 6.3.1.1-1: Common services core functional model for logging
In Figure 6.3.1.1-1, the MC logging function is configured with the list of MC
service IDs and MC service groups that the logging function will log using
reference point CSC-4. The group management client receives configuration for
groups that are to be logged. The identity management client allows the
logging function to be authorized for logging service using reference point
CSC-1, using either security credentials supplied by a user or supplied by the
logging application. The key management client obtains keys using reference
point CSC-8 to protect signalling information between MC service server and MC
service client. Keys may be obtained to protect media if the solution is
intended to log communications with any end to end encryption removed.
NOTE 2: The means of protecting media and communications related information
during storage within the MC logging function is outside the scope of this
solution.
The MC replay function receives the necessary security information needed to
replay logged communications by CSC-8. A user of the replay function, or an
automatic function of the replay function, will perform the necessary
authorizations to retrieve logged communications, and CSC-1 will be used to
verify the authenticity and authorization of the user or function.
NOTE 3: Inclusion of the mechanisms for MC service user authentication and
authorization for use by the replay function within this solution allows the
user organization to require the same security processes to access logged
information as the security processes that are used to communicate within the
MC service. Alternative solutions are possible, but not considered within this
solution.
The MC logging function and MC replay function are in the same security domain
as the MC system for which communications are logged.
The interface MCLog-10 between the logging recorder and the replay client to
retrieve communications is out of scope of this solution. MCLog-10 does not
need to use 3GPP access for connectivity. Information relating to the user of
the logging replay function and any profile for this replay function user are
out of scope of this solution.
Figure 6.3.1.1-2 below shows the MC service related application plane entities
used to log communications.
Figure 6.3.1.1-2: MC service related application plane functional model for
logging
In figure 6.3.1.1-2, the MC logging function may comprise MC logging clients
dedicated to MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData. Each MC logging client is identified
by a service specific identity, namely the MCPTT ID, MCVideo ID or MCData ID
of the client. Call related information concerning the targets of logging are
sent to the MC logging function via MClog-1, which is based on the MCservice-1
reference points (i.e. MCPTT-1, MCVideo-1 etc) but does not permit calls to be
initiated by the MC logging function. Media plane communications content is
provided to the media reception function of the MC logging client via MCLog-2,
which is based on unicast media distribution reference points MC service-7
(i.e. MCPTT-7, MCVideo-7 etc), and floor control or media control information
provided during calls is provided via MCLog-3.
Editor\'s note: MCData services may require further functionality to be
described.
#### 6.3.1.2 Configuration
The MC logging equipment will require configuration to determine which MC
service users and which MC servive groups are required by that MC logging
equipment. Table 6.3.1.2-1 below illustrates the identity specific
configuration data applicable to each MC logging equipment. It is expected
that the MC logging equipment configuration will not be added into existing MC
service user configuration tables, but will have a unique configuration table.
Editor\'s note: It is expected that further configuration information will be
needed. This table is intended to contain initial information only.
Table 6.3.1.2-1: MC logging equipment configuration
* * *
Reference Parameter description MC logging equipment MC service server
Configuration management server MC service identity of MC logging client Y Y Y
List of users to be logged  
> MC service ID Y Y Y List of groups to be logged  
> MC service group ID Y Y Y
* * *
The need to log MC service group calls will require MC service group
configuration information to include the list of MC logging equipments. The
additions shown in table 6.3.1.2-2 will be made to table A.4-2 (MC service
group configuration) in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2].
Editor\'s note: Further configuration information related to logging may be
added in addition to the identities listed in table 6.3.1.2-2 below.
Table 6.3.1.2-2: Addition to common group configuration data (on network) for
logging
* * *
Reference Parameter description MC service UE MC service Server Group
management server List of logging equipments that log MCPTT calls  
>MCPTT ID Y Y List of logging equipments that log MCVideo calls  
>MCVideo ID Y Y List of logging equipments that log MCData calls  
>MCData ID Y Y
* * *
Additionally, the MC service ID for the logging equipment that is assigned to
log the communications of each MC service user will need to be added to the
user profiles for MCPTT in 3GPP TS 23.379 [7], for MCVideo in 3GPP TS 23.281
[8] and for MCData in 3GPP TS 23.282 [9].
#### 6.3.1.3 Procedures
To initialise the logging function, the MC logging equipment will perform
service authorization to each of the MC service servers following the
procedure for authentication and authorization the primary MC system specified
in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2] subclause 10.6.1.
It is not envisaged that any explicit protocol exchange will be carried out in
order to start logging communications of identified MC service users and MC
service group. Once service authorized, the MC logging equipment will be
implicitly affiliated to all its configured MC service groups. However a
procedure may be needed to show the interaction between the service
authorization of the logging equipment and the implicit authentication of the
MC logging client of the MC logging equipment to the logged MC service groups.
Procedures will need to be defined to illustrate the provision of
communications content and communications related information to the MC
logging equipment. The functionality of the reference points MCLog-1, MCLog-2
and MCLog-3 that provide this information will need to be defined, derived
from existing reference points.
The MC service server will send the MC logging equipment:
\- Notification of service authorization for each logged MC service user.
\- Notification of MC service group affiliations of each member of each logged
MC service group, and notifications of group affiliations from each logged MC
service user.
\- Notifications of call set up information for each logged MC service user
and MC service group
\- Notifications of floor control, transmission control and media control
information for each MC service user and MC service group
\- The content of each media exchange to and from each logged MC service user
and within each logged MC service group
\- Notifications of end of logged calls
Each notification will include a timestamp.
Each notification will include the identity of the MC service user being
logged, and may include an MC service client ID or list of MC service client
IDs of the MC service client(s) on which the MC service user is sending or
receiving media. Where group calls are logged, the MC service ID of the
transmitting party is included in the notification, and an MC service client
ID relating to the MC service client from which the transmission is being made
may also be included.
NOTE: The MC service client ID identifies a specific installation of an MC
service client on an MC service UE and is provided to the MC service server at
service authorization of the MC service user. It may be equivalent to the
client IDs specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [10], 3GPP TS 24.281 [11] and 3GPP TS
24.282 [12].
The MC replay equipment will require authorization of the MC service user
making use of the MC replay equipment, following the procedure for
authentication and authorization the primary MC system specified in 3GPP TS
23.280 [2] subclause 10.6.1. Configuration and authorization of the user of
the MC replay equipment is out of scope of this solution.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether authorization to use MC replay equipment is
within the scope of the user profile of an MC service user as defined in the
MC service specifications.
### 6.3.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
New entities are introduced in this solution, specifically the MC logging
equipment and its constituent MC logging client together with MC logging
storage and the MC replay equipment containing the MC replay client. The new
MC logging client is based on existing MC service clients to maximise reuse of
existing functionality and reference points.
The process for authentication and service authorization use existing
functional entities, reference points and procedures.
New configuration will be introduced to configure logging equipment, and to
configure MC service groups with the list of MC logging equipments that will
log MC service group communications.
New procedures for logging call related information and call contents will be
required. However these can be based on existing procedures for call setup and
floor, transmission and media control within calls.
Interactions between MC logging client, logging storage and the MC replay
client are not specified within this solution and so have no impact on
existing nodes and functionality.
### 6.3.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution defines new functional entities and reference points to fulfil
the on-network logging requirement together with reuse of existing common
services core functional entities and reference points. The new functional
entities and reference points will be based on the functionality of existing
MC service clients and associated reference points. The solution includes a
means of identifying the MC service client where an MC service user is
receiving MC service from multiple MC service clients.
A set of procedures will need to be defined to show the invocation of logging
functions on logged calls.
## 6.4 Solution 4: On-network logging for interconnection and migration
### 6.4.1 Description
#### 6.4.1.1 General
This solution builds on solution 3, \'Functionality for on-network logging and
replay\' to add the case where the logging equipment receives service from its
primary MC system, but the target of logging is receiving service in a partner
MC system. The target of logging may be receiving MC service in its primary MC
system, or may have migrated to that MC system from another MC system.
#### 6.4.1.2 Functional model
The functional model in solution 3 is expanded to show the interconnection to
a different MC system. This is shown in figure 6.4.1.2-1 below.
Figure 6.4.1.2-1: Common services core functional model for logging with
interconnection
In Figure 6.4.1.2-1, the interaction between the MC logging equipment and the
MC replay equipment is not shown and remains according to solution 3.
The configuration management server in the primary MC system of the MC logging
equipment provides the MC logging equipment with the list of MC service users
and MC service groups that the MC logging equipment logs. This can include
users and groups that receive service in partner MC systems. The list of users
and groups receiving service in the partner MC system is shared by the
configuration management server in the primary MC system of the MC logging
equipment with the configuration management server in the partner MC system
using reference point CSC-17, and authorized users or administrators of the
partner MC system can locally modify or authorize the list. When this
configuration in the partner MC system is provided to the partner MC service
server, the partner MC service server can determine which calls should be
provided to the primary MC system of the MC logging equipment to allow logging
to take place.
There needs to be interaction between the group management servers in the two
MC systems using reference point CSC-16 so that the group management server in
the partner MC system can authorize the MC logging equipment to be a member of
MC service groups which are hosted in that partner MC system.
Figure 6.4.1.2-2 below shows the MC service related application plane entities
used to log communications originating from a partner MC system.
Figure 6.4.1.2-2: MC service related application plane functional model for
logging for interconnection
In figure 6.4.1.2-2, an additional reference point MCLog-4 is added between MC
service servers compared with the functional model in solution 3. MCLog-4
carries call related information and call content from the partner MC service
server to the primary MC service server, and is based on reference point
MCX-1. Compared with MCX-1, MCLog-4 only permits communications information to
originate from the partner MC service server and to flow via the primary MC
service server to the MC logging equipment, and does not permit calls to be
set up in the opposite direction.
#### 6.4.1.3 Configuration
##### 6.4.1.3.1 General
The MC logging equipment configuration outlined in solution 3 remains
unchanged for interconnection and migration. The list of users and groups to
be logged can include users and groups receiving service in a partner MC
system of the MC logging equipment.
The impact of logging for MC service groups, and a configuration for logging
of group communications where the group host is a partner MC system of the MC
logging equipment is presented in subclause 6.4.1.3.2.
The impact of logging for MC service users is presented as three alternative
solutions for logging of individual communications in a partner MC system,
contained in subclauses 6.4.1.3.3, 6.4.1.3.4 and 6.4.1.3.5. Individual
communications include private calls between MC service users and
communications between an MC service user and a server. It is necessary for a
primary MC system to be provided with the MC service IDs of the MC logging
clients of logging equipments which are providing logging service in a partner
MC system, and for authorized users or administrators of the primary MC system
to be able to authorize this logging from a partner MC system. The three
options in the three subclauses provide this information in alternative ways.
##### 6.4.1.3.2 Logging of group communications in partner system
No changes are needed to group configuration information. The common group
configuration (on-network) includes the MC service IDs of the MC logging
clients of the MC logging equipment which is providing the logging service in
a partner MC system of the group.
##### 6.4.1.3.3 Logging of individual communications -- option 1
In solution 3, the list of MC service IDs to be logged by an MC logging
equipment are listed in the configuration of the MC logging equipment, and the
MC service IDs relating to the MC logging equipment are not listed in the user
profiles of the target MC service users. In the solution described in the
present subclause, the user profiles of MC service users are expanded to
include the MC service IDs of the responsible MC logging equipment. Thus an
on-network MC service user profile will gain the configuration paremeters
listed in table 6.4.1.3.3-1.
Table 6.4.1.3.3-1: Addition to MC service user profile for logging of
individual communications
* * *
Reference Parameter description MCPTT UE MCPTT server Configuration management
server MCPTT user database List of MC logging clients which log communications
of the MC service user  
> MC service ID N Y Y Y
* * *
In Table 6.4.1.3.3-1 \'MC service\' represents one of MCPTT, MCVideo or
MCData.
To support interconnection, the MC service IDs of the MC logging clients will
include those contained in MC logging equipment that is providing logging
service in a partner MC system. In the case of migration, the partner MC
system of the migrated MC service user will receive a user profile from the
primary MC system of the MC service user which includes the list of MC logging
equipment in the primary MC system of the MC service user (and in any other MC
systems) which log the communications of that MC service user.
NOTE: This solution has similarities with the configuration for MC service
groups, where the group members are listed in the group configuration
information, and the list of groups for each MC service user is listed in the
user profile.
##### 6.4.1.3.4 Logging of individual communications -- option 2
In this solution, the configuration table of the MC logging equipment and its
target MC service users described in solution 3, table 6.3.1.2-1, is provided
to the partner MC system. The partner MC system therefore may receive multiple
configuration tables from the primary MC system of the MC logging equipment
where each configuration table identifies an MC logging equipment and the list
of MC service users to be logged. The configuration information will need to
be analysed in the partner MC system to determine which MC service servers
need to be provided with the information to permit logging based on the list
of target MC service users.
NOTE: The primary MC system of the MC logging equipment may provide the
partner MC system with a configuration table relevant to each MC logging
equipment where only target MC service users that may receive MC service in
the partner MC system are listed (instead of the full set of users that the MC
logging equipment logs).
##### 6.4.1.3.5 Logging of individual communications -- option 3
In this solution, a single configuration table is provided to the partner MC
system that lists the MC service identities of the MC logging equipments which
provide logging service in their primary MC system and their set of logged MC
service users. Such a configuration table is shown in table 6.4.1.3.5-1.
Table 6.4.1.3.5-1: MC logging equipment configuration for provision to partner
MC system
* * *
Reference Parameter description MC service server Configuration management
server MC service identity of MC logging client  
> MC service ID Y Y > List of users to be logged  
>> MC service ID Y Y
* * *
The configuration information will need to be analysed in the partner MC
system to determine which MC service servers need to be provided with the
information to permit logging based on the list of target MC service users.
NOTE 1: The primary MC system of the MC logging equipment may provide the
partner MC system with a configuration table relevant to each MC logging
equipment where only target MC service users that may receive MC service in
the partner MC system are listed (instead of the full set of users that the MC
logging equipment logs).
NOTE 2: The table could also include a list of MC service groups to be logged
for each MC logging equipment.
#### 6.4.1.4 Procedures
Solution 3 discusses the need to add procedures to the MC service
specifications to illustrate the inclusion of the MC logging equipment in
communications. In the case of interconnection, the generic procedures for
interconnection described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2] subclause 10.14 also apply to
procedures for logging, allowing the relevant partner MC system to be
determined and authorization for the logging to take place by both the primary
and partner MC systems.
### 6.4.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
An additional reference point is added to the MC service servers, MCLog-4, to
allow communication related information and communication content to be passed
from the MC service server where the communications are hosted to the primary
MC service server of the MC logging equipment. However this is based on
existing reference point MCX-1, and can be considered a reduced function set
of MCX-1.
Additional configuration is added beyond that specified in solution 3, to
allow MC logging equipment providing logging in one MC system to receive the
communications for logging from a partner MC system.
### 6.4.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution expands the solution defined in solution 3 to allow logging
where the logging equipment is providing logging services in a different MC
system to that of the MC logging equipment.
Three options are provided to provide configuration to a partner MC system to
enable logging of individual communications. Of these, option 1 which adds the
MC service ID associated with the MC logging equipment to the user profile is
preferred as it does not add further configuration tables to be exchanged
between primary and partner MC systems to enable interconnection and
migration, and does not require any analysis in the partner MC system to
determine which MC service servers need to be provided with the information.
## 6.5 Solution 5: Discreet listening for interconnection and migration
### 6.5.1 Description
#### 6.5.1.1 Functional model
Solution 1 proposes that discreet listening within a single MC system is a
functionality available to an authorized user, and therefore no changes are
needed to the functional models for MC services. This will also be the case
for interconnection and migration.
#### 6.5.1.2 Configuration
##### 6.5.1.2.1 General
The additional authorization to perform discreet listening to the user
profiles for MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData which is proposed in solution 1
includes lists of users upon whom discreet listening can be invoked: these can
include users that receive service in partner MC systems and therefore no
further configuration is needed for interconnection and migration for the
authorized user.
However, an MC system that provides MC service to a target for discreet
listening will need to authorize requests for discreet listening that
originate from a partner MC system. Three options are provided in the
following subclauses as means to provide configuration to another MC system to
allow such authorization to take place.
##### 6.5.1.2.2 User profile authorization of discreet listening -- option 1
To permit discreet listening from a partner MC system, in this option the user
profile of the target for discreet listening is modified to include the list
of authorized users that are able to perform discreet listening on that target
user. This will entail additions to the user profiles for MC service users as
shown in table 6.5.1.2.2-1 below.
Table 6.5.1.2.2-1: Addition to MC service user profiles (on network)
* * *
Reference Parameter description MC serviceUE MC service Server Configuration
management server MC service user database List of authorized users who can
perform discreet listening on this MC service user  
> MC service ID N Y Y Y
* * *
In Table 6.5.1.2.2-1 \'MC service\' represents one of MCPTT, MCVideo or
MCData.
Therefore, if an authorized user in a partner MC system of an MC service user
is authorized to perform discreet listening on that MC service user, that
authorized user\'s MC service identity will be configured in the user profile
of the target MC service user. When an MC service user migrates to a partner
MC system, the user profile for migration provided to the partner MC system of
that MC service user will list authorized users permitted to perform discreet
listenting on that MC service user, including those authorized users who
receive MC service in the primary MC system of the migrating MC service user,
or in any other MC system. The inclusion of this information in the user
profile allows the MC service server in the partner MC system which provides
service to the target MC service user to authorize requests for discreet
listening when they arise.
##### 6.5.1.2.3 Sharing the user profile for authorized users -- option 2
In this option, the primary MC system of the authorized user shares a user
profile for the authorized user with any partner MC systems which are
providing service to MC service users that are (potential) targets for
discreet listening prior to any requests for discreet listening. According to
solution 1, the user profile for the authorized user lists the configured
target users for that authorized user. Where there are multiple authorized
users who need to perform discreet listening on targets in a partner MC
system, a separate user profile is provided to the partner MC system for each
of those authorized users. The profiles are provided to the MC service servers
providing service to the target MC service users, so that requests for
discreet listening can be authorized when needed.
The additional information in the user profile of the authorized user is shown
in table 6.5.1.2.3-1 below, and is the same as that shown in Solution 1.
Table 6.5.1.2.3-1: Addition to user profile (on network) for authorized user
* * *
Reference Parameter description MCPTT UE MCPTT Server Configuration management
server MCPTT user database Authorized to perform discreet listening on another
MC service user Y Y Y Y List of users upon whom discreet listening can be

> MC service ID Y Y Y Y
* * *
NOTE: The profile shared with the partner MC system only need contain the
information about targets for discreet listening that receive MC service in
that partner MC system, and need not contain any other configuration
information for the authorized user.
##### 6.5.1.2.4 New configuration table of authorized users -- option 3
In this option, a new configuration table is defined in the primary MC system
of the authorized users who require discreet listening, which lists those
authorized users and each of the valid target users on who discreet listening
can be performed. This table is shared with the partner MC system prior to
discreet listening taking place. The table is provided to the MC service
servers in the partner MC system that provide service to the targets of
discreet listening to allow discreet listening invoked by the nominated
authorized users to be permitted.
NOTE 1: The MC service server in the primary MC system of the authorized user
does not require this table, as the authorization to perform discreet
listening and the list of targets is already contained in the user profile for
the authorized user.
The form of the table is shown in table 6.5.1.2.4 below.
Table 6.5.1.2.4-1: Table of authorized users for discreet listening for
provision to partner MC system
* * *
Reference Parameter description MC service server Configuration management
server MC service identity of authorized user  
> MC service ID Y Y > List of users on who discreet listening can be performed  
>> MC service ID Y Y
* * *
NOTE 2: The primary MC system of the authorized user may provide a
configuration table to the partner MC system where only relevant MC service
users are listed, i.e. the authorized users that may invoke discreet listening
from their primary MC system, and the list of target users that may receive MC
service in that partner MC system only.
#### 6.5.1.3 Procedures
Solutions 1 and 2 detail procedures to invoke discreet listening in a single
MC system. These procedures can be utilized together with the generic
procedures for interconnection which are described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2]
subclause 10.14, which allow the relevant partner MC system to be determined
and authorization to be carried out by both primary and partner MC systems.
### 6.5.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
This solution results in additional configuration to be shared between primary
MC system of the authorized user and the partner MC system of the authorized
user, where the target of discreet listening is receiving MC service in that
partner MC system. The nature of the configuration information is determined
by which of the three options in subclause 6.5.1.2 is adopted. Configuration
information needs to be provided to the MC service servers providing service
to the targets of discreet listening so that requests for discreet listening
can be authorized. Options 2 and 3 require some examination of the
configuration information in the partner system before it is provided to the
MC service servers, as the MC service servers to be provided with the
configuration information are determined by the lists of users within the
configuration tables.
### 6.5.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution expands the solutions 1 and 2 to allow discreet listening where
the target is receiving MC service from a different MC system from that of the
authorized user performing discreet listening. The three configuration options
are evaluated as follow.
\- Option 1 adds the list of authorized users to the user profile of every
potential target user. This could be considered sensitive, however the target
MC service user would not be provided with this aspect of the user profile via
the MC service UE, and the list of permissible authorized users does not
provide any information about when the discreet listening service is invoked.
This option provides the least additional configuration work, as a partner MC
system would be configured with this information as a matter of course for any
MC service users for who the partner MC system is their primary MC system, and
the partner MC system would receive this information whenever an MC service
user migrated to that partner MC system. The provision of configuration to MC
service server is according to existing procedures.
\- Option 2 requires the primary MC system of the authorized user to share a
partial user profile with the partner MC system in advance of the invocation
of discreet listening. This would be a new set of information which would need
to be shared independently from either call related services or migration.
Provision to the MC service server in the partner MC system requires analysis
of the configuration information, as the target users are members of a lists.
\- Option 3 requires a new configuration table to be created and shared by the
primary MC system of the authorized users with the partner system in advance
of the invocation of discreet listening. As for option 2, this would be a new
set of information which would need to be shared independently from either
call related services or migration. Provision to the MC service server in the
partner MC system requires analysis of the configuration information, as the
target users are members of a lists.
Therefore of these three options, option 1 is the most consistent with current
MC system operation and requires the least additional configuration work,
however options 2 and 3 may result in simpler solutions.
## 6.6 Solution 6: Discreet listening to an MCPTT group
### 6.6.1 Description
#### 6.6.1.1 Overview
This solution serves for the scenario where an authorized user specifies an
MCPTT group to be the target of discreet listening. The invocation of discreet
listening to a group is based on pre-configured authorizations for the
listener and the group members of the target group. The provision of discreet
listening of a target group is performed either at the initiation of the group
call or during the on-going group call.
#### 6.6.1.2 Configuration
In user profile configuration of MCPTT in TS 23.379 clause A.3, two new
parameters are added to indicate the authorization of activating discreet
listening to a target group and the list of target groups.
Table 6.6.1.2-1: Addition to MCPTT user profiles (on network)

In group configuraiton data of MCPTT in TS 23.379 clause A.4, a new parameter
is added to indicate the authorization of group members for being discreet
listened.

#### 6.6.1.3 Procedures
##### 6.6.1.3.1 Discreet listening activation and deactivation
The procedures for activation and deactivation of discreet listening to groups
are shown in figure 6.6.1.3.1-1 and figure 6.6.1.3.1-2 below.
Figure 6.6.1.3.1-1: Discreet listening group activation
Figure 6.6.1.3.1-2: Discreet listening group deactivation
##### 6.6.1.3.2 Provision of discreet listening to groups
The provision of discreet listening can only happen after it is successfully
activated. The provision of discreet listening towards a target group is made
by inviting the authorized user to the target group call if it is initiated
after the activation of discreet listening (as shown in figure 6.6.1.3.2-1),
or by transferring the target group call to the authorized user if it is
initiated before the activation of discreet listening (as shown in figure
6.6.1.3.2-2).
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 3 (authorized user) has activated discreet listening to this
specified MCPTT group.
Figure 6.6.1.3.2-1: Discreet listening of MCPTT group call (discreet listening
for target group is activated)
Figure 6.6.1.3.2-2: Discreet listening of MCPTT group call (discreet listening
for target group is not activated)
##### 6.6.1.3.3 Release discreet listening to groups
When the authorized user decides to stop discreet listening to a target group
which has no on-going group communications, the discreet listening
deactivation procedure is used as defined in subclause 6.6.1.3.1.
When the authorized user decides to stop discreet listening to a target group
which has on-going group communications, the procedure as shown in figure
6.6.1.3.3-1 is used. The group communication is unaffected by the release of
discreet listening media to the authorized user.

5\. Media plane for discreet listening to the target MCPTT group is released.
When the group call of the target group is released, the discreet listening to
the current call is also released as shown in procedure in figure 6.6.1.3.3-2
below.
Pre-conditions:
\- The authorized user at MCPTT client 3 is discreet listening to the group
call of the target MCPTT group.

### 6.6.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
This solution results in the following impacts on existing entities and
reference points:
\- MCPTT servers and MCPTT clients (of authorized users): addition of
functionality for activation and deactivation of discreet listening to a
specified target MCPTT group; addition of functionality for provision of
discreet listening towards a group call to the authorized user without
incorporate this authorized user into the group membership.
\- MCPTT user configuration (of authorized user): authorization of invoking
discreet listening to a target group and the list of target groups.
\- MCPTT group configuration: authorization for being discreet listened in
group communications of this group.
\- MCPTT-1 reference points: addition of new messages in support of new
procedures for discreet listening.
\- New procedures to request discreet listening specifying a target MCPTT
group and provision of discreet listening to the specified target group.
Editor\'s note: Solutions are FFS for some regrouping scenarios when
transmissions from users or groups that are not targets of discreet listening
need to be filtered.
### 6.6.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution supports discreet listening of a target group by using similar
mechanisms of discreet listening of a target user defined in Solution 1. This
solution has no impact to the existing function models.
## 6.7 Solution 7: Logging of MCData message store and MCData content server
### 6.7.1 Description
#### 6.7.1.1 Overview
This solution addresses key issue 11: logging of MCData content server and
message store services.
#### 6.7.1.2 Logging of MCData message store services
A message store provides a private storage facility for an MCData user, where
data that has been transmitted or received can be cached for later retrieval,
where a message can be saved prior to sending and where data exchanged in a
group while the MCData user was not receiving MCData service can be stored in
order to provide lossless communications.
As any MCData transactions sent or received can be provided to the MC logging
function when transferred, it is not necessary to provide additional logging
exchanges between the message store and the MC logging function. However, if
logging of MCData content stored in the MCData message store is required, this
can be provided as an integral function of the MCData message store, and is
therefore out of scope of the present document.
#### 6.7.1.3 Logging of MCData content server transactions
A file distribution transaction involving an MCData content server allows an
MCData user to upload a file to an MCData content server, then initiate file
transfer to an MCData user or group by sending the URL of the file to the
target user or group, and allowing the user or group members to retrieve the
file by downloading from the MCData content server. In this solution, the
initial file upload is not sent to the MC logging function, but transactions
between MCData users to transfer the file are stored in the MC logging
function, and the MC logging function can also optionally retrieve the file
being exchanged.
NOTE 1: If logging of the file is required when uploaded and before
distribution to target users and groups, this can be provided by an integral
function of the MCData content server. Such functionality is outside the scope
of this solution.
Figure 6.7.1.3-1 illustrates the procedure to log file transfer where an
MCData content server is in use.
Figure 6.7.1.3-1: Logging of MCData file distribution using MCData content
server
In figure 6.7.1.3-1,
\- Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 11 follow those for file distribution to a
single target MCData user or to a target MCData group, as defined in 3GPP TS
22.282 [5].
\- Step 5 alerts the MC logging function to the data transfer following the
transmission of the file distribution request to the target users,
\- Step 7 informs the MC logging function of the target MCData user or
group\'s response. If the target of the FD operation is a group, a single
report message may indicate the responses from multiple group members, and
multiple messages may be sent containing the responses from different group
members.
NOTE 2: Step 7 may occur before or after steps 6 and/or 8. It is not expected
that step 6 or step 8 will be delayed in case of non-receipt of step 7 by the
MCData content server, however an implementation may decide to hold or prevent
steps 6 and/or 8 taking place in event of delay or non-receipt of step 7 if
system policy requires all transactions to be logged, and the requirement for
logging overrules the requirement to provide the target MCData users with the
file contents.
\- The MC logging function may decide (according to configuration) to download
and log the content of the file in step 9. Step 9 may also be delayed until
after step 11 in which the MC logging function is informed of the download
completed report, so that the MC logging function may choose not to download
the file unless at least one target user has successfully downloaded the file.
Alternatively, the MC logging function may be configured to only log the fact
that the file transfer has taken place, and not the file itself, in which case
step 9 is omitted.
\- Step 11 informs the MC logging equipment of the download complete report(s)
of the target user(s) if these are sent. As in step 7, if the target of the FD
operation is a group, a single report message may indicate the responses from
multiple group members, and multiple messages may be sent containing the
responses from different group members.
### 6.7.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MCData server needs to send additional messages to the MC logging
equipment when MCData file distribution takes place so that the logging
recorder can log requests, responses and reports relating to file distribution
transactions.
The MCData content server needs to be able to receive requests for file
content from the MC logging equipment, in addition to those from the targets
of the file distribution transaction.
### 6.7.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution places logging of content stored in an MCData message store out
of scope.
This solution provides a solution for logging of MCData file distribution
where an MCData content server is in use. Additional functionality is required
for the MCData server to inform the MC logging function of file distribution
transactions; however this is similar to functionality required between an
MCData server and an MCData client for file distribution.
## 6.8 Solution 8: Discreet listening of MCData message store and MCData
content server
### 6.8.1 Description
#### 6.8.1.1 Overview
This solution addresses key issue 12: discreet listening of MCData content
server and message store services.
#### 6.8.1.2 Discreet listening of MCData message store services
A message store provides a private storage facility for an MCData user, where
data that has been transmitted or received can be cached for later retrieval,
where a message can be saved prior to sending and where data exchanged in a
group while the MCData user was not receiving MCData service can be stored in
order to provide lossless communications.
As any MCData transactions sent or received can be provided to the authorized
user performing discreet listening when transferred, it is not necessary to
provide discreet listening of exchanges between the message store and the MC
logging function. However, if discreet listening of MCData content being
uploaded to, downloaded from or stored in the MCData message store is
required, this can be provided as an integral function of the MCData message
store, and is therefore out of scope of the present document.
#### 6.8.1.3 Discreet listening of MCData content server transactions
A file distribution transaction involving an MCData content server allows an
MCData user to upload a file to an MCData content server, then initiate file
transfer to an MCData user or group by sending the URL of the file to the
target user or group, and allowing the user or group members to retrieve the
file by downloading from the MCData content server. In this solution, the
initial file upload is not notified or sent to the authorized user performing
discreet listening, but transactions between MCData users to transfer the file
are sent to the authorized user, and the authorized user can also optionally
retrieve the file being exchanged.
NOTE 1: If discreet listening of the file is required when uploaded and before
distribution to target users and groups, this can be provided by an integral
function of the MCData content server. Such functionality is outside the scope
of this solution.
Figure 6.8.1.3-1 illustrates the procedure for discreet listening where an
MCData content server is in use. In this procedure, at least one of the
sourcing MCData client 1 or the target MCData users or groups are the target
for the discreet listening service. The authorized user is making use of
MCData client 2 to perform the discreet listening service.
Figure 6.8.1.3-1: Discreet listening of MCData file distribution using MCData
content server
In figure 6.8.1.3-1,
\- Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10 and 12 follow those for file distribution to a
single target MCData user or to a target MCData group, as defined in 3GPP TS
22.282 [5].
\- Step 5 alerts the authorized user at MCData client 2 to the request for
data transfer sent to the target users, and step 6 contains the response from
MCData client 2 informing the MCData server that MCData client 2 received the
MCData FD discreet listening request.
NOTE 2: Step 6 may occur before or after step 7. However, the MCData server
should not cause the file download in step 10 to be delayed or impeded if step
7 is not received by the MCData server, to prevent the discreet listening
service from causing any perceived change to the MCData FD service to the
users taking part in the FD service.
\- Step 8 informs the authorized user at MCData client 2 of the target MCData
user or group\'s response and step 9 contains the response from MCData client
2 confirming receipt of the target user or group\'s response by MCData client
2. If the target of the FD transfer is a group, a single message may contain
the responses of multiple users, and multiple messages may be sent indicating
the responses of multiple group members.
\- The authorized user may choose to download the specified file contents in
step 11.
NOTE 3: The file needs to be stored in the MCData content server long enough
to enable the authorized user to retrieve the file.
\- Step 13 informs the authorized user at MCData client 2 of the download
complete report(s) of the target user(s) if these are sent, and step 14
confirms receipt of this to the MCData server. As for step 8, a single
discreet listening report sent to MCData client 2 in step 13 may contain
reports from multiple target MCData group members, and multiple messages may
be sent in step 13.
NOTE 4: Steps 6, 9 and 14 may utilise an automatic process, such that a human
user does not need to make a decision at the time that the file download
commences.
### 6.8.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MCData server needs to send additional messages to the MCData client of
the authorized user relating to file distribution transactions.
The MCData content server needs to be able to and authorized to receive
requests for file content from the MCData client of the authorized user, in
addition to those from the targets of the file distribution transaction. Such
download of content is not visible to the originator of the content, or the
target recipients of the content.
Additional configuration will be needed to achieve this functionality.
### 6.8.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution places discreet listening of content stored in an MCData message
store out of scope.
This solution provides a solution for discreet listening of MCData file
distribution where an MCData content server is in use. Additional
functionality is required for the MCData server to inform the MCData client of
the authorized user of file distribution transactions; however this is similar
to functionality required between an MCData server and an MCData client for
file distribution.
## 6.9 Solution 9: Functionality for discreet listening with regulatory
constraints and operator security policies
### 6.9.1 Description
#### 6.9.1.1 Functional model
Discreet listening is carried out by an authorized user, who requests discreet
listening for the communications of another user or several users. There is no
differentiation to the type of communication, e.g. individual or group
communications. The authorized user will require a client entity capable of
fulfilling the discreet listening request. The functionality required is the
same as that of an MC service client, with the addition of the capability to
request discreet listening and specify an MC service user or several MC
service users as target. In contrast to discreet listening with no
constraints, discreet listening with regulatory constraints and operator
security policies is only applied to an MC service user or several MC service
users, which are identified as target MC service user(s). The communications
of other MC service users which are not defined as targets are not available
to the requested authorized MC service user.
This solution addresses aspects of key issue 14, Limitations on discreet
listening due to regulatory constraints and operator security policies.
#### 6.9.1.2 Configuration
The user profiles for MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData which are specified in 3GPP TS
23.379 [7], 3GPP TS 23.281 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.282 [9] will need additional
configuration to be added as shown in Table 6.9.1.2-1 below.

In Table 6.9.1.2-1 \'MC service\' represents one of MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData.
#### 6.9.1.3 Procedures
##### 6.9.1.3.1 General
New procedures are added to allow the MC service client of the authorized user
to invoke and revoke discreet listening of an MC service user or several MC
service users identified as target(s), and to allow the MC service server to
provide the content of communications in which the target MC service users are
involved. Communications of a MC service user or several MC service users not
identified as targets are not available to the requested authorized MC service
user.
##### 6.9.1.3.2 Discreet listening invocation and revocation procedures
The procedure allows the MC service client of the authorized user to request
discreet listening of a target MC service user. The procedure is illustrated
in Figure 6.9.1.3.2-1 below.
Figure 6.9.1.3.2-1: Discreet listening invocation
The information flows needed to support such a procedure are shown in tables
6.9.1.3.2-1 and 6.9.1.3.2-2 below.
Table 6.9.1.3.2-1: Discreet listening activation request
* * *
Information element Status Description MC service ID (NOTE) M MC service ID of
the target of the discreet listening request NOTE: Due to regulatory

failure of the discreet listening request NOTE: Due to regulatory constraints
and operator security policies only a MC service ID is provided, which is
identified as target.
* * *
A similar procedure, not illustrated here, is required for revocation of the
discreet listening function.
##### 6.9.1.3.3 Provision of discreet listening content for private
communications
When the target user makes or receives a private call or initiates individual
communications with a server, the authorized user needs to be informed and
provided with the media. Figure 6.9.1.3.3-1 below illustrates a procedure
where discreet listening target MC service client 1 sets up a call.
Figure 6.9.1.3.3-1: Discreet listening of target initiated private call
Steps 1 to 7 follow those in solution 1, subclause 6.1.1.3.3.
When the target MC service client 1 sends media (step 8a) to the called party
MC service client 2 (step 8b), the media is also sent to the authorized user
MC service client 3 (step 8c) by the MC service server,
However, when the called party MC service client 2, who is outside the scope
of the constrained discreet listening service, sends media (step 9a) to the
target MC service client 1 (step 9b), media is not forwarded to the authorized
user MC service client 3.
The procedure is similar if the target of the discreet listening is the
recipient of the private call.
NOTE 1: If the MC service server does not receive the \'discreet listening
call response\' for any reason, the call should still proceed so that the
requirement that the call is not affected and the target user is not aware of
the discreet listening process is satisfied.
NOTE 2: Under certain circumstances, the authorized user may also receive
communications of the other party in the communication, e.g. due to imperfect
echo cancellation in calls without floor control.
##### 6.9.1.3.4 Provision of discreet listening content for group
communications
When the target user makes or receives a group call, the authorized user needs
to be informed and provided with the media. Figure 6.9.1.3.4-1 below
illustrates a procedure where discreet listening target MC service client 2 is
a receiving party in a group call initiated by another affiliated group
member.
Figure 6.9.1.3.4-1: Discreet listening of target initiated group call
The procedure is similar if the target of the discreet listening is the
initiator of the group call.
NOTE 1: If the MC service server does not receive the \'discreet listening
call response\' for any reason, the call should still proceed so that the
requirement that the call is not affected and the target user is not aware of
the discreet listening process is satisfied.
NOTE 2: It is irrelevant whether the authorized user is or is not a member of
the MC service group.
##### 6.9.1.3.5 Information flows for discreet listening
Identical to solution 1, subclause 6.1.1.3.5.
### 6.9.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
This solution results in the following impacts on existing entities and
reference points:
\- Similar impacts as described in solution 1, subclause 6.1.3.
In each case, MC service is one of MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData.
### 6.9.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution allows discreet listening with regulatory constraints and
applied operator security policies to be achieved with minimal changes to the
functional model as it only requires enhancement to existing functional
entities and reference points. It also allows discreet listening to be invoked
on a service dependent basis as it is achieved as a function of the MC service
specific MC service clients.
## 6.10 Solution 10: Functionality for on-network logging and replay
### 6.10.1 Description
#### 6.10.1.1 Functional model
To support on-network logging and replay, existing common service core
functional entities are reused.
The MC logging function makes use of a new MC logging client which has a
subset of the functionality of an existing MC service client, in that it can
receive communications information and communications content relating to
logged users, but cannot set up calls or demand to take part in calls.
Provision of call related information and call content is achieved by
configuration in the MC service server. The MC logging client uses an MC
service ID to allow call related information and call content to be routed to
the MC logging client, reusing functionality from existing reference points.
NOTE 1: An MC logging function may contain multiple MC service clients to
allow the separate services MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData to be logged within the
same function. However this is out of scope of the description of the
functional model.
Figure 6.10.1.1-1 below illustrates the functional entities and reference
points of the common services core in the application plane that are used for
logging.
Figure 6.10.1.1-1: Common services core functional model for logging
The difference to solution#3 is listed as below:
1\. The MC replay function receives the necessary security information (e.g.,
keys used to decrypt the signalling information and media if the solution is
intended to log communications with any end to end encryption removed) needed
to replay logged communications via MCLog-11 from MC Logging function. A user
of the replay function, or an automatic function of the replay function, will
perform the necessary authorizations to retrieve logged communications, and
MCLog-11 will be used to verify the authenticity and authorization of the user
or function.
2\. The interface MCLog-10 is used for the MC replay client to access logged
communications from logging storage in MC logging function.
3\. MCLog-10 and MCLog-11 do not need to use 3GPP access for connectivity, and
are outside the scope of this solution.
Figure 6.10.1.1-2 below shows the MC service related application plane
entities used to log communications.
Figure 6.10.1.1-2: MC service related application plane functional model for
logging
The description MC service related application plane functional model for
logging is the same as described in solution#3.
#### 6.10.1.2 Configuration
The configuration aspect is the same as described in solution#3.
#### 6.10.1.3 Procedures
The procedures to enable MC logging function is the same as described in
solution#3.
The MC replay equipment and the interfaces MCLog-10, MClog-11 are outside
scope of this solution.
### 6.10.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
New entities are introduced in this solution, specifically the MC logging
equipment and its constituent MC logging client together with MC logging
storage and the MC replay equipment containing the MC replay client. The new
MC logging client is based on existing MC service clients to maximise reuse of
existing functionality and reference points.
The process for authentication and service authorization use existing
functional entities, reference points and procedures.
New configuration will be introduced to configure logging equipment, and to
configure MC service groups with the list of MC logging equipment that will
log MC service group communications.
New procedures for logging call related information and call contents will be
required. However these can be based on existing procedures for call setup and
floor, transmission and media control within calls.
Interactions between MC logging client, logging storage and the MC replay
client are not specified within this solution and so have no impact on
existing nodes and functionality.
### 6.10.3 Solution Evaluation
This solution defines new functional entities and reference points to fulfil
the on-network logging requirement together with reuse of existing common
services core functional entities and reference points. The new functional
entities and reference points will be based on the functionality of existing
MC service clients and associated reference points.
The interaction between the MC replay client and the MC logging function is
outside the scope of the present document.
A set of procedures will need to be defined to show the invocation of logging
functions on logged calls.

## 7.3 Key issues with security implications
The following key issues have security considerations that will need review
and possible solutions by SA3:
\- Key issue 4: Discreet listening of end to end encrypted calls; and
\- Key issue 5: Logging and replay of end to end encrypted calls.
# 8 Conclusions
This technical report presents scenarios, key issues and solutions for
discreet listening and logging for MC services.
All key issues that are addressed by one or more solutions in this Technical
Report are presented in subclause 7.2, and those which have security related
aspects which are considered to be outside the scope of solutions within this
Technical Report are presented in subclause 7.3.
The set of solutions described in this Technical Report are candidate
solutions for normative work. These solutions provide updates to the
functional models for MC services that will permit discreet listening and
logging to be realised, configuration which will permit discreet listening and
logging services to be achieved and describe the essentials of procedures to
provide the services themselves.
Some key issues and some solutions have security considerations. These are
identified in clause 7.
# Annex A: Reproduction of stage 1 requirements
## A.1 Requirements for discreet listening
Requirements listed in this subclause are reproduced from the specifications
referenced within this subclause. The referenced specifications are the
normative source for the requirements and have precedence over the information
reproduced within this subclause.
The requirements in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] that apply for discreet listening are
provided in table A.1â€‘1. They are applied to all services MCPTT, MCVideo and
MCData according to the reference tables in Annexes A, B and C of [2].
Table A.1-1: Discreet listening requirement
* * *
Requirement Description [R-6.15.1-001a] The MCX Service shall provide discreet
listening capabilities without noticeable impact on or knowledge of the target
MCX User, or the members of the target MCX Service Group, and all other
unauthorized MCX Users. [R-6.15.1-001] The MCX Service shall provide a
mechanism for an authorized MCX User to receive MCX Service Private
Communication transmissions to and from a specific target MCX User that is
within the authority of the authorized MCX user. [R-6.15.1-002] The MCX
Service shall provide a mechanism for an authorized MCX User to receive MCX
Service Group Communication transmissions to and from a specific target MCX
User that is within the authority of the authorized MCX User. [R-6.15.1-003]
Subject to regulatory constraints and operator security policies, the MCX
Service shall allow to be configured not to provide transmissions from MCX
Users who are communicating with the discreet listening target MCX User, and
who are not themselves targets of discreet listening. [R-6.15.1-004] The MCX
Service shall provide a mechanism for an authorized MCX User to receive MCX
Service Group transmissions from a specific MCX Service Group that is within
the authority of the authorized MCX User. NOTE: Permission to activate
discreet listening can include multiple levels of authorization, but this is
outside the scope of 3GPP.

## A.2 Requirements for recording and audit
Requirements listed in this subclause are reproduced from the specifications
referenced within this subclause. The referenced specifications are the
normative source for the requirements and have precedence over the information
reproduced within this subclause.
The following requirements in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] for recording and audit are
listed in table A.2â€‘1. They are applied to all services MCPTT, MCVideo and
MCData according to the reference tables in Annexes A, B and C of [2].
Table A.2-1: Requirements for recording and audit
* * *
Requirement Description [R-6.15.4-001] The MCX Service shall provide a
mechanism for a Mission Critical Organization to log the metadata of the MCX
Service Group Communications and MCX Service Private Communications under the
organization\'s authority. [R-6.15.4-002] Metadata shall be logged for both
the transmitting Participant and the receiving Participant(s). [R-6.15.4-003]
The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for a Mission Critical Organization
to record the transmissions of the Group Communications and Private
Communications under the organization\'s authority. [R-6.15.4-004] The MCX
Service shall provide a mechanism for a Mission Critical Organization to log
at least the following metadata per communication: depending on service this
may include; start time, date, MCX User ID, MCX Group ID, Location information
of the transmitting Participant, end time or duration, end reason, type of
communication (e.g., MCX Service Emergency, regroup, private). [R-6.15.4-005]
If an MCX Service Group Communication or MCX Service Private Communication
uses end-to-end confidentiality, the MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for
a Mission Critical Organization to maintain the end-to-end confidentiality
when the MCX Service Group Communication or MCX Service Private Communication
is logged. [R-6.15.4-006] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for a
Mission Critical Organization to log the metadata of non-communication related
user activities under the agency\'s authority. [R-6.15.4-007] The MCX Service
shall provide a mechanism for a Mission Critical Organization to log at least
the following non-communication activity types: MCX Service Emergency Alert,
MCX Service Emergency Alert cancellation, In-progress Emergency cancellation,
registration state change, overridden event, user remote logout, changing
another user\'s affiliations, affiliation change, and change of Selected MCX
Service Group. [R-6.15.4-008] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for a
Mission Critical Organization to log at least the following metadata per non-
communication activity: time, date, MCX Service User identity, and activity
type. The following metadata should be logged if applicable to the activity
type: MCX Service Group ID, Location information of the MCX User, affiliation
list, target MCX Service User ID and success/failure indication.
[R-6.15.4-009] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for a Mission
Critical Organization to log metadata for all failed authorization attempts
(e.g., invalid login password) by an MCX User. [R-6.15.4-010] The MCX Service
shall provide a mechanism to collect metadata for network access events (e.g.,
pre-emption of EPS bearer, loss of signal, failed registration attempts).
* * *
The following additional requirement for logging for MCVideo in 3GPP TS 22.281
[3] is provided in table A.2â€‘2:
Table A.2-2: MCVideo specific requirement for logging
* * *
Requirement Description [R-5.1.10.2-008] The MCVideo service shall be able to
provide an integrity protected timestamped detailed log of all performed and
attempted activities for each user of the MCVideo Service.
