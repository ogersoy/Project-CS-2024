# 4 System procedures
## 4.1 General
The clause 4 describes the procedures and Network Function services for the
5GS by end-to-end information flows and these information flows make use of NF
service operations, defined in clause 5, for the communication within the 5GC
Control Plane.
## 4.2 Connection, Registration and Mobility Management procedures
### 4.2.1 General
The Connection Management is used to establish and release the Control Plane
signalling connection between the UE and the AMF. The Registration Management
is used to register or deregister a UE/user with the 5GS and establish the
user context in the 5GS. The Mobility Management functions are used to keep
track of the current location of a UE. The procedures in clause 4.2 provides
Connection, Registration and Mobility Management functionality.
### 4.2.2 Registration Management procedures
#### 4.2.2.1 General
The Registration and Deregistration procedures in clause 4.2.2 provides the
required functionality to register or deregister a UE/user with the 5GS.
Additional functionality to support Registration Management for non-3GPP
access is defined in clause 4.12. Additional functionality to support
Registration Management for specific services such as SMS over NAS is defined
in clause 4.13.
#### 4.2.2.2 Registration procedures
##### 4.2.2.2.1 General
A UE needs to register with the network to get authorized to receive services,
to enable mobility tracking and to enable reachability. The UE initiates the
Registration procedure using one of the following Registration types:
\- Initial Registration to the 5GS;
\- Mobility Registration Update upon changing to a new Tracking Area (TA)
outside the UE\'s Registration Area in both CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE state, or
when the UE needs to update its capabilities or protocol parameters that are
negotiated in Registration procedure with or without changing to a new TA, a
change in the UE\'s Preferred Network Behaviour that would create an
incompatibility with the Supported Network Behaviour provided by the serving
AMF, or when the UE intends to retrieve LADN Information; or
\- Periodic Registration Update (due to a predefined time period of
inactivity); or
\- Emergency Registration.
The General Registration call flow in clause 4.2.2.2.2 applies on all these
Registration procedures, but the periodic registration need not include all
parameters that are used in other registration cases.
The following are the cleartext IEs, as defined in TS 24.501 [25] that can be
sent by the UE in the Registration Request message if the UE has no NAS
security context:
\- Registration type
\- SUCI or 5G-GUTI or PEI
\- Security parameters
\- additional GUTI
\- 4G Tracking Area Update
\- the indication that the UE is moving from EPS.
Aspects related to dual registration in 3GPP and non-3GPP access are described
in clause 4.12. The general Registration call flow in clause 4.2.2.2.2 is also
used for the case of registration in 3GPP access when the UE is already
registered in a non-3GPP access and vice versa. Registration in 3GPP access
when the UE is already registered in a non-3GPP access scenario may require an
AMF change, as further detailed in clause 4.12.8.
The general Registration call flow in clause 4.2.2.2.2 is also used by UEs in
limited service state (see TS 23.122 [22]) registering for emergency services
only (referred to as Emergency Registration), see clause 5.16.4 of TS 23.501
[2].
During the initial registration the PEI is obtained from the UE. If the PEI is
needed (e.g. for EIR check), the AMF shall retrieve the PEI when it
establishes the NAS security context with a Security Mode Command during
initial registration. The AMF operator may check the PEI with an EIR. If the
PEI was retrieved by the AMF (either from the UE or another AMF), AMF shall
provide it to the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration in order to ensure that the
UDM always has the latest PEI available e.g. for reporting event Change of
SUPI-PEI association. The AMF passes the PEI to the UDM, to the SMF and the
PCF. The UDM may store this data in UDR by Nudr_SDM_Update.
NOTE 1: The use of NSI ID in the 5GC is optional and depends on the deployment
choices of the operator.
During the registration the Home Network can provide Steering of Roaming
information to the UE via the AMF (i.e. a list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations or HPLMN indication that \'no change of the \"Operator
Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the UE is
needed). The Home Network can include an indication for the UE to send an
acknowledgement of the reception of this information. Details regarding the
handling of Steering of Roaming information including how this information is
managed between the AMF and the UE are defined in TS 23.122 [22].
The AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type as defined in clause 5.3.2.3 of TS
23.501 [2].
##### 4.2.2.2.2 General Registration
Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1: Registration procedure
1\. UE to (R)AN: AN message (AN parameters, Registration Request (Registration
type, SUCI or 5G-GUTI or PEI, [last visited TAI (if available)], Security
parameters, [Requested NSSAI], [Mapping Of Requested NSSAI], [Default
Configured NSSAI Indication], [UE Radio Capability Update], [UE MM Core
Network Capability], [PDU Session status], [List Of PDU Sessions To Be
Activated], [Follow-on request], [MICO mode preference], [Requested Active
Time], [Requested DRX parameters for E-UTRA and NR], [Requested DRX parameters
for NB-IoT], [extended idle mode DRX parameters], [LADN DNN(s) or Indicator Of
Requesting LADN Information], [NAS message container], [Support for
restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage], [Preferred Network Behaviour], [UE
paging probability information], [UE Policy Container (the list of PSIs,
indication of UE support for ANDSP and the operating system identifier)] and
[UE Radio Capability ID], PEI)).
NOTE 1: The UE Policy Container and its usage is defined in TS 23.503 [20].
In the case of NG-RAN, the AN parameters include e.g. 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI, the
Selected PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]) and
NSSAI information, the AN parameters also include Establishment cause. The
Establishment cause provides the reason for requesting the establishment of an
RRC connection. Whether and how the UE includes the NSSAI information as part
of the AN parameters is dependent on the value of the Access Stratum
Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode parameter, as specified in
clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2].
The AN parameters shall also include an IAB-Indication if the UE is an IAB-
node accessing 5GS.
The Registration type indicates if the UE wants to perform an Initial
Registration (i.e. the UE is in RM-DEREGISTERED state), a Mobility
Registration Update (i.e. the UE is in RM-REGISTERED state and initiates a
Registration procedure due to mobility or due to the UE needs to update its
capabilities or protocol parameters, or to request a change of the set of
network slices it is allowed to use), a Periodic Registration Update (i.e. the
UE is in RM-REGISTERED state and initiates a Registration procedure due to the
Periodic Registration Update timer expiry, see clause 4.2.2.2.1) or an
Emergency Registration (i.e. the UE is in limited service state).
When the UE is using E-UTRA, the UE indicates its support of CIoT 5GS
Optimisations, which is relevant for the AMF selection, in the RRC connection
establishment signalling associated with the Registration Request.
When the UE is performing an Initial Registration the UE shall indicate its UE
identity in the Registration Request message as follows, listed in decreasing
order of preference in the case of registration with a PLMN:
i) a 5G-GUTI mapped from an EPS GUTI, if the UE has a valid EPS GUTI.
ii) a native 5G-GUTI assigned by the PLMN to which the UE is attempting to
register, if available;
iii) a native 5G-GUTI assigned by an equivalent PLMN to the PLMN to which the
UE is attempting to register, if available;
iv) a native 5G-GUTI assigned by any other PLMN, if available.
NOTE 2: This can also be a 5G-GUTIs assigned via another access type.
v) Otherwise, the UE shall include its SUCI in the Registration Request as
defined in TS 33.501 [15].
When the UE performing an Initial Registration has both a valid EPS GUTI and a
native 5G-GUTI, the UE shall also indicate the native 5G-GUTI as Additional
GUTI. If more than one native 5G-GUTIs are available, the UE shall select the
5G-GUTI in decreasing order of preference among items (ii)-(iv) in the list
above.
When registering with an SNPN with 5G-GUTI as UE identity, the UE shall only
use the 5G-GUTI previously assigned by the same SNPN.
The NAS message container shall be included if the UE is sending a
Registration Request message as an Initial NAS message and the UE has a valid
5G NAS security context and the UE needs to send non-cleartext IEs, see clause
4.4.6 of TS 24.501 [25]. If the UE does not need to send non-cleartext IEs,
the UE shall send a Registration Request message without including the NAS
message container.
If the UE does not have a valid 5G NAS security context, the UE shall send the
Registration Request message without including the NAS message container. The
UE shall include the entire Registration Request message (i.e. containing
cleartext IEs and non-cleartext IEs) in the NAS message container that is sent
as part of the Security Mode Complete message in step 9b.
When the UE is performing an Initial Registration (i.e. the UE is in RM-
DEREGISTERED state) with a native 5G-GUTI then the UE shall indicate the
related GUAMI information in the AN parameters. When the UE is performing an
Initial Registration with its SUCI, the UE shall not indicate any GUAMI
information in the AN parameters.
When the UE is performing an Initial Registration or a Mobility Registration
and if CIoT 5GS Optimisations are supported the UE shall indicate its
Preferred Network Behaviour (see clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2]). If S1 mode
is supported the UE\'s EPC Preferred Network Behaviour is included in the S1
UE network capabilities in the Registration Request message, see clause
8.2.6.1 of TS 24.501 [25].
For an Emergency Registration, the SUCI shall be included if the UE does not
have a valid 5G-GUTI available; the PEI shall be included when the UE has no
SUPI and no valid 5G-GUTI. In other cases, the 5G-GUTI is included and it
indicates the last serving AMF.
The UE may provide the UE\'s usage setting based on its configuration as
defined in clause 5.16.3.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. The UE provides Requested NSSAI
as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2] and in the case of Initial
Registration or Mobility Registration Update, the UE includes the Mapping Of
Requested NSSAI (if available), which is the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the
Requested NSSAI to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs, to ensure that the network is able to
verify whether the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI are permitted based on
the Subscribed S-NSSAIs. In the case of inter PLMN mobility, if the serving
PLMN S-NSSAI(s) corresponding to the established PDU Session(s) are not
present in the UE, the associated HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) associated with the
established PDU Session(s) shall be provided in the Mapping Of Requested NSSAI
as described in the clause 5.15.5.2.1 TS 23.501 [2].
The UE includes the Default Configured NSSAI Indication if the UE is using a
Default Configured NSSAI, as defined in TS 23.501 [2].
The UE may include UE paging probability information if it supports the
assignment of WUS Assistance Information from the AMF (see TS 23.501 [2]).
In the case of Mobility Registration Update, the UE includes in the List Of
PDU Sessions To Be Activated the PDU Sessions for which there are pending
uplink data. When the UE includes the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated,
the UE shall indicate PDU Sessions only associated with the access the
Registration Request is related to. As defined in TS 24.501 [25] the UE shall
include always-on PDU Sessions which are accepted by the network in the List
Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated even if there are no pending uplink data for
those PDU Sessions.
NOTE 3: A PDU Session corresponding to a LADN is not included in the List Of
PDU Sessions To Be Activated when the UE is outside the area of availability
of the LADN.
The UE MM Core Network Capability is provided by the UE and handled by AMF as
defined in clause 5.4.4a of TS 23.501 [2]. The UE includes in the UE MM Core
Network Capability an indication if it supports Request Type flag \"handover\"
for PDN connectivity request during the attach procedure as defined in clause
5.17.2.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the UE supports \'Strictly Periodic
Registration Timer Indication\', the UE indicates its capability of \'Strictly
Periodic Registration Timer Indication\' in the UE MM Core Network Capability.
If the UE supports CAG, the UE indicates its capability of \"CAG supported\"
in the UE MM Core Network Capability.
The UE may provide either the LADN DNN(s) or an Indication Of Requesting LADN
Information as described in clause 5.6.5 of TS 23.501 [2].
If available, the last visited TAI shall be included in order to help the AMF
produce Registration Area for the UE.
The Security parameters are used for Authentication and integrity protection,
see TS 33.501 [15]. Requested NSSAI indicates the Network Slice Selection
Assistance Information (as defined in clause 5.15 of TS 23.501 [2]). The PDU
Session status indicates the previously established PDU Sessions in the UE.
When the UE is connected to the two AMFs belonging to different PLMN via 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access then the PDU Session status indicates the
established PDU Session of the current PLMN in the UE.
The Follow-on request is included when the UE has pending uplink signalling
and the UE doesn\'t include List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated, or the
Registration type indicates the UE wants to perform an Emergency Registration.
In Initial Registration and Mobility Registration Update, UE provides the UE
Requested DRX parameters, as defined in clause 5.4.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The UE
may provide the extended idle mode DRX parameters as defined in clause
5.31.7.2 of TS 23.501 [2] to request extended idle mode DRX.
The UE provides UE Radio Capability Update indication as described in TS
23.501 [2].
The UE includes the MICO mode preference and optionally a Requested Active
Time value if the UE wants to use MICO Mode with Active Time.
The UE may indicate its Service Gap Control Capability in the UE MM Core
Network Capability, see clause 5.31.16 of TS 23.501 [2].
For a UE with a running Service Gap timer in the UE, the UE shall not set
Follow-on Request indication or Uplink data status in the Registration Request
message (see clause 5.31.16 of TS 23.501 [2]), except for network access for
regulatory prioritized services like Emergency services or exception
reporting.
If UE supports RACS and has been assigned UE Radio Capability ID(s), the UE
shall indicate a UE Radio Capability ID as defined in clause 5.4.4.1a of TS
23.501 [2] as non-cleartext IE.
The PEI may be retrieved in initial registration from the UE as described in
clause 4.2.2.2.1.
2\. If a 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI is not included or the 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI does not
indicate a valid AMF the (R)AN, based on (R)AT and Requested NSSAI, if
available, selects an AMF
The (R)AN selects an AMF as described in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. If UE
is in CM-CONNECTED state, the (R)AN can forward the Registration Request
message to the AMF based on the N2 connection of the UE.
If the (R)AN cannot select an appropriate AMF, it forwards the Registration
Request to an AMF which has been configured, in (R)AN, to perform AMF
selection.
3\. (R)AN to new AMF: N2 message (N2 parameters, Registration Request (as
described in step 1) and [LTE-M Indication].
When NG-RAN is used, the N2 parameters include the Selected PLMN ID (or PLMN
ID and NID, see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]), Location Information and Cell
Identity related to the cell in which the UE is camping, UE Context Request
which indicates that a UE context including security information needs to be
setup at the NG-RAN.
When NG-RAN is used, the N2 parameters shall also include the Establishment
cause and IAB-Indication if the indication is received in AN parameters in
step 1.
Mapping Of Requested NSSAI is provided only if available.
If the Registration type indicated by the UE is Periodic Registration Update,
then steps 4 to 19 may be omitted.
When the Establishment cause is associated with priority services (e.g. MPS,
MCS), the AMF includes a Message Priority header to indicate priority
information. Other NFs relay the priority information by including the Message
Priority header in service-based interfaces, as specified in TS 29.500 [17].
The RAT Type the UE is using is determined (see clause 4.2.2.2.1) and based on
it the AMF determines whether the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to or
from NB-IoT. If the AMF receives the LTE M indication, then it considers that
the RAT Type is LTE-M and stores the LTE-M Indication in UE Context.
If a UE includes a Preferred Network Behaviour, this defines the Network
Behaviour the UE supports and is expecting to be available in the network as
defined in clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
If the UE has included the Preferred Network Behaviour and what the UE
indicated it supports in Preferred Network Behaviour is incompatible with the
network support, the AMF shall reject the Registration Request with an
appropriate cause value (e.g. one that avoids retries on this PLMN).
If there is a Service Gap timer running in the UE Context in AMF for the UE
and Follow-on Request indication or Uplink data status is included in the
Registration Request message, the AMF shall ignore the Follow-on Request
indication and Uplink data status and not perform any of the actions related
to the status.
If the UE has included a UE Radio Capability ID in step 1 and the AMF supports
RACS, the AMF stores the Radio Capability ID in UE context.
4\. [Conditional] new AMF to old AMF: Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer
(complete Registration Request) or new AMF to UDSF: Nudsf_Unstructured Data
Management_Query().
(With UDSF Deployment): If the UE\'s 5G-GUTI was included in the Registration
Request and the serving AMF has changed since last Registration procedure, new
AMF and old AMF are in the same AMF Set and UDSF is deployed, the new AMF
retrieves the stored UE\'s SUPI and UE context directly from the UDSF using
Nudsf_UnstructuredDataManagement_Query service operation or they can share
stored UE context via implementation specific means if UDSF is not deployed.
This includes also event subscription information by each NF consumer for the
given UE. In this case, the new AMF uses integrity protected complete
Registration request NAS message to perform and verify integrity protection.
(Without UDSF Deployment): If the UE\'s 5G-GUTI was included in the
Registration Request and the serving AMF has changed since last Registration
procedure, the new AMF may invoke the Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer
service operation on the old AMF including the complete Registration Request
NAS message, which may be integrity protected, as well as the Access Type, to
request the UE\'s SUPI and UE Context. See clause 5.2.2.2.2 for details of
this service operation. In this case, the old AMF uses either 5G-GUTI and the
integrity protected complete Registration request NAS message, or the SUPI and
an indication that the UE is validated from the new AMF, to verify integrity
protection if the context transfer service operation invocation corresponds to
the UE requested. The old AMF also transfers the event subscriptions
information by each NF consumer, for the UE, to the new AMF. If the old AMF
has not yet reported a non-zero MO Exception Data Counter to the (H-)SMF, the
Context Response also includes the MO Exception Data Counter.
If the old AMF has PDU Sessions for another access type (different from the
Access Type indicated in this step) and if the old AMF determines that there
is no possibility for relocating the N2 interface to the new AMF, the old AMF
returns UE\'s SUPI and indicates that the Registration Request has been
validated for integrity protection, but does not include the rest of the UE
context.
For inter PLMN mobility, UE Context information includes HPLMN S-NSSAIs
corresponding to the Allowed NSSAI for each Access Type, without Allowed NSSAI
of old PLMN.
NOTE 4: The new AMF Sets the indication that the UE is validated according to
step 9a, if the new AMF has performed successful UE authentication after
previous integrity check failure in the old AMF.
NOTE 5: The NF consumers do not need to subscribe for the events once again
with the new AMF after the UE is successfully registered with the new AMF.
If the new AMF has already received UE contexts from the old AMF during
handover procedure, then step 4,5 and 10 shall be skipped.
For an Emergency Registration, if the UE identifies itself with a 5G-GUTI that
is not known to the AMF, steps 4 and 5 are skipped and the AMF immediately
requests the SUPI from the UE. If the UE identifies itself with PEI, the SUPI
request shall be skipped. Allowing Emergency Registration without a user
identity is dependent on local regulations.
5\. [Conditional] old AMF to new AMF: Response to
Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer (SUPI, UE Context in AMF (as per Table
5.2.2.2.2-1)) or UDSF to new AMF: Nudsf_Unstructured Data Management_Query().
The old AMF may start an implementation specific (guard) timer for the UE
context.
If the UDSF was queried in step 4, the UDSF responds to the new AMF for the
Nudsf_Unstructured Data Management_Query invocation with the related contexts
including established PDU Sessions, the old AMF includes SMF information DNN,
S-NSSAI(s) and PDU Session ID, active NGAP UE-TNLA bindings to
N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF, the old AMF includes information about the NGAP UE-TNLA
bindings. If the Old AMF was queried in step 4, Old AMF responds to the new
AMF for the Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer invocation by including the
UE\'s SUPI and UE Context.
If old AMF holds information about established PDU Session(s) and it is not an
Initial Registration, the old AMF includes SMF information, DNN(s), S-NSSAI(s)
and PDU Session ID(s).
If old AMF holds UE context established via N3IWF, W-AGF or TNGF, the old AMF
includes the CM state via N3IWF, W-AGF or TNGF. If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED
state via N3IWF, W-AGF or TNGF, the old AMF includes information about the
NGAP UE-TNLA bindings.
If old AMF fails the integrity check of the Registration Request NAS message,
the old AMF shall indicate the integrity check failure. If the new AMF is
configured to allow emergency services for unauthenticated UE, the new AMF
behaves as follows:
\- If the UE has only an emergency PDU Session, the AMF either skips the
authentication and security procedure or accepts that the authentication may
fail and continues the Mobility Registration Update procedure; or
\- If the UE has both emergency and non emergency PDU Sessions and
authentication fails, the AMF continues the Mobility Registration Update
procedure and deactivates all the non-emergency PDU Sessions as specified in
clause 4.3.4.2.
NOTE 6: The new AMF can determine if a PDU Session is used for emergency
service by checking whether the DNN matches the emergency DNN.
If old AMF holds information about AM Policy Association and the information
about UE Policy Association (i.e. the Policy Control Request Trigger for
updating UE Policy as defined in TS 23.503 [20]), the old AMF includes the
information about the AM Policy Association, the UE Policy Association and PCF
ID. In the roaming case, V-PCF ID and H-PCF ID are included.
During inter PLMN mobility, the handling of the UE Radio Capability ID in the
new AMF is as defined in TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE 7: When new AMF uses UDSF for context retrieval, interactions between old
AMF, new AMF and UDSF due to UE signalling on old AMF at the same time is
implementation issue.
6\. [Conditional] new AMF to UE: Identity Request ().
If the SUCI is not provided by the UE nor retrieved from the old AMF the
Identity Request procedure is initiated by AMF sending an Identity Request
message to the UE requesting the SUCI.
7\. [Conditional] UE to new AMF: Identity Response ().
The UE responds with an Identity Response message including the SUCI. The UE
derives the SUCI by using the provisioned public key of the HPLMN, as
specified in TS 33.501 [15].
8\. The AMF may decide to initiate UE authentication by invoking an AUSF. In
that case, the AMF selects an AUSF based on SUPI or SUCI, as described in
clause 6.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2].
If the AMF is configured to support Emergency Registration for unauthenticated
SUPIs and the UE indicated Registration type Emergency Registration, the AMF
skips the authentication or the AMF accepts that the authentication may fail
and continues the Registration procedure.
9a. If authentication is required, the AMF requests it from the AUSF; if
Tracing Requirements about the UE are available at the AMF, the AMF provides
Tracing Requirements in its request to AUSF. Upon request from the AMF, the
AUSF shall execute authentication of the UE. The authentication is performed
as described in TS 33.501 [15]. The AUSF selects a UDM as described in clause
6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2] and gets the authentication data from UDM.
Once the UE has been authenticated the AUSF provides relevant security related
information to the AMF. If the AMF provided a SUCI to AUSF, the AUSF shall
return the SUPI to AMF only after the authentication is successful.
After successful authentication in new AMF, which is triggered by the
integrity check failure in old AMF at step 5, the new AMF invokes step 4 above
again and indicates that the UE is validated (i.e. through the reason
parameter as specified in clause 5.2.2.2.2).
9b If NAS security context does not exist, the NAS security initiation is
performed as described in TS 33.501 [15]. If the UE had no NAS security
context in step 1, the UE includes the full Registration Request message as
defined in TS 24.501 [25].
The AMF decides if the Registration Request needs to be rerouted as described
in clause 4.2.2.2.3, where the initial AMF refers to the AMF.
9c. The AMF initiates NGAP procedure to provide the 5G-AN with security
context as specified in TS 38.413 [10] if the 5G-AN had requested for UE
Context. Also, if the AMF decides that EPS fallback is supported (e.g. based
on UE capability to support Request Type flag \"handover\" for PDN
connectivity request during the attach procedure as defined in clause
5.17.2.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2], subscription data and local policy), the AMF
shall send an indication \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is
possible\" towards 5G-AN as specified in TS 38.413 [10]. Otherwise, the AMF
indicates \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is not possible\". In
addition, if Tracing Requirements about the UE are available at the AMF, the
AMF provides the 5G-AN with Tracing Requirements in the NGAP procedure.
9d. The 5G-AN stores the security context and acknowledges to the AMF. The
5G-AN uses the security context to protect the messages exchanged with the UE
as described in TS 33.501 [15].
10\. [Conditional] new AMF to old AMF:
Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate (PDU Session ID(s) to be released
due to slice not supported).
If the AMF has changed the new AMF informs the old AMF that the registration
of the UE in the new AMF is completed by invoking the
Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation.
If the authentication/security procedure fails, then the Registration shall be
rejected and the new AMF invokes the
Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation with a reject
indication towards the old AMF. The old AMF continues as if the UE context
transfer service operation was never received.
If one or more of the S-NSSAIs used in the old Registration Area cannot be
served in the target Registration Area, the new AMF determines which PDU
Session cannot be supported in the new Registration Area. The new AMF invokes
the Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation including
the rejected PDU Session ID towards the old AMF. Then the new AMF modifies the
PDU Session Status correspondingly. The old AMF informs the corresponding
SMF(s) to locally release the UE\'s SM context by invoking the
Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation.
If new AMF received in the UE context transfer in step 2 the information about
the AM Policy Association and the UE Policy Association and decides, based on
local policies, not to use the PCF(s) identified by the PCF ID(s) for the AM
Policy Association and the UE Policy Association, then it will inform the old
AMF that the AM Policy Association and the UE Policy Association in the UE
context is not used any longer and then the PCF selection is performed in step
15.
11\. [Conditional] new AMF to UE: Identity Request/Response (PEI).
If the PEI was not provided by the UE nor retrieved from the old AMF the
Identity Request procedure is initiated by AMF sending an Identity Request
message to the UE to retrieve the PEI. The PEI shall be transferred encrypted
unless the UE performs Emergency Registration and cannot be authenticated.
For an Emergency Registration, the UE may have included the PEI in the
Registration Request. If so, the PEI retrieval is skipped.
If the UE supports RACS as indicated in UE MM Core Network Capability, the AMF
shall use the PEI of the UE to obtain the IMEI/TAC for the purpose of RACS
operation.
12\. Optionally the new AMF initiates ME identity check by invoking the
N5g-eir_EquipmentIdentityCheck_Get service operation (see clause 5.2.4.2.2).
The PEI check is performed as described in clause 4.7.
For an Emergency Registration, if the PEI is blocked, operator policies
determine whether the Emergency Registration procedure continues or is
stopped.
13\. If step 14 is to be performed, the new AMF, based on the SUPI, selects a
UDM, then UDM may select a UDR instance. See clause 6.3.9 of TS 23.501 [2].
The AMF selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2].
14a-c. If the AMF has changed since the last Registration procedure, or if the
UE provides a SUPI which doesn\'t refer to a valid context in the AMF, or if
the UE registers to the same AMF it has already registered to a non-3GPP
access (i.e. the UE is registered over a non-3GPP access and initiates this
Registration procedure to add a 3GPP access), the new AMF registers with the
UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration for the access to be registered (and
subscribes to be notified when the UDM deregisters this AMF).
The AMF provides the \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\"
indication (see clause 5.16.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) to the UDM. The \"Homogenous
Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" indication shall not be included
unless the AMF has completed its evaluation of the support of \"IMS Voice over
PS Session\" as specified in clause 5.16.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
During initial Registration, if the AMF and UE supports SRVCC from NG-RAN to
UTRAN the AMF provides UDM with the UE SRVCC capability.
If the AMF determines that only the UE SRVCC capability has changed, the AMF
sends UE SRVCC capability to the UDM.
NOTE 8: At this step, it is possible that the AMF does not have all the
information needed to determine the setting of the IMS Voice over PS Session
Supported indication for this UE (see clause 5.16.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]). Hence
the AMF can send the \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\"
later on in this procedure.
If the AMF does not have subscription data for the UE, the AMF retrieves the
Access and Mobility Subscription data, SMF Selection Subscription data, UE
context in SMF data and LCS mobile origination using Nudm_SDM_Get. If the AMF
already has subscription data for the UE but the SoR Update Indicator in the
UE context requires the AMF to retrieve SoR information depending on the NAS
Registration Type (\"Initial Registration\" or \"Emergency Registration\")
(see Annex C of TS 23.122 [22]), the AMF retrieves the Steering of Roaming
information using Nudm_SDM_Get. This requires that UDM may retrieve this
information from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query. After a successful response is
received, the AMF subscribes to be notified using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe when the
data requested is modified, UDM may subscribe to UDR by Nudr_DM_Subscribe. The
GPSI is provided to the AMF in the Access and Mobility Subscription data from
the UDM if the GPSI is available in the UE subscription data. The UDM may
provide indication that the subscription data for network slicing is updated
for the UE. If the UE is subscribed to MPS in the serving PLMN, \"MPS
priority\" is included in the Access and Mobility Subscription data provided
to the AMF. If the UE is subscribed to MCX in the serving PLMN, \"MCX
priority\" is included in the Access and Mobility Subscription data provided
to the AMF. The UDM also provides the IAB-Operation allowed indication to AMF
as part of the Access and Mobility Subscription data. The AMF shall trigger
the setup of the UE context in NG-RAN, or modification of the UE context in
NG-RAN if the initial setup is at step 9c, including an indication that the
IAB-node is authorized.
The new AMF provides the Access Type it serves for the UE to the UDM and the
Access Type is set to \"3GPP access\". The UDM stores the associated Access
Type together with the serving AMF and does not remove the AMF identity
associated to the other Access Type if any. The UDM may store in UDR
information provided at the AMF registration by Nudr_DM_Update.
If the UE was registered in the old AMF for an access and the old and the new
AMFs are in the same PLMN, the new AMF sends a separate/independent
Nudm_UECM_Registration to update UDM with Access Type set to access used in
the old AMF, after the old AMF relocation is successfully completed.
The new AMF creates an UE context for the UE after getting the Access and
Mobility Subscription data from the UDM. The Access and Mobility Subscription
data includes whether the UE is allowed to include NSSAI in the 3GPP access
RRC Connection Establishment in clear text. The Access and Mobility
Subscription data may include Enhanced Coverage Restricted information. If
received from the UDM and the UE included support for restriction of use of
Enhanced Coverage in step 1, the AMF determines whether Enhanced Coverage is
restricted or not for the UE as specified in clause 5.31.12 of TS 23.501 [2]
and stores the updated Enhanced Coverage Restricted information in the UE
context.
The Access and Mobility Subscription data may include the NB-IoT UE Priority.
The subscription data may contain Service Gap Time parameter. If received from
the UDM, the AMF stores this Service Gap Time in the UE Context in AMF for the
UE.
For an Emergency Registration in which the UE was not successfully
authenticated, the AMF shall not register with the UDM.
The AMF enforces the Mobility Restrictions as specified in clause 5.3.4.1.1 of
TS 23.501 [2]. For an Emergency Registration, the AMF shall not check for
Mobility Restrictions, access restrictions, regional restrictions or
subscription restrictions. For an Emergency Registration, the AMF shall ignore
any unsuccessful registration response from UDM and continue with the
Registration procedure.
NOTE 9: The AMF can, instead of the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, use the
Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report Indication that
triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed data if the
corresponding feature is supported by both the AMF and the UDM.
14d. When the UDM stores the associated Access Type (e.g. 3GPP) together with
the serving AMF as indicated in step 14a, it will cause the UDM to initiate a
Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification (see clause 5.2.3.2.2) to the old AMF
corresponding to the same (e.g. 3GPP) access, if one exists. If the timer
started in step 5 is not running, the old AMF may remove the UE context for
the same Access Type. Otherwise, the AMF may remove UE context for the same
Access Type when the timer expires. If the serving NF removal reason indicated
by the UDM is Initial Registration, then, as described in clause 4.2.2.3.2,
the old AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext (SM Context ID)
service operation towards all the associated SMF(s) of the UE to notify that
the UE is deregistered from old AMF for the same Access Type. The SMF(s) shall
release the PDU Session on getting this notification.
If the old AMF has established an AM Policy Association and a UE Policy
Association with the PCF(s) and the old AMF did not transfer the PCF ID(s) to
the new AMF (e.g. new AMF is in different PLMN), the old AMF performs an AMF-
initiated Policy Association Termination procedure, as defined in clause
4.16.3.2 and performs an AMF-initiated UE Policy Association Termination
procedure, as defined in clause 4.16.13.1. In addition, if the old AMF
transferred the PCF ID(s) in the UE context but the new AMF informed in step
10 that the AM Policy Association information and UE Policy Association
information in the UE context will not be used then the old AMF performs an
AMF-initiated Policy Association Termination procedure, as defined in clause
4.16.3.2 and performs an AMF-initiated UE Policy Association Termination
procedure, as defined in clause 4.16.13.1.
If the old AMF has an N2 connection for that UE (e.g. because the UE was in
RRC Inactive state but has now moved to E-UTRAN or moved to an area not served
by the old AMF), the old AMF shall perform AN Release (see clause 4.2.6) with
a cause value that indicates that the UE has already locally released the NG-
RAN\'s RRC Connection.
14e. [Conditional] If old AMF does not have UE context for another access type
(i.e. non-3GPP access), the Old AMF unsubscribes with the UDM for subscription
data using Nudm_SDM_unsubscribe.
15\. If the AMF decides to initiate PCF communication, the AMF acts as
follows.
If the new AMF decides to use the (V-)PCF identified by the (V-)PCF ID
included in UE context from the old AMF in step 5, the AMF contacts the
(V-)PCF identified by the (V-)PCF ID to obtain policy. If the AMF decides to
perform PCF discovery and selection and the AMF selects a (V)-PCF and may
select an H-PCF (for roaming scenario) as described in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS
23.501 [2] and according to the V-NRF to H-NRF interaction described in clause
4.3.2.2.3.3.
16\. [Optional] new AMF performs an AM Policy Association
Establishment/Modification. For an Emergency Registration, this step is
skipped.
If the new AMF selects a new (V-)PCF in step 15, the new AMF performs AM
Policy Association Establishment with the selected (V-)PCF as defined in
clause 4.16.1.2.
If the (V-)PCF identified by the (V-)PCF ID included in UE context from the
old AMF is used, the new AMF performs AM Policy Association Modification with
the (V-)PCF as defined in clause 4.16.2.1.2.
If the AMF notifies the Mobility Restrictions (e.g. UE location) to the PCF
for adjustment, or if the PCF updates the Mobility Restrictions itself due to
some conditions (e.g. application in use, time and date), the PCF shall
provide the updated Mobility Restrictions to the AMF. If the subscription
information includes Tracing Requirements, the AMF provides the PCF with
Tracing Requirements.
If the AMF supports DNN replacement, the AMF provides the PCF with the Allowed
NSSAI and, if available, the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI.
If the PCF supports DNN replacement, the PCF provides the AMF with triggers
for DNN replacement.
17\. [Conditional] AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext ().
For an Emergency Registered UE (see TS 23.501 [2]), this step is applied when
the Registration Type is Mobility Registration Update.
The AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (see clause 5.2.8.2.6) in
the following scenario(s):
\- If the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated is included in the Registration
Request in step 1, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request to
SMF(s) associated with the PDU Session(s) in order to activate User Plane
connections of these PDU Session(s). Steps from step 5 onwards described in
clause 4.2.3.2 are executed to complete the User Plane connection activation
without sending the RRC Inactive Assistance Information and without sending MM
NAS Service Accept from the AMF to (R)AN described in step 12 of clause
4.2.3.2. When a User Plane connection for a PDU Session is activated, the AS
layer in the UE indicates it to the NAS layer.
\- If the AMF has determined in step 3 that the UE is performing Inter-RAT
mobility to or from NB-IoT, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
Request to SMF(s) associated with the UEs PDU Session(s), so the SMF(s) can
update them according to the \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\"
subscription data. Steps from step 5 onwards described in clause 4.2.3.2 are
executed without sending MM NAS Service Accept from the AMF to (R)AN described
in step 12 of clause 4.2.3.2.
When the serving AMF has changed, the new serving AMF notifies the SMF for
each PDU Session that it has taken over the responsibility of the signalling
path towards the UE: the new serving AMF invokes the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation using SMF information
received from the old AMF at step 5. It also indicates whether the PDU Session
is to be re-activated.
NOTE 10: If the UE moves into a different PLMN, the AMF in the serving PLMN
can insert or change the V-SMF(s) in the serving PLMN for Home Routed PDU
session(s). In addition, a V-SMF is removed if the UE moves from a VPLMN into
the HPLMN. In these cases, the same procedures described in clause 4.23.3 are
applied for the V-SMF change as for the I-SMF change (i.e. by replacing the
I-SMF with V-SMF). During inter-PLMN change, if the same SMF is used, session
continuity can be supported depending on operator policies.
Steps from step 5 onwards described in clause 4.2.3.2 are executed. In the
case that the intermediate UPF insertion, removal, or change is performed for
the PDU Session(s) not included in \"PDU Session(s) to be re-activated\", the
procedure is performed without N11 and N2 interactions to update the N3 user
plane between (R)AN and 5GC.
The AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation towards
the SMF in the following scenario:
\- If any PDU Session status indicates that it is released at the UE, the AMF
invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation towards the SMF
in order to release any network resources related to the PDU Session.
If the serving AMF is changed, the new AMF shall wait until step 18 is
finished with all the SMFs associated with the UE. Otherwise, steps 19 to 22
can continue in parallel to this step.
18\. [Conditional] If the new AMF and the old AMF are in the same PLMN, the
new AMF sends a UE Context Modification Request to N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF as
specified in TS 29.413 [64].
If the AMF has changed and the old AMF has indicated that the UE is in CM-
CONNECTED state via N3IWF, W-AGF or TNGF and if the new AMF and the old AMF
are in the same PLMN, the new AMF creates an NGAP UE association towards the
N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF to which the UE is connected. This automatically releases the
existing NGAP UE association between the old AMF and the N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF.
19\. N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF sends a UE Context Modification Response to the new AMF.
19a. [Conditional] After the new AMF receives the response message from the
N3IWF, W-AGF or TNGF in step 19, the new AMF registers with the UDM using
Nudm_UECM_Registration as step 14a, but with the Access Type set to \"non-3GPP
access\". The UDM stores the associated Access Type together with the serving
AMF and does not remove the AMF identity associated to the other Access Type
if any. The UDM may store in UDR information provided at the AMF registration
by Nudr_DM_Update.
19b. [Conditional] When the UDM stores the associated Access Type (i.e.
non-3GPP) together with the serving AMF as indicated in step 19a, it will
cause the UDM to initiate a Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification (see clause
5.2.3.2.2) to the old AMF corresponding to the same (i.e. non-3GPP) access.
The old AMF removes the UE context for non-3GPP access.
19c. The Old AMF unsubscribes with the UDM for subscription data using
Nudm_SDM_unsubscribe.
20a. Void.
21\. New AMF to UE: Registration Accept (5G-GUTI, Registration Area, [Mobility
restrictions], [PDU Session status], [Allowed NSSAI], [Mapping Of Allowed
NSSAI], [Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN], [Mapping Of Configured
NSSAI], [rejected S-NSSAIs], [Pending NSSAI], [Mapping Of Pending NSSAI],
[Periodic Registration Update timer], [Active Time], [Strictly Periodic
Registration Timer Indication], [LADN Information], [accepted MICO mode], [IMS
Voice over PS session supported Indication], [Emergency Service Support
indicator], [Accepted DRX parameters for E-UTRA and NR], [Accepted DRX
parameters for NB-IoT], [extended idle mode DRX parameters], [Paging Time
Window], [Network support of Interworking without N26], [Access Stratum
Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode], [Network Slicing Subscription
Change Indication], [Operator-defined access category definitions], [List of
equivalent PLMNs], [Enhanced Coverage Restricted information], [Supported
Network Behaviour], [Service Gap Time], [PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability
ID], [PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID deletion], [WUS Assistance
Information], [Truncated 5G-S-TMSI Configuration]).
If the Requested NSSAI does not include S-NSSAIs which map to S-NSSAIs of the
HPLMN subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization and
the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be provided in the Allowed NSSAI for
the UE in the current UE\'s Tracking Area and if no default S-NSSAI(s) not yet
involved in the current UE Registration procedure could be further considered,
the AMF shall reject the UE Registration and shall include in the rejection
message the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the appropriate
rejection cause value.
The Allowed NSSAI for the Access Type for the UE is included in the N2 message
carrying the Registration Accept message. The Allowed NSSAI contains only
S-NSSAIs that do not require, based on subscription information, Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization and, based on the UE Context
in the AMF, those S-NSSAIs for which Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization previously succeeded, regardless of the Access Type. The Mapping
Of Pending NSSAI is the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Pending NSSAI for the
Serving PLMN to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs.
If the UE has indicated its support for Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization procedure in the UE MM Core Network Capability in the
Registration Request, AMF includes in the Pending NSSAI the S-NSSAIs that map
to an S-NSSAI of the HPLMN which in the subscription information has
indication that it is subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization, as described in clause 4.6.2.4 of TS 24.501 [25]. In such case,
the AMF then shall trigger at step 25 the Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization procedure, specified in clause 4.2.9.2,
except, based on Network policies, for those S-NSSAIs for which Network Slice-
Specific Authentication and Authorization have already been initiated on
another Access Type for the same S-NSSAI(s). The UE shall not attempt re-
registration with the S-NSSAIs included in the list of Pending NSSAIs until
the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure has been
completed, regardless of the Access Type.
If the UE has not indicated its support for Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization procedure in the UE 5GMM Core Network
Capability in the Registration Request and the Requested NSSAI includes
S-NSSAIs which map to HPLMN S-NSSAIs subject to Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization, the AMF includes those S-NSSAIs in the
Requested NSSAI in the Rejected S-NSSAIs.
If no S-NSSAI can be provided in the Allowed NSSAI because:
\- all the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI are to be subject to Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization; or
\- no Requested NSSAI was provided or none of the S-NSSAIs in the Requested
NSSAI matches any of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs and all the S-NSSAI(s) marked as
default in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs are to be subject to Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization.
The AMF shall provide an empty Allowed NSSAI. Upon receiving an empty Allowed
NSSAI and a Pending NSSAI, the UE is registered in the PLMN but shall wait for
the completion of the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
procedure without attempting to use any service provided by the PLMN on any
access, except e.g. emergency services (see TS 24.501 [25]), until the UE
receives an Allowed NSSAI.
The AMF stores the NB-IoT Priority retrieved in Step 14 and associates it to
the 5G-S-TMSI allocated to the UE.
The AMF sends a Registration Accept message to the UE indicating that the
Registration Request has been accepted. 5G-GUTI is included if the AMF
allocates a new 5G-GUTI. Upon receiving a Registration Request message of type
\"Initial Registration\" or \"mobility registration update\" from the UE, the
AMF shall include a new 5G-GUTI in the Registration Accept message. Upon
receiving a Registration Request message of type \"periodic registration
update\" from the UE, the AMF should include a new 5G-GUTI in the Registration
Accept message. If the UE is already in RM-REGISTERED state via another access
in the same PLMN, the UE shall use the 5G-GUTI received in the Registration
Accept for both registrations. If no 5G-GUTI is included in the Registration
Accept, then the UE uses the 5G-GUTI assigned for the existing registration
also for the new registration. If the AMF allocates a new Registration area,
it shall send the Registration area to the UE via Registration Accept message.
If there is no Registration area included in the Registration Accept message,
the UE shall consider the old Registration Area as valid. Mobility
Restrictions is included if mobility restrictions applies for the UE and
Registration Type is not Emergency Registration. The AMF indicates the
established PDU Sessions to the UE in the PDU Session status. The UE removes
locally any internal resources related to PDU Sessions that are not marked as
established in the received PDU Session status. If the AMF invokes the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext procedure for UP activation of PDU Session(s)
in step 18 and receives rejection from the SMF, then the AMF indicates to the
UE the PDU Session ID and the cause why the User Plane resources were not
activated. When the UE is connected to the two AMFs belonging to different
PLMN via 3GPP access and non-3GPP access then the UE removes locally any
internal resources related to the PDU Session of the current PLMN that are not
marked as established in received PDU Session status. If the PDU Session
status information was in the Registration Request, the AMF shall indicate the
PDU Session status to the UE.
If the RAT Type is NB-IoT and the network is configured to use the Control
Plane Relocation Indication procedure then the AMF shall include in the
Registration Accept message the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI Configuration that the UE
using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation uses to create the Truncated 5G-S-
TMSI, see clause 5.31.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
The Allowed NSSAI provided in the Registration Accept is valid in the
Registration Area and it applies for all the PLMNs which have their Tracking
Areas included in the Registration Area. The Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI is the
mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Allowed NSSAI to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs. The
Mapping Of Configured NSSAI is the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Configured
NSSAI for the Serving PLMN to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs.
The AMF shall include in the Registration Accept message the LADN Information
for the list of LADNs, described in clause 5.6.5 of TS 23.501 [2], that are
available within the Registration area determined by the AMF for the UE. The
AMF may include Operator-defined access category definitions to let the UE
determinine the applicable Operator-specific access category definitions as
described in TS 24.501 [25].
If the UE included MICO mode in the Registration Request, then AMF responds in
the Registration Accept message whether MICO mode should be used. When MICO
mode is allowed for the UE, the AMF may include an Active Time value and/or
Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication in the Registration Accept
message. The AMF determines the Periodic Registration Update timer value,
Active Time value and the Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication
based on local configuration, Expected UE Behaviour if available, UE indicated
preferences, UE capability, UE subscription information and network policies,
or any combination of them so as to enable UE power saving, as described in
clause 5.31.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF determines to apply the Strictly
Periodic Registration Timer Indication to the UE if the UE indicates its
capability of the Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication in the
registration request message, as described in step 1. If the AMF provides the
Periodic Registration Update timer value with the Strictly Periodic
Registration Timer Indication to the UE, the UE and the AMF start the Periodic
Registration Update timer after this step, as described in clause 5.31.7.5 of
TS 23.501 [2].
In the case of registration over 3GPP access, the AMF Sets the IMS Voice over
PS session supported Indication as described in clause 5.16.3.2 of TS 23.501
[2]. In order to set the IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication the
AMF may need to perform the UE Capability Match Request procedure in clause
4.2.8a to check the compatibility of the UE and NG-RAN radio capabilities
related to IMS Voice over PS. If the AMF hasn\'t received Voice Support Match
Indicator from the NG-RAN on time then, based on implementation, AMF may set
IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication and update it at a later stage.
In the case of registration over non-3GPP access, the AMF Sets the IMS Voice
over PS session supported Indication as described in clause 5.16.3.2a of TS
23.501 [2].
The Emergency Service Support indicator informs the UE that emergency services
are supported, i.e. the UE is allowed to request PDU Session for emergency
services. If the AMF received \"MPS priority\" from the UDM as part of Access
and Mobility Subscription data, based on operator policy, \"MPS priority\" is
included in the Registration Accept message to the UE to inform the UE whether
configuration of Access Identity 1 is valid within the selected PLMN, as
specified in TS 24.501 [25]. If the AMF received \"MCX priority\" from the UDM
as part of Access and Mobility Subscription data, based on operator policy and
UE subscription to MCX Services, \"MCX priority\" is included in the
Registration Accept message to the UE to inform the UE whether configuration
of Access Identity 2 is valid within the selected PLMN, as specified in TS
24.501 [25]. The Accepted DRX parameters are defined in clause 5.4.5 of TS
23.501 [2]. The AMF includes Accepted DRX parameters for NB-IoT, if the UE
included Requested DRX parameters for NB-IoT in the Registration Request
message. The AMF Sets the Network support of Interworking without N26
parameter as described in clause 5.17.2.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the AMF
accepts the use of extended idle mode DRX, the AMF includes the extended idle
mode DRX parameters and Paging Time Window as described in 5.31.7.2 of TS
23.501 [2].
If the UDM intends to indicate the UE that subscription has changed, the
Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication is included. If the AMF
includes Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication, then the UE shall
locally erase all the network slicing configuration for all PLMNs and, if
applicable, update the configuration for the current PLMN based on any
received information.
The Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode, as specified
in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2], is included to instruct the UE on what
NSSAI, if any, to include in the Access Stratum connection establishment. The
AMF can set the value to modes of operation a,b,c defined in clause 5.15.9 of
TS 23.501 [2] in the 3GPP Access only if the Inclusion of NSSAI in RRC
Connection Establishment Allowed indicates that it is allowed to do so.
For a UE registered in a PLMN, the AMF may provide a List of equivalent PLMNs
which is handled as specified in TS 24.501 [25]. For a UE registered in an
SNPN, the AMF shall not provide a list of equivalent PLMNs to the UE.
If the UE included support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage in step
1, the AMF sends the Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to the NG-RAN in
N2 message. The AMF also sends Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to the
UE in the Registration Accept message.
If the UE receives Enhanced Coverage Restricted information in the
Registration Accept message, the UE shall store this information and shall use
the value of Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to determine if Enhanced
Coverage feature should be used or not.
If the UE and the AMF have negotiated to enable MICO mode and the AMF uses the
Extended connected timer, then the AMF provides the Extended Connected time
value to NG-RAN (see clause 5.31.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) in this step. The
Extended Connected Time value indicates the minimum time the RAN should keep
the UE in RRC-CONNECTED state regardless of inactivity.
The AMF indicates the CIoT 5GS Optimisations it supports and accepts in the
Supported Network Behaviour information (see clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2])
if the UE included Preferred Network Behaviour in its Registration Request.
The AMF may steer the UE from 5GC by rejecting the Registration Request. The
AMF should take into account the Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour
(see clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) and availability of EPC to the UE before
steering the UE from 5GC.
If the AMF accepts MICO mode and knows there may be mobile terminated data or
signalling pending, the AMF maintains the N2 connection for at least the
Extended Connected Time as described in clause 5.31.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and
provides the Extended Connected Time value to the RAN.
The AMF includes Service Gap Time if Service Gap Time is present in the
subscription information (steps 14a-c) or the Service Gap Time has been
updated by the Subscriber Data Update Notification to AMF procedure (see
clause 4.5.1) and the UE has indicated UE Service Gap Control Capability.
If the UE receives a Service Gap Time in the Registration Accept message, the
UE shall store this parameter and apply Service Gap Control (see clause
5.31.16 of TS 23.501 [2]).
If the network supports WUS grouping (see TS 23.501 [2]), the AMF shall send
the WUS Assistance Information to the UE. If the UE provided the UE paging
probability information in Step 1, the AMF takes it into account to determine
the WUS Assistance Information.
When the UE and the AMF supports RACS as defined in clause 5.4.4.1a of TS
23.501 [2] and the AMF needs to configure the UE with a UE Radio Capability ID
and the AMF already has the UE radio capabilities other than NB-IoT radio
capabilities for the UE, the AMF may provide the UE with the UE Radio
Capability ID for the UE radio capabilities the UCMF returns to the AMF in a
Nucmf_assign service operation for this UE. Alternatively, when the UE and the
AMF support RACS, the AMF may provide the UE with an indication to delete any
PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID in this PLMN (see clause 5.4.4.1a of TS
23.501 [2]).
If the UE is \"CAG supported\" and the AMF needs to update the CAG information
of the UE, the AMF may include the CAG information as part of the Mobility
Restrictions in the Registration Accept message.
21b. [Optional] The new AMF performs a UE Policy Association Establishment as
defined in clause 4.16.11. For an Emergency Registration, this step is
skipped.
The new AMF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Request to PCF. PCF sends a
Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response to the new AMF.
PCF triggers UE Configuration Update Procedure as defined in clause 4.2.4.3.
22\. [Conditional] UE to new AMF: Registration Complete ().
The UE sends a Registration Complete message to the AMF when it has
successfully updated itself after receiving any of the [Configured NSSAI for
the Serving PLMN], [Mapping Of Configured NSSAI] and a Network Slicing
Subscription Change Indication, or CAG information in step 21.
The UE sends a Registration Complete message to the AMF to acknowledge if a
new 5G-GUTI was assigned.
If new 5G-GUTI was assigned, then the UE passes the new 5G-GUTI to its 3GPP
access\' lower layer when a lower layer (either 3GPP access or non-3GPP
access) indicates to the UE\'s RM layer that the Registration Complete message
has been successfully transferred across the radio interface.
NOTE 11: The above is needed because the NG-RAN may use the RRC Inactive state
and a part of the 5G-GUTI is used to calculate the Paging Frame (see TS 38.304
[44] and TS 36.304 [43]). It is assumed that the Registration Complete is
reliably delivered to the AMF after the 5G-AN has acknowledged its receipt to
the UE.
When the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated is not included in the
Registration Request and the Registration procedure was not initiated in CM-
CONNECTED state, the AMF releases the signalling connection with UE, according
to clause 4.2.6.
When the Follow-on request is included in the Registration Request, the AMF
should not release the signalling connection after the completion of the
Registration procedure.
If the AMF is aware that some signalling is pending in the AMF or between the
UE and the 5GC, the AMF should not release the signalling connection
immediately after the completion of the Registration procedure.
If PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is included in step 21, the AMF stores
the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID in UE context if receiving
Registration Complete message.
If the UE receives PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID deletion indication in
step 21, the UE shall delete the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID(s) for
this PLMN.
23\. [Conditional] AMF to UDM: If the Access and Mobility Subscription data
provided by UDM to AMF in 14b includes Steering of Roaming information with an
indication that the UDM requests an acknowledgement of the reception of this
information from the UE, the AMF provides the UE acknowledgement to UDM using
Nudm_SDM_Info. For more details regarding the handling of Steering of Roaming
information refer to TS 23.122 [22].
23a. For Registration over 3GPP Access, if the AMF does not release the
signalling connection, the AMF sends the RRC Inactive Assistance Information
to the NG-RAN.
For Registration over non-3GPP Access, if the UE is also in CM-CONNECTED state
on 3GPP access, the AMF sends the RRC Inactive Assistance Information to the
NG-RAN.
The AMF also uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to provide an
acknowledgment to UDM that the UE received CAG information, or the Network
Slicing Subscription Change Indication (see step 21 and step 22) and acted
upon it.
24\. [Conditional] AMF to UDM: After step 14a and in parallel to any of the
preceding steps, the AMF shall send a \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over
PS Sessions\" indication to the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Update:
\- If the AMF has evaluated the support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions, see
clause 5.16.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2] and
\- If the AMF determines that it needs to update the Homogeneous Support of
IMS Voice over PS Sessions, see clause 5.16.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
25\. [Conditional] If the UE indicates its support for Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization procedure in the UE MM Core Network
Capability in Registration Request and any S-NSSAI of the HPLMN is subject to
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, the related procedure
is executed at this step (see clause 4.2.9.1). Once the Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization procedure is completed for all S-NSSAIs, the
AMF shall trigger a UE Configuration Update procedure to deliver an Allowed
NSSAI containing also the S-NSSAIs for which the Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization was successful and include any rejected
NSSAIs with an appropriate rejection cause value.
The AMF shall remove the mobility restriction if the Tracking Areas of the
Registration Area were previously assigned as a Non-Allowed Area due to
pending Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization.
The AMF stores an indication in the UE context for any S-NSSAI of the HPLMN
subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for which
the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization succeeds.
Once completed the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
procedure, if the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be provided in the
Allowed NSSAI for the UE, which is already authenticated and authorized
successfully by a PLMN and if no default S-NSSAI(s) could be further
considered, the AMF shall execute the Network-initiated Deregistration
procedure described in clause 4.2.2.3.3 and shall include in the explicit De-
Registration Request message the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with
the appropriate rejection cause value.
The mobility related event notifications towards the NF consumers are
triggered at the end of this procedure for cases as described in clause
4.15.4.
##### 4.2.2.2.3 Registration with AMF re-allocation
When an AMF receives a Registration request, the AMF may need to reroute the
Registration request to another AMF, e.g. when the initial AMF is not the
appropriate AMF to serve the UE. The Registration with AMF re-allocation
procedure, described in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, is used to reroute the NAS message
of the UE to the target AMF during a Registration procedure.
Figure 4.2.2.2.3-1: Registration with AMF re-allocation procedure
The initial AMF and the target AMF register their capability at the NRF.
1\. Steps 1 and 2 of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 have occurred and the (R)AN sends the
Registration request message within an Initial UE message to the initial AMF.
2\. If the AMF needs the SUPI and/or UE\'s subscription information to decide
whether to reroute the Registration Request or if the Registration Request was
not sent integrity protected or integrity protection is indicated as failed,
then AMF performs steps 4 to 9a or to 9b of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1.
3a. [Conditional] If the initial AMF needs UE\'s subscription information to
decide whether to reroute the Registration Request and UE\'s slice selection
subscription information was not provided by old AMF, the AMF selects a UDM as
described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2].
3b. Initial AMF to UDM: Nudm_SDM_Get (SUPI, Slice Selection Subscription
data).
The initial AMF request UE\'s Slice Selection Subscription data from UDM by
invoking the Nudm_SDM_Get (see clause 5.2.3.3.1) service operation. UDM may
get this information from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query(SUPI, Slice Selection
Subscription data).
3c. UDM to initial AMF: Response to Nudm_SDM_Get. The AMF gets the Slice
Selection Subscription data including Subscribed S-NSSAIs.
UDM responds with slice selection data to initial AMF.
4a. [Conditional] Initial AMF to NSSF: Nnssf_NSSelection_Get (Requested NSSAI,
[Mapping Of Requested NSSAI], Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) with the default S-NSSAI
indication, TAI, Allowed NSSAI for the other access type (if any), [Mapping of
Allowed NSSAI], PLMN ID of the SUPI).
If there is a need for slice selection, (see clause 5.15.5.2.1 of TS 23.501
[2]), e.g. the initial AMF cannot serve all the S-NSSAI(s) from the Requested
NSSAI permitted by the subscription information, the initial AMF invokes the
Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation from the NSSF by including Requested
NSSAI, optionally Mapping Of Requested NSSAI, Subscribed S-NSSAIs with the
default S-NSSAI indication, Allowed NSSAI for the other access type (if any),
Mapping of Allowed NSSAI, PLMN ID of the SUPI and the TAI of the UE.
4b. [Conditional] NSSF to Initial AMF: Response to Nnssf_NSSelection_Get (AMF
Set or list of AMF addresses, Allowed NSSAI for the first access type,
[Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI], [Allowed NSSAI for the second access type],
[Mapping of Allowed NSSAI], [NSI ID(s)], [NRF(s)], [List of rejected
(S-NSSAI(s), cause value(s))], [Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN],
[Mapping Of Configured NSSAI]).
The NSSF performs the steps specified in point (B) in clause 5.15.5.2.1 of TS
23.501 [2]. The NSSF returns to initial AMF the Allowed NSSAI for the first
access type, optionally the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI, the Allowed NSSAI for
the second access type (if any), optionally the Mapping of Allowed NSSAI and
the target AMF Set or, based on configuration, the list of candidate AMF(s).
The NSSF may return NSI ID(s) associated to the Network Slice instance(s)
corresponding to certain S-NSSAI(s). The NSSF may return the NRF(s) to be used
to select NFs/services within the selected Network Slice instance(s). It may
return also information regarding rejection causes for S-NSSAI(s) not included
in the Allowed NSSAI. The NSSF may return Configured NSSAI for the Serving
PLMN and possibly the associated mapping of the Configured NSSAI.
NOTE 1: The NRF(s) returned by the NSSF, if any, belong to any level of NRF
(see clause 6.2.6 of TS 23.501 [2]) according to the deployment decision of
the operator.
5\. [Conditional] Initial AMF to old AMF:
Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate (failure cause ).
If another AMF is selected, the initial AMF sends a reject indication to the
old AMF telling that the UE Registration procedure did not fully complete at
the initial AMF. The old AMF continues as if the
Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer had never been received.
6a. [Conditional] Initial AMF to NRF: Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (NF type, AMF
Set).
If the initial AMF does not locally store the target AMF address and if the
initial AMF intends to use direct reroute to target AMF or the reroute via
(NG-R)AN message needs to include AMF address, then the initial AMF invokes
the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request service operation from the NRF to find a proper
target AMF which has required NF capabilities to serve the UE. The NF type is
set to AMF. The AMF Set is included in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request.
6b. [Conditional] NRF to AMF: Response to Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (list of
(AMF pointer, AMF address, plus additional selection rules and NF
capabilities)).
The NRF replies with the list of potential target AMF(s). The NRF may also
provide the details of the services offered by the candidate AMF(s) along with
the notification end-point for each type of notification service that the
selected AMF had registered with the NRF, if available. As an alternative, it
provides a list of potential target AMFs and their capabilities and
optionally, additional selection rules. Based on the information about
registered NFs and required capabilities, a target AMF is selected by the
initial AMF.
If the security association has been established between the UE and initial
AMF, to avoid a registration failure, the initial AMF shall forward the NAS
message to the target AMF by executing step 7(A).
NOTE 2: The security context in the initial AMF is not transferred to the
target AMF if initial AMF forward the NAS message to the target AMF via (R)AN.
In this case the UE rejects the NAS message sent from target AMF as the
security context in the UE and target AMF are not synchronized.
NOTE 3: Network slice isolation cannot be completely maintained in case the
AMF reallocation is executed by step 7(A).
If the initial AMF is not part of the target AMF Set and is not able to get a
list of candidate AMF(s) by querying the NRF with the target AMF Set (e.g. the
NRF locally pre-configured on AMF does not provide the requested information,
the query to the appropriate NRF provided by the NSSF is not successful, or
the initial AMF has knowledge that the initial AMF is not authorized as
serving AMF etc.) then the initial AMF shall forward the NAS message to the
target AMF via (R)AN executing step 7(B) unless the security association has
been established between the UE and initial AMF; the Allowed NSSAI and the AMF
Set are included to enable the (R)AN to select the target AMF as described in
clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2].
7(A). If the initial AMF, based on local policy and subscription information,
decides to forward the NAS message to the target AMF directly, the initial AMF
invokes the Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify to the target AMF, carrying the
rerouted NAS message. The Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service operation
includes AN access information (e.g. the information enabling (R)AN to
identify the N2 terminating point, CAG Identifier(s) of the CAG cell) and the
full Registration Request message and the UE\'s SUPI and MM Context if
available. If the initial AMF has obtained the information from the NSSF as
described at step 4b, that information except the AMF Set or list of AMF
addresses is included. The target AMF then updates the (R)AN with a new
updated N2 termination point for the UE in the first message from target AMF
to RAN in step 8.
7(B). If the initial AMF, based on local policy and subscription information,
decides to forward the NAS message to the target AMF via (R)AN unless the
target AMF(s) are returned from the NSSF and identified by a list of candidate
AMF(s), the initial AMF sends a Reroute NAS message to the (R)AN (step 7a).
The Reroute NAS message includes the information about the target AMF and the
full Registration Request message. If the initial AMF has obtained the
information as described at step 4b, that information is included. The (R)AN
sends the Initial UE message to the target AMF (step 7b) indicating reroute
due to slicing including the information from step 4b that the NSSF provided.
8\. After receiving the Registration Request message transmitted at step 7(A)a
or step 7(B)b, the target AMF continues with the Registration procedure from
step 4 until 22 of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 (with the target AMF corresponding to
the new AMF), which includes the UE context retrieved from old AMF. If the 5G
security context is received from the initial AMF, the target AMF continue
using that one instead of the 5G security context retrieved from old AMF. If
the initial AMF decides to forward the NAS message to the target AMF (step
7(A), the first message from the target AMF to (R)AN (either Initial Context
Setup Request, or Downlink NAS Transport) contain the AMF name of the initial
AMF and target AMF UE NGAP ID.
#### 4.2.2.3 Deregistration procedures
##### 4.2.2.3.1 General
The Deregistration procedure allows:
\- the UE to inform the network that it does not want to access the 5GS any
longer and
\- the network to inform the UE that it does not have access to the 5GS any
longer.
The Deregistration request by the UE and Deregistration request by the network
include whether the Deregistration applies to the 3GPP access, to the non-3GPP
access, or to both. When the UE is registered to both accesses in the same
PLMN, the Deregistration message can be sent over any access regardless of the
access the Deregistration is applied to.
##### 4.2.2.3.2 UE-initiated Deregistration
The UE uses this procedure to deregister from the registered PLMN as shown in
Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1.
Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1: UE-initiated Deregistration
1\. The UE sends NAS message Deregistration Request (5G-GUTI, Deregistration
type (e.g. Switch off), Access Type) to the AMF.
Access type indicates whether the Deregistration procedure applies to the 3GPP
access, to the non-3GPP access, or to both if the 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access of the UE are served by the same AMF (refer to TS 23.501 [2]). The AMF
shall invoke the Deregistration procedure for the target access indicated by
the UE.
2\. [Conditional] AMF to SMF (or V-SMF): Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext (SM
Context ID).
If the UE has no established PDU Session over the target access indicated in
step 1, then steps 2 to 5 are not executed. All PDU Sessions over the target
access(es), which belong to the UE are released by the AMF sending
Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request (SM Context ID) message to the SMF
(or V-SMF) for each PDU Session. If the AMF determines that the secondary RAT
usage reporting is required for the PDU Session, the AMF shall execute step 7
and 8 and then wait for the completion of step 8 to receive the secondary RAT
usage data from the NG-RAN. After that, steps 2 to 6 in this procedure are
performed to e.g. release the PDU Session(s).
For home routed roaming case, the V-SMF initiates the release of the PDU
Session at the H-SMF by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_Release request.
3\. [Conditional] The SMF (or H-SMF) releases all resources e.g. the IP
address / Prefix(es) that were allocated to the PDU Session and releases the
corresponding User Plane resources:
3a. [Conditional] The SMF (or H-SMF) sends N4 Session Release Request (N4
Session ID) message to the UPF(s) of the PDU Session. The UPF(s) shall drop
any remaining packets of the PDU Session and release all tunnel resource and
contexts associated with the N4 Session.
3b. [Conditional] The UPF(s) acknowledges the N4 Session Release Request by
the transmission of an N4 Session Release Response (N4 Session ID) message to
the SMF.
4\. [Conditional] The SMF (or V-SMF) responds with
Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Response message.
For home routed roaming case, the H-SMF responds to the V-SMF with a
Nsmf_PDUSession_Release response. The V-SMF releases the corresponding User
Plane resources. The V-SMF responds to AMF with
Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Response message.
5a. [Conditional] If dynamic PCC applied to this session the SMF performs an
SM Policy Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.6.
5b-c. [Conditional] If it is the last PDU Session the SMF is handling for the
UE for the associated (DNN, S-NSSAI), the SMF unsubscribes from Session
Management Subscription data changes notification with the UDM by means of the
Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe service operation. The SMF invokes the
Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation so that the UDM removes the
association it had stored between the SMF identity and the associated DNN and
PDU Session Id.
6\. [Conditional] If there is any association with the PCF for this UE and the
UE is no more registered over any access, the AMF performs a AMF-initiated AM
Policy Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.3.2 delete
the association with the PCF.
6a. [Conditional] If there is any association with the PCF for this UE and the
UE is no more registered over any access, the AMF performs a AMF-initiated UE
Policy Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.13.1 delete
the association with the PCF.
7\. [Conditional] The AMF sends NAS message Deregistration Accept to UE
depending on the Deregistration type i.e. if Deregistration type is switch-
off, AMF does not send Deregistration Accept message.
8\. [Conditional] AMF to AN: N2 UE Context Release Request (Cause)
If the target access for Deregistration procedure is 3GPP access or both 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access and there is N2 signalling connection to NG-RAN,
the AMF sends N2 UE Release command to NG-RAN with Cause set to Deregistration
to release N2 signalling connection. The details of this step are covered by
steps 2 to 4 in the AN Release procedure, as described in clause 4.2.6.
If the target access for Deregistration procedure is non-3GPP access or both
3GPP access and non-3GPP access and there is N2 signalling connection to the
N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF, the AMF sends N2 UE Release command to N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF with
Cause set to Deregistration to release N2 signalling connection. The details
of this step are covered by steps 2 to 5 in the \"Deregistration procedure for
(un)trusted non-3gpp access\", as described in clauses 4.12.3 / 4.12a.3 and in
clause 7.2.1 of TS 23.316 [53] for W-5GAN access.
##### 4.2.2.3.3 Network-initiated Deregistration
The procedure depicted in Figure 4.2.2.3.3-1 shows Network-initiated
Deregistration procedure. The AMF can initiate this procedure for either
explicit (e.g. by O&M intervention or if the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI
can be provided in the Allowed NSSAI for the UE) or implicit (e.g. expiring of
Implicit Deregistration timer). The UDM can trigger this procedure for
operator-determined purposes to request the removal of a subscriber\'s RM
context and PDU Session(s) of the UE.
Figure 4.2.2.3.3-1: Network-initiated Deregistration
1\. [Conditional] If the UDM wants to request the immediate deletion of a
subscriber\'s RM contexts and PDU Sessions, the UDM shall send a
Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification (SUPI, Access Type, Removal Reason)
message with Removal Reason set to Subscription Withdrawn to the registered
AMF. The Access Type may indicate 3GPP Access, non-3GPP Access or both.
2\. If the AMF receives Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification in Step 1 with
Removal Reason as Subscription Withdrawn, the AMF executes Deregistration
procedure over the access(es) the Access Type indicates.
The AMF-initiated Deregistration procedure is either explicit (e.g. by O&M
intervention or if the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be provided in the
Allowed NSSAI for the UE) or implicit. The AMF does not send the
Deregistration Request message to the UE for Implicit Deregistration. If the
UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF may explicitly deregister the UE by
sending a Deregistration Request message (Deregistration type, Access Type,
[list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the appropriate rejection cause
value]) to the UE. The Deregistration type may be set to Re-registration in
which case the UE should re-register at the end of the Deregistration
procedure. Access Type indicates whether Deregistration procedure applies to
the 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, or both. If the Deregistration Request
message is sent over 3GPP access and the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP
access, the AMF pages the UE. The list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with
the appropriate rejection cause value, is provided if the AMF determines that
no S-NSSAI can be provided to the UE in the Allowed NSSAI.
If the UE has established PDU Session associated with emergency service, the
AMF shall not initiate Deregistration procedure. In this case, the AMF
performs network requested PDU Session Release for any PDU session associated
with non-emergency service as described in clause 4.3.4.
3\. [Conditional] If the Deregistration procedure is triggered by UDM (Step
1), the AMF acknowledges the Nudm_UECM_DeRegistrationNotification to the UDM.
If Access Type indicates 3GPP Access or non-3GPP Access and AMF does not have
UE context for another access type, or if Access Type indicates both, the AMF
unsubscribes with the UDM using Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe service operation.
4\. [Conditional] If the UE has any established PDU Session over the target
access for deregistration indicated in step 2, then step 2 \~ step 5 of UE-
initiated Deregistration procedure in clause 4.2.2.3.2 is performed.
5\. [Conditional] As in step 6 of Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1.
5a. [Conditional] As in step 6a of Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1.
6\. [Conditional] If the UE receives the Deregistration Request message from
the AMF in step 2, the UE sends a Deregistration Accept message to the AMF any
time after step 2. The NG-RAN forwards this NAS message to the AMF along with
the TAI+ Cell identity of the cell which the UE is using.
7\. [Conditional] AMF to AN: N2 UE Context Release Request (Cause): as in step
8 of Figure 4.2.2.3.2.
If the UE is deregistered over only 3GPP access or non-3GPP access and the AMF
does not have UE context for the other, or if the procedure applies to both
access types, then at any time, AMF can unsubscribe from the UDM, otherwise
the AMF can deregister from UDM using Nudm_UECM_Deregistration request by
indicating its associating access type.
### 4.2.3 Service Request procedures
#### 4.2.3.1 General
The Service Request procedure is used by a UE in CMâ€‘IDLE state or the 5GC to
request the establishment of a secure connection to an AMF. The Service
Request procedure is also used both when the UE is in CM-IDLE and in CM-
CONNECTED to activate a User Plane connection for an established PDU Session.
The UE shall not initiate a Service Request procedure if there is an ongoing
Service Request procedure.
#### 4.2.3.2 UE Triggered Service Request
The UE in CMâ€‘IDLE state initiates the Service Request procedure in order to
send uplink signalling messages, user data, to request emergency services
fallback, or as a response to a network paging request. The UE shall not
initiate UE Triggered Service Request from CM-IDLE if there is a Service Gap
timer running. After receiving the Service Request message, the AMF may
perform authentication. After the establishment of the signalling connection
to an AMF, the UE or network may send signalling messages, e.g. PDU Session
establishment from UE to the SMF, via the AMF.
The Service Request procedure is used by a UE in CM-CONNECTED to request
activation of a User Plane connection for PDU Sessions and to respond to a NAS
Notification message from the AMF. When a User Plane connection for a PDU
Session is activated, the AS layer in the UE indicates it to the NAS layer.
For any Service Request, the AMF responds with a Service Accept message to
synchronize PDU Session status between UE and network, if necessary. The AMF
responds with a Service Reject message to UE, if the Service Request cannot be
accepted by network. The AMF may steer the UE from 5GC by rejecting the
Service Request. The AMF should take into account the Preferred and Supported
Network Behaviour (see clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) and availability of EPC
to the UE before steering the UE from 5GC. The Service Reject message may
include an indication or cause code requesting the UE to perform Registration
procedure.
For this procedure, the impacted SMF and UPF, if any, are all under control of
the PLMN serving the UE, e.g. in Home Routed roaming case the SMF and UPF in
HPLMN are not involved if V-SMF relocation is not triggered.
For Service Request due to user data, network may take further actions if User
Plane connection activation is not successful.
The procedure in this clause 4.2.3.2 is applicable to the scenarios with or
without intermediate UPF and with or without intermediate UPF reselection.
If the UE initiates Service Request procedures via non-3GPP Access, functions
defined in the clause 4.12.4.1 are applied.
The User Plane of all PDU Sessions with redundant I-UPFs or with redundant
N3/N9 tunnels for URLLC shall be activated during the Service Request
procedure if the UE in CM-IDLE state initiates the Service Request procedure
from 3GPP access. If the redundant I-UPFs are to be added/replaced/removed,
the N4 Session procedure to manage the I-UPF is done for each I-UPF in steps
6c, 6d,7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9, 10, 17a,17b, 20a, 20b, 21a,21b, 22a and 22b of the
figure 4.2.3.2-1. If the redundant N3/N9 tunnels are used for URLLC and the
I-UPF is to be added/replaced/removed, the N4 Session procedure to update the
tunnel is done for each N3/N9 tunnel in steps 6c, 6d,7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9, 10,
17a, 17b. 20a, 20b, 21a and 21b of the figure 4.2.3.2-1.
Figure 4.2.3.2-1: UE Triggered Service Request procedure
1\. UE to (R)AN: AN message (AN parameters, Service Request (List Of PDU
Sessions To Be Activated, List Of Allowed PDU Sessions, security parameters,
PDU Session status, 5G-S-TMSI, [NAS message container], Exempt Indication)).
The NAS message container shall be included if the UE is sending a Service
Request message as an Initial NAS message and the UE needs to send non-
cleartext IEs, see clause 4.4.6 of TS 24.501 [25].
The List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated is provided by UE when the UE wants
to re-activate the PDU Session(s). The List Of Allowed PDU Sessions is
provided by the UE when the Service Request is a response of a Paging or a NAS
Notification for a PDU Session associated with non-3GPP access and identifies
the PDU Sessions that can be transferred to 3GPP access.
In the case of NG-RAN:
\- The AN parameters include 5G-S-TMSI, Selected PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID,
see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]), Establishment cause and may also include
NSSAI information. The Establishment cause provides the reason for requesting
the establishment of an RRC connection. Whether and how the UE includes the
NSSAI information as part of the AN parameters is dependent on the value of
the Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode parameter, as
specified in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2].
\- The UE sends Service Request message towards the AMF encapsulated in an RRC
message to the NG-RAN. The RRC message(s) that can be used to carry the 5G-S-
TMSI and this NAS message are described in TS 38.331 [12] and TS 36.331 [16].
If the Service Request is triggered by the UE for user data, the UE
identifies, using the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated, the PDU Session(s)
for which the UP connections are to be activated in Service Request message.
When the UE includes the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated, the UE shall
indicate PDU Sessions only associated with the access the Service Request is
related to. If the Service Request is triggered by the UE for signalling only,
the UE doesn\'t identify any List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. If this
procedure is triggered for paging response and the UE has at the same time
some user data to be transferred, the UE identifies the PDU Session(s) whose
UP connections are to be activated in Service Request message, by the List Of
PDU Sessions To Be Activated. Otherwise the UE does not identify any PDU
Session(s) in the Service Request message for paging response. As defined in
TS 24.501 [25] the UE shall include always-on PDU Sessions which are accepted
by the network in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated even if there are
no pending uplink data for those PDU Sessions or when the Service Request is
triggered for signalling only or when the Service Request is triggered for
paging response.
If the Service Request over 3GPP access is triggered in response to the paging
or NAS Notification indicating non-3GPP access, the Service Request message
shall identify the list of PDU Sessions associated with the non-3GPP access
that can be re-activated over 3GPP access in the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions,
as described in clause 4.2.3.3 (step 6) of this specification and in clause
5.6.8 of TS 23.501 [2]. When the UE over 3GPP access is in NB-N1 mode and the
resulting number of PDU Sessions with user plane resources activated for the
UE does not exceed the maximum number of supported user plane resources (0, 1
or 2), based on whether the UE supports UP data transfer and the UE\'s 5GMM
Core Network Capability as described in clause 5.31.19 of TS 23.501 [2], the
AMF shall notify the SMF that reactivation of the user-plane resources for the
corresponding PDU session(s) associated with non-3GPP access can be performed
as defined in TS 24.501 [25].
If the Service Request is triggered to report PS Data Off status change and
the UE is in Non-Allowed Area, the UE shall send Service Request message with
an indication that the message is exempted from restriction (e.g. Non-Allowed
Area). In this case, if the UE is in Non-Allowed Area, the UE shall not
include the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated and as a result the always-on
PDU Session is not re-activated during the Service Request procedure.
The PDU Session status indicates the PDU Sessions available in the UE.
The UE shall not trigger a Service Request procedure for a PDU Session
corresponding to a LADN when the UE is outside the area of availability of the
LADN.
NOTE 1: A PDU Session corresponding to a LADN is not included in the List Of
PDU Sessions To Be Activated when the UE is outside the area of availability
of the LADN.
For UE in CM-CONNECTED state, only the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated
and List Of Allowed PDU Sessions need to be included in the Service Request.
2\. (R)AN to AMF: N2 Message (N2 parameters, Service Request).
Details of this step are described in TS 38.413 [10]. If the AMF can\'t handle
the Service Request it will reject it.
When NG-RAN is used, the N2 parameters include the 5G-S-TMSI, Selected PLMN ID
(or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]), Location information
and Establishment cause, UE Context Request.
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the NG-RAN obtains the 5G-S-TMSI in RRC
procedure. NG-RAN selects the AMF according to 5G-S-TMSI. The Location
Information relates to the cell in which the UE is camping.
Based on the PDU Session status, the AMF may initiate PDU Session Release
procedure in the network for the PDU Sessions whose PDU Session ID(s) were
indicated by the UE as not available.
When the Establishment cause is associated with priority services (e.g. MPS,
MCS), the AMF includes a Message Priority header to indicate priority
information. Other NFs relay the priority information by including the Message
Priority header in service-based interfaces, as specified in TS 29.500 [17].
The AMF enforces the Mobility Restrictions as specified in clause 5.3.4.1.1 of
TS 23.501 [2].
If there is a Service Gap timer running in AMF for the UE and the AMF is not
waiting for a MT paging response from the UE and the Service Request is not
for regulatory prioritized services like Emergency services or not for
exception reporting, the AMF rejects the Service Request with an appropriate
cause. In addition, AMF may also provide a UE with a Mobility Management Back-
off timer set to the remaining value of the Service Gap timer.
If the AMF supports RACS and the AMF detects that the selected PLMN is
different from the currently registered PLMN for the UE, the AMF determines
the UE Radio Capability ID of the newly selected PLMN to the gNB as described
in clause 5.4.4.1a of TS 23.501 [2].
3a) AMF to (R)AN: N2 Request (security context, Mobility Restriction List,
list of recommended cells / TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers).
If the 5G-AN had requested for UE Context or there is a requirement for AMF to
provide this e.g. the AMF needs to initiate fallback procedure as in clause
4.13.4.2 for Emergency services, AMF initiates NGAP procedure as specified in
TS 38.413 [10]. For UE in CM-IDLE state, 5G-AN stores the Security Context in
the UE AN context. Mobility Restriction List is described in clause 5.3.4.1 of
TS 23.501 [2].
The 5G-AN uses the Security Context to protect the messages exchanged with the
UE as described in TS 33.501 [15].
If the NG-RAN node had provided the list of recommended cells / TAs / NG-RAN
node identifiers during the AN Release procedure (see clause 4.2.6), the AMF
shall include it in the N2 Request. The RAN may use this information to
allocate the RAN Notification Area when the RAN decides to enable RRC Inactive
state for the UE.
3\. If the Service Request was not sent integrity protected or integrity
protection verification failed, the AMF shall reject the Service Request as
stated in TS 24.501 [25].
If the UE in CM-IDLE state triggered the Service Request to establish a
signalling connection only, after successful establishment of the signalling
connection the UE and the network can exchange NAS signalling and steps 4 to
11 and 15 to 22 are skipped.
If the UE in Non-Allowed Area triggered the Service Request with an indication
that the message is exempted from restriction (e.g. Non-Allowed Area), the AMF
should accept the Service Request. In this case, if the UE is in Non-Allowed
Area, the AMF rejects user plane setup request from the SMF except for
emergency services.
If the procedure was triggered in response to paging or NAS notification
indicating non-3GPP access and the AMF received N1 SM Container only from the
SMF in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3, the AMF sends the NAS signalling including
the N1 SM Container to the UE in step 7 of clause 4.2.3.3 without updating the
access associated to the PDU Session.
4\. [Conditional] AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (PDU
Session ID(s), Operation Type, UE location information, Access Type, RAT Type,
UE presence in LADN service area, Indication of Access Type can be changed,
[MO Exception Data Counter]).
The Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request is invoked:
\- If the UE identifies List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated in the Service
Request message;
\- This procedure is triggered by the SMF but the PDU Session(s) identified by
the UE correlates to other PDU Session ID(s) than the one triggering the
procedure; or
\- If this procedure is triggered by the SMF in response to paging or NAS
notification indicating 3GPP access or if this step onwards is invoked
following step 4a of clause 4.2.3.3 and the current UE location is outside the
\"Area of validity for the N2 SM information\" provided by the SMF in step 3a
of clause 4.2.3.3 or the \"Area of validity for the N2 SM information\" was
not provided by the SMF in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3, the AMF shall not send
the N2 information provided by the SMF in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3.
Otherwise, if the current UE location is in the \"Area of validity for the N2
SM information\", steps 4 to 11 are skipped; or
\- If this procedure is triggered by the SMF in response to paging or NAS
notification indicating non-3GPP access and the AMF received N2 SM Information
only, or both N1 SM Container and N2 SM Information in step 3a of clause
4.2.3.3.
If the DNN corresponds to an LADN then the \"UE presence in LADN service
area\" indicates if the UE is IN or OUT of the LADN service area. If the AMF
does not provide the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication and the
SMF determines that the DNN corresponds to a LADN, then the SMF considers that
the UE is OUT of the LADN service area.
The AMF determines the PDU Session(s) for which the UP connection(s) shall be
activated and sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request to SMF(s)
associated with the PDU Session(s) with Operation Type set to \"UP activate\"
to indicate establishment of User Plane resources for the PDU Session(s). The
AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type, see clause 4.2.2.2.1. If the RAT type
is NB-IoT, the AMF shall ensure that the number of PDU session(s) for which UP
connection(s) are active does not exceed this UE\'s maximum number of
supported user plane resources (0, 1 or 2) based on whether the UE supports UP
data transfer and the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability as described in clause
5.31.19 of TS 23.501 [2].
If the procedure was triggered in response to paging or NAS Notification
indicating non-3GPP access, the AMF received N2 SM Information in step 3a of
clause 4.2.3.3 and the PDU Session for which the UE was paged or notified is
not in the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions provided by the UE, the AMF notifies
the SMF that the UE is not reachable. For other PDU Sessions in the List Of
Allowed PDU Sessions the Service Request Procedure succeeds without re-
activating the User Plane of any PDU Sessions, unless they have also been
included by the UE in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated.
If the procedure was triggered in response to paging or NAS notification
indicating non-3GPP access and the PDU Session for which the UE was paged or
notified is in the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions provided by the UE and the AMF
received N2 SM Information only or N1 SM Container and N2 SM Information from
the SMF in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3, the AMF notifies the SMF that the access
type of the PDU session can be changed. The AMF discards any already received
N1 SM Container and N2 SM Information. In Home Routed roaming case, the V-SMF
triggers Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation towards the H-SMF to notify
the access type of the PDU Session can be changed and the procedure continues
as specified in clause 4.3.3.3 from step 1a to step 10.
If the UE is accessing via the NB-IoT RAT, the AMF may inform all (H-)SMFs
whether the RRC establishment cause is set to \"MO exception data\", as
described in clause 5.31.14.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF may immediately send
the MO Exception Data Counter to the (H-)SMF.
The AMF may receive a Service Request to establish another NAS signalling
connection via a new NG-RAN while it has maintained an old NAS signalling
connection for UE still via an old NG-RAN. The new NG-RAN and the old NG-RAN
can be the same NG-RAN node. In this case, AMF shall trigger the AN release
procedure toward the old NG-RAN to release the old NAS signalling connection
as defined in clause 4.2.6 and:
\- For the PDU Sessions indicated by the UE in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be
Activated, the AMF requests the SMF to activate the PDU Session(s) immediately
by performing this step 4; and
NOTE 2: This activates the UP of PDU Session(s) using resources of the new NG-
RAN.
\- For the PDU Sessions indicated by the old NG-RAN in the \"List of PDU
Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane\" but not in the List Of PDU Sessions
To Be Activated sent by the UE, the AMF requests the SMF to deactivate the PDU
Session(s).
NOTE 3: This deactivates the UP of PDU Session(s) that are no more needed by
the UE.
5a. Void.
5b. If the PDU Session ID corresponds to a LADN and the SMF determines that
the UE is outside the area of availability of the LADN based on the \"UE
presence in LADN service area\" from the AMF, the SMF decides to (based on
local policies) either:
\- keep the PDU Session, but reject the activation of User Plane connection
for the PDU Session and inform the AMF about it. If the procedure has been
triggered by a Network Triggered Service Request as described in clause
4.3.2.3, the SMF may notify the UPF that originated the Data Notification to
discard downlink data for the PDU Sessions and/or to not provide further Data
Notification messages; or
\- to release the PDU Session: the SMF releases the PDU Session and informs
the AMF that the PDU Session is released.
In any case of the two cases above the SMF answers to the AMF (step10) with an
appropriate reject cause and the User Plane Activation of PDU Session is
stopped.
Otherwise, based on the location info received from the AMF, the SMF checks
the UPF Selection Criteria according to clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and
determines to perform one of the following:
\- accepts the activation of UP connection and continue using the current
UPF(s);
\- accepts the activation of UP connection and selects a new intermediate UPF
(or add/remove an intermediate UPF), if the UE has moved out of the service
area of the UPF that was previously connecting to the AN, while maintaining
the UPF(s) acting as PDU Session Anchor. The steps to perform I-UPF
addition/change/removal are described as conditional steps in the following of
the current procedure; or
NOTE 4: If the old and/or new I-UPF implements an UL CL or BP functionality
and a PDU Session Anchor for connectivity to the local access to the Data
Network as described in clause 5.6.4.2 of TS 23.501 [2], the signalling
described in the current clause is intended as the signalling to add, remove
or change the PDU Session Anchor and must be complemented by the signalling to
add, release or change the UL CL or BP as described respectively in clauses
4.3.5.4, 4.3.5.5 and 4.3.5.7.
\- rejects the activation of UP connection of a PDU Session of SSC mode 2 and
trigger re-establishment of the PDU Session after Service Request procedure to
perform the allocation of a new UPF to act as PDU Session Anchor, e.g. the UE
has moved out of the service area of the anchor UPF which is connecting to NG-
RAN.
In the case that the SMF fails to find suitable I-UPF, the SMF decides to
(based on local policies) either:
\- trigger re-establishment of PDU Session. After Service Request procedure,
SMF sends N1 SM message to the UE via the AMF by invoking
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer containing the cause indicating PDU
Session re-establishment is required for the UE; or
\- keep the PDU Session, but reject the activation request of User Plane
connection for the PDU Session and inform the AMF about it; or
\- release the PDU Session after Service Request procedure.
If the SMF has determined that the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to or
from the NB-IoT RAT then the SMF uses the \"PDU Session continuity at inter
RAT mobility\" to determine how to handle the PDU Session.
6a. [Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.
Depending on the network deployment, the CN Tunnel Info of UPF (PSA) allocated
for N3 or N9 interface may be changed during the Service Request procedure,
e.g. UPF connected to different IP domains. If different CN Tunnel Info need
be used, the SMF sends N4 Session Modification Request message to UPF (PSA)
and requests CN Tunnel Info providing the target Network Instance.
6b. [Conditional] UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
The UPF (PSA) sends an N4 Session Establishment Response message to the SMF.
The UPF provides CN Tunnel Info to the SMF. The UPF (PSA) associate the CN
Tunnel Info with UL Packet detection rules provided by the SMF.
If the redundant I-UPFs are used for URLLC, each I-UPF provides UL CN Tunnel
Info for N3 interface to the SMF in the N4 Session Establishment Response
message.
If the redundant N3 tunnels are used for URLLC, the UPF (PSA) provides
redundant UL CN Tunnel Info for N3 interface to the SMF in N4 Session
Establishment Response message.
6c. [Conditional] SMF to new UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Establishment
Request.
If the SMF selects a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF for the PDU Session,
or if the SMF selects to insert an intermediate UPF for a PDU Session which
did not have an intermediate UPF, an N4 Session Establishment Request message
is sent to the new UPF, providing Packet detection, Data forwarding,
enforcement and reporting rules to be installed on the intermediate UPF. The
CN Tunnel Info (on N9) of PSA, i.e. which is used to establish the N9 tunnel,
for this PDU Session is also provided to the intermediate UPF.
If a new UPF is selected by the SMF to replace the old (intermediate) UPF, the
SMF may also include a request for the new UPF to allocate a second tunnel
endpoint for buffered DL data from the old I-UPF and to indicate via usage
reporting end marker reception on this second tunnel. In this case, the UPF is
instructed by the SMF to buffer the DL data it may receive at the same time
from the UPF (PSA).
6d. New UPF (intermediate) to SMF: N4 Session Establishment Response.
The new intermediate UPF sends an N4 Session Establishment Response message to
the SMF. The UPF provides DL CN Tunnel Info as requested by SMF in step 6c.
The SMF starts a timer, to be used in step 22a to release the resource in old
intermediate UPF if there is one.
7a. [Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.
If the SMF selects a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF for the PDU Session,
the SMF sends N4 Session Modification Request message to PDU Session Anchor
UPF, providing DL Tunnel Info from new intermediate UPF. If the new
intermediate UPF was added for the PDU Session, the UPF (PSA) begins to send
the DL data to the new I-UPF as indicated in the DL CN Tunnel Info. The UPF
(PSA) sends one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N9 tunnel to the old
I-UPF immediately after switching the path to new I-UPF.
If the Service Request is triggered by the network and the SMF removes the old
I-UPF but does not replace it with a new I-UPF, the SMF may also include a
request for the UPF to allocate a second tunnel endpoint for buffered DL data
from the old I-UPF and to indicate end marker reception on this second tunnel
via usage reporting. In this case, the UPF (PSA) begins to buffer the DL data
it may receive at the same time from the N6 interface. The UPF (PSA) sends one
or more \"end marker\" packets for each N9 tunnel to the old I-UPF immediately
after switching the path to (R)AN.
7b. The UPF (PSA) sends N4 Session Modification Response message to SMF.
If requested by SMF, the UPF (PSA) sends DL CN tunnel info for the old
(intermediate) UPF to the SMF. The SMF starts a timer, to be used in step 22a
to release the resource in old intermediate UPF if there is one.
If the UPF that connects to RAN is the UPF (PSA) and if the SMF finds that the
PDU Session is activated when receiving the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
Request in step 4 with Operation Type set to \"UP activate\" to indicate
establishment of User Plane resources for the PDU Session(s), it deletes the
AN Tunnel Info and initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure to remove
Tunnel Info of AN in the UPF.
8a. [Conditional] SMF to old UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Modification
Request (New UPF address, New UPF DL Tunnel ID)
If the service request is triggered by the network and the SMF removes the old
(intermediate) UPF, the SMF sends the N4 Session Modification Request message
to the old (intermediate) UPF, providing the DL Tunnel Info for the buffered
DL data. If the SMF allocated new I-UPF, the DL Tunnel Info is from the new
(intermediate) UPF acting as N3 terminating point. If the SMF did not allocate
a new I-UPF, the DL Tunnel Info is from the new UPF (PSA) acting as N3
terminating point. The SMF starts a timer to monitor the forwarding tunnel as
step 6d or 7b.
If the old I-UPF receives end marker packets and there is no associated tunnel
to forward these packets, the old I-UPF discards the received end marker
packets and does not send any Data Notification to SMF.
If the SMF find the PDU Session is activated when receiving the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request in step 4 with Operation Type set to
\"UP activate\" to indicate establishment of User Plane resources for the PDU
Session(s), it deletes the AN Tunnel Info and initiates an N4 Session
Modification procedure to remove Tunnel Info of AN in the UPF.
8b. old UPF (intermediate) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response
The old (intermediate) UPF sends N4 Session Modification Response message to
SMF.
9\. [Conditional] old UPF (intermediate) to new UPF (intermediate): buffered
downlink data forwarding
If the I-UPF is changed and forwarding tunnel was established to the new
I-UPF, the old (intermediate) UPF forwards its buffered data to the new
(intermediate) UPF acting as N3 terminating point. If indicated by SMF in step
6c, the new I-UPF reports to SMF when end marker packet is received. Then the
SMF initiates N4 Session Modification procedure to indicate the new I-UPF to
send the buffered downlink packet(s) received from the UPF (PSA).
10\. [Conditional] old UPF (intermediate) to UPF (PSA): buffered downlink data
forwarding
If the old I-UPF is removed and no new I-UPF is assigned for the PDU Session
and forwarding tunnel was established to the UPF (PSA), the old (intermediate)
UPF forwards its buffered data to the UPF (PSA) acting as N3 Terminating
Point. If indicated by SMF in step 7a, the UPF (PSA) reports to SMF when the
end marker packet has been received. Then the SMF initiates N4 Session
Modification procedure to request the UPF (PSA) to send the buffered DL data
received from the N6 interface.
11\. [Conditional] SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (N2 SM
information (PDU Session ID, QFI(s), QoS profile(s), CN N3 Tunnel Info,
S-NSSAI, User Plane Security Enforcement, UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data
Rate, RSN), N1 SM Container, Cause) to the AMF. If the UPF that connects to
RAN is the UPF (PSA), the N3 CN Tunnel Info is the UL CN Tunnel Info of the
UPF (PSA). If the UPF that connects to RAN is the new intermediate UPF, the CN
N3 Tunnel Info is the UL Tunnel Info of the intermediate UPF.
For the PDU Session with redundant I-UPFs or with redundant N3 tunnels for
URLLC, the two UL N3 CN Tunnel Info are included, the SMF also indicates the
NG-RAN that one of the CN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the
PDU session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
The SMF shall send N1 SM Container and/or N2 SM Information to the AMF when
applicable. (e.g. when the SMF was notified from the AMF that the access type
of the PDU Session can be changed in step 4).
For a PDU Session that the SMF has determined to accept the activation of UP
connection in step 5a or 5b, the SMF generates only N2 SM information and
sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response to the AMF to establish the
User Plane(s). The N2 SM information contains information that the AMF shall
provide to the NG-RAN. The SMF may indicate for each QoS Flow whether
redundant transmission shall be performed by a corresponding redundant
transmission indicator. If the SMF decided to change the PSA UPF for the SSC
mode 3 PDU Session, the SMF triggers the change of SSC mode 3 PDU Session
anchor as an independent procedure described in clause 4.3.5.2 or clause
4.3.5.3 after accepting the activation of UP of the PDU Session.
The SMF can reject the activation of UP of the PDU Session by including a
cause in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response. Following are some of
the cases:
\- If the PDU Session corresponds to a LADN and the UE is outside the area of
availability of the LADN as described in step 5b;
\- If the AMF notified the SMF that the UE is reachable only for regulatory
prioritized service and the PDU Session to be activated is not for a
regulatory prioritized service; or
\- If the SMF decided to change the PSA UPF for the requested PDU Session as
described in step 5b. In this case, after sending
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response, the SMF triggers another procedure
to instruct UE to re-establish the PDU Session as described in clause 4.3.5.1
for SSC mode 2.
\- If the SMF received negative response in Step 6b due to UPF resource
unavailability.
If the PDU Session has been assigned any EPS bearer ID, the SMF also includes
the mapping between EPS bearer ID(s) and QFI(s) into the N2 SM information to
be sent to the NG-RAN.
The User Plane Security Enforcement information is determined by the SMF upon
PDU session establishment as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If
the User Plane Security Enforcement information indicates that Integrity
Protection is \"Preferred\" or \"Required\", the SMF also includes the UE
Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate.
The RSN is included when applicable, as determined by the SMF during PDU
Session establishment as described in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
12\. AMF to (R)AN: N2 Request (N2 SM information received from SMF, security
context, Mobility Restriction List, UE-AMBR, MM NAS Service Accept, list of
recommended cells / TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers, UE Radio Capability, Core
Network Assistance Information, Tracing Requirements, UE Radio Capability ID).
The Allowed NSSAI for the Access Type for the UE is included in the N2
message. If the subscription information includes Tracing Requirements, the
AMF includes Tracing Requirements in the N2 Request.
If the UE triggered the Service Request while in CM-CONNECTED state, only N2
SM information received from SMF and MM NAS Service Accept are included in the
N2 Request.
If the Service Request procedure is triggered by the Network (as described in
clause 4.2.3.3) while the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, only N2 SM information
received from SMF is included in the N2 Request.
If the Service Request procedure is triggered by the Network (as described in
clause 4.2.3.3) while the UE is in CM-IDLE state, only N2 SM information
received from SMF and MM NAS Service Accept is included in the N2 Request.
For a UE that was in CM-IDLE state when the Service Request was triggered, the
NG-RAN stores the Security Context. If the Service Request is not triggered by
UE for a signalling connection only, RAN also stores QoS Information for the
QoS Flows of the PDU Sessions that are activated and N3 Tunnel IDs in the UE
RAN context and Mobility Restriction List (as described in clause 5.3.4.1 of
TS 23.501 [2]).
MM NAS Service Accept includes PDU Session status in AMF. Any local PDU
Session Release during the Session Request procedure is indicated to the UE
via the Session Status. PDU Session Reactivation Result is provided in Service
Accept for the PDU sessions in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated and
the PDU Session in the List of Allowed PDU Sessions which has caused paging or
NAS notification. If the PDU Session Reactivation Result of a PDU Session is
failure, the cause of the failure is also provided.
If there are multiple PDU Sessions that involves multiple SMFs, AMF does not
need to wait for responses from all SMFs in step 11 before it sends N2 SM
information to the RAN. However, the AMF shall wait for all responses from the
SMFs before it sends MM NAS Service Accept message to the UE.
AMF shall include at least one N2 SM information from SMF if this step is
triggered for PDU Session User Plane activation. AMF may send additional N2 SM
information from SMFs in separate N2 message(s) (e.g. N2 tunnel setup
request), if there is any. Alternatively, if multiple SMFs are involved, the
AMF may send one N2 Request message to (R)AN after all the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response service operations from all the SMFs
associated with the UE are received.
If the NG-RAN node had provided the list of recommended cells / TAs / NG-RAN
node identifiers during the AN Release procedure (see clause 4.2.6), the AMF
shall include it in the N2 Request. The NG-RAN may use this information to
allocate the RAN Notification Area when the NG-RAN decides to enable RRC
Inactive state for the UE.
The AMF includes the UE\'s \"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\" as defined
in clause 5.3.3.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2].
If the NG-RAN node does not support RACS and the AMF have UE Radio Capability
ID but not the UE Radio Capability information, then AMF will use
Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement_Resolve to try to retrieve the corresponding UE
Radio Capability information.
If the NG-RAN node does not support RACS, or the AMF does not have UE Radio
Capability ID in UE context, the AMF shall include the UE Radio Capability
information, if available, to the NG-RAN node as described in TS 23.501 [2].
If the RAT Type is NB-IoT then NB-IoT specific UE Radio Access Capability
Information is included instead, if available.
If AMF has UE Radio Capability ID in UE context valid for the PLMN the UE is
currently in and the NG-RAN supports RACS, the AMF signals the UE Radio
Capability ID. If the NG-RAN node does not have mapping between the UE Radio
Capability ID and the corresponding UE radio capabilities, it shall use the
non-UE associated procedure described in TS 38.413 [10] to retrieve the
mapping from the AMF.
The AMF may include the Core Network Assistance Information which includes
Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning and Core Network assisted RAN
paging information as defined in TS 23.501 [2].
If the UE included support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage, the
AMF sends Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to the (R)AN in the N2
message.
If the UE and the AMF have negotiated to enable MICO mode and the AMF uses the
Extended connected timer, then the AMF provides the Extended Connected time
value to NG-RAN (see clause 5.31.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) in this step. The
Extended Connected Time value indicates the minimum time the RAN should keep
the UE in RRC-CONNECTED state regardless of inactivity.
If the AMF accepted MICO mode in the last registration procedure and knows
there may be mobile terminated data or signalling pending, the AMF maintains
the N2 connection for at least the Extended Connected Time as described in
clause 5.31.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and provides the Extended Connected Time
value to the RAN in N2 message with Service Accept message. The RAN should
keep the UE in RRC-CONNECTED state for an Extended Connected Time period in
order to ensure the downlink data and/or signalling is delivered to the UE.
If the RAN receives two CN Tunnel Info for a PDU session in step 11 for
redundant transmission, RAN also allocates two AN Tunnel Info correspondingly
and indicate to SMF one of the AN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel
of the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
13\. (R)AN to UE: The NG-RAN performs RRC Connection Reconfiguration with the
UE depending on the QoS Information for all the QoS Flows of the PDU Sessions
whose UP connections are activated and Data Radio Bearers. For a UE that was
in CM-IDLE state, if the Service Request is not triggered by UE for a
signalling connection only, the User Plane security is established at this
step, which is described in detail in TS 38.331 [12] and TS 36.331 [16]. For a
UE that was in CM-IDLE state, if the Service Request is triggered by UE for a
signalling connection only, AS security context may be established in this
step, which is described in detail in TS 38.331 [12] and TS 36.331 [16].
If the N2 Request includes a NAS message, the NG-RAN forwards the NAS message
to the UE. The UE locally deletes context of PDU Sessions that are not
available in 5GC.
NOTE 5: The reception of the Service Accept message does not imply the
successful activation of the User Plane radio resources.
NOTE 6: If not all the requested User Plane AN resources are successfully
activated, see TS 38.413 [10].
After the User Plane radio resources are setup, the uplink data from the UE
can now be forwarded to NG-RAN. The NG-RAN sends the uplink data to the UPF
address and Tunnel ID provided in the step 11.
If the NG-RAN can not establish redundant user plane for the PDU Session as
indicated by the RSN parameter, the NG-RAN takes the decision on how to
proceed with the PDU Session as described in TS 23.501 [2].
14\. [Conditional] (R)AN to AMF: N2 Request Ack (List of PDU Sessions To Be
Established with N2 SM information (AN Tunnel Info, List of accepted QoS Flows
for the PDU Sessions whose UP connections are activated, List of rejected QoS
Flows for the PDU Sessions whose UP connections are activated), List of PDU
Sessions that failed to be established with the failure cause given in the N2
SM information element).
The message may include N2 SM information(s), e.g. AN Tunnel Info. NG-RAN may
respond N2 SM information with separate N2 message (e.g. N2 tunnel setup
response) if AMF sends separate N2 message in step 11.
If multiple N2 SM information are included in the N2 Request message in step
12, the N2 Request Ack includes multiple N2 SM information and information to
enable the AMF to associate the responses to relevant SMF.
15\. [Conditional] AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (N2 SM
information, RAT Type, Access Type) per PDU Session to the SMF. The AMF
determines Access Type and RAT Type, see clause 4.2.2.2.1.
If the AMF received N2 SM information (one or multiple) in step 14, then the
AMF shall forward the N2 SM information to the relevant SMF per PDU Session
ID. If the UE Time Zone has changed compared to the last reported UE Time Zone
then the AMF shall include the UE Time Zone IE in this message.
If the PDU Session is moved from the non-3GPP access to 3GPP access (i.e. N3
tunnel for the PDU Session is established successfully), the SMF and AMF
update associated access of the PDU Session. The UE updates associated access
of the PDU Session when the user plane resource for the PDU Session is
successfully established.
Procedure for unpausing a charging pause initiated earlier is specified in
clause 4.4.4.
If a PDU Session is rejected by the serving NG-RAN with an indication that the
PDU Session was rejected because User Plane Security Enforcement is not
supported in the serving NG-RAN and the User Plane Enforcement Policy
indicates \"Required\" as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF
shall trigger the release of this PDU Session. In all other cases of PDU
Session rejection, the SMF can decide whether to release the PDU Session or to
deactivate the UP connection of this PDU Session.
If some of the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are not accepted by the serving NG-
RAN, the SMF shall initiate the PDU Session Modification procedure to remove
the non-accepted QoS Flows from the PDU Session after this procedure is
completed.
16\. [Optional] SMF to PCF: If dynamic PCC is deployed and if Policy Control
Request Trigger condition(s) have been met (e.g. change of Access Type, change
of UE location), SMF performs SMF initiated SM Policy Modification procedure
as defined in clause 4.16.5.1. The PCF may provide updated policies.
17a. [Conditional] SMF to new intermediate UPF: N4 Session Modification
Request (AN Tunnel Info and List of accepted QFI(s)).
If the SMF selected a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF for the PDU Session
in step 5b, the SMF initiates a N4 Session Modification procedure to the new
I-UPF and provides AN Tunnel Info. The Downlink Data from the new I-UPF can
now be forwarded to NG-RAN and UE.
17b. [Conditional] UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
18a. [Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request (AN
Tunnel Info, List of rejected QoS Flows).
If a User Plane is to be setup or modified and after the modification there is
no I-UPF, the SMF initiates a N4 Session Modification procedure to UPF (PSA)
and provides AN Tunnel Info. The Downlink Data from the UPF (PSA) can now be
forwarded to NG-RAN and UE.
For QoS Flows in the List of rejected QoS Flows, the SMF shall instruct the
UPF to remove the rules (e.g. Packet Detection Rules etc.) which are
associated with the QoS Flows.
If SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for one or more QoS Flows of
the PDU, the SMF also indicates the UPF (PSA) to perform packet duplication
for the QoS Flow(s) in downlink direction by forwarding rules.
If the PCC rule(s) are updated in step 16, the SMF may initiate a N4 Session
Modification procedure to UPF (PSA) based on the updated PCC rule(s).
18b. [Conditional] UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
19\. [Conditional] SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response.
20a. [Conditional] SMF to new UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Modification
Request.
If forwarding tunnel has been established to the new I-UPF and if the timer
SMF set for forwarding tunnel at step 8a has expired, SMF sends N4 Session
modification request to new (intermediate) UPF acting as N3 terminating point
to release the forwarding tunnel.
20b. [Conditional] new UPF (intermediate) to SMF: N4 Session modification
response.
New (intermediate) UPF acting as N3 terminating point sends N4 Session
Modification response to SMF.
21a. [Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.
If forwarding tunnel has been established to the UPF (PSA) and if the timer
SMF set for forwarding tunnel at step 7b has expired, SMF sends N4 Session
modification request to UPF (PSA) acting as N3 Terminating Point to release
the forwarding tunnel.
21b. [Conditional] UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
UPF (PSA) acting as N3 Terminating Point sends N4 Session Modification
Response to SMF.
22a. [Conditional] SMF to old UPF: N4 Session Modification Request or N4
Session Release Request.
If the SMF decided to continue using the old UPF in step 5b, the SMF sends an
N4 Session Modification Request, providing AN Tunnel Info.
If the SMF decided to select a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF in step 5b
and the old UPF is not PSA UPF, the SMF initiates resource release, after
timer in step 6b or 7b expires, by sending an N4 Session Release Request
(Release Cause) to the old intermediate UPF.
22b. [Conditional] Old intermediate UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification
Response or N4 Session Release Response.
The old UPF acknowledges with an N4 Session Modification Response or N4
Session Release Response message to confirm the modification or release of
resources.
For the mobility related events described in clause 4.15.4, the AMF invokes
the Namf_EventExposure_Notify service operation after step 4.
Upon reception of the Namf_EventExposure_Notify with an indication that the UE
is reachable, if the SMF has pending DL data the SMF invokes the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation to the AMF to
establish the User Plane(s) for the PDU Sessions, otherwise the SMF resumes
sending DL data notifications to the AMF in the case of DL data.
Upon reception of the Namf_EventExposure_Notify with an indication that UE is
reachable only for regulatory prioritized service, the SMF deactivates the PDU
Session if the service of the PDU Session is not regulatory prioritized. For
home routed roaming case, the V-SMF triggers the deactivation of the PDU
Session, in addition, the H-SMF refrains from sending downlink signalling if
the signalling is not related to regulatory prioritized service upon receiving
the notification.
#### 4.2.3.3 Network Triggered Service Request
This procedure is used when the network needs to signal (e.g. N1 signalling to
UE, Mobile-terminated SMS, User Plane connection activation for PDU Session(s)
to deliver mobile terminating user data) with a UE. When the procedure is
triggered by SMSF, PCF, LMF, GMLC, NEF or UDM, the SMF in the following figure
should be replaced by the respective NF. If the UE is in CMâ€‘IDLE state or CM-
CONNECTED state in 3GPP access, the network initiates a Network Triggered
Service Request procedure. If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and asynchronous type
communication is not activated, the network sends a Paging Request to
(R)AN/UE. The Paging Request triggers the UE Triggered Service Request
procedure in the UE. If asynchronous type communication is activated, the
network stores the received message and forward the message to the (R)AN
and/or the UE (i.e. synchronizes the context with the (R)AN and/or the UE)
when the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state.
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state in non-3GPP access and if the UE is
simultaneously registered over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in a PLMN, the
network shall initiate a Network Triggered Service Request procedure over 3GPP
access.
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access and in CM-CONNECTED state in
non-3GPP access and if the UE is simultaneously registered over 3GPP and
non-3GPP accesses in the same PLMN, the network may initiate a Network
Triggered Service Request procedure for 3GPP access via non-3GPP access.
For this procedure, the impacted SMF and UPF are all under control of the PLMN
serving the UE, e.g. in Home Routed roaming case the SMF and UPF in HPLMN are
not involved.
The procedure below covers the following non exhaustive list of use-cases for
3GPP access (detailed conditions of when the steps apply are stated in the
procedure below):
\- The SMF needs to setup N3 tunnel to deliver downlink packet to the UE for a
PDU Session and the UE is in CM-IDLE state: Step 3a contains an N2 message and
Step 4b (paging) is performed.
\- The SMF needs to setup N3 tunnel to deliver downlink packet to the UE for a
PDU Session and the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state: Step 3a contains an N2
message and Step 4a (UP reactivation) is performed.
\- NF (e.g. SMF, SMSF, PCF or LMF) needs to send an N1 message to the UE,
using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation and the UE
is in CM-IDLE state: Step 3a contains an N1 message, Step 3b contains cause
\"Attempting to reach UE\" and Step 4b (paging) occurs.
\- The LMF triggers AMF, using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
service operation, to setup a NAS connection with the UE and the UE is in CM-
IDLE state: Step 3b contains cause \"Attempting to reach UE\" and step 4b
(paging) occurs.
\- The GMLC triggers AMF, using the Namf_Location_ProvideLocation service
operation, to setup a NAS connection with the UE and the UE is in CM-IDLE
state: Step 4b (paging) occurs.
\- The PCF needs to send a message to the UE, using the
Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Create Response service operation, or the
Npcf_AMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service operation and the UE is in CM-IDLE
state: Step 3a contains a message and step 4b (paging) occurs.
\- NF (e.g. SMSF or SMF) triggers AMF, using the Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability
service operation, to setup a NAS connection with the UE and the UE is in CM-
IDLE state: The trigger is specific to the procedure and Step 4b (paging)
occurs.
Figure 4.2.3.3-1: Network Triggered Service Request
1\. When a UPF receives downlink data for a PDU Session and there is no AN
Tunnel Info stored in UPF for the PDU Session, based on the instruction from
the SMF (as described in clause 5.8.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), the UPF may buffer
the downlink data (steps 2a and 2b), or forward the downlink data to the SMF
(step 2c).
2a. UPF to SMF: Data Notification (N4 Session ID, Information to identify the
QoS Flow for the DL data packet, DSCP).
\- On arrival of the first downlink data packet for any QoS Flow, the UPF
shall send Data Notification message to the SMF, if the SMF has not previously
notified the UPF to not send the Data Notification to the SMF (in which case
the next steps are skipped).
\- If the UPF receives downlink data packets for another QoS Flow in the same
PDU Session, the UPF shall send another Data Notification message to the SMF.
\- If the Paging Policy Differentiation feature (as specified in clause 5.4.3
of TS 23.501 [2]) is supported by the UPF and if the PDU Session type is IP,
the UPF shall also include the DSCP in TOS (IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value from the
IP header of the downlink data packet and the information to identify the QoS
Flow for the DL data packet.
2b. SMF to UPF: Data Notification Ack.
2c. The UPF forwards the downlink data packets towards the SMF if the SMF
instructed the UPF to do so (i.e. the SMF will buffer the data packets).
\- If the Paging Policy Differentiation feature is supported by the SMF and if
the PDU Session type is IP, the SMF determines the Paging Policy Indicator
based on the DSCP in TOS (IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value from the IP header of the
received downlink data packet and identifies the corresponding QoS Flow from
the QFI of the received DL data packet.
3a. [Conditional] SMF to AMF: Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (SUPI,
PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (SM message), N2 SM information (QFI(s), QoS
profile(s), CN N3 Tunnel Info, S-NSSAI), Area of validity for N2 SM
information, ARP, Paging Policy Indicator, 5QI, N1N2TransferFailure
Notification Target Address, Extended Buffering support), or NF to AMF:
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (SUPI, N1 message).
The SMF shall not include both N1 SM Container and N2 SM Information in
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer unless the N1 SM Container is related
to the N2 SM Information.
If this step is triggered by a notification from UPF, upon reception of a Data
Notification message, for a PDU Session corresponding to a LADN, the SMF takes
actions as specified in clause 5.6.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF may notify the
UPF that originated the Data Notification to discard downlink data for the PDU
Sessions and/or to not provide further Data Notification messages.
Otherwise, the SMF determines whether to contact the AMF. The SMF does not
contact the AMF:
\- if the SMF had previously been notified that the UE is unreachable; or
\- if the UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service and the PDU
Session is not for regulatory prioritized service.
The SMF determines the AMF and invokes the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to the AMF including the PDU Session ID
of the PDU Session. If this step is triggered by a notification from the UPF
in step 2a, the SMF determines the PDU Session ID based on the N4 Session ID
received in step 2a.
The SMF determines whether Extended Buffering applies based on local policy
and the capability of the SMF (for SMF-based buffering) or the capability of
the UPF (for UPF-based buffering). If Extended Buffering applies, the SMF
includes \"Extended Buffering support\" indication in
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.
If the SMF, while waiting for the User Plane Connection to be activated,
receives any additional Data Notification message or, in the case that the SMF
buffers the data packets, additional data packets for a QoS Flow associated
with a higher priority (i.e. ARP priority level) than the priority indicated
to the AMF in the previous Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, or the SMF
derive a different Paging Policy Indicator according to the additional Data
Notification or the DSCP of the data packet, the SMF invokes a new
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer indicating the higher priority or
different Paging Policy Indicator to the AMF.
If the SMF, while waiting for the User Plane to be activated, receives a
message from a new AMF other than the one to which the SMF invoked
theNamf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, the SMF re-invokes the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer towards the new AMF.
When supporting Paging Policy Differentiation, the SMF determines the Paging
Policy Indicator related to the downlink data that has been received from the
UPF or triggered the Data Notification message, based on the DSCP as described
in clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and indicates the Paging Policy Indicator in
the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.
NOTE 1: AMF may receive request message(s) from other network functions which
leads to signalling towards UE/RAN, e.g. Network-initiated Deregistration, SMF
initiated PDU Session Modification. If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state and the
AMF only delivers N1 message towards UE, the flow continues in step 6 below.
The N2 SM information is optional and is not provided e.g. in the case that
the SMF only wants to send an N1 message such as PDU Session Modification
Command with only updating the UE with a PCO.
3b. [conditional] The AMF responds to the SMF.
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state at the AMF and the AMF is able to page the UE
the AMF sends a Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response to the SMF
immediately to indicate to the SMF that AMF is attempting to reach UE and the
N2 SM information provided in step 3a, may be ignored by the AMF once the UE
is reachable and the SMF may be asked to provide the N2 SM information again.
While waiting for the UE to respond to a previous paging request, if the AMF
receives an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Request message with the
same or a lower priority than the previous message triggering the paging, or
if the AMF has determined not to trigger additional paging requests for this
UE based on local policy, the AMF rejects the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Request message.
If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state at the AMF then the AMF sends a
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response to the SMF immediately to
indicate that the N1/N2 message has been sent out.
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and the AMF determines that the UE is not
reachable for paging, the AMF shall send an
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response to the NF from which AMF
received the request message in step 3a to indicate that the UE is not
reachable, or the AMF performs asynchronous type communication and stores the
UE context based on the received message, it shall send an
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response to indicate that asynchronous
type communication is invoked. If asynchronous type communication is invoked,
the AMF initiates communication with the UE and (R)AN when the UE is reachable
e.g. when the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state.
If the AMF has determined the UE is unreachable for the SMF (e.g. due to the
UE in MICO mode, the UE using extended idle mode DRX or the UE is only
registered over non-3GPP access and its state is CM-IDLE), then the AMF
rejects the request from the SMF. The AMF may include in the reject message an
indication that the SMF need not trigger the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Request to the AMF, if the SMF has not
subscribed to the event of the UE reachability. If the SMF included the
Extended Buffering Support indication, the AMF indicates the Estimated Maximum
Wait time, in the reject message, for the SMF to determine the Extended
Buffering time. If the UE is in MICO mode, the AMF determines the Estimated
Maximum Wait time based on the next expected periodic registration by the UE
or by implementation. If the UE is using extended idle mode DRX, the AMF
determines the Estimated Maximum Wait time based on the start of the next
Paging Time Window. The AMF stores an indication that the SMF has been
informed that the UE is unreachable.
If the AMF has determined the UE is reachable and the AMF detects the UE is in
a Non-Allowed Area unless the request from the SMF is for regulatory
prioritized service, the AMF rejects the request from the SMF and notifies the
SMF that the UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service. The AMF
stores an indication that the SMF has been informed that the UE is reachable
only for regulatory prioritized service.
If the Registration procedure with AMF change is in progress when the old AMF
receives the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, the old AMF may reject
the request with an indication that the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
has been temporarily rejected.
Upon reception of an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response with an
indication that its request has been temporarily rejected, the SMF shall start
a locally configured guard timer and wait for any message to come from an AMF.
Upon reception of a message from an AMF, the SMF shall re-invoke the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (with N2 SM info and/or N1 SM info) to
the AMF from which it received the message. Otherwise the SMF takes the step
3c at expiry of the guard timer. If the SMF decides that the control plane
buffering applies, the SMF shall request UPF to start forwarding the downlink
data PDU towards the SMF.
3c. [Conditional] SMF responds to the UPF
SMF may notify the UPF about the User Plane setup failure.
If the SMF receives an indication from the AMF that the UE is unreachable or
reachable only for regulatory prioritized service and the SMF determines that
Extended Buffering does not apply, the SMF may, based on network policies,
either:
\- indicate to the UPF to stop sending Data Notifications;
\- indicate to the UPF to stop buffering DL data and discard the buffered
data;
\- indicate to the UPF to stop sending Data Notifications and stop buffering
DL data and discard the buffered data; or
\- refrains from sending further Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
message for DL data to the AMF while the UE is unreachable.
Then the SMF subscribes to the AMF for UE reachability event notifications.
Based on operator policies, the SMF applies the pause of charging procedure as
specified in clause 4.4.4.
If the SMF receives an indication from the AMF that the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message requested from an SMF has been
temporarily rejected, the SMF may, based on network policies, indicate to the
UPF to apply temporary buffering.
If the SMF receives an \"Estimated Maximum Wait time\" from the AMF and
Extended Buffering applies, the SMF may either:
\- If the DL data buffering in the SMF applies, store the DL Data for an
Extended Buffering time. The SMF does not send any additional
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message if subsequent downlink data
packets are received. If the Extended Buffering timer expires, the SMF
discards the buffered downlink data.
\- If the DL data buffering in the UPF applies, send a Failure indication with
an indication to the UPF to buffer the DL data with an Extended Buffering time
and optionally a DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count. The Suggested Number of
Downlink Packets network configuration parameter (if available) may be used to
derive the value for DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count. The SMF may also
indicate to the UPF to stop sending Data Notifications.
The Extended Buffering time is determined by the SMF and should be larger or
equal to the Estimated Maximum Wait time received from the AMF.
If the UPF receives an Extended Buffering indication from the SMF, the UPF
initiates Extended Buffering of the downlink data and starts an Extended
Buffering timer. If the Extended Buffering timer expires, the UPF discards the
buffered downlink data.
4a. [Conditional] If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state in the access associated
with the PDU Session ID received from the SMF in step 3a, the steps 4 to 22 in
UE Triggered Service Request procedure (see clause 4.2.3.2) are performed for
this PDU Session (i.e. establish the radio resources and, in the case that the
User Plane is to be activated, to establish the N3 tunnel) without sending a
Paging message to the (R)AN node and the UE. In step 12 of clause 4.2.3.2, the
AMF does not send the NAS Service Accept message to the UE. The rest of this
procedure is omitted.
4b. [Conditional] If the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access and the PDU
Session ID received from the SMF in step 3a has been associated with 3GPP
access and based on local policy the AMF decides to notify the UE through 3GPP
access even when UE is in CM-CONNECTED state for non-3GPP access, the AMF may
send a Paging message to NG-RAN node(s) via 3GPP access.
If the UE is simultaneously registered over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in the
same PLMN, the UE is in CM-IDLE state in both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access
and the PDU Session ID in step 3a is associated with non-3GPP access, the AMF
sends a Paging message with associated access \"non-3GPP\" to NG-RAN node(s)
via 3GPP access.
If the UE is in RM-REGISTERED state and CM-IDLE and reachable in 3GPP access,
the AMF sends a Paging message (NAS ID for paging, Registration Area list,
Paging DRX length, Paging Priority, access associated to the PDU Session,
Enhanced Coverage Restricted information, WUS Assistance Information) to (R)AN
node(s) belonging to the Registration Area(s) in which the UE is registered,
then the NG-RAN node pages the UE, including the access associated to the PDU
Session in the paging message if received from the AMF, see TS 38.331 [12]. If
extended idle mode DRX was accepted by the AMF in the last registration
procedure, the AMF includes extended idle mode DRX cycle length and Paging
Time Window in the Paging message. The AMF shall ensure that the correct
Paging DRX length is provided based on the accepted UE Specific DRX of the
current RAT.
NOTE 2: The usage of the Access associated with a PDU Session when paging an
UE is defined in clause 5.6.8 of TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE 3: This step is performed also when the UE and the network support User
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation and the previous RRC connection has been
suspended.
Different paging strategies may be configured in the AMF for different
combinations of DNN, Paging Policy Indicator (if supported), ARP and 5QI.
For RRC-inactive state, the paging strategies may be configured in the (R)AN
for different combinations of Paging Policy Indicator, ARP and 5QI.
Paging Priority is included only:
\- if the AMF receives an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message with
an ARP value associated with priority services (e.g. MPS, MCS), as configured
by the operator.
\- One Paging Priority level can be used for multiple ARP values. The mapping
of ARP values to Paging Priority level (or levels) is configured by operator
policy in the AMF and in NG-RAN.
The (R)AN may prioritise the paging of UEs according to the Paging Priority.
If the AMF, while waiting for a UE response to the Paging Request message sent
without Paging Priority, receives an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
message, which indicates an ARP value associated with priority services (e.g.
MPS, MCS), as configured by the operator, the AMF shall send another paging
message with the suitable Paging Priority. For subsequent received
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer messages with the same or higher
priority, the AMF may determine whether to send the Paging message with
suitable Paging Priority based on local policy.
Paging strategies may include:
\- paging retransmission scheme (e.g. how frequently the paging is repeated or
with what time interval);
\- determining whether to send the Paging message to the (R)AN nodes during
certain AMF high load conditions;
\- whether to apply sub-area based paging (e.g. first page in the last known
cell-id or TA and retransmission in all registered TAs).
NOTE 4: Setting of Paging Priority in the Paging message is independent from
any paging strategy.
The AMF and the (R)AN may support further paging optimisations in order to
reduce the signalling load and the network resources used to successfully page
a UE by one or several of the following means:
\- by the AMF implementing specific paging strategies (e.g. the N2 Paging
message is sent to the (R)AN nodes that served the UE last);
\- by the AMF considering Information On Recommended Cells And NG-RAN nodes
provided by the (R)AN at transition to CM-IDLE state. The AMF takes the (R)AN
nodes related part of this information into account to determine the (R)AN
nodes to be paged and provides the information on recommended cells within the
N2 Paging message to each of these (R)AN nodes;
\- by the (R)AN considering the Paging Attempt Count Information provided by
the AMF at paging.
If the UE Radio Capability for Paging Information is available in the AMF, the
AMF adds the UE Radio Capability for Paging Information in the N2 Paging
message to the (R)AN nodes.
If the Information On Recommended Cells And (R)AN nodes For Paging is
available in the AMF, the AMF shall take that information into account to
determine the (R)AN nodes for paging and, when paging a (R)AN node, the AMF
may transparently convey the information on recommended cells to the (R)AN
node.
The AMF may include in the N2 Paging message(s) the paging attempt count
information. The paging attempt count information shall be the same for all
(R)AN nodes selected by the AMF for paging.
If the AMF has Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE stored in the UE
Context in AMF and Enhanced Coverage is not restricted for the UE then the AMF
shall include Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE in the N2 paging
message for all NG-RAN nodes selected by the AMF for paging.
The AMF may include in the N2 Paging message(s) the WUS Assistance
Information, if available. If the WUS Assistance Information is included by
the N2 Paging message, the NG-eNB takes it into account when paging the UE
(see TS 36.300 [46]).
The AMF may include in the N2 paging message the PLMN ID(s) of Serving PLMN
and equivalent PLMN(s) supported by NG-RAN and corresponding CAG information
per PLMN ID which including an Allowed CAG list and optionally an indication
whether the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells, if available. If
the above information is included in N2 paging message, the NG-RAN node may
take it into account when determining the cells where paging will be performed
(see TS 38.413 [10]).
If the UE and NG-eNB support WUS, then:
\- if the NGAP Paging message contains the _Assistance Data for Recommended
Cells_ IE (see TS 38.413 [10]), the NG-eNB shall only broadcast the UE\'s Wake
Up Signal in the last used cell;
\- else (i.e. the _Assistance Data for Recommended Cells_ IE is not included
in the NGAP Paging message) the eNodeB should not broadcast the UE\'s Wake Up
Signal.
4c. [Conditional] If the UE is simultaneously registered over 3GPP and
non-3GPP accesses in the same PLMN and the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state in 3GPP
access and the PDU Session ID in step 3a is associated with non-3GPP access,
the AMF sends a NAS Notification message containing the non-3GPP Access Type
to the UE over 3GPP access and sets a Notification timer. Step 5 is omitted.
If the UE is simultaneously registered over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in the
same PLMN and the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state for non-3GPP access and in CM-
IDLE for 3GPP access and if the PDU Session ID in step 3a is associated with
3GPP access and based on local policy the AMF decides to notify the UE through
non-3GPP access, the AMF may send a NAS Notification message containing the
3GPP Access Type to the UE over non-3GPP access and sets a Notification timer.
NOTE 5: This step is performed also when the UE and the network support User
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation in 3GPP access and the previous RRC connection has
been suspended.
5\. [Conditional] AMF to SMF: Namf_Communication_N1N2Transfer Failure
Notification.
The AMF supervises the paging procedure with a timer. If the AMF receives no
response from the UE to the Paging Request message, the AMF may apply further
paging according to any applicable paging strategy described in step 4b.
The AMF notifies the SMF by sending Namf_Communications_N1N2MessageTransfer
Failure Notification to the Notification Target Address provided by the SMF in
step 3a if the UE does not respond to paging, unless the AMF is aware of an
ongoing MM procedure that prevents the UE from responding, i.e. the AMF
receives an N14 Context Request message indicating that the UE performs
Registration procedure with another AMF.
When a Namf_Communication_N1N2Transfer Failure Notification is received, SMF
informs the UPF (if applicable).
Procedure for pause of charging at SMF is specified in clause 4.4.4.
6\. If the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access, upon reception of paging
request for a PDU Session associated to 3GPP access, the UE shall initiate the
UE Triggered Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2) or, if the UE is
enabled to use User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation and there is suspended access
stratum context stored in the UE, the UE initiates the Connection Resume in
CM-IDLE with Suspend procedure (clause 4.8.2.3). To support the buffered data
forwarding, the SMF instruct the UPF to establish a Data forwarding tunnel
between the old UPF and the new UPF or to the PSA as described at steps 6a,
7a, 8a of clause 4.2.3.2.
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state in both non-3GPP and 3GPP accesses, upon
reception of paging request for a PDU Session associated to non-3GPP access,
the UE shall initiate the UE Triggered Service Request procedure (clause
4.2.3.2) which shall contain the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions that, according
to UE policies and whether the S-NSSAIs of these PDU Sessions are within the
Allowed NSSAI for 3GPP access, can be re-activated over the 3GPP access. If
there is no PDU Session that can be re-activated over the 3GPP access, the UE
includes an empty List Of Allowed PDU Sessions. If the AMF receives a Service
Request message from the UE via non-3GPP access as described in clause
4.12.4.1 (e.g. because the UE successfully connects to a non-3GPP access), the
AMF stops the paging procedure and processes the received Service Request
procedure. If the AMF receives the Service Request message and the List Of
Allowed PDU Sessions provided by the UE does not include the PDU Session for
which the UE was paged, the AMF notifies the SMF that the UE was reachable but
did not accept to re-activate the PDU Session by invoking
Namf_EventExposure_Notify service as described in step 4 of clause 4.2.3.2.
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state in non-3GPP access and in CM-CONNECTED state in
3GPP access, upon reception of NAS Notification message over 3GPP access
containing the non-3GPP Access Type, the UE shall initiate the UE Triggered
Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2) with the List Of Allowed PDU
Sessions that, according to UE policies and whether the S-NSSAIs of these PDU
Sessions are within the Allowed NSSAI for 3GPP access, can be re-activated
over the 3GPP access. If there is no PDU Session that can be re-activated over
the 3GPP access, the UE include an empty List Of Allowed PDU Sessions. When
the AMF receives the Service Request message and the List of Allowed PDU
Sessions provided by the UE does not include the PDU Session for which the UE
was notified, the AMF notifies the SMF that the UE was reachable but did not
accept to re-activate the PDU Session by invoking Namf_EventExposure_Notify
service. If the AMF receives a Service Request message from the UE via
non-3GPP access as described in clause 4.12.4.1 (e.g. because the UE
successfully connects to a non-3GPP access), the AMF stops the Notification
timer and processes the received Service Request procedure.
\- Alternatively, if the UE is in CM-IDLE state in non-3GPP access with the
Mobility Management back-off timer running, upon reception of Paging Message
over 3GPP access containing the non-3GPP Access Type, the UE on stopping the
back-off timer (for both accesses), shall initiate the UE Triggered Service
Request procedure (clause 4.12.4.1) over non-3GPP access if non-3GPP access is
available. When the AMF receives a Service Request message from the UE via
non-3GPP access, the AMF stops the Paging timer and processes the received
Service Request.
NOTE 6: A scenario where the UE is CM-IDLE over non-3GPP access and yet
non-3GPP access is available, is when the UE over the non-3GPP access is
running the Mobility Management back-off timer and network has released the
NAS signalling connection upon service reject.
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access and in CM-CONNECTED state in
non-3GPP access, upon reception of NAS Notification message over non-3GPP
access identifying the 3GPP access type, the UE shall initiate the UE
triggered Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2) over the 3GPP access when
3GPP access is available. If the AMF does not receive the Service Request
message before Notification timer expires, the AMF may either page the UE
through 3GPP access or notify the SMF that the UE was not able to re-activate
the PDU Session.
The User Plane of all PDU Sessions for URLLC shall be activated during the
Service Request procedure if the UE initiates the Service Request from 3GPP
access in CM-IDLE state as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
7\. If the AMF has paged the UE to trigger the Service Request Procedure, the
AMF shall initiate the UE configuration update procedure as defined in clause
4.2.4.2 to assign a new 5G-GUTI.
8\. The UPF transmits the buffered downlink data toward UE via (R)AN node
which performed the Service Request procedure. If data is buffered in the SMF,
the SMF delivers buffered downlink data to the UPF.
The network also sends downlink signalling to the UE if the procedure is
triggered due to request from other NFs, as described in step 3a.
### 4.2.4 UE Configuration Update
#### 4.2.4.1 General
UE configuration may be updated by the network at any time using UE
Configuration Update procedure. UE configuration includes:
\- Access and Mobility Management related parameters decided and provided by
the AMF. This includes the Configured NSSAI and its mapping to the Subscribed
S-NSSAIs, the Allowed NSSAI and its mapping to Subscribed S-NSSAIs, the
Service Gap time, the list of Rejected NSSAIs if the UE Configuration Update
procedure is triggered by the AMF after Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization of S-NSSAIs, the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI Configuration. If the
UE and the AMF support RACS, this may also include a PLMN-assigned UE Radio
Capability ID or alternatively a PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID deletion
indication.
\- UE Policy provided by the PCF.
When AMF wants to change the UE configuration for access and mobility
management related parameters the AMF initiates the procedure defined in
clause 4.2.4.2. When the PCF wants to change or provide new UE Policies in the
UE, the PCF initiates the procedure defined in clause 4.2.4.3.
If the UE Configuration Update procedure requires the UE to initiate a
Registration procedure, the AMF indicates this to the UE explicitly.
The procedure in clause 4.2.4.2 may be triggered also when the AAA Server that
performed Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for an
S-NSSAI revokes the authorization.
#### 4.2.4.2 UE Configuration Update procedure for access and mobility
management related parameters
This procedure is initiated by the AMF when the AMF wants to update access and
mobility management related parameters in the UE configuration.
This procedure is also used to trigger UE to perform, based on network
indication, either Mobility Registration Update procedure while the UE is in
CM-CONNECTED state to modify NAS parameters that require negotiation (e.g.
MICO mode) or to steer the UE towards EPC as specified in clause 5.31.3 of TS
23.501 [2], or Mobility Registration Update procedure after the UE enters CM-
IDLE state (e.g. for changes to Allowed NSSAI that require re-registration).
If a Registration procedure is needed, the AMF provides an indication to the
UE to initiate a Registration procedure.
UE Configuration Update shall be sent over the Access Type (i.e. 3GPP access
or non-3GPP access) the UE Configuration Update is applied to, when
applicable. If the AMF wants to update NAS parameters in the UE which require
UE acknowledgement, then the AMF provides an indication to the UE of whether
the UE shall acknowledge the command or not. The AMF should not request
acknowledgement of the NITZ command. The AMF shall request acknowledgement for
NSSAI information (e.g. Allowed NSSAI), 5G-GUTI, TAI List and Mobility
Restrictions, LADN Information, MICO, Operator-defined access category
definitions, PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID and SMS subscription.
Figure 4.2.4.2-1: UE Configuration Update procedure for access and mobility
management related parameters
0\. AMF determines the necessity of UE configuration change due to various
reasons (e.g. UE mobility change, NW policy, reception of Subscriber Data
Update Notification from UDM, change of Network Slice configuration, need to
assign PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID, change of Enhanced Coverage
Restriction information in the UE context) or that the UE needs to perform a
Registration Procedure. If a UE is in CM-IDLE, the AMF can wait until the UE
is in CM-CONNECTED state or triggers Network Triggered Service Request (in
clause 4.2.3.3).
NOTE 1: It is up to the network implementation whether the AMF can wait until
the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state or trigger the Network Triggered Service
Request.
NOTE 2: The AMF can check whether Network Slice configuration needs to be
updated by using the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation and in such case
the AMF compares the stored information with the output from the NSSF to
decide whether an update of the UE is required.
The AMF may include Mobility Restriction List in N2 message that delivers UE
Configuration Update Command to the UE if the service area restriction for the
UE is updated.
1\. The AMF sends UE Configuration Update Command containing one or more UE
parameters (Configuration Update Indication, 5G-GUTI, TAI List, Allowed NSSAI,
Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI, Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN, Mapping Of
Configured NSSAI, rejected S-NSSAIs, NITZ, Mobility Restrictions, LADN
Information, MICO, Operator-defined access category definitions, SMS
Subscribed Indication, [PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID], [PLMN-assigned
UE Radio Capability ID deletion indication]) to UE. Optionally, the AMF may
update the rejected S-NSSAIs in the UE Configuration Update command.
The AMF includes one or more of 5G-GUTI, TAI List, Allowed NSSAI, Mapping Of
Allowed NSSAI, Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN, Mapping Of Configured
NSSAI, rejected S-NSSAIs, NITZ (Network Identity and Time Zone), Mobility
Restrictions parameters, LADN Information, Operator-defined access category
definitions, PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID, or SMS Subscribed
Indication if the AMF wants to update these NAS parameters without triggering
a UE Registration procedure.
The AMF may include in the UE Configuration Update Command also Configuration
Update Indication parameters indicating whether:
\- Network Slicing Subscription Change has occurred;
\- the UE shall acknowledge the command; and
\- whether a Registration procedure is requested.
If the AMF indicates Network Slicing Subscription Change, then the UE shall
locally erase all the network slicing configuration for all PLMNs and, if
applicable, update the configuration for the current PLMN based on any
received information. If the AMF indicates Network Slicing Subscription
Change, the UE shall also be requested to acknowledge in step 2.
If the AMF also includes in the UE Configuration Update Command message a new
Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN, then the AMF should also include a new
Allowed NSSAI with, if available, the associated Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI,
unless the AMF cannot determine the new Allowed NSSAI after the Subscribed
S-NSSAI(s) are updated, in which case the AMF does not include in the UE
Configuration Update Command message any Allowed NSSAI.
When the UE and the AMF supports RACS as defined in clause 5.4.4.1a of TS
23.501 [2] and the AMF needs to configure the UE with a UE Radio Capability ID
and the AMF already has the UE radio capabilities other than NB-IoT radio
capabilities for the UE and, the AMF may provide the UE with the UE Radio
Capability ID for the UE radio capabilities the UCMF returns to the AMF in a
Nucmf_assign service operation for this UE.
2a. If the UE Configuration Update Indication requires acknowledgement of the
UE Configuration Update Command, then the UE shall send a UE Configuration
Update complete message to the AMF. The AMF should request acknowledgement for
all UE Configuration Updates, except when only NITZ is provided. If
Registration procedure is not required, steps 3a, 3b, 3c and step 4 are
skipped. If the Configuration Update Indication is included in the UE
Configuration Update Command message and it requires a Registration procedure,
depending on the other NAS parameters included in the UE Configuration Update
command, the UE shall execute steps 3a or 3b or 3c+4 as applicable.
If the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is included in step1, the AMF
stores the UE Radio Capability ID in UE context if receiving UE Configuration
Update complete message.
If the UE receives PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID deletion indication in
step 1, the UE shall delete the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID(s) for
this PLMN. If UE Configuration Update is only for this purpose, the following
steps are skipped.
2b. [Conditional] The AMF also uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to
provide an acknowledgment to UDM that the UE received CAG information as part
of the Mobility Restrictions (if the CAG information was updated), or the
Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication (if this was indicated in step
1) and acted upon it.
2c. [Conditional] If the AMF has reconfigured the 5G-GUTI over 3GPP access,
the AMF informs the NG-RAN of the new UE Identity Index Value (derived from
the new 5G-GUTI) when the AMF receives the acknowledgement from the UE in step
2a.
[Conditional] If the UE is registered to the same PLMN via both 3GPP and
non-3GPP access and if the AMF has reconfigured the 5G-GUTI over non-3GPP
access and the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state over 3GPP access, then the AMF
informs the NG-RAN of the new UE Identity Index Value (derived from the new
5G-GUTI) when the AMF receives the acknowledgement from the UE in step 2a.
[Conditional] If the AMF has configured the UE with a PLMN-assigned UE Radio
Capability ID, the AMF informs NG-RAN of the UE Radio Capability ID, when it
receives the acknowledgement from the UE in step 2a.
[Conditional] If the Mobility Restrictions for the UE were updated and the
Mobility Restrictions were not provided in the N2 message that delivers the UE
Configuration Update Command, the AMF provides the NG-RAN with updated
Mobility Restrictions unless the AMF releases the UE in this step (see below).
If the AMF initiated the UE Configuration Update procedure due to receiving
Nudm_SDM_Notification and the CAG information has changed such that a CAG
Identifier has been removed from the Allowed CAG list or the UE is only
allowed to access CAG cells, the AMF shall release the NAS signalling
connection by triggering the AN release procedure for UEs that are not
receiving Emergency Services as defined in TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE 3: When the UE is accessing the network for emergency service the
conditions in clause 5.16.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2] apply.
2d [Conditional] If the UE is configured with a new 5G-GUTI in step 2a via
non-3GPP access and the UE is registered to the same PLMN via both 3GPP and
non-3GPP access, then the UE passes the new 5G-GUTI to its 3GPP access\' lower
layers.
If the UE is configured with a new 5G-GUTI in step 2a over the 3GPP access,
the UE passes the new 5G-GUTI to its 3GPP access\' lower layers.
NOTE 4: Steps 2c and 2d are needed because the NG-RAN may use the RRC Inactive
state and a part of the 5G-GUTI is used to calculate the Paging Frame (see TS
38.304 [44] and TS 36.304 [43]). It is assumed that the UE Configuration
Update Complete is reliably delivered to the AMF after the 5G-AN has
acknowledged its receipt to the UE.
3a. [Conditional] If only NAS parameters that can be updated without
transition from CM-IDLE are included (e.g. MICO mode, Enhanced Coverage
Restricted information) the UE shall initiate a Registration procedure
immediately after the acknowledgement to re-negotiate the updated NAS
parameter(s) with the network. Steps 3b, 3c and step 4 are skipped.
3b. [Conditional] If a new Allowed NSSAI and/or a new Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI
and/or a new Configured NSSAI provided by the AMF to the UE in step 1 does not
affect the existing connectivity to Network Slices (i.e. any S-NSSAI(s) the UE
is connected to), the AMF needs not release the NAS signalling connection for
the UE after receiving the acknowledgement in step 2 and immediate
registration is not required. The UE can start immediately using the new
Allowed NSSAI and/or the new Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI. The UE cannot connect
to an S-NSSAI included in the new Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN but
not included in the new Allowed NSSAI until the UE performs a Registration
procedure and includes a Requested NSSAI based on the new Configured NSSAI,
following the requirements described in clause 5.15.5.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
Steps 3c and 4 are skipped.
The AMF may, based on its policy, provide anyway an indication that a
Registration procedure is required even though the UE Configuration Update
Command in step 1 does not affect the existing connectivity to Network Slices:
in such a case only step 3c is skipped.
3c. [Conditional] If a new Allowed NSSAI and/or a new Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI
and/or a new Configured NSSAI provided by the AMF to the UE in step 1 affects
ongoing existing connectivity to Network Slices, then the AMF shall provide an
indication that the UE shall initiate a Registration procedure.
4\. [Conditional] After receiving the acknowledgement in step 2, the AMF shall
release the NAS signalling connection for the UE, unless there is one
established PDU Sessions associated with regulatory prioritized services. If
there is one established PDU Session associated with regulatory prioritized
services, the AMF informs SMFs to release the PDU Session(s) associated with
non regulatory prioritized services for this UE (see clause 4.3.4).
The AMF shall reject any NAS Message from the UE carrying PDU Session
Establishment Request for a non-emergency PDU Session before the required
Registration procedure has been successfully completed by the UE.
The UE initiates a Registration procedure (see clauses 4.2.2.2.2 and 4.13.3.1)
with registration type Mobility Registration Update after the UE enters CM-
IDLE state and shall not include the 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI in Access Stratum
signalling and shall include, subject to the conditions set out in clause
5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2], a Requested NSSAI in access stratum signalling. If
there is an established PDU Session associated with emergency service and the
UE has received an indication to perform the Registration procedure, the UE
shall initiate the Registration procedure only after the PDU Session
associated with emergency service is released.
NOTE 5: Receiving UE Configuration Update command without an indication
requesting to perform re-registration, can still trigger Registration
procedure by the UE for other reasons.
#### 4.2.4.3 UE Configuration Update procedure for transparent UE Policy
delivery
This procedure is initiated when the PCF wants to update UE policy information
(i.e. UE policy) in the UE configuration. In the non-roaming case the V-PCF is
not involved and the role of the H-PCF is performed by the PCF. For the
roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the AMF and the H-PCF interacts
with the V-PCF.
Figure 4.2.4.3-1: UE Configuration Update procedure for transparent UE Policy
delivery
0\. PCF decides to update UE policy based on triggering conditions such as an
initial registration, registration with 5GS when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS,
or need for updating UE policy as follows:
\- For the case of initial registration and registration with 5GS when the UE
moves from EPS to 5GS, the PCF compares the list of PSIs included in the UE
policy information in Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create request and determines, as
described in clause 6.1.2.2.2 of TS 23.503 [20], whether UE policy information
have to be updated and be provided to the UE via the AMF using DL NAS
TRANSPORT message; and
\- For the network triggered UE policy update case (e.g. the change of UE
location, the change of Subscribed S-NSSAIs as described in clause 6.1.2.2.2
of TS 23.503 [20]), the PCF checks the latest list of PSIs to decide which UE
policies have to be sent to the UE.
The PCF checks if the size of the resulting UE policy information exceeds a
predefined limit:
\- If the size is under the limit, then UE policy information are included in
a single Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation as described
below.
\- If the size exceeds the predefined limit, the PCF splits the UE policy
information in smaller, logically independent UE policy information ensuring
the size of each is under the predefined limit. Each UE policy information
will be then sent in separated Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service
operations as described below.
NOTE 1: NAS messages from AMF to UE do not exceed the maximum size limit
allowed in NG-RAN (PDCP layer), so the predefined size limit in PCF is related
to that limitation.
NOTE 2: The mechanism used to split the UE policy information is described in
TS 29.507 [32].
1\. PCF invokes Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation
provided by the AMF. The message includes SUPI, UE Policy Container.
2\. If the UE is registered and reachable by AMF in either 3GPP access or
non-3GPP access, AMF shall transfers transparently the UE Policy container to
the UE via the registered and reachable access.
If the UE is registered in both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and reachable on
both access and served by the same AMF, the AMF transfers transparently the UE
Policy container to the UE via one of the accesses based on the AMF local
policy.
If the UE is not reachable by AMF over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access,
the AMF reports to the PCF that the UE Policy container could not be delivered
to the UE using Namf_Communication_N1N2TransferFailureNotification as in the
step 5 in clause 4.2.3.3.
If AMF decides to transfer transparently the UE Policy container to the UE via
3GPP access, e.g. the UE is registered and reachable by AMF in 3GPP access
only, or if the UE is registered and reachable by AMF in both 3GPP and
non-3GPP accesses served by the same AMF and the AMF decides to transfer
transparently the UE Policy container to the UE via 3GPP access based on local
policy and the UE is in CM-IDLE and reachable by AMF in 3GPP access, the AMF
starts the paging procedure by sending a Paging message described in the step
4b of Network Triggered Service Request (in clause 4.2.3.3). Upon reception of
paging request, the UE shall initiate the UE Triggered Service Request
procedure (clause 4.2.3.2).
3\. If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED over 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, the AMF
transfers transparently the UE Policy container (UE policy information)
received from the PCF to the UE. The UE Policy container includes the list of
Policy Sections as described in TS 23.503 [20].
4\. The UE updates the UE policy provided by the PCF and sends the result to
the AMF.
5\. If the AMF received the UE Policy container and the PCF subscribed to be
notified of the reception of the UE Policy container then the AMF forwards the
response of the UE to the PCF using Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify.
The PCF maintains the latest list of PSIs delivered to the UE and updates the
latest list of PSIs in the UDR by invoking Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, Policy Data,
Policy Set Entry, updated PSI data) service operation.
If the PCF is notified about UE Policy delivery failure the PCF may initiate
UE Policy Association Modification procedure to provide a new trigger
\"Connectivity state changes\" in Policy Control Request Trigger of UE Policy
Association to AMF as defined in clause 4.16.12.2.
NOTE 3: For backward compatibility the PCF may subscribe the \"Connectivity
state changes (IDLE or CONNECTED)\" event in Rel-15 AMF as defined in clause
5.2.2.3.
### 4.2.5 Reachability procedures
#### 4.2.5.1 General
Elements of this procedure are used for UDM/NF initiated UE Reachability
Notification requests, e.g. for \"SMS over NAS\".
The procedure applies to UEs that are in RRC-Idle, RRC-Inactive and RRC-
Connected states.
There are two procedures necessary for any service related entity that would
need to be notified by the reachability of the UE:
\- UE Reachability Notification Request procedure; and
\- UE Activity Notification procedure.
#### 4.2.5.2 UE Reachability Notification Request procedure
The UE Reachability Notification Request procedure is illustrated in figure
4.2.5.2-1.
Figure 4.2.5.2-1: UE Reachability Notification Request Procedure
1a. [Conditional] When a service-related entity requests the UDM to provide an
indication regarding UE reachability, the UDM checks whether that service-
related entity is authorized to perform this request on this subscriber. The
service-related entity may subscribe in UDM to receive notifications about UE
Reachability or UE Reachability for SMS delivery events as defined in clause
4.15.3.
NOTE 1: This request for UE Reachability Notification is received in UDM using
different interfaces/services depending on the service-related entity. For
example, an SBI capable service-related entity can use the
Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe service while an SMS-GMSC triggers this procedure
as described in TS 23.040 [7].
The UDM may retrieve from the UDR the list of NF IDs for Network Functions
authorized by the HPLMN to request notifications on this UE\'s reachability.
If the entity is not authorized, the UDM may reject the request (e.g. if the
requesting entity is recognized as being a valid entity, but not authorized
for that subscriber) or discard it silently (e.g. if the requesting entity is
not recognized). Appropriate O&M reports are generated.
1b. [Conditional] The UDM stores the identity of the service-related entity.
In the case that the service-related entity is an SMS-GMSC, the UDM stores the
SC address within the MWD list. Otherwise, if the service-related entity is an
SBI capable service-related entity, the UDM stores the address of the SBI
capable service-related entity in the form of a subscription to the
Nudm_EventExposure service.
If the UE Reachability Notification Request is for SMS over NAS and no SMSF is
registered for the target UE, steps 2 to 4 are skipped.
Otherwise the UDM sets the URRP-AMF flag parameter and continues with step 2.
1c. [Conditional] An NF (e.g. SMF) may subscribe event of UE reachability
status change by using the Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.
Steps 2 to 4 are skipped.
The AMF invokes the Namf_EventExposure_Notify service operation to report the
current reachability state of a UE to the NF if requested by the consumer NF.
2\. [Conditional] If the value of URRP-AMF flag parameter changes from \"not
set\" to \"set\" and an AMF is registered in the UDM for the target UE, the
UDM initiates Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation for UE
reachability for UE reachable for DL traffic (SUPI, UE Reachability) towards
the AMF. The UDM may indicate if direct notification to NF shall be used by
the AMF. When direct notification to NF is indicated to the AMF, the URRP-AMF
is not set in the UDM in step 1a for NF initiated requests. If the service-
related entity requested UDM to receive notifications about UE Reachability
for SMS delivery, the UDM shall not indicate direct notification to NF.
NOTE 2: The UDM can trigger UE Reachability Notification Request procedure
with two different AMFs for a UE which is connected to 5G Core Network over
3GPP access and non-3GPP access simultaneously. Also, for interworking with
EPC, the UDM/HSS can trigger UE Reachability Notification Request procedure
with MME as described in TS 23.401 [13].
3\. The AMF checks that the requesting entity is authorized to perform this
request on this subscriber.
If the AMF has an MM Context for that user, the AMF stores the NF ID in the
URRP-AMF information, associated with URRP-AMF information flag to indicate
the need to report to the UDM or directly to the NF with a UE Activity
Notification (see clause 4.2.5.3).
4\. [Conditional] For UE reachability for UE reachable for DL traffic, if the
UE state in AMF is in CM-CONNECTED state and the Access Type is 3GPP access,
the AMF initiates N2 Notification procedure (see clause 4.8.3) with reporting
type set to Single RRC-Connected state notification.
#### 4.2.5.3 UE Activity Notification procedure
The UE Activity Notification procedure is illustrated in figure 4.2.5.3-1.
Figure 4.2.5.3-1: UE Activity Procedure
0\. Event has been subscribed in the AMF for UE reachability for DL traffic or
for UE reachability status change.
1a. For a UE in CM-IDLE, the AMF receives (N1) NAS signalling implying UE is
reachable for DL traffic, e.g. a Registration Request or Service Request
message from the UE, the AMF performs step 2;
1b. For a UE in CM-CONNECTED, if the AMF has initiated the N2 Notification
procedure in Step 4 of clause 4.2.5.2 and when the AMF receives a (N2) UE
Notification (see clause 4.8.3) or a (N2) Path Switch Request (see clause
4.9.1.2) implying UE is reachable for DL traffic from the NG-RAN, the AMF
performs step 2. Otherwise, i.e. UE is in CM-CONNECTED and AMF has not
initiated N2 Notification procedure, the AMF performs step 2; or
1c. The UE\'s reachability state changes from reachable to unreachable, then
AMF performs step 2.
2a. For event subscription of \"UE reachable for DL traffic\", if the AMF has
an MM context for the UE and the URRP-AMF information flag associated with the
subscribing NF is set to report once that the UE is reachable for DL traffic,
the AMF initiates the Namf_EventExposure_Notify service operation (SUPI, UE
Reachable) message (or Nudm_UECM_Registration service operation when
applicable) to the UDM following step 1a or step 1b. The AMF clears the
corresponding URRP-AMF information if applicable for the UE.
2a1. When the UDM receives the Namf_EventExposure_Notify service operation
(SUPI, UE-Reachable) message or Nudm_UECM_Registration service from AMF for a
UE that has URRP-AMF information flag set in the UDM, it triggers appropriate
notifications to the service-related entities associated with the URRP-AMF
information flag that have subscribed to the UDM for UE Reachability
notifications.
If SMSF is registered, it also triggers appropriate notifications to the
service-related entities associated with the URRP-AMF information flag that
have subscribed to the UDM for UE reachability for SMS delivery notification
(e.g. SMS-GMSC, HSS). UDM clears the URRP-AMF information for the UE.
If no SMSF is registered and there are service-related entities subscribed to
the UDM for the UE reachability for SMS delivery notification, the UDM clears
the URRP-AMF information for the UE but does not notify any service-related
entity.
When the UDM receives the Nudm_UECM_Registration service from SMSF for a UE
that has service-related entities subscribed to the UDM for the UE
reachability for SMS delivery notification and no URRP-AMF flag set in the
UDM, the UDM triggers appropriate notifications to the service-related
entities that have subscribed to the UDM for UE reachability for SMS delivery
notification).
NOTE: The UE Reachability Notification is sent by the UDM using different
interfaces/services depending on the service-related entity. For example, an
SBI capable service-related entity can receive the notification using the
Nudm_EventExposure_Notify service operation (if previously subscribed) while
an SMS-SC gets the notification as described in TS 23.040 [7] based on the SC
address stored in the MWD list.
2b. If in step 0 the AMF received Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe_service
operation directly from an NF authorised to receive direct notifications in
the case of UE reachability status change, or the UDM indicated that the
notification needs to be sent directly to the NF in the case of UE
reachability for DL traffic, the AMF initiates the Namf_EventExposure_Notify
service operation (SUPI, UE reachability state) message directly to the NF.
### 4.2.6 AN Release
This procedure is used to release the logical NG-AP signalling connection for
the UE between the (R)AN and the AMF and the associated N3 User Plane
connections and (R)AN signalling connection between the UE and the (R)AN and
the associated (R)AN resources.
When the NG-AP signalling connection is lost due to (R)AN or AMF failure, the
AN release is performed locally by the AMF or the (R)AN as described in the
procedure flow below without using or relying on any of the signalling shown
between (R)AN and AMF. The AN release causes all UP connections of the UE to
be deactivated.
The initiation of AN release may be due to:
\- (R)AN-initiated with cause e.g. O&M Intervention, Unspecified Failure,
(R)AN (e.g. Radio) Link Failure, User Inactivity, Inter-System Redirection,
request for establishment of QoS Flow for IMS voice, Release due to UE
generated signalling connection release, mobility restriction, Release
Assistance Information (RAI) from the UE, etc.; or
\- AMF-initiated with cause e.g. Unspecified Failure, etc.
Both (R)AN-initiated and AMF-initiated AN Release procedures are shown in
Figure 4.2.6-1.
If Service Gap Control shall be applied for the UE (see clause 5.31.16 of TS
23.501 [2]) and the Service Gap timer is not already running, the Service Gap
timer shall be started in AMF and UE when entering CM-IDLE, unless the
connection was initiated after a paging of an MT event, or after a
Registration procedure without Uplink data status or after a Registration
procedure for regulatory prioritized services like Emergency services or
exception reporting.
For this procedure, the impacted SMF and UPF are all under control of the PLMN
serving the UE, e.g. in Home Routed roaming case the SMF and UPF in HPLMN are
not involved.
Figure 4.2.6-1: AN Release procedure
1\. If there is some confirmed (R)AN conditions (e.g. Radio Link Failure) or
for other (R)AN internal reason, the (R)AN may decide to initiate the UE
context release in the (R)AN. In this case, the (R)AN sends an N2 UE Context
Release Request (Cause, List of PDU Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane)
message to the AMF. Cause indicates the reason for the release (e.g. AN Link
Failure, O&M intervention, unspecified failure, etc.). The List of PDU Session
ID(s) indicates the PDU Sessions served by (R)AN of the UE. If the (R)AN is
NG-RAN, this step is described in clause 8.3.2 of TS 38.413 [10]. If the (R)AN
is an N3IWF this step is described in clause 4.12.4.2.
If the reason for the release is the NG-RAN received an AS Release Assistance
Indicator as defined in TS 36.331 [16], NG-RAN should not immediately release
the RRC connection but instead send an N2 UE Context Release Request message
to the AMF. If the AS RAI indicates only a single downlink transmission is
expected then NG-RAN should only send the N2 UE Context Release Request after
a single downlink NAS PDU or N3 data PDU has been transferred.
If N2 Context Release Request cause indicates the release is requested due to
user inactivity or AS RAI then the AMF continues with the AN Release procedure
unless the AMF is aware of pending MT traffic or signalling.
2\. AMF to (R)AN: If the AMF receives the N2 UE Context Release Request
message or due to an internal AMF event, including the reception of Service
Request or Registration Request to establish another NAS signalling connection
still via (R)AN, the AMF sends an N2 UE Context Release Command (Cause) to the
(R)AN. The Cause indicates either the Cause from (R)AN in step 1 or the Cause
due to an AMF event. If the (R)AN is a NG-RAN this step is described in detail
in clause 8.3.3 of TS 38.413 [10]. If the (R)AN is an N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF this
step is described in clauses 4.12.4.2 / 4.12a and in clause 7.2.5 of TS 23.316
[53] for W-5GAN access.
If the AMF receives Service Request or Registration Request to establish
another NAS signalling connection still via (R)AN, after successfully
authenticating the UE, the AMF releases the old NAS signalling connection and
then continues the Service Request or Registration Request procedure.
3\. [Conditional] If the (R)AN connection (e.g. RRC connection or NWu
connection) with the UE is not already released (step 1), either:
a) the (R)AN requests the UE to release the (R)AN connection. Upon receiving
(R)AN connection release confirmation from the UE, the (R)AN deletes the UE\'s
context, or
b) if the Cause in the N2 UE Context Release Command indicates that the UE has
already locally released the RRC connection, the (R)AN locally releases the
RRC connection.
4\. The (R)AN confirms the N2 Release by returning an N2 UE Context Release
Complete (List of PDU Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane, User Location
Information, Age of Location Information) message to the AMF. The List of PDU
Session ID(s) indicates the PDU Sessions served by (R)AN of the UE. The AMF
stores always the latest UE Radio Capability information or NB-IoT specific UE
Radio Access Capability Information received from the NG-RAN node received as
described in TS 38.413 [10]. The N2 signalling connection between the AMF and
the (R)AN for that UE is released. If the UE is served by an NG-eNB that
supports WUS, then the NG-eNB should include the Information On Recommended
Cells And RAN nodes For Paging; otherwise the (R)AN may provide the list of
recommended cells / TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers for paging to the AMF.
If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the NG-RAN node may
provide RAN usage data Report.
This step shall be performed promptly after step 2, i.e. it shall not be
delayed, for example, in situations where the UE does not acknowledge the RRC
Connection Release.
The NG-RAN includes Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE, if available, in
the N2 UE Context Release Complete message. The AMF stores the received Paging
Assistance Data for CE capable UE in the UE context for subsequent Paging
procedure.
5\. [Conditional] AMF to SMF: For each of the PDU Sessions in the N2 UE
Context Release Complete, the AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
Request (PDU Session ID, PDU Session Deactivation, Cause, Operation Type, User
Location Information, Age of Location Information, N2 SM Information
(Secondary RAT usage data)). The Cause in step 5 is the same Cause in step 2.
If List of PDU Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane is included in step 1b,
the step 5 to 7 are performed before step 2. The Operation Type is set to \"UP
deactivate\" to indicate deactivation of user plane resources for the PDU
Session.
For PDU Sessions using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation and if the UE has
negotiated the use of extended Idle mode DRX, the AMF informs the SMF
immediately that the UE is not reachable for downlink data. For PDU Sessions
using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation and if the UE has negotiated the use
of MICO mode with Active Time, the AMF informs the SMF that the UE is not
reachable for downlink data once the Active Time has expired.
6a [Conditional] SMF to UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (AN or N3 UPF
Tunnel Info to be removed, Buffering on/off).
For PDU Sessions not using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the SMF
initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure indicating the need to remove
Tunnel Info of AN or UPF terminating N3. Buffering on/off indicates whether
the UPF shall buffer incoming DL PDU or not.
If the SMF has received an indication from the AMF that the UE is not
reachable for downlink data for PDU Sessions using Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation, the SMF may initiate an N4 Session Modification procedure to
activate buffering in the UPF.
If multiple UPFs are used in the PDU Session and the SMF determines to release
the UPF terminating N3, step 6a is performed towards the UPF (e.g. PSA)
terminating N9 towards the current N3 UPF. The SMF then releases the N4
session towards the N3 UPF (the N4 release is not shown on the call flow).
See clause 4.4 for more details.
If the cause of AN Release is because of User Inactivity, or UE Redirection,
the SMF shall preserve the GBR QoS Flows. Otherwise, the SMF shall trigger the
PDU Session Modification procedure (see clause 4.3.3) for the GBR QoS Flows of
the UE after the AN Release procedure is completed.
If the redundant I-UPFs are used for URLLC, the N4 Session Modification
Request procedure is done for each I-UPF. In this case, SMF selects both the
redundant I-UPFs to buffer the DL packets for this PDU Session or drop the DL
packets for this PDU session or forward the DL packets for this PDU session to
the SMF, based on buffering instruction provided by the SMF as described in
clause 5.8.3.2 or 5.8.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
If the redundant N3 tunnels are used for URLLC, the N4 Session Modification
Request procedure to the UPF of N3 terminating point is to remove the dual AN
Tunnel Info for N3 tunnel of the corresponding PDU Session.
6b. [Conditional] UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response acknowledging
the SMF request.
See clause 4.4 for more details.
7\. [Conditional] SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response for
step 5.
Upon completion of the procedure, the AMF considers the N2 and N3 as released
and enters CM-IDLE state.
After completion of the procedure, the AMF reports towards the NF consumers
are triggered for cases in clause 4.15.4.
After completion of the procedure, if steps 5 to 7 were performed before step
2 and the AMF received N2 SM information from NG-RAN in step 4 (e.g. Secondary
RAT usage data report), the AMF initiates a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
towards SMF to deliver the N2 SM information.
### 4.2.7 N2 procedures
#### 4.2.7.1 N2 Configuration
At power up, restart and when modifications are applied, the 5G-AN node and
AMF use non-UE related N2 signalling to exchange configuration data. Full
details of this configuration data are specified in TS 38.300 [9], but the
following highlights some aspects.
The AMF supplies the 5G-AN node with information about:
a) the AMF Name and the GUAMI(s) configured on that AMF Name;
b) the set of TNL associations to be established between the NG-RAN node and
the AMF;
c) weight factor associated with each of the TNL association within the AMF;
and
d) weight factor for each AMF Name within the AMF Set; and
e) (optional) for each GUAMI(s) configured on that AMF the corresponding
backup AMF Name.
The weight factors are used for load distribution of the initial N2 messages.
The AMF chooses whether or not to use the same TNL association for the initial
N2 message and subsequent messages for that UE. TNL associations configured
with a weight factor set to zero are not permitted for the initial N2 message,
but can be used for subsequent N2 messages.
Deployments that rely solely on 5GC-based load balancing can set the weight
factors associated with TNL associations that are permitted for the initial N2
message to the same value.
#### 4.2.7.2 NGAP UE-TNLA-binding related procedures
##### 4.2.7.2.1 Creating **NGAP UE-TNLA-bindings during Registration and
Service Request**
When a UE connects to the 5GC via a 5G-AN node without providing any UE
identities (i.e. a GUAMI or a 5G-S-TMSI), or the UE provides a GUAMI or a
5G-S-TMSI but the 5G-AN node cannot associate to any of its connected AMFs,
the following steps are performed:
1\. The 5G-AN **node** selects an AMF as defined in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501
[2].
2\. The 5G-AN **node** creates an **NGAP UE-TNLA-binding** for the UE by
selecting a TNL association from the available TNL associations permitted for
the initial message e.g. N2 INITIAL UE MESSAGE for the selected AMF, as
defined in clause 5.21.1.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and forwards the UE message to the
AMF via the selected TNL association.
3\. The AMF may decide to use the TNL association selected by the 5G-AN or the
AMF may modify the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding by triangular redirection.
NOTE 1: This process could take place during the Registration procedure (for
Initial Registration, Mobility Registration Update).
4\. The AMF may decide to modify the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding toward other 5G-AN
nodes such as N3IWF. This is done if the AMF is changed and old AMF have
existing NGAP UE-TNLA-bindings toward other 5G-AN nodes.
When a UE connects to the 5GC via a 5G-AN node with a 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI
associated with the AMF usable by the 5G-AN node, the following steps are
performed:
1\. The 5G-AN node creates an **NGAP UE-TNLA-binding** for the UE by selecting
a TNL association from the available TNL associations permitted for the
initial N2 message for the AMF identified by the UE\'s 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI.
2\. The AMF may decide to use the TNL association selected by the 5G-AN or the
AMF may modify the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding by triangular redirection.
NOTE 2: This process could take place during the Registration procedure or
Service Request procedure.
##### 4.2.7.2.2 Creating NGAP UE-TNLA-bindings during handovers
During an Xn-based inter NG-RAN node handover, the following applies
\- If an NGAP UE-TNLA-binding exists for a UE, the source 5G-AN **node**
supplies the target 5G-AN **node** with the corresponding TNL address of the
AMF for the currently used TNL association.
\- If the target 5G-AN does not have a TNL association towards the TNL address
of the AMF received from the source 5G-AN node, the target 5G-AN **node**
establishes a TNL association towards the TNL address received from the source
5G-AN **node** , creates an **NGAP UE-TNLA-binding to this TNL association and
sends the N2 Path Switch Request via this TNL association.**
\- Otherwise, the target 5G-AN node creates an **NGAP UE-TNLA-binding** for
the UE by selecting a TNL association from the available TNL associations
towards the TNL address, permitted for the initial N2 message for the AMF
identified by the UE\'s GUAMI.
\- The AMF may decide to use the TNL association selected by the 5G-AN or the
AMF may modify the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding by triangular redirection.
During an inter NG-RAN node handover without Xn interface (i.e. during an N2
handover) the following applies:
\- If an NGAP UE-TNLA-binding exists for a UE, the source 5G-AN **node** sends
the N2 Handover Required message using the corresponding TNL address of the
AMF.
\- Otherwise the 5G-AN node creates an **NGAP UE-TNLA-binding** for the UE by
selecting a TNL association from the available TNL associations permitted for
the initial N2 message for the AMF identified by the UE\'s GUAMI.
**\- The target AMF selects** a TNL association from the available TNL
associations for the target 5G-AN **node** and sends the N2 Handover Request
message via this TNL association. The target 5G-AN **node** creates an **NGAP
UE-TNLA-binding** for the UE based on the TNL association selected by the
target AMF.
##### 4.2.7.2.3 Re-Creating NGAP UE-TNLA-bindings subsequent to NGAP UE-TNLA-
binding release
**If the AMF has released the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding in the 5G-AN node for a UE
and the 5G-AN node needs to send an N2 message for this UE, the following**
applies:
\- The 5G-AN node checks the GUAMI stored in the UE context and the associated
AMF:
\- If the GUAMI is available, 5G-AN selects the AMF which owns that GUAMI.
\- If GUAMI has been marked as unavailable (i.e. based on AMF unavailable
status indication received from AMF) but one corresponding target AMF has been
indicated, 5G-AN selects that target AMF even if the GUAMI has not been
updated as available by the target AMF.
\- If GUAMI has been marked as unavailable (i.e. based on AMF unavailable
status indication received from AMF) and no corresponding target AMF has been
indicated, the 5G-AN selects an AMF from the AMF Set based on AMF Set ID of
the GUAMI, as defined in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2].
\- The 5G-AN node creates an NGAP UE-TNLA-binding for the UE by selecting a
TNL association from the available TNL associations permitted for the initial
N2 message with the selected AMF, as defined in clause 5.21.1.3 of TS 23.501
[2] and sends the N2 message to the AMF via the selected TNL association.
\- The AMF may decide to use the TNL association selected by the 5G-AN or the
AMF may modify the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding by triangular redirection.
**If the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding has been released for a UE and the AMF needs to
send an N2 message for this UE, the following applies:**
**\- The AMF selects** a TNL association from the available TNL associations
for the target 5G-AN **node** and sends the N2 message via this TNL
association. The target 5G-AN **node** creates an **NGAP UE-TNLA-binding** for
the UE based on the TNL association selected by the AMF.
The TNL association chosen by the AMF always takes precedence.
NOTE: This addresses situations where 5G-AN node and AMF select a TNL
association for a UE concurrently.
##### 4.2.7.2.4 **NGAP UE-TNLA-binding update procedure**
At any time the AMF may decide to re-bind the NGAP UE association to a new TNL
association:
\- by sending a UE-specific NGAP message on a new TNL association (triangular
redirection), if:
\- AMF responds to the 5G-AN node initiated NGAP message (i.e. triangular
redirection) as described in clauses 4.2.7.2.1, 4.2.7.2.2 and 4.2.7.2.3; or
\- AMF initiated UE-specific NGAP message needs to be sent to 5G-AN node;
\- by **sending** a UE-specific NGAP UE-TNLA binding release message to 5G-AN
and the 5G-AN node updates the NGAP UE-TNLA binding with the new TNL
association.
##### 4.2.7.2.5 **NGAP UE-TNLA-binding per UE Release procedure**
At any time the AMF may decide to release the NGAP UE-TNLA binding while
keeping the UE in CM-CONNECTED state while keeping the corresponding N3
interface. The AMF releases the NGAP UE-TNLA binding by sending a UE-specific
NGAP UE-TNLA binding release message on the current TNL association.
If the AMF releases the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding without sending AMF unavailable
status indication, then the AN may immediately trigger creation of a new NGAP-
UE-TNLA-binding with the same AMF for subsequent N2 messages or may leave the
NGAP UE association without NGAP UE-TNLA-binding. In the latter case the new
NGAP UE-TNLA-binding is re-created upon the subsequent AN-initiated or AMF-
initiated UE-specific N2 signalling as specified in clause 4.2.7.2.3.
If the AMF releases the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding after AMF unavailable status
indication, then the AN has to re-create the NGAP-UE-TNLA-binding with a
different AMF. The 5G-AN re-creates N2AP UE-TNLA-binding for subsequent N2
messages for the given UE as specified in clause 4.2.7.2.3.
#### 4.2.7.3 AMF Failure or Planned Maintenance handling procedure
For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state:
\- If AMF failure is detected by 5G-AN, all NGAP UE TNLA binding for UEs
served by that AMF are released.
\- If AMF becomes unavailable due to planned maintenance, the AMF notifies the
5G-AN about the unavailable GUAMI(s) and provides optionally a target AMF Name
corresponding to each unavailable GUAMI. The 5G-AN releases all NGAP UE TNLA
binding of the UEs related to the indicated unavailable GUAMI(s) unless the
notification from the AMF includes an indicator that the AMF will rebind or
release the NGAP UE TNLA binding on a per UE-basis. In that case, if 5G-AN
supports, the 5G-AN waits the release until the timer expires so that the AMF
may release or rebind the N2AP UE-TNLA binding on per UE-basis.
\- For the release NGAP TNLA binding, the affected UE is kept in CM-CONNECTED
state and the corresponding N3 interface is also kept.
For UE(s) in CM-IDLE state, when it subsequently returns from CM-IDLE state
and the 5G-AN receives an initial NAS message with a 5G S-TMSI or GUAMI, the
5G-AN uses 5G S-TMSI or GUAMI to select the target AMF, the 5G-AN forwards N2
message.
### 4.2.8 Void
### 4.2.8a UE Capability Match Request procedure
If the AMF requires more information on the UE radio capabilities support to
be able to set the IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication (see clause
5.16.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), then the AMF may send a UE Radio Capability Match
Request message to the NG-RAN. This procedure is typically used during the
registration procedure or when AMF has not received the Voice Support Match
Indicator (as part of the 5GMM Context).
Figure 4.2.8a-1: UE Capability Match Request
1\. The AMF indicates whether the AMF wants to receive Voice support match
indicator. The AMF may include the UE radio capability information it has
previously received from NG-RAN.
2\. Upon receiving the UE Capability Match Request message, if the NG-RAN has
not already received the UE radio capabilities from the UE or from AMF in step
1, the NG-RAN requests the UE to upload the UE radio capability information.
3\. The UE provides the NG-RAN with its UE radio capabilities sending the RRC
UE Capability Information.
4\. The NG-RAN checks whether the UE radio capabilities are compatible with
the network configuration for ensuring voice service continuity of voice calls
initiated in IMS.
For determining the appropriate UE Radio Capability Match Response, the NG-RAN
is configured by the operator to check whether the UE supports certain
capabilities required for Voice continuity of voice calls using IMS PS. In a
shared network, the NG-RAN keeps a configuration separately per PLMN.
NOTE 1: What checks to perform depends on network configuration, i.e.
following are some examples of UE capabilities to be taken into account:
\- E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Voice over PS capabilities;
\- the Radio capabilities for E-UTRAN/NG-RAN FDD and/or TDD; and/or
\- the support of E-UTRAN/NG-RAN frequency bands;
\- the SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN capabilities and the support of UTRAN
frequency bands.
NOTE 2: The network configuration considered in the decision for the Voice
Support Match Indicator is homogenous within a certain area (e.g. AMF Set) in
order to guarantee that the Voice Support Match Indicator from the NG-RAN is
valid within such area.
The NG-RAN provides a Voice Support Match Indicator to the AMF to indicate
whether the UE capabilities and networks configuration are compatible for
ensuring voice service continuity of voice calls initiated in IMS.
The AMF stores the received Voice support match indicator in the 5GMM Context
and uses it as an input for setting the IMS voice over PS Session Supported
Indication.
5\. If NG-RAN requested radio capabilities from UE in step 2 and 3, the NG-RAN
also sends the UE radio capabilities to the AMF. The AMF stores the UE radio
capabilities without interpreting them for further provision to the NG-RAN
according to clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE 3: Steps 4 and 5 could be received by the AMF in any order.
### 4.2.9 Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure
#### 4.2.9.1 General
The Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure is
triggered for an S-NSSAI requiring Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization with an AAA Server (AAA-S) which may be hosted by the H-PLMN
operator or by a third party which has a business relationship with the
H-PLMN, using the EAP framework as described in TS 33.501 [15]. An AAA Proxy
(AAA-P) in the HPLMN may be involved e.g. if the AAA Server belongs to a third
party.
This procedure is triggered by the AMF during a Registration procedure when
some Network Slices require Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization,
when AMF determines that Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization is requires for an S-NSSAI in the current Allowed NSSAI (e.g.
subscription change), or when the AAA Server that authenticated the Network
Slice triggers a re-authentication.
The AMF performs the role of the EAP Authenticator and communicates with the
AAA-S via the Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization Function
(NSSAAF). The NSSAAF undertakes any AAA protocol interworking with the AAA
protocol supported by the AAA-S.
The Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure requires
the use of a GPSI. In other words, a subscription that contains S-NSSAIs
subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization shall
include at least one GPSI.
#### 4.2.9.2 Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
Figure 4.2.9.2-1: Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
procedure
1\. For S-NSSAIs that are requiring Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization, based on change of subscription information, or triggered by
the AAA-S, the AMF may trigger the start of the Network Slice Specific
Authentication and Authorization procedure.
If Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization is triggered as a
result of Registration procedure, the AMF may determine, based on UE Context
in the AMF, that for some or all S-NSSAI(s) subject to Network Slice Specific
Authentication and Authorization, the UE has already been authenticated
following a Registration procedure on a first access. Depending on Network
Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization result (e.g. success/failure)
from the previous Registration, the AMF may decide, based on Network policies,
to skip Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization for these
S-NSSAIs during the Registration on a second access.
If the Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure
corresponds to a re-authentication and re-authorization procedure triggered as
a result of AAA Server-triggered UE re-authentication and re-authorization for
one or more S-NSSAIs, as described in 4.2.9.2, or triggered by the AMF based
on operator policy or a subscription change and if S-NSSAIs that are requiring
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization are included in the
Allowed NSSAI for each Access Type, the AMF selects an Access Type to be used
to perform the Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization
procedure based on network policies.
2\. The AMF may send an EAP Identity Request for the S-NSSAI in a NAS MM
Transport message including the S-NSSAI. This is the S-NSSAI of the H-PLMN,
not the locally mapped S-NSSAI value.
3\. The UE provides the EAP Identity Response for the S-NSSAI alongside the
S-NSSAI in an NAS MM Transport message towards the AMF.
4\. The AMF sends the EAP Identity Response to the NSSAAF in a
Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate Request (EAP Identity Response, GPSI, S-NSSAI).
NOTE: If the UE subscription includes multiple GPSIs, the AMF uses any GPSI in
the list provided by the UDM for NSSAA procedures.
5\. If the AAA-P is present (e.g. because the AAA-S belongs to a third party
and the operator deploys a proxy towards third parties), the NSSAAF forwards
the EAP ID Response message to the AAA-P, otherwise the NSSAAF forwards the
message directly to the AAA-S. The NSSAAF is responsible to send the NSSAA
requests to the appropriate AAA-S based on local configuration of AAA-S
address per S-NSSAI. The NSSAAF uses towards the AAA-P or the AAA-S an AAA
protocol message of the same protocol supported by the AAA-S.
6\. The AAA-P forwards the EAP Identity message to the AAA-S addressable by
the AAA-S address together with S-NSSAI and GPSI. The AAA-S stores the GPSI to
create an association with the EAP Identity in the EAP ID response message, so
the AAA-S can later use it to revoke authorization or to trigger
reauthentication.
7-14. EAP-messages are exchanged with the UE. One or more than one iteration
of these steps may occur.
15\. EAP authentication completes. The AAA-S stores the S-NSSAI for which the
authorisation has been granted, so it may decide to trigger reauthentication
and reauthorization based on its local policies. An EAP-Success/Failure
message is delivered to the AAA-P (or if the AAA-P is not present, directly to
the NSSAAF) with GPSI and S-NSSAI.
16\. If the AAA-P is used, the AAA-P sends an AAA Protocol message including
(EAP-Success/Failure, S-NSSAI, GPSI) to the NSSAAF.
17\. The NSSAAF sends the Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate Response (EAP-
Success/Failure, S-NSSAI, GPSI) to the AMF.
18\. The AMF transmits a NAS MM Transport message (EAP-Success/Failure) to the
UE. The AMF shall store the EAP result for each S-NSSAI for which the NSSAA
procedure in steps 1-17 was executed.
19a. [Conditional] If a new Allowed NSSAI (i.e. including any new S-NSSAIs in
a Requested NSSAI for which the NSSAA procedure succeeded and/or excluding any
S-NSSAI(s) in the existing Allowed NSSAI for the UE for which the procedure
has failed) and/or new Rejected S-NSSAIs (i.e. including any S-NSSAI(s) in the
existing Allowed NSSAI for the UE for which the procedure has failed, or any
new requested S-NSSAI(s) for which the NSSAA procedure failed) need to be
delivered to the UE, or if the AMF re-allocation is required, the AMF
initiates the UE Configuration Update procedure, for each Access Type, as
described in clause 4.2.4.2. If the Network Slice-Specific Re-Authentication
and Re-Authorization fails and there are PDU session(s) established that are
associated with the S-NSSAI for which the NSSAA procedure failed, the AMF
shall initiate the PDU Session Release procedure as specified in clause 4.3.4
to release the PDU sessions with the appropriate cause value.
19b. [Conditional] If the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization fails for all S-NSSAIs (if any) in the existing Allowed NSSAI
for the UE and (if any) for all S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI, the AMF shall
execute the Network-initiated Deregistration procedure described in clause
4.2.2.3.3 and it shall include in the explicit De-Registration Request the
list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the appropriate rejection cause
value.
#### 4.2.9.3 AAA Server triggered Network Slice-Specific Re-authentication and
Re-authorization procedure
Figure 4.2.9.3-1: AAA Server initiated Network Slice-Specific Re-
authentication and Re-authorization procedure
1\. The AAA-S requests the re-authentication and re-authorization for the
Network Slice specified by the S-NSSAI in the AAA protocol Re-Auth Request
message, for the UE identified by the GPSI in this message. This message is
sent to a AAA-P, if the AAA-P is used (e.g. the AAA Server belongs to a third
party), otherwise it is sent directly to the NSSAAF.
2\. The AAA-P, if present, relays the request to the NSSAAF.
3a-3b. NSSAAF gets AMF ID from UDM using Nudm_UECM_Get with the GPSI in the
received AAA message.
3c. The NSSAAF provides an acknowledgement to the AAA protocol Re-Auth Request
message. If the AMF is not registered in UDM the procedure is stopped here.
4\. If the AMF is registered in UDM, the NSSAAF notifies the AMF to re-
authenticate/re-authorize the S-NSSAI for the UE using Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Re-
AuthNotification with the GPSI and S-NSSAI in the received AAA message. The
callback URI of the notification for the AMF is derived via NRF as specified
in TS 29.501 [62].
5\. If the UE is registered with the S-NSSAI in the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI,
the AMF triggers the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
procedure defined in clause 4.2.9.1. If the S-NSSAI is included in the Allowed
NSSAI for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, AMF selects an access type to
perform NSSAA based on network policies. If the S-NSSAI is only included in
the Allowed NSSAI of non-3GPP access and UE is CM-IDLE in non-3GPP access, the
AMF marks the S-NSSAI as pending. In this case, when UE becomes CM-CONNECTED
in non-3GPP access, the AMF initiates NSSAA if needed.
If the UE is registered but the S-NSSAI is not in the Mapping Of Allowed
NSSAI, the AMF removes any status of the corresponding S-NSSAI subject to
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization in the UE context it
may have kept, so that an NSSAA is executed next time the UE requests to
register with the S-NSSAI.
#### 4.2.9.4 AAA Server triggered Slice-Specific Authorization Revocation
Figure 4.2.9.4-1: AAA Server-initiated Network Slice-Specific Authorization
Revocation procedure
1\. The AAA-S requests the revocation of authorization for the Network Slice
specified by the S-NSSAI in the AAA protocol Revoke Auth Request message, for
the UE identified by the GPSI in this message. This message is sent to AAA-P
if it is used.
2\. The AAA-P, if present, relays the request to the NSSAAF.
3a-3b. The NSSAAF gets AMF ID from UDM using Nudm_UECM_Get with the GPSI in
the received AAA message.
3c. The NSSAAF provides an acknowledgement to the AAA protocol Re-Auth Request
message. If the AMF is not registered in UDM the procedure is stopped here.
4\. If the AMF is registered in UDM, the NSSAAF notifies the AMF to revoke the
S-NSSAI authorization for the UE using Nnssaaf_NSSAA_RevocationNotification
with the GPSI and S-NSSAI in the received AAA message. The callback URI of the
notification for the AMF is derived via NRF as specified in TS 29.501 [62].
5\. If the UE is registered with the S-NSSAI in the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI,
the AMF updates the UE configuration to revoke the S-NSSAI from the current
Allowed NSSAI, for any Access Type for which Network Slice Specific
Authentication and Authorization had been successfully run on this S-NSSAI.
The UE Configuration Update may include a request to Register if the AMF needs
to be re-allocated. The AMF provides a new Allowed NSSAI to the UE by removing
the S-NSSAI for which authorization has been revoked. The AMF provides new
rejected NSSAIs to the UE including the S-NSSAI for which authorization has
been revoked. If no S-NSSAI is left in Allowed NSSAI for an access after the
revocation and a Default NSSAI exists that requires no Network Slice Specific
Authentication or for which a Network Slice Specific Authentication did not
previously fail over this access, then the AMF may provide a new Allowed NSSAI
to the UE containing the Default NSSAI. If no S-NSSAI is left in Allowed NSSAI
for an access after the revocation and no Default NSSAI can be provided to the
UE in the Allowed NSSAI or a previous Network Slice Specific Authentication
failed for the Default NSSAI over this access, then the AMF shall execute the
Network-initiated Deregistration procedure for the access as described in
clause 4.2.2.3.3 and it shall include in the explicit De-Registration Request
message the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the appropriate
rejection cause value. If there are PDU session(s) established that are
associated with the revoked S-NSSAI, the AMF shall initiate the PDU Session
Release procedure as specified in clause 4.3.4 to release the PDU sessions
with the appropriate cause value.
If the UE is registered but the S-NSSAI is not in the Mapping Of Allowed
NSSAI, the AMF removes any status it may have kept of the corresponding
S-NSSAI subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization in
the UE context.
### 4.2.10 N3 data transfer establishment procedure when Control Plane CIoT
5GS Optimisation is enabled
#### 4.2.10.1 UE triggered N3 data transfer establishment procedure
If UE and AMF successfully negotiate N3 data transfer in addition to Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation based on the Preferred and Supported Network
Behaviour as defined in clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2], then the UE may, e.g.
based on the amount of data to be transferred in uplink, initiate N3 data
transfer establishment procedure for any PDU session for which Control Plane
Only Indicator was not included.
The UE triggered N3 data transfer establishment procedure may be initiated by
the UE in CM-IDLE or CM-CONNECTED state and follows the UE triggered Service
Request procedure as defined in clause 4.2.3.2 with the following differences.
Step 1.
The UE includes in the AN message a Service Request for Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation (List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated, List Of Allowed PDU
Sessions, security parameters, PDU Session status, [NAS message container])).
The List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated is provided by UE when the UE wants
to activate user plane resources for the PDU Session(s). The UE shall not
include PDU sessions for which Control Plane Only Indicator was received in
the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. If the UE is camping on NB-IoT, the
UE shall construct the List of PDU Sessions To Be Activated to not exceed 2
PDU session(s) with active user plane resources.
If this procedure is triggered for paging response and the UE has at the same
time some user data to be transferred, the UE may decide to request N3 data
transfer establishment for one of more PDU sessions. The UE indicates this in
the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. Otherwise the UE does not identify
any PDU Session in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated.
Step 4 or 5a.
Upon reception of Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request or after SMF
initiated SM Policy Association Modification, based on UE request and local
policies, the SMF decides whether to establish N3 data transfer for the PDU
session. The SMF shall not decide to establish N3 data transfer for a PDU
session for which Control Plane Only Inidcator was received.
Step 11.
The SMF indicates in Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response whether to
establish N3 data transfer, i.e. activate Data Radio Bearer and N3 tunnel, for
the PDU session.
Step 12.
If the RAT type is NB-IoT, the AMF shall ensure that number of PDU Sessions
with active user plane resources does not exceed 2. If the AMF decides to not
include a PDU Session to be activated in the N2 message, the AMF indicates
this to the SMF in step 15 Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request in the List
of PDU Sessions that failed to be established with the failure cause given in
the N2 SM information element.
The AMF includes a NAS service accept for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
containing information on the PDU sessions with established N3 data transfer,
based on the request(s) from the SMF(s) in step 11.
The network starts using N3 bearers for all DL data on this PDU session.
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is considered enabled for data transfer
for all PDU sessions without established N3 data transfer.
Step 13.
The UE starts using N3 bearears for all UL data on this PDU session.
#### 4.2.10.2 SMF triggered N3 data transfer establishment procedure
If UE and AMF successfully negotiate N3 data transfer in addition to Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation based on the Preferred and Supported Network
Behaviour as defined in clause 5.31.2, then the SMF may, e.g. based on the
amount of data to be transferred or due to congestion, initiate N3 data
transfer establishment procedure for any PDU session for which Control Plane
Only Indicator was not included.
The SMF triggered N3 data transfer establishment procedure may be initiated by
the SMF while the UE is in CM-IDLE or CM-CONNECTED state and follows the
Network Triggered Service Request procedure defined in clause 4.2.3.3 with the
following differences:
Step 3a.
The SMF request the activation of Data Radio Bearer and N3 tunnel for the PDU
session in Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.
Step 3b.
If the RAT type is NB-IoT and the UE already has 2 PDU Sessions with active
user plane resources, the AMF shall not proceed with the rest of the procedure
and instead the AMF shall respond with Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
Response with appropriate failure message.
Step 6.
The UE triggered N3 data transfer establishment procedure defined in clause
4.2.10.1 is applied instead of Service Request procedure from clause 4.2.3.2.
Step 7.
When the N3 data transfer is set up for a PDU session, the UE and the network
shall only use user plane radio bearers to transfer data PDUs on that PDU
Session.
## 4.3 Session Management procedures
### 4.3.1 General
Clause 4.3 defines the Session Management related procedures. It refers to
clause 4.4 for the N4 interactions.
As defined in clause 5.6.3 of TS 23.501 [2], considering the case of Home
Routed PDU Session, the NAS SM information processing by SMF considers
following kind of NAS SM information:
\- Information that both the V-SMF and H-SMF process: indication of the nature
of the NAS SM signalling (e.g. PDU Session Establishment Request), PDU Session
Type, Session-AMBR, UE addressing information (allocated IPv4 address,
interface identifier).
\- Information that is not visible to the V-SMF, only processed by the H-SMF:
SSC mode, Protocol Configuration Options, SM PDU DN Request Container, QoS
Rule(s) and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if any for the QoS Flow(s)
associated with the QoS rule(s).
NOTE 1: \"Information that is not visible to the V-SMF\" refers to information
that the V-SMF is to relay between the UE and the H-SMF (and that it can store
in CDR) but that the V-SMF is not assumed to process otherwise.
The NAS SM information processing split between V-SMF and H-SMF is transparent
to the UE.
Both V-SMF and H-SMF process information interpreted by the AMF as the PDU
Session ID, the DNN, the S-NSSAI (with values for the Serving PLMN and HPLMN
processed by the V-SMF and with a value for the HPLMN processed by the H-SMF).
In the case of Home Routed PDU Session the H-SMF provides also the V-SMF with
the IPv6 Prefix allocated to the PDU Session.
NOTE 2: IPv6 Prefix allocated to the PDU Session is provided to allow the
V-SMF fulfilling regulatory requirements for data storage in the visited
country.
In non roaming and LBO cases the SMF processes all NAS SM information.
In HR roaming scenarios, in order to support SM features only requiring
support from the H-SMF without impacting the V-SMF, as specified in detail in
TS 29.502 [36]:
\- The V-SMF transfers NAS SM information, which is not visible to the V-SMF,
in a container towards the H-SMF;
\- The V-SMF transfers NAS SM information which it does not comprehend
(unknown IEs or IEs with an unknown value not set to \"reserved\" according to
the release to which the V-SMF complies), in a different container towards the
H-SMF;
\- The H-SMF transfers NAS SM information which the V-SMF does not need to
interpret, in one container towards the V-SMF;
\- The V-SMF appends unknown NAS SM information received in the N16 container
at the end of the NAS SM message it sends to the UE.
### 4.3.2 PDU Session Establishment
#### 4.3.2.1 General
A PDU Session establishment may correspond to:
\- a UE initiated PDU Session Establishment procedure.
\- a UE initiated PDU Session handover between 3GPP and non-3GPP.
\- a UE initiated PDU Session handover from EPS to 5GS.
\- a Network triggered PDU Session Establishment procedure. In this case the
network sends the device trigger message to application(s) on the UE side. The
payload included in Device Trigger Request message contains information on
which application on the UE side is expected to trigger the PDU Session
establishment request. Based on that information, the application(s) on the UE
side trigger the PDU Session Establishment procedure. For more detail refer to
clause 4.13.2.
If the UE is simultaneously registered to a non-3GPP access via a
N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF located in a PLMN different from the PLMN of the 3GPP access,
the functional entities in the following procedures are located in the PLMN of
the access used to exchange NAS with the UE for the PDU Session.
As specified in clause 5.6.1 of TS 23.501 [2], a PDU Session may be associated
either (a) with a single access type at a given time, i.e. either 3GPP access
or non-3GPP access, or (b) simultaneously with multiple access types, i.e. one
3GPP access and one non-3GPP access. A PDU Session associated with multiple
access types is referred to as Multi Access-PDU (MA PDU) Session and it may be
requested by ATSSS-capable UEs.
The following clause 4.3.2.2 specifies the procedures for establishing PDU
Sessions associated with a single access type at a given time. The particular
procedures associated with MA PDU Sessions are specified as part of the ATSSS
procedures in clause 4.22.
#### 4.3.2.2 UE Requested PDU Session Establishment
##### 4.3.2.2.1 Non-roaming and Roaming with Local Breakout
Clause 4.3.2.2.1 specifies PDU Session establishment in the non-roaming and
roaming with local breakout cases. The procedure is used to:
\- Establish a new PDU Session;
\- Handover a PDN Connection in EPS to PDU Session in 5GS without N26
interface;
\- Switching an existing PDU Session between non-3GPP access and 3GPP access.
The specific system behaviour in this case is further defined in clauses 4.9.2
and 4.9.3; or
\- Request a PDU Session for Emergency services.
In the case of roaming, the AMF determines if a PDU Session is to be
established in LBO or Home Routing. In the case of LBO, the procedure is as in
the case of non-roaming with the difference that the AMF, the SMF, the UPF and
the PCF are located in the visited network. PDU Sessions for Emergency
services are never established in Home Routed mode. If Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation is enabled for the PDU session with LBO, the NEF is not used as
the anchor of this PDU Session.
NOTE 1: UE provides both the S-NSSAIs of the Home PLMN and Visited PLMN to the
network as described in clause 5.15.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1: UE-requested PDU Session Establishment for non-roaming and
roaming with local breakout
The procedure assumes that the UE has already registered on the AMF thus
unless the UE is Emergency Registered the AMF has already retrieved the user
subscription data from the UDM.
1\. From UE to AMF: NAS Message (S-NSSAI(s), UE Requested DNN, PDU Session ID,
Request type, Old PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Establishment
Request, [Port Management Information Container])).
In order to establish a new PDU Session, the UE generates a new PDU Session
ID.
The UE initiates the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment procedure by the
transmission of a NAS message containing a PDU Session Establishment Request
within the N1 SM container. The PDU Session Establishment Request includes a
PDU session ID, Requested PDU Session Type, a Requested SSC mode, 5GSM
Capability, PCO, SM PDU DN Request Container, [Number Of Packet Filters],
[Header Compression Configuration], UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate
and [Always-on PDU Session Requested].
The Request Type indicates \"Initial request\" if the PDU Session
Establishment is a request to establish a new PDU Session and indicates
\"Existing PDU Session\" if the request refers to an existing PDU Session
switching between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access or to a PDU Session handover
from an existing PDN connection in EPC. If the request refers to an existing
PDN connection in EPC, the S-NSSAI is set as described in clause 5.15.7.2 of
TS 23.501 [2].
When Emergency service is required and an Emergency PDU Session is not already
established, a UE shall initiate the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment
procedure with a Request Type indicating \"Emergency Request\".
The Request Type indicates \"Emergency Request\" if the PDU Session
Establishment is a request to establish a PDU Session for Emergency services.
The Request Type indicates \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\" if the request
refers to an existing PDU Session for Emergency services switching between
3GPP access and non-3GPP access or to a PDU Session handover from an existing
PDN connection for Emergency services in EPC.
The 5GSM Core Network Capability is provided by the UE and handled by SMF as
defined in clause 5.4.4b of TS 23.501 [2].
The Number Of Packet Filters indicates the number of supported packet filters
for signalled QoS rules for the PDU Session that is being established. The
number of packet filters indicated by the UE is valid for the lifetime of the
PDU Session. For presence condition, see TS 24.501 [25].
The UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate indicates the maximum data rate
up to which the UE can support UP integrity protection. The UE shall provide
the UE Integrity Protection Data Rate capability independently of the Access
Type over which the UE sends the PDU Session Establishment Request.
If the use of header compression for Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation was
negotiated successfully between the UE and the network in the previous
registration procedure, the UE shall include the Header Compression
Configuration, unless \"Unstructured\" PDU Session Type is indicated. The
Header Compression Configuration includes the information necessary for the
header compression channel setup. Optionally, the Header Compression
Configuration may include additional header compression context parameters.
The NAS message sent by the UE is encapsulated by the AN in a N2 message
towards the AMF that should include User location information and Access Type
Information.
The PDU Session Establishment Request message may contain SM PDU DN Request
Container containing information for the PDU Session authorization by the
external DN.
The UE includes the S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI of the current access type.
If the Mapping of Allowed NSSAI was provided to the UE, the UE shall provide
both the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN from the Allowed NSSAI and the corresponding
S-NSSAI of the HPLMN from the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI.
If the procedure is triggered for SSC mode 3 operation, the UE shall also
include the Old PDU Session ID which indicates the PDU Session ID of the on-
going PDU Session to be released, in NAS message. The Old PDU Session ID is
included only in this case.
The AMF receives from the AN the NAS SM message (built in step 1) together
with User Location Information (e.g. Cell Id in the case of the NG-RAN).
The UE shall not trigger a PDU Session establishment for a PDU Session
corresponding to a LADN when the UE is outside the area of availability of the
LADN.
If the UE is establishing a PDU session for IMS and the UE is configured to
discover the P-CSCF address during connectivity establishment, the UE shall
include an indicator that it requests a Pâ€‘CSCF IP address(es) within the SM
container.
The PS Data Off status is included in the PCO in the PDU Session Establishment
Request message.
The UE capability to support Reliable Data Service is included in the PCO in
the PDU Session Establishment Request message.
If the UE has indicated that it supports transfer of Port Management
Information Containers as per UE 5GSM Core Network Capability, then the UE
shall include the MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port used for this PDU
session. If the UE is aware of the UE-DS-TT Residence Time, then the UE shall
additionally include the UE-DS-TT Residence Time.
If the UE requests to establish always-on PDU session, the UE includes an
Always-on PDU Session Requested indication in the PDU Session Establishment
Request message.
Port Management Information Container is received from DS-TT and includes port
management capabilities, i.e. information indicating which standardized and
deployment-specific port management information is supported by DS-TT as
defined in clause 5.28.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
2\. The AMF determines that the message corresponds to a request for a new PDU
Session based on that Request Type indicates \"initial request\" and that the
PDU Session ID is not used for any existing PDU Session of the UE. If the NAS
message does not contain an S-NSSAI, the AMF determines an S-NSSAI of the
Serving PLMN for the requested PDU Session from the current Allowed NSSAI for
the UE. If there is only one S-NSSAI in the Allowed NSSAI, this S-NSSAI shall
be used. If there is more than one S-NSSAI in the Allowed NSSAI, the S-NSSAI
selected is either according to the UE subscription, if the subscription
contains only one default S-NSSAI and the corresponding mapped HPLMN S-NSSAI
of the Serving PLMN is included in the Allowed NSSAI, or based on operator
policy (e.g. also ensures any UE Requested DNN is allowed for the selected
S-NSSAI)). When the NAS Message contains an S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN but it
does not contain a DNN, the AMF determines the DNN for the requested PDU
Session by selecting the default DNN for this S-NSSAI if the default DNN is
present in the UE\'s Subscription Information (or for the corresponding
S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, in the case of LBO); otherwise the serving AMF selects a
locally configured DNN for this S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN. If the AMF cannot
select an SMF (e.g. the UE requested DNN is not supported by the network, or
the UE requested DNN is not in the Subscribed DNN List for the S-NSSAI (or its
mapped value for the HPLMN in the case of LBO) and wildcard DNN is not
included in the Subscribed DNN list), the AMF shall, based on operator
policies received from PCF, either reject the NAS Message containing PDU
Session Establishment Request from the UE with an appropriate cause or request
PCF to replace the UE requested DNN by a selected DNN. If the DNN requested by
the UE is present in the UE subscription information but indicated for
replacement in the operator policies received from PCF, the AMF shall request
the PCF to perform a DNN replacement to a selected DNN. AMF requests DNN
replacement as as specified in clause 4.16.2.1.1. If the DNN requested by the
UE is present in the UE subscription information but not supported by the
network and not indicated for replacement in the operator policies received
from PCF, the AMF shall reject the NAS Message containing PDU Session
Establishment Request from the UE with an appropriate cause value.
The AMF selects an SMF as described in clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2] and
clause 4.3.2.2.3. If the Request Type indicates \"Initial request\" or the
request is due to handover from EPS or from non-3GPP access serving by a
different AMF, the AMF stores an association of the S-NSSAI(s), the DNN, the
PDU Session ID, the SMF ID as well as the Access Type of the PDU Session.
During registration procedures, the AMF determines the use of the Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation or User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation based on UEs
indications in the 5G Preferred Network Behaviour, the serving operator
policies and the network support of CIoT 5GS optimisations. The AMF selects an
SMF that supports Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation or User Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation as described in clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
If the Request Type is \"initial request\" and if the Old PDU Session ID
indicating the existing PDU Session is also contained in the message, the AMF
selects an SMF as described in clause 4.3.5.2 and stores an association of the
new PDU Session ID, the S-NSSAI(s), the selected SMF ID as well as Access Type
of the PDU Session.
If the Request Type indicates \"Existing PDU Session\", the AMF selects the
SMF based on SMF-ID received from UDM. The case where the Request Type
indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" and either the AMF does not recognize the
PDU Session ID or the subscription context that the AMF received from UDM
during the Registration or Subscription Profile Update Notification procedure
does not contain an SMF ID corresponding to the PDU Session ID constitutes an
error case. The AMF updates the Access Type stored for the PDU Session.
If the Request Type indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" referring to an
existing PDU Session moved between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, then if
the Serving PLMN S-NSSAI of the PDU Session is present in the Allowed NSSAI of
the target access type, the PDU Session Establishment procedure can be
performed in the following cases:
\- the SMF ID corresponding to the PDU Session ID and the AMF belong to the
same PLMN;
\- the SMF ID corresponding to the PDU Session ID belongs to the HPLMN;
Otherwise the AMF shall reject the PDU Session Establishment Request with an
appropriate reject cause.
NOTE 2: The SMF ID includes the PLMN ID that the SMF belongs to.
The AMF shall reject a request coming from an Emergency Registered UE and the
Request Type indicates neither \"Emergency Request\" nor \"Existing Emergency
PDU Session\". When the Request Type indicates \"Emergency Request\", the AMF
is not expecting any S-NSSAI and DNN value provided by the UE and uses locally
configured values instead. The AMF stores the Access Type of the PDU Session.
If the Request Type indicates \"Emergency Request\" or \"Existing Emergency
PDU Session\", the AMF selects the SMF as described in clause 5.16.4 of TS
23.501 [2].
3\. From AMF to SMF: Either Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request (SUPI,
selected DNN, UE requested DNN, S-NSSAI(s), PDU Session ID, AMF ID, Request
Type, PCF ID, Priority Access, [Small Data Rate Control Status], N1 SM
container (PDU Session Establishment Request), User location information,
Access Type, RAT Type, PEI, GPSI, UE presence in LADN service area,
Subscription For PDU Session Status Notification, DNN Selection Mode, Trace
Requirements, Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation indication, or Control Plane
Only indicator) or Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (SUPI, DNN,
S-NSSAI(s), SM Context ID, AMF ID, Request Type, N1 SM container (PDU Session
Establishment Request), User location information, Access Type, RAT type, PEI,
Serving Network (PLMN ID, or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.18 of TS 23.501
[2])).
If the AMF does not have an association with an SMF for the PDU Session ID
provided by the UE (e.g. when Request Type indicates \"initial request\"), the
AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request, but if the AMF
already has an association with an SMF for the PDU Session ID provided by the
UE (e.g. when Request Type indicates \"existing PDU Session\"), the AMF
invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request.
The AMF sends the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN from the Allowed NSSAI to the
SMF. For roaming scenario in local breakout (LBO), the AMF also sends the
corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN from the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI to the
SMF.
The AMF ID is the UE\'s GUAMI which uniquely identifies the AMF serving the
UE. The AMF forwards the PDU Session ID together with the N1 SM container
containing the PDU Session Establishment Request received from the UE. The
GPSI shall be included if available at AMF.
The AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type, see clause 4.2.2.2.1.
The AMF provides the PEI instead of the SUPI when the UE in limited service
state has registered for Emergency services (i.e. Emergency Registered)
without providing a SUPI. The PEI is defined in clause 5.9.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
If the UE in limited service state has registered for Emergency services (i.e.
Emergency Registered) with a SUPI but has not been authenticated the AMF
indicates that the SUPI has not been authenticated. The SMF determines that
the UE has not been authenticated when it does not receive a SUPI for the UE
or when the AMF indicates that the SUPI has not been authenticated.
If the AMF determines that the selected DNN corresponds to an LADN then the
AMF provides the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" that indicates if the UE
is IN or OUT of the LADN service area.
If the Old PDU Session ID is included in step 1 and if the SMF is not to be
reallocated, the AMF also includes Old PDU Session ID in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request.
DNN Selection Mode is determined by the AMF. It indicates whether an
explicitly subscribed DNN has been provided by the UE in its PDU Session
Establishment Request.
The SMF may use DNN Selection Mode when deciding whether to accept or reject
the UE request.
When the Establishment cause received as part of AN parameters during the
Registration procedure or Service Request procedure is associated with
priority services (e.g. MPS, MCS), the AMF includes a Message Priority header
to indicate priority information. The SMF uses the Message Priority header to
determine if the UE request is subject to exemption from NAS level congestion
control. Other NFs relay the priority information by including the Message
Priority header in service-based interfaces, as specified in TS 29.500 [17].
In the local breakout case, if the SMF (in the VPLMN) is not able to process
some part of the N1 SM information that Home Routed Roaming is required and
the SMF responds to the AMF that it is not the right SMF to handle the N1 SM
message by invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response service
operation. The SMF includes a proper N11 cause code triggering the AMF to
proceed with home routed case. The procedure starts again at step 2 of clause
4.3.2.2.2.
The AMF may include a PCF ID in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request.
This PCF ID identifies the H-PCF in the non-roaming case and the V-PCF in the
local breakout roaming case.
The AMF includes Trace Requirements if Trace Requirements have been received
in subscription data.
If the AMF decides to use the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation or User
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation as specified in step 2 or to only use Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation for the PDU session as described in clause 5.31.4
of TS 23.501 [2], the AMF sends the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
indication or Control Plane Only indicator to the SMF.
If the AMF determines that the RAT type is NB-IoT and the number of PDU
Sessions with user plane resources activated for the UE has reached the
maximum number of supported user plane resources (0, 1 or 2) based on whether
the UE supports UP data transfer and the UE\'s 5GMM Core Network Capability as
described in Clause 5.31.19 of TS 23.501 [2], the AMF may either reject the
PDU Session Establishment Request or continue with the PDU Session
establishment and include the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation indication
or Control Plane Only indicator to the SMF.
The AMF includes the latest Small Data Rate Control Status if it has stored it
for the PDU Session.
If the RAT type was included in the message, then the SMF stores the RAT type
in SM Context.
If the UE supports CE mode B and and use of CE mode B is not restricted
according to the Enhanced Coverage Restriction information in the UE context
in the AMF, then the AMF shall include the extended NAS-SM timer indication.
Based on the extended NAS-SM timer indication, the SMF shall use the extended
NAS-SM timer setting for the UE as specified in TS 24.501 [25].
4\. If Session Management Subscription data for corresponding SUPI, DNN and
S-NSSAI of the HPLMN is not available, then SMF retrieves the Session
Management Subscription data using Nudm_SDM_Get (SUPI, Session Management
Subscription data, selected DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, Serving PLMN ID, [NID])
and subscribes to be notified when this subscription data is modified using
Nudm_SDM_Subscribe (SUPI, Session Management Subscription data, selected DNN,
S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, Serving PLMN ID, [NID]). UDM may get this information
from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query (SUPI, Subscription Data, Session Management
Subscription data, selected DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, Serving PLMN ID, [NID])
and may subscribe to notifications from UDR for the same data by
Nudr_DM_subscribe.
The SMF may use DNN Selection Mode when deciding whether to retrieve the
Session Management Subscription data e.g. if the (selected DNN, S-NSSAI of the
HPLMN) is not explicitly subscribed, the SMF may use local configuration
instead of Session Management Subscription data.
If the Request Type in step 3 indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" or \"Existing
Emergency PDU Session\" the SMF determines that the request is due to
switching between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access or due to handover from EPS.
The SMF identifies the existing PDU Session based on the PDU Session ID. In
such a case, the SMF does not create a new SM context but instead updates the
existing SM context and provides the representation of the updated SM context
to the AMF in the response.
If the Request Type is \"Initial request\" and if the Old PDU Session ID is
included in Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request, the SMF identifies the
existing PDU Session to be released based on the Old PDU Session ID.
Subscription data includes the Allowed PDU Session Type(s), Allowed SSC
mode(s), default 5QI and ARP, subscribed Session-AMBR, SMF-Associated external
parameters.
Static IP address/prefix may be included in the subscription data if the UE
has subscribed to it.
The SMF checks the validity of the UE request: it checks
\- Whether the UE request is compliant with the user subscription and with
local policies;
\- (If the selected DNN corresponds to an LADN), whether the UE is located
within the LADN service area based on the \"UE presence in LADN service area\"
indication from the AMF. If the AMF does not provide the \"UE presence in LADN
service area\" indication and the SMF determines that the selected DNN
corresponds to a LADN, then the SMF considers that the UE is OUT of the LADN
service area.
The SMF determines whether the PDU Session requires redundancy and the SMF
determines the RSN as described in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the
SMF determines that redundant handling is not allowed or not possible for the
given PDU Session, the SMF shall either reject the establishment of the PDU
Session or accept the establishment of a PDU session without redundancy
handling based on local policy.
If the UE request is considered as not valid, the SMF decides to not accept to
establish the PDU Session.
NOTE 3: The SMF can, instead of the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, use the
Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report Indication that
triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed data if the
corresponding feature is supported by both the SMF and the UDM.
5\. From SMF to AMF: Either Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response (Cause,
SM Context ID or N1 SM container (PDU Session Reject (Cause))) or an
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response depending on the request received in
step 3.
If the SMF received Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request in step 3 and the
SMF is able to process the PDU Session establishment request, the SMF creates
an SM context and responds to the AMF by providing an SM Context ID.
If the UP Security Policy for the PDU Session is determined to have Integrity
Protection set to \"Required\", the SMF may, based on local configuration,
decide whether to accept or reject the PDU Session request based on the UE
Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate.
NOTE 4: The SMF can e.g. be configured to reject a PDU Session if the UE
Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate has a very low value, if the services
provided by the DN would require higher bitrates.
When the SMF decides to not accept to establish a PDU Session, the SMF rejects
the UE request via NAS SM signalling including a relevant SM rejection cause
by responding to the AMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response. The
SMF also indicates to the AMF that the PDU Session ID is to be considered as
released, the SMF proceeds to step 20 and the PDU Session Establishment
procedure is stopped.
6\. Optional Secondary authentication/authorization.
If the Request Type in step 3 indicates \"Existing PDU Session\", the SMF does
not perform secondary authentication/authorization.
If the Request Type received in step 3 indicates \"Emergency Request\" or
\"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the SMF shall not perform secondary
authentication\authorization.
If the SMF needs to perform secondary authentication/authorization during the
establishment of the PDU Session by a DN-AAA server as described in clause
5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF triggers the PDU Session establishment
authentication/authorization as described in clause 4.3.2.3.
7a. If dynamic PCC is to be used for the PDU Session, the SMF performs PCF
selection as described in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the Request Type
indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" or \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the
SMF shall use the PCF already selected for the PDU Session.
Otherwise, the SMF may apply local policy.
7b. The SMF may perform an SM Policy Association Establishment procedure as
defined in clause 4.16.4 to establish an SM Policy Association with the PCF
and get the default PCC Rules for the PDU Session. The SMF shall include the
3GPP Data Off status if received in step 1. The GPSI shall be included if
available at SMF. If the Request Type in step 3 indicates \"Existing PDU
Session\", the SMF provides information on the Policy Control Request Trigger
condition(s) that have been met by an SMF initiated SM Policy Association
Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1. The PCF may provide
policy information defined in clause 5.2.5.4 (and in TS 23.503 [20]) to SMF.
The PCF, based on the Emergency DNN, sets the ARP of the PCC rules to a value
that is reserved for Emergency services as described in TS 23.503 [20].
NOTE 5: The purpose of step 7 is to receive PCC rules before selecting UPF. If
PCC rules are not needed as input for UPF selection, step 7 can be performed
after step 8.
8\. If the Request Type in step 3 indicates \"Initial request\", the SMF
selects an SSC mode for the PDU Session as described in clause 5.6.9.3 of TS
23.501 [2]. The SMF also selects one or more UPFs as needed as described in
clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. In the case of PDU Session Type IPv4 or IPv6 or
IPv4v6, the SMF allocates an IP address/prefix for the PDU Session (unless
configured otherwise) as described in clause 5.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. In the
case of PDU Session Type IPv6 or IPv4v6, the SMF also allocates an interface
identifier to the UE for the UE to build its link-local address. For
Unstructured PDU Session Type the SMF may allocate an IPv6 prefix for the PDU
Session and N6 point-to-point tunnelling (based on UDP/IPv6) as described in
clause 5.6.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. For Ethernet PDU Session Type, neither a MAC
nor an IP address is allocated by the SMF to the UE for this PDU Session.
If the AMF indicated Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation in step 3 for this
PDU session, then,
1) For Unstructured PDU Session Type, the SMF checks whether UE\'s
subscription include a \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" for the DNN/S-NSSAI
combination. When the \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" is present in the UE\'s
subscription data, the SMF will select the NEF identified for the S-NSSAI and
selected DNN in the \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" as the anchor of this PDU
Session. Otherwise, the SMF will select a UPF as the anchor of this PDU
Session.
2) For other PDU Session Types, the SMF will perform UPF selection to select a
UPF as the anchor of this PDU Session.
If the Request Type in Step 3 is \"Existing PDU Session\", the SMF maintains
the same IP address/prefix that has already been allocated to the UE in the
source network.
If the Request Type in step 3 indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" referring to
an existing PDU Session moved between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access the SMF
maintains the SSC mode of the PDU Session, the current PDU Session Anchor and
IP address.
NOTE 6: The SMF may decide to trigger e.g. new intermediate UPF insertion or
allocation of a new UPF as described in step 5 in clause 4.2.3.2.
If the Request Type indicates \"Emergency Request\", the SMF selects the UPF
as described in clause 5.16.4 of TS 23.501 [2] and selects SSC mode 1.
SMF may select a UPF (e.g. based on requested DNN/S-NSSAI) that supports NW-TT
functionality.
9\. SMF may perform an SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification
procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1 to provide information on the Policy
Control Request Trigger condition(s) that have been met. If Request Type is
\"initial request\" and dynamic PCC is deployed and PDU Session Type is IPv4
or IPv6 or IPv4v6, SMF notifies the PCF (if the Policy Control Request Trigger
condition is met) with the allocated UE IP address/prefix(es).
NOTE 7: If an IP address/prefix has been allocated before step 7 (e.g.
subscribed static IP address/prefix in UDM/UDR) or the step 7 is perform after
step 8, the IP address/prefix can be provided to PCF in step 7 and the IP
address/prefix notification in this step can be skipped.
PCF may provide updated policies to the SMF. The PCF may provide policy
information defined in clause 5.2.5.4 (and in TS 23.503 [20]) to SMF.
10\. If Request Type indicates \"initial request\", the SMF initiates an N4
Session Establishment procedure with the selected UPF(s), otherwise it
initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure with the selected UPF(s):
10a. The SMF sends an N4 Session Establishment/Modification Request to the UPF
and provides Packet detection, enforcement and reporting rules to be installed
on the UPF for this PDU Session. If the SMF is configured to request IP
address allocation from UPF as described in clause 5.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2] then
the SMF indicates to the UPF to perform the IP address/prefix allocation and
includes the information required for the UPF to perform the allocation. If
the selective User Plane deactivation is required for this PDU Session, the
SMF determines the Inactivity Timer and provides it to the UPF. The SMF
provides Trace Requirements to the UPF if it has received Trace Requirements.
If the Reliable Data Service is enabled for the PDU Session by the SMF as
specified in TS 23.501 [2], the RDS Configuration information is provided to
the UPF in this step. The SMF provides Small Data Rate Control parameters to
the UPF for the PDU Session, if required. The SMF provides the Small Data Rate
Control Status to the UPF, if received from the AMF. If the Serving PLMN
intends to enforce Serving PLMN Rate Control (see clause 5.31.14.2 of TS
23.501 [2]) for this PDU session then the SMF shall provide Serving PLMN Rate
Control parameters to UPF for limiting the rate of downlink control plane data
packets.
For a PDU Session of type Ethernet, SMF (e.g. for a certain requested
DNN/S-NSSAI) may include an indication to request UPF to provide port numbers.
If SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for one or more QoS Flows of
the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.1.2 of TS 23.501 [2], two CN
Tunnel Info are requested by the SMF from the UPF. The SMF also indicates the
UPF to eliminate the duplicated packet for the QoS Flow in uplink direction.
The SMF indicates the UPF that one CN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy
tunnel of the PDU session described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
If SMF decides to insert two I-UPFs between the PSA UPF and the NG-RAN for
redundant transmission as described in clause 5.33.1.2 of TS 23.501 [2], the
SMF requests the corresponding CN Tunnel Info and provides them to the I-UPFs
and PSA UPF respectively. The SMF also indicates the PSA UPF to eliminate the
duplicated packet for the QoS Flow in uplink direction. The SMF indicates the
PSA UPF that one CN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU
session described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE 8: The method to perform elimination and reordering on RAN/UPF based on
the packets received from the two GTP-U tunnels is up to RAN/UPF
implementation. The two GTP-U tunnels are terminated at the same RAN node and
UPF.
If Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU session and the
SMF selects the NEF as the anchor of this PDU Session in step 8, the SMF
performs SMF-NEF Connection Establishment Procedure as described in clause
4.25.2.
10b. The UPF acknowledges by sending an N4 Session Establishment/Modification
Response.
If the SMF indicates in step 10a that IP address/prefix allocation is to be
performed by the UPF then this response contains the requested IP
address/prefix. The requested CN Tunnel Info is provided to SMF in this step.
If SMF indicated the UPF to perform packet duplication and elimination for the
QoS Flow in step 10a, two CN Tunnel Info are allocated by the UPF and provided
to the SMF. If SMF decides to insert two I-UPFs between the PSA UPF and the
NG-RAN for redundant transmission as described in clause 5.33.1.2 of TS 23.501
[2], CN Tunnel Info of two I-UPFs and the UPF (PSA) are allocated by the UPFs
and provided to the SMF. The UPF indicates the SMF that one CN Tunnel Info is
used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described in clause
5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
If SMF requested UPF to provide port numbers then UPF includes the DS-TT port
and Bridge ID in the response according to TS 23.501 [2].
If multiple UPFs are selected for the PDU Session, the SMF initiate N4 Session
Establishment/Modification procedure with each UPF of the PDU Session in this
step.
NOTE 9: If the PCF has subscribed to the UE IP address change Policy Control
Trigger (as specified in clause 6.1.3.5 of TS 23.503 [20]) then the SMF
notifies the PCF about the IP address/prefix allocated by the UPF. This is not
shown in figure 4.3.2.2.1-1.
11\. SMF to AMF: Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (PDU Session ID, N2 SM
information (PDU Session ID, QFI(s), QoS Profile(s), CN Tunnel Info, S-NSSAI
from the Allowed NSSAI, Session-AMBR, PDU Session Type, User Plane Security
Enforcement information, UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate, RSN), N1
SM container (PDU Session Establishment Accept ([QoS Rule(s) and QoS Flow
level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS
rule(s)], selected SSC mode, S-NSSAI(s), UE Requested DNN, allocated IPv4
address, interface identifier, Session-AMBR, selected PDU Session Type,
[Reflective QoS Timer] (if available), [P-CSCF address(es)], [Control Plane
Only indicator], [Header Compression Configuration], [Always-on PDU Session
Granted], [Small Data Rate Control parameters], [Small Data Rate Control
Status], [Serving PLMN Rate Control]))). If multiple UPFs are used for the PDU
Session, the CN Tunnel Info contains tunnel information related with the UPFs
that terminate N3.
The SMF may provide the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning to the
AMF by invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (SMF derived CN assisted
RAN parameters tuning) service. The AMF stores the SMF derived CN assisted RAN
parameters tuning in the associated PDU Session context for this UE.
The N2 SM information carries information that the AMF shall forward to the
(R)AN which includes:
\- The CN Tunnel Info corresponds to the Core Network address(es) of the N3
tunnel corresponding to the PDU Session. If two CN Tunnel Info are included
for the PDU session for redundant transmission, the SMF also indicates the NG-
RAN that one of the CN Tunnel Info used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU
session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
\- One or multiple QoS profiles and the corresponding QFIs can be provided to
the (R)AN. This is further described in clause 5.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF
may indicate for each QoS Flow whether redundant transmission shall be
performed by a corresponding redundant transmission indicator.
\- The PDU Session ID may be used by AN signalling with the UE to indicate to
the UE the association between (R)AN resources and a PDU Session for the UE.
\- A PDU Session is associated to an S-NSSAI of the HPLMN and, if applicable,
to a S-NSSAI of the VPLMN and a DNN. The S-NSSAI provided to the (R)AN, is the
S-NSSAI with the value for the Serving PLMN (i.e. the HPLMN S-NSSAI or, in LBO
roaming case, the VPLMN S-NSSAI).
\- User Plane Security Enforcement information is determined by the SMF as
described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
\- If the User Plane Security Enforcement information indicates that Integrity
Protection is \"Preferred\" or \"Required\", the SMF also includes the UE
Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate as received in the PDU Session
Establishment Request.
\- The use of the RSN parameter by NG-RAN is described in clause 5.33.2.1 of
TS 23.501 [2].
The N1 SM container contains the PDU Session Establishment Accept that the AMF
shall provide to the UE. If the UE requested P-CSCF discovery then the message
shall also include the P-CSCF IP address(es) as determined by the SMF and as
described in clause 5.16.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. The PDU Session Establishment
Accept includes S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI. For LBO roaming scenario, the
PDU Session Establishment Accept includes the S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI
for the VPLMN and also it includes the corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN from
the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI that SMF received in step 3.
If the PDU Session being established was requested to be an always-on PDU
Session, the SMF shall indicate whether the request is accepted by including
an Always-on PDU Session Granted indication in the PDU Session Establishment
Accept message. If the PDU Session being established was not requested to be
an always-on PDU Session but the SMF determines that the PDU Session needs to
be established as an always-on PDU Session, the SMF shall include an Always-on
PDU Session Granted indication in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message
indicating that the PDU session is an always-on PDU Session.
If Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU session, the N2
SM information is not included in this step. If Control Plane CIoT 5GS
optimisation is enabled for this PDU session and the UE has sent the Header
Compression Configuration in the PDU Session Establishment Request and the SMF
supports the header compression parameters, the SMF shall include the Header
Compression Configuration in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message. If
the UE has included Header Compression context parameters in Header
Compression Configuration in the PDU Session Establishment Request, the SMF
shall establish the header compression context and may acknowledge the Header
Compression context parameters. If the header compression context is not
established during the PDU Session Establishment procedure, before using the
compressed format for sending the data, the UE and the SMF need to establish
the header compression context based on the Header Compression Configuration.
If the SMF has received the Control Plane Only Indicator in step 3, the SMF
shall include the Control Plane Only Indicator in the PDU Session
Establishment Accept message. The SMF shall indicate the use of Control Plane
only on its CDR. If the Small Data Rate Control is configured in the SMF, the
SMF shall also include Small Data Rate Control parameters and the Small Data
Rate Control Status (if received from the AMF) in the PDU Session
Establishment Accept message as described in clause 5.31.14.3 of TS 23.501
[2]. If the Serving PLMN intends to enforce Serving PLMN Rate Control (see
clause 5.31.14.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) for this PDU session then the SMF shall
include the Serving PLMN Rate Control parameters in the PDU Session
Establishment Accept message. The UE shall store and use Serving PLMN Rate
Control parameters as the maximum allowed limit of uplink control plane user
data.
If the UE indicates the support of RDS in the PCO in the PDU Session
Establishment Request and RDS is enabled for the PDU Session, the SMF shall
inform the UE that RDS is enabled in the PCO in the PDU Session Establishment
Accept (see clause 5.31.6 of TS 23.501 [2]).
If the NIDD parameters (e.g. maximum packet size) were received from NEF
during the SMF-NEF Connection Establishment procedure in step 10, the SMF
shall inform the UE of the NIDD parameters in the PCO in the PDU Session
Establishment Accept (see clause 5.31.5 of TS 23.501 [2]).
Multiple QoS Rules, QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS
Flow(s) associated with those QoS rule(s) and QoS Profiles may be included in
the PDU Session Establishment Accept within the N1 SM and in the N2 SM
information.
The Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer contains the PDU Session ID
allowing the AMF to know which access towards the UE to use.
If the PDU session establishment failed anywhere between step 5 and step 11,
then the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer request shall include the N1
SM container with a PDU Session Establishment Reject message (see clause 8.3.3
of TS 24.501 [25]) and shall not include any N2 SM container. The (R)AN sends
the NAS message containing the PDU Session Establishment Reject to the UE. In
this case, steps 12-17 are skipped.
12\. AMF to (R)AN: N2 PDU Session Request (N2 SM information, NAS message (PDU
Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Establishment Accept)), [CN assisted
RAN parameters tuning]). If the N2 SM information is not included in the step
11, an N2 Downlink NAS Transport message is used instead.
The AMF sends the NAS message containing PDU Session ID and PDU Session
Establishment Accept targeted to the UE and the N2 SM information received
from the SMF within the N2 PDU Session Request to the (R)AN.
If the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning are stored for the
activated PDU Session(s), the AMF may derive updated CN assisted RAN
parameters tuning and provide them the (R)AN.
13\. (R)AN to UE: The (R)AN may issue AN specific signalling exchange with the
UE that is related with the information received from SMF. For example, in the
case of a NG-RAN, an RRC Connection Reconfiguration may take place with the UE
establishing the necessary NG-RAN resources related to the QoS Rules for the
PDU Session request received in step 12.
(R)AN also allocates (R)AN Tunnel Info for the PDU Session. In the case of
Dual Connectivity, the Master RAN node may assign some (zero or more) QFIs to
be setup to a Master RAN node and others to the Secondary RAN node. The AN
Tunnel Info includes a tunnel endpoint for each involved (R)AN node and the
QFIs assigned to each tunnel endpoint. A QFI can be assigned to either the
Master RAN node or the Secondary RAN node and not to both.
If the (R)AN receives two CN Tunnel Info for a PDU session in step 12 for
redundant transmission, (R)AN also allocates two AN Tunnel Info
correspondingly and indicate to SMF one of the AN Tunnel Info is used as the
redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS
23.501 [2].
(R)AN forwards the NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session
Establishment Accept)) provided in step 12 to the UE. (R)AN shall only provide
the NAS message to the UE if the AN specific signalling exchange with the UE
includes the (R)AN resource additions associated to the received N2 command.
If MICO mode is active and the NAS message Request Type in step 1 indicated
\"Emergency Request\", then the UE and the AMF shall locally deactivate MICO
mode.
If the N2 SM information is not included in the step 11, then the following
steps 14 to 16b and step 17 are omitted.
14\. (R)AN to AMF: N2 PDU Session Response (PDU Session ID, Cause, N2 SM
information (PDU Session ID, AN Tunnel Info, List of accepted/rejected QFI(s),
User Plane Enforcement Policy Notification)).
The AN Tunnel Info corresponds to the Access Network address of the N3 tunnel
corresponding to the PDU Session.
If the (R)AN rejects QFI(s) the SMF is responsible of updating the QoS rules
and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow associated with
the QoS rule(s) in the UE accordingly.
The NG-RAN rejects the establishment of UP resources for the PDU Session when
it cannot fulfil User Plane Security Enforcement information with a value of
Required. The NG-RAN notifies the SMF when it cannot fulfil a User Plane
Security Enforcement with a value of Preferred.
If the NG-RAN cannot establish redundant user plane for the PDU Session as
indicated by the RSN parameter, the NG-RAN takes the decision on whether to
reject the establishment of RAN resources for the PDU Session based on local
policies as described in TS 23.501 [2].
15\. AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (SM Context ID, N2 SM
information, Request Type).
The AMF forwards the N2 SM information received from (R)AN to the SMF.
If the list of rejected QFI(s) is included in N2 SM information, the SMF shall
release the rejected QFI(s) associated QoS profiles.
If the N2 SM information indicates failure of user plane resource setup, the
SMF shall reject the PDU session establishment by including a N1 SM container
with a PDU Session Establishment Reject message (see clause 8.3.3 of TS 24.501
[25]) in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response in step 17. Step 16 is
skipped in this case and instead the SMF releases the N4 Session with UPF.
If the User Plane Enforcement Policy Notification in the N2 SM information
indicates that no user plane resources could be established and the User Plane
Enforcement Policy indicated \"required\" as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS
23.501 [2], the SMF shall reject the PDU session establishment by including a
N1 SM container with a PDU Session Establishment Reject message (see clause
8.3.3 of TS 24.501 [25]) in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response in
step 17. Step 16 is skipped in this case.
16a. The SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure with the UPF. The
SMF provides AN Tunnel Info to the UPF as well as the corresponding forwarding
rules.
If SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for one or more QoS Flows of
the PDU, the SMF also indicates the UPF to perform packet duplication for the
QoS Flow(s) in downlink direction by forwarding rules.
In the case of redundant transmission with two I-UPFs for one or more QoS
Flows of the PDU, the SMF provides AN Tunnel Info to two I-UPFs and also
indicates the UPF (PSA) to perform packet duplication for the QoS Flow(s) in
downlink direction by forwarding rules. The SMF also provides the UL Tunnel
Info of the UPF (PSA) to the two I-UPFs and the DL Tunnel Info of the two
I-UPFs to the UPF (PSA).
NOTE 10: If the PDU Session Establishment Request was due to mobility between
3GPP and non-3GPP access or mobility from EPC, the downlink data path is
switched towards the target access in this step.
16b. The UPF provides an N4 Session Modification Response to the SMF.
If multiple UPFs are used in the PDU Session, the UPF in step 16 refers to the
UPF terminating N3.
After this step, the UPF delivers any down-link packets to the UE that may
have been buffered for this PDU Session.
16c. If Request Type in step 3 indicates neither \"Emergency Request\" nor
\"Existing Emergency PDU Session\" and, if the SMF has not yet registered for
this PDU Session, then the SMF registers with the UDM using
Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI, PDU Session ID, SMF Identity,
Serving PLMN ID, [NID]) for a given PDU Session. As a result, the UDM stores
following information: SUPI, SMF identity and the associated DNN, S-NSSAI, PDU
Session ID and Serving Network (PLMN ID, [NID], see clause 5.18 of TS 23.501
[2]). The UDM may further store this information in UDR by Nudr_DM_Update
(SUPI, Subscription Data, UE context in SMF data).
If the Request Type received in step 3 indicates \"Emergency Request\":
\- For an authenticated non-roaming UE, based on operator configuration (e.g.
related with whether the operator uses a fixed SMF for Emergency calls, etc.),
the SMF may register in the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, PDU
Session ID, SMF identity, Indication of Emergency Services) for a given PDU
Session that is applicable for emergency services. As a result, the UDM shall
store the applicable PDU Session for Emergency services.
\- For an unauthenticated UE or a roaming UE, the SMF shall not register in
the UDM for a given PDU Session.
17\. SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (Cause).
The SMF may subscribe to the UE mobility event notification from the AMF (e.g.
location reporting, UE moving into or out of Area Of Interest), after this
step by invoking Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation as specified
in clause 5.2.2.3.2. For LADN, the SMF subscribes to the UE moving into or out
of LADN service area event _notification by providing the LADN DNN as an
indicator for the Area Of Interest (see clause 5.6.5 and 5.6.11 of TS 23.501
[2])._
After this step, the AMF forwards relevant events subscribed by the SMF.
18\. [Conditional] SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (Release)
If during the procedure, any time after step 5, the PDU Session establishment
is not successful, the SMF informs the AMF by invoking
Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (Release). The SMF also releases any N4
session(s) created, any PDU Session address if allocated (e.g. IP address) and
releases the association with PCF, if any. In this case, step 19 is skipped.
19\. SMF to UE: In the case of PDU Session Type IPv6 or IPv4v6, the SMF
generates an IPv6 Router Advertisement and sends it to the UE. If Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU Session the SMF sends the
IPv6 Router Advertisement via the AMF for transmission to the UE using the
Mobile Terminated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
procedures (see clause 4.24.2), otherwise the SMF sends the IPv6 Router
Advertisement via N4 and the UPF.
20\. When the trigger for 5GS Bridge information available is armed, then the
SMF may initiate the SM Policy Association Modification as described in
4.16.5.1.
If the UE has indicated support of transferring Port Management Information
Containers, then SMF informs PCF that a 5GS Bridge information is available.
SMF provides the 5GS Bridge information (e.g. 5GS Bridge ID, port number of
the DS-TT Ethernet port, MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port and UE-DS-TT
Residence Time as provided by the UE) to PCF. TSN AF calculates the bridge
delay for each port pair, i.e. composed of DS-TT Ethernet port and NW-TT
Ethernet port, using the UE-DS-TT Residence Time for all NW-TT Ethernet
port(s) serving the 5GS Bridge indicated by the 5GS Bridge ID. If SMF received
a Port Management Information Container from either the UE or the UPF, then
SMF provides the Port Management Information Container and port number of the
related port to the PCF as described in clause 5.28.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. If
SMF received a Bridge Management Information Container from the UPF, then SMF
provides the Bridge Management Information Container to the PCF as described
in clause 5.28.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
21\. If the PDU Session establishment failed after step 4, the SMF shall
perform the following:
The SMF unsubscribes to the modifications of Session Management Subscription
data for the corresponding (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN), using
Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe (SUPI, Session Management Subscription data, DNN, S-NSSAI
of the HPLMN), if the SMF is no more handling a PDU Session of the UE for this
(DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN). The UDM may unsubscribe to the modification
notification from UDR by Nudr_DM_Unsubscribe (SUPI, Subscription Data, Session
Management Subscription data, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, DNN).
##### 4.3.2.2.2 Home-routed Roaming
This procedure is used in the case of home-routed roaming scenarios.
Figure 4.3.2.2.2-1: UE-requested PDU Session Establishment for home-routed
roaming scenarios
1\. This step is the same as step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1.
2\. As in step 2 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 except that, if the UE does not include
an S-NSSAI in the PDU Session request, both a Serving PLMN S-NSSAI (in the
Allowed NSSAI) and its corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI values are selected by the
AMF. Also, the AMF in the serving PLMN selects both an SMF in the Serving PLMN
using the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN mapping to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN
used for the PDU Session and, additionally an SMF in the HPLMN using the
S-NSSAI of the HPLMN used for the PDU Session, as described in clause
4.3.2.2.3. The AMF may also receive alternative H-SMFs from the NRF. If
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for the PDU Session, the AMF
selects V-SMF and H-SMF that supports the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
(see clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]). The AMF stores the association of the
S-NSSAI(s), the DNN, the PDU Session ID, the SMF ID in VPLMN as well as Access
Type of the PDU Session. Whether to perform DNN replacement is based on
operator agreement.
In step 3 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, in local breakout roaming case, if V-SMF
responds to AMF indicating that V-SMF is not able to process some part of the
N1 SM information, the AMF proceeds with home routed case from this step and
may select an SMF in the VPLMN different from the V-SMF selected earlier.
3a. As in step 3 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the addition that:
\- the AMF also provides the identity of the H-SMF it has selected in step 2
and both the VPLMN S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI and the corresponding
S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, which is in the mapping the VPLMN S-NSSAI from the
Allowed NSSAI. The H-SMF is provided when the PDU Session is home-routed. The
AMF may also provide the identity of alternative H-SMFs, if it has received in
step 2.
\- The V-SMF does not use DNN Selection Mode received from the AMF but relays
this information to the H-SMF.
If the AMF is reusing an already established association with a V-SMF for the
PDU Session ID provided by the UE (e.g. when Request Type indicates \"existing
PDU Session\"), the AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request.
The AMF may include the H-PCF ID in this step and V-SMF will pass it to the
H-SMF in step 6. This will enable the H-SMF to select the same H-PCF in step
9a.
If Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is used for the PDU Session and the
\"Invoke NEF indication\" in the subscription data is set for the S-NSSAI /
DNN combination, the AMF includes an \"Invoke NEF\" flag in
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request.
3b: This step is the same as step 5 of clause 4.3.2.2.1. If the PDU Session
Type is Unstructured and the V-SMF received an \"Invoke NEF\" flag in step 3a,
then it skips steps 4 and 5.
4\. The V-SMF selects a UPF in VPLMN as described in clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501
[2].
5\. The V-SMF initiates an N4 Session Establishment procedure with the
selected V-UPF:
5a. The V-SMF sends an N4 Session Establishment Request to the V-UPF. The
V-SMF provides Trace Requirements to the V-UPF if the V-SMF has received Trace
Requirements from AMF.
5b. The V-UPF acknowledges by sending an N4 Session Establishment Response.
The CN Tunnel Info is provided to V-SMF in this step.
6\. V-SMF to H-SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request (SUPI, GPSI (if available),
V-SMF SM Context ID, DNN, S-NSSAI with the value defined by the HPLMN, PDU
Session ID, V-SMF ID, V-CN-Tunnel-Info, PDU Session Type, PCO, Number Of
Packet Filters, User location information, Access Type, RAT Type, PCF ID,
[Small Data Rate Control Status], SM PDU DN Request Container, DNN Selection
Mode, Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation Indication, [Always-on PDU Session
Requested], AMF ID, Serving Network, the QoS constraints from the VPLMN)) or
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (V-CN-Tunnel-Info, PCO, User location
information, Access Type, RAT Type, SM PDU DN Request Container, Control Plane
CIoT 5GS Optimisation Indication, [Always-on PDU Session Requested], Serving
Network). Protocol Configuration Options may contain information that H-SMF
may needs to properly establish the PDU Session (e.g. SSC mode or SM PDU DN
Request Container to be used to authenticate the UE by the DN-AAA as defined
in clause 4.3.2.3). The H-SMF may use DNN Selection Mode when deciding whether
to accept or reject the UE request. If the V-SMF does not receive any response
from the H-SMF due to communication failure on the N16 interface, depending on
operator policy the V-SMF may create the PDU Session to one of the alternative
H-SMF(s) if additional H-SMF information is provided in step 3a, as specified
in detail in TS 29.502 [36]. The Small Data Rate Control Status is included if
received from the AMF. The Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation Indication is
set by the V-SMF, if the PDU Session is intended for Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation. The QoS constraints from the VPLMN contains a 5QI and
corresponding ARP value that the VPLMN can accept for the QoS Flow associated
with the default QoS rule and the highest Session-AMBR that the VPLMN can
accept.
NOTE 1: The QoS constraints from the VPLMN are provided by the VPLMN to avoid
the risk that V-SMF rejects the PDU Session in step 13 when controlling SLA
with the HPLMN.
V-SMF SM Context ID contains the addressing information it has allocated for
service operations related with this PDU Session. The H-SMF stores an
association of the PDU Session and V-SMF Context ID for this PDU Session for
this UE.
If the H-SMF needs to use V-SMF services for this PDU Session (invoking
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request) before step 13, at the first invocation of
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request the H-SMF provides the V-SMF with the H-SMF SM
Context ID it has allocated for service operations related with this PDU
Session.
If the RAT type was included in the message, then the H-SMF stores the RAT
type in SM Context.
If the V-SMF has an association with the H-SMF for the indicated PDU Session
ID, the V-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request. Otherwise the V-SMF
invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request.
7-12b. These steps are the same as steps 4-10 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the
following differences:
\- These steps are executed in Home PLMN;
\- The H-SMF does not provides the Inactivity Timer to the H-UPF as described
in step 9a in clause 4.3.2.2.1.
\- If the QoS constraints from the VPLMN is provided in step 6 and PCF is
deployed, the H-SMF provides the QoS constraints from the VPLMN to PCF. The
PCF takes this into account when making policy decisions. In case dynamic PCC
is not deployed, the SMF takes this into account when generating the default
QoS rule.
\- Step 5 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 is not executed.
When PCF is deployed, the SMF shall further report the PS Data Off status to
PCF if the PS Data Off event trigger is provisioned, the additional behaviour
of SMF and PCF for 3GPP PS Data Off is defined in TS 23.503 [20].
12c. This step is the same as step 16c in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following
difference:
\- The H-SMF registers for the PDU Session with the UDM using
Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI with the value defined by the
HPLMN, PDU Session ID).
13\. H-SMF to V-SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response (QoS Rule(s), QoS Flow
level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS
rule(s), PCO including session level information that the V-SMF is not
expected to understand, selected PDU Session Type and SSC mode, Reliable Data
Service Support, H-CN Tunnel Info, QFI(s), QoS profile(s), Session-AMBR,
Reflective QoS Timer (if available), information needed by V-SMF in the case
of EPS interworking such as the PDN Connection Type, User Plane Policy
Enforcement)
If the PDU Session being established was requested to be an always-on PDU
Session, the H-SMF shall indicate to the V-SMF whether the request is accepted
or not via the Always-on PDU Session Granted indication in the response
message to V-SMF. If the PDU Session being established was not requested to be
an always-on PDU Session but the H-SMF determines that the PDU Session needs
to be established as an always-on PDU Session, the H-SMF shall indicate it to
the V-SMF by including Always-on PDU Session Granted indication that the PDU
Session is an always-on PDU Session.
The information that the H-SMF may provide is the same than defined for step
11 of Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1.
The H-CN Tunnel Info contains the tunnel information for uplink traffic
towards H-UPF.
Multiple QoS Rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters for the QoS Flow(s)
associated with the QoS rule(s) may be included in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create
Response.
The V-SMF may apply VPLMN policies related with the SLA negotiated with the
HPLMN or with QoS values supported by the VPLMN; such policies may result in
that V-SMF does not accept the PDU Session or does not accept some of the QoS
Flows requested by the H-SMF. If the V-SMF does not accept the PDU Session,
the V-SMF triggers the V-SMF initiated PDU Session Release procedure from step
1b-3b as defined in clause 4.3.4.3. When the V-SMF accepts at least one QoS
flow, it transfers (via the AMF) the corresponding N2 (and NAS) request
towards the 5G AN (and the UE) but does not issue requests for the QoS Flow(s)
it has rejected due these policies. The V-SMF notifies the H-SMF about the
rejected QoS Flows in step 23 below.
If Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for the PDU Session, certain
information, e.g. H-CN tunnel info, is not provided in the response to V-SMF.
V-SMF stores the indication of Small Data Rate Control applicability on this
PDU Session, if it is received in Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response.
13a-13b. The V-SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure with the
V-UPF. The V-SMF may provide N4 rules to the V-UPF for this PDU Session,
including rules to forward UL traffic to the H-UPF.
14-18. These steps are the same as steps 11-15 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the
following differences:
\- These steps are executed in Visited PLMN;
\- The V-SMF stores an association of the PDU Session and H-SMF ID for this
PDU Session for this UE;
\- If the H-SMF indicates the PDU Session can be established as an always-on
PDU Session, the V-SMF shall further check whether the PDU Session can be
established as an always-on PDU Session based on local policies. The V-SMF
notifies the UE whether the PDU Session is an always-on PDU Session or not via
the Always-on PDU Session Granted indication in the PDU Session Establishment
Accept message.
\- If the N2 SM information indicates failure of user plane resource setup and
the V-SMF rejected the PDU session establishment as described in step 15 in
clause 4.3.2.2.1, step 19 is skipped and instead the V-SMF releases the N4
Session with V-UPF.
\- If an alternative H-SMF is selected for the PDU Session and the
corresponding selected alternative H-SMF ID has not been previously provided
to the AMF, the V-SMF provides the selected alternative H-SMF ID to the AMF.
NOTE 2: The selected alternative H-SMF ID can be provided to AMF earlier, e.g.
in step 8 if PDU Session Authentication/Authorization is performed.
\- If Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for the PDU Session,
steps 19, 20 and 23 below are omitted.
19a. The V-SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure with the V-UPF.
The V-SMF may provide N4 rules to the V-UPF for this PDU Session, including
rules to forward DL traffic to the AN.
19b. The V-UPF provides a N4 Session Modification Response to the V-SMF.
After this step, the V-UPF delivers any down-link packets to the UE that may
have been buffered for this PDU Session.
20\. This step is the same as step 17 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following
differences:
\- The SMF is a V-SMF. The H-SMF and V-SMF subscribe to UE reachability event
from AMF.
21\. This step is same as step 18 in clause 4.3.2.2.1. In addition, if during
the procedure, after step 14, the PDU Session establishment is not successful
as specified in step 15 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, the V-SMF triggers the V-SMF
initiated PDU Session Release procedure from step 1b-3b as defined in clause
4.3.4.3.
22\. H-SMF to UE, via H-UPF and V-UPF in VPLMN: In the case of PDU Session
Type IPv6 or IPv4v6, the H-SMF generates an IPv6 Router Advertisement and
sends it to the UE via N4 and the H-UPF and V-UPF. If the Control Plane CIoT
5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU session the V-UPF forwards the IPv6
Router Advertisement to the V-SMF for transmission to the UE using the Mobile
Terminated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation procedures
(see clause 4.24.2).
23\. If the V-SMF received in step18 an indication that the (R)AN has rejected
some QFI(s) or if the V-SMF has rejected some QFI(s) in step 13, the V-SMF
notifies the H-SMF via a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request. The H-SMF is
responsible of updating accordingly the QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS
parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) in
the UE.
24\. This step is the same as step 20 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following
differences:
\- this step is executed in the Home PLMN;
\- the SMF also deregisters for the given PDU Session using
Nudm_UECM_Deregistration (SUPI, DNN, PDU Session ID). The UDM may update
corresponding UE context by Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, Subscription Data, UE
context in SMF data).
NOTE 3: The SMF in HPLMN can initiate H-SMF initiated PDU Session Release
procedure as defined in clause 4.3.4.3, already after step 13.
##### 4.3.2.2.3 SMF selection
##### 4.3.2.2.3.1 General {#general-11 .H6}
The SMF selection function, as described in clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2], is
supported by the AMF and is used to allocate an SMF that manages the PDU
Session.
The SMF selection function described in this clause does not apply to the
selection of an SMF for Emergency services. For SMF selection for Emergency
services is described in clause 5.16.4.5 of TS 23.501 [2].
Two main branches of deployment scenarios to consider:
\- Non-roaming and roaming with local breakout, see clause 4.3.2.2.3.2
\- Home routed roaming, see clause 4.3.2.2.3.3
In the case of non-roaming and local breakout, there are two operational
scenarios dependent on the configuration of AMF and the deployment option of
NSSF in the serving PLMN.
In the case of home-routed, there are two main options dependent on the
operators\' choices in terms of involvement of NRF, NSSF and configuration of
AMF. The decision of which option to use is part of the roaming agreements.
NOTE: The use of NSI ID and the use of multiple NRFs in the network are
optional and depend on the deployment choices of the operator.
##### 4.3.2.2.3.2 Non-roaming and roaming with local breakout {#non-roaming-
and-roaming-with-local-breakout-1 .H6}
Figure 4.3.2.2.3.2-1: SMF selection for non-roaming and roaming with local
breakout scenarios
This procedure may be skipped altogether if SMF information is available in
the AMF by other means (e.g. locally configured); otherwise:
\- when the serving AMF is aware of the appropriate NRF to be used to select
NFs/services within the corresponding Network Slice instance based on
configuration or based on the Network Slice selection information received
during Registration, only steps 3 and 4 in the following procedure are
executed as described in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.2-1;
\- when the serving AMF is not aware of the appropriate NRF to be used to
select NFs/services within the corresponding Network Slice instance, all steps
in the following procedure are executed as described in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.2-1.
1\. The AMF invokes the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation from the NSSF
in serving PLMN with the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN from the Allowed NSSAI
requested by the UE, PLMN ID of the SUPI, TAI of the UE and the indication
that the request is within a procedure of PDU Session establishment in either
the non-roaming or roaming with local breakout scenario.
2\. The NSSF in serving PLMN selects the Network Slice instance, determines
and returns the appropriate NRF to be used to select NFs/services within the
selected Network Slice instance and optionally may return a NSI ID
corresponding to the Network Slice instance.
3\. AMF queries the appropriate NRF in serving PLMN by issuing the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request including at least the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN
for this PDU Session from the Allowed NSSAI, PLMN ID of the SUPI, DNN and
possibly NSI ID if the AMF has stored an NSI ID for the S-NSSAI of the Serving
PLMN for this PDU Session from the Allowed NSSAI.
NOTE: The list of parameters for SMF selection is defined in clause 6.3.2 of
TS 23.501 [2]. See also clause 5.34.3 of TS 23.501 [2] for I-SMF selection.
4\. The NRF in serving PLMN provides to the AMF, e.g. FQDN or IP address, of a
set of the discovered SMF instance(s) or Endpoint Address(es) of SMF service
instance(s) in Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request response message and possibly an NSI
ID for the selected Network Slice instance corresponding to the S-NSSAI for
subsequent NRF queries.
##### 4.3.2.2.3.3 Home routed roaming {#home-routed-roaming-1 .H6}
The selection of the SMF in VPLMN is performed in the same way as for non-
roaming and roaming with local breakout (see clause 4.3.2.2.3.2). The
selection of the SMF in HPLMN is performed by means of one of two main
options. Which of these two options to use is decided based on Service Level
Agreements between the operators.
NOTE 1: The procedures described in this clause are not limited to SMF
selection but can be used to discover and select any NF/NF service in the
HPLMN part of a Network Slice instance.
In the first option, requiring the use of NSSF in both the VPLMN and the
HPLMN, the selection of the SMF in HPLMN is performed by means of the
procedure depicted in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.3-1.
Figure 4.3.2.2.3.3-1: Option 1 for SMF selection for home-routed roaming
scenarios
1\. Based on the operator\'s configuration, if the AMF is not aware of the
appropriate NRF to be used to select NFs/services in the HPLMN, the AMF
invokes the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation from the NSSF in VPLMN
with the VPLMN S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI requested by the UE for this PDU
Session, the HPLMN S-NSSAI that maps to the VPLMN S-NSSAI, PLMN ID of the
SUPI, the TAI of the UE and the indication that the request is within a
procedure of PDU Session establishment in the home-routed roaming scenario.
2\. If slicing configuration information for the S-NSSAI in the HPLMN is not
available (e.g. the NSSF has no cached information), the NSSF of the VPLMN
invokes the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation from NSSF of the HPLMN
according to the PLMN ID of SUPI by including the HPLMN S-NSSAI.
3\. The NSSF in HPLMN may include the NSI ID, if needed, for the Network Slice
instance in HPLMN selected for the corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN in the
Nnssf_NSSelection_Get response. The NSSF in HPLMN also includes the
appropriate hNRF to be used to select NFs/services within HPLMN in the
Nnssf_NSSelection_Get response.
4\. The serving NSSF includes in the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get response all the
information that has been received from the NSSF in HPLMN when responding to
the AMF.
5\. The AMF queries the target vNRF using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request by
including PLMN ID of the SUPI, DNN, HPLMN S-NSSAI and possibly an HPLMN NSI ID
if the AMF has stored an NSI ID for the selected Network Slice instance
corresponding to the HPLMN S-NSSAI.
6\. The NRF in serving PLMN identifies NRF in HPLMN (hNRF) based on the
information provided by the NSSF in the serving PLMN and it invokes the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request service from hNRF according the procedure in Figure
4.17.4-1 to get the expected SMF instance(s) deployed in the HPLMN. As the
vNRF in VPLMN triggers the \"NF Discovery\" on behalf of the AMF, the NRF in
the VPLMN shall not replace the information of the NF, i.e. AMF ID, in the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request message it sends to the hNRF.
7-8. The hNRF provides to the AMF, via vNRF, the information e.g. FQDN or IP
address, of a set of the SMF instance(s) in Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request response
message and possibly an NSI ID for the selected Network Slice instance
corresponding to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN for subsequent NRF queries.
When the NSSF is not deployed in HPLMN then the AMF in VPLMN relies on either
the configuration to obtain the NRF in HPLMN or on the option below.
The second option for the selection of the SMF in HPLMN is performed by means
of the procedure depicted in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.3-2.
Figure 4.3.2.2.3.3-2: Option 2 for SMF selection for home-routed roaming
scenarios
1\. Based on the operator\'s configuration, the AMF queries the vNRF with PLMN
ID of the SUPI, PLMN ID of the serving PLMN, DNN, the HPLMN S-NSSAI that maps
to the S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI of the Serving PLMN the UE has
requested, NSI ID (if the AMF has stored an HPLMN NSI ID for the selected
Network Slice instance corresponding to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN) and DNN.
2\. The vNRF queries, on behalf of the AMF in VPLMN, the hNRF identified by
means of the PLMN ID of the SUPI. The NRF in VPLMN requests \"NF Discovery\"
service from hNRF according the procedure in Figure 4.17.4-1 to get the
expected SMF instance(s) deployed in the HPLMN. As the NRF in the serving PLMN
triggers the \"NF Discovery\" on behalf of the AMF, the NRF in the VPLMN shall
not replace the information of the NF, i.e. AMF ID, in the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request message it sends to the hNRF.
Depending on the available information and based on configuration, the hNRF
may either execute steps in 3(A) or in 3(B).
3(A) The hNRF provides to the AMF, via vNRF, the information e.g. FQDN or IP
address, of a set of the discovered SMF instance(s) and possibly an NSI ID for
the selected HPLMN part of the Network Slice instance corresponding to the
S-NSSAI of the HPLMN for subsequent NRF queries in Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request
response message(steps 3a and 3b).
3(B) The hNRF queries, on behalf of the AMF, an appropriate local NRF in HPLMN
(e.g. a slice level NRF); this local NRF provides the IP address or the FQDN
of expected SMF instance(s) and possibly an NSI ID for the selected HPLMN part
of the Network Slice instance corresponding to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN for
subsequent NRF queries (steps 3a and 3b) that the hNRF returns, via vNRF, to
the AMF (steps 3c and 3d).
##### 4.3.2.2.4 Multiple PDU Sessions towards the same DNN and S-NSSAI
A UE may establish multiple PDU Sessions associated with the same DNN and
S-NSSAI and the AMF may select the same SMF or different SMFs as specified in
clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
During PDU Session establishment, the AMF checks if the SMF selection
subscription data indicates that the same SMF is required for multiple PDU
Sessions and if required, the AMF checks if any SMF is already selected for
the same DNN and S-NSSAI, if so, the same SMF will be used for the additional
PDU Session.
NOTE 1: The SMF ID can be notified from UDM to the AMF when one AMF is
selected for 3GPP access in VPLMN and a different AMF is selected in HPLMN for
non-3GPP access.
NOTE 2: The same SMF is selected for multiple PDU Sessions towards the same
DNN and S-NSSAI to facilitate the selection of the same PCF e.g. for the
purpose of usage monitoring.
#### 4.3.2.3 Secondary authorization/authentication by an DN-AAA server during
the PDU Session establishment
The PDU Session establishment authentication/authorization is optionally
triggered by the SMF during a PDU Session establishment and performed
transparently via a UPF or directly with the DN-AAA server without involving
the UPF if the DN-AAA server is located in the 5GC and reachable directly, as
described in clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2].
In the case of Home Routed Roaming, unless specified otherwise, the SMF in the
information flow defined in this clause is the H-SMF.
Figure 4.3.2.3-1: PDU Session Establishment authentication/authorization by a
DN-AAA server
NOTE 1: Steps 2, 3a, 3f and 4 are not defined in this specification. Steps 3
can be repeated depending on the mechanism used.
NOTE 2: When the SMF directly communicates with the DN-AAA server without
involving the UPF, Step 1 is skipped and Step 2, 3a, 3f, 4 and 6 are executed
without involving the UPF.
0\. The SMF determines that it needs to contact the DN-AAA server. The SMF
identifies the DN-AAA server based on local configuration or using the DN-
specific identity (TS 33.501 [15]) provided by the UE inside the SM PDU DN
Request Container provided by the UE in the PDU Session Establishment request
or inside the EAP message in the PDU Session Authentication Complete message
(TS 24.501 [25]).
NOTE 3: The content of the SM PDU DN Request Container is defined in TS 24.501
[25].
1\. If there is no existing N4 session that can be used to carry DN-related
messages between the SMF and the DN, the SMF selects a UPF and triggers N4
session establishment.
2\. The SMF initiates the authentication procedure with the DN-AAA via the UPF
to authenticate the DN-specific identity provided by the UE as specified in TS
29.561 [63].
When available, the SMF provides the GPSI in the signalling exchanged with the
DN-AAA.
The UPF transparently relays the message received from the SMF to the DN-AAA
server.
3a. The DN-AAA server sends an Authentication/Authorization message towards
the SMF. The message is carried via the UPF.
3b. Transfer of DN Request Container information received from DN-AAA towards
the UE.
In non-roaming and LBO cases, the SMF invokes the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation on the AMF to
transfer the DN Request Container information within N1 SM information sent
towards the UE.
In the case of Home Routed roaming, the H-SMF initiates a
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation to request the V-SMF to transfer DN
Request Container to the UE and the V-SMF invokes the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation on the AMF to
transfer the DN Request Container information within N1 SM information sent
towards the UE. In Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request, the H-SMF additionally
includes the H-SMF SM Context ID.
3c: The AMF sends the N1 NAS message to the UE
3d-3e. Transfer of DN Request Container information received from UE towards
the DN-AAA.
When the UE responds with a N1 NAS message containing DN Request Container
information, the AMF informs the SMF by invoking the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation. The SMF issues an
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response.
In the case of Home Routed roaming, the V-SMF relays the N1 SM information to
the H-SMF using the information of PDU Session received in step 3b via a
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation.
3f: The SMF (In HR case it is the H-SMF) sends the content of the DN Request
Container information (authentication message) to the DN-AAA server via the
UPF.
Step 3 may be repeated until the DN-AAA server confirms the successful
authentication/authorization of the PDU Session.
4\. The DN-AAA server confirms the successful authentication/authorization of
the PDU Session. The DN-AAA server may provide:
\- an SM PDU DN Response Container to the SMF to indicate successful
authentication/authorization;
\- DN Authorization Data as defined in clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2];
\- a request to get notified with the IP address(es) allocated to the PDU
Session and/or with N6 traffic routing information or MAC address(es) used by
the UE for the PDU Session; and
\- an IP address (or IPV6 Prefix) for the PDU Session.
The N6 traffic routing information is defined in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501
[2].
After the successful DN authentication/authorization, a session is kept
between the SMF and the DN-AAA. If the SMF receives a DN Authorization Data,
the SMF uses the DN Authorization Profile Index to apply the policy and
charging control (see clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2]).
5\. The PDU Session establishment continues and completes. In the step 7b of
the Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1, if the SMF receives the DN Authorization Profile Index
in DN Authorization Data from the DN-AAA, it sends the DN Authorization
Profile Index to retrieve the PDU Session related policy information
(described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.503 [20]) and the PCC rule(s) (described in
clause 6.3 of TS 23.503 [20]) from the PCF. If the SMF receives the DN
authorized Session AMBR in DN Authorization Data from the DN-AAA, it sends the
DN authorized Session AMBR within the Session AMBR to the PCF to retrieve the
authorized Session AMBR (described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.503 [20]). For PDU
Session of Ethernet type, the SMF may instruct the UPF to handle VLAN
information of the Ethernet frames related with the PDU Session received and
sent on N6 or N19 or internal interface, as described in clause 5.6.10.2 of TS
23.501 [2].
6\. If requested so in step 4 or if configured so by local policies, the SMF
notifies the DN-AAA with the IP/MAC address(es) and/or with N6 traffic routing
information allocated to the PDU Session together with the GPSI.
Later on the SMF notifies the DN-AAA if the DN-AAA had requested to get
notifications about:
.- Allocation or release of an IPV6 Prefix for the PDU Session of IP type or
addition or removal of source MAC addresses for the PDU Session of Ethernet
type (e.g. using IPV6 multi-homing as defined in clause 5.6.4.3 of TS 23.501
[2]).
\- Change of N6 traffic routing information.
When later on the PDU Session gets released as described in clause 4.3.4, the
SMF notifies the DN-AAA.
The DN-AAA server may revoke the authorization for a PDU Session or update DN
authorization data for a PDU Session. According to the request from DN-AAA
server, the SMF may release or update the PDU Session.
At any time after the PDU Session establishment, the DN-AAA server or SMF may
initiate Secondary Re-authentication procedure for the PDU Session as
specified in clause 11.1.3 of TS 33.501 [15]. Step 3a to step 3f are performed
to transfer the Secondary Re-authentication message between the UE and the DN-
AAA server. The Secondary Re-authentication procedure may start from step 3a
(DN-AAA initiated Secondary Re-authentication procedure) or step 3b (SMF
initiated Secondary Re-authentication procedure). For the DN-AAA server
initiated Secondary Re-authentication, the message in step 3a shall include
GPSI, if available and the IP/MAC address(es) of the PDU session, for SMF to
identify the corresponding UE and PDU session.
DN-AAA may initiate DN-AAA Re-authorization without performing re-
authentication based on local policy. DN-AAA Re-authorization procedure may
start from step 4.
During Secondary Re-authentication/Re-authorization, if the SMF receives DN
Authorization Profile Index and/or DN authorized Session AMBR, the SMF reports
the received value(s) to the PCF (as described in TS 23.501 [2]) by triggering
the Policy Control Request Trigger as described in TS 23.503 [20].
### 4.3.3 PDU Session Modification
#### 4.3.3.1 General
The procedure is used when one or several of the QoS parameters exchanged
between the UE and the network are modified.
NOTE: The conditions when to use this procedure for QoS change as well as the
QoS parameters exchanged between the UE and the network are defined in clause
5.7 of TS 23.501 [2].
#### 4.3.3.2 UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (non-roaming and
roaming with local breakout)
The UE or network requested PDU Session Modification procedure (non-roaming
and roaming with local breakout scenario) is depicted in figure 4.3.3.2-1.
Figure 4.3.3.2-1: UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (for non-
roaming and roaming with local breakout)
1\. The procedure may be triggered by following events:
1a. (UE initiated modification) The UE initiates the PDU Session Modification
procedure by the transmission of an NAS message (N1 SM container (PDU Session
Modification Request (PDU session ID, Packet Filters, Operation, Requested
QoS, Segregation, 5GSM Core Network Capability, Number Of Packet Filters,
[Always-on PDU Session Requested])), PDU Session ID, UE Integrity Protection
Maximum Data Rate, [Port Management Information Container]) message. Depending
on the Access Type, if the UE was in CM-IDLE state, this SM-NAS message is
preceded by the Service Request procedure. The NAS message is forwarded by the
(R)AN to the AMF with an indication of User location Information. The AMF
invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (SM Context ID, N1 SM container (PDU
Session Modification Request)).
When the UE requests specific QoS handling for selected SDF(s), the PDU
Session Modification Request includes Packet Filters describing the SDF(s),
the requested Packet Filter Operation (add, modify, delete) on the indicated
Packet Filters, the Requested QoS and optionally a Segregation indication. The
Segregation indication is included when the UE recommends to the network to
bind the applicable SDF(s) on a distinct and dedicated QoS Flow e.g. even if
an existing QoS Flow can support the requested QoS. The network should abide
by the UE request, but is allowed to proceed instead with binding the selected
SDF(s) on an existing QoS Flow.
NOTE 1: Only one QoS Flow is used for traffic segregation. If UE makes
subsequent requests for segregation of additional SDF(s), the additional
SDF(s) are multiplexed on the existing QoS Flow that is used for segregation.
The UE shall not trigger a PDU Session Modification procedure for a PDU
Session corresponding to a LADN when the UE is outside the area of
availability of the LADN.
The PS Data Off status, if changed, shall be included in the PCO in the PDU
Session Modification Request message.
For a PDU Session which was established in the EPS, when the UE moves from EPS
to 5GS _for the first time, the UE_ includes an Always-on PDU Session
Requested indication in the PDU Session Modification Request message if it
wants to change the PDU Session to an always-on PDU Session.
When PCF is deployed, the SMF shall further report the PS Data Off status to
PCF if the PS Data Off event trigger is provisioned, the additional behaviour
of SMF and PCF for 3GPP PS Data Off is defined in TS 23.503 [20].
The 5GSM Core Network Capability is provided by the UE and handled by SMF as
defined in clause 5.4.4b of TS 23.501 [2].
The UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate indicates the maximum data rate
up to which the UE can support UP integrity protection. It is set as defined
in TS 23.501 [2].
The Number Of Packet Filters indicates the number of supported packet filters
for signalled QoS rules as described in clause 5.17.2.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
Port Management Information Container is received from DS-TT and includes
Ethernet-port related management information as defined in clause 5.28.3 of TS
23.501 [2].
1b. (PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification) The PCF performs a PCF
initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in clause
4.16.5.2 to notify SMF about the modification of policies. This may e.g. have
been triggered by a policy decision or upon AF requests, e.g. Application
Function influence on traffic routing as described in step 5 in clause 4.3.6.2
or AF to provide Port management information Container.
If the QoS Monitoring for URLLC is requested by the AF, the PCF generates the
QoS Monitoring policy for the corresponding service data flow and provides the
policy in the PCC rules to the SMF in this step.
1c. (SMF requested modification) The UDM updates the subscription data of SMF
by Nudm_SDM_Notification (SUPI, Session Management Subscription Data). The SMF
updates the Session Management Subscription Data and acknowledges the UDM by
returning an Ack with (SUPI).
1d. (SMF requested modification) The SMF may decide to modify PDU Session.
This procedure also may be triggered based on locally configured policy or
triggered from the (R)AN (see clause 4.2.6 and clause 4.9.1). It may also be
triggered if the UP connection is activated (as described in Service Request
procedure) and the SMF has marked that the status of one or more QoS Flows are
deleted in the 5GC but not synchronized with the UE yet.
If the SMF receives one of the triggers in step 1b \~ 1d, the SMF starts SMF
requested PDU Session Modification procedure.
1e. (AN initiated modification) (R)AN shall indicate to the SMF when the AN
resources onto which a QoS Flow is mapped are released irrespective of whether
notification control is configured. (R)AN sends the N2 message (PDU Session
ID, N2 SM information) to the AMF. The N2 SM information includes the QFI,
User location Information and an indication that the QoS Flow is released. The
AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (SM Context ID, N2 SM
information).
(AN initiated notification control) If notification control is configured for
a GBR QoS Flow, (R)AN sends a N2 message (PDU Session ID, N2 SM information)
to SMF when the (R)AN decides the QoS targets of the QoS Flow cannot be
fulfilled or can be fulfilled again, respectively. The N2 SM information
includes the QFI and an indication that the QoS targets for that QoS Flow
cannot be fulfilled or can be fulfilled again, respectively. When QoS targets
cannot be fulfilled, the N2 SM information indicates a reference to the
Alternative QoS Profile matching the values of the QoS parameters that the NG-
RAN is currently fulfilling as specified in clause 5.7.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2].
The AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (SM Context ID, N2 SM
information). If the PCF has subscribed to the event, SMF reports this event
to the PCF for each PCC Rule for which notification control is set in step 2.
1f. (AMF initiated modification) If the UE supports CE mode B and use of CE
mode changes from restricted to unrestricted or vice versa in the Enhanced
Coverage Restriction information in the UE context in the AMF and the UE has
already established PDU sessions, then the AMF shall trigger a PDU session
modification to the SMFs serving the UE\'s PDU sessions when the AMF
determines that NAS-SM timer shall be updated due to the change of Enhanced
Coverage Restriction and include the extended NAS-SM indication only if use of
CE mode B is now unrestricted in the Enhanced Coverage Restriction information
in the UE context in the AMF.
Based on the extended NAS-SM timer indication, the SMF shall use the extended
NAS-SM timer setting for the UE as specified in TS 24.501 [25].
2\. The SMF may need to report some subscribed event to the PCF by performing
an SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in
clause 4.16.5.1. This step may be skipped if PDU Session Modification
procedure is triggered by step 1b or 1d. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the
SMF may apply local policy to decide whether to change the QoS profile.
Steps 2a to 7 are not invoked when the PDU Session Modification requires only
action at a UPF (e.g. gating).
2a. The SMF may update the UPF with N4 Rules related to new or modified QoS
Flow(s).
NOTE 2: This allows the UL packets with the QFI of a new or modified QoS Flow
to be transferred.
If redundant transmission has not been activated to the PDU session and the
SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for the QoS Flow, the SMF
indicates to the UPF to perform packet duplication and elimination for the QoS
Flow.
If redundant transmission has been activated on the PDU Session and the SMF
decides to stop redundant transmission, the SMF indicates the UPF to release
the CN Tunnel Info which is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session
and also indicates the UPF to stop packet duplication and elimination for the
corresponding QoS Flow(s).
NOTE 3: The method to perform elimination and reordering on RAN/UPF based on
the packets received from the two GTP-U tunnels is up to RAN/UPF
implementation. The two GTP-U tunnels are terminated at the same RAN node and
UPF.
If redundant transmission has not been activated to the PDU Session and the
SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for the QoS Flow with two I-UPFs
between the PSA UPF and the NG-RAN, the SMF sends a N4 Session Establishment
Request message to the I-UPFs including UL CN Tunnel Info of the PSA UPF and a
request to allocate CN Tunnel Info.
2b. The UPF(s) respond to the SMF. If redundant transmission has not been
activated to the PDU session and the SMF indicated the UPF to perform packet
duplication and elimination for the QoS Flow in step 2a, the UPF allocates an
additional CN Tunnel Info. The additional CN Tunnel Info is provided to the
SMF.
If redundant transmission has not been activated to the PDU Session and the
SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for the QoS Flow with two I-UPFs
in step 2a, the UPFs allocate CN Tunnel Info. The CN Tunnel Info of each I-UPF
is provided to the SMF.
3a. For UE or AN initiated modification, the SMF responds to the AMF through
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response ([N2 SM information (PDU Session ID,
QFI(s), QoS Profile(s), [Alternative QoS Profile(s)], Session-AMBR], [CN
Tunnel Info(s)]), N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command (PDU
Session ID, QoS rule(s), QoS rule operation, QoS Flow level QoS parameters if
needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s), Session-AMBR,
[Always-on PDU Session Granted], [Port Management Information Container]))).
See clause 5.7 of TS 23.501 [2] for the QoS Profile, Alternative QoS Profile
and QoS rule and QoS Flow level QoS parameters. Alternative QoS Profile is
only valid for AN initiated modification.
If the PDU Session Modification was requested by the UE to modify a PDU
Session to an always-on PDU Session, the SMF shall include an Always-on PDU
Session Granted indication in the PDU Session Modification Command to indicate
whether the PDU Session is to be changed to an always-on PDU Session or not
via the Always-on PDU Session Granted indication in the PDU Session
Modification Command.
The N2 SM information carries information that the AMF shall provide to the
(R)AN. It may include the QoS profiles and the corresponding QFIs to notify
the (R)AN that one or more QoS flows were added, or modified. It may include
only QFI(s) to notify the (R)AN that one or more QoS flows were removed. The
SMF may indicate for each QoS Flow whether redundant transmission shall be
performed by a corresponding redundant transmission indicator. If the SMF
decides to activate redundant transmission in step 2a, the SMF includes the
allocated additional CN Tunnel Info in the N2 SM information. If the SMF
decides to perform redundant transmission for new QoS Flow with two I-UPFs in
step 2a, the SMF includes the allocated CN Tunnel Info of the two I-UPFs in
the N2 SM information. If the PDU Session Modification was triggered by the
(R)AN Release in step 1e the N2 SM information carries an acknowledgement of
the (R)AN Release. If the PDU Session Modification was requested by the UE for
a PDU Session that has no established User Plane resources, the N2 SM
information provided to the (R)AN includes information for establishment of
User Plane resources.
If redundant transmission has been activated on the PDU Session and the SMF
decides to stop redundant transmission in step 2a, the SMF indicates the (R)AN
to release the AN Tunnel and stop packet duplication and elimination
associated with the redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session.
The N1 SM container carries the PDU Session Modification Command that the AMF
shall provide to the UE. It may include the QoS rules, QoS Flow level QoS
parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) and
corresponding QoS rule operation and QoS Flow level QoS parameters operation
to notify the UE that one or more QoS rules were added, removed or modified.
If port number and a Port Management Information Container have been received
from PCF in Step 2 and the port number matches the port number assigned for
the DS-TT Ethernet port for this PDU session, then SMF includes the Port
Management Information Container in the N1 SM container.
The SMF may need to send transparently through NG-RAN the PDU Session
Modification Command to inform the UE about changes in the QoS parameters
(i.e. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR) that the NG-RAN is currently fulfilling after the SMF
receives QoS Notification Control as defined in clause 5.7.2.4 of TS 23.501
[2]. When the SMF sends on the PDU Session Modification Command transparently
through NG-RAN, the N2 SM information is not included as part of the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.
3b. For SMF requested modification, the SMF invokes
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer ([N2 SM information] (PDU Session ID,
QFI(s), QoS Profile(s), [Alternative QoS Profile(s)], Session-AMBR, [CN Tunnel
Info(s)], QoS Monitoring indication, QoS Monitoring reporting frequency,
[TSCAI(s)]), N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command (PDU Session
ID, QoS rule(s), QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s)
associated with the QoS rule(s), QoS rule operation and QoS Flow level QoS
parameters operation, Session-AMBR))).
The SMF may indicate for each QoS Flow whether redundant transmission shall be
performed by a corresponding redundant transmission indicator. If the SMF
decides to activate redundant transmission in step 2a, the SMF includes the
allocated additional CN Tunnel Info in the N2 SM information. If the SMF
decides to perform redundant transmission for new QoS Flow with two I-UPFs in
step 2a, the SMF includes the allocated CN Tunnel Info of the two I-UPFs in
the N2 SM information.
If redundant transmission has been activated on the PDU Session and the SMF
decides to stop redundant transmission in step 2a, the SMF indicates the (R)AN
to release the AN Tunnel and stop packet duplication and elimination
associated with the redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session.
The SMF indicates the request for QoS Monitoring for the QoS Flow according to
the information received from the PCF in step 1b, or based on SMF local
policy, e.g. when the RAN rejected the creation of a specific QoS Flow for
URLLC. In the case of receiving the QoS Monitoring indication, the RAN enables
the RAN part of UL/DL packet delay measurement for the QoS Flow and the QoS
Monitoring reporting frequency is used by RAN to determine the packet delay
measurement frequency of the RAN part. The TSCAI is defined in clause 5.27.2
of TS 23.501 [2].
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and an ATC is activated, the AMF updates and
stores the UE context based on the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer and
steps 4, 5, 6 and 7 are skipped. When the UE is reachable e.g. when the UE
enters CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF forwards the N1 message to synchronize the
UE context with the UE.
3c. For SMF requested modification due to updated SMF-Associated parameters
from the UDM, the SMF may provide the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters
tuning to the AMF. The SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (SMF
derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning) towards the AMF. The AMF stores the
SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning in the associated PDU Session
context for this UE.
4\. The AMF may send N2 ([N2 SM information received from SMF], NAS message
(PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command))) Message
to the (R)AN.
5\. The (R)AN may issue AN specific signalling exchange with the UE that is
related with the information received from SMF. For example, in the case of a
NG-RAN, an RRC Connection Reconfiguration may take place with the UE modifying
the necessary (R)AN resources related to the PDU Session or if only N1 SM
container is received in step 4 from AMF, RAN transports only the N1 SM
container to the UE.
The (R)AN may consider the updated CN assisted RAN parameters tuning to
reconfigure the AS parameters.
As part of this, the N1 SM container is provided to the UE. If the N1 SM
container includes a Port Management Information Container then the UE
provides the container to DS-TT.
6\. The (R)AN may acknowledge N2 PDU Session Request by sending a N2 PDU
Session Ack (N2 SM information (List of accepted/rejected QFI(s), AN Tunnel
Info, PDU Session ID, Secondary RAT usage data), User location Information)
Message to the AMF. In the case of Dual Connectivity, if one or more QFIs were
added to the PDU Session, the Master RAN node may assign one or more of these
QFIs to a NG-RAN node which was not involved in the PDU Session earlier. In
this case the AN Tunnel Info includes a new N3 tunnel endpoint for QFIs
assigned to the new NG-RAN node. Correspondingly, if one or more QFIs were
removed from the PDU Session, a (R)AN node may no longer be involved in the
PDU Session anymore and the corresponding tunnel endpoint is removed from the
AN Tunnel Info. The NG-RAN may reject QFI(s) if it cannot fulfil the User
Plane Security Enforcement information for a corresponding QoS Profile, e.g.
due to the UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate being exceeded. When
receiving the request for QoS Monitoring, the (R)AN may indicate its rejection
to perform QoS Monitoring, e.g. due to the (R)AN load condition.
If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the NG-RAN node may
provide RAN Usage Data Report. The User Location Information shall include the
serving cell\'s ID and, if Dual Connectivity is activated for the UE, the
PSCell ID.
If the redundant transmission has not been activated to the PDU session and
the SMF indicates to the RAN that one of the QoS Flow shall perform redundant
transmission, the RAN includes an additional AN tunnel info in N2 SM
information.
7\. The AMF forwards the N2 SM information and the User location Information
received from the AN to the SMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service
operation. The SMF replies with a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response.
If the N2 SM information indicates failure of whole N2 SM request (i.e. no
part of the N2 SM request is successful in (R)AN), the SMF assumes that the
NAS PDU, if provided in step 3, was not forwarded by NG-RAN to UE, as
described in TS 38.413 [10]. In this case, if the PDU Session modification is
UE triggered the SMF shall reject the PDU session modification by including a
N1 SM container with a PDU Session Modification Reject message (see clause
8.3.3 of TS 24.501 [25]) in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response in
step 7b. Step 8 is skipped in this case.
Otherwise, the SMF assumes that the NAS PDU was sent to UE successfully. If
the (R)AN rejects QFI(s), the SMF is responsible of updating the QoS rules and
QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with
the QoS rule(s) in the UE accordingly, i.e. the SMF shall trigger a separate
NAS PDU Session Modification procedure after step 11 to align the SM context
of this PDU Session in UE.
8\. The SMF may update N4 session of the UPF(s) that are involved by the PDU
Session Modification by sending N4 Session Modification Request message to the
UPF (see NOTE 3).
The SMF may update the UPF with N4 Rules related to new, modified or removed
QoS Flow(s), unless it was done already in step 2a.
NOTE 4: This allows the DL packets of the new or modified QoS Flow to be
transferred.
If an additional AN Tunnel Info is returned by RAN in step 6, the SMF informs
the UPF about this AN Tunnel Info for redundant transmission. In the case of
redundant transmission with two I-UPFs, the SMF provides AN Tunnel Info to two
I-UPFs. If CN Tunnel Info of two I-UPFs is allocated by the UPFs in step 2b,
the SMF also provides the DL CN Tunnel Info of two I-UPFs to the UPF (PSA).
If the QoS Monitoring for URLLC is enabled for the QoS Flow, the SMF provides
the N4 rules containing the QoS Monitoring policy generated according to the
information received in step 1b to the UPF via the N4 Session Modification
Request message.
If port number and a Port Management Information Container have been received
from PCF in Step 2 and the port number matches the port number of the NW-TT
Ethernet port for this PDU session, then SMF includes the Port Management
Information Container in the N4 Session Modification Request. If the N4
Session Modification Request includes a Port Management Information Container,
then UPF also includes a Port Management Information Container in the N4
Session Modification Response.
9\. The UE acknowledges the PDU Session Modification Command by sending a NAS
message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command
Ack, [Port Management Information Container])) message.
10\. The (R)AN forwards the NAS message to the AMF.
11\. The AMF forwards the N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command
Ack) and User Location Information received from the AN to the SMF via
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation. The SMF replies with a
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response.
If the SMF initiated modification is to delete QoS Flows (e.g. triggered by
PCF) which do not include QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and
the SMF does not receive response from the UE, the SMF marks that the status
of those QoS Flows is to be synchronized with the UE.
12\. The SMF may update N4 session of the UPF(s) that are involved by the PDU
Session Modification by sending N4 Session Modification Request (N4 Session
ID) message to the UPF. For a PDU Session of Ethernet PDU Session Type, the
SMF may notify the UPF to add or remove Ethernet Packet Filter Set(s) and
forwarding rule(s).
NOTE 5: The UPFs that are impacted in the PDU Session Modification procedure
depends on the modified QoS parameters and on the deployment. For example in
the case of the session AMBR of a PDU Session with an UL CL changes, only the
UL CL is involved. This note also applies to the step 8.
13\. If the SMF interacted with the PCF in step 1b or 2, the SMF notifies the
PCF whether the PCC decision could be enforced or not by performing an SMF
initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in clause
4.16.5.1. If the trigger for 5GS Bridge information available is armed and the
SMF received a Port Management Information Container from either UE or UPF,
then SMF provides the Port Management Information Container and the port
number of the related port to the PCF in this step, as described in clause
5.28.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the trigger for 5GS Bridge information available
is armed and the SMF received the Bridge Management Information Container from
UPF, then the SMF provides the Bridge Management Information Container to the
PCF as described in clause 5.28.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
SMF notifies any entity that has subscribed to User Location Information
related with PDU Session change.
If step 1b is triggered to perform Application Function influence on traffic
routing by step 5 in clause 4.3.6.2, the SMF may reconfigure the User Plane of
the PDU Session as described in step 6 in clause 4.3.6.2.
#### 4.3.3.3 UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (home-routed
roaming)
The UE or network requested PDU Session Modification procedure (home-routed
roaming scenario) is depicted in figure 4.3.3.3-1.
Figure 4.3.3.3-1: UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (for home-
routed roaming scenario)
1\. The procedure is triggered by one of the following events:
1a. (UE or serving network requested) As in step 1a of clause 4.3.3.2 with the
addition that:
\- The V-SMF checks whether it can accept the request from the UE;
\- The V-SMF invokes an Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (SM Context ID, UE
request for PDU Session Modification or the QoS modification request from the
VPLMN, UE location information, Time Zone, the current Access Type, PCO,
[Always-on PDU Session Requested]) service operation to inform the H-SMF to
update the PDU Session. The H-SMF responds to the request immediately. If the
AMF notified the V-SMF that the access type of the PDU session can be changed,
as described in the UE Triggered Service Request procedure in clause 4.2.3.2,
the V-SMF shall also indicate that the access type can be changed.
The PS Data Off status, if changed, shall be included in PCO (Protocol
Configuration Option) in the PDU Session Modification Request message.
When PCF is deployed, the SMF shall further report the PS Data Off status to
PCF if the PS Data Off event trigger is provisioned, the additional behaviour
of SMF and PCF for 3GPP PS Data Off is defined in TS 23.503 [20].
1b. (HPLMN requested) This step is the same as step 1b in clause 4.3.3.2. If
the H-SMF received the indication that the access type of the PDU session can
be changed, the H-SMF shall indicate the target access type to the PCF in the
Access Type information of the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update Request.
1c. (HPLMN requested) This step is the same as step 1c in clause 4.3.3.2.
1d. (HPLMN requested) This step is the same as step 1d in clause 4.3.3.2.
1e. As in step 1e of clause 4.3.3.2 with addition that:
\- The AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (SM context ID, N2 SM
information) and sends it to the V-SMF;
\- The V-SMF invokes an Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (SM context ID, ULI, AN
type, QoS Flow to be released) service operation to inform the H-SMF to update
the PDU Session. The H-SMF responds to the request immediately. For AN
initiated notification control in step 1e of clause 4.3.3.2, the V-SMF
includes also QoS Flow notification information as specified in clause 5.7 of
TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE 1: SM Context ID between AMF and V-SMF and between V-SMF and H-SMF are
different. SM Context ID has local significance per SMF instance.
2\. This step is the same as steps 2 in clause 4.3.3.2 with the SMF is H-SMF.
3\. (UE or serving network requested or HPLMN requested) The H-SMF invokes the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (SM Context ID, QoS profiles, [Alternative QoS
profile(s)], Session-AMBR, information needed to build the SM PDU Session
Modification Command message towards the UE including the QoS rule(s) and QoS
Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the
QoS rule(s) and QoS rule operation and the QoS Flow level QoS parameters
operation) service operation to the V-SMF.
Based on operator policies and roaming agreements, the V-SMF may decide to
fully accept or reject the QoS information provided by the H-SMF. The V-SMF
shall also be able to accept a subset of the QoS flows requested to be created
or modified within a single H-SMF request i.e. V-SMF can accept some QoS flows
and reject other QoS flows in same response to H-SMF.
3a-3b (HPLMN requested) These steps are executed if new QoS Flow(s) are to be
created. The SMF updates the UPF with UL Packet Detection Rules of the new QoS
Flow.
NOTE 2: This allows the UL packets with the QFI of the new QoS Flow to be
transferred.
If an Always-on PDU Session Granted indication was provided by the H-SMF to
indicate that the PDU Session is to be changed to an always-on PDU Session,
the V-SMF decides whether to accept or reject the request from the H-SMF based
on local policies.
4a-4b. These steps are the same as step 3a-3b in clause 4.3.3.2 but controlled
from the V-SMF. The V-SMF uses the information received in step 3 to generate
any N1 and/or N2 signalling to be sent towards the UE and/or the (R)AN.
5-7. These steps are the same as step 4-6 in clause 4.3.3.2.
8\. This step is the same as step 7a in clause 4.3.3.2 with the difference
that the SMF is V-SMF.
If the N2 SM information indicates modification failure and the V-SMF rejected
the PDU session modification as described in step 7 in clause 4.3.3.2, step 9
is skipped.
9a-9b are the same as step 8a-8b in clause 4.3.3.2 but executed in Visited
PLMN
10\. This step is the same as step 7b in clause 4.3.3.2 with the difference
that the SMF is V-SMF.
11-12. These steps are the same as steps 8-9 in 4.3.3.2.
13-14. These steps are the same as step 11a-11b in clause 4.3.3.2 but executed
in Visited PLMN.
15\. V-SMF responds to the H-SMF with an Nsmf_PDUSession_Update response
carrying the information like PCO provided by the UE in the SM PDU Session
Modification Command Ack message from the UE to the V-SMF, Secondary RAT usage
data. The H-SMF shall modify the PDU Session context.
If the V-SMF has rejected QFI(s) (step3) or the (R)AN has rejected QFI(s) in
step 6 of Figure 4.3.3.2-1, the H-SMF is responsible of later updating the QoS
rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s)
associated with the QoS rule(s) in the UE.
16-17. These steps are the same as steps 12-13 in clause 4.3.3.2 with the
difference that the SMF is H-SMF.
### 4.3.4 PDU Session Release
#### 4.3.4.1 General
The PDU Session Release procedure is used to release all the resources
associated with a PDU Session, including:
\- The IP address/Prefixes allocated for an IP-based PDU Session; this may
include the release of multiple Prefixes in the case of Multi-homing (as
defined in TS 23.501 [2]).
\- Any UPF resource (including N3/N9/N19 termination) that was used by the PDU
Session. For N19 termination, the UPF resource may be released if all the PDU
Sessions associated with the 5G VN group are released.
\- Any access resource that was used by the PDU Session.
The SMF takes care to notify any entity associated with PDU Session: PCF, DN
(e.g. when DN authorization has taken place at PDU Session establishment),
etc. of a PDU Session Release.
#### 4.3.4.2 UE or network requested PDU Session Release for Non-Roaming and
Roaming with Local Breakout
Figure 4.3.4.2-1 captures both the UE Requested PDU Session Release procedure
and the network requested PDU Session Release procedure. The procedure allows
the UE to request the release of one PDU Session. The procedure also allows
the AMF, the SMF or the PCF to initiate the release of a PDU Session. In the
case of LBO, the procedure is as in the case of non-roaming with the
difference that the AMF, the SMF, the UPF and the PCF are located in the
visited network.
Figure 4.3.4.2-1: UE or network requested PDU Session Release for non-roaming
and roaming with local breakout
1\. The procedure is triggered by one of the following events:
1a. (UE requested) The UE initiates the UE Requested PDU Session Release
procedure by the transmission of an NAS message (N1 SM container (PDU Session
Release Request (PDU session ID)), PDU Session ID) message. The NAS message is
forwarded by the (R)AN to the AMF with an indication of User Location
Information. This message is relayed to the SMF corresponding to the PDU
Session ID via N2 and the AMF. The AMF invokes the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation and provides the N1 SM
container to the SMF together with User Location Information (ULI) received
from the (R)AN.
NOTE 1: Depending on the Access Type, when the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the UE
can trigger a Service Request procedure before being able to release the PDU
Session.
1b. (PDU Session Release initiated by the PCF) The PCF may invoke an SM Policy
Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.6 to request the
release of the PDU Session.
1c. The AMF may invoke the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation
to request the release of the PDU Session in the case of mismatch of PDU
Session status between UE and AMF or other cases where neither N1 nor N2 SM
signalling is needed before the releasing of SM context.
1d. (R)AN may decide to indicate to the SMF that the PDU Session related
resource is released, e.g. when all the QoS Flow(s) of the PDU Session are
released.
NOTE 2: In this case, it\'s up to SMF to decide whether to keep the PDU
Session with user plane connection deactivated or release the PDU Session.
1e. (PDU Session Release initiated by the SMF) The SMF may decide to release a
PDU Session under the following scenarios:
\- Based on a request from the DN (cancelling the UE authorization to access
to the DN);
\- Based on a request from the UDM (subscription change) or from the CHF;
\- If the SMF received an event notification from the AMF that the UE is out
of LADN service area
\- Based on locally configured policy (e.g. the release procedure may be
related with the UPF re-allocation for SSC mode 2 / mode 3); or
\- If the SMF is notified by the (R)AN that the PDU Session resource
establishment has failed during mobility procedure.
If the SMF receives one of the triggers in step 1a, 1b, 1c, or 1e the SMF
starts PDU Session Release procedure.
1f. The AMF may invoke the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation
with a release indication to request the release of the PDU Session where N1
or N2 SM signalling may be needed before releasing the SM context (e.g. due to
a change of the set of network slices for a UE where a network slice instance
is no longer available as described in clause 5.15.5.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2] or
the AAA Server triggered Network Slice-Specific Re-authentication and Re-
authorization procedure fails as specified in clause 4.2.9.2 or the AAA Server
triggered Slice-Specific Authorization Revocation takes place as specified in
clause 4.2.9.4 or AMF determines that Control Plane Only indication associated
with PDU Session is not applicable any longer as described in clause 5.31.4.1
of TS 23.501 [2]).
2\. The SMF releases the IP address / Prefix(es) that were allocated to the
PDU Session and releases the corresponding User Plane resources:
2a. The SMF sends an N4 Session Release Request (N4 Session ID) message to the
UPF(s) of the PDU Session. The UPF(s) shall drop any remaining packets of the
PDU Session and release all tunnel resource and contexts associated with the
N4 Session.
2b. The UPF(s) acknowledges the N4 Session Release Request by the transmission
of an N4 Session Release Response (N4 Session ID, [Small Data Rate Control
Status], [APN Rate Control Status]) message to the SMF.
The UPF includes Small Data Rate Control Status if the PDU Session used Small
Data Rate Control.
If a NEF has been selected as anchor of the Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation enabled PDU session which is Unstructured PDU Session Type as
described in clause 4.3.2.2 and the SMF-NEF Connection is released for this
PDU Session.
NOTE 3: If there are multiple UPFs associated with the PDU Session (e.g. due
to the insertion of UL CL or Branching Point, or redundant I-UPFs if the
redundant I-UPFs are used for URLLC), the Session Release Request procedure
(steps 2a and 2b) is done for each UPF. In order to avoid charging of PDUs
that later get dropped, the SMF performs the N4 Session Release first with the
UPF(s) performing usage reporting, before releasing the other UPF(s) that
forward traffic for the same user plane resources.
3 If the PDU Session Release is initiated by the PCF and SMF and the SMF has
been notified by the AMF that UE is unreachable, e.g. due to the UE is in MICO
mode or periodical registration failure, the procedure continues in step 11 by
SMF notifying the AMF that the PDU Session is released by invoking the
Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify. The rest of step 3 and the steps 4-10
are skipped.
If the PDU Session Release procedure was triggered by steps 1a, 1b, 1d or 1e
above, the SMF creates an N1 SM including PDU Session Release Command message
(PDU Session ID, Cause). The Cause may indicate a trigger to establish a new
PDU Session with the same characteristics (e.g. when procedures related with
SSC mode 2 are invoked).
If the User Plane connection of the PDU Session is activated, the message sent
by the SMF to the AMF shall include N2 SM Resource Release request. If the
User Plane connection of the PDU Session is not activated, the message sent by
the SMF to the AMF shall not include N2 SM Resource Release request.
NOTE 4: SSC modes are defined in clause 5.6.9 of TS 23.501 [2].
3a. (If the PDU Session Release is initiated by the UE in step 1a or has been
triggered by (R)AN in step 1d) The SMF responds to the AMF with the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response (N2 SM Resource Release request, N1
SM container (PDU Session Release Command)). N2 SM Resource Release request is
included if the PDU Session Release is initiated by the UE and if the UP
connection of the PDU Session is active. Neither N2 SM Resource Release
request nor N1 SM container is included if the PDU Session Release is
triggered by (R)AN and the SMF decides to keep the PDU session with user plane
connection deactivated and the subsequent steps are skipped.
3b. If the PDU Session Release is initiated by the SMF or the PCF, the SMF
invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation (N1 SM
container (PDU Session Release Command), skip indicator).
If the UP connection of the PDU Session is active, the SMF shall also include
the N2 Resource Release request (PDU Session ID) in the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, to release the (R)AN resources
associated with the PDU Session.
The \"skip indicator\" tells the AMF whether it may skip sending the N1 SM
container to the UE (e.g. when the UE is in CM-IDLE state). SMF includes the
\"skip indicator\" in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer except when
the procedure is triggered to change PDU Session Anchor of a PDU Session with
SSC mode 2.
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and \"skip indicator\" is included in the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation, the AMF acknowledges
the step 3b by sending an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Response
message (\"N1 SM Message Not Transferred\") to SMF and steps 4 to 10 are
skipped.
3c. If the PDU Session Release is initiated by the AMF in step 1c, i.e. the
SMF received the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request from the AMF, the
SMF responds to the AMF with the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext response,
optionally including the Small Data Rate Control Status and APN Rate Control
Status.
If the UPF included APN Rate Control Status and/or Small Data Rate Control
Status in step 2 then the SMF includes APN Rate Control and/or Small Data Rate
Control Status and the AMF stores the Small Data Rate Control Status and/or
the APN Rate Control Status in the UE context in AMF.
The AMF and SMF shall remove all contexts (including the PDU Session ID)
associated with the PDU Session which are indicated as released at the UE. The
SMF shall remove any event subscriptions on the AMF by the SMF that becomes no
more needed due to the PDU Session Release. The steps 4 to 11 are skipped.
3d. If the PDU Session Release is initiated by the AMF in step 1f, i.e. the
SMF received the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request from the AMF with a
release indication to request the release of the PDU Session, the SMF responds
to the AMF with the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response which may contain
the N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command) to release the PDU session
at the UE.
If the UP connection of the PDU Session is active, the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response shall also include the N2 Resource
Release request (PDU Session ID) to release the (R)AN resources associated
with the PDU Session.
4\. If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and \"N1 SM delivery can be skipped\" is not
indicated, the AMF initiates the network triggered Service Request procedure
to transmit the NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container) to the UE and
the steps 6, 7 are skipped.
If the message received from the SMF in step 3 does not include N2 SM Resource
Release request, the AMF transmits the NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM
container) to the UE and the steps 6, 7 are skipped.
If the PDU Session is Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation enabled, the SMF
shall not include N2 SM Resource Release request in the message sent to the
AMF, the AMF transmits the NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container) to
the UE and the steps 6, 7 are skipped.
If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state and the received message from the SMF in
step 3 includes N2 SM Resource Release request, the AMF transfers the SM
information received from the SMF in step 4 (N2 SM Resource Release request,
N1 SM container) to the (R)AN.
If the message from the SMF includes Small Data Rate Control Status then the
AMF stores it in the UE Context in AMF.
5\. When the (R)AN has received an N2 SM request to release the AN resources
associated with the PDU Session it issues AN specific signalling exchange(s)
with the UE to release the corresponding AN resources.
In the case of a NG-RAN, the NAS message is sent to the UE in an RRC message
which may take place with the UE releasing the NG-RAN resources related to the
PDU Session. If NG-RAN resources do not need to be released (i.e. the User
Plane of the PDU Session is deactivated), the NAS message is sent to the UE in
an RRC message which does not release the NG-RAN resources related to the PDU
Session.
During this procedure, the (R)AN sends any NAS message (N1 SM container (PDU
Session Release Command)) received from the AMF in step 5.
6\. [Conditional] If the (R)AN had received a N2 SM request to release the AN
resources, the (R)AN acknowledges the N2 SM Resource Release Request by
sending an N2 SM Resource Release Ack (User Location Information, Secondary
RAT usage data) Message to the AMF.
If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the NG-RAN node may
provide RAN Usage Data Report.
7a. The AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (N2 SM Resource
Release Ack (Secondary RAT usage data), User Location Information) to the SMF.
7b. The SMF responds to the AMF with an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
response.
8\. The UE acknowledges the PDU Session Release Command by sending a NAS
message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Ack)) message
over the (R)AN.
9\. [Conditional] The (R)AN forwards the NAS message from the UE by sending a
N2 NAS uplink transport (NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU
Session Release Ack)), User Location Information) to the AMF.
10a. The AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (N1 SM container (PDU
Session Release Ack, User Location Information) to the SMF.
10b. The SMF responds to the AMF with an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
response.
Steps 8-10 may happen before steps 6-7.
11\. If steps 3a, 3b or 3d were performed, the SMF waits until it has received
replies to the N1 and N2 information provided in step 3, as needed.
The SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify to notify AMF that the
SM context for this PDU Session is released. If the UPF included Small Data
Rate Control Status and/or APN Rate Control Status in step 2 then the SMF
includes Small Data Rate Control Status and/or APN Rate Control Status in its
request to the AMF in this step. The AMF releases the association between the
SMF ID and the PDU Session ID, DNN, as well as S-NSSAI and stores the Small
Data Rate Control Status and/or the APN Rate Control Status in the UE context
in AMF. The SMF shall remove any event subscriptions on the AMF that becomes
no more needed due to the PDU Session Release.
NOTE 5: The UE and the 5GC will get synchronized about the status of the
(released) PDU Session at the next Service Request or Registration procedure.
12\. If Dynamic PCC applied to this session the SMF invokes an SM Policy
Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.6 to delete the
PDU Session.
13\. SMF notifies any entity that has subscribed to User Location Information
related with PDU Session change.
14\. If it is the last PDU Session the SMF is handling for the UE for the
associated (DNN, S-NSSAI), the SMF unsubscribes from Session Management
Subscription data changes notification with the UDM by means of the
Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI) service operation. The UDM may
unsubscribe the subscription notification from UDR by Nudr_DM_Unsubscribe
(SUPI, Subscription Data, Session Management Subscription data, DNN, S-NSSAI).
15\. The SMF invokes the Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation including
the DNN and the PDU Session Id. The UDM removes the association it had stored
between the SMF identity and the associated DNN and PDU Session Id. The UDM
may update this information by Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, Subscription Data, UE
context in SMF data).
#### 4.3.4.3 UE or network requested PDU Session Release for Home-routed
Roaming
This procedure is used in the case of home-routed roaming scenarios.
Figure 4.3.4.3-1: UE or network requested PDU Session Release for home-routed
roaming
1\. The procedure is triggered by one of the following events:
1a. (UE initiated release) As in step 1a of clause 4.3.4.2 with the addition
that:
\- the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop
forwarding uplink traffic; and
\- the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (SM Context ID,
information from the SM message from the UE e.g. PCO, \"Trigger PDU Session
Release\" indication, Timezone, User Location Information) service operation
to request the H-SMF to release the PDU Session. The H-SMF responds to the
request immediately.
1b. (Serving network initiated release) The serving network initiates the PDU
Session Release during UE or serving network initiated Deregistration
procedure as specified in clause 4.2.2.3. There is no NAS SM message between
the UE and the V-SMF in this case. This step is the same as step 1c in clause
4.3.4.2, with the addition that:
\- the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop
forwarding uplink traffic; and
\- the V-SMF initiates the release of the PDU Session at the H-SMF by invoking
the Nsmf_PDUSession_Release request.
The serving network also initiates the PDU Session Release where neither N1
nor N2 SM signalling is needed before releasing the SM context as in step 1c
in clause 4.3.4.2 if e.g. due to the set of network slices for a UE changes
where a network slice instance is no longer available (e.g. as described in
clause 5.15.5.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2], or the AAA Server triggered Network Slice-
Specific Re-authentication and Re-authorization procedure fails as specified
in clause 4.2.9.2 or the AAA Server triggered Slice-Specific Authorization
Revocation takes place as specified in clause 4.2.9.4).
1c. (HPLMN initiated release) This step is the same as step 1b in clause
4.3.4.2, with the addition that:
\- the H-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the H-UPF to stop
forwarding downlink traffic.
1d. This step is the same as step 1d in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition
that:
\- the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop
forwarding uplink traffic; and
\- the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request towards H-SMF.
1e. (HPLMN initiated release) This step is the same as step 1e in clause
4.3.4.2, with the addition that:
\- the H-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the H-UPF to stop
forwarding downlink traffic.
1f. This step is the same as step 1f in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition
that:
\- the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop
forwarding uplink traffic; and
\- the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request towards H-SMF.
If the SMF receives one of the triggers in step 1a, 1c or 1e, the H-SMF starts
PDU Session Release procedure.
When a SMF above initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the UPF to stop
forwarding traffic this means also to stop taking into account the traffic for
usage monitoring.
2a-2b. (UE-, (R)AN- or Serving network initiated) This step is performed in
case the PDU Session Release is triggered by a message from V-SMF. These steps
are the same as steps 2a-2b in clause 4.3.4.2. The SMF is the SMF in HPLMN.
NOTE 1: This step 2a-2b can correspond to steps 1a, 1b, 1d, 1f.
3a. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF prepares the SM Release PDU
Session Command message and initiates the PDU Session Release towards the UE
by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request service operation towards the
V-SMF. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request contains necessary information to
build the SM Release PDU Session Command by the V-SMF towards the UE (for
example a Release Cause or PCO).
3b. (Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF responds to the PDU release
request from the V-SMF with a Nsmf_PDUSession_Release response.
If the UPF included Small Data Rate Control Status in step 2 then the SMF
includes Small Data Rate Control Status in the request to the AMF.
If the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU Session,
the steps 4a and 4b are skipped.
4a-4b. The V-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This
includes the same procedure in step 2 but controlled from the SMF in VPLMN.
5-13. These steps are the same as steps 3-10 in clause 4.3.4.2.
14\. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The V-SMF responds to the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request invoked at step 3a and confirms the PDU Session
Release. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update response may carry information such as PCO
received from the UE in SM PDU Session Release Accept. as well as User
Location Information, Time Zone and Secondary RAT Usage Data.
15a. (UE or HPLMN or Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF releases the
SM policy control association with the PCF by invoking the SM Policy
Association Termination procedure defined in clause 4.16.6. For serving
network initiated PDU Session Release case, this step happens between step 1b
and step 3b.
15b-15c. (HPLMN initiated release) In case the PDU Session Release is HPLMN-
initiated (i.e. triggers in 1c, 1e), the H-SMF releases the corresponding User
Plane resources. This includes the same procedure as in step 2.
15d. As in step 15 of clause 4.3.4.2, the SMF invokes the
Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation.
NOTE 2: Step 15d does not necessarily take place after step 15c.
16\. (UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF shall remove all contexts
associated with the PDU Session:
16a. The H-SMF requests the V-SMF to release all contexts associated with the
PDU Session by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify (Release) operation.
16b. The V-SMF requests the AMF to release all contexts associated with the
PDU Session by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify (Release).
The AMF releases the association between the SMF ID and the PDU Session ID.
### 4.3.5 Session continuity, service continuity and UP path management
#### 4.3.5.1 Change of SSC mode 2 PDU Session Anchor with different PDU
Sessions
The following procedure is triggered by SMF in order to change the PDU Session
Anchor serving a PDU Session of SSC mode 2 for a UE when neither multi-homing
nor UL CL applies to the PDU Session. This procedure releases the existing PDU
Session associated with an old PDU Session Anchor (i.e. UPF1 in figure
4.3.5.1-1) and immediately establishes a new PDU Session with a new PDU
Session Anchor (i.e. UPF2 in figure 4.3.5.1-1) to the same DN.
Figure 4.3.5.1-1: Change of SSC mode 2 PSA for a PDU Session
1\. The SMF determines that the serving UPF needs to be changed due to events
that may benefit from such change.
2\. The PDU Session Release procedure is initiated as described in clause
4.3.4. The SMF sends an N1 SM Information to the UE via the AMF by invoking
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer as described in Step 3b of clause
4.3.4.2. The PDU Session Release Command message in N1 SM Information contains
the PDU Session ID and Cause indicating that a PDU Session re-establishment to
the same DN is required.
3\. Upon reception of PDU Session Release Command with Cause indicating that a
PDU Session re-establishment to the same DN is required as sent in step 2, the
UE generates a new PDU Session ID and initiates PDU Session Establishment
procedure as described in clause 4.3.2.2. Then, the AMF selects an SMF as
described in clause 6.4.2 of TS 23.501 [2] and the SMF can select a new UPF
(i.e. UPF2) for the re-established PDU Session of SSC mode 2.
#### 4.3.5.2 Change of SSC mode 3 PDU Session Anchor with multiple PDU
Sessions
The following procedure is triggered by SMF in order to change the PDU Session
Anchor serving a PDU Session of SSC mode 3 for a UE. This procedure releases
the existing PDU Session associated with an old PDU Session Anchor (i.e. UPF1
in figure 4.3.5.2-1) after having established a new PDU Session to the same DN
with a new PDU Session Anchor (i.e. UPF2 in figure 4.3.5.2-1), which is
controlled by the same SMF. The SMF may determine that a new SMF needs to be
reallocated.
Figure 4.3.5.2-1: Change of SSC mode 3 PDU Session Anchor with multiple PDU
Sessions
1\. The SMF determines that the serving UPF or the SMF needs to be changed. If
the \"Indication of application relocation possibility\" attributes in the PCC
rule indicates no DNAI change takes place once selected for this application,
the SMF determines that the SMF can not be changed.
2\. If the SMF had sent an early notification to the AF and the runtime
coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration as
specified in clause 4.3.6.3, according to the indication of \"AF
acknowledgment to be expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the
SMF waits for a notification response from the AF. If the SMF receives a
negative notification response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure.
The SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (PDU Session ID,
SMF Reallocation requested indication, N1 SM container (PDU Session
Modification Command (Cause, PCO (PDU Session Address Lifetime value)))) where
PDU Session ID indicates the existing PDU Session to be relocated and Cause
indicates that a PDU Session re-establishment to the same DN is required.
The SMF Reallocation requested indication indicates whether the SMF is
requested to be reallocated.
The PDU Session Address Lifetime value is delivered to the UE upper layers in
PCO and indicates how long the network is willing to maintain the PDU Session.
The SMF starts a PDU Session Release timer corresponding to the PDU Session
Address Lifetime value.
3a. The AMF forwards the NAS message to the UE. The UE can provide the release
timer value to the upper layers if received in the PDU Session Modification
Command.
3b. The UE acknowledges the PDU Session Modification Command.
3c. The AMF forwards the N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command
ACK) received from the (R)AN to the SMF1 via Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
service operation.
3d. The SMF1 replies with a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response.
4\. If the UE receives PDU Session Modification Command, the UE may decide to
initiate the PDU Session Establishment procedure described in clause 4.3.2.2,
to the same DN with the following differences:
In Step 1 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, according to the SSC mode, UE generates a new
PDU Session ID and initiates the PDU Session Establishment Request using the
new PDU Session ID. The new PDU Session ID is included as PDU Session ID in
the NAS request message and the Old PDU Session ID which indicates the
existing PDU Session to be released is also provided to AMF in the NAS request
message.
In Step 2 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, if SMF reallocation was requested in Step 2 of
this clause, the AMF selects a different SMF. Otherwise, the AMF sends the
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to the same SMF serving the Old PDU
Session ID.
In Step 3 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, the AMF include both PDU Session ID and Old PDU
Session ID in Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request. The SMF detects that
the PDU Session establishment request is related to the trigger in step 2
based on the presence of an Old PDU Session ID in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request. The SMF stores the new PDU Session ID
and selects a new PDU Session Anchor (i.e. UPF2) for the new PDU Session.
If the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local
configuration, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be
expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF sends a late
notification to the AF before Step 11 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 and waits for a
notification response from the AF. If the SMF received a negative notification
response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure. Otherwise the SMF
continue the following procedures to activate the UP path of the new PDU
Session.
5\. After the new PDU Session is established the UE starts using the IP
address/prefix associated with the new PDU Session for all new traffic and may
also proactively move existing traffic flow (where possible) from the old PDU
Session to the new PDU Session.
NOTE: The mechanisms used by the UE to proactively move existing traffic flows
from one IP address/prefix to another are outside the scope of 3GPP
specifications.
6\. The old PDU Session is released as described in clause 4.3.4 either by the
UE before the timer provided in step 3 expires (e.g. once the UE has
consolidated all traffic on new PDU Session or if the session is no more
needed) or by the SMF upon expiry of this timer.
#### 4.3.5.3 Change of SSC mode 3 PDU Session Anchor with IPv6 Multi-homed PDU
Session
Clause 4.3.5.3 describes a procedure for service continuity with SSC mode 3
that uses the multi-homed PDU Session described in clause 5.6.4.3 of TS 23.501
[2]. In this case the SMF prepares a new PDU Session Anchor first and then
notifies the UE of the existence of a new IP prefix, as depicted in figure
4.3.5.3-1. This procedure is applicable only to PDU Sessions of IPv6 type.
Figure 4.3.5.3-1: Change of PDU Session Anchor with IPv6 Multi homed PDU
Session
The UE has an established PDU Session with the PDU Session Anchor (i.e. UPF1
in Figure 4.3.5.3-1). The PDU Session\'s User Plane involves at least the
(R)AN and the PDU Session Anchor.
1\. At some point the SMF decides to allocate to the PDU Session the PDU
Session with a new PDU Session Anchor.
2\. The SMF selects a new UPF and using N4 configures the UPF as a new PDU
Session Anchor (i.e. UPF2 in Figure 4.3.5.3-1) of the multi-homed PDU Session.
In the process a new IPv6 prefix (IP\@2) is allocated for the PDU Session. If
the PCF has subscribed to the IP allocation/release event, the SMF performs a
Session Management Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5
to provide the new allocated IPv6 prefix to the PCF. The PCF invokes
Nbsf_Management_Update service operation to register the tuple (IPv6 prefix,
PCF id) for the PDU session identified by (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI) in the BSF.
If the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local
configuration, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be
expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF sends an early
notification to the AF after the new UPF (new PSA) is selected and waits for a
notification response from the AF. If the SMF receives a negative notification
response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure.
3\. The SMF selects a Branching Point (BP) UPF as described in Clause of 6.3.3
of TS 23.501 [2]. The selection of BP UPF may consider the location of UPF1
and UPF2 to ensure a suitable location of the BP UPF relative to the UPF1 and
the UPF2.
NOTE 1: If BP UPF is co-located with one of PDU Session Anchors, steps between
SMF and BP UPF can be skipped.
4\. The SMF configures via N4 the UPF selected in step 3 (BP UPF in Figure
4.3.5.3-1) as a Branching Point for the multi-homed PDU Session. It provides
the Branching Point with the necessary UL traffic forwarding rules (related
with the prefix of the IPv6 source address of UL traffic). Also, the SMF
provides AN Tunnel Info for N3 tunnel setup and CN Tunnel Info for N9 tunnel
setup to the BP UPF and obtains CN Tunnel Info from the BP UPF.
5-6. The SMF performs N4 Session Modification procedure with PSAs. During this
procedure, the SMF provides CN Tunnel Info received from the BP UPF to set up
an N9 tunnel between BP and PSAs.
7\. The SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service
operation containing N2 SM Information with CN Tunnel Info for the N3 tunnel
setup.
8\. The AMF sends an N2 Request including N2 SM Information received from the
SMF to the (R)AN. The (R)AN acknowledges to the AMF with an N2 Response.
9a. The AMF carries the N2 Response sent by the (R)AN to the SMF by invoking
the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation.
9b. The SMF responds to Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation from
the AMF.
10-11. If the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on
local configuration as specified in clause 4.3.6.3, according to the
indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" is included in AF
subscription to SMF events, the SMF sends a late notification to the AF and
waits for a notification response from the AF. If the SMF receives a negative
notification response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure.
The SMF notifies the UE of the availability of the new IP prefix. This is
performed using an IPv6 Router Advertisement message (RFC 4861 [6]). The SMF
sends a Router Advertisement to the UE via the new PSA with a new prefix
(IP\@2) and sends another Router Advertisement to the UE via the old PSA with
the old prefix (IP\@1) and zero value in the preferred lifetime field and a
value in the valid lifetime field according to RFC 4862 [8]. The UE shall
update the valid lifetime of the old prefix (IP\@1) to the signalled value
regardless of the remaining lifetime. The valid lifetime value indicates the
time how long the SMF is willing to keep the old prefix. The valid lifetime
value may be decided by SMF based on local configuration.
The UE starts using IP\@2 for all new traffic and may also proactively move
existing traffic flow (where possible) from IP\@1 to IP\@2.
NOTE 2: The mechanisms used by the UE to proactively move existing traffic
flows from one IP prefix to another are outside the scope of 3GPP
specifications.
12\. After the timer expires, the SMF releases the UE\'s old IPv6 prefix
(IP\@1). At this point the UE implicitly releases the old IP prefix. The SMF
sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the BP to release UP resource for
N9 tunnel between the BP and old PSA.
13\. The SMF releases the old PDU Session context with the old PDU Session
Anchor (UPF1 in Figure 4.3.5.3-1). If the PCF has subscribed to the IP
allocation/release event, the SMF performs a Session Management Policy
Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5 to notify the PCF of the
IPv6 prefix release. The PCF shall invoke Nbsf_Management_Update service
operation to remove the tuple (IPv6prefix, PCF id) for the PDU session
identified by (SUPI, DNN,S-NSSAI) in BSF.
14-18. The SMF may optionally release the Branching Point from the User Plane
path.
#### 4.3.5.4 Addition of additional PDU Session Anchor and Branching Point or
UL CL
Clause 4.3.5.4 describes a procedure to add a PDU Session Anchor and a
Branching Point or UL CL for an established PDU Session.
Figure 4.3.5.4-1: Addition of additional PDU Session Anchor and Branching
Point or UL CL
1\. UE has an established PDU Session with a UPF including the PDU Session
Anchor 1 (PSA1 in Figure 4.3.5.4-1). The PDU Session User Plane involves at
least the (R)AN and the PDU Session Anchor 1.
2\. At some point the SMF decides to establish a new PDU Session Anchor e.g.
due to UE mobility, new flow detection. The SMF selects a UPF and using N4
establish the new PDU Session Anchor 2 (PSA2 in Figure 4.3.5.4-1) of the PDU
Session. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing PDU Session, the SMF also ensures
that a new IPv6 prefix corresponding to PSA2 is allocated and if the PCF has
subscribed to the IP allocation/release event, the SMF performs the Session
Management Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5 to
provide the new allocated IPv6 prefix to the PCF.
If the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local
configuration, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be
expected\" is included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF sends an
early notification to the AF after new PSA (PSA2 in Figure 4.3.5.4-1) is
selected and waits for a notification response from the AF before configuring
the new PSA. If the SMF receives a negative notification response from the AF,
the SMF may stop the procedure.
3\. The SMF selects a UPF and using N4 establish the Branching Point (in the
case of IPv6 multi-homing) or a UL CL for the PDU Session. It provides the
necessary uplink forwarding rules towards PSA1 and PSA2 including the PSA1 CN
Tunnel Info and the PSA2 CN Tunnel Info. In addition, the AN Tunnel Info is
provided for downlink forwarding. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing, the SMF
also provides traffic filters for the IPv6 prefixes corresponding to PSA1 and
PSA2 indicating what traffic shall be forwarded towards PSA1 and PSA2
respectively.
In the case of UL CL, the SMF provides traffic filters indicating what traffic
shall be forwarded towards PSA1 and PSA2 respectively. If the runtime
coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration,
according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" is
included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF sends a late notification
to the AF and waits for a notification response from the AF before configuring
the UL CL. If the SMF receives a negative notification response from the AF,
the SMF may stop the procedure.
NOTE 1: If the Branching Point or UL CL and the PSA2 are co-located in a
single UPF then steps 2 and 3 can be merged. If a Branching Point is already
allocated, step 3 is skipped.
4\. The SMF updates the PSA1 via N4. It provides the Branching Point or UL CL
CN Tunnel Info for the downlink traffic.
NOTE 2: If the Branching Point or UL CL and the PSA1 are co-located in a
single UPF then steps 3 and 4 can be merged.
5\. The SMF updates PSA2 via N4. It provides the Branching Point or UL CL CN
Tunnel Info for down-link traffic.
NOTE 3: If the Branching Point or UL CL and the PSA2 are co-located in a
single UPF then step 5 is not needed.
6\. The SMF updates (R)AN via N2 SM information over N11. It provides the new
CN Tunnel Info corresponding to the UPF (Branching Point or UL CL). In the
case of UL CL, if there is an existing UPF between the (R)AN and new inserted
UL CL, the SMF updates the existing UPF via N4 instead of updating the (R)AN.
7\. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing, the SMF notifies the UE of the
availability of the new IP prefix @ PSA2. This is performed using an IPv6
Router Advertisement message (RFC 4861 [6]). Also, the SMF sends IPv6 multi-
homed routing rule along with the IPv6 prefix to the UE using an IPv6 Router
Advertisement message (RFC 4191 [21]) as described in clause 5.8.2.2.2 of TS
23.501 [2].
If the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local
configuration, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be
expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF sends a late
notification to the AF and waits for a notification response from the AF
before sending the new IP prefix to the UE. If the SMF receives a negative
notification response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure.
8\. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing, the SMF may re-configure the UE for the
original IP prefix @ PSA1,i.e. SMF sends IPv6 multi-homed routing rule along
with the IPv6 prefix to the UE using an IPv6 Router Advertisement message (RFC
4191 [21]) as described in clause 5.8.2.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
#### 4.3.5.5 Removal of additional PDU Session Anchor and Branching Point or
UL CL
Clause 4.3.5.5 describes a procedure to remove a PDU Session Anchor and
(optionally) remove Branching Point or UL CL for an established PDU Session.
Figure 4.3.5.5-1: Removal of additional PDU Session Anchor and Branching Point
or UL CL
1\. UE has an established PDU Session with a UPF including the Branching Point
or UL CL, the PDU Session Anchor 1 (PSA1 in Figure 4.3.5.5-1) and the PDU
Session Anchor 2 (PSA2 in Figure 4.3.5.5-1).
At some point the SMF decides to remove the PDU Session Anchor 1 e.g. due to
UE mobility, flow terminated.
2\. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing, the SMF notifies the UE to stop using
the IPv6 prefix corresponding to PSA1. This is performed by IPv6 Router
Advertisement message (RFC 4861 [6] and RFC 4862 [8]). Also, the SMF sends
IPv6 multi-homed routing rule along with the IPv6 prefix corresponding to PSA2
to the UE as described in clause 5.8.2.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. Based on the
information provided in the Router Advertisement, the UE starts using the IPv6
prefix (corresponding to PSA2) for all the traffic.
4\. If the Branching Point or UL CL is to be released, the SMF updates the
(R)AN with the PSA2 CN Tunnel Info. In the case of UL CL, if there is an
existing UPF between the (R)AN and the UL CL to be removed, the SMF updates
the existing UPF via N4 instead of updating the (R)AN.
5\. If the Branching Point or UL CL is to be released, the SMF updates via N4
the PSA2 providing the AN Tunnel Info. In the case of UL CL, if there is an
existing UPF between the (R)AN and the UL CL to be removed, the SMF updates
the PSA2 providing the UPF CN tunnel Info.
6\. The SMF releases via N4 the PSA1. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing, the
SMF also releases the corresponding IPv6 prefix and if the PCF has subscribed
to the IP allocation/release event, the SMF performs the Session Management
Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5 to notify the PCF of
the IPv6 prefix release.
7\. If steps 4 and 5 were executed, the SMF releases the Branching Point / UL
CL.
#### 4.3.5.6 Change of additional PDU Session Anchor for IPv6 multi-homing or
UL CL
The following procedure is triggered by an SMF when the SMF needs to modify
IPv6 multi-homing or UL CL rule (i.e. traffic filter in the Branching Point or
the UL CL) in order to move the some or whole traffic flows of the existing
additional PDU Session Anchor which was established by the IPv6 multi-homing
or the UL CL operations (i.e. PSA1 in figure 4.3.5.6-1) to a new additional
PDU Session Anchor (i.e. PSA2 in figure 4.3.5.6-1) which is established under
the same Branching Point or UL CL for a UE where the UE already has a PDU
Session Anchor which was established before the event of Branching Point or UL
CL insertion (i.e. PSA0 in figure 4.3.5.6-1). This procedure establishes a new
additional PDU Session Anchor (i.e. PSA2) and conditionally releases the
existing additional PDU Session Anchor (i.e. PSA1), while modifying IPv6
multi-homing or UL CL rule in the same Branching Point or UL CL under
controlled by the same SMF.
Figure 4.3.5.6-1: Change of additional PSA for a PDU Session in IPv6 multi-
homing or UL CL case
1\. The SMF decides to change one additional PSA of a PDU Session with IPv6
multi-homing or UL CL, due to events that may benefit from such change or upon
request from an Application Function.
2\. If the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local
configuration, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be
expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF sends an early
notification to the AF after PSA2 is selected and waits for a notification
response from the AF before configuring the PSA2. If the SMF receives a
negative notification response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure.
The SMF sends an N4 Session Establishment Request to PSA2 and provides the
tunnel ID of Branching Point or UL CL, Packet detection, enforcement and
reporting rules to be installed on the PSA2 for this PDU Session. If a tunnel
ID is allocated by the SMF, the tunnel ID is provided to PSA2 in this step.
The PSA2 acknowledges by sending an N4 Session Establishment Response. The
tunnel ID of PSA2 is provided to the SMF in this step.
In the case of IPv6 multi-homing PDU Session, a new IPv6 prefix corresponding
to PSA2 is allocated (by the SMF or by the UPF depending on the deployment)
and if the PCF has subscribed to the IP allocation/release event, the SMF
performs the Session Management Policy Modification Procedure as defined in
clause 4.16.5 to provide the new allocated IPv6 prefix to the PCF.
3a. In the case of PDU session with UL CL, if the runtime coordination between
5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration, according to the
indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" included in AF subscription
to SMF events, the SMF sends a late notification to the AF and waits for a
notification response from the AF. If the SMF receives a negative notification
response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure.
The SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the Branching Point or UL
CL to update the UL traffic filter according to new allocated IPv6 prefix
allocated to PSA 2 or the UL CL rules regarding to the traffic flows that the
SMF tries to move from PSA1 to PSA2. The N4 Session Modification Request
message contains the identifications of traffic filter that needs to be
updated and the tunnel ID of PSA2.
NOTE: The identification of a traffic filter can be either the index of the
traffic filter, or a single value of the information field in traffic filter
(e.g. the tunnel ID of next hop), or a combination value of some information
field in the traffic filter (e.g. the tunnel ID of next hop with source port
number).
3b. The Branching Point or the UL CL acknowledges by N4 Session Modification
Response the Branching Point or when the UL CL successfully updates all the
traffic filters that the SMF requests to modify.
4\. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing PDU Session, if the runtime coordination
between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration, according to the
indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" included in AF subscription
to SMF events, the SMF sends a late notification to the AF and waits for a
notification response from the AF. If the SMF receives a negative notification
response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure.
In the case of IPv6 multi-homing PDU Session, The SMF notifies the UE of the
availability of the new IP prefix @ PSA2. This is performed using an IPv6
Router Advertisement message (RFC 4861 [6]). Also, the SMF sends IPv6 multi-
homed routing rule along with the IPv6 prefix to the UE using an IPv6 Router
Advertisement message (RFC 4191 [21]) as described in clause 5.8.2.2.2 of TS
23.501 [2].
5\. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing PDU Session, The SMF may re-configure the
UE for the original IP prefix @ PSA0,i.e. SMF sends IPv6 multi-homed routing
rule along with the IPv6 prefix to the UE using an IPv6 Router Advertisement
message (RFC 4191 [21]) as described in clause 5.8.2.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
6\. Step 6 occurs only if the Branching Point or UL CL does not have any
traffic filter on the PDU Session which forwards a traffic flow to PSA1.
6a. The SMF sends an N4 Session Release Request with N4 session ID to PSA1.
The PSA1 shall release all tunnel resources and contexts associated with the
N4 session.
6b. PSA1 sends an N4 Session Release Response with N4 session ID to the SMF at
the same moment that PSA1 successfully releases all tunnel resources and
contexts associated with the N4 session.
#### 4.3.5.7 Simultaneous change of Branching Point or UL CL and additional
PSA for a PDU Session
Simultaneous change of UL CL or Branching Point and additional PSA can be
performed after Xn based handover, N2 based handover and Service Request
procedures.
The following procedure is triggered by SMF in order to change the Branching
Point or the UL CL and additional PSA serving a PDU Session for a UE.
Figure 4.3.5.7-1: Simultaneous change of Branching Point or UL CL and
additional PSA for a PDU Session
UE has an established PDU Session with a UPF including the PDU Session Anchor
(Remote UPF). The PDU Session user plane involves at least the Source (R)AN,
Source Branching Point or Source UL CL, local Source UPF (PSA2) and the Remote
UPF (PDU Session Anchor, PSA1), where Source Branching Point or Source UL CL
and PSA2 can be co-located.
1\. At some point SMF decides to change the Branching Point or the UL CL due
to UE mobility.
2\. The SMF selects a local Target UPF (PSA3) and using N4 establishes the
local Target UPF for the PDU Session. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing PDU
Session, the SMF also allocates a new IPv6 prefix corresponding to PSA3 and if
the PCF has subscribed to the IP allocation/release event, the SMF performs
the Session Management Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause
4.16.5 to provide the new allocated IPv6 prefix to the PCF.
The SMF may send an earlier notification to the AF after PSA3 is selected. If
the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local
configuration as specified in clause 4.3.6.3, according to the indication of
\"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF
events, the SMF waits for a notification response from the AF before
configuring the PSA3. If the SMF receives a negative notification response
from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure.
3\. The SMF selects a UPF and using N4 establishes the Target Branching Point
or Target UL CL for the PDU Session. SMF provides the necessary uplink
forwarding rules towards the PSA3 and PSA1 including the Tunnel Info for each
UPF. If session continuity upon UL CL relocation is used, the SMF also uses N4
to establish an N9 forwarding tunnel between the Source UL CL and Target UL
CL, including the Tunnel Info for each UPF. In addition, the AN Tunnel Info to
target (R)AN is provided for downlink forwarding. In the case of UL CL, the
SMF provides traffic filters indicating what traffic shall be forwarded
towards PSA3, PSA1 and Source UL CL, respectively. In the case of IPv6 multi-
homing, the SMF also provides traffic filters for the IPv6 prefixes
corresponding to PSA3 and PSA1 indicating what traffic shall be forwarded
towards PSA3 and PSA1 respectively. Target Branching Point or Target UL CL
provides the CN Tunnel Info for downlink traffic.
NOTE 1: If the Target Branching Point or Target UL CL and the PSA3 are co-
located in a single UPF then steps 2 and 3 can be merged.
NOTE 2: When session continuity upon UL CL relocation is used, the downlink
traffic at this point goes through Source UL CL, Target UL CL and Target
(R)AN.
4\. The SMF updates the PSA1 via N4. It provides the PDU Session CN Tunnel
Info for the downlink traffic.
5\. The SMF updates the PSA3. It provides the CN Tunnel Info for downlink
traffic.
NOTE 3: If the Target Branching Point or the Target UL CL and the PSA3 are co-
located in a single UPF then step 5 is not needed.
6\. In the case of PDU session with UL CL, if the runtime coordination between
5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration, according to the
indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" included in AF subscription
to SMF events, the SMF sends a late notification to the AF and waits for a
notification response from the AF. If the SMF receives a negative notification
response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure and remove the Target
Branching Point or Target UL CL and PSA3.
The SMF updates (R)AN via N2 SM information over N11. It provides the new CN
Tunnel Info corresponding to the Target Branching Point or the Target UL CL.
If there is an existing UPF between the Target (R)AN and Target Branching
Point or Target UL CL, the SMF updates the existing UPF via N4 instead of
updating the (R)AN.
NOTE 4: When session continuity upon UL CL relocation is used, the uplink
traffic destined to PSA2 at this point goes through Target (R)AN, Target UL CL
and Source UL CL.
7\. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing PDU Session, if the runtime coordination
between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration, according to the
indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" included in AF subscription
to SMF events, the SMF sends a late notification to the AF and waits for a
notification response from the AF. If the SMF receives a negative notification
response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure.
In the case of IPv6 multi-homing, the SMF notifies the UE of the availability
of the new IP prefix @ PSA3. This is performed using an IPv6 Router
Advertisement message (RFC 4861 [6]). Also, the SMF sends IPv6 multi-homed
routing rule along with the IPv6 prefix to the UE using an IPv6 Router
Advertisement message (RFC 4191 [21]) as described in clause 5.8.2.2.2 of TS
23.501 [2].
8\. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing, the SMF may re-configure the UE for the
original IP prefix @ PSA1, i.e. SMF sends IPv6 multi-homed routing rule along
with the IPv6 prefix to the UE using an IPv6 Router Advertisement message (RFC
4191 [21]) as described in clause 5.8.2.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
9\. The SMF sends a Late Notification to the AF indicating a change of DNAI as
described in clause 4.3.6.3. In cases where target local DN is associated with
another AF instance, SMF also sends notification to target AF as described in
4.3.6.3 and cancels any future notification message to source AF as it is no
longer involved.
NOTE 5: The message can include routing information to the application located
in the target local DN. Alternatively the routing information to the
application located in the target local DN can be determined by the AF based
on the new DNAI, in which case the AF can invoke the AF triggered influence on
traffic routing procedure targeting single UE as described in clause 4.3.6.4,
which assists the SMF in generation of the routing rule on the Target UL CL
towards PSA3 (i.e. towards the application located in the target local DN). It
is up to network configuration whether the routing information to the
application located in the target local DN is configured in the SMF or in the
AF.
NOTE 6: When session continuity upon UL CL relocation is used the AF can also
trigger mechanisms that are out of the scope of this specification (e.g. IP-
level or HTTP-level redirection) by which the traffic is redirected towards
the application in the target local DN. Based on this redirection the UE
starts using a new destination IP address which leads the Target UL CL to
force the traffic towards PSA3.
10\. When session continuity upon UL CL relocation is used, detection of no
active traffic over the N9 forwarding tunnel is performed during a time
interval provisioned by the SMF for User Plane inactivity report in order to
release the N9 forwarding tunnel. The detection can be done by Source UL CL,
which notifies the SMF of no active traffic over the N9 forwarding tunnel.
NOTE 7: It is up to network configuration whether the detection of no active
traffic is performed by the Source UL CL or the Target UL CL. As an
alternative to the detection of no active traffic, the AF can send an explicit
notification to the SMF when traffic to/from this UE ceases to exist, leading
the SMF to release the Source UL CL and the Source UPF (PSA2).
11\. The SMF releases via N4 the PSA2.
12\. The SMF releases the Source Branching Point or the Source UL CL.
NOTE 8: If the Target Branching Point or Target UL CL and the PSA2 are co-
located in a single UPF then steps 11 and 12 can be merged.
#### 4.3.5.8 Ethernet PDU Session Anchor Relocation
This procedure allows for Ethernet PDU Sessions to change the PDU Session
Anchor (PSA) while the session remains set up. Originally the Ethernet PDU
Session goes via the Source UPF acting as the PSA. The Ethernet context which
contains all Ethernet specific information including the MAC address of the UE
and possibly its VLAN tag(s) is reported from the Source PSA UPF to the SMF.
It is possible to report multiple MAC addresses (with their VLAN tag(s)) if
these are reachable via the UE.
The SMF determines whether and when a serving PDU Session anchor for an
Ethernet PDU Session needs to be changed and selects the Target PSA UPF,
establishes the N4 session at the Target PSA UPF. The information within the
Ethernet context is sent to the Target UPF. Based on the information in the
Ethernet context, the Target PSA UPF may take action to update the Ethernet
forwarding in the data network.
Figure 4.3.5.8-1: Ethernet PDU Session Anchor Relocation
Initially, the Ethernet PDU Session is established with the user data going
via the Source UPF. The Source UPF acts as the PSA.
1\. The Source UPF reports the Ethernet context which contains all Ethernet
specific information including the MAC address of the UE and possibly its VLAN
tag(s) that the UPF has learned from the UE side to the SMF. In the case of
any changes in the Ethernet context, the change is updated to the SMF so that
the SMF maintains an up-to-date state of the Ethernet context. This signalling
is realized based on N4 reporting.
2\. The UPF\'s report is acknowledged.
3-5. In the case of handover, the RAN handover preparation and execution is
followed by path switch signalling to the AMF and corresponding signalling to
SMF, as defined in clause 4.9.1.2.
6\. The SMF decides that the PSA is to be changed for the Ethernet PDU Session
and selects the Target UPF that will act as the new PSA. The decision may be
triggered by a mobility event, such as receiving the message in step 5.
7\. The Target UPF N4 session is established. The SMF provides the N3 tunnel
endpoint used by RAN.
8\. The establishment of the new N4 session is acknowledged from the Target
UPF to the SMF. The UPF provides its N3 tunnel endpoint.
9-10. In the case of handover, the SMF signals to the RAN via the AMF to
provide the Path Switch Request Ack, which includes the update of the uplink
N3 tunnel endpoint to the target UPF. This signalling is defined in clause
4.9.1.2. In steps 9-10, an indication is sent from the SMF via the AMF to the
RAN node indicating that the RAN node should not expect to receive an end
marker packet. The RAN node may skip trying to reorder the downlink packets.
11-12. If there is no handover and the UE is in connected mode, the SMF sends
PDU Session Modify Request message to the RAN via the AMF, which includes the
update of the uplink N3 tunnel endpoint to the target UPF. The RAN
acknowledges the message. The RAN node does not need to to reorder the
downlink packets.
NOTE 1: Due to the change in the end to end path, packet re-ordering can occur
both for the handover and no handover cases. If necessary, upper layer
protocols can ensure in sequence delivery.
After steps 9-10 or 11-12, uplink Ethernet frames pass via the target UPF.
Downlink Ethernet frames may continue to be delivered from the source UPF to
the RAN node. In the case of handover, the Ethernet frames are forwarded from
the source RAN node to the target RAN node.
13-14. The SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the Target UPF
which includes the information in Ethernet context (i.e. MAC address and VLAN
tag(s)) and a trigger for updating the Ethernet forwarding (next step). The
Target UPF acknowledges by an N4 Session Modification Response.
15\. The Target UPF may assist in the update of Ethernet forwarding tables of
Ethernet switches in the DN via a variety of mechanisms, the use of which are
specific to the DN and the specification of which are out-of-scope for 3GPP.
NOTE 2: The UPF acting as a switch in the DN, can for example issue a
Gratuitous ARP (GARP) containing the MAC address(es) of the UE that has
switched to the new anchor, or the UPF can send an unsolicited Neighbor
Discovery Protocol (NDP) Neighbor Advertisement message indicating the UE MAC
addresses, or the UPF can generate a uplink Ethernet frame with the UE\'s MAC
addresses as source MAC addresses (and possibly its VLAN tag(s)) and
configurable payload which will be dropped by endhosts, or the UPF can send
another message or Ethernet frame compatible with DN protocols.
In the case of a central controller in the Ethernet network which sets the
forwarding tables, the central controller can be instructed that the given MAC
address is reachable at the new location.
When multiple MAC addresses are present in the Ethernet context, the update of
the Ethernet forwarding is performed for each MAC address.
16\. The N4 session is released at the Source UPF. The source UPF may wait for
a configurable period before it stops delivering downlink Ethernet frames for
the given PDU Session.
17\. The N4 session release is acknowledged from the Source UPF to the SMF.
### 4.3.6 Application Function influence on traffic routing
#### 4.3.6.1 General
Clause 4.3.6 describes the procedures between an Application Function and the
SMF to maintain an efficient user plane path for Application Functions that
require it.
As described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2], an Application Function may
send requests to influence SMF routeing decisions for User Plane traffic of
PDU Sessions. The AF requests may influence UPF (re)selection and allow
routeing of user traffic to a local access (identified by a DNAI) to a Data
Network. The AF may also provide in its request subscriptions to SMF events.
The following cases can be distinguished:
\- AF requests targeting an individual UE by a UE address; these requests are
routed (by the AF or by the NEF) to an individual PCF using the BSF. This is
described in clause 4.3.6.4.
NOTE 1: Such requests target an on-going PDU Session. Whether the AF needs to
use the NEF or not is according to local deployment.
\- AF requests described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2] targeting a group of
UE(s), or any UE accessing a combination of DNN and S-NSSAI, or targeting
individual UE by a GPSI as described in table 5.6.7-1. These AF requests may
also affect UE(s) with an established PDU session. For such requests the AF
shall contact the NEF and the NEF stores the AF request information in the
UDR. PCF(s) receive a corresponding notification if they had subscribed to the
creation / modification/ deletion of the AF request information corresponding
to UDR Data Keys / Data Sub-Keys. This is defined in clause 6.3.7.2 of TS
23.501 [2] and further described in clause 4.3.6.2.
NOTE 2: Such requests can target on-going or future PDU Sessions.
If the AF interacts with PCF via the NEF, the NEF performs the following
mappings where needed:
\- Map the AF-Service-Identifier into DNN and S-NSSAI combination, determined
by local configuration.
\- Map the AF-Service-Identifier into a list of DNAI(s) and Routing Profile
ID(s) determined by local configuration.
The NEF can only provide this mapping when the DNAI(s) being used by the
applications are statically defined. When the DNAI(s) where applications are
instantiated may vary dynamically, the AF should provide the target DNAI(s) in
its request together with either Routing Profile ID(s) or with N6 traffic
routing information.
\- Map the GPSI in Target UE Identifier into SUPI, according to information
received from UDM.
\- Map the External Group Identifier in Target UE Identifier into Internal
Group Identifier, according to information received from UDM.
\- Map the geographic zone identifier(s) in Spatial Validity Condition into
areas of validity, determined by local configuration.
#### 4.3.6.2 Processing AF requests to influence traffic routing for Sessions
not identified by an UE address
Figure 4.3.6.2-1: Processing AF requests to influence traffic routing for
Sessions not identified by an an UE address
NOTE 1: The 5GC functions used in this scenario are assumed to all belong to
the same PLMN (HPLMN in non-roaming case or VPLMN in the case of a PDU Session
in LBO mode).
NOTE 2: Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create or Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update or
Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Delete service operations invoked from an AF located in
the HPLMN for local breakout and home routed roaming scenarios are not
supported.
1\. To create a new request, the AF invokes an Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create
service operation. The content of this service operation (AF request) is
defined in clause 5.2.6.7. The request contains also an AF Transaction Id. If
it subscribes to events related with PDU Sessions the AF indicates also where
it desires to receive the corresponding notifications (AF notification
reporting information).
To update or remove an existing request, the AF invokes an
Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update or Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Delete service operation
providing the corresponding AF Transaction Id.
2\. The AF sends its request to the NEF. If the request is sent directly fom
the AF to the PCF, the AF reaches the PCF selected for the existing PDU
Session by configuration or by invoking Nbsf_management_Discovery service.
The NEF ensures the necessary authorization control, including throttling of
AF requests and, as described in clause 4.3.6.1, mapping from the information
provided by the AF into information needed by the 5GC.
3\. (in the case of Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create or Update): The NEF stores
the AF request information in the UDR (Data Set = Application Data; Data
Subset = AF traffic influence request information, Data Key = AF Transaction
Internal ID, S-NSSAI and DNN and/or Internal Group Identifier or SUPI).
NOTE 3: Both the AF Transaction Internal ID and, S-NSSAI and DNN and/or
Internal Group Identifier or SUPI are regarded as Data Key when the AF request
information are stored into the UDR, see Table 5.2.12.2.1-1.
(in the case of Nnef_TrafficInfluence_delete): The NEF deletes the AF
requirements in the UDR (Data Set = Application Data; Data Subset = AF traffic
influence request information, Data Key = AF Transaction Internal ID).
The NEF responds to the AF.
4\. The PCF(s) that have subscribed to modifications of AF requests (Data Set
= Application Data; Data Subset = AF traffic influence request information,
Data Key = S-NSSAI and DNN and/or Internal Group Identifier or SUPI)
receive(s) a Nudr_DM_Notify notification of data change from the UDR.
5\. The PCF determines if existing PDU Sessions are potentially impacted by
the AF request. For each of these PDU Sessions, the PCF updates the SMF with
corresponding new PCC rule(s) by invoking Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify
service operation as described in steps 5 and 6 in clause 4.16.5.
If the AF request includes a notification reporting request for UP path
change, the PCF includes in the PCC rule(s) the information required for
reporting the event, including the Notification Target Address pointing to the
NEF or AF and the Notification Correlation ID containing the AF Transaction
Internal ID.
6\. When a PCC rule is received from the PCF, the SMF may take appropriate
actions to reconfigure the User plane of the PDU Session such as:
\- Adding, replacing or removing a UPF in the data path to e.g. act as an UL
CL or a Branching Point e.g. as described in clause 4.3.5.
\- Allocate a new Prefix to the UE (when IPv6 multi-Homing applies)
\- Updating the UPF in the target DNAI with new traffic steering rules
Subscribe to notifications from the AMF for an Area Of Interest via
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation
#### 4.3.6.3 Notification of User Plane Management Events
The SMF may send a notification to the AF if the AF had subscribed to user
plane management event notifications as described in clause 4.3.6.2 and in
clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. The following are the examples of such events:
\- A PDU Session Anchor identified in the AF subscription request has been
established or released.
\- A DNAI has changed.
\- The SMF has received a request for AF notification and the on-going PDU
Session meets the conditions to notify the AF.
\- Ethernet PDU Session Anchor Relocation as defined in clause 4.3.5.8.
The SMF uses notification reporting information received from PCF to issue the
notification either via an NEF (2a, 2b and 4a, 4b) or directly to the AF (2c
and 4c).
The following flow depicts the sequence of events:
Figure 4.3.6.3-1: Notification of user plane management event
1\. A condition for an AF notification has been met as described above. The
SMF sends notification to the NF that is subscribed for SMF notifications.
Further processing of the SMF notification depends on the receiving NF, as
shown in steps 2a and 2c.
2a. If early notification via NEF is requested by the AF, the SMF notifies the
NEF of the target DNAI of the PDU Session by invoking
Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation.
2b. When the NEF receives Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify, the NEF performs
information mapping (e.g. AF Transaction Internal ID provided in Notification
Correlation ID to AF Transaction ID, SUPI to GPSI, etc.) as applicable
according to clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2] and triggers the appropriate
Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Notify message. In this case, step 2c is not applicable.
2c. If early direct notification is requested by the AF, the SMF notifies the
AF of the target DNAI of the PDU Session by invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify
service operation.
2d. The AF replies to Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Notify by invoking
Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo service operation either immediately
or after any required application relocation in the target DNAI is completed.
AF includes N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI. AF
may reply in negative e.g. if the AF determines that the application
relocation cannot be completed successfully and/or on time.
2d-a. If information sent via Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create is to be changed
e.g. N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI, the AF
invokes Nnef_TrafficInfluence_update service operation in order for PCF to be
able to include this information in PCC rules sent to SMF.
If the AF includes information such as N6 traffic routing details
corresponding to the target DNAI in Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo it
shall include the same information in Nnef_TrafficInfluence_update.
2e. When the NEF receives Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo, the NEF
triggers the appropriate Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo message.
2e-a. When the NEF receives Nnef_TrafficInfluence_update, the NEF triggers
step 3a as in figure 4.3.6.2-1 or step 2 of figure 4.3.6.4-1 if targeting an
individual UE by a UE address.
2f. The AF replies to Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify by invoking
Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo service operation either immediately or
after any required application relocation in the target DNAI is completed. AF
includes N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI. AF may
reply in negative e.g. if the AF determines that the application relocation
cannot be completed successfully on time.
2f-a. If information sent via Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create is to be changed
e.g. N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI, the AF
invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation in order for PCF to
be able to include this information in PCC rules sent to SMF.
If the AF includes information such as N6 traffic routing details
corresponding to the target DNAI in Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo it
shall include the same information in Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update.
3\. The SMF enforces the change of DNAI or addition, change, or removal of a
UPF.
If the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local
configuration, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be
expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF may wait for a
response from the AF to the early notification before this step. The SMF does
not perform this step until it receives a positive response from the AF, as
described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].
4a. If late notification via NEF is requested by the AF, the SMF notifies the
NEF of the target DNAI of the PDU Session by invoking
Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation.
If the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local
configuration, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be
expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF may send late
notification and wait for a positive response from the AF before activating
the new UP path, as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].
4b. When the NEF receives Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify, the NEF performs
information mapping (e.g. AF Transaction Internal ID provided in Notification
Correlation ID to AF Transaction ID, SUPI to GPSI, etc.) as applicable
according to clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2] and triggers the appropriate
message. In this case, step 4c is not applicable.
4c. If late direct notification is requested by the AF, the SMF notifies the
AF of the target DNAI of the PDU Session by invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify
service operation.
4d. When the AF receives either the Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Notify message or
the Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify message, the AF checks whether it can serve the
target DNAI. If the AF instance change is needed, the AF determines the proper
target AF for the target DNAI and performs the AF migration.
NOTE 1: The determination of the target AF for the target DNAI and the AF
migration to the target AF are out of the scope of this release.
4e. The AF replies to Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Notify by invoking
Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo service operation either immediately
or after any required application relocation in the target DNAI is completed.
AF includes N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI. AF
may reply in negative e.g. if the AF determines that the application
relocation cannot be completed successfully on time.
4e-a. If information sent via Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create/Update is to be
changed e.g. N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI, the
AF invokes Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create or Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update
service operation in order for PCF to be able to include this information in
PCC rules sent to SMF. The Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create shall be used if the
AF is notified (e.g. in step 4b) that the UE IP address is changed and the
initial Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create was targeted to an individual UE address,
otherwise the Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update may be used.
If the AF includes information such as N6 traffic routing details
corresponding to the target DNAI in Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo it
shall include the same information in Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create or
Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update, whichever is appropriate.
4f. When the NEF receives Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo, the NEF
triggers the appropriate Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo message.
4f-a. When the NEF receives Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create/update, the NEF
triggers step 3a as in figure 4.3.6.2-1 or step 2 of figure 4.3.6.4-1 if
targeting an individual UE by a UE address.
4g. The AF replies to Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify by invoking
Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo service operation either immediately or
after any required application relocation in the target DNAI is completed. AF
includes N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI. AF may
reply in negative e.g. if the AF determines that the application relocation
cannot be completed successfully on time.
4g-a. If information sent via Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create/Update is to be
changed e.g. N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI, the
AF invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create or Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update
service operation in order for PCF to be able to include this information in
PCC rules sent to SMF. The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create shall be used if
the AF is notified (e.g. in step 4c) that the UE IP address is changed,
otherwise the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update may be used.
If the AF includes information such as N6 traffic routing details
corresponding to the target DNAI in Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo it
shall include the same information in Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create or
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update, whichever is appropriate.
#### 4.3.6.4 Transferring an AF request targeting an individual UE address to
the relevant PCF
Figure 4.3.6.4-1: Handling an AF request targeting an individual UE address to
the relevant PCF
Depending on the AF deployment (see clause 6.2.10 of TS 23.501 [2]), the AF
may send the AF request to PCF directly, in which case step 1 is skipped, or
via the NEF.
1\. [Conditional] If the AF sends the AF request via NEF, the AF sends
Nnef_TrafficInfluenceCreate/Update/Delete Request targeting an individual UE
address to the NEF. This request corresponds to an AF request to influence
traffic routing that targets an individual UE address.
When NEF receives an AF request from AF, the NEF ensures the necessary
authorization control and, as described in clause 4.3.6.1, mapping from the
information provided by the AF into information needed by the 5GC. The NEF
responds to the AF.
2\. [Conditional] AF/NEF consumes Nbsf_Management_Discovery service operation
(providing at least the UE address) to find out the address of the relevant
PCF if the PCF address is not available on the NEF based on local
configuration, otherwise step 1 is skipped.
NOTE: The AF/NEF finds the BSF based on local configuration or using the NRF.
3\. BSF provides the PCF address in the Nbsf_Management_Discovery response to
AF/NEF.
4\. If step 1 was performed, NEF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service
to the PCF to transfer the AF request. If an AF sends the AF request directly
to the PCF, AF invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service and the PCF responds
to the AF.
5\. The PCF updates the SMF with corresponding new PCC rule(s) with PCF
initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as described in clause
4.16.5.2. When a PCC rule is received from the PCF, the SMF may take
appropriate actions, when applicable, to reconfigure the User plane of the PDU
Session, such as:
\- Adding, replacing or removing UPF(s) in the data path, e.g. to act as UL
CL, Branching Point and/or PDU Session Anchor e.g. as described in clause
4.3.5.
\- Allocate a new Prefix to the UE (when IPv6 multi-Homing applies).
\- Updating the UPF regarding the target DNAI with new traffic steering rules.
\- Subscribe to notifications from the AMF for an Area Of Interest via
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.
### 4.3.7 CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an existing
PDU Session
The following procedure is used to deactivate UP connection (i.e. data radio
bearer and N3 tunnel) for an established PDU Session of a UE in CM-CONNECTED
state.
For an always-on PDU Session, the SMF should not configure the UPF to report
inactivity.
Figure 4.3.7-1: CN-initiated deactivation of UP connection for an established
PDU Session
1\. The SMF determines that the UP connection of the PDU Session can be
deactivated in following cases:
\- During handover procedure, if all the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are
rejected by the target NG-RAN (as described in clause 4.9.1), or if a PDU
Session is failed to setup indicated by the AMF (see step 7 of clause
4.9.1.3.3). SMF proceeds with step 2 and step 3, the steps 5 to 9 are skipped;
\- The UPF detects that the PDU Session has no data transfer for a specified
Inactivity period as described in clause 4.4.2.2;
\- For a LADN PDU Session, the AMF notifies to the SMF that the UE moved out
of the LADN service area; or
\- The AMF notifies to the SMF that the UE moved out of the Allowed Area.
The SMF may decide to release the UPF of N3 terminating point. In that case
the SMF proceeds with step 2 and step 3. Otherwise, if the SMF decides to keep
the UPF of N3 terminating points, the SMF proceeds with step 4.
2\. The SMF may initiate an N4 Session Release procedure to release the
intermediate UPF of N3 terminating point. If there are multiple intermediate
UPFs, this step can be performed for each UPFs to be released. The SMF needs
to initiate N4 Session Modification procedure to the UPF (i.e. N9 terminating
point or PDU Session Anchor) connecting to the released UPF in step 3.
3\. If the intermediate UPF(s) of N3 terminating point is released in step 2,
the SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure towards the UPF (PDU
Session Anchor or another intermediate UPF) connecting to the released UPF,
indicating the need to remove CN Tunnel Info for N9 tunnel of the
corresponding PDU Session. In this case, the UPF connecting to the released
UPF buffers the DL packets for this PDU Session or drops the DL packets for
this PDU session or forwards the DL packets for this PDU session to the SMF,
based on buffering instruction provided by the SMF as described in clause
5.8.3.2 or clause 5.8.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the PDU Session corresponds to
a LADN and the UE moved out of the LADN service area, the SMF may notify the
UPF connecting to the released UPF to discard downlink data for the PDU
Sessions and/or to not provide further Data Notification messages.
Otherwise, N4 Session Modification procedure occurs toward N3 terminating
point.
4\. If the UPF of N3 terminating point is not released in step 2, the SMF
initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure indicating the need to remove
AN Tunnel Info for N3 tunnel of the corresponding PDU Session. In this case,
the UPF buffers the DL packets for this PDU Session or drops the DL packets
for this PDU session or forwards the DL packets for this PDU session to the
SMF, based on buffering instruction provided by the SMF as described in clause
5.8.3.2 or clause 5.8.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the PDU Session corresponds to
a LADN and the UE moved out of the LADN service area, the SMF may notify the
UPF to discard downlink data for the PDU Sessions and/or to not provide
further Data Notification messages.
5\. The SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service
operation (PDU Session ID, N2 SM Information (N2 Resource Release Request (PDU
Session ID))) to release the NG-RAN resources associated with the PDU Session.
6\. The AMF sends the N2 PDU Session Resource Release Command including N2 SM
information (N2 Resource Release Request (PDU Session ID)) received from the
SMF via N2 to the NG-RAN.
7\. The NG-RAN may issue NG-RAN specific signalling exchange (e.g. RRC
Connection Reconfiguration) with the UE to release the NG-RAN resources
related to the PDU Session received from the AMF in step 5. When a User Plane
connection for a PDU Session is released, the AS layer in the UE indicates it
to the NAS layer.
If the UE is in RRC Inactive state, this step is skipped. When the UE becomes
RRC Connected state from RRC Inactive state, the NG-RAN and UE synchronize the
released radio resources for the deactivated PDU Session as described in TS
36.331 [16] and TS 38.331 [12].
8\. The NG-RAN acknowledges the N2 PDU Session Resource Release Command to the
AMF including N2 SM Resource Release Ack (User Location Information, Secondary
RAT Usage Data).
9\. The AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation (N2
SM Information(Secondary RAT Usage Data)) to acknowledge the Namf service
received in step 5.
## 4.4 SMF and UPF interactions
### 4.4.1 N4 session management procedures
#### 4.4.1.1 General
N4 session management procedures are used to control the functionality of the
UPF. The SMF can create, update and remove the N4 session context in the UPF,
which is described in clause 5.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
The following N4 session management procedures exist: N4 Session Establishment
procedure, N4 session Modification procedure and N4 session release procedure.
All of them are initiated by the SMF.
#### 4.4.1.2 N4 Session Establishment procedure
The N4 Session Establishment procedure is used to create the initial N4
session context for a PDU Session at the UPF. The SMF assigns a new N4 Session
ID and provides it to the UPF. The N4 Session ID is stored by both entities
and used to identify the N4 session context during their interaction. The SMF
also stores the relation between the N4 Session ID and PDU Session for a UE.
Figure 4.4.1.2-1 N4 Session Establishment procedure
1\. SMF receives the trigger to establish a new PDU Session or change the UPF
for an established PDU Session.
2\. The SMF sends an N4 session establishment request message to the UPF that
contains the structured control information which defines how the UPF needs to
behave.
3\. The UPF responds with an N4 session establishment response message
containing any information that the UPF has to provide to the SMF in response
to the control information received.
4\. The SMF interacts with the network function which triggered this procedure
(e.g. AMF or PCF).
#### 4.4.1.3 N4 Session Modification procedure
The N4 Session Modification procedure is used to update the N4 session context
of an existing PDU Session at the UPF, which is executed between SMF and UPF
whenever PDU Session related parameters have to be modified.
Figure 4.4.1.3-1 N4 Session Modification procedure
1\. SMF receives the trigger to modify the existing PDU Session.
2\. The SMF sends an N4 session modification request message to the UPF that
contains the update for the structured control information which defines how
the UPF needs to behave.
3\. The UPF identifies the N4 session context to be modified by the N4 Session
ID. Then, the UPF updates the parameters of this N4 session context according
to the list of parameters sent by the SMF. The UPF responds with an N4 session
modification response message containing any information that the UPF has to
provide to the SMF in response to the control information received.
4\. The SMF interacts with the network entity which triggered this procedure
(e.g. AMF or PCF).
#### 4.4.1.4 N4 Session Release procedure
The N4 session release procedure is used to remove the N4 session context of
an existing PDU Session at the UPF.
Figure 4.4.1.4-1 N4 Session Release procedure
1\. SMF receives the trigger to remove the N4 session context for the PDU
Session.
2\. The SMF sends an N4 session release request message to the UPF.
3\. The UPF identifies the N4 session context to be removed by the N4 Session
ID and removes the whole session context. The UPF responds with an N4 session
release response message containing any information that the UPF has to
provide to the SMF.
4\. The SMF interacts with the network entity which triggered this procedure
(e.g. AMF or PCF).
### 4.4.2 N4 Reporting Procedures
#### 4.4.2.1 General
The N4 reporting procedure is used by the UPF to report events to the SMF.
#### 4.4.2.2 N4 Session Level Reporting Procedure
This procedure is used by the UPF to report events related to an N4 session
for an individual PDU Session. The triggers for event reporting were
configured on the UPF during N4 Session Establishment/Modification procedures
by the SMF.
Figure 4.4.2.2-1: N4 Session Level Reporting procedure
1\. The UPF detects that an event has to be reported. The reporting triggers
include the following cases:
(1) Measurement information reporting (Usage Report).
Measurement information shall be collected in the UPF and reported to the SMF
as defined in clause 5.8 and clause 5.12 of TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE 1: The Usage Report is also used for the reporting of other events or
information. For details refer to clause 7.5.8.3 of TS 29.244 [69].
(2) Start of traffic detection (Usage Report).
When traffic detection is requested by SMF and the start of traffic is
detected for a Packet Detection Rule (PDR) as described in clause 5.8 of TS
23.501 [2], the UPF shall report the start of traffic detection to the SMF and
indicate the corresponding PDR rule ID.
(3) Stop of traffic detection (Usage Report).
When traffic detection is requested by SMF and the end of traffic is detected
for a PDR as described in clause 5.8 of TS 23.501 [2], the UPF shall report
the stop of traffic detection to the SMF and indicate the corresponding PDR
rule ID.
(4) Detection of 1st downlink packet for a QoS Flow of a PDU Session with UP
Connection deactivated (Downlink Data Report).
When UPF receives the first downlink packet for a QoS Flow but no N3/N9 tunnel
for downlink data transmission exists and the buffering is performed by the
UPF, it shall report the detection of 1st downlink packet to SMF also
indicating the QoS Flow for which the downlink packet was received (for the
purpose of downlink data notification). The UPF shall also report the DSCP of
the packet if the PDU Session type is IP (to support the Paging Policy
Differentiation feature described in clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2]).
(5) Detection of PDU Session Inactivity for a specified period (User Plane
Inactivity Report).
When an Inactivity Timer for a PDU Session is provided by SMF during N4
Session Establishment/Modification procedure and the UPF detects the PDU
Session has no data transfer for a period specified by the Inactivity Timer,
it shall report PDU Session Inactivity to the SMF.
NOTE 2: As described in clause 4.3.7, an Inactivity Timer to the UPF is not
provided by the SMF for always-on PDU Sessions.
(6) The UL, DL or round trip packet delay measurement reporting (Session
Report).
When the QoS Monitoring for URLLC is enabled for the QoS Flow, the UPF
calculates the UL, DL or round trip packet delay of the QoS Flow. If the
redundant transmission on N3/N9 interfaces is activated, the UPF performs
packet delay monitoring for both UP paths and reports the packet delay of the
two UP paths respectively. When the reporting trigger(s) is satisfied, e.g.
the measured packet delay value exceeds the reporting threshold, or the
reporting period expires, or the PDU Session is released, the UPF reports the
calculated packet delay value(s) to the SMF. When receiving the measurement
reports from the UPF, the SMF sends the reports to the target, i.e. either to
the PCF or to the AF (may be via NEF), according to the information for QoS
Monitoring for URLLC received in the PCC rules. If the PCF received the
report, the PCF sends the reports to the AF, based on the procedure as defined
in the clause 4.16.5.1.
(7) TSC Management Information available (TSC Management Information).
When TSC management information is available, the UPF shall provide the TSC
management information in the TSC Management Information to the SMF as defined
in clause 5.8.2.11.14 of TS 23.501 [2].
(8) Discard Downlink Traffic detection (Downlink Data Report).
When discarded downlink traffic detection is requested by SMF for a PDR and
the first downlink packet is discarded after being buffered for this PDR as
described in clause 5.8.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2], the UPF shall report the
discarded downlink traffic detection to the SMF and indicate the corresponding
PDR rule ID (for the purpose of downlink data delivery status notification).
(9) Buffered Downlink Traffic detection (Downlink Data Report).
When buffered downlink traffic detection is requested by SMF for a PDR and the
first downlink packet is buffered for this PDR as described in clause 5.8.3.2
of TS 23.501 [2], the UPF shall report the buffered downlink traffic detection
to the SMF and indicate the corresponding PDR rule ID (for the purpose of
downlink data delivery status notification).
2\. The UPF sends an N4 session report message (N4 Session ID, list of [Usage
Report, Downlink Data Report, Session Report, User Plane Inactivity Report,
TSC Management Information]) to the SMF.
3\. The SMF identifies the N4 session context based on the received N4 Session
ID and applies the reported information for the corresponding PDU Session. The
SMF responds with an N4 session report ACK message.
### 4.4.3 N4 Node Level Procedures
#### 4.4.3.1 N4 Association Setup Procedure
The N4 Association Setup procedure is used to setup an N4 association between
the SMF and the UPF, to enable the SMF to use the resources of the UPF
subsequently to establish N4 Sessions. The SMF and UPF may exchange the
supported functionalities on each side during these procedures.
The setup of an N4 association is initiated by the SMF. SMF and UPF may
additionally support an N4 association initiated by UPF.
The SMF should only establish an N4 association with a UPF that supports
F-TEID allocation at the UPF.
The SMF initiates the N4 Association Setup procedure to request to setup an N4
association towards a UPF prior to establishing a first N4 session on this
UPF.
When receiving an N4 Association Setup Request, the UPF shall send an N4
Association Setup Response.
N4 Association Setup procedure can be used to request the UPF to measure and
report the clock drift between the TSN time and 5GS time for one or more TSN
time domains by provisioning TSN Clock Drift Report and providing the
corresponding Time domain number(s) as specified in TS 29.244 [69]. The SMF
may omit the Time domain number in the request; in this case the UPF shall
report the clock drift for all Time domains the UPF is connected to.
Figure 4.4.3.1-1: N4 association setup procedure initiated by SMF
The UPF may initiate the N4 Association Setup procedure to request to setup an
N4 association towards a SMF prior to establishing a first N4 session on this
UPF.
When receiving an N4 Association Setup Request, the SMF shall send an N4
Association Setup Response.
Figure 4.4.3.1-2: N4 association setup procedure initiated by UPF
#### 4.4.3.2 N4 Association Update Procedure
The N4 Association Update procedure shall be used to modify an existing N4
association between the SMF and the UPF. It may be initiated by the UPF or by
the SMF to update the supported features or available resources of the UP
function.
N4 Association Update procedure can be used by the SMF to update the
provisioning of TSN Clock Drift Report as specified in clause 4.4.3.1.
Figure 4.4.3.2-1: SMF initiated N4 association update procedure
Figure 4.4.3.2-2: UPF initiated N4 association update procedure
#### 4.4.3.3 N4 Association Release Procedure
The N4 Association Release procedure shall be used to terminate the N4
association between the SMF and the UPF due to e.g. OAM reasons. The N4
Association Release Request may be initiated by the SMF or UPF.
Figure 4.4.3.3-1: SMF initiated N4 association release procedure
Figure 4.4.3.3-2: UPF initiated N4 association release procedure
#### 4.4.3.4 N4 Report Procedure
The N4 Report procedure shall be used by the UPF to report information to the
SMF which is not related to a specific N4 session, e.g. to report a user plane
path failure affecting all the N4 sessions towards a remote GTP-U peer.
N4 Report procedure can be used by the UPF to report the clock drift between
the TSN time and 5GS time for one or more TSN working domains as specified in
TS 29.244 [69].
Figure 4.4.3.4-1: N4 report procedure
The UPF detects that an event has to be reported and starts the procedure by
sending an N4 Report message (UPF ID, list of [event, status]) to the SMF. The
SMF responds with an N4 report ACK message (SMF ID). The event parameter
contains the name of the event and UPF ID. The status parameter contains the
actual information the control plane function is interested in. If the UPF
detects clock drifting between 5G time and one or more TSN working domains,
the UPF reports the corresponding TSN domain number and the time offset and
cumulative rate Ratio according to the provisioning from the SMF as defined in
clause 5.27.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The UPF includes the Network Instance (if
available) and the combination of DNN and S-NSSAI (if available) in the
report.
NOTE: When the UPF supports more than one NW-TT, the SMF can use the Network
Instance or DNN/S-NSSAI to associate the report with the corresponding N4
sessions and NW-TT.
#### 4.4.3.5 N4 PFD management Procedure
This N4 procedure is used by the SMF to provision or remove all PFD(s)
belonging to an Application Identifier in the UPF. PFD sets belonging to
different Application Identifiers can be managed with the same PFD management
request message.
The N4 PFD management procedure is a node level procedure, i.e. independent of
any PDU Session.
Figure 4.4.3.5-1: PFD management in the UPF
1\. The SMF is triggered to provision or remove the PFD set belonging to an
Application Identifier in the following cases:
When the caching timer expires and there\'s no active PCC rule that refers to
the corresponding application identifier, the SMF informs the UPF to remove
the PFD(s) identified by the Application Identifier.
When a PCC rule is provided for an Application Identifier corresponding to the
PFD(s) that are not already provided to the UPF, the SMF shall provide the
PFD(s) to the UPF (if there are no PFD(s) cached, the SMF retrieves them from
the NEF (PFDF), as described in TS 23.503 [20]).
When any update of the PFD(s) is received from NEF (PFDF) and there are still
active PCC rules in UPF for the Application Identifier.
2\. The SMF sends a PFD management request to the UPF to provision/remove the
PFD(s) corresponding to the Application Identifier(s).
3\. The UPF updates the PFD(s) according to the request and acknowledges by
responding with a PFD management response message.
### 4.4.4 SMF Pause of Charging procedure
The SMF Pause of Charging procedure aims for the SMF charging and usage
monitoring data to more accurately reflect the downlink traffic actually sent
to the AN.
The following are example triggers for the SMF to enable the pause of charging
\- Operator specified criteria/threshold (e.g. number/fraction of
packets/bytes dropped at UPF in downlink since last time the N3 tunnel towards
the AN was released). The SMF requests the UPF to notify the SMF whenever the
criteria/threshold is met.
\- Indication of \"Radio Link Failure\" (see clause 4.2.6).
Based on operator policies, if the trigger for the SMF to enable the pause of
charging is met, the SMF shall pause the charging. When the SMF pauses
charging the following applies:
\- Towards the UPF(s) where the Usage Reporting is configured, the SMF shall
modify the Usage Reporting Rules for the PDU Session so that the usage
collection for charging is stopped.
\- The SMF may request the UPF to limit the rate of downlink traffic sent to
the downstream UPF or the AN.
NOTE 1: A consequence of using this procedure is that SMF charging data does
not correspond to the volume that traversed the UPF and it is therefore not
possible to count the downlink packets dropped between the PDU Session Anchor
(PSA) UPF and the downstream UPF.
NOTE 2: In this release of the specification, pause of charging procedure does
not address the issue of packets dropped by the NG-RAN.
In home routed roaming scenarios, based on operator\'s policy, the H-SMF may
indicate to the V-SMF if the feature is to be enabled on a per PDU Session
basis. This is indicated to the V-SMF by a \"PDU Session Charging Pause
Enabled\" Indication in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response during the PDU
Session Establishment procedure. This is an indication to the V-SMF that when
the criteria for pause of SMF charging are met at the VPLMN (as described
further down in this clause) charging at the H-SMF can be paused.
The H-SMF shall stop any charging and usage monitoring actions for the PDU
Session upon receiving a \"Start Pause of Charging\" Indication in a
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update request from the V-SMF. When the H-SMF receives a
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update request for a PDU Session with a \"Stop Pause of
Charging\" Indication, then the H-SMF shall resume charging for the PDU
Session.
Regardless of operator policy/configuration, the downlink user plane packets
received at the (V-)UPF shall trigger Data Notifications as described in
clause 4.2.3.3.
When the (V-)SMF receives a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request or a
Namf_EventExposure_Notify about UE reachability, the (V-)SMF shall consider
the PDU Session charging as being unpaused if it had been paused previously.
Figure 4.4.4-1: SMF Pause of charging procedure
1\. The UPF receives downlink data packets for a PDU Session that does not
have an N3 tunnel and the UPF sends data notification to the SMF. The packets
are buffered or discarded in the UPF based on operator policy.
2\. Based on operator policy/configuration the SMF triggers the procedure to
pause PDU Session charging. Triggering criteria are based on SMF operator
policy/configuration.
3\. SMF sends a N4 Session Modification Request message to the UPF where the
Usage Reporting is configured, modifying the Usage Reporting Rules for the PDU
Session so that the usage collection for charging is stopped. In home routed
roaming scenarios, the V-SMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update request to the
H-SMF with a \"Start Pause of Charging\" Indication. The H-SMF then requests
the H-UPF to stop usage collection as mentioned before.
4\. UPF confirms with a N4 Session Modification Response message.
## 4.5 User Profile management procedures
### 4.5.1 Subscriber Data Update Notification to AMF
Whenever the user profile is changed for a user in the UDM/UDR and the changes
affect the user profile in the AMF, the UDM shall notify these changes to the
affected AMF by the means of invoking Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation.
Then the AMF adds or modifies the user profile.
The Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation specified in clause 5.2.3.3 is
used by the UDM to update subscriber data stored in the AMF.
The AMF takes appropriate action according to the changed subscriber data as
follows, e.g.:
\- initiating an AMF initiated Deregistration procedure if the updated
subscription data indicates the UE is not allowed to roam in this network; and
\- updating UE context stored at AN to modify the subscribed UE-AMBR.
\- initiating UE Configuration Update procedure as defined in clause 4.2.4.2.
\- initiating UE Parameters Update via UDM Control Plane Procedure as defined
in clause 4.20.
UDM can also use the Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation to update the
Steering of Roaming information stored in the UE via the AMF (i.e. a list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or HPLMN indication that \'no
change of the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list stored in the UE is needed). UDM can include an indication for the UE to
send an acknowledgement of the reception of this information. The AMF provides
the acknowledgement sent from the UE to UDM using the Nudm_SDM_Info service
operation. For more details regarding the handling of Steering of Roaming
information refer to TS 23.122 [22].
When the subscribed S-NSSAIs change, UDM provides a Network Slicing
Subscription Change Indication to the UE via the AMF. Once the AMF updates the
UE and obtains an acknowledgment from the UE, the AMF informs the UDM that the
UE received the Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication using the
Nudm_SDM_Info service operation.
When the CAG information in the subscription data changes, or when the SUPI
and PEI association changes, UDM provides a CAG information Subscription
Change Indication to the AMF. Once the AMF updates the UE and obtains an
acknowledgment from the UE, the AMF informs the UDM that the UE received the
CAG information using the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation.
If the AMF received a changed Service Gap Time parameter in the updated
subscription data and if the UE has indicated Service Gap Control capability
the AMF shall provide the new Service Gap Time value to the UE in the next
Registration Accept message, or, if the UE does not send any Registration
Request within a certain time period that shall be longer than any MICO mode
or eDRX interval used by the UE, the AMF may initiate a UE Configuration
Update procedure.
### 4.5.2 Session Management Subscriber Data Update Notification to SMF
Whenever the session management subscriber data is changed for a user in the
UDM/UDR and if the SMF subscribed for the update of the session management
subscriber data to be notified, the UDM shall notify these changes to the
affected SMF by the means of invoking Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation.
Then the SMF modifies the session management subscriber data in the UE SM
context.
The Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation specified in clause 5.2.3.3 is
used by the UDM to update session management subscriber data stored in the
SMF.
The SMF initiates appropriate action according to the changed subscriber data,
e.g. including:
\- initiating an SMF initiated PDU Session Modification procedure; or
\- initiating an SMF initiated PDU Session Release procedure.
### 4.5.3 Purge of subscriber data in AMF
An AMF may, as an implementation option, purge the subscriber data and MM
context of a UE after the implicit or explicit Deregistration of the UE. In
this case, the AMF shall unsubscribe and deregister from the UDM, where UDM
may further do corresponding operation from UDR, by the means of following
\"Purge of subscriber data in AMF\" procedure.
Figure 4.5.3-1: Purge of Subscriber Data in AMF
1\. After purging the subscriber data and MM context of a deregistered UE, the
AMF unsubscribes to changes to subscription data using Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe
request operation (see clause 5.2.3.3.4), for the data the AMF has previously
subscribed (see clause 4.2.2.2.2, step 14b). The UDM unsubscribes the AMF from
the data indicated.
The UDM may unsubscribe to changes to subscription data from UDR by using
Nudr_DM_Unsubscribe for the data the UDM has previously subscribed (see clause
4.2.2.2.2, step 14b).
2\. The UDM sends a response back using Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe response
operation.
3\. The AMF deregisters from UDM using Nudm_UECM_Deregistration request (SUPI,
NF ID, Access Type) operation (see clause 5.2.3.2.3). The UDM may update UE
context in UDR by Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, Subscription Data).
4\. The UDM sets the UE Purged flag associated with the Access Type and
acknowledges with a Nudm_UECM_Deregistration response operation.
## 4.6 Security procedures
Security procedures for the 5GS are specified in 33.501 [15].
## 4.7 ME Identity check procedure
The AMF initiates Mobile Equipment Identity Check procedure by invoking the
N5g-eir_MEIdentityCheck_Get service operation as defined in clause 5.2.4.2.2.
## 4.8 RAN-CN interactions
### 4.8.1 Connection Inactive and Suspend procedure
#### 4.8.1.1 Connection Inactive procedure
This procedure may be initiated by the serving NG-RAN node when the UE is in
CM-CONNECTED with RRC Connected state and has received the \"RRC Inactive
Assistance Information\" from the AMF as defined in clause 5.3.3.2.5 of TS
23.501 [2]. NG-RAN initiates the transition to RRC Inactive state as defined
in TS 38.300 [9].
#### 4.8.1.2 Connection Suspend procedure
This procedure may be initiated by the serving NG-RAN node when the UE is in
CM-CONNECTED and has at least one PDU session with active user plane
connection and NG-eNB has received indication from the AMF that User Plane
CIoT 5GS Optimisation, as defined in clause 5.31.18 of TS 23.501 [2], is
supported for the UE.
Figure 4.8.1.2-1: NG-RAN initiated Connection Suspend procedure
1\. NG-RAN to AMF: The NG-RAN sends the N2 Suspend Request message to the AMF,
see TS 38.413 [10]. The AMF enters CM-IDLE with Suspend indicator. Context
information related to the NGAP UE association, UE Context and PDU session
context, necessary to resume the connection is stored in the UE, NG-RAN node
and in the AMF. The NG-RAN may include the Suspend cause and the N2 SM
information.
If the UE is served by an NG-eNB that supports WUS, then the NG-eNB should
include the Information On Recommended Cells And RAN nodes For Paging in the
N2 Suspend Request message; otherwise NG-RAN may include the Information On
Recommended Cells And NG-RAN For Paging in the N2 Suspend Request message. If
available, the AMF shall store this information to be used when paging the UE.
The NG-RAN includes Information for Enhanced Coverage, if available, in the N2
Suspend Request message.
If Service Gap Control is being applied to the UE (see clause 4.3.17.9) and
the Service Gap timer is not already running, the Service Gap timer shall be
started in the AMF when entering CM-IDLE, unless the connection was initiated
after a paging of an MT event, or after a mobility registration procedure
without Follow-on Request indication or after a mobility registration
procedure for regulatory prioritized services like Emergency services or
exception reporting.
2\. AMF to SMF: For each of the PDU Sessions in the N2 Suspend Request, the
AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (PDU Session ID, Cause,
Operation type, User Location Information, Age of Location Information, N2 SM
Information (Secondary RAT usage data)). The Operation Type is set to \"UP
Suspend\" to indicate suspend of user plane resources for the PDU Session.
3\. SMF to UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (AN Tunnel Info to be
suspended, Buffering on/off).
The SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure indicating the need to
release the tunnel info of AN terminating N3 between AN and UPF. Buffering
on/off indicates whether the UPF shall buffer incoming DL PDU or not.
The UPF sends N4 Session Modification Response to acknowledge the SMF request.
The SMF shall maintain the N3 tunnel info (including both AN Tunnel Info and
the CN Tunnel Info).
NOTE: The UPF maintains the CN tunnel info as it may receive uplink packets
from the AN.
4\. SMF to AMF: The SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response to the
AMF.
5\. AMF to NG-RAN: After response for each PDU session in step 4, the AMF
sends N2 Suspend Response to NG-RAN to successfully terminate the Connection
Suspend procedure initiated by the NG-RAN, see TS 38.413 [10].
6\. The NG-RAN sends RRC message to suspend the RRC Connection towards the UE
including UE Resume ID, see TS 36.300 [46]).
If Service Gap Control is applied for the UE (see clause 5.31.16 of TS 23.501
[2]) and the Service Gap timer is not already running, the Service Gap timer
shall be started in the UE when entering CM-IDLE, unless the connection was
initiated as a response to paging of an MT event, or after a mobility
registration procedure without Follow-on Request Indication set or after a
mobility registration procedure for regulatory prioritized services like
Emergency services or exception reporting.
### 4.8.2 Connection Resume procedure
#### 4.8.2.1 General
The Connection Resume procedure is used by a UE to request the establishment
of a secure connection between a UE and the network when the UE is in CM-
CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, or in CM-IDLE with Suspend indicator for
the UE supporting User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation. The UE initiates the
procedure when upper layers or the AS (when responding to RAN paging or upon
triggering RNA updates) requests the resumption of a suspended RRC connection.
NG-RAN details are specified in TS 38.300 [9] and TS 38.331 [12] for NR and in
TS 36.300 [46] and TS 36.331 [16] for E-UTRA.
#### 4.8.2.2 Connection Resume in RRC Inactive procedure
The Connection Resume procedure is used by the UE to perform RRC Inactive to
RRC Connected state transition. Triggers for the UE to initiate this procedure
are defined in clause 5.3.3.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2].
Figure 4.8.2.2-1: Connection Resume in RRC Inactive
1\. UE to NG-RAN: RRC message (Resume ID).
The UE initiates the transition from RRC Inactive state to RRC Connected
state, see TS 38.300 [9]. The UE provides its Resume ID needed by the NG-RAN
to access the UE\'s stored Context.
2\. [Conditional] NG-RAN performs UE Context Retrieval.
UE Context Retrieval is performed when the UE Context associated with the UE
attempting to resume its connection is not locally available at the accessed
NG-RAN. The UE Context Retrieval procedure via NG-RAN is specified in TS
38.300 [9].
3\. [Conditional] N2 Path switch procedure.
If the accessed NG-RAN is able to retrieve the UE Context, the accessed NG-RAN
node initiates N2 Path Switch procedure, i.e. steps 1 to 8 of clause 4.9.1.2.2
and including Xn data forwarding.
If the Connection Resume procedure is a response to RAN paging which is
triggered by 5GC due to an N2 interface procedure, NG-RAN and 5GC handle the
N2 interface procedure as a collision described in clause 4.9.1.2.
The NG-RAN sends UE Notification message to report that UE is in RRC Connected
if an AMF requested N2 Notification (see clause 4.8.3) to NG-RAN.
4\. NG-RAN to UE: RRC message.
The NG-RAN confirms to the UE that the UE has entered RRC Connected state.
NOTE: Steps 3 and 4 can be executed in parallel.
#### 4.8.2.3 Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with Suspend procedure
For the UE supporting User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the Connection Resume
procedure is used by the UE to perform RRC_IDLE with Suspend to RRC_CONNECTED
state transition. Triggers for the UE to initiate this procedure are defined
in clause 5.31.18 of TS 23.501 [2].
Figure 4.8.2.3-1: Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with Suspend
1\. UE to NG-RAN: RRC message (Resume ID).
The UE initiates the transition from CM-IDLE and RRC IDLE state with Suspend
to CM-CONNECTED and RRC Connected state, see TS 36.300 [46]. The UE provides
its Resume ID needed by the NG-RAN to access the UE\'s stored Context.
2\. [Conditional] NG-RAN performs UE Context Retrieval.
UE Context Retrieval may be performed when the UE Context associated with the
UE attempting to resume its connection is not locally available at the
accessed NG-RAN. The UE Context Retrieval procedure via NG-RAN is specified in
TS 38.300 [9].
3\. NG-RAN and UE continues the resume procedure and access stratum
configuration synchronization is performed between the UE and the network. UE
enters CM-CONNECTED and RRC_CONNECTED.
4\. NG-RAN to AMF:
a) If the NG-RAN is the same as the NG-RAN when UE is suspended, the NG-RAN
sends N2 Resume Request to AMF including Resume cause and N2 SM information
which indicates the PDU sessions successfully resumed and PDU sessions failed
or partially failed to resume the user plane resource.
b) If the NG-RAN is different from the NG-RAN when UE is suspended and the new
NG-RAN is able to retrieve the UE Context from the old NG-RAN, the new NG-RAN
node initiates N2 Path Switch Request towards AMF, i.e. Steps 1b of clause
4.9.1.2.2.
5\. AMF to SMF: For each of the PDU Sessions indicated in step 4, the AMF
invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (PDU Session ID, Cause,
Operation type, User Location Information, Age of Location Information, N2 SM
Information). The Operation Type is set to \"UP Resume\" to indicate resume of
user plane resources for the PDU Session.
For PDU Session(s) to be switched to the new NG-RAN, upon receipt of the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request, the SMF determines whether the
existing UPF can continue to serve the UE. If the existing UPF cannot continue
to serve the UE, steps 3 to 7 of clause 4.9.1.2.3 or clause 4.9.1.2.4 are
performed depending on whether the existing UPF is a PDU Session Anchor and
flow continues in step 7. Otherwise, step 6 is performed if the existing UPF
can continue to serve the PDU Session.
If the RRC connection is resumed and the UE is accessing via the NB-IoT RAT
with the RRC resume cause set to \"MO exception data\" the AMF updates all
(H-)SMFs. If AMF indicates \"MO exception data\" then it includes the MO
Exception Data Counter. The AMF maintains the MO Exception Data Counter for
Small Data Rate Control purposes as described in clause 5.31.14.3 of TS 23.501
[2]. Each (H-)SMF should be updated for every RRC Connection which is
triggered for \"MO exception data\".
In the home-routed roaming case, if Small Data Rate Control applies, the V-SMF
waits for H-SMF response before proceeding with the N3 establishment.
6\. SMF to UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (AN Tunnel Info to be resumed,
Buffering on/off).
The SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure indicating the resume
of AN tunnel. Buffering on/off indicates whether the UPF shall buffer incoming
DL PDU or not.
If step 4a) is performed, the AN tunnel info is the one maintained by the SMF
during Connection Suspend procedure, step 3 of clause 4.8.1.2. If step 4b) is
performed, the AN tunnel info is part of the N2 SM information received by SMF
in step 5.
The UPF sends N4 Session Modification Response to acknowledge the SMF request.
7\. SMF to AMF: The SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response to the
AMF.
If new CN tunnel information is allocated for the PDU session, i.e. in the
case of new AN tunnel is received in step 6, the SMF includes the new CN
tunnel information as part of the N2 SM information.
If the resume for PDU session is unsuccessful, the SMF shall include the
resume failure as part of the N2 SM information.
8\. AMF to NG-RAN: After response for each PDU session in step 7, the AMF
sends N2 Resume Response to NG-RAN and indicates success, including N2 SM
information for PDU session received in step 7, if at least one PDU session is
resumed successfully. If none of the PDU sessions is resumed successfully, AMF
indicates failure to NG-RAN.
The AMF sends N2 Path Switch Acknowledge with PDU session resume information,
if Path Switch Request is received in step 4.
The AMF may provide Extended Connected Time value to the NG-RAN. If the NG-RAN
receives the Extended Connected Time value, the NG-RAN may take this
information into account when determining user inactivity.
9\. [Conditional] NG-RAN to UE: RRC message.
The NG-RAN may reconfigure the RRC connection based on resume result received
from AMF.
10\. If the AMF has paged the UE to trigger the Connection Resume procedure,
the AMF shall initiate the UE configuration update procedure as defined in
clause 4.2.4.2 to assign a new 5G-GUTI.
#### 4.8.2.4 Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with Suspend and MO EDT procedure
The Connection Resume with Early Data Transmission procedure is used by the UE
to optimise sending user data in a single uplink packet and single uplink
followed by single downlink packet cases for a UE in CM-IDLE with Suspend.
Figure 4.8.2.4-1: Connection Resume in RRC Idle with Suspend with EDT
1\. UE to NG-eNB: RRC message (Resume ID, AS RAI) with UL EDT.
The UE initiates the transition from RRC IDLE with Suspend state to RRC
Connected state, see TS 36.300 [46].
The UE may include AS Release Assistance information indicating:
\- No further Uplink and Downlink Data transmission, or
\- Only a single Downlink Data transmission subsequent to the Uplink
transmission.
2\. The NG-eNB deciphers the EDT UL data received from the UE and forwards it
to the UPF using the N3 UL TEID in the AS context.
3\. The NG-eNB sends N2 Resume Request to AMF including Resume cause and N2
SM.
If the UE included AS Release Assistance information indicating No further
Uplink and Downlink Data transmission in step 1, NG-eNB may request for
immediate transition to RRC IDLE with Suspend.
If the NG-eNB requests for immediate transition to RRC IDLE with Suspend, the
NG-eNB should include Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE in the N2
Resume Request message. If the NG-eNB supports WUS and requests for immediate
transition to RRC IDLE with Suspend, the NG-eNB should include Information on
Recommended Cells and RAN Nodes for Paging in the N2 Resume Request message.
The AMF stores this information in the UE context for subsequent Paging
procedure.
4\. [Conditional] The AMF interacts with SMF to establish the N3 tunnel,
except for the case:
\- The AMF receives a request for immediate transition to RRC IDLE with
Suspend in step 3; and
\- the AMF is not aware of any downlink data or signalling pending.
5\. The AMF sends an N2 Resume Response to NG-eNB.
If the AMF received a request for immediate transition to RRC IDLE with
Suspend in step 3 and there is no downlink data or signalling pending, the AMF
includes a Suspend indication, keeps the UE in CM-IDLE with Suspend and
restarts the Periodic Registration Timer unless the Strictly Periodic
Registration Timer Indication has been provided to the UE during the previous
registration procedure.
Otherwise the AMF sends an N2 Resume Response to NG-eNB after the N3
Connectivity has been established and moves the UE to CM-CONNECTED. If the AMF
knows of mobile terminating data or signalling pending, the AMF may include
the Extended Connected Time value to the RAN
6\. [Conditional] RRC procedure:
6a. If the AMF included the Suspend indication, the NG-eNB releases the RRC
Connection with Suspend. The procedure is complete and following steps are
skipped.
6b. If the AMF did not include the Suspend indication and:
\- The UE did not include AS Release Assistance Indication; or
\- The AMF included the Extended Connected Time value.
the NG-eNB sends an RRC Resume message to the UE and the UE moves to CM-
CONNECTED and RRC Connected. The procedure is complete and the following steps
are skipped.
6c. Otherwise, if the AMF did not include Extended Connected Time value and
the UE included AS Release Assistance information with only a single Downlink
Data transmission subsequent to the Uplink transmission, the NG-eNB waits for
the DL data to arrive and proceeds to steps 7-10.
7-9. The NG-eNB releases the N3 connectivity by sending an N2 Suspend Request
to AMF including Suspend cause and N2 SM. Steps 2-4 of Connection Suspend
procedure in clause 4.8.1.2 is executed.
10\. [Conditional] NG-eNB to UE: RRC message (with DL data).
The NG-eNB ciphers received DL data.
The NG-eNB releases the RRC Connection with Suspend including the DL EDT data.
### 4.8.3 N2 Notification procedure
This procedure is used by an AMF to request the NG-RAN to report RRC state
information, when the target UE is in CM-CONNECTED state. When AMF has
requested reporting of subsequent state changes, the need for the NG-RAN to
continue reporting ceases when the UE transitions to CM-IDLE or the AMF sends
a cancel indication. This procedure may be used for services that require RRC
state information (e.g. 5GC MT control and paging assistance, O&M and
collection of statistics), or for subscription to the service by other NFs.
See TS 38.413 [10] for details of the procedure.
Reporting of RRC state transitions can be requested per UE by AMF. Continuous
reporting of all RRC state transitions can be enabled by operator local
configuration.
Figure 4.8.3-1: RRC state transition notification
1\. The AMF sends a UE State Transition Notification Request to the NG-RAN as
described in TS 38.413 [10]. The UE State Transition Notification Request
message shall identify the UE for which notification(s) are requested and may
contain a reporting type. The reporting type either indicates subsequent state
transitions shall be notified at every RRC state transition (i.e. from RRC
Connected state to RRC Inactive state, or from RRC Inactive to RRC Connected
state), or it indicates Single RRC-Connected state notification.
2\. The NG-RAN sends the UE Notification message to report the current RRC
state for the UE (i.e. RRC Inactive state or RRC Connected state). The current
UE location information (i.e. TAI + Cell Identity) is always included when RRC
state information is reported.
2b. When the AMF has requested reporting about subsequent state transitions,
the NG-RAN sends subsequent UE Notification messages to the AMF at every RRC
state transition until the UE transitions to CM-IDLE or NG-RAN receives a
Cancel UE State Notification message from the AMF.
When the AMF has requested reporting for Single RRC-Connected state
notification and UE is in RRC-Connected state, the NG-RAN sends one UE
Notification message but no subsequent messages. If UE is in RRC-Inactive
state, the NG-RAN sends one UE Notification message plus one subsequent UE
Notification message when RRC state transits to RRC-Connected.
3\. The AMF can send a Cancel UE State Notification message to inform the NG-
RAN that it should terminate notifications for a given UE. This message should
only be used when notification(s) about subsequent state transitions was
requested at every RRC state transition.
## 4.9 Handover procedures
### 4.9.1 Handover procedures in 3GPP access
#### 4.9.1.1 General
These procedures are used to hand over a UE from a source NG-RAN node to a
target NG-RAN node using the Xn or N2 reference points. This can be triggered,
for example, due to new radio conditions, load balancing or due to specific
service e.g. in the presence of QoS Flow for voice, the source NG-RAN node
being NR may trigger handover to E-UTRA connected to 5GC.
The RRC Inactive Assistance Information is included in N2 Path Switch Request
Ack message for Xn based handover or Handover Request message for N2 based
handover (see clause 5.3.3.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2]).
#### 4.9.1.2 Xn based inter NG-RAN handover
##### 4.9.1.2.1 General
Clause 4.9.1.2 includes details regarding the Xn based inter NG-RAN handover
with and without UPF re-allocation.
Xn handovers are only supported for intra-AMF mobility.
The handover preparation and execution phases are performed as specified in TS
38.300 [9], in the case of handover to a shared network, source NG-RAN
determines a PLMN or an SNPN to be used in the target network as specified by
TS 23.501 [2]. If the serving PLMN changes during Xn-based handover, the
source NG-RAN node shall indicate to the target NG-RAN node (in the Mobility
Restriction List) the selected PLMN ID to be used in the target network.
During Xn based handover into a shared NG-RAN node the source NG RAN node
shall include the serving NID (if available) in the Mobility Restriction List
to be used by the target NG-RAN node.
NOTE: When an SNPN is used in the source NG-RAN, the same SNPN is used in the
target network.
If the AMF generates the N2 downlink signalling during the ongoing handover
and receives a rejection to a N2 interface procedure (e.g. Location Reporting
Control; DL NAS message transfer; etc.) from the NG-RAN with an indication
that a Xn based handover procedure is in progress, the AMF may reattempt the
same N2 interface procedure either when the handover is complete or the
handover is deemed to have failed, when possible. The failure is known by
expiry of the timer guarding the N2 interface procedure.
Upon reception for an SMF initiated N1 and/or N2 request(s) with an indication
that the request has been temporarily rejected due to handover procedure in
progress, the SMF starts a locally configured guard timer. Any NF (e.g. the
SMF) should hold any signalling messages targeted towards AMF for a given UE
during the handover preparation phase unless it detects that the handover
execution is completed or handover has failed/cancelled. The NF (e.g. the SMF)
may re-attempt, up to a pre-configured number of times, when either it detects
that the handover is completed or has failed using message reception or at
expiry of the guard timer.
##### 4.9.1.2.2 Xn based inter NG-RAN handover without User Plane function re-
allocation
This procedure is used to hand over a UE from a source NG-RAN to target NG-RAN
using Xn when the AMF is unchanged and the SMF decides to keep the existing
UPF. The UPF referred in this clause 4.9.1.2.2 is the UPF which terminates N3
interface in the 5GC for non-roaming or local breakout roaming scenario, V-UPF
which terminates N3 interface in 5GC for home routed roaming scenario. The SMF
referred in this clause 4.9.1.2.2 is the V-SMF for home routed roaming
scenario. The presence of IP connectivity between the Source UPF and Target
NG-RAN is assumed.
The call flow is shown in figure 4.9.1.2.2-1.
Figure 4.9.1.2.2-1: Xn based inter NG-RAN handover without UPF re-allocation
1a. If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the source NG-
RAN node during the handover execution phase may provide RAN usage data Report
(N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT usage data), Handover Flag, Source to Target
transparent container) to the AMF. The source NG-RAN node shall provide this
only when the Target NG-RAN has confirmed handover over Xn interface. The
Handover Flag indicates to the AMF that it should buffer the N2 SM Information
containing the usage data report before forwarding it.
If the source NG RAN and target NG RAN support RACS as defined in TS 23.501
[2], the source NG-RAN provides the UE\'s UE Radio Capability ID to the target
NG-RAN. If the source NG-RAN has knowledge that the target NG-RAN might not
have a local copy of the Radio Capability corresponding to the UE Radio
Capability ID (i.e. because the source NG-RAN had itself to retrieve the UE\'s
Radio Capability from the AMF) then the source NG-RAN may also send some or
all of the UE\'s Radio Capability to the target NG-RAN (the size limit based
on local configuration) in Xn signalling as defined in TS 38.423 [72] . In the
case of inter-PLMN handover, when the source and target NG-RAN support RACS as
defined in TS 23.501 [2] and the source NG-RAN determines based on local
configuration that the target PLMN does not support the UE Radio Capability ID
assigned by the source PLMN, then the source NG-RAN shall provide the UE radio
access capabilities to the target NG-RAN and shall not send the UE Radio
Capability ID. If, as permitted in TS 38.423 [72], the target NG-RAN during
the handover preparation received the UE radio access capabilities but did not
receive the UE Radio Capability ID, NG-RAN shall proceed with handover using
the received UE radio access capabilities. If the target NG-RAN received both
the UE radio access capabilities and the UE Radio Capability ID, then the
target NG-RAN shall use any locally stored UE radio access capability
information corresponding to the UE Radio Capability ID. If none are stored
locally, the target NG-RAN may request the full UE radio access capability
information from the core network. If the full UE radio access capability
information is not promptly received from the core network, or the target NG-
RAN chooses not to request them, then the target NG-RAN shall proceed with the
UE radio access capabilities sent by the source NG-RAN. The target NG-RAN
shall not use the UE radio access capability information received from the
source NG-RAN for any other UE with the same the UE Radio Capability ID.
1b. Target NG-RAN to AMF: N2 Path Switch Request (List of PDU Sessions To Be
Switched with N2 SM Information, List of PDU Sessions that failed to be
established with the failure cause given in the N2 SM information element, UE
Location Information)
The Target NG-RAN sends an N2 Path Switch Request message to an AMF to inform
that the UE has moved to a new target cell and provides a List Of PDU Sessions
To Be Switched. AN Tunnel Info for each PDU Session to be switched is included
in the N2 SM Information.
If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows in the PDU
Session, two AN Tunnel Info are provided by the Target NG-RAN and the Target
NG-RAN indicates to the SMF one of the AN Tunnel Info is used as the
redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS
23.501 [2]. If only one AN Tunnel Info is provided by the Target NG-RAN for
the PDU session, the SMF may release these QoS Flows by triggering PDU Session
Modification procedure as specified in clause 4.3.3 after the handover
procedure.
The serving PLMN ID is included in the message. The target NG-RAN shall
include the PDU Session in the PDU Sessions Rejected list:
\- If none of the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are accepted by the Target NG-
RAN; or
\- If the corresponding network slice is not supported in the Target NG-RAN;
or
\- When the NG-RAN cannot set up user plane resources fulfilling the User
Plane Security Enforcement with a value Required, the NG-RAN rejects the
establishment of user plane resources for the PDU Session.
If the NG-RAN cannot set up user plane resources fulfilling the User Plane
Security Enforcement with a value Preferred, the NG-RAN establishes the user
plane resources for the PDU session and shall include the PDU Session in the
PDU Sessions Modified list.
PDU Sessions Rejected contains an indication of whether the PDU session was
rejected because User Plane Security Enforcement is not supported in the
Target NG-RAN. Depending on the type of target cell, the Target NG-RAN
includes appropriate information in this message.
For the PDU Sessions to be switched to the Target NG-RAN, the N2 Path Switch
Request message shall include the list of accepted QoS Flows. For each QoS
Flow accepted with an Alternative QoS Profile as specified in TS 23.501 [2],
the N2 SM Information shall include a reference to the fulfilled Alternative
QoS Profile.
2\. AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (N2 SM information
received from T-RAN in step 1b and N2 SM Information from source NG-RAN
(Secondary RAT usage data), UE Location Information, UE presence in LADN
service area). The N2 SM Information here from source NG-RAN is the one
buffered at step 1a when applicable.
The AMF sends N2 SM information by invoking the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request service operation for each PDU Session
in the lists of PDU Sessions received in the N2 Path Switch Request.
The Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request contains either an indication that
the PDU Session Is To Be Switched (together with information on the N3
addressing to use and on the transferred QoS flows) or an indication that the
PDU Session is to be Rejected (together with a rejection cause).
For a PDU Sessions to be switched to the Target NG-RAN, upon receipt of the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request, the SMF determines whether the
existing UPF can continue to serve the UE. If the existing UPF cannot continue
to serve the UE, steps 3-11 of clause 4.9.1.2.3 or 4.9.1.2.4 are performed
depending on whether the existing UPF is a PDU Session Anchor. Otherwise, the
following steps 3 to 6 are performed if the existing UPFs can continue to
serve the PDU Session.
In the case that the AMF determines that the PDU Session is related to a LADN,
then the AMF provides the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" to the SMF. If
the AMF does not provide the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication
and the SMF determines that the DNN corresponds to a LADN, then the SMF
considers that the UE is OUT of the LADN service area. The SMF takes actions
for the LADN PDU Session as defined in clause 5.6.5 of TS 23.501 [2] based on
the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication.
If a PDU Session is rejected by the Target NG-RAN with an indication that the
PDU session was rejected because User Plane Security Enforcement is not
supported in the Target NG-RAN and the User Plane Enforcement Policy indicates
\"Required\" as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF triggers
the release of this PDU Session. In all other cases of PDU Session rejection,
the SMF can decide whether to release the PDU Session or to deactivate the UP
connection of this PDU Session.
If some of the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are not accepted by the Target NG-
RAN, the SMF shall initiate the PDU Session Modification procedure to remove
the non-accepted QoS Flows from the PDU Session(s) after the handover
procedure is completed.
For the PDU Session(s) that do not have active N3 UP connections before
handover procedure, the SMF(s) keep the inactive status after handover
procedure.
If the UE moves into a non-Allowed Area, the AMF also notifies via
Namf_EventExposure_Notify to each NF Consumer (e.g. SMFs of the established
PDU Sessions) which has subscribed for UE reachability event, that the UE is
only reachable for regulatory prioritized services. The SMF then deactivates
the PDU session if this PDU Session is not for emergency service.
3\. SMF to UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (AN Tunnel Info)
For PDU Sessions that are modified by the Target NG-RAN, the SMF sends an N4
Session Modification Request message to the UPF. The SMF may notify the UPF
that originated the Data Notification to discard downlink data for the PDU
Sessions and/or to not provide further Data Notification messages.
Depending on the network deployment, the CN Tunnel Info of UPF used for
connection to Target NG-RAN and connection to Source NG-RAN may be different,
e.g. due to Source and Target NG-RAN are in different IP domains. In this case
the SMF may ask the UPF to allocate new CN Tunnel Info, providing the target
Network Instance.
4\. UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response (CN Tunnel Info)
For the PDU Sessions that are switched, the UPF returns an N4 Session
Modification Response message to the SMF after requested PDU Sessions are
switched. Tunnel identifiers for UL traffic are included only for PDU Sessions
whose user plane resources are not being released and was requested by the
SMF. If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of a PDU
Session and different CN Tunnel Info were requested by the SMF, the UPF
allocates two different CN Tunnel Info and indicates the SMF that one CN
Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described
in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. For the PDU Sessions that are
deactivated, the UPF returns an N4 Session Modification Response message to
the SMF after the N3 (R)AN tunnel information is released.
5\. In order to assist the reordering function in the Target NG-RAN, the UPF
(as specified in clause 5.8.2.9 of TS 23.501 [2]) sends one or more \"end
marker\" packets for each N3 tunnel on the old path immediately after
switching the path. The UPF starts sending downlink packets to the Target NG-
RAN.
6\. SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (N2 SM information)
The SMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response (N2 SM Information
(CN Tunnel Info, updated CN PDB for the accepted QoS Flows, Updated TSCAIs for
the accepted QoS Flows)) to the AMF for PDU Sessions which have been switched
successfully. The CN Tunnel Info of UPF send to AMF is used to setup N3
tunnel. If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of a
PDU Session, two CN Tunnel Info are sent and the SMF indicates to the Target
NG-RAN one of the CN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU
Session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF sends an
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response without including the CN Tunnel Info
to the AMF for the PDU Sessions for which user plane resources are deactivated
or released and then the SMF releases the PDU Session(s) which is to be
released using a separate procedure as defined in clause 4.3.4. For each
accepted GBR QoS Flow of Delay-critical resource type, the dynamic CN PDB and
TSCAI may be updated and sent to the Target NG-RAN by the SMF. The SMF may
update the CN PDB and TSCAI in the response or using a separate PDU Session
Modification procedure, based on local configuration.
If the Source NG-RAN does not support Alternative QoS Profiles (see TS 23.501
[2]) and the Target NG-RAN supports them, the SMF sends the Alternative QoS
Profiles (see TS 23.501 [2]) to the Target NG-RAN on a per QoS Flow basis, if
available.
NOTE: Step 6 can occur any time after receipt of N4 Session Modification
Response at the SMF.
7\. AMF to NG-RAN: N2 Path Switch Request Ack (N2 SM Information, Failed PDU
Sessions, UE Radio Capability ID).
Once the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response is received from all the
SMFs, the AMF aggregates received CN Tunnel Info and sends this aggregated
information as a part of N2 SM Information along with the Failed PDU Sessions
in N2 Path Switch Request Ack to the Target NG-RAN. If none of the requested
PDU Sessions have been switched successfully, the AMF shall send an N2 Path
Switch Request Failure message to the Target NG-RAN.
If the UE Radio Capability ID is included in the N2 Path Switch Request Ack
message, when there is no corresponding UE radio capabilities set for UE Radio
Capability ID at the target NR-RAN, the target NG-RAN shall request the AMF to
provide the UE radio capabilities set corresponding to UE Radio Capability ID
to the target NG-RAN.
8\. By sending a Release Resources message to the Source NG-RAN, the Target
NG-RAN confirms success of the handover. It then triggers the release of
resources with the Source NG-RAN.
9\. [Conditional] The UE may initiate Mobility Registration Update procedure
if one of the triggers of registration procedure applies as described in
clause 4.2.2.2.2. In this case, only steps 1, 2, 3, 17 and 21 in clause
4.2.2.2.2 are performed.
For the mobility related events as described in clause 4.15.4, the AMF invokes
the Namf_EventExposure_Notify service operation.
Upon reception of the Namf_EventExposure_Notify with an indication that UE is
reachable only for regulatory prioritized service, the SMF deactivates the PDU
Session if the service of the PDU Session is not regulatory prioritized. For
home routed roaming case, the V-SMF triggers the deactivation of the PDU
Session, in addition, the H-SMF refrains from sending downlink signalling if
the signalling is not related to regulatory prioritized service upon receiving
the notification.
##### 4.9.1.2.3 Xn based inter NG-RAN handover with insertion of intermediate
UPF
This procedure is used to hand over a UE from a Source NG-RAN to a Target NG-
RAN using Xn when the AMF is unchanged and the SMF decides that insertion of a
new additional intermediate UPF is needed. If redundant transmission is
performed for one or more QoS Flows of a PDU Session to be switched to the
target NG-RAN, the SMF may select two Intermediate UPFs (I-UPFs) and set up
two N3 and N9 tunnels between the Target NG-RAN and the UPF (PSA) via the two
I-UPFs as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
In the case of using UL CL, the I-UPF can be regarded as UL CL and additional
PSA providing local access to a DN. In the case of using Branching Point, the
I-UPF can be regarded as BP.
It is assumed that the PDU Session for the UE comprises of only one UPF that
acts as a PDU Session Anchor at the time of this Handover procedure for non-
roaming and local breakout roaming scenario. In the case of home routed
roaming scenario, the PDU Session of the UE comprises of at least one UPF in
the VPLMN and one UPF in the HPLMN at the time of this handover procedure. In
this case, additional insertion of an N3 terminating intermediate UPF will not
have impact on the connectivity between the UPF in VPLMN and UPF in HPLMN. The
presence of IP connectivity between the UPF (PDU Session Anchor) and Source
NG-RAN, between the UPF (PDU Session Anchor) and Target NG-RAN and between the
intermediate UPF (I-UPF) and Target NG-RAN, is assumed. (If there is no IP
connectivity between UPF (PDU Session Anchor) and Target NG-RAN, it is assumed
that the N2-based handover procedure in clause 4.9.1.3 shall be used instead).
The call flow is shown in figure 4.9.1.2.3-1.
Figure 4.9.1.2.3-1: Xn based inter NG-RAN handover with insertion of
intermediate UPF
Steps 1-2 are the same as described in clause 4.9.1.2.2.
3a. [Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.
If the SMF selects a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF for the PDU Session
and the different CN Tunnel Info need be used, the SMF sends N4 Session
Modification Request message to UPF (PSA).
3b. [Conditional] UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
The UPF (PSA) sends an N4 Session Establishment Response message to the SMF.
The UPF provides CN Tunnel Info (on N9) to the SMF. If redundant transmission
is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU Session, the UPF (PSA)
provides two CN Tunnel Info (on N9) to the SMF and indicates the SMF that one
CN Tunnel Info is used as redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session as described in
in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The UPF (PSA) associate the CN Tunnel
Info (on N9) with UL Packet detection rules provided by the SMF.
4a. SMF to I-UPF: N4 Session Establishment Request (Target NG-RAN Tunnel Info,
CN Tunnel Info of the PDU Session Anchor)
For PDU Sessions to be updated, if the UE has moved out of the service area of
UPF connecting to the serving NG-RAN node, the SMF then selects an I-UPF based
on UPF Selection Criteria according to clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. An N4
Session Establishment Request message is sent to the I-UPF. The CN Tunnel Info
of the PDU Session Anchor, which is used to setup N9 tunnel, is included in
the N4 Session Establishment Request message.
4b. I-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Establishment Response.
The I-UPF sends an N4 Session Establishment Response message to the SMF. The
UL and DL CN Tunnel Info of I-UPF is sent to the SMF.
If SMF select two Intermediate UPFs (I-UPFs) to perform redundant transmission
for a PDU session, step 4a and 4b are performed between the SMF and each
I-UPF.
5\. SMF to PDU Session Anchor: N4 Session Modification Request (DL CN Tunnel
Info of the I-UPF).
The SMF sends N4 Session Modification Request message to the PDU Session
Anchor.
If a different CN Tunnel Info is used on N9 in UPF (PSA), the SMF starts a
timer to release the CN Tunnel for N3. Otherwise the SMF does not need to
start a timer to release the CN Tunnel Info used on N3 in UPF(PSA) (i.e. CN
Tunnel Info is common for both N3 and N9).
If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU
Session, the SMF provides two DL CN Tunnel Info (for N9) to the UPF (PSA) and
indicates to the UPF (PSA) one of the DL CN Tunnel Info is used as redundancy
tunnel of the PDU Session.
6\. PDU Session Anchor to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
The PDU Session Anchor responds with the N4 Session Modification Response
message after requested PDU Sessions are switched. At this point, PDU Session
Anchor starts sending downlink packets to the Target NG-RAN via I-UPF.
7\. In order to assist the reordering function in the Target NG-RAN, the PDU
Session Anchor sends one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N3 tunnel on
the old path immediately after switching the path, the source NG-RAN shall
forward the \"end marker\" packets to the target NG-RAN.
8\. SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (N2 SM Information
(UL CN Tunnel Info of the I-UPF, updated QoS parameters for accepted QoS
Flows)).
The SMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response to the AMF.
Steps 8-11 are same as steps 6-9 defined in clause 4.9.1.2.2.
12\. After the timer set in step 5 expires, the SMF informs the PDU Session
Anchor to remove the CN Tunnel for N3 via N4 Session Modification procedure.
##### 4.9.1.2.4 Xn based inter NG-RAN handover with re-allocation of
intermediate UPF
This procedure is used to hand over a UE from a Source NG-RAN to a Target NG-
RAN using Xn when the AMF is unchanged and the SMF decides that the
intermediate UPF (I-UPF) is to be changed. In the case of using UL CL, the
I-UPF can be regarded as UL CL and additional PSA provides local access to a
DN, the simultaneous change of UL-CL and the additional PSA is described in
clause 4.3.5.7. In the case of using Branching Point, the I-UPF can be
regarded as BP.
It is assumed that the PDU Session for the UE comprises of a UPF that acts as
a PDU Session Anchor and an intermediate UPF at the time of this Handover
procedure for non-roaming and local breakout roaming scenario. In the case of
home routed roaming scenario, the PDU Session of the UE comprises of at least
one UPF in the VPLMN and UPF in the HPLMN which acts as a PDU Session Anchor
at the time of this handover procedure. The Source UPF referred in this clause
4.9.1.2.4 is the UPF which terminates N3 interface in the 5GC. The presence of
IP connectivity between the Source UPF and Source NG-RAN, between the source
UPF and Target NG-RAN and between the Target UPF and Target NG-RAN, is
assumed. (If there is no IP connectivity between source UPF and Target NG-RAN,
it is assumed that the N2-based handover procedure in clause 4.9.1.3 shall be
used instead).
The call flow is shown in figure 4.9.1.2.4-1.
Figure 4.9.1.2.4-1: Xn based inter NG-RAN handover with intermediate UPF re-
allocation
Steps 1-4 are same as steps 1-4 described in clause 4.9.1.2.3 except that the
I-UPF in clause 4.9.1.2.3 is replaced by Target UPF.
5\. [Conditional] The SMF sends N4 Session Modification Request message to the
PDU Session Anchor. The DL CN Tunnel Info of the Target UPF is included in
this message. If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows
of the PDU Session, the SMF provides two DL CN Tunnel Info (for N9) to the UPF
(PSA) and indicates to the UPF (PSA) one of the DL CN Tunnel Info is used as
redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session.
In the case of home routed roaming, if the N9 terminating V-UPF, which is
connected to with home UPF, is changed, the V-SMF invokes an
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (DL CN Tunnel Info) service operation toward
the H-SMF.
6\. [Conditional] The SMF associated with the PDU Session Anchor responds with
the N4 Session Modification Response message. In the case of home routed
roaming, the H-SMF responds with the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response service
operation toward the V-SMF once H-UPF is updated with the DL Tunnel Info of
the T-UPF. At this point, PDU Session Anchor starts sending downlink packets
to the Target NG-RAN via Target UPF.
Steps 7-11 are same as steps 7-11 described in clause 4.9.1.2.3 except that
the I-UPF in clause 4.9.1.2.3 is replaced by Target UPF.
If the Source UPF acts as a UL CL or BP, the SMF indicates to only one of the
PDU Session Anchors to send the \"end marker\" packets. To ensure the \"end
marker\" is the last user plane packet on the old path, the SMF should modify
the path on other PDU Session Anchors before it indicates the PDU Session
Anchor to send the \"end marker\" packets.
11\. The timer is started in step 4 if the source UPF is not the PSA UPF. When
this timer is expired, the SMF initiates Source UPF(s) Release procedure by
sending an N4 Session Release Request (Release Cause).
12\. The Source UPF(s) acknowledges with an N4 Session Release Response
message to confirm the release of resources.
#### 4.9.1.3 Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover
##### 4.9.1.3.1 General
Clause 4.9.1.3 includes details regarding the inter NG-RAN node N2 based
handover without Xn interface.
The source NG-RAN decides to initiate an N2-based handover to the target NG-
RAN. This can be triggered, for example, due to new radio conditions or load
balancing, if there is no Xn connectivity to the target NG-RAN, an error
indication from the target NG-RAN after an unsuccessful Xn-based handover
(i.e. no IP connectivity between T-RAN and S-UPF), or based on dynamic
information learnt by the S-RAN.
The availability of a direct forwarding path is determined in the source NG-
RAN and indicated to the SMFs. If IP connectivity is available between the
source and target NG-RAN and security association(s) is in place between them,
a direct forwarding path is available.
If a direct forwarding path is not available, indirect forwarding may be used.
The SMFs use the indication from the source NG-RAN to determine whether to
apply indirect forwarding.
If both source NG-RAN and source AMF support DAPS the source NG-RAN may decide
that some of the DRBs are subject for DAPS handover as defined in TS 38.300
[9]; in this case, the source NG-RAN provides the DAPS information indicating
the request concerns a DAPS handover for the DRB as part of the Source to
Target (NG-RAN) Transparent Container. If the target NG-RAN accepts that the
request concerns DAPS handover and both Target NG-RAN and Target AMF support
DAPS, the DAPS handover will be performed and target NG-RAN provides DAPS
response information as part of the Target to Source (NG-RAN) Transparent
Container.
In the case of handover to a shared network, the source NG-RAN determines a
PLMN to be used in the target network as specified by TS 23.501 [2]. The
source NG-RAN shall indicate the selected PLMN ID to be used in the target
network to the AMF as part of the Tracking Area sent in the HO Required
message.
NOTE: When an SNPN is used in the source NG-RAN, the same SNPN is used in the
target network.
If the AMF generates the N2 downlink signalling during the ongoing handover
and receives a rejection to a N2 interface procedure (e.g. DL NAS message
transfer; Location reporting control; etc.) from the NG-RAN with an indication
that an Inter NG-RAN node handover procedure is in progress, the AMF may
reattempt the same N2 interface procedure either when the handover is complete
or the handover is deemed to have failed if the AMF is still the serving AMF,
when possible. If the Inter NG-RAN node handover changes the serving AMF, the
source AMF shall terminate any other ongoing N2 interface procedures except
the handover procedure.
In order to minimize the number of procedures rejected by NG-RAN, the AMF
should pause non-handover related N2 interface procedures (e.g. DL NAS message
transfer, Location Report Control, etc.) while a handover is ongoing (i.e.
from the time that a Handover Required has been received until either the
Handover procedure has succeeded (Handover Notify) or failed (Handover
Failure)) and continue them once the Handover procedure has completed if the
AMF is still the serving AMF.
If during the handover procedure the AMF detects that the AMF needs be
changed, the AMF shall reject any SMF initiated N2 request received since
handover procedure started and shall include an indication that the request
has been temporarily rejected due to handover procedure in progress.
Upon reception for an SMF initiated N1 and/or N2 request(s) with an indication
either from the NG-RAN (via N2 SM Info) or AMF that the request has been
temporarily rejected due to handover procedure in progress, the SMF starts a
locally configured guard timer. The SMF should hold any signalling messages
targeted towards AMF for a given UE during the handover preparation phase
unless it detects that the handover execution is completed or handover has
failed/cancelled. The SMF may re-attempt, up to a pre-configured number of
times, when either it detects that the handover is completed or has failed
using message reception or at expiry of the guard timer.
In the case of home routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the Inter NG-RAN node
N2 based handover procedure (Figure 4.9.1.3.2-1 and Figure 4.9.1.3.3-1)
interacting with the S-UPF, T-UPF, S-AMF and T-AMF is the V-SMF and the SMF
(Figure 4.9.1.3.3-1) interacting with the UPF (PSA) is the H-SMF.
##### 4.9.1.3.2 Preparation phase
Figure 4.9.1.3.2-1: Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover, Preparation phase
1\. S-RAN to S-AMF: Handover Required (Target ID, Source to Target transparent
container, _SM N2 info list,_ PDU Session IDs, intra system handover
indication).
_Source to Target transparent container_ includes NG-RAN information created
by S-RAN to be used by T-RAN and is transparent to 5GC. It also contains for
each PDU session the corresponding QoS flows /DRBs information subject to data
forwarding. It may also contain DAPS Information if DAPS handover is supported
by S-RAN and S-AMF and DAPS handover is requested for one or more DRBs as
described in TS 38.300 [9].
All PDU Sessions handled by S-RAN (i.e. all existing PDU Sessions with active
UP connections) shall be included in the Handover Required message, indicating
which of those PDU Session(s) are requested by S-RAN to handover. The SM N2
info includes Direct Forwarding Path Availability if direct data forwarding is
available.
Direct Forwarding Path Availability indicates whether direct forwarding is
available from the S-RAN to the T-RAN. This indication from S-RAN can be based
on e.g. the presence of IP connectivity and security association(s) between
the S-RAN and the T-RAN.
If the source NG RAN and target NG RAN support RACS as defined in TS 23.501
[2], the Source to Target transparent container need not carry the UE radio
access capabilities (instead the UE Radio Capability ID is supplied from the
CN to the T-RAN). However, if the source NG-RAN has knowledge that the target
NG-RAN might not have a local copy of the Radio Capability corresponding to
the UE Radio Capability ID (i.e. because the source NG-RAN had itself to
retrieve the UE\'s Radio Capability from the AMF) then the source NG-RAN may
also send some (or all) of the UE\'s Radio Capability to the target NG-RAN
(the size limit based on local configuration). In the case of inter-PLMN
handover, when the source and target NG-RAN support RACS as defined in TS
23.501 [2] and the source NG-RAN determines based on local configuration that
the target PLMN does not support the UE Radio Capability ID assigned by the
source PLMN, then the source NG-RAN includes the UE radio access capabilities
in the Source to Target transparent container.
2\. T-AMF Selection: _When the S-AMF can\'t serve the UE anymore, the S-AMF
selects_ the _T-AMF_ as described in clause 6.3.5 on \"AMF Selection
Function\" in TS 23.501 [2].
3\. [Conditional] S-AMF to T-AMF: _Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext Request
(N2 Information (_ Target ID, Source to Target transparent container, _SM N2
information list_ , PDU Session IDs _),_ UE context information (SUPI, Service
area restriction, Allowed NSSAI for each Access Type if available, Tracing
Requirements, LTE M Indication, the list of PDU Session IDs along with the
corresponding SMF information and the corresponding S-NSSAI(s), PCF ID(s),
DNN, UE Radio Capability ID and UE Radio Capability Information _). If the
subscription information includes Tracing Requirements, the old AMF provides
the target AMF with Tracing Requirements._
In inter PLMN mobility case, UE context information includes HPLMN S-NSSAIs
corresponding to the Allowed NSSAI for each Access Type, without Allowed NSSAI
of source PLMN. The target AMF may determine the Allowed NSSAI based on the
HPLMN S-NSSAIs received in step 3, or else the target AMF queries the NSSF by
invoking Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation with the HPLMN S-NSSAIs and
PLMN ID of SUPI.
The S-AMF initiates Handover resource allocation procedure by invoking the
Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext service operation towards the T-AMF.
When the S-AMF can still serve the UE, this step and step 12 are not needed.
If Service area restrictions are available in the S-AMF, they may be forwarded
to the T-AMF as described in clause 5.3.4.1.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
If both Home and Visited PCF ID(s) are provided by the S-AMF, the T-AMF
contacts the (V-) PCF identified by the (V-)PCF ID. If the (V-)PCF identified
by the (V-)PCF ID is not used or there are no PCF ID(s) received from the
S-AMF, the T-AMF may select the PCF(s) as described in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS
23.501 [2] and according to the V-NRF to H-NRF interaction described in clause
4.3.2.2.3.3. The T-AMF informs the S-AMF that the PCF ID is not used, as
defined in step 12 and then the S-AMF terminates the AM Policy Association
with the PCF identified by the PCF ID.
4\. [Conditional] T-AMF to SMF: _Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (_ PDU
Session ID, Target ID, T-AMF ID, N2 SM Information _)._
For each PDU Session indicated by S-RAN, the AMF invokes the
_Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request_ to the associated SMF. However, if
the S-NSSAI associated with PDU Session is not available in the T-AMF, the
T-AMF does not invoke Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext for this PDU Session.
PDU Session ID indicates a PDU Session candidate for N2 Handover. Target ID
corresponds to Target ID provided by S-RAN in step 1. SM N2 Info includes the
Direct Forwarding Path Availability if the direct data forwarding is available
between the S-RAN and the T-RAN and has been inserted by the S-RAN.
If the (T-)AMF detects that the UE moves into a non-allowed area based on
Service area restrictions, the (Tâ€‘)AMF notifies each NF consumer which has
subscribed for UE reachability event (e.g. SMFs corresponding to the list of
PDU Sessions received in UE Context from (S-)AMF via Namf_EventExposure_Notify
that the UE is only reachable for regulatory prioritized services.
5\. [Conditional] Based on the Target ID, SMF checks if N2 Handover for the
indicated PDU Session can be accepted. The SMF checks also the UPF Selection
Criteria according to clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If UE has moved out of
the service area of the UPF connecting to NG-RAN, SMF selects a new
intermediate UPF. If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS
Flows of the PDU Session, the SMF selects two new Intermediate UPFs to support
the redundant transmission based on two N3 and N9 tunnels between the T-RAN
and the UPF (PSA) as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. In this
case, step 6c and 6d are performed between SMF and each T-UPF.
In the case that the SMF fails to find a suitable I-UPF, the SMF decides to
(based on local policies) either:
\- trigger re-establishment of PDU Session. After handover procedure, SMF
sends N1 message to the UE via the AMF by invoking
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer containing the cause indicating PDU
Session re-establishment is required for the UE; or
\- keep the PDU Session, but reject the activation request of User Plane
connection for the PDU Session and inform the AMF about it; or
\- release the PDU Session after handover procedure.
6a. [Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.
If the SMF selects a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF for the PDU Session
and the different CN Tunnel Info need be used, the SMF sends N4 Session
Modification Request message to UPF (PSA). The SMF provides the CN Tunnel Info
(on N9) if the CN Tunnel Info is allocated by the SMF and UL Packet detection
rules associate the CN Tunnel Info (on N9) to be installed on the UPF (PSA).
If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU
Session and the different CN Tunnel Info need be used, the SMF provides two CN
Tunnel Info (on N9) to the UPF (PSA) if the CN Tunnel Info is allocated by the
SMF and indicates to the UPF (PSA) one of the CN Tunnel Info is used as
redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session.
6b. [Conditional] UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
The UPF (PSA) sends an N4 Session Modification Response message to the SMF. If
the UPF (PSA) allocates CN Tunnel Info (on N9) of UPF (PSA), it provides CN
Tunnel Info (on N9) to the SMF. If redundant transmission is performed for one
or more QoS Flows of the PDU Session, the UPF (PSA) provides two CN Tunnel
Info (on N9) of UPF (PSA) to the SMF and indicates the SMF that one CN Tunnel
Info is used as redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session as described in in clause
5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The UPF (PSA) associate the CN Tunnel Info (on N9)
with UL Packet detection rules provided by the SMF.
6c. [Conditional] SMF to T-UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Establishment
Request.
If the SMF selects a new intermediate UPF, i.e. the target UPF (T-UPF), for
the PDU Session and if CN Tunnel Info is allocated by the T-UPF, an N4 Session
Establishment Request message is sent to the T-UPF, providing Packet
detection, enforcement and reporting rules to be installed on the T-UPF. The
CN Tunnel Info (on N9) of UPF (PSA) for this PDU Session, which is used to
setup N9 tunnel, is also provided to the T-UPF.
6d. T-UPF (intermediate) to SMF: N4 Session Establishment Response.
The T-UPF sends an N4 Session Establishment Response message to the SMF with
DL CN Tunnel Info and UL CN Tunnel Info (i.e. N3 tunnel info). The SMF starts
a timer to release the resource of S-UPF, which is to be used in step 13a of
the Execution Phase.
7\. SMF to T-AMF: _Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (_ PDU Session ID,
N2 SM Information, Reason for non-acceptance _)._
If N2 handover for the PDU Session is accepted, the SMF includes in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response the N2 SM Information containing the
N3 UP address and the UL CN Tunnel ID of the UPF, the QoS parameters, TSCAI
and the User Plane Security Enforcement information for the Target NG-RAN. If
redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU
Session, two UL CN Tunnel Info are included in the N2 SM Information. If the
N2 SM information received at step 4 does not include the Direct Forwarding
Path Availability and the SMF knows that there is no indirect data forwarding
connectivity between source and target, the N2 SM Information includes a Data
forwarding not possible indication. If the SMF indicated that Direct
Forwarding is applicable in step 4, the SMF should further include a \"Direct
Forwarding Path Availability\" indication in the N2 SM information container.
The SMF sends the Alternative QoS Profiles (see TS 23.501 [2]) to the Target
NG-RAN on a per QoS Flow basis, if available.
If N2 handover for the PDU Session is not accepted as described in step 5, the
SMF does not include an N2 SM Information regarding the PDU Session to avoid
establishment of radio resources at the target NG-RAN. Instead of that, the
SMF provides a reason for non-acceptance. If the SMF has received notification
from (T-)AMF that the UE is only reachable for regulatory prioritized
services, the SMF does not include any N2 SM info regarding the PDU Session
for non-regulatory prioritized services to avoid establishment of radio
resources at the target NG-RAN. If the SMF receives notification from (T-)AMF
that UE is only reachable for regulatory prioritized service after this step
via Namf_EventExposure_Notify, the SMF deactivates the PDU Session after
handover procedure finish if the PDU Session is not for regulatory prioritized
services.
8\. AMF supervises the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response messages from
the involved SMFs. The lowest value of the Max delay indications for the PDU
Sessions that are candidates for handover gives the maximum time AMF may wait
for Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response messages before continuing with
the N2 Handover procedure. At expiry of the maximum wait time or when all
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response messages are received, AMF continues
with the N2 Handover procedure (Handover Request message in step 9).
NOTE: The delay value for each PDU Session is locally configured in the AMF
and implementation specific.
9\. T-AMF to T-RAN: _Handover Request (_ Source to Target transparent
container, N2 MM Information, N2 SM Information list, Tracing Requirements, UE
Radio Capability ID _). If the subscription information includes Tracing
Requirements, the target AMF provides the target RAN with Tracing Requirements
in the Handover Request._
T-AMF determines T-RAN based on Target ID. T-AMF may allocate a 5G-GUTI valid
for the UE in the AMF and target TAI.
_Source to Target_ transparent container is forwarded as received from S-RAN.
N2 MM Information includes e.g. security information and Mobility Restriction
List if available in the T-AMF.
N2 SM Information list includes N2 SM Information received from SMFs for the
T-RAN in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response messages received within
allowed max delay supervised by the T-AMF mentioned in step 8.
Mobility Restriction List is sent in N2 MM Information if available in the
Target AMF.
T-AMF provides the UE Radio Capability ID to T-RAN if RACS is supported. If
the UE Radio Capability ID is included in the Handover Request message and no
UE radio access capabilities are provided in the Source to Target transparent
container, when there is no corresponding UE radio capabilities set for UE
Radio Capability ID at T-RAN, T-RAN shall request the T-AMF to provide the UE
radio capabilities set corresponding to UE Radio Capability ID to the T-RAN.
If the Source to Target transparent container contains the UE radio access
capabilities and the T-RAN did not receive the UE Radio Capability ID from the
T-AMF, NG-RAN shall proceed with handover using the received UE radio access
capabilities. If the T-RAN received both the UE radio access capabilities and
the UE Radio Capability ID, then the T-RAN shall use any locally stored UE
radio access capability information corresponding to the UE Radio Capability
ID. If none are stored locally, the T-RAN may request the full UE radio access
capability information from the core network. If the full UE radio access
capability information is not promptly received from the core network, or the
T-RAN chooses not to request them, then the T-RAN shall proceed with the UE
radio access capabilities sent by the source RAN node. The T-RAN shall not use
the UE radio access capability information received from the source RAN node
for any other UE with the same the UE Radio Capability ID.
10\. T-RAN to T-AMF: _Handover Request Acknowledge (_ Target to Source
transparent container, List of PDU Sessions to Hand-over with N2 SM
information, List of PDU Sessions that failed to be established with the
failure cause given in the N2 SM information element _)._
_Target to Source transparent container_ includes a UE container with an
access stratum part and a NAS part. The UE container is sent transparently via
T-AMF, S-AMF and S-RAN to the UE. If DAPS handover is supported by the T-RAN
and T-AMF and the DAPS Information for one or more DRBs had been received in
the Source to Target Transparent Container, the T-RAN includes the DAPS
Response information in the Target to Source Transparent Container as
described in TS 38.300 [9].
T-RAN creates List Of PDU Sessions failed to be setup and reason for failure
(e.g. T-RAN decision, S-NSSAI is not available, unable to fulfil User Plane
Security Enforcement) based on T-RAN determination. The information is
provided to the S-RAN.
The N2 SM information in the List Of PDU Sessions to Hand-over, contains per
each PDU Session ID T-RAN N3 addressing information i.e. N3 UP address and
Tunnel ID of T-RAN for the PDU Session.
If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU
Session, the T-RAN provides two AN Tunnel Info for the PDU Session in the N2
SM information. The T-RAN indicates to the SMF one of the AN Tunnel Info is
used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described in clause
5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. If only one AN Tunnel Info is provided by the
Target NG-RAN for the PDU session, the SMF may release these QoS Flows by
triggering PDU Session Modification procedure as specified in clause 4.3.3
after the handover procedure.
The N2 SM information may also include:
\- an Indication whether UP integrity protection is performed or not on the
PDU Session based on User Plane Security Enforcement information received in
N2 SM information in step 9.
\- if the PDU Session has at least one QoS Flow subject for data forwarding,
N3 UP address and Tunnel ID of T-RAN for receiving forwarded data. The T-RAN
provides data forwarding addresses for each data forwarding tunnel which it
decided to setup.
\- For each QoS Flow accepted with an Alternative QoS Profile (see TS 23.501
[2]), the Target NG-RAN shall include a reference to the fulfilled Alternative
QoS Profile.
11a. AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext _Request (_ PDU Session ID,
N2 SM response received from T-RAN in step 10 _)._
For each N2 SM response received from the T-RAN (N2 SM information included in
Handover Request Acknowledge), AMF sends the received N2 SM response to the
SMF indicated by the respective PDU Session ID.
If no new T-UPF is selected, SMF stores the N3 tunnel info of T-RAN from the
N2 SM response if N2 handover is accepted by T-RAN.
The SMF/UPF allocates the N3 UP address and Tunnel IDs for indirect data
forwarding corresponding to the data forwarding tunnel endpoints established
by T-RAN.
If a PDU Session is indicated as a rejected PDU Session by the Target NG-RAN
with an indication that the PDU session was rejected because User Plane
Security Enforcement is not supported in the Target NG-RAN and the User Plane
Enforcement Policy indicates \"Required\" as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS
23.501 [2], the SMF triggers the release of this PDU Session. In all other
cases of PDU Session rejection, the SMF can decide whether to release the PDU
Session (possibly triggering the re-establishment of the PDU Session as
described in step 5) or to deactivate the UP connection of this PDU Session.
If some of the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are not accepted by the Target NG-
RAN, the SMF shall initiate the PDU Session Modification procedure to remove
the non-accepted QoS Flows from the PDU Session(s) after the handover
procedure is completed.
11b. [Conditional] SMF to T-UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (T-RAN SM N3
forwarding Information list, indication to allocate DL forwarding tunnel(s)
for indirect forwarding)
If the SMF selected a T-UPF in step 6a, the SMF updates the T-UPF by providing
the T-RAN SM N3 forwarding information list by sending a N4 Session
Modification Request to the T-UPF.
If indirect forwarding applies based on indication from the S-RAN and the UPF
is re-allocated and if the SMF decides to setup the indirect forwarding tunnel
on the same T-UPF, the SMF also requests in the N4 Session Modification
Request message to the T-UPF, to allocate DL forwarding tunnel(s) for indirect
forwarding.
Indirect forwarding may be performed via a UPF which is different from the
T-UPF, in which case the SMF selects a T-UPF for indirect forwarding.
11c. [Conditional] T-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response (T-UPF SM N3
forwarding Information list).
The T-UPF allocates Tunnel Info and returns an N4 Session Modification
Response message to the SMF.
The T-UPF SM N3 forwarding info list includes T-UPF N3 address, T-UPF N3
Tunnel identifiers for forwarding data
11d. [Conditional] SMF to S-UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (T-RAN SM N3
forwarding Information list or T-UPF SM N3 forwarding Information list,
indication to allocate DL forwarding tunnel(s) for indirect forwarding).
If the UPF is re-allocated, this message includes the T-UPF SM N3 forwarding
info list. If the UPF is not re-allocated, this message includes the T-RAN SM
N3 forwarding info list.
If indirect forwarding applies based on indication from NG-RAN and UPF
allocates tunnel identities, the SMF indicates in the N4 Session Modification
Request message to the S-UPF to allocate DL forwarding tunnel(s) for indirect
forwarding.
Indirect forwarding may be performed via a UPF which is different from the
S-UPF.
11e. [Conditional] S-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response (S-UPF SM N3
forwarding Information list).
The S-UPF allocates Tunnel Info and returns an N4 Session establishment
Response message to the SMF.
The S-UPF SM N3 forwarding Information list includes S-UPF N3 address, S-UPF
N3 Tunnel identifiers for DL data forwarding.
11f. SMF to T-AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (N2 SM
Information).
The SMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response message per PDU
Session to T-AMF.
The SMF creates an N2 SM information containing the DL forwarding Tunnel Info
to be sent to the S-RAN by the AMF. The SMF includes this information in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response. The DL forwarding Tunnel Info can be
one of the following information:
\- If direct forwarding applies, then the SMF includes the T-RAN N3 forwarding
information the SMF received in step 11a.
\- If the indirect forwarding tunnel is setup in step 11b or 11d, then the SMF
includes the T-UPF or S-UPF DL forwarding information containing the N3 UP
address and the DL Tunnel ID of the UPF.
12\. [Conditional] T-AMF to S-AMF: Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext Response
(N2 information necessary for S-AMF to send Handover Command to S-RAN
including Target to Source transparent container, PDU Sessions failed to be
setup list, N2 SM information (N3 DL forwarding Information, PCF ID)).
AMF supervises the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response message from the
involved SMFs. At expiry of the maximum wait time or when all
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response messages are received, T-AMF sends
the Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext Response to the S-AMF.
The PDU Sessions failed to be setup list includes the List Of PDU Sessions
failed to be setup received from target RAN in step 10 and the Non-accepted
PDU session List generated by the T-AMF.
Non-accepted PDU Session List includes following PDU Session(s) with proper
cause value:
\- Non-accepted PDU Session(s) by the SMF(s);
\- Non-accepted PDU Session(s) by the AMF due to no response from the SMF
within maximum wait time; and
\- Non-accepted PDU Session(s) by the AMF due to non-available S-NSSAI in the
T-AMF, which is decided at step 4.
The Target to Source transport container is received from the T-RAN. The N2 SM
Information is received from the SMF in step 11f.
##### 4.9.1.3.3 Execution phase
Figure 4.9.1.3.3-1: inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover, execution phase
NOTE 1: Registration of serving AMF with the UDM is not shown in the figure
for brevity.
1\. S-AMF to S-RAN: _Handover Command (_ Target to Source transparent
container, List Of PDU Sessions to be handed-over with N2 SM information
containing information received from T-RAN during the handover preparation
phase, List Of PDU Sessions failed to be setup _)._
Target to Source transparent container is forwarded as received from S-AMF. If
DAPS Response information for one or more DRBs is received by S-RAN and
indicates that DAPS handover is accepted, the execution phase for DAPS
handover procedure as described in clause 4.9.1.3.3a is performed.
The SM forwarding info list includes T-RAN SM N3 forwarding info list for
direct forwarding or S-UPF SM N3 forwarding info list for indirect data
forwarding
S-RAN uses the PDU Sessions failed to be setup list and the indicated reason
for failure to decide whether to proceed with the N2 Handover procedure.
If the S-RAN supports and receives a reference to an Alternative QoS Profile
for an accepted QoS Flow, it shall take it into account for deciding whether
or not to proceed with the N2 Handover procedure (see TS 23.501 [2]).
2\. S-RAN to UE: _Handover Command (_ UE container _)._
UE container is a UE part of the Target to Source transparent container which
is sent transparently from T-RAN via AMF to S-RAN and is provided to the UE by
the S-RAN.
2a0. If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting and the source
NG-RAN has Secondary RAT usage data to report, the source NG-RAN node may
provide RAN usage data report message (N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT usage
data), Handover Flag) as in clause 4.21 to the AMF. The Handover Flag
indicates to the AMF that it should buffer the N2 SM Information containing
the usage data report before forwarding it.
NOTE 2: This step is not shown in this figure but the secondary RAT usage data
reporting procedure is shown in figure 4.21-1 in clause 4.21.
2a. - 2c. The S-RAN sends the Uplink RAN Status Transfer message to the S-AMF,
as specified in TS 36.300 [46] and TS 38.300 [9]. The S-RAN may omit sending
this message if none of the radio bearers of the UE shall be treated with PDCP
status preservation.
If there is an AMF relocation, the S-AMF sends this information to the T-AMF
via the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation and the T-AMF
acknowledges. The S-AMF or, if the AMF is relocated, the T-AMF, sends the
information to the T-RAN via the Downlink RAN Status Transfer message, as
specified in TS 36.300 [46] and TS 38.300 [9].
3\. Uplink packets are sent from T-RAN to T-UPF and UPF (PSA). Downlink
packets are sent from UPF (PSA) to S-RAN via S-UPF. The S-RAN should start
forwarding of downlink data from the S-RAN towards the T-RAN for QoS Flows or
DRBs subject to data forwarding. This may be either direct (step 3a) or
indirect forwarding (step 3b).
4\. UE to T-RAN: _Handover Confirm._
After the UE has successfully synchronized to the target cell, it sends a
Handover Confirm message to the T-RAN. Handover is by this message considered
as successful by the UE.
5\. T-RAN to T-AMF: _Handover Notify._
Handover is by this message considered as successful in T-RAN.
6a. [Conditional] T-AMF to S-AMF: Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify.
The T-AMF notifies to the S-AMF about the N2 handover notify received from the
T-RAN by invoking the Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify.
A timer in S-AMF is started to supervise when resources in S-RAN shall be
release.
6b. [Conditional] S-AMF to T-AMF: Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify ACK (N2 SM
Information (Secondary RAT usage data)).
The S-AMF acknowledges by sending the Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify ACK to
the T-AMF. The N2 SM Information here is the one buffered at step 2a0 when
applicable.
6c. [Conditional] S-AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request (SM
Context ID, N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT Usage Data))_._
If the PDU Session(s) is not accepted by the T-AMF (e.g. S-NSSAI associated
with the PDU Session is not available in the T-AMF), S-AMF triggers PDU
Session Release procedure as specified in clause 4.3.4.2 after the S-AMF is
notified for the reception of N2 Handover Notify in step 6a.
7\. T-AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (Handover Complete
indication for PDU Session ID, UE presence in LADN service area, N2 SM
Information (Secondary RAT usage data))_. The N2 SM Information here is the
one received at step 6b when applicable._
Handover Complete indication is sent per each PDU Session to the corresponding
SMF to indicate the success of the N2 Handover.
When an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response message arrived too late
during the handover preparation phase (see step 8 of clause 4.9.1.3.2), or the
PDU Session with SMF involvement is not accepted by T-RAN,
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (SM Context ID, Operation Type) is
sent to the corresponding SMF allowing the SMF to deallocate a possibly
allocated N3 UP address and Tunnel ID of the selected UPF. A PDU Session
handled by that SMF is considered deactivated and handover attempt is
terminated for that PDU Session.
In the case that the AMF determines that the PDU Session is related to a LADN
then the AMF provides the \"UE presence in LADN service area\". If the AMF
does not provide the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication and the
SMF determines that the DNN corresponds to a LADN, then the SMF considers that
the UE is OUT of the LADN service area.
The SMF takes actions for the LADN PDU Session as defined in clause 5.6.5 of
TS 23.501 [2] based on the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication.
For each QoS Flow for which the SMF has received a reference to the fulfilled
Alternative QoS Profile in step 10 of clause 4.9.1.3.2, the SMF notifies the
PCF and the UE as described in TS 23.501 [2].
8a. [Conditional] SMF to T-UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Modification
Request.
If new T-UPF is inserted or an existing intermediate S-UPF is re-allocated,
the SMF shall send N4 Session Modification Request indicating DL AN Tunnel
Info of T-RAN to the T-UPF.
8b. [Conditional] T-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
The T-UPF acknowledges by sending N4 Session Modification Response message to
SMF.
9a. [Conditional] SMF to S-UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Modification
Request.
If UPF is not re-allocated, the SMF shall send N4 Session Modification Request
indicating DL AN Tunnel Info of T-RAN to the S-UPF.
9b. [Conditional] S-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
The S-UPF acknowledges by sending N4 Session Modification Response message to
SMF.
10a. [Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.
For non-roaming or local breakout roaming scenario, the SMF sends N4 Session
Modification Request message to PDU Session Anchor UPF, UPF (PSA), providing
N3 AN Tunnel Info of T-RAN or the DL CN Tunnel Info of T-UPF if a new T-UPF is
inserted or an existing intermediate S-UPF is re-allocated. If redundant
transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU Session, two N3
AN Tunnel Info of T-RAN or two DL CN Tunnel Info of two T-UPFs are provided
and the SMF indicates to the UPF (PSA) one of the AN/CN Tunnel Info is used as
redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session. If the existing intermediate S-UPF
terminating N9 toward the H-UPF (PDU Session Anchor) is re-allocated for the
home routed roaming scenario, the V-SMF invokes an Nsmf_PDUSession_Update
Request (DL CN Tunnel Info) service operation toward the H-SMF.
In the case of the S-UPF acts as a UL CL or BP, the SMF indicates only one of
the PDU Session Anchors to send the \"end marker\" packets. To ensure the
\"end marker\" is the last user plane packet on the old path, the SMF should
modify the path on other PDU Session Anchors before it indicates the PDU
Session Anchor to send the \"end marker\" packets.
If T-UPF is not inserted or an existing intermediate S-UPF is not re-
allocated, step 10a and step 10b are skipped.
10b. [Conditional] UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
The UPF (PSA) sends N4 Session Modification Response message to SMF. In order
to assist the reordering function in the T-RAN, the UPF (PSA) sends one or
more \"end marker\" packets for each N3 tunnel on the old path immediately
after switching the path, the source NG-RAN shall forward the \"end marker\"
packets to the target NG-RAN. At this point, UPF (PSA) starts sending downlink
packets to the T-RAN, via T-UPF if a new T-UPF is inserted or an existing
intermediate S-UPF is re-allocated. In the case of home routed roaming
scenario, the H-SMF responds with the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response service
operation to V-SMF once the H-UPF (PDU Session Anchor) is updated with the UL
Tunnel Info of the T-UPF.
When there are multiple UPFs(PSA), step 10a and step 10b are performed for
each UPFs(PSA).
11\. SMF to T-AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (PDU Session ID).
SMF confirms reception of Handover Complete.
If indirect data forwarding applies, the SMF starts an indirect data
forwarding timer, to be used to release the resource of indirect data
forwarding tunnel.
12\. The UE initiates Mobility Registration Update procedure as described in
clause 4.2.2.2.2.
The target AMF knows that it is a Handover procedure and therefore the target
AMF performs only a subset of the Registration procedure, specifically the
steps 4, 5 and 10 in the Registration procedure for the context transfer
between source AMF and target AMF are skipped.
The target AMF, based on the S-NSSAIs subject to Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization status information from source AMF in step 3
of clause 4.9.1.3.2, may decide to skip step 25 in the Registration procedure
(i.e. NSSAA procedure) or whether to perform it if the status is pending.
13a. [Conditional] SMF to S-UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Release Request.
If there is a source intermediate UPF, the SMF initiates resource release,
after timer in step 6 or indirect data forwarding timer expires, by sending an
N4 Session Release Request (Release Cause) to source UPF. This message is also
used to release the indirect data forwarding resource in S-UPF.
13b. S-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Release Response.
The S-UPF acknowledges with an N4 Session Release Response message to confirm
the release of resources.
In the case of indirect data forwarding, the resource of indirect data
forwarding is also released.
14a. AMF to S-RAN: UE Context Release Command ().
After the timer in step 6a expires, the AMF sends UE Context Release Command.
14b. S-RAN to AMF: UE Context Release Complete ().
The source NG-RAN releases its resources related to the UE and responds with a
UE Context Release Complete () message.
15a. [Conditional] SMF to T-UPF: N4 Session Modification Request.
If indirect forwarding applies and UPF is re-allocated, after timer of
indirect data forwarding expires, the SMF sends N4 Session Modification
Request to T-UPF to release the indirect data forwarding resource.
15b. [Conditional] T-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
The T-UPF acknowledges with an N4 Session Modification Response message to
confirm the release of indirect data forwarding resources.
If the AMF is subscribed to Mobility Event by other NFs, the AMF notifies the
event to the corresponding NFs by invoking the Namf_EventExposure_Notify
service operation as described in clause 4.15.4.2.
Upon reception of the Namf_EventExposure_Notify with an indication that UE is
reachable only for regulatory prioritized service, the SMF deactivates the PDU
Session if the service of the PDU Session is not regulatory prioritized. For
home routed roaming case, the V-SMF triggers the deactivation of the PDU
Session, in addition, the H-SMF refrains from sending downlink signalling if
the signalling is not related to regulatory prioritized service upon receiving
the notification.
##### 4.9.1.3.3a Execution phase for DAPS handover
This procedure applies only if at the end of the Preparation phase it has been
determined that at least one DRB of the UE is subject to a DAPS related
Handover.
Figure 4.9.1.3.3a-1: inter NG-RAN node N2 based DAPS handover, execution phase
1 to 2. Same as step 1 to step 2 in clause 4.9.1.3.3 with the following
difference.
DAPS Response information received in the Target to Source Transparent
Container indicates the DAPS handover is accepted for one or more DRBs.
2a to 2c. The S-RAN sends the Uplink RAN Early Status Transfer message to the
S-AMF as specified in TS 38.413 [10]. For the DRBs not subjecting to DAPS,
steps 2a to 2c in clause 4.9.1.3.3 may be performed.
If there is an AMF change, the S-AMF sends this information to the T-AMF via
the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation and the T-AMF
acknowledges. The S-AMF or, if the AMF is relocated, the T-AMF, sends the
information to the T-RAN via the Downlink RAN Early Status Transfer message,
as specified in TS 38.413 [10].
3\. Same as step 3 in clause 4.9.1.3.3.
4\. Same as step 4 in clause 4.9.1.3.3.
5\. T-RAN to T-AMF: same as step 5 in clause 4.9.1.3.3 with the difference
that the Handover Notify includes a Notify Source NG-RAN node information
which is used to notify the S-RAN that the UE has successfully accessed the
T-RAN.
6a. [Conditional] T-AMF to S-AMF: Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify.
The T-AMF notifies the S-AMF as in step 6a in clause 4.9.1.3.3 with the
difference that Notify Source NG-RAN node information is included.
6b. [Conditional] S-AMF to T-AMF: Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify ACK.
The S-AMF acknowledges by sending the Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify ACK to
the T-AMF as in step 6b in clause 4.9.1.3.3.
7\. S-AMF to S-RAN: Handover Success.
The S-AMF informs the S-RAN node that the UE has successfully accessed the
T-RAN as described in TS 38.413 [10], S-RAN stops the UL data transfer for the
UE.
8a to 8c. The S-RAN initiates step 8a. Step 8a to 8c are the same as step 2a
to 2c in clause 4.9.1.3.3 for the DRB(s) subject to DAPS.
9\. Step 6c to step 15 in clause 4.9.1.3.3 are performed.
#### 4.9.1.4 Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover, Cancel
Prior to sending a Handover Command to the UE, the source NG-RAN node may
attempt cancellation of handover during the handover procedure. The reason for
cancellation may include timer expiration, internal failure within the source
NG-RAN node or UE returned to source cell etc. The handover cancellation is
initiated by sending a Handover Cancel request to the source AMF. This is done
in order to release the resources reserved for the handover in the target
system.
The AMF shall cancel the handover resources as defined in clause 4.11.1.2.3
for case the source RAN is NG-RAN.
### 4.9.2 Handover of a PDU Session procedure between 3GPP and untrusted
non-3GPP access
#### 4.9.2.0 General
The procedures in this clause are used to hand over a PDU Session between 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access. This can be triggered, for example, due to radio
conditions, user interaction, etc. When the UE triggers handover of a PDU
Session between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and the procedure fails due to
e.g. not allowed by policy or AN rejected resource setup, etc. the network
should not release the PDU Session.
#### 4.9.2.1 Handover of a PDU Session procedure from untrusted non-3GPP to
3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout)
Clause 4.9.2.1 specifies how to hand over a UE from a source Untrusted
non-3GPP access to a target 3GPP access and how a UE can handover a PDU
Session from untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access. It is based on the PDU
Session Establishment procedure for 3GPP access as specified in clause 4.3.2.
Figure 4.9.2.1-1: Handover of a PDU Session procedure from untrusted non-3GPP
access to 3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout)
1\. If the UE is not registered via 3GPP access, the UE shall initiate
Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2.
2\. The UE performs a PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU Session
ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified clause 4.3.2.2.1 (PDU Session
Establishment for Non-roaming and Roaming with Local Breakout).
When sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the N1 SM container
and in the N2 SM information, the SMF shall include all QoS information (e.g.
QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS Profile(s) in N2 SM
information) for the QoS Flow(s) that are applicable to the PDU Session for
the target access.
3\. If the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated in non-3GPP access, the
V-SMF executes the release of resources in non-3GPP access by initiating a
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (to send N2 resource release request)
which triggers performing steps 4 to 7 specified in clause 4.12.7, followed by
step 7aa/7b specified in clause 4.3.4.2 in order to release the resources over
the source non-3GPP access. Because the PDU Session shall not be released, the
SMF shall not send the PDU Session Release Command to the UE. Hence, in steps
4 and 7 of clause 4.12.7 as well as in step 7a of clause 4.3.4.2, the messages
do not include the N1 SM container but only the N2 Resource Release Request
(resp. Ack). Since the PDU Session is not to be released, the SMF shall not
execute step 11 of clause 4.3.4.2 and the SM context between the AMF and the
SMF is maintained.
If the User Plane of the PDU Session is deactivated in non-3GPP access, this
step is skipped.
The steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved from to
untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access.
If the UE is moving to the NB-IoT RAT type of 3GPP access, the PDU Session
Establishment request would be rejected by AMF when the UP resources exceeds
the UE\'s maximum number of supported UP resources as described in clause
5.4.5.2.4 of TS 24.501 [25].
#### 4.9.2.2 Handover of a PDU Session procedure from 3GPP to untrusted
non-3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout)
Clause 4.9.2.2 specifies how to hand over a UE from a source 3GPP access to a
target Untrusted non-3GPP access and how a UE can handover a PDU Session from
3GPP access to untrusted non-3GPP access. It is based on the PDU Session
Establishment procedure for non-3GPP access as specified in clause 4.12.5.
Figure 4.9.2.2-1: Handover of a PDU Session from 3GPP access to untrusted
non-3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout)
1\. If the UE is not registered via untrusted non-3GPP access, the UE shall
initiate Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.12.2.
2\. The UE performs PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU Session
ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified in clause 4.12.5.
When sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the N1 SM container
and in the N2 SM information, the SMF shall include all QoS information (e.g.
QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS Profile(s) in N2 SM
information) for the QoS Flow(s) that are applicable to the PDU Session for
the target access.
3\. If the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated in 3GPP access, the SMF
executes the release of resource in 3GPP access by performing step 3b, then
steps 4 to 7a/7b specified in clause 4.3.4.2 (UE or network requested PDU
Session Release for Non-Roaming and Roaming with Local Breakout) in order to
release the resources over the source 3GPP access. Because the PDU Session
shall not be released, the SMF shall not send the PDU Session Release Command
to the UE. Hence, in steps 3b, 4, 6 and 7a of clause 4.3.4.2, messages do not
include the N1 SM container but only the N2 Resource Release Request (resp.
Ack). Since the PDU Session is not to be released, the SMF shall not execute
step 11 of clause 4.3.4.2 and the SM context between the AMF and the SMF is
maintained.
If the User Plane of the PDU Session is deactivated in 3GPP access, this step
is skipped.
The steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved from 3GPP
access to untrusted non-3GPP access.
If the PDU Session is associated with Control Plane Only Indication, the AMF
shall reject the PDU Session establishment request as the Control Plane CIoT
Optimisation feature is not supported over non-3GPP accesses as described in
clause 5.4.5.2.5 of TS 24.501 [25].
#### 4.9.2.3 Handover of a PDU Session procedure from untrusted non-3GPP to
3GPP access (home routed roaming)
##### 4.9.2.3.1 The target AMF is in the PLMN of the N3IWF
Figure 4.9.2.3.1 -1: Handover of a PDU Session procedure from untrusted
non-3GPP access to 3GPP access (home routed roaming)
1\. If the UE is not registered via 3GPP access, the UE shall initiate
Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2. The NG-RAN selects the
same AMF as the one used via non-3GPP access.
2\. The UE performs a PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU Session
ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified clause 4.3.2.2.2 (PDU Session
Establishment for Home Routed Roaming). The AMF selects the same V-SMF as the
one used via non-3GPP access.
In the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response the H-SMF shall include all QoS
information for the QoS Flow(s) applicable to the PDU Session for the target
access so that when sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the
N1 SM container and in the N2 SM information, the V-SMF can include all QoS
information (e.g. QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS Profile(s) in
N2 SM information) for the QoS Flow(s) acceptable according to VPLMN policies.
In case of Handover for a PDU Session eligible to EPS Interworking, the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response should also contain: EPS bearer context(s),
linked EBI.
3\. If the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated in non-3GPP access, the
V-SMF executes the release of resource in non-3GPP access by initiating a
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (to send N2 resource release request)
which triggers performing steps 4 to 7 specified in clause 4.12.7, followed by
step 7a/7b specified in clause 4.3.4.2 in order to release the resources over
the source non-3GPP access. Because the PDU Session shall not be released, the
SMF shall not send the PDU Session Release Command to the UE. Hence, in steps
4 and 7 of clause 4.12.7 as well as in step 7a of clause 4.3.4.2, the messages
do not include the N1 SM container but only the N2 Resource Release Request
(resp. Ack). Since the PDU Session is not to be released, the SMF shall not
execute step 11 of clause 4.3.4.2 and the SM context between the AMF and the
SMF is maintained.
If the User Plane of the PDU Session is deactivated in non-3GPP access, this
step is skipped.
The steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved from to
untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access.
##### 4.9.2.3.2 The target AMF is not in the PLMN of the N3IWF (i.e. N3IWF in
HPLMN)
Figure 4.9.2.3.2-1: Handover of a PDU Session procedure from untrusted
non-3GPP access with N3IWF in the HPLMN to 3GPP access (home routed roaming)
1\. If the UE is not registered via 3GPP access, the UE shall initiate
Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2. This includes the
retrieval of the SMF-IDs corresponding to each of the PDU Sessions.
2\. The UE performs a PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU Session
ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified clause 4.3.2.2.2 (PDU Session
Establishment for Home Routed Roaming).
In the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response the H-SMF shall include all QoS
information for the QoS Flow(s) applicable to the PDU Session for the target
access so that when sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the
N1 SM container and in the N2 SM information, the V-SMF can include all QoS
information (e.g. QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS Profile(s) in
N2 SM information) for the QoS Flow(s) acceptable according to VPLMN policies.
3\. The H-SMF executes the release of resources in non-3GPP AN by performing
steps 3-12 specified in clause 4.12.7 with the following exceptions:
\- the H-SMF interfaces the source AMF (in the home PLMN). The H-SMF shall not
send the N1 SM Container (PDU Session Release Command) to the UE;
\- The Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Delete service operation to PCF shall not be
performed.
\- Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify service operation invoked by the H-SMF
to the source AMF indicates the PDU Session is moved to different access.
The steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved from to
untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access.
#### 4.9.2.4 Handover of a PDU Session procedure from 3GPP to untrusted
non-3GPP access (home routed roaming)
##### 4.9.2.4.1 The selected N3IWF is in the registered PLMN

initiate Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.12.2. The N3IWF selects
the same AMF as the one used via 3GPP access.
2\. The UE performs PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU Session
ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified in clause 4.12.5. The AMF
selects the same V-SMF as the one used via 3GPP access.
In the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response the H-SMF shall include all QoS
information for the QoS Flow(s) applicable to the PDU Session for the target
access so that when sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the
N1 SM container and in the N2 SM information, the V-SMF can include all QoS
information (e.g. QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS Profile(s) in
N2 SM information) for the QoS Flow(s) acceptable according to VPLMN policies.
3\. If the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated in 3GPP access, the
V-SMF executes the release of resources in 3GPP access by performing step 5c
to 10 specified in clause 4.3.4.3 (UE or network requested PDU Session Release
for Home Routed Roaming) in order to release the resources over the source
3GPP access. Because the PDU Session shall not be released, the SMF shall not
send the PDU Session Release Command to the UE. Hence, in steps 5c, 6, 8 and 9
of clause 4.3.4.3, the messages do not include the N1 SM container but only
the N2 Resource Release Request (resp. Ack). Since the PDU Session is not to
be released, the SMF shall not execute step 11 of clause 4.3.4.2 and the SM
context between the AMF and the SMF is maintained.
If the User Plane of the PDU Session is deactivated in 3GPP access, this step
is skipped.
The steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved from 3GPP
access to untrusted non-3GPP access.
##### 4.9.2.4.2 The UE is roaming and the selected N3IWF is in the home PLMN
Figure 4.9.2.4.2-1: Handover of a PDU Session procedure from 3GPP access to
untrusted non-3GPP access with N3IWF in the HPLMN (home routed roaming)
1\. If the UE is not registered via untrusted non-3GPP access, the UE shall
initiate Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.12.2. This includes the
retrieval of the SMF-IDs corresponding to each of the PDU Sessions.
2\. The UE performs PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU Session
ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified in clause 4.12.5.
In the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response the H-SMF shall include all QoS
information for the QoS Flow(s) applicable to the PDU Session for the target
access so that when sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the
N1 SM container and in the N2 SM information, the V-SMF can include all QoS
information (e.g. QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS Profile(s) in
N2 SM information) for the QoS Flow(s) acceptable according to VPLMN policies.
3\. The H-SMF executes the release of resources in source V-SMF, V-UPF, V-AMF
and 3GPP AN by performing steps 3a, 5c to 16b specified in clause 4.3.4.3 with
the following exceptions:
\- the H-SMF indicates in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request that the UE shall
not be notified. This shall result in the V-SMF not sending the N1 Container
(PDU Session Release Command) to the UE;
\- Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify service operation invoked by H-SMF to V-SMF
indicates PDU Session is moved to different access;
\- Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify service operation invoked by the V-SMF
to the AMF indicates the PDU Session is moved to different access;
\- The Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Delete service operation to PCF shall not be
performed.
The steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved from 3GPP
access to untrusted non-3GPP access.
### 4.9.3 Handover of a PDU Session procedure between 3GPP and trusted
non-3GPP access
#### 4.9.3.0 General
The handover of a PDU Session between 3GPP access and trusted non-3GPP access
shall be supported as specified in clause 4.9.2 for all types of handover of a
PDU Session between 3GPP access and untrusted non-3GPP access, with the
following modifications and clarifications:
\- The untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access
point (TNAP).
\- The N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.
\- The registration via untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by the
registration via trusted non-3GPP access as specified in clause 4.12a.2.2.
\- A PDU Session is activated over trusted non-3GPP access as specified in
clause 4.12a.5.
## 4.10 NG-RAN Location reporting procedures
This procedure is used by an AMF to request the NG-RAN to report where the UE
is currently located when the target UE is in CM-CONNECTED state. The need for
the NG-RAN to continue reporting ceases when the UE transitions to CM-IDLE or
the AMF sends cancel indication to NG-RAN. This procedure may be used for
services that require accurate cell identification (e.g. emergency services,
lawful intercept, charging), or for subscription to the service by other NFs.
When Dual Connectivity is activated, PSCell information is only reported if
requested by the AMF.
Figure 4.10-1: NG-RAN Location Reporting Procedure
1\. AMF to NG-RAN: Location Reporting Control (Reporting Type, Location
Reporting Level, (Area Of Interest, Request Reference ID)).
The AMF sends a Location Reporting Control message to the NG-RAN. The Location
Reporting Control message shall identify the UE for which reports are
requested and shall include Reporting Type and Location Reporting Level. The
Location Reporting Control message may also include Area Of Interest and
Request Reference ID. Location Reporting Level could be TAI+ Cell Identity.
Reporting Type indicates whether the message is intended to trigger a single
standalone report about the current Cell Identity serving the UE or start the
NG-RAN to report whenever the UE changes cell, or ask the NG-RAN to report
whenever the UE moves out or into the Area Of Interest. If the Reporting Type
indicates to report whenever the UE changes cell and if PScell reporting is
requested and Dual Connectivity is in use, the Master RAN node shall also
report to the AMF whenever the PSCell changes. If the Reporting Type indicates
to start the NG-RAN to report when UE moves out of or into the Area Of
Interest, the AMF also provides the requested Area Of Interest information in
the Location Reporting Control message. The AMF may include a Request
Reference ID in the Location Report Control message to identify the request of
reporting for an Area Of Interest. If multiple Areas Of Interest are included
in the message, the Request Reference ID identifies each Area of Interest.
NOTE 1: Requesting reports whenever the UE changes cell can increase
signalling load on multiple interfaces. Requesting reports for all changes in
PSCell ID can further increase signalling load. Hence it is recommended that
any such reporting is only applied for a limited number of subscribers,
2\. NG-RAN to AMF: Location Report (UE Location, UE Presence in Area Of
Interest, Request Reference ID, Timestamp).
The NG-RAN sends a Location Report message informing the AMF about the
location of the UE which shall be represented as the requested Location
Reporting Level. If PSCell reporting is requested and Dual Connectivity is
activated, then the Master NG-RAN node shall also include the PSCell ID.
When UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, if NG-RAN has received
Location Reporting Control message from AMF with the Reporting Type indicating
single stand-alone report, the NG-RAN shall perform NG-RAN paging before
reporting the location to the AMF. The NG-RAN should send the Location Report
promptly and shall not wait to attempt to create a Dual Connectivity
configuration. However, if PSCell reporting is requested and the PSCell ID is
known to the Master RAN node, then it shall be included in the Location
Report.
When UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, if NG-RAN has received
Location Reporting Control message from AMF with the Reporting Type indicating
continuous reporting whenever the UE changes cell, the NG-RAN shall send a
Location Report message to the AMF including the UE\'s last known location
with time stamp. If the UE was using Dual Connectivity immediately before
entering CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state and PSCell reporting is
requested, then the Location Report shall also include the PSCell ID.
When UE is in CM-CONNECTED, if NG-RAN has received Location Reporting Control
message from AMF with the Reporting Type of Area Of Interest based reporting,
the NG-RAN shall track the UE presence in Area Of Interest and send a Location
Report message to AMF including the UE Presence in the Area Of Interest (i.e.
IN, OUT, or UNKNOWN) as described in clause D.2 and the UE\'s current location
(including the PSCell ID if PSCell reporting is requested and Dual
Connectivity is activated) when the UE is in RRC Connected state, or, when the
UE is in RRC Inactive state, the UE\'s last known location (including the
PSCell ID if PSCell reporting is requested and the UE was using Dual
Connectivity immediately before entering CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state)
with time stamp if the NG-RAN perceives that the UE presence in the Area Of
Interest is different from the last one reported. When the NG-RAN detects that
the UE has moved out of or into multiple areas of interest, it sends multiple
pairs of UE Presence in the Area Of Interest and the Request Reference ID in
one Location Report message to AMF. If UE transitions from RRC Inactive state
to RRC Connected state, NG-RAN shall check the latest location (including the
PSCell ID if PSCell reporting is requested and Dual Connectivity is activated)
of UE and follow the rules when UE is in RRC Connected.
The AMF may receive Location Report even if the UE presence in Area Of
Interest is not changed. The AMF stores the latest received PSCell ID with its
associated timestamp. The AMF stores the latest received PSCell ID with its
associated timestamp, when available.
3\. AMF to NG-RAN: Cancel Location Report (Reporting Type, Request Reference
ID).
The AMF can send a Cancel Location Reporting message to inform the NG-RAN that
it should terminate the location reporting for a given UE corresponding to the
Reporting Type or the location reporting for Area Of Interest indicated by
Request Reference ID. This message is needed when the reporting type was
requested for continuously reporting or for the Area Of Interest. The AMF may
include the Request Reference ID which indicates the requested Location
Reporting Control for the Area Of Interest, so that the NG-RAN should
terminate the location reporting for the Area Of Interest.
NOTE 2: Location reporting related information of the source NG-RAN node is
transferred to the target NG-RAN node during Xn handover.
In this release the location reporting procedure is applicable only to 3GPP
access.
## 4.11 System interworking procedures with EPC
### 4.11.0 General
Clause 4.11 includes the following:
\- Procedures for interworking with EPS based on N26 interface (clause 4.11.1)
and interworking without N26 interface (clause 4.11.2);
\- Handover procedures between EPS and 5GC-N3IWF (clause 4.11.3), handover
procedures between EPS and 5GC-TNGF (clause 4.11.3a) and handover procedures
between EPC/ePDG and 5GS (clause 4.11.4);
\- Impact to 5GC procedure due to interworking with EPC (clause 4.11.5);
\- Interworking for common network exposure (clause 4.11.6).
In clause 4.11, UEs are assumed to support both 5GC NAS and EPC NAS unless
explicitly stated otherwise.
### 4.11.0a Impacts to EPS Procedures
#### 4.11.0a.1 General
This clause captures changes to procedures in TS 23.401 [13] that are common
to interworking based on N26 and interworking without N26.
#### 4.11.0a.2 Interaction with PCC
When interworking with 5GS is supported and a \"SMF+PGW-C\" is selected for a
PDN connection, policy interactions between PDN GW and PCRF specified in TS
23.401 [13] are replaced by equivalent interactions between SMF+PGW-C and PCF
as follows:
\- IP-CAN Session Establishment procedure defined in TS 23.203 [24] is
replaced by SM Policy Association Establishment Procedure as described in
clause 4.16.4.The SMF+PGW-C includes the information elements received in
Create Session Request message into the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create Service as
follows: the SUPI contains the IMSI, the DNN contains the APN, the PEI
contains either the IMEISV or IMEI, the Session AMBR contains the APN-AMBR and
the default QoS information that contains the default EPS bearer QoS, note
that QCI values are mapped into 5QI values. The SMF+PGW-C may receive PCC
Rules and PDU Session Policy Information, 5G QoS information in the PCC Rule
and in PDU Session Policy Information are mapped into EPS QoS information as
defined in clause 4.11.1.1 and Annex C.
\- (PCEF-initiated) IP-CAN Session Modification procedure defined in TS 23.203
[24] is replaced by SM Policy Association Modification procedure as described
in clause 4.16.5.1.
\- The SMF+PGW-C includes the information elements received in Modify Bearer
Request or Modify Bearer Command message into the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update
Service with the following modifications, the subscribed Session AMBR includes
the subscribed APN-AMBR and subscribed default QoS information includes the
default EPS bearer QoS, note that QCI values are mapped into 5QI values. The
SMF+PGW-C includes the stored SUPI. The SMF+PGW-C may receive PCC Rules and
PDU Session Policy Information, 5G QoS information in the PCC Rule and in PDU
Session Policy Information are mapped into EPS QoS information as defined in
clause 4.11.1.1 and Annex C.
\- The SMF+PGW-C includes the information elements received in Delete Bearer
Command message into the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update Service with the
following modifications, The SMF+PGW-C includes the stored SUPI.
\- (PCRF-initiated) IP-CAN Session Modification procedure defined in TS 23.203
[24] is replaced by SM Policy Association Modification procedure as described
in clause 4.16.5.2. The SMF+PGW-C may receive PCC Rules and PDU Session Policy
Information, 5G QoS information in the PCC Rule and in PDU Session Policy
Information are mapped into EPS QoS information as defined in clause 4.11.1.1
and Annex C.
\- IP-CAN Session Termination procedure defined in TS 23.203 [24] is replaced
by SM Policy Association Termination procedure as described in clause 4.16.6.
The SMF+PGW-C includes the information elements received in Delete Session
Request message by the SMF+PGW-C into the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Delete Service.
The SMF+PGW-C includes the stored SUPI.
#### 4.11.0a.3 Mobility Restrictions
The UE\'s subscription may include access restriction for NR in 5GS and
restriction for Core Network Type (5GC). If so, the HSS provides these
restrictions to the MME. The MME includes these restrictions in the Handover
Restriction List to the E-UTRAN. The MME and E-UTRAN use these restrictions to
determine if mobility of the UE to 5GS or NR connected to 5GS should be
permitted.
#### 4.11.0a.4 PGW Selection
When the UE requests to establish a non-emergency PDN connection to an APN,
the MME may use the UE\'s support for 5GC NAS indication included in the UE
Network Capability and/or UE\'s subscription from HSS that includes UE\'s
mobility restriction parameters related to 5GS and/or indication of support
for interworking with 5GS for this APN to determine if SMF+PGW-C or a
standalone PGW-C should be selected. If both PGW-C and SMF+PGW-C is available,
then MME may select SMF+PGW-C when UE\'s subscription from HSS indicate
support for interworking with 5GS for the APN.
NOTE: If restriction for Core Network Type indicates that the UE can access to
5GC, it implies that the UE has 5G subscription data.
When the UE performs emergency attach or requests to establish an emergency
PDN connection, the MME may use the UE\'s support for 5GC NAS indication
included in the UE Network Capability and/or local configuration to determine
if an emergency SMF+PGW-C or a standalone emergency PGW-C should be selected.
An emergency SMF+PGW-C needs to be configured in Emergency Configuration Data
in the MME if it is to be selected.
To enable a differentiation of the emergency gateway based on UEÂ´s support of
5GC NAS, the Emergency Configuration Data in the MME defined in TS 23.401 [26]
is extended with the IE listed in Table 4.11.0a.4-1.
Table 4.11.0a.4-1: MME Emergency Configuration Data Extensions
Field Description
* * *
Emergency SMF+PGW-C identity The statically configured identity of a combined
SMF+PGW-C used for emergency APN. The SMF+PGW-C identity may be either an FQDN
or an IP address. (NOTE) NOTE: The FQDN always resolves to one SMF+PGW-C.
#### 4.11.0a.5 PDN Connection Establishment
During establishment of non-emergency PDN connection in the EPC, the UE and
the SMF+PGW-C exchange information via PCO as described in clause 5.15.7 of TS
23.501 [2]. If the SMF+PGW-C supports more than one S-NSSAI and the APN is
valid for more than one S-NSSAI, before the SMF+PGW-C provides an S-NSSAI to
the UE, the SMF+PGW-C should check such that the selected S-NSSAI is among the
UE\'s subscribed S-NSSAIs and that the S-NSSAI is not subject to Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, by retrieving the Subscribed
S-NSSAI from UDM using the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation (the SMF+PGW-C
discovers and selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2]). If
the SMF+PGW-C is in a VPLMN, the SMF+PGW-C uses the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get
service operation to retrieve a mapping of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs to Serving
PLMN S-NSSAI values. If the S-NSSAIs supported by the SMF+PGW-C are all
subject to NSSAA, then the SMF+PGW-C should reject the PDN connection
establishment. The SMF+PGW-C uses the Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation to
subscribe the change of the Session Management Subscription data. If the
SMF+PGW-C is notified from UDM with subscription data change, the SMF+ PGW-C
takes actions for the PDN connection as described in clause 5.17.2.1 of TS
23.501 [2].
During establishment of non-emergency PDN connection in the EPC, if SMF+PGW-C
is selected for a UE that has 5GS subscription but does not support 5GC NAS
and is accessing via EPC/E-UTRAN and if the SMF+PGW-C supports more than one
S-NSSAI and the APN is valid for more than one S-NSSAI, the SMF+PGW-C+PGW-C
may proceed as specified in first paragraph of this clause or select any
S-NSSAI associated with the APN of the PDN connection. The SMF+PGW-C shall not
provide any 5GS related parameters to the UE.
NOTE: The SMF+PGW-C knows that the UE does not support 5GS NAS if the UE does
not provide PDU Session ID in PCO (see clause 5.15.7 of TS 23.501 [2]).
During establishment of emergency PDN connection:
\- The SMF+PGW-C is to be derived from the emergency APN or to be statically
configured in the Emergency Configuration Data in MME.
\- 5GC interworking support with N26 or without N26 is determined based on
UE\'s 5G NAS capability and local configuration (in the Emergency
Configuration Data in MME).
\- The S-NSSAI configured for the emergency APN in SMF+PGW-C is not sent to
the UE by the SMF+PGW-C. One S-NSSAI is configured for the emergency APN.
During establishment of non-emergency PDN connection and emergency PDN
connection, if SMF+PGW-C is selected for a UE that does not support 5GC NAS,
the SMF+PGW-C creates unique PDU Session ID for each PDN connection of the UE.
The unique PDU Session ID can be created based on the EPS Bearer IDs assigned
by the MME for the PDN Connections associated with the UE and not be in the
range of PDU Session ID values that can be created by a 5GC NAS capable UE.
#### 4.11.0a.6 Network Configuration
To avoid the need for identifier coordination between MMEs, AMFs and SGSNs,
the MME provides to the eNB its served GUMMEIs by separating the values
between native MME GUMMEI values, values mapped from AMF and values mapped
from SGSN.
#### 4.11.0a.7 Interactions with DN-AAA Server
In this version of the specification, secondary authentication with a DN-AAA
server, as specified in clause 4.3.2.3, is not supported when the UE is in
EPS. Secondary authorization (without authentication of the UE) with a DN-AAA
server, as specified in clause 4.3.2.3, is supported when the UE is in EPS.
NOTE 1: This implies that when data connectivity to the DN is initiated as a
PDU session over 5GC it can be subject to EAP based secondary authentication
mechanism (see TS 33.501 [15]) whereas, when data connectivity to the same DN
is initiated as a PDN connection over EPC it cannot be subject to EAP based
secondary authentication mechanism. This discrepancy occurs regardless of
whether the data connection is later on moved between EPC and 5GC.
NOTE 2: Secondary authorization without authentication means no signalling
exchange with the UE.
If secondary authentication and authorization has been performed for the PDU
Session while the UE was in 5GS and the UE has moved to EPS, the following
applies:
\- DN-AAA re-authorization (without re-authentication signalling) can be
performed even when the UE is in EPS, e.g. to provide new parameters from the
DN-AAA Server to SMF+PGW-C.
\- Re-authentication cannot be performed while the UE is in EPS because there
is no support of the related signalling in EPS. In case the SMF+PGW-C receives
a re-authentication request from the DN-AAA, the SMF+PGW-C informs the DN-AAA
Server that the UE is not available for re-authentication at the moment. The
SMF+PGW-C should not initiate PDN connection release at this point: the DN-AAA
decides the actions to take, based on the reply from SMF+PGW-C and local
policy which may also trigger a DN-AAA server request to release the PDU
Session/PDN connection of the UE.
### 4.11.1 N26 based Interworking Procedures
#### 4.11.1.1 General
N26 interface is used to provide seamless session continuity for single
registration mode UE.
Interworking between EPS and 5GS is supported with IP address preservation by
assuming SSC mode 1.
When the UE is served by the 5GC, during PDU Session establishment and GBR QoS
Flow establishment, SMF+PGW-C performs EPS QoS mappings, from the 5G QoS
parameters obtained from the PCF and allocates TFT with the PCC rules obtained
from the PCF if PCC is deployed. Otherwise, EPS QoS mappings and TFT
allocation are mapped by the SMF+PGW-C locally. The PGW+SMF ignores 5G QoS
parameters that are not applicable to EPC (e.g. QoS Notification control). If
a TFT is to be allocated for a downlink unidirectional EPS bearer mapped from
a downlink only QoS Flow, the SMF+PGW-C shall allocate a TFT packet filter
that effectively disallows any useful uplink packet as specified in TS 23.401
[13]. EPS Bearer IDs are allocated by the serving AMF requested by the SMF if
the SMF determines that EPS Bearer IDs need to be assigned to the QoS Flows.
For each PDU Session, EPS bearer IDs are allocated to the default EPS bearer
and dedicated bearers. The SMF shall be able to determine the QoS flows that
require EPS Bearer IDs, based on the QoS profile and operator policies.
NOTE 1: Based on operator policies, an SMF can map all non-GBR QoS flows to
default EPS bearer in which case it requests only one EBI for all the non-GBR
QoS flows. Alternatively, an SMF can also map one non-GBR QoS flow to one
dedicated EPS bearer in which case it requests a dedicated EBI for non-GBR QoS
flow that should be mapped to dedicated EPS bearer. In between these two
extreme cases, the SMF can also map more than one (but not all) non-GBR QoS
Flow to the same EPS bearer (either default EPS bearer or dedicated EPS
bearer).
NOTE 2: To reduce the probability of AMF revoking the EBI corresponding to the
QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, ARP priority level of dedicated
QoS Flows can be set to higher value than that of the QoS Flow associated with
the default QoS rule within the same PDU Session.
When a new QoS Flow needs to be mapped to an EPS Bearer ID that has already
been assigned for an existing QoS Flow, the SMF includes the already assigned
EPS Bearer ID in the QoS Flow description sent to the UE.
For Ethernet and Unstructured PDU Session Types, only EPS Bearer ID for the
default EPS Bearer is allocated. The EPS Bearer IDs for these EPS bearers are
provided to the SMF+PGW-C by the AMF and are provided to the UE and NG-RAN by
the SMF+PGW-C using N1 SM NAS message and N2 SM message. The UE is also
provided with the mapped QoS parameters. The UE and the SMF+PGW-C store the
association between the QoS Flow and the corresponding EBI and the EPS QoS
parameters. When the QoS Flow is deleted e.g. due to PDU Session status
synchronization or PDU Session Modification, the UE and the SMF+PGW-C delete
any possibly existing EPS QoS parameters associated with the deleted QoS Flow.
In this release, for a PDU Session for a LADN or for Multi-homed IPv6 PDU
Session, the SMF doesn\'t allocate any EBI or mapped QoS parameters.
For PDU Sessions with UP integrity protection of UP Security Enforcement
Information set to Required, the SMF does not allocate any EBI or mapped QoS
parameters.
When the UE is served by the EPC, during PDN connection establishment, the UE
allocates the PDU Session ID and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C via PCO. During PDN
Connection establishment and dedicated bearer establishment, SMF+PGW-C
performs EPS QoS mappings, from the 5G QoS parameters obtained from the PCF
and allocates TFT with the PCC rules obtained from the PCF if PCC is deployed.
Otherwise, EPS QoS mappings and TFT allocation are mapped by the SMF+PGW-C
locally. Other 5G QoS parameters corresponding to the PDN connection, e.g.
Session AMBR and QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the
QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s), are sent to UE in PCO. The UE and
the SMF+PGW-C store the association between the EPS Context and the PDU
Session Context to use it in the case of handover from EPS to 5GS. During the
EPS bearer establishment/modification procedure, QoS rules corresponding to
the related EPS bearers are allocated and sent to UE in PCO. The 5G QoS
parameters are stored in the UE and are to be used when the UE is handed over
from EPS to the 5GS. The 5G QoS parameters may be provided to SMF+PGW-C by the
PCF, if PCC is deployed. On mobility from EPS to 5GS, the UE sets the SSC mode
of the mapped PDU Session to SSC mode 1. The UE and the SMF+PGW-C store the
association between the EPS bearer and the corresponding 5G QoS Rules and QoS
Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the
QoS rule(s). When the EPS bearer is deleted e.g. due to EPS bearer status
synchronization or bearer deactivation, the UE and the SMF+PGW-C delete any
possibly existing 5G QoS Rule(s) and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if any for
the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) associated with the deleted
EPS bearer.
In the roaming case, if the VPLMN supports interworking with N26, the UE shall
operate in Single Registration mode.
During the 5GS-EPS handover, indirect forwarding may apply for the downlink
data forwarding performed as part of the handover. From its configuration data
the AMF knows whether indirect forwarding applies and it requests to allocate
downlink data forwarding paths on UPFs for indirect forwarding. From its
configuration data the MME knows whether indirect forwarding applies and it
requests to allocate downlink data forwarding paths on Serving GWs for
indirect forwarding. It is configured on AMF and MME whether indirect downlink
data forwarding does not apply, applies always or applies only for inter PLMN
inter RAT handovers.
During the 5GS-EPS handover, direct forwarding may apply for the downlink data
forwarding performed as part of the handover. From its configuration data the
source RAN node knows whether direct forwarding applies and indicates to
source CN the direct data forwarding is available.
During 5GS-EPS handover, on the target side, the CN informs the target RAN
node whether data forwarding is possible or not.
During interworking from EPS to 5GS, as the SMF+PGW-C may have different IP
addresses when being accessed over S5/S8 and N11/N16 respectively, the AMF
shall discover the SMF instance by an NF/NF service discovery procedure using
the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface received from the MME as a query parameter.
This is required for both non-roaming and roaming with local breakout, as well
as for home routed roaming.
NOTE 3: As the AMF is not aware of the S-NSSAI assigned for the PDN
Connection, the NF/NF service discovery used to find the SMF instance can use
PLMN level NRF.
During interworking from 5GS to EPS, as a PDU Session may be released while
the UE is served by EPS, if Small Data Rate Control is used the SMF+PGW-C
obtains the Small Data Rate Control Status from the PGW-U+UPF in the N4
Session Modification procedure or from the SCEF+NEF and passes the Small Data
Rate Control Status in the PDU Session Context Response to the AMF, for the
AMF to store. The time to store the Small Data Rate Control Statuses is
implementation specific. If the UE and PGW-U+UPF / SCEF+NEF have stored APN
Rate Control parameters and optionally APN Rate Control Status they are only
applied when the UE is served by EPS.
During interworking from EPS to 5GS the UE and PGW-U+UPF / SCEF+NEF store the
APN Rate Control parameters and APN Rate Control Status while the UE is served
by 5GS, so they can be used if the UE moves back to EPS.
At EPS to 5GS mobility
\- the UE considers as released the PDN connections that were established over
EPS and for which the UE has not received mapped 5GS QoS parameters from the
network.
\- The MME does not transfer to 5GS a PDN connection that does not support 5GS
interworking, e.g. PDN connection was established on a standalone PGW, or 5GS
interworking is restricted by subscription data.
#### 4.11.1.2 Handover procedures
##### 4.11.1.2.1 5GS to EPS handover using N26 interface
Figure 4.11.1.2.1-1 describes the handover procedure from 5GS to EPS when N26
is supported.
In the case of handover to a shared EPS network, the source NG-RAN determines
a PLMN to be used in the target network as specified by TS 23.501 [2]. The
source NG-RAN shall indicate the selected PLMN ID to be used in the target
network to the AMF as part of the TAI sent in the HO Required message.
In the case of handover from a shared NG-RAN, the AMF may provide the MME with
an indication that the 5GS PLMN is a preferred PLMN at later change of the UE
to a 5GS shared networks.
During the handover procedure, as specified in clause 4.9.1.3.1, the source
AMF shall reject any SMF+PGW-C initiated N2 request received since handover
procedure started and shall include an indication that the request has been
temporarily rejected due to handover procedure in progress.
Upon reception of a rejection for an SMF+PGW-C initiated N2 request(s) with an
indication that the request has been temporarily rejected due to handover
procedure in progress, the SMF+PGW-C behaves as specified in TS 23.401 [13].
Figure 4.11.1.2.1-1: 5GS to EPS handover for single-registration mode with N26
interface
The procedure involves a handover to EPC and setup of default EPS bearer and
dedicated bearers for QoS Flows that have EBI assigned, in EPC in steps 1-16
and re-activation, if required, of dedicated EPS bearers for non-GBR QoS Flows
that have no EBI assigned, in step 19. This procedure can be triggered, for
example, due to new radio conditions, load balancing or in the presence of QoS
Flow for normal voice or IMS emergency voice, the source NG-RAN node may
trigger handover to EPC.
For Ethernet and Unstructured PDU Session Types, the PDN Type Ethernet and
non-IP respectively are used, when supported, in EPS.
When EPS supports PDN Type non-IP but not PDN type Ethernet, PDN type non-IP
is used also for Ethernet PDU sessions. The SMF shall also set the PDN Type of
the EPS Bearer Context to non-IP in this case. After the handover to EPS, the
PDN Connection will have PDN Type non-IP, but it shall be locally associated
in UE and SMF to PDU Session Type Ethernet or Unstructured respectively.
In the roaming home routed case, the SMF+PGW-C always provides the EPS Bearer
ID and the mapped QoS parameters to UE. The V-SMF caches the EPS Bearer ID and
the mapped QoS parameters obtained from H-SMF for this PDU session. This also
applies in the case that the HPLMN operates the interworking procedure without
N26.
NOTE 1: The IP address preservation cannot be supported, if SMF+PGW-C in the
HPLMN doesn\'t provide the mapped QoS parameters.
1\. NG-RAN decides that the UE should be handed over to the E-UTRAN. If NG-RAN
is configured to perform Inter RAT mobility due to IMS voice fallback
triggered by QoS flow setup and request to setup QoS flow for IMS voice was
received, NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the QoS flow establishment
because of mobility due to fallback for IMS voice via N2 SM information and
triggers handover to E-UTRAN. The NG-RAN sends a Handover Required (Target eNB
ID, Direct Forwarding Path Availability, Source to Target Transparent
Container, inter system handover indication) message to the AMF. NG-RAN
indicates bearers corresponding to the 5G QoS Flows for data forwarding in
Source to Target Transparent Container.
If the source NG RAN and target E-UTRAN support RACS as defined in TS 23.501
[2], the Source to Target transparent container need not carry the UE radio
access capabilities (instead the UE Radio Capability ID is supplied from the
CN to the target E-UTRAN). However, if the source NG-RAN has knowledge that
the target E-UTRAN might not have a local copy of the Radio Capability
corresponding to the UE Radio Capability ID (i.e. because the source NG-RAN
had itself to retrieve the UE\'s Radio Capability from the AMF) then the
source NG-RAN may also send some (or all) of the UE\'s Radio Capability to the
target E-UTRAN (the size limit based on configuration). In the case of inter-
PLMN handover, when the source NG-RAN and target E-UTRAN support RACS as
defined in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.401 [13] and the source NG-RAN determines
that the target PLMN does not support the UE Radio Capability ID assigned by
the source PLMN based on local configuration, then the source NG-RAN includes
the UE radio access capabilities in the Source to Target transparent
container.
Direct Forwarding Path Availability indicates whether direct forwarding is
available from the NG-RAN to the E-UTRAN. This indication from NG-RAN can be
based on e.g. the presence of IP connectivity and security association(s)
between the NG-RAN and the E-UTRAN.
If the handover is triggered due to Emergency fallback, the NG-RAN may forward
the Emergency indication to the target eNB in the Source to Target Transparent
Container and the target eNB allocates radio bearer resources taking received
indication into account.
2a-2c. The AMF determines from the \'Target eNB Identifier\' IE that the type
of handover is Handover to E-UTRAN. The AMF selects an MME as described in
clause 4.3.8.3 of TS 23.401 [13].
The AMF determines for a PDU Session whether to retrieve context including
mapped UE EPS PDN Connection from the V-SMF (in the case of HR roaming) or the
SMF+PGW-C (in the case of non roaming or LBO roaming) as follows:
\- If the AMF determines that one or more of the EBI(s) can be transferred,
the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest to the V-SMF or SMF+PGW-C and
includes in the message EBI value(s) if any that cannot be transferred.
\- The EBI values(s) that cannot be transferred is determined by the AMF if
the target MME does not support 15 EPS bearers, i.e. the AMF determines the
EBI values in range 1-4 as not to be transferred to EPS and if there are still
more than 8 EBI values associated with PDU Sessions, the AMF then determines
EBI value(s) not to be transferred to EPS based on S-NSSAI and ARP as
specified in clause 5.17.2.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
\- The AMF does not retrieve the context for a PDU Session that cannot be
transferred to EPS due to no EBI allocated, or allocated EBIs not
transferrable, or combination of the two.
When the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest the AMF provides also the
target MME capability to the V-SMF or the SMF+PGW-C to allow it to determine
whether to include EPS Bearer context for Ethernet PDN Type or non-IP PDN Type
or not.
When Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request is received in the V-SMF or the
SMF+PGW-C, the V-SMF or the SMF+PGW-C provides context that includes the
mapped EPS PDN Connection as follows:
\- If there is EBI list not to be transferred and the EBI value of the QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS Rule is included in that list, the V-SMF
or the SMF+PGW-C shall not return the PDN Connection context (which implies
the whole PDU Session is not transferred to EPS), otherwise if the EBI value
of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS Rule is not included in EBI
list not to be transferred, the V-SMF or PGW C+SMF shall not provide the EPS
bearer context(s) mapped from QoS Flow(s) associated with the EBI list not to
be transferred.
\- For PDU Sessions with PDU Session Type Ethernet, if the UE and target MME
supports Ethernet PDN type, the V-SMF or the PGW C+SMF provides Context for
Ethernet PDN Type, otherwise if the target MME does not support Ethernet Type
but support non-IP Type, the V-SMF or the PGW C+SMF provides Context for non-
IP PDN Type. For PDU Sessions with PDU Session Type Unstructured, the V-SMF or
the SMF+PGW-C provides Context for non-IP PDN Type.
In the case of non roaming or LBO roaming, when Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest
is received in PGW C+SMF, if the SMF+PGW-C determines that EPS Bearer Context
can be transferred to EPS and the CN Tunnel Info for EPS bearer(s) have not
been allocated before, the SMF+PGW-C sends N4 Session modification to the
PGW-U+UPF to establish the CN tunnel for each EPS bearer and provides EPS
Bearer Contexts to AMF, as described in step 8 of clause 4.11.1.4.1. The
PGW-U+UPF is ready to receive the uplink packet from E-UTRAN.
This step is performed with all the SMF+PGW-Cs corresponding to PDU Sessions
of the UE which are associated with 3GPP access and have at leaset one EBI(s)
determined to be transferred to EPS.
NOTE 2: The AMF knows the MME capability to support 15 EPS bearers, Ethernet
PDN type and/or non-IP PDN type or not through local configuration.
In home routed roaming scenario, the UE\'s EPS PDN Contexts are obtained from
the V-SMF. If Small Data Rate Control applies on PDU Session, the V-SMF
retrieves the SM Context, including Small Rate Control Status information from
the H-SMF using Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request.
3\. The AMF sends a Forward Relocation Request as in step 3 in clause
5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13], with the following
modifications and clarifications:
\- Parameter \"Return preferred\" may be included. Return preferred is an
optional indication by the MME of a preferred return of the UE to the 5GS PLMN
at a later access change to a 5GS shared network. An MME may use this
information as specified by TS 23.501 [2].
\- The SGW address and TEID for both the control-plane or EPS bearers in the
message are such that target MME selects a new SGW.
\- The AMF determines, based on configuration and the Direct Forwarding Path
Availability, the Direct Forwarding Flag to inform the target MME whether
direct data forwarding is applicable.
\- The AMF includes the mapped SM EPS UE Contexts for PDU Sessions with and
without active UP connections.
\- Subject to operator policy if the secondary RAT access restriction
condition is the same for EPS and 5GS, the AMF may set EPS secondary RAT
access restriction condition based on the UE\'s subscription data.
4-5. Step 4 and 4a respectively in clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover,
normal) in TS 23.401 [13].
6\. Step 5 (Handover Request) in clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal)
in TS 23.401 [13] with the following modification:
\- Handover Request may contain information Handover Restriction List with
information about PLMN IDs as specified by clause 5.2a of TS 23.251 [35] for
eNodeB functions.
\- The target eNB should establish E-RABs indicated by the list of EPS bearer
to be setup provided by the MME, even if they are not included in the source
to target container.
7-9. Step 5a through 7 in clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS
23.401 [13].
10a. If data forwarding applies, the AMF sends the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (data forwarding information) to the
SMF+PGW-C. If multiple SMF+PGW-Cs serves the UE, the AMF maps the EPS bearers
for Data forwarding to the SMF+PGW-C address(es) based on the association
between the EPS bearer ID(s) and PDU Session ID(s). In home-routed roaming
case, the AMF requests the V-SMF to create indirect forwarding tunnel if
indirect forwarding applies.
10b. If indirect data forwarding applies, the SMF+PGW-C may select an
intermediate PGW-U+UPF for data forwarding. The SMF+PGW-C maps the EPS bearers
for Data forwarding to the 5G QoS flows based on the association between the
EPS bearer ID(s) and QFI(s) for the QoS flow(s) in the SMF+PGW-C and then
sends the QFIs, Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) for data forwarding to the
PGW-U+UPF. The CN Tunnel Info is provided by the PGW-U+UPF to SMF+PGW-C in
this response. In home-routed roaming case, the V-SMF selects the V-UPF for
data forwarding.
10c. The SMF+PGW-C returns an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (Cause,
Data Forwarding tunnel Info, QoS flows for Data Forwarding). Based on the
correlation between QFI(s) and Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) for data
forwarding, the PGW-U+UPF maps the QoS flow(s) into the data forwarding
tunnel(s) in EPC.
11\. The AMF sends the Handover Command to the source NG-RAN (Transparent
container (radio aspect parameters that the target eNB has set-up in the
preparation phase), Data forwarding tunnel info, QoS flows for Data
Forwarding). The source NG-RAN commands the UE to handover to the target
Access Network by sending the HO Command. The UE correlates the ongoing QoS
Flows with the indicated EPS Bearer IDs to be setup in the HO command. The UE
locally deletes the PDU Session if the QoS Flow associated with the default
QoS rule in the PDU Session does not have an EPS Bearer ID assigned. If the
QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule has an EPS Bearer ID assigned,
the UE keeps the PDU Session (PDN connection) and for the remaining QoS
Flow(s) that do not have EPS bearer ID(s) assigned, the UE locally deletes the
QoS rule(s) and the QoS Flow level QoS parameters if any associated with those
QoS Flow(s) and notifies the impacted applications that the dedicated QoS
resource has been released. The UE deletes any UE derived QoS rules. The EPS
Bearer ID that was assigned for the QoS flow of the default QoS rule in the
PDU Session becomes the EPS Bearer ID of the default bearer in the
corresponding PDN connection.
If indirect data forwarding is applied, Data forwarding tunnel info includes
CN tunnel info for data forwarding per PDU session. For the QoS Flows
indicated in the \"QoS Flows for Data Forwarding\", NG-RAN initiate data
forwarding via to the PGW-U+UPF based on the CN Tunnel Info for Data
Forwarding per PDU Session. Then the PGW-U+UPF maps data received from the
data forwarding tunnel(s) in the 5GS to the data forwarding tunnel(s) in EPS
and sends the data to the target eNodeB via the Serving GW.
If direct data forwarding is applied, Data forwarding tunnel info includes
E-UTRAN tunnel info for data forwarding per EPS bearer. NG-RAN initiate data
forwarding to the target E-UTRAN based on the Data Forwarding Tunnel Info for
Data Forwarding per EPS bearer.
12-12c. Step 13 to step 14 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal)
in TS 23.401 [13] with the following clarification:
\- The AMF requests the release of the PDU Session which is associated with
3GPP access and not expected to be transferred to EPC, i.e. the AMF requests
the release of:
\- PDU Session(s) whose corresponding SMF+PGW-C(s) are not contacted by AMF
for SM context because the AMF determines that none of EBI(s) for the PDU
Session can be transferred to EPS at step 2a; and
\- PDU Session(s) for which the SM context retrieval failed at step 2c.
12d. The AMF acknowledges MME with Relocation Complete Ack message. A timer in
AMF is started to supervise when resource in NG-RAN shall be released.
12e. In the case of home routed roaming, the AMF invokes
Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request (V-SMF only indication) to the V-SMF.
This service operation request the V-SMF to remove only the SM context in
V-SMF, i.e. not release PDU Session context in the SMF+PGW-C.
If indirect forwarding tunnel(s) were previously established, the V-SMF starts
a timer and releases the SM context on expiry of the timer. If no indirect
forwarding tunnel has been established, the V-SMF immediately releases the SM
context and its UP resources for this PDU Session in V-UPF locally.
13\. Step 15 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401
[13].
14a. Step 16 (Modify Bearer Request) from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover,
normal) in TS 23.401 [13] with the following clarification:
\- If the PDU Session (PDN connection) has QoS Flows that do not have EPS
bearer ID(s) assigned, or QoS Flow(s) for which the mapped EPS bearers are not
included in Modify Bearer Request, the SMF+PGW-C deletes the PCC rule(s)
associated with those QoS Flows and informs the PCF about the removed PCC
rule(s).
NOTE 4: If the QoS flow is deleted, the IP flows of the deleted QoS rules will
continue flowing on the default EPS bearer if it does not have an assigned
TFT. If the default EPS bearer has an assigned TFT, the IP flows of the
deleted QoS Flow may be interrupted until step 19 when dedicated bearer
activation is triggered by a request from the PCF.
The SMF+PGW-C may need to report some subscribed event to the PCF by
performing an SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as
defined in clause 4.16.5.
15\. The SMF+PGW-C initiates a N4 Session Modification procedure towards the
UPF+PGW-U to update the User Plane path, i.e. the downlink User Plane for the
indicated PDU Session is switched to E-UTRAN. The SMF+PGW-C releases the
resource of the CN tunnel for PDU Session in UPF+PGW-U.
16\. Step 16a (Modify Bearer Response) from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based
handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13]. At this stage the User Plane path is
established for the default bearer and the dedicated EPS bearers between the
UE, target eNodeB, Serving GW and the PGW-U+UPF. The SMF+PGW-C uses the EPS
QoS parameters as assigned for the dedicated EPS bearers during the QoS Flow
establishment. SMF+PGW-C maps all the other IP flows to the default EPS bearer
(see NOTE 4).
If indirect forwarding tunnel(s) were previously established, the SMF+PGW-C
starts a timer, to be used to release the resource used for indirect data
forwarding.
17\. Step 17 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401
[13].
18\. The UE initiates a Tracking Area Update procedure as specified in step 18
of clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13].
This includes the deregistration of the old AMF for 3GPP access from the
HSS+UDM as specified in clause 4.11.1.5.3. Any registration associated with
the non-3GPP access in the old AMF is not removed (i.e. an AMF that was
serving the UE over both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses does not consider the UE
as deregistered over non 3GPP access and will remain registered and subscribed
to subscription data updates in UDM).
NOTE 5: The behaviour whereby the HSS+UDM cancels location of CN node of the
another type, i.e. AMF, is similar to HSS behaviour for MME and Gn/Gp SGSN
registration (see TS 23.401 [13]). The target AMF that receives the cancel
location from the HSS+UDM is the one associated with 3GPP access.
When the UE decides to deregister over non-3GPP access or the old AMF decides
not to maintain a UE registration for non-3GPP access anymore, the old AMF
then deregisters from UDM by sending a Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service
operation, unsubscribes from Subscription Data updates by sending an
Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe service operation to UDM and releases all the AMF and AN
resources related to the UE.
19\. If PCC is deployed, the PCF may decide to provide the previously removed
PCC rules to the SMF+PGW-C again thus triggering the SMF+PGW-C to initiate
dedicated bearer activation procedure. This procedure is specified in clause
5.4.1 of TS 23.401 [13] with modification captured in clause 4.11.1.5.4. This
step is applicable for PDN Type IP or Ethernet, but not for non-IP PDN Type.
20\. Step 21 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401
[13].
21\. In the case of home routed roaming, at the expiry of the timer at V-SMF
started at step 12e, the V-SMF locally releases the SM context and the UP
resource for the PDU Session including the resources used for indirect
forwarding tunnel(s) that were allocated at step 10.
In non-roaming or local breakout roaming, if SMF+PGW-C has started a timer in
step 16, at the expiry of the timer, the SMF+PGW-C sends N4 Session
Modification Request to PGW-U+UPF to release the resources used for the
indirect forwarding tunnel(s) that were allocated at step 10.
When the timer set in step 12d expires, AMF also sends a UE Context Release
Command message to the source NG RAN. The source NG RAN releases its resources
related to the UE and responds with a UE Context Release Complete message.
##### 4.11.1.2.2 EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface
##### 4.11.1.2.2.1 General {#general-25 .H6}
N26 interface is used to provide seamless session continuity for single
registration mode.
The procedure involves a handover to 5GS and setup of QoS Flows in 5GS.
In the home routed roaming case, the PGW-C+ SMF in the HPLMN always receives
the PDU Session ID from UE and provides PDN Connection associated 5G QoS
parameter(s) and S-NSSAI to the UE. This also applies in the case that the
HPLMN operates the interworking procedure without N26.
In the case of handover to a shared 5GS network, the source E-UTRAN determines
a PLMN to be used in the target network as specified by clause 5.2a of TS
23.251 [35] for eNodeB functions. A supporting MME may provide the AMF via N26
with an indication that source EPS PLMN is a preferred PLMN when that PLMN is
available at later change of the UE to an EPS shared network.
NOTE 1: If the UE has active EPS bearer for normal voice or IMS emergency
voice, the source E-UTRAN can be configured to not trigger any handover to
5GS.
If the PDN Type of a PDN Connection in EPS is non-IP and is locally associated
in UE and SMF to PDU Session Type Ethernet or Unstructured, the PDU Session
Type in 5GS shall be set to Ethernet or Unstructured respectively.
NOTE 2: If the non-IP PDN Type is locally associated in UE and SMF to PDU
Session Type Ethernet, it means that Ethernet PDN Type is not supported in
EPS.
NOTE 3: The IP address continuity can\'t be supported, if SMF+PGW-C in the
HPLMN doesn\'t provide the mapped QoS parameters.
##### 4.11.1.2.2.2 Preparation phase {#preparation-phase-1 .H6}
Figure 4.11.1.2.2.2-1 shows the preparation phase of the Single Registration-
based Interworking from EPS to 5GS procedure.
Figure 4.11.1.2.2.2-1: EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface, preparation
phase
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (TS 23.501 [2] Figure 4.3.1-1),
Home-routed roaming (TS 23.501 [2] Figure 4.3.2-1) and Local Breakout roaming
Local Breakout (TS 23.501 [2] Figure 4.3.2-2) cases.
\- For non-roaming scenario, V-SMF, v-UPF and v-PCF are not present
\- For home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF+PGW-C and UPF+PGW-U are in the
HPLMN. v-PCF are not present
\- For local breakout roaming scenario, V-SMF and v-UPF are not present.
SMF+PGW-C and UPF+PGW-U are in the VPLMN.
In local-breakout roaming case, the v-PCF interacts wit the SMF+PGW-C.
1 - 2. Step 1 - 2 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS
23.401 [13].
3\. Step 3 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13]
with the following modifications:
An additional optional parameter Return preferred. Return preferred is an
optional indication provided by the MME to indicate a preferred return of the
UE to the last used EPS PLMN at a later access change to an EPS shared
network. Based on the Return Preferred indication, the initial AMF may store
the last used EPS PLMN ID in the UE Context.
The initial AMF converts the received EPS MM Context into the 5GS MM Context.
This includes converting the EPS security context into a mapped 5G security
context as described in TS 33.501 [15]. The MME UE context includes IMSI, ME
Identity, UE security context, UE Network Capability and EPS Bearer context(s)
and may also include LTE-M Indication. The MME EPS Bearer context(s) include
for each EPS PDN connection the IP address and FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of
the SMF+PGW-C and APN and for each EPS bearer the IP address and CN Tunnel
Info at the UPF+PGW-U for uplink traffic. If the AMF received the LTE-M
indication in the EPS MM Context, then it considers that the RAT Type is
LTE-M.
The initial AMF queries the (PLMN level) NRF in serving PLMN by issuing the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request including the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the
SMF+PGW-C and the NRF provides the IP address or FQDN of the N11/N16 interface
of the SMF+PGW-C.
If the initial AMF cannot retrieve the address of the corresponding SMF for a
PDN connection, it will not move the PDN connection to 5GS.
NOTE 1: If the initial AMF holds a native 5G security context for the UE, the
initial AMF may activate this native 5G security context by initiating a NAS
SMC upon completing the handover procedure.
4\. The initial AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext service
operation (UE EPS PDN Connection, initial AMF ID, data Forwarding information,
Target ID) on the SMF identified by the SMF+PGW-C address and indicates HO
Preparation Indication (to avoid switching the UP path). The initial AMF ID
uniquely identifies the initial AMF serving the UE. This step is performed for
each PDN Connection and the corresponding SMF+PGW-C address/ID in the UE
context the initial AMF received in step 3. The SMF finds the corresponding
PDU Session based on EPS Bearer Context(s).
Based on configuration and the Direct Forwarding Flag received from the MME,
the initial AMF determines the applicability of data forwarding and indicates
to the SMF whether the direct data forwarding or indirect data forwarding is
applicable.
Target ID corresponds to Target ID provided by the MME in step 3.
For home-routed roaming scenario, the initial AMF selects a default V-SMF per
PDU Session and invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext service operation
(UE PDN Connection Contexts, initial AMF ID, SMF + PGW-C address, S-NSSAI).
The S-NSSAI is the S-NSSAI configured in initial AMF for interworking, which
is associated with default V-SMF.
The default V-SMF selects the SMF+PGW-C using the received H-SMF address as
received from the initial AMF and initiates a Nsmf_PDUSession_Create service
operation with the SMF+PGW-C and indicates HO Preparation Indication.
Step 5 and step 6 are skipped if the SMF+PGW-C (H-SMF+PGW-C in the case of
home-routed scenario) determines that session continuity from EPS to 5GS is
not supported for the PDU Session (e.g. PDU Session ID was not received for
the PDN connection in EPS or PDU Session ID was received but mapped 5GS
parameters were not provided to the UE due to 5GS interworking not supported).
NOTE 2: When there are lots of PDN connections attempted to be transferred to
5GS while there was no PDU Session ID received from the UE over EPS, the
performance counters related with failed PDN connections transfer from EPS to
5GS can get high values. Likewise, in this case, the performance counters
related with target NG RAN not receiving N2 SM information corresponding to
EPS bearers received from E-UTRAN can get high values.
5\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the SMF+ PGW-C (H-SMF for home-routed
scenario) may initiate SMF initiated SM Policy Modification towards the PCF.
6\. The SMF+PGW-C requests the PGW-U+UPF to allocate the CN Tunnel Info for
PDU Session. The SMF+PGW-C send N4 Session modification to PGW-U+UPF to
establish the CN tunnel for PDU Session at PGW-U+UPF. The PGW-U+UPF is ready
to receive the uplink packets from NG-RAN. The PGW-U+UPF allocates the PGW-U
CN Tunnel Info for PDU Session and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C. This step is
performed at all SMF+PGW-Cs allocated to the UE for each PDU Session of the
UE.
7\. The SMF+PGW-C (default V-SMF in the case of home-routed roaming scenario
only) sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response (PDU Session ID,
S-NSSAI, allocated EBIs, N2 SM Information (QoS Profile(s), EPS Bearer Setup
List, Mapping between EBI(s) and QFI(s), CN Tunnel-Info, cause code)) to the
initial AMF.
For home-routed roaming scenario the step 8 need be executed first. The CN
Tunnel-Info provided to the initial AMF in N2 SM Information is the V-CN
Tunnel-Info.
The SMF includes mapping between EBI(s) and QFI(s) as part of N2 SM
Information container. If the SMF+PGW-C (H-SMF+PGW-C in the case of home-
routed scenario) determines that session continuity from EPS to 5GS is not
supported for the PDU Session (e.g. PDU Session ID was not received for the
PDN connection in EPS), then it does not provide SM information for the
corresponding PDU Session but includes the appropriate cause code for
rejecting the PDU Session transfer within the N2 SM Information and release
the PDN connection locally in the SMF+PGW-C. If neither indirect forwarding
nor direct forwarding is applicable, the SMF shall further include a \"Data
forwarding not possible\" indication in the N2 SM information container. If
SMF is indicated that Direct Forwarding is applicable, the SMF shall further
include a \"Direct Forwarding Path Availability\" indication in the N2 SM
information container. In home routed roaming case, the S-NSSAI included in N2
SM Information container is the S-NSSAI received in step 4.
The initial AMF stores an association of the PDU Session ID, S-NSSAI and the
SMF ID. The AMF stores also the allocated EBI(s) associated to the PDU Session
ID.
If the PDN Type of a PDN Connection in EPS is non-IP and is locally associated
in SMF to PDU Session Type Ethernet, the PDU Session Type in 5GS shall be set
to Ethernet. If the PDN type of a PDN Connection in EPS is non-IP and is
locally associated in UE and SMF to PDU Session Type Unstructured, the PDU
Session Type in 5GS shall be set to Unstructured.
NOTE 3: If the non-IP PDN Type is locally associated in SMF to PDU Session
Type Ethernet, it means that Ethernet PDN Type is not supported in EPS.
In the case of PDU Session Type Ethernet, that was using PDN type non-IP in
EPS, the SMF creates QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters for the QoS
Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) based on the PCC Rules received from
PCF.
8\. For home-routed roaming scenario only: The default V-SMF selects a default
v-UPF and initiates an N4 Session Establishment procedure with the selected
default v-UPF. The default V-SMF provides the default v-UPF with packet
detection, enforcement and reporting rules to be installed on the UPF for this
PDU Session, including H-CN Tunnel Info.
The default v-UPF acknowledges by sending an N4 Session Establishment Response
message. The V-CN Tunnel Info is allocated by the v-UPF and provided to the
default V-SMF in this step.
8a. Based on the received S-NSSAI from the SMF+PGW-C, the Initial AMF may
reselect a target AMF as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2] and
invokes Namf_Communication_RelocateUEContext request (SUPI, Target 5GAN Node
ID, PDU session ID and the S-NSSAI associated with N2 SM Information received
in step 7, Source to Target Transparent Container, 5GS MM Context, MME Tunnel
Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane, MME Address for Control plane, PDU
Session ID and its associated S-NSSAI of the VPLMN value for each PDU Session,
the corresponding S-NSSAI of HPLMN value for home routed PDU Session(s),
SMF+PGW-C ID of each PDU Session, default V-SMF ID and SM Context ID of each
PDU Session, allocated EBIs of each PDU Session, Allowed NSSAI received from
NSSF) to the selected target AMF.
NOTE 4: When there is no need of AMF reallocation, then the target AMF in
following steps is the same as the initial AMF.
NOTE 5: In the case of Home routed PDU Session the S-NSSAI associated with N2
SM information used in steps 8, 8a and 9 is the S-NSSAI configured for
interworking in the initial AMF. Otherwise the S-NSSAI received from the SMF
in step 7 can be used in steps 8, 8a and 9 for the S-NSSAI associated with N2
SM information.
9\. The target AMF sends a Handover Request (Source to Target Transparent
Container, Allowed NSSAI, PDU session ID and the S-NSSAI received from Source
AMF associated with the corresponding N2 SM Information (QFI(s), QoS
Profile(s), EPS Bearer Setup List, V-CN Tunnel Info, Mapping between EBI(s)
and QFI(s)), Mobility Restriction List, UE Radio Capability ID) message to the
NG-RAN. The target AMF provides NG-RAN with a PLMN list in the Mobility
Restriction List containing at least the serving PLMN, taking into account the
last used EPS PLMN ID and the Return preferred indication. The Mobility
Restriction List contain information about PLMN IDs as specified by TS 23.501
[2].
NG-RAN can use the source to target transparent container and N2 SM
Information container to determine which QoS flows have been proposed for
forwarding and decide for which of those QoS flows it accepts the data
forwarding or not.
The target AMF provides the UE Radio Capability ID to NG-RAN if RACS is
supported. If the UE Radio Capability ID is included in the Handover Request
message, when there is no corresponding UE radio capabilities set for UE Radio
Capability ID at NG-RAN and no UE radio access capabilities are provided in
the Source to Target transparent container, NG-RAN shall request the T-AMF to
provide the UE radio capabilities set corresponding to UE Radio Capability ID
to the NG-RAN. If the Source to Target transparent container contains the UE
radio access capabilities and the T-RAN did not receive the UE Radio
Capability ID from the T-AMF, NG-RAN shall proceed with handover using the
received UE access radio capabilities. If the T-RAN received both the UE radio
access capabilities and the UE Radio Capability ID, then the T-RAN shall use
any locally stored UE radio access capability information corresponding to the
UE Radio Capability ID. If none are stored locally, the T-RAN may request the
full UE radio access capability information from the core network. If the full
UE radio access capability information is not promptly received from the core
network, or the T-RAN chooses not to request them, then the T-RAN shall
proceed with the UE radio access capabilities sent by the source RAN node. The
T-RAN shall not use the UE radio access capability information received from
the source RAN node for any other UE with the same the UE Radio Capability ID.
10\. The NG-RAN sends a Handover Request Acknowledge (Target to Source
Transparent Container, List of PDU Sessions to Hand-over with N2 SM response
(PDU Session ID, list of accepted QFI(s), AN Tunnel Info, Data Forwarding
Tunnel Info), List of PDU Sessions that failed to be established with the
failure cause given in the N2 SM information element) message to the target
AMF.
If indirect data forwarding is applied, the NG-RAN includes one assigned
TEID/TNL address per PDU Session (for which there is at least one QoS flow for
which it has accepted the forwarding) within the SM Info container. It also
includes the list of QoS flows for which it has accepted the forwarding.
According to the mapping between EBI(s) and QFI(s), if one EPS bearer in EPS
is mapped to multiple QoS flows in 5GS, all such QoS flows need to be accepted
to support indirect data forwarding during EPS to 5GS mobility. Otherwise, the
NG RAN rejects the indirect data forwarding for the QoS flows which are mapped
to the EPS bearer.
If direct data forwarding is applied, the NG-RAN includes one assigned
TEID/TNL per E-RAB accepted for direct data forwarding.
When the target NG-RAN rejects the handover with a Handover Failure, steps
11-13 and step 16 are not executed.
11\. The target AMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (PDU
Session ID, N2 SM response received from NG-RAN in step 10) message to the SMF
for updating N3 tunnel information. In home routed roaming case, the Data
Forwarding Tunnel Info is handled by the default V-SMF and will not be sent to
the SMF+PGW-C.
12\. SMF+PGW-C (default V-SMF in home-routed roaming scenario) performs
preparations for N2 Handover by indicating N3 UP address and Tunnel ID of NG-
RAN to the UPF if N2 Handover is accepted by NG-RAN. If indirect data
forwarding is applied, SMF+PGW-C indicates the mapping between the TEID where
the UPF receives data forwarded by the source SGW and the QFI(s) and N3 Tunnel
Info for data forwarding where the UPF is selected to forward such data (e.g.
an intermediate UPF). If the EPS bearer is mapped to multiple QoS flows and an
intermediate UPF is selected for data forwarding, only one QFI is selected by
the SMF+PGW-C from QFIs corresponding to the QoS flows.
If indirect data forwarding is applied in home routed roaming case, the
default V-SMF sends a default V-UPF for data forwarding the mapping between
the TEID where the UPF receives data forwarded by the source SGW and the QFI
and N3 Tunnel Info for data forwarding. If the EPS bearer is mapped to
multiple QoS flows and an intermediate UPF is selected for data forwarding,
only one QFI is selected by the SMF+PGW-C from QFIs corresponding to the QoS
flows.
If N2 Handover is not accepted by NG-RAN, SMF+PGW-C deallocates N3 UP address
and Tunnel ID of the selected UPF.
The EPS Bearer Setup list is a list of EPS bearer Identifiers successfully
handover to 5GC, which is generated based on the list of accepted QFI(s).
If a PDU Session is rejected by the Target NG-RAN with an indication that the
PDU session was rejected because User Plane Security Enforcement is not
supported in the Target NG-RAN and the User Plane Enforcement Policy indicates
\"Required\" as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF triggers
the release of this PDU Session. In all other cases of PDU Session rejection,
the SMF can decide whether to release the PDU Session or to deactivate the UP
connection of this PDU Session.
If some of the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are not accepted by the Target NG-
RAN, the SMF shall initiate the PDU Session Modification procedure to remove
the non-accepted QoS Flows from the PDU Session(s) after the handover
procedure is completed.
13\. SMF+PGW-C (default V-SMF in home-routed roaming scenario) to target AMF:
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext _Response (_ PDU Session ID, EPS Bearer Setup
List _). The data forwarding information is included in the EPS Bearer Setup
List. In home routed roaming case, the default V-SMF provides the tunnel
information for data forwarding._
This message is sent for each received Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext_Request
message.
14\. The target AMF sends the message Forward Relocation Response (Cause,
Target to Source Transparent Container, Serving GW change indication, EPS
Bearer Setup List, target AMF Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane,
Addresses and TEIDs) to MME. The EPS Bearer Setup list is the combination of
EPS Bearer Setup list from different SMF+PGW-C(s).
In the case of Handover Failure in step 10, the target AMF provides to the MME
the failure related information such as the Target RAN to Source RAN Failure
Information.
15\. The target AMF invokes Namf_Communication_RelocateUEContext response
(Cause) to the initial AMF if step 8a had been performed. The target AMF
indicates whether the Relocate UE Context (hand-Over) succeeded or failed.
If the target NG RAN has rejected the Handover Request in step 10, the
Namf_Communication_RelocateUEContext response indicates a failure due to RAN
rejection. Then the initial AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
request towards the SMF+PGW-C(s) contacted at step 4 indicating . The
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request contains an indication that this is
due to a handover rejected by the target RAN.
16\. Step 8 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401
[13] is executed if the source MME determines that indirect data forwarding
applies.
##### 4.11.1.2.2.3 Execution phase {#execution-phase-1 .H6}
Figure 4.11.1.2.2.3-1 shows the Single Registration-based Interworking from
EPS to 5GS procedure.
Figure 4.11.1.2.2.3-1: EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface, execution
phase
NOTE: Step 6 P-GW-C+SMF Registration in the UDM is not shown in the figure for
simplicity.
1 - 2. Step 9 - 11 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS
23.401 [13]. Different from step 9a of clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover,
normal) in TS 23.401 [13], upon reception of Handover Command, the UE will
keep the QoS Flow context for which it did not receive the corresponding radio
resources in the NG-RAN until the QoS Flow is released by the network using
PDU Session Modification procedure in clause 4.3.3. If the QoS Flow with a
default QoS Rule of a PDU Session does not have the corresponding radio
resources in the NG-RAN, UE considers that the user plane of this PDU Session
is deactivated.
3\. Handover Confirm: the UE confirms handover to the NG-RAN.
The UE moves from the E-UTRAN and synchronizes with the target NG-RAN. The UE
may resume the uplink transmission of user plane data only for those QFIs and
Session IDs for which there are radio resources allocated in the NG-RAN.
The E-UTRAN sends DL data to the Data Forwarding address received in step 1.
If the indirect data forwarding is applied, the E-UTRAN forward the DL data to
NG-RAN via the SGW and the v-UPF. The v-UPF forwards the data packets to the
NG-RAN using the N3 Tunnel Info for data forwarding, adding the QFI
information. The target NG-RAN prioritizes the forwarded packets over the
fresh packets for those QoS flows for which it had accepted data forwarding.
If Direct data forwarding is applied, the E-UTRAN forwards the DL data packets
to the NG-RAN via the direct data forwarding tunnel.
4\. Handover Notify: the NG-RAN notifies to the target AMF that the UE is
handed over to the NG-RAN.
5\. Then the target AMF knows that the UE has arrived to the target side and
informs the MME by sending a Forward Relocation Complete Notification message.
6\. Step 14 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401
[13].
7\. Target AMF to SMF +PGW-C (V-SMF in the case of roaming and Home-routed
case): Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (Handover Complete Indication
for PDU Session ID). In the Home-routed roaming case, the V-SMF invokes
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (V-CN Tunnel Info, Handover Complete
Indication) to SMF+PGW-C.
Handover Complete Indication is sent per each PDU Session to the corresponding
SMF +PGW-C (sent by V-SMF in the roaming and Home-routed case) to indicate the
success of the N2 Handover.
If indirect forwarding is used, a timer in SMF+PGW-C (V-SMF in the case of
roaming and Home-routed case) is started to supervise when resources in UPF
(for indirect data forwarding) shall be released.
8\. The SMF + PGW-C updates the UPF + PGW-U with the V-CN Tunnel Info,
indicating that downlink User Plane for the indicated PDU Session is switched
to NG-RAN or V-UPF in the case of roaming in Home-routed case and the CN
tunnels for EPS bearers corresponding to the PDU session can be released.
For each EPS Bearer one or more \"end marker\" is sent to Serving GW by the
UPF+PGW-U immediately after switching the path. The UPF + PGW-U starts sending
downlink packets to the V-UPF.
9\. If PCC infrastructure is used, the SMF + PGW-C informs the PCF about the
change of, for example, the RAT type and UE location.
10\. SMF +PGW-C to target AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (PDU
Session ID).
SMF +PGW-C confirms reception of Handover Complete.
\- If the SMF has not yet registered for this PDU Session ID, then the SMF
registers with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, DNN, PDU Session
ID) for a given PDU Session as in step 4 of PDU Session Establishment
Procedure in clause 4.3.2.
11\. For home-routed roaming scenario: The V-SMF provides to the v-UPF with
the N3 DL AN Tunnel Info. This step is executed after step 7.
12\. The UE performs the EPS to 5GS Mobility Registration Procedure from step
2 in clause 4.11.1.3.3. The UE includes the UE Policy Container containing the
list of PSIs, indication of UE support for ANDSP and OSId if available. If the
UE holds a native 5G-GUTI it also includes the native 5G-GUTI as an additional
GUTI in the Registration Request. The UE shall select the 5G-GUTI for the
additional GUTI as follows, listed in decreasing order of preference:
\- a native 5G-GUTI assigned by the PLMN to which the UE is attempting to
register, if available;
\- a native 5G-GUTI assigned by an equivalent PLMN to the PLMN to which the UE
is attempting to register, if available;
\- a native 5G-GUTI assigned by any other PLMN, if available.
The additional GUTI enables the target AMF to find the UE\'s 5G security
context (if available). The target AMF provides NG-RAN with a PLMN list in the
Handover Restriction List containing at least the serving PLMN, taking into
account of the last used EPS PLMN ID and Return preferred indication as part
of the Registration procedure execution and target AMF signalling to NG-RAN.
The Handover Restriction List contains a list of PLMN IDs as specified by TS
23.501 [2].
13\. Step 19 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401
[13]. Step 20a - 20b from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS
23.401 [13], with the following modification:
For the PDN connections which that are not possible to be transferred to 5GS,
(e.g. PDN connections anchored in a standalone PGW), the MME initiates PDN
connection release procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [13].
14\. If indirect forwarding was used, then the expiry of the timer started at
step 7 triggers the SMF+PGW-C (V-SMF in the case of roaming and Home-routed
case) to release temporary resources used for indirect forwarding that were
allocated at steps 11 to 13 in clause 4.11.1.2.2.2.
##### 4.11.1.2.3 Handover Cancel
Instead of completing the handover procedure, the source RAN node (NG-RAN,
E-UTRAN) may at any time, during the handover procedure, up to the time when a
handover command message is sent to the UE, cancel the handover. The reason
for cancelling may be e.g. due to a timer expiration or due to other events
within the source RAN node and is initiated by sending a handover cancel
message to the source CN node (AMF or MME).
A handover cancel message shall also be sent by the source RAN node after a
handover command message is sent to the UE for the case where the handover
fails and the UE returns to the old cell or radio contact with the UE is lost.
This is done in order to release the resources reserved for the handover in
the target system.
During EPS to 5GS handover when the initial AMF has invoked a target AMF (as
described in step 8a in clause 4.11.1.2.2),
\- when the source MME has received a N26 Forward Relocation Response from the
target AMF, the MME sends N26 Cancel Relocation Request directly to the target
AMF and the initial AMF is not involved at all in the Cancel Relocation
procedure.
\- When the source MME has not received a response from the target AMF, the
MME sends N26 Cancel Relocation Request to the initial AMF:
\- if the initial AMF has already invoked the target AMF, the initial AMF
indicates the Cancel Relocation to the target AMF and the target AMF becomes
responsible of the Handover Cancellation (e.g. the target AMF initiates
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request indicating Handover Cancel towards the
SMF+PGW-C(s) unless the target AMF has already indicated a Handover failure
due to prior target NG RAN rejection of the Handover);
\- otherwise the initial AMF handles the relocation cancellation.
Figure 4.11.1.2.3-1: Handover Cancel procedure
1\. When the source RAN (NG-RAN, E-UTRAN) decides to cancel the handover to
the target system, the source RAN initiates handover cancel message to the
source CN node (AMF or MME).
2\. After receiving the handover cancel message from the source RAN, if the
source CN node or the target CN node is MME, it sends a Relocation Cancel
Request message to the target CN node (MME or AMF). If both the source CN node
and target CN node are AMF, the source AMF invokes the
Namf_Communication_ReleaseUEContext Request (UE Context ID, Relocation Cancel
Indication) toward the target AMF. During EPS to 5GS handover with AMF
reallocation if the initial AMF has invoked a target AMF, the initial AMF
invokes the Namf_Communication_CancelRelocateUEContext Request (UE Context ID)
toward the target AMF.
3\. The target CN node (MME or AMF) triggers release of resources towards
target RAN node. The target RAN node releases the AN resources allocated for
the handover.
4\. If the target CN node is MME, the MME sends the Delete Session Request to
the SGW/SGW-C (see clause 5.5.2.5.2 of TS 23.401 [13]).
4a. [Conditional] The SGW-C releases the corresponding resource in the SGW-U
if allocated during the handover preparation.
4b. If the target CN node is AMF, the AMF invokes the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request (Relocation Cancel Indication) toward
the SMF in non-roaming and local breakout roaming scenarios.
For home-routed roaming scenario, AMF invokes the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request (Relocation Cancel Indication) toward
the (target) V-SMF and the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request
(Relocation Cancel Indication) towards the H-SMF.
Based on the Relocation Cancel Indication, the SMF(s) deletes the session
resources established during handover preparation phase in SMF(s) and UPF(s).
4c. [Conditional] The (target) V-SMF releases the corresponding resource in
the (target) V-UPF if allocated during the handover preparation.
4d. [Conditional] The (H-)SMF+PGW-C releases the corresponding resource in the
(H-)UPF+PGW-U if allocated during the handover preparation.
5\. The target CN node (MME or AMF) sends Relocation Cancel Response towards
the source CN node (AMF or MME).
6\. The source CN node (AMF or MME) responds with handover cancel ACK towards
the source RAN.
7\. [Conditional] If target CN node is AMF and the source CN is MME and
indirect forwarding tunnel had been set up during handover preparation phase
then cancellation of handover triggers the MME to release the temporary
resources used for indirect forwarding.
7b. [Conditional] If the source CN is AMF and the target CN node is MME and if
indirect forwarding tunnel had been setup during handover preparation phase,
then cancellation of handover triggers the AMF to release the session
resources established during handover preparation phase in SMF(s) and UPF(s).
\- The AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request (Relocation
Cancel Indication) toward the SMF in non-roaming and local breakout roaming
scenarios.
\- For home-routed roaming scenario, the AMF invokes the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request (Relocation Cancel Indication) toward
the V-SMF and the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (Relocation
Cancel Indication) towards the H-SMF.
Based on the Relocation Cancel Indication, the SMF(s) deletes the session
resources established during handover preparation phase in SMF(s) and UPF(s).
7c. [Conditional] In home routed roaming case, the V-SMF releases the
corresponding resource in the target V-UPF if allocated during the handover
preparation.
7d. [Conditional] In non-roaming or LBO case, the SMF+PGW-C releases the
corresponding resource in the UPF+PGW-U if allocated during the handover
preparation.
8\. [Conditional] If target CN node is MME and indirect forwarding tunnel is
setup during handover preparation phase then cancellation of handover triggers
the target MME to release the temporary resources used for indirect
forwarding.
8a. [Conditional] The SGW-C releases the resources for indirect forwarding in
the SGW-U if allocated during the handover preparation.
#### 4.11.1.3 Idle Mode Mobility procedures
##### 4.11.1.3.1 General
When a UE moves from EPC to 5GC, the UE always performs Registration
procedure.
When a UE moves from 5GC to EPC, the UE performs either Tracking Area Update
or Initial Attach.
The UE performs Tracking Area Update procedure if
\- Both the UE and the EPC support \"attach without PDN connectivity\", or
\- The UE has at least one PDU Session for which Session Continuity is
supported during interworking, i.e. the UE has EPS Bearer ID and mapped EPS
QoS parameters received as described in clause 4.11.1.1.
The UE performs an initial attach procedure if
\- The UE is registered without PDU Session in 5GC or the UE is registered
only with PDU Session for which Session Continuity is not supported during
interworking to EPC and
\- Either the UE or the EPC does not support attach without PDN connectivity.
##### 4.11.1.3.2 5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface
In the case of network sharing the UE selects the target PLMN ID according to
clause 5.18.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
Clause 4.11.1.3.2 covers the case of idle mode mobility from 5GC to EPC. UE
performs Tracking Area Update procedure in E-UTRA/EPS when it moves from NG-
RAN/5GS to E-UTRA/EPS coverage area.
The procedure involves a Tracking Area Update to EPC and setup of default EPS
bearer and dedicated bearers in EPC in steps 1-11 and re-activation, if
required.
Figure 4.11.1.3.2-1: 5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface
The TAU procedure in TS 23.401 [13] is used with the following 5GS
interaction:
1\. Step 1 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW
change) in TS 23.401 [13].
2\. Step 2 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW
change) in TS 23.401 [13] with the modification captured in clause 4.11.1.5.3.
3-4. Steps 3-4 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with
Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13].
5a. The AMF verifies the integrity of the TAU request message:
The AMF determines for a PDU Session whether to retrieve context including
mapped UE EPS connection from V-SMF (in the case of HR roaming) or from the
SMF+PGW-C (in the case of non roaming or LBO roaming) as follows:
\- If the AMF determines that one or more of the EBI(s) can be transferred,
the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest to the V-SMF or SMF+PGW-C and
includes in the message EBI value(s) if any that cannot be transferred.
\- The EBI values(s) that cannot be transferred is determined by the AMF if
the target MME does not support 15 EPS bearers, i.e. the AMF determines the
EBI values in range 1-4 as not to be transferred to EPS and if there are still
more than 8 EBI values associated with PDU Sessions, the AMF then determines
EBI value(s) not to be transferred to EPS based on S-NSSAI and ARP as
specified in clause 5.17.2.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
\- The AMF does not retrieve the context for a PDU Session that cannot be
transferred to EPS due to no EBI allocated, or allocated EBIs not
transferrable, or combination of the two.
In non-roaming or LBO roaming, the AMF retrieves context that includes the
mapped EPS Bearer Contexts.
\- The AMF provides in Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest the target MME
capability to the PGW C+SMF in the request to allow the SMF+PGW-C to determine
whether to include EPS Bearer context for Ethernet PDN type or non-IP PDN Type
or not.
\- If the AMF includes in Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest EBI list not to be
transferred and if the EBI value of the QoS Flow associated with the default
QoS Rule is included in that list, the SMF+PGW-C shall not return the PDN
Connection context (which implies the whole PDU Session is not transferred to
EPS), otherwise if the EBI value of the QoS Flow associated with the default
QoS Rule is not included in the EBI list not to be transferred, the V-SMF or
SMF+PGW-C shall not provide the EPS bearer context(s) mapped from QoS Flow(s)
associated with that list.
The above step is performed with all the SMF+PGW-Cs corresponding to PDU
Sessions of the UE which are associated with 3GPP access and have EBI(s)
allocated to them.
In Home Routed roaming, the AMF requests the V-SMF to provide SMF Context by
using Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest.
NOTE 1: The AMF knows the MME capability to support 15 EPS bearers, Ethernet
PDN Type and/or non-IP PDN type or not through local configuration.
5b. For Non-roaming or roaming with local breakout scenario, if the CN Tunnel
Info for EPS bearer(s) have not been allocated before, the SMF sends N4
Session Modification Request to PGW-U+UPF to establish the tunnel for each EPS
bearers and PGW-U+UPF provides the PGW-U Tunnel Info for each EPS bearers to
SMF+PGW-C.
NOTE 2: In home routed roaming case, the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer
has been prepared by the SMF+PGW-C and provided to the V-SMF as specified in
clause 4.11.1.4.1.
5c. For PDU Sessions that are anchored a UPF, in non-roaming or roaming with
local breakout, the SMF+PGW-C returns mapped EPS bearer contexts, which
includes PGW-C control plane tunnel information of the PDN connection
corresponding to the PDU session, EBI for each EPS bearer, PGW-U tunnel
information for each EPS bearer and EPS QoS parameters for each EPS bearer.
For PDU Sessions with PDU Session Type Ethernet, if the UE and target MME
supports Ethernet PDN type, the SMF+PGW-C provides SM Context for Ethernet PDN
Type, otherwise if the UE or target MME does not support Ethernet Type but
support non-IP Type, the SMF+PGW-C provides SM Context for non-IP PDN Type.
For PDU Sessions with PDU Session Type Unstructured, the SMF provides SM
Context for non-IP PDN Type. In home routed roaming, V-SMF provides the SM
Context.
For PDU Sessions that are anchored at an NEF, the SMF returns an SCEF+NEF ID
and an EBI for each PDN connection corresponding to a PDU Session.
If the SMF+PGW-C has marked that the status of one or more QoS Flows are
deleted in the 5GC but not synchronized with the UE yet according to clause
4.3.3.2, the SMF+PGW-C does not return to the AMF the EPS context(s) if all
its associated QoS Flows are marked as deleted, that is, the SMF+PGW-C returns
to the AMF the EPS bearer contexts mapped from QoS Flows where at least one of
the QoS Flow for the EPS bearer is not marked as deleted.
6\. The AMF responds with a Context Response message carrying mapped MM
context (including mapped security context), Return preferred and SM EPS UE
Context (default and dedicated GBR bearers) to the MME. If the verification of
the integrity protection fails, the AMF returns an appropriate error cause.
Return preferred is an optional indication by the AMF of a preferred return of
the UE to the 5GS PLMN at a later access change to a 5GS shared network. The
AMF may start an implementation specific (guard) timer for the UE context.
From the received context and the Tracking Area indicated by the RAN, the MME
can determine whether the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to or from NB-
IoT.
7 - 14. Steps 6-12 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with
Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13] are performed with following addition and
modification:
In the step 10, if the PDU Session (PDN connection) has QoS Flows that do not
have EPS bearer ID(s) assigned, the SMF+PGW-C deletes the PCC rule(s)
associated with those QoS Flows and informs the PCF about the removed PCC
rule(s).
In the step 11, the SMF+PGW-C requests the PGW-U+UPF to establish the tunnel
for each EPS bearer by providing SGW-U Tunnel Info.
In step 10, the SMF+PGW-C may need to report some subscribed event to the PCF
by performing an SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as
defined in clause 4.16.5. If the mapped EPS bearers are not included in Modify
Bearer Request, the SMF+PGW-C deletes the PCC rule(s) associated with the QoS
Flows corresponding to those mapped EPS bearers.
Step 9a from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW
change) in TS 23.401 [13] with the modification captured in clause 4.11.1.5.3
If the SCEF connection is to be established, the steps 9-13 are replaced with
the steps 2-3 from clause 5.13.1.2 of TS 23.682 [23]. The SCEF+NEF ID and the
EBI received from the AMF are included in the Create SCEF Connection Request.
15-15c. The HSS+UDM invokes Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification to notify the
AMF associated with 3GPP access with reason as 5GS to EPS Mobility. If the
timer started in step 6 is not running, the old AMF removes the UE context.
Otherwise, the AMF may remove UE context when the timer expires.
The AMF requests the release of the PDU Session(s) which is associated with
3GPP access and not expected to be transferred to EPC, i.e. AMF requests the
release of:
\- PDU Session(s) whose corresponding SMF+PGW-C(s) are not contacted by AMF
for SM context because the AMF determines that none of EBI(s) for the PDU
Session can be transferred to EPS at step 5a; and
\- PDU Session(s) for which the SM context retrieval failed at step 5c.
The AMF requests the release of the SM context in the V-SMF only and the V-SMF
releases resource in the V-UPF, for Home Routed PDU Session with EBIs
allocated. The 5GC may also keep UE context to allow the use of native
security parameters when UE moves back from EPS to 5GS later.
If PCC is enabled, the AMF initiates AM Policy Association Termination
procedure as defined in clause 4.16.3.2 and UE Policy Association Termination
procedure as defined in clause 4.16.13.1.
Registration associated with the non-3GPP access in the AMF is not removed
(i.e. an AMF that was serving the UE over both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses does
not consider the UE as deregistered over non 3GPP access and will remain
registered and subscribed to subscription data updates in UDM).
When the UE decides to deregister over non-3GPP access or the old AMF decides
not to maintain a UE registration for non-3GPP access anymore, the old AMF
then deregisters from UDM by sending a Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service
operation, unsubscribes from Subscription Data updates by sending an
Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe service operation to UDM and releases all the AMF and AN
resources related to the UE.
16 - 18. Steps 17-21 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with
Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13] with the following modification:
\- The MME may provide the eNodeB with a PLMN list in the Handover Restriction
List taking into account the last used 5GS PLMN ID and the Return preferred
indication. The Handover Restriction List contains a list of PLMN IDs as
specified by clause 5.2a of TS 23.251 [35] for eNodeB functions.
\- The MME may not release the signalling connection with the UE based on the
indication received in the step 1 that the UE is moving from 5GC.
19\. [conditional] Step 19 from clause 4.11.1.2.1 applies.
If some of the QoS Flow(s) for an EPS bearer were marked as deleted, the
SMF+PGW-C may initiate bearer modification as specified in clause 5.4.3 of TS
23.401 [13] to remove the TFT filter(s) corresponding to the Packet Filter
Set(s) in the QoS rules.
##### 4.11.1.3.2A 5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface with data
forwarding
Figure 4.11.1.3.2A-1 describes the idle mode mobility registration procedure
from 5GS to EPS when N26 is supported with data forwarding.
Figure 4.11.1.3.2A-1: 5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface with
data forwarding
1\. Steps 1-7 from clause 4.11.1.3.2 with the following enhancements:
\- The (V-)SMF includes the Buffered DL Data Waiting indication in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Response in step 5c of figure 4.11.1.3.2-1, if the Extended
buffering timer is running in (V-)SMF.
\- The AMF forwards the Buffered DL Data Waiting indication to MME in step 6
of figure 4.11.1.3.2-1, if it\'s received from SMF above.
2\. Steps 7-9 from clause 5.3.3.1A of TS 23.401 [13].
3\. Steps 14, 15, 15a and 16 from clause 4.11.1.3.2.
4\. Steps 10-14 from clause 5.3.3.1A of TS 23.401 [13].
5\. Steps 10a, b, c from clause 4.11.1.2.1 with the following enhancements:
\- If data forwarding tunnel information (i.e. Forwarding F-TEID) is received
from MME in step 14 of figure 5.3.3.1A-1 of TS 23.401 [13] in step 4 above,
the AMF provides the data forwarding tunnel info to (V-)SMF in
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request. The (V-)SMF provides the data
forwarding tunnel info to (V-)UPF if data is buffered in (V-)UPF.
\- The (V-)SMF and (V-)UPF forwards data using the provided SGW forwarding
tunnel above. The (V-)SMF also initiates a timer to release the SM context or
data forwarding tunnel of the PDU session.
The data received by the Serving GW on the forwarding tunnel is forwarded on
the (newly) established tunnel to eNB.
6\. Step 15b from clause 4.11.1.3.2 with following enhancements:
The (V-)SMF initiates the release of data forwarding tunnel after the timer in
step 5 above is expired.
##### 4.11.1.3.3 EPS to 5GS Mobility Registration Procedure (Idle and
Connected State) using N26 interface
Figure 4.11.1.3.3-1 describes the mobility registration procedure from EPS to
5GS when N26 is supported for idle and connected states.
Figure 4.11.1.3.3-1: EPS to 5GS mobility for single-registration mode with N26
interface
1\. The Registration procedure is triggered, e.g. the UE moves into NG-RAN
coverage. Step 2 to 9 except step 5, 6 and 8 follow the Registration procedure
in clause 4.2.2 with following enhancement.
2\. The UE sends Registration Request with registration type set to \"Mobility
Registration Update\".
The UE includes 5G-GUTI mapped from EPS GUTI as the old GUTI, the native
5G-GUTI (if available) as additional GUTI and indicating that the UE is moving
from EPC. The UE includes the UE Policy Container containing the list of PSIs,
indication of UE support for ANDSP and OSId if available.
When the Registration Request is triggered due to UE mobility from EPS to 5GS,
if the UE has locally deleted the EPS bearer which has allocated 5GS
parameters and the EPS bearer status has not been synchronized with the
network, the UE shall include the EPS bearer status in the Registration
Request. If the UE has not received mapped 5GS QoS parameters from the network
for PDN connection(s), the UE locally releases those PDN connection(s).
The Additional GUTI is provided both in Idle state and Connected state, if
available. The Additional 5G-GUTI enables the AMF to retrieve the UE\'s MM
context from the old AMF (if available). The UE includes the S-NSSAIs
associated with the established PDN connections in the Requested NSSAI in RRC
and NAS (as described in clause 5.15.7 of TS 23.501 [2]). In the case of
Configured NSSAI applicable to this PLMN or an Allowed NSSAI are not present
in the UE, the associated HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) shall be provided in the mapping of
Requested NSSAI in the NAS as described in the clause 5.15.5.2.1 TS 23.501
[2].
In the case of idle mode mobility the UE additionally includes a TAU request
message integrity protected using the EPS security context (for further
security verification by the MME) in the Registration Request. If the UE holds
a native 5G-GUTI for this PLMN then the UE also includes the GUAMI part of the
native 5G-GUTI in RRC to enable the NG-RAN to route the Registration Request
to the same AMF (if available) and otherwise the UE provides in RRC signalling
a GUAMI mapped from the EPS GUTI and indicates it as \"Mapped from EPS\".
The UE integrity protects the Registration Request message using a 5G security
context (if available).
3-4. Steps 2-3 of clause 4.2.2.2.2 are performed.
In the case of idle mode mobility, the AMF derives S-NSSAIs values for the
Serving PLMN based on the S-NSSAIs values for the HPLMN, received in NAS
Registration Request, associated with the established PDN connections, the AMF
may send the S-NSSAIs values for the HPLMN to NSSF by invoking
Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation and NSSF provides corresponding
S-NSSAIs values for VPLMN to AMF.
NOTE 1: In connected mode mobility, the AMF devices S-NSSAIs values during the
handover procedure.
Steps 5 and 8 are not performed when this procedure is part of EPS to 5GS
handover.
5a. [Conditional] This step is only performed for IDLE mode mobility. The AMF
derives the MME address and 4G GUTI from the old 5G-GUTI and sends Context
Request to MME including EPS GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI and the TAU request
message according to TS 23.401 [13]. The MME validates the TAU message.
5b. [Conditional] If step 5a is performed, step 5 from clause 5.3.3.1
(Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13] is
performed with the modification captured in clause 4.11.1.5.3.
The AMF converts the received EPS MM Context into the 5GS MM Context. The
received EPS UE context includes IMSI, ME Identity, UE EPS security context,
UE Network Capability and EPS Bearer context(s) and may also include LTE-M
Indication. The MME EPS Bearer context includes for each EPS PDN connection
the IP address and FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C and APN. If
the SCEF connection is invoked, the MME EPS Bearer context includes the
SCEF+NEF ID of the PDN connection, EBI, APN, User Identity. The AMF disregards
any LTE-M Indication received in the EPS UE context and instead takes into
account the LTE M Indication received from NG-RAN, at step 1.
The AMF can determine the whether the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to
or from NB-IoT based on the received \"TAI of last TAU\" in the EPC MM Context
and the RAT Type used for the Registration Request.
If the Context Response includes the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the
SMF+PGW-C, the AMF queries the NRF in serving PLMN by issuing the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request including the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the
SMF+PGW-C and the NRF provides the IP address or FQDN of the N11/N16 interface
of the SMF+PGW-C.
If the Context Response includes an SCEF+NEF ID, the AMF performs the SMF
selection.
The Context Response may include new information Return Preferred. Return
Preferred is an indication by the MME of a preferred return of the UE to the
last used EPS PLMN at a later access change to an EPS shared network. Based on
the Return Preferred indication, the AMF may store the last used EPS PLMN ID
in UE Context.
If the AMF cannot retrieve the address of the corresponding SMF for a PDN
connection, it will not move the PDN connection to 5GS.
Step 6 is performed only if the AMF is different from the old AMF and the old
AMF is in the same PLMN as the AMF.
6a. [Conditional] If the UE includes the 5G-GUTI as Additional GUTI in the
Registration Request message, the AMF sends message to the old AMF. The old
AMF validates the Registration request message.
The AMF retrieves UE\'s SUPI and MM Context, event subscription information by
each consumer NF and the list of SM PDU Session ID/associated SMF ID for the
UE using one of the following three options:
\- AMF may invoke the Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer to the old AMF
identified by the additional 5G-GUTI; or
\- if the old AMF and the AMF are in the same AMF Set and UDSF is deployed,
AMF may invoke Nudsf_UnstructuredDataManagement_Query service operation for
the UE identified by the additional 5G-GUTI from the UDSF; or
\- if the old AMF and the AMF are in the same AMF Set, AMF may use
implementation specific means to share UE context.
6b. [Conditional] If step 6a is performed, the response is performed as
described in step 5 in clause 4.2.2.2.2. If a native 5G security context for
3GPP access is available in the AMF (or has been retrieved in step 6a), the
AMF may continue to use this security context. Otherwise, the AMF shall either
derive a mapped security context from the EPS security context obtained from
the MME or initiate an authentication procedure to the UE.
If the new AMF determines that the UE has emergency PDU Session and the AMF is
configured to allow emergency services for unauthenticated UE, the new AMF
behaves as follows:
\- If the UE has only an emergency PDU Session, the AMF either skips the
authentication and security procedure in step 7 or accepts that the
authentication may fail and continues the Mobility Registration Update
procedure; or
\- If the UE has both emergency and non emergency PDU Sessions and
authentication fails, the AMF continues the Mobility Registration Update
procedure and deactivates all the non-emergency PDU Sessions as specified in
clause 4.3.4.2.
NOTE 2: The new AMF can determine if a PDU Session is used for emergency
service by checking whether the DNN matches the emergency DNN.
7\. [Conditional] If the AMF determines to initiate the authentication
procedure to the UE in step 6b (e.g. the AMF can not obtain the UE MM context
from AMF or other reasons), steps 8-9 of clause 4.2.2.2.2 are optionally
performed.
7a. In the case of idle mode mobility, the AMF decide whether a new AMF needs
to be selected. If a new AMF is to be selected, the AMF reroute the
Registration request to the new AMF as described in clause 4.11.1.3.4, where
the initial AMF refers to the AMF.
8\. [Conditional] If step 5b is performed and the AMF accepts to serve the UE,
the AMF sends Context Acknowledge (Serving GW change indication) to MME
according to TS 23.401 [13].
9\. Steps 11-12 of clause 4.2.2.2.2 are optionally performed.
10\. Void.
11\. Steps 13-14e of clause 4.2.2.2.2 are performed: This includes that if an
MM context is retrieved from the old AMF in step 6 (i.e. corresponding to an
existing UE registration for non-3GPP access in 5GC), then the AMF indicates
to the UDM that the AMF identity to be registered in the UDM applies to both
3GPP and non-3GPP accesses by sending separate/independent
Nudm_UECM_Registration service operations for \"3GPP Access\" and \"non-3GPP
Access\".
12\. Void.
13\. Void.
14-14f. Step 16 of clause 4.2.2.2.2 (AM Policy Association Establishment) is
optionally performed.
In the home-routed roaming case and connected state mobility, based on the
S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN of the PDU Session(s), the AMF decides
whether V-SMF change is needed or not. If the V-SMF reallocation is not needed
and if the two values (i.e. the S-NSSAI value configured in AMF for
interworking and S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN) are different, the AMF
invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (PDU Session ID, S-NSSAI value for the
Serving PLMN). The V-SMF updates 5G AN with the new S-NSSAI of VPLMN by
sending a N2 SM message to 5G AN via AMF. If the V-SMF change is needed, the
AMF performs as the case of I-SMF change defined in clause 4.23.4.3 with the
difference that I-SMF in clause 4.23.4.3 is replaced by V-SMF and with
following modifications:
\- In step 3 of clause 4.23.4.3, the AMF sends indication of no NG-RAN change
to the new V-SMF.
\- In step 4a of clause 4.23.4.3, when the new V-SMF retrieves SM context from
the old V-SMF, the new V-SMF sends indication of no NG-RAN change as it is
received in step 3.
\- In step 4b of clause 4.23.4.3, as the old V-SMF receives the indication of
no NG-RAN change, the old V-SMF returns additional N3 tunnel information of
NG-RAN.
\- In step 6 of clause 4.23.4.3, the new I-SMF should reuse the N3 tunnel
information of NG-RAN received from old I-SMF/SMF.
\- In step 9 of clause 4.23.4.3, when the new V-SMF sends a
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response, the new V-SMF includes PDU Session
Resource Modify in N2 SM information.
In the home-routed roaming case and idle state mobility, the AMF selects a
default V-SMF per PDU Session and invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext
service operation of the V-SMF to create an association with the AMF. It
includes UE EPS PDN Connection, H-SMF ID, S-NSSAI and indicates all the PDU
Session(s) to be re-activated as received in the Registration request message
along with List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. The S-NSSAI is the S-NSSAI
configured in AMF for interworking, which is associated with default V-SMF.
The V-SMF creates the association and based on the received SMF ID, the V-SMF
invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Create request service operation of the H-SMF and
provides the information received from the AMF. Before invoking
PDUSession_Create service operation, the V-SMF request the V-UPF to provide
the CN tunnel info. The subsequent handling is performed as follows:
\- The H-SMF finds the corresponding PDU Session based on the PDN Connection
Context in the request. The H-SMF initiates N4 Session modification procedure
to establish the CN tunnel for the PDU Session. The tunnel info for PDU
Session is allocated by PGW-U+UPF and provided to the SMF+PGW-C. The H-SMF
responds V-SMF with the PDU Session ID corresponding to the PDN Connection
Context in the request, the allocated EBI(s) information, the S-NSSAI of the
PDU Session, S-NSSAI of HPLMN, UE EPS PDN connection(s) and other PDU session
parameters, such as PDU Session Type, Session AMBR in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Create response.
\- The V-SMF updates its SM contexts and returns a
Nsmf_PDU_Session_CreateSMContextResponse message including the information
received from the H-SMF. The V-SMF updates the V-UPF of the CN tunnel info of
SMF+PGW-C. The V-SMF also includes the N2 SM Context in the response message
sent to the AMF if the corresponding PDU Session is in the received List Of
PDU Sessions To Be Activated. The V-SMF stores an association of the PDU
Session ID and the H-SMF ID. The AMF stores the V-SMF ID and it also stores
S-NSSAI and the allocated EBI(s) associated to the PDU Session ID. Based on
the S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN of the PDU Session(s) the AMF decides
whether V-SMF relocation is needed or not. If V-SMF relocation is not needed
and if the two values (i.e. the S-NSSAI value configured in AMF for
interworking and S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN) are different, the AMF
sends the S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN to V-SMF by invoking
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation. The V-SMF updates NG RAN
with the S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN via N2 SM message. If V-SMF
relocation is needed, the AMF performs V-SMF relocation as defined in clause
4.23.4.3.
In non-roaming and LBO cases and idle state mobility, AMF invokes
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request (UE EPS PDN Connection) service
operation of the SMF+PGW-C and indicates all the PDU Session(s) to be re-
activated as received in the Registration request message along with List Of
PDU Sessions To Be Activated. This step is performed for each PDN Connection
and the corresponding SMF+PGW-C address/ID in the UE context the AMF received
in Step 6.
The SMF+PGW-C finds the corresponding PDU Session based on the PDN Connection
Context in the request.
If the P-GW-C+SMF (H-SMF+PGW-C in the case of home-routed roaming case)
determines that session continuity from EPS to 5GS is not supported for the
PDU Session (e.g. if PDU Session ID was not received by the SMF+PGW-C for the
PDN connection or PDU Session ID was received but mapped 5GS parameters were
not provided to the UE due to 5GS interworking not supported), then it does
not provide SM information for the corresponding PDU Session but includes the
appropriate cause code for rejecting the PDU Session transfer within the N2 SM
Information. The PDN connection(s) not further transferred to 5GC are locally
released at the P-GW-C+SMF.
Otherwise if session continuity from EPS to 5GS is supported for the PDU
Session, the SMF+PGW-C finds the corresponding PDU Session based on the PDN
Connection Context in the request. The SMF+PGW-C initiates N4 Session
modification procedure to establish the CN tunnel for the PDU Session and for
Idle state mobility registration, releases the resource of the CN tunnels for
EPS bearers corresponding to the PDU session as well. If the SMF+PGW-C has not
yet registered for this PDU Session ID, the SMF+PGW-C registers with the UDM
using Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, DNN, PDU Session ID) for a given PDU
Session as in step 4 of PDU Session Establishment Procedure in clause 4.3.2.
The tunnel info for PDU Session is allocated by PGW-U+UPF and provided to the
SMF+PGW-C. The SMF+PGW-C updates its SM contexts and returns the AMF a
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response message including the PDU Session ID
corresponding to the PDN Connection Context in the request, the allocated
EBI(s) information, the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session and the N2 SM Context if
the corresponding PDU Session is in the received List Of PDU Sessions To Be
Activated. The AMF stores an association of the PDU Session ID and the SMF ID,
S-NSSAI and the allocated EBI(s) associated to the PDU Session ID. Based on
the allocated EBI(s) information received from all the related SMF+PGW-C for
this UE, an EPS bearer status, which reflects all existing EPS bearer, is
generated by the AMF.
NOTE 3: For Connected State mobility registration, the release of CN tunnels
for EPS bearers and UDM registration for the session corresponding to the PDU
session is performed in the handover execution phase.
If the PDN Type of a PDN Connection in EPS is non-IP and it was originally
established as Ethernet PDU Session when UE was camping in 5GS (known based on
local context information that was set to PDU Session Type Ethernet in UE and
SMF), the PDU Session Type in 5GS shall be set to Ethernet by the SMF and UE.
If the PDN type of a PDN Connection in EPS is non-IP and is locally associated
in UE and SMF to PDU Session Type Unstructured, the PDU Session Type in 5GS
shall be set to Unstructured by the SMF and UE.
NOTE 4: If the non-IP PDN Type is originally established as Ethernet PDU
Session, it means that Ethernet PDN Type is not supported in EPS.
If the AMF has received the EPS Bearer Status in the Registration Request from
UE, the AMF shall send the EPS Bearer Status to all corresponding SMF+PGW-Cs.
If the SMF+PGW-C receives the EPS Bearer Status from AMF, the SMF+PGW-C shall
check whether the EPS bearer(s) has been deleted by UE but not notified to
network. If yes, the SMF+PGW-C shall release those EPS bearer(s), the
corresponding 5G QoS Rule(s) and the QoS Flow level QoS parameters locally.
If the SCEF+NEF ID is provided to the SMF, the SMF establishes the SMF-NEF
connection as described in steps 2-3 from clause 4.25.2, the SMF provides the
SCEF+NEF ID, EBI, APN, User Identity to the SCEF+NEF and the SCEF+NEF updates
the SM contexts and returns the NEF ID, PDU Session ID, DNN and User Identity
to the SMF.
If the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to or from NB-IoT, the (H-)SMF will
maintain, reconnect, release or leave PDU Session handling to the local VPLMN
policy in the case of roaming for each PDU session according to the \"PDU
Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" subscription information. If the
(H-)SMF does not have \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" for a
PDU session, the (H-)SMF retrieves it from the UDM before determining any
action. The SMF may use local policy to determine the handling a PDU Session
if \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" cannot be retrieved from
the UDM.
15 - 16a. HSS+UDM cancels the location of the UE in the MME as defined in
steps 13 - 14 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving
GW change) in TS 23.401 [13]. Subsequently, the steps 18 \- 19 from clause
5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401
[13] are also executed with the following modification:
According to configuration, for the PDN connections which are anchored in a
standalone PGW, the MME initiates PDN connection release procedure as
specified in TS 23.401 [13].
17-18. These steps follow the steps 21, 21b and 22 of Registration procedure
in clause 4.2.2.2.2.
The Registration Accept message shall include the updated 5G-GUTI to be used
by the UE in that PLMN over any access. If the active flag was included in the
Registration request, The AMF may provide NG-RAN with a Mobility Restriction
List taking into account the last used EPS PLMN ID and the Return preferred
indication. The Mobility Restriction List contains a list of PLMN IDs as
specified by TS 23.501 [2]. The Allowed NSSAI in the Registration Accept
message shall contain at least the S-NSSAIs corresponding to the active PDN
Connection(s) and the corresponding mapping to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs.
The AMF shall include the EPS bearer status, which is generated at step 14, in
the Registration Accept message. Based on the received EPS bearer status
information, the UE shall check whether there are QoS Flow(s) existing locally
but no associated EPS bearer(s) in the received EPS bearer status. The UE
shall locally delete the 5G QoS Rule(s) and QoS Flow level QoS parameters of
the QoS Flow(s) if the associated EPS bearer(s) do not exist in the received
EPS bearer status.
##### 4.11.1.3.3A EPS to 5GS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface with data
forwarding
Figure 4.11.1.3.3A-1 describes the idle mode mobility registration procedure
from EPS to 5GS when N26 is supported with data forwarding.
Figure 4.11.1.3.3A-1: EPS to 5GS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface with
data forwarding
1\. Step 1-7 from clause 4.11.1.3.3 with the following enhancements:
\- In step 5b of the figure 4.11.1.3.3-1, if the old MME indicates Buffered DL
Data Waiting in the Context Response (as specified in step 5 of clause
5.3.3.1A in TS 23.401 [13]).
\- For Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, when the DL data is buffered in
old MME and the DL Data Expiration Time has not expired, the old MME shall
discard the buffered DL data (as specified in step of clause 5.3.3.1A in TS
23.401 [13]).
2\. Steps 9-18 from clause 4.11.1.3.3 with following enhancements:
In step 14a of the figure 4.11.1.3.3-1, the AMF forwards the Buffered DL Data
Waiting indication from above to (V-)SMF in Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext
service operation.
If the Buffered DL Data Waiting indication is provided by AMF, the (V-)SMF and
(V-)UPF shall allocate the user plane resource and include the N2 SM
information (i.e. the V-CN Tunnel-Info) in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext
Response towards the AMF in step 14d of the figure 4.11.1.3.3-1 to trigger the
user plane setup in NG-RAN.
NOTE: AMF may send NAS message Registration Accept in step 17 of figure
4.11-1.3.3-1 as part of the N2 message in step 3 below.
3\. AMF to NG-RAN: N2 message (N2 MM information, N2 SM information list).
If N2 SM information is received from SMF in step 2 above, the AMF sends a N2
request message to setup the user plane resource.
NG-RAN performs RRC connection Reconfiguration with the UE to setup the user
plane resource and response to AMF with N2 response message with N2 SM
information.
4\. Steps 11-13 from clause 4.11.1.2.2.2 with the following enhancement:
Based on Buffered DL Data Waiting indication received in step 2 above, the
(V-)SMF and (V-)UPF allocate data forwarding tunnel resource and provide the
CN tunnel information for data forwarding from EPS (i.e. Forwarding F TEID) in
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response to AMF in step 13 of figure
4.11.1.2.2.2-1. The (V-) SMF also starts a timer for release of resources for
data forwarding.
The (V-) SMF may select a different UPF from the serving (V-)UPF for data
forwarding.
The (V-)SMF shall not provide Charging Enforcement Rules and QoS Enforcement
Rules to the (V-)UPF for DL packets that were received via the forwarding
tunnel.
5\. Steps 14-18 from clause 5.3.3.1A in TS 23.401 [13] with following changes.
The AMF sends the Context Acknowledge message to MME as in step 14 of figure
5.3.3.1A-1 of TS 23.401 [13], including the CN tunnel information (i.e.
Forwarding F TEID) for data forwarding from EPS received from (V-)SMF in step
4 above.
The Serving GW forwards the buffered DL data to the (V-)UPF based on the
Forwarding F-TEID received from MME. The data received by the (V-)UPF on the
forwarding F-TEID is forwarded by the (V-)UPF on the (newly) established N3
tunnel to the NG-RAN.
6\. SMF to UPF: N4 Session Termination/Modification.
At the expiration of the timer started in step 4 above, the (V-) SMF starts
the release of resource established in step 4 for data forwarding and informs
the (V-)UPF.
##### 4.11.1.3.4 EPS to 5GS Mobility Registration Procedure (Idle) using N26
interface with AMF reallocation
During Idle state mobility registration procedure from EPS to 5GS, the initial
AMF may select a new AMF based on S-NSSAIs associated with the established PDU
Session, received in NAS Registration Request.
Figure 4.11.1.3.4-1: EPS to 5GS mobility with AMF re-allocation for single-
registration mode and N26 interface configuration
1\. Step 1 to 7 of clause 4.11.1.3.3 in EPS to 5GS mobility using N26
interface is performed.
2\. Step 3 to 4 of clause 4.2.2.2.3 in Registration with AMF reallocation
procedure is performed with the difference that before the Network Slice
selection the AMF needs to derive the S-NSSAI for the serving PLMN as
described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
3\. [Conditional] Initial AMF to MME: Context Acknowledge (failure cause) to
MME according to TS 23.401 [13].
The initial AMF decides a new AMF needs to be reselected. The initial AMF
sends a Context Acknowledge message with cause code indicating that the
procedure is not successful. The MME shall continue as if Context Request was
never received.
4\. Step 6 to 7 of clause 4.2.2.2.3 in Registration with AMF reallocation
procedure are performed.
5\. After receiving the Registration Request message, the new AMF continues
the registration from step 5 until step 18 of figure 4.11.1.3.3 (EPS to 5GS
mobility using N26 procedure), which includes the UE context retrieved from
old AMF. If the 5G security context is received from the initial AMF, the new
AMF continues using that one instead of the mapped 5G security context
retrieved from MME.
#### 4.11.1.4 Procedures for EPS bearer ID allocation
##### 4.11.1.4.1 EPS bearer ID allocation
Following procedures are updated to allocate EPS bearer ID(s) towards EPS
bearer(s) mapped from QoS flow(s) and provide the EPS bearer ID(s) to the NG-
RAN:
\- UE requested PDU Session Establishment (Non-roaming and Roaming with Local
Breakout (clause 4.3.2.2.1) including Request Types \"Initial Request\",
\"Existing PDU Session\", \"Initial emergency request\" and \"Existing
emergency PDU session\".
\- UE requested PDU Session Establishment (Home-routed Roaming (clause
4.3.2.2.2) including Request Types \"Initial Request\" and \"Existing PDU
Session\".
\- UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (non-roaming and roaming
with local breakout) (clause 4.3.3.2).
\- UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (home-routed roaming)
(clause 4.3.3.3).
\- UE Triggered Service Request (clause 4.2.3.2) to move PDU Session(s) from
non-3GPP access to 3GPP access
EBI allocation shall apply to PDU Session via 3GPP access supporting EPS
interworking with N26. EBI allocation shall not apply to PDU Session via 3GPP
access supporting EPS interworking without N26 and shall not apply to PDU
Session via non-3GPP access supporting EPS interworking.
Figure 4.11.1.4.1-1: Procedures for EPS bearer ID allocation
1\. Procedure as listed in this step is initiated as specified in the relevant
clauses of this specification. The relevant steps of the procedure as
specified in the figure above are executed.
2\. If the SMF+PGW-C (or H-SMF in the case of home routed case), determines,
based on the indication of EPS interworking support with N26 as defined in
clauses 4.11.5.2, 4.11.5.3 and 4.11.5.4 and operator policies e.g. User Plane
Security Enforcement information, Access Type, that EPS bearer ID(s) needs to
be assigned to the QoS flow(s) in the PDU Session, SMF+PGW-C invokes
Namf_Communication_EBIAssignment Request (PDU Session ID, ARP list) (via V-SMF
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update in the case of home routed case). When V-SMF receives
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update request from H-SMF for EPS bearer ID allocation
request, V-SMF needs to invoke Namf_Communication_EBIAssignment Request (PDU
Session ID, ARP list). If the SMF+PGW-C (or H-SMF in the case of home-routed
roaming) serves multiple PDU sessions for the same DNN but different S-NSSAIs
for a UE, then the SMF shall only request EBIs for PDU sessions served by a
common UPF (PSA). If different UPF (PSA) are serving those PDU sessions, then
the SMF chooses one of the UPF (PSA) for this determination based on operator
policy. When the PDU session is established via non-3GPP access, the SMF+PGW-C
shall not trigger EBI allocation procedure.
Steps 3 to 6 apply only when AMF needs to revoke EBI previously allocated for
an UE in order to serve a new SMF request of EBI for the same UE.
3\. [Conditional] If the AMF has no available EBIs, the AMF may revoke an EBI
that was assigned to QoS flow(s) based on the ARP(s) and S-NSSAI stored during
PDU Session establishment, EBIs information in the UE context and local
policies. If an assigned EBI is to be revoked, the AMF takes the ARP pre-
emption vulnerability and the ARP priority level into consideration and
revokes EBIs with a higher value of the ARP priority level first. The AMF
invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (EBI(s) to be revoked) to request the
related SMF (called \"SMF serving the released resources\") to release the
mapped EPS QoS parameters corresponding to the EBI to be revoked. The AMF
stores the association of the assigned EBI, ARP pair to the corresponding PDU
Session ID and SMF address.
4\. The \"SMF serving the released resources\" that receives the request in
step 3 shall evaluate if any of the revoked EBI(s) corresponds to the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule. If the revoked EBI corresponds to the
QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, the SMF shall release the
EBI(s) corresponding to all other QoS Flows of the PDU Session and update the
AMF of this release by sending Namf_Communication_EBIAssignment Request (PDU
Session ID, Released EBI List). Next, the SMF shall invoke
Namf_Communication_N1N2Message Transfer (N2 SM information (PDU Session ID,
EBI(s) to be revoked), N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command (PDU
Session ID, EBI(s) to be revoked))) to inform the (R)AN and the UE to remove
the mapped EPS QoS parameters corresponding to the EBI(s) to be revoked. In
home routed roaming scenario, the H-SMF includes EBI(s) to be revoked to V-SMF
to inform V-SMF to remove the mapped EPS bearer context corresponding to the
EBI(s) to be revoked.
NOTE 1: The SMF can also decide to remove the QoS flow if it is not acceptable
to continue the service when no corresponding EPS QoS parameters can be
assigned.
For home routed roaming scenario, the \"SMF serving the released resources\"
sends an N4 Session Modification Request to request the PGW-U+UPF to release
N4 Session corresponding to the revoked EBI(s).
In home routed roaming case, the V-SMF starts a VPLMN initiated QoS
modification for the PDU Session and the Namf_Communication_N1N2Message
Transfer is invoked by the V-SMF based on the corresponding QoS modification
message received from H-SMF.
5\. If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF sends N2 PDU Session Resource
Modify Request (N2 SM information received from SMF, NAS message (PDU Session
ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command))) Message to the (R)AN.
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and an ATC is activated, the AMF updates and
stores the UE context based on the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer and
step 5-6 are skipped. When the UE is reachable, e.g. when the UE enters CM-
CONNECTED state, the AMF forwards the N1 message to synchronize the UE context
with the UE.
6\. The rest steps of the procedure are executed as specified in the figure
above.
7 If the AMF successfully assigns EBI(s), it responds with the assigned
EBI(s). Otherwise, it responds with a cause indicating EBI assignment failure.
If the PDU Session is associated to an S-NSSAI subject for Network Slice-
Specific Authentication and Authorization the AMF should indicate EBI
assignment failure.
If a PDU Session from another SMF already exists towards the same DNN, the AMF
either rejects the EBI assignment request, or revokes the EBI(s) from the
existing PDU Session(s) to the same DNN but different SMFs if the AMF makes
the decision based on the operator policy, that the existing PDU Session
cannot support EPS interworking N26.
The AMF stores the DNN and SMF+PGW-C in which the PDU Session(s) support EPS
interworking to UDM in clause 4.11.1.6.
NOTE 2: The above applies only when the S-NSSAI(s) for the PDU Sessions are
different, otherwise the same SMF is selected for PDU Sessions to the same
DNN.
8\. The SMF+PGW-C sends an N4 Session Establishment/Modification Request to
the PGW-U+UPF.
For home routed roaming scenario, if the EBI is assigned successfully, the
SMF+PGW-C prepares the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer. For non roaming and
LBO scenario, if the EBI is assigned successfully, the SMF+PGW-C may prepare
the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer.
The PGW-U+UPF allocates the PGW-U tunnel info for the EPS bearer and sends it
to the SMF+PGW-C. The PGW-U+UPF is ready to receive uplink packets from
E-UTRAN.
NOTE 3: In the home routed roaming scenario the SMF+PGW-C prepares the CN
Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer and provide it to V-SMF. Thus when the UE move
to EPC network, the V-SMF does not need interact with the SMF+PGW-C to get the
EPS bearer context(s).
9\. If the SMF+PGW-C receives any EBI(s) from the AMF, it adds the received
EBI(s) into the mapped EPS bearer context(s).
In home routed roaming scenario, the SMF+PGW-C generates EPS bearer context
which includes per EPS bearer PGW-U tunnel information. In addition, if the
default EPS bearer is generated for the corresponding PDN Connection of PDU
Session (i.e. during the PDU Session establishment procedure), the SMF+PGW-C
generates the PGW-C tunnel information of the PDN connection and include it in
UE EPS PDN connection.
9a. [Conditional] In non-roaming or LBO scenario, the SMF+PGW-C includes the
mapped EPS bearer context(s) and the corresponding QoS Flow(s) to be sent to
the UE in the N1 SM container. SMF+PGW-C also indicates the mapping between
the QoS Flow(s) and mapped EPS bearer context(s) in the N1 SM container.
SMF+PGW-C also includes the mapping between the received EBI(s) and QFI(s)
into the N2 SM information to be sent to the NG-RAN. The SMF+PGW-C sends the
N1 SM container and N2 SM information to AMF via the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response in the case of the PDU Session
Modification procedure triggered by UE or AN, or UE Triggered Service Request
procedure that results in session transfer from N3GPP to 3GPP, otherwise, via
the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.
9b [Conditional] In home routed roaming scenario, the SMF+PGW-C sends mapped
EPS bearer context(s), the mapping between the received EBI(s) and QFI(s),
linked EBI and EPS bearer context(s) to V-SMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_Create
Response in the case of PDU Session Establishment, or via
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request in the case of PDU Session Modification. The
V-SMF stores the EPS bearer context(s) and generates N1 SM container and N2 SM
information and forwards them to AMF via the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
Response in the case of the PDU Session Modification procedure triggered by UE
or AN, or UE Triggered Service Request procedure that results in session
transfer from N3GPP to 3GPP, otherwise, via the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.
10\. The N1 SM container and N2 SM information are sent to the UE and NG-RAN
respectively. The relevant steps of the procedure as specified in the figure
above are executed.
##### 4.11.1.4.2 EPS bearer ID transfer
Following procedures are updated to transfer EPS bearer ID(s) allocation
information to target AMF.
\- step 14d in figure 4.11.1.3.3-1 in EPS to 5GS Idle mode mobility with N26
(clause 4.11.1.3.3).
\- step 7 in figure 4.11.1.2.2.2-1 in EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface
prepare phase (clause 4.11.1.2.2.2).
Figure 4.11.1.4.2-1: Procedures for EPS bearer IDs transfer
1\. The AMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request message to the
SMF in above case;
2\. The SMF+PGW-C to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response with the
allocated EBI information.
##### 4.11.1.4.3 EPS bearer ID revocation
Following procedures are updated to revoke the EPS bearer ID(s) assigned to
the QoS flow(s):
\- UE or network requested PDU Session Release for Non-roaming and Roaming
with Local Breakout (clause 4.3.4.2).
\- UE or network requested PDU Session Release for Home-routed Roaming (clause
4.3.4.3).
\- UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (non-roaming and roaming
with local breakout) (clause 4.3.3.2).
\- UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (home-routed roaming)
(clause 4.3.3.3).
\- Handover of a PDU Session procedure from 3GPP to untrusted non-3GPP access
(non-roaming and roaming with local breakout) (clause 4.9.2.2)
\- Handover of a PDU Session procedure from 3GPP to untrusted non-3GPP access
(home routed roaming) (clause 4.9.2.4
When the PDU Session is released as described in clauses 4.3.4.2 or 4.3.4.3,
4.9.2.2, or 4.9.2.4 and the SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify to notify
AMF that the SM context for this PDU Session is released, the AMF releases the
association between the SMF ID and the PDU Session ID and releases the EBIs
assigned for this PDU Session. When all the PDU sessions which are allocated
with EBIs are released in the same SMF, the AMF may revoke DNN and SMF+PGW-C
FQDN for S5/S8 interface in the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Update service operation.
NOTE 1: If the SMF+PGW-C in which the PDU sessions support EPS interworking is
changed for the same DNN, the AMF can update the DNN and new SMF+PGW-C FQDN
for S5/S8 interface in the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Update service operation.
When the UE initiates a PDU Session Modification as described in clauses
4.3.3.2 or 4.3.3.3 and the SMF needs to release the assigned EBI from a QoS
flow (e.g. when the QoS flow is released), the SMF can indicate the Released
EBI list in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response to the AMF. The AMF
releases the corresponding EBI allocation for this PDU Session.
When the AMF decides to revoke some EBI(s), e.g. when the AMF receives a new
EBI allocation request but there is no EBI available, the AMF may decide to
revoke EBI(s) for another PDU Session, the AMF initiates a PDU Session
Modification as described in clauses 4.3.3.2 or 4.3.3.3 and includes EBI list
to be revoked in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request. The SMF releases
the indicated EBI(s) for the PDU Session.
When the AMF initiates a PDU Session Modification as described in clauses
4.3.3.2 or 4.3.3.3 to change the status of EPS interworking with N26 to \"not
supported\", the AMF releases the EBIs assigned for this PDU Session and SMF
release the assigned EBIs from the QoS Flows belonging to this PDU Session.
When the SMF initiates a PDU Session Modification as described in clauses
4.3.3.2 or 4.3.3.3 and the SMF needs to release the assigned EBI from a QoS
flow (e.g. when the QoS flow is released), the SMF invokes
Namf_Communication_EBIAssignment and indicates the Released EBI list to the
AMF. The AMF releases the corresponding EBI allocation for this PDU Session.
When the handover of a PDU Session procedure from 3GPP to untrusted non-3GPP
access is performed in clause 4.9.2.2 or clause 4.9.2.4.1, the AMF, the SMF
and the UE releases locally the EBI(s) allocated for this PDU Session.
When the handover of a PDU Session procedure from 3GPP to untrusted non-3GPP
access is performed in clause 4.9.2.4.2, the H-SMF invokes
Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify to notify V-AMF to release the association
between the SMF ID and the PDU Session ID and, as a result, the EBI(s)
assigned for this PDU Session are released. The UE releases locally the EBI(s)
allocated for this PDU Session.
#### 4.11.1.5 Impacts to EPS Procedures
##### 4.11.1.5.1 General
This clause captures changes to procedures in TS 23.401 [13] due to
interworking with 5GS based on N26. The handover procedures between EPS and
5GS captured in clause 4.11.1.2 capture impacts to clause 5.5.1.2.2 of TS
23.401 [13] (S1-based handover, normal).
##### 4.11.1.5.2 E-UTRAN Initial Attach
The E-UTRAN Initial Attach Procedure specified in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401
[13] is impacted as shown in Figure 4.11.1.5.2-1 when interworking with 5GS
using N26 interface is supported.
Figure 4.11.1.5.2-1: Impacts to E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure
1\. The UE sends an Attach Request message as specified in TS 23.401 [13] with
the following modifications:
\- If the UE was previously registered in 5GS, the UE provides in Access
Stratum signalling a GUMMEI mapped from the 5G-GUTI and indicates it as a
native GUMMEI and should in addition indicate it as \"Mapped from 5G-GUTI\".
\- If the UE was previously registered in 5GS, the UE provides, in the Attach
Request message, an EPS GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI sent as old Native GUTI and
indicates that it is moving from 5GC. The UE integrity protects the Attach
Request message using the 5G security context.
\- A UE that supports 5GC NAS procedures shall indicate its support of 5G NAS
as part of its UE Core Network Capability IE.
\- If the UE includes ESM message container for PDN Connection Establishment
and the Request type is \"initial request\", the UE shall allocate a PDU
Session ID and include it in the PCO. The PDU Session ID shall be unique
across all other PDN connections of the UE.
\- MME may steer the UE from EPC by rejecting the Attach request with an
appropriate cause value. If the UE supports any of the CIoT 5GS Optimisations
included in 5GC Preferred Network Behaviour, then the UE shall include its 5GC
Preferred Network Behaviour if it included its EPC Preferred Network Behaviour
in the Attach request. The MME should take into account availability of 5GC to
the UE and the Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour (see clause 5.31.2 of
TS 23.501 [2]) before steering the UE from EPC.
2\. The relevant steps of the procedure as specified in the figure above are
executed with the following modification:
\- The HSS/UDM on receiving Update Location Request from MME, de-register any
old AMF by sending an Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification service operation
to the registered AMF for 3GPP access.
\- Step 7 and step 10 as specified in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13] (i.e.
IP-CAN Session Termination) is replaced by SM Policy Association Termination
procedure as specified in clause 4.16.6.
\- Step 14 as specified in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13] (i.e. IP-CAN
Session Establishment/Modification) are replaced by SM Policy Association
Establishment/Modification procedure as specified in clause 4.16.4 and clause
4.16.5.
3\. Step 15 as specified in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13] with the
following modification:
\- The SMF+PGW-C allocates 5G QoS parameters corresponding to PDN connection,
e.g. Session AMBR, QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for
the QoS Flow associated with the QoS rule(s) and then includes them in PCO.
4\. The relevant steps of the procedure as specified in the figure above are
executed.
5\. Step 18 as specified in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13] with the
following modification:
\- The 5G QoS parameters for the PDU session and for the QoS Flow associated
with the default QoS rule are stored in the UE.
6\. The relevant steps of the procedure as specified in the figure above are
executed.
##### 4.11.1.5.3 Tracking Area Update
The following changes are applied to clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking area update
procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13]:
\- Step 2: The UE shall in Access Stratum signalling include GUMMEI that is
mapped from 5G-GUTI following the mapping rules specified in TS 23.501 [2] and
the UE indicates it as a native GUMMEI and should in addition indicate it as
\"Mapped from 5G-GUTI\". The UE shall, in the TAU request message, include EPS
GUTI that is mapped from 5G-GUTI following the mapping rules specified in TS
23.501 [2]. The UE indicates that it is moving from 5GC. The UE integrity
protects the TAU request message using the 5G security context. If the UE
supports any of the CIoT 5GS Optimisations included in 5GC Preferred Network
Behaviour, then the UE shall include its 5GC Preferred Network Behaviour if it
included its EPC Preferred Network Behaviour in the TAU request.
MME may steer the UE from EPC by rejecting the TAU request with an appropriate
cause value. The MME should take into account availability of 5GC to the UE
and the Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour (see clause 5.31.2 of TS
23.501 [2]) before steering the UE from EPC.
\- Step 5 and message Context Response may include new information Return
preferred.
Return preferred is an indication by the AMF of a preferred return of the UE
to the last used 5GS PLMN at a later access change to a 5GS shared network.
The MME may store the last used 5GS PLMN ID in UE\'s MM Context.
The MME may provide E-UTRAN with a Handover Restriction List taking into
account the last used 5GS PLMN ID and the Return Preferred indication. The
Handover Restriction List contains a list of PLMN IDs as specified by TS
23.251 [35].
\- Step 9a IPâ€‘CAN Session Modification procedure:
It is replaced by SM Policy Association Modification as specified in clause
4.16.5.
\- Step 13 and HSS use of Cancel Location
The HSS/UDM de-registers any old AMF node by sending an
Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification service operation to the registered AMF
for 3GPP access. The registered AMF for 3GPP access initiates AM Policy
Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.3.2 and UE Policy
Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.13.1.
\- Step 17: If the DNN and SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 interface association
exist, the HSS/UDM sends APN mapped form DNN and SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 to
UE.
\- Step 20 and MME processing of the partial Tracking Area Update (TAU)
procedure.
The MME may use an indication Return preferred from Context Response at step 6
when deciding the PLMN list content.
The MME may provide the eNodeB with a PLMN list. The Handover Restriction List
contains a list of PLMN IDs as specified by TS 23.501 [2].
##### 4.11.1.5.4 Session Management
##### 4.11.1.5.4.1 PDN Connection Request {#pdn-connection-request .H6}
The UE Requested PDN Connectivity Procedure specified in clause 5.10.2 of TS
23.401 [13] is impacted as shown in in Figure 4.11.1.5.4.1-1 when interworking
with 5GS is supported.
Figure 4.11.1.5.4.1-1: Impacts to UE Requested PDN Connectivity Procedure
1\. UE sends a PDN connectivity Request to the MME as specified in step 1 in
clause 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [13] with the following modification:
\- If the UE is 5G NAS capable and the Request type is \"initial request\",
the UE shall allocate a PDU Session ID and include it in the PCO. The PDU
Session ID shall be unique across all other PDN connections of the UE.
2\. The relevant steps of the procedure as specified in the figure above are
executed. In step 4 of TS 23.401 [13], IP Session Establishment/Modification
procedure is replaced by SM Policy Association Establishment/Modification
procedure as specified in clauses 4.16.4 and 4.16.5.
3\. Step 6 as specified in clause 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [13] is executed with
the following modification:
\- If the SMF+PGW-C accepts to provide interworking of the PDN connection with
5GC, the SMF+PGW-C shall allocate 5G QoS parameters corresponding to PDN
connection, e.g. Session AMBR, QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if
needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) and then include
them in PCO.
\- If the SMF+PGW-C accepts to provide interworking of the PDN connection with
5GC, the SMF+PGW-C shall determine the S-NSSAI associated with the PDN
connection based on the operator policy and send the S-NSSAI together with the
PLMN ID to the UE in the PCO.
\- If the SMF+PGW-C accepts to provide interworking of the PDN connection with
5GC the SMF+PGW-C, if Small Data Rate Control is used, provides the Small Data
Rate Control parameters to the UE in the PCO.
4\. The relevant steps of the procedure as specified in the figure above are
executed.
5\. Step 8 as specified in clause 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [13] with the following
modification:
\- If 5G QoS parameters are included in the PCO, the UE shall store them. If
5G QoS parameters are not included in the PCO, the UE shall note that session
continuity for this PDN connection on mobility to 5G is not provided by the
network.
\- If the S-NSSAI and the PLMN ID associated with the PDN connection are
included in the PCO, the UE shall store them.
\- If the Small Data Rate Control parameters are included in the PCO, the UE
shall store them.
6\. The relevant steps of the procedure as specified in the figure above are
executed.
##### 4.11.1.5.4.2 UE or MME Requested PDN Disconnection {#ue-or-mme-
requested-pdn-disconnection .H6}
The procedure as specified in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.401 [13] applies with the
following modification:
Step 8. (RRC Connection Reconfiguration): On receiving the NAS Deactivate EPS
Bearer Context Request(LBI) message, if the UE has mapped 5G parameters for
the PDU session, the UE deletes the corresponding mapped 5GS PDU session.
In addition if the SMF+PGW-C has registered to HSS+UDM for this PDN connection
before, the SMF+PGW-C invokes the Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation
to notify the UDM to remove the association between the SMF+PGW-C identity and
the associated DNN and PDU Session Id as described in the step 12 of clause
4.3.4.2. If there is no PDN connection for the associated (DNN, S-NSSAI)
handled by the SMF+PGW-C, the SMF+PGW-C unsubscribes from Session Management
Subscription data changes notification with the HSS+UDM by means of the
Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI) service operation as described in
step 12 of clause 4.3.4.2.
##### 4.11.1.5.4.3 Dedicated Bearer Activation, Bearer Modification and Bearer
Deactivation {#dedicated-bearer-activation-bearer-modification-and-bearer-
deactivation .H6}
The procedures specified in clauses 5.4.1 through 5.4.5 of TS 23.401 [13]
apply with the following modifications:
\- PCRF initiated IP-CAN Modification in TS 23.401 [13] is replaced with PCF
initiated SM Policy Association Modification as specified in clause 4.16.5.2.
PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification/Termination TS 23.401 [13] is
replaced with SM Policy Association Modification/Termination as specified in
clauses 4.16.5 and 4.16.6.
\- In the step where the PDN-GW sends a Create Bearer Request, i.e.
\- Step 2 in clause 5.4.1 of TS 23.401 [13] (Dedicated Bearer Activation)
the PCO includes mapped 5GS QoS parameters for the EPS bearer being created.
\- In the step where the PDN-GW sends an Update Bearer Request, i.e.:
\- Step 2 in clause 5.4.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13] (PDN GW initiated bearer
modification with bearer QoS update)
\- Step 5 in clause 5.4.2.2 of TS 23.401 [13] (HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS
Modification)
\- Step 2 in clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.401 [13] (PDN GW initiated bearer
modification without bearer QoS update) if TFT or APN-AMBR is being modified
the PCO includes the modification to the mapped 5GS QoS parameters, if
impacted by the modification, corresponding to the EPS bearer being modified.
\- In the step where the UE receives the NAS Session Management message from
the MME which contains the PCO relayed via the MME, i.e.:
\- Step 5 in clause 5.4.1 of TS 23.401 [13] (Dedicated Bearer Activation)
\- Step 5 in clause 5.4.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13] (PDN GW initiated bearer
modification with bearer QoS update)
\- Step 5 in clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.401 [13] (PDN GW initiated bearer
modification without bearer QoS update) if TFT or APN-AMBR is being modified
the UE updates the mapped 5G QoS parameters as included in the PCO from the
PDN-GW.
\- In the step where the UE receives EPS bearer request message, i.e
\- Step 5 in clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.401 [13] (PDN GW initiated bearer
deactivation)
the UE also deletes the mapped 5GS QoS flow and its associated parameter.
##### 4.11.1.5.5 5GS to EPS handover using N26 interface
In step 3 of clause 4.11.1.2.1, the Forward Relocation Request may include new
information Return Preferred.
Return Preferred is an indication by the AMF of a preferred return of the UE
to the last used 5GS PLMN at a later access change to a 5GS shared network.
The MME may store the last used 5GS PLMN ID in UE\'s MM Context.
The MME may provide E-UTRAN with a Handover Restriction List taking into
account the last used 5GS PLMN ID and the Return Preferred indication. The
Handover Restriction List contains a list of PLMN IDs as specified by TS
23.251 [35].
##### 4.11.1.5.6 UE triggered Service Request
The following changes are applied to clause 5.3.4.1 (UE triggered Service
Request) in TS 23.401 [13]:
\- Step 4: MME may steer the UE from EPC by rejecting the service request with
an appropriate cause value. The MME should take into account availability of
5GC to the UE and the Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour (see clause
5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) before steering the UE from EPC.
##### 4.11.1.5.7 Establishment of S1-U bearer during Data Transport in Control
Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation
The following changes are applied to clause 5.3.4B.4 (Establishment of S1-U
bearer during Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation) in TS
23.401 [13]:
\- Step 3: MME may steer the UE from EPC by rejecting the Control Plane
Service Request with an appropriate cause value. The MME should take into
account availability of 5GC to the UE and the Preferred and Supported Network
Behaviour (see clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) before steering the UE from
EPC.
#### 4.11.1.6 EPS interworking information storing Procedure
Depending on the operator\'s configuration, the AMF serving the 3GPP access
store DNN and SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 interface in the UDM using
Nudm_UECM_Update service operation when N26 is deployed.
### 4.11.2 Interworking procedures without N26 interface
#### 4.11.2.1 General
Clause 4.11.2 defines the procedures to support interworking between 5GS and
EPS without any N26 interface between AMF and MME.
During interworking from EPS to 5GS, as the SMF+PGW-C may have different IP
addresses when being accessed over S5/S8 and N11/N16 respectively, the AMF
shall discover the SMF instance by an NF/NF service discovery procedure using
the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface received from the UDM as a query parameter.
This is required for both non-roaming and roaming with local breakout, as well
as for home routed roaming.
NOTE: As the AMF is not aware of the S-NSSAI assigned for the PDN Connection,
the NF/NF service discovery used to find the SMF instance can use PLMN level
NRF.
#### 4.11.2.2 5GS to EPS Mobility
The following procedure is used by UEs in single-registration or dual
registration mode on mobility from 5GS to EPS.
In the case of network sharing the UE selects the target PLMN ID according to
clause 5.18.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
Figure 4.11.2.2-1: Mobility procedure from 5GS to EPS without N26 interface
The UE operating in single-registration mode can start the procedure from Step
1 or Step 5. The UE operating in dual-registration mode starts the procedure
from Step 5.
NOTE 1: The network has indicated the \" Interworking without N26\" to the UE.
To support IP address preservation, the UE in single-registration mode starts
the procedure from Step 5. If the UE in single-registration mode starts the
procedure from Step 1, the IP address preservation is not provided.
0\. UE is registered in 5GS and established PDU sessions. The FQDN for the
S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C is also stored in the UDM by the SMF+PGW-C
during PDU Session setup in addition to what is specified in clause 4.3.2.2.1
and clause 4.3.2.2.2.
NOTE 2: At 5GS to EPS mobility, the MME use the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface
of the SMF+PGW-C to find the SMF+PGW-C and when UE moves back from EPS to 5GS,
the AMF uses FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C to find the
SMF+PGW-C.
1\. Step 1 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in TS 23.401 [13].
2\. Step 2 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in TS 23.401 [13] with
the following modifications:
The UE shall provide a EPS-GUTI that is mapped from the 5G-GUTI following the
mapping rules specified in TS 23.501 [2]. The UE indicates that it is moving
from 5GC.
3\. Step 3 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in TS 23.401 [13].
4\. If the MME determined that the old node is an AMF based on UE\'s GUTI
mapped from 5G-GUTI and the MME is configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking
without N26 procedure, the MME sends a TAU Reject to the UE.
5\. Step 1 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401 [13]
with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.
6\. Step 2 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401 [13].
7\. Steps 4-7 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401 [13],
with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.
8\. Step 8 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401 [13],
with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.
9\. Step 11 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401 [13],
with the following modifications:
The subscription profile the MME receives from HSS+UDM includes per DNN/APN at
most one SMF+PGW-C FQDN as described in in clause 5.17.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
10\. Steps 12-24 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401
[13], with the modifications as described in clause 4.11.2.4.1.
11\. Step 25 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401 [13].
12\. Step 26 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401 [13].
13\. If the UE has remaining PDU Sessions in 5GS which it wants to transfer to
EPS and maintain the same IP address/prefix, the UE performs the UE requested
PDN Connectivity Procedure as specified in clause 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [13] and
sets the Request Type to \"handover\" in Step 1 of the procedure with
modification captured in clause 4.11.2.4.2. UE provides an APN and the PDU
Session ID corresponding to the PDU Session it wants to transfer to EPS. The
UE provides the PDU Session ID in PCO as described in clause 4.11.1.1.
UEs in single-registration mode performs this step for each PDU Session
immediately after completing the E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. UEs in
dual-registration mode may perform this step any time after the completing of
E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. Also, UEs in dual-registration mode may
perform this step only for a subset of PDU Sessions.
The MME determines the SMF+PGW-C address for the Create Session Request based
on the APN received from the UE and the subscription profile received from the
HSS+UDM in Step 9 or when the HSS+UDM notifies the MME for the new SMF+PGW-C
ID in the updated subscription profile.
The SMF+PGW-C uses the PDU Session ID to correlate the transferred PDN
connection with the PDU Session in 5GC.
As a result of the procedure the PGW-U+UPF starts routing DL data packets to
the Serving GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers established for
this PDN connection.
14\. For Non-Roaming case and Roaming with Local Breakout, the SMF+PGW-C
initiates release of the PDU Session(s) in 5GS transferred to EPS as specified
in clause 4.3.4.2 with the following clarification:
\- In step 2, the SMF+PGW-C shall not release IP address/prefix(es) allocated
for the PDU Session;
\- If UP connection of the PDU Session is not active, step 3b is not executed,
thus the steps triggered by step 3b are not executed;
If UP connection of the PDU Session is active, the SMF invokes the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation in step 3b without
including N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command);
\- In step 11, Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify service operation invoked
by the SMF to notify AMF that the SM context for this PDU Session is released
due to handover to EPS.
For Home Routed roaming, the SMF+PGW-C initiates release of the PDU Session(s)
in 5GS transferred to EPS as specified in clause 4.3.4.3 with the following
clarification:
\- In step 3a, the H-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation
without including N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command);
\- In step 16a, Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify operation invoked by H-SMF to
notify the V-SMF that the PDU session context is released due to handover to
EPS;
\- In step 16b, Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify service operation invoked
by the V-SMF to notify AMF that the SM context for this PDU Session is
released due to handover to EPS.
#### 4.11.2.3 EPS to 5GS Mobility
The following procedure is used by UEs in single-registration mode on mobility
from EPS to 5GS.
In the case of network sharing the UE selects the target PLMN ID according to
clause 5.18.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
This procedure is also used by UEs in dual-registration mode to perform
registration in 5GS when the UE is also registered in EPC. The procedure is
the General Registration procedure as captured in clause 4.2.2. Difference
from that procedure are captured below.
The UE has one or more ongoing PDN connections including one or more EPS
bearers. During the PDN connection establishment, the UE allocates the PDU
Session ID and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C via PCO, as described in clause
4.11.1.1.
Figure 4.11.2.3-1: Mobility procedure from EPS to 5GS without N26 interface
0\. The UE is attached in EPC as specified in clause 4.11.2.4.1.
1\. Step 1 in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration) with the following
clarifications:
The UE indicates that it is moving from EPC. The UE in single registration
mode provides the Registration type set to \"mobility registration update\", a
5G-GUTI mapped from the 4G-GUTI and a native 5G-GUTI (if available) as an
Additional GUTI. The UE includes the UE Policy Container containing the list
of PSIs, indication of UE support for ANDSP and OSId if available. The UE
shall select the 5G-GUTI for the additional GUTI as follows, listed in
decreasing order of preference:
\- a native 5G-GUTI assigned by the PLMN to which the UE is attempting to
register, if available;
\- a native 5G-GUTI assigned by an equivalent PLMN to the PLMN to which the UE
is attempting to register, if available;
\- a native 5G-GUTI assigned by any other PLMN, if available.
The UE in dual registration mode provides the Registration type set to
\"initial registration\" and a native 5G-GUTI or SUCI. In single registration
mode, the UE also includes at least the S-NSSAIs (with values for the Serving
PLMN) associated with the established PDN connections in the Requested NSSAI
in RRC Connection Establishment.
2\. Step 2 as in clause 4.2.2.2.
3\. Step 3 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration), with the following
modifications:
If the Registration type is \"mobility registration update\" and the UE
indicates that it is moving from EPC in step 1 and the AMF is configured to
support 5GS-EPS interworking procedure without N26 interface, the AMF treats
this registration request as \"initial Registration\" and the AMF skips the
PDU Session status synchronization.
NOTE 1: The UE operating in single registration mode includes the PDU Session
IDs corresponding to the PDN connections to the PDU Session status.
If the UE has provided a 5G-GUTI mapped from 4G-GUTI in step 1 and the AMF is
configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking procedure without N26 interface,
the AMF does not perform steps 4 and 5 in clause 4.2.2.2 (UE context transfer
from the MME).
4\. Steps 4-13 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration), with the
following modifications:
If the UE has included an additional GUTI in the Registration Request, then
the new AMF attempts to retrieve the UE\'s security context from the old AMF
in steps 4 and 5.
If the UE\'s security context is not available in the old AMF or if the UE has
not provided an additional GUTI then the AMF retrieves the SUCI from the UE in
steps 6 and 7.
5\. Step 14 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration), with the following
modifications:
If the UE indicates that it is moving from EPC and the Registration type is
set to \"initial registration\" or \"mobility registration update\" in step 1
and AMF is configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking without N26 procedure,
the AMF sends an Nudm_UECM_Registration Request message to the HSS+UDM
indicating that registration of an MME at the HSS+UDM, if any, shall not be
cancelled. The HSS+UDM does not send cancel location to the old MME.
NOTE 2: If the UE does not maintain registration in EPC, upon reachability
time-out, the MME can implicitly detach the UE and release the possible
remaining PDN connections in EPC.
The subscription profile the AMF receives from HSS+UDM includes the DNN/APN
and SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 interface for each PDN connection established in
EPC. For emergency PDU Session, the AMF receives Emergency Information
containing SMF+PGW-C FQDN from HSS+UDM.
6\. Steps 15-19c as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration).
7\. Step 21 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration) with the following
modifications:
The AMF includes an \"Interworking without N26\" indicator to the UE.
If the UE had provided PDU Session Status information in step 1, the AMF Sets
the PDU Session Status to not synchronized.
8\. Step 22 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration)
9\. UE requested PDU Session Establishment procedure as in clause 4.3.2.2.1.
If the UE had setup PDN Connections in EPC which it wants to transfer to 5GS
and maintain the same IP address/prefix and the UE received \"Interworking
without N26\" indicator in step 7, the UE performs the UE requested PDU
Session Establishment Procedure as in clause 4.3.2.2 and sets the Request Type
to \"Existing PDU Session\" or \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\" in step 1 of
the procedure. The UE provides a DNN for non-emergency PDU Session, the PDU
Session ID and S-NSSAI corresponding to the existing PDN connection it wants
to transfer from EPS to 5GS. The S-NSSAI is set as described in clause
5.15.7.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
If the Request Type indicates \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the AMF
shall use the Emergency Information received from the HSS+UDM which contains
SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 interface for the emergency PDN connection
established in EPS and the AMF shall use the S-NSSAI locally configured in
Emergency Configuration Data.
UEs in single-registration mode performs this step for each PDN connection
immediately after the step 8. UEs in dual-registration mode may perform this
step any time after step 8. Also, UEs in dual-registration mode may perform
this step only for a subset of PDU Sessions. The AMF determines the S5/S8
interface of the SMF+PGW-C for the PDU Session based on the DNN received from
the UE and the SMF+PGW-C ID in the subscription profile received from the
HSS+UDM in step 5 or when the HSS+UDM notifies the AMF for the new SMF+PGW-C
ID in the updated subscription profile. The AMF queries the NRF in serving
PLMN by issuing the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request including the FQDN for the S5/S8
interface of the SMF+PGW-C and the NRF provides the IP address or FQDN of the
N11/N16 interface of the SMF+PGW-C. The AMF invokes the
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext service with the SMF address provided by the
NRF. The AMF includes the PDU Session ID to the request sent to the SMF+PGW-C.
The SMF+PGW-C uses the PDU Session ID to determine the correct PDU Session.
After step 16a of Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1, user plane is
switched from EPS to 5GS.
As specified clause 4.3.2.2, if the SMF has not yet registered for the PDU
Session ID, then the SMF registers with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration
(SUPI, DNN, PDU Session ID) and if Session Management Subscription data for
corresponding SUPI, DNN and S-NSSAI is not available, then SMF retrieves the
Session Management Subscription data using Nudm_SDM_Get (SUPI, Session
Management Subscription data, DNN, S-NSSAI) and subscribes to be notified when
this subscription data is modified using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe (SUPI, Session
Management Subscription data, DNN, S-NSSAI).
NOTE 3: The SMF can, instead of the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, use the
Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report Indication that
triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed data if the
corresponding feature is supported by both the SMF and the UDM.
10\. The SMF+PGW-C performs release of the resources in EPC for the PDN
connections(s) transferred to 5GS by performing the PDN GW initiated bearer
deactivation procedure as defined in clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.401 [13], except
the steps 4-7.
#### 4.11.2.4 Impacts to EPS Procedures
##### 4.11.2.4.1 E-UTRAN Attach
Impact on clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13] from adding support for the
optional network functionality dual registration mode:
\- Step 1:
The UE constructs the Attach Request message according to the following
principles:
\- If UE operates in single-registration mode, the UE indicates that it is
moving from 5GC and provides a native 4G-GUTI or a 4G-GUTI mapped from 5G GUTI
(indicated as native GUTI), if available, otherwise the IMSI, or
\- If the UE operates in dual-registration mode, the UE indicates that it is
moving from 5GC and provides native 4G-GUTI, or
\- If the UE sent a TAU in step 2 and it was rejected because the MME could
not derive the UE identity, the UE provides IMSI.
If the UE wants to transfer a PDU Session to EPC as part of the Attach
procedure, it includes a PDN CONNECTIVITY Request message in the Attach
Request and provides a Request type \"Handover\", DNN/APN and PDU Session ID
of the PDU Session (clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13]). The UE provides the PDU
Session ID in PCO as described in clause 4.11.1.1. For PDU Session of Ethernet
Type, if the UE and the network support Ethernet PDN Type in EPS which is
negotiated during PDU Session Establishment as described in clause 4.11.5, the
UE includes PDN Type Ethernet in PDN CONNECTIVITY Request message.
If the TAU was rejected in step 2 the IP address preservation is not provided.
In this case the UE provides IMSI in the Attach Request and does not provide a
Request Type \"Handover\" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY Request if included in the
Attach Request.
The UE provides an EPS bearer ID for all mapped EPS bearers in the EPS bearer
status. For the initial Attach Request the EPS bearer status is empty.
NOTE 1: The UE is aware the network is configured to support 5GS-EPS
interworking without N26 procedure. The UE does not include the EPS bearer IDs
corresponding to the 5G QoS flows to the EPS bearer status.
If the UE supports 5GC NAS procedures (see clause 5.17.2 of TS 23.501 [2]),
then the UE shall indicate its support of 5G NAS in a NAS indicator.
\- Step 3:
If the UE provided a 4G-GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI and the MME is configured to
support 5GS-EPS interworking without N26 procedure, the MME does not perform
step 3, Identification Request to old MME/SGSN/AMF in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS
23.401 [13].
NOTE 2: As the 4G-GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI is unknown identity to the MME, the
MME sends an Identity Request to the UE to request the IMSI. The UE responds
with Identity Response (IMSI).
\- Step 8:
If the UE indicates that it is moving from 5GC (Attach Request) and the MME is
configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking without N26 procedure, the MME
sends an Update Location Request message to the HSS+UDM indicating that
registration of an AMF at the HSS+UDM, if any, shall not be cancelled. The
HSS+UDM does not send Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification to the old AMF.
NOTE 3: If the UE does not maintain registration in 5GC, upon reachability
time-out, the AMF can implicitly detach the UE and release the possible
remaining PDU Sessions in 5GC.
\- Step 11:
The HSS+UDM selects one of the SMF+PGW-C FQDN for one APN based on operator\'s
policy. The HSS+UDM sends selected SMF+PGW-C FQDN along with APN to the MME
for the UE.
\- Step 12:
The MME determines the SMF+PGW-C address for the Create Session Request based
on the APN received from the UE and the subscription profile received from the
HSS+UDM.
\- Step 13:
The SMF+PGW-C uses the PDU Session ID received from the UE in PCO to correlate
the transferred PDN connection with the PDU Session in 5GC.
In this release, if the Handover Indication is present in the Create Session
Request and the SMF+PGW-C detects it corresponds to a PDU Session for a LADN
in 5GC, the SMF+PGW-C rejects the request.
\- Step 14:
IP-CAN Session Modification procedure is replaced by SM Policy Association
Modification Procedure as described in clause 4.16.5.
\- Step 17:
If the UE indicated support for 5GC NAS procedures (see clause 5.11.3) and the
MME supports procedures for interworking with 5GC without N26, the MME may
indicate in the Attach Accept, that interworking without N26 is supported. UE
handling of this indicator is defined in TS 23.501 [2].
\- Step 23a:
As a result of the procedure the PGW-U+UPF starts routing DL data packets to
the Serving GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers established for
this PDN connection.
\- Step 25:
Notify Request is sent to HSS/UDM if the network supports the procedures for
5GC interworking without N26 and that the UE is allowed to access 5GC
(condition that is identified based on the subscription data). For emergency
attach, Notify Request is sent to HSS/UDM if the network supports the
procedures for 5GC interworking without N26 and operator policy allows
handover of emergency session to 5GS.
##### 4.11.2.4.2 Session Management
##### 4.11.2.4.2.1 PDN Connection Request {#pdn-connection-request-1 .H6}
Same procedure as specified in clause 4.11.1.5.4.1 is used with the following
clarification:
Step 6. The relevant steps of the procedure as specified in the figure above
are executed with the following modification:
\- Additional condition to trigger Notify Request to HSS in step 15 of Figure
5.10.2-1 of TS 23.401 [13] is that the network supports the procedures for 5GC
interworking without N26 and that the UE is allowed to use 5GS in the
subscription data. If the Request Type of the UE requested connectivity
procedure indicates \"Emergency\", MME triggers Notify Request to HSS if the
network supports the procedures for 5GC interworking without N26 and operator
policy allows handover of emergency session to 5GS.
For an unauthenticated or roaming UE, if the Request Type of the UE requested
connectivity procedure indicates \"Emergency\", the MME shall not send any
Notify Request to an HSS.

### 4.11.3 Handover procedures between EPS and 5GC-N3IWF
#### 4.11.3.1 Handover from EPS to 5GC-N3IWF
Figure 4.11.3.1-1: Handover from EPS to 5GC-N3IWF
0\. Initial status: one or more PDN connections have been established in EPC
between the 5G capable UE and the PGW via E-UTRAN.
1\. The UE initiates Registration procedure on untrusted non-3GPP access via
N3IWF (with 5G-GUTI is available or SUCI if not) per clause 4.12.2.
2\. The UE initiates a UE requested PDU Session Establishment with Existing
PDU Session indication in 5GC via Untrusted non-3GPP Access via N3IWF per
clause 4.12.5.
If the Request Type indicates \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the AMF
shall use the Emergency Information received from the HSS+UDM which contains
SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 interface for the emergency PDN connection
established in EPS and the AMF shall use the S-NSSAI locally configured in
Emergency Configuration Data.
The combined PGW+SMF/UPF initiates a PDN GW initiated bearer deactivation as
described in clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.401 [13] to release the EPC and E-UTRAN
resources.
#### 4.11.3.2 Handover from 5GC-N3IWF to EPS
Figure 4.11.3.2-1: Handover from 5GC-N3IWF to EPS
0\. Initial status: one or more PDU Sessions have been established in 5GC
between the UE and the SMF/UPF via untrusted non-3GPP access and N3IWF. During
PDU Session setup and in addition to what is specified in clause 4.3.2.2.1 and
clause 4.3.2.2.2, the AMF includes an indication that EPS interworking is
supported to the SMF+PGW-C as specified in clause 4.11.5.3 and the SMF+PGW-C
sends the FQDN related to the S5/S8 interface to the HSS+UDM which stores it
as described in clause 4.11.5.
1\. For the UE to move PDU session(s) from 5GC/N3IWF to EPC/E-UTRAN, the UE\'s
behaviour is as follows:
\- If the UE is operating in single-registration mode (as described in clause
5.17.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2]) and the UE is registered via 3GPP access to 5GC,
\- the UE behaves as specified in clause 4.11.1 or 4.11.2 and moves its PDU
session from 5GC/N3IWF to EPC/E-UTRAN using the PDN connection establishment
with \"Handover\" indication procedure as described in TS 23.401 [13].
\- otherwise, i.e. either the UE is operating in single registration mode and
is not registered via 3GPP access to 5GC, or the UE is operating in dual
registration mode and
\- if the UE is not attached to EPC/E-UTRAN, the UE initiates Handover Attach
procedure in E-UTRAN as described in TS 23.401 [13] for a non-3GPP to EPS
handover with \"Handover\" indication, except note 17.
\- otherwise (i.e. the UE is attached to EPC/E-UTRAN), the UE initiates the
PDN Connection establishment with \"Handover\" indication procedure as
described in TS 23.401 [13].
2\. The combined PGW+SMF/UPF initiates a network requested PDU Session Release
via untrusted non-3GPP access and N3IWF according to Figure 4.12.7-1 steps 3
to 12 to release the 5GC and N3IWF resources with the following exception:
\- the H-SMF indicates in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request that the UE shall
not be notified. This shall result in the V-SMF not sending the N1 SM
Container (PDU Session Release Command) to the UE.
\- Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify service operation invoked by H-SMF to V-SMF
indicates the PDU Session is moved to a different system;
\- Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify service operation invoked by the
(V-)SMF indicates the PDU Session is moved to another system.
\- The Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Delete service operation to PCF shall not be
performed.
### 4.11.3a Handover procedures between EPS and 5GC-TNGF
#### 4.11.3a.1 Handover from EPS to 5GC-TNGF
The handover procedure from EPS to 5GC-TNGF is supported as specified in
clause 4.11.3.1 for handover procedure from EPS to 5GC-N3IWF with the
following differences:
\- The untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by trusted non-3GPP access
point (TNAP).
\- The N3IWF is substituted by TNGF.
\- The registration procedure via trusted non-3GPP access as specified in
clause 4.12a.2 shall be performed in step 1.
\- The UE requested PDU Session Establishment with Existing PDU Session
indication in 5GC via trusted non-3GPP access is performed in step 2 as
specified clause 4.12a.5.
#### 4.11.3a.2 Handover from 5GC-TNGF to EPS
The handover procedure from 5GC-TNGF to EPS is supported as specified in
clause 4.11.3.2 for handover procedure from 5GC-N3IWF to EPS with the
following differences:
\- The untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by trusted non-3GPP access
point (TNAP).
\- The N3IWF is substituted by TNGF.
\- The network requested PDU Session Release via TNAP and TNGF shall be
initiated as specified in clause 4.12a.7 from steps 3 to 12.
### 4.11.4 Handover procedures between EPC/ePDG and 5GS
#### 4.11.4.1 Handover from EPC/ePDG to 5GS
Figure 4.11.4.1-1: Handover from EPC/ePDG to 5GS
0\. Initial status: one or more PDN Connections have been established between
the UE and the EPC/ePDG via untrusted non-3GPP access as specified in clauses
7.2.4 and 7.6.3 of TS 23.402 [26] with modification described in clauses
4.11.4.3.3 and 4.11.4.3.5.
1\. For the UE to move its PDU session(s) from EPC/ePDG to 5GC/3GPP access,
the UE\'s behaviour is as follows:
\- If the UE is operating in single-registration mode (as described in clause
5.17.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2]) and the UE is attached to EPC/E-UTRAN:
\- the UE behaves as specified in clause 4.11.1 or clause 4.11.2 and gets
registered to 5GC via 3GPP access.
\- otherwise i.e. either the UE is operating in single registration mode and
is not attached to EPC/E-UTRAN, or the UE is operating in dual registration
mode and
\- if the UE is already registered in 5GS via 3GPP access, the UE skips to
step 2.
\- otherwise (i.e UE is not registered in 5GS via 3GPP access), the UE
performs Registration procedure of type initial registration in 5GS via 3GPP
access as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
2\. The UE initiates a UE requested PDU Session Establishment via 3GPP Access
acording to clause 4.3.2.2 and includes the \"Existing PDU Session\"
indication or \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\" and the PDU Session ID.
For Request Type \"Existing PDU Session\", the UE provides a DNN, the PDU
Session ID and S-NSSAI corresponding to the existing PDN connection it wants
to transfer from EPC/ePDG to 5GS. The S-NSSAI and PLMN ID sent to the UE are
set in the same way as for EPS to 5GS mobility as specified in clause 5.15.7.1
of TS 23.501 [2].
If the Request Type indicates \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the AMF
shall use the Emergency Information containing SMF+PGW-C FQDN for the S2b
interface it has received from the HSS+UDM. The SMF+PGW-C FQDN was sent by
PGW-C when the Emergency PDN connection was established in EPC via ePDG and
the AMF shall use the S-NSSAI locally configured in Emergency Configuration
Data.
3\. The combined PGW+SMF/UPF initiates a PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation
Deactivation with GTP on S2b as described in clause 7.9.2 of TS 23.402 [26] to
release the EPC and ePDG resources when S6b is used. When S6b is not used
between SMF+PGW-C and AAA, impacts to step 5 of TS 23.402 [26] Figure 7.9.2-1
are captured in clause 4.11.4.3.6.
#### 4.11.4.2 Handover from 5GS to EPC/ePDG
Figure 4.11.4.2-1: Handover from 5GS to EPC/ePDG
0\. Initial status: one or more PDU Sessions have been established between the
UE and the SMF/UPF via NG-RAN.
1\. The UE connects to an untrusted non-3GPP access and the N3IWF-ePDG
selection process results in selecting an ePDG.
2\. The UE initiates a Handover Attach procedure as described in clause
8.6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [26], except step 11 of referenced figure 8.2.3-1 that
corresponds to the release of resources in source system.
3\. The combined PGW+SMF/UPF initiates a network requested PDU Session Release
via 3GPP access according to Figure 4.3.4.2-1 steps 3b to 7b, step 11 or
Figure 4.3.4.3-1 steps 3a-16b to release the 5GC and NG-RAN resources with the
following exception:
\- For non-roaming or local breakout in clause 4.3.4.2, the SMF does not
include N1 SM Container in Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service
operation.
\- For home routing roaming in clause 4.3.4.3, the H-SMF indicates in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request that the UE shall not be notified. This shall
result in the V-SMF not sending the N1 SM Container (PDU Session Release
Command) to the UE.
\- Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify service operation invoked by H-SMF to V-SMF
and Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify service operation invoked by the
(V-)SMF to the AMF indicate that the PDU Session is moved to a different
system.
\- The Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Delete service operation to PCF shall not be
performed.
#### 4.11.4.3 Impacts to EPC/ePDG Procedures
##### 4.11.4.3.1 General
This clause captures enhancements to procedures in TS 23.402 [26] to support
interworking with 5GS. The architecture for interworking is shown in clause
4.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. with the ePDG connected to SMF+PGW-C and UPF+PGW-U
using GTP based S2b.
##### 4.11.4.3.2 ePDG FQDN construction
Clause 4.5.4.2 of TS 23.402 [26] applies with the following modification:
\- Tracking/Location Area Identity FQDN: When the 5GC NAS capable UE uses the
Tracking Area of the NG-RAN when the UE is registered with the 5GC when
constructing the Tracking Area Identity FQDN.
##### 4.11.4.3.3 Initial Attach with GTP on S2b
The procedure in clause 7.2.4 of TS 23.402 [26] applies with the following
modifications:
\- In Step A.1 IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure, the 5GC NAS capable UE
shall indicate its support of 5GC NAS in IKEv2. The UE allocates a PDU Session
ID and also includes this in IKEv2 to the ePDG.
\- In Step A.1, UE\'s mobility restriction parameters related to 5GS or
indication of support for interworking with 5GS for this APN or both as
defined for MME in clause 4.11.0a.3 apply to the ePDG and are obtained by the
ePDG as part of the reply from the HSS via the 3GPP AAA Server. These
parameters and the 5G NAS support indicator from the UE, may be used by the
ePDG to determine if a combined SMF+PGW-C or a standalone PGW should be
selected.
\- In Step B.1, if the UE supports 5G NAS and the PDN connection is not
restricted to interworking with 5GS by user subscription, the ePDG shall send
the 5GS Interworking Indication and the PDU Session ID to the SMF+PGW-C.
\- In Step B.1, if the SMF+PGW-C supports more than one S-NSSAI and the APN is
valid for more than one S-NSSAI, the SMF+PGW-C selects S-NSSAI as specified in
clause 4.11.0a.5.
\- In Step D.1 (Create Session Response), the SMF+PGW-C assigns a S-NSSAI to
be associated with the PDN connection as specified in clause 5.15.7.1 of TS
23.501 [2]. The SMF+PGW-C sends the S-NSSAI to the ePDG together with a PLMN
ID that the S-NSSAI relates to.
\- In Steps B.1 and D.1, if the UE does not support 5GC NAS but has 5GS
subscription and a SMF+PGW-C is selected and interaction with UDM, PCF and UPF
is required, the SMF+PGW-C assigns PDU Session ID as specified in clause
4.11.0a.5. The SMF+PGW-C shall not provide any 5GS related parameters to the
UE.
\- In the IKEv2 Authentication Response message, the ePDG sends S-NSSAI and
the PLMN ID that the S-NSSAI relates to, to the UE. The UE associates the
received S-NSSAI and the PLMN ID that the S-NSSAI relates to, with the PDN
Connection.
##### 4.11.4.3.3a Initial Attach for emergency session (GTP on S2b)
The procedure in clause 7.2.5 of TS 23.402 [26] applies with the following
modification:
\- Step 3 (Create Session Request): ePDG determines if interworking with 5GC
is supported based on UE\'s 5G NAS capability and local configuration. In
SMF+PGW-C, only one S-NSSAI is configured for the emergency APN. An emergency
SMF+PGW-C identity should be configured as part of the Emergency Configuration
Data specified in clause 13.5 of TS 23.402 [26].
\- Step 6 (Create Session Response), compared to step D.1 of clause
4.11.4.3.3, SMF+PGW-C does not include S-NSSAI in PCO for emergency PDN
connection.
##### 4.11.4.3.4 Interaction with PCC
When interworking with 5GS is supported and a SMF+PGW-C is selected by the
ePDG, policy interactions between PDN GW and PCRF specified in TS 23.402 [26]
are replaced by equivalent interactions between SMF+PGW-C and PCF as captured
in clause 4.11.0a.2.
If SMF+PGW-C is selected and interaction with PCF is required for a UE that
does not support 5GC NAS, the SMF+PGW-C determines the PDU Session ID and
S-NSSAI in the same way as for PDN connection via MME as specified in clause
4.11.0a.5.
##### 4.11.4.3.5 UE initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN with GTP on S2b
The procedure in clause 7.6.3 of TS 23.402 [26] references the Initial Attach
procedure with GTP on S2b. Impacts to the initial attach procedure with GTP on
S2b are captured in clause 4.11.4.3.3 above. If the additional PDN connection
is for emergency service, impact as captured in clause 4.11.4.3.3a applies.
##### 4.11.4.3.6 Use of N10 interface instead of S6b
This clause applies to scnearios when ePDG is connected to SMF+PGW-C and S6b
in not used. It is applicable for procedures specified in TS 23.402 [26]
including mobility between EPC/ePDG and EPC/EUTRAN and also for mobility
between EPC/ePDG and 5GS.
When S6b, as specified in TS 23.402 [26], is not deployed between SMF+PGW-C
and AAA and the UE creates and deletes a PDN connection via ePDG connected to
SMF+PGW-C, the registration and de-registration of PDN GW is performed on the
N10 interface instead of the S6b interface.
If SMF+PGW-C is selected for a UE that does not support 5GC NAS, the SMF+PGW-C
determines the PDU Session ID and S-NSSAI in the same way as for PDN
connection via EPC/EUTRAN as specified in clause 4.11.0a.5.
For roaming scenario with local-breakout (TS 23.501 [2], Figure 4.3.4.2.1),
the use of N10 interface instead of S6b interface may be based on support of
this feature from HSS+UDM to SMF+PGW-C on N10 interface.
The specific impacts to procedures in clauses 7 and 8 of TS 23.402 [26] are as
follows:
**7.2.4 Initial Attach with GTP on S2b**
\- Instead of Step C.1 in Figure 7.2.4-1 of TS 23.402 [26], step 16c
(Nudm_UECM_Registration with an optional indication that access is from ePDG)
from Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 are performed between the SMF+PGW-C and HSS+UDM. Based
on this indication, the HSS+UDM does not send notification of PGW-C assignment
on SWx to AAA.
**7.2.5 Initial Attach for emergency session (GTP on S2b)**
\- Instead of step 5 in Figure 7.2.5-1 of TS 23.402 [26], step 16c
(Nudm_UECM_Registration with an optional indication that access is from ePDG)
from Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 are performed between the SMF+PGW-C and HSS+UDM. Based
on this indication, the HSS+UDM does not send notification of PGW-C assignment
on SWx to AAA.
The indication of access from ePDG is forwarded on the interface between UDM
and HSS.
**7.4.3 UE/ePDG-initiated Detach Procedure and UE-Requested PDN Disconnection
with GTP on S2b**
**7.4.3.1 Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout Case**
\- Instead of Step A.2 in Figure 7.4.3-1 of TS 23.402 [26], step 12
(Nudm_UECM_Deregistration) from Figure 4.3.4.2-1 is performed between the
SMF+PGW-C and HSS+UDM.
**7.4.4 HSS/AAA-initiated Detach Procedure with GTP on S2b**
**7.4.4.1 Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout Case**
\- Instead of step 3 in Figure 7.4.1-1 of TS 23.402 [26] (referenced by Figure
7.4.4-1 of TS 23.402 [26]), Step 12 (Nudm_UECM_Deregistration) from Figure
4.3.4.2-1 is performed between the SMF+PGW-C and HSS+UDM
**7.9.2 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with GTP on S2b**
\- Instead of step 5 in Figure 7.9.2-1 of TS 23.402 [26], Step 12
(Nudm_UECM_Deregistration) from Figure 4.3.4.2-1 is performed between the
SMF+PGW-C and HSS+UDM.
**8.6.1.1 General Procedure for GTP based S5/S8 for E-UTRAN Access**
\- Step 18 of clause 8.6.1.1 of TS 23.402 [26] refers to clause 7.9.2 of TS
23.402 [26]. The Nudm_UECM_Deregistration in the impacted referenced clause
7.9.2 above is not performed as resources in the SMF+PGW-C are not released.
**8.6.2.1 3GPP Access to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access Handover with GTP on
S2b**
\- In Step B.2 of clause 8.6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [26], if the registration of the
SMF+PGW-C in the HSS+UDM is not already done, step 16c (Nudm_UECM_Registration
with an optional indication that access is from ePDG) from Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1
is performed between the SMF+PGW-C and HSS+UDM.
The impacts to procedure in clause 4.11.4.1 (Handover from EPC/ePDG to 5GS)
are as follows:
\- For step 0, the impacts to clause 7.2.4 of TS 23.402 [26] are captured
above.
\- In step 2, if the Request Type indicates \"Existing Emergency PDU
Session\", the AMF shall use the Emergency Information containing SMF+PGW-C
FQDN for the S2b interface and the S NSSAI locally configured in Emergency
Configuration Data.
\- In step 3, the impacts to clause 7.9.2 of TS 23.402 [26] are captured
above. Nudm_UECM_Deregistration is not performed by SMF+PGW-C, as resources in
the SMF+PGW-C are not released.
The impacts to procedures in clause 4.11.4.2 (Handover from 5GS to EPC/ePDG)
are as follows:
\- For step 2, impacts to clause 8.6.2.1 (3GPP Access to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP
Access Handover with GTP on S2b) of TS 23.402 [26] are captured above and Step
16c of Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 is not performed as SMF+PGW-C already registered in
the HSS+UDM when the UE is in 5GS.
### 4.11.5 Impacts to 5GC Procedures
#### 4.11.5.1 General
This clause captures impacts to 5GC procedures in other clauses of this
specification to support interworking with EPS. These impacts are applicable
to interworking based on N26 and interworking without N26 for PDU Session via
3GPP access and for PDU Session via non-3GPP access.
This clause also captures the impact to 5GC if the UE was previously in
GERAN/UTRAN as specified in clause 5.17.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2].
#### 4.11.5.2 Registration procedure
The following impacts are applicable to clause 4.2.2.2 (Registration
procedure):
\- Step 1: If the Registration type is set to \"Initial Registration\", the UE
is not registered in EPS and the UE provides the 5G-GUTI mapped from EPS GUTI
as the old GUTI, then the UE includes complete EPS Attach Request in the
Registration request message.
\- Step 4: If the Registration type is \"Initial Registration\" as in step 1
of the Registration Procedure captured in clause 4.2.2.2.2, the target AMF may
perform Identification Request towards MME along with complete EPS Attach
Request message for MME to verify it as in step 3 as specified in clause
5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13].
NOTE 1: The steps above apply to interworking with N26.
\- Step 14a:
\- If the AMF does not have event subscription information from the UDM, the
AMF indicates it in Nudm_UECM_Registration. The UDM then provides event
subscriptions (possibly retrieved from UDR) if any.
\- If mobility between GERAN/UTRAN and 5GS is required (as specified in clause
5.17.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2]), at Initial Registration, the AMF serving 3GPP
access shall also register with the Nudm_UECM_Registration even if the AMF has
a valid context.
\- Step 14d: If mobility between GERAN/UTRAN and 5GS is required (as specified
in clause 5.17.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2]), when the UDM stores the associated 3GPP
Access Type together with the serving AMF as indicated in step 14a, it will
also cause cancellation of any other previously registered serving node (e.g.
MME if AMF does not indicate not to cancel or SGSN) via HSS/HLR.
NOTE 2: Upon mobility from GERAN/UTRAN to 5GS as specified in clause 5.17.2.4
of TS 23.501 [2], the previously registered SGSN needs to be cancelled from
HSS/HLR, otherwise the incoming session can fail.
\- At the end of registration procedure, the AMF may initiate synchronization
of event subscriptions with the UDM if the AMF does not indicate
unavailability of event subscription in step 14a.
NOTE 3: The details how synchronization can be done is left to stage 3.
For PDU Session via 3GPP access the following impacts are applicable to clause
4.2.2.2 (Registration procedure) when the UE has established PDU Session(s):
In clause 4.3.2.2.1 Non-roaming and Roaming with Local Breakout:
\- Step 17: Additional trigger for step 17 Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
are:
\- If status of interworking with EPS for a PDU session changes, e.g. due to
change of 5GMM capability (e.g. \"S1 mode supported\"), the UE subscription
data change (e.g. Core Network Type Restriction to EPC), the AMF invokes
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (EPS Interworking Indication with N26 or
without N26) to SMF. The SMF determines whether the PDU session supports
interworking with EPS need be changed. If it needs to be changed, the SMF
invokes Nudm_UECM_Update service operation to add or remove the PGW-C FQDN for
S5/S8 interface from the UE context in SMF data stored at the UDM.
For interworking with the N26 interface, if status of interworking with EPS
for a PDU session is changed at SMF+PGW-C, the SMF+PGW-C invokes EBI
allocation or revocation as described in clause 4.11.1.4.1 and clause
4.11.1.4.2 respectively.
For PDU Session via non-3GPP access, the AMF determines if EPS interworking is
supported and sends the indication to the SMF in the same way as for PDU
Session via 3GPP access. The SMF makes the final decision on the EPS
interworking in the same way as for PDU Session via 3GPP access with the
following modification:
If the SMF does not receive the interworking indication, the SMF makes its
decision based on subscription.
#### 4.11.5.3 UE Requested PDU Session Establishment procedure
For PDU Session via 3GPP, the following impacts are applicable to clause
4.3.2.2 (UE Requested PDU Session Establishment procedure) to support
interworking with EPS:
In clause 4.3.2.2.1 Non-roaming and Roaming with local breakout:
\- Step 1: In PDU Session Establishment Request message, the UE includes also
the UE capability of Ethernet PDN type support in EPS to the SMF (or H-SMF in
home routing roaming);
\- Step 3: The AMF determines that a PDU Session supports EPS interworking
with N26 or without N26, based on e.g. 5GMM capability (e.g. \"S1 mode
supported\"), UE subscription data (e.g. Core Network Type Restriction to EPS,
EPC interworking support per (S-NSSAI, subscribed DNN)) and network
configuration if EPS interworking with N26 or without N26 is supported. The
AMF then includes in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext an indication whether
the PDU Session supports EPS Interworking with N26 or without N26.
For PDU Session with Request Type \"initial emergency request\", the AMF
decides the EPS interworking with N26 or without N26 based on 5GMM capability
and local configuration.
For PDU Session with Request Type \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the AMF
shall use Emergency Information received from HSS+UDM and the S-NSSAI locally
configured in Emergency Configuration Data.
If the Request Type indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" the AMF selects the SMF
based on SMF-ID or SMF+PGW-C FQDN received from UDM during the Registration or
Subscription Profile Update Notification procedure. The case where the AMF
does not recognize the PDU Session ID or the subscription context that the AMF
received from UDM neither contains an SMF ID nor a SMF+PGW-C FQDN
corresponding to the PDU Session ID constitutes as an error case.
NOTE 1: If the AMF receives from the UDM, for a PDU Session, both a SMF ID and
a SMF+PGW-C FQDN, the SMF ID takes precedence.
If the AMF has stored APN Rate Control Status and the PDU Session is
considered a new first PDU Session to a DNN that is the same as the APN in
stored APN Rate Control Status and interworking with EPC is enabled for this
PDU Session, then the AMF sends the APN Rate Control Status to the SMF.
\- Step 4: If the EPS Interworking indication received from AMF indicates that
the UE supports EPS interworking and the SMF determines, based on the EPS
interworking support indication from the AMF and additional UE subscription
data (e.g. whether UP integrity protection of UP Security Enforcement
Information is not set to required, EPS interworking is allowed for this DNN
and S-NSSAI), that the PDU Session supports EPS interworking, the SMF+PGW-C
FQDN for S5/S8 interface is included in the Nudm_UECM_Registration Request.
\- Step 10a: If APN Rate Control Status is received from the AMF then the SMF
provides the configured APN Rate Control Status to the PGW-U+UPF.
\- Step 13 In PDU Session Establishment Accept message, the SMF also includes
indication of Ethernet PDN type supported if the Ethernet PDN type is
supported by both the UE and the SMF+PGW-C. The SMF and the UE stores the
information if Ethernet PDN type is supported for later use when UE moves from
5GS to EPS.
NOTE 2: The subscription data \"EPS interworking support indication\" is used
by AMF when determining the EPS interworking support for the PDU Session.
Therefore, when the UE establishes the PDU Session via the 3GPP access, the
SMF does not need to consider the same subscription data \"EPS interworking
support indication\" again.
In clause 4.3.2.2.2 Home-routed Roaming:
\- Step 3a: Same impact as for step 3 for the non-roaming and roaming with
local breakout case above.
\- Step 5: Same impact as for step 10a for the Non-roaming and Roaming with
Local Breakout case above.
\- Step 6 The V-SMF pass the EPS interworking support indication received from
the AMF to the H-SMF in Nsmf_PDUSession_Create.
\- Step 7: If the EPS interworking indication received from V-SMF indicates
that the PDU Session supports EPS interworking and the H-SMF determines, based
on the EPS interworking support indication from the AMF and additional
information such as UP integrity protection of UP Security Enforcement
Information as described in clause 4.11.1.1, that the PDU Session supports EPS
interworking, the SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 interface is included in the
Nudm_UECM_Registration Request.
\- Step 15: Same impact as in step 13 for the non-roaming and roaming with
local breakout case above with the difference that it\'s the home SMF+PGW-C
that includes the indication of Ethernet PDN type supported.
For interworking with the N26 interface, if the PDU Session supports
interworking with EPS, the SMF+PGW-C invokes EBI allocation as described in
clause 4.11.1.4.1.
For non-emergency PDU Session via non-3GPP, the AMF determines if EPS
interworking is supported and sends the indication to the SMF in the same way
as for PDU Session via 3GPP. The SMF makes the final decision on the EPS
interworking in the same way as for PDU Session via 3GPP with the following
modification:
\- If the SMF does not receive the interworking indication, the SMF makes its
decision based on subscription.
For emergency PDU Session via non-3GPP, the AMF determines if EPS interworking
is supported and sends the indication to the SMF in the same way as for
emergency PDU Session via 3GPP supporting EPS interworking.
#### 4.11.5.4 UE or Network Requested PDU Session Modification procedure
For PDU Session via 3GPP, the following impacts are applicable to clause
4.3.3.2 (UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (non-roaming and
roaming with local breakout)) to support interworking with EPS:
\- Step 1: In addition to the triggers listed in step 1 of clause 4.3.3.2, the
procedure may be also triggered by the following event:
\- AMF initiated modification: If the support of EPS Interworking for this PDU
Session has changed, e.g. the change of the UE\'s subscription data (e.g. Core
Network Type Restriction to EPS), or change of 5GMM capability (e.g. \"S1 mode
supported\"), the AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext update the
status of EPS interworking support in the to SMF.
\- Step 3a: This step also applies to AMF initiated modification. For AMF
initiated modification, the SMF may determines whether the PDU session
supports EPS interworking need be changed. If it need be changed, the SMF
invokes Nudm_UECM_Update service operation to add or remove the PGW-C FQDN for
S5/S8 interface from the UE context in SMF data stored at the UDM,
For PDU Session via 3GPP, the following impacts are applicable to clause
4.3.3.3 (UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (home-routed
roaming)) to support interworking with EPS:
\- Step 1a (AMF to V-SMF): Same impact as for step 1 of clause 4.3.3.2 above.
\- Step 1a (V-SMF to H-SMF): The V-SMF pass the status of EPS interworking
support to the H-SMF.
\- Step 1a (H-SMF to V-SMF): Same impact as for clause 3a of 4.3.3.2 above.
For interworking with the N26 interface, if status of interworking with EPS
for a PDU session is changed at SMF+PGW-C, the SMF+PGW-C invokes EBI
allocation or revocation as described in clause 4.11.1.4.1 and clause
4.11.1.4.2 respectively.
For PDU Session via non-3GPP access, the AMF determines if EPS interworking is
supported and sends the indication to the SMF in the same way as for PDU
Session via 3GPP access. The SMF makes the final decision on the EPS
interworking in the same way as for PDU Session via 3GPP access with the
following modification:
If the SMF does not receive the interworking indication, the SMF makes its
decision based on subscription.
#### 4.11.5.5 Xn based inter NG-RAN handover
The following impacts are applicable to clause 4.9.1.2.1 (General) to support
interworking with EPS:
\- If there is Mapping between EBI(s) and QFI(s) for the UE in the source NG-
RAN, the source NG-RAN sends the Mapping to target NG-RAN during handover.
#### 4.11.5.6 Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover
The following impacts are applicable to clause 4.9.1.3.2 (Preparation phase)
to support interworking with EPS:
\- Step 7: If the PDU session supports EPS interworking, the N2 SM information
contains the Mapping between EBI(s) and QFI(s).
#### 4.11.5.7 UE or Network Requested PDU Session Release procedure
The following impacts are applicable to clause 4.3.4.2 (UE or network
requested PDU Session Release for Non-Roaming and Roaming with Local Breakout)
to support interworking with EPS:
\- Step 2b: If the released PDU Session used APN Rate Control in EPC then the
PGW-U+UPF provides the APN Rate Control Status to the SMF if the released PDU
Session supported interworking with EPC and it is the last PDU Session to the
DNN that is the same as the APN identified in the APN Rate Control Status.
\- Step 3: If the PGW-U+UPF provided APN Rate Control Status to the SMF then
the SMF provides the APN Rate Control Status to the AMF.
The following impacts are applicable to clause 4.3.4.3 (UE or network
requested PDU Session Release for Home-routed Roaming) to support interworking
with EPS:
\- Step 2b: Same impact as for step 2b for the Non-roaming and Roaming with
Local Breakout case above.
\- Step 3: Same impact as for step 3 for the Non-roaming and Roaming with
Local Breakout case above.
#### 4.11.5.8 Network Configuration
To avoid the need for identifier coordination between AMFs and MMEs, the AMF
provides to the NG-RAN its served GUAMIs by separating the values between
native AMF values and the values mapped from MME.
### 4.11.6 Interworking for common network exposure
#### 4.11.6.1 Subscription and Notification of availability or expected level
of support of a service API
Figure 4.11.6.1 1 represent the information flow subscribing and notifying the
availability or expected level of support of a service API.
For the subscription to Nnef_APISupportCapability service, the subscription
request may include the Duration of Reporting. If the Duration of Reporting is
expired, the SCEF+NEF deletes the subscription without any explicit signalling
interaction.
For the CN type Change Event subscription to the HSS+UDM, the subscription
request may include the Duration of Reporting. If the Duration of Reporting is
expired, the HSS+UDM locally unsubscribe the CN Type Change Event without any
explicit signalling interaction.
The SCEF+NEF informs the AF of the API Indication which indicates list of
available north-bound API(s).
Figure 4.11.6.1-1: Subscription and Notification of availability or expected
level of support of a service API
1\. The AF subscribes to Nnef_APISupportCapability service for a UE or a group
of UEs by sending Nnef_APISupportCapability_Subscribe Request (UE ID or
External Group ID, Report Type, callback URI, Duration of Reporting) message.
The callback URI parameter is optional and is used in step 6 if provided.
The Report Type can be either One-time report or Continuous report. If this is
a subscription for Continuous report type, then the Duration of Reporting may
be included. The Duration of Reporting is optional and is used to indicate
when the subscription is invalid. If the SCEF+NEF has established direct
connection with MME or AMF or SMF, steps 2 - 3 and step 5 are omitted. If this
is a subscription for One-time report type and if the Freshness Timer of last
One-time report type subscribe request is not expired or a direct connection
has been set up with MME or AMF or SMF, the SCEF+NEF determines the CN type
locally, steps 2 - 3 are omitted.
2\. SCEF+NEF subscribes the CN Type Change Event to HSS+UDM by sending
Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe Request (CN Type Change, Report Type, UE ID or
External Group ID, Duration of Reporting) message.
If Duration of Reporting is received at step 1, it shall include Duration of
Reporting in this message.
3\. The HSS+UDM determines the CN type that is serving the indicated UE or the
indicated group of UEs based on the registered MME or AMF. The HSS+UDM informs
SCEF+NEF of the CN type by sending Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe Response (CN
Type) message. If the Report Type indicates One-time report, the HSS+UDM
delete the CN Type Change Event subscription after sending the response with
CN Type. The Freshness Timer is set in SCEF+NEF per operator\'s policy, e.g.
based on the statistics of UE activities. If the Report Type indicates
Continuous report, HSS+UDM stores the CN Type Change Event subscription.
4\. According to the CN type received or local stored, the SCEF+NEF determines
the availability or expected level of support of common north-bound APIs for
the indicated UE or the indicated group of UEs. SCEF+NEF responds to AF by
sending Nnef_APISupportCapability_Subscribe Response (API Indication).
If the subscription is for One-time report type, then steps 5 - 6 are omitted.
5\. When HSS+UDM detects that the indicated UE is switching between EPC and
5GC the HSS+UDM determines the CN type that is serving the indicated UE or the
indicated group of UEs. The HSS+UDM informs SCEF+NEF of the CN type by sending
Nudm_EventExposure_Notify (CN type).
The CN type denotes the 5GC or EPC or 5GC+EPC serving the UE or the group of
UEs.
6\. According to the CN type received and local detected, the SCEF+NEF node
determines the availability or expected level of support of common north-bound
APIs for the indicated UE or the indicated group of UEs. SCEF+NEF inform AF of
such API information by sending Nnef_APISupportCapability_Notify (API
Indication) message.
If callback URI is provided at step 1, then SCEF+NEF will send the
Nnef_APISupportCapability_Notify (API Indication) message to the node
addressed by callback URI.
Upon reception of API Indication in step 4 or step 6, the AF obtains the
availability or expected level of support of a given service for the indicated
UE or the indicated group of UEs. If required, the AF can select the valid
north-bound API based on such API information.
#### 4.11.6.2 Unsubscribing to N11otification of availability or expected
level of support of a service API
Figure 4.11.6.2 1 represent the information flow unsubscribing to Continuous
report type subscription of the availability or expected level of support of a
service API.
If the AF invokes Nnef_APISupportCapability_Subscribe service to SCEF+NEF node
with the Duration of Reporting parameter for Continuous report type, the
subscription on the SCEF+NEF and HSS+UDM are implicitly unsubscribed if the
Duration of Reporting timer expires, i.e. the explicit unsubscribe service
operation is not needed.
If the explicit unsubscribe operation is needed, the information flow is as
follows.
Figure 4.11.6.2 1: Unsubscribing to notification of the availability or
expected level of support of a service API
1\. The AF unsubscribes to Nnef_APISupportCapability service for a UE or a
group of UEs by sending APISupportCapability_Unsubscribe Request (UE ID or
External Group ID) message.
2\. If SCEF+NEF has subscribed to CN Type Change Event for the indicated UE or
the indicated group of UEs, SCEF+NEF unsubscribes the CN Type Change Event by
sending Ndum_EventExposure_Unsubscribe Request (CN Type Change, UE ID or
External Group ID) message to HSS+UDM.
3\. HSS+UDM deletes the CN Type Change Event subscription for the indicated UE
or the indicated group of UEs, HSS+UDM responses to the SCEF+NEF by sending
Ndum_EventExposure_Unsubscribe Response (Operation execution result
indication) message.
4\. If result indication indicates the operation is successful, the SCEF+NEF
deletes the subscription to Nnef_APISupportCapability service. SCEF+NEF
acknowledges the operation result by sending
Nnef_APISupportCapability_Unsubscribe Response (Operation execution result
indication) to AF.
#### 4.11.6.3 Configuration of monitoring events for common network exposure
Figure 4.11.6.3-1 represent the information flow to configure monitoring
events applicable to both EPC and 5GC using 5GC procedures towards UDM in
scenarios where interworking between 5GS and EPC is possible.
Figure 4.11.6.3-1: Configuration of monitoring events for common network
exposure
1\. The AF configures a monitoring event via the SCEF+NEF using the
Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.
2\. SCEF+NEF configures the monitoring event in the UDM+HSS using the
Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.
The combined SCEF+NEF indicates that the monitoring event is also applicable
to EPC (i.e. the event must be reported both by 5GC and EPC). Depending on the
type of event, the SCEF+NEF may include a SCEF address (i.e. if the event
needs to be configured in the MME and the corresponding notification needs to
be sent directly to the SCEF).
3\. The HSS+UDM configures the monitoring event. For events that need to be
reported from a serving node (e.g. location change) the HSS+UDM requests the
configuration of the monitoring event to the corresponding serving node in the
5GC and EPC. The HSS+UDM uses the corresponding Event Exposure Subscribe
service operation to configure monitoring events in 5GC serving NFs (e.g.
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe or Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe). The HSS+UDM
uses the procedures defined in TS 23.682 [23] to configure monitoring events
in MME. The HSS+UDM provides the MME with the SCEF address during the
configuration of the monitoring event in EPC. If the HSS and UDM are deployed
as separate network entities, UDM shall use HSS services to configure the
monitoring event in EPC as defined in TS 23.632 [68].
4\. The HSS+UDM replies the SCEF+NEF with the indication that the monitoring
event was successfully configured in 5GC and EPC by sending the
Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe Response.
5\. The SCEF+NEF responds to AF by sending Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe
Response.
6\. The SCEF+NEF is notified when HSS+UDM or the serving node at the 5GC or
EPC detects the corresponding event. The HSS+UDM notifies the SCEF+NEF using
the Nudm_EventExposure_Notify service operation. A serving NF in the 5GC
notifies the SCEF+NEF using the corresponding Event Exposure Notify service
operation (e.g. Namf_EventExposure_Notify or Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify). The
MME notifies the SCEF+NEF using the procedures defined in TS 23.682 [23] using
the SCEF address provided by the HSS+UDM in step 3.
7\. The SCEF+NEF notifies the AF using the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service
operation.
## 4.12 Procedures for Untrusted non-3GPP access
### 4.12.1 General
Clause 4.12 defines the procedures to support Untrusted non-3GPP access by
describing the differences compared to the defined procedures in other
clauses. The procedures for Untrusted non-3GPP access are also used by a UE
that accesses SNPN services via a PLMN over 3GPP access.
### 4.12.2 Registration via Untrusted non-3GPP Access
#### 4.12.2.1 General
Clause 4.12.2 specifies how a UE can register to 5GC via an untrusted non-3GPP
Access Network. It is based on the Registration procedure specified in clause
4.2.2.2.2 and it uses a vendor-specific EAP method called \"EAP-5G\". The
EAP-5G packets utilize the \"Expanded\" EAP type and the existing 3GPP Vendor-
Id registered with IANA under the SMI Private Enterprise Code registry. The
\"EAP-5G\" method is used between the UE and the N3IWF and is utilized only
for encapsulating NAS messages (not for authentication). If the UE needs to be
authenticated, mutual authentication is executed between the UE and AUSF. The
details of the authentication procedure are specified in TS 33.501 [15].
In Registration and subsequent Registration procedures via untrusted non-3GPP
access, the NAS messages are always exchanged between the UE and the AMF. When
possible, the UE can be authenticated by reusing the existing UE security
context in AMF.
#### 4.12.2.2 Registration procedure for untrusted non-3GPP access
The signalling flow in Figure 4.12.2.2-1 does not show all the details of a
registration procedure via untrusted non-3GPP access. It shows primarily the
steps executed between the UE and N3IWF. All the details of a registration
procedure, including interactions with PCF, UDM, etc. are specified in clause
4.2.2.2.2.
Figure 4.12.2.2-1: Registration via untrusted non-3GPP access
1\. The UE connects to an untrusted non-3GPP Access Network with any
appropriate authentication procedure and it is assigned an IP address. For
example, a non-3GPP authentication method can be used, e.g. no authentication
(in the case of a free WLAN), EAP with pre-shared key, username/password, etc.
When the UE decides to attach to 5GC network, the UE selects an N3IWF in a 5G
PLMN, as described in clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.501 [2].
2\. The UE proceeds with the establishment of an IPsec Security Association
(SA) with the selected N3IWF by initiating an IKE initial exchange according
to RFC 7296 [3]. After step 2, all subsequent IKE messages are encrypted and
integrity protected by using the IKE SA established in this step.
3\. The UE shall initiate an IKE_AUTH exchange by sending an IKE_AUTH request
message. The AUTH payload is not included in the IKE_AUTH request message,
which indicates that the IKE_AUTH exchange shall use EAP signalling (in this
case EAP-5G signalling). If the UE supports MOBIKE, it shall include a Notify
payload in the IKE_AUTH request, as specified in RFC 4555 [40], indicating
that MOBIKE is supported. In addition, as specified in TS 33.501 [15], if the
UE is provisioned with the N3IWF root certificate, it shall include the
CERTREQ payload within the IKE_AUTH request message to request the N3IWF\'s
certificate.
4\. The N3IWF responds with an IKE_AUTH response message, which includes an
EAP-Request/5G-Start packet. The EAP-Request/5G-Start packet informs the UE to
initiate an EAP-5G session, i.e. to start sending NAS messages encapsulated
within EAP-5G packets. If the N3IWF has received a CERTREQ payload from the
UE, the N3IWF shall include the CERT payload in the IKE_AUTH response message
containing the N3IWF\'s certificate. How the UE uses the N3IWF\'s certificate
is specified in TS 33.501 [15].
5\. The UE shall send an IKE_AUTH request, which includes an EAP-
Response/5G-NAS packet that contains the Access Network parameters (AN
parameters) and a Registration Request message. The AN parameters contain
information that is used by the N3IWF for selecting an AMF in the 5G core
network. This information includes e.g. the GUAMI, the Selected PLMN ID (or
PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]), the Requested NSSAI and
the Establishment cause. The Establishment cause provides the reason for
requesting a signalling connection with 5GC. Whether and how the UE includes
the Requested NSSAI as part of the AN parameters is dependent on the value of
the Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode parameter, as
specified in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE 1: The N3IWF does not send an EAP-Identity request because the UE
includes its identity in the first IKE_AUTH. This is in line with RFC7296,
clause 3.16.
6\. The N3IWF shall select an AMF based on the received AN parameters and
local policy, as specified in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The N3IWF shall
then forward the Registration Request received from the UE to the selected AMF
within an N2 message. This message contains N2 parameters that include the
Selected PLMN ID and the Establishment cause.
7\. The selected AMF may decide to request the SUCI by sending a NAS Identity
Request message to UE. This NAS message and all subsequent NAS messages are
sent to UE encapsulated within EAP/5G-NAS packets.
8\. The AMF may decide to authenticate the UE by invoking an AUSF. In this
case, the AMF shall select an AUSF as specified in clause 6.3.4 of TS 23.501
[2] based on SUPI or SUCI.
The AUSF executes the authentication of the UE as specified in TS 33.501 [15].
The AUSF selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2] and gets
the authentication data from UDM. The authentication packets are encapsulated
within NAS authentication messages and the NAS authentication messages are
encapsulated within EAP/5G-NAS packets. After the successful authentication:
\- In step 8h, the AUSF shall send the anchor key (SEAF key) to AMF which is
used by AMF to derive NAS security keys and a security key for N3IWF (N3IWF
key). The UE also derives the anchor key (SEAF key) and from that key it
derives the NAS security keys and the security key for N3IWF (N3IWF key). The
N3IWF key is used by the UE and N3IWF for establishing the IPsec Security
Association (in step 11).
\- In step 8h, the AUSF shall also include the SUPI, if in step 8a the AMF
provided to AUSF a SUCI.
NOTE 2: EAP-AKA\' or 5G-AKA are allowed for the authentication of UE via
non-3GPP access, as specified in TS 33.501 [15]. Figure 4.12.2.2-1 only shows
authentication flow using EAP-AKA\'. Authentication methods other than EAP-
AKA\' or 5G-AKA are also allowed for UE accessing SNPN services via a PLMN, as
specified in TS 33.501 [15], Annex I.
9a. The AMF shall send a NAS Security Mode Command to UE in order to activate
NAS security. If an EAP-AKA\' authentication was successfully executed in step
8, the AMF shall encapsulate the EAP-Success received from AUSF within the NAS
Security Mode Command message.
9b. The N3IWF shall forward the NAS Security Mode Command message to UE within
an EAP/5G-NAS packet.
9c. The UE completes the EAP-AKA\' authentication (if initiated in step 8),
creates a NAS security context and an N3IWF key and sends the NAS Security
Mode Complete message within an EAP/5G-NAS packet.
9d. The N3IWF relays the NAS Security Mode Complete message to the AMF.
10a. Upon receiving NAS Security Mode Complete, the AMF shall send an NGAP
Initial Context Setup Request message that includes the N3IWF key.
10b. This triggers the N3IWF to send an EAP-Success to UE, which completes the
EAP-5G session. No further EAP-5G packets are exchanged.
11\. The IPsec SA is established between the UE and N3IWF by using the common
N3IWF key that was created in the UE in step 9c and received by the N3IWF in
step 10a. This IPsec SA is referred to as the \"signalling IPsec SA\". After
the establishment of the signalling IPsec SA, the N3IWF notifies the AMF that
the UE context (including AN security) was created by sending a NGAP Initial
Context Setup Response. The signalling IPsec SA shall be configured to operate
in tunnel mode and the N3IWF shall assign to UE an \"inner\" IP address. If
the N3IWF has received an indication that the UE supports MOBIKE (see step 3),
then the N3IWF shall include a Notify payload in the IKE_AUTH response message
sent in step 11a, indicating that MOBIKE shall be supported, as specified in
RFC 4555 [40].
All subsequent NAS messages exchanged between the UE and N3IWF shall be sent
via the signalling IPsec SA and shall be carried over TCP/IP. The UE shall
send NAS messages within TCP/IP packets with source address the \"inner\" IP
address of the UE and destination address the NAS_IP_ADDRESS that is received
in step 11a. The N3IWF shall send NAS messages within TCP/IP packets with
source address the NAS_IP_ADDRESS and destination address the \"inner\" IP
address of the UE. The TCP connection used for reliable NAS transport between
the UE and N3IWF shall be initiated by the UE right after the signalling IPsec
SA is established in step 11a. The UE shall send the TCP connection request to
the NAS_IP_ADDRESS and to the TCP port number specified in TS 24.502 [41].
12\. The AMF sends the NAS Registration Accept message to the N3IWF. The N2
Message includes the Allowed NSSAI for the access type for the UE.
13\. The N3IWF forwards the NAS Registration Accept message to UE via the
established signalling IPsec SA. If the NAS Registration Accept message is
received by the N3IWF before the IPsec SA is established, the N3IWF shall
store it and forward it to the UE only after the establishment of the
signalling IPsec SA.
The AMF provides the Access Type set to \"Non-3GPP access\" to the UDM when it
registers with the UDM.
NOTE 3: The Access Type is set to \"Non-3GPP access\" even when the UE
accesses SNPN services via PLMN over 3GPP access.
#### 4.12.2.3 Emergency Registration for untrusted non-3GPP Access
Emergency Registration procedure is used by UEs requiring to perform emergency
services but cannot gain normal services from the network. These UEs are in
limited service state as defined in TS 23.122 [22].
The regular registration procedure described in clause 4.12.2 applies with the
following differences:
\- If the UE has no SUPI and no valid 5G-GUTI, PEI shall be included instead
of its encrypted Permanent User ID (SUCI) in the NAS message.
\- NSSAI shall not be included by the UE. The AMF shall not send the Allowed
NSSAI in the Registration Accept message.
\- If the AMF is not configured to support Emergency Registration, the AMF
shall reject any Registration Request that indicates Registration type
\"Emergency Registration\".
\- If the AMF is configured to support Emergency Registration for
unauthenticated UEs and the UE indicated Registration Type \"Emergency
Registration\", the AMF skips the authentication and security setup or the AMF
accepts that the authentication may fail and continues the Emergency
Registration procedure.
\- If the authentication is performed successfully, the NAS messages will be
protected by the NAS security functions (integrity and ciphering). The AMF
shall derive the N3IWF key, per TS 33.501 [15] and shall provide it to the
N3IWF after the authentication completion using an NGAP Initial Context Setup
Request message as in the regular registration procedure.
\- If the authentication is skipped or authentication fails, the NAS messages
will not be protected by the NAS security functions (integrity and ciphering).
However, the AMF shall create an N3IWF key and shall provide it to the N3IWF
after the authentication completion (whenever authentication has failed or has
been skipped) using an NGAP Initial Context Setup Request message. The N3IWF
shall use it to complete IKE SA establishment and shall acknowledge the AMF by
sending an NGAP Initial Context Setup Response message.
NOTE: According to TS 33.501 [15], the UE and the AMF independently generate
the KAMF (and derived keys) in an implementation defined way and populate the
5G NAS security context with this KAMF to be used when activating a 5G NAS
security context.\"
\- As in step 14 of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 for Emergency Registration, if the UE
was not successfully authenticated, the AMF shall not update the UDM. Also for
an Emergency Registration, the AMF shall not check for access restrictions,
regional restrictions or subscription restrictions.
\- Steps 16 and 21b of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 are not performed since AM and UE
policy for the UE are not required for Emergency Registration.
### 4.12.3 Deregistration procedure for untrusted non-3gpp access
Figure 4.12.3-1: Deregistration procedure for untrusted non-3gpp access
1\. The Deregistration procedure is triggered by one of the events:
1a. For UE-initiated Deregistration as in steps from 1 to 7 of Figures
4.2.2.3.2-1.
1b. For network initiated deregistration as in steps from 1 to 6 of Figure
4.2.2.3.3-1.
If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state either in 3GPP access, non-3GPP access or
both,
\- the AMF may explicitly deregister the UE by sending a Deregistration
request message ( Deregistration type, access type set to non-3GPP) to the UE
as in step 2 of Figure 4.2.2.3.3-1.
\- the UDM may want to request the deletion of the subscribers RM contexts and
PDU Sessions with the reason for removal set to subscription withdrawn to the
registered AMF as in step 1 of Figure 4.2.2.3.3-1.
2\. AMF to N3IWF: The AMF sends a N2 Context UE Release Command message to the
N3IWF with the cause set to Deregistration to release N2 signalling as defined
in step 4 of clause 4.12.4.2.
3\. N3IWF to UE: The N3IWF sends INFORMATIONAL Request (Delete payload)
message to the UE. The Delete payload is included to indicate the release of
the IKE SA.
4\. UE to N3IWF: The UE sends an empty INFORMATIONAL Response message to
acknowledge the release of the IKE SA as described in RFC 7296 [3]. Non-3GPP
access specific resources are released including the IKEv2 tunnel (and the
associated IPSec resources) and the local UE contexts in N3IWF (N3 tunnel Id).
5\. N3IWF to AMF: The N3IWF acknowledges the N2 UE Context Release Command
message by sending N2 UE Context Release Complete message to the AMF as
defined in step 7 of clause 4.12.4.2.
### 4.12.4 N2 procedures via Untrusted non-3GPP Access
#### 4.12.4.1 Service Request procedures via Untrusted non-3GPP Access
The Service Request procedure via Untrusted non-3GPP Access shall be used by a
UE in CM-IDLE state over non-3GPP access to request the re-establishment of
the NAS signalling connection and the re-establishment of the user plane for
all or some of the PDU Sessions which are associated to non-3GPP access.
The Service Request procedure via Untrusted non-3GPP Access shall be used by a
UE in CM-CONNECTED state over non-3GPP access to request the re-establishment
of the user plane for one or more PDU Sessions which are associated to
non-3GPP access.
When the UE is in CM-IDLE state over non-3GPP access, the Service Request
procedure via Untrusted non-3GPP Access is as described in clause 4.2.3.2 (UE
Triggered Service Request) with the following exceptions:
\- The Service Request procedure is never a response to a Paging, i.e. there
is no Network Triggered Service Request procedure via Untrusted non-3GPP
Access.
\- The (R)AN corresponds to an N3IWF.
\- The UE establishes a \"signalling IPsec SA\" with the N3IWF by using the
procedure specified in clause 4.12.2 for the registration via untrusted
non-3GPP access. In particular, the UE includes the Service Request and the AN
parameters in an EAP-5G packet, which is further encapsulated in an IKE_AUTH
request.
\- The AN parameters include the Selected PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID, see
clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]) and Establishment cause. The Establishment cause
provides the reason for requesting a signalling connection with the 5GC. The
UE includes GUAMI information in the AN parameters. The N3IWF selects the AMF
according to GUAMI information.
\- The N2 parameters sent from N3IWF to AMF include the Establishment cause.
\- The user plane between the UE and N3IWF is established not with RRC
signalling but with IKEv2 signalling, as specified in clause 4.12.5 (i.e. by
using an IKEv2 Create_Child_SA exchange). The user plane of each PDU Session
consists of one or more Child SAs.
When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state over non-3GPP access, the Service Request
procedure via Untrusted non-3GPP Access is as described in clause 4.2.3.2 (UE
Triggered Service Request) with the following exceptions:
\- All NAS signalling exchanged between the UE and network is transferred
within the established \"signalling IPsec SA\".
\- The (R)AN corresponds to an N3IWF.
\- The user plane between the UE and N3IWF is established not with RRC
signalling but with IKEv2 signalling, as specified in clause 4.12.5 (i.e. by
using an IKEv2 Create_Child_SA exchange). The user plane of each PDU Session
consists of one or more Child SAs.
When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state over non-3GPP access and the network
receives downlink data for a PDU Session over non-3GPP access that has no user
plane, the steps 1-4a in clause 4.2.3.3 (Network Triggered Service Request)
shall be performed with the following exceptions:
\- The (R)AN corresponds to an N3IWF.
\- The user plane between the UE and N3IWF is established (in step 4a) with
IKEv2 signalling, as specified in clause 4.12.5 (i.e. by using an IKEv2
Create_Child_SA exchange). The user plane of each PDU Session consists of one
or more Child SAs.
#### 4.12.4.2 Procedure for the UE context release in the N3IWF
This procedure is used to release the N2 signalling connection and the N3 User
Plane connection. If the procedure is initiated by the AMF the IKEv2 SA for a
UE is being released. The procedure will move the UE from CM-CONNECTED to CM-
IDLE in AMF and all UE related context information is deleted in the N3IWF.
Both N3IWF-initiated and AMF-initiated UE context release in the N3IWF
procedures are shown in Figure 4.12.4.2-1.
Figure 4.12.4.2-1: Procedure for the UE context release in the N3IWF
1\. The UE has already registered in the 5GC and may have established one or
multiple PDU Sessions.
2\. The N3IWF detects that the UE is not reachable.
3\. The N3IWF sends a N2 UE Context Release Request message to the AMF This
step is equivalent to step 1b of Figure 4.2.6-1.
NOTE: AN Release procedure can also be triggered by an AMF internal event and
in that case step 2 and step 3 do not take place.
4\. AMF to N3IWF: If the AMF receives the N2 UE Context Release Request from
N3IWF or if due to an internal AMF event the AMF wants to release N2
signalling, the AMF sends an N2 UE Context Release Command (Cause) to the
N3IWF. The cause indicated is cause from step 3 or a cause due to internal AMF
event. This step is equivalent to step 2 of Figure 4.2.6-1.
5\. If the IKEv2 tunnel has not been released yet, the N3IWF performs the
release of the IPsec tunnel as defined in RFC 7296 [3] indicating to release
the IKE SA and any Child IPSec SA if existing. The N3IWF sends to the UE the
indication of the release reason if received in step 4.
6\. The UE sends an empty INFORMATIONAL Response message to acknowledge the
release of the IKE SA as described in RFC 7296 [3]. The N3IWF deletes the
UE\'s context after receiving the empty INFORMATIONAL Response message.
7\. N3IWF to AMF: The N3IWF confirms the release of the UE-associated
N2-logical connection by returning N2 UE Release Complete (list of PDU Session
ID(s) with active N3 user plane) to the AMF as in step 4 defined in clause
4.2.6. The AMF marks the UE as CM-IDLE state in untrusted non-3GPP access.
8\. For each of the PDU Sessions in the N2 UE Context Release Complete, the
steps 5 to 7 in clause 4.2.6 are performed (PDU Session Update SM Context).
After the AMF receives the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response as in step
7 of clause 4.2.6, the AMF considers the N3 connection as released. If list of
PDU Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane is included in step 3, then this
step is performed before step 4.
#### 4.12.4.3 CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an
existing PDU Session associated with Untrusted non-3GPP Access
The procedure described in clause 4.3.7 (CN-initiated selective deactivation
of UP connection of an existing PDU Session) is used for CN-initiated
selective deactivation of UP connection for an established PDU Session
associated with non-3GPP Access of a UE in CM-CONNECTED state, with the
following exceptions:
\- The NG-RAN corresponds to an N3IWF.
\- The user plane between the UE and N3IWF, i.e. Child SA(s) for the PDU
Session, is released not with RRC signalling but with IKEv2 signalling, as
specified in clause 4.12.7.
### 4.12.5 UE Requested PDU Session Establishment via Untrusted non-3GPP
Access
Clause 4.12.5 specifies how a UE can establish a PDU Session via an untrusted
non-3GPP Access Network as well as to hand over an existing PDU Session
between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. The procedure applies in non-roaming,
roaming with LBO as well as in home-routed roaming scenarios.
For non-roaming and LBO scenarios, if the UE is simultaneously registered to a
3GPP access in a PLMN different from the PLMN of the N3IWF, the functional
entities in the following procedures are located in the PLMN of the N3IWF. For
home-routed roaming scenarios, the AMF, V-SMF and associated UPF in VPLMN in
the following procedure is located in the PLMN of the N3IWF.
The procedure below is based on the PDU Session Establishment procedure
specified in clause 4.3.2.2.1 (for non-roaming and roaming with LBO) and the
PDU Session Establishment procedure specified in clause 4.3.2.2.2 (for home-
routed roaming).
Figure 4.12.5-1: PDU Session establishment via untrusted non-3GPP access
1\. The UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request message to AMF as
specified in step 1 of clause 4.3.2.2.1. This message shall be sent to N3IWF
via the IPsec SA for NAS signalling (established as specified in clause
4.12.2) and the N3IWF shall transparently forward it to AMF in the 5GC.
2a. In the case of non-roaming or roaming with Local Breakout, steps 2-11
specified in clause 4.3.2.2.1are executed according to the PDU Session
Establishment procedure over 3GPP access. In the case of home-routed roaming,
steps 2-14 specified in clause 4.3.2.2.2 are executed according to the PDU
Session Establishment procedure over 3GPP access.
2b. As described in step 12 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, the AMF shall send a N2 PDU
Session Request message to N3IWF to establish the access resources for this
PDU Session.
3\. Based on its own policies and configuration and based on the QoS profiles
received in the previous step, the N3IWF shall determine the number of IPsec
Child SAs to establish and the QoS profiles associated with each IPsec Child
SA. For example, the N3IWF may decide to establish one IPsec Child SA and
associate all QoS profiles with this IPsec Child SA. In this case, all QoS
Flows of the PDU Session would be transferred over one IPsec Child SA.
4a. The N3IWF shall send to UE an IKE Create_Child_SA request according to the
IKEv2 specification in RFC 7296 [3] to establish the first IPsec Child SA for
the PDU Session. The IKE Create_Child_SA request indicates that the requested
IPsec Child SA shall operate in tunnel mode. This request shall include a
3GPP-specific Notify payload which contains (a) the QFI(s) associated with the
Child SA, (b) the identity of the PDU Session associated with this Child SA,
(c) optionally, a DSCP value associated with the Child SA, (d) optionally a
Default Child SA indication and (e) optionally, the Additional QoS Information
specified in clause 4.12a.5
The IKE Create_Child_SA request shall also include another 3GPP-specific
Notify payload, which contains the UP_IP_ADDRESS that is specified in step 8
below.
If a DSCP value is included, then the UE and the N3IWF shall mark all IP
packets sent over this Child SA with this DSCP value. There shall be one and
only one Default Child SA per PDU session. The UE shall send all QoS Flows to
this Child SA for which there is no mapping information to a specific Child
SA. The IKE Create_Child_SA request also contains other information (according
to RFC 7296 [3]) such as the SA payload, the Traffic Selectors (TS) for the
N3IWF and the UE, etc.
After receiving the IKE Create_Child_SA request, if the Additional QoS
Information is received, the UE may reserve non-3GPP Access Network resources
according to the Additional QoS Information.
4b. If the UE accepts the new IPsec Child SA, the UE shall send an IKE
Create_Child_SA response according to the IKEv2 specification in RFC 7296 [3].
During the IPsec Child SA establishment the UE shall not be assigned an IP
address.
4c-4d. If in step 3 the N3IWF determined to establish multiple IPsec Child SAs
for the PDU Session, then additional IPsec Child SAs shall be established,
each one associated with one or more QFI(s), optionally with a DSCP value,
with a UP_IP_ADDRESS and optionally with the Additional QoS Information
specified in clause 4.12a.5. For each IPsec Child SA, if the Additional QoS
Information is received, the UE may reserve non-3GPP Access Network resources
according to the Additional QoS Information for the IPsec Child SA.
5\. After all IPsec Child SAs are established, the N3IWF shall forward to UE
via the signalling IPsec SA (see clause 4.12.2.2) the PDU Session
Establishment Accept message received in step 2b.
6\. The N3IWF shall send to AMF an N2 PDU Session Response.
7\. In the case of non-roaming or roaming with Local Breakout, all steps
specified in clause 4.3.2.2.1 after step 14 are executed according to the PDU
Session Establishment procedure over 3GPP access. In the case of home-routed
roaming, all steps specified in clause 4.3.2.2.2 after step 18 are executed
according to the PDU Session Establishment procedure over 3GPP access.
8\. On the user-plane:
\- When the UE has to transmit an UL PDU, the UE shall determine the QFI
associated with the UL PDU (by using the QoS rules of the PDU Session), it
shall encapsulate the UL PDU inside a GRE packet and shall forward the GRE
packet to N3IWF via the IPsec Child SA associated with this QFI. The header of
the GRE packet carries the QFI associated with the UL PDU. The UE shall
encapsulate the GRE packet into an IP packet with source address the \"inner\"
IP address of the UE and destination address the UP_IP_ADDRESS associated with
the Child SA.
\- When the N3IWF receives a DL PDU via N3, the N3IWF uses the QFI and the
identity of the PDU Session in order to determine the IPsec Child SA to use
for sending the DL PDU over NWu. The N3IWK encapsulates the DL PDU inside a
GRE packet and copies the QFI in the header of the GRE packet. The N3IWF may
include also in the GRE header a Reflective QoS Indicator (RQI), which shall
be used by the UE to enable reflective QoS. The N3IWF shall encapsulate the
GRE packet into an IP packet with source address the UP_IP_ADDRESS associated
with the Child SA and destination address the \"inner\" IP address of the UE.
### 4.12.6 UE or Network Requested PDU Session Modification via Untrusted
non-3GPP access
The UE or network requested PDU Session Modification procedure via untrusted
non-3GPP access is depicted in figure 4.12.6-1. The procedure applies in non-
roaming, roaming with LBO as well as in home-routed roaming scenarios.
For non-roaming and LBO scenarios, the functional entities in the following
procedures are located in the PLMN of the N3IWF.
The procedure below is based on the PDU Session Modification procedure
specified in clause 4.3.3.2 (for non-roaming and roaming with LBO) and on the
PDU Session Modification procedure specified in clause 4.3.3.3 (for home-
routed roaming).
Figure 4.12.6-1: UE or Network Requested PDU Session Modification via
untrusted non-3GPP access
1\. If the PDU Session Modification procedure is initiated by the UE, the UE
shall send a PDU Session Modification Request message to AMF as specified in
step 1 of clause 4.3.2.2. The message shall be sent to N3IWF via the
established IPsec SA for NAS signalling. The N3IWF shall transparently forward
the PDU Session Modification Request to AMF/SMF.
2\. In the case of non-roaming or LBO, the steps 1a (from AMF) to 1e and steps
2-3 as per the PDU Session Modification procedure in clause 4.3.3.2 are
executed.
In the case of home-routed, the steps 1a (from AMF) to 1d and steps 2-3 as per
the PDU Session Modification procedure in clause 4.3.3.3 are executed.
3\. The AMF sends N2 PDU Session Resource Modify Request (N2 SM information
received from SMF, NAS message) message to the N3IWF. This step is the same as
step 4 in clause 4.3.3.2 (for non-roaming and roaming with Local Breakout) and
step 5 in clause 4.3.3.3 (for home-routed roaming).
4\. The N3IWF may issue IKEv2 signalling exchange with the UE that is related
with the information received from SMF according to the IKEv2 specification in
RFC 7296 [3]. Based on the N2 SM information received from the SMF, the N3IWF
may perform one of the following:
4a. The N3IWF may decide to create a new Child SA for the new QoS Flow(s). In
this case, the N3IWF establishes a new Child SA by sending an
IKE_CREATE_CHILD_SA request message, which includes the SA, the PDU Session
ID, the QFI(s), optionally a DSCP value and optionally the Additional QoS
Information specified in clause 4.12a.5. If the Additional QoS Information is
received, the UE may reserve non-3GPP Access Network resources according to
the Additional QoS Information.
4b. The N3IWF may decide to add or remove QoS Flow(s) to/from an existing
Child SA. In this case, the N3WIF updates the QoS Flow and Child SA mapping
information by sending an INFORMATIONAL request message, which includes the
QFI(s) associated with the Child SA and optionally the Additional QoS
Information specified in clause 4.12a.5, which contains the new QoS
information that should be associated with the existing Child SA. If the
Additional QoS Information is received, the UE may update the reserved
non-3GPP Access Network resources for the existing Child SA according to the
Additional QoS Information.
4c. The N3IWF may decide to delete an existing Child SA, e.g. when there is no
QoS Flow mapped to this Child SA. In this case, the N3IWF deletes the existing
Child SA by sending INFORMATIONAL request message, which includes a Delete
payload.
NOTE: If the N3IWF has included the Default Child SA indication during the
establishment of one of the Child SAs of the PDU Session, the N3IWF may not
update the mapping between QoS Flows Child SAs.
5\. The N3IWF acknowledges N2 PDU Session Request by sending a N2 PDU Session
Response Message to the AMF to acknowledge the success or failure of the
request.
6\. In the case of non-roaming or LBO, step 7 as per the PDU Session
Modification procedure in clause 4.3.3.2 is executed. In the case of home-
routed, the steps 8-10 as per the PDU Session Modification procedure in clause
4.3.3.3 are executed.
7\. The N3IWF sends the PDU Session Modification Command to UE (if received in
step 3) and receives the response message from UE.
Steps 4a/4c and step 7 may happen consecutively. Steps 7b map happen before
step 4b/4d.
8\. The N3IWF forwards the NAS message to the AMF.
9\. For non-roaming and roaming with LBO, all the steps after step 10 in
clause 4.3.3.2 are executed according to the general PDU Session Modification
procedure. For home-routed roaming, all steps after step 13 in clause 4.3.3.3
are executed according to the general PDU Session Modification procedure.
### 4.12.7 UE or network Requested PDU Session Release via Untrusted non-3GPP
access
Clause 4.12.7 specifies how a UE or network can release a PDU Session via an
untrusted non-3GPP Access Network. The UE requested PDU Session Release
procedure via Untrusted non-3GPP access applies in non-roaming, roaming with
LBO as well as in home-routed roaming scenarios.
For non-roaming and LBO scenarios, if the UE is simultaneously registered to a
3GPP access in a PLMN different from the PLMN of the N3IWF, the functional
entities in the following procedures are located in the PLMN of the N3IWF. For
home-routed roaming scenarios, the AMF, V-SMF and associated UPF in VPLMN in
the following procedure is located in the PLMN of the N3IWF.
NOTE: If the UE is simultaneously registered to 3GPP access in the same PLMN
as non-3GPP access, when non-3GPP access is not available to the UE (e.g. due
to out of non-3GPP access coverage) or UE is in CM-IDLE for non-3GPP access,
the UE may perform the PDU Session Release procedure via 3GPP access as
described in clause 4.3.4.
Figure 4.12.7-1: UE Requested PDU Session Release via Untrusted non-3GPP
access
1\. One or more PDU Sessions are already established for the UE using the
procedure described in clause 4.12.2.
2\. The UE sends a NAS message (N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Request),
PDU Session ID) to the AMF via the N3IWF as defined in clause 4.3.4.
3\. For non-roaming and roaming with LBO, the steps 1a (from AMF) to 4
according to the PDU Session Release procedure defined in clause 4.3.4.2 are
executed. For home-routed roaming, the steps 1a (from AMF) to step 7 according
to the PDU Session Release procedure defined in clause 4.3.4.3 are executed.
4\. This step is the same as step 4 in clause 4.3.4.2 (non-roaming and LBO)
and step 6 in clause 4.3.4.3 (home-routed roaming).
If the message received from the SMF does not include N2 SM Resource Release
request, the AMF sends N2 Downlink NAS transport (N1 SM container (PDU Session
Release Command), PDU Session ID,Cause) message to the N3IWF and steps 5 to 8
are skipped.
5\. Upon receiving AN session release request message from the AMF, the N3IWF
triggers the release of the corresponding Child SA by sending INFORMATIONAL
EXCHANGE (Delete Payload) to the UE. Delete payload is included in the message
listing the SPIs of the Child SAs to be deleted to this PDU Session as
described in RFC 7296 [3].
6\. The UE responds with INFORMATIONAL EXCHANGE (Delete Payload) message.
Delete payload is included for the paired SAs going in the other direction as
described in RFC 7296 [3].
7\. This step is the same as step 6 in 4.3.4.2 (non-roaming and LBO) and step
8 in clause 4.3.4.3 (home-routed roaming).
8\. For non-roaming and roaming with LBO, steps 7 according to the PDU Session
Release procedure defined in clause 4.3.4.2 are executed. For home-routed
roaming, step 9-10 according to the PDU Session Release procedure defined in
clause 4.3.4.3 are executed.
9\. The N3IWF delivers the NAS message (N1 SM container (PDU Session Release
Command), PDU Session ID, Cause) to the UE.
10\. The UE sends a NAS message (N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Ack),
PDU Session ID) to the N3IWF.
11\. This step is the same as step 9 in 4.3.4.2 (non-roaming and LBO) and step
11 in clause 4.3.4.3 (home-routed roaming).
Steps 5 and 9 may happen consecutively. Step 10 may happen before step 6.
12\. For non-roaming and roaming with LBO, all steps after step 10 in the PDU
Session Release procedure defined in clause 4.3.4.2 are executed. In the case
of home-routed roaming, all steps after step 12 in the PDU Session Release
procedure defined in clause 4.3.4.3 are executed.
The network requested PDU Session Release procedure via Untrusted non-3GPP
access is the same as the network requested PDU Session Release Procedure
specified in clause 4.3.4.2 (for Non-Roaming and Roaming with Local Breakout)
with the following differences:
\- The (R)AN corresponds to an N3IWF.
\- In step 5 the N3IWF upon receiving N2 SM request to release the AN
resources associated with the PDU Session from the AMF, the N3IWF triggers the
release of the corresponding Child SA to the UE as specified in step 5 and 6,
in Figure 4.12.7-1.
\- User Location Information is not included in the step 6, 7a, 9, 10a and 12
of the procedure.
### 4.12.8 Mobility from a non-geographically selected AMF to a geographically
selected AMF
This procedure describes the AMF change that takes place when an UE initially
served via non-3GPP access by an AMF selected based on non-geographical
criteria (e.g. because the UE had no 3GPP access coverage or because only non-
geographically selectable N3IWF are deployed) gets 3GPP access and is now to
be served by an AMF selected in the same PLMN by the NG-RAN based on
geographical criteria.
Figure 4.12.8-1: Mobility from a non-geographically selected AMF to a
geographically selected AMF
1\. The UE registers over non-3GPP access, as described in clause 4.12.2.
During this procedure:
a An AMF (source AMF) is selected by the N3IWF in step 6a, based on non-
geographical criteria (e.g. because the UE has no 3GPP access coverage or
because only non-geographically selectable N3IWF are deployed).
b The UE receives, within the Registration Accept message, a 5G-GUTI
containing a GUAMI of the non-geographically selected AMF. The UE also
receives an Allowed NSSAI and optionally Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI.
2\. The UE may activate PDU Sessions over non-3GPP access, as described in
clause 4.12.5.
3\. The UE gets 3GPP access and issues a Registration Request over 3GPP access
as defined in step 1 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, providing its 5G-GUTI.
If the 5G-GUTI does not indicate an AMF of the same Region ID as that of the
NG-RAN, the NG-RAN selects an AMF Set and an AMF in the AMF Set as described
in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2].
Steps 3 to 22 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 take place including following aspects:
\- step 4 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 takes place i.e. the new AMF invokes the
Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer service operation on the old AMF to
request the UE\'s SUPI and MM Context.
\- in step 5 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, the old AMF includes information about
active NGAP association to N3IWF.
\- in step 18 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, the new AMF modifies the NGAP association
toward N3IWF.
\- in step 21 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, the Registration Accept message shall
include the updated 5G-GUTI that the UE will use to update its 3GPP and
non-3GPP registration contexts.
## 4.12a Procedures for Trusted non-3GPP access
### 4.12a.1 General
Clause 4.12a defines the procedures to support trusted non-3GPP access by
describing the differences compared to the defined procedures in other
clauses.
### 4.12a.2 Registration via Trusted non-3GPP Access
#### 4.12a.2.1 General
Clause 4.12a.2 specifies how a UE can register to 5GC via a trusted non-3GPP
Access Network. The utilized procedure is very similar with the 5GC
registration procedure over untrusted non-3GPP access in clause 4.12.2.2 and
it is based on the Registration procedure specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2. It
uses the same vendor-specific EAP method (called \"EAP-5G\") as the one
specified in clause 4.12.2.1. In this case, the \"EAP-5G\" method is used
between the UE and the TNGF and is utilized for encapsulating NAS messages.
In Registration and subsequent Registration procedures via trusted non-3GPP
access, the NAS messages are always exchanged between the UE and the AMF. When
possible, the UE can be authenticated by reusing the existing UE security
context in AMF.
#### 4.12a.2.2 Registration procedure for trusted non-3GPP access
The UE connects to a trusted non-3GPP Access Network (TNAN) and it also
registers to 5GC over via this TNAN, by using the EAP-based procedure shown in
the figure 4.12a.2.2. This procedure is very similar with the 5GC registration
procedure over untrusted non-3GPP access in clause 4.12.2.2. The link between
the UE and the TNAN can be any data link (L2) that supports EAP encapsulation,
e.g. PPP, PANA, Ethernet, IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.11, etc. The interface between
the TNAP and TNGF is an AAA interface.
Figure 4.12a.2.2-1: Registration via trusted non-3GPP access
0\. The UE selects a PLMN and a TNAN for connecting to this PLMN by using the
Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network selection procedure specified in clause 6.3.12
of TS 23.501 [2]. During this procedure, the UE discovers the PLMNs with which
the TNAN supports trusted connectivity (e.g. \"5G connectivity\").
1\. A layer-2 connection is established between the UE and the TNAP. In the
case of IEEE 802.11 [48], this step corresponds to an 802.11 Association. In
the case of PPP, this step corresponds to a PPP LCP negotiation. In other
types of non-3GPP access (e.g. Ethernet), this step may not be required.
2-3. An EAP procedure is initiated. EAP messages are encapsulated into layer-2
packets, e.g. into IEEE 802.3/802.1x packets, into IEEE 802.11/802.1x packets,
into PPP packets, etc. The NAI provided by the UE indicates that the UE
requests \"5G connectivity\" to a specific PLMN, e.g. NAI =
\"\\@nai.5gc. mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org\". This NAI
triggers the TNAP to send an AAA request to a TNGF, which operates as an AAA
proxy. Between the TNAP and TNGF the EAP packets are encapsulated into AAA
messages. The AAA request also include the TNAP identifier, which can be
treated as the User Location Information.
4-10. An EAP-5G procedure is executed as the one specified in clause 4.12.2.2
for the untrusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:
\- A TNGF key (instead of an N3IWF key) is created in the UE and in the AMF
after the successful authentication. The TNGF key is transferred from the AMF
to TNGF in step 10a (within the N2 Initial Context Setup Request). The TNGF
derives a TNAP key, which is provided to the TNAP. The TNAP key depends on the
non-3GPP access technology (e.g. it is a Pairwise Master Key in the case of
IEEE 802.11 [48]). How these security keys are created, it is specified in TS
33.501 [15].
\- In step 5 the UE shall include the Requested NSSAI in the AN parameters
only if allowed, according to the conditions defined in clause 5.15.9 of TS
23.501 [2], for the trusted non-3GPP access. The UE shall also include a UE Id
in the AN parameters, e.g. a 5G-GUTI if available from a prior registration to
the same PLMN.
\- In the N2 message sent in step 6b, the TNGF includes a UE Location
Information (ULI) that contains a \"null\" IP address (e.g. 0.0.0.0) because
the UE is not yet assigned an IP address. After the UE is assigned an IP
address, the TNGF includes this address in subsequent N2 messages.
\- After receiving the TNGF key from AMF in step 10a, the TNGF shall send to
UE an EAP-Request/5G-Notification packet containing the \"TNGF Contact Info\",
which includes the IP address of TNGF. After receiving an EAP-
Response/5G-Notification packet from the UE in step 10c, the TNGF shall send
message 10d containing the EAP-Success packet.
11\. The TNAP key is used to establish layer-2 security between the UE and
TNAP. In the case of IEEE 802.11 [48], a 4-way handshake is executed, which
establishes a security context between the WLAN AP and the UE that is used to
protect unicast and multicast traffic over the air.
12\. The UE receives IP configuration from the TNAN, e.g. with DHCP.
13\. At this point, the UE has successfully connected to the TNAN and has
obtained IP configuration. The UE sets up a secure NWt connection with the
TNGF as follows:
The UE initiates an IKE_INIT exchange using the IP address of TNGF received
during the EAP-5G signalling, in step 10b. Subsequently, the UE initiates an
IKE_AUTH exchange and provides its identity. The identity provided by the UE
in the IKEv2 signalling should be the same as the UE Id included in the AN
parameters in step 5. This enables the TNGF to locate the TNGF key that was
created before for this UE, during the authentication in step 8. The TNGF key
is used for mutual authentication. NULL encryption is negotiated between the
UE and the TNGF, as specified in RFC 2410 [49].
In step 13c, the TNGF provides to UE (a) an \"inner\" IP address, (b) a
NAS_IP_ADDRESS and a TCP port number and (c) a DSCP value. After this step, an
IPsec SA is established between the UE and TNGF. This is referred to as the
\"signalling IPsec SA\" and operates in Tunnel mode. Operation in Tunnel mode
enables the use of MOBIKE [40] for re-establishing the IPsec SAs when the IP
address of the UE changes during mobility events. All IP packets exchanged
between the UE and TNGF via the \"signalling IPsec SA\" shall be marked with
the above DSCP value. The UE and the TNAP may map the DSCP value to a QoS
level (e.g. to an EDCA Access Class [48]) supported by the underlying non-3GPP
Access Network. The mapping of a DSCP value to a QoS level of the non-3GPP
Access Network is outside the scope of 3GPP.
Right after the establishment of the \"signalling IPsec SA\", the UE shall
setup a TCP connection with the TNGF by using the NAS_IP_ADDRESS and the TCP
port number received in step 13c. The UE shall send NAS messages within TCP/IP
packets with source address the \"inner\" IP address of the UE and destination
address the NAS_IP_ADDRESS. The TNGF shall send NAS messages within TCP/IP
packets with source address the NAS_IP_ADDRESS and destination address the
\"inner\" IP address of the UE.
This concludes the setup of the NWt connection between the UE and the TNGF.
All subsequent NAS messages between UE and TNGF are carried over this NWt
connection (i.e. encapsulated in TCP/IP/ESP).
14\. After the NWt connection is successfully established, the TNGF responds
to AMF with an N2 Initial Context Setup Response message.
15\. Finally, the NAS Registration Accept message is sent by the AMF and is
forwarded to UE via the established NWt connection. Now the UE can use the
TNAN (a) to transfer non-seamless offload traffic and (b) to establish one or
more PDU Sessions.
#### 4.12a.2.3 Emergency Registration for trusted non-3GPP Access
Emergency Registration procedure for trusted non-3GPP access shall be
supported as specified in clause 4.12.2.3 for untrusted non-3GPP access with
the following differences:
\- The regular registration shall refer to clause 4.12a.2.
\- The N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.
\- The N3IWF key is substituted by the TNGF key.
### 4.12a.3 Deregistration procedure for Trusted non-3GPP access
The Deregistration procedure via trusted non-3GPP access shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.12.3 for the untrusted non-3GPP access with the
following modifications:
\- The untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access
point (TNAP).
\- The N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.
\- If the UE has reserved QoS resources over non-3GPP access by using the
Additional QoS Information (specified in clause 4.12a.5), then the UE shall
release these resources.
### 4.12a.4 N2 procedures via Trusted non-3GPP Access
#### 4.12a.4.1 Service Request procedures via Trusted non-3GPP Access
The Service Request procedure via trusted non-3GPP access shall be supported
as specified in clause 4.12.4.1 for the untrusted non-3GPP access with the
following modifications:
\- The untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access.
\- The N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.
\- The user plane between the UE and TNGF is established with IKEv2
signalling, as specified in clause 4.12a.5 (i.e. by using an IKEv2
Create_Child_SA exchange). The IKEv2 Create Child SA Request shall include the
Additional QoS Information to reserve non-3GPP specific QoS resources as
defined in clause 4.12a.5.
#### 4.12a.4.2 Procedure for the UE context release in the TNGF
This procedure for releasing the N2 signalling connection and the N3 user
plane connection for a UE connected to 5GC via trusted non-3GPP access, shall
be the same as the procedure specified in clause 4.12.4.2 for the untrusted
non-3GPP access with the following modifications:
\- The untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access
point (TNAP).
\- The N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.
\- If the UE has reserved any non-3GPP specific QoS resources, the UE releases
these resources when the IKEv2 Child SA is released.
#### 4.12a.4.3 CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an
existing PDU Session associated with Trusted non-3GPP Access
The procedure described in clause 4.3.7 (CN-initiated selective deactivation
of UP connection of an existing PDU Session) is used for CN-initiated
selective deactivation of UP connection for an established PDU Session
associated with trusted non-3GPP Access for a UE in CM-CONNECTED state, with
the following exceptions:
\- The NG-RAN corresponds to a TNAN including a TNGF.
\- The user plane between the UE and TNGF, i.e. Child SA(s) for the PDU
Session, is released not with RRC signalling but with IKEv2 signalling, as
specified in clause 4.12a.7.
\- If the UE has reserved any non-3GPP specific QoS resources, the UE releases
these resources when the IKEv2 Child SA is released.
### 4.12a.5 UE Requested PDU Session Establishment via Trusted non-3GPP Access
After the UE registers to 5GC via trusted non-3GPP access, the UE may request
a PDU Session establishment by using the same procedure as the one specified
in clause 4.12.5 for untrusted non-3GPP access, with the following
modifications:
\- The N3IWF in Figure 4.12.5-1 should be substituted with a TNGF and the
Untrusted non-3GPP access should be substituted with a Trusted non-3GPP Access
Point (TNAP).
\- The TNGF may send a TNGF Identities parameter to AMF inside an N2 Uplink
NAS Transport message. The TNGF Identities parameter contains a list of
identifiers (i.e. FQDNs or IP addresses) of N3 terminations supported by the
TNGF. If received by the AMF, it shall forward it to the SMF, which may use it
as input to UPF selection.
\- The IKEv2 Create Child SA Request message that is sent by the TNGF to UE
(in steps 4a and 4c), in order to establish a child SA for one or more QoS
flows, shall also include Additional QoS Information. The Additional QoS
Information shall contain:
a) If the IPsec child SA carries a GBR flow: QoS Characteristics and GBR QoS
Flow Information:
\- The QoS Characteristics are associated with the 5QI of the GBR flow and are
defined in clause 5.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The TNGF either receives the QoS
Characteristics via the N2 interface (in the case of a dynamically assigned
5QI), or is pre-configured with the QoS Characteristics (in the case of a
standardized 5QI).
\- The GBR QoS Flow Information (defined in TS 38.413 [10]) is part of the QoS
Profile received via the N2 interface and contains: MFBR, GFBR and optionally
Maximum Packet Loss Rate. The Notification Control is not included in the QoS
profile.
b) If the IPsec child SA carries a non-GBR flow: QoS Characteristics:
\- The QoS Characteristics are defined in bullet a) above.
The TNGF may aggregate multiple GBR flows or multiple non-GBR flows into the
same IPsec child SA. In this case, the TNGF derives, in an implementation
specific way, the QoS Characteristics of the aggregated flow by considering
the QoS Characteristics of the individual flows. Similarly, the TNGF derives,
in an implementation specific way, the GBR QoS Flow Information of an
aggregated GBR flow by considering the GBR QoS Flow Information of the
individual GBR flows.
NOTE: The above behaviour of the TNGF does not create any impact on the N2
interface.
\- After receiving an IKEv2 Create Child SA Request message, the UE shall use
the Additional QoS Information contained in this message to determine what QoS
resources to reserve over the non-3GPP access, including e.g. guaranteed bit
rates and delay bounds for UL/DL communication. How the UE determines what QoS
resources to reserve over the non-3GPP access and how these QoS resources are
reserved, is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.
\- If the UE fails to reserve QoS resources over non-3GPP access for the QoS
flows associated with the child SA (e.g. because the non-3GPP Access Network
rejects the allocation of the requested bit rates), the UE shall reject the
IKEv2 Child SA Request.
### 4.12a.6 UE or network Requested PDU Session Modification via Trusted
non-3GPP access
The UE or network requested PDU Session Modification procedure via trusted
non-3GPP access is the same procedure as the one specified in clause 4.12.6
for untrusted non-3GPP access, with the following modifications:
\- The N3IWF in Figure 4.12.6-1 should be substituted with a TNGF and the
Untrusted non-3GPP access should be substituted with a Trusted non-3GPP Access
Point (TNAP).
\- The IKEv2 Create Child SA Request sent by the TNGF in step 4a, in order to
create new QoS flow(s) for the PDU Session, shall include the Additional QoS
Information defined in clause 4.12a.5. If the UE decides to reserve QoS
resources over non-3GPP access for the QoS flows associated with the Child SA
but fails to reserve these resources, the UE shall reject the IKEv2 Child SA
Request.
\- The IKEv2 Informational Request sent by the TNGF in step 4b shall include
the Additional QoS Information defined in clause 4.12a.5, when the IKEv2
Informational Request is sent to modify one or more existing QoS flows. If the
UE decides to reserve QoS resources over non-3GPP access for the QoS flows
associated with the Child SA but fails to reserve these resources, the UE
shall indicate the failure in the IKEv2 Informational Response. The TNGF
includes the list of QoS flows which are failed to setup in step 5.
\- The IKEv2 Informational Request sent by the TNGF in step 4c to release an
existing IKEv2 Child SA shall trigger the UE to release the resources reserved
over non-3GPP access for this IKEv2 Child SA.
\- If, after the PDU Session establishment, the UE determines that the QoS
resources reserved over non-3GPP access for the QoS flows associated with a
Child SA are released, then the UE shall initiate an INFORMATIONAL exchange,
as specified in RFC 7296 [3], to delete the Child SA. After the Child SA is
deleted, the TNGF initiates PDU Session Modification procedure as described in
step 1e, in clause 4.3.3.2, including the list of QoS flows, which are
released.
### 4.12a.7 UE or network Requested PDU Session Release via Trusted non-3GPP
access
The UE or the network can release a PDU Session via a trusted non-3GPP Access
Network as specified in clause 4.12.7 for the untrusted non-3GPP access with
the following modifications:
\- The untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access
point (TNAP).
\- The N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.
\- If the UE reserved any non-3GPP specific QoS resources, the UE releases
these resources when the IKEv2 Child SA is released.
### 4.12a.8 Mobility from a non-geographically selected AMF to a
geographically selected AMF
The procedure specified in clause 4.12.8 for untrusted non-3GPP access applies
also to the trusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:
\- The untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access
point (TNAP).
\- The N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.
\- The PDU Session is activated in step 2 as specified in clause 4.12a.5.
### 4.12a.9 Support of mobility from source to target TNAP
In this Release, if the UE moves from a source TNAP to a target TNAP, the UE
shall perform a full authentication via the target TNAP to re-connect to the
5G system.
## 4.12b Procedures for devices that do not support 5GC NAS over WLAN access
### 4.12b.1 General
As specified in clause 4.2.8.5 of TS 23.501 [2], devices that do not support
5GC NAS signalling over WLAN access (referred to as \"Non-5G-Capable over
WLAN\" devices, or N5CW devices for short), may access 5GC in a PLMN via a
trusted WLAN Access Network that supports a Trusted WLAN Interworking Function
(TWIF). The following clause specifies how a N5CW device can be registered to
5GC and how it can send data via a PDU Session.
A N5CW device may be 5G-capable over 3GPP access, in which case it is also a
5G UE over 3GPP access.
### 4.12b.2 Initial Registration & PDU Session Establishment
Figure 4.12b.2-1 illustrates how the N5CW device can connect to a trusted WLAN
Access Network and simultaneously register to a 5G core network. A single EAP-
based authentication procedure is executed for connecting the N5CW device to
the trusted WLAN Access Network and for registering the N5CW device to the 5G
core network.
Figure 4.12b.2-1: Initial registration and PDU session establishment
0\. The N5CW device selects a PLMN and a trusted WLAN that supports \"5G
connectivity-without-NAS\" to this PLMN by using the procedure specified in
clause 6.3.12a of TS 23.501 [2], \"Access Network selection for devices that
do not support 5GC NAS over WLAN\".
Steps 1-10: Initial registration to 5GC.
1\. The N5CW device associates with the selected trusted WLAN and the EAP
authentication procedure is initiated.
2\. The N5CW device provides its Network Access Identity (NAI). The Trusted
WLAN Access Point (TWAP) selects a Trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF),
e.g. based on the received realm and sends an AAA request to the selected
TWIF.
If the N5CW device has not registered over 3GPP access to 5GC of the selected
PLMN when the above procedure is initiated, then the NAI includes the SUCI as
specified in clause 28.7.7 of TS 23.003 [33]. For example,
NAI=type1.rid678.schid0.useriduser17\@nai.5gc-
nn.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org. If the selected PLMN is VPLMN, the
N5CW device may use the Decorated NAI format as specified in clause 28.7.9 of
TS 23.003 [33] to indicate to TWAN which is the VPLMN to be selected, for
example, NAI=nai.5gc-
nn.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org!type1.rid678.schid0.useriduser17\@nai.5gc-
nn.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org.
If the N5CW device has registered to 5GC over 3GPP access to 5GC of the
selected PLMN (i.e. it is also a 5G UE) when the above procedure is initiated,
then the NAI includes the 5G-GUTI assigned to N5CW device over 3GPP access.
This enables the TWIF in step 4a below to select the same AMF as the one
serving the N5CW device over 3GPP access.
The NAI provided by the N5CW device in step 2b indicates that the N5CW device
wants \"5G connectivity-without-NAS\" towards a specific PLMN (i.e. the
HPLMN). For example, with NAI=\\@nai.5gc-
nn.mnc123.mcc45.3gppnetwork.org, the N5CW device indicates that it wants \"5G
connectivity-without-NAS\" (5gc-nn) to the PLMN with MCC=45 and MNC=123.
3\. The TWIF creates a 5GC Registration Request message on behalf of the N5CW
device. The TWIF uses default values to populate the parameters in the
Registration Request message, which are the same for all N5CW devices. The
Registration type indicates \"Initial Registration\".
If the TWIF receives a Decorated NAI and it supports the Decorated NAI, in
Registration Request message the TWIF send the NAI which corresponds to the
HPLMN by removing the decoration, for example
NAI=type1.rid678.schid0.useriduser17\@nai.5gc-
nn.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org.
4\. The TWIF selects an AMF (e.g. by using the 5G-GUTI in the NAI, or selects
the AMF of the VPLMN indicated by the realm of the decoration in the Decorated
NAI, for example \"mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org\" or
selects the AMF by using the local configuration. TWIF sends an N2 message to
the AMF including the Registration Request, the User Location and an AN Type.
5\. The AMF triggers an authentication procedure by sending a request to AUSF
indicating the AN type.
6\. An EAP authentication procedure takes place between the N5CW device and
AUSF. Over the N2 interface, the EAP messages are encapsulated within NAS
Authentication messages. The type of EAP authentication procedure is specified
in TS 33.501 [15].
7\. After a successful authentication, the AUSF sends to AMF the EAP-Success
message and the created SEAF key. The AMF derives an AN key from the received
SEAF key.
8\. The NAS Security Mode Command (SMC) is sent from the AMF to the TWIF. The
selected NAS security algorithms of integrity protection and ciphering are set
to NULL.
9\. The AMF sends an N2 Initial Context Setup Request and provides the AN key
to TWIF. In turn, the TWIF derives a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) from the AN key
and sends the PMK key and the EAP-Success message to the Trusted WLAN Access
Point, which forwards the EAP-Success to the N5CW device. The PMK is the key
used to secure the WLAN air-interface communication according to IEEE 802.11
specification [48]. A layer-2 or layer-3 connection is established between the
Trusted WLAN Access Point and the TWIF for transporting all user-plane traffic
of the N5CW device to TWIF. This connection is later bound to an N3 connection
that is created for this N5CW device.
10\. Finally, the AMF sends a Registration Accept message to TWIF. At this
point, the N5CW device is connected to the WLAN Access Network and is
registered to 5GC.
Steps 20-21: PDU Session Establishment.
20\. The TWIF creates a PDU Session Establishment Request message on behalf of
the N5CW device and sends this message to AMF. This may be triggered by
receiving an IP configuration request (e.g. DHCP Offer/Request) from the N5CW
device. The TWIF may use default values to populate the parameters in the PDU
Session Establishment Request message, but may also skip some PDU session
parameters and let the AMF or the SMF determine these parameters based on the
N5CW device subscription information received during the registration
procedure. This way, default PDU session parameters can be used per N5CW
device.
The value of the PDU Session id provided by TWIF in step 20c shall always be
the same. It will be a value reserved for the PDU sessions requested by the
TWIF and it will be different from the values that can be used by the N5CW
device when requesting a PDU session over 3GPP access. This way, the PDU
session id provided by the TWIF cannot be the same with the PDU Session Id of
any PDU session established by the N5CW device over 3GPP access.
21\. The AMF sends upon request of the SMF an N2 PDU Session Request message
to TWIF in order to reserve the appropriate Access Network resources. This N2
message includes the PDU Session Establishment Accept message. In step 21b,
the TWIF may reserve WLAN access resources for the user-plane communication
between the N5CW device and TWIF. If and how this resource reservation is
performed is outside the scope of 3GPP.
After the establishment of the PDU session, the TWIF assigns IP configuration
data to N5CW device (e.g. with DHCP). The IP address assigned to N5CW device
is the IP address allocated to the PDU session.
Step 25: User plane communication.
The TWIF binds the N5CW device-specific L2/L3 connection created in step 9g
with the N3 connection created in step 21. All user-plane traffic sent by the
N5CW device is forwarded to TWIF via the L2/L3 connection and then to UPF via
the N3 connection. The TWIF operates as a Layer-2 relay.
The TWIF may receive URSP rules (see TS 23.503 [20]), which indicate the
traffic that should be offloaded locally by TWIF (sent outside the PDU
session) and the traffic that should be sent inside the PDU session.
The above procedure supports only one PDU session per N5CW device whose
parameters are either configured for all N5CW devices in the TWIF or are
derived from default values in the N5CW device subscription.
If the TWIF is co-located with one or more local UPFs then:
\- In step 20c (N2 Uplink NAS Transport), the TWIF may send a TWIF Identities
parameter to AMF. The TWIF Identities parameter contains a list of identifiers
(i.e. FQDNs or IP addresses) of N3 terminations supported by the TWIF.
\- If received by the AMF, it shall forward it to the SMF when invoking
Nsmf_PDUSessionCreateSMContext i.e. at the establishment of the PDU Session.
The SMF may use this information to select a local UPF for the PDU Session.
### 4.12b.3 Deregistration procedure
The Deregistration procedure for devices (N5CW devices) that do not support 5G
NAS signalling over WLAN access shall be supported as specified in clause
4.12a.3 for the trusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:
\- The TNAP is substituted by a trusted WLAN access point (TWAP).
\- The TNGF is substituted by the Trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF).
\- The TWIF sends and receives NAS deregistration request/accept messages on
behalf of N5CW device.
\- For both UE/Network-initiated deregistration procedures, the TWIF may
initiate the release of Yt\' connection between the N5CW device and TWIF.
\- UE-initiated deregistration procedure can be initiated by the TWIF, when it
has lost connectivity to the N5CW device.
### 4.12b.4 N2 procedures
#### 4.12b.4.1 Service Request procedures
The Service Request procedure for devices that do not support 5G NAS
signalling over WLAN access shall be used by a TWIF when the CM state in TWIF
for a N5CW device is CM-IDLE over Trusted WLAN to request the re-establishment
of the NAS signalling connection and the re-establishment of the user plane
for all or some of the PDU Sessions which are associated to non-3GPP access.
The Service Request procedure for N5CW devices shall be used by a TWIF when
the CM state in TWIF for a N5CW device is CM-CONNECTED over trusted WLAN to
request the re-establishment of the user plane for one or more PDU Sessions
which are associated to non-3GPP access.
This Service Request procedure shall be supported as specified in clause
4.12a.4.1 for the trusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:
\- The trusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted WLAN access point
(TWAP).
\- The TNGF is substituted by the TWIF.
\- The TWIF sends and receives NAS messages on behalf of N5CW device.
\- The user plane between the N5CW device and TWIF is established with Yt\'
connection instead of IKEv2 signalling.
#### 4.12b.4.2 Procedure for the UE context release in the TWIF
This procedure for releasing the N2 signalling connection and the N3 user
plane connection for a N5CW device connected to 5GC via trusted WLAN access,
shall be the same as the procedure specified in clause 4.12a.4.2 for the
trusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:
\- The trusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a TWAP.
\- The TNGF is substituted by the TWIF.
\- The TWIF may initiate the release of Yt\' connection between the N5CW
device and TWIF.
#### 4.12b.4.3 CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an
existing PDU Session
The procedure described in clause 4.3.7 (CN-initiated selective deactivation
of UP connection of an existing PDU Session) is used for CN-initiated
selective deactivation of UP connection for an established PDU Session
associated with Trusted WLAN access for a N5CW device in CM-CONNECTED state,
with the following exceptions:
\- The NG-RAN corresponds to a TNAN including a TWIF.
\- The user plane between the N5CW device and TWIF is released without neither
RRC signalling nor IKEv2 signalling.
## 4.13 Specific services
### 4.13.1 General
Clause 4.13 defines the additional procedures or additions to the existing
procedures to support specific services such as SMS over NAS.
### 4.13.2 Application Triggering
#### 4.13.2.1 General
The AF invokes the Nnef_Trigger service to request that the network send an
Application trigger to the UE.
#### 4.13.2.2 The procedure of \"Application Triggering\" Service
Figure 4.13.2.2-1: Device triggering procedure via Nnef
1\. The AF determines the need to trigger the device. If the AF has no contact
details for the NEF, it shall discover and select NEF services.
2\. The AF invokes the Nnef_Trigger_Delivery request service.
3\. The NEF checks that the AF is authorised to send trigger requests and that
the AF has not exceeded its quota or rate of trigger submission over Nnef. If
this check fails, the NEF sends an Nnef_Trigger_Delivery response with a cause
value indicating the reason for the failure condition and the flow stops at
this step. Otherwise, the flow continues with step 4.
4\. The NEF invokes Nudm_SDM_Get (Identifier Translation, GPSI and AF
Identifier) to resolve the GPSI to SUPI when the AF is authorized to trigger
the UE.
NOTE 1: Optionally, mapping from GPSI (External Id) to GPSI (MSISDN) is also
provided for legacy SMS infrastructure not supporting MSISDN-less SMS.
5\. The UDM may invoke the Nudr_DM_Query service to retrieve a list of AF\'s
that are allowed to trigger the UE and determines, based on UDM policy, which
identifier (SUPI or MSISDN) should be used to trigger the UE. The UDM provides
a Nudm_SDM_Get response (SUPI, optionally MSISDN. If the AF is not allowed to
send a trigger message to this UE, or there is no valid subscription
information for this user, the NEF sends an Nnef_Trigger_Delivery response
with a cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition and the
flow stops at this step. Otherwise this flow continues with step 6.
NOTE 2: The presence of an MSISDN in the reply is interpreted as an indication
to the NEF that MSISDN is used (instead of IMSI) to identify the UE when
sending the SMS to the SMS-SC via T4.
6\. The NEF invokes Nudm_UECM_Get (GPSI, SMS) to retrieve the UE SMSF
identities.
7\. The UDM may invoke the Nudr_DM_Query service to retrieve the UE SMSF
identities. The UDM provides a Nudm_UECM_Get response with the corresponding
UE SMSF identities. UDM policy (possibly dependent on the VPLMN ID) may
influence which serving node identities are returned.
NOTE 3: The NEF can cache serving node information for the UE. However, this
can increase the probability of trigger delivery attempt failures when the
cached serving node information is stale.
8\. The NEF selects a suitable SMS-SC based on configured information. The NEF
acts as an MTC-IWF and sends a Submit Trigger (GPSI, SUPI, AF Identifier,
trigger reference number, validity period, priority, SMSF serving node ID(s)
(if available, are obtained from UDM in step 7), SMS Application port ID,
trigger payload, Trigger Indication) message to the SMS-SC.
If the NEF indicates that \"Absent subscriber\" was received from the UDM, the
SMS-SC should not submit the message, but store it directly and send Routing
Information for SM to request the UDM to add the SMS-SC address to the Message
Waiting List.
9\. The SMS-SC sends a Submit Trigger Confirm message to the NEF to confirm
that the submission of the SMS has been accepted by the SMS-SC.
10\. The NEF sends a Nnef_Trigger_Delivery response to the AF to indicate if
the Device Trigger Request has been accepted for delivery to the UE.
11\. The SMS_SC performs MT SMS delivery as defined in clause 4.13.3. The SMS-
SC may provide the routing information that it received in step 6 to SMS-GMSC
to avoid UDM interrogation. The SMS-SC generates the necessary CDR information
and includes the AF Identifier. The SMS Application port ID, which is included
in the SM User Data Header and the Trigger Indication are included in the CDRs
in order to enable differentiated charging. The SMS-SC stores the trigger
payload, without routing information. If the message delivery fails and is
attempted to be delivered again, UDM interrogation will be performed. If the
message delivery fails and the validity period of this trigger message is not
set to zero, the SMS-SC shall send a SM Message Delivery Status Report to
request the UDM to add the SMS-SC address to the Message Waiting list. When
the message delivery is later re-attempted, a new UDM interrogation will be
performed by the SMS-GMSC using SUPI or MSISDN. UDM interrogations using SUPI
shall not be forwarded or relayed to SMS-Router or IP-SM-GWs. The UDM may
include up to four serving node identities (MSC or MME, SGSN, IP-SM-GW, AMF)
in the response to SMS-GMSC.
12\. If the message delivery fails (either directly or when validity period of
the trigger message expires) or when the message delivery succeeds, the SMS-SC
shall send a Message Delivery Report (cause code, trigger reference number, AF
Identifier) to the NEF.
13\. The NEF provides a Nnef_Trigger_DeliveryNotify message to the AF with a
Delivery Report indicating the trigger delivery outcome (e.g. succeeded,
unknown or failed and the reason for the failure). The NEF generates the
necessary CDR information including the GPSI and AF Identifier.
14\. In response to the received device trigger, the UE takes specific actions
and may take into consideration the content of the trigger payload. This
action typically involves initiation of immediate or later communication with
the AF.
### 4.13.3 SMS over NAS procedures
#### 4.13.3.1 Registration procedures for SMS over NAS
Figure 4.13.3.1-1: Registration procedure supporting SMS over NAS
1\. During Registration procedure in 5GS defined in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, to
enable SMS over NAS transporting, the UE includes an \"SMS supported\"
indication in Registration Request in step 1-3 indicating the UE\'s capability
for SMS over NAS transport. The \"SMS supported\" indication indicates whether
the UE supports SMS delivery over NAS.
2\. Step 4 to step 14 of the Registration procedure in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 are
performed. The AMF may retrieve the SMS Subscription data and UE Context in
SMSF data using Nudm_SDM_Get. This requires that UDM may retrieve this
information from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query. The UDM includes the SMSF information
in the Nudm_SDM_Get response message if the stored SMSF belongs to the same
PLMN of the AMF. After a successful response is received and if SMS service is
allowed, the AMF subscribes to be notified using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe when the
SMS Subscription data is modified and UDM may subscribe to UDR by
Nudr_DM_Subscribe.
The AMF can also receive UE context information containing SMSF Information
from old AMF. When AMF re-allocation happens during the Registration
procedure, the old AMF transfers SMSF Information to the new AMF as part of UE
context in step 5 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1.
NOTE 1: The AMF can, instead of the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, use the
Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report Indication that
triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed data if the
corresponding feature is supported by both the AMF and the UDM.
3\. If the \"SMS supported\" indication is included in the Registration
Request, the AMF checks in the SMS Subscription data that was received in step
2 whether the SMS service is allowed to the UE. If SMS service is allowed and
the UE context received in step 2 includes an available SMSF of the serving
PLMN, the AMF activates this SMSF Address and continues the registration
procedure. If SMS service is allowed but an SMSF of the serving PLMN was not
received in step 2, the AMF discovers and selects an SMSF to serve the UE as
described in clause 6.3.10 of TS 23.501 [2].
4\. Step 15 to step 20 of the Registration procedure in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 are
performed.
5\. The AMF invokes Nsmsf_SMService_Activate service operation from the SMSF.
The invocation includes AMF address, Access Type, RAT Type, Trace
Requirements, GPSI (if available) and SUPI. AMF uses the SMSF Information
derived from step 3. Trace Requirements is provided if it has been received by
AMF as part of subscription data.
6\. The SMSF discovers a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2].
7a. If the UE context for the current Access Type already exists in the SMSF,
the SMSF shall replace the old AMF address with the new AMF address.
Otherwise, the SMSF considers this a Registration request from a new Access
Type and the SMSF registers with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration with
Access Type. As a result, the UDM stores the following information: SUPI, SMSF
identity, SMSF address, Access Type in UE Context in SMSF data. The UDM may
further store SMSF Information in UDR by Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, Subscription
Data, UE Context in SMSF data).
If the Nsmsf_SMService_Activate request contains two Access Types and one of
them is already registered in the SMSF, the SMSF shall replace the old AMF
address with the new AMF address for that Access Type. The SMSF shall then
register the other Access Type with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration
request.
7b-7c SMSF retrieves SMS Management Subscription data (e.g. SMS teleservice,
SMS barring list) using Nudm_SDM_Get and this requires that UDM may get this
information from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query (SUPI, Subscription Data, SMS Management
Subscription data). After a successful response is received, the SMSF
subscribes to be notified using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe when the SMS Management
Subscription data is modified and UDM may subscribe to notifications from UDR
by Nudr_DM_Subscribe.
SMSF also creates a UE context to store the SMS subscription information and
the AMF address that is serving this UE.
NOTE 2: The SMSF can, instead of the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, use the
Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report Indication that
triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed data if the
corresponding feature is supported by both the SMSF and the UDM.
8\. The SMSF responds back to the AMF with Nsmsf_SMService_Activate service
operation response message. The AMF stores the SMSF Information received as
part of the UE context.
9\. The AMF includes the \"SMS allowed\" indication to the UE in the
Registration Accept message of step 21 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 only after step 8
in which the AMF has received a positive indication from the selected SMSF.
The \"SMS allowed\" indication in the Registration Accept message indicates to
the UE whether the network allows the SMS message delivery over NAS.
#### 4.13.3.2 Deregistration procedures for SMS over NAS
If UE indicates to AMF that it no longer wants to send and receive SMS over
NAS (e.g. not including \"SMS supported\" indication in subsequent
Registration Request message) or AMF considers that UE is deregistered on
specific Access Type(s) or AMF receives Deregistration Notification from UDM
for specific Access Type(s) indicating UE Initial Registration, Subscription
Withdrawn or 5GS to EPS Mobility as specified in clause 5.2.3.2.2, then:
\- AMF may, if the UE is not registered at other Access Type at the AMF any
more, unsubscribe from SMS Subscription data changes notification with the UDM
by means of the Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe service operation.
\- AMF invokes Nsmsf_SMService_Deactivate service operation to trigger the
release of UE Context for SMS on SMSF for the impacted Access Type(s) based on
local configurations.
\- AMF may, if the UE is not registered at other Access Type at the AMF
anymore, delete or deactivate the stored SMSF address in its UE Context.
\- The SMSF unsubscribes from SMS Management Subscription data changes
notification with the UDM by means of the Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe service
operation if the UE is not registered at other Access Type for SMS over NAS
service at the SMSF anymore.
\- The SMSF shall invoke Nudm_UECM_Deregistration (SUPI, NF ID, Access Type)
service operation from UDM to trigger UDM to delete SMSF address of the UE for
the impacted Access Type(s). The SMSF also removes the UE Context for SMS for
the impacted Access Type(s), including AMF address.
\- The UDM may update UE context in SMSF in UDR by Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI,
Subscription Data, SMS Subscription data, SMSF address). The UDM may remove
the corresponding subscription of data change notification in UDR by
Nudr_DM_Unsubscribe service operation.
#### 4.13.3.3 MO SMS over NAS in CM-IDLE (baseline)
Figure 4.13.3.3-1: MO SMS over NAS
1\. The UE performs domain selection for UE originating SMS as defined in
clause 5.16.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2] if SMS delivery via non 3GPP access is
allowed and possible. If an UE under CM-IDLE state is going to send uplink SMS
message, then UE and network perform the UE Triggered Service Request
procedure firstly as defined in clause 4.2.3.2 to establish a NAS signalling
connection to AMF.
2a. The UE builds the SMS message to be sent as defined in TS 23.040 [7] (i.e.
the SMS message consists of CP-DATA/RP-DATA/TPDU/SMS-SUBMIT parts). The SMS
message is encapsulated in an NAS message with an indication indicating that
the NAS message is for SMS transporting. The UE send the NAS message to the
AMF.
2b. The AMF forwards the SMS message and SUPI to the SMSF serving the UE over
N20 message by invoking Nsmsf_SMService_UplinkSMS service operation. In order
to permit the SMSF to create an accurate charging record, the AMF adds the
IMEISV, the current UE Location Information (ULI) of the UE as defined in
clause 5.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2] and, if the UE has sent the SMS via 3GPP access,
the local time zone.
2c. The SMSF invokes Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation
to forward SMS ack message to AMF.
2d. The AMF forwards the SMS ack message from the SMSF to the UE using
downlink unit data message.
3-5. The SMSF checks the SMS management subscription data. If SMS delivery is
allowed, the procedure defined in TS 23.040 [7] applies.
6a-6b. The SMSF forwards the submit report to AMF by invoking
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation which is forwarded to
UE via Downlink NAS transport. If the SMSF knows the submit report is the last
message to be transferred for UE, the SMSF shall include a last message
indication in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation so
that the AMF knows no more SMS data is to be forwarded to UE.
NOTE: The behaviour of AMF based on the \"last message indication\" is
implementation specific.
If the UE has more than one SMS message to send, the AMF and SMSF forwards SMS
/SMS ack/submit report the same way as described in step 2a-6b.
6c-6d. When no more SMS is to be sent, UE returns a CP-ack as defined in TS
23.040 [7] to SMSF. The AMF forwards the SMS ack message by invoking
Nsmsf_SMService_UplinkSMS service operation to SMSF.
#### 4.13.3.4 Void
#### 4.13.3.5 MO SMS over NAS in CM-CONNECTED
MO SMS in CM-CONNECTED State procedure is specified by reusing the MO SMS in
CM-IDLE State without the UE Triggered Service Request procedure.
#### 4.13.3.6 MT SMS over NAS in CM-IDLE state via 3GPP access
Figure 4.13.3.6-1: MT SMS over NAS in CM_IDLE state via 3GPP access
1-3 MT SMS interaction between SC/SMS-GMSC/UDM follow the current procedure as
defined in TS 23.040 [7]. If there are two AMFs serving the UE, one is for
3GPP access and another is for non-3GPP access, there are two SMSF addresses
stored in UDM/UDR. The UDM shall return both SMSF addresses.
4\. The SMSF checks the SMS management subscription data. If SMS delivery is
allowed, SMSF invokes Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability service operation to AMF.
AMF pages the UE using the procedure defined in clause 4.2.3.4. The UE
responds to the page with Service Request procedure.
If the AMF indicates SMSF that UE is not reachable, the procedure of the
unsuccessful Mobile terminating SMS delivery described in clause 4.13.3.9 is
performed and the following steps are skipped.
If the UE access to the AMF via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, the AMF
determines the Access Type to transfer the MT-SMS based on operator local
policy.
5a-5b. SMSF forward the SMS message to be sent as defined in TS 23.040 [7]
(i.e. the SMS message consists of CPâ€‘DATA/RPâ€‘DATA/TPDU/SMSâ€‘DELIVER parts) to
AMF by invoking Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation. The
AMF transfers the SMS message to the UE.
5c-5d. The UE acknowledges receipt of the SMS message to the SMSF. For uplink
unitdata message toward the SMSF, the AMF invokes Nsmsf_SMService_UplinkSMS
service operation to forward the message to SMSF. In order to permit the SMSF
to create an accurate charging record, the AMF also includes IMEISV, the
current UE Location Information (ULI) of the UE as defined in clause 5.6.2 of
TS 23.501 [2] and, if the SMS is delivered to the UE via 3GPP access, the
local time zone.
6a-6b. The UE returns a delivery report as defined in TS 23.040 [7]. The
delivery report is encapsulated in an NAS message and sent to the AMF which is
forwarded to SMSF by invoking Nsmsf_SMService_UplinkSMS service operation.
6c-6d. The SMSF acknowledges receipt of the delivery report to the UE. The
SMSF uses Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation to send SMS
CP ack message to the AMF. The AMF encapsulates the SMS message via a NAS
message to the UE. If SMSF has more than one SMS to send, the SMSF and the AMF
forwards subsequent SMS /SMS ack/ delivery report the same way as described in
step 4-6c.
If the SMSF knows the SMS CP ack is the last message to be transferred for UE,
the SMSF shall include a last message indication in the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation so that the AMF knows
no more SMS data is to be forwarded to UE.
NOTE: The behaviour of AMF based on the \"last message indication\" is
implementation specific.
7\. In parallel to steps 6c and 6d, the SMSF delivers the delivery report to
SC as defined in TS 23.040 [7].
#### 4.13.3.7 MT SMS over NAS in CM-CONNECTED state via 3GPP access
MT SMS in CM-CONNECTED procedure is specified by reusing the MT SMS in CM-IDLE
state with the following modification:
\- There is no need for the AMF to perform Paging of the UE and can immediate
continue with a message to SMSF via N20 to allow the SMSF to start forward the
MT SMS.
\- If the delivery of the NAS PDU containing the SMS fails e.g. if the UE is
in RRC Inactive and NG-RAN paging was not successful, the NG-RAN initiate the
UE context release in the AN procedure and provide notification of non-
delivery to the AMF. The AMF provides an indication of non-delivery to the
SMSF.
#### 4.13.3.8 MT SMS over NAS via non-3GPP access
MT SMS procedure via non-3GPP access is specified by reusing the MT SMS via
3GPP access in CM-CONNECTED state with the following modification:
\- If the UE access to the network via both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and the
AMF determines to deliver MT-SMS via non-3GPP access based on operator policy
in step 4, the NAS messages is transferred via non-3GPP Access Network.
#### 4.13.3.9 Unsuccessful Mobile terminating SMS delivery re-attempt
The procedure of Unsuccessful Mobile terminating SMS delivery re-attempt is
defined as follows:
\- If the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in the
same AMF (i.e. the UE is registered in the same PLMN for both access types):
\- if the MT-SMS delivery over one Access Type has failed, the AMF, based on
operator local policy, may re-attempt the MT-SMS delivery over the other
Access Type before indicating failure to SMSF;
\- if the MT-SMS delivery on both Access Types has failed, the AMF shall
inform the SMSF immediately.
\- If the AMF informs the SMSF that it cannot deliver the MT-SMS to the UE,
the SMSF sends a failure report to the first SMS-GMSC (which can be co-located
with IP-SM-GW or SMS Router) as defined in TS 23.040 [7]. If the SMS-GMSC has
more than one entity for SMS transport towards the UE, then upon receiving MT-
SMS failure report, the SMS-GMSC, based on operator local policy, may re-
attempt the MT-SMS delivery via the other entity.
\- After the first SMS-GMSC informs the UDM/HSS that the UE is not able to
receive MT-SMS, the UDM shall set the URRP-AMF flag and store the SC address
in the MWD list as defined in TS 23.040 [7].
\- If the UE is registered in an AMF and the UDM has not subscribed to UE
Reachability Notification in the AMF yet, the UDM immediately initiates a
subscription procedure as specified in clause 4.2.5.2.
\- When the AMF detects UE activities, it notifies UDM with UE Activity
Notification as described in clause 4.2.5.3. If the UE is registered in an
SMSF, the UDM clears its URRP-AMF flag and the UDM/HSS clears the MWD list and
alerts related SCs to retry MT-SMS delivery. Otherwise, if the UE is not
registered in an SMSF, the UDM clears its URRP-AMF flag but the UDM/HSS keeps
the MWD list to notify the SC upon subsequent SMSF registration for the UE.
\- When the SMS-GMSC requests routing information from UDM/HSS for a UE not
registered in 5GC, or for a registered UE which has not been yet registered
for SMS service, the UDM/HSS responds to the SMS-GMSC that the UE is absent,
stores the SC address in the MWD list (if not yet stored) and indicates that
to the SC as defined in TS 23.040 [7].
When the UDM receives an Nudm_UECM_Registration Request from an SMSF for a UE
for which the MWD list is stored and no URRP-AMF flag is set, the UDM/HSS
alerts the related SCs to retry the MT-SMS delivery and clears the MWD list.
NOTE: This scenario assumes that the UE is not in 2G/3G/4G coverage.
### 4.13.4 Emergency Services
#### 4.13.4.1 General
If the 5GS supports Emergency Services, the support is indicated to UE via the
Registration Accept message on per-TA-list and per-RAT basis, as described in
TS 23.501 [2].
If the 5GS supports Emergency Services Fallback, the support is indicated to
UE via the Registration Accept message on per-TA-list and per-RAT basis, as
described in TS 23.501 [2].
The UE shall follow the domain selection rules for emergency session attempts
as described in TS 23.167 [28].
If the 5GC has indicated Emergency Services Fallback support for the TA and
RAT where the UE is currently camping and if the UE supports emergency
services fallback, the UE shall initiate the Emergency Services Fallback
procedure described in clause 4.13.4.2.
At QoS Flow establishment request for Emergency Services, the procedure
described in clause 4.13.6.2 Inter RAT Fallback in 5GC for IMS voice or the
procedure described in clause 4.13.6.1 EPS fallback for IMS voice may be
triggered by the network, when configured.
#### 4.13.4.2 Emergency Services Fallback
The call flow in Figure 4.13.4.2-1 describes the procedure for emergency
services fallback.
Figure 4.13.4.2-1: Emergency Services Fallback
1\. UE camps on E-UTRA or NR cell in the 5GS (in either CM_IDLE or
CM_CONNECTED state).
2\. UE has a pending IMS emergency session request (e.g. voice) from the upper
layers.
3\. If the AMF has indicated support for emergency services using fallback via
the Registration Accept message for the current RAT, the UE sends a Service
Request message indicating that it requires emergency services fallback. The
UE is not required to include the PDU Sessions that are not relevant for the
emergency service in the List Of PDU Sessions to be Activated in the Service
Request for the emergency service.
NOTE 1: If the UE includes PDU Sessions to be Activated in the Service Request
for the emergency service, it will delay the Emergency Services Fallback
procedure.
4\. 5GC triggers a request for Emergency Services Fallback by executing an NG-
AP procedure in which it indicates to NG-RAN that this is a fallback for
emergency services. The AMF based on the support of Emergency Services in EPC
or 5GC may indicate the target CN for the RAN node to know whether inter-RAT
fallback or inter-system fallback is to be performed. When AMF initiates
Redirection for UE(s) that have been successfully authenticated, AMF includes
the security context in the request to trigger fallback towards NG-RAN.
5\. Based on the target CN if indicated in message 4 or otherwise based on the
RAN configuration, one of the following procedures is executed by NG-RAN:
5a. NG-RAN initiates handover (see clause 4.9.1.3) or redirection to a 5GC-
connected E-UTRAN cell, if UE is currently camped on NR.
5b. NG-RAN initiates handover (see clause 4.11.1.2.1) or redirection to
E-UTRAN connected to EPS. NG-RAN uses the security context provided by the AMF
to secure the redirection procedure.
If the redirection procedure is used either in 5a or 5b the target CN type
(EPC or 5GC) is also conveyed to the UE in order to be able to perform the
appropriate NAS procedures (S1 or N1 Mode). The UE uses the emergency
indication in the RRC message as specified in clause 6.2.2 of TS 36.331 [16]
and E-UTRAN provides the emergency indication to AMF (during Registration
triggered by step 5a) and MME (during Tracking Area Update triggered by step
5b). Both the Registration and the Tracking Area Update requests should
contain Follow-on request and active flag respectively to indicate that the UE
has \"user data pending\". For the handover procedure used in step 5b see
clause 4.11.1.2.1, step 1.
In step 5b, if the MME does not support emergency services for that UE, the
MME should act such that the call for emergency service is likely to succeed
promptly, e.g. if the UE successfully completed a combined TA/LA Update with
the network, by using the CSFB procedures specified in TS 23.272 [61].
NOTE 2: If such a combined TA/LA Update is not successful, or the UE did not
request a combined update, then, as specified in TS 23.167 [28], the UE
autonomously selects a RAT that may (but which might not) support the CS
domain.
6\. After handover or redirection to the target cell the UE establishes a PDU
Session / PDN connection for IMS emergency services and performs the IMS
procedures for establishment of an IMS emergency session (e.g. voice) as
defined in TS 23.167 [28].
At least for the duration of the emergency voice call, the E-UTRAN connected
to EPC is configured to not trigger any handover to 5GS and the target NG-RAN
is configured to not trigger inter NG-RAN handover back to source NG-RAN.
### 4.13.5 Location Services procedures
#### 4.13.5.0 General
Location Service procedures are defined in TS 23.273 [51].
#### 4.13.5.1 5GC-NI-LR Procedure
Location Service procedures are defined in TS 23.273 [51].
#### 4.13.5.2 5GC-MT-LR Procedure without UDM Query

### 4.13.6 Support of IMS Voice
#### 4.13.6.1 EPS fallback for IMS voice
Figure 4.13.6.1-1 describes the EPS fallback procedure for IMS voice.
When the UE is served by the 5G System, the UE has one or more ongoing PDU
Sessions each including one or more QoS Flows. The serving PLMN AMF has sent
an indication towards the UE during the Registration procedure that IMS voice
over PS session is supported, see clause 5.16.3.10 of TS 23.501 [2] and the UE
has registered in the IMS. If N26 is not supported, the serving PLMN AMF sends
an indication towards the UE during the Registration procedure that
interworking without N26 is supported, see clause 5.17.2.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
Figure 4.13.6.1-1: EPS Fallback for IMS voice
1\. UE camps on NG-RAN in the 5GS and an MO or MT IMS voice session
establishment has been initiated.
2\. Network initiated PDU Session modification to setup QoS flow for voice
reaches the NG-RAN (see N2 PDU Session Request in clause 4.3.3).
3\. NG-RAN is configured to support EPS fallback for IMS voice and decides to
trigger fallback to EPS, taking into account UE capabilities, indication from
AMF that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is possible\" (received as
part of initial context setup, handover resource allocation or path switch
request acknowledge as defined in TS 38.413 [10]), network configuration (e.g.
N26 availability configuration) and radio conditions. If NG-RAN decides not to
trigger fallback to EPS, then the procedure stops here and following steps are
not executed.
NG-RAN may initiate measurement report solicitation from the UE including
E-UTRAN as target.
NOTE 1: If AMF has indicated that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is
not possible\", then EPS fallback for IMS voice is not performed in step 5. If
NG-RAN has not received indication \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice\",
the decision to execute EPS fallback for IMS voice or not is based on network
configuration (e.g. based on N26 availability and other criteria).
4\. NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the PDU Session modification to
setup QoS flow for IMS voice received in step 2 by PDU Session Modification
Response message towards the SMF+PGW-C (or H-SMF+P-GW-C via V-SMF, in the case
of home routed roaming scenario) via AMF with an indication that mobility due
to fallback for IMS voice is ongoing. The SMF+PGW-C maintains the PCC rule(s)
associated with the QoS Flow(s) and reports the EPS Fallback event to the PCF
if PCF has subscribed to this event.
5\. NG-RAN initiates either handover (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), or AN Release
via inter-system redirection to EPS (see clause 4.2.6 and clause 4.11.1.3.2),
taking into account UE capabilities. The SMF+PGW-C reports change of the RAT
type if subscribed by PCF as specified in clause 4.11.1.2.1, or clause
4.11.1.3.2.6. When the UE is connected to EPS, either 6a or 6b is executed
6a. In the case of 5GS to EPS handover, see clause 4.11.1.2.1 and in the case
of inter-system redirection to EPS with N26 interface, see clause 4.11.1.3.2.
In either case the UE initiates TAU procedure and the UE includes active flag
in the request in the case of inter-system redirection to EPS; or
6b. In the case of inter-system redirection to EPS without N26 interface, see
clause 4.11.2.2. If the UE supports Request Type flag \"handover\" for PDN
connectivity request during the attach procedure as described in clause
5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13] and has received the indication that interworking
without N26 is supported, then the UE initiates Attach with PDN connectivity
request with request type \"handover\".
In the case of inter-system redirection for the emergency service, the UE uses
the emergency indication in the RRC message as specified in clause 6.2.2 of TS
36.331 [16] and E-UTRAN provides the emergency indication to MME during
Tracking Area Update or Attach procedure. For the handover procedure see
clause 4.11.1.2.1, step 1.
7\. After completion of the mobility procedure to EPS or as part of the 5GS to
EPS handover procedure, the SMF+PGW-C re-initiates the setup of the dedicated
bearer(s) for the maintained PCC rule(s) in step 4 including of the dedicated
bearer for IMS voice, mapping the 5G QoS to EPC QoS parameters as specified in
clause 4.11.1.2.1. The SMF+PGW-C reports about Successful Resource Allocation
and Access Network Information if subscribed by PCF.
The IMS signalling related to IMS voice call establishment continues after
step 1 as specified in the TS 23.228 [55].
At least for the duration of the voice call in EPS the E-UTRAN is configured
to not trigger any handover to 5GS.
#### 4.13.6.2 Inter RAT Fallback in 5GC for IMS voice
Figure 4.13.6.2-1 describes the RAT fallback procedure in 5GC for IMS voice.
When the UE is served by the 5GC, the UE has one or more ongoing PDU Sessions
each including one or more QoS Flows. The serving PLMN AMF has sent an
indication towards the UE during the Registration procedure that IMS voice
over PS session is supported, see clause 5.16.3.10 of TS 23.501 [2] and the UE
has registered in the IMS.
Figure 4.13.6.2-1: RAT Fallback for IMS voice
1\. UE camps on source NG-RAN in the 5GS and an MO or MT IMS voice session
establishment has been initiated.
2\. Network initiated PDU Session modification to setup QoS flow for IMS voice
reaches the source NG-RAN (see N2 PDU Session Request in clause 4.3.3).
3\. If source NG-RAN is configured to support RAT fallback for IMS voice,
source NG-RAN decides to trigger RAT fallback, taking into account on UE
capabilities, network configuration and radio conditions.
Source NG-RAN may initiate measurement report solicitation from the UE
including target NG-RAN.
4\. Source NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the PDU Session
modification to setup QoS flow for IMS voice received in step 2 by PDU Session
Response message towards the SMF (or V-SMF, in the case of roaming scenario)
via AMF with an indication that mobility due to fallback for IMS voice is
ongoing. The SMF maintains the PCC rule(s) associated with the QoS Flow(s).
5\. Source NG-RAN initiates Xn based Inter NG-RAN handover (see clause
4.9.1.2) or N2 based inter NG-RAN handover (see clause 4.9.1.3), or
redirection to E-UTRA connected to 5GC (see clause 4.2.6). The SMF reports
change of the RAT type if subscribed by PCF.
6\. After completion of the Inter NG-RAN (inter-RAT) handover or redirection
to E-UTRA connected to 5GC, the SMF re-initiates the PDU Session modification
to setup QoS flow for IMS voice. The SMF reports about Successful Resource
Allocation and Access Network Information if subscribed by PCF.
The IMS signalling related to IMS voice call establishment continues after
step 1 as specified in TS 23.228 [55].
At least for the duration of the IMS voice call the target NG-RAN is
configured to not trigger inter NG-RAN handover back to source NG-RAN.
#### 4.13.6.3 Transfer of PDU session used for IMS voice from non-3GPP access
to 5GS
Figure 4.13.6.3-1: Transfer of PDU session used for IMS voice from non-3GPP
access to 5GS
When the UE has an ongoing IMS voice session via non-3GPP access using ePDG or
N3IWF and the session is transferred to NG-RAN, depending on the selected RAT
in 5GS (NR or E-UTRA) and the support of EPS/inter-RAT fallback in NG-RAN,
either the IMS voice session continues over NG-RAN (E-UTRA) or EPS/inter-RAT
fallback is triggered.
Steps 1, 2 and 3 apply to either of the above two cases.
1\. UE has ongoing IMS voice session via non-3GPP access using ePDG or N3IWF.
UE is triggered to move to 3GPP access and camps in NG-RAN.
2\. If the UE is not registered via 3GPP access, the UE shall initiate
Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2.
3\. UE initiates PDU session establishment for the PDU session used for IMS
voice service in order to initiate handover from EPC/ePDG to 5GS as defined in
clause 4.11.4.1 step 2 or to initiate handover from N3IWF to 3GPP access in
5GC in step 2 of clauses 4.9.2.1 and 4.9.2.3. The SMF accepts the PDU session
transfer from the UE.
NOTE 1: If the UE is aware (e.g. implementation-dependent mechanisms) that
voice over NR may not be natively supported in the current Registration area,
the UE can attempt to move to E-UTRA to initiate a handover of the IMS PDU
Session to EPC or 5GC to continue the IMS voice session. The remaining steps
are not executed.
4\. NG-RAN may decide to trigger EPS or inter-RAT fallback, taking into
account UE capabilities, indication from AMF that \"Redirection for EPS
fallback for voice is possible\" (received as part of initial context setup as
defined in TS 38.413 [10]), network configuration (e.g. N26 availability
configuration) and radio conditions. NG-RAN may initiate measurement report
solicitation from the UE including E-UTRA as target.
If NG-RAN does not trigger EPS or inter-RAT fallback, then the procedure stops
here and following steps are not executed.
NOTE 2: If the AMF has indicated that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice
is not possible\", then EPS fallback for IMS voice is not performed. If NG-RAN
has not received indication \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice\", the
decision to execute EPS fallback for IMS voice or not is based on network
configuration (e.g. based on N26 availability and other criteria).
5\. NG-RAN responds indicating rejection either to set up the QoS flow for IMS
voice or the entire PDU session used for IMS voice service as received in step
3 towards the SMF+PGW-C (or H-SMF+P-GW-C via V-SMF, in the case of roaming
scenario) via AMF with an indication that mobility due to fallback for IMS
voice is ongoing. The SMF+PGW-C reports the EPS Fallback event to the PCF if
the PCF has subscribed to this event.
If NG-RAN responds indicating rejection to set up the QoS flow for IMS voice,
steps 5-7 from clause 4.13.6.1 are executed if EPS fallback is triggered, or
steps 5-6 from clause 4.13.6.2 are executed if inter-RAT Fallback for IMS
voice is triggered. The SMF+PGW-C executes the release of resources in
non-3GPP AN as specified in step 3 of clauses 4.11.4.1, 4.9.2.1 and 4.9.2.3.
NOTE 3: The timing of executing the release of resources in non-3GPP AN will
depend on whether NG-RAN decides to trigger EPS or inter-RAT fallback but will
take place at least after step 5.
If NG-RAN rejects entire PDU session used for IMS voice service, the SMF
should stop the ongoing procedure and keep the PDN connection / PDU Session at
non-3GPP side. The NG-RAN performs AN release with redirection or handover
procedure.
NOTE 4: Depending on UE implementation, the UE can re-initiate handover of an
IMS voice session over non-3GPP access to EPS if the inter-system change from
5GS to EPS is triggered by the NG-RAN and the UE does not receive a response
to the PDU session establishment request i.e. when the establishment of the
entire PDU session used for voice is rejected by NG-RAN.
### 4.13.7 MSISDN-less MO SMS
#### 4.13.7.1 General
The Nnef_MSISDN-less_MO_SMS service is used by the NEF to send the MSISDN-less
MO SMS to the AF.
#### 4.13.7.2 The procedure of MSISDN-less MO SMS Service
Figure 4.13.7.2-1: MSISDN-less MO SMS procedure via Nnef
1\. The UE uses SMS over NAS procedures in clause 4.13.3 to send an SMS to the
AF.
The service centre address points to the SMS-SC which contains the function
described in this procedure, the destination SME address is set to short/long
code of the AF and the Application Port ID element of the TP-User-Data field
is set to the appropriate value.
For MSISDN-less subscription, the dummy MSISDN is used. This MSISDN and the
IMSI of the UE are sent to SMS-SC.
2\. SMS-SC uses the destination SME address (long/short code of the AF) to
identify the corresponding NEF based on a pre-configured mapping table. SMS-SC
extracts the SMS payload, Application port ID and IMSI of the UE and delivers
them to NEF along with the destination SME address (long/short code of the
AF). The NEF acts as an MTC-IWF in this procedure.
3\. The NEF invokes Nudm_SDM_Get (Identifier Translation, IMSI, Application
Port ID, AF Identifier) to resolve the IMSI and Application Port ID to a GPSI
(External Id).
4\. The UDM provides a Nudm_SDM_Get response (GPSI). If the UE is not allowed
to send an SMS payload to this AF, or there is no valid subscription
information for this user, the flow proceeds to step 6.
5\. The NEF provides a Nnef_MSISDN-less_MO_SMSNotify (SMS payload, GPSI and
Application Port ID) message to the AF. The AF is identified with the
destination SME address (long/short code of the AF) received from step 2. The
payload is delivered directly to the AF, it is not processed by NEF.
6\. The NEF, acting as an MTC-IWF, returns a success or failure delivery
indication to SMS-SC.
7\. SMS-SC indicates success/failure back to UE using existing SMS delivery
report defined in TS 23.040 [7].
### 4.13.8 Support of 5G LAN-type service
#### 4.13.8.1 Support of 5G VN group management
The information of 5G VN group is provided by the AF to the NEF and is stored
in the UDR, by using the NEF service operations information flow procedure
described in clause 4.15.6.2.
#### 4.13.8.2 Support of 5G VN group communication
##### 4.13.8.2.1 General
This clause specifies the procedures for 5G VN group communication.
##### 4.13.8.2.2 group-level N4 session management procedures
The SMF shall create an group-level N4 session on the UPF for a 5G VN group
when N19-based forwarding is applied. The group-level N4 Session management
procedures enable the SMF to create, update or delete the group-level N4
Session, e.g. add or delete N4 rules, allocate or release the N19 tunnel
resources.
In the case of N19-based forwarding is applied, the followings apply for the
PDU Sessions targeting the (DNN, S-NSSAI) associated with a 5G VN group:
\- If the PDU Sessions targeting the same 5G VN group are anchored at
different UPFs, the SMF shall create the group-level N4 Session in each
involved UPF via N4 Session Establishment procedure (clause 4.4.1.2) in order
to establish N19 tunnel(s) between the UPFs and install the N4 rules.
\- If the last PDU Session for this 5G VN group is released on a UPF, the SMF
may delete the group-level N4 Session in the UPF via N4 Session Release
procedure (clause 4.4.1.4) and release the N19 tunnel(s) between this UPF and
other UPF(s) serving the 5G VN group via update of the corresponding N4 rules.
\- If an address of the UE within the 5G VN group is allocated or released,
the SMF may update the N4 rules(e.g. PDRs and FARs) related to the UE address
into the group-level N4 Session context via N4 Session Modification procedure
(clause 4.4.1.3).
## 4.14 Support for Dual Connectivity
### 4.14.1 RAN Initiated QoS Flow Mobility
This procedure is used to transfer QoS Flows to and from Secondary RAN Node.
During this procedure, the SMF and UPF are never re-allocated. The UPF
referred in this clause 4.14.1 is the UPF which terminates N3 interface in the
5GC. The presence of IP connectivity between the UPF and the Master RAN node,
as well as between the UPF and the Secondary RAN node is assumed.
If QoS Flows for multiple PDU Sessions need to be transferred to or from
Secondary RAN Node, the procedure shown in the Figure 4.14.1-1 below is
repeated for each PDU Session.
Figure 4.14.1-1: NG-RAN initiated QoS Flow mobility procedure
1\. The Master RAN node sends a N2 QoS Flow mobility Indication (PDU Session
ID, QFI(s), AN Tunnel Info, User Location Information) message to the AMF. AN
Tunnel Info includes the new RAN tunnel endpoint for the QFI(s) for which the
AN Tunnel Info shall be modified. The User Location Information shall include
the serving cell\'s ID and, if Dual Connectivity is activated for the UE, the
PSCell ID.
2\. AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext reques (N2 QoS Flow mobility
Indication message PDU Session ID).
3\. The SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request (PDU Session ID(s),
QFI(s), AN Tunnel Info for downlink user plane) message to the UPF.
4\. The UPF returns an N4 Session Modification Response (CN Tunnel Info for
uplink traffic) message to the SMF after requested QFIs are switched.
NOTE: Step 7 can occur any time after receipt of N4 Session Modification
Response at the SMF.
5\. SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response (N2 SM information
(CN Tunnel Info for uplink traffic)) for QFIs of the PDU Session which have
been switched successfully. If none of the requested QFIs have been switched
successfully, the SMF shall send an N2 QoS Flow mobility Failure message.
6\. In order to assist the reordering function in the Master RAN node and/or
Secondary RAN node, for each affected N3 tunnel the UPF sends one or more
\"end marker\" packets on the old tunnel immediately after switching the
tunnel for the QFI. The UPF starts sending downlink packets to the Target NG-
RAN.
7\. The AMF relays message 5 to the Master RAN node.
## 4.15 Network Exposure
### 4.15.1 General
The network capability exposure comprises
\- Exposure of network events externally as well as internally towards core
network NFs;
\- Exposure of provisioning capability towards external functions;
\- Exposure of policy and charging capabilities towards external functions;
\- Exposure of core network internal capabilities for analytics.
\- Exposure of analytics to external party.
\- Retrieval of data from external party by NWDAF.
When subscribing to event reporting the NF consumer(s) provide:
\- One or multiple Event ID(s). An Event ID identifies the type of event being
subscribed to (e.g. PDU Session Release, UE mobility out of an Area of
Interest, etc.).
\- Event Filter Information: Provides Event Parameter Types and Event
Parameter Value(s) to be matched against, in order to meet the condition for
notifying the subscribed Event ID e.g. the Event Parameter Type could be
\"Area of interest\" and Event Parameter Value list could be list of TAs; The
Event Filter depends on the Event ID. The Event Filter Information is provided
per Event ID(s) being subscribed to: within a subscription different Event
ID(s) may be associated with different Event Filter Information.
\- Event Reporting Information described in the Table 4.15.1-1 below. Within a
subscription all Event ID(s) are associated with a unique Event Reporting
Information.
\- Target of Event Reporting: this may indicate a specific UE or PDU Session,
a group of UE(s) or any UE (i.e. all UEs), Within a subscription all Event ID
(s) are associated with the same Target of Event Reporting (possibly
corresponding to multiple UE or multiple PDU Sessions).
\- A Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation ID) allowing the
Event Receiving NF to correlate notifications received from the Event provider
with this subscription. A subscription is associated with an unique
Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation ID). In the case that
the NF consumer subscribes to the NF producer on behalf of other NF, the NF
consumer includes the Notification Target Address(+Notification Correlation
ID) of other NF for the Event ID which is to be notified to other NF directly
and the Notification Target Address(+Notification Correlation ID) of itself
for the Subscription change related event notification. Each Notification
Target Address(+ Notification Correlation ID) is associated with related (set
of) Event ID(s).
\- An Expiry time represents the time upto which the subscription is desired
to be kept as active. The NF service consumer may suggest an Expiry time and
provide to the NF service producer. Based on the operator\'s policy, the NF
service producer decides whether the subscription can be expired. If the
subscription can be expired, the NF service producer determines the Expiry
time and provide it in the response to the NF service consumer. If the event
subscription is about to expire based on the received Expiry time and the NF
service consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, the NF service
consumer update the subscription with the NF service producer in order to
extend the Expiry time. Once the Expiry time associated with the subscription
is reached, the subscription becomes invalid at the NF service producer. If
the NF service consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it shall create
a new subscription with the NF service producer.
When the subscription is accepted by the Event provider NF, the consumer NF
receives from the event provider NF an identifier (Subscription Correlation
ID) allowing to further manage (modify, delete) this subscription.
NOTE 1: The Notification Correlation ID is allocated by the consumer NF that
subscribes to event reporting and the Subscription Correlation ID is allocated
by the NF that notifies when the event is met. Both correlation identifiers
can be assigned the same value, although in principle they are supposed to be
different, as they are optimized for finding the subscription related context
within each NF.
The consumer NF may use an operation dedicated to subscription modification to
add or remove Event ID(s) to this subscription or to modify Event Filter
Information.
Events are subscribed by the consumer NF(s) by providing Event Filters. The
contents of the Event Reporting Information along with the presence
requirement of each information element is described in Table 4.15.1-1.
Table 4.15.1-1: Event Reporting Information
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Event Reporting | Description | Presence requirement | | Information | | | | Parameter | | | +======================+======================+======================+ | Event reporting mode | Mode of reporting - | mandatory | | | e.g. reporting up to | | | | a maximum number of | | | | reports, periodic | | | | reporting along with | | | | periodicity, | | | | reporting up to a | | | | maximum duration | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Maximum number of | Maximum number of | (see NOTE 2) | | reports | reports after which | | | | the event | | | | subscription ceases | | | | to exist | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Maximum duration of | Maximum duration | (see NOTE 2) | | reporting | after which the | | | | event subscription | | | | ceases to exist | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Immediate reporting | The Event provider | | | flag | NF notifies the | | | | current status of | | | | the subscribed | | | | event, if available, | | | | immediately to the | | | | consumer NF. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Sampling ratio | Percentage of | optional | | | sampling (1%..100%) | | | | among impacted UEs. | (see NOTE 3) | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Group Reporting | Parameter for | optional | | Guard Time | group-based | | | | monitoring | | | | configuration to | | | | indicate the time | | | | for which the | | | | Monitoring Event | | | | Reporting(s) related | | | | with the UEs in a | | | | group can be | | | | aggregated before | | | | sending them to the | | | | consumer NF. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | NOTE 2: The | | | | requester shall | | | | include 2) Maximum | | | | number of reports or | | | | 3) Maximum duration | | | | of reporting, or | | | | both, depending on | | | | 1) Event reporting | | | | mode. | | | | | | | | NOTE 3: Parameter | | | | only applicable to | | | | certain event IDs | | | | reporting metrics | | | | (e.g. Number of UEs | | | | present in a | | | | geographical area) | | | | used and used e.g. | | | | by the NWDAF for | | | | data collection. | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
NOTE 4: Explicit unsubscribe by the NF consumer is still possible.
Maximum number of reports is applicable to the subscription to one UE or a
group of UE(s). When the subscription is applied to a group of UE(s), the
initial value of the parameter is applied to each individual member UE. The
count of number of reports is per UE and per Event Type granularity also for
group member UE.
Maximum duration of reporting is applicable to the subscription to one UE, a
group of UE(s) or any UE. When the subscription is applied to a group of
UE(s), this parameter applies to each group member UE. When the subscription
is applied to any UE, this parameter applies to all the impacted UEs.
If for a given subscription Maximum duration of reporting is included then the
subscription is cancelled locally in the NF as soon as Maximum duration of
reporting is reached. If the Maximum number of reports is reached for a given
subscription, the NEF cancels the subscription in the affected NFs. If both
Maximum Number of reports and Maximum duration of reporting are included then
the subscription expires or is cancelled as soon as one of the conditions is
met.
Sampling ratio is applicable to subscription targeting a group of UEs or any
UE. When a sampling ratio is provided, a random subset is selected among the
target UEs according to the sampling ratio and only the events related to this
subset are reported. A UE remains selected until it is no longer managed by
the event provider NF. A UE newly managed by the NF may become selected.
Group Reporting Guard Time is an optional parameter for group-based monitoring
configuration to indicate the time for which the Monitoring Event Reporting(s)
related with the UEs in a group can be aggregated before sending them to the
consumer NF. The value of the Group Reporting Guard time should be set less
than the Maximum duration of reporting. For the continuous monitoring
reporting, unless the Maximum duration of reporting has been reached, the
Group Reporting Guard timer is restarted when it expires. If the time left
until the Maximum duration of reporting is less than the Group Reporting Guard
Time, then the Group Reporting Guard timer shall be set to expire when the
Maximum duration of reporting expires. If the Maximum duration of reporting is
expired, the Group Reporting Guard Time, if running, shall be considered to
expire and aggregated Monitoring Event Reporting(s) is sent to destination
immediately.
Table 4.15.1-1 indicates the presence requirements for the Event Reporting
Information.
Corresponding notifications contain at least the Notification Correlation ID
together with the Event ID and the individual target (e.g. UE or PDU Session
ID) associated with the notification.
If the NF service consumer decides to terminate the event subscription, it
unsubscribes the event subscription by sending unsubscription request to the
event provider NF. After receiving unsubscription request from the NF service
consumer, the event provider NF terminates the event subscription.
The following clauses describe the external exposure of network capabilities
and core network internal event and capability exposure.
When the immediate reporting flag is set, the first corresponding event report
is included in the subscription response message, if corresponding information
is available at the reception of the subscription request of the event.
During Monitoring Event Subscription as in clause 4.15.3, Parameter
Provisioning as in clause 4.15.6, NIDD configuration as in clause 4.25.3 and
Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control as in clause 4.27.1, the optional
parameter MTC Provider Information is a reference parameter that may be
provided by AF or determined by NEF based on which AF it communicates with.
The MTC Provider Information identifies the MTC Service Provider and/or MTC
Application.
NOTE 5: The MTC Provider Information can be used by Service Providers for,
e.g. to distinguish their different customers.
NOTE 6: The MTC Provider Information is an optional parameter. The NEF can
validate the provided MTC Provider Information and override it to a NEF
selected MTC Provider Information based on configuration. How the NEF
determines the MTC Provider Information, if not present, is left to
implementation (e.g. based on the requesting AF).
### 4.15.2 External Exposure of Network Capabilities
The Network Exposure Function (NEF) supports external exposure of capabilities
of network functions. External exposure can be categorized as Monitoring
capability, Provisioning capability, Policy/Charging capability, network
status reporting capability and Analytics reporting capability. The Monitoring
capability is for monitoring of specific event for UE in 5GS and making such
monitoring events information available for external exposure via the NEF. The
Provisioning capability is for allowing external party to provision of
information which can be used for the UE in 5GS. The Policy/Charging
capability is for handling QoS and charging policy for the UE based on the
request from external party. The Analytics capability is for allowing external
party to acquire analytics information generated by 5G System.
The details for the External Exposure of Analytics capabilities as well as
interactions between NEF, external party and NWDAF are described in TS 23.288
[50].
### 4.15.2a Data Collection from an AF
The Network Exposure Function (NEF) supports the capability to collect data
from an AF as specified in TS 23.501 [2].
### 4.15.3 Event Exposure using NEF
#### 4.15.3.1 Monitoring Events
The Monitoring Events feature is intended for monitoring of specific events in
3GPP system and making such monitoring events information reported via the
NEF. It is comprised of means that allow NFs in 5GS for configuring the
specific events, the event detection and the event reporting to the requested
party.
To support monitoring features in roaming scenarios, a roaming agreement needs
to be made between the HPLMN and the VPLMN. If the AMF/SMF in the VPLMN
determine that normalisation of an event report is required, the AMF/SMF
normalises the event report before sending it to the NEF.
The set of capabilities required for monitoring shall be accessible via NEF to
NFs in 5GS. Monitoring Events via the UDM, the AMF, the SMF and the GMLC
enables NEF to configure a given Monitor Event at UDM, AMF, SMF or GMLC and
reporting of the event via UDM and/or AMF, SMF or GMLC. Depending on the
specific monitoring event or information, it is the AMF, GMLC or the UDM that
is aware of the monitoring event or information and makes it reported via the
NEF.
The following table enumerates the monitoring events and their detection
criteria:
Table 4.15.3.1-1: List of events for monitoring capability
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Event | Detection criteria | Which NF detects the | | | | event | +======================+======================+======================+ | Loss of Connectivity | Network detects that | AMF | | | the UE is no longer | | | | reachable for either | | | | signalling or user | | | | plane communication | | | | (see NOTE 4). | | | | | | | | The AF may provide a | | | | Maximum Detection | | | | Time, which | | | | indicates the | | | | maximum period of | | | | time without any | | | | communication with | | | | the UE after which | | | | the AF is to be | | | | informed that the UE | | | | is considered to be | | | | unreachable (see | | | | NOTE 7). | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | UE reachability | Detected when the UE | AMF, UDM | | | transitions to | | | | CM-CONNECTED state | | | | or when the UE will | | | | become reachable for | | | | paging, e.g. | | | | Periodic | | | | Registration Update | | | | timer. It indicates | | | | when the UE becomes | | | | reachable for | | | | sending downlink | | | | data to the UE. | | | | | | | | The AF may provide | | | | the following | | | | parameters: | | | | | | | | 1) Maximum Latency; | | | | | | | | 2) Maximum Response | | | | Time; | | | | | | | | 3) Suggested number | | | | of downlink packets. | | | | (see NOTE 5 and | | | | NOTE 7). | | | | | | | | This event requires | | | | the Reachability | | | | Filter set to UE | | | | reachable for DL | | | | traffic\" (see | | | | clause 5.2.2.3.1-1). | | | | For the usage of | | | | this event, see | | | | clauses 4.2.5.2 and | | | | 4.2.5.3. | | | | | | | | When requesting UE | | | | reachability | | | | monitoring, the AF | | | | may in addition | | | | request Idle Status | | | | Indication to be | | | | included in the UE | | | | reachability event | | | | reporting. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Location Reporting | This event is | AMF, GMLC | | | detected based on | | | | the Event Reporting | | | | Information | | | | Parameters that were | | | | received in the | | | | Monitoring Request | | | | (one-time reporting, | | | | maximum number of | | | | reports, maximum | | | | duration of | | | | reporting, | | | | periodicity, etc. as | | | | specified in | | | | clause 4.15.1). | | | | | | | | It reports either | | | | the Current Location | | | | or the Last Known | | | | Location of a UE. | | | | | | | | When AMF is the | | | | detecting NF: | | | | | | | | One-time and | | | | Continuous Location | | | | Reporting are | | | | supported. For | | | | Continuous Location | | | | Reporting the | | | | serving node(s) | | | | sends a notification | | | | every time it | | | | becomes aware of a | | | | location change, | | | | with the granularity | | | | depending on the | | | | accepted accuracy of | | | | location (see NOTE | | | | 1). | | | | | | | | For One-time | | | | Reporting with | | | | immediate reporting | | | | flag set, AMF | | | | reports the Last | | | | Known Location | | | | immediately. | | | | | | | | When AMF is the | | | | detecting NF: | | | | | | | | If the immediate | | | | reporting flag is | | | | not set, the AMF | | | | reports the UE | | | | Current Location (In | | | | case the AMF does | | | | not have the UE | | | | current location in | | | | the granularity as | | | | requested by the | | | | location report, the | | | | AMF retrieves the | | | | information via | | | | NG-RAN Location | | | | reporting procedure | | | | as defined in | | | | clause 4.10). | | | | | | | | When GMLC is the | | | | detecting NF: | | | | | | | | Immediate and | | | | Deferred Location | | | | Reporting is | | | | supported.

#### 4.15.3.2 Information flows
##### 4.15.3.2.1 AMF service operations information flow
The procedure is used by the NF to subscribe to notifications and to
explicitly cancel a previous subscription. Cancelling is done by sending
Namf_EventExposure_UnSubscribe request identifying Subscription Correlation
ID. The notification steps 3 and 4 are not applicable in cancellation case.
Figure 4.15.3.2.1-1: Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe, Unsubscribe and Notify
operations
1\. A NEF sends a request to subscribe to a (set of) Event ID(s) in AMF in
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe request. The NEF could be the same NF subscribing
to receive the event notification reports (i.e. Event Receiving NF) or it
could be a different NF. The NEF subscribes to one or several Event(s)
(identified by Event ID) and provides the associated notification endpoint of
the Event Receiving NF. If the NEF itself is not the Event Receiving NF, the
NEF shall additionally provide the notification endpoint of itself besides the
notification endpoint of Event Receiving NF. Each notification endpoint is
associated with the related (set of) Event ID(s). This is to assure the NEF
can receive the notification of subscription change related event (e.g.
Subscripiont Correlation ID Change).
Event Reporting information defines the type of reporting requested. If the
reporting event subscription is authorized by the AMF, the AMF records the
association of the event trigger and the requester identity.
2\. AMF acknowledges the execution of Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe.
3\. [Conditional - depending on the Event] The AMF detects the monitored event
occurs and sends the event report by means of Namf_EventExposure_Notify
message, to the notification endpoint of the Event Receiving NF.
4\. [Conditional- depending on the Event] The AMF detects the subscription
change related event occurs, e.g. Subscription Correlation ID change due to
AMF reallocation, it sends the event report by means of
Namf_EventExposure_Notify message to the NEF.
##### 4.15.3.2.2 UDM service operations information flow
The procedure is used by the NEF to subscribe to notifications and to
explicitly cancel a previous subscription. Cancelling is done by sending
Nudm_EventExposure_Unsubscribe request identifying the subscription to cancel.
The notification steps 4 and 5 are not applicable in cancellation case.
Figure 4.15.3.2.2-1: Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe, Unsubscribe and Notify
operations
1\. The NEF subscribes to one or several monitoring events by sending
Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe request. The NEF subscribes to one or several
Event(s) (identified by Event ID) and provides the associated notification
endpoint of the NEF.
Event Reporting Information defines the type of reporting requested. If the
reporting event subscription is authorized by the UDM, the UDM records the
association of the event trigger and the requester identity.
The subscription may include Maximum number of reports and/or Maximum duration
of reporting IE and optionally MTC Provider Information.
2a. [Conditional] Some events (e.g. loss of connectivity), require that UDM
sends Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe request to the AMF serving that UE. As the
UDM itself is not the Event Receiving NF, the UDM shall additionally provide
the notification endpoint of itself besides the notification endpoint of NEF.
Each notification endpoint is associated with the related (set of) Event
ID(s). This is to assure the UDM can receive the notification of subscription
change related event.
The UDM sends the Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe request to all serving AMF(s)
(if subscription applies to a UE or a group of UE(s)), or to all the AMF(s) in
the same PLMN as UDM (if subscription applies to any UE). The UDM stores the
subscription even if the target UE or group member UE is not registered at the
time of subscription.
NOTE 1: If the single target UE or group member UE , registers later on with
an AMF which does not have event subscription or group event subscription(s)
for that UE or UE group, then the UDM creates subscriptions to those event(s)
with the AMF during the Registration procedure as specified in clause
4.2.2.2.2.
If the subscription applies to a group of UE(s), the UDM shall include the
same notification endpoint of itself, i.e. Notification Target Address (+
Notification Correlation Id), in the subscriptions to all UE\'s serving
AMF(s).
NOTE 2: The same notification endpoint of UDM is to help the AMF identify
whether the subscription for the requested group event is same or not when a
new group member UE is registered.
2b. [Conditional] AMF acknowledges the execution of
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe.
3\. UDM acknowledges the execution of Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe.
If the subscription is applicable to a group of UE(s) and the Maximum number
of reports is included in the Event Report information in step 1, the Number
of UEs (including all group member UEs irrespective of their registration
state) within this group is included in the acknowledgement. If AMF provides
the first event report in step 2b, the UDM includes the event report in the
acknowledgement.
4a - 4b. [Conditional - depending on the Event] The UDM detects the monitored
event occurs and sends the event report, by means of Nudm_EventExposure_Notify
message, to the associated notification endpoint of the NEF, along with the
time stamp. NEF may store the information in the UDR along with the time stamp
using either Nudr_DM_Create or Nudr_DM_Update service operation as
appropriate.
4c - 4d. [Conditional - depending on the Event] The AMF detects the monitored
event occurs and sends the event report, by means of Namf_EventExposure_Notify
message, to the associated notification endpoint of the NEF, along with the
time stamp. NEF may store the information in the UDR along with the time stamp
using either Nudr_DM_Create or Nudr_DM_Update service operation as
appropriate.
If the AMF has a maximum number of reports stored for the UE, the AMF shall
decrease its value by one for the reported event.
For both step 4a and step 4c, when the maximum number of reports is reached
and if the subscription is applied to a UE, The NEF unsubscribes the
monitoring event(s) to the UDM and the UDM unsubscribes the monitoring
event(s) to AMF serving that UE.
For both step 4a and step 4c, when the maximum number of reports is reached
for an individual group member UE, the NEF uses the Number of UEs received in
step 3 and the Maximum number of reports to determine if reporting for the
group is complete. If the NEF determines that reporting for the group is
complete, the NEF unsubscribes the monitoring event(s) to the UDM and the UDM
unsubscribes the monitoring event(s) to all AMF(s) serving the UEs belonging
to that group.
NOTE 3: If an expiry time as specified in clause 6.2.6.2.6 of TS 29.518 [18]
is not included in the event subscription, then the life time of the event
subscription needs to be controlled by other means as there is no time based
cancellation at all even if any group member UEs fail to register.
When the Maximum duration of reporting expires in the NEF, the UDM and the
AMF, then each of these nodes shall locally unsubscribe the monitoring event.
5\. [Conditional - depending on the Event] The AMF detects the subscription
change related event occurs, e.g. Subscription Correlation ID change due to
AMF reallocation or addition of new Subscription Correlation ID due to a new
group UE registered, it sends the event report by means of
Namf_EventExposure_Notify message to the associated notification endpoint of
the UDM.
##### 4.15.3.2.3 NEF service operations information flow
The procedure is used by the AF to subscribe to notifications and to
explicitly cancel a previous subscription. Cancelling is done by sending
Nnef_EventExposure_Unsubscribe request identifying the subscription to cancel
with Subscription Correlation ID. The notification steps 6 to 8 are not
applicable in cancellation case.
Figure 4.15.3.2.3-1: Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe, Unsubscribe and Notify
operations
1\. The AF subscribes to one or several Event(s) (identified by Event ID) and
provides the associated notification endpoint of the AF by sending
Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe request.
Event Reporting Information defines the type of reporting requested (e.g. one-
time reporting, periodic reporting or event based reporting, for Monitoring
Events). If the reporting event subscription is authorized by the NEF, the NEF
records the association of the event trigger and the requester identity. The
subscription may also include Maximum number of reports and/or Maximum
duration of reporting IE and optionally MTC Provider Information.
2\. [Conditional - depending on authorization in step 1] The NEF subscribes to
received Event(s) (identified by Event ID) and provides the associated
notification endpoint of the NEF to UDM by sending
Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe request. The NEF maps the AF-Identifier into DNN
and S-NSSAI combination based on local configuration and include DNN, S-NSSAI
in the request.
If the reporting event subscription is authorized by the UDM, the UDM records
the association of the event trigger and the requester identity. Otherwise,
the UDM continues in step 4 indicating failure.
3a. [Conditional] If the requested event (e.g. monitoring of Loss of
Connectivity) requires AMF assistance, then the UDM sends the
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe to the AMF serving the requested user. The UDM
sends the Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe request to the all serving AMF(s) (if
subscription applies to a UE or a group of UE(s)), or all the AMF in the same
PLMN as the UDM (if subscription applies to any UE).
NOTE 1: If the UE, which is a member of a group, registers with an AMF which
does not have group event subscription(s) for that group, then the UDM creates
subscriptions to those event(s) with the AMF during the Registration procedure
in clause 4.2.2.2.2.
As the UDM itself is not the Event Receiving NF, the UDM shall additionally
provide the notification endpoint of itself besides the notification endpoint
of NEF. Each notification endpoint is associated with the related (set of)
Event ID(s). This is to assure the UDM can receive the notification of
subscription change related event.
If the subscription applies to a group of UE(s), the UDM shall include the
same notification endpoint of itself, i.e. Notification Target Address (+
Notification Correlation Id), in the subscriptions to all UE\'s serving
AMF(s).
NOTE 2: The same notification endpoint of UDM is to help the AMF identify
whether the subscription for the requested group event is same or not when a
new group member UE is registered.
3b. [Conditional] AMF acknowledges the execution of
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe.
3c. [Conditional] If the requested event (e.g. PDU Session Status) requires
SMF assistance, then the UDM sends the Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe Request
message to each SMF where at least one UE identified in step 2 has a PDU
session established. The NEF notification endpoint received in step 2 is
included in the message.
NOTE 3: In the home routed case, the UDM sends the subscription to the V-SMF
via the H-SMF.
3d. [Conditional] The SMF acknowledges the execution of
Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe.
4\. [Conditional] UDM acknowledges the execution of
Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe.
If the subscription is applicable to a group of UE(s) and the Maximum number
of reports is included in the Event Report information in step 1, the Number
of UEs (including all group member UEs irrespective of their registration
state) is included in the acknowledgement. If AMF or SMF provides the first
event report in step 3b or 3d, the UDM includes the event reporting in the
acknowledgement.
5\. NEF acknowledges the execution of Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe to the
requester that initiated the request. If the NEF has received the first event
report already in step 4, the NEF includes the event report in the
acknowledgement.
6a - 6b. [Conditional - depending on the Event] The UDM (depending on the
Event) detects the event occurs and sends the event report, by means of
Nudm_EventExposure_Notify message to the associated notification endpoint of
the NEF along with the time stamp. NEF may store the information in the UDR
along with the time stamp using either Nudr_DM_Create or Nudr_DM_Update
service operation as appropriate.
6c - 6d. [Conditional - depending on the Event] The AMF detects the event
occurs and sends the event report, by means of Namf_EventExposure_Notify
message to associated notification endpoint of the NEF along with the time
stamp. NEF may store the information in the UDR along with the time stamp
using either Nudr_DM_Create or Nudr_DM_Update service operation as
appropriate.
If the AMF has a maximum number of reports stored for the UE or the individual
member UE, the AMF shall decrease its value by one for the reported event.
For both step 6a and step 6b, when the maximum number of reports is reached
and if the subscription is applied to a UE, The NEF unsubscribes the
monitoring event(s) to the UDM and the UDM unsubscribes the monitoring
event(s) to AMF serving for that UE.
For both step 6a and step 6b, when the maximum number of reports is reached
for an individual group member UE, the NEF uses the Number of UEs received in
step 4 and the Maximum number of reports to determine if reporting for the
group is complete. If the NEF determines that reporting for the group is
complete, the NEF unsubscribes the monitoring event(s) to the UDM and the UDM
unsubscribes the monitoring event(s) to all AMF(s) serving the UEs belonging
to that group.
NOTE 4: If an expiry time as specified in clause 6.2.6.2.6 of TS 29.518 [18]
is not included in the event subscription, then the life time of the event
subscription needs to be controlled by other means as there is no time based
cancellation at all even if any group member UEs fail to register.
When the Maximum duration of reporting expires in the NEF, the UDM and the
AMF, then each of these nodes shall locally unsubscribe the monitoring event.
6e - 6f. [Conditional - depending on the Event] When the SMF detects a
subscribed event, the SMF sends the event report, by means of
Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify message, to the associated notification endpoint of
the NEF provided in step 3c. NEF may store the information in the UDR along
with the time stamp using either Nudr_DM_Create or Nudr_DM_Update service
operation as appropriate.
7\. [Conditional - depending on the Event in steps 6a-6f] The NEF forwards to
the AF the reporting event received by either Nudm_EventExposure_Notify and/or
Namf_EventExposure_Notify. In the case of the PDU Session Status event, the
NEF maps it to an PDN Connectivity Status notification when reporting to the
AF.
8\. [Conditional - depending on the Event] The AMF detects the subscription
change related event occurs, e.g. Subscription Correlation ID change due to
AMF reallocation or addition of new Subscription Correlation ID due to a new
group UE registered, it sends the event report, by means of
Namf_EventExposure_Notify message to the associated notification endpoint of
the UDM.
##### 4.15.3.2.3a Void
##### 4.15.3.2.3b Specific NEF service operations information flow for loss of
connectivity and UE reachability
The procedure is used by the AF to subscribe to notifications and to
explicitly cancel a previous subscription for loss of connectivity and UE
reachability.
Figure 4.15.3.2.3b-1: Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe, Unsubscribe and Notify
operations or loss of connectivity and UE reachability
1\. Step 1 to step 3b of Figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 are performed with the following
differences:
\- For Loss of Connectivity, the subscription request may include Maximum
Detection Time (see Table 4.15.3.1-1).
\- For UE reachability, the subscription request may include Maximum Latency,
Maximum Response Time and/or Suggested number of downlink packets (see Table
4.15.3.1-1). In step 3a of Figure 4.15.3.2.3-1, the UDM may include Maximum
Response Time in the subscription request to the AMF.
NOTE 1: It is expected that Maximum Latency, Maximum Response Time and/or
Suggested number of downlink packets included in the subscription request is
only used by the AF that does not support Parameter Provisioning procedure
specified in clause 4.15.6.3a.
\- For UE reachability, the AF may include Idle Status Indication request. If
Idle Status Indication request is included, the NEF includes it in
Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe message. If the UDM receives Idle Status
Indication request, it includes it in Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe message. If
the NEF does not support the requested Idle Status Indication, then depending
on operator policies, the NEF rejects the request.
2\. [Conditional] If the subscribed periodic registration timer has not been
set according to any subscription request, or a Network Configuration as
defined in clause 4.15.6.3a the UDM shall set the subscribed periodic
registration timer using the Maximum Detection Time or Maximum Latency;
otherwise if the subscribed periodic registration timer was previously set by
a different subscription identified by a different Notification Target Address
(+ Notification Correlation ID), or set by a different Network Configuration
identified by a different NEF reference ID for the same UE and if the newly
received Maximum Detection Time or Maximum Latency is lower than the provided
subscribed periodic registration timer, the UDM shall set the subscribed
periodic registration timer using the newly received Maximum Detection Time or
Maximum Latency.
If Nudm_EventExposure_Unsubscribe request is performed in step 1, the UDM
shall recalculate the subscribed periodic registration timer based on the
remaining event subscriptions and/or Network Configurations.
In addition for UE reachability subscription, if the newly received Maximum
Response Time is longer than the provided subscribed Active Time (i.e.
previously provided Maximum Response Time), the UDM shall set the subscribed
Active Time using the newly received Maximum Response Time. If the suggested
number of downlink packets is newly received, the UDM shall add the newly
received suggested number of downlink packets to the currently used value of
suggested number of downlink packets if the aggregated value is within the
operator defined range.
If Nudm_EventExposure_Unsubscribe request is performed in step 1, the UDM
shall recalculate the subscribed Active Time and/or Suggested Number of
Downlink Packets based on the remaining event subscriptions and/or Network
Configurations.
If the subscribed periodic registration timer or the subscribed Active Time
are set or modified, the UDM sends the Nudm_SDM_Notification request to
related serving AMF(s). If the AMF receives a subscribed periodic registration
timer value from the UDM, it allocates the received value to the UE as the
periodic registration timer at subsequent Registration procedure. The AMF
starts monitoring of the expiration of the mobile reachable timer for Loss of
Connectivity (if required) and starts monitoring of the UE entering connected
mode for UE reachability (if required).
If the suggested number of downlink packets are set or modified, the UDM sends
the Nudm_SDM_Notification request to related serving SMF(s). The SMF
configures the data buffer at the SMF/UPF according the suggested number of
downlink packets.
If the provided value is updated by the UDM, the UDM may notify the NEF (which
then notifies the AF) of the actual value that is being applied in the 3GPP
network.
3\. Step 4 to step 5 of Figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 are performed.
4\. Step 6c to step 6d of Figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 are performed with the following
differences:
\- For Loss of Connectivity, the event is detected when the mobile
reachability timer expires.
\- For UE reachability, the event is detected when the UE changes to connected
mode or when the UE will become reachable for paging.
\- For UE reachability, if Idle Status Indication request was included in step
1 and the AMF supports Idle Status Indication, the AMF includes also the Idle
Status Indication.
5\. Step 8 of Figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 is performed.
##### 4.15.3.2.4 Exposure with bulk subscription
Based on operator configuration NEF may perform bulk subscription with the NFs
that provides necessary services. This feature is controlled by local policies
of the NEF that control which events (set of Event ID(s)) and UE(s) are target
of a bulk subscription.
When the NEF performs bulk subscription (subscribes for any UE (i.e. all UEs),
group of UE(s) (e.g. identifying a certain type of UEs such as IoT UEs)), it
subscribes to all the NFs that provide the necessary services (e.g. In a given
PLMN, NEF may subscribe to all AMFs that support reachability notification for
IoT UEs). Upon receiving bulk subscription from the NEF, the NFs store this
information. Whenever the corresponding event(s) occur for the requested UE(s)
as in bulk subscription request, NFs notify the NEF with the requested
information.
The following call flow shows how network exposure can happen for one UE,
groups of UE(s) (e.g. identifying a certain type of UEs such as IoT UEs) or
any UE.
Figure 4.15.3.2.4-1: NF registration/status notification and Exposure with
bulk subscription
1\. NEF registers with the NRF for any newly registered NF along with its NF
services.
2\. When an NF instantiates, it registers itself along with the supported NF
services with the NRF.
3\. NRF acknowledges the registration
4\. NRF notifies the NEF with the newly registered NF along with the supported
NF services.
5\. NEF evaluates the NF and NF services supported against the pre-configured
events within NEF. Based on that, NEF subscribes with the corresponding NF
either for a single UE, group of UE(s) (e.g. identifying a certain type of UEs
such as IoT UEs), any UE. NF acknowledges the subscription with the NEF.
6 - 7. When the event trigger happens, NF notifies the requested information
towards the subscribing NEF along with the time stamp. NEF may store the
information in the UDR along with the time stamp using either Nudr_DM_Create
or Nudr_DM_Update service operation as appropriate.
8\. Application registers with the NEF for a certain event identified by event
filters. If the registration for the event is authorized by the NEF, the NEF
records the association of the event and the requester identity.
9 - 10. When the event trigger happens, NF notifies the requested information
towards the subscribing NEF. NEF may store the information in the UDR using
either Nudr_DM_Create or Nudr_DM_Update service operation as appropriate.
11a-b. NEF reads from UDR with Nudr_DM_Query and notifies the application
along with the time stamp for the corresponding subscribed events.
##### 4.15.3.2.5 Information flow for downlink data delivery status with SMF
buffering
The procedure is used if the SMF requests the UPF to forward downlink data
packets that are subject of extended buffering in the SMF. The procedure
describes a mechanism for the Application Function to subscribe downlink data
delivery status notifications. The downlink data delivery status notifications
relates to high latency communication, see also clauses 4.24.2 and 4.2.3.3.
Cancelling the subscription is done by sending Nnef_EventExposure_Unsubscribe
request identifying the subscription to cancel with Subscription Correlation
ID in the same order as indicated in figure 4.15.3.2.5-1 for the corresponding
subscribe requests. Step 0 and the notification steps 7 to 9 are not
applicable in cancellation case.
Figure 4.15.3.2.5-1: Information flow for downlink data delivery status with
SMF buffering
0\. The SMF (in the non-roaming case the SMF, in the roaming case the V-SMF,
in the case of PDU session with I-SMF the I-SMF) configures the relevant UPF
to forward downlink data packets towards the SMF as described in clause 5.8.3
in 23.501 [2]. The SMF decides to apply this behaviour based on the \"expected
UE behaviour\". Alternatively, step 0 is triggered by step 3,
1\. The AF sends Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe Request to NEF requesting
notification for event \"Downlink data delivery status\" with traffic
descriptor (e.g. the source of the downlink IP or Ethernet traffic) for a UE
or group of UEs. If the reporting event subscription is authorized by the NEF,
the NEF records the association of the event trigger and the requester
identity. The Downlink data delivery status events include:
\- First downlink Packet in extended buffering event:
\- This event is triggered when the first new downlink data packet is buffered
with extended buffering matching the traffic descriptor.
\- in notifications about this Downlink data delivery status, the SMF provides
the Extended Buffering time as determined in clause 4.2.3.3.
\- First downlink Packet discarded:
\- This event occurs when the first packet matching the traffic descriptor is
discarded because the Extended Buffering time, as determined by the SMF,
expires or the amount of downlink data to be buffered is exceeded.
\- First Downlink Packet transmitted:
\- This event occurs when the first packet matching the traffic descriptor is
transmitted after previous buffering or discarding of corresponding packet(s)
because the UE of the PDU Session becomes ACTIVE and buffered data can be
delivered to UE according to clause 4.2.3.3.
2\. The NEF sends the Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe Request to UDM. Identifier
of the UE or group of UEs, the traffic descriptor, monitoring event received
from AF in step 1 and notification endpoint of the NEF are included in the
message. If the reporting event subscription is authorized by the UDM, the UDM
records the association of the event trigger and the requester identity.
Otherwise, the UDM continues in step 5 indicating failure.
3\. The UDM sends the Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe Request message to each SMF
where at least one UE identified in step 2 has a PDU session established. If
the UDM is able to derive the applicable DNN and S-NSSAI from the traffic
descriptor via configured information, the UDM may send
Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe Request messages only to SMFs with PDU sessions
with that DNN and S-NSSAI for such UEs and includes the Identifier of the UE
or Internal-Group-Id, traffic descriptor, monitoring event and the
notification endpoint of NEF received in step 2 are included in the message.
If the UDM becomes aware that such a UE has a PDU session established with the
DNN and S-NSSAI corresponding to the traffic descriptor at a later time than
when receiving step 2, the UDM then executes step 3.
In the case of home-routed PDU session or PDU session with I-SMF, the UDM
sends the Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe Request message to each H-SMF or SMF
and the H-SMF or SMF further sends Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe Request
message to each related V-SMF or I-SMF. Steps 7-8 are performed by V-SMF or
I-SMF.
4\. The SMF sends the Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe Response message to the
UDM.
5\. The UDM send sends the Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe response message to
the NEF.
6\. The NEF sends the Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe response to the AF.
7\. The SMF detects a change in Downlink Data Delivery Status event as
described in clause 4.2.3. The SMF becomes aware that Downlink Packet(s)
require extended buffering via a Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
service operation with the AMF. If the SMF decides to discard packets, the
\"Downlink Packet(s) discarded event\" is detected. The SMF detects that
previously buffered packets can be transmitted by the fact that the related
PDU session becomes ACTIVE.
8\. The SMF sends the Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify with Downlink Delivery Status
event message to NEF.
9\. The NEF sends Nnef_EventExposure_Notify with Downlink Delivery Status
event message to AF.
##### 4.15.3.2.6 GMLC service operations information flow
The procedure is used by the NF to subscribe to notifications and to
explicitly cancel a previous subscription. The GMLC service operations
information flow is defined in clause 6.1.2 and clause 6.3 of TS 23.273 [51].
##### 4.15.3.2.7 Information flow for Availability after DDN Failure with SMF
buffering
The procedure is used if the SMF requests the UPF to forward packets that are
subject of buffering in the SMF. The procedure describes a mechanism for the
Application Function to subscribe to notifications about availability after
downlink data notification failure. The Availability after Downlink Data
Notification failure event is related to high latency communication, see also
clauses 4.24.2 and 4.2.3.3.
Cancelling the subscription is done by sending EventExposure_Unsubscribe
requests identifying the subscription to cancel with the Subscription
Correlation ID in the same order as indicated in figure 4.15.3.2.7-1 for the
corresponding subscribe requests (the AMF unsubscribes the DDN Failure status
notification by sending the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request message to
each SMF in step 5). Step 0 and the notification steps 9 to 13 are not
applicable in the cancellation case.
Figure 4.15.3.2.7-1: Information flow for availability after DDN Failure with
SMF buffering
0\. The SMF (in the no-roaming case the H-SMF. in the roaming case the V-SMF,
in the case of PDU session with I-SMF the I-SMF) configures the relevant UPF
to forward packets to the SMF as described in clause 5.8.3 in 23.501 [2]. The
SMF decides to apply this behaviour based on the \"expected UE behaviour\".
Alternatively, step 0 is triggered by step 5.
1\. The AF sends Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe Request to the NEF requesting
notifications for \"Availability after DDN Failure\" for a UE or group of UEs
and providing a traffic descriptor identifying the source of the downlink IP
or Ethernet traffic. If the reporting event subscription is authorized by the
NEF, the NEF records the association of the event trigger and the requester
identity.
The AF may include Idle Status Indication request in the
Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe Request. If Idle Status Indication request is
included, the NEF includes it in Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe message. If the
NEF does not support the requested Idle Status Indication, then depending on
operator policies, the NEF rejects the request.
2\. The NEF sends the Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe Request to UDM. Identifier
of the UE or group of UEs, the traffic descriptor, monitoring event received
from AF at step 1 and notification endpoint of the NEF are included in the
message. If the reporting event subscription is authorized by the UDM, the UDM
records the association of the event trigger and the requester identity.
Otherwise, the UDM continues in step 7 indicating failure.
If the UDM receives Idle Status Indication request, it includes it in
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe message.
3\. The UDM sends Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe messages to the AMF(s) which
serve the UE(s) identified in step2 to subscribe to \"Availability after DDN
Failure\". The UDM includes the DNN and S-NSSAI as well as the Traffic
Descriptor if available A separate subscription is used for each UE. The NEF
notification endpoint received in step 2 is included in the message. If the
UDM becomes aware that such a UE is registered at a later time than when
receiving step 2, the UDM then executes step 3.
4\. The AMF acknowledges the execution of Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe.
5\. If PDU Session exists for the DNN and S-NSSAI, the AMF subscribes to DDN
Failure status notification by sending the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
Request message to each SMF, requesting the SMF to notify DDN Failure. The AMF
also includes in Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext the Traffic Descriptor and
NEF correlation ID if received from the UDM. For new PDU Session establishment
towards a DNN and S-NSSAI, the AMF subscribes to DDN Failure status
notification in Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request message if the UDM has
subscribed to Availability after DDN Failure event.
In the case of home-routed PDU session or PDU session with I-SMF, the AMF
sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request message(s) to the related
V-SMF(s) or I SMF(s). Steps 9-10 are performed by those V-SMF(s) or I-SMF(s).
6\. The (I/V-)SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response message
to the AMF.
NOTE: Step 7 can happen any time after step 4.
7\. The UDM sends the Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe response to the NEF.
8\. The NEF sends the Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe response to the AF.
9-10. The SMF is informed that the UE is unreachable via a
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation. The SMF then decides
to discard downlink packets received from the UPF. By comparing those
discarded downlink packets received from the UPF with the Traffic
Descriptor(s) received in the event subscription(s), the SMF determines
whether DDN Failure due to any traffic from an AF is to be notified to the AMF
and if so, the SMF sends the DDN Failure status, by means of
Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify message including NEF Correlation ID, to
the AMF. If the UE is not reachable after the AMF received the DDN Failure
notification from the SMF, the AMF shall set a Notify-on-available-after-DDN-
failure flag corresponding to the NEF Correlation ID.
11-12. [Conditional] The AMF detects the UE is reachable and sends the event
report(s) based on the Notify-on-available-after-DDN-failure flag, by means of
Namf_EventExposure_Notify message(s), only to the NEF(s) indicated as
notification endpoint(s) identified via the corresponding subscription in step
3. In this way, only the AF(s) for which DL traffic transmission failed are
notified.
If the AMF received Idle Status Indication request in step 3 and the AMF
supports Idle Status Indication, the AMF includes also the Idle Status
Indication.
13\. The NEF sends Nnef_EventExposure_Notify message with the \"Availability
after DDN Failure\" event to AF.
##### 4.15.3.2.8 Information flow for downlink data delivery status with UPF
buffering
The procedure is used if the SMF requests the UPF to buffer packets. The
procedure describes a mechanism for the Application Function to subscribe to
notifications about downlink data delivery status. The downlink data delivery
status notifications relates to high latency communication, see also clauses
4.24.2 and 4.2.3.3.
Cancelling is done by sending Nnef_EventExposure_Unsubscribe request
identifying the subscription to cancel with Subscription Correlation ID. Steps
2 to 5 are not applicable in the cancellation case.
Figure 4.15.3.2.8-1: Information flow for downlink data delivery status with
UPF buffering
1\. AF interacts with NEF to subscribe DDD status event in SMF as described in
steps 0-6 of clause 4.15.3.2.5.
In the case of subscription cancelling and SMF having interacted with the PCF
during event subscription, the SMF reports to the PCF the unsubscribe of the
DDD status event. The PCF updates or removes the PCC rule and this triggers
the SMF to update or remove the corresponding PDR in the UPF. In case of home-
routed PDU Session, the SMF unsubscribes the DDD status event from the V-SMF
which in turn updates the N4 information (deactivating the notifications) in
the V-UPF. In case of PDU Session with I-SMF, the SMF provides updated N4
information (deactivating the notifications) to the I-SMF which in turn
updates the I-UPF.
2\. If the UPF is configured to apply extended buffering, step 2 is executed
immediately after step 1. Otherwise, step 2 is executed when the SMF is
informed that the UE is unreachable via a
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation as described in
clause 4.2.3 and the SMF then also updates the PDR(s) for flows requiring
extended buffering to requests the UPF to buffer downlink packets. If the DDD
status event with traffic descriptor has been received in the SMF in step 1,
if extended DL Data buffering in the UPF applies, the SMF checks whether an
installed PDR for the Traffic Descriptor exists and if so, requests the UPF to
provide the requested type(s) of notifications. If PCC is not used and there
is no installed PDR with the exact same traffic descriptor, the SMF copies the
installed PDR that would have previously matched the incoming traffic
described by the traffic descriptor, but provides that traffic descriptor, a
higher priority and the requested type(s) of notifications. If PCC is used and
if the \"DDD Status event subscription with Traffic Descriptor\" PCRT is set
as defined in clause 6.1.3.5 of TS 23.503 [20], the SMF interacts with the PCF
and forwards the traffic descriptor before contacting the UPF; the PCF then
updates an existing PCC rule or provides a new PCC rule taking into
consideration the traffic descriptor for the subscribed DDD status event.
NOTE: If a new PCC rule is provided by the PCF for the DDD status event
detection, the PCF populates the PCC rules as defined in clause 6.1.3.5 of TS
23.503 [20].
In the case of home-routed PDU Session, the V-SMF generates the N4 information
(activating the notifications) for the V-UPF based on local configuration.
In the case of PDU Session with I-SMF, the SMF provides N4 information
(activating the notifications) to the I-SMF based on local policy or the \"DDD
Status event subscription with Traffic Descriptor\" PCRT from PCF. The I-SMF
updates the I-UPF with this N4 information.
For home-routed PDU Session or PDU Session with I-SMF, steps 3-4 below are
performed by V-SMF/V-UPF or I-SMF/I-UPF.
3\. The UPF reports when there is buffered or discarded traffic matching the
received PDR to the SMF. The SMF detects that previously buffered packets can
be transmitted by the fact that the related PDU session becomes ACTIVE.
4\. The SMF sends the Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify with Downlink Delivery Status
event message to NEF.
5\. The NEF sends Nnef_EventExposure_Notify with Downlink Delivery Status
event message to AF.
##### 4.15.3.2.9 Information flow for Availability after DDN Failure with UPF
buffering
The procedure is used if the SMF requests the UPF to buffer packets. The
procedure describes a mechanism for the Application Function to subscribe to
notifications about availability after DDN failure.
Cancelling is done by sending Nnef_EventExposure_Unsubscribe request
identifying the subscription to cancel with Subscription Correlation ID. Steps
2 to 7 are not applicable in the cancellation case.
Figure 4.15.3.2.9-1: Information flow for availability after DDN Failure event
with UPF buffering
1\. AF interacts with NEF to subscribe availability after DDN failure event in
AMF/SMF as described in steps 0-8 of clause 4.15.3.2.7.
In case of subscription cancelling from AMF and SMF having interacted with the
PCF during event subscription, the SMF reports to the PCF for the unsubscribe
of DDN failure event. The PCF updates or removes the PCC rule and this
triggers the SMF to update or remove the corresponding PDR and FAR in the UPF.
In the case of PDU Session with I-SMF or home-routed PDU Session, the AMF
unsubscribes the DDN failure event towards I/V-SMF. In case of home-routed PDU
Session, the V-SMF updates the N4 information (deactivating the notifications)
in the V-UPF. In case of PDU Session with I-SMF, the I-SMF may request N4
information (deactivating the notifications) from the SMF and provides the
Traffic Descriptor to the SMF. The SMF provides updated N4 information
(deactivating the notifications) to the I-SMF which in turn updates the Iâ€‘UPF.
2\. The SMF checks whether an installed PDR for the Traffic Descriptor exists
and if so, requests the UPF to report when the first downlink packet is
received and when it is discarded in the UPF. If PCC is not used and there is
no installed PDR with the exact same traffic descriptor, the SMF copies the
installed PDR that would have previously matched the incoming traffic
described by the traffic descriptor, but provides that traffic descriptor, a
higher priority and requests the UPF to report when the first downlink packet
is received and when it is discarded in the UPF.
If PCC is used and if the \"DDN Failure event subscription with Traffic
Descriptor\" PCRT is set as defined in clause 6.1.3.5 of TS 23.503 [20], the
SMF interacts with the PCF and forwards the traffic descriptor before
contacting the UPF; the PCF then updates an existing PCC rule or provides a
new PCC rule taking into consideration the traffic descriptor for the
subscribed DDN failure event.
NOTE 1: If a new PCC rule is provided by the PCF for the DDN failure event
detection, the PCF populates the PCC rules as defined in clause 6.1.3.5 of TS
23.503 [20].
In the case of PDU Session with I-SMF or home-routed PDU Session, the AMF
subscribes the DDN failure event towards the I/V-SMF. In the case of home-
routed PDU Session, the V-SMF generates the N4 information (activating the
notifications) for the V-UPF based on local configuration.
In the case of PDU Session with I-SMF, the I-SMF may request N4 information
(activating the notifications) from the SMF based on local configuration and
provides the Traffic Descriptor to the SMF. The SMF provides updated N4
information (activating the notifications) to the I-SMF which in turn updates
the I-UPF.
For home-routed PDU Session or PDU Session with I-SMF, steps 3-4 below are
performed by V-SMF/V-UPF or I-SMF/I-UPF.
3-4. When the first downlink packet matching the traffic descriptor is
received in the UPF, if in step 2 the SMF indicated drop notification to the
UPF, the UPF notifies the SMF and the SMF reports the DDN Failure status with
NEF Correlation ID, by means of Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify message,
to the AMF indicated as notification endpoint.
When the first downlink packet matching the traffic descriptor is received in
the UPF, if in step 2 the SMF indicated buffer notification to the UPF, the
UPF notifies the SMF and the SMF may initiate Network Triggered Service
Request as specified in clause 4.2.3.3. If the AMF responds
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response with failure (e.g. due to UE
not reachable, or paging no response), in addition to what is specified in
clause 4.2.3.3, the SMF reports DDN Failure status with NEF Correlation ID, by
means of Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify message, to the AMF indicated
as notification endpoint.
When the AMF receives DDN Failure status from the SMF, the AMF shall set a
Notify-on-available-after-DDN-failure flag corresponding to the Notification
Correlation Id and the identifier of the UE if available.
5-6. [Conditional] The AMF detects the UE is reachable and sends the event
report(s) based on the Notify-on-available-after-DDN-failure flag, by means of
Namf_EventExposure_Notify message(s), only to the NEF(s) indicated as
notification endpoint(s) identified via the corresponding subscription in step
1. In this way, only the AF(s) for which DL traffic transmission failed are
notified.
If the AMF received Idle Status Indication request in step 1 and the AMF
supports Idle Status Indication, the AMF includes also the Idle Status
Indication in Namf_EventExposure_Notify message.
7\. The NEF sends Nnef_EventExposure_Notify message with the \"Availability
after DDN Failure\" event to AF.
If the AMF included Idle Status Indication, the NEF includes it in
Nnef_EventExposure message.
#### 4.15.3.3 Void
### 4.15.4 Core Network Internal Event Exposure
#### 4.15.4.1 General
The exposure of events internally within the 5GC NFs is explained in the
following clauses. Only the event notifications that are independent of the
ongoing system procedure are specified in this clause. For the event
notifications that are part of the system procedure, see the system procedure
descriptions under clause 4.2 to clause 4.14.
#### 4.15.4.2 Exposure of Mobility Events from AMF
The AMF invokes the Namf_EventExposure_Notify to provide mobility related
events to NF consumers that have subscribed for the events by invoking
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe, in the following scenarios listed below and
after Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.
\- During Registration procedure, Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover
procedure, when there is a change of AMF (within the same AMF Set or across
the AMF Set), the new AMF receives all event subscriptions from old AMF or
UDSF. For each event subscription:
if the event subscription only applies to the UE, the new AMF allocates a new
Subscription Correlation ID and notify the NF consumer of the new Subscription
Correlation ID associated with the change of Subscription Correlation ID
event.
if the event subscription applies to a group of UE(s) and there is no
corresponding subscription for this group (identified by the internal group Id
and notification endpoint) at the new AMF, the new AMF shall create
corresponding event subscription, allocate a new Subscription Correlation Id
and send it to the received notification endpoint, i.e. Notification Target
Address (+Notification Correlation Id), associated with the addition of
Subscription Correlation ID event. The new AMF does not need to allocate
another Subscription Correlation ID for any subsequent registrations of the
members of the same group. The initial Maximum number of reports and the
remaining number of reports within the Maximum number of reports quota for the
UE is transferred from the old AMF.
NOTE: For group monitoring, even if the remaining number of reports is zero,
indicating that reporting for the group event has been completed by the old
AMF for this UE, the new AMF uses the received information related to initial
event subscription to create the corresponding group event subscription.
\- During Registration procedure, when there is a change of AMF, the new AMF
notifies each NF that has subscribed for UE reachability event about the UE
reachability status.
\- During Registration, Handover, UE Triggered Service Request procedure in
CM-IDLE state, Location Reporting, N2 Notification and AN Release procedures,
the AMF determines the UE presence in Area Of Interest (i.e. IN, OUT or
UNKNOWN status ) as described in Annex D.1 and notifies the NF Consumers of
the UE presence in an Area Of Interest if the NF consumers (e.g. SMF) had
subscribed for this Area Of Interest and if the UE presence in Area Of
Interest is different from the one reported earlier.
\- During Registration and Handover procedure or during Service Area
Restriction update by UDM or PCF, if the UE is moving from an Allowed Area to
a Non-Allowed Area, then the AMF informs all the NF consumers (e.g. SMF), that
have subscribed for UE reachability event, that the UE is reachable only for
regulatory prioritized service. The SMF shall explicitly subscribe UE
reachability unless the established PDU Session is related to regulatory
prioritized service.
\- If the AMF had notified an SMF of the UE being reachable only for
regulatory prioritized service earlier, the AMF informs the NF consumers (e.g.
SMF), that have subscribed for UE reachability event, that the UE is reachable
if the UE enters into Allowed Area.
\- During Registration procedure and Service Request procedure, if the AMF had
notified an SMF earlier of the UE being unreachable and that SMF need not
invoke Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to the AMF due to DL data
notifications, the AMF informs the SMF when the UE becomes reachable.
\- During Registration procedure and Service Request procedure, if the AMF had
notified an SMF earlier that the UE is unreachable together with an Estimated
Maximum Wait time, then the AMF informs the SMF when the UE becomes reachable.
When the SMF learns that the UE is reachable and:
\- if the SMF performs Extended Buffering for a PDU session, the SMF sends the
buffered data to the UPF and invokes the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation to the AMF to
establish the User Plane(s) for the PDU Sessions, or the buffered data is
delivered to the UE as per the procedure in clause 4.24.2 starting from step
2g for a PDU session using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation;
\- if the UPF performs Extended Buffering for a PDU session, the SMF invokes
the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation to the AMF to
establish the User Plane(s) for the PDU Sessions, or the buffered data is
delivered to the UE as per the procedure in clause 4.24.2 starting from step
8a for a PDU session using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation.
\- If NEF had subscribed for UE reachability event notification for Extend
Buffering, then the AMF informs the NEF when the UE becomes reachable. When
the NEF learns that the UE is reachable, it invokes the Nsmf_NIDD_Delivery
service operation of the corresponding SMF to deliver the buffered data to the
UE as per the procedure in the clause 4.25.5 starting from step 2 for a PDU
session using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation.
\- During Registration procedure, Handover without Registration procedure and
Service Request procedure, if the NF consumers had subscribed for UE
reachability status, the AMF notifies the UE reachability status changes.
\- If the Mobile Reachable Timer expires the AMF notifies the NF consumers
that have subscribed for the corresponding events that the UE is not
reachable.
\- If the UDM had subscribed for UE reachability event notification either to
be reported to the UDM or to an NF consumer directly, then the AMF notifies
the UE reachability event to the UDM or to the NF consumer as specified in
clause 4.2.5.2.
\- If UE\'s TAC is already known by the AMF, then, the AMF notifies UE TAC to
the NF consumers (e.g. to NWDAF). If UE TAC is unknown, then the AMF notifies
the UE TAC when it obtained the UE TAC from the UE.
### 4.15.5 Void
### 4.15.6 External Parameter Provisioning
#### 4.15.6.1 General
Provisioning capability allows an external party to provision the information,
such as expected UE behaviour and service specific parameters, or the 5G VN
group information to 5G network functions. In the case of provisioning the
expected UE behavioural information, the expected UE behavioural information
consists of information on expected UE movement and communication
characteristics. In the case of provisioning the 5G VN group information the
provisioning information consists of information on 5G VN group. The service
specific information consists of information to support the specific service
in 5G system. Provisioned data can be used by the other NFs.
#### 4.15.6.2 NEF service operations information flow

Nnef_ParameterProvision_Update / Nnef_ParameterProvision_Delete
request/response operations
0\. NF subscribes to UDM notifications of UE and/or Group Subscription data
updates.
NOTE 1: The NF can subscribe to Group Subscription data from UDM in this step
and be notified of Group Subscription data updates in step 7 using the Shared
Data feature defined in TS 29.503 [52].
0b. [Conditional, on using NWDAF-assisted values] The AF may subscribe to
NWDAF via NEF in order to learn the UE mobility analytics and/or UE
Communication analytics for a UE or group of UEs by applying the procedure
specified in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.288 [50]. The Analytics Id is set to any
of the values specified in clause 6.7.1 of TS 23.288 [50].
0c. [Conditional, on using NWDAF-assisted values] AF validates the received
data and derives any of the Expected UE behaviour parameters defined in clause
4.15.6.3 for a UE or group of UEs.
1\. The AF provides one or more parameter(s) to be created or updated in a
Nnef_ParameterProvision_Create or Nnef_ParameterProvision_Update or
Nnef_ParameterProvision_Delete Request to the NEF.
The GPSI identifies the UE and the Transaction Reference ID identifies the
transaction request between NEF and AF. For the case of
Nnef_ParameterProvision_Create, The NEF assigns a Transaction Reference ID to
the Nnef_ParameterProvision_Create request.
NEF checks whether the requestor is allowed to perform the requested service
operation by checking requestor\'s identifier (i.e. AF ID).
For a Create request associated with a 5G VN group, the External Group ID
identifies the 5G VN Group.
The payload of the Nnef_ParameterProvision_Update Request includes one or more
of the following parameters:
\- Expected UE Behaviour parameters (see clause 4.15.6.3); or
\- Network Configuration parameters (see clause 4.15.6.3a); or
\- External Group Id and 5G VN group data (i.e. 5G-VN configuration
parameters) (see clause 4.15.6.3b), or
\- 5G VN group membership management parameters (see clause 4.15.6.3c); or
\- Location Privacy Indication parameters of the \"LCS privacy\" Data Subset
of the Subscription Data (see clause 5.2.3.3.1 and clause 7.1 of TS 23.273
[51]); or
\- MTC Provider Information.
The AF may request to delete 5G VN configuration by sending
Nnef_ParameterProvision_Delete to the NEF.
2\. If the AF is authorised by the NEF to provision the parameters, the NEF
requests to create, update and store, or delete the provisioned parameters as
part of the subscriber data via Nudm_ParameterProvision_Create,
Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update or Nudm_ParameterProvision_Delete Request
message, the message includes the provisioned data and NEF reference ID and
optionally MTC Provider Information.
If the AF is not authorised to provision the parameters, then the NEF
continues in step 6 indicating the reason to failure in
Nnef_ParameterProvision_Create/Update/Delete Response message. Step 7 does not
apply in this case.
NOTE 2: For non-roaming case and no authorisation or validation by the UDM
required and if the request is not associated with a 5G VN group, the NEF can
directly forward the external parameter to the UDR via Nudr_DM_Update Request
message. And in this case, the UDR responds to NEF via Nudr_DM_Update Response
message.
3\. UDM may read from UDR, by means of Nudr_DM_Query, corresponding
subscription information in order to validate required data updates and
authorize these changes for this subscriber or Group for the corresponding AF.
4\. If the AF is authorised by the UDM to provision the parameters for this
subscriber, the UDM resolves the GPSI to SUPI and requests to create, update
or delete the provisioned parameters as part of the subscriber data via
Nudr_DM_Create/Update/Delete Request message, the message includes the
provisioned data.
If a new 5G VN group is created, the UDM shall assign a unique Internal Group
ID for the 5G VN group and include the newly assigned Internal Group ID in the
Nudr_DM_Create Request message. If the list of 5G VN group members is changed
or if 5G VN group data has changed, the UDM updates the UE and/or Group
subscription data according to the AF/NEF request.
UDR stores the provisioned data as part of the UE and/or Group subscription
data and responds with Nudr_DM_Create/Update/Delete Response message.
When the 5G VN group data (as described in clause 4.15.6.3b) or 5G VN group
membership is updated, the UDR notifies to the subscribed PCF by sending
Nudr_DM_Notify as defined in clause 4.16.12.2.
If the AF is not authorised to provision the parameters, then the UDM
continues in step 5 indicating the reason to failure in
Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update Response message and step 7 is not executed.
The UDM classifies the received parameters (i.e. Expected UE Behaviour
parameters or Suggested Number of Downlink Packets or the 5G VN configuration
parameters or Location Privacy Indication parameters), into AMF associated and
SMF associated parameters. The UDM may use the AF ID received from the NEF in
step 2 to relate the received parameter with a particular subscribed DNN
and/or S-NSSAI. The UDM stores the SMF-Associated parameters under
corresponding Session Management Subscription data type.
Each parameter or parameter set may be associated with a validity time. The
validity time is stored at the UDM/UDR and in each of the NFs, to which
parameters are provisioned (e.g. in AMF or SMF). Upon expiration of the
validity time, each node deletes the parameters autonomously without explicit
signalling.
5\. UDM responds the request with Nudm_ParameterProvision_Create/Update/Delete
Response. If the procedure failed, the cause value indicates the reason.
6\. NEF responds the request with Nnef_ParameterProvision_Create/Update/Delete
Response. If the procedure failed, the cause value indicates the reason.
7\. [Conditional this step occurs only after successful step 4] UDM notifies
the subscribed Network Function (e.g. AMF) of the updated UE and/or Group
subscription data via Nudm_SDM_Notification Notify message.
a) If the NF is AMF, the UDM performs Nudm_SDM_Notification (SUPI or Internal
Group Identifier, AMF-Associated Expected UE Behaviour parameters, Subscribed
Periodic Registration Timer, subscribed Active Time, etc.) service operation.
The AMF identifies whether there are overlapping parameter set(s) and merges
the parameter set(s) in the Expected UE Behaviour, if necessary. The AMF uses
the received parameters to derive the appropriate UE configuration of the NAS
parameters and to derive Core Network assisted RAN parameters. The AMF may
determine a Registration area based on parameters Stationary indication or
Expected UE Moving Trajectory.
b) If the NF is SMF, the UDM performs Nudm_SDM_Notification (SUPI or Internal
Group Identifier, SMF-Associated Expected UE Behaviour parameter set,
DNN/S-NSSAI, Suggested Number of Downlink Packets, etc.) service operation.
The SMF stores the received parameters and associates them with a PDU Session
based on the DNN and S-NSSAI included in the message from UDM. The SMF
identifies whether there are overlapping parameter set(s) in the Expected UE
behaviour and merges the parameter set(s), if necessary. The SMF may use the
parameters as follows:
\- SMF configures the UPF accordingly. The SMF can use the Scheduled
Communication Type parameter or Suggested Number of Downlink Packets parameter
to configure the UPF with how many downlink packets to buffer. The SMF may use
the parameter Communication duration time to determine to deactivate UP
connection and to perform CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection
of an existing PDU Session.
\- The SMF may derive SMF derived CN assisted RAN information for the PDU
Session. The SMF provides the SMF derived CN assisted RAN information to the
AMF as described in PDU Session establishment procedure or PDU Session
modification procedure.
NOTE 3: The NEF (in NOTE 1) or the UDM (in step 3) can also update the
corresponding UDR data via Nudr_DM_Create/Delete as appropriate.
#### 4.15.6.3 Expected UE Behaviour parameters
These Expected UE Behaviour parameters characterise the foreseen behaviour of
a UE or a group of UEs. Sets of these parameters may be provided via the NEF
to be stored as part of the subscriber data. Each parameter within the
Expected UE Behaviour shall have an associating validity time. The validity
time indicates when the Expected UE Behaviour parameter expires and shall be
deleted by the related NFs. The validity time may be set to indicate that the
particular Expected UE Behaviour parameter has no expiration time. When the
validity time expires, the related NFs delete their local copy of the
associated Expected UE Behaviour parameter(s). The provision procedure of the
Expected UE Behaviour is realized by external parameter provision procedure
defined in clause 4.15.6.2.
The Expected UE Behaviour parameters stored as AMF-Associated Expected UE
Behaviour parameters which is per UE level and SMF-Associated Expected UE
Behaviour parameters which is per PDU session level in UDM. AMF retrieves the
AMF-Associated Expected UE Behaviour parameters from UDM which may related to
both PDU session(s) and SMS transmission. SMF retrieves the SMF-Associated
Expected UE Behaviour parameters from UDM for the specific PDU session. AMF
and SMF uses the Expected UE Behaviour parameters as described in clause
5.4.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
Table 4.15.6.3-1: Description of Expected UE Behaviour parameters
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Expected UE Behaviour parameter | Description | +==================================+==================================+ | Expected UE Moving Trajectory | Identifies the UE\'s expected | | | geographical movement | | | | | | Example: A planned path of | | | movement | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Stationary Indication | Identifies whether the UE is | | | stationary or mobile | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Communication Duration Time | Indicates for how long the UE | | | will normally stay in | | | CM-Connected for data | | | transmission. | | | | | | Example: 5 minutes. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Periodic Time | Interval Time of periodic | | | communication | | | | | | Example: every hour. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Scheduled Communication Time | Time and day of the week when | | | the UE is available for | | | communication. | | | | | | Example: Time: 13:00-20:00, Day: | | | Monday. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Battery Indication | Identifies power consumption | | | criticality for the UE: if the | | | UE is battery powered with not | | | rechargeable/not replaceable | | | battery, battery powered with | | | rechargeable/replaceable | | | battery, or not battery powered. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Traffic Profile | Identifies the type of data | | | transmission: single packet | | | transmission (UL or DL), dual | | | packet transmission (UL with | | | subsequent DL or DL with | | | subsequent UL), multiple packets | | | transmission | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Scheduled Communication Type | Indicates that the Scheduled | | | Communication Type is Downlink | | | only or Uplink only or | | | Bi-directional [To be used | | | together with Scheduled | | | Communication Time] | | | | | | Example: \, DL only. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Expected Time and Day of Week in | Identifies the time and day of | | Trajectory | week when the UE is expected to | | | be at each location included in | | | the Expected UE Moving | | | Trajectory. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
The Expected UE Moving Trajectory and the Expected Time and Day of Week in
Trajectory may be used by the AMF. All other parameters may be used by the AMF
and by the SMF.
The Scheduled Communication Type and the Traffic Profile should not be used by
the AMF to release the UE when NAS Release Assistance Information from the UE
is available.
In the case of NB-IoT UEs, the parameters may be forwarded to the RAN to allow
optimisation of Uu resource allocation for NB-IoT UE differentiation.
#### 4.15.6.3a Network Configuration parameters
The Network Configuration parameters are the parameters sent from an AF by
invoking the Nnef_ParameterProvision Service as described in clause 4.15.6.2.
The Network Configuration parameters are described in Table 4.15.6.3a-1.
Table 4.15.6.3a-1: Description of Network Configuration parameters
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Network Configuration parameter | Description | +==================================+==================================+ | Maximum Response Time | Identifies the time for which | | | the UE stays reachable to allow | | | the AF to reliably deliver the | | | required downlink data. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Maximum Latency | Identifies maximum delay | | | acceptable for downlink data | | | transfers. | | | | | | Example: in order of 1 minute to | | | multiple hours. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Suggested Number of Downlink | Identifies the number of packets | | Packets | that the core network is | | | suggested to buffer if the UE is | | | not reachable. | | | | | | Example: 5 packets. | | | | | | [optional] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
The parameters Maximum Response Time and Maximum Latency are stored in the UDM
and the Maximum Response Time is sent to the AMF for event monitoring as
specified in 4.15.3.2.3b.
The AMF may use the Maximum Response Time parameter as guide to configure:
\- Extended Connected time for MICO mode;
\- when to send reachability notifications to AF relative to expected
reachability events (e.g. paging occasions).
If the UDM received multiple Network Configuration requests, the UDM shall
accept the request as long as the Maximum Latency (if received) and/or the
Maximum Response Time (if received) are within the range defined by operator
policies. The UDM shall use the minimum value of Maximum Latency(s) to derive
the subscribed periodic registration timer and use the maximum value of
Maximum Response Time(s) to derive the subscribed Active Time as specified in
step 2 of clause 4.15.3.2.3b. If the newly derived value is changed comparing
to the one last time sent to the AMF, the UDM notify the AMF of the updated
value via Nudm_SDM_Notification message. If there is a deletion of Network
Configuration request, the UDM re-calculates the values (see step 2 in clause
4.15.3.2.3b) and notify the AMF if needed.
The Suggested Number of Downlink Packets is classified as SMF associated
subscription data. If the NEF is providing DNN and S-NSSAI as specified in
clause 4.15.3.2.3, then the UDM is able to associate the parameters with
subscribed DNN and S-NSSAI and provides the Suggested Number of Downlink
Packets consolidated as specified in 4.15.3.2.3b to the SMF for the PDU
Session associated with the specific DNN and S-NSSAI as specified in clause
4.15.6.2. The SMF may use the Suggested Number of Downlink Packets parameter
to configure the number of packets to buffer in the SMF/UPF (in the case of
UPF anchored PDU sessions) or in the NEF (in the case of NEF anchored PDU
session) when the UE is not reachable and extended buffering of downlink data
is activated.
A Validity Time may be associated with any of the Network Configuration
parameters. When the validity time expires, the related NFs delete their local
copy of the associated Network Configuration parameter(s). If the deletion
results in subscribed value change, the UDM shall notify the AMF or SMF of the
changed value.
#### 4.15.6.3b 5G VN group data
The 5G VN group data is described in Table 4.15.6.3b-1.
Table 4.15.6.3b-1: Description of 5G VN group data
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Parameters | Description | +==================================+==================================+ | DNN | DNN for the 5G VN group | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | S-NSSAI | S-NSSAI for the 5G VN group | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | PDU Session Type | PDU Session Types allowed for 5G | | | VN group | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Application descriptor | There may be multiple instances | | | of this information; this | | | information may be used to build | | | URSP sent to 5G VN group members | | | (NOTE 1) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Information related with | This may indicate: | | secondary authentication / | | | authorization | - the need for secondary | | | authentication/authorization (as | | | defined in clause 5.6 of | | | TS 23.501 [2]); | | | | | | - the need for SMF to request | | | the UE IP address from the | | | DN-AAA server. | | | | | | If at least one of secondary | | | authentication/authorization or | | | DN-AAA UE IP address allocation | | | is needed, the AF may provide | | | DN-AAA server addressing | | | information. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | NOTE 1: As described in | | | TS 23.503 [20], the PCF may be | | | configured with a mapping from | | | Application Descriptor to other | | | information required to | | | construct the URSP rules, e.g. | | | IP filters and SSC mode. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
The information described in Table 4.15.6.3b-1 corresponds to 5G VN group data
that an AF may provide together with External Group ID.
#### 4.15.6.3c 5G VN Group membership management parameters
5G VN group membership management parameters that an AF may provide are
described in Table 4.15.6.3c-1.

#### 4.15.6.4 Set a chargeable party at AF session setup
Figure 4.15.6.4-1: Set the chargeable party at AF session set-up
1\. When setting up the connection between an ASP sponsoring a session and the
UE, the ASP may communicate with the AF to request to become the chargeable
party for the session to be set up by sending a Nnef_ChargeableParty_Create
request message (AF Identifier, UE address, Flow description(s), Sponsor
Information, Sponsoring Status, Background Data Transfer Reference ID) to the
NEF, The Sponsoring Status indicates whether sponsoring is started or stopped,
i.e. whether the 3rd party service provider is the chargeable party or not.
The Background Data Transfer Reference ID parameter identifies a previously
negotiated transfer policy for background data transfer as defined in clause
4.16.7. The NEF assigns a Transaction Reference ID to the
Nnef_ChargeableParty_Create request.
2\. The NEF authorizes the AF request to sponsor the application traffic and
stores the sponsor information together with the AF Identifier and the
Transaction Reference ID. If the authorisation is not granted, step 2 is
skipped and the NEF replies to the AF with a Result value indicating that the
authorisation failed.
NOTE: Based on operator configuration, the NEF may skip this step. In this
case the authorization is performed by the PCF in step 3.
3\. The NEF interacts with the PCF by triggering a
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request message and provides IP filter
information or Ethernet filter information, sponsored data connectivity
information (as defined in TS 23.203 [24]), Background Data Transfer Reference
ID (if received from the AF) and Sponsoring Status (if received from the AF)
to the PCF.
4\. The PCF determines whether the request is allowed and notifies the NEF if
the request is not authorized. If the request is not authorized, NEF responds
to the AF in step 5 with a Result value indicating that the authorization
failed.
5\. The NEF sends a Nnef_ChargeableParty_Create response message (Transaction
Reference ID, Result) to the AF. Result indicates whether the request is
granted or not.
#### 4.15.6.5 Change the chargeable party during the session
Figure 4.15.6.5-1: Change the chargeable party during the session
1\. For the ongoing AF session, the AF may send a Nnef_ChargeableParty_Update
request message (AF Identifier, Transaction Reference ID, Sponsoring Status,
Background Data Transfer Reference ID) to the NEF. The Sponsoring Status
indicates whether sponsoring is enabled or disabled, i.e. whether the 3rd
party service provider is the chargeable party or not. The Background Data
Transfer Reference ID parameter identifies a previously negotiated transfer
policy for background data transfer as defined in clause 4.16.7. The
Transaction Reference ID provided in the Change chargeable party request
message is set to the Transaction Reference ID that was assigned, by the NEF,
to the a Nnef_ChargeableParty_Create request.
2\. The NEF authorizes the AF request of changing the chargeable party. If the
authorisation is not granted, step 3 is skipped and the NEF replies to the AF
with a Result value indicating that the authorisation failed.
NOTE: Based on operator configuration, the NEF may skip this step. In this
case the authorization is performed by the PCF in step 3.
3\. The NEF interacts with the PCF by triggering a
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request and provides IP filter information or
Ethernet filter information, sponsored data connectivity information (as
defined in TS 23.203 [24]), Background Data Transfer Reference ID (if received
from the AF) and Sponsoring Status (if received from the AF) to the PCF.
4\. The PCF determines whether the request is allowed and notifies the NEF if
the request is not authorized. If the request is not authorized, NEF responds
to the AF in step 5 with a Result value indicating that the authorization
failed.
5\. The NEF sends a Nnef_ChargeableParty_Update response message (Transaction
Reference ID, Result) to the AF. Result indicates whether the request is
granted or not.
#### 4.15.6.6 Setting up an AF session with required QoS procedure
Figure 4.15.6.6-1: Setting up an AF session with required QoS procedure
1\. The AF sends a request to reserve resources for an AF session using
Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request message (UE address, AF Identifier, Flow
description(s), QoS reference, (optional) Alternative Service Requirements
(containing one or more QoS reference parameters in a prioritized order)) to
the NEF. Optionally, a period of time or a traffic volume for the requested
QoS can be included in the AF request. The NEF assigns a Transaction Reference
ID to the Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request.
2\. The NEF authorizes the AF request and may apply policies to control the
overall amount of pre-defined QoS authorized for the AF. If the authorisation
is not granted, steps 3 and 4 are skipped and the NEF replies to the AF with a
Result value indicating that the authorisation failed.
3\. The NEF interacts with the PCF by triggering a
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request and provides UE address, AF
Identifier, Flow description(s), the QoS reference and the optional
Alternative Service Requirements (containing one or more QoS reference
parameters in a prioritized order). Any optionally received period of time or
traffic volume is also included and mapped to sponsored data connectivity
information (as defined in TS 23.203 [24]).
4\. The PCF determines whether the request is authorized and notifies the NEF
if the request is not authorized.
If the request is authorized, the PCF derives the required QoS parameters
based on the information provided by the NEF and determines whether this QoS
is allowed (according to the PCF configuration for this AF) and notifies the
result to the NEF. In addition, if the Alternative Service Requirements are
provided, the PCF derives the Alternative QoS parameter set(s) from the one or
more QoS reference parameters contained in the Alternative Service
Requirements in the same prioritized order (as defined in TS 23.503 [20]).
If the request is not authorized, or the required QoS is not allowed, NEF
responds to the AF in step 5 with a Result value indicating the failure cause.
5\. The NEF sends a Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create response message (Transaction
Reference ID, Result) to the AF. Result indicates whether the request is
granted or not.
6\. The NEF shall send a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe message to the PCF
to subscribe to notifications of Resource allocation status and may subscribe
to other events described in clause 6.1.3.18 of TS 23.503 [20].
7\. When the event condition is met, e.g. that the establishment of the
transmission resources corresponding to the QoS update succeeded or failed,
the PCF sends Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify message to the NEF notifying
about the event.
8\. The NEF sends Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Notify message with the event reported
by the PCF to the AF.
The AF may send Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Revoke request to NEF in order to revoke
the AF request. The NEF authorizes the revoke request and triggers the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete and the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe
operations for the AF request.
#### 4.15.6.6a AF session with required QoS update procedure
Figure 4.15.6.6a-1: AF session with required QoS update procedure
1\. For an established AF session with required QoS, the AF may send a
Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Update request message (AF Identifier, Transaction
Reference ID, [Flow description(s)], [QoS reference], [Alternative Service
Requirements (containing one or more QoS reference parameters in a prioritized
order)]) to NEF for updating the reserved resources. Optionally, a period of
time or a traffic volume for the requested QoS can be included in the AF
request. The Transaction Reference ID provided in the AF session with required
QoS update request message is set to the Transaction Reference ID that was
assigned, by the NEF, to the Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request message.
2\. The NEF authorizes the AF request of updating AF session with required QoS
and may apply policies to control the overall amount of pre-defined QoS
authorized for the AF. If the authorisation is not granted, steps 3 and 4 are
skipped and the NEF replies to the AF with a Result value indicating that the
authorisation failed.
3\. The NEF interacts with the PCF by triggering a
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request and provides UE address, AF
Identifier, Flow description(s), the QoS reference and the optional
Alternative Service Requirements (containing one or more QoS reference
parameters in a prioritized order). Any optionally received period of time or
traffic volume is also included and mapped to sponsored data connectivity
information (as defined in TS 23.203 [24]).
4\. The PCF determines whether the request is authorized.
If the request is authorized, the PCF derives the required QoS parameters
based on the information provided by the NEF and determines whether this QoS
is allowed (according to the PCF configuration for this AF) and notifies the
result to the NEF. In addition, if the Alternative Service Requirements are
provided, the PCF derives the Alternative QoS parameter set(s) from the one or
more QoS reference parameters contained in the Alternative Service
Requirements in the same prioritized order (as defined in TS 23.503 [20]).
If the request is not authorized or the required QoS is not allowed, NEF
responds to the AF in step 5 with a Result value indicating the failure cause.
5\. The NEF sends a Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Update response message (Transaction
Reference ID, Result) to the AF. Result indicates whether the request is
granted or not.
6\. The PCF sends Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify message to the NEF when the
modification of the transmission resources corresponding to the QoS update
succeeded or failed.
7\. The NEF sends Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Notify message with the event reported
by the PCF to the AF.
#### 4.15.6.7 Service specific parameter provisioning
This clause describes the procedures for enabling the AF to provide service
specific parameters to 5G system via NEF.
The AF may issue requests on behalf of applications not owned by the PLMN
serving the UE.
NOTE 1: In the case of architecture without CAPIF support, the AF is locally
configured with the API termination points for the service. In the case of
architecture with CAPIF support, the AF obtains the service API information
from the CAPIF core function via the Availability of service APIs event
notification or Service Discover Response as specified in TS 23.222 [54].
The AF request sent to the NEF contains the information as below:
1)- Service Description.
Service Description is the information to identify a service the Service
Parameters are applied to. The Service Description in the AF request can be
represented by the combination of DNN and S-NSSAI, an AF-Service-Identifier or
an application identifier.
2) Service Parameters.
Service Parameters are the service specific information which needs to be
provisioned in the Network and delivered to the UE in order to support the
service identified by the Service Description.
3) Target UE(s) or a group of UEs.
Target UE(s) or a group of UEs indicate the UE(s) who the Service Parameters
shall be delivered to. Individual UEs can be identified by GPSI, or an IP
address/Prefix or a MAC address. Groups of UEs can be identified by an
External Group Identifiers as defined in TS 23.682 [23]. If identifiers of
target UE(s) or a group of UEs are not provided, then the Service Parameters
shall be delivered to any UEs using the service identified by the Service
Description.
The NEF authorizes the AF request received from the AF and stores the
information in the UDR as \"Application Data\". The Service Parameters are
delivered to the targeted UE by the PCF when the UE is reachable.
Figure 4.15.6.7-1 shows procedure for service specific parameter provisioning.
The AF uses Nnef_ServiceParameter service to provide the service specific
parameters to the PLMN and the UE.
Figure 4.15.6.7-1: Service specific information provisioning
1\. To create a new request, the AF invokes an Nnef_ServiceParameter_Create
service operation.
To update or remove an existing request, the AF invokes an
Nnef_ServiceParameter_Update or Nnef_ServiceParameter_Delete service operation
together with the corresponding Transaction Reference ID which was provided to
the AF in Nnef_ServiceParameter_Create response message.
The content of this service operation (AF request) includes the information
described in clause 5.2.6.11.
2\. The AF sends its request to the NEF. The NEF authorizes the AF request.
The NEF performs the following mappings:
\- Map the AF-Service-Identifier into DNN and S-NSSAI combination, determined
by local configuration.
\- Map the GPSI in Target UE Identifier into SUPI, according to information
received from UDM.
\- Map the External Group Identifier in Target UE Identifier into Internal
Group Identifier, according to information received from UDM.
(in the case of Nnef_ServiceParameter_Create): The NEF assigns a Transaction
Reference ID to the Nnef_ServiceParameter_Create request.
3\. (in the case of Nnef_ServiceParameter_Create or Update): The NEF stores
the AF request information in the UDR as the \"Application Data\" (Data Subset
setting to \"Service specific information\") together with the assigned
Transaction Reference ID.
(in the case of Nnef_ServiceParameter_delete): The NEF deletes the AF request
information from the UDR.
4\. The NEF responds to the AF. In the case of Nnef_ServiceParameter_Create
response message, the response message includes the assigned Transaction
Reference ID.
If the UE is registered to the network and the PCF performs the subscription
to notification to the data modified in the UDR by invoking Nudr_DM_Subscribe
(AF service parameter provisioning information, SUPI, Data Set setting to
\"Application Data\", Data Subset setting to \"Service specific information\")
at step 0, the following steps are performed:
5\. The PCF(s) receive(s) a Nudr_DM_Notify notification of data change from
the UDR.
NOTE 2: PCF does not have to subscribe for each UE the application specific
information, e.g. if PCF has already received the application specific
information for a group of UE or for a DNN by a subscription of other UE. The
same application specific information is delivered to every UE in a group or a
DNN.
6\. The PCF initiates UE Policy delivery as specified in clause 4.2.4.3.
#### 4.15.6.8 Set a policy for a future AF session
Figure 4.15.6.8-1: Set a policy for a future AF session
1\. The AF previously negotiated policy for background data transfer using the
Procedure for future background data transfer as described in clause 4.16.7.2.
2\. The AF requests that the previously negotiated policy for background data
transfer be applied to a group of UE(s) or any UE, by invoking the
Nnef_ApplyPolicy_Create service operation (AF Identifier, External Identifier
or External Group Identifier, Background Data Transfer Reference ID). The
Background Data Transfer Reference ID parameter identifies a previously
negotiated transfer policy for background data transfer as defined in clause
4.16.7. The NEF assigns a Transaction Reference ID to the
Nnef_ApplyPolicy_Create request. The NEF authorizes the AF request and stores
the AF Identifier and the Transaction Reference ID.
3\. The NEF invokes Nudm_SDM_Get (Identifier Translation, GPSI) to resolve the
GPSI (External Identifier) to a SUPI or the NEF requests to resolve the
External Group Identifier into the Internal Group Identifier using
Nudm_SDM_Get (Group Identifier Translation, External Group Identifier).
4a. The NEF stores the AF request information in the UDR (Data Set =
Application Data; Data Subset = Background Data Transfer, Data Key = Internal
Group Identifier or SUPI).
4b. The NEF responds to the Nnef_ApplyPolicy_Create Request (Transaction
Reference ID).
5\. The PCF(s) that have subscribed to modifications of AF requests (Data Set
= Application Data; Data Subset = Background Data Transfer, Data Key =
Internal Group Identifier or SUPI) receive(s) a Nudr_DM_Notify notification of
data change from the UDR.
### 4.15.7 Network status reporting
This clause contains the detailed description and the procedures for the
network status reporting capability.
An AF may request for being notified about the network status, in a specific
geographical area or for a specific UE.
The following methods are supported:
\- The AF requests to be informed, one-time, about the network status. This
procedure is referred to as one-time network status request;
\- The AF requests to be informed, continuously, about the network status.
This procedure is referred to as continuous network status request;
The procedure as described in clause 6.1.1.2 or clause 6.1.2.2 of TS 23.288
[50] is used by an AF to retrieve Network Status Result (NSR) from the network
for a specific geographic area or for a specific UE.
After receiving the request for network status notification from the AF, the
NEF retrieves user data congestion analytics information from NWDAF, as
defined in TS 23.288 [50].
Based on the user data congestion analytics information the NEF receives from
the NWDAF, the NEF derives and reports the network status for the geographical
area or for the UE as Network Status Result (NSR) to the AF. When reporting to
the AF, the NSR shall not include any 3GPP location information.
NOTE 1: Either exact values for congestion status, as reported by NWDAF to NEF
or abstracted values e.g. (High, Medium, Low) can be reported by the NEF to
the AF. The calculation and the reporting of the NSR to the AF depends on
operator configuration (e.g. SLAs, usage etc.).
When an AF requests one-time Network Status from the NEF, the NEF can
optionally provide a time interval at which the AF is allowed to re-issue the
same request for network status.
NOTE 2: The time interval provided by NEF can be ignored by the AF if the
subsequent request on network status is considerably different with regards to
the geographical area or the UE.
## 4.16 Procedures and flows for Policy Framework
### 4.16.1 AM Policy Association Establishment
#### 4.16.1.1 General
There are three cases considered for AM Policy Association Establishment:
1\. UE initial registration with the network.
2\. The AMF re-allocation with PCF change in handover procedure and
registration procedure.
3\. EPS to 5GS mobility when there is no existing AM Policy Association
between AMF and PCF for this UE.
#### 4.16.1.2 AM Policy Association Establishment with new Selected PCF
Figure 4.16.1.2-1: AM Policy Association Establishment with new Selected PCF
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the role of the V-PCF is performed by the PCF. For the
roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the AMF.
1\. Based on local policies, the AMF decides to establish AM Policy
Association with the (V-)PCF then steps 2 to 3 are performed under the
conditions described below.
2\. [Conditional] If the AMF has not yet obtained Access and Mobility policy
for the UE or if the Access and Mobility policy in the AMF are no longer
valid, the AMF requests the PCF to apply operator policies for the UE from the
PCF. The AMF sends Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Create to the (V-)PCF to establish an
AM policy control association with the (V-)PCF. The request includes the
following information: SUPI, Internal Group (see clause 5.9.7 of TS 23.501
[2]), subscription notification indication and, if available, Service Area
Restrictions, RFSP index, Subscribed UE-AMBR, the Allowed NSSAI, GPSI which
are retrieved from the UDM during the update location procedure and may
include Access Type and RAT Type, PEI, ULI, UE time zone and Serving Network
(PLMN ID, or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.34 of TS 23.501 [2]).
3\. The (V)-PCF responds to the Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Create service operation.
The (V)-PCF provides Access and mobility related policy information (e.g.
Service Area Restrictions) as defined in clause 6.5 of TS 23.503 [20]. In
addition, (V)-PCF can provide Policy Control Request Trigger of AM Policy
Association to AMF.
The AMF is implicitly subscribed in the (V-)PCF to be notified of changes in
the policies.
4\. [Conditional] The AMF deploys the Access and mobility related policy
information which includes storing the Service Area Restrictions and Policy
Control Request Trigger of AM Policy Association, provisioning Service Area
Restrictions to the UE and provisioning the RFSP index, the UE-AMBR and
Service Area Restrictions to the NG-RAN as defined in TS 23.501 [2].
#### 4.16.1.3 Void
### 4.16.2 AM Policy Association Modification
#### 4.16.2.0 General
There are three cases considered for AM Policy Association Modification:
\- Case A: A Policy Control Request Trigger condition is met: the procedure is
initiated by the AMF.
\- Case B: PCF local decision or trigger from other peers of the PCF (i.e.
UDR): the procedure is initiated by the PCF.
\- Case C: AM Policy Association Modification with the old PCF during AMF
relocation: the procedure is initiated by the AMF.
#### 4.16.2.1 AM Policy Association Modification initiated by the AMF
##### 4.16.2.1.1 AM Policy Association Modification initiated by the AMF
without AMF relocation
This procedure is applicable to Case A.
Figure 4.16.2.1.1-1: AM Policy Association Modification initiated by the AMF
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the role of the V-PCF is performed by the PCF. For the
roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the AMF.
1\. When a Policy Control Request Trigger condition is met the AMF updates AM
Policy Association and provides information on the conditions that have
changed to the PCF by invoking Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Update.
2\. The (V-)PCF stores the information received in step 1 and makes the policy
decision.
3\. The (V-)PCF responds to the AMF of the updated Access and Mobility related
policy control information as defined in clause 6.5 of TS 23.503 [20] and the
updated Policy Control Request Trigger parameters.
4\. The AMF deploys the access and mobility control policy, which includes
storing the Service Area Restrictions and Policy Control Request Trigger of AM
Policy Association, provisioning the Service Area Restrictions to the UE and
provisioning the RFSP index, UE-AMBR and Service Area Restrictions to the NG-
RAN as defined in TS 23.501 [2].
##### 4.16.2.1.2 AM Policy Association Modification with old PCF during AMF
relocation
This procedure is applicable to Case C. In this case, AMF relocation is
performed without PCF change in handover procedure and registration procedure.
Figure 4.16.2.1.2-1: AM Policy Association Modification with the old PCF
during AMF relocation
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the role of the V-PCF is performed by the PCF. For the
roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the AMF.:
1\. [Conditional] When the old AMF and the new AMF belong to the same PLMN,
the old AMF transfers to the new AMF about the AM Policy Association
information including policy control request trigger(s) and the PCF ID. For
the roaming case, the new AMF receives V-PCF ID.
2\. Based on local policies, the new AMF decides to establish UE Context with
the (V-)PCF and contacts the (Vâ€‘)PCF identified by the PCF ID received in step
1.
3\. The new AMF sends Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Update to the (V-)PCF to update the
AM policy association with the (V-)PCF. The request may include the following
information: policy control request trigger which has been met, Subscribed
Service Area Restrictions (if updated), subscribed RFSP index (if updated)
which are retrieved from the UDM during the update location procedure and may
include access type and RAT, PEI, ULI, UE time zone, service network. The
(V-)PCF updates the stored information provided by the old AMF with the
information provided by the new AMF.
4\. The (V-)PCF may update the policy decision based on the information
provided by the new AMF.
5\. The AMF deploys the access and mobility control policy, which includes
storing the Service Area Restrictions, provisioning Service Area Restrictions
to the UE and provisioning the RFSP index, UE-AMBR and Service Area
Restrictions to the NG-RAN.
#### 4.16.2.2 AM Policy Association Modification initiated by the PCF
This procedure is applicable to AM Policy Association modification due to Case
B.
Figure 4.16.2.2-1: AM Policy Association Modification initiated by the PCF
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the role of the V-PCF is performed by the PCF. For the
roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the AMF.
NOTE: The V-PCF stores the access and mobility control policy information
provided to the AMF.
1\. [Conditional] PCF determines locally that the new status of the UE context
requires new policies.
2\. The (V-)PCF makes a policy decision.
3\. The (V-)PCF sends Npcf_AMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify including AM Policy
Association ID associated with the SUPI defined in TS 29.507 [32], Service
Area Restrictions, UE-AMBR or RFSP index.
4\. The AMF deploys the Access and mobility related policy information, which
includes storing the Service Area Restrictions and Policy Control Request
Trigger of AM Policy Association, provisioning of the Service Area
Restrictions to the UE and provisioning the RFSP index, UE-AMBR and Service
Area Restrictions to the NG-RAN.
### 4.16.3 AM Policy Association Termination
#### 4.16.3.1 General
The following case is considered for AM Policy Association Termination:
1\. UE Deregistration from the network.
2\. The mobility with change of AMF (e.g. new AMF is in different PLMN or new
AMF in the same PLMN).
3\. [Optional] 5GS to EPS mobility with N26 if the UE is not connected to the
5GC over a non-3GPP access in the same PLMN.
#### 4.16.3.2 AMF-initiated AM Policy Association Termination
Figure 4.16.3.2-1: AMF-initiated AM Policy Association Termination
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the role of the V-PCF is performed by the PCF. For the
roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the AMF.
1\. The AMF decides to terminate the AM Policy Association during
Deregistration procedure or due to mobility with change of AMF and (V-)PCF in
the registration procedure or handover procedure, then if a AM Policy
Association was established with the (V-)PCF steps 2 to 3 are performed.
2\. The AMF sends the Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Delete service operation including
AM Policy Association ID to the (V-)PCF.
3\. The (V-)PCF removes the policy context for the UE and replies to the AMF
with an Acknowledgement including success or failure.
4\. The AMF removes the AM Policy Association for this UE, including the
Access and Mobility Control Policy related to the UE. The AMF deletes the
subscription to AMF detected events requested for that Policy Association.
#### 4.16.3.3 Void
### 4.16.4 SM Policy Association Establishment
Figure 4.16.4-1: SM Policy Association Establishment
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the V-PCF is not involved. In the local breakout
roaming case, the H-PCF is not involved. In the home routed roaming case, the
V-PCF is not involved and the H-PCF interacts with the H-SMF.
This procedure is used in UE requests a PDU Session Establishment as explained
in clause 4.3.2.2.1, for non-roaming and local breakout roaming. For home-
routed roaming, as explained in clause 4.3.2.2.2.
For local breakout roaming, the interaction with HPLMN (e.g. step 3) is not
used. In local breakout roaming, the V-PCF interacts with the UDR of the
VPLMN.
1\. The SMF determines that the PCC authorization is required and requests to
establish an SM Policy Association with the PCF by invoking
Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create operation, including information about the PDU
Session as specified in clause 5.2.5.4.2.
The SMF provides Trace Requirements to the PCF when it has received Trace
Requirements and it has selected a different PCF than the one received from
the AMF.
If the DNN Selection Mode indicates that the DNN is not explicitly subscribed,
the PCF may use the local configuration instead of PDU Session policy control
data in UDR.
The QoS constraints from the VPLMN are provided by the H-SMF to the H-PCF in
the home routed roaming scenario as defined in clause 4.3.2.2.2.
2\. If the PCF does not have the subscriber\'s subscription related
information, it sends a request to the UDR by invoking Nudr_DM_Query (SUPI,
DNN, S-NSSAI, Policy Data, PDU Session policy control data, Remaining allowed
Usage data) service in order to receive the information related to the PDU
Session. The PCF may request notifications from the UDR on changes in the
subscription information by invoking Nudr_DM_Subscribe (Policy Data, SUPI,
DNN, S-NSSAI, Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation Id),
Event Reporting Information (continuous reporting), PDU Session policy control
data, Remaining allowed Usage data) service.
3\. If the PCF determines that the policy decision depends on the status of
the policy counters available at the CHF and such reporting is not established
for the subscriber, the PCF initiates an Initial Spending Limit Report
Retrieval as defined in clause 4.16.8.2. If policy counter status reporting is
already established for the subscriber and the PCF determines that the status
of additional policy counters are required, the PCF initiates an Intermediate
Spending Limit Report Retrieval as defined in clause 4.16.8.3.
4\. The PCF makes the authorization and the policy decision. The PCF may
reject Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create request when Validation condition is not
satisfied. (see clause 6.1.2.4 of TS 23.503 [20]).
PCF may invoke Nbsf_Management_Register service operation to create the
binding information in BSF.
In the home-routed roaming scenario, the H-PCF ensures that the QoS
constraints provided by the VPLMN are taken into account as described in TS
23.503 [20].
5\. The PCF answers with a Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create response; in its
response the PCF may provide policy information defined in clause 5.2.5.4 (and
in TS 23.503 [20]). The SMF enforces the decision. The SMF implicitly
subscribes to changes in the policy decisions.
NOTE: After this step the PCF can subscribe to SMF events associated with the
PDU Session.
### 4.16.5 SM Policy Association Modification
#### 4.16.5.0 General
The following SM Policy Association Modification procedures concern both
roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the V-PCF is not involved. In the local breakout
roaming case, the H-PCF is not involved. In the home routed roaming case, the
V-PCF is not involved and the H-PCF interacts with the H-SMF.
The SM Policy Association Modification procedure may be initiated either by
the SMF or by the PCF.
#### 4.16.5.1 SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification
The SMF may initiate the SM Policy Association Modification procedure if a
Policy Control Request Trigger is met.
Figure 4.16.5.1-1: SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification
For local breakout roaming, the interaction with HPLMN (e.g. step 2) is not
used. In local breakout roaming, the V-PCF interacts with the UDR of the
VPLMN.
1\. When a Policy Control Request Trigger condition is met the SMF requests to
update (Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update) the SM Policy Association and provides
information on the conditions that have been met as specified in clause
5.2.5.4.5.
If the SMF is notified by NRF that the stored PCF instance is not reachable,
it should query the NRF for PCF instances within the PCF set and select
another instance (see clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501 [2]).
The QoS constraints from the VPLMN are provided by the H-SMF to the H-PCF in
the home routed roaming scenario as defined in clause 4.3.2.2.2.
2\. When an AF has subscribed to an event that is met due to the report from
the SMF, the PCF reports the event to the AF by invoking the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation.
When integration with TSN applies (see clause 5.28 of TS 23.501 [2]) and if
the SMF has reported that new 5GS Bridge information has been detected and no
AF session exists for this PDU session yet, then the PCF informs a pre-
configured TSN AF using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation
of 5GS Bridge information (e.g. 5GS Bridge ID, the port number of the DS-TT
Ethernet port and MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port for the PDU Session).
When the TSN AF receives the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify message over the
pre-configured AF session, the TSN AF shall use the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization
service described in clause 5.2.5.3 to request creation of a new AF session
specific to the received MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port. The TSN AF
shall then use the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service to subscribe for
notifications for 5GS Bridge information Notification event over the newly
established AF session.
If the SMF has reported UE-DS-TT Residence Time or PMIC with port number or
BMIC, then the PCF also provides these information elements to the TSN AF, the
TSN AF calculates the bridge delay for each port pair, i.e. composed of (DS-TT
Ethernet port, NW-TT Ethernet port), using the UE-DS-TT Residence Time for all
NW-TT Ethernet ports serving 5GS bridge indicated by the 5GS Bridge ID.
3\. If the PCF determines a change to policy counter status reporting is
required, it may alter the subscribed list of policy counters using the
Initial, Intermediate or Final Spending Limit Report Retrieval procedures as
defined in clause 4.16.8.
4\. The PCF makes a policy decision as described in TS 23.503 [20]. The PCF
may determine that updated or new policy information needs to be sent to the
SMF.
If the SMF reported accumulated usage for the PDU session in step 1 the PCF
deducts the value from the remaining allowed usage for the subscriber, DNN and
S-NSSAI in the UDR by invoking Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI, Policy
Data, Remaining allowed Usage data, updated data) service operation.
If the SMF reported accumulated usage for a MK(s) in step 1 the PCF deducts
the value from the remaining allowed usage for the MK in the UDR by invoking
Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI, Policy Data, Remaining allowed Usage data,
updated data (including MK(s))) service operation.
When new PCF instance is selected in step 1, the new PCF should invoke
Nbsf_Management_Update service operation to update the binding information in
BSF.
In the home-routed roaming scenario, the H-PCF ensures that the QoS
constraints provided by the VPLMN are taken into account as described in TS
23.503 [20].
5\. The PCF answers with a Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update response with updated
policy information about the PDU Session determined in step 4.
#### 4.16.5.2 PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification
The PCF may initiate SM Policy Association Modification procedure based on
local decision or triggered by other peers of the PCF (AF, CHF, UDR).
Figure 4.16.5.2-1: PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification
This procedure may be triggered by a local decision of the PCF or based on
triggers from other peers of the PCF (AF, CHF, UDR):
For local breakout roaming, the interaction with HPLMN (e.g. step 1b and step
2) is not used. In local breakout roaming, the V-PCF interacts with the UDR of
the VPLMN.
1a. Alternatively, optionally, the AF provides/revokes service information to
the PCF e.g. due to AF session signalling, by invoking
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create Request or Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update
Request service operation. The PCF responds to the AF.
1b. Alternatively, optionally, the CHF provides a Spending Limit Report to the
PCF as described in clause 4.16.8. and responds to the CHF.
1c Alternatively, optionally, the UDR notifies the PCF about a policy
subscription change by invoking Nudr_DM_Notify (Notification correlation Id,
Policy Data, SUPI, updated data, \"PDU Session Policy Control Data\" \|
\"Remaining allowed Usage data\"); The PCF responds to the UDR.
1d Alternatively, optionally, some internal event (e.g. timer, or local
decision based on information received from NWDAF) occurs at the PCF.
2\. If the PCF determines a change to policy counter status reporting is
required, it may alter the subscribed list of policy counters using the
Initial, Intermediate or Final Spending Limit Report Retrieval procedures as
defined in clause 4.16.8.
NOTE: The PCF ensures that information received in step 1 and 2 can be used by
later policy decisions.
3\. The PCF makes a policy decision. The PCF may determine that updated or new
policy information need to be sent to the SMF.
If the AF provided a Background Data Transfer Reference ID in step 1a, the PCF
may retrieve it from the UDR by invoking the Nudr_DM_Query (BDT Reference Id,
Policy Data, Background Data Transfer) service.
4\. If the PCF has determined that SMF needs updated policy information in
step 3 or if the PCF has received a Port Management Information Container, MAC
address reported for the PDU Session and related port number from the AF in
Step 1a, the PCF issues a Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request with
possibly updated policy information about the PDU Session.
5\. The SMF acknowledges the PCF request with a
Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify response.
If the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request is received from new PCF
instance in the PCF Set, the SMF store the SM policy association towards the
new PCF instance.
### 4.16.6 SM Policy Association Termination
Figure 4.16.6-1: SM Policy Association Termination
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the V-PCF is not involved. In the local breakout
roaming case, the H-PCF is not involved. In the home routed roaming case, the
V-PCF is not involved and the H-PCF interacts only with the H-SMF.
The procedure for Session Management Policy Termination may be initiated by:
\- (Case A) the PCF.
\- (Case B) the SMF.
For local breakout roaming, the interaction with HPLMN (e.g. step 6) is not
used. In local breakout roaming, the V-PCF interacts with the UDR of the
VPLMN.
1\. (Case A) The PCF may invoke the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service
operation to request the release of a PDU Session. The SMF acknowledges the
request.
The rest of the procedure corresponds to both Case A &B.
2\. The SMF may invoke the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Delete service operation to
request the deletion of the SM Policy Association with the PCF. The SMF
provides relevant information to the PCF.
3\. When receiving the request from step2, the PCF finds the PCC Rules that
require an AF to be notified and removes PCC Rules for the PDU Session.
If the SMF reported accumulated usage for the PDU session in step 1 the PCF
deducts the value from the remaining allowed usage for the subscriber, DNN and
S-NSSAI in the UDR by invoking Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI, Policy
Data, Remaining allowed Usage data, updated data) service operation.
If the SMF reported accumulated usage for a MK(s) in step 1 the PCF deducts
the value from the remaining allowed usage for the MK in the UDR by invoking
Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI, Policy Data, Remaining allowed Usage data,
updated data (including MK(s))) service operation.
4\. The SMF removes all policy information about the PDU Session associated
with the PDU Session.
5\. The PCF notifies the AF as explained in clause 7.3.1 steps 6-7 of TS
23.203 [24].
PCF may invoke Nbsf_Management_Deregister service operation to delete the
binding created in BSF.
6\. The PCF may invoke the procedure defined in clause 4.16.8 to unsubscribe
to policy counter status reporting (If this is the last PDU Session for this
subscriber requiring policy counter status reporting) or to modify the
subscription to policy counter status reporting, (if any remaining existing
PDU Sessions for this subscriber requires policy counter status reporting).
7\. The PCF removes the information related to the terminated PDU Session and
acknowledges to the SMF that the PCF handling of the PDU Session has
terminated. This interaction is the response to the SMF request in step 2.
8\. The PCF may (e.g. if it is the last PDU Session on the (DNN, S-NSSAI)
couple) unsubscribe to the notification of the PDU Session related data
modification from the UDR by invoking Nudr_DM_Unsubscribe (Subscription
Correlation Id) if it had subscribed such notification.
### 4.16.7 Negotiations for future background data transfer
#### 4.16.7.1 General
The procedure for future background data transfer as specified in clause
4.16.7.2 enables the negotiation between the NEF and the H-PCF about the
transfer policies for the future background data transfer (as described in
clause 6.1.2.4 of TS 23.503 [20]). The transfer policies consist of a desired
time window for the background data transfer, a reference to a charging rate
for the time window, network area information and optionally a maximum
aggregated bitrate, as described in clause 6.1.2.4 of TS 23.503 [20].
This negotiation is preliminarily conducted (when AF initiates a procedure to
NEF) before the UE\'s PDU Session establishment. When the AF wants to apply
the Background Data Transfer Policy to an existing PDU Session, then at the
time the background data transfer is about to start the AF invokes the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service directly with PCF, or via the NEF, to
apply the background data transfer policy for an individual UE. When the AF
wants to apply the Background Data Transfer Policy to a future PDU Session,
then the AF invokes Nnef_ApplyPolicy_Create service to provide, to the NEF,
the Background Data Transfer Reference ID together with the External
Identifier or External Group Identifier of the UE(s) that are subject to the
policy.
The procedure for BDT warning notification as specified in clause 4.16.7.3
enables the PCF to notify the AF that the network performance in the area of
interest goes below the criteria set by the operator as described in clause
6.1.2.4 of TS 23.503 [20].
#### 4.16.7.2 Procedures for future background data transfer
Figure 4.16.7.2-1: Negotiation for future background data transfer
1\. The AF invokes the Nnef_BDTPNegotiation_Create (ASP id, Number of UEs,
Volume per UE, Desired time window and optionally External Group Identifier,
Network Area Information, Request for notification, MAC address or IP 3-tuple
of Application server). The Request for notification is an indication that BDT
warning notification should be sent to the AF.
2a. Based on an AF request, the NEF requests to translate the External Group
Identifier into the Internal Group Identifier using Nudm_SDM_Get (Group
Identifier Translation, External Group Identifier).
2b. The NEF invokes the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Create (ASP id, Number of UEs,
Volume per UE, Desired time window and optionally Internal Group Identifier,
the Network Area Information, Request for notification, MAC address or IP
3-tuple of Application server) with the H-PCF to authorize the creation of the
policy regarding the background data transfer. If the PCF was provided with
Request for notification, then PCF may send BDT warning notification to the AF
as described in clause 4.16.7.3.
3 The H-PCF may request from the UDR the stored Background Data Transfer
policies for all the ASPs using Nudr_DM_Query (Policy Data, Background Data
Transfer) service operation.
NOTE 1: If only one PCF is deployed in the PLMN, the Background Data Transfer
policy can be locally stored and no interaction with UDR is required.
4\. The UDR provides all the stored Background Data Transfer policies and
corresponding related information (i.e. volume of data to be transferred per
UE, the expected amount of UEs) to the H-PCF.
5\. The H-PCF determines, based on information provided by the AF and other
available information one or more Background Data Transfer policies. The PCF
may interact with the NWDAF and request the Network Performance analytics
information for the Desired time window and the Network Area Information as
defined in TS 23.288 [50].
NOTE 2: When the External Group Identifier was provided and the Network Area
Information was not provided by the AF at step 1, the NWDAF derives the
Network Area Information from the Internal Group ID as defined in clause 6.6
of TS 23.288 [50].
NOTE 3: The maximum aggregated bitrate is not enforced in the network.
6\. The H-PCF send the acknowledge message to the NEF with the acceptable
Background Data T Transfer policies and a Background Data Transfer Reference
ID.
7\. The NEF sends a Nnef_BDTPNegotiation_Create response to the AF to provide
one or more background data transfer policies and the Background Data Transfer
Reference ID to the AF. The AF stores the Background Data Transfer Reference
ID for the future interaction with the PCF. If the NEF received only one
background data transfer policy from the PCF, steps 8-11 are not executed and
the flow proceeds to step 12. Otherwise, the flow proceeds to step 8.
NOTE 4: If the NEF receives only one Background Data T Transfer policy, the AF
is not required to confirm.
8\. The AF invokes the Nnef_BDTPNegotiation_Update service to provide the NEF
with Background Data Transfer Reference ID and the selected background data
transfer policy.
9\. The NEF invokes the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Update service to provide the
H-PCF with the selected background data transfer policy and the associated
Background Data Transfer Reference ID.
10\. The H-PCF sends the acknowledge message to the NEF.
11\. The NEF sends the acknowledge message to the AF.
12\. The H-PCF stores the Background Data Transfer Reference ID together with
the new Background Data T Transfer policy, the corresponding related
information (i.e. volume of data to be transferred per UE, the expected amount
of UEs), optionally MAC address or IP 3-tuple of Application server the
information of request for notification, together with the relevant
information received from the AF (as defined in clause 6.1.2.4 of TS 23.503
[20]) in the UDR by invoking Nudr_DM_Update (BDT Reference id, Policy Data,
Background Data Transfer). This step is not executed, when the PCF decides to
locally store the Background Data Transfer policy.
13\. The UDR sends a response to the H-PCF as its acknowledgement.
#### 4.16.7.3 Procedure for BDT warning notification
Figure 4.16.7.3-1: The procedure for BDT warning notification
1\. The negotiation for Background Data Transfer (BDT) described in clause
4.16.7.2 is completed. In addition, the PCF has subscribed to analytics on
\"Network Performance\" from NWDAF for the area of interest and time window of
a background data transfer policy following the procedure and services
described in TS 23.288 [50], including a Reporting Threshold in the Analytics
Reporting information. The value for Reporting Threshold is set by the PCF
based on operator configuration.
2\. The PCF is notified with the network performance analytics in the area of
interest from the NWDAF when the NWDAF determines that the network performance
goes below the threshold as described for the Network Performance analytics in
TS 23.288 [50].
3\. The H-PCF may request from the UDR the stored BDT policies using
Nudr_DM_Query (Policy Data, Background Data Transfer) service operation.
4\. The UDR provides all the Background Transfer Policies together with the
relevant information received from the AF (as defined in clause 6.1.2.4 of TS
23.503 [20]) to the H-PCF.
5\. The H-PCF identifies the BDT policies affected by the notification
received from NWDAF. For each of them, the H-PCF determines the ASP of which
the background traffic will be influenced by the degradation of network
performance and which requested the H-PCF to send the notification. The PCF
then performs the following steps for each of the determined ASPs, i.e. Steps
6 - 16 can occur multiple times (i.e. once per ASP).
6\. The PCF decides based on operator policies, whether a new list of
candidate Background Data Transfer policies can be calculated for the ASP. If
the PCF does not find any new candidate BDT policy, the previously negotiated
BDT policy shall be kept, no interaction with that ASP shall occur and the
procedure stops for that BDT policy.
NOTE 1: The BDT policies of an ASP which did not request to be notified are
kept and no interaction with this ASP occurs.
7\. The PCF sets the no longer valid BDT policy in the UDR as invalidated by
invoking Nudr_DM_Update (Background Data Transfer Reference ID, invalidation
flag) service.
NOTE 2: The BDT policies that are applicable for future sessions are checked
by the PCF in step 6.
8\. The UDR sends a response to the H-PCF as acknowledgement.
9\. The PCF sends the notification to the NEF by invoking
Npcf_PolicyControl_Notify (Background Data Transfer Reference ID, list of
candidate Background Data Transfer policies) service operation.
10\. The NEF sends the BDT warning notification to the AF by invoking
Nnef_BDTPNegotiation_Notify (Background Data Transfer Reference ID, list of
candidate Background Data Transfer policies) service operation.
11\. The AF checks the new Background Data Transfer policies included in the
candidate list in the BDT warning notification.
12\. If the AF selects any of the new Background Data Transfer policies, the
steps 8-13 from clause 4.16.7.2 are executed.
13\. If the AF doesn\'t select any of the new Background Data Transfer
policies, the steps 8-11 from clause 4.16.7.2 are executed, with the AF
indicating that none of the candidate Background Data Transfer policies is
acceptable.
14.-15. If the step 13 is executed, the PCF removes the no longer valid BDT
policy from UDR for the corresponding Background Data Transfer Reference ID.
NOTE 3: The PCF can also remove the no longer valid BDT policy after an
operator configurable time for the case that the AF does not respond.
16\. If there is a new Background Data Transfer policy stored in the UDR or a
BDT policy removed from the UDR, the PCFs are notified by the UDR accordingly.
The PCFs check if the corresponding URSP rules need to be updated or removed
and if so, use the procedure defined in clause 4.16.12.2 to update URSP rules
for the relevant UEs.
The AF can send a Stop notification by invoking Nnef_BDTPNegotiation_Update
service, when the AF requests not to receive the BDT warning notification
anymore. Then, the NEF invokes Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Update service in order
to provide this information for the H-PCF.
### 4.16.8 Procedures on interaction between PCF and CHF
#### 4.16.8.1 General
The PCF may interact with the CHF to make PCC decisions based on spending
limits. In Home Routed roaming and Non-roaming case, the H-PCF will interact
with the CHF in HPLMN.
#### 4.16.8.2 Initial Spending Limit Retrieval
This clause describes the signalling flow for the PCF to retrieve the status
of the policy counters available at the CHF and to subscribe to spending limit
reporting (i.e. to notifications of policy counter status changes) by the CHF.
If the PCF provides the list of policy counter identifier(s), the CHF returns
the policy counter status per policy counter identifier provided by the PCF.
If the PCF does not provide the list of policy counter identifier(s), the CHF
returns the policy counter status of all policy counter(s), which are
available for this subscriber.
The Initial Spending Limit Report Retrieval includes all subscriber
Identifiers associated with the UE available at the PCF.
NOTE: If the CHF returns the status of all available policy counters some of
these might not be relevant for a policy decision (e.g. those used in a policy
decision only when roaming).
Figure 4.16.8.2.1: Initial Spending Limit Report Retrieval
1\. The PCF retrieves subscription information that indicates that policy
decisions depend on the status of policy counter(s) held at the CHF and
optionally the list of policy counter identifier(s).
2\. The PCF sends Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Subscribe if this is the first
time policy counter status information is requested for the user identified by
a SUPI. It includes: the subscriber ID (e.g. SUPI), the EventId \"policy
counter status change\" and, optionally, the list of policy counter
identifier(s) as Event Filter, the Notification Target Address, Event
Reporting Information (continuous reporting).
The CHF responds to the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Subscribe service operation
including the Subscription Correlation Id) and as Event Information provides a
policy counter status and optionally pending policy counter statuses and their
activation times, per required policy counter identifier and stores the PCF\'s
subscription to spending limit reports for these policy counters. If no policy
counter identifier(s) was provided the CHF returns the list of the policy
counter status, optionally including pending policy counter statuses and their
activation times, for all policy counter(s), which are available for this
subscriber and stores the PCF\'s subscription to spending limit reports of all
policy counters provided to the PCF.
#### 4.16.8.3 Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval
This clause describes the signalling flow for the PCF to retrieve the status
of additional policy counters available at the CHF or to unsubscribe from
spending limit reporting. If the PCF provides the list of policy counter
identifier(s), the CHF returns the policy counter status per policy counter
identifier provided by the PCF.
NOTE: If the CHF returns the status of all available policy counters some of
these might not be relevant for a policy decision, (e.g. those used in a
policy decision only when roaming).
Figure 4.16.8.3.1: Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval
1\. The PCF determines that policy decisions depend on the status of
additional policy counter(s) held at the CHF or that notifications of policy
counter status changes for some policy counters are no longer required.
2\. The PCF sends Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Subscribe to the CHF, including
the Subscription Correlation Id, the EventId \"policy counter status change\"
and an updated list of policy counter identifier(s) as EventFilters, that
overrides the previously stored list of policy counter identifier(s).
The CHF responds to the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Subscribe service operation
and provides as Event Information the policy counter status and optionally
pending policy counter statuses and their activation times, per required
policy counter identifier and stores or removes the PCF\'s subscription to
spending limit reporting by comparing the updated list with the existing PCF
subscriptions. If no policy counter identifier(s) was provided, the CHF
returns the policy counter status, optionally including pending policy counter
statuses and their activation times, for all policy counter(s), which are
available for this subscriber and stores the PCF\'s subscription to spending
limit reports of all policy counters provided to the PCF.
#### 4.16.8.4 Final Spending Limit Report Retrieval
This clause describes the signalling flow for the PCF to cancel the
subscriptions to status changes for the policy counters available at the CHF.
Figure 4.16.8.4.1: Final Spending Limit Report Retrieval
1\. The PCF decides that notifications of policy counter status changes are no
longer needed.
2\. The PCF sends Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Unsubscribe including the
SubscriptionCorrelationId to the CHF to cancel the subscription to
notifications of policy counter status changes from the CHF.
3\. The CHF removes the PCF\'s subscription to spending limit reporting and
responds to the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Unsubscribe service operation to the
PCF.
#### 4.16.8.5 Spending Limit Report
This clause describes the signalling flow for the CHF to notify the change of
the status of the subscribed policy counters available at the CHF for that
subscriber. Alternatively, the signalling flow can be used by the CHF to
provide one or more pending statuses for a subscribed policy counter together
with the time they have to be applied.
Figure 4.16.8.5.1: Spending Limit Report
1\. The CHF detects that the status of a policy counter(s) has changed and the
PCF subscribed to notifications of changes in the status of this policy
counter. Alternatively, the CHF may detect that a policy counter status will
change at a future point in time and decides to instruct the PCF to apply one
or more pending statuses for a requested policy counter.
2\. The CHF sends Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Notify with the SUPI, Notification
Target Address and in the Event Information the policy counter status and
optionally pending policy counter statuses and their activation times, for
each policy counter that has changed and for which the PCF subscribed to
spending limit reporting. Alternatively, the CHF sends one or more pending
statuses for any of the subscribed policy counters together with the time they
have to be applied.
3\. The PCF acknowledges sending Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Notify response and
takes that information into account as input for a policy decision.
#### 4.16.8.6 CHF report the removal of the subscriber
This clause describes the signalling flow for the CHF to report the removal of
the subscriber.
Figure 4.16.8.6-1: CHF report the removal of the subscriber
1\. The CHF decides that a subscriber is removed.
2\. The CHF sends the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Notify Request to H-PCF to
notify the removal of the subscriber. The H-PCF removes the subscription to
notification of policy counter status from CHF.
NOTE: Notification on the removing of a subscriber causes the H-PCF to make
the applicable policy decision and act accordingly.
3\. The H-PCF responds to CHF using Nchf_SpendingLimitControl_Notify to
acknowledge the receiving of the notification.
### 4.16.9 Update of the subscription information in the PCF
Figure-4.16.9-1: Procedure for update of the subscription information in the
PCF
NOTE: The V-PCF is not used for session management related policy decisions in
this procedure.
0\. The PCF performs the subscription to notification to the profile modified
in the UDR by invoking Nudr_DM_Subscribe (Policy Data, SUPI, Notification
Target Address (+ Notification Correlation Id), Event Reporting Information
(continuous reporting), one or several of the following: \"PDU Session Policy
Control data\", \"Remaining allowed Usage data\" or \"UE context Policy
Control data\") service.
1\. The UDR detects that the related subscription profile has been changed.
2\. If subscribed by the PCF, the UDR notifies the PCF on the changed profile
by invoking Nudr_DM_Notify (Notification Correlation Id, Policy Data, SUPI,
updated data and one or several of the following data subtypes \"PDU Session
Policy Control Data\" or \"Remaining allowed Usage data\" or \"UE Context
Policy Control data\") service.
3\. The PCF stores the updated profile.
4\. If the updated subscriber profile requires the status of new policy
counters available at the CHF then an Initial/Intermediate Spending Limit
Report Retrieval is initiated by the PCF as defined in clauses 4.16.8,2 and
4.16.8.3. If the updated subscriber profile implies that no policy counter
status is needed an Intermediate Spending Limit Report Request Retrieval is
initiated by the PCF to unsubscribe or, if this is the last policy counter
status, a Final Spending Limit Report Retrieval is initiated by the PCF as
specified in clause 4.16.8.4.
5\. PCF makes an authorization and policy decision.
6\. The PCF provides new session management related policy decisions to the
SMF, using the Policy related interaction in PDU Session Modification
procedure in clause 4.16.6, new access and mobility related policy information
to the AMF using the AM Policy Association Modification procedure in clause
4.16.2 or new UE policy information to the AMF using the UE Policy Association
Modification procedure in clause 4.16.12.
### 4.16.10 Void
### 4.16.11 UE Policy Association Establishment
This procedure concerns the following scenarios:
1\. UE initial registration with the network.
2\. The AMF relocation with PCF change in handover procedure and registration
procedure.
3\. UE registration with 5GS when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS and there is no
existing UE Policy Association between AMF and PCF for this UE.
Figure 4.16.11-1: UE Policy Association Establishment
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the V-PCF is not involved and the role of the H-PCF is
performed by the PCF. For the roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the
AMF and the H-PCF interacts with the V-PCF:
1\. The AMF establishes UE Policy Association with the (V-)PCF when a UE
Policy Container is received from the UE. If a UE Policy Container is not
received from the UE, the AMF may establish UE Policy Association with the
(V-)PCF based on AMF local configuration.
NOTE 1: In roaming scenario, the AMF local configuration can indicate whether
UE Policy delivery is needed based on the roaming agreement with home PLMN of
the UE.
2\. The AMF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Request with the following
information: SUPI, may include Access Type and RAT, PEI, ULI, UE time zone,
Serving Network (PLMN ID, or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.34 of TS 23.501
[2]), the Internal-Group-ID-list and UE Policy Container (the list of stored
PSIs, operating system identifier, Indication of UE support for ANDSP). In
roaming scenario, based on operator policies, the AMF may provide to the V-PCF
the PCF ID of the selected H-PCF. The V-PCF contacts the H-PCF. In roaming
case, steps 3 and 4 are executed, otherwise step 5 follows.
3\. The V-PCF forwards the information received from AMF in step 2 to the
H-PCF. When a UE Policy Container is received at initial registration, the
H-PCF may store the PEI, the OSId or the indication of UE support for ANDSP in
the UDR using Nudr_DM_Create including DataSet \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset
\"UE context policy control data\".
4\. The H-PCF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response to the V-PCF. The
H-PCF may provide the Policy Control Request Trigger parameters in the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response.
5\. The (V-) PCF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response to the AMF. The
(V-)PCF relays the Policy Control Request Trigger parameters in the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response.
The (V-)PCF also subscribes to notification of N1 message delivery of policy
information to the UE using Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageSubscribe service
which is not shown in this figure.
6\. The (H-)PCF gets policy subscription related information and the latest
list of PSIs from the UDR using Nudr_DM_Query service operation (SUPI, Policy
Data, UE context policy control data, Policy Set Entry) if either or both are
not available and makes a policy decision. The (H-)PCF may get the PEI, the
OSId or the indication of UE support for ANDSP in the UDR using Nudr_DM_Query
including DataSet \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"UE context policy control
data\" if the AMF relocates and the PCF changes. The (H-)PCF may get the 5G VN
group data and 5G VN group membership for each Internal-Group-ID received from
the AMF using Nudr_DM_Query (Internal-Group-Id, Subscription Data, 5G VN Group
Configuration). The (H-)PCF may store the 5G VN group data and 5G VN group
membership for later use for other SUPIs that belong to the same Internal-
Group-ID. The (H-)PCF may request notifications from the UDR on changes in the
subscription information by invoking Nudr_DM_Subscribe (Policy Data, SUPI,
DNN, S-NSSAI, Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation Id),
Event Reporting Information (continuous reporting), UE context policy control
data) service. The (H-)PCF may request notifications from the UDR on changes
in the 5G VN group data or 5G VN group membership associated to each of the
Internal-Group-Id provided to the PCF by invoking Nudr_DM_Subscribe
(Subscription Data, 5G VN Group Configuration, Internal Group ID, Notification
Target Address (+ Notification Correlation Id), Event Reporting Information
(continuous reporting)) service. The (H-)PCF creates the UE policy container
including UE policy information as defined in clause 6.6 of TS 23.503 [20] and
in the case of roaming H-PCF provides the UE policy container in the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl UpdateNotify Request.
7\. The V-PCF sends a response to H-PCF using Npcf_UEPolicyControl
UpdateNotify Response.
NOTE 2: Step 6 (and step 7) can be omitted. Then the (H-)PCF creates the UE
policy container including UE polices in step 2 (in the case of non-roaming)
or step 3 (in the case of roaming). This means that the potential interactions
with UDR as in step 6 will have to be executed in step 2 (non-roaming) or step
3 (roaming).
8\. The (V-)PCF triggers UE Configuration Update Procedure in clause 4.2.4.3
to sends the UE policy container including UE policy information to the UE.
The (V-)PCF checks the size limit as described in clause 6.1.2.2.2 of TS
23.503 [20].
9\. If the V-PCF received notification of the reception of the UE Policy
container then the V-PCF forwards the notification response of the UE to the
H-PCF using Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Update Request.
10\. The H-PCF sends a response to the V-PCF.
### 4.16.12 UE Policy Association Modification
#### 4.16.12.1 UE Policy Association Modification initiated by the AMF
##### 4.16.12.1.1 UE Policy Association Modification initiated by the AMF
without AMF relocation
This procedure addresses the scenario where a Policy Control Request Trigger
condition is met.
Figure 4.16.12.1.1-1: UE Policy Association Modification initiated by the AMF
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the V-PCF is not involved. In the roaming case, the
AMF interacts with the V-PCF and the H-PCF interacts with the V-PCF.
1\. When a Policy Control Request Trigger condition is met the AMF updates UE
Policy Control Association and provides information on the conditions that
have changed to the PCF. The AMF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Update Request
with the following information: UE Policy Association ID associated with the
SUPI defined in TS 29.525 [58] and the Policy Control Request Trigger met. In
roaming scenario, based on operator policies, the AMF may provide to the V-PCF
the PCF ID of the selected H-PCF. The V-PCF contacts the H-PCF.
See clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 29.525 [58] for more details on Policy Control
Request Trigger.
In the roaming case, steps 2 and 3 are executed, otherwise step 4 follows.
2\. The V-PCF forwards the information received from AMF in step 1 to the
(H-)PCF.
3\. The H-PCF replies to the V-PCF.
4\. The (V-) PCF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Update Response to the AMF.
5\. The (H-)PCF may create the UE policy container including UE policy
information as defined in clause 6.6 of TS 23.503 [20]. In the case of roaming
the H-PCF may include the UE policy container in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl
UpdateNotify Request.
6\. The (V-)PCF sends a response to H-PCF using Npcf_UEPolicyControl
UpdateNotify Response.
Steps 7, 8 and 9 are the same as steps 8, 9 and 10 of procedure UE Policy
Association Establishment in clause 4.16.11.
##### 4.16.12.1.2 UE Policy Association Modification with old PCF during AMF
relocation
This procedure addresses the scenario where a UE Policy Association
Modification with the old PCF during AMF relocation.
Figure 4.16.12.1.2-1: Policy Association Modification with the old PCF during
AMF relocation
This procedure addresses both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the V-PCF is not involved. In the roaming case, the
AMF interacts with the V-PCF and the V-PCF interacts with the H-PCF.
1\. [Conditional] When the old AMF and the new AMF belong to the same PLMN,
the old AMF transfers to the new AMF the UE Policy Association information
including policy control request trigger(s) and the PCF ID(s). For the roaming
case, the new AMF receives both V-PCF ID and H-PCF ID.
2\. Based on local policies, the new AMF decides to re-use the UE policy
association for the UE Context with the (V-)PCF and contacts the (V)-PCF
identified by the PCF ID received in step 1.
NOTE: The scenario that only the H-PCF is reused by the new AMF but the V-PCF
is not reused is not considered in this Release.
3\. The new AMF sends Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Update to the (V-)PCF to update the
UE policy association with the (V-)PCF. If a Policy Control Request Trigger
condition is met, the information matching the trigger condition may also be
provided by the new AMF.
In the roaming case, step 4 and 5 are executed, otherwise step 6 follows.
4\. The V-PCF forwards the information received from new AMF in step 3 to the
(H-)PCF.
5\. The H-PCF replies to the V-PCF.
6\. The (V-)PCF updates the stored information provided by the old AMF with
the information provided by the new AMF. The (V-)PCF sends a
Npcf_UEPolicyControl Update Response to the AMF.
7\. The (H-)PCF may create the UE policy container including UE policy
information as defined in clause 6.6 of TS 23.503 [20]. In the case of roaming
the H-PCF may include the UE policy container in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl
UpdateNotify Request.
8\. The V-PCF sends a response to H-PCF using Npcf_UEPolicyControl
UpdateNotify Response.
Steps 9, 10 and 11 are the same as steps 8, 9 and 10 of procedure UE Policy
Association Establishment in clause 4.16.11.
#### 4.16.12.2 UE Policy Association Modification initiated by the PCF
This procedure is used to update UE policy and/or UE policy triggers.
Figure 4.16.12.2-1: UE Policy Association Modification initiated by the PCF
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case the V-PCF is not involved and the role of the H-PCF is
performed by the PCF. In the roaming case, the H-PCF provides UE policy
decision and provides the policy to the AMF via V-PCF.
1a and 1b. If (H-)PCF subscribed to notification of subscriberÂ´s policy data
change or 5G VN Group Configuration (5G VN group data, 5G VN group membership)
change and a change is detected, the UDR notifies that the subscriberÂ´s policy
data of a UE or 5G VN Group Configuration (5G VN group data, 5G VN group
membership) has been changed.
The UDR notifies the (H-)PCF of the updated policy control subscription
information profile via Nudr_DM_Notify (Notification correlation Id, Policy
Data, either UE context policy control data or Policy Set Entry data or both,
SUPI), or
The UDR notifies the (H-)PCF of the updated 5G VN Group Configuration (5G VN
group data, 5G VN group membership) via Nudr_DM_Notify (Notification
correlation Id, 5G VN Group Configuration, Internal-Group-Identifier), or
The (V-)UDR notifies the (V-)PCF of the updated policy control subscription
information profile via Nudr_DM_Notify (Notification correlation Id, Policy
Data, PolicySetEntry Data. PLMN ID).
1c and 1d. PCF determines locally that UE policy information needs to be sent
to the UE.
2a and 2b. The PCF makes the policy decision. If the group data is updated,
the (H-) PCF checks the UE Policy Associations for those SUPIs within the
Internal-Group-Id and may need to perform step 3 to step 9 for each UE Policy
Association that needs to be updated with new UE Policies sent to each UE.
3\. The (H-)PCF may create the UE policy container including UE policy
information as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.2 of TS 23.503 [20]. In the case of
roaming, the H-PCF may send the UE policy container in the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl UpdateNotify Request. The H-PCF may provide updated
policy control triggers for the UE policy association.
4\. The V-PCF sends a response to H-PCF using Npcf_UEPolicyControl
UpdateNotify Response.
5\. The (V-)PCF provides the Policy Control Request Trigger parameters in the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl UpdateNotify Request to the AMF. In the case of roaming,
the V-PCF may also provide UE policy information to the UE. The V-PCF may also
provide updated policy control triggers for the UE policy association to the
AMF.
6\. The AMF sends a response to (V-)PCF.
Steps 7, 8 and 9 are the same as steps 8, 9 and 10 of procedure UE Policy
Association Establishment in clause 4.16.11.
### 4.16.13 UE Policy Association Termination
#### 4.16.13.1 AMF-initiated UE Policy Association Termination
The following case is considered for UE Policy Association Termination:
1\. UE Deregistration from the network.
2\. The mobility with change of AMF (e.g. new AMF is in different PLMN or new
AMF in the same PLMN).
3\. [Optional] 5GS to EPS mobility with N26 if the UE is not connected to the
5GC over a non-3GPP access in the same PLMN.
Figure 4.16.13.1-1: AMF-initiated UE Policy Association Termination
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case, the V-PCF is not involved and the role of the H-PCF
is performed by the PCF. For the roaming scenarios, the V PCF interacts with
the AMF. The V PCF contacts the H-PCF to request removing UE Policy
Association.
1\. The AMF decides to terminate the UE Policy Association.
2\. The AMF sends the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Delete service operation including
UE Policy Association ID to the (V-)PCF.
3\. The (V-)PCF removes the policy context for the UE and replies to the AMF
with an Acknowledgement including success or failure. The V-PCF may interact
with the H-PCF. The (V-)PCF may unsubscribe to subscriber policy data changes
with UDR by Nudr_DM_Unsubscribe (Subscription Correlation Id). The AMF removes
the UE Policy Context.
Step 4 and Step 5 apply only to the roaming case.
4\. The V-PCF sends the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Delete service operation
including UE Policy Association ID to the H-PCF.
5\. The H-PCF removes the policy context for the UE and replies to the V-PCF
with an Acknowledgement including success or failure. The H-PCF may
unsubscribe to subscriber policy data changes with UDR by Nudr_DM_Unsubscribe
(Subscription Correlation Id) for subscriber policy changes.
#### 4.16.13.2 PCF-initiated UE Policy Association Termination
Figure 4.16.13.2-1: PCF-initiated UE Policy Association Termination
This procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.
In the non-roaming case, the V-PCF is not involved and the role of the H-PCF
is performed by the PCF. For the roaming scenarios, the H-PCF interacts with
the V-PCF to request removing Policy Association.
The PCF is subscribed to notification of changes in Data Set \"Policy Data\"
for a UE Policy Association ID.
1\. The Policy data is removed, either the Data Set \"Policy Data\" or the
Data Subset \"UE context policy control\".
2\. The UDR sends the Nudr_DM_Notify_Request (Notification correlation Id,
Policy Data, SUPI, UE Context Policy Control data, updated data) including the
SUPI, the Data Set Identifier, the Data Subset Identifier and the Updated Data
including empty \"Policy Data\" or empty \"UE context policy control\".
3\. The PCF sends the Nudr_DM_Notify_Response to confirm reception and the
result to UDR.
4\. The PCF may notify the AMF of the removal of the UE Policy Association via
Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service operation. Alternatively, the PCF
may decide to maintain the Policy Association if a default profile is applied,
in this case steps 4, 5 and 6 are not executed.
5\. The AMF acknowledges the operation.
6\. Steps 2-5 in clause 4.16.13.1 AMF-initiated UE Policy Association
Termination are performed to remove the UE Policy Association for this UE and
the subscription to Policy Control Request Triggers for that UE Policy
Association.
## 4.17 Network Function Service Framework Procedure
### 4.17.1 NF service Registration
NOTE 1: The term \"NF service consumer\" in this clause refers to the consumer
of the NRF services and should not be confused with the role of the NF
(consumer or producer).
Figure 4.17.1-1: NF Service Registration procedure
1\. NF service consumer, i. e. an NF instance sends
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister Request message to NRF to inform the NRF of its
NF profile when the NF service consumer becomes operative for the first time.
See clause 5.2.7.2.2 for relevant NF profile parameters
NOTE 2: NF service consumer\'s NF profile is configured by OAM system.
2\. The NRF stores the NF profile of NF service consumer and marks the NF
service consumer available.
NOTE 3: Whether the NF profile sent by NF service consumer to NRF needs to be
integrity protected by the NF service consumer and verified by the NRF is to
be decided by SA3.
3\. The NRF acknowledge NF Registration is accepted via
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister response.
### 4.17.2 NF service update
Figure 4.17.2-1: NF Service Update procedure
1\. NF service consumer i.e. an NF instance sends Nnrf_NFManagement_NFUpdate
Request message (the updated NF profile of NF service consumer) to NRF to
inform the NRF of its updated NF profile (e.g. with updated capacity) when
e.g. triggered after a scaling operation. See clause 5.2.7.2.3 for relevant
input and output parameters.
NOTE: The updated NF profile of NF instance are configured by OAM system.
2\. The NRF updates the NF profile of NF service consumer.
3\. The NRF acknowledge NF Update is accepted via Nnrf_NFManagement_NFUpdate
response.
NOTE 4: When the NF service consumer registers to NRF via the SCP, the NF
Service registration procedure can also be used by the SCP to derive the
relation among NF instances, e.g. whether they belong to a specific NF Set.
### 4.17.3 NF service deregistration
Figure 4.17.3-1: NF Service Deregistration procedure
1\. NF service consumer i.e. an NF instance sends
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFDeregister Request message to NRF to inform the NRF of its
unavailability when e.g. it\'s about to gracefully shut down or disconnect
from the network.
2\. The NRF marks the NF service consumer unavailable. NRF may remove the NF
profile of NF service consumer according to NF management policy.
3\. The NRF acknowledge NF Deregistration is accepted via
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFDeregister response.
### 4.17.4 NF/NF service discovery by NF service consumer in the same PLMN
Figure 4.17.4-1: NF/NF service discovery in the same PLMN
1\. The NF service consumer intends to discover services available in the
network based on service name and target NF type. The NF service consumer
invokes Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (Expected NF service Name, NF Type of the
expected NF instance, NF type of the NF consumer) from an appropriate
configured NRF in the same PLMN. The parameter may include optionally producer
NF Set ID, NF Service Set ID, SUPI, Data Set Identifier(s), External Group ID
(for UDM, UDR discovery), UE\'s Routing Indicator (for UDM and AUSF
discovery), S-NSSAI, NSI ID if available and other service related parameters.
In addition, for AMF discovery, the parameters may include AMF Region ID, AMF
Set ID, TAI. The NF service consumer may indicate a preference for target NF
location in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request. A complete list of parameters is
provided in service definition in clause 5.2.7.3.2.
NOTE 1: The NF service consumer indicates its NF location for preference for
target NF location.
NOTE 2: The use of NSI ID within a PLMN depends on the network deployment.
NOTE 3: The need for other service related parameters depends on the NF type
of the expected NF instance(s) and refer to the clause 6.3 \" Principles for
Network function and Network Function Service discovery and selection\" in TS
23.501 [2]. It is up to NF implementation whether one or multiple NF service
instances are registered in the NRF.
2\. The NRF authorizes the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request. Based on the profile of
the expected NF/NF service and the type of the NF service consumer, the NRF
determines whether the NF service consumer is allowed to discover the expected
NF instance(s). If the expected NF instance(s) or NF service instance(s) are
deployed in a certain network slice, NRF authorizes the discovery request
according to the discovery configuration of the Network Slice, e.g. the
expected NF instance(s) are only discoverable by the NF in the same network
slice.
3\. If allowed, the NRF determines a set of NF instance(s) matching the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request and internal policies of the NRF and sends the NF
profile(s) of the determined NF instances. Each NF profile containing at least
the output required parameters (see clause 5.2.7.3.2) to the NF service
consumer via Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request Response message.
If the target NF is UDR, UDM or AUSF, if SUPI was used as optional input
parameter in the request, the NRF shall provide the corresponding UDR, UDM or
AUSF instance(s) that matches the optional input SUPI. Otherwise, if SUPI is
not provided in the request, the NRF shall return all applicable UDR
instance(s) (e.g. based on the Data Set Id, NF type), UDM instance(s) or AUSF
instance(s) (e.g. based on NF type) and if applicable, the information of the
range of SUPI(s) and/or Data Set Id each UDR instance is supporting.
If the target NF is CHF, if SUPI, GPSI or PLMN ID was used as optional input
parameter in the request, the NRF shall provide the corresponding CHF
instance(s) that matches the optional input SUPI, GPSI or PLMN ID. The NRF
shall provide the primary CHF instance and the secondary CHF instance pair(s)
together, if configured in CHF instance profile. Otherwise, if neither
SUPI/PLMN ID nor GPSI is provided in the request, the NRF shall return all
applicable CHF instance(s) and if applicable, the information of the range of
SUPI(s), GPSI(s) or PLMN ID(s).
If the NF service consumer provided a preferred target NF location, the NRF
shall not limit the set of discovered NF instances or NF service instance(s)
to the target NF location, e.g. the NRF may provide NF instance(s) or NF
service instance(s) for which location is not the preferred target NF location
if no NF instance or NF service instance could be found for the preferred
target NF location.
### 4.17.5 NF/NF service discovery across PLMNs in the case of discovery made
by NF service consumer
In the case that the NF service consumer intends to discover the NF/NF service
in home PLMN, the NRF in serving PLMN needs to request \"NF Discovery\"
service from NRF in the home PLMN. The procedure is depicted in the figure
below:
Figure 4.17.5-1: NF/NF service discovery across PLMNs
1\. The NF service consumer in the serving PLMN invokes
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (Expected Service Name, NF type of the expected NF,
home PLMN ID, serving PLMN ID, NF type of the NF service consumer) to an
appropriate configured NRF in the serving PLMN. The request may also include
optionally producer NF Set ID, NF Service Set ID, S-NSSAI, NSI ID if available
and other service related parameters. A complete list of parameters is
provided in service definition in clause 5.2.7.3.2.
NOTE 1: The use of NSI ID within a PLMN depends on the network deployment.
2\. The NRF in serving PLMN identifies NRF in home PLMN (hNRF) based on the
home PLMN ID and it requests \"NF Discovery\" service from NRF in home PLMN
according the procedure in Figure 4.17.4-1 to get the expected NF profile(s)
of the NF instance(s) deployed in the home PLMN. As the NRF in the serving
PLMN triggers the \"NF Discovery\" on behalf of the NF service consumer, the
NRF in the serving PLMN shall not replace the information of the service
requester NF, i.e. NF consumer ID, in the Discovery Request message it sends
to the hNRF.
The hNRF may further query an appropriate local NRF in the home PLMN based on
the input information received from NRF of the serving PLMN. The FQDN of the
local NRF or Endpoint Address of local NRF\'s NF Discovery service in the home
PLMN may be configured in the hNRF or may need to be discovered based on the
input information.
3\. The NRF in serving PLMN provides same as step 3 in clause 4.17.4 applies.
### 4.17.6 SMF Provisioning of available UPFs using the NRF
#### 4.17.6.1 General
This clause describes the provisioning of available UPFs in SMF using the NRF
as documented in clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
This optional node-level step takes place prior to selecting the UPF for PDU
Sessions and may be followed by N4 Node Level procedures defined in clause
4.4.3 where the UPF and the SMF exchange information such as the support of
optional functionalities and capabilities.
As an option, UPF(s) may register in the NRF. This registration phase uses the
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister operation and hence does not use N4.
For the purpose of SMF provisioning of available UPFs, the SMF uses the
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe, Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusNotify and
Nnrf_NFDiscovery services to learn about available UPFs.
NOTE 1: The protocol used by UPF to interact with NRF is described in TS
29.510 [37]
UPFs may be associated with UPF Provisioning Information in the NRF. The UPF
Provisioning Information consists of:
\- a list of (S-NSSAI, DNN);
\- UE IPv4 Address Ranges and/or IPv6 Prefix Range(s) per (S-NSSAI, DNN); and
NOTE 2: The above information can be used by the SMF for UPF selection when
static IP address/prefix allocation is required for a UE.
\- a SMF Area Identity the UPF can serve. The SMF Area Identity allows
limiting the SMF provisioning of UPF(s) using NRF to those UPF(s) associated
with a certain SMF Area Identity. This can e.g. be used if an SMF is only
allowed to control UPF(s) configured in NRF as belonging to a certain SMF Area
Identity.
\- the supported ATSSS steering functionality, i.e. whether MPTCP
functionality or ATSSS-LL functionality or both are supported.
The SMF Area Identity and UE IPv4 Address Ranges and/or IPv6 Prefix Range(s)
are optional in the UPF Provisioning Information.
#### 4.17.6.2 SMF provisioning of UPF instances using NRF
This procedure applies when a SMF wants to get informed about UPFs available
in the network and supporting a list of parameters.
Figure 4.17.6.2-1: SMF provisioning of UPF instances using NRF procedure
The following takes place when an SMF expects to be informed of UPFs available
in the network:
1 The SMF issues a Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe Service Operation
providing the target UPF Provisioning Information it is interested in.
2 The NRF issues Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusNotify with the list of all UPFs
that currently meet the SMF subscription. This notification indicates the
subset of the target UPF Provisioning Information that is supported by each
UPF.
The following takes place when a new UPF instance is deployed:
3 At any time a new UPF instance is deployed.
4 The UPF instance is configured with the NRF identity to contact for
registration and with its UPF Provisioning Information. An UPF is not required
to understand the UPF Provisioning Information beyond usage of this
information to register in step 5.
5 The UPF instance issues an Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister Request operation
providing its NF type, the FQDN or IP address of its N4 interface and the UPF
Provisioning Information configured in step 4.
6\. Alternatively (to steps 4 and 5) OAM registers the UPF on the NRF
indicating the same UPF Provisioning Information as provided in step 5. This
configuration mechanism is out of scope of this specification.
7\. Based on the subscription in step 1, the NRF issues
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusNotify to all SMFs with a subscription matching the
UPF Provisioning Information of the new UPF
### 4.17.7 NF/NF service status subscribe/notify in the same PLMN
Figure 4.17.7-1: NF/NF service status subscribe/notify in the same PLMN
1\. The NF service consumer subscribes to be notified of newly
registered/updated/deregistered NF instances along with its NF services. The
NF service consumer invokes Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe Request from
an appropriate configured NRF in the same PLMN.
2\. The NRF authorizes the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe Request. Based
on the profile of the expected NF/NF service and the type of the NF service
consumer, the NRF determines whether the NF service consumer is allowed to
subscribe to the status of the target NF instance(s) or NF service
instance(s).
3\. If allowed, the NRF acknowledges the execution of
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe Request.
4\. NRF notifies about newly registered/updated/deregistered NF instances
along with its NF services to the subscribed NF service consumer.
NOTE 1: The NF service consumer unsubscribes to receive NF status
notifications by invoking Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusUnSubscribe service
operation.
NOTE 2: When the NF or NF service intance becomes unavailable, the NRF invokes
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusNotify service to notify the NF service consumer
based on the subscription.
### 4.17.8 NF/NF service status subscribe/notify across PLMNs
In the case that the NF service consumer intends to subscribe to the status of
NF/NF service instance(s) in home PLMN, the NRF in serving PLMN needs to
request \"NF status subscribe\" service from NRF in the home PLMN. The
notification is sent from the NRF in the home PLMN to the NF service consumer
in the serving PLMN without the involvement of the NRF in the serving PLMN.
The procedure is depicted in the figure below:
Figure 4.17.8-1: NF/NF service status subscribe/notify across PLMNs
NOTE 1: The NRF in the home PLMN communicates with the NRF and the NF consumer
in the serving PLMN via the SEPPs in the respective PLMNs. For the sake of
clarity, SEPPs are not depicted in the flow.
1\. The NF service consumer in the serving PLMN invokes
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe Request from an appropriate configured NRF
in the serving PLMN.
2\. The NRF in serving PLMN identifies NRF in home PLMN (hNRF) based on the
home PLMN ID and it requests Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe service from
NRF in home PLMN. As the NRF in the serving PLMN triggers the
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe service on behalf of the NF service
consumer, the NRF in the serving PLMN shall not replace the information of the
service requester NF, i.e. NF consumer ID, in the status subscribe Request
message it sends to the hNRF.
3\. The NRF in serving PLMN acknowledges the execution of
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe Request to the NF consumer in the serving
PLMN.
4\. NRF in the home PLMN notifies about newly registered/updated/deregistered
NF instances along with its NF services to the subscribed NF service consumer
in the serving PLMN.
NOTE 2: The NF service consumer unsubscribes to receive NF status
notifications by invoking Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusUnSubscribe service
operation.
NOTE 3: When the NF or NF service intance becomes unavailable, the NRF in the
home PLMN invokes Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusNotify service to notify the NF
service consumer in the serving PLMN based on the subscription.
### 4.17.9 Delegated service discovery when NF service consumer and NF service
producer are in same PLMN
Figure 4.17.9-1: Delegated NF service discovery when NF service consumer and
NF service producer are in same PLMN
1\. The NF service consumer intends to communicate with an NF service
producer. The NF service consumer sends the service request to an SCP. The
request may include discovery and selection parameters necessary to discover
and select a NF service producer instance. The discovery and selection
parameters are included in the request by the NF service consumer in a way
that the SCP does not need to parse the request body.
2\. The SCP may perform discovery upon the request either by interacting with
an NRF using Nnrf_NFDiscovery service NRF or may use information collected
during the previous interactions with an NRF (by the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service
or Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusNotify service operation). The SCP together with
the NRF authorizes the request. The SCP selects the target NF service
producer.
NOTE 1: If the discovery and selection parameters in the request include a UE
identity, e.g. SUPI or IMPI/IMPU, the SCP can resolve the requested NF\'s
Group ID corresponding to the UE identity and then invoke the Nnrf_NFDiscovery
service, as defined in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
3\. If the NF service consumer is authorized to communicate with the NF
service producer, the SCP forwards the request to the selected NF service
producer according to the configuration of the Network Slice, e.g. the
expected NF instances are only reachable by NFs in the same network slice.
4\. The NF service producer sends a response to the SCP. If the request in
step 3 creates a resource in the NF service producer, such as depicted in
Figure 4.17.9-1, the NF service producer responds with resource information
identifying the created resource.
5\. The SCP routes the response to the NF service consumer.
If the NF service consumer receives a resource address, it uses it for
subsequent requests regarding the concerned resource. Otherwise, the procedure
ends here.
6\. On a subsequent operation on the created resource, the NF service consumer
addresses the resource via the resource address returned by the NF service
producer at step 4.
7\. The SCP resolves the NF service producer address and selects a target NF
service producer instance. The SCP then routes the request to the selected NF
service producer instance. See the clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501 [2] for the
details of selection of a target NF service producer instance by SCP.
8\. The SCP delivers the request to the NF service producer.
9\. The NF service producer sends a response to the SCP. The NF service
producer may respond with an updated resource information different to the one
received in the previous response.
10\. The SCP sends a response to the NF service consumer. If the resource
information was updated, the NF service consumer uses the received resource
information for subsequent operations (requests) on the resource.
NOTE 2: In the similar manner of handling the resource information, a binding
indication may be also provided by the NF service producer and used for the
subsequent requests of the NF service consumer. See more details in the clause
4.17.12.
### 4.17.10 Delegated service discovery when NF service consumer and NF
service producer are in different PLMNs
Figure 4.17.10-1: Delegated NF service discovery when NF service consumer and
NF service producer are in different PLMNs
1\. The NF service consumer intends to communicate with an NF service
producer. The NF service consumer sends the request to an SCP. The request
includes at least the source PLMN ID and the target PLMN ID in the discovery
and selection parameters necessary for the SCP to discover and select a NF
service producer instance. The discovery and selection parameters are included
in the request by the NF service consumer in a way that the SCP does not need
to parse the request body.
2\. The SCP recognises that the request is for a NF service producer in
another PLMN. SCP interacts with NRF using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service.
3\. NRF in PLMN-1 and NRF in PLMN 2 interact using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery
service. See step 2 in clause 4.17.5.
4\. SCP gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response with NF profile(s).
5\. SCP selects a NF service producer instance in PLMN-2.
6\. SCP forwards the request to the selected NF service producer instance in
PLMN-2.
Alternatively, SCP may send the discovery request directly to the NRF in
PLMN-2, if it has the relevant NRF address and is authorized by the NRF in
PLMN-2. Thus step 2 goes from SCP to NRF in PLMN-2 and step 4 goes from NRF in
PLMN-2 to SCP and step 3 is omitted.
### 4.17.11 Indirect Communication without delegated discovery Procedure
This clause provides the call flow for indirect communication model without
delegated discovery.
Figure 4.17.11-1: Procedure for Indirect Communication without delegated
discovery
The NF/NF service discovery procedure is defined in clauses 4.17.4 and 4.17.5.
In a successful discovery the NF service consumer gets the NF profile(s)
matching the search criteria provided in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request message.
1\. When the NF Service Consumer needs to send a Service Request and has
obtained an endpoint address for the appropriate resources of the NF service
producer from the reply to a previous service operation, the NF Service
Consumer should indicate that endpoint address as target for the Service
Request. Otherwise, if the NF Service Consumer has stored results from the
Discovery Procedure, the NF Service Consumer selects an appropriate NF
Producer / NF Service Producer instance from the list of NF profiles provided
by the NRF. The NF Service Consumer considers the NF and NF service parameters
(e.g. TAI, S-NSSAI, locality, priority etc) in the NF profiles. The NF Service
consumer requests service from the NF Service producer by sending a service
request message to the NF service producer via the SCP and the NF Service
Consumer may provide a Routing Binding Indication with the same contents as
the previously received Binding Indication.
2\. If the Routing Binding Indication is provided by the NF Service Consumer,
SCP (re-)selects as specified in Table 6.3.1.0â€‘1 of TS 23.501 [2] and routes
the service request to target accordingly. If the Routing Binding Indication
is not provided by the NF Service Consumer, then the SCP routes the service
request based on routing information available.
3\. The NF Service Producer responds via SCP.
4\. SCP forwards the response.
### 4.17.12 Binding between NF service consumer and NF service producer
#### 4.17.12.1 General
This clause describes the procedures to establish binding between the NF
service consumer and producer.
Direct Communication or Indirect Communication procedures may be used between
the Consumer and Producer. In the case of Indirect Communication, an SCP is
located between the Consumer and Producer.
#### 4.17.12.2 Binding created as part of service response
When the NF service consumer communicates with the NF service producer, the
producer may return a binding indication to the consumer. The consumer stores
the received binding indication and uses it for the subsequent requests
concerning the data context.
Figure 4.17.12.2-1: Binding created as part of service response
1\. If Direct Communication is used, the NF service consumer selects the NF
service producer and sends the request to the selected NF service producer. If
Indirect Communication without delegated discovery is used, the NF service
consumer selects the NF service producer set or instance and sends the request
to the selected NF service producer via the SCP; if the NF serviver consumer
only selects the NF service producer set, it provides the necessary selection
parameters and the SCP selects the NF service producer instance. If Indirect
Communication with delegated discovery is used, the NF service consumer sends
the request to the SCP and provides within the service request to the SCP the
discovery and selection parameters necessary to discover and select a NF
service producer.
2\. The NF service producer sends a response to the NF service consumer. In
the response the NF service producer may include a binding indication. If the
NF service consumer receives a resource information and binding indication as
specified in Table 6.3.1.0-1 of TS 23.501 [2], it uses them for subsequent
requests regarding the concerned resource. Otherwise, the procedure ends here.
3\. The NF service consumer uses the binding indication and resource
information received in the previous step for subsequent requests regarding
the concerned resource. If indirect communication with delegated discovery is
used, the NF service consumer includes a Routing Binding Indication with the
same contents as the received Binding Indication. If indirect communication
without delegated discovery is used, the NF service consumer also includes the
Routing Binding Indication with the same contents as the received Binding
Indication unless the NF service consumer performs a reselection. The SCP
shall route the service request using the Routing Binding Indication and
resource information sent from the NF service consumer.
4\. The NF service producer sends a response to the consumer. The NF service
producer may respond with an updated binding indication, different to the one
received in the previous response.
#### 4.17.12.3 Binding created as part of service request
If the NF service consumer can also be as a NF service producer for later
communication from the contacted producer, a service request sent to the
producer may include binding indication.
NOTE: This clause only applies to an AMF, V-SMF or I-SMF as NF service
consumer sending requests to an SMF and to an AMF as NF service consumer
sending requests to an I-SMF or V-SMF, in step 1 unless further usage has been
defined in stage 3. Implicit subscriptions are not described in this clause.
Figure 4.17.12.3-1: Binding created as part of service request
1\. Instance A, as an NF service consumer sends a service request using either
Direct Communication or Indirect communication via SCP and Instance B is
selected as NF service producer. If Instance A can also be NF service producer
for later communication for the concerned data context, it may include binding
indication referring to NF service instance, NF service set, NF instance or NF
Set as specified in Table 6.3.1.0-1 of TS 23.501 [2] in the request sent to
the NF service producer; the binding indication shall be associated with an
applicability indicating \"other service\" and include the service name. In
this case, if indirect communication is used, the SCP sends to the Instance B
the service request including the binding indication.
2\. Instance B as the NF service producer sends a response to the NF service
consumer.
3\. When Instance B as NF service consumer needs to invoke the service
provided by Instance A, Instance B sends a request using the binding
indication received in step 1 as described in Steps 3-4 in Figure 4.17.12.2-1
with the following difference:
\- Based on the received binding indication, if delegated discovery is not
used, the Instance B may need to discover the corresponding endpoint address
of the Instance A.
#### 4.17.12.4 Binding for subscription requests
Binding for notifications can be created as part of an explicit or implicit
subscription request. In this case, illustrated in Figure 4.17.12.4-1, the
subscription request may include a Binding Indication 1 referring to NF
service instance, NF service Set, NF instance or NF Set and additionally
includes a service name of the NF service consumer as specified in Table
6.3.1.0-1 of TS 23.501 [2]. The NF Service Set ID, NF service instance ID and
service name relate to the service of a NF service consumer that will handle
the notification.
For direct communication, the NF service producer selects the target for the
related notifications using the notification endpoint received in the
subscription request. If the notification endpoint included in the
subscription is not reachable, the Binding Indication received is used to
discover an alternative notification endpoint, as specified in Table 6.3.1.0-1
of TS 23.501 [2].
For indirect communication, the NF service producer includes the notification
endpoint received in the subscription and may include a Routing Binding
Indication with the same contents as the received Binding Indication. If the
notification endpoint included in the subscription is not reachable, the SCP
selects the target for the related notifications using the received Routing
Binding Indication as specified in Table 6.3.1.0-1 of TS 23.501 [2].
If the Binding Indication for Notifications needs to be updated, the NF
service consumer may initiate a new Subscription request to the NF service
producer with an updated Binding Indication or may include the Binding
Indication in the acknowledgment of a Notification. A Subscription request may
also contain updated Notification Correlation ID and Notification Target
Address.
Binding for the subscription resource at the NF service producer can also be
created: The Subscription Response message may contain a Binding Indication 2
referring to NF service instance, NF instance or NF Set of the NF service
producer.
For direct communication, the NF service consumer selects the target for the
related request to the producer, such as the request to update the
subscription shown in Figure 4.17.12.4-1, using the received Binding
Indication 2 as specified in Table 6.3.1.0-1 of TS 23.501 [2].
For indirect communication with delegated discovery, the NF service consumer
includes a Routing Binding Indication with the same contents as the received
Binding Indication 2. For indirect communication without delegated discovery,
the NF service consumer also includes the Routing Binding Indication with the
same contents as the received Binding Indication 2 unless it performs a
reselection. The SCP selects the target for the related request using the
received Routing Binding Indication 2 as specified in Table 6.3.1.0-1 of TS
23.501 [2].
If the Binding Indication for Subscription needs to be updated, the NF service
producer may provide an updated binding indication in a notification request
to the NF service consumer or in the response to a subsequent subscription
update request from the NF service consumer.
Figure 4.17.12.4-1: Binding in a subscription request
Figure 4.17.12.4-2: Binding during subscription via another network function
An NF service consumer may subscribe via another network function. For
example, NF_A may subscribe to NF_B on behalf of NF_C. NF_A additionally
subscribe to subscription related events. In this case, both the binding
indication from NF_C and NF_A are provided to the NF service producer NF_B.
The Binding Indication for notifications to subscription related events shall
be associated with an applicability indicating \"subscription events\".
The NF_C\'s binding indication is used for reselection of a notification
endpoint, which is used for event notification. The NF_A\'s binding indication
is used for reselection of a notification endpoint, which is used for
subscription change event notification.
## 4.18 Procedures for Management of PFDs
### 4.18.1 General
NOTE: The PFDF service is functionality within the NEF.
### 4.18.2 PFD management via NEF (PFDF)
Figure 4.18.2-1 procedure for PFD management via NEF (PFDF)
1\. The AF invokes the Nnef_PFDManagement_Create/Update/Delete service. The
Allowed Delay is an optional parameter. If the Allowed Delay is included, it
indicates that the list of PFDs in this request should be provisioned within
the time interval indicated by the Allowed Delay to the SMF(s) that have
subscribed to the PFD management service using Nnef_PFDManagement_Subscribe
service operation.
2\. NEF checks whether the AF is authorized to perform this request and NEF
(PFDF) checks if the AF is authorised to provision this PFD data based on the
operator policies.
3\. The NEF (PFDF) invokes the Nudr_DM_Create/Update/Delete (Application
Identifier, one or more sets of PFDs, Allowed Delay) to the UDR.
4\. The UDR updates the list of PFDs for the Application Identifier.
5\. The UDR sends a Nudr_DM_Create/Update/Delete Response to the NEF (PFDF).
6\. The NEF sends Nnef_PFDManagement_Create/Update/Delete Response to the
Application Function.
### 4.18.3 PFD management in the SMF
#### 4.18.3.1 PFD Retrieval by the SMF
This procedure enables the SMF to retrieve PFDs for an Application Identifier
from the NEF (PFDF) when a PCC rule with this Application Identifier is
provided/activated and PFDs provided by the NEF (PFDF) are not available at
the SMF.
In addition, this procedure enables the SMF to retrieve PFDs from the NEF
(PFDF)when the caching timer for an Application Identifier elapses and a PCC
Rule for this Application Identifier is still active.
The NEF (PFDF) retrieves the PFDs from UDR unless already available in NEF
(PFDF).
The SMF may retrieve PFDs for one or more Application Identifiers in the same
Request. All PFDs related to an Application Identifier are provided in the
response from the UDR to NEF (PFDF).
Figure 4.18.3.1-1 PFD Retrieval by the SMF
1\. SMF invokes the Nnef_PFDManagement_Fetch (Application Identifier (s)) to
the NEF (PFDF).
2\. NEF (PFDF) checks if the PFDs for the Application Identifier (s) are
available in the NEF (PFDF), if available, the NEF (PFDF) skips to step 4\. If
not, the NEF (PFDF) invokes Nudr_DM_Query (Application Identifier (s)) to
retrieve the PFD(s) from UDR.
3\. The UDR provides a Nudr_DM_Query response (Application Identifier(s),
PFD(s)) to the NEF (PFDF).
4\. The NEF (PFDF) replies to the SMF with Nnef_PFDManagement_Fetch
(Application Identifier(s), PFD(s)).
#### 4.18.3.2 Management of PFDs in the SMF
This procedure enables the provisioning, modification or removal of PFDs
associated with an application identifier in the SMF. Either the complete list
of all PFDs of all application identifiers, the complete list of all PFDs of
one or more application identifiers or a subset of PFDs for individual
application identifiers may be managed.
Each PFD of an application identifier is associated with a PFD id if a subset
of the PFD(s) associated with an application identifier can be provisioned,
updated or removed. If always the full set of PFD(s) for an application
identifier is managed in each transaction, PFD ids do not need to be provided.
Figure 4.18.3.2-1 Management of PFDs in the SMF
1\. As pre-requisite condition to receiving push notifications, the SMF
subscribes to PFD notifications from the NEF (PFDF) by sending
Nnef_PFDManagement_Subscribe message.
2\. The NEF (PFDF) invokes Nnef_PFD_Management_Notify (Application Identifier,
PFDs, PFDs operation) to the SMF(s) to which the PFD(s) shall be provided. The
NEF (PFDF) may decide to delay the distribution of PFDs to the SMF(s) for some
time to optimize the signalling load. If the NEF (PFDF) received an Allowed
Delay for a PFD, the NEF (PFDF) shall distribute this PFD within the indicated
time interval.

## 4.20 UE Parameters Update via UDM Control Plane Procedure
### 4.20.1 General
The purpose of the control plane solution for update of UE parameters is to
allow the HPLMN or SNPN to update the UE with a specific set of parameters,
generated and stored in the UDM, by delivering protected UDM Update Data via
NAS signalling. The HPLMN or SNPN updates such parameters based on the
operator policies.
The UDM Update Data that the UDM delivers to the UE may contain:
\- one or more UE parameters including:
\- the updated Default Configured NSSAI (final consumer of the parameter is
the ME).
\- the updated Routing Indicator Data (final consumer of the parameter is the
USIM when the related credential is stored in the USIM, i.e. for PLMN or SNPN
credentials; or final consumer of the parameter is the ME when the related
credential is stored in the ME, i.e. for SNPN credentials).
\- a \"UE acknowledgement requested\" indication.
\- a \"re-registration requested\" indication.
### 4.20.2 UE Parameters Update via UDM Control Plane Procedure
Figure 4.20.2-1: UE Parameters Update via UDM Control Plane Procedure
1\. UDM decides to perform UE parameter update due to \"Routing Indicator
update data\" or \"Default Configured NSSAI update data\".
2\. From UDM to the AMF: The UDM notifies the changes of the information
related to the UE to the affected AMF by the means of invoking
Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation. The Nudm_SDM_Notification service
operation contains the UDM Update Data (e.g. \"Routing Indicator update
data\", \"Default Configured NSSAI update data\") that needs to be delivered
transparently to the UE over NAS within the Access and Mobility Subscription
data. The UDM update data includes:
\- The updated parameters to be delivered to the UE (e.g. the updated Routing
Indicator Data, the Default Configured NSSAI).
\- whether the UE needs to send an ack to the UDM.
\- whether the UE needs to re-register after updating the data.
3\. From AMF to UDM: If AMF determines that the UE is not reachable, then AMF
invokes the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to UDM indicating that the
transmission of UE Parameters Update data is not successful. The UDM considers
the procedure as UE Parameters Update procedure as pending and subsequent
steps from 4-7 are skipped.
4\. From AMF to the UE: the AMF sends a DL NAS TRANSPORT message to the served
UE. The AMF includes in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message the transparent container
received from the UDM.
The UE verifies based on mechanisms defined in TS 33.501 [15] that the UDM
Update Data is provided by HPLMN or SNPN and:
\- If the security check on the UDM Update Data is successful, as defined in
TS 33.501 [15] the UE either stores the information and uses those parameters
from that point onwards, or forwards the information to the USIM; and
\- If the security check on the UDM Update Data fails, the UE discards the
contents of the UDM Update Data.
5\. The UE to the AMF: If the UE has verified that the UDM Update Data is
provided by HPLMN or SNPN and the UDM has requested the UE to send an ack to
the UDM, the UE sends an UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF with a
transparent container including the UE acknowledgement.
6\. The AMF to the UDM: If the AMF receives an UL NAS TRANSPORT message with a
transparent container carrying a UE acknowledgement from the UE, the AMF sends
a Nudm_SDM_Info request message including the transparent container to the
UDM.
7\. If the UDM has requested the UE to re-register, the UE waits until it goes
back to RRC idle and initiates a Registration procedure as defined in TS
24.501 [25].
### 4.20.3 Void
## 4.21 Secondary RAT Usage Data Reporting Procedure
The procedure in Figure 4.21-1 may be used to report Secondary RAT Usage Data
from NG-RAN node to the AMF. It is executed by the NG-RAN node to report the
Secondary RAT Usage Data information towards AMF which is then reported
towards SMF.
The procedure in Figure 4.21-2 may be used to report the Secondary RAT Usage
Data from AMF towards the SMF. Optionally, it is used to report the Secondary
RAT Usage Data from V-SMF to the H-SMF when the reporting to H-SMF is
activated.
Figure 4.21-1: RAN Secondary RAT Usage Data Reporting procedure
1\. The NG-RAN, if it supports Dual Connectivity with Secondary RAT (using NR
radio, E-UTRA radio, or unlicensed spectrum using NR or E-UTRA radio) and it
is configured to report Secondary RAT Usage Data for the UE, depending on
certain conditions documented in this specification, it shall send a RAN Usage
Data Report message to the AMF including the Secondary RAT Usage Data for the
UE. The NG-RAN node will send only one RAN Usage Report for a UE when the UE
is subject to handover by RAN. The RAN Usage Data Report includes a Handover
Flag to indicate when the message is sent triggered by a handover.
Figure 4.21-2: SMF Secondary RAT Usage Data Reporting procedure
The NG-RAN, if it supports Dual Connectivity with Secondary RAT (using NR
radio, E-UTRA radio, or unlicensed spectrum using NR or E-UTRA radio) and it
is configured to report Secondary RAT usage data for the UE, it shall include
the Secondary RAT usage data for the UE to the AMF in certain messages
depending on certain conditions documented elsewhere in this TS.
1\. The AMF forwards the N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT Usage Data) to the
SMF in a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request.
2\. The V-SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update (Secondary RAT Usage Data)
message to the H-SMF.
3\. The H-SMF acknowledges receiving the Secondary RAT Usage data for the UE.
4\. The V-SMF acknowledges receiving the Secondary RAT Usage data back to the
AMF.
## 4.22 ATSSS Procedures
### 4.22.1 General
This clause specifies the procedures that enable the support of Access Traffic
Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSSS), as defined in clause 5.32 of TS
23.501 [2]. These procedures can be applied only by ATSSS-capable UEs and 5GC
networks.
The key enabler of ATSSS is the Multi Access-PDU (MA PDU) Session. As
specified in clause 5.32.1 of TS 23.501 [2], a MA PDU Session is a PDU Session
associated with two independent N3/N9 tunnels between the PSA and RAN/AN and
with multiple access types, i.e. with one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.
The traffic of a MA PDU Session can be transferred over 3GPP access, or over
non-3GPP access, or over both accesses. How the traffic is transferred over
the available accesses of a MA PDU Session is governed by the applicable
policy created by the 5GC network.
The UE determines whether ATSSS is supported by the network based on the MA
PDU Session Support indicator provided by the AMF during the Registration
procedures, as specified in clause 4.22.9.1. If the network does not support
ATSSS, the UE shall not initiate the following procedures in this network:
\- establishment of a MA PDU Session (clause 4.22.2);
\- establishment of a PDU Session with \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\"
indication (clause 4.22.3);
\- addition of user-plane resources over one access for an existing MA PDU
Session, which has been established over the other access in a different
network (clause 4.22.7); or
\- PDU Session Modification with Request Type of \"MA PDU request\" or with
\"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication after moving from EPC to 5GC
(clause 4.22.6.3).
### 4.22.2 UE Requested MA PDU Session Establishment
#### 4.22.2.1 Non-roaming and Roaming with Local Breakout
The signalling flow for a MA PDU Session establishment when the UE is not
roaming, or when the UE is roaming and the PDU Session Anchor (PSA) is located
in the VPLMN, is based on the signalling flow in Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 with the
following differences and clarifications:
\- The PDU Session Establishment Request message may be sent over the 3GPP
access or over the non-3GPP access. In the steps below, it is assumed that it
is sent over the 3GPP access, unless otherwise specified.
\- In step 1, the UE provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in UL NAS
Transport message and its ATSSS Capabilities as defined in clause 5.32.2 of TS
23.501 [2] in PDU Session Establishment Request message.
The \"MA PDU Request\" Request Type in the UL NAS Transport message indicate
to the network that this PDU Session Establishment Request is to establish a
new MA PDU Session and to apply the ATSSS-LL functionality, or the MPTCP
functionality, or both functionalities, for steering the traffic of this MA
PDU session.
If the UE requests an S-NSSAI and the UE is registered over both accesses, it
shall request an S-NSSAI that is allowed on both accesses.
\- In step 2, if the AMF supports MA PDU sessions, then the AMF selects an
SMF, which supports MA PDU sessions. In step 3, the AMF informs the SMF that
the request is for a MA PDU Session by including \"MA PDU Request\" indication
and, in addition, it indicates to SMF whether the UE is registered over both
accesses. If the AMF determines that the UE is registered via both accesses
but the requested S-NSSAI is not allowed on both accesses, then the AMF shall
reject the MA PDU session establishment.
The AMF shall reject the PDU Session Establishment request if the request is
for a LADN.
\- In step 4, the SMF retrieves, via Session Management subscription data, the
information whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not.
\- In step 7, if dynamic PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the SMF
sends an \"MA PDU Request\" indication to the PCF in the SM Policy Control
Create message and the ATSSS Capabilities of the MA PDU session. The SMF
provides the currently used Access Type(s) and RAT Type(s) to the PCF. The PCF
decides whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not based on operator policy
and subscription data.
The PCF provides PCC rules that include MA PDU session control information, as
specified in TS 23.503 [20]. From the received PCC rules, the SMF derives (a)
ATSSS rules, which will be sent to UE for controlling the traffic steering,
switching and splitting in the uplink direction and (b) N4 rules, which will
be sent to UPF for controlling the traffic steering, switching and splitting
in the downlink direction. If the UE indicates the support of \"ATSSS-LL
Capability\", the SMF may derive the Measurement Assistance Information.
If the SMF receives a UP Security Policy for the PDU Session with Integrity
Protection set to \"Required\" and the MA PDU session is being established
over non-3GPP access, the SMF does not verify whether the access can satisfy
the UP Security Policy.
\- In the remaining steps of Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1, the SMF establishes the user-
plane resources over the 3GPP access, i.e. over the access where the PDU
Session Establishment Request was sent on:
\- In step 10, the N4 rules derived by SMF for the MA PDU session are sent to
UPF and two N3 UL CN tunnels info are allocated by the UPF. If the ATSSS LL
functionality is supported for MA PDU Session, the SMF may instruct the UPF to
initiate performance measurement for this MA PDU Session. If the MPTCP
functionality is supported for the MA PDU Session, the SMF may instruct the
UPF to activate MPTCP functionality for this MA PDU Session. In step 10a, the
UPF allocates addressing information for the Performance Measurement Function
(PMF) in the UPF. In step 10b, the UPF sends the addressing information for
the PMF in the UPF to the SMF.
In step 10a, if the message from the SMF instructs the UPF to activate MPTCP
functionality, the UPF allocates the UE \"link-specific multipath\"
addresses/prefixes. In step 10b, the UPF sends the \"link-specific multipath\"
addresses/prefixes and MPTCP proxy information to the SMF.
\- In step 11, for the MA PDU session, the SMF includes an \"MA PDU session
Accepted\" indication in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message to
the AMF and indicates to AMF that the N2 SM Information included in this
message should be sent over 3GPP access. The AMF marks this PDU session as MA
PDU session based on the received \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication.
\- In step 13, the UE receives a PDU Session Establishment Accept message,
which indicates to UE that the requested MA PDU session was successfully
established. This message includes the ATSSS rules for the MA PDU session,
which were derived by SMF. If the ATSSS -LL functionality is supported for the
PDU Session, the SMF may include the addressing information of PMF in the UPF
into the Measurement Assistance Information. If the MPTCP functionality is
supported for the MA PDU Session, the SMF shall include the \"link-specific
multipath\" addresses/prefixes of the UE and the MPTCP proxy information.
\- After step 18 in Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1, if the SMF was informed in step 2 that
the UE is registered over both accesses, then the SMF initiates the
establishment of user-plane resources over non-3GPP access too. The SMF sends
an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to the AMF including N2 SM
Information and indicates to AMF that the N2 SM Information should be sent
over non-3GPP access. Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer does not include
an N1 SM Container for the UE because this was sent to UE in step 13. After
this step, the two N3 tunnels between the PSA and RAN/AN are established.
The last step above is not executed when the UE is registered over one access
only, in which case the MA PDU Session is established with user-plane
resources over one access only. How user-plane resources can be added over an
access of the MA PDU Session is specified in clause 4.22.7.
#### 4.22.2.2 Home-routed Roaming
##### 4.22.2.2.1 Home-routed Roaming - UE registered to the same PLMN
When the UE is registered to the same VPLMN over 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access, the MA PDU Session is established as specified in Figure 4.3.2.2.2-1
(\"UE-requested PDU Session Establishment for home-routed roaming scenarios\")
with the differences and clarifications:
\- The PDU Session Establishment Request message may be sent over the 3GPP
access or over the non-3GPP access.
\- In step 1, the UE provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in UL NAS
Transport message and its ATSSS Capabilities, as defined in clause 5.32.2 of
TS 23.501 [2] in PDU Session Establishment Request message.
\- In step 2, if the AMF supports MA PDU sessions, then the AMF selects a
V-SMF and an H-SMF, which supports MA PDU sessions. The V-SMF serves the UE
over both accesses.
\- In step 3, the AMF informs the SMF that the request is for a MA PDU Session
by including an \"MA PDU Request\" indication and, in addition, the AMF
indicates to V-SMF that the UE is registered over both accesses.
\- In step 5, two DL N9 tunnel CN info and two UL N3 tunnel CN info are
allocated by the V-SMF or by the V-UPF.
\- In step 6, the V-SMF informs the H-SMF that the request is for a MA PDU
Session by including an \"MA PDU Request\" indication and indicates to H-SMF
that the UE is registered over both accesses.
\- In step 7, the H-SMF retrieves, via Session Management subscription data,
the information whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not.
\- In step 9, if dynamic PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the H-SMF
sends an \"MA PDU Request\" indication to H-PCF in the SM Policy Control
Create message and the ATSSS Capabilities of the MA PDU session. The H-SMF
provides the currently used list of Access Type(s) and RAT Type(s) for the MA-
PDU session to the H-PCF. The H-PCF decides whether the MA PDU session is
allowed or not based on operator policy and subscription data.
The H-PCF provides the PCC rules containing MA PDU session control information
and the H-SMF derives the ATSSS rules for the UE and the N4 rules for the
H-UPF.
\- In step 12, two UL N9 tunnel CN info are allocated by the H-SMF or by the
H-UPF. After this step, the two N9 tunnels between the H-UPF and V-UPF are
established.
\- In step 13, the H-SMF sends \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication to V-SMF
in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response message.
\- In step 14, the V-SMF sends the \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication in
the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message to the AMF and indicates
the AMF to send the N2 SM Information included in this message over the access
that the UE sent the PDU Session Establishment Request. The AMF marks this PDU
session as MA PDU session based on the received \"MA PDU session Accepted\"
indication.
If the V-SMF received two UL N9 tunnel CN info from the H-SMF, the V-SMF also
initiates the establishment of user-plane resources over the other access. The
V-SMF sends an N1N2 Message Transfer to AMF including N2 SM Information and
the other access type to indicate to AMF that the N2 SM Information should be
sent over the other access. The N1N2 Message Transfer does not include an N1
SM Container for the UE which was sent to UE over the access that the UE sent
the PDU Session Establishment Request.
\- In step 16, the UE receives a PDU Session Establishment Accept message,
which indicates to UE that the requested MA PDU session was successfully
established. This message includes the ATSSS rules for the MA PDU session,
which were derived by H-SMF and may include Measurement Assistance
Information.
\- After step 20, if the V-SMF was informed in step 3 that the UE is
registered over both accesses, then the V-SMF initiates the establishment of
user-plane resources over the other access too. The V-SMF sends an N1N2
Message Transfer to the AMF including N2 SM Information and indicates to the
AMF over which access the N2 SM Information should be sent. The N1N2 Message
Transfer does not include an N1 SM Container for the UE because this was sent
to the UE in step 14. After this step, two N9 tunnels between the H-UPF and
the V-UPF as well as two N3 tunnels between the V-UPF and RAN/AN are
established, or, if the H-UPF is connected to two different V-UPFs, the H-UPF
has one N9 tunnel with each V-UPF.
##### 4.22.2.2.2 Home-routed Roaming - UE registered to different PLMNs
When the UE is registered to different PLMNs over 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access, the MA PDU Session is established first over one access as specified
in Figure 4.3.2.2.2-1 (\"UE-requested PDU Session Establishment for home-
routed roaming scenarios\") and then over the other access with the following
differences and clarifications:
\- In step 1, the UE provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in UL NAS
Transport message and its ATSSS Capabilities, as defined in clause 5.32.2 of
TS 23.501 [2].
\- In step 2, if the AMF supports MA PDU sessions, then the AMF selects a
V-SMF, which supports MA PDU sessions.
\- In step 3, the AMF informs the V-SMF that the request is for a MA PDU
Session (i.e. it includes an \"MA PDU Request\" indication).
\- In step 6, the V-SMF informs the H-SMF that the request is for a MA PDU
Session (i.e. it includes an \"MA PDU Request\" indication).
\- In step 7, the H-SMF retrieves, via Session Management subscription data,
the information whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not.
\- In step 9, if dynamic PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the H-SMF
sends an \"MA PDU Request\" indication to PCF in the SM Policy Control Create
message and the ATSSS Capabilities of the MA PDU session. The H-SMF provides
the currently used Access Type(s) and RAT Type(s) for the MA-PDU session to
the PCF. The PCF decides whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not based on
operator policy and subscription data.
\- In step 16, the UE receives a PDU Session Establishment Accept message,
which indicates to UE that the requested MA PDU session was successfully
established. This message includes the ATSSS rules for the MA PDU session,
which were derived by H-SMF and may include Measurement Assistance
Information.
\- After the MA PDU Session is successfully established on the first access,
the UE shall initiate again the MA PDU Session establishment procedure in
Figure 4.3.2.2.2-1 over the other access with the following differences and
clarifications:
\- In step 1, the UE shall send another PDU Session Establishment Request over
the other access containing the same PDU Session ID that was provided over the
first access. The UE also provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in UL
NAS Transport message.
\- In step 12, new UL N9 tunnel CN info is allocated by the H-SMF or by the
H-UPF.
\- In step 16, the UE receives another PDU Session Establishment Accept
message, which may contain updated ATSSS rules for the MA PDU session.
\- After step 20, two N9 tunnels between the H-UPF and two different V-UPFs as
well as two N3 tunnels between different V-UPF and RAN/AN are established, or
two N3 tunnels, one is between V-UPF and RAN/AN over 3GPP access and the other
is between H-UPF and RAN/AN over non 3GPP access, as well as one N9 tunnel
between H-UPF and V-UPF are established.
### 4.22.3 UE Requested PDU Session Establishment with Network Modification to
MA PDU Session
#### 4.22.3.1 Overview
When an ATSSS-capable UE requests to establish a single-access PDU Session,
but no policy in the UE and no local restrictions mandate a single access, the
5GC network may decide to modify it to a Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session.
This decision may be taken when e.g. the SMF wants to offload some traffic of
the requested PDU Session to non-3GPP access or when the SMF wants to apply
MPTCP to provide bandwidth aggregation for the requested PDU Session.
#### 4.22.3.2 Non-roaming or roaming with local breakout
In the case of non-roaming or roaming with local breakout, the procedure for
establishing a MA PDU Session when the UE requests a single-access PDU Session
is the same with the procedure specified in clause 4.22.2.1.1, with the
following clarifications and modifications:
\- In step 1, the UE sets Request Type to initial request and it may include
the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication in UL NAS Transport message
and its ATSSS Capabilities in PDU Session Establishment Request message, if
the 5GC is ATSSS capable and no policy in the UE (e.g. no URSP rule) and no
local restrictions mandate a single access for the requested PDU Session. The
\"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication indicates that the requested
single-access PDU Session may be converted to a MA PDU Session, if the 5GC
network wants to.
\- In step 2, if the AMF receives the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\"
indication, the AMF may select a SMF that supports MA PDU sessions. The AMF
does not send the \"MA PDU Request\" indication to SMF, but it sends the \"MA
PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication, if received from the UE. If the AMF
determines that the requested S-NSSAI is not allowed on both accesses, the AMF
shall not forward \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication to the SMF. If
the AMF sends the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication to SMF, it
shall also indicate to SMF whether the UE is registered over both accesses.
If the PDU Session Establishment request is for a LADN, the AMF shall not
forward \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication to the SMF.
\- After step 6, if SMF receives the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\"
indication, the SMF may decide, if dynamic PCC is not to be used, to convert
the single-access PDU Session requested by the UE into a MA PDU Session. The
SMF may take this decision based on local operator policy, subscription data
indicating whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not and/or other
conditions, which are not specified in the present document.
If the SMF receives ATSSS Capabilities from the UE but does not receive \"MA
PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication from the AMF, the SMF shall not
convert the single-access PDU Session requested by the UE into a MA PDU
Session.
If the SMF receives a UP Security Policy for the PDU Session with Integrity
Protection set to \"Required\" and the MA PDU session is being established
over non-3GPP access, the SMF does not verify whether the access can satisfy
the UP Security Policy.
\- In step 7, if dynamic PCC is to be used for the PDU Session, the SMF
indicates to PCF that the SM policy control information is requested for a MA
PDU Session via \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication if the MA PDU
session is allowed based on the subscription data. The SMF provides the
currently used Access Type(s) and RAT Type(s) for the MA-PDU session to the
H-PCF. The SMF also provides the ATSSS Capabilities of the MA PDU session.
\- In step 10, the N4 rules derived by SMF for the MA-PDU session are sent to
UPF and two N3 UL CN tunnels info are allocated by the UPF.
\- In step 11, for the MA PDU Session, the SMF sends an \"MA PDU session
Accepted\" indication in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message to
the AMF. The AMF marks this PDU session as MA PDU session based on the
received \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication.
\- The PDU Session Establishment Accept message includes ATSSS rules which
indicate to UE that the requested PDU Session was converted by the network to
a MA PDU Session.
\- The SMF triggers the establishment of user-plane resources in both
accesses, if it was informed in step 2 that the UE is registered over both
accesses.
#### 4.22.3.3 Home-routed, the UE registered to the same VPLMN over both
access
In the case of home-routed roaming, when the UE is registered to the same
VPLMN over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, the procedure for establishing a
MA PDU Session when the VPLMN is ATSSS capable and the UE requests a single-
access PDU Session but no policy in the UE and no local restrictions mandate a
single access, is the same with the procedure specified in clause 4.22.2.2.1,
with the following clarifications and modifications:
\- In step 1, the UE sets Request Type to initial request and it may include
an \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication in UL NAS Transport message
and its ATSSS Capabilities as defined in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2] in PDU
Session Establishment Request message.
\- In step 2, if the AMF receives the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\"
indication, the AMF may select a V-SMF and a H-SMF that support MA PDU
sessions. If the AMF determines that the requested S-NSSAI is not allowed on
both accesses, the AMF shall not forward \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\"
indication to the V-SMF.
\- In step 3, the AMF sends the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication,
if received from the UE. If the AMF sends the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade
Allowed\" indication to V-SMF, it shall also indicate to V-SMF whether the UE
is registered over both accesses.
\- In step 5, two DL N9 tunnel CN info and two UL N3 tunnel CN info are
allocated by the V-SMF or by the V-UPF. Additionally, the V-SMF indicates to
H-SMF the relationship between the DL N9 tunnel CN info and the access type.
If the single CN Tunnel is established by the H-SMF, the DL N9 tunnel CN info
binding to the access over which the NAS message is received is to be used.
\- In step 6, the V-SMF provides the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\"
indication, if received from AMF, together with an indication whether the UE
is registered over both accesses.
\- After step 6, if the H-SMF receives the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\"
indication, the H-SMF may decide to convert the single-access PDU Session
requested by the UE into a MA PDU Session, if dynamic PCC is not to be used.
The H-SMF may take this decision based on local operator policy, subscription
data indicating whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not and/or other
conditions, which are not specified in the present document.
If the H-SMF receives ATSSS Capabilities from the UE but does not receive \"MA
PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication from the AMF, the H-SMF shall not
convert the single-access PDU Session requested by the UE into a MA PDU
Session.
\- In step 9, if dynamic PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the H-SMF
sends an \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication instead of \"MA PDU
Request\" indication to H-PCF in the SM Policy Control Create message if the
MA PDU session is allowed based on the subscription data. The H-SMF also
provides the ATSSS Capabilities of the MA PDU session. The H-PCF decides
whether the single-access PDU Session can be converted into an MA PDU session
or not based on operator policy and subscription data.
\- In step 13, the H-SMF sends \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication to V-SMF
in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response message.
\- In step 14, the V-SMF includes the \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication
in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message to the AMF. The AMF mark
this PDU session as MA PDU session based on the received \"MA PDU session
Accepted\" indication.
\- In step 16, the UE receives a PDU Session Establishment Accept message,
which includes ATSSS rules and indicates to UE that the requested single-
access PDU session was established as a MA PDU Session.
\- After step 18, two N9 tunnels between the H-UPF and the V-UPF as well as
two N3 tunnels between the V-UPF and 5G-AN are established, or, if the H-UPF
is connected to two different V-UPFs, the H-UPF has one N9 tunnel with each
V-UPF.
#### 4.22.3.4 Home-routed, the UE registered to different PLMNs over both
access
In the case of home-routed roaming, when the UE is registered to different
PLMNs over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, the procedure for establishing a
MA PDU Session when the UE requests a single-access PDU Session in an ATSSS
capable PLMN but no policy in the UE and no local restrictions mandate a
single access, is the same with the procedure specified in clause 4.22.2.2.2,
with the following clarifications and modifications:
\- In step 1, the UE sets Request Type to initial request and it may include
an \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication in UL NAS Transport message
and its ATSSS Capabilities as defined in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2] in PDU
Session Establishment Request message.
\- In step 2, if the AMF receives the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\"
indication, the AMF may select a V-SMF that supports MA PDU sessions.
\- In step 3, the AMF sends the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication,
if received from the UE.
\- In step 6, the V-SMF provides the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\"
indication, if received from AMF.
\- After step 6, if the H-SMF receives the \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\"
indication, the H-SMF may decide to convert the single-access PDU Session
requested by the UE into a MA PDU Session, if dynamic PCC is not to be used.
The H-SMF may take this decision based on local operator policy, subscription
data indicating whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not and/or other
conditions, which are not specified in the present document.
\- In step 9, if dynamic PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the H-SMF
sends an \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication to H-PCF in the SM
Policy Control Create message if the MA PDU session is allowed based on the
subscription data. The H-SMF also provides the ATSSS Capabilities of the MA
PDU session.
\- In step 13, the H-SMF sends \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication to V-SMF
in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response message.
\- In step 14, the V-SMF includes the \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication
in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message to the AMF. The AMF mark
this PDU session as MA PDU session based on the received \"MA PDU session
Accepted\" indication.
\- In step 16, the UE receives a PDU Session Establishment Accept message,
which includes ATSSS rules and indicates to UE that the requested single-
access PDU session was established as a MA PDU Session.
\- After the MA PDU Session is established over one access, the UE shall send
another PDU Session Establishment Request over the other access containing the
same PDU Session ID that was provided over the first access. The UE also sets
Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in UL NAS Transport message.
### 4.22.4 Access Network Performance Measurements
The PMF of UE side or/and UPF side should be able to correlate the measurement
packets with the corresponding access type in order to get the accurate
measurement result for each access. The PMF of UE side correlates the sent
measurement request and received measurement response messages via the same
access type and the PMF of UPF side correlates the sent measurement request
and received measurement response messages via the same N3 or N9 Tunnel. The
PMF of UPF side shall record the relationship between the RTT measurement
result and the N3 or N9 Tunnel.
NOTE: The frequency for RTT measurement for each access is decided by the PMF
of the UE and the UPF respectively.
### 4.22.5 Reporting of Access Availability
After the MA PDU session is established, if Reporting of Access Availability
is required by network, the UE performs detection of the unavailability and
availability of an access based on implementation. To report the
availability/unavailability of the access, the UE sends the PMF-Access Report
to the UPF via the user plane of any available access of the MA PDU session.
The UPF shall use this report to decide which access can be used to deliver
the downlink packets.
### 4.22.6 EPS Interworking
#### 4.22.6.1 General
This clause includes procedures for interworking with EPS.
#### 4.22.6.2 Impacts to EPS interworking procedures
##### 4.22.6.2.1 5GS to EPS handover using N26 interface
Based on the signalling flow in Figure 4.11.1.2.1-1, the procedure is
performed with the following differences and modifications:
\- Step 2 is also performed with all the SMF+PGW-Cs corresponding to MA PDU
Sessions with allocated EBI(s).
\- In step 12e, the AMF requests the release of the 3GPP access of the MA PDU
Session which has resources established for 3GPP access, but not expected to
be transferred to EPC, i.e. no EBI(s) allocated to the MA PDU Session by
triggering Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation.
NOTE: When the SMF received the release request from the AMF, the SMF decides
whether the MA PDU Session is completely released or released over a single
access based on its local policy.
\- In step 16, if the MA PDU Session is established in both 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses and the MA PDU Session is moved to EPS, the SMF triggers the MA PDU
Session Release procedure over non-3GPP access.
##### 4.22.6.2.2 5GS to EPS idle mode mobility using N26 interface
Based on the signalling flow in Figure 4.11.1.3.2-1, the procedure is
performed with the following differences and modifications:
\- Step 5a is also performed with all the SMF+PGW-Cs corresponding to the MA
PDU Sessions with allocated EBI(s).
\- In step 12, if the MA PDU Session is established in both 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses and the MA PDU Session is moved to EPS, the SMF triggers the MA PDU
Session Release procedure over non-3GPP access.
\- In step 15a, the AMF also requests the release of the MA PDU Session which
has resources established for 3GPP access, but not expected to be transferred
to EPS, i.e. no EBI(s) allocated to the MA PDU Session by triggering
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation.
NOTE: When the SMF received the release request from the AMF, the SMF decides
whether the MA PDU Session is completely released or released over a single
access based on its local policy.
##### 4.22.6.2.3 EPS bearer ID allocation
Based on the signalling flow in Figure 4.11.1.4.1-1, additionally for the MA
PDU Session, with the following differences and clarifications:
\- In step 1, the following procedures and relevant steps are also initiated
during the UE Requested MA PDU Session Establishment, the UE Requested PDU
Session Establishment with Network Modification to MA PDU Session and the UE
or network requested MA PDU Session Modification procedures.
\- In step 2, if the QoS Flow(s) of the MA PDU Session is established and the
MA PDU Session is established over 3GPP access and other existing conditions
satisfies EPS interworking, the SMF requests EBI allocation for the QoS
Flow(s) of the MA PDU Session.
##### 4.22.6.2.4 EPS bearer ID revocation
Based on the clause 4.11.1.4.3, additionally the following procedures are
updated to revoke the EPS bearer ID(s) assigned to the QoS Flow(s) in the MA
PDU Session:
\- UE or network requested MA PDU Session Release (non-roaming and roaming
with local breakout) in clause 4.22.10.2.
\- UE or network requested MA PDU Session Release (home-routed roaming) in
clause 4.22.10.3.
\- UE or network requested MA PDU Session Modification (non-roaming and
roaming with local breakout) in clause 4.22.8.2.
\- UE or network requested MA PDU Session Modification (home-routed roaming)
in clause 4.22.8.3.
\- When the MA PDU Session is released over 3GPP access, the UE and the SMF
locally release the EBI(s) for the MA PDU Session. The SMF notifies the AMF of
the released EBI(s) by sending Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify service
operation if the MA PDU Session is established in the same PLMN. If the MA PDU
Session is established in different PLMNs, the SMF notifies the release of the
MA PDU Session and as a result, the AMF removes associated EBI(s).
##### 4.22.6.2.5 5GS to EPS mobility without N26 interface
Based on the signalling flow in Figure 4.11.2.2-1, the procedure is performed
with the following differences and modifications:
\- In step 10 (and step 13 in clause 4.11.2.4.1), if the MA PDU Session is
established in both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and the MA PDU Session is moved
to EPS, the PGW-C + SMF triggers the MA PDU Session Release procedure over
non-3GPP access. PGW-C + SMF and UE locally release the context related to
ATSSS operation, e.g. ATSSS rules and Measurement Assistance Information for
the relevant session.
\- In step 13, during the additional PDN Connectivity Procedure, if the MA PDU
Session is established in both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and the MA PDU
Session is moved to EPS, the PGW-C + SMF triggers the MA PDU Session Release
procedure over non-3GPP access. PGW-C + SMF and UE locally release the context
related to ATSSS operation, e.g. ATSSS rules and Measurement Assistance
Information for the relevant session(s).
\- Step 14 is also performed for the MA PDU session(s) transferred to EPS.
#### 4.22.6.3 Network Modification to MA PDU Session after a UE moving from
EPC
Figure 4.22.6.3-1 describes procedure for Network Modification to MA PDU
Session after a UE is moving from EPS.
Figure 4.22.6.3-1: Network Modification to MA PDU Session after a UE moving
from EPS
1\. When the network supports interworking with N26 interface, a PDN
Connection can be moved from EPS to 5GS as described in clause 4.11.1.2.2 and
clause 4.11.1.3.3.
2\. If the UE requests MA PDU session, or if no policy in the UE (e.g. no URSP
rule) and no local restrictions mandate a single access for the PDU Session,
the UE requests PDU Session Modification over 3GPP access as described in
clause 4.22.8 with following modifications:
\- In step 1a, the UE provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in UL NAS
Transport message, or, if no policy in the UE (e.g. no URSP rule) and no local
restrictions mandate a single access for the PDU Session, the UE provides an
\"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication in UL NAS Transport message. The
UE provides its ATSSS Capabilities, as defined in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501
[2] in PDU Session Modification Request message. If the AMF receives the \"MA
PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication from the UE, the AMF may send it to
the SMF. If the AMF determines that the UE is registered via both accesses in
the same PLMN but the current S-NSSAI is not in the Allowed NSSAI for both
accesses, the AMF shall reject the PDU session modification if the UE provides
an \"MA PDU Request\" indication, or the AMF shall not forward \"MA PDU
Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication to the SMF if received from the UE.
\- In step 3a, if the SMF decides to change the PDU Session to MA PDU Session,
the SMF includes ATSSS rule(s) in the PDU Session Modification Command
message. The SMF may also include Measurement Assistance Information. When the
SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response, the SMF includes \"MA PDU
session Accepted\" indication. The AMF marks the PDU Session as MA PDU Session
based on the indication. If the SMF was informed in step 1a that the UE is
registered over both accesses, then the SMF initiates the establishment of
user-plane resources over non-3GPP access too.
\- In step 5, if the UE receives ATSSS rule(s) in the PDU Session Modification
Command message, the UE stores that the PDU Session is MA PDU Session.
3\. If the UE is registered to the different PLMN over 3GPP and non-3GPP
access, the UE triggers the UE requested PDU Session Establishment procedure
as described in clause 4.22.7 over non-3GPP access to add second access to the
MA PDU Session.
### 4.22.7 Adding / Re-activating / De-activating User-Plane Resources
If the UE has established a MA PDU Session but the user-plane resources over
one access of the MA PDU Session have not been established, then:
\- If the UE wants to add user-plane resources over this access, the UE shall
initiate the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment procedure over this
access, as specified in clause 4.3.2.2. In the UL NAS Transport message, the
UE sets Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" and the same PDU Session ID of the
established MA PDU Session. If only one N9 tunnel is established for the Home
Routed roaming case as described in clause 4.22.2.2, additional N9 tunnel is
established during this UE Requested PDU Session Establishment procedure. For
the roaming with home-routed architecture as defined in TS 23.501 [2] figure
4.2.10-3, an N9 tunnel or an N3 tunnel is established during this PDU Session
Establishment procedure, depending on the access for which the UE is
requesting user-plane resources.
\- The PDU Session Establishment Accept message received by the UE may contain
updated ATSSS rules for the MA PDU session.
\- If the SMF receives the PDU Session Establishment request message over an
access and the SMF already has SM Contexts for the access, the SMF shall not
release existing SM Contexts and shall re-activate user plane resources over
the access while providing the PDU Session Establishment Accept message to the
UE.
If the UE has established a MA PDU Session and the user-plane resources over
one access of the MA PDU Session have been established but are currently
inactive (e.g. because the UE is CM-IDLE over this access), then:
\- If the UE wants to re-activate the user-plane resources over this access,
then the UE shall initiate the Registration or UE Triggered Service Request
procedure over this access, as specified in clause 4.22.9.2.
\- If the network wants to re-activate the user-plane resources over 3GPP
access of the MA PDU Session, or over non-3GPP access of the MA PDU Session,
the network shall initiate the Network Triggered Service Request procedure, as
specified in clause 4.22.9.4.
If the UE has established a MA PDU Session and the user plane resources are
activated over either one access or both accesses, then:
\- If the network wants to de-activate the user-plane resources over single
access, then the network shall initiate the CN-initiated deactivation of UP
connection procedure over this access, as specified in clause 4.3.7.
In all cases, if the UP security protection associated with this PDU session
indicates that UP security is required, the SMF shall not establish resources
over the 3GPP access unless the 3GPP Access Network can enforce the required
UP security protection, even if resources were previously established over
non-3GPP access.
### 4.22.8 UE or network requested MA PDU Session Modification
#### 4.22.8.1 General
This procedure is triggered in the following cases:
\- QoS Flow creation / modification (including GBR QoS Flow movement).
\- Update of ATSSS rules and/or N4 rules.
#### 4.22.8.2 UE or network requested MA PDU Session Modification (non-roaming
and roaming with local breakout)
The signalling flow for a MA PDU Session Modification when the UE is not
roaming, or when the UE is roaming and the PDU Session Anchor (PSA) is located
in the VPLMN, is based on the signalling flow in Figure 4.3.3.2-1 with the
following differences and clarifications:
\- In step 1b, the SMF may decide to update ATSSS rules and/or N4 rules based
on updated PCC rules.
\- In step 1d, if the UPF determines that it cannot send GBR traffic over the
current ongoing access e.g. based on the N4 rules and access availability and
unavailability report from the UE, the UPF shall send Access Availability
report to the SMF. When the SMF receives the Access Availability report, the
SMF may decide to move the GBR QoS Flow to the other access as described in
clause 5.32.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the SMF decides to move the GBR QoS Flow,
the SMF triggers this procedure and, afterwards moves the GBR QoS Flow to the
target access.
\- In step 3, if the SMF decides to move the GBR QoS Flow to the other access,
the SMF sends N2 SM information to the target AN. The PDU Session Modification
Command message is sent to the UE to update ATSSS rule of the UE so that the
UE sends uplink GBR traffic over the target access. The SMF releases AN
resources of the GBR QoS Flow in the source access.
\- In step 3, when the SMF establishes user plane resources for a QoS flows,
the SMF provides QoS profile to the AN as follows:
\- for Non-GBR QoS Flow, steps 3 to 8 are performed over each access for which
the user plane resources are activated.
\- for GBR QoS Flow allowed in a single access, steps 3 to 8 are performed in
the allowed access.
\- for GBR QoS Flow allowed in both accesses, steps 3 to 8 are performed in
the access according to the decision by the SMF (as described in clause 5.32.4
of TS 23.501 [2]).
\- In step 3, if the SMF wants to update ATSSS rules, the SMF includes updated
ATSSS rules in the N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command). When
the SMF provides N1 SM container and/or N2 SM information, the SMF includes
access type in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to provide routing
information to the AMF.
\- In step 8, if the SMF decides to moves GBR QoS Flow to the other access,
the SMF may send updated N4 rules to the UPF.
#### 4.22.8.3 UE or network requested MA PDU Session Modification (home-routed
roaming)
The signalling flow for a MA PDU Session Modification when the UE is
registered to the same VPLMN over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and the PDU
Session Anchor (PSA) is located in the HPLMN, is based on the signalling flow
in Figure 4.3.3.3-1 with the following differences and clarifications:
\- In step 1b, the H-SMF may decide to update ATSSS rules and/or N4 rules
based on updated PCC rules.
\- In step 1d, if the H-UPF determines that it cannot send GBR traffic over
the current ongoing access e.g. based on the N4 rules and access availability
and unavailability report from the UE, the H-UPF shall send Access
Availability report to the H-SMF. When the H-SMF receives the Access
Availability report, the H-SMF may decide to move the GBR QoS Flow to the
other access as described in clause 5.32.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the H-SMF
decides to move GBR QoS Flow, the H-SMF triggers this procedure and,
afterwards moves the GBR QoS flow to the target access.
\- In step 3, if the H-SMF decides to move the GBR QoS Flow to the other
access, the H-SMF sends updated GBR QoS Flow information contains associated
access type and ATSSS rule to the V-SMF. Based on the information the V-SMF
establishes AN resources for the GBR QoS Flow to the target access.
\- In step 3, when the H-SMF provides GBR QoS Flow information, the H-SMF
includes associated access type in Nsmf_PDUSession_Update. When the H-SMF
provides non-GBR QoS Flow information, H-SMF provides the information for both
accesses in Nsmf_PDUSession_Update.
\- In step 3, if the H-SMF wants to update ATSSS rules, the H-SMF triggers
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update and includes an updated ATSSS rules.
\- In step 4, if the H-SMF decides to move the GBR QoS Flow to the other
access, the PDU Session Modification Command message is sent to the UE to
update ATSSS rule of the UE so that the UE sends uplink GBR traffic over the
target access. The V-SMF releases AN resources of the GBR QoS Flow in the
source access.
\- In step 4, when the V-SMF establishes user plane resources for a QoS flows,
the V-SMF provides QoS profile to the AN as follows:
\- for Non-GBR QoS Flow, steps 4 to 9 are performed over each access for which
the MA PDU Session is established.
\- for GBR QoS Flow allowed in a single access, steps 4 to 9 are performed in
the allowed access.
\- for GBR QoS Flow allowed in both accesses, steps 4 to 9 are performed in
the access according to the decision by the SMF (as described in clause 5.32.4
of TS 23.501 [2]).
\- In step 4, if the H-SMF provides updated ATSSS rules, the V-SMF includes
the updated ATSSS rules in the N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification
Command). When the V-SMF provides N1 SM container and/or N2 SM information,
the V-SMF includes access type in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
to provide routing information to the AMF.
The description of signalling flow for a MA PDU Session Modification when the
UE is registered to different PLMNs over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and
the PDU Session Anchor (PSA) is located in the HPLMN, is based on above
procedure with the following differences and clarifications:
\- The description of (V-)SMF providing QoS profile to the AN is not
applicable and instead the regular procedures for QoS profile provisioning
from (V-)SMF to (R)AN applies.
### 4.22.9 Connection, Registration and Mobility Management procedures
#### 4.22.9.1 Registration procedures
The signalling flow for a Registration is based on the signalling flow in
Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 with the following differences and clarifications:
\- In step 1, if the UE wants to re-activate the user plane of the MA PDU
Session(s) over the access the Registration message is sent to, the UE
indicates PDU Session ID(s) of the MA PDU Session(s) in the List Of PDU
Sessions To Be Activated.
If the UE locally releases the MA PDU Session(s) in both accesses, the UE
indicates it in the PDU Session Status. If the AMF receives the PDU Session
Status and finds mismatch, regardless of roaming mode of the MA PDU Session(s)
(i.e. non-roaming, local breakout roaming, home routed roaming in the same
PLMN or home routed roaming in different PLMNs), the AMF invokes
Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service towards the SMF(s) in order to
release any network resources related to the MA PDU Session(s).
\- In step 4, the old AMF determines whether the new AMF support ATSSS or not
based on the supported features provided by the new AMF.
\- In step 5, if the old AMF determined in step 4 that the new AMF does not
support ATSSS, the old AMF does not include the PDU Session context of the MA
PDU Session(s) in the UE context transferred to the new AMF.
\- If the old AMF has not included MA PDU Session(s) in the UE context in step
5, the old AMF informs the corresponding SMF(s) to release the MA PDU
Session(s) by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation
as described in clause 4.22.10.
\- In step 21, the AMF provides an MA PDU Session Support indicator in
Registration Accept message to inform the UE whether ATSSS is supported or
not. The UE uses this indicator to determine whether an MA PDU session related
procedure can be initiated or not, as described in clause 4.22.1.
In step 17, if the UE indicated to re-activate MA PDU Session(s) in the List
Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated the AMF includes access type which the
Registration Request message is received on when the AMF triggers
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation. The SMF only re-activates
user plane resources of the access type the Registration Request message is
received on.
\- In step 22, if the AMF indicates that the PDU Session(s) has been released
in the PDU Session Status to the UE in Registration Accept message, the UE
removes locally any internal resources related to the MA PDU Session(s) that
are not marked as established.
#### 4.22.9.2 UE Triggered Service Request
The signalling flow for a UE Triggered Service Request is based on the
signalling flow in Figure 4.2.3.2-1 with the following differences and
clarifications:
\- In step 1, if the UE wants to re-activate the user plane of the MA PDU
Session(s) over the access the Service Request message is sent to, the UE
indicates PDU Session ID(s) of the MA PDU Session(s) in the List Of PDU
Sessions To Be Activated.
If the UE locally releases the MA PDU Session(s), the UE indicates it in the
PDU Session Status. If the AMF receives the PDU Session Status and finds
mismatch, regardless of roaming mode of the MA PDU Session (i.e. non-roaming,
local breakout roaming, home routed roaming in the same PLMN or home routed
roaming in different PLMNs), the AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext
service towards the SMF(s) in order to release any network resources related
to the MA PDU Session(s).
In step 4, if the UE indicated to re-activate MA PDU Session(s) in the List Of
PDU Sessions To Be Activated the AMF includes access type which the Service
Request message is received on when the AMF triggers
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation. The SMF only re-activates
user plane resources of the access type the Service Request message is
received on.
\- In step 12, if the AMF indicates that the PDU Session(s) has been released
in the PDU Session Status to the UE in Service Accept message, the UE removes
locally any internal resources related to the MA PDU Session(s) that are not
marked as established.
NOTE: For an MA PDU session established when UE was registered on only one
access, during the registration on the second access, the AMF does not notify
the SMF (for this MA PDU session) that the UE is now registered on the second
access since this will occur later, i.e. when the UE sends the second PDU
Session Establishment Request to add user plane resources.
#### 4.22.9.3 N2 based handover
Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover, as described in clauses 4.9.1.3.2 and
4.9.1.3.3, is supported for the 3GPP access with the differences and
clarifications described below.
\- In step 2 of clause 4.9.1.3.2, the S-AMF determines whether or not the
T-AMF supports ATSSS based on the supported features of the T-AMF provided by
NRF or based on local configuration.
\- In step 3 of clause 4.9.1.3.2, if the S-AMF determined in step 2 that the
T-AMF does not support ATSSS, the S-AMF does not include the PDU Session
context of the MA PDU Session(s) in the UE context transferred to the T-AMF.
\- After step 6a of clause 4.9.1.3.3, if the S-AMF has not included MA PDU
Session(s) in the UE context in step 3 of clause 4.9.1.3.2, the S-AMF informs
the corresponding SMF(s) to release the MA PDU Session(s) by invoking the
Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation as described in clause
4.22.10.
#### 4.22.9.4 Network Triggered Service Request
The signalling flow for a Network Triggered Service Request is based on the
signalling flow in Figure 4.2.3.3-1 with the following differences and
clarifications:
\- In step 3a, the SMF indicates to the AMF the access type (3GPP access or
non-3GPP access) over which the user plane resources are to be activated for
the MA PDU Session.
\- In step 4, the AMF considers the MA PDU Session is associated with the
access type the SMF has indicated in step 3a.
\- In step 5, if the SMF requested to re-activate user-plane resources over
3GPP access and the AMF has determined the UE is unreachable over 3GPP access
(e.g. the AMF receives no response from the UE to the Paging), the AMF shall
notify that the UE is unreachable. The (H-) SMF shall indicate the Anchor UPF
that the user-plane resources on 3GPP access is unavailable by triggering N4
Session Modification procedure. Further action by the UPF is implementation
dependent.
If the SMF requested to re-activate the user-plane resources over non-3GPP
access and the AMF has determined the UE is unreachable over non-3GPP access
(e.g. the UE is in CM-IDLE on non-3GPP access), the AMF shall reject the
request from the SMF. The (H-) SMF shall indicate the Anchor UPF that the
user-plane resources on non-3GPP access is unavailable by triggering N4
Session Modification procedure. Further action by the UPF is implementation
dependent.
NOTE: The provision of access availability/unavailability reports via user
plane specified in clause 5.32.5.3 is UE implementation dependent. Such
reporting by UE to UPF, can assist Anchor UPF to decide on handling DL traffic
for the UE.
### 4.22.10 MA PDU Session Release
#### 4.22.10.1 General
The MA PDU Session Release procedure is used to release the MA PDU Session, or
release the MA PDU Session over a single access. The MA PDU Session Release
over a single access may be triggered by the network due to e.g. when the UE
is deregistered over an access or when the S-NSSAI of the MA PDU Session is no
longer in the Allowed NSSAI over an access.
#### 4.22.10.2 UE or network requested MA PDU Session Release (non-roaming and
roaming with local breakout)
The signalling flow for a MA PDU Session Release when the UE is not roaming,
or when the UE is roaming and the PDU Session Anchor (PSA) is located in the
VPLMN, is based on the signalling flow in Figure 4.3.4.2-1 with the following
differences and clarifications:
\- In step 1, if the AMF needs to release the MA PDU Session over a single
access, the AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation
to request the release of the MA PDU Session over a single access. In this
case, the AMF includes in which access the MA PDU Session should be released.
NOTE: When the SMF received the release request from the AMF, the SMF decides
whether the MA PDU Session is completely released or released over a single
access based on its local policy.
\- In step 1, if the AMF needs to release the MA PDU Session (e.g. locally
released when the UE is CM-IDLE), the AMF invokes the
Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation to request the release of
the MA PDU Session.
\- In step 2a, if the SMF releases the MA PDU Session over a single access,
the SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request (N4 Session ID) message
instead of N4 Session Release message to the UPF(s) of the MA PDU session.
\- In step 2b, the UPF acknowledges the N4 Session Modification Request by the
transmission of an N4 Session Modification Response (N4 Session ID) message to
the SMF.
\- In step 3, the SMF sends the PDU Session Release Command message to release
the MA PDU session over a single access (either 3GPP access or non-3GPP
access) or both accesses.
\- In step 3, if the SMF releases the MA PDU Session over a single access, the
SMF shall not include \"skip indicator\" in the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service.
\- In step 3, if the SMF releases the MA PDU Session over both accesses and
user plane resources are established in both accesses, the SMF includes both
N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command) and N2 SM Resource Release
request together in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext or
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service so that the UE does not request
to activate user plane resources. The SMF releases user plane resources of the
other access by including N2 SM Resource Release only in
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service.
\- In step 3, when the SMF provides N1 SM container and/or N2 SM information,
the SMF includes access type in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to
provide routing information to the AMF.
\- In step 11, the SMF triggers Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify service
only when the MA PDU Session is released in both accesses.
#### 4.22.10.3 UE or network requested MA PDU Session Release (home-routed
roaming)
The signalling flow for a MA PDU Session Release when the UE is registered to
the same VPLMN over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and the PDU Session Anchor
(PSA) is located in the HPLMN, is based on the signalling flow in Figure
4.3.4.3-1 with the following differences and clarifications:
\- In step 1, if the V-AMF needs to release the MA PDU Session over a single
access, the V-AMF may invoke the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service
operation to request the release of the MA PDU Session over a single access.
In this case, the AMF shall include in which access the MA PDU Session should
be released. The V-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation to
request the release of the MA PDU Session over a single access. The V-SMF
shall include in which access the MA PDU Session should be released.
NOTE: When the H-SMF received the release request from the V-SMF, the H-SMF
decides whether the MA PDU Session is released or released over a single
access based on its local policy.
\- In step 1, if the V-AMF needs to release the MA PDU Session (e.g. locally
released when the UE is CM-IDLE), the AMF invokes the
Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation to request the release of
the MA PDU Session. The V-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Release service
operation to request the release of the MA PDU Session.
\- In steps 2a-2b, if the SMF releases the MA PDU Session over a single
access, these steps are the same as steps 2a-2b in clause 4.22.10.2.
\- In step 3a, the H-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation
towards the V-SMF to release the MA PDU session over a single access (either
3GPP access or non-3GPP access) or both accesses.
\- In step 5, the V-SMF sends the PDU Session Release Command message to
release the MA PDU session over a single access (either 3GPP access or
non-3GPP access) or both accesses.
\- In step 5, if the V-SMF releases the MA PDU Session over a single Access
Network, the V-SMF shall not include \"skip indicator\" in the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service.
\- In step 5, if the V-SMF releases the MA PDU Session over both accesses and
user plane resources are established in both accesses, the V-SMF includes both
N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command) and N2 SM Resource Release
request together in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext or
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service so that the UE does not request
to activate user plane resources. The V-SMF releases user plane resources of
the other access by including N2 SM Resource Release only in
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service.
\- In step 5, when the V-SMF provides N1 SM container and/or N2 SM
information, the V-SMF includes access type in the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to provide routing information to the
V-AMF.
\- In step 16, the H-SMF triggers Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify service only
when the MA PDU Session is released in both accesses. The V-SMF triggers
Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify service only when the MA PDU Session is
released in both accesses.
The signalling flow for a MA PDU Session Release when the UE is registered to
the different PLMNs over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and the PDU Session
Anchor (PSA) is located in the HPLMN, is based on the above procedure with the
following differences and clarifications:
\- In step 1a, the (V-)AMF can trigger the MA PDU session release over a
single access or over both accesses as described in step 1 of clause
4.22.10.2.
\- In step 3a, the H-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation
towards the V-SMF to release the MA PDU Session over a single access (either
3GPP access or non-3GPP access) or both accesses.
If the UE is registered to the HPLMN via an access and the H-SMF releases MA
PDU Session over the access, the H-SMF invokes
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.
\- In step 5, the V-SMF releases the MA PDU Session over the access the H-SMF
indicated in step 3a.
## 4.23 Support of deployments topologies with specific SMF Service Areas
### 4.23.1 General
This clause captures changes to 5GC procedures in other clauses of this
specification and new procedures to support deployments topologies with
specific SMF Service Areas that are defined in clause 5.34 of TS 23.501 [2].
For a Home Routed PDU Session, if a UE moves out of V-SMF serving area in the
serving PLMN or a UE moves to another (serving) VPLMN, the V-SMF can change.
In addition, V-SMF insertion/removal may take place at mobility between HPLMN
and a VPLMN, in which case the PDU Session is Home Routed when served by the
VPLMN. In these cases, the procedures below apply for the V-SMF
insertion/change/removal (i.e. by replacing the I-SMF with V-SMF). When an AMF
detects the need to change the V-SMF while the H-SMF does not support V-SMF
change, the AMF shall not trigger the V-SMF change but shall trigger the
release of the PDU Session.
For an established PDU session an I-SMF is inserted if the UE is not in the
SMF Service Area. In this case, when an UE moves from HPLMN to a VPLMN, a
V-SMF is inserted and the I-SMF is removed. For mobility from VPLMN to HPLMN,
an I-SMF is inserted and the V-SMF is removed. The procedures of this clause
apply in this case, i.e. by replacing the target or new I-SMF by a V-SMF for
mobility from HPLMN to VPLMN and by replacing the source or old I-SMF by a
V-SMF for mobility from VPLMN to HPLMN.
If at UE mobility the service area of the SMF does not include the location
where the UE camps and the PDU Session is a MA PDU Session, then the AMF
initiates the release of the MA PDU Session over all accesses served by this
AMF. This applies to following procedures:
\- Registration as defined in clause 4.23.3,
\- Service Request as defined in clause 4.23.4,
\- Xn Hand-over as defined in clause 4.23.11, or
\- N2 Hand-Over as defined in clause 4.23.7.
For an established PDU Session supporting mechanisms for redundant
transmission defined in clause 5.33.2 of TS 23.501 [2], or for a PDU Session
supporting Time Sensitive Communications as defined in clauses 5.27 and 5.28
of TS 23.501 [2], if the UE moves out of SMF Service Area, the SMF may, based
on local policy, release the PDU Session after the mobility procedure. This
applies to following procedures: Registration procedure, Service Request
procedure, Xn based handover procedure, N2 based handover procedure.
If dynamic CN PDB needs to be configured by the SMF and the I-SMF is involved
in the PDU session, the I-SMF receives the Dynamic CN PDB value as part of QoS
profile from SMF (over N16a) and forwards it to (R)AN via N2 SM message.
### 4.23.2 I-SMF selection
For non roaming or LBO roaming case, the AMF selects an SMF serving the PDU
Session as described in clause 4.3.2.2.3. If the service area of the selected
SMF does not control UPF that can serve the UE location, the AMF selects an
I-SMF as described in clause 5.34.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
For home routed roaming case, the AMF selects V-SMF as described in clause
4.3.2.2.3.2 and reselects V-SMF as described in clause 5.34.3 of TS 23.501
[2].
When the delegated discovery is used, the SCP selects the SMF as described in
clause 5.34.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and in Annex E.
### 4.23.3 Registration procedure
The following impacts are applicable to clause 4.2.2.2 (Registration
procedure) when the UE has established PDU Session(s):
\- Step 5: The UE context transferred from old AMF includes SMF information.
If I-SMF is available for the PDU Session(s), the received SMF information
includes I-SMF information and SMF information.
\- Step 10: The (target) AMF determines whether I-SMF insertion/change/removal
is needed. If the (target) AMF does not have the service area of the SMF(s),
the (target) AMF queries the NRF to get service area information of the
received SMF(s). The (target) AMF determines on a per PDU Session basis
whether a (new) I-SMF needs to be selected based on UE location and service
area of the received SMF information. It includes the following cases:
a. if the received SMF information includes only SMF information and service
area of SMF includes the area where the UE camps, new I-SMF selection is not
needed; or
b. if the received SMF information includes both I-SMF information and SMF
information and service area of I-SMF includes the area where the UE camps,
the I-SMF can be reused; or
c. if the received SMF information includes both I-SMF information and SMF
information and the UE moves into the service area of SMF, the I-SMF removal
process is triggered; or
d. if the received SMF information includes only SMF information and the
service area of SMF does not include the area where the UE camps, the (target)
AMF selects an I-SMF. The I-SMF insertion process is triggered; or
e. if the received SMF information includes both I-SMF and SMF information and
the service area of SMF and I-SMF does not include the area where the UE
camps, the (target) AMF selects a new I-SMF. The change of I-SMF process is
triggered.
\- For each PDU Session, if the UE context retrieved from the old AMF includes
an I-SMF and the (target) AMF determines the I-SMF needs to be changed or
removed, the (target) AMF includes a corresponding indication in
Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate sent to old AMF
\- Step 17: the (target) AMF contacts the SMF/I-SMF (\"cases\" below are same
as for step 10).
For case a), no additional change to step 17 of clause 4.2.2.2.2 is needed for
the update of the PDU Session.
For case b), the SMF in step 17 of clause 4.2.2.2.2 is changed to I-SMF and in
addition, the reference clause 4.2.3.2 is changed to clause 4.23.4.2. If the
AMF has changed, the new AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (SM
Context ID at SMF) towards the I-SMF.
For case c) i.e. for I-SMF removal, the (target) AMF invokes
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext (SM Context ID at SMF) towards the SMF. Steps
from step 10 onwards as described in clause 4.23.4.3 are executed.
For cases d) and e), i.e. for I-SMF insertion or change, the (target) AMF
invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext (PDU Session ID, SM Context ID at SMF)
towards the new I-SMF. Steps from step 3 onwards as described in clause
4.23.4.3 are executed with the following enhancements:.
\- Step 9 (for cases d and e): The N2 SM information is only provided by the
I-SMF to the AMF when N3 tunnel needs to be established (i.e. due to buffered
DL data in old I-SMF/old-I-UPF or AMF has indicated to I-SMF to active user
plane for the PDU session based on List of PDU Sessions To Be Activated
received from the UE).
\- Step 16 (i.e. case c): The N2 SM information is only provided by the SMF to
the AMF when N3 tunnel need to be established (i.e. due to buffered DL data in
old I-SMF/old-I-UPF or the AMF has indicated to the SMF to active user plane
for the PDU session based on List of PDU Sessions To Be Activated received
from the UE).
\- Step 17 is executed when N3 tunnel needs to be established. The NAS message
Service Accept is replaced with Registration Accept (i.e. step 21 in clause
4.2.2.2).
\- Step 17a and 17b is triggered by old AMF towards the old I-SMF based on the
I-SMF change or removal indication received from target AMF, when the timer
(i.e. started in step 5 of clause 4.2.2.2) in old AMF expires.
NOTE: Step 17a is executed by old AMF together with steps 14d and 14e in
clause 4.2.2.2.
\- Steps 18 to 21 (i.e. cases d and e) and steps 22 to 25 (i.e. case c): These
steps are executed if N2 SM information is provided by the I-SMF/SMF in step 9
or step 16 above.
\- Step 21: This step is omitted if step 17 of clause 4.23.4.3 is executed as
described above.
### 4.23.3a Deregistration procedure
The following impacts are applicable to clause 4.2.2.3 (Deregistration
procedures) when the UE has established PDU Session(s):
The V-SMF is replaced with I-SMF and the H-SMF is replaced with SMF.
In step 2, if ULCL/BP is included in the data path, the I-SMF releases the
local UPF (PSA) and includes N4 information in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Release
request.
### 4.23.4 Service Request procedures
#### 4.23.4.1 General
The following two scenarios are considered:
\- The I-SMF is available for the PDU Session and I-SMF is not changed or
removed during the service request procedure. The procedure to support this
scenario is described in clause 4.23.4.2.
\- The I-SMF is inserted, changed or removed during service request procedure.
The procedure to support this scenario is described in clause 4.23.4.3.
When the AMF receives the service request message, for each PDU Session to be
activated based on the service area information of SMF and the location where
the UE camped the AMF determines which procedure is used.
#### 4.23.4.2 UE Triggered Service Request without I-SMF change/removal
When both I-SMF and SMF are available for a PDU session and no I-SMF change or
removal is needed during the service request procedure, the procedure in this
clause is used. Compared to the procedure in clause 4.2.3.2, the SMF is
replaced with the I-SMF and the impacted intermediate UPF(s) are UPFs that are
controlled by I-SMF. Differences are captured below:
\- Steps 6a-6b, these steps are not needed as the CN Tunnel Info of UPF (PSA)
allocated for N9 is available at the I-SMF when the I-SMF is inserted.
\- Step 7a, if a new intermediate UPF is selected, the I-SMF invokes
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (DN Tunnel Info of the new intermediate UPF).
The I-SMF may also include UE location Information, Time Zone RAT type, Access
Type and Operation Type set to \"UP Activate\", if those information is
changed and need to be notified to SMF. If DL Tunnel Info of new intermediate
UPF is received, the SMF provides the DL Tunnel Info of new intermediate UPF
received from I-SMF to UPF(PSA).
\- Step 10, this step does not apply as in this scenario the I-UPF is always
needed.
\- Step 16, if the I-SMF needs to update SMF with e.g. change of UE location
information, change of Time Zone, change of RAT type and/or change of Access
type, the I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to send User Location
Information, Time Zone, RAT type and/or Access Type to SMF. If the I-SMF
invoked Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request in step 7a with Operation Type \"UP
Activate\", the I-SMF also includes an Operation Type set to \"UP Activated\".
If dynamic PCC is deployed and if Policy Control Request Trigger condition(s)
have been met (e.g. change of Access Type, change of UE location), the SMF
performs SMF initiated SM Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause
4.16.5.1 and may get the updated policy.
\- Steps 18a-18b, these steps do not apply as in this scenario the I-UPF is
always needed.
\- Step 21a, this step does not apply as in this scenario the I-UPF is always
needed.
#### 4.23.4.3 UE Triggered Service Request with I-SMF insertion/change/removal
When, as part of a UE Triggered Service Request, I-SMF is to be inserted,
changed or removed, the procedure in this clause is used. It includes the
following cases:
\- the UE moves from SMF service area to new I-SMF service area, a new I-SMF
is inserted (i.e. I-SMF insertion); or
\- the UE moves from old I-SMF service area to new I-SMF service area, the
I-SMF is changed (i.e. I-SMF change); or
\- the UE moves from old I-SMF service area to SMF service area, the old I-SMF
is removed (i.e. I-SMF removal).
If the service request is triggered by network due to downlink data and a new
I-UPF is selected, forwarding tunnel is established between the old I-UPF(if
the old I-UPF is different from PSA) and the new I-UPF to forward buffered
data.
For Home Routed Roaming case, the I-SMF (old and new) and I-UPF (old and new)
are located in Visited PLMN, while the SMF and UPF(PSA) are located in the
Home PLMN. In this HR roaming case only the case of I-SMF change applies
(there is always a V-SMF for the PDU Session).
Figure 4.23.4.3-1: UE Triggered Service Request procedure with I-SMF
insertion/change/removal
1\. Same as the steps 1-3 defined clause 4.2.3.2.
2\. The AMF determines whether new I-SMF needs to be selected based on UE
location and service area of the SMF, if new I-SMF needs to be selected, the
AMF selects a new I-SMF as described in clause 4.23.2.
Case: I-SMF insertion or I-SMF change, steps 3-9 are skipped for I-SMF removal
case.
3\. If the AMF has selected a new I-SMF, the AMF sends a
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request (PDU Session ID, SM Context ID, UE
location info, Access Type, RAT Type, Operation Type) to the new I-SMF. The SM
Context ID points to the old I-SMF in the case of I-SMF change or to SMF in
the case of I-SMF insertion.
The AMF Set the Operation Type to \"UP activate\" to indicate establishment of
N3 tunnel User Plane resources for the PDU Session(s). The AMF determines
Access Type and RAT Type based on the Global RAN Node ID associated with the
N2 interface.
If the UE Time Zone has changed compared to the last reported UE Time Zone
then the AMF shall include the UE Time Zone IE in this message.
4a. The new I-SMF retrieves SM Context from the old I-SMF (in the case of
I-SMF change) or SMF (in the case of I-SMF insertion) by invoking
Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request (SM context type, SM Context ID). The new
I-SMF uses SM Context ID received from AMF for this service operation. SM
Context ID is used by the recipient of Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request in
order to determine the targeted PDU Session. SM context type indicates that
the requested information is all SM context, i.e. PDN Connection Context and
5G SM context.
4b. The old I-SMF in the case of I-SMF change or SMF in the case of I-SMF
insertion responds with the SM context of the indicated PDU Session.
If there is Extended Buffering is applied and the Extended Buffering timer is
still running in old-SMF or old I-UPF, or the service request is triggered by
downlink data, the old I-SMF or SMF includes a forwarding indication in the
response to indicate that a forwarding tunnel is needed for sending buffered
downlink packets. For I-SMF insertion, if I-UPF controlled by SMF was
available for the PDU Session, the SMF includes a forwarding indication.
5\. The new I-SMF selects a new I-UPF: Based on the received SM context, e.g.
S-NSSAI and UE location information, the new I-SMF selects a new I-UPF as
described in clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
6\. The new I-SMF initiates a N4 Session Establishment to the new I-UPF. The
new I-UPF provide tunnel endpoints to the new I-SMF.
If forwarding indication was received, the new I-SMF also requests the new
I-UPF to allocate tunnel endpoints to receive the buffered DL data from the
old I-UPF and to indicate end marker reception on this tunnel via usage
reporting. In this case, the new I-UPF begins to buffer the downlink packet(s)
received from the UPF (PSA).
7a. If the tunnel endpoints for the buffered DL data were allocated, the new
I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (tunnel endpoints for
buffered DL data) to the old I-SMF in the case of I-SMF change in order to
establish the forwarding tunnel. The new I-SMF uses the SM Context ID received
from AMF for this service operation.
7b. The old I-SMF, in the case of I-SMF change initiates a N4 session
modification to the old I-UPF to send the tunnel endpoints for buffered DL
data to the old I-UPF. After this step, the old I-UPF starts to send buffered
DL data to the new I-UPF.
If the old I-UPF receives end marker packets and there is no associated tunnel
to forward these packets, the old I-UPF discards the received end marker
packets and does not send any Data Notification to SMF.
7c. The old I-SMF, in the case of I-SMF change responds the new I-SMF with
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response.
8a. In the case of I-SMF change, the new I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update
Request (SM Context ID, new I-UPF DL tunnel information, SM Context ID at
I-SMF, Access Type, RAT Type, DNAI list supported by the new I-SMF, Operation
Type) towards the SMF. The new I-SMF uses the SM Context ID at SMF received
from old I-SMF for this service operation.
In the case of I-SMF insertion, the new I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Create
Request (new I-UPF DL tunnel information, new I-UPF tunnel endpoint for
buffered DL data, SM Context ID at I-SMF, Access Type, RAT type, DNAI list
supported by the new I-SMF, Operation Type) towards the SMF.
The SM Context ID at I-SMF is to be used by the SMF for further PDU Session
operation, e.g. to notify the new I-SMF of PDU Session Release. If SM Context
ID at the I-SMF exists (i.e. in the case of I-SMF change), the SMF shall
replace the SM Context ID at I-SMF.
The new I-UPF tunnel endpoint for buffered DL data is used to establish the
forwarding tunnel (from old I-UPF controlled by SMF to new I-UPF controlled by
new I-SMF).
If the old I-UPF receives end marker packets and there is no associated tunnel
to forward these packets, the old I-UPF discards the received end marker
packets and does not send any Data Notification to SMF.
The Operation Type is set to \"UP activate\" to indicate that User Plane
resource for the PDU Session is to be established.
8b. The SMF initiates N4 Session Modification toward the PDU Session Anchor
UPF. During this step:
\- The SMF provides the new I-UPF DL tunnel information.
\- If different CN Tunnel Info need be used by PSA UPF, i.e. the CN Tunnel
Info at the PSA for N3 and N9 are different, a CN Tunnel Info for the PDU
Session Anchor UPF is allocated.
\- For I-SMF insertion, if a new I-UPF tunnel endpoint for buffered DL data is
received, the SMF triggers the transfer of buffered DL data to the new I-UPF
tunnel endpoint for buffered DL data.
If the DL tunnel information has changed, the SMF indicates the UPF (PSA) to
send one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N9 tunnel to the old I-UPF
immediately after switching the path to new I-UPF. From now on the PDU Session
Anchor UPF begins to send the DL data to the new I-UPF as indicated in the new
I-UPF DL tunnel information. The UPF (PSA) sends one or more \"end marker\"
packets for each N9 tunnel to the old I-UPF immediately after switching the
path to new I-UPF. If indicated by the new I-SMF in step 6, the new I-UPF
reports to SMF when \"end marker\" has been received. The new SMF initiates N4
Session Modification procedure to indicate the new I-UPF to send the DL
packet(s) received from the UPF (PSA).
8c. The SMF responds to the new I-SMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response
(the DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU Session in the case of I-SMF change) or
Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response (the DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU Session,
Tunnel Info at UPF(PSA) for UL data in the case of I-SMF insertion if it is
allocated in step 8b).
In the case of I-SMF insertion and the PDU session corresponds to a LADN, the
SMF shall release the PDU session after the service request procedure is
completed.
In the case of I-SMF insertion the SMF starts a timer to release resource,
i.e. resource for the indirect data forwarding tunnel.
In the case of I-SMF insertion and the CN Tunnel Info at PSA for N9 is
received in the response, I-SMF provides the CN Tunnel Info at the PSA for N9
to I-UPF via N4 Session Modification Request.
9\. The new I-SMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response (N2 SM
information (PDU Session ID, QFI(s), QoS profile(s), CN N3 Tunnel Info,
S-NSSAI, User Plane Security Enforcement, UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data
Rate), N1 SM Container, Cause)) to the AMF. The CN N3 Tunnel Info is the UL
Tunnel Info of the new I-UPF.
If the PDU Session has been assigned any EPS bearer ID, the new I-SMF also
includes the mapping between EPS bearer ID(s) and QFI(s) into the N2 SM
information to be sent to the NG-RAN.
The new I-SMF starts a timer to release resource, i.e. resource for the
indirect data forwarding tunnel.
Case: I-SMF removal: steps 10 to 16 are skipped for I-SMF insertion or I-SMF
change cases.
10\. If the UE has moved from service area of old I-SMF into the service area
of SMF, the AMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request (SUPI, PDU
Session ID, AMF ID, SM Context ID at I-SMF, UE location info, Access Type, RAT
Type) to the SMF.
If the UE Time Zone has changed compared to the last reported UE Time Zone
then the AMF shall include the UE Time Zone IE in this message.
The AMF Set the Operation Type to \"UP activate\" to indicate establishment of
User Plane resources for the PDU Session(s). The AMF determines Access Type
and RAT Type based, as defined in clause 4.2.3.2.
11a. The SMF retrieves SM Context from the I-SMF by invoking
Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request (SM context type). The SMF uses SM Context ID
received from AMF for this service operation. SM context type indicates that
the requested SM context is all, i.e. PDN Connection Context and 5G SM
context.
11b. The old I-SMF responds with the SM context of the indicated PDU Session.
If there is Extended Buffering is applied and the Extended Buffering timer is
still running in old-SMF or old I-UPF, or the service request is triggered by
downlink data (i.e. the old I-SMF received downlink data notification from old
I-UPF), the old I-SMF includes a forwarding indication in the response to
indicate that a forwarding tunnel is needed for sending buffered downlink
packets from old I-UPF to new I-UPF or PSA (in the case that new I-UPF is not
selected).
12\. The SMF may select a new I-UPF: If the SMF determines that the service
area of the PSA does not cover the UE location, the SMF selects a new I-UPF
based on S-NSSAI and UE location information as described in clause 6.3.3 of
TS 23.501 [2].
13\. If a new I-UPF is selected by SMF, the SMF initiates a N4 Session
Establishment to the new I-UPF. The new I-UPF provides tunnel endpoints to the
SMF. If forwarding indication was received, the SMF requests the new I-UPF to
allocate tunnel endpoints for forwarding data and to indicate end marker
reception on this tunnel. In this case, the new I-UPF begins to buffer the
downlink packet(s) received from the UPF (PSA).
If the new I-UPF is not selected, i.e. the PSA can serve the UE location, the
SMF may initiate N4 Session Modification to the PSA to allocate UL N3 tunnel
endpoints Info of PSA. The PSA provides the UL N3 tunnel endpoints to SMF. If
the forwarding indication was received, the SMF requests the PSA to allocate
the tunnel endpoints for the buffered DL data from the old I-UPF and indicate
the PSA via usage reporting rule to report end marker to the SMF. In this
case, the UPF (PSA) begins to buffer the DL data it may receive at the same
time from the N6 interface. The UPF (PSA) sends one or more \"end marker\"
packets according to the indication from SMF for each N9 tunnel to the old
I-UPF immediately after switching the path to (R)AN. If indicated by the SMF,
the UPF (PSA) reports to SMF when \"end marker\" packet is received. Then the
SMF initiates N4 Session Modification procedure to indicate the UPF (PSA) to
send the DL data received from the N6 interface.
14a. If the tunnel endpoints for the buffered DL data were allocated, the SMF
invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (tunnel endpoints for buffered
DL data) to the old I-SMF in order to establish the forwarding tunnel. The SMF
uses the SM Context ID received from AMF for this service operation.
14b. The old I-SMF initiates a N4 session modification to the old I-UPF and
sends the tunnel endpoints for buffered DL data to the old I-UPF. After this
step, the old I-UPF start to send buffered DL data to the new I-UPF or PSA if
new I-UPF is not selected.
If the old I-UPF receives end marker packets and there is no associated tunnel
to forward these packets, the old I-UPF discards the received end marker
packets and does not send any Data Notification to SMF.
14c. The old I-SMF responds the SMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext
response.
15\. If a new I-UPF was selected by SMF, the SMF initiates N4 Session
Modification toward the PDU Session Anchor UPF, providing the new I-UPF DL
tunnel information. The PSA begins to send the DL data to the new I-UPF as
indicated in the new I-UPF DL tunnel information. If the forwarding indication
was received, the SMF indicates the PDU Session Anchor UPF to send one or more
\"end marker\" packets. The UPF (PSA) sends one or more \"end marker\" packets
according to the indication from SMF for each N9 tunnel to the old I-UPF
immediately after switching the path to new I-UPF. If indicated by the SMF in
step 13, the new I-UPF reports to SMF when \"end marker\" packet is received.
The SMF initiates N4 Session Modification procedure to indicate the new I-UPF
to send the DL packet(s) received from the UPF (PSA).
16\. The SMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response (N2 SM
information (PDU Session ID, QFI(s), QoS profile(s), CN N3 Tunnel Info,
S-NSSAI), N1 SM Container, Cause)) to the AMF. The CN N3 Tunnel Info is the UL
Tunnel Info of the new I-UPF.
If the PDU Session has been assigned any EPS bearer ID, the SMF also includes
the mapping between EPS bearer ID(s) and QFI(s) into the N2 SM information to
be sent to the NG-RAN.
The SMF starts a timer to release the resource, i.e. resource for indirect
data forwarding tunnel.
17\. These steps are same as steps 12 to 14 in clause 4.2.3.2. After step 16,
the Uplink data is transferred from (R)AN via new I-UPF (if exists) to PSA. If
procedure in clause 4.2.3 is triggered together with this procedure, this step
can be executed together with the corresponding steps in clause 4.2.3.
17a. If the step 9 or step 16 was successful response, in the case of I-SMF
removal or change, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request
(I-SMF only indication) to old I-SMF for the release of resources in old
I-SMF. The I-SMF only indication indicates to old I-SMF not to invoke resource
release in SMF.
The old I-SMF starts a timer to release resources, i.e. resource for indirect
data forwarding tunnel.
17b. The old I-SMF responds to AMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext
response.
Case: I-SMF insertion or I-SMF change: steps 18 to 21 are skipped for the
I-SMF removal case.
18\. The AMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (N2 SM
information, RAT type, Access type) to the new I-SMF.
If the AMF received N2 SM information (one or multiple) in step 17, then the
AMF shall forward the N2 SM information to the relevant new I-SMF per PDU
Session ID.
19\. The new I-SMF updates the new I-UPF with the AN Tunnel Info and List of
accepted QFI(s). Downlink data is now forwarded from new I-UPF to UE.
20a. The new I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update request (RAT type, Access
type, Operation Type) to SMF. The SMF updates associated access of the PDU
Session.
The Operation Type is set to \"UP activated\" to indicate User Plane resource
for the PDU Session has been established.
20b. If dynamic PCC is deployed, SMF may initiate notification about new
location information to the PCF (if subscribed) by performing an SMF initiated
SM Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1. The PCF may
provide updated policies. If the PCC rule(s) are updated, the SMF may initiate
a N4 Session Modification procedure to UPF (PSA) based on the updated PCC
rule(s).
20c. The SMF responds with Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response.
21\. The new I-SMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response to AMF.
Case: I-SMF removal: steps 22 to 25 are skipped for the I-SMF insertion or
I-SMF change cases.
22\. The AMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (N2 SM
information, RAT Type, Access Type) to the SMF. The AMF determines Access Type
and RAT Type based on the Global RAN Node ID associated with the N2 interface.
If the AMF received N2 SM information (one or multiple) in step 17, then the
AMF shall forward the N2 SM information to the relevant new I-SMF per PDU
Session ID.
23\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, SMF may initiate notification about new
location information to the PCF by performing an SMF initiated SM Policy
Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1. The PCF may provide
updated policies.
24\. If a new I-UPF was selected by the SMF, the SMF updates the new I-UPF
with the AN Tunnel Info and List of accepted QFI(s), otherwise, the SMF
updates the PSA with the AN Tunnel Info and List of accepted QFI(s).
25\. The SMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response to AMF.
26a. In the case of I-SMF insertion or I-SMF change, upon timer set in step 9
expires and the indirect data forwarding tunnel was established before, the
new I-SMF sends N4 Session Modification request to new I-UPF to release
resources for the forwarding tunnel.
In the case of I-SMF removal, upon timer set in step 16 expires and the
indirect data forwarding tunnel was established before, the SMF sends N4
Session Modification request to the new I-UPF or PSA to release the resource
for the forwarding tunnel.
26b. In the case of I-SMF removal or change, upon timer set in step 17a
expires and the indirect data forwarding tunnel was established before, the
old I-SMF sends N4 Session Release request to the old I-UPF to release
resources for the PDU Session. The old I-SMF releases the SM Context for the
PDU Session. If the old I-UPF acts as UL CL and is not co-located with local
PSA, the old I-SMF also sends N4 Session Release request to the local PSA to
release resources for the PDU Session.
In the case of I-SMF insertion, upon timer set in step 8c expires and the
indirect data forwarding tunnel was established before, the SMF sends N4
Session Release request to the old I-UPF to release the resource for the PDU
Session.
#### 4.23.4.4 Network Triggered Service Request
For network triggered service request procedure, if the procedure is triggered
by downlink packet, the procedure in clause 4.2.3.3 are impacted as following:
\- if the I-SMF is available for the PDU Session, the procedure is triggered
by I-SMF. Correspondingly, the SMF in that procedure is replaced by the I-SMF.
\- The referenced clause 4.4.4 for pause of charging is changed to clause
4.23.14.
\- Step 4a:
\- If I-SMF is not available for the PDU Session and no I-SMF insertion is
needed, no additional change is needed.
\- If I-SMF is available for the PDU Session and no I-SMF change or removal is
needed, steps 12 to 22 in clause 4.23.4.2 is performed where the SMF in that
procedure is replaced by the I-SMF.
\- If I-SMF will be inserted, changed or removed, steps 2 to 25 in clause
4.23.4.3 is performed.
\- Step 6: If the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access, upon reception of
paging request for a PDU Session associated to 3GPP access:
\- If I-SMF is not available for the PDU Session and no I-SMF insertion is
needed, no additional change is needed.
\- If I-SMF is available for the PDU Session and no I-SMF change or removal is
needed, UE Triggered Service Request procedure as defined in clause 4.23.4.2
is performed.
\- If I-SMF will be inserted, changed or removed, UE Triggered Service Request
procedure as defined in clause 4.23.4.3 is performed.
### 4.23.5 PDU Session Management procedure
#### 4.23.5.1 PDU Session establishment procedure
For non roaming or LBO roaming, it includes the following cases:
\- If the service area of the selected SMF includes the current UE location,
the UE requested PDU Session Establishment procedure is same as described in
clause 4.3.2.2.1.
\- If the service area of the selected SMF does not include the current UE
location and the UE does not request for a MA PDU Session, the AMF selects an
I-SMF that serves the area where UE camps. The UE requested PDU Session
Establishment procedure for Home-routed Roaming defined in clause 4.3.2.2.2 is
used to establish the PDU Session. Compared to the procedure defined in clause
4.3.2.2.2, the V-SMF and V-UPF are replaced by I-SMF and I-UPF and H-SMF and
H-UPF are replaced by SMF and UPF(PSA) respectively. Also, only the S-NSSAI
with the value defined by the serving PLMN is sent to the SMF. The I-SMF
provides the DNAI list it supports to SMF and the SMF provides the DNAI(s) of
interest for this PDU Session to I-SMF based on the DNAI list information
received from I-SMF as defined in Figure 4.23.9.1-1 step 1.
This may happen e.g. at PDU Session mobility from non-3GPP access to 3GPP
access as defined in clause 4.23.15.
\- If the service area of the selected SMF does not include the current UE
location and the UE requests a MA PDU Session, then the AMF rejects the MA PDU
Session Establishment procedure.
\- When the delegated discovery is used, the SCP selects the SMF as described
in Annex E.
\- If an I-SMF is selected and the PDU Session supports mechanisms for
redundant transmission defined in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF
rejects the PDU Session Establishment Request.
\- If an I-SMF is selected and the PDU Session supports Time Sensitive
Communications (as defined in clauses 5.27 and 5.28 of TS 23.501 [2]), or if
the PDU session supports redundant transmission defined in clauses 5.33.2.1 or
5.33.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF may, based on local policy, reject the PDU
Session Establishment Request.
For the Home-Routed roaming case, the UE requested PDU Session Establishment
procedure for Home-routed Roaming in clause 4.3.2.2.2 can be reused with the
following change.
\- If the service area of the selected V-SMF does not include the current UE
location and the UE requests a MA PDU Session, then the AMF rejects the MA PDU
Session Establishment procedure.
#### 4.23.5.2 PDU Session Release procedure
For the non roaming or LBO roaming case, the procedure defined in clause
4.3.4.3 (UE or network requested PDU Session Release for Home-routed Roaming)
is used to release the PDU Session, with the V-SMF and V-UPF are replaced by
I-SMF and I-UPF and H-SMF and H-UPF are replaced by SMF and UPF(PSA)
respectively. Also if the ULCL/BP is included in the data path, in step 1 the
I-SMF releases the local UPF (PSA) and includes N4 information in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Release or Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request request
respectively.
For AMF triggers PDU Session Release procedure in Registration procedure (see
step 17 of clause 4.2.2.2.2) and Deregistration procedure (see step 2 of
clause 4.2.2.3.2), if I-SMF is used for the session, the AMF invokes PDU
Session Release operation towards the I-SMF, then I-SMF releases the PDU
Session towards SMF.
#### 4.23.5.3 PDU Session modification procedure
For the non-roaming or LBO roaming case, the procedure defined in clause
4.3.3.3 (UE or network requested PDU Session Modification for Home-routed
Roaming) is used to modify the PDU Session, with the V-SMF and V-UPF are
replaced by I-SMF and I-UPF and H-SMF and H-UPF are replaced by SMF and
UPF(PSA) respectively.
If the QoS Monitoring as defined in clause 5.33.3 of TS 23.501 [2] is
triggered, the following enhancement to clause 4.3.3.3 applies:
\- In step 3, if the SMF determines the need for QoS Monitoring for a QoS flow
according to the information received from the PCF in step 1b, or based on SMF
local policy, SMF includes QoS Monitoring indication and how frequently QoS
Monitoring reporting to be performed, in Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request
message.
\- In step 3, if, according to the information received from the PCF in step
1b, or based on SMF local policy, the SMF determines the need for GTP-U Path
Monitoring as defined in clause 5.33.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF includes
QoS monitoring policy in Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request message.
\- In step 4b, if in step 3 the I-SMF received QoS Monitoring indication and
may receive how frequently QoS Monitoring reporting to be performed in
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request the I-SMF includes the QoS Monitoring
indication and how frequently QoS Monitoring reporting to be performed in N2
SM message sent to the 5G AN.
\- In step 4b, if in step 3 the I-SMF received QoS monitoring policy
indication and may receive how frequently QoS Monitoring reporting to be
performed in Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request, the I-SMF includes such QoS
monitoring policy also to I-UPF for GTP-U path monitoring.
\- In step 15, the I-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response to SMF. The SMF
updates N4 session of the UPF PSA as defined for the case where is no I-SMF.
\- If later on the RAN provides over N2 the QoS Monitoring Result with UL
packet delay information comprising the packet delays of RAN and N3 interface,
the I-SMF forwards this information to the SMF in Nsmf_PDUSession_Update
Request message.
\- I-SMF shall forward monitoring report (for QoS monitoring per GTP-U path)
from I-UPF to SMF.
### 4.23.6 I-SMF Related Procedures with PCF
#### 4.23.6.1 General
This clause provides PCC related details for scenarios including an I-SMF.
#### 4.23.6.2 Policy Update Procedures with I-SMF
Figure 4.23.6-1 shows procedures related to provisioning of PCC rules
containing traffic steering information related to an I-SMF.
Figure 4.23.6-1: Policy Update procedure
In cases where step 1a in figure 4.23.6-1 is triggered in response to PCF
receiving AF request, below steps 3 and 4 are applicable, in addition to those
steps as explained in clause 4.3.6.1.
Step 3: SMF provides to I-SMF with DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU Session
for local traffic steering. If PCC rule changes for traffic offloaded via
ULCL/BP due to the AF request, the SMF provides the updated N4 information to
the I-SMF.
Step 4: The procedure described in clauses 4.23.9.1, 4.23.9.2 and 4.23.9.3,
from step 2 is executed.
#### 4.23.6.3 Reporting UP path change to the AF
Figure 4.23.6.3-1 shows procedures related Reporting UP path change to the AF.
Figure 4.23.6.3-1: Reporting UP path change to the AF
1a. I-SMF indicates that UP path change may occur for the PDU Session via
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request as described in clause 4.23.9; the SMF responds
to the I-SMF.
2\. If early notification has been requested by a PCC rule on behalf of AF as
described in clause 4.3.6.2, then the SMF notifies the AF accordingly by
invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation as described in clause
4.3.6.3. In this case the SMF may wait for further instructions of the AF.
3\. SMF initiates Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request with N4 information to
control the local PSA and ULCL/BP as described in clause 4.23.9.
4\. I-SMF enforces the change of DNAI or addition, change, or removal of UPF
as described in clause 4.23.9.
5 I-SMF answers back to the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update from the SMF.
6\. If late notification has been requested by a PCC rule on behalf of AF as
described in clause 4.3.6.2, then the SMF notifies the AF accordingly by
invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation as described in clause
4.3.6.3.
### 4.23.7 Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover
#### 4.23.7.1 General
The following two scenarios are considered:
\- The I-SMF is available for the PDU Session and I-SMF is not changed or
removed during the inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover procedure. The
procedure to support this scenario is described in clause 4.23.7.2.
\- The I-SMF is inserted, changed or removed during inter NG-RAN node N2 based
handover procedure. The procedure to support this scenario is described in
clause 4.23.7.3.
#### 4.23.7.2 Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover without I-SMF change/removal
##### 4.23.7.2.1 General
When both I-SMF and SMF are available for a PDU Session and no I-SMF change or
removal is needed during inter NG-RAN node N2 handover procedure, the
procedure defined in clause 4.9.1.3.2, 4.9.1.3.3 are used with the following
differences.
##### 4.23.7.2.2 Preparation phase
Compared to the procedure in clause 4.9.1.3.2, the SMF interacting with the
S-UPF, T-UPF, S-AMF and T-AMF is the I-SMF. The difference is following:
\- Step 3: The N14 context exchanged between S-AMF and T-AMF contains the SM
Context ID at I-SMF, or SM Context ID at SMF if I-SMF is not applicable
before.
\- Step 4: The T-AMF determines whether Target I-SMF needs to be selected
based on UE location and service area of the SMF. In this case no I-SMF change
or removal is needed.
\- Step 5: The I-SMF checks whether I-UPF needs to be reallocated, i.e. select
a T-UPF.
##### 4.23.7.2.3 Execution phase
Compared to the procedure for execution phase in 4.9.1.3.3, the SMF
interacting with the S-UPF, T-UPF, S-AMF and T-AMF is the I-SMF. The
difference is as following:
\- Step 10a: If I-SMF is available for a PDU Session and the existing
intermediate S-UPF is re-allocated, i.e. a new T-UPF is selected, the I-SMF
invokes an Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (DL CN Tunnel Info of the T-UPF)
service operation toward the SMF. The SMF sends N4 Session Modification
Request message to PDU Session Anchor UPF, providing DL CN Tunnel Info to the
PDU Session Anchor UPF. The PDU Session Anchor sends one or more \"end
marker\" packets for each N3/N9 tunnel on the old path immediately after
switching the path, the source NG-RAN shall forward the \"end marker\" packets
to the target NG-RAN.
\- Step 10b: The SMF responds with the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response service
operation to I-SMF once the PDU Session Anchor UPF is updated with the DL
Tunnel Info of the T-UPF.
##### 4.23.7.2.4 Handover Cancel
The home routed roaming procedure defined in clause 4.9.1.4 is applied, with
V-SMF replaced by I-SMF.
#### 4.23.7.3 Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover with I-SMF
insertion/change/removal
##### 4.23.7.3.1 General
When I-SMF is inserted or changed or removed during inter NG-RAN node N2
handover, the procedures defined in this clause are used.
##### 4.23.7.3.2 Preparation phase

N3 Tunnel. If I-UPF is used for indirect forwarding, the SMF sends an N4
Session Modification Request to the I-UPF to release the indirect data
forwarding resource.
20b. UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
If UPF(PSA) is used for indirect forwarding, the UPF (PSA) sends N4 Session
Modification Response to SMF.
If I-UPF is used for indirect forwarding, the I-UPF sends N4 Session
Modification Response to SMF.

### 4.23.8 AN Release procedure involving I-SMF
For the AN release procedure, if the PDU Session involves an I-SMF, the
procedure defined in clause 4.2.6 applies with:
\- The SMF and UPF in the procedure replaced by the I-SMF and I-UPF.
### 4.23.9 Branching Point or UL CL controlled by I-SMF
#### 4.23.9.0 Overview
The procedures in this clause describe the Addition, Removal and Change of PDU
Session Anchor (PSA2), Branching Point or UL CL controlled by I-SMF. They all
rely on following principles:
1\. When a (new) I-SMF is inserted (e.g. as described in clause 4.23.7 or
clause 4.23.11), the I-SMF provides the DNAI list it supports to the SMF. This
list is assumed to remain constant during the N16a association between the
I-SMF and the SMF for a PDU Session.
2\. Based on the DNAI list information received from I-SMF, the SMF may then
at any time provide or update the list of DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU
Session to I-SMF. This may take place e.g. when the I-SMF provides the DNAI
list it supports or when new or updated or removed PCC rule(s) is/are received
by the SMF as defined in clause 4.23.6. This list of DNAI(s) of interest for
this PDU Session indicates to the I-SMF the list of DNAI(s) candidate for
local traffic steering within the PDU Session.
An indication of whether Multi-homing is possible is also provided to the
I-SMF and the I-SMF uses this information to decide whether multi-homing can
be used for the PDU Session.
3\. Whenever the I-SMF has inserted or removed or changed a local offload
capability the I-SMF invokes a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to indicate to
the SMF the list of corresponding DNAI(s). Based on this indication the SMF
invokes a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to send the corresponding N4
information to the I-SMF.
4\. Then SMF may then at any time invoke a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to
send N4 information to the I-SMF.
5\. The I-SMF may at any time send a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to forward
to the SMF N4 events received from a local UPF; this may e.g. correspond to
traffic reporting.
6\. When source I-SMF is to be removed from a PDU Session (e.g. at I-SMF
change or removal), the SMF issues the N4 information targeting the UL CL/BP
(s) and L-PSA(s) controlled by this I-SMF, including requests to release the
corresponding N4 Sessions.
When the Source I-SMF receives a Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request from
AMF, it initiates a data forwarding timer (if indirect data forwarding
applies) before releasing the resources of the PDU Session. When the Source
I-SMF has received N4 release from SMF, it releases the UL CL/BP (s) and
L-PSA(s) resources either directly if no data forwarding timer is started, or
at the expiry of the data forwarding timer.
When IPv6 multi-homing is used and an I-SMF is removed, the SMF re-configure
the UE to not use the original IP prefix \@L-PSA(s).
#### 4.23.9.1 Addition of PDU Session Anchor and Branching Point or UL CL
controlled by I-SMF
This clause describes a procedure to add a PDU Session Anchor and Branching
Point or UL CL controlled by I-SMF.
Figure 4.23.9.1-1: Addition of PDU Session Anchor and Branching Point or UL CL
controlled by I-SMF
1\. UE has an established PDU Session with a UPF including the PDU Session
Anchor 1, which is controlled by SMF.The I-SMF and an I-UPF controlled by
I-SMF have already been inserted for the PDU Session. Events described in item
1 and 2 of clause 4.23.9.0 have taken place.
2\. At some point, using the list of DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU Session
received from the SMF, the I-SMF decides to establish a new PDU Session Anchor
e.g. due to UE mobility. The I-SMF selects a UPF and using N4 establishes the
new PDU Session Anchor 2 (PSA2) of the PDU Session. During this step:
\- (if needed) the PSA2 CN Tunnel Info of the local N9 termination on the PSA2
may be determined,
\- In the case of IPv6 multi-homing applies to the PDU Session, a new IPv6
prefix corresponding to PSA2 is allocated by the I-SMF or by the UPF
supporting the PSA2.
3\. The I-SMF may select a UPF that will be acting as UL CL or Branching Point
and replace the current I-UPF.
If a new UPF that will act as UL CL/Branching Point is selected (i.e. the
existing I-UPF is replaced), the I-SMF uses N4 establishment to provide the 5G
AN Tunnel Info, the PSA1 and (where applicable) PSA2 CN Tunnel Info to the new
UPF.
NOTE 1: If the Branching Point or UL CL and the PSA2 are co-located in a
single UPF then steps 2 and 3 can be merged.
4\. The I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (Indication of UL CL or
Branching Point insertion, IPv6 prefix \@PSA2, DNAI(s) supported by PSA2, DL
Tunnel Info of the new UL CL/Branching Point, if any) to SMF. Whether the UL
CL/Branching Point and PSA2 are supported by the same UPF is transparent to
the SMF. Multiple local PSAs (i.e. PSA2) may be inserted at one time, each
corresponds to a DNAI and/or an IPv6 prefix in the case of multi-homing.
The I-SMF informs the SMF that a UL CL or Branching Point is inserted, the
I-SMF provides DNAI(s) supported by PSA2 to the SMF. The DL Tunnel Info of UL
CL/Branching Point is provided to SMF if a new UPF is selected to replace
I-UPF in step 3.
In the case of IPv6 multi-homing PDU Session, the IPv6 prefix \@PSA2 is also
provided to SMF.
The SMF performs the Session Management Policy Modification procedure as
defined in clause 4.16.5 to provide the new allocated IPv6 prefix to the PCF.
The SMF may also send a notification to the AF, as described in clause
4.3.6.3.
The DNAI(s) supported by PSA2 may be used by the SMF to determine which PCC
rules are to be applied at UPF(s) controlled by the I-SMF. The SMF
acknowledges the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update from the Iâ€‘SMF
5\. If a new DL Tunnel Info of UL CL/ Branching Point has been provided in
step 4, the SMF updates the PSA1 via N4 with the CN Tunnel Info for the
downlink traffic. Now the downlink packets from PSA1 are sent to UE via the
new UPF which will act as Branching Point/UL CL. The SMF may also update the
forwarding rules in PSA1 if some traffic is to be moved to UPFs controlled by
I-SMF.
6\. The SMF provides I-SMF with N4 information for the PSA and for the UL CL
with a SMF initiated Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (set of (N4 information,
involved DNAI), Indication of no DNAI change, Indication of no local PSA
change)). The SMF generates N4 information for local traffic handling based on
PCC rules and CHF requests that will be enforced by UPFs controlled by I-SMF.
The N4 information for local traffic handling corresponds to N4 rules (PDR,
FAR, URR, QER, etc.) related with the support of a DNAI. This is described in
clause 5.34.6 of TS 23.501 [2]. N4 information for local traffic handling may
indicate information (as the 5G AN Tunnel Info) that the SMF does not know and
that the I-SMF needs to determine itself to build actual rules sent to the
UPF(s). If the rule is applied to the local PSA, the N4 information includes
the associated DNAI.
If the \"Indication of application relocation possibility\" or \"UE IP address
preservation indication\" attributes are included in the PCC rule, the SMF
includes the corresponding Indication of no DNAI change and Indication no
local PSA change respectively.
If the CN Tunnel Info at the PSA1 has changed, the SMF may also provide its
new value.
The I-SMF uses N4 information for local traffic handling received from the SMF
as well as 5G AN Tunnel Info received from the 5G AN via the AMF and local
configuration to determine N4 rules to send to the UPF(s) it is controlling.
7\. The I-SMF updates the PSA2 via N4 providing N4 rules determined in step 6.
It also provides the Branching Point or UL CL CN Tunnel Info for down-link
traffic if the PSA2 and the UL CL/Branching Point are supported by different
UPF(s).
8\. The I-SMF updates the Branching Point or UL CL via N4 providing N4 rules
determined in step 6.
NOTE 2: If the Branching Point or UL CL and the PSA2 are co-located in a
single UPF then step 7 and step 8 can be merged.
9\. The I-SMF Issues a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response to SMF that may include
N4 information received from the local UPF(s).
10\. Steps 6-8 of clause 4.3.5.4 are performed. In the case of IPv6 multi-
homing PDU Session, the SMF notifies the UE of the IPv6 prefix \@PSA2 and
updates the UE with IPv6 multi-homed routing rule via a PSA controlled by the
SMF.
NOTE 3: Step 6 of clause 4.3.5.4 is skipped if the current I-UPF is selected
to act as Branching Point or UL CL.
11\. If a new UPF is selected to replace I-UPF in step 3, the I-SMF uses N4
Release to remove the I-UPF of the PDU Session. The I-UPF releases resources
for the PDU Session.
#### 4.23.9.2 Removal of PDU Session Anchor and Branching Point or UL CL
controlled by I-SMF
This clause describes a procedure to remove a PDU Session Anchor and Branching
Point or UL CL controlled by I-SMF.
Figure 4. 23.9.2-1: Removal of PDU Session Anchor and Branching Point or UL CL
controlled by I-SMF
1\. UE has an established PDU Session with a UPF including the PDU Session
Anchor 1 (controlled by SMF) and the UL-CL/BP and the PDU Session Anchor 2
(controlled by I-SMF). Events described in item 1 and 2 of clause 4.23.9.0
have taken place.
At some point the I-SMF decides to remove the PDU Session Anchor 2 and UL-
CL/BP function, e.g. due to UE mobility.
2\. The I-SMF may select a new UPF acting as new I-UPF and replace the
existing I-UPF which was acting as UL-CL/BP before.
If a new UPF acting as new I-UPF is selected, the I-SMF uses N4 establishment
to provide the PSA1 CN Tunnel Info and (R)AN Tunnel Info to the new I-UPF.
3\. The I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (Indication of Removal of
traffic offload, Removal of IPv6 prefix \@PSA2, DNAI associated with the PSA2,
DL Tunnel Info of new I-UPF, if any) to SMF. Multiple local PSAs may be
removed, in this case, the I-SMF provides for each local PSA to be removal,
the associated DNAI and an IPv6 prefix in the case of multi-homing.
The I-SMF informs the SMF that local traffic offload is removed. In the case
of IPv6 multi-homing, the I-SMF also notifies the SMF with the removal of the
IPv6 prefix \@PSA2.
The SMF issues a SM Policy Association Modification (clause 4.16.5)
corresponding to the IP address allocation/release PCRT(Policy Control Request
Trigger). The SMF may also send a notification to the AF, as described in
clause 4.3.6.3.
4\. If a new UPF that replaces existing I-UPF is selected in step 2, the SMF
updates the PSA1 via N4. It provides the CN Tunnel Info of the new I-UPF for
the downlink traffic. The SMF may update the packet handling rules in PSA1 as
now all traffic is to be moved to PSA1.
5\. In the case of IPv6 multi-homing, the SMF notifies the UE to stop using
the IPv6 prefix corresponding to PSA2. Also the SMF sends IPv6 multi-homed
routing rule along with the IPv6 prefix corresponding to PSA1 to the UE. Based
on the information provided in the Router Advertisement, the UE starts using
the IPv6 prefix (corresponding to PSA1) for corresponding traffic.
7\. The SMF provides I-SMF with N4 information for the local UPF(s) with a SMF
initiated Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request; The N4 information indicates the
removal of the traffic offload rules.
8\. If a new UPF that replaces existing I-UPF is selected in step 2, the I-SMF
releases the old I-UPF. Otherwise the I-SMF updates the existing I-UPF with
new rules in order to remove the UL-CL/BP functionality from that I-UPF.
If a new UPF that replaces existing I-UPF is selected in step 2, the SMF
updates the (R)AN with the new I-UPF CN Tunnel Info.
If the PSA2 is not collocated with UL-CL/BP function, the I-SMF releases it
via N4.
9\. The I-SMF answers to the SMF with a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response SMF
that may include N4 information received from the local UPF(s).
#### 4.23.9.3 Change of PDU Session Anchor for IPv6 multi-homing or UL CL
controlled by I-SMF
This clause describes a change of UL-CL/BP function, e.g. addition of a new
PDU Session Anchor (i.e. PSA2) and release of the existing additional PDU
Session Anchor (i.e. PSA0), via modifying IPv6 multi-homing or UL CL rule in
the same Branching Point or UL CL under controlled by the same I-SMF.
Figure 4.23.9.3-1: Change of PDU Session Anchor for Branching Point or UL CL
controlled by I-SMF
1\. The UE has an established PDU Session with a UPF including the PDU Session
Anchor 1(controlled by SMF) and the PDU Session Anchor 0 (PSA0) and an I-UPF
acting as UL CL or BP (controlled by I-SMF). Events described in item 1 and 2
of clause 4.23.9.0 have taken place.
2\. At some point the I-SMF decides to establish a new PDU Session Anchor and
release the existing PDU Session Anchor e.g. due to UE mobility. The I-SMF
selects a UPF and using N4 establishes the new PDU Session Anchor 2 of the PDU
Session.
In the case of IPv6 multi-homing PDU Session, the I-SMF ensures allocation of
a new IPv6 prefix corresponding to PSA2.
3\. The I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (Indication of Change of
traffic offload, (new allocated IPv6 prefix \@PSA2, DNAI(s) supported by
PSA2), (Removal of IPv6 prefix \@PSA0, DNAI(s) supported by PSA0)) to SMF.
The I-SMF informs the SMF that a change of traffic offload may occur. Multiple
local PSAs may be changed. The I-SMF provides:
\- for each local PSA to be added, the DNAI now reachable and in the case of
multi-homing: the new allocated IPv6 prefix \@PSA2;
\- for each local PSA no more reachable, the DNAI no more reachable and in the
case of multi-homing, the old IPv6 prefix \@PSA0.
4\. The SMF may issue a SM Policy Association Modification (clause 4.16.5)
corresponding to the IP address allocation/release PCRT. The SMF may also send
an \"early\" notification to the AF, as described in clause 4.23.6.3.
5\. The SMF generates the N4 information based on DNAI(s) information received
in step 3.The SMF provides I-SMF with N4 information for the PSA and for the
UL CL with a SMF initiated Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (set of (N4
information, involved DNAI), Indication of no DNAI change, Indication of no
local PSA change)). The information includes N4 information to remove the
traffic offload related to the DNAI(s) that are no more reachable and to
enable the traffic offload related to the DNAI(s) that are now reachable.
6-7. Same as step 7-8 of clause 4.23.9.1
8\. The I-SMF releases via N4 the PSA0 if PSA0 is not collocated with UL
CL/BP, or updates the UL CL/BP to remove corresponding rules if PSA0 is
collocated with UL CL/BP.
9\. The I-SMF issues a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response to SMF that may include
N4 information received from the local UPF(s) including the PSA0.
10\. Same as step 7-8 of clause 4.3.5.4 are performed.
#### 4.23.9.4 Simultaneous change of Branching Point or UL CL and additional
PSA controlled by I-SMF
This clause describes simultaneous change of UL-CL/BP function and additional
PSA, e.g. addition of a new UL CL/BP and PDU Session Anchor (i.e. PSA2) and
release of the existing UL CL/BP and additional PDU Session Anchor (i.e.
PSA0), with target UPF(s) and source UPF(s) are all controlled by I-SMF.
Figure 4.23.9.4-1: Simultaneous change of Branching Point or UL CL and
additional PSA controlled by I-SMF
Comparing to the clause 4.23.9.3, this procedure in addition changes the
source UL-CL/BP by a target UL-CL/BP.
1-2. These steps are the same steps 1-2 in clause 4.23.9.3.
3\. The I-SMF selects a UPF and using N4 establishes the target UL CL or BP of
the PDU Session.
4\. The I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (Indication of Change of
traffic offload, (new allocated IPv6 prefix \@PSA2, DNAI(s) supported by
PSA2), (Removal of IPv6 prefix \@PSA0, DNAI(s) supported by PSA0), DL Tunnel
Info of the new UL CL/Branching Point) to SMF.
The DL Tunnel Info of target UL CL/Branching Point is provided to SMF.
5\. The SMF updates the remote PSA (PSA1) via N4 with the DL Tunnel Info of
the Target UL CL/BP for the downlink traffic.
6-8. These steps are the same as steps 4-6 in clause 4.23.9.3.
9\. Same as step 6-8 of clause 4.3.5.4. The I-SMF updates (R)AN for uplink
traffic.
10-11. The I-SMF releases via N4 the source UL-CL/BP as the source UL-CL/BP is
replaced by the target UL-CL/BP. The I-SMF also releases via N4 the PSA0 if
PSA0 is not collocated with source UL CL/BP ;
12\. This step is the same as step 9 in clause 4.23.9.3.
### 4.23.9a Void
### 4.23.10 CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an
existing PDU Session involving I-SMF
For the CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an existing
PDU Session procedure, if the PDU Session involved I-SMF, the procedure
defined in clause 4.3.7 are impacted as following:
\- The SMF and UPF in the procedure are replaced by the I-SMF and I-UPF.
### 4.23.11 Xn based handover
#### 4.23.11.1 General
This clause describes the Xn based handover with the insertion, reallocation
and removal of I-SMF.
#### 4.23.11.2 Xn based handover with insertion of intermediate SMF
This procedure is used to hand over a UE from a Source NG-RAN to a Target NG-
RAN using Xn interface (in this case the AMF is unchanged) and the AMF decides
that insertion of a new intermediate I-SMF is needed. This procedure is used
for non-roaming or local breakout roaming scenario.
The call flow is shown in figure 4.23.11.2-1.
Figure 4.23.11.2-1: Xn based inter NG-RAN handover with insertion of
intermediate SMF
1\. Step 1 is the same as described in clause 4.9.1.2.2.
2\. For each PDU Session Rejected in the list of PDU Sessions received in the
N2 Path Switch Request, the AMF perform same step as step 2 in clause
4.9.1.2.2.
The rest of this procedure applies for each PDU Session To Be Switched.
3a. The AMF checks if an I-SMF needs to be selected as described in clause
5.34.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
3b. If a new I-SMF is selected the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext
Request (SUPI, AMF ID, SMF ID, SM Context ID, PDU Session To Be Switched with
N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT usage data), UE Location Information, UE
presence in LADN service area) to the new selected I-SMF.
4\. The new I-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request (SM context type, SM
Context ID) to SMF to retrieve the SM Context.
The new I-SMF uses SM Context ID received from AMF for this service operation.
SM context type indicates that the requested information is all SM context,
i.e. PDN Connection Context and 5G SM context. The SM Context ID is used by
the recipient of Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request in order to determine the
targeted PDU Session.
5a. I-SMF to I-UPF: N4 Session Establishment Request (Target NG-RAN Tunnel
Info).
The I-SMF then selects a I-UPF based on UPF Selection Criteria according to
clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. An N4 Session Establishment Request message is
sent to the I-UPF. The target NG-RAN Tunnel Info is included in the N4 Session
Establishment Request message.
5b. I-UPF to I-SMF: N4 Session Establishment Response.
The I-UPF sends an N4 Session Establishment Response message to the I-SMF. The
UL CN Tunnel Info and DL CN Tunnel Info of I-UPF are sent to the I-SMF.
6\. I-SMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request to the SMF (SUPI, PDU Session
ID, Secondary RAT usage data, UE Location Information, UE presence in LADN
service area, DL CN Tunnel Info of the I-UPF, DNAI list supported by the
I-SMF).
The I-SMF provides the DNAI list it supports to the SMF as defined in Figure
4.23.9.1-1 step 1.
Secondary RAT usage data is extracted from N2 SM Information within PDU
Session To Be Switched received from NG RAN.
7a. SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request (DL CN Tunnel Info of
the I-UPF).
The SMF provides the DL CN Tunnel Info of the I-UPF to the UPF(PSA).
If old I-UPF controlled by SMF does not exist and if different CN Tunnel Info
need to be used by PSA UPF, i.e. the CN Tunnel Info at the PSA for N3 and N9
are different, the CN Tunnel Info at the PSA for N9 needs to be allocated. The
CN Tunnel Info is provided from UPF to SMF in the response.
7b. UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
The PDU Session Anchor responds with the N4 Session Modification Response
message after requested PDU Sessions are switched. At this point, PDU Session
Anchor starts sending downlink packets to the Target NG-RAN via I-UPF.
PDU Session Anchor sends one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N3/N9
tunnel on the old path immediately after switching the path, the source NG-RAN
shall forward the \"end marker\" packets to the target NG-RAN.
8\. In order to assist the reordering function in the Target NG-RAN, the PDU
Session Anchor sends one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N3/N9 tunnel
on the old path immediately after switching the path, the source NG-RAN shall
forward the \"end marker\" packets to the target NG-RAN.
9\. SMF to I-SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response(Information for local
traffic steering location, CN Tunnel Info at the PSA for N9, updated CN PDB in
the QoS parameters for accepted QoS Flows).
The SMF may update the CN PDB in the response or using a separate PDU Session
Modification procedure, based on local configuration.
9a. If the CN Tunnel Info at PSA for N9 is allocated, it is included in the
response and the I-SMF provides the CN Tunnel Info at the PSA for N9 to I-UPF
via N4 Session Modification Request.
In the case of I-SMF insertion and the PDU session corresponds to a LADN, the
SMF shall release the PDU session after the handover procedure is completed.
10\. I-SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response (UL CN Tunnel Info
of the I-UPF, updated CN PDB in the QoS parameters for accepted QoS Flows).
The SMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext response to the AMF.
11-13. Steps 11-13 are same as steps 7-9 defined in clause 4.9.1.2.2 with the
following addition:
If a Source I-UPF controlled by SMF was serving the PDU Session, the SMF
initiates Source I-UPF Release procedure by sending an N4 Session Release
Request toward the Source I-UPF.
#### 4.23.11.3 Xn based handover with re-allocation of intermediate SMF
This procedure is used to hand over a UE from a Source NG-RAN to a Target NG-
RAN using Xn interface (in this case the AMF is unchanged) and the AMF decides
that the intermediate SMF(I-SMF) is to be changed. This procedure is used for
non-roaming or local breakout roaming scenario. In the case of home routed
roaming scenario, this procedure is also used except the I-SMF is replaced by
V-SMF.
The call flow is shown in figure 4.23.11.3 -1.
Figure 4.23.11.3-1: Xn based inter NG-RAN handover with intermediate I-SMF re-
allocation
1-3. Steps 1-3 are same as steps 1-3 described in clause 4.23.11.2 except that
in step 2 the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request to source
I-SMF and then the source I-SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to
SMF.
4\. The target I-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request to Source I-SMF to
retrieve 5G SM Context.
5a-11. Steps 5a-11 are same as steps 5a-11 described in clause 4.23.11.2 with
the following difference:
In step 6, the target I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (Secondary
RAT usage data, UE Location Information, UE presence in LADN service area, DL
CN Tunnel Info of the I-UPF, DNAI list supported by target I-SMF) toward the
SMF;
In step 9, the SMF respond with Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response. The SMF may
provide the DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU Session to I-SMF as described in
step 1 of Figure 4.23.9.1-1. The SMF may update the CN PDB in the response or
using a separate PDU Session Modification procedure, based on local
configuration.
Secondary RAT usage data is extracted from PDU Session To Be Switched with N2
SM Information received from NG RAN.
12a. The AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request (I-SMF only
indication) to source I-SMF. The source I-SMF removes the SM context of this
PDU session. An indication is included in this message to avoid invoking
resource release in SMF.
12b. The source I-SMF sends N4 Session Release to release the resource in
source I-UPF. If the source I-UPF acts as UL CL and is not co-located with
local PSA, the source I-SMF also sends N4 Session Release to the local PSA to
release the resource for the PDU Session.
13-14. Steps 13-14 are same as steps 12-13 described in clause 4.23.11.2.
#### 4.23.11.4 Xn based handover with removal of intermediate SMF
This procedure is used to hand over a UE from a Source NG-RAN to a Target NG-
RAN using Xn interface(in this case the AMF is unchanged) and the AMF decides
that removal of intermediate I-SMF is needed. This procedure is used for non-
roaming or local breakout roaming scenario.
The call flow is shown in figure 4.23.11.4-1.
Figure 4.23.11.4-1: Xn based inter NG-RAN handover with removal of
intermediate SMF
1\. Step 1 is the same as described in clause 4.9.1.2.2.
2\. For each PDU Session Rejected in the list of PDU Sessions received in the
N2 Path Switch Request, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request
to source I-SMF and then the source I-SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update
Request to SMF forwarding the failure cause. The SMF decides whether to
release the PDU Session.
The rest of this procedure applies for each PDU Session To Be Switched.
3a. The AMF performs I-SMF selection as described in clause 5.34.3 of TS
23.501 [2] and the AMF decides to remove I-SMF in this case.
3b. The AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request (SUPI, PDU Session
ID, AMF ID, PDU Session To Be Switched with N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT
usage data), UE Location Information, UE presence in LADN service area, Target
NG-RAN Tunnel Info) to the SMF.
4a. [Conditional] SMF to I-UPF: N4 Session Establishment Request (Target NG-
RAN Tunnel Info, UL CN Tunnel Info of the UPF (PSA)).
The SMF may select an I-UPF based on UPF Selection Criteria according to
clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If an I-UPF is selected, an N4 Session
Establishment Request message is sent to the I-UPF. The target NG-RAN Tunnel
Info is included in the N4 Session Establishment Request message.
4b. I-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Establishment Response.
The I-UPF sends an N4 Session Establishment Response message to the I-SMF. The
UL and DL CN Tunnel Info of I-UPF is sent to the I-SMF.
5a. SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request (DL CN Tunnel Info of
the I-UPF if I-UPF is selected, or Target NG-RAN Tunnel Info if I-UPF is not
selected).
The SMF provides the DL CN Tunnel Info of the I-UPF to the UPF (PSA) if I-UPF
is selected.
If an I-UPF is not selected, the SMF provides the target NG-RAN Tunnel Info to
the UPF (PSA). If different CN Tunnel Info need to be used by PSA UPF, i.e.
the CN Tunnel Info for N3 and N9 are different, the SMF retrieves the new CN
Tunnel Info from UPF.
5b. UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
If different CN Tunnel Info needs to be used by PSA UPF, i.e. the CN Tunnel
Info for N3 and N9 are different, the CN Tunnel Info is allocated by the UPF
and provided to the SMF.
The PDU Session Anchor responds with the N4 Session Modification Response
message after requested PDU Sessions are switched. PDU Session Anchor sends
one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N3/N9 tunnel on the old path
immediately after switching the path, the source NG-RAN shall forward the
\"end marker\" packets to the target NG-RAN. At this point, PDU Session Anchor
starts sending downlink packets to the Target NG-RAN via I-UPF.
6a. [Conditional] SMF to I-UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (UL CN Tunnel
Info of the UPF (PSA)).
If the UL CN Tunnel Info of the UPF (PSA) has been changed, the SMF provides
the UL CN Tunnel Info of the UPF (PSA) to I-UPF.
6b. I-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
The I-UPF responds with the N4 Session Modification Response message.
7\. In order to assist the reordering function in the Target NG-RAN, the PDU
Session Anchor sends one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N3/N9 tunnel
on the old path immediately after switching the path, the source NG-RAN shall
forward the \"end marker\" packets to the target NG-RAN.
8\. SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response (UL CN Tunnel Info of
the I-UPF if I-UPF is selected, or CN Tunnel Info (on N3) of UPF (PSA) if
I-UPF is not selected, updated CN PDB in the QoS parameters for accepted QoS
Flows). The SMF may update the CN PDB in the response or using a separate PDU
Session Modification procedure, based on local configuration.
The SMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext response to the AMF.
9\. Step 9 is same as step 7 defined in clause 4.9.1.2.2.
10a. AMF to source I-SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext request (I-SMF only
Indication).
The AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext request to source I-SMF. The
I-SMF only indication is included in this message to avoid invoking resource
release in SMF.
10b. Source I-SMF to source I-UPF: N4 Session Release Request/Response.
The source I-SMF sends N4 Session Release Request to source I-UPF in order to
release resources for the PDU Session.
10c. Source I-SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Response.
The source I-SMF responds to AMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext
response.
11-12. Steps 11-12 are same as steps 8-9 defined in clause 4.9.1.2.2.
#### 4.23.11.5 Xn based handover without change of intermediate SMF
When both I-SMF and SMF are available for a PDU Session and no I-SMF change or
removal is needed during Xn based handover procedure, compared to the
procedure defined in clause 4.9.1.2.2 and clause 4.9.1.2.4 the SMF is replaced
with the I-SMF.
### 4.23.12 N26 based Interworking Procedures with I-SMF
#### 4.23.12.1 General

##### 4.23.12.8.2 UE Triggered Service Request with I-SMF
insertion/change/removal
The following impact is applicable for UE triggered Service Request with I-SMF
insertion in clause 4.23.4.3:
\- In step 8a, when an I-SMF is inserted, if EBI(s) have been allocated before
but the SMF+PGW-C has not prepared the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer, the
SMF+PGW-C requests the PGW-U+UPF to allocate the CN Tunnel for each EPS bearer
for PDU Session(s). PGW-U+UPF allocates the PGW-U tunnel info for the EPS
bearer and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C.
\- In step 8c, the SMF+PGW-C provides also CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer
to the I-SMF.
NOTE: The CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer provided to the I-SMF is to
prepare for UE mobility to EPC network so that the I-SMF does not need
interact with the SMF+PGW-C to get the EPS bearer context(s) at mobility to
EPC.
##### 4.23.12.8.3 PDU Session establishment procedure
The following impact is applicable for PDU Session establishment in clause
4.23.5.1:

allocated and the allocation is successful, the SMF+PGW-C also prepares CN
tunnel info for each EPS bearer and provides it to the I-SMF, see clause
4.23.12.4.
##### 4.23.12.8.5 Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover with I-SMF
insertion/change/removal
The following impact is applicable for Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover
with I-SMF insertion in clause 4.23.7.3.2:
\- In step 7c, at I-SMF insertion, if EBI(s) have been allocated before but
the SMF+PGW-C has not prepared the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer, the
SMF+PGW-C requests the PGW-U+UPF to allocate the CN Tunnel for each EPS bearer
for PDU Session(s). PGW-U+UPF allocates the PGW-U tunnel info for the EPS
bearer and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C.
\- In step 7f, the SMF+PGW-C provides also the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS
bearer to the I-SMF.
##### 4.23.12.8.6 Xn based handover with insertion of I-SMF
The following impact is applicable Xn based handover with insertion of I-SMF
in clause 4.23.11.2:
\- In step 6, at I-SMF insertion, if EBI(s) have been allocated before but the
SMF+PGW-C has not prepared the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer, the
SMF+PGW-C requests the PGW-U+UPF to allocate the CN Tunnel for each EPS bearer
for PDU Session(s). PGW-U+UPF allocates the PGW-U tunnel info for the EPS
bearer and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C.
\- In step 9, the SMF+PGW-C provides also the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS
bearer to the I-SMF.
### 4.23.13 Non N26 based Interworking Procedures with I-SMF
#### 4.23.13.1 General
When UE moves a PDU Session from EPS to 5GS, the AMF determines whether I-SMF
needs to be inserted based on the UE location and the service area of the
SMF+PGW-C.
This clause describes the non N26 based Interworking Procedures with I-SMF
insertion when UE move a PDU Session from EPS to 5GS and I-SMF removal when UE
moves a PDU Session from 5GS to EPS.
This may happen e.g. when the UE moves a PDU Session between an ePDG (over
EPC) and 3GPP access over 5GC;
#### 4.23.13.2 Mobility procedure without N26 interface from EPS to 5GS
At Mobility procedure from EPS to 5GS without N26 interface the procedure
described in Figure 4.11.2.3-1 takes place, with following difference:
\- During step 9 of Figure 4.11.2.3-1 \"UE requested PDU Session Establishment
according to clause 4.3.2.2\", the mechanisms described in clause 4.23.5.1
apply
#### 4.23.13.3 Mobility procedure without N26 interface from EPC/ePDG to 5GS
At Handover from EPC/ePDG to 5GS, the procedure described in Figure 4.11.4.1-1
takes place, with following difference:
\- During step 2 of Figure 4.11.4.1-1 \"UE requested PDU Session Establishment
according to clause 4.3.2.2\", the mechanisms described in clause 4.23.5.1
apply
#### 4.23.13.4 Mobility procedure without N26 interface from 5GS to EPS
At Mobility procedure from 5GS to EPS without N26 interface, the procedure
described in Figure 4.11.2.2-1 takes place, with following difference:
\- During step 14 of Figure 4.11.2.2-1 (SMF+PGW-C initiates release of the PDU
Session(s) in 5GS transferred to EPS), if an I-SMF was involved in the PDU
Session, the same mechanisms than in Home Routed roaming apply (release
according to Figure 4.3.4.3-1) with the SMF playing the role of the H-SMF and
the I-SMF playing the role of the V-SMF.
#### 4.23.13.5 Mobility procedure without N26 interface from 5GS to EPC/ePDG
At Handover from 5GS to EPC/ePDG, the procedure described in Figure 4.11.4.2-1
takes place, with following difference:
\- During step 3 of Figure 4.11.4.2-1 (5GC and NG-RAN resource release), if an
I-SMF was involved in the PDU Session, the same mechanisms than in Home Routed
roaming apply (Figure 4.3.4.3-1 steps 3a-16b) with the SMF playing the role of
the H-SMF and the I-SMF playing the role of the V-SMF.
### 4.23.14 Pause of charging
When I-SMF is involved for a PDU Session, the procedure for pause of charging
in home routed roaming case defined in clause 4.4.4 is applied by replacing
the H-SMF with SMF and V-SMF with I-SMF.
When a Local UPF (PSA) is involved, the SMF stops or starts the usage
reporting including usage reporting at the Local UPF (PSA) via the I-SMF.
For a PDU Session, if charging has been paused previously, in addition to the
conditions for stopping pause of charging as described in clause 4.4.4, the
charging is unpaused in the following case:
\- When the SMF receives Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request from a new I-SMF or
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request from AMF.
### 4.23.15 PDU Session mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP access
In this Release of the specification, deployments topologies with specific SMF
Service Areas apply only for 3GPP access.
At PDU Session mobility from 3GPP to non-3GPP access, an I-SMF may need to be
removed because an I-SMF had been inserted when the PDU Session was served
over 3GPP access.
At PDU Session mobility from non-3GPP to 3GPP access, an I-SMF may need to be
inserted because the TA associated with the UE location over 3GPP requires the
AMF to insert an I-SMF.
### 4.23.16 Handover of a PDU Session procedure between 3GPP and untrusted
non-3GPP access
#### 4.23.16.1 Handover of a PDU Session procedure from untrusted non-3GPP to
3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout)
The following impacts are applicable to clause 4.9.2.1 when a PDU Session is
handover from untrusted non-3GPP to 3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with
local breakout):
\- Step2: The UE performs a PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU
Session ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified clause 4.23.5.1 and an
I-SMF and an I-UPF may be selected and inserted for this PDU. If I-SMF is
selected, in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response the SMF shall include all QoS
information for the QoS Flow(s) applicable to the PDU Session for the target
access so that when sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the
N1 SM container and in the N2 SM information, the I-SMF can include all QoS
information (e.g. QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS Profile(s) in
N2 SM information) for the QoS Flow(s).
#### 4.23.16.2 Handover of a PDU Session procedure from 3GPP to untrusted
non-3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout)
When a PDU Session is handover from 3GPP access with an I-SMF to untrusted
non-3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout), following steps
take place:
1) step 1 of clause 4.9.2.2;
2) step 2 of clause 4.9.2.2;
3) the step 3 in clause 4.9.2.4.2 is executed involving I-SMF instead of
V-SMF, with following differences:
\- Figure 4.3.4.3-1 step 14 involving I-SMF instead of V-SMF:
\- Figure 4.3.4.3-1 step 16a: The SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify
(Release) indicating the release is due to a PDU Session Handover out of the
I-SMF;
\- Figure 4.3.4.3-1 step 16b: the I-SMF invoke the
Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify (Release) indicating the Release is due
to a PDU Session Handover out of the I-SMF: the AMF determines that only the
SMcontext with the I-SMF is to be released but that the PDU Session is not
released.
The steps 2 to 3 above shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved from
3GPP access to untrusted non-3GPP access.
#### 4.23.16.3 Handover of a PDU Session procedure from untrusted non-3GPP to
3GPP access (home routed roaming)
##### 4.23.16.3.1 The target AMF is in the PLMN of the N3IWF
The following impacts are applicable to clause 4.9.2.3.1 when a PDU Session is
handover from untrusted non-3GPP to 3GPP access (home routed roaming) and
target AMF is in the PLMN of the N3IWF:
\- Step2: The UE performs a PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU
Session ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified clause 4.23.5.1. A
different V-SMF and a different V-UPF may be selected for the PDU Session.
If a new V-SMF is selected, in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response the H-SMF
shall include all QoS information for the QoS Flow(s) applicable to the PDU
Session for the target access so that when sending the PDU Session
Establishment Accept, within the N1 SM container and in the N2 SM information,
the V-SMF can include all QoS information (e.g. QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM
container, QFI(s) and QoS Profile(s) in N2 SM information) for the QoS Flow(s)
acceptable according to VPLMN policies.
\- (additional) Step 4: If a new V-SMF and a new V-UPF are selected for the
PDU Session, the step 3a and 14 in clause 4.3.4.3 are performed to release the
resource in the old V-SMF and old V-UPF.
The steps 2 to 4 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved from to
untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access.
### 4.23.16a Handover of a PDU Session procedure between 3GPP and trusted
non-3GPP access
#### 4.23.16a.1 General
The handover of a PDU Session between 3GPP access and trusted non-3GPP access
shall be supported as specified in clause 4.23.16 for all types of handover of
a PDU Session between 3GPP access and untrusted non-3GPP access, with the
following modifications and clarifications:
\- The untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access
point (TNAP).
\- The N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.
\- The reference to clause 4.9.2 is substituted by clause 4.9.3 specifying
handover of a PDU Session procedure between 3GPP and trusted non-3GPP access.
## 4.24 Procedures for UPF Anchored Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation
### 4.24.1 UPF anchored Mobile Originated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT
5GS Optimisation
This clause describes the procedures for Mobile Originated Transport in
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation where the PDU Session is terminated at a
UPF.
Figure 4.24.1-1: UPF anchored Mobile Originated Data Transport in Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
1\. If the UE is CM-CONNECTED it sends a NAS message carrying the ciphered PDU
session ID and ciphered uplink data as payload. If the UE is in CM-IDLE, the
UE first establishes an RRC connection or sends the RRCEarlyDataRequest
message and sends a NAS message as part of this.
The UE may also send NAS Release Assistance Information (NAS RAI) included in
the NAS message. NAS RAI indicates that no further Uplink and Downlink Data
transmissions are expected, or that only a single Downlink data transmission
(e.g. Acknowledgement or response to Uplink data) subsequent to this Uplink
Data transmission is expected.
1a. In the NB-IoT case, during step 1 the NG-RAN, based on configuration, may
retrieve the NB-IoT UE Priority and the Expected UE Behaviour Parameters from
the AMF, if not previously retrieved. Based on such parameters, the NG-RAN may
apply prioritisation between requests from different UEs before triggering
step 2 and throughout the RRC connection. The NG-RAN may retrieve additional
parameters (e.g. UE Radio Capabilities).
2\. NG-RAN forwards the NAS message to the AMF using the Initial NAS message
procedure (if the UE was in CM-IDLE before step 1) or using the Uplink NAS
transport procedure (if the UE was in CM-CONNECTED before step 1). If
RRCEarlyDataRequest message was received in step 1, the NG-RAN includes \"EDT
Session\" indication in the N2 Initial UE message.
The RAI signalled by MAC based on the Buffer Status Report (BSR), see TS
36.321 [56], shall not be used when using Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisations.
3\. AMF checks the integrity of the incoming NAS message and deciphers the PDU
session ID and uplink data.
If a NAS RAI is received from the UE and it conflicts with the Expected UE
Behaviour, the NAS RAI takes precedence.
3a. If the AMF received \"EDT Session\" indication from the NG-RAN in step 2,
the AMF sends an N2 message to the NG-RAN.
a) In the case of NAS RAI with Uplink data and it indicated that Downlink data
was not expected and the AMF does not expect any other signalling with the UE,
the AMF shall
\- either send a NAS service accept in the N2 Downlink NAS Transport message
and include End Indication to indicate that no further data or signalling is
expected with the UE; or
\- alternatively, the AMF sends an N2 Connection Establishment Indication
message including End Indication to indicate that no further data or
signalling is expected with the UE.
b) If the AMF determines more data or signalling may be pending, the AMF sends
an N2 Downlink NAS Transport message or Initial Context Setup Request message
without End Indication.
3b. If 3a was executed, the NG-RAN completes the RRC early data procedure as
follows.
a) For the case of 3a.a) the NG-RAN proceeds with RRCEarlyDataComplete
message. The procedure is completed in step 5.
b) For the case of 3a.b) the NG-RAN proceeds with RRC connection establishment
procedure. In that case, all steps up to step 13 apply.
4\. AMF determines the (V-)SMF handling the PDU session based on the PDU
session ID contained in the NAS message and passes the PDU Session ID and the
data to the (V-)SMF by invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_SendMOData service operation.
If NG-RAN forwarded the NAS message to the AMF using the Initial NAS message
procedure in step 2 and the UE is accessing via NB-IoT RAT then the AMF may
inform the (H-)SMFs whether the RRC establishment cause is set to \"MO
exception data\", as described in clause 5.31.14.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF
may immediately send the MO Exception Data Counter to the (H-)SMF.
If no Downlink Data is expected based on the NAS RAI from the UE in step 1 and
if the AMF is not aware of pending MT traffic, then AMF does not wait for step
7 and continues with step 12.
5\. The (V-)SMF decompresses the header if header compression applies to the
PDU session and forwards the data to the UPF.
The UPF forwards the data to the DN based on data forwarding rule, e.g. in the
case of unstructured data, tunnelling may be applied according to clause
5.6.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
6\. [Conditional] In the non-roaming and LBO case, the UPF forwards available
downlink data to the (V-)SMF, in the home-routed roaming case, the H-UPF
forwards the data to the V-UPF then to the V-SMF.
7\. [Conditional] The (V-)SMF compresses the header if header compression
applies to the PDU session. The (Vâ€‘)SMF forwards the downlink data and the PDU
session ID to the AMF using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service
operation.
8\. [Conditional] The AMF creates a DL NAS transport message with the PDU
session ID and the downlink data. The AMF ciphers and integrity protects the
NAS transport message
9\. [Conditional] The AMF sends the DL NAS transport message to NG-RAN. If NAS
RAI indicated for single uplink and single downlink packets (e.g.
acknowledgment expected) and AMF has determined the data transmission is for
single uplink and single downlink packets, the AMF includes an End Indication
in the DL NAS transport message to indicate that no further data or signalling
is expected with the UE.
10\. [Conditional] NG-RAN delivers the NAS payload over RRC to the UE.
11\. If no further data or signalling is pending and AMF received NAS RAI
indicating single downlink data transmission, then AMF triggers the AN release
procedure (clause 4.2.6) and the procedure stops after this step.
12\. [Conditional] If no further activity is detected by NG-RAN, then NG-RAN
triggers the AN release procedure.
13\. [Conditional] The UE\'s logical NG-AP signalling connection and RRC
signalling connection are released according to clause 4.2.6.
NOTE: The details of the NGAP messages to be used for this procedure are
specified in TS 38.413 [10].
### 4.24.2 UPF anchored Mobile Terminated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT
5GS Optimisation
This clause describes the procedures for Mobile Terminated Data Transport in
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation where the PDU Session is terminated at a
UPF.
Figure 4.24.2-1: Mobile Terminated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation
1\. Downlink data is received by the UPF. If buffering is configured in the
UPF, then the flow continues in step 2a, otherwise the flow continues in step
2f.
2a. [conditional] If this is the first downlink packet to be buffered and SMF
has instructed the UPF to report the arrival of first downlink packet to be
buffered, then the UPF sends a Data Notification to the SMF.
2b. [conditional] The SMF sends a Data Notification ACK to the UPF.
2c. [conditional] The SMF sends a Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability request to the
AMF.
The SMF determines whether Extended Buffering applies based on local policy
and the capability of the UPF. If Extended Buffering applies, the SMF includes
\"Extended Buffering support\" indication in Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability
request.
2d. [conditional] If AMF determines the UE is unreachable (e.g. if the UE is
in MICO mode or the UE is configured for extended idle mode DRX), then the AMF
rejects the request from the SMF with an indication that the UE is not
reachable. If the SMF included Extended Buffering support indication, the AMF
indicates the Estimated Maximum Wait time in the response message. If the UE
is in MICO mode, the AMF determines the Estimated Maximum Wait time based on
the next expected periodic registration timer update expiration or by
implementation. If the UE is configured for extended idle mode DRX, the AMF
determines the Estimated Maximum Wait time based on the start of next
PagingTime Window. The AMF stores an indication that the SMF has been informed
that the UE is unreachable.
2e. [conditional] If the SMF receives an \"Estimated Maximum Wait time\" from
the AMF and Extended buffering applies, the SMF sends a failure indication to
the UPF with an Extended Buffering time and optionally a DL Buffering
Suggested Packet Count. The Extended Buffering time is determined by the SMF
and should be larger or equal to the Estimated Maximum Wait time received from
the AMF. The DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count parameter is determined by
the SMF and, if available, the Suggested Number of Downlink Packets parameter
may be considered. The procedure stops after this step.
2f. [conditional] If buffering is not configured in the UPF, then the UPF
forwards the downlink data to the (Vâ€‘)SMF in non-roaming and LBO cases. In the
home-routed roaming case, the H-UPF forwards the data to the V-UPF and then to
the V-SMF.
2g. [conditional] The SMF determines whether Extended Buffering applies based
on local policy and the capability of the SMF.
If user data is received in step 2f and Extended buffering is not configured
for the SMF, then (V-)SMF compresses the header if header compression applies
to the PDU session and creates the downlink user data PDU that is intended as
payload in a NAS message. The (V-)SMF forwards the downlink user data PDU and
the PDU session ID to the AMF using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
service operation. If Extended Buffering applies, then (V-)SMF keeps a copy of
the downlink data.
If user data is received in step 2f and Extended Buffering applies, the SMF
includes \"Extended Buffering support\" indication in
Namf_Communication_N1N2Message Transfer.
2h. [conditional] AMF responds to SMF.
If AMF determines that the UE is reachable for the SMF, then the AMF informs
the SMF. Based on this, the SMF deletes the copy of the downlink data.
If AMF determines the UE is unreachable for the SMF (e.g. if the UE is in MICO
mode or the UE is configured for extended idle mode DRX), then the AMF rejects
the request from the SMF. The AMF may include in the reject message an
indication that the SMF need not trigger the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Request to the AMF, if the SMF has not
subscribed to the event of the UE reachability.
If the SMF included Extended Buffering support indication, the AMF indicates
the Estimated Maximum Wait time, in the reject message, for the SMF to
determine the Extended Buffering time. If the UE is in MICO mode, the AMF
determines the Estimated Maximum Wait time based on the next expected periodic
registration timer update expiration or by implementation. If the UE is
configured for extended idle mode DRX, the AMF determines the Estimated
Maximum Wait time based on the start of next PagingTime Window. The AMF stores
an indication that the SMF has been informed that the UE is unreachable.
If the SMF receives an \"Estimated Maximum Wait time\" from the AMF and
Extended Buffering in SMF applies, the SMF store the DL Data for the Extended
Buffering time. The Extended Buffering time is determined by the SMF and
should be larger or equal to the Estimated Maximum Wait time received from the
AMF. The SMF does not send any additional
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message if subsequent downlink data
packets are received.
3\. [Conditional] If the UE is in CM Idle, the AMF sends a paging message to
NG-RAN. If available, the AMF may include the WUS Assistance Information in
the N2 Paging message(s).
4\. [Conditional] If NG-RAN received a paging message from AMF and UE and NG-
RAN support WUS, then:
\- if the NGAP Paging message contains the _Assistance Data for Recommended
Cells_ IE (see TS 38.413 [10]), then NG-RAN shall only broadcast the UE\'s
Wake Up Signal in the last used cell;
\- else (i.e. the _Assistance Data for Recommended Cells_ IE is not included
in the NGAP Paging message) NG-RAN should not broadcast the UE\'s Wake Up
Signal.
NG-RAN performs paging. If the WUS Assistance Information is included in the
N2 Paging message, the NG-eNB takes it into account when paging the UE (see TS
36.300 [46]).
5\. [Conditional] If the UE receives paging message, it responds with a NAS
message sent over RRC Connection Establishment.
5a. [Conditional] In the NB-IoT case, during Step 5, the NG-RAN, based on
configuration, may retrieve the NB-IoT UE Priority and the Expected UE
Behaviour Parameters from the AMF, if not previously retrieved. Based on such
parameters, the NG-RAN may apply prioritisation between requests from
different UEs before triggering step 6 and throughout the RRC connection. The
NG-RAN may retrieve additional parameters (e.g. UE Radio Capabilities).
6\. [Conditional] The NAS message is forwarded to the AMF.
7a. [Conditional] AMF to SMF: Namf_MT-EnableUEReachability Response.
If the SMF used the MT_EnableUEReachability request in step 2c and the UE has
not responded to paging then the AMF sends a response to the SMF indicating
that the request failed.
7b. [Conditional] SMF to UPF: If the SMF has received a Namf_MT-
EnableUEReachability response from the AMF indicating that the request failed,
the SMF indicates to the UPF to discard the buffered data and the procedure
stops after this step.
7c. [Conditional] AMF to SMF: Namf_Communication_N1N2Transfer Failure
Notification.
If the SMF used the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation
in step 2g and the UE has not responded to paging, the AMF sends a failure
notification to the SMF based on which the SMF discards the buffered data. The
procedure stops after this step.
8a. [Conditional] AMF to SMF: Namf_MT-EnableUEReachability Response.
If the SMF used the MT_EnableUEReachability request in step 2c, then the AMF
indicates to the SMF that the UE is reachable.
8b. [Conditional] SMF to UPF: N4 Session Modification Request.
If the SMF received an indication from the AMF that the UE is reachable, then
the SMF indicates to the UPF to deliver buffered data to the SMF.
8c. [Conditional] UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.
8d. [Conditional] Buffered data is delivered to the SMF.
8e. [Conditional] (V-)SMF compresses the header if header compression applies
to the PDU session and creates the downlink user data PDU that is intended as
payload in a NAS message. The (V-)SMF forwards the downlink user data PDU and
the PDU session ID to the AMF using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
service operation.
9\. The AMF creates a DL NAS transport message with the PDU session ID and the
downlink user data PDU received from the SMF. The AMF ciphers and integrity
protects the NAS transport message.
10\. The AMF sends the DL NAS transport message to NG-RAN.
11\. NG-RAN delivers the NAS payload over RRC to the UE.
12\. While the RRC connection is established further uplink and downlink data
can be exchanged. In order to send uplink data, the procedure continues as per
steps 1-10 of the UPF anchored Mobile Originated Data Transport in Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation procedure (clause 4.24.1).
13\. If the AMF has paged the UE to trigger the NAS procedure as in step 3-6,
the AMF shall initiate the UE configuration update procedure as defined in
clause 4.2.4.2 to assign a new 5G-GUTI.
14\. [Conditional] If no further activity is detected by NG-RAN, then NG-RAN
triggers the AN release procedure.
15\. [Conditional] The UE\'s logical NG-AP signalling connection and RRC
signalling connection are released according to clause 4.2.6.
NOTE: The details of the NGAP messages to be used for this procedure are
specified in TS 38.413 [10].
## 4.25 Procedures for NEF based Non-IP Data Delivery
### 4.25.1 General
Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) it is a means for delivering data via a PDU
Sessions of type \"Unstructured\". The subsequent clauses describe the
procedures necessary to support NEF based NIDD.
### 4.25.2 SMF-NEF Connection Establishment
When the UE performs the PDU Session establishment with PDU Session type of
\"Unstructured\" and the subscription information corresponding to the UE
requested DNN includes the \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" (NEF ID), then the SMF
initiates a SMF-NEF Connection establishment procedure towards the NEF
corresponding to the \"NEF ID\" for that DNN / S-NSSAI Combination.
Figure 4.25.2-1: SMF-NEF Connection procedure
1\. Steps 1-7 and step 9 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 for UE-requested PDU Session
Establishment Procedure for non-roaming scenarios or steps 1-9 of clause
4.3.2.2.2 for UE-requested PDU Session Establishment Procedure for home-routed
roaming scenarios. The (H-)SMF receives the Session Management Subscription
data for the corresponding SUPI, DNN and S-NSSAI that is associated with NEF
Identity for NIDD and NIDD information such GPSI and AF ID.
2\. If the subscription information corresponding to DNN and S-NSSAI includes
the \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" (NEF ID), the SMF shall create a PDU session
towards the NEF. The SMF invokes Nnef_SMContext_Create Request (User Identity,
PDU Session ID, SMF ID, NIDD information, S-NSSAI, DNN, [RDS support
indication], [Small Data Rate Control parameters], [Small Data Rate Control
Status], [Serving PLMN Rate Control parameters]) message towards the NEF. The
RDS support indication is included if the UE capability to support Reliable
Data Service (RDS) is included in the PCO in the PDU Session Establishment
Request message. The SMF provides Small Data Rate Control parameters to the
NEF for PDU Session, if required. The SMF provides the Small Data Rate Control
Status to the NEF, if received from the AMF. If the Serving PLMN intends to
enforce Serving PLMN Rate Control (see clause 5.31.14.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) for
this PDU session then the SMF shall provide Serving PLMN Rate Control
parameters to NEF for limiting the rate of downlink control plane data
packets.
If no AF has previously performed the NIDD Configuration procedure with the
NEF for the User Identity received in step 2, then the NEF initiates the NIDD
Configuration procedure (see clause 4.25.3) before step 3.
3\. The NEF creates an NEF PDU session Context and associates it with User
Identity and PDU session ID. The NEF invokes Nnef_SMContext_Create Response
(Cause, [RDS support indication], [Extended Buffering Support indication],
[NIDD parameters]) towards the SMF confirming establishment of the PDU session
to the NEF for the UE. If NEF supports and allows use of RDS, it includes the
RDS support indication to SMF and the SMF includes it in the PCO. If NEF
supports Extended Buffering, NEF includes Extended Buffering Support
indication in the response and subscribes for mobility-related events with the
AMF to receive an indication when the UE becomes reachable. The NIDD
parameters (e.g. maximum packet size) are sent to the SMF, if available.
4\. Steps 11-13 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 for UE-requested PDU Session Establishment
Procedure for non-roaming scenarios or steps 13-16 of clause 4.3.2.2.2 for UE
requested PDU Session Establishment Procedure for home-routed roaming
scenarios.
### 4.25.3 NIDD Configuration
Figure 4.25.3-1 illustrates the procedure for configuring necessary
information for data delivery via the NIDD API.
The NIDD Configuration procedure can be NEF initiated or AF triggered: in the
former case the procedure starts at step 1, in the latter case it starts at
step 2.
Figure 4.25.3-1: NIDD Configuration procedure
1\. [Optional] If the NEF requires a NIDD configuration with a given AF, then
the NEF sends a Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_TriggerNotify (GPSI, AF ID, NEF ID)
message to the AF for asking the Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Create Request for the
UE identified by the GPSI.
2\. The AF sends a Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Create Request message (GPSI or
External Group Identifier, AF ID, NIDD Duration, T8 Destination Address,
Requested Action, TLTRI, Reliable Data Service Configuration, MTC Provider
Information) to the NEF.
Reliable Data Service Configuration is an optional parameter that is used to
configure the Reliable Data Service (as defined in clause 5.31.6 of TS 23.501
[2]) including port numbers for originator application(s) and receiver
application(s). TLTRI is included in the request if the Requested Action is
set to \"Update\" or \"Cancel\", otherwise TLTRI is not included in the
request and the NEF assigns a TLTRI to the NIDD Configuration.
NOTE 1: It is up to the AF to determine whether and if NIDD Duration can be
set to never expire.
NOTE 2: The AF is expected to be configured to use the same NEF as the one
selected by the SMF during the UE\'s establishment of the PDU Session used for
NEF based NIDD.
NOTE 3: When more than one AF is associated with a PDU Session, the parameters
that are provided in step 2 can be provisioned in the NEF based on operator
policy or configuration. In which case, any parameters that are provided in
step 2 that conflict with the provisioned values are ignored.
3\. If the Requested Action is set to \"Cancel\" it indicates that the purpose
of the request is to cancel the transaction identified by TLTRI and the flow
proceeds to step 7. If the Requested Action is set to \"Update\", the purpose
of the transaction is to update the parameters associated with the
configuration (i.e. Reliable Data Service). Otherwise, the request is for a
new NIDD configuration and the NEF stores the received GPSI or External Group
Identifier, AF ID, T8 Destination Address and NIDD Duration. If either the AF
is not authorised to perform this request (e.g. based on policies, if the SLA
does not allow for it) or the Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Create Request is
malformed, the NEF performs step 7 and provides a Cause value appropriately
indicating the error. Depending on the configuration, the NEF may change the
NIDD Duration.
4\. The NEF sends an Nudm_NIDDAuthorisation_Get Request (GPSI or External
Group Identifier, S-NSSAI, DNN, AF ID, MTC Provider Information, NIDD
Duration, Update Notification Address) message to the UDM to authorise the
NIDD configuration request for the received External Group Identifier or GPSI.
NOTE 4: The NEF uses the AF ID, External Group Identifier or GPSI that was
obtained in step 2 to determine what DNN will be used to enable transfer of
unstructured data between the UE and the AF. This determination is based on
local policies.
NOTE 5: The MTC Provider Information in step 2 is an optional parameter. The
NEF should validate the provided MTC Provider Information and may override it
to a NEF selected MTC Provider Information based on configuration. How the NEF
determines the MTC Provider Information, if not present in step 2, is left to
implementation (e.g. based on the requesting AF).
5\. The UDM examines the Nudm_NIDDAuthorisation_Get Request message.
If the authorisation is successful and if an External Group Identifier was
included in step 4, the UDM maps the External Group Identifier to an Internal-
Group Identifier and a list of GPSIs and maps GPSIs to SUPIs.
NOTE 6: If External Group Identifier was included in step 4, how the UDM
selects a GPSI when multiple GPSIs are associated with the same SUPI is left
to implementation, e.g. based on the MTC Provider Information (if received) or
the default GPSI (if not received).
6\. The UDM sends an Nudm_NIDDAuthorisation_Get Response (single value or list
of (SUPI and GPSI), Result) message to the NEF to acknowledge acceptance of
the Nudm_NIDDAuthorisation_Get Request. If the UDM determines that the list
size exceeds the message capacity, the UDM shall segment the list and send it
in multiple messages (for details on segmentation, see TS 29.503 [52]). The
SUPI(s) and, if available, the GPSI(s) (when Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Create
Request contains an GPSI) are returned by the UDM in this response. This
allows the NEF to correlate the AF request received in step 2 of this
procedure with the SMF-NEF Connection to be established for each UE or each
group member UE. Depending on the configuration (e.g. based on DNN), the UDM
may change the NIDD Duration and include the updated value of the NIDD
Duration in the response to the NEF.
7\. The NEF sends a Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Create Response (TLTRI, Maximum
Packet Size, Reliable Data Service Indication and Cause) message to the AF to
acknowledge acceptance of the Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Create Request. If the
NIDD Configuration was accepted, the NEF assigns a TLTRI to the NIDD
Configuration and sends it to the AF. The NEF creates an association between
the TLTRI, GPSI or External Group Identifier, SUPI and PDU session ID which is
received from the SMF in step 2 of the SMF-NEF Connection procedure in clause
4.25.1. In the MT NIDD procedure, the NEF will use TLTRI and either GPSI or
External Group Identifier to determine the SUPI(s) and PDU session ID(s) of
PDU Session(s) for delivering unstructured data. In the MO NIDD procedure, the
NEF will use the SUPI(s) and PDU session ID(s) to obtain the TLTRI, GPSI. The
Reliable Data Service Indication indicates if the Reliable Data Service is
enabled in the NIDD configuration. The Maximum Packet Size is the maximum NIDD
packet size. The response may include an updated value of the NIDD Duration.
### 4.25.4 NEF Anchored Mobile Originated Data Transport
Figure 4.25.4-1 illustrates the NEF Anchored Mobile Originated Data Transport
procedure.
Figure 4.25.4-1: NEF Anchored Mobile Originated Data Transport procedure
1\. The UE sends a NAS message with unstructured data according to steps 1-4
of the procedure for UPF anchored Mobile Originated Data Transport in Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation (see clause 4.24.1). The Reliable Data Service
header is included if the Reliable Data Service is enabled.
2\. [Conditional] In the case of home-routed roaming the V-SMF sends the
Nsmf_PDUSession_TransferMOData request to the H-SMF including MO small data.
3\. The (H-)SMF sends the Nnef_SMContext_Delivery Request (User Identity, PDU
session ID, unstructured data) message to the NEF.
4\. When the NEF receives the unstructured data and finds an NEF PDU Session
context and the related T8 Destination Address, then it sends the unstructured
data to the AF that is identified by the T8 Destination address in a
Nnef_NIDD_DeliveryNotify Request (GPSI, unstructured data, Reliable Data
Service Configuration). If no T8 Destination address is associated with the
UE\'s PDN connection, the data is discarded, the Nnef_NIDD_DeliveryNotify
Request is not sent and the flow continues at step 6. The Reliable Data
Service Configuration is used to provide the AF with additional information
such as indicate if an acknowledgement was requested and port numbers for
originator application and receiver application, when the Reliable Data
Service is enabled.
Editor\'s note: It is left to Stage 3 whether or not the NEF aggregates
Nnef_NIDD_DeliveryNotify Request messages to the AF.
5\. The AF responds to the NEF with a Nnef_NIDD_DeliveryNotify Response
(Cause).
6\. The NEF sends Nnef_SMContext_Delivery Response to the SMF. If the NEF
cannot deliver the data, e.g. due to missing AF configuration, the NEF sends
an appropriate error code to the SMF.
7\. [Conditional] In the case of home-routed roaming, the H-SMF responds to
the V-SMF with a Nsmf_PDUSession_TransferMOData (Result Indication) Response.
### 4.25.5 NEF Anchored Mobile Terminated Data Transport
Figure 4.25.5-1 illustrates the procedure using which the AF sends
unstructured data to a given user as identified via External Identifier or
MSISDN.
Figure 4.25.5-1: NEF Anchored Mobile Terminated Data Transport
1a. If AF has already activated the NIDD service for a given UE and has
downlink unstructured data to send to the UE, the AF sends a
Nnef_NIDD_Delivery Request (GPSI, TLTRI, unstructured data, Reliable Data
Service Configuration) message to the NEF. Reliable Data Service Configuration
is an optional parameter that is used to configure the Reliable Data Service,
it may be used to indicate if a Reliable Data Service acknowledgement is
requested and port numbers for originator application and receiver
application.
1b. AMF indicates to NEF that the UE has become reachable. Based on this the
NEF re-starts delivering buffered unstructured data to the UE.
2\. The NEF determines the 5GS QoS Flow Context based on the DNN associated
with the NIDD configuration and the User Identity. If an NEF 5GS QoS Flow
Context corresponding to the GPSI included in step 1 is found, then the NEF
checks if the AF is authorised to send data and if it does not exceed its
quota or rate. If these checks fail, then steps 3-15 are skipped and an
appropriate error code is returned in step 17.
3\. The NEF forwards the unstructured data to the (H-)SMF using
Nsmf_NIDD_Delivery Request. If NEF has indicated support of Extended Buffering
in Nnef_SMContext_Create Response during SMF-NEF connection establishment,
then NEF keeps a copy of the data.
4\. In the roaming case, the H-SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_TransferMTData to
the V-SMF including MT small data.
5\. The (V-)SMF determines whether Extended Buffering applies based on local
policy and based on whether NEF has indicated support of Extended Buffering in
Nnef_SMContext_Create Response during SMF-NEF connection establishment.
(V-)SMF compresses the header if header compression applies and forwards the
data and the PDU session ID to the AMF using the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation. If Extended
Buffering applies, then (V-SMF) includes \"Extended Buffering support\"
indication in Namf_Communication_N1N2Message Transfer.
6\. If AMF determines the UE is unreachable for the SMF (e.g. if the UE is in
MICO mode or the UE is configured for extended idle mode DRX), then the AMF
rejects the request from the SMF. The AMF may include in the reject message an
indication that the SMF need not trigger the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Request to the AMF, if the SMF has not
subscribed to the event of UE reachability.
If the SMF included Extended Buffering support indication, the AMF indicates
the Estimated Maximum Wait time, in the reject message, for the SMF to
determine the Extended Buffering time. If the UE is in MICO mode, the AMF
determines the Estimated Maximum Wait time based on the next expected periodic
registration timer update expiration or by implementation. If the UE is
configured for extended idle mode DRX, the AMF determines the Estimated
Maximum Wait time based on the start of next PagingTime Window. The AMF stores
an indication that the SMF has been informed that the UE is unreachable.
7\. In the roaming case V-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_TransferMTData (Result
Indication) response to H-SMF. If the V-SMF receives an \"Estimated Maximum
Wait time\" from the AMF and Extended Buffering applies, the V-SMF also passes
the \"Estimated Maximum Wait time\" to the H-SMF.
8\. If the (H-)SMF receives a failure indication, (H-)SMF also sends a failure
indication to NEF. If (H-)SMF has received the \"Estimated Maximum Wait time\"
and Extended Buffering applies, the (H-)SMF includes Extended Buffering time
in the failure indication. The Extended Buffering time is determined by the
(H-)SMF and should be larger or equal to the Estimated Maximum Wait time. The
NEF stores the DL data for the Extended Buffering time. The NEF does not send
any additional Nsmf_NIDD_Delivery Request message if subsequent downlink data
packets are received. The procedures stop at this step.
9\. If the AMF determines the UE to be reachable in Step 5, then Steps 3 to 6
of the UPF anchored Mobile Terminated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation procedure (clause 4.24.2) apply.
If the Reliable Data Service header indicates that the acknowledgement is
requested, then the UE shall respond with an acknowledgement to the DL data
that was received.
10\. If the AMF has paged the UE to trigger the NAS procedure in step 9, the
AMF shall initiate the UE configuration update procedure as defined in clause
4.2.4.2 to assign a new 5G-GUTI.
11\. If the UE has not responded to paging, the AMF sends a failure
notification to the (V-)SMF. Otherwise the procedure continues at step 13.
12\. In the roaming case, if V-SMF has received a failure notification from
AMF, then V-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_TransferMTData (Result Indication)
response to H-SMF.
13\. If (H-)SMF receives a failure notification, then SMF indicates to the NEF
that the requested Nsmf_NIDD_Delivery has failed. If Extended Buffering
applies, then NEF purges the copy of the data. The procedure continues at step
17.
14\. Steps 9 to 11 of the UPF anchored Mobile Terminated Data Transport in
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation procedure (clause 4.24.2) apply.
15\. AMF informs (V-)SMF that data has been forwarded.
16\. In the roaming case, V-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_TransferMTData (Result
Indication) response to H-SMF that the data has been forwarded.
17\. (H-)SMF indicates to NEF that the data has been forwarded. If Extended
Buffering applies then NEF purges the copy of the data.
18\. The NEF sends a Nnef_NIDD_Delivery Response (cause) to the AF.
The Reliable Data Service Acknowledgement Indication is used to indicate if an
acknowledgement was received from the UE for the MT NIDD. If the Reliable Data
Service was requested in step 1, then the Nnef_NIDD_Delivery Response is sent
to the AF after the acknowledgement is received from the UE or, if no
acknowledgment is received, then the Nnef_NIDD_Delivery Response is sent to
the AF with a cause value indicating that no acknowledgement was received.
### 4.25.6 NIDD Authorization Update
Figure 4.25.6-1 illustrates the procedure for updating or revoking an existing
NIDD Authorization.
The UDM may initiate the NIDD Authorization Update procedure with the NEF to
send updated Authorization information to the NEF.
Figure 4.25.6-1: NIDD Authorization Update procedure
0\. UDM provided a successful authorization for a NIDD configuration request
as defined in clause 4.25.3. The NIDD authorization is modified in UDM (e.g.
subscription withdrawal, DNN used for NIDD service is removed from the UE
subscription) before expiration of the NIDD Duration previously authorized.
1\. The UDM sends an NIDD Authorization Update information using
Nudm_NIDDAuthorisation_UpdateNotify Request (SUPI, GPSI, S-NSSAI, DNN, Result,
Cause, NIDD Duration) message to the NEF to update an user\'s NIDD
authorization.
2\. The NEF sends Nudm_NIDDAuthorisation_UpdateNotify Response message to the
UDM to acknowledge the authorization update.
3\. If the authorization is removed, the NEF should initiate the SMF-NEF
Connection release procedure as specified in the clause 4.25.8.
4\. The NEF informs the AF that the user\'s authorisation status has changed
by sending Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_UpdateNotify Request (GPSI, TLTRI, Result,
Cause, NIDD Duration) message to the AF to update a user\'s NIDD
authorization.
5\. The AF responds to the NEF with Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_UpdateNotify
Response message.
### 4.25.7 SMF Initiated SMF-NEF Connection Release procedure
When the PDU Session Release is initiated and if a NEF has been selected as
anchor of the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation enabled PDU session which is
Unstructured PDU Session Type as described in the clause 4.3.4.2, then the SMF
initiates a SMF-NEF Connection Release procedure towards the NEF corresponding
to the \"NEF ID\" for that DNN / S-NSSAI Combination.
Figure 4.25.7-1: SMF Initiated SMF-NEF Connection Release procedure
1\. The SMF performs Step 1 of PDU Session Release Procedure as described in
clause 4.3.4.2.
2\. If a NEF has been selected as anchor of the Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation enabled PDU session which is Unstructured PDU Session Type as
described in clause 4.3.2.2, the SMF initiates the SMF-NEF Connection release
for this PDU Session by sending Nnef_SMContext_Delete Request (User Identity,
PDU Session ID, S-NSSAI, DNN, Release Cause) message to the NEF.
3\. The NEF deletes the NEF PDU Session Context associated with the User
Identity and the PDU session ID. The NEF sends Nnef_SMContext_Delete Response
(Cause, [Small Data Control Rate Status], [APN Rate Control Status]) to the
SMF confirming release of the SMF-NEF session for the UE. The NEF includes
Small Data Rate Control Status if PDU Session used Small Data Rate Control.
4\. Steps 3-15 of PDU Session Release Procedure as described in clause
4.3.4.2.
### 4.25.8 NEF Initiated SMF-NEF Connection Release procedure
NEF initiates a SMF-NEF connection release procedure in the following cases:
\- when a NIDD Authorization Update Request from the UDM indicates that the
User is no longer authorized for NIDD, or
\- failure of AF or failure of AF connection, or
\- based on a request from the AF.
Figure 4.25.8-1 illustrates the NEF Initiated SMF-NEF Connection Release
procedure based on a request from AF.
Figure 4.25.8-1: NEF Initiated SMF-NEF Connection Release procedure on the AF
request
1\. AF may indicate that a User\'s NIDD SMF-NEF connection is no longer needed
by invoking Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Delete Request (TLTRI) toward NEF.
2\. The NEF deletes the NEF PDU session Context associated with the TLTRI and
acknowledges the deletion of the NIDD configuration by invoking
Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Delete Response to the AF.
3\. The NEF notifies the deletion of the SM context information by invoking
Nnef_SMContext_DeleteNotify Request toward the SMF.
4\. The SMF acknowledges the notification by invoking
Nnef_SMContext_DeleteNotify Response to the NEF.
5\. If the PDU session is not longer needed, the SMF performs steps 2-11 of
PDU Session Release Procedure (see clause 4.3.4.2).
Figure 4.25.8-2 illustrates the NEF Initiated SMF-NEF Connection Release
procedure based on the NIDD Authorization Update.
Figure 4.25.8-2: NEF Initiated SMF-NEF Connection Release procedure on the
NIDD Authorization Update
1\. On NIDD Authorization Update by UDM, NEF may determine that it needs to
release the corresponding SMF-NEF Connection.
2\. The NEF deletes the corresponding NEF PDU session Context and notifies the
deletion of the SM context information by invoking Nnef_SMContext_DeleteNotify
Request toward the SMF.
3\. The SMF acknowledges the notification by invoking
Nnef_SMContext_DeleteNotify Response to the NEF.
4\. If the PDU session is not longer needed, the SMF performs steps 2-11 of
PDU Session Release Procedure (see clause 4.3.4.2).
### 4.25.9 NEF Anchored Group NIDD via NEF anchored unicast MT data
Figure 4.25.9-1 illustrates the procedure by which the AF can send a Group
NIDD addressed to External Group Identifier. It is a pre-requisite assumption
that the NEF has already resolved the mapping of External Group Identifier to
individual SUPIs with the help of UDM during NIDD Configuration procedure as
specified in clause 4.25.3. Standalone MT NIDD procedure specified in clause
4.25.5 is re-used by NEF to unicast the MT data to each UE.
Figure 4.25.9-1: NEF Anchored Group NIDD via NEF anchored unicast data
1\. If AF has already used the NIDD Configuration procedure of clause 4.25.3
to activate the NIDD service for a group of UEs and has unstructured data to
send to the group identified by an External Group Identifier, the AF sends a
Nnef_NIDD_Delivery Request (External Group Identifier, TLTRI, unstructured
data, Reliable Data Service Configuration) message to the NEF. Reliable Data
Service Configuration is an optional parameter that is used to configure the
Reliable Data Service. When unstructured data is sent to an External Group
Identifier, the AF shall not request acknowledgement in the Reliable Data
Service Configuration.
2\. Based on the existing NIDD configuration of the UE Group (see clause
4.25.3), the NEF sends a single Nnef_NIDD_Delivery Response to AF to
acknowledge the acceptance of the Group NIDD delivery request in step 1.
3\. The NEF uses the NEF anchored Mobile Terminated Data Transport procedure
that is specified in steps 2-16 in clause 4.25.5 to send the same MT NIDD to
each UE in the group.
4\. After executing step 3 for all UEs in the group, the NEF sends aggregated
response in Nnef_NIDD_GroupDeliveryNotify message. If some target UEs were not
reachable due to UE power saving, then the NEF does not buffer the MT NIDD,
but it may include indication on the expected reachability of those UEs in its
response to AF in this step. If the delivery towards certain UE failed, the
NEF may include the cause value.
## 4.26 Network Function/NF Service Context Transfer Procedures
### 4.26.1 General
Network Function/NF Service Context Transfer Procedures allow transfer of
Service Context of a NF/NF Service from a Source NF/NF Service Instance to the
Target NF/NF Service Instance, e.g. before the Source NF/NF Service can
gracefully close its NF/NF Service. If SMF sets are deployed this applies from
an SMF instance within an SMF set to an SMF instance of another SMF set.
A request (push procedure, see clause 4.26.2) or response (pull procedure, see
clause 4.26.3) from a Source NF/NF Service Instance to a Target NF/NF Service
Instance contains either
\- the context being transferred, e.g. SM context (direct mode); or
\- optionally, an endpoint address from which Target NF/NF Service Instance
can retrieve the context, see TS 29.501 [62] (indirect mode).
It assumes that access to a given context endpoint address can be restricted
to single Target NF/NF Service Instance.
NOTE: Which procedures need to be executed for indirect mode is part of the
specific context transfer procedures as specified in clause 4.26.5.
### 4.26.2 NF/NF Service Context Transfer Push Procedure
Figure 4.26.2-1: NF/NF Service Context Push procedure
1\. When triggered, the Source NF/NF Service acting as NF Service Consumer
sends its Context (e.g. UE Context or SM context) to the Target NF/NF Service
acting as NF Service producer. This may trigger several other procedures that
ensure all necessary NF/NF Services are being updated and set up with
necessary information about the new context location.
2\. The NF Service Consumer receives the response indicating the result of the
operation (successful or not successful). When all procedures have been
executed successfully the Target NF/NF Service can continue to serve the
original NF Service Consumers of the Source NF/NF Service, which e.g. can be
shut down gracefully.
NOTE: After resumption of a new service transaction, it may be necessary to
contact the UE using existing procedures.
### 4.26.3 NF/NF Service Context Transfer Pull procedure
Figure 4.26.3-1: NF/NF Service Context Pull procedure
1\. When triggered, the Target NF/NF Service as an NF Service Consumer
requests a Context (e.g. UE context or SM context) from the Source NF as a NF
Service Producer. This may trigger several other procedures that ensure all
necessary NF/NF services are being updated and set up with necessary
information about the new context location.
NOTE 1: Which procedures need to be executed and what information needs to be
updated is part of the specific context transfer procedures as specified in
clause 4.26.5.
2\. The NF Service Consumer receives the Context and the operation was
successful. When all procedures have been executed successfully the Target
NF/NF Service can continue to serve the original NF Service Consumers of the
Source NF/NF Service, which e.g. can be shut down gracefully.
NOTE 2: After resumption of a new service transaction, it may be necessary to
contact the UE using existing procedures.
### 4.26.4 Context Transfer due to decommissioning
In the case of decommissioning, the Old NF may inform NRF that it is about to
be decommissioned. NRF will in this case not include the NF profile of the Old
NF in any discovery result from the NF/NF service discovery procedure. The NRF
will also notify any consumers subscribed to changes to this resource.
### 4.26.5 SMF Service Context Transfer procedures
#### 4.26.5.1 General
This clause lists the context-specific transfer procedures between different
SMF Sets supporting the same DNN/S-NSSAI pair supported for SM Contexts (i.e.
SMF contexts).
#### 4.26.5.2 I-SMF Context Transfer procedure
Old I-SMF triggered from O&M procedure sends
Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (I-SMF transfer indication, New SMF ID
or SMF set ID) to AMF.
Steps 2-25 in clause 4.23.4.3 follows, where in step 2 AMF selects the
indicated I-SMF, or selects the I-SMF from the indicated SMF set.
#### 4.26.5.3 SMF Context Transfer procedure, LBO or no Roaming, no I-SMF
In the case of dynamic IP address assignment (IPv4 address and/or IPv6
prefix), the procedure in figure 4.26.4.1.1-1 assumes that, if the UE IP
address is received from Old SMF, the control of the IP address(es) assigned
by Old SMF is moved to New SMF by O&M procedures. New SMF is in full control
of the concerned IP address(es) when the transfer is complete.
NOTE 1: If UPF has the IP point of presence from the DNN, the same UPF is
used.
Figure 4.26.4.1.1-1: Context transfer of a PDU session
1\. SM context transfer is triggered, e.g. by OAM to Old SMF including SUPI,
PDU session ID and New SMF ID or SMF set ID. The SMF selection by using SMF
set ID not applicable when the IP range is managed by SMF.
2\. [Conditional - depending on current subscription] Old SMF subscribes to
events when UE status becomes CM-IDLE or CM-CONNECTED with RRC inactive state
(Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe).
3\. [Conditional - depending on the event] The AMF detects the monitored event
occurs and sends the event report by means of Namf_EventExposure_Notify
message, to Old SMF.
4\. From Old SMF to AMF Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (SMF transfer
indication, Old SMF ID, New SMF ID or SMF set ID from Step 1, PDU Session ID,
SUPI, SM Context ID).
5\. AMF, or SCP if delegated discovery is used, uses New SMF ID or SMF set ID
to select New SMF and sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request (PDU
Session ID, Old SMF ID, SM Context ID in Old SMF, UE location info, Access
Type, RAT Type, Operation Type, SMF transfer indication). The same PDU Session
ID as received in step 4 is used. If the AMF receives the service request from
the UE for the PDU session(s) affected by this procedure the AMF delays the
transaction with the SMF until the step 13 completes. If the AMF receives the
UE context transfer request from the other AMF due to the UE mobility, the AMF
defers the response until the step 13 completes. Also, to avoid infinite
waiting time, the AMF starts a locally configured guard timer upon sending the
request to the SMF and the AMF decides the procedure has failed at expiry of
the guard timer.
NOTE 2: Either delay or failure of the SM Context transfer may incur timeout
or failure in UE procedure(s).
6\. From New SMF to Old SMF SMF Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest request (SM
Context type, SM Context ID, SMF transfer indication). If New SMF is not
capable to transfer this SM Context (e.g. it is not responsible for the IP
range), steps 9 to 12 are skipped.
7\. Old SMF releases the N4 session with the UPF by sending a flag notifying
the UPF about the expected re-establishment of the N4 session for the same PDU
session. Based on this, if supported, the UPF should delay the release of the
N4 session up to step 10.2 to allow for uninterrupted packet handling until
the N4 session is re-established by New SMF.
8\. From Old SMF to New SMF Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest response (SM
Context or endpoint address where New SMF can retrieve SM Context). The SM
Context includes the IP address(es) if the PDU session is of type IPv4, IPv6
or IPv4v6, or the Ethernet MAC address(es) if the PDU session if of type
Ethernet as well as the UPF to be selected by New SMF. Old SMF starts a timer
to monitor the SMF context transferring process.
9\. [Conditional] If dynamic PCC is used for the PDU Session, New SMF sets up
a new policy association towards PCF.
10.1. UPF receives a N4 session establishment request for the same PDU session
from step 7. The parameters from step 8 and, if applies, step 9 are used.
10.2. New SMF performs a full re-establishment of the N4 session, establishing
a new N4 session. All information related to the N4 session of Old SMF that is
not used by the N4 session of New SMF is removed from UPF if not already done.
11\. New SMF registers to UDM. The information stored at the UDM includes
SUPI, SMF identity and the associated DNN and PDU Session ID.
12\. New SMF subscribes to subscription changes for the UE.
13\. From New SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext response. If this
response indicates a redirect (e.g. another SMF in the set), the procedure
moves to step 5 with the indicated endpoint address as target.
14\. UDM notifies Old SMF that it is deregistered for the PDU Session by
sending Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification, optionally including New SMF ID
15\. [Conditional] If 14 was not received and the timer from step 8 expires,
Old SMF re-establishes the N4 session. The UPF may for the purpose use the
information stored in step 7. In this case, the procedure ends here.
16\. [Conditional] If Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification in step 14 was
received, Old SMF removes its policy association with PCF. Any changes to the
QoS rules need to be sent to the UE when it becomes active.
17\. Old SMF releases any internal resources corresponding to the indicated
PDU session. Subscribers to SMContextStatusNotify for the transferred SM
context are notified of the context transfer and optionally of the new
location of the transferred SM context.
## 4.27 Procedures for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via NEF
### 4.27.1 General
The support for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via NEF enables AF to
query status of Enhanced Coverage Restriction or enable/disable Enhanced
Coverage Restriction per individual UEs. Figure 4.27.1-1 shows the procedure
for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via NEF.
Figure 4.27.1-1: Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via NEF
1\. The AF may enable or disable Enhanced Coverage Restriction or query the
status of Enhanced Coverage Restriction by sending the
Nnef_ECRestriction_Update Request or Nnef_ECRestriction_Get Request
respectively. Both the service operations require GPSI and AF Identifier as
required input and optionally MTC Provider Information.
2\. Based on operator policies, if the AF is not authorized to perform the
request (e.g. if the SLA does not allow for it) or if the AF has exceeded its
quota or rate of submitting Enhanced Coverage Requests, the NEF performs Step
8 and provides a cause value appropriately indicating the failure result.
3\. The NEF sends the Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update Request to update the
subscription data for Enhanced Coverage Restriction. The NEF sends the
Nudm_SDM_Get Request service operation to query the status of Enhanced
Coverage Restriction.
4\. The UDM checks the GPSI and examines whether any included parameters are
in the range acceptable by the operator, whether Enhanced Coverage Restriction
is supported by the serving NF (i.e. AMF in this case). If this check fails,
the UDM provides a cause value indicating the reason for failure condition to
the NEF in step 7
In the case of Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update Request, the UDM sets the
Enhanced Coverage Restriction information to the appropriate value and
procedure continues to step 5.
In the case of Nudm_SDM_Get Request, the UDM may retrieve the status of
Enhanced Coverage Restriction information from UDR using Nudr_DM_Query Request
and skip steps 5 and 6.
5\. The UDM sends Nudm_SDM_Notification and provide AMF with updates Enhanced
Coverage Restriction information.
6\. The AMF updates the Enhanced Coverage Restriction information stored in
the UE context. The AMF will transfer Enhanced Coverage Restriction
information stored as part of its UE context during AMF change.
NOTE: UE is informed of the updated Enhanced Coverage Restriction information
at the next Registration procedure or based on the local policy the network
can de-register the UE indicating re-registration is required.
7\. The UDM sends the Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update Response or Nudm_SDM_Get
Response to the NEF.
8\. The NEF sends the Nnef_ECRestriction_Update Response or
Nnef_ECRestriction_Get Response to the AF.
# 5 Network Function Service procedures
## 5.1 Network Function Service framework procedures
### 5.1.1 Network Function Service Discovery
The network function (NF) within the core network may expose its capability as
service via its service based interfaces, which can be re-used by other NFs.
Unless the expected NF information is locally configured on requester NF, e.g.
the expected NF is in the same PLMN, the NF service discovery is implemented
via the NF discovery.

#### 5.2.2.2 Namf_Communication service
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
**Service description:** This service enables an NF to communicate with the UE
through N1 NAS messages or with the AN (both UE and non UE specific). The
service operations defined below allow the NF to communicate with the UE and
the AN. The following are the key functionalities of this NF service.
\- Provide service operations for transporting N1 messages to the UE;
\- Allow NFs to subscribe and unsubscribe for notifications of specific N1
messages from the UE;
\- Allow NFs to subscribe and unsubscribe for notifications about specific
information from AN;
\- Provide service operations for initiating N2 messages towards the AN;
\- Security Context Management; and
\- UE information management and transfer (including its security context).
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer service operation
**Service operation name:** Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer
**Description:** Provides the UE context to the consumer NF.
**Input, Required:** 5G-GUTI or SUPI, Access Type, Reason.
**Input, Optional:** Integrity protected message from the UE that triggers the

##### 5.2.2.2.3 Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation
**Service operation name:** Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate
**Description:** This service operation is used by the consumer NF to inform
the AMF that a prior UE context transfer has resulted in the UE successfully
registering with it. The UE context is marked inactive in the AMF.
**Input, Required:** 5G-GUTI, Status.
**Input, Optional:** PDU Session ID(s) (indicates the PDU Session(s) to be
released), PCF reselected indicator (indicates that new AMF has selected a new
PCF to handle the AM Policy association and/or the UE Policy association).
**Output, Required:** None.
**Output, Optional:** None.
See clause 4.2.2.2.2 step 10 for example usage of this service operation. When
the AMF receives this request, it marks the UE context information as inactive
since the UE context has been successfully transferred to the peer NF and the
UE has successfully registered there. The AMF receives information about
whether the AM Policy Association Information and/or the UE Policy Association
Information in the UE context will be used or not (i.e. new AMF may select a
different PCF and then create a new AM Policy Association and/or a new UE
Policy Association). The AMF sends a
Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate response to the consumer NF.
NOTE 2: Whether notification Ack need a separate message or be realized in the
transport layer will be determined in TS 29.518 [18].
##### 5.2.2.2.4 Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service operation
**Service operation name:** Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify
**Description:** AMF notifies the N1 message received from the UE to a
destination CN NF.
**Input, Required:** AMF ID (GUAMI), N1 Message(s)
**Input, Optional:** local time zone, UE\'s current location, AN access
information (e.g. AN type AN N2 terminating point, CAG Identifier(s) of the
CAG cell), Allowed NSSAI, Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI, SUPI, MM Context, LMF
identification.
**Output, Required:** None _._
**Output, Optional:** None _._
The destination NF type to be notified is determined based on one of the
following:
\- The N1 message type is always known to be consumed by one particular NF
type; or
\- An NF had explicitly subscribed for the particular N1 message type to be
notified towards it.
NOTE: Whether notification Ack need a separate message or be realized in the
transport layer will be determined in TS 29.518 [18].
The optional AN access information (if available), SUPI, MM Context, Allowed
NSSAI and Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI parameters are included if the service
operation is invoked towards a peer AMF.
##### 5.2.2.2.5 Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageSubscribe service operation
**Service operation name:** Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageSubscribe.
**Description:** An NF can subscribe with the AMF to get notified of a
particular N1 message type or a specific N2 information type about the UE.
**Input, Required:** CN NF ID, N1 Message Type
**Input, Optional:** SUPI.
**Output, Required:** None _._
**Output, Optional:** None _._
The consumer NF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1MessageSubscribe service
operation (NF ID, N1 message type or N2 information type to subscribe) on the
AMF. The consumer NF shall provide a SUPI for UE associated N1 message
subscriptions. If the consumer NF is allowed to subscribe for the type of
N1/N2 message requested, the AMF creates a binding for the consumer NF to
deliver subsequent Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify or
Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify towards that NF.
NOTE: Whether Subscription Ack need a separate message or be realized in the
transport layer will be determined in TS 29.518 [18].
##### 5.2.2.2.6 Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageUnSubscribe service operation
**Service operation name:** Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageUnSubscribe.
**Description:** An NF can unsubscribe with the AMF to stop notifying a
particular N1 message type or a specific N2 information type about the UE.
**Input, Required:** CN NF ID, N1 Message Type
**Input, Optional:** None.
**Output, Required:** None _._
**Output, Optional:** None _._
The consumer NF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1MessageUnSubscribe service
operation (NF ID, N1 message type or N2 information type to subscribe) on the
AMF. The AMF deletes the binding for the consumer NF for the requested N1
message type.
NOTE: Whether UnSubscribe Ack need a separate message or be realized in the
transport layer will be determined in TS 29.518 [18].
##### 5.2.2.2.7 Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation
**Service operation name:** Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.
**Description:** CN NF request to transfer downlink N1 and/or N2 message to
the UE and/or AN through the AMF.
**Input, Required:** CN NF ID, Message type (N1 or N2 or both), Message
Container (s) where at least one of the message containers (N1 or N2) is
required.
**Input, Optional:** last message indication, Session ID, Paging Policy
Indicator, ARP, Area of validity for the N2 SM information, 5QI,
N1N2TransferFailure Notification Target Address, type of N2 SM information,
type of N2 NRPPa information, Extended Buffering Support. MA PDU session
Accepted indication, target access type (3GPP access or non-3GPP access),
selected alternative H-SMF ID.
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer supports the transfer of only one N2
message. N2 SM information and N2 NRPPa information are mutually exclusive.
**Output, Required:** Result indication _._
**Output, Optional:** Redirection information, Estimated Maximum wait time _._
If the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the AMF initiates the network triggered service
request procedure as specified in clause 4.2.3.3 and responds to the consumer
NF with a result indication, \"attempting to reach UE\". Otherwise, the AMF
responds to the consumer NF, with a Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
response, providing a result indication of whether the AMF was able to
successfully transfer the N1 and/or the N2 message towards the UE and/or the
AN. A result indication of \"N1/N2 transfer success\" does not mean that N1
message is successfully received by the UE. It only means that the AMF is able
to successfully send the N1 or N2 message towards the AN.
The \"Area of validity for the N2 SM information\", if included is used by the
AMF to determine whether the N2 SM information provided by the consumer NF can
be used towards the AN based on the current location of the UE. If the
location of the UE is outside the \"Area of validity for the N2 SM
information\" indicated, the AMF shall not send the N2 SM information to the
AN.
If the consumer NF knows that a specific downlink N1 message is the last
message to be transferred in this transaction, the consumer NF shall include
the last message indication in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
service operation so that the AMF knows that the no more downlink N1 message
need to be transferred for this transaction.
The CN NF is implicitly subscribed to be notified of N1N2TransferFailure by
providing the N1N2TransferFailure Notification Target Address. When AMF
detects that the UE fails to respond to paging or the AMF determines the UE is
temporarily unreachable e.g. due to extended idle mode DRX or MICO mode, the
AMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2TransferFailureNotification to provide
the failure notification to the location addressed by N1N2TransferFailure
Notification Target Address.
The \"Extended Buffering applies\" indication, if included, is used by the AMF
to include \"Estimated Maximum Wait time\" in Namf_Communication_N1N2
TransferFailureNotification if invoked due to the UE being unreachable.
If the result of the service operation fails, the AMF shall set the
corresponding cause value in the result indication which can be used by the NF
consumer for further action. If the related UE is not served by AMF and the
AMF knows which AMF is serving the UE, the AMF provides redirection
information which can be used by the consumer NF to resend UE related message
to the AMF that serves the UE.
If the consumer NF is a SMF and he request includes N2 SM information, the SMF
indicates the type of N2 SM information. If the consumer NF is a LMF and the
request includes N2 NRPPa information, the LMF indicates the type of N2 NRPPa
information.
NOTE: The actual N2 SM information or N2 NRPPa information is not interpreted
by the AMF.
The selected alternative H-SMF ID information may be provided as described in
clause 4.3.2.2.2.
The Small Data Rate Control Status is included if a PDU Session is being
released and the UPF or NEF provided Small Data Rate Control Status when the
PDU Session was released for the AMF to store.
For the usage of MA PDU session Accepted indication and target access type
(3GPP access or non-3GPP access) see clauses 4.22.2, 4.22.3, 4.22.6.3 and

The NF consumer subscribes to the event notification by invoking
Namf_EventExposure to the AMF. The AMF allocates an Subscription Correlation
ID for the subscription and responds to the consumer NF with the Subscription
Correlation ID. UE ID identifies the UE, SUPI and/or GPSI. Event ID (see
clause 4.15.1) identifies the events that the NF consumer is interested in.
The Subscription Correlation ID is unique within the AMF Set.
The ((set of) Event ID(s), Notification Target Address (+ Notification
Correlation ID)) helps the Event Receiving NF to co-relate a notification
against a corresponding event subscription for the indicated Event ID.
In the case that the NF consumer subscribes to the AMF on behalf of other NF,
the NF consumer include the Notification Target Address(+Notification
Correlation ID) of other NF for the Event ID which is to be notified to other
NF directly and the Notification Target Address(+Notification Correlation ID)
of itself for the Subscription Correlation ID change event. Each Notification
Target Address(+ Notification Correlation ID) is associated with the related
(set of) Event ID(s).When the Subscription Correlation ID change due to the
AMF reallocation, the notification is sent to NF consumer which triggers this
subscription.
Event filter may include \"AN type(s)\" as part of the list of parameter
values to match and it indicates to subscribe the event per Access Type.
Event receiving NF ID identifies the NF that shall receive the event
reporting.
When the consumer NF needs to modify an existing subscription previously
created by itself in the AMF, it invokes Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service
operation which contains the Subscription Correlation ID and the new Event
Filters with Event ID to the AMF.

**Output, Required:** None _._
**Output, Optional:** None _._
When the AMF detects a UE access and mobility event corresponding to a
Subscription, it invokes Namf_EventExposure_Notify service operation to the NF
consumer(s) which has subscribed to the UE mobility event before. The event is
notified towards the consumers for which the Event filters (which may include
\"AN type(s)\") match. The Notification Target Address (+ Notification
Correlation ID) indicates to the Event Receiving NF the specific event
notification subscription. The event specific parameter indicates the type of
mobility event and related information, e.g. Registration Area Update/new
Registration Area.
The optional event specific parameter list provides the values that matched
for generating the event notification. The parameter values to match are
specified during the event subscription (see clause 5.2.2.3.2). For example if

#### 5.2.8.2 Nsmf_PDUSession Service
##### 5.2.8.2.1 General
**Service description:** This service operates on the PDU Sessions. The
following are the key functionalities of this NF service:
\- (between AMF and SMF) Creation / Deletion / Modification of AMF-SMF
interactions for PDU Sessions;
The resource handled between AMF and SMF via Create / Update / Release SM
context operations corresponds to the AMF-SMF association for a PDU Session;
When the AMF has got no association with an SMF to support a PDU Session, the
AMF creates such association via the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext
operation. The context created is identified via the SM Context ID. Otherwise
(e.g. at hand-over between 3GPP and Non 3GPP access) the AMF uses the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext operation.
NOTE 1: In TS 29.502 [36] SM Context ID is referred to as smContextRef for N11
and pduSessionRef and pduSessionUri for N16.
When the UE is handed-over from an (old) AMF towards another (new) AMF, the
old AMF provides the new AMF with the SMF addressing information corresponding
to the AMF-SMF association related with each PDU Session of that UE. The new
AMF can thus further act upon the association with the SMF via
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext and Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext
operations. This may take place:
\- at inter AMF change due to AMF planned maintenance or due to AMF failure
described in clause 5.21.2 of TS 23.501 [2];
\- at inter AMF mobility in CM-CONNECTED state described in clause 4.9.1.3;
\- at inter AMF mobility in CM-IDLE state described in clause 4.2.2.2.
\- (between AMF and SMF) Passing MO Small Data from AMF to SMF in clause
4.24.1.
\- (between V-SMF and H-SMF) Creation / Deletion / Modification of PDU
Sessions;
\- (between V-SMF/I-SMF and (H-)SMF) Transferring MO Small Data from
V-SMF/I-SMF to (H-)SMF in clause 4.25.4.
\- (between V-SMF/I-SMF and (H-)SMF) Transferring MT Small Data from (H-)SMF
to V-SMF/I-SMF in clause 4.24.5.
Even though the V-SMF creates the PDU Session resource onto the H-SMF, each of
the V-SMF and of the H-SMF needs to be able to modify a PDU Session and/or to
ask for PDU Session Release. Thus, at Nsmf_PDUSession_Create, V-SMF informs
the H-SMF about addressing information for its corresponding PDU Session
resource, allowing H-SMF to use later on the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update and
Nsmf_PDUSession_Release and Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify operations.
NOTE 2: The PDU Session resource in V-SMF is created when the AMF requests to
create SM context of this PDU Session
NOTE 3: H-SMF also informs the consumer (V-SMF) about addressing information
about its PDU Session resource, but this is part of normal resource creation
operation in REST and not specific to this service.

The following events can be subscribed by a NF consumer (Event ID is defined
in clause 4.15.1):
\- UE IP address / Prefix allocation/change: The event notification may
contain a new UE IP address / Prefix or an indication of which UE IP address /
Prefix has been released.
\- PDU Session Establishment and/or PDU Session Release.
The event notification may contain following information:
\- PDU Session Type.
\- DNN.
\- UE IP address/Prefix.
\- UP path change: a notification corresponding to this event is sent when the
UE IP address / Prefix and / or DNAI and /or the N6 traffic routing
information has changed.
The event notification may contain following information:
\- the type of notification (\"EARLY\" or \"LATE\").
\- for both the source and target UP path between the UE and the DN, the
corresponding information is provided when it has changed:
\- DNAI.
\- UE IP address / Prefix.
\- N6 traffic routing information.

\- Downlink data delivery status. The event notification contains the status
of downlink data buffering in the core network including:
\- First downlink packet per source of the downlink IP traffic in extended
buffering and Estimated maximum wait time.
\- First downlink packet per source of the downlink IP traffic discarded.
\- First downlink packet per source of the downlink IP traffic transmitted
after previous buffering and/or discarding of corresponding packet(s).
\- QFI allocation: The event notification is sent when a new QoS flow is
established within a PDU session and contains:
\- If the Target of Event Reporting is a PDU session, both the allocated QFI
and either one of the following (Application Identifier or IP Packet Filter
Set or Ethernet Packet Filter Set). The DNN, S-NSSAI corresponding to the PDU
session are also sent.
\- If the Target of Event Reporting is a SUPI, both the allocated QFI and
either one of the following (Application Identifier or IP Packet Filter Set or
Ethernet Packet Filter Set) for each PDU session ID established for this SUPI.
The DNN, S-NSSAI corresponding to each PDU session are also sent.
\- If the Target of Event Reporting is an Internal-Group-Id or any UE,
multiple instances of the tuple (allocated QFI and either one of the following
(Application Identifier or IP Packet Filter Set or Ethernet Packet Filter
Set). PDU session ID, SUPI). The DNN, S-NSSAI corresponding to each PDU
session are also sent.
When the consumer NF is the NWDAF, the event QFI allocation is used to collect
data for Observed Service Experience analytics and UE communication analytics
as specified in TS 23.288 [50].
Event Filters are used to specify the conditions to match for notifying the
events (i.e. \"List of Parameter values to match\"). If there are no
conditions to match for a specific Event ID, then the Event Filter is not
provided. The following table provides as an example how the conditions to
match for event reporting can be specified for various Event IDs for SMF
exposure.

#### 5.2.12.2 Nudr_DataManagement (DM) service
##### 5.2.12.2.1 General
The operations defined for Nudr_DM service use following set of parameters
defined in this clause:
\- Data Set Identifier: uniquely identifies the requested set of data within
the UDR (see clause 4.2.5).
\- Data Subset Identifier: it uniquely identifies the data subset within each
Data Set Identifier. As specified in the procedures in clause 4, e.g.
subscription data can consist of subsets particularised for specific
procedures like mobility, session, etc.
\- Data Keys defined in Table 5.2.12.2.1-1
For Nudr_DM_Subscribe and Nudr_DM_Notify operations:
\- The Target of Event Reporting is made up of a Data Key and possibly a Data
Sub Key both defined in Table 5.2.12.2.1-1. When a Data Sub Key is defined in
the table but not present in the Nudr_DM_Subscribe this means that all values
of the Data Sub Key are targeted.
\- The Data Set Identifier plus (if present) the (set of) Data Subset
Identifier(s) corresponds to a (set of) Event ID(s) as defined in clause
4.15.1
An NF Service Consumer may include an indicator when it invokes Nudr_DM
Query/Create/Update service operation to subscribe the changes of the data, to
avoid a separate Nudr_DM_Subscribe service operation.
Depending on the use case, it is possible to use a Data Key and/or one or
multiple Data sub keys to further identify the corresponding data, as defined
in Table 5.2.12.2.1-1 below.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Drafting rules and conventions for NF
services
# A.1 General
This informative Annex provides drafting rules and conventions followed in
this technical specification (and TS 23.501 [2]) for the definition of NF
services offered over the service-based interfaces.
# A.2 Naming
## A.2.1 Service naming
Each NF service provided by a service-based interface shall be named and
referred to according to the following nomenclature:
_\- Nnfname_ServiceName_ , where _Nnfname_ is the service-based interface
where the NF service is invoked. See clause 4.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2] for the
list of service-based interfaces in the 5GS Architecture.
Example (illustrative): _Namf_Registration._
## A.2.2 Service operation naming
If a service contains multiple independent operations, each operation shall be
named and referred to according to the following nomenclature:
_\- Nnfname_ServiceName_ServiceOperation[Method]_ , where the _ServiceName_
represents the actual NF service. The _ServiceOperation_ itself defines the
available service functionality which can be addressed by a specific
operation. The _Method(s)_ is/are the action(s), how the ServiceOperation can
be used. It can be created, read, updated or deleted.
Example (illustrative): _Namf_Session_Registration[Create]_ ,
_Namf_Session_Registration[Delete]_
In general, this operation naming structure for the given example is depicted
in a tree-structure diagram:
Figure A.2.2-1: Service Operation Naming and its Methods
# A.3 Representation in an information flow
Invoking a service or service operation within an information flow is
represented using a disaggregated representation (see figure A.3-1).
The disaggregated representations on figure A.3-1 shall be used as follows:
\- The \ represents the actual step number in the information flow e.g.
â€³7.â€³.
\- Representation a) shall be used when the step is required.
\- Representation b) shall be used when the step is optional or conditional.
Figure A.3-1: Disaggregated representation of a NF service or service
operation in information flows
NOTE: Depending on the information flow, the order of NF Producer and NF
Consumer can be reversed.
# A.4 Reference to services and service operations in procedures
Whenever a procedure needs to refer to the service or service operation of a
service-based interface, the naming in clause A.2 shall be used, using italic
font. Unless otherwise obvious in the text, the NF Consumer of the service or
service operation shall be indicated within parenthesis after the service or
service operation name.
\- \> (\)
Example: e.g. _Namf_Registration_RelocationRequest (AMF)_
# A.5 Service and service operation description template
The description of a service or service operation in this specification shall
be done according to the following template.
NOTE: The heading level should follow that of the actual clause where the
service is specified.
**X.x \ >**
**X.x.1 Description**
**Service or service operation name:**
\>.
**Description:** \.
**Known NF Consumers:** \.
**Inputs, Required:** \ _\-- Parameters required from NF
Consumer for successful completion of the service or service operation.
Parameters required for the operation of the underlying protocol shall not be
listed._
**Inputs, Optional:** \ _\-- Additional parameters that
may be provided by NF Consumer for execution of the service or service
operation. Parameters required for the operation of the underlying protocol
shall not be listed._
**Outputs, Required:** \, \>, \ _\-- Parameters provided to
NF Consumer and/or service triggered upon successful completion of the service
and/or other (e.g. procedure triggered). Parameters required for the operation
of the underlying protocol shall not be listed._
**Outputs, Optional:** \ \-- _Additional parameters
provided to NF Consumer upon successful completion of the service or service
operation. Parameters required for the operation of the underlying protocol
shall not be listed._
**X.x.2 Service/service operation information flow**
\.
NOTE: This information flow can require invoking other services. In this case,
the invoked services are represented as described in clause A.3.
# A.6 Design Guidelines for NF services
Clause 7.1.1 of TS 23.501 [2] defines the criteria for defining the NF
services. The following clauses identify the design guidelines that shall be
considered for identifying the NF services.
## A.6.1 Self-Containment
The following design guidelines are used for identifying self-contained NF
services.
\- Each NF service operates on its own set of context(s). A context refers to
a state or a software resource or an internal data storage. The NF service
operations can create, read, update or delete the context(s).
\- Any direct access of a context(s) owned by a NF service is be made by the
service operations of that NF service. Services provided by the same NF can
communicate internally within the NF.
## A.6.2 Reusability
The following design guidelines are used for specifying NF services to be
reusable.
\- NF service operations are specified such that other NF can potentially
invoke them in future, if required.
\- The service operations may be usable in multiple system procedures
specified in clause 4 of this specification.
\- Using clause 4 of the current document, the system procedures in which the
NF service operations can be used are considered and based on that the
parameters for the NF service operations are clearly listed.
NOTE: It is possible that, when mapping an end to end call flow to service
based architecture, one step in the call flow may map to multiple NF service
operation invocations. This specification clearly identifies each NF service
operation invocation in the call flow. Protocol optimization of multiple NF
service operation invocations are left for TS 29.500 [17] consideration.
## A.6.3 Use Independent Management Schemes
The mechanisms for independent management schemes are not in scope of this
specification.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Drafting Rules for Information flows
The following drafting rules are recommended for information flows specified
in this specification in order to ensure that the Control Plane network
functions can be supported with service based interfaces:
1\. Information flows should describe the end to end functionality. NF
services in clause 5 shall only be derived from the information flows in
clause 4.
2\. Information flows should strive to use type of interactions such as
REQUEST/RESPONSE (e.g. location request, location response), SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY
between Core CP NFs. Any other type of interactions described should have
justifications for its use.
3\. Information flows should also ensure readability thus the semantics of the
REQUEST/RESPONSE should still be maintained (for instance, we need to indicate
PDU Session request, PDU Session response and Subscribe for UE location
reporting/Notify UE location reporting) for readers and developers to
understand the need for a certain transaction.
NOTE: As stated in TS 23.501 [2], service based interface is not supported for
N1, N2, N4. Thus, the rules are not meant for those interfaces.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Generating EPS PDN Connection parameters from
5G PDU Session parameters
This annex specifies how to generate the EPS PDN connection parameters from
the 5G PDU Session parameters in SMF+PGW-C.
When the SMF+PGW-C is requested to set up/modify either a PDN connection or a
PDU session supporting interworking between EPS and 5GS, the SMF+PGW-C
generates the PDN Connection parameters from the PDU session parameters.
When the SMF+PGW-C generates the PDN Connection parameters based on the PDU
Session parameters, the following rules hold:
\- PDN type: the PDN type is set to IPv4, IPv6 or IPv4v6 if the PDU Session
Type is IPv4, IPv6 or IPv4v6, respectively. The PDN Type is set to Ethernet if
the MME, SGW and UE support Ethernet PDN Type, otherwsie the PDN type is set
to Non-IP for Ethernet and Unstructured PDU Session Types
\- EPS bearer ID: the EBI is requested from the AMF during the establishment
of a QoS Flow as described in clause 4.11.1.4.1 for PDU Sessions supporting
interworking between EPS and 5GS. The EBI is obtained from MME during the
establishment of an EPS Bearer (that is triggered by an establishment of a QoS
Flow) as defined in TS 23.401 [13] for PDN Connections hosted by SMF+PGW-C.
The association between EBI and QoS Flow is stored by the SMF.
\- APN-AMBR: APN-AMBR is set according to operator policy (e.g. taking the
Session AMBR into account).
\- EPS QoS parameters (including ARP, QCI, GBR and MBR):
If QoS Flow is mapped to one EPS bearer, ARP, GBR and MBR of the EPS Bearer is
set to the ARP, GFBR and MFBR of the corresponding QoS Flow, respectively. For
standardized 5QIs, the QCI is one to one mapped to the 5QI. For non-
standardized 5QIs, the SMF+PGW-C derives the QCI based on the 5QI and operator
policy.
A GBR QoS Flow is mapped 1 to 1 to a GBR dedicated EPS Bearer if an EBI has
been assigned. After mobility to EPS traffic flows corresponding to GBR QoS
Flow for which no EBI has been assigned will continue flowing on the default
EPS bearer if it does not have assigned TFT.
If multiple QoS Flows are mapped to one EPS bearer, the EPS bearer parameters
are set based on operator policy, e.g. EPS bearer QoS parameters are set
according to the highest QoS of all mapped QoS Flows.
After mobility to EPS traffic flows corresponding to Non-GBR QoS Flows for
which no EBI has been assigned will continue flowing on the default EPS Bearer
if it does not have assigned TFT.
###### ## Annex D (normative): UE Presence in Area of Interest
# D.1 Determination of UE presence in Area of Interest by AMF
If RRC Inactive state applies to NG-RAN and the AMF has requested NG-RAN
location reporting for the Area Of Interest and UE is in CM-CONNECTED state,
the AMF determines the UE presence of Area of Interest as the reported value
from the NG-RAN.
If RRC Inactive state applies to NG-RAN and the AMF has requested N2
Notification, the AMF determines the UE presence in Area Of Interest as
follows:
\- IN:
\- if the UE is inside the Area Of Interest service area and if the UE is in
CM-CONNECTED with RRC Connected state; or
NOTE 1: The above is valid e.g. under the condition that Area Of Interest
border coincides with NG-RAN node service area border or RAN Notification
Area.
\- if the UE is inside a Registration Area which is contained within the Area
Of Interest.
\- OUT:
\- if the UE is outside the Area Of Interest in CM-CONNECTED with RRC
Connected state; or
NOTE 2: The above is valid e.g. under the condition that Area Of Interest
border coincides with NG-RAN node service area border or RAN Notification
Area.
\- if UE is inside a Registration Area which does not contain any part of Area
Of Interest.
\- UNKNOWN:
if none of above conditions for IN or OUT is met.
Otherwise, AMF determines the UE presence of Area Of Interest as follows:

\- if the UE is outside the Area Of Interest in CM-CONNECTED; or
\- if UE is inside a Registration Area which does not contain any part of Area
Of Interest.
\- UNKNOWN:
if none of above conditions for IN or OUT is met.
# D.2 Determination of UE presence in Area of Interest by NG-RAN
If the AMF has requested for the Area of Interest, NG-RAN determines the UE
presence of Area Of Interest as follows:
\- IN:
\- if the UE is inside the Area Of Interest and the UE is in RRC Connected
state; or
\- if the UE is inside an RNA which is contained within the Area Of Interest.

###### ## Annex E (normative): Delegated SMF and PCF discovery in the Home
Routed and specific SMF Service Areas scenarios
# E.0 Overview
This Annex describes the option where the SCP is involved in the SMF and PCF
selection for following cases:
\- PDU Session to be established in Home Routed mode,
\- PDU Session requiring an I-SMF as defined in clause
\- PCF discovery in the Roaming scenario
NOTE: No similar Annex is foreseen to describe the discovery and selection of
other NF involving the SCP.
# E.1 Delegated SMF discovery in the Home Routed scenario
Figure E.1: Delegated Discovery of SMF in the Home Routed Scenario
1\. The AMF sends Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the V-NRF. The AMF may indicate
the maximum number of H-SMF instances to be returned by the NRF.
2\. The NRF in VPLMN and NRF in HPLMN interact using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery
service. See step 2 in clause 4.17.5.
3\. The AMF gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response with one or more profile(s)
of SMF(s) in HPLMN.
4\. The AMF selects an SMF instance in HPLMN (H-SMF endpoint).
5\. The AMF builds a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request that includes the
endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected H-SMF in the body of the request. If the
AMF supports delegated SMF discovery and is configured to apply it, the AMF
sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request with Discovery & Selection
parameters to the selected SCP in the VPLMN. Discovery & Selection parameters
include S-NSSAI, UE location (TAI), i.e. parameter for V-SMF selection.
6\. [Optional] The SCP in VPLMN sends Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the V-NRF
using Discovery & Selection parameters received from AMF.
7\. [Optional] The SCP in VPLMN gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response with
profile(s) of SMF(s) in VPLMN.
8\. The SCP in VPLMN selects an SMF instance in VPLMN (V-SMF), which supports
the Discovery & Selection parameters received earlier from the AMF.
9\. The SCP in VPLMN forwards the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request
received from the AMF to the selected SMF instance in VPLMN.
10\. If the V-SMF does not support delegated SMF discovery or is not
configured to apply it (Case A), the V-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_Create
Request directly to the H-SMF. Otherwise (Case B), the V-SMF sends the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request to the SCP in VPLMN but adds Discovery &
Selection parameter set to H-SMF endpoint received from the AMF. In both
cases, the V-SMF uses the received endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected H-SMF
to construct the target destination to be addressed.
NOTE: The Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request sent by the V-SMF in Case A and in
Case B is the same apart from the Discovery & Selection parameter. The
Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request received by the H-SMF in Case A and in Case B
is the same.
11\. The SCP in VPLMN sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request to the selected
SMF instance in HPLMN indicated in step 10.
When the V-SMF responds to AMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response
as in clause 4.3.2.2.2 in step 3b, if the AMF has not stored the SMF Service
Area for the V-SMF, the AMF shall obtain the SMF Service Area for the
concerned V-SMF from the NRF using the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe
service operation.
# E.2 Delegated I-SMF discovery
Figure E.2: Delegated Discovery of I-SMF
The following impacts are applicable to clause 4.23.5 (PDU Session
Establishment procedure) to support delegated SMF discovery:
1\. If the AMF supports delegated SMF discovery and is configured to apply it,
the AMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request together with
discovery and selection parameters to a SCP. The discovery and selection
parameters include S-NSSAI, DNN, TAI that corresponds to the UE location
required SMF capability (e.g. support of ATSSS).
2\. [Optional] The SCP sends an Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the NRF. The
request includes discovery and selection parameters received from AMF in step
1.
3\. [Optional] The SCP gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response. The response
may include one or more profile(s) of SMF(s).
Depending on the available information, the SCP may either execute steps in
Case A or in Case B.
Case A There are, either in the NRF response or discovered by the SCP, one or
more SMF instances that support Discovery and selection crireria set by the
AMF.
4\. The SCP selects an SMF instance.
5\. The SCP forwards the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to the
selected SMF instance.
Case B There is, either in the NRF response or discovered by the SCP, no SMF
instance that supports Discovery and selection criteria set by the AMF.
6\. The SCP returns an Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response to the AMF
with an error \'NF not found\'
7\. The AMF sends Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the NRF. The AMF may indicate
the maximum number of SMF instances to be returned by the NRF.
8\. The AMF gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response with one or more profile(s)
of SMF(s).
9\. The AMF selects an SMF instance endpoint.
10\. The AMF builds a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request that contains
the endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected SMF in the body of the request. If the
AMF supports delegated SMF discovery and is configured to apply it, the AMF
sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to a SCP together with
Discovery and selection parameters that include S-NSSAI, TAI that corresponds
to the UE location, i.e. parameter for I-SMF selection.
11\. [Optional] The SCP sends an Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the NRF. The
request includes Discovery and selection parameters received from AMF
(including the TAI that corresponds to the UE location).
12\. [Optional] The SCP gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response. The response
may include one or more profile(s) of I-SMF(s).
13\. The SCP selects an I-SMF instance that supports the TAI.
14\. The SCP forwards the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request received
from the AMF to the selected I-SMF instance.
15\. If the I-SMF does not support delegated SMF discovery or is not
configured to apply it (Case A), the I-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_Create
Request directly to the SMF. Otherwise (Case B), the I-SMF sends the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request to the SCP but adds Discovery & Selection
parameter set to the SMF endpoint received from AMF. In both cases the I-SMF
uses the received endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected SMF to construct the
target destination to be addressed.
NOTE: The Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request sent by the I-SMF in Case A and in
Case B is the same apart from the Discovery & Selection parameter. The
Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request received by the SMF in Case A and in Case B is
the same.
16\. The SCP forwards the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request to the selected SMF
instance indicated in step 15.
The procedure continues as described in clause 4.3.2.2.2 from Step 7.
Difference comparing to procedure defined in clause 4.3.2.2.2, the V-SMF and
V-UPF are replaced by I-SMF and I-UPF and H-SMF and H-UPF are replaced by SMF
and UPF(PSA) respectively. Also only the S-NSSAI with the value defined by the
serving PLMN is sent to the SMF.
When the I-SMF responds to AMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response
as in clause 4.3.2.2.2 in Step 3b, if the AMF has not stored the SMF Service
Area for the I-SMF, the AMF shall obtain the SMF Service Area for the
concerned I-SMF from the NRF using the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe
service operation.
# E.3 Delegated PCF discovery in the Roaming scenario
Figure E.3: Delegated Discovery of PCF in the Home Routed Scenario
1\. The AMF sends Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the V-NRF in order to discover a
PCF in HPLMN. The AMF may indicate the maximum number of H-PCF instances to be
returned by the NRF.
2\. The NRF in VPLMN and NRF in HPLMN interact using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery
service. See step 2 in clause 4.17.5.
3\. The AMF gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response with one or more profile(s)
of PCF(s) in HPLMN.
4\. The AMF selects a PCF instance in HPLMN.
5\. The AMF builds a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request that contains the H-PCF ID
in the body of the request. If the AMF supports delegated PCF discovery and is
configured to apply it, the AMF forwards the Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request to
the selected SCP in VPLMN.together with Discovery & Selection parameter set to
V-PCF instance ID.
6\. The SCP in VPLMN selects the corresponding (V-)PCF instance for UE policy
association based on Discovery & Selection parameter received from the AMF.
7\. The SCP in VPLMN forwards the Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request to the selected
PCF instance in VPLMN.
8\. If the V-PCF does not support delegated PCF discovery or is not configured
to apply it (Case A), the V-PCF sends Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request to the
selected PCF instance. Otherwise (Case B), the V-PCF sends the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request to a SCP in VPLMN but adds Discovery & Selection
parameter set to H-PCF ID.
9\. The SCP in VPLMN sends an Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request to the selected PCF
instance in HPLMN indicated in step 8.
###### ## Annex F (informative): Information flows for 5GS integration with
TSN
This annex defines the procedures for 5GS integration with TSN fully-
centralized model as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc-2018 [65], it includes 5GS
Bridge information reporting and 5GS Bridge configuration.
# F.1 5GS Bridge information reporting
Figure F.1-1: 5GS Bridge information reporting
Identities of 5GS Bridge and UPF/NW-TT ports are pre-configured on the UPF
based on deployment. The SMF requests the UPF/NW-TT to measure and report the
clock drift between the TSN GM time and 5GS GM time for one or more TSN time
domains.
1\. PDU Session Establishment as defined clause 4.3.2.2.1-1 is used to
establish a PDU Session serving for TSC.
During this procedure, the SMF selects a UPF, which supports functions as
defined in clause 5.28.1 of TS 23.501 [2], for the PDU Session.
During this procedure, the SMF receives the UE-DS-TT residence time, DS-TT MAC
address for this PDU Session and port management capabilities from the DS-
TT/UE in PDU Session Establishment request and receives the allocated port
number for DS-TT Ethernet port and Bridge ID in N4 Session Establishment
Response message. The UPF allocates the port number for DS-TT, Bridge ID after
receiving N4 Session Establishment Request message.
2\. The SMF sends the information received in step 1 to the TSN AF via PCF to
establish/modify the 5GS Bridge. The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify message
in step 2b is delivered via the pre-configured AF session as described in
clause 4.16.5.1. The TSN AF stores the binding relationship between 5GS Bridge
ID, MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port and also updates 5GS bridge delay
as defined in clause 5.27.5 of TS 23.501 [2] for future configuration. The TSN
AF requests creation of a new AF session associated with the MAC address of
the DS-TT Ethernet port using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create operation
(step 2c) and subscribes for TSN events over the newly created AF session
using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe operation (step 2d).
Using the 5GS Bridge ID received in step 2b the TSN AF subscribes with the NW-
TT for receiving bridge management information changes for the 5GS bridge
indicated by the 5GS Bridge ID as described in clause 5.28.3.1 of TS 23.501
[2].
After receiving a Bridge Management Information Container (BMIC) containing
the NW-TT port numbers, the TSN AF subscribes with the NW-TT for receiving NW-
TT port management information changes for the NW-TT port indicated by each of
the NW-TT port numbers as described in clause 5.28.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
The TSN AF can use any PDU Session to subscribe with the NW-TT for bridge or
port management information notifications. Similarly, the UPF can use any PDU
Session to send bridge or port management information notifications.
3\. If DS-TT has indicated support for the TSN Time domain number in the port
management capabilities, TSN AF provides the TSN Time domain number to DS-TT.
Optionally, TSN AF provides the TSN Time domain number to NW-TT.
4\. If supported according to the port management capabilities received from
DS-TT, TSN AF retrieves txPropagationDelay and Traffic Class table from DS-TT.
TSN AF also retrieves txPropagationDelay and Traffic Class table from NW-TT.
NOTE: It is assumed that distribution of TSN GM time towards NW-TT and DS-TT
for the TSN time domain is activated before TSN AF retrieves
txPropagationDelay so that DS-TT and NW-TT can convert txPropagationDelay from
5GS time to TSN time before reporting txPropagationDelay to TSN AF.
5\. If DS-TT supports neighbor discovery according to the port management
capabilities received from DS-TT, then TSN AF:
\- provides DS-TT port neighbor discovery configuration to DS-TT to configure
and activate the LLDP agent in DS-TT;
\- subscribes to receive Neighbor discovery information for each discovered
neighbor of DS-TT (see Table 5.28.3.1-1 of TS 23.501 [2].
If DS-TT does not support neighbor discovery, then TSN AF:
\- provides DS-TT port neighbor discovery configuration to NW-TT to configure
and activate the LLDP agent in NW-TT to perform neighbor discovery on behalf
of DS-TT;
\- subscribes to receive Neighbor discovery information for each discovered
neighbor of DS-TT from NW-TT (see Table 5.28.3.1-1 of TS 23.501 [2].
TSN AF:
\- writes NW-TT port neighbor discovery configuration to NW-TT to configure
and activate the LLDP agent in NW-TT;
\- subscribes to receive Neighbor discovery information for each discovered
neighbor of NW-TT (see Table 5.28.3.1-1 of TS 23.501 [2]).
6\. TSN AF receives notifications from DS-TT (If DS-TT supports neighbour
discovery) and NW-TT on discovered neighbors of DS-TT and NW-TT.
7\. The TSN AF constructs the above received information as 5GS Bridge
information and sends them to the CNC to register a new TSN Bridge or update
an existing TSN Bridge.
# F.2 5GS Bridge configuration
For 5GS integrating with fully-centralized model TSN network, the CNC provides
TSN information to the AF.
Figure F.2-1: 5GS Bridge information configuration
1\. CNC provides per-stream filtering and policing parameters according to
clause 8.6.5.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q [66] to AF and the AF uses them to derive
TSN QoS information and related flow information. The CNC provides the
forwarding rule to AF according to clause 8.8.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q [66]. The
TSN AF uses this information to identify the DS-TT MAC address of
corresponding PDU session.
2\. The AF determines the MAC address of a PDU Session based on the previous
stored associations, then triggers an AF request procedure. The AF request
includes the DS-TT MAC address of the PDU session.
Based on the information received from the CNC, 5GS bridge delay information
and the UE-DS-TT residence time, the TSN AF determines the TSN QoS information
and TSC Assistance Container for one or more TSN streams and sends them to the
PCF. The TSN AF also provides Service Data Flow Filter containing Flow
description also includes Ethernet Packet Filters.
3\. When PCF receives the AF request, the PCF finds the correct SMF based on
the DS-TT MAC address of the PDU session and notifies the SMF via
Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify message.
After mapping the received TSN QoS parameters for TSN streams to 5GS QoS, the
PCF triggers Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify message to update the PCC rule
to the SMF. The PCC rule includes the Ethernet Packet Filters, the 5GS QoS
profile along with TSC Assistance Container.
4\. SMF may trigger the PDU Session Modification procedure to establish/modify
a QoS Flow to transfer the TSN streams. During this procedure, the SMF
provides the information received in PCC rules to the UPF via N4 Session
Modification procedure.
Upon reception of the TSC Assistance Container, the SMF determine the TSCAI
for QoS flow and sends the TSCAI along with the QoS profile to the NG RAN.
5\. If needed, the CNC provides additional information (e.g. the gate control
list as defined in clause 8.6.8.4 of IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 [66]) to the TSN AF.
6\. The AF determines the MAC address of a PDU Session for the configured port
based on the previous stored associations, this is used to deliver the Port
Management information to the correct SMF that manages the port via PCF. The
AF triggers an AF request procedure. The AF request includes the DS-TT MAC
address (i.e. the MAC address of the PDU Session), TSN QoS Parameters, Port
Management information Container and the related port number as defined in
clause 5.28.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The port number is used by SMF to decide
whether the configured port is in DS-TT or NW-TT.
NOTE: When TSN AF needs to convey 5GS Bridge- or NW-TT port-specific
information to the NW-TT/UPF, the TSN AF chooses an arbitrary AF Session
related to the corresponding 5GS bridge and sends the 5GS Bridge-specific
information inside a Bridge Management Information Container (BMIC) or NW-TT
Port Management Information Container (NW-TT PMIC) as specified in TS 23.501
[2].
7\. The PCF determines the SMF based on the MAC address received in the AF
request, the PCF maps the TSN QoS information provided by the AF to PCC rules
as described in clause 5.28.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. The PCF includes the TSC
Assistance Container received from the AF with the PCC rules and forwards it
to the SMF. The PCF transparently transports the received Port Management
information Container and related port number to SMF via
Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify message.
8a. If the SMF decides the port is on DS-TT based on the received port number,
the SMF transports the received Port Management information Container to the
UE/DS-TT in PDU Session Modification Request message.
8b. If the SMF decides the port is on NW-TT based on the received port number,
the SMF transports the received Port Management information Container to the
UPF/NW-TT in N4 Session Modification Request message. SMF provides the
Ethernet Packet Filters as part of the N4 Packet Detection rule to the UPF/NW-
TT.
If the UPF sends a Clock Drift Report to the SMF as described in clause 5.27.2
of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF adjusts the Burst Arrival Time and Periodicity from
a TSN grandmaster clock to the 5G clock and sends the updated TSCAI to NG-RAN.
