# 4 High level architectural requirements
## 4.1 General requirements
It shall be possible to apply policy and charging control to any kind of 3GPP
and non-3GPP accesses defined in TS 23.501 [2].
The policy and charging control framework shall support the roaming scenarios
defined in TS 23.501 [2].
The policy and charging control shall be enabled on a per slice instance, per
DNN, or per both slice instance and DNN basis.
NOTE: In single PCF deployment, the PCF will provide all mobility, UE access
selection and PDU Session related policies that it is responsible for. In
deployments where different PCFs support N15 and N7 respectively, no
standardized interface between them is required in this release to support
policy alignment.
The policy and charging control framework shall fulfil non-session management
related requirements as defined in clause 4.2 and session management related
requirements as defined in clause 4.3.
## 4.2 Non-session management related policy control requirements
### 4.2.1 Access and mobility related policy control requirements
The policy framework shall provide following functionality for the access and
mobility enforcement:
\- Policy Control Function (PCF) shall support interactions with the access
and mobility policy enforcement in the AMF, through service-based interfaces.
\- The PCF shall be able to provide Access and Mobility Management related
policies to the AMF.
\- The PCF shall be able to evaluate operator policies that are triggered by
events received from the AMF.
### 4.2.2 UE policy control requirements
The 5GC shall be able to provide policy information from the PCF to the UE.
Such UE policy information includes:
\- Access Network Discovery & Selection Policy (ANDSP): It is used by the UE
for selecting non-3GPP accesses network.
\- UE Route Selection Policy (URSP): This policy is used by the UE to
determine how to route outgoing traffic. Traffic can be routed to an
established PDU Session, can be offloaded to non-3GPP access outside a PDU
Session, or can trigger the establishment of a new PDU Session.
\- V2X Policy (V2XP): This policy provides configuration parameters to the UE
for V2X communication over PC5 reference point or over Uu reference point or
both. V2X Policies are defined in TS 23.287 [28].
### 4.2.3 Network analytics information requirements
The PCF shall be able to collect directly network analytic information from
the NWDAF. The NWDAF provides network data analytics (e.g. load level
information on a network slice level) to PCF. The PCF shall be able to use
those data in its policy decisions. The details are defined in clause 6.1.1.3.
### 4.2.4 Management of packet flow descriptions
Management of Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) refers to the capability to
create, update or remove PFDs in the NEF (PFDF) and the distribution from the
NEF (PFDF) to the SMF and finally to the UPF. This feature may be used when
the UPF is configured to detect a particular application provided by an ASP.
NOTE 1: A possible scenario for the management of PFDs in the SMF is when an
application, identified by an application detection filter in the UPF, deploys
a new server or a reconfiguration occurs in the ASP network which impacts the
application detection filters of that particular application.
NOTE 2: The management of application detection filters in the SMF can still
be performed by using operation and maintenance procedures.
NOTE 3: This feature aims for both: to enable accurate application detection
at the UPF and to minimize storage requirements for the UPF and the SMF.
The management of PFDs is supported in non-roaming and home-routed scenarios
for those ASPs that have a business relation with the home operator.
### 4.2.5 SMF selection management related policy control requirements
The policy framework may provide following functionality for the SMF selection
management for a PDU Session:
\- The Policy Control Function (PCF) may support interactions with the SMF
selection functionality in the AMF and the PCF may provide SMF selection
management related policies to the AMF;
\- The PCF may provide a policy to the AMF to contact PCF for performing DNN
replacement of specific DNNs;
\- The PCF may provide a policy to the AMF to contact PCF for performing DNN
replacement for an unsupported DNN.
### 4.2.6 Support for non-session management related network capability
exposure
Support for network capability exposure enables an AF (e.g. an external ASP)
to request the following non-session management related policy control
functionality from the NEF:
\- Management of PFDs as defined in clause 4.2.4 and in clause 4.18 of TS
23.502 [3];
\- Negotiations for future background data transfer as defined in clause
6.1.2.4 and in clause 4.16.7 of TS 23.502 [3];
\- Applying a previously negotiated background data transfer policy to a UE or
group of UEs as defined in clause 6.1.2.4 and in clause 4.15.6.8 of TS 23.502
[3];
\- Traffic steering control for AF influenced traffic diversion, as defined in
clause 4.3.7 and in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2];
\- Service specific parameter provisioning for V2X communication (see clause
5.20 of TS 23.501 [2] and clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3]);
\- 5G VN group management (see clause 5.29 of TS 23.501 [2] and clause 4.15.6
of TS 23.502 [3]).
## 4.3 Session management related policy control requirements
### 4.3.1 General requirements
It shall be possible for the PCC framework to base decisions upon subscription
information, Access Type and the RAT Type.
The PCC framework shall perform Gating Control and discard packets that don\'t
match any service data flow of the active PCC rules. It shall also be possible
for the operator to define PCC rules, with wild-carded service data flow
filters, to allow sending or receiving packets that do not match any service
data flow template of any other active PCC rules.
The PCC framework shall allow the charging control to be applied on a per
service data flow and on a per application basis, independent of the policy
control.
The PCC framework shall have a binding method that allows the unique
association between service data flows and specific QoS Flow.
A single service data flow detection shall suffice for the purpose of both
policy control and flow based charging.
A PCC rule may be predefined or dynamically provisioned at establishment and
during the lifetime of a PDU Session. The latter is referred to as a dynamic
PCC rule.
It shall be possible to take a PCC rule into service, and out of service, at a
specific time of day, without any PCC interaction at that point in time.
It shall be possible to take DNN-related policy information into service, and
out of service, once validity conditions specified as part of the DNN-related
policy information are fulfilled or not fulfilled anymore, respectively,
without any PCC interaction at that point in time.
PCC shall be enabled on a per DNN basis at the SMF. It shall be possible for
the operator to configure the PCC framework to perform charging control,
policy control or both for a DNN access.
The PCC framework shall allow the resolution of conflicts which would
otherwise cause a subscriber\'s Subscribed Guaranteed Bandwidth QoS to be
exceeded.
It should be possible to use PCC framework for handling IMS-based emergency
service.
It shall be possible with the PCC framework, in real-time, to monitor the
overall amount of resources that are consumed by a user and to control usage
independently from charging mechanisms, the so-called usage monitoring
control.
It shall be possible for the PCC framework to provide application awareness
even when there is no explicit service level signalling.
The PCC framework shall support making policy decisions based on subscriber
spending limits.
The PCC framework shall support making policy decisions for N6 traffic
steering.
### 4.3.2 Charging related requirements
#### 4.3.2.1 General
In order to allow for charging control on service data flow, the information
in the PCC rule identifies the service data flow and specifies the parameters
for charging control.
For the purpose of charging correlation between service data flow level and
application level (e.g. IMS) as well as on-line charging support at the
application level, applicable charging identifiers and Access Type identifiers
shall be passed from the PCF to the AF, if such identifiers are available.
#### 4.3.2.2 Charging models
The PCC charging shall support the following charging models for charging
performed by SMF:
\- Volume based charging;
\- Time based charging;
\- Volume and time based charging;
\- Event based charging;
\- No charging.
NOTE: The charging model - \"No charging\" implies that charging control is
not applicable, and no charging records are generated.
#### 4.3.2.3 Charging requirements
It shall be possible to apply different rates and charging models depending on
a UE\'s roaming status.
It shall be possible to apply different rates based on the location of a UE.
It shall be possible to apply different rates for specific part of a service,
e.g. allow the UE to download a certain volume for one rate, and after this
volume has been reached continue with a different rate.
It shall be possible to apply different rates based on the time of day.
It shall be possible to enforce per service data flow, identified by PCC Rule,
usage limits on a per UE basis.
It shall be possible to apply different rates depending on the access used to
carry a Service Data Flow
It shall be possible to apply an online charging action upon Application
Start/Stop events.
It shall be possible to indicate to the SMF that interactions with the CHF are
not required for a PCC rule, i.e. to not perform accounting, credit control or
recording of usage for the service data flow, in this case no charging
information is generated.
#### 4.3.2.4 Examples of Service Data Flow Charging
There are many different services that may be used within a network, including
both user-user and user-network services. Service data flows from these
services may be identified and charged in many different ways. A number of
examples of configuring PCC rules for different service data flows are
described below.
EXAMPLE 1: A network server provides an FTP service. The FTP server supports
both the active (separate ports for control and data) and passive modes of
operation. A PCC rule is configured for the service data flows associated with
the FTP server for the user. The PCC rule uses a filter specification for the
uplink that identifies packets sent to port 20 or 21 of the IP address of the
server, and the origination information is wildcarded. In the downlink
direction, the filter specification identifies packets sent from port 20 or 21
of the IP address of the server.
EXAMPLE 2: A network server provides a \"web\" service. A PCC rule is
configured for the service data flows associated with the HTTP server for the
user. The PCC rule uses a filter specification for the uplink that identifies
packets sent to port 80 of the IP address of the server, and the origination
information is wildcarded. In the downlink direction, the filter specification
identifies packets sent from port 80 of the IP address of the server.
EXAMPLE 3: An operator has a specific charging rate for user-user VoIP traffic
over the IMS. A PCC rule is established for this service data flow. The filter
information to identify the specific service data flow for the user-user
traffic is provided by the P‑CSCF (AF).
### 4.3.3 Policy control requirements
#### 4.3.3.1 Gating control requirements
Gating control shall be applied by the UPF on a per service data flow basis.
To enable the PCF gating control decisions, the AF shall report session events
(e.g. session termination, modification) to the PCF. For example, session
termination, in gating control, may trigger the blocking of packets or
\"closing the gate\".
Gating Control applies for service data flows of IP type.
#### 4.3.3.2 QoS control requirements
##### 4.3.3.2.1 QoS control at service data flow level
It shall be possible to apply QoS control on a per service data flow basis in
the SMF, applicable for service data flows of both IP type and Ethernet type.
QoS control per service data flow allows the PCC framework to provide the SMF
with the authorized QoS to be enforced for each specific service data flow.
Criteria such as the QoS subscription information may be used together with
policy rules such as, service-based, subscription-based, or predefined PCF
internal policies to derive the authorized QoS to be enforced for a service
data flow.
It shall be possible to apply multiple PCC rules, without application provided
information, using different authorised QoS within a single PDU Session and
within the limits of the Subscribed QoS profile.
##### 4.3.3.2.2 QoS control at QoS Flow level
It shall be possible for the PCC framework to support control of QoS
reservation procedures (UE-initiated or network-initiated). It shall be
possible to determine the QoS to be applied in QoS reservation procedures (QoS
control) based on the authorised QoS of the service data flows that are
applicable to the QoS Flow and on criteria such as the QoS subscription
information, service based policies, and/or predefined PCF internal policies.
It shall be possible for the SMF to determine the authorized QoS of a QoS Flow
using the PCC rules associated to the QoS Flow, and the SMF shall be able to
notify the PCF if the QoS Flow is removed or the GFBR of a QoS Flow can no
longer (or can again) be guaranteed.
It shall be possible for the PCC framework to support control of QoS for the
packet traffic of the PDU Session.
The PCC framework shall be able to provide policy control in the presence of
NAT devices. This may be accomplished by providing appropriate address and
port information to the PCF.
The enforcement of the control for QoS reservation procedures for a QoS Flow
shall allow for a downgrading or an upgrading of the requested QoS as part of
a UE-initiated QoS Flow establishment and modification. The PCC framework
shall be able to provide a mechanism to initiate QoS Flow establishment and
modification as part of the QoS control.
The PCC framework shall be able to handle QoS Flows that require a guaranteed
bitrate (GBR bearers) and QoS Flows for which there is no guaranteed bitrate
(non-GBR bearers).
##### 4.3.3.2.3 QoS control at PDU Session level
It shall be possible for the PCF to provide the authorized Session-AMBR
values, default 5QI/ARP combination for PDU Session of IP type, Ethernet type
and unstructured type unconditionally or conditionally, i.e. per PDU Session
type and/or RAT type.
It shall be possible for the PCF to request a change of the unconditional or
conditional authorized Session-AMBR value(s) at a specific point in time.
#### 4.3.3.3 Subscriber spending limits requirements
It shall be possible to enforce policies based on subscriber spending limits.
The CHF shall maintain policy counter(s) to track spending for a subscription.
These policy counters must be available in the CHF prior to their use over the
N28 interface.
NOTE: The mechanism for provisioning the policy counters in the CHF is out of
scope of this document.
The PCF shall request information regarding the subscriber\'s spending from
the CHF, to be used as input for dynamic policy decisions for the subscriber,
using subscriptions to spending limit reports. The CHF shall make information
regarding the subscriber\'s spending available to the PCF using spending limit
reports.
### 4.3.4 Usage monitoring control requirements
The requirements to monitor, both volume and time usage, and report the
accumulated usage of network resources apply for PDU Sessions of type IP and
Ethernet.
It shall be possible to apply usage monitoring for the accumulated usage of
network resources on a per Session and user basis. This capability is required
for enforcing dynamic policy decisions based on the total network usage in
real-time.
The PCF that uses usage monitoring for making dynamic policy decisions shall
set and send the applicable thresholds to the SMF for monitoring. The usage
monitoring thresholds shall be based either on time, or on volume. The PCF may
send both thresholds to the SMF. The SMF shall notify the PCF when a threshold
is reached and report the accumulated usage since the last report for usage
monitoring. If both time and volume thresholds were provided to the SMF, the
accumulated usage since last report shall be reported when either the time or
the volume thresholds are reached.
NOTE: There are reasons other than reaching a threshold that can cause the SMF
to report accumulated usage to the PCF as defined in clause 6.2.2.3.
The usage monitoring capability shall be possible for an individual or a group
of service data flow(s), or for all traffic of a PDU Session in the SMF. When
usage monitoring for all traffic of a PDU Session is enabled, it shall be
possible to exclude an individual SDF or a group of service data flow(s) from
the usage monitoring for all traffic of this PDU Session. It shall be possible
to activate usage monitoring both to service data flows associated with
predefined PCC rules and dynamic PCC rules, including rules with deferred
activation and/or deactivation times while those rules are active.
If service data flow(s) need to be excluded from PDU Session level usage
monitoring and PDU Session level usage monitoring is enabled, the PCF shall be
able to provide the an indication of exclusion from session level monitoring
associated with the respective PCC rule(s).
It shall be possible to apply different usage monitoring depending on the
access used to carry a Service Data Flow.
### 4.3.5 Application detection and control requirements
The application detection and control feature comprise the request to detect
the specified application traffic, report to the PCF on the start or stop of
application traffic and to apply the specified enforcement and charging
actions.
The PCF shall instruct the SMF on which applications to detect and whether to
report start or stop event to the PCF by activating the appropriate PCC rules
in the SMF. Reporting notifications of start and stop of application detection
to the PCF may be muted.
The report to the PCF shall include the report is for start or stop, the
detected application identifier and, if deducible, the service data flow
descriptions for the detected application traffic.
Upon receiving the report from SMF, the PCF may make policy decisions based on
the information received and may send the corresponding updated or new PCC
rules to the SMF.
In this release of the specification Application Detection and Control applies
only to the IP PDU Session types.
### 4.3.6 Support for session management related network capability exposure
Support for network capability exposure enables an AF (e.g. an external ASP)
to request the following session management related policy control
functionality from the NEF:
\- Set or change a chargeable party at AF session setup (see clauses 4.15.6.4
and 4.15.6.5 of TS 23.502 [3]);
\- Set up an AF session with required QoS (see clause 6.1.3.22 and clause
4.15.6.6 of TS 23.502 [3]);
\- Transfer of traffic characteristics of Time Sensitive Communication from
the TSN AF (see clause 6.1.3.23).
### 4.3.7 Traffic steering control
Traffic Steering Control refers to the capability to activate/deactivate
traffic steering policies from the PCF in the SMF for the purpose of:
\- steering the subscriber\'s traffic to appropriate operator 3rd party
service functions (e.g. NAT, antimalware, parental control, DDoS protection)
in the N6-LAN or 5G-LAN type of services. This is supported in non-roaming and
home-routed scenarios only.
\- AF influenced traffic diversion which enables the routing of the user
traffic matching the traffic filters provided in the PCC rule to a local Data
Network identified by the DNAI per AF request. This is supported in non-
roaming and LBO scenarios only, as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].
# 5 Architecture model and reference points
## 5.1 General
This specification describes the policy and charging control framework for the
5G system. The interaction between network functions is represented in two
ways:
\- A service-based representation, where network functions enable other
authorized network functions to access their services. This representation
also includes point-to-point reference points where necessary;
\- A reference point representation, which shows that interactions exist
between those network functions for which a reference point is depicted
between them.
## 5.2 Reference architecture
### 5.2.1 Non-roaming architecture
The reference architecture of policy and charging control framework for the 5G
System is comprised by the functions of the Policy Control Function (PCF), the
Session Management Function (SMF), the User Plane Function (UPF), the Access
and Mobility Management Function (AMF), the Network Exposure Functionality
(NEF), the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF), the Charging Function
(CHF), the Application Function (AF) and UDR (Unified Data Repository).
Figure 5.2.1-1 shows the service based representation and Figure 5.2.1-1a
shows the reference point representation of the reference architecture of
policy and charging control framework for the 5G System.
Figure 5.2.1-1: Overall non-roaming reference architecture of policy and
charging control framework for the 5G System (service based representation)
Figure 5.2.1-1a: Overall non-roaming reference architecture of policy and
charging control framework for the 5G System (reference point representation)
NOTE 1: The N4 reference point is not part of the 5G Policy Framework
architecture but shown in the figures for completeness. See TS 23.501 [2] for
N4 reference point definition.
NOTE 2: How the PCF/NEF stores/retrieves information related with policy
subscription data or with application data is defined in TS 23.501 [2].
The Nchf service for online and offline charging consumed by the SMF is
defined in TS 32.240 [8].
The Nchf service for Spending Limit Control consumed by the PCF is defined in
TS 23.502 [3].
### 5.2.2 Roaming architecture
Figure 5.2.2-1 shows the local breakout roaming policy framework architecture
in 5G:
Figure 5.2.2-1: Overall roaming reference architecture of policy and charging
control framework for the 5G System - local breakout scenario
Figure 5.2.2-1a: Overall roaming reference architecture of policy and charging
control framework for the 5G System - local breakout scenario (reference point
representation)
NOTE 1: In the LBO architecture, the PCF in the VPLMN may interact with the AF
in order to generate PCC Rules for services delivered via the VPLMN. The PCF
in the VPLMN uses locally configured policies according to the roaming
agreement with the HPLMN operator as input for PCC Rule generation. The PCF in
VPLMN has no access to subscriber policy information from the HPLMN for PCC
Rule generation.
NOTE 2: In the LBO architecture, N24 can be used to deliver UE policy
information from the PCF in the HPLMN to the PCF in the VPLMN. The PCF in the
VPLMN can provide access and motility policy information without contacting
the PCF in the HPLMN.
NOTE 3: In the LBO architecture, AF requests providing routing information for
roamers targeting a DNN and S-NSSAI (targeting all roamers) or an External-
Group-Identifier (identifying a group of roamers) are stored as Application
Data in the UDR(in the VPLMN) by the NEF (in the VPLMN).
NOTE 4: For the sake of clarity, SEPPs are not depicted in the roaming
reference point architecture figures.
Figure 5.2.2-2 shows the roaming policy framework architecture (home routed
scenario) in 5G:

control framework for the 5G System - home routed scenario (reference point
representation)
NOTE 5: All functional entities as described in Figure 5.2.1-1 non-roaming
scenario, except NWDAF, applies also to the HPLMN in the home routed scenario
above.
NOTE 6: For the sake of clarity, SEPPs are not depicted in the roaming
reference point architecture figures.

# 6 Functional description
## 6.1 Overall description
### 6.1.1 General
#### 6.1.1.1 PCF Discovery and Selection
The procedures for PCF Discovery and Selection by the AMF and by the SMF are
described in TS 23.501 [2].
The procedure to ensure that an AF reaches the PCF selected for a PDU Session
is described in clause 6.1.1.2.
#### 6.1.1.2 Binding an AF request targeting an UE address to the relevant PCF
##### 6.1.1.2.1 General
When multiple and separately addressable PCFs have been deployed, a network
functionality is required in order to ensure that an AF needing to send
policies about UE traffic identified by an UE address can reach over N5 the
PCF holding the corresponding PDU Session information. This network
functionality has the following characteristics:
\- It has information about the user identity, the DNN, the UE (IP or MAC)
address(es), the S-NSSAI and the selected PCF address for a certain PDU
Session.
\- For IP PDU Session type, it shall receive information when an IP address is
allocated or released for a PDU Session.
\- For Ethernet PDU Sessions supporting binding of AF request based on MAC
address, it shall receive information when a MAC address is detected as being
used by the UE over the PDU Session (this detection takes place at the UPF
under control of SMF and is defined in clause 5.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2]). In
addition, it receives the DS-TT port MAC address in case of IEEE TSN
integration (as described in clause 5.28.2 of TS 23.501 [2]).
\- The functionality determines the PCF address and if available the
associated PCF instance ID and PCF set ID, selected by the PCF discovery and
selection function described in TS 23.501 [2], according to the information
provided by the AF or the NEF.
A private IPv4 address may be allocated to different PDU Sessions, e.g.:
\- The same UE IPv4 address is allocated to different PDU Sessions to the same
DNN and different S-NSSAI;
\- The same UE IPv4 address is allocated to different PDU Sessions to the same
S-NSSAI and different DNN.
In the case of private IPv4 address being used for the UE, the AF or the NEF
may send DNN S-NSSAI, in addition, in Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request
and Nbsf_Management_Discovery request. The DNN and S-NSSAI can be used by the
PCF for session binding, and they can be also used to help selecting the
correct PCF.
##### 6.1.1.2.2 The Binding Support Function (BSF)
The BSF has the following characteristics:
\- For a certain PDU Session, the BSF stores internally information about the
user identity, the DNN, the UE (IP or MAC) address(es), the S-NSSAI, the
selected PCF address and if available the associated PCF instance ID, PCF set
ID and the level of binding (see clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501 [2]).
NOTE 1: Only NF instance or NF set Level of Binding indication are supported
at the BSF.
\- The PCF registers, updates and removes the stored information in the BSF
using the Nbsf management service operations defined in TS 23.502 [3].
\- The PCF ensures that it is updated each time an IP address is allocated or
de-allocated to the PDU Session or, for Ethernet PDU Sessions supporting
binding of AF request based on MAC address, each time it has been detected
that a MAC address is used or no more used by the UE in the PDU Session.
\- Based on operator\'s policies and configuration, the PCF determines whether
the same PCF shall be selected for the SM Policy associations to the same UE
ID, S-NSSAI and DNN combination in the non-roaming or home-routed scenario.
NOTE 2: This applies to usage monitoring.
\- The selected PCF (if needed) downloads the user profile from the UDR as
described in clause 4.16.4 step 2 of TS 23.502 [3]. If usage monitoring is
enabled for the user, and based on operator\'s policies, the PCF checks if the
BSF has already existing PCF serving the combination of SUPI, S-NSSAI, DNN.
\- If no such PCF is found the PCF shall register itself to the BSF as
described above in this clause.
\- Else if an existing PCF is found for the above combination, the PCF shall
return to the SMF the available information about the existing PCF and a
redirection indication.
NOTE 3: The assumption is that for DNN, S-NSSAI combinations where usage
monitoring be applied, the same BSF instance or the same BSF SET is selected
for all UE PDU Sessions to the same DNN, S-NNSAI.
\- For retrieval binding information, any NF, such as NEF or AF, that needs to
discover the selected PCF address(es), and if available, the associated PCF
instance ID, PCF set ID and level of binding (see clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501
[2]) for the tuple (UE address, DNN, S-NSSAI, SUPI, GPSI) (or for a subset of
this Tuple) uses the Nbsf management service discovery service operation
defined in TS 23.502 [3].
\- The NF may discover the BSF via NRF or based on local configuration. When
registering the NF profile in NRF, the Range(s) of UE IPv4 addresses, Range(s)
of UE IPv6 prefixes supported by the BSF and optionally, the DNN list,
S-NSSAI(s) or IP domain list as described in TS 29.510 [32], may be provided
to NRF.
\- If the NF received a PCF set ID or a PCF instance ID with an indication of
level of binding as result of the Nbsf management service discovery service
operation, it should use that information as NF set level or NF instance level
Binding Indication to route requests to the PCF as defined in clause 6.3.1.0
of TS 23.501 [2] and according to the following provisions:
\- For the NF set level of binding, the NF will receive a PCF set ID but no
PCF instance ID. If an NF is not able to reach the received PCF address(es)
and applies direct discovery, it should query the NRF for PCF instances within
the PCF set and select another instance.
\- For the NF instance level of binding, the NF will receive a PCF set ID and
a PCF instance ID. If an NF is not able to reach the received PCF address(es)
and applies direct discovery, it should query the NRF for PCF service
instances within the PCF and select another instance.
\- The NF should provide a Routing Binding Indication based on the received
PCF set ID, level of binding and possible PCF instance ID in requests it sends
to the PCF.
\- For an ongoing NF service session, the PCF may provide Binding indication
to the NF (see clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501 [2]). This Binding indication shall
then be used instead of any PCF information received from the BSF.
\- If a new PCF instance is selected, the new PCF should invoke
Nbsf_Management_Update service operation to update the binding information in
BSF.
The BSF may be deployed standalone or may be collocated with other network
functions, such as PCF, UDR, NRF, SMF.
NOTE 4: Collocation allows combined implementation.
#### 6.1.1.3 Policy decisions based on network analytics
Policy decisions based on network analytics allow PCF to perform policy
decisions taking into account the analytics information provided by the NWDAF.
The PCF subscribes/unsubscribes to Analytics information as defined in TS
23.288 [24].
The following Analytics IDs are relevant for Policy decisions: \"Load level
information\", \"Service Experience\", \"Network Performance\" and \"Abnormal
behaviour\". The PCF may subscribe to notifications of network analytics
related to \"Load Level Information\" using the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation including the
Analytics ID \"Load level information\", the Analytics Filter \"S-NSSAI\" and
the Analytics Reporting Information set to a load level threshold value. The
PCF is notified when the load level of the Network Slice Instance reaches the
threshold, and then the PCF may verify if the RFSP index value needs to be
modified for a SUPI for which an AM Policy Association is created; this is
based on operator policies in the PCF, as defined in clause 6.1.2.1.
The PCF may subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to
\"Service Experience\" using the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe
service operation including the Analytics ID \"Service Experience\", the
Target of Analytics Reporting \"any UE\" and the Analytics Filter including
one or more \"Application ID(s)\". The PCF is notified on the Service
Experience statistics or predictions including, for each Application Id, the
list of SUPIs for which Service Experience is provided. In addition, both
spatial and time validity may be provided as well as the confidence of the
prediction. The PCF may check the 5QI values assigned to the Application, the
number of UEs affected and may use this as input to calculate and update the
authorized QoS for a service data flow template.
The NWDAF service to retrieve the service experience (i.e. the average
observed Service MoS) is described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.288 [24].
The PCF may subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to
\"Network Performance\" using the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe
service operation including the Analytics ID \"Network Performance\", the
Target of Analytics Reporting \"Internal Group Id\" and the Analytics Filter
including the Area of Interest. The PCF is notified on the Network Performance
statistics or predictions including the Area of Interest. In addition, the
confidence of the prediction may be provided. The PCF may use this information
as input to calculate the background data transfer policies that are
negotiated with the ASP, as defined in clause 6.1.2.4.
The NWDAF services to retrieve \"Network Performance\" as described in clause
6.6 of TS 23.288 [24].
The PCF may subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to
\"Abnormal behaviour\" using the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe
service operation including the Analytics ID \"Abnormal behaviour\", the
Target of Analytics Reporting \"SUPI\", \"Internal Group Id\" or \"any UE\"
and the Analytics Filter including the expected analytics type or the list of
Exceptions IDs and per each Exception Id a possible threshold and other
Analytics Filter Information if needed. The list of Exception IDs is specified
in TS 23.288 [24]. The PCF may use \"Unexpected UE location\" as input to
determine the Service Area Restrictions defined in clause 6.1.2.1, \"Suspicion
of DDoS attack\" or \"Too frequent Service Access\" to request the SMF to
terminate the PDU Session as defined in clause 6.1.3.6, \"Wrong destination
address\" to perform gating of a service data flow as defined in clause
6.1.3.6 and \"Unexpected long-live/large rate flows\" to perform QoS related
policies such as gating or policing as defined in clause 6.2.1.1.
The NWDAF services to retrieve UE related analytics are described in clause
6.7 of TS 23.288 [24].
The PCF may also use the network analytics as input to its policy decision to
apply operator defined actions for example for the UE context(s) or PDU
Session(s).
### 6.1.2 Non-session management related policy control
#### 6.1.2.1 Access and mobility related policy control
The access and mobility policy control encompasses the management of service
area restrictions, the management of the RFSP functionalities and UE-AMBR, and
the management of the SMF selection. This clause defines the management of
service area restrictions and RFSP Index for a UE registered over 3GPP access.
The management of service area restrictions for a 5G-RG or a FN-CRG using
W-5GAN are specified in TS 23.316 [27].
The management of service area restrictions enables the PCF of the serving
PLMN (e.g. V-PCF in roaming case) to modify the service area restrictions used
by AMF as described in clause 5.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2].
A UE\'s subscription may contain service area restrictions, which may be
further modified by PCF based on operator defined policies at any time, either
by expanding a list of allowed TAIs or by reducing a non-allowed TAIs or by
increasing the maximum number of allowed TAIs. Operator defined policies in
the PCF may depend on input data such as UE location, time of day, information
provided by other NFs, etc.
The AMF may report the subscribed service area restrictions received from UDM
during Registration procedure or when the AMF changed, the conditions for
reporting are that local policies in the AMF indicate that Access and Mobility
Control is enable. The AMF reports the subscribed service area restrictions to
the PCF also when the policy control request trigger for service area
restrictions change, as described in clause 6.1.2.5, is met. The AMF receives
the modified service area restrictions from the PCF. The AMF stores them then
use it to determine mobility restriction for a UE. The PCF may indicate the
AMF that there is an unlimited service area.
The service area restrictions consist of a list of allowed TAI(s) or a list of
non-allowed TAI(s) and optionally the maximum number of allowed TAIs.
NOTE 1: The enforcement of the service area restrictions is performed by the
UE, when the UE is in CM-IDLE state or in CM-CONNECTED state when in RRC
Inactive, and in the RAN/AMF when the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state.
The management of the RFSP Index enables the PCF to modify the RFSP Index used
by the AMF to perform radio resource management functionality as described in
clause 5.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. PCF modifies the RFSP Index based on operator
policies that take into consideration e.g. accumulated usage, load level
information per network slice instance etc. The subscribed RFSP Index may be
further adjusted by the PCF based on operator policies at any time.
For radio resource management, the AMF may report the subscribed RFSP Index
received from UDM during the Registration procedure or when the AMF changed.
The conditions for reporting are that local policies in the AMF indicate that
Access and Mobility Control is enable. The AMF reports the subscribed RFSP
Index to the PCF when the subscription to RFSP Index change to the PCF is met.
The AMF receives the modified RFSP Index from the PCF.
NOTE 2: The enforcement of the RFSP Index is performed in the RAN.
Upon change of AMF, the source AMF informs the PCF that the UE context was
removed in the AMF in the case of inter-PLMN mobility.
The management of UE-AMBR enables the PCF to provide the UE-AMBR information
to AMF based on serving network policy. The AMF may report the subscribed UE-
AMBR received from UDM. The conditions for reporting are that the PCF provided
Policy Control Request Triggers to the AMF to report subscriber UE-AMBR
change. The AMF receives the modified UE-AMBR from the PCF. The AMF provides a
UE-AMBR value of the serving network to RAN as specified in clause 5.7.2.6 of
TS 23.501 [2].
The management of the SMF selection enables the PCF to instruct the AMF to
contact the PCF during the PDU Session Establishment procedure to perform a
DNN replacement, as specified in clause 5.6.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. To indicate
the conditions to check whether to contact the PCF at PDU Session
establishment (as specified in clause 6.1.2.5), the PCF provides the Policy
Control Request Triggers SMF selection management and, if necessary Change of
the Allowed NSSAI, together with SMF selection management related policy
control information (see clause 6.5) during UE Registration procedure and at
establishment of the AM Policy Association.
The PCF may update SMF selection management information based on PCF local
decision or upon being informed about a new Allowed NSSAI. The AMF applies the
updated SMF selection management information to new PDU Sessions only, i.e.
already established PDU Sessions are not affected.
#### 6.1.2.2 UE policy control
##### 6.1.2.2.1 General
The 5GC shall be able to provide policy information from the PCF to the UE.
Such UE policy information includes:
1) Access Network Discovery & Selection Policy (ANDSP): It is used by the UE
for selecting non-3GPP accesses and for selection of the N3IWF in the PLMN.
The structure and the content of this policy are specified in clause 6.6.1.
2) UE Route Selection Policy (URSP): This policy is used by the UE to
determine if a detected application can be associated to an established PDU
Session, can be offloaded to non-3GPP access outside a PDU Session, or can
trigger the establishment of a new PDU Session. The structure and the content
of this policy are specified in clause 6.6.2. A URSP rule includes one Traffic
descriptor that specifies the matching criteria and one or more of the
following components:
2a) SSC Mode Selection Policy (SSCMSP): This is used by the UE to associate
the matching application with SSC modes.
2b) Network Slice Selection Policy (NSSP): This is used by the UE to associate
the matching application with S-NSSAI.
2c) DNN Selection Policy: This is used by the UE to associate the matching
application with DNN.
2d) PDU Session Type Policy: This is used by the UE to associate the matching
application with a PDU Session Type.
2e) Non-Seamless Offload Policy: This is used by the UE to determine that the
matching application should be non-seamlessly offloaded to non-3GPP access
(i.e. outside of a PDU Session).
2f) Access Type preference: If the UE needs to establish a PDU Session for the
matching application, this indicates the preferred Access Type (3GPP or
non-3GPP or Multi-Access).
3) V2X Policy (V2XP): This policy provides configuration parameters to the UE
for V2X communication over PC5 reference point or over Uu reference point or
both. V2X Policies are defined in clause 5.1.2.1 and clause 5.1.3.1 of TS
23.287 [28].
The ANDSP and URSP may be pre-configured in the UE or may be provisioned to UE
from PCF. The pre-configured policy shall be applied by the UE only when it
has not received the same type of policy from PCF.
The methods of configuring V2XP to the UE, including (pre-)configuration and
provisioning, and the priority of the same type of parameters acquired from
different sources are defined in clause 5.1.1 of TS 23.287 [28].
The PCF selects the UE policy information applicable for each UE based on
local configuration, and operator policies taking into consideration the
information defined in clause 6.2.1.2.
In the case of a roaming UE, the V-PCF may retrieve UE policy information from
the H-PCF over N24/Npcf. When the UE is roaming and the UE has valid rules
from both HPLMN and VPLMN the UE gives priority to the valid ANDSP rules from
the VPLMN.
The UE policy information shall be provided from the PCF to the AMF via
N15/Namf interface and then from AMF to the UE via the N1 interface as
described in clause 4.2.4.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. The AMF shall not change the UE
policy information provided by PCF.
The PCF is responsible for delivery of UE policy. If the PCF is notified about
UE policy information delivery failure (e.g. because of UE unreachable), the
PCF may provide a new trigger \"Connectivity state changes\" in Policy Control
Request Trigger of UE Policy Association to AMF as defined in clause 4.16.12.2
of TS 23.502 [3]. After reception of the Notify message indicating that the UE
enters the CM-Connected state, the PCF may retry to deliver the UE policy
information.
NOTE 1: For backward compatibility the PCF may subscribe the \"Connectivity
state changes (IDLE or CONNECTED)\" event in Rel-15 AMF as defined in clause
5.2.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
If due to UE Local Configurations, a UE application requests a network
connection using Non-Seamless Offload, the UE shall use Non-Seamless Offload
for this application without evaluating the URSP rules. Otherwise, the UE
shall select the PDU Session or Non-Seamless Offload in the following order:
\- If the UE has an URSP rule (except the URSP rule with the \"match all\"
Traffic descriptor) that matches the application as defined in clause 6.6.2.3,
the UE shall perform the association of the application to the corresponding
PDU Session or to Non-Seamless Offload according to this rule; Otherwise,
\- If no URSP rule is applicable for the application (except the URSP rule
with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor), the UE shall perform the
association of the application to a PDU Session according to the applicable UE
Local Configurations, if any. If the UE attempts to establish a new PDU
Session according to the UE Local Configurations and this PDU Session
Establishment request is rejected by the network, then the UE shall perform
the association of the application to a PDU Session or to Non-Seamless Offload
according to the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor;
Otherwise,
NOTE 2: It is assumed that the S-NSSAI(s) in the UE Local Configurations are
operator-provided S-NSSAI(s). The provision of the S-NSSAI(s) is not
specified.
NOTE 3: The application layer is not allowed to set the S-NSSAI when the UE
establishes a PDU Session based on the UE Local Configurations.
NOTE 4: Any missing information in the UE Local Configurations needed to build
the PDU Session Establishment request can be the appropriate corresponding
component from the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor.
\- If neither the UE Local Configurations nor the URSP rules are applicable
for the application (except the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic
descriptor), the UE shall perform the association of the application to a PDU
Session or to Non-Seamless Offload according to the URSP rule with the \"match
all\" Traffic descriptor.
For the existing PDU Session(s), the UE shall examine the URSP rules within
the UE policy information in order to determine whether the existing PDU
Session(s) (if any) are maintained or not. If not, then the UE may initiate a
PDU Session release procedure for the PDU Session(s) that cannot be
maintained.
If there are multiple IPv6 prefixes within the PDU Session, then the IPv6
multi-homed routing rules, described in clause 5.8.2.2.2 in TS 23.501 [2], on
the UE shall be used to select which IPv6 prefix to route the traffic of the
application.
NOTE 5: For the case that an application cannot be associated to any PDU
Session, the UE can inform the application that association of the application
to PDU Session fails.
##### 6.1.2.2.2 Distribution of the policies to UE
The UE policy control enables the PCF to provide UE access selection related
policy information, PDU Session related policy information and V2X Policy
information to the UE, i.e. UE policies, that includes Access network
discovery & selection policy (ANDSP) or UE Route Selection Policy (URSP) or
V2X Policy (V2XP) or their combinations using Npcf and Namf service
operations.
The PCF may be triggered to provide the UE policy information during UE Policy
Association Establishment and UE Policy Association Modification procedures as
defined in clause 4.16.11 and clause 4.16.12 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 1: The PCF can install a PCC Rule and activate start and stop of
application detection in the SMF. When the same PCF is selected for SM policy
association control and UE policy association control, the reporting of start
and stop of an application can trigger the installation or update of a URSP
rule in the UE to send the application traffic to the PDU Session as defined
in the URSP rule.
NOTE 2: The PCF can subscribe to the UDR on service specific information
change, which will be taken into consideration by the PCF to determine the
updated V2XP as defined in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3].
Operator defined policies in the PCF may depend on input data such as UE
location, time of day, information provided by other NFs, etc. as defined in
clause 6.2.1.2.
The PCF includes the UE policy information delivered to the UE into a Policy
Section identified by a Policy Section Identifier (PSI). The PCF may divide
the UE policy information into different Policy Sections, each one identified
by a PSI. Each Policy Section provides a list of self-contained UE policy
information to the UE, via AMF. The PCF ensures that a Policy Section is under
a predefined size limit, known by the PCF.
NOTE 3: The size limit to allow the policy information to be delivered using
NAS transport is specified in TS 29.507 [13]. The size limit is configured in
the PCF.
A list of self-contained UE policy information implies that:
\- when the PCF delivers URSP rules to the UE, the PCF provides the list of
URSP rules in the order of precedence and without splitting a URSP rule across
Policy Sections;
\- when the PCF delivers V2XP to the UE, the PCF provides the list of V2XP in
the order of precedence and without splitting a V2XP across Policy Sections;
\- when the PCF delivers WLANSP rules, the list of WLANSP rules are provided
in the order of priority and without splitting a WLANSP rule across Policy
Sections;
\- when the PCF delivers the non-3GPP access network selection information,
the whole list of non-3GPP access network selection information (as defined in
clause 6.6.1.1) is provided in one Policy Section.
It is up to PCF decision how to divide the UE policy information into Policy
Sections as long as the requirements for the predefined size limit and the
self-contained content (described above) are fulfilled.
NOTE 4: The Policy Section list can be different per user. One PSI and its
corresponding content can be the same for one or more users.
NOTE 5: The PCF may, for example, assign the URSP as one whole Policy Section,
or it may subdivide the information in the URSP into multiple Policy Sections
by assigning one or several URSP rules to each Policy Section.
The PLMN ID is provided to the UE together with UE policy information and it
is used to indicate which PLMN a Policy Section list belongs to.
The AMF forwards the UE policy information transparently to the UE. If the
(H-)PCF decides to split the UE policies to be sent to the UE, the PCF
provides multiple Policy Sections separately to the AMF and then AMF uses UE
configuration Update procedure for transparent UE policies delivery procedure
to deliver the policies to the UE, this is defined in clauses 4.2.4.3 and
clause 4.16 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 6: The AMF does not need to understand the content of the UE policy,
rather send them to the UE for storage.
The UE shall update the stored UE policy information with the one provided by
the PCF as follows (details are specified in TS 24.501 [22]):
\- If the UE has no Policy Sections with the same PSI, the UE stores the
Policy Section;
\- If the UE has an existing Policy Section with the same PSI, the UE replaces
the stored Policy Section with the received information;
\- The UE removes the stored Policy Section if the received information
contains only the PSI.
The UE keeps the received UE policies stored even when registering in another
PLMN. The number of UE policies to be kept stored in the UE for PLMNs other
than the HPLMN is up to UE implementation. If necessary, e.g. the number of UE
policies stored in UE for PLMNs exceeds the maximum value, the UE may remove
earlier stored UE policy in UE.
The ANDSP for VPLMN, if provided within the UE policy in the UE Configuration
Update procedure described in clause 4.2.4.3 of TS 23.502 [3], applies to the
equivalent PLMN(s) indicated in the last received list of equivalent PLMNs in
Registration Accept.
At Initial Registration or the Registration to 5GS when the UE moves from EPS
to 5GS:
\- The UE provides the list of stored PSIs which identify the Policy Sections
associated to the home PLMN and the visited PLMN (if the UE is roaming) that
are currently stored in the UE. If USIM is changed, the UE does not provide
any PSI. If no policies are stored in the UE for the home PLMN, the UE does
not provide any PSI associated to the home PLMN. If the UE is roaming and has
policies for the home PLMN but no associated policies for the visited PLMN the
UE includes only the list of PSIs associated to the home PLMN.
\- UE may indicate its ANDSP support to the PCF. If it is received, the PCF
shall take it into account for the determination on whether to provide the
ANDSP to the UE. The PCF does not provide ANDSP rules to the UE if the UE does
not indicate support for ANDSP.
\- The UE may also provide the OSId.
The UE may trigger an Initial registration with the list of stored PSIs to
request a synchronization for example if the UE powers up without USIM being
changed.
During Initial Registration, the (H-)PCF retrieves the list of PSIs and its
content stored in the (H-)UDR for this SUPI while the V-PCF (in the roaming
scenario) retrieves the list of PSIs and its content stored in the V-UDR for
the PLMN ID of this UE (alternatively, the V-PCF can have this information
configured locally).
NOTE 7: The PSI list and content stored/configured for a PLMN ID can be
structured according to e.g. location areas (e.g. TAs, PRAs). The V-PCF can
then provide PSIs and its content only if they correspond to the current UE
location.
In the roaming scenario, the V-PCF shall also forward any UE provided PSIs
that are associated to the home PLMN to the H-PCF.
When the PCF (i.e. the (H-)PCF as well as the V-PCF) receives a list of PSIs
associated to the PLMN of the PCF from the UE, the PCF compares the list of
PSIs provided by the UE and the list of PSIs retrieved from the UDR. In
addition, the PCF checks whether the list of PSIs provided by the UE or its
content needs to be updated according to operator policies, e.g. change of
Location and/or time. If the two lists of PSIs are different or an update is
necessary according to operator policies (which includes the case that the UE
did not provide a list of PSIs associated to the PLMN of the PCF), the PCF
provides the changes in the list of PSIs or the corresponding content to the
AMF which forwards them to the UE.
The (H-)PCF maintains the latest list of PSIs delivered to each UE as part of
the information related to the Policy Association until the UE policy
association termination request is received from the AMF. Then the (H-)PCF
stores the latest list of PSIs and its contents in the (H-)UDR using the
Nudr_DM_Update including DataSet \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"Policy Set
Entry\".
The (H-)PCF may use the PEI provided by the AMF and/or the OSId provided by
the UE, to determine the operating system of the UE.
If the PEI, the OSId or the indication of UE support for ANDSP is available to
the PCF, the PCF stores them in the UDR using Nudr_DM_Create including DataSet
\"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"UE context policy control data\" when such
information is received from the UE in the UE Policy Container.
If the (H-)PCF is not able to determine the operating system of the UE, and if
the (H-)PCF requires to deliver URSP rules that contain Application
descriptors as Traffic Descriptors, then the Traffic Descriptors of such URSP
rules include multiple instances of Application descriptors each associated to
supported UE operating systems by the network operator implementation.
If the (H-)PCF determines the operating system of the UE and if the (H-)PCF
requires to deliver URSP rules that contain Application descriptors as Traffic
Descriptors, then the Traffic Descriptors of such URSP rules include the
Application descriptors associated with the operating system determined by the
PCF.
NOTE 8: If the PCF does not take into account the received PEI and/or OSId
then the PCF can send URSP rules containing application traffic descriptors
associated to multiple operating systems.
#### 6.1.2.3 Management of packet flow descriptions
##### 6.1.2.3.1 PFD management
The Management of Packet Flow Descriptions enables the UPF to perform accurate
application detection when PFD(s) are provided by an ASP and then to apply
enforcement actions as instructed in the PCC Rule.
The operator is able to configure pre-defined PCC Rules in the SMF or dynamic
PCC Rules in the PCF that include at least an application identifier for
service data flow detection, charging control information, i.e. charging key
and optionally the Sponsor identifier or the ASP identifier or both. Depending
on the service level agreements between the operator and the Application
Server Provider, it may be possible for the ASP to provide individual PFDs or
the full set of PFDs for each application identifier maintained by the ASP to
the SMF via the PFD Management service in the NEF (PFDF). The PFDs become part
of the application detection filters in the SMF/UPF and therefore are used as
part of the logic to detect traffic generated by an application. The ASP may
remove or modify some or all of the PFDs which have been provided previously
for one or more application identifiers. The SMF may report the application
stop to the PCF for an application instance identifier as defined in clause
5.8.2.8.4 of TS 23.501 [2] if the removed/modified PFD in SMF/UPF results in
that the stop of the application instance is not being able to be detected.
NOTE 1: PFD management is optionally supported in the NEF and the SMF.
The ASP manages (provision, update, delete) the PFDs through the NEF (PFDF).
The PFD(s) are transferred to the SMF through the NEF (PFDF). The PFDF is a
logical functionality in the NEF which receives PFD(s) from the ASP through
the NEF, stores the PFD(s) in the UDR and provides the PFD(s) to the SMF(s)
either on the request from ASP PFD management through NEF (PFDF) (push mode)
or on the request from SMF (pull mode). The PFDF functionality is a service
provided by the NEF.
The ASP may provide/update/remove PFDs with an allowed delay to the NEF
(PFDF). Upon reception of the request from the ASP, the NEF (PFDF) shall check
if the ASP is authorized to provide/update/remove those PFD(s) and request the
allowed delay. The NEF (PFDF) may be configured with a minimum allowed delay
based on SLA to authorize the allowed delay provided by the ASP. When ASP and
requested allowed delay are successfully authorized, the NEF (PFDF) shall
translate each external application identifier to the corresponding
application identifier known in the core network. The NEF (PFDF) stores the
PDF(s) into the UDR.
NOTE 2: The Allowed Delay is an optional parameter. If the Allowed Delay is
included, it indicates that the requested PFD(s) should be deployed within the
time interval indicated by the Allowed Delay.
The PFDs may be retrieved by SMF from NEF (PFDF) in \"pull\" mode or may be
provisioned from NEF (PFDF) to the SMF in \"push\" mode.
When the \"push\" mode is used, the NEF (PFDF) retrieves from the UDR the PFDs
for each application identifier and distributes them to those SMFs that enable
access to those applications. There are three methods to provision PFD(s) from
the NEF (PFDF) to the SMF:
a) Push of whole PFD(s) that can be accessed by the NEF (PFDF) according to
operator configuration in NEF (PFDF) (e.g. provision per day according to
operator configuration);
b) Selective push of an ASP change in the PFD set (i.e. ASP changes the PFD
set while operator configuration defines when to push);
c) Selective push of an ASP change in the PFD set according to ASP request
(i.e. ASP indicates to push changes in a PFD set within the time interval
indicated by the Allowed Delay).
When the \"pull\" mode is used, at the time a PCC Rule with an application
identifier for which PFDs are not available is activated or provisioned, the
SMF requests all PFDs for that application identifier from the NEF (PFDF), and
NEF (PFDF) retrieves them from the UDR. The PFD(s) retrieved for an
application identifier from the NEF (PFDF) are cached in the SMF, and the SMF
maintains a caching timer associated to the PFD(s) to control how long the
PFD(s) are valid. When the caching timer expires:
\- If there are still active PCC rules that refer to the corresponding
application identifier, the SMF reloads the PFD(s) from the NEF (PFDF) and
provides it to the UPF over N4;
\- If there\'s no active PCC rule that refers to the corresponding application
identifier or the SMF removes the last PCC rule that refers to the
corresponding application identifier, the SMF removes the PFD(s) identified by
the application identifier and informs the UPF to remove the PFD(s) identified
by the application identifier over N4.
NOTE 3: It is assumed that all SMF(s) and PFD (s) in an operator network are
configured with the same default caching time value to be applied for all
application identifiers.
When the \"pull\" mode is used, the NEF (PFDF) may provide to the SMF a
caching time value per application identifier. The SMF receives the caching
time value together with the PFD(s) from the NEF (PFDF) over N29 and applies
this value for the application identifier instead of the configured default
caching time value. If no caching time value is received from NEF (PFDF), the
SMF uses the configured default caching time value.
NOTE 4: The configuration of a caching time value per application identifier
in NEF (PFDF) is based on the SLA between the operator and the ASP.
When only \"pull\" mode is used in one PLMN for an application identifier, if
the Allowed Delay is shorter than the caching time value stored for this
application identifier, or shorter than the default caching time if no
application-specific caching time is stored, the NEF (PFDF) may still store
the PFD(s) to the UDR. The NEF (PFDF) shall provide an indication that the
PFD(s) were stored and the caching time value to the ASP when informing that
the Allowed Delay could not be met.
When either \"pull\" mode or \"push\" mode is used, if there\'s any update of
the PFD(s) received and there are still active application detection rules in
the UPF for the application identifier, the SMF shall provision the updated
PFD set corresponding to the application identifier to the UPF.
NOTE 5: SMF should assure not to overload N4 signalling while managing PFD(s)
to the UPF, e.g. forwarding the PFD(s) to the right UPF where the PFD(s) is
enforced.
When the UPF receives the updated PFD(s) from either the same or different SMF
for the same application identifier, the latest received PFD(s) shall
overwrite any existing PFD(s) stored in the UPF.
If the PFDs are managed by local O&M procedures, PFD retrieval is not used;
otherwise, the PFDs retrieved from NEF (PFDF) overrides any PFDs pre-
configured in the SMF. The SMF shall manage the pre-configured PFDs and PFDs
provided by the NEF (PFDF) at the UPF as defined in clause 5.8.2.8.4 of TS
23.501 [2]. The SMF may differentiate the need for PFD retrieval based on
operator configuration in the SMF.
The AF requests including an application identifier may trigger the activation
or provisioning of a PCC Rule in the SMF by the PCF based on operator
policies.
##### 6.1.2.3.2 Packet Flow Description
PFD (Packet Flow Description) is a set of information enabling the detection
of application traffic.
Each PFD may be identified by a PFD id. A PFD id is unique in the scope of a
particular application identifier. Conditions for when PFD ID is included in
the PFD is described in TS 29.551 [17]. There may be different PFD types
associated to an application identifier.
A PFD include the following information:
\- PFD id; and
\- one or more of the following:
\- 3-tuple(s) including protocol, server side IP address and port number;
\- the significant parts of the URL to be matched, e.g. host name;
\- a Domain name matching criteria and information about applicable
protocol(s).
NOTE 1: Based on the agreement between AF and mobile operator, the PFD can be
designed to convey proprietary extension for proprietary application traffic
detection mechanisms.
NOTE 2: How the PFD(s) are used in service flow detection is specified in
clause 6.2.2.2.
#### 6.1.2.4 Negotiation for future background data transfer
The AF may contact the PCF via the NEF (and Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Create
service operation) to request a time window and related conditions for future
background data transfer.
NOTE 1: The NEF may contact any PCF in the operator network.
The AF request shall contain an ASP identifier, the volume of data to be
transferred per UE, the expected amount of UEs, the desired time window, the
External Group Identifier and optionally, Network Area Information, MAC
address or IP 3-tuple to identify the Application server, request for
notification. The AF provides as Network Area Information either a
geographical area (e.g. a civic address or shapes), or an area of interest
that includes a list of TAs or list of NG-RAN nodes and/or a list of cell
identifiers. When the AF provides a geographical area, then the NEF maps it
based on local configuration into of a short list of TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes
and/or cells identifiers that is provided to the PCF. The NEF may map the ASP
id based on local configuration into the DNN, S-NSSAI that is provided to the
PCF. The request for notification is an indication that the ASP accepts that
the BDT policy can be re-negotiated using the BDT warning notification
procedure described in clause 4.16.7.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 2: A 3rd party application server is typically not able to provide any
specific network area information and if so, the AF request is for the whole
operator network.
The PCF shall first retrieve all existing BDT policies stored for any ASP from
the UDR. The PCF may retrieve analytics on \"Network Performance\" from NWDAF
following the procedure and services described in TS 23.288 [24]. Afterwards,
the PCF shall determine, based on the information provided by the AF, the
analytics on \"Network Performance\" if available and other available
information (e.g. network policy and existing BDT policies) one or more BDT
policies. The PCF may be configured to map the ASP identifier into a target
DNN and slicing information (i.e. S-NSSAI), that is used if the NEF did not
provide the DNN, S-NSSAI to the PCF.
A BDT policy consists of a recommended time window for the background data
transfer, a reference to a charging rate for this time window and optionally a
maximum aggregated bitrate (indicating that the charging according to the
referenced charging rate is only applicable for the aggregated traffic of all
involved UEs that stays below this value). Finally, the PCF shall provide the
candidate list of BDT policies or the selected BDT policy to the AF via NEF
together with the Background Data Transfer Reference ID. If the AF received
more than one BDT policy, the AF shall select one of them and inform the PCF
about the selected BDT policy.
NOTE 3: The maximum aggregated bitrate (optionally provided in a BDT policy)
is not enforced in the network. The operator may apply offline CDRs processing
(e.g. combining the accounted volume of the involved UEs for the time window)
to determine whether the maximum aggregated bitrate for the set of UEs was
exceeded by the ASP and charge the excess traffic differently.
NOTE 4: It is assumed that the 3rd party application server is configured to
understand the reference to a charging rate based on the agreement with the
operator.
The selected BDT policy together with the Background Data Transfer Reference
ID, the network area information, the volume of data to be transferred per UE,
the expected amount of UEs, ASP Id, MAC address or IP 3-tuple to identify the
Application server, the one or more route selection component (DNN, S-NSSAI),
the desired time window, the Network Area Information (if provided by the AF)
and whether the AF accepts BDT policy re-negotiation or not is stored by the
PCF in the UDR as Data Set \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"Background Data
Transfer data\". The same or a different PCF can retrieve this BDT policy and
corresponding related information from the UDR and take them into account for
future decisions about BDT policies related to the same or other ASPs.
When the AF wants to apply the Background Data Transfer Policy to an existing
session, then the AF will, at the time the BDT is about to start, provide, for
each UE, the Background Data Transfer Reference ID together with the AF
session information to the PCF (via the N5 interface). The PCF retrieves the
corresponding BDT policy from Policy Data Set in the UDR and derives the PCC
rules for the BDT according to this transfer policy.
When the AF wants to apply the Background Data Transfer Policy to a future
session, then the AF provides, to the NEF, the Background Data Transfer
Reference ID together with the External Identifier (i.e. GPSI) or External
Group Identifier of the UE(s) that are to be subject to the policy. The NEF
translates the External Group Identifier into the Internal Group Identifier or
the External Identifier into a SUPI. The NEF stores the Background Data
Transfer Reference ID, in the UDR as Application Data Set and Background Data
transfer data Subset for an Internal Group Identifier or a SUPI and the ASP id
requesting to apply the Background Data transfer Policy to a future session
for the UE(s). A PCF that serves the UE(s) (i.e. the PCF that serves the UE
for UE Policies) may retrieve the Background Data Transfer Reference ID by
retrieving the UE\'s Application Data from the UDR or by subscribing to
notifications of changes to the UEs\' Application Data in the UDR.
Furthermore, the PCF retrieves the specific Background Data Transfer Policy
and if available MAC address or IP 3-tuple to identify the Application server
based on the received Background Data Transfer Reference ID stored as Policy
Data Set from the UDR.
When the PCF determines to send the Background Data Transfer Policy
information to the UE as part of a URSP rule, the PCF will store the policy in
the UDR as part of the UE\'s Policy Set Entry and will use the associated
S-NSSAI and DNN associated with the ASP id stored in the Application Data to
store the Background Data Transfer Reference ID in the UE\'s PDU Session
policy control subscription information (see clause 6.2.1.3). The PCF uses
local policies to decide if and when the Background Data Transfer Policy
information is going to be sent to the UE as Validation Criteria in the RSD
part of the URSP rule (see clause 6.6.2.1). The UE uses Validation Criteria to
determine whether or not a PDU Session should be established. The Time Window
and Location Criteria are not required to be checked again during the lifetime
of the PDU Session.
The PCF may, based on operator configuration, trigger the UE Configuration
Update procedure when the policy is selected, or the PCF may wait until
receiving a notification from the AMF that the UE has entered the Tracking
Area or Presence Area where the policy applies, and/or the PCF may wait until
the time window when the policy applies is approaching. The UE\'s support of
the Validation Criteria in a URSP rule is optional.
NOTE 5: If a non-supporting UE receives Validation Criteria, it ignores the
URSP rule.
When the PDU Session is established, the PCF that serves the PDU Session will
use the Background Data Transfer Reference ID in the UE\'s PDU Session policy
control subscription information (see clause 6.2.1.3) to retrieve the
corresponding BDT policy (i.e. Time Window and/or Location Criteria) from the
UDR and derives the PCC rules for the BDT according to this transfer policy.
NOTE 6: The AF will typically contact the PCF for the individual UEs to
request sponsored connectivity for the BDT.
NOTE 7: A transfer policy is only valid until the end of its time window. The
removal of outdated transfer policies from the UDR is up to implementation.
The PCF may reject corresponding SM Policy Association, as described in clause
4.16.4 of TS 23.502 [3], if Validation condition is not satisfied. And based
on this feedback, SMF will reject the PDU Session setup.
After successful PDU Session setup, PCF may trigger PDU Session release when
Validation condition is not satisfied.
The PCF may subscribe to analytics on \"Network Performance\" from NWDAF for
the area of interest and time window of a BDT policy following the procedure
and services described in TS 23.288 [24] indicating a Reporting Threshold in
the Analytics Reporting information. The value for the Reporting Threshold is
set by the PCF based on operator configuration. When the NWDAF determines that
the network performance goes below the threshold, the NWDAF notifies the PCF
with the network performance analytics in the area of interest and time
window. When the PCF gets the notification from the NWDAF, the PCF may try to
re-negotiate the affected BDT policies with AFs that accepted BDT policy re-
negotiation. To do this, the PCF retrieves all the BDT policies together with
their additionally stored AF provided information (e.g. their corresponding
desired time window) from the UDR, identifies the BDT policies that are not
desirable anymore due to the degradation of the network performance and tries
to calculate new candidate BDT policies for the ASP(s) to select from. If the
PCF does not find any new candidate BDT policy or the related AF did not
accept BDT policy re-negotiation, the previously negotiated BDT policy shall
be kept and no interaction with the ASP shall occur. If the PCF finds one or
more new candidate BDT policies, the PCF notifies the related ASP(s) on both
the BDT policy that is not valid any longer and the candidate BDT policies via
NEF.
The PCF invalidates the BDT policy stored in the UDR for the corresponding BDT
reference ID while the BDT policy re-negotiation is ongoing. The PCF shall
reject a PDU Session request corresponding to an invalid BDT policy.
When the AF receives the notification, the AF may select one of the BDT
policies included in the candidate list, and then inform the PCF about the
selected BDT policy. The PCF stores the newly selected BDT policy into the UDR
for the corresponding Background Data Transfer Reference ID and removes the
BDT policy that is no longer valid. As a consequence, the PCF identifies the
UEs for which the BDT policy was already applied and updates URSP rules with
the new Validation Criteria as described in clause 4.16.12.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 8: A PCF can subscribe to notifications on changes in BDT policy in UDR.
Upon reception of such notification the PCF has also to identify the UEs for
which the BDT policy was already applied and update URSP rules with the new
Validation Criteria as described in clause 4.16.12.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
If the AF does not select one of the BDT policies included in the candidate
list, the PCF removes the BDT policy stored in the UDR together with the
corresponding Background Data Transfer Reference ID and all related
information. As a consequence, the PCF identifies the UEs for which the
background transfer policy was already applied and removes the URSP rules
corresponding to the BDT policy using the procedure described in clause
4.16.12.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 9: The PCF can also remove the no longer valid BDT policy after an
operator configurable time for the case that the AF does not respond.
#### 6.1.2.5 Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for AMF
The Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for AMF and 3GPP access type are
listed in table 6.1.2.5-1 and define the conditions when the AMF shall
interact again with PCF after the AM Policy Association Establishment or UE
Policy Association Establishment.
The PCF provides Policy Control Request Triggers to the AMF indicating a
specific UE (i.e. SUPI or PEI) in the Policy Association establishment and
modification procedures defined in the TS 23.502 [3]. The Policy Control
Request Triggers are transferred from the old AMF to the new AMF when the AMF
changes.
The PCR triggers are not applicable any longer at termination of the AM Policy
Association or termination of UE Policy Association.
Table 6.1.2.5-1: Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for AMF and 3GPP
access type
Policy Control Request Trigger Description Condition for reporting
* * *
Location change (tracking area) The tracking area of the UE has changed. PCF
(AM Policy, UE Policy) Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area The UE
is entering/leaving a Presence Reporting Area PCF (AM Policy, UE Policy)
Service Area restriction change The subscribed service area restriction
information has changed. PCF (AM Policy) RFSP index change The subscribed RFSP
index has changed PCF (AM Policy) Change of the Allowed NSSAI The Allowed
NSSAI has changed PCF (AM Policy) UE-AMBR change The subscribed UE-AMBR has

DNN or UE request for a DNN within the list of DNN candidates for replacement
per S-NSSAI PCF (AM Policy) Connectivity state changes The connectivity state
of UE is changed PCF (UE Policy)
NOTE: In the following description of the Policy Control Request Triggers
relevant for AMF and 3GPP access type, the term trigger is used instead of
Policy Control Request Trigger where appropriate.
If the Location change trigger are armed, the AMF shall activate the relevant
procedure which reports any changes in location as explained in clause 5.6.11
of TS 23.501 [2] by subscribing with the Npcf_AMPolicyAssociation service or
Npcf_UEPolicyAssociation service. The reporting is requested to the level
indicated by the trigger (i.e. Tracking Area). The AMF reports that the
Location change trigger was met and the Tracking Area identifier.
If the Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area trigger is armed, i.e.
the PCF subscribed to reporting change of UE presence in a Presence Reporting
Area, including a list of PRA ids. In addition, for \"UE-dedicated Presence
Reporting Area\" a short list of TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes and/or cells
identifiers is included. Then, the AMF shall activate the relevant procedure
which reports any Change of UE presence in Area of Interest as explained in
clause 5.6.11 of TS 23.501 [2]. The reporting is requested for the specific
condition when target UE moved into a specified PRA. The AMF reports the PRA
Identifier(s) and indication(s) whether the UE is inside or outside the
Presence Reporting Area(s) to the PCF.
The Service Area restriction change trigger and the RFSP index change trigger
shall trigger the AMF to interact with the PCF for all changes in the Service
Area restriction or RFSP index data received in AMF from UDM. The reporting
includes that the trigger is met and the subscribed Service Area restriction
or the subscribed RFSP index provided to AMF by UDM, as described in clause
6.1.2.1.
The Change of the Allowed NSSAI trigger shall trigger the AMF to interact with
the PCF if the Allowed NSSAI has been changed. The reporting includes that the
trigger is met and the new Allowed NSSAI. The PCF may update RFSP index and/or
SMF selection management related policy control information (described in
clause 6.5) in the AMF based on the Allowed NSSAI.
The UE-AMBR change trigger shall trigger the AMF to interact with the PCF for
all changes in the subscribed UE-AMBR data received in AMF from UDM. The
reporting includes that the trigger is met and the subscribed UE-AMBR provided
to AMF by UDM, as described in clause 6.1.2.1.
If the PLMN change trigger is armed, the AMF shall report it to the PCF to
trigger the update of V2X service authorization parameters to the UE as
defined in clause 6.2.2 of TS 23.287 [28]. The reporting includes the event
with the serving PLMN ID.
If the SMF selection management trigger is set, then the AMF shall contact the
PCF when the AMF detects that the UE requested an unsupported DNN and the PCF
indicated DNN replacement of unsupported DNNs in the Access and mobility
management related policy control information (see clause 6.5). The PCF shall
select a DNN and provide the selected DNN to the AMF.
If the SMF selection management trigger is set, then the AMF shall contact the
PCF when the UE requested a DNN within the list of DNN candidates for
replacement for the S-NSSAI indicated in the Access and mobility management
related policy control information (see clause 6.5). The PCF shall select the
DNN and provide the selected DNN to the AMF.
If the Connectivity state changes trigger is set, then the AMF shall notify
the PCF when the UE connectivity state is changed e.g. from IDLE to CONNECTED.
The AMF then reset the trigger.
### 6.1.3 Session management related policy control
#### 6.1.3.1 General
The session management related policy control functionality of the Policy and
Charging control framework for the 5G system provides the functions for policy
and charging control as well as event reporting for service data flows.
The PCF evaluates operator policies that are triggered by events received from
the AF, from the SMF, from the AMF and from the CHF as well as changes in User
subscription Profile.
NOTE 1: The details for credit management and reporting are defined in SA WG5
specification.
NOTE 2: In single PCF deployment, the PCF will provide all mobility, access
and session related policies that it is responsible for. In deployments where
different PCFs support N15 and N7 respectively, no standardized interface
between them is required in this release to support policy alignment.
NOTE 3: Policy control in multiple administrative areas is not defined in this
release.
NOTE 4: Events received from the AF include changes in global policy related
instructions (as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2]).
The following clauses describe the most relevant session management related
functionality in detail.
#### 6.1.3.2 Binding mechanism
##### 6.1.3.2.1 General
The binding mechanism is the procedure that associates a service data flow
(defined in a PCC rule by means of the SDF template), to the QoS Flow deemed
to transport the service data flow. For service data flows belonging to AF
sessions, the binding mechanism shall also associate the AF session
information with the QoS Flow that is selected to carry the service data flow.
NOTE 1: The relation between AF sessions and rules depends only on the
operator configuration. An AF session can be covered by one or more PCC rules,
if applicable (e.g. one rule per media component of an IMS session).
NOTE 2: The PCF may authorize dynamic PCC rules for service data flows without
a corresponding AF session.
The binding mechanism includes three steps:
1\. Session binding;
2\. PCC rule authorization; and
3\. QoS Flow binding.
##### 6.1.3.2.2 Session binding
Session binding is the association of the AF session information to one and
only one PDU Session. The PCF shall perform the session binding, which may
take the following PDU Session parameters into account:
a) For an IP type PDU Session, the UE IPv4 address and/or IPv6 network prefix,
in addition when using W-5GAN the description in TS 23.316 [27] applies;
For an Ethernet type PDU Session, the UE MAC address(es);
b) The UE identity (e.g. SUPI), if present;
c) The information about the Data Network (DN) the user is accessing, i.e.
DNN, if present.
Once it has determined the impacted PDU Session, the PCF shall identify the
PCC rules affected by the AF session information, including new PCC rules to
be installed and existing PCC rules to be modified or removed.
Session Binding applies for PDU Sessions of IP type. It may also apply to
Ethernet PDU Session type but only when especially allowed by PCC related
Policy Control Request triggers.
##### 6.1.3.2.3 PCC rule authorization
PCC Rule authorization is the selection of the 5G QoS parameters, described in
clause 5.7.2 of TS 23.501 [2], for the PCC rules.
The PCF shall perform the PCC rule authorization for dynamic PCC rules
belonging to AF sessions that have been selected in step 1, as described in
clause 6.1.3.2.2, as well as for PCC rules without corresponding AF sessions.
For the authorization of a PCC rule the PCF shall consider any 5GC specific
restrictions, subscription information and other information available to the
PCF. Each PCC rule receives a set of QoS parameters that are supported by the
specific Access Network. The authorization of a PCC rule associated with an
emergency service shall be supported without subscription information. The PCF
shall apply local policies configured for the emergency service.
##### 6.1.3.2.4 QoS Flow binding
QoS Flow binding is the association of a PCC rule to a QoS Flow within a PDU
Session. The binding is performed using the following binding parameters:
\- 5QI;
\- ARP;
\- QNC (if available in the PCC rule);
\- Priority Level (if available in the PCC rule);
\- Averaging Window (if available in the PCC rule);
\- Maximum Data Burst Volume (if available in the PCC rule).
When the PCF provisions a PCC Rule, the SMF shall evaluate whether a QoS Flow
with QoS parameters identical to the binding parameters exists unless the PCF
requests to bind the PCC rule to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule. If no such QoS Flow exists, the SMF derives the QoS parameters, using
the parameters in the PCC Rule, for a new QoS Flow, binds the PCC Rule to the
QoS Flow and then proceeds as described clause 5.7.1.5 of TS 23.501 [2] to
establish the new QoS Flow. If a QoS Flow with QoS parameters identical to the
binding parameters exists, the SMF binds the PCC Rule to this QoS Flow and
proceeds as described clause 5.7.1.5 of TS 23.501 [2] to modify the QoS Flow
unless local policies or the below mentioned conditions (which QoS Flow
binding shall ensure), require the establishment of a new QoS Flow following
the actions described above.
NOTE 1: For PCC rules containing a delay critical GBR 5QI value, the SMF can
bind PCC Rules with the same binding parameters to different QoS Flows to
ensure that the GFBR of the QoS Flow can be achieved with the Maximum Data
Burst Volume of the QoS Flow.
The SMF shall identify the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule based
on the fact that the PCC rule(s) bound to this QoS Flow contain:
\- 5QI and ARP values that are identical to the PDU Session related
information Authorized default 5QI/ARP; or
\- a Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and apply PCC rule
parameters Indication.
NOTE 2: The Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and apply
PCC rule parameters Indication has to be used whenever the PDU Session related
information Authorized default 5QI/ARP (as described in clause 6.3.1) cannot
be directly used as the QoS parameters of the QoS Flow associated with the
default QoS rule, for example when a GBR 5QI is used or the 5QI priority level
has to be changed.
When a QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule exists, the PCF can
request that a PCC rule is bound to this QoS Flow by including the Bind to QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rule Indication in a dynamic PCC rule. In
this case, the SMF shall bind the dynamic PCC rule to the QoS Flow associated
with the default QoS rule (i.e. ignoring the binding parameters) and keep the
binding as long as this indication remains set. When the PCF removes the
association of a PCC rule to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule, a new binding may need to be created between this PCC rule and a QoS
Flow based on the binding mechanism described above.
The binding created between a PCC Rule and a QoS Flow causes the downlink part
of the service data flow to be directed to the associated QoS Flow at the UPF
(as described in clause 5.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2]). In the UE, the QoS rule
associated with the QoS Flow (which is generated by the SMF and explicitly
signalled to the UE as described in clause 5.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2]) instructs
the UE to direct the uplink part of the service data flow to the QoS Flow in
the binding.
Whenever the binding parameters of a PCC rule changes, the binding of this PCC
rule shall be re-evaluated, i.e. the binding mechanism described above is
performed again. The re-evaluation may, for a PCC rule, result in a new
binding with another QoS Flow. If the PCF requests the same change of the
binding parameter value(s) for all PCC rules that are bound to the same QoS
Flow, the SMF should not re-evaluate the binding of these PCC rules and
instead, modify the QoS parameter value(s) of the QoS Flow accordingly.
NOTE 3: A QoS change of the PDU Session related information Authorized default
5QI/ARP values doesn\'t cause the QoS Flow rebinding for PCC rules with the
Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule Indication set.
When the PCF removes a PCC Rule, the SMF shall remove the association of the
PCC Rule to the QoS Flow. If the last PCC rule that is bound to a QoS Flow is
removed, the SMF shall delete the QoS Flow.
When a QoS Flow is removed, the SMF shall remove the PCC rules bound to this
QoS Flow and report to the PCF that the PCC Rules bound to a QoS Flow are
removed.
The QoS Flow binding shall also ensure that:
\- when the PCF provisions a PCC rule, and if the PCC rule contains a TSC
Assistance Container, the PCC rule is bound to a new QoS Flow and no other PCC
rule is bound to this QoS Flow. Whenever the TSC Assistance container of an
existing PCC rule is changed, the binding of this PCC rule shall not be re-
evaluated.
\- if a dynamic value for the Core Network Packet Delay Budget (defined in
clause 5.7.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2]) is used, PCC rules with the same above
binding parameters but different PDU Session anchors (i.e. the corresponding
service data flows which have different CN PDBs) are not bound to the same QoS
Flow.
NOTE 4: Different PDU Session anchors can exist if the DNAI parameter of PCC
rules contains multiple DNAIs.
\- For MA PDU Session, PCC rules for GBR or delay critical GBR service data
flows allowed on different access are not bound to the same QoS Flow even if
the PCC rules contain the same binding parameters.
NOTE 5: For MA PDU Session, the GBR or delay critical GBR resource for a
service data flow is allocated only in one access (as described in clause
5.32.4 of TS 23.501 [2]).
\- When the PCF provisions a PCC rule with Alternative QoS parameter Set(s),
the PCC rule is bound to a new QoS Flow and no other PCC rule is bound to this
QoS Flow.
\- When the PCF provisions a PCC rule with QoS Monitoring Policy, the PCC rule
is bound to a new QoS Flow and no other PCC rules is bound to this QoS Flow.
NOTE 6: The binding of PCC rule with QoS Monitoring policy to a new QoS flow
is only applicable to the Per QoS Flow per UE QoS Monitoring (as described in
clause 5.33.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]).
#### 6.1.3.3 Reporting
Reporting refers to the differentiated PDU Session resource usage information
(measured at the UPF) being reported by the SMF to the CHF.
NOTE 1: Reporting usage information to the CHF is distinct from credit
management. Hence multiple PCC rules may share the same charging key for which
one credit is assigned whereas reporting may be at higher granularity if
serviced identifier level reporting is used.
The SMF shall report usage information for online and offline charging.
The SMF shall report usage information for each charging key value.
For service data flow charging, for the case of sponsored data connectivity,
the reports for offline charging shall report usage for each charging key,
Sponsor Identity and Application Service Provider Identity combination if
Sponsor Identity and Application Service Provider Identifier have been
provided in the PCC rules.
NOTE 2: Usage reports for online charging that include Sponsor Identity and
Application Service Provider Identity is not within scope of the specification
in this release. Online charging for sponsored data connectivity can be based
on charging key as described in Annex X.
The SMF shall report usage information for each charging key/service
identifier combination if service identifier level reporting is requested in
the PCC rule.
NOTE 3: For reporting purposes when charging is performed by the SMF:
a) the charging key value identifies a service data flow if the charging key
value is unique for that particular service data flow, and
b) if the service identifier level reporting is present then the service
identifier value of the PCC rule together with the charging key identify the
service data flow.
Charging information shall be reported based on the result from the service
data flow detection and measurement on a per PDU Session basis.
A report may contain multiple containers, each container associated with a
charging key, charging key and Sponsor Identity (in the case of sponsored
connectivity) or charging key/service identifier.
#### 6.1.3.4 Credit management
The credit management applies only for service data flow with online charging
method and shall operate on a per charging key basis. The SMF should initiate
one charging session with the CHF for each PDU Session subject to charging, in
order to perform credit management within the charging session.
NOTE 1: Independent credit control for an individual service/application may
be achieved by assigning a unique charging key value in the corresponding PCC
rule.
The SMF shall request a credit for each charging key occurring in a PCC rule.
It shall be up to operator configuration whether the SMF shall request credit
in conjunction with the PCC rule being activated or when the first packet
corresponding to the service is detected. The CHF may either grant or deny the
request for credit. The CHF shall strictly control the rating decisions.
NOTE 2: The term \'credit\' as used here does not imply actual monetary
credit, but an abstract measure of resources available to the user. The
relationship between this abstract measure, actual money, and actual network
resources or data transfer, is controlled by the CHF.
During PDU Session establishment and modification, the SMF shall request
credit using the information after applying policy enforcement action (e.g.
upgraded or downgraded QoS information), if applicable, even though the SMF
has not signalled this information to the AMF or RAN.
The events trigger information which may be received from the CHF, causing the
SMF to perform a usage reporting and credit request to CHF when the event
occurs are specified in TS 32.255 [21].
The CHF may subscribe to Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area at
any time during the life time of the charging session as described in TS
32.255 [21].
If the PCF set the Out of credit event trigger (see clause 6.1.3.5), the SMF
shall inform the PCF about the PCC rules for which credit is no longer
available together with the applied termination action.
#### 6.1.3.5 Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for SMF
The Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for SMF define the conditions
when the SMF shall interact again with PCF after a PDU Session establishment
as defined in the Session Management Policy Establishment and Session
Management Policy Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.502 [3].
The PCR triggers are not applicable any longer at termination of the SM Policy
Association.
The access independent Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for SMF are
listed in table 6.1.3.5-1.
The differences with table 6.2 and table A.4.3-2 in TS 23.203 [4] are shown,
either \"none\" means that the parameter applies in 5GS or \"removed\" meaning
that the parameter does not apply in 5GS, this is due to the lack of support
in the 5GS for this feature or \"modified\" meaning that the parameter applies
with some modifications defined in the parameter.

NOTE 1: In the following description of the access independent Policy Control
Request Triggers relevant for SMF, the term trigger is used instead of Policy
Control Request Trigger where appropriate.
When the EPS Fallback trigger is armed by the PCF, the SMF shall report the
event to the PCF when a QoS Flow with 5QI=1 is rejected due to EPS Fallback.
When the Location change trigger is armed, the SMF shall subscribe to the AMF
for reports on changes in location to the level indicated by the trigger. If
credit-authorization triggers and Policy Control Request Triggers require
different levels of reporting of location change for a single UE, the location
to be reported should be changed to the highest level of detail required.
However, there should be no request being triggered for PCC rules update to
the PCF if the report received is more detailed than requested by the PCF.
NOTE 2: The access network may be configured to report location changes only
when transmission resources are established in the radio access network.
The Resource modification request trigger shall trigger the PCF interaction
for all resource modification requests not tied to a specific QoS Flow
received by SMF. The resource modification request received by SMF may include
request for guaranteed bit rate changes for a traffic aggregate and/or the
association/disassociation of the traffic aggregate with a 5QI and/or a
modification of the traffic aggregate.
The enforced PCC rule request trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction to
request PCC rules from the PCF for an established PDU Session. This SMF
interaction shall take place within the Revalidation time limit set by the PCF
in the PDU Session related policy information. The SMF reports that the
enforced PCC rule request trigger was met and the enforced PCC Rules.
NOTE 3: The enforced PCC rule request trigger can be used to avoid signalling
overload situations e.g. due to time of day based PCC rule changes.
The UE IP address change trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction with the PCF
if a UE IP address is allocated or released during the lifetime of the PDU
Session. The SMF reports that the UE IP address change trigger was met and the
new or released UE IP address.
The UE MAC address change trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction with the PCF
if a new UE MAC address is detected or a used UE MAC address is inactive for a
specific period during the lifetime of the Ethernet type PDU Session. The SMF
reports that the UE MAC address change trigger was met and the new or released
UE MAC address.
NOTE 4: The SMF instructs the UPF to detect new UE MAC addresses or used UE
MAC address is inactive for a specific period as described in TS 23.501 [2].
The Access Network Charging Correlation Information trigger shall trigger the
SMF to report the assigned access network charging identifier for the PCC
rules that are accompanied with a request for this trigger at activation. The
SMF reports that the Access Network Charging Correlation Information trigger
was met and the Access Network Charging Correlation Information.
If the Usage report trigger is set and the volume or the time thresholds,
earlier provided by the PCF, are reached, the SMF shall report this situation
to the PCF. If both volume and time thresholds were provided and the
thresholds, for one of the measurements, are reached, the SMF shall report
this situation to the PCF and the accumulated usage since last report shall be
reported for both measurements.
The management of the Presence Reporting Area (PRA) functionality enables the
PCF to subscribe to reporting change of UE presence in a particular Presence
Reporting Area.
NOTE 5: PCF decides whether to subscribe to AMF or to SMF for those triggers
that are present in both tables 6.1.2.5-2 and 6.1.3.5-1. If the Change of UE
presence in Presence Reporting Area trigger is available on both AMF and SMF,
PCF should not subscribe to both AMF and SMF simultaneously.
Upon every interaction with the SMF, the PCF may activate / deactivate
reporting changes of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area by setting /
unsetting the corresponding trigger by providing the PRA Identifier(s) and
additionally the list(s) of elements comprising the Presence Reporting Area
for UE-dedicated Presence Reporting Area(s).
The SMF shall subscribe to the UE Location Change notification from the AMF by
providing an area of interest containing the PRA Identifier(s) and
additionally the list(s) of elements provided by the PCF as specified in
clause 5.6.11 of TS 23.501 [2] and clause 5.2.2.3.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
When the Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area trigger is armed,
i.e. when the PCF subscribes to reporting change of UE presence in a
particular Presence Reporting Area and the reporting change of UE presence in
this Presence Reporting Area was not activated before, the SMF subscribes to
the UE mobility event notification service provided by the AMF for reporting
of UE presence in Area of Interest which reports when the UE enters or leaves
a Presence Reporting Area (an initial report is received when the PDU Session
specific procedure is activated). The SMF reports the PRA Identifier(s) and
indication(s) whether the UE is inside or outside the Presence Reporting
Area(s), and indication(s) if the corresponding Presence Reporting Area(s) is
set to inactive by the AMF to the PCF.
NOTE 6: The serving node (i.e. AMF in 5GC or MME in EPC/EUTRAN) can activate
the reporting for the PRAs which are inactive as described in the TS 23.501
[2].
When PCF modifies the list of PRA id(s) to change of UE presence in Presence
Reporting Area for a particular Presence Reporting Area(s), the SMF removes or
adds the PRA id(s) provided in the UE mobility event notification service
provided by AMF for reporting of UE presence in Area Of Interest. When the PCF
unsubscribes to reporting change of UE presence in Presence reporting Area,
the SMF unsubscribes to the UE mobility event notification service provided by
AMF for reporting of UE presence in Area Of Interest, unless subscriptions to
AMF remains due to other triggers.
The SMF stores PCF subscription to reporting for changes of UE presence in
Presence Reporting Area and notifies the PCF with the PRA Identifier(s) and
indication(s) whether the UE is inside or outside the Presence Reporting
Area(s) based on UE location change notification in area of interest received
from the serving node according to the corresponding subscription.
NOTE 7: The SMF can also be triggered by the CHF to subscribe to notification
of UE presence in PRA from the AMF, and notifies the CHF when receiving
reporting of UE presence in PRA from the AMF, referring to TS 32.291 [20].
If PCF is configured with a PRA identifier referring to the list of PRA
Identifier(s) within a Set of Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas
as defined in TS 23.501 [2], it activates the reporting of UE entering/leaving
each individual PRA in the Set of Core Network predefined Presence Reporting
Areas, without providing the complete set of individual PRAs.
When a PRA set identified by a PRA Identifier was subscribed to report changes
of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area by the PCF, the SMF additionally
receives the PRA Identifier of the PRA set from the AMF, along with the
individual PRA Identifier(s) belonging to the PRA set and indication(s) of
whether the UE is inside or outside the individual Presence Reporting Area(s),
as described in TS 23.501 [2].
When the Out of credit detection trigger is set, the SMF shall inform the PCF
about the PCC rules for which credit is no longer available together with the
applied termination action.
When the Reallocation of credit detection trigger is set, the SMF shall inform
the PCF about the PCC rules for which credit has been reallocated after credit
was no longer available and the termination action was applied.
The Start of application traffic detection and Stop of application traffic
detection triggers shall trigger an interaction with PCF once the requested
application traffic is detected (i.e. Start of application traffic detection)
or the end of the requested application traffic is detected (i.e. Stop of
application traffic detection) unless it is requested within a specific PCC
Rule to mute such interaction for solicited application reporting or
unconditionally in the case of unsolicited application reporting. The
application identifier and service data flow descriptions, if deducible, shall
also be included in the report. An application instance identifier shall be
included in the report both for Start and for Stop of application traffic
detection when service data flow descriptions are deducible. This is done to
unambiguously match the Start and the Stop events.
At PCC rule activation, modification and deactivation the SMF shall send, as
specified in the PCC rule, the User Location Report and/or UE Timezone Report
to the PCF.
NOTE 8: At PCC rule deactivation the User Location Report includes information
on when the UE was last known to be in that location.
If the trigger for Access Network Information reporting is set, the SMF shall
check the need for access network information reporting after successful
installation/modification or removal of a PCC rule or upon termination of the
PDU Session. The SMF shall check the Access Network Information report
parameters (User Location Report, UE Timezone Report) of the PCC rules and
report the access network information to the PCF. The SMF shall not report any
subsequent access network information updates received from the PDU Session
without any previous updates of related PCC rule unless the associated QoS
Flow or PDU Session has been released.
If the SMF receives a request to install/modify or remove a PCC rule with
Access Network Information report parameters (User Location Report, UE
Timezone Report) set the SMF shall initiate a PDU Session modification to
retrieve the current access network information of the UE and forward it to
the PCF afterwards.
If the Access Network Information report parameter for the User Location
Report is set and the user location (e.g. cell) is not available to the SMF,
the SMF shall provide the serving PLMN identifier to the PCF.
The Credit management session failure trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction
with the PCF to inform about a credit management session failure and to
indicate the failure reason, and the affected PCC rules.
NOTE 9: As a result, the PCF may decide about e.g. PDU Session termination,
perform gating of services, switch to offline charging, change rating group,
etc.
NOTE 10: The Credit management session failure trigger applies to situations
wherein the PDU Session is not terminated by the SMF due to the credit
management session failure.
The default QoS change triggers shall trigger the PCF interaction for all
changes in the default QoS data received in SMF from the UDM.
The Session AMBR change trigger shall trigger the SMF to provide the Session-
AMBR to the PCF containing the DN authorised Session AMBR if received from the
DN-AAA, or the Subscribed Session-AMBR received from the UDM as described in
clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2].
The default QoS change trigger reports a change in the default 5QI/ARP
retrieved by SMF from UDM, as explained in clause 5.7.2.7 of TS 23.501 [2].
If the PCC Rules bound to a QoS Flow are removed when the corresponding QoS
Flow is removed or the PCC rules are failed to be enforced, the SMF shall
report this situation to the PCF. The PCF may then provide the same or updated
PCC rules for the established PDU Session.
If the trigger for successful resource allocation is set and the PCF has also
provided an indication that a specific PCC rule is subject to this trigger,
the SMF shall report to the PCF when the resources associated to this PCC rule
have been successfully allocated. The SMF shall report resource allocation
failure always to the PCF, independently of this trigger.
If the GFBR of the QoS Flow can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed trigger
is armed, the SMF shall check the need for reporting to the PCF when the SMF
receives an explicit notification from (R)AN indicating that GFBR of the QoS
Flow can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed or when the condition
described in clause 5.7.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2] is met during the handover. The
SMF shall report that GFBR of the QoS Flow can no longer (or can again) be
guaranteed accordingly to the PCF for those PCC rules which are bound to the
affected QoS Flow and have the QoS Notification Control (QNC) parameter set.
If additional information is received with the notification from NG-RAN (see
clause 5.7.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2]), the SMF shall also provide to the PCF the
reference to the Alternative QoS parameter set corresponding to the
Alternative QoS Profile referenced by NG-RAN. If NG-RAN has indicated that the
lowest priority Alternative QoS Profile cannot be fulfilled, the SMF shall
indicate to the PCF that the lowest priority Alternative QoS parameter set
cannot be fulfilled.
In an interworking scenario between 5GS and EPC/E-UTRAN, as explained in
clause 4.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the PCF may subscribe via the SMF also to the
Policy Control Request Triggers described in clause 6.1.2.5 when the UE is
served by the EPC/E-UTRAN.
The change of DN Authorization Profile Index shall trigger a SMF interaction
to send DN Authorization Profile Index to retrieve a list of PCC Rules (as
defined in clause 6.3) and/or PDU Session related policy (as defined in clause
6.4) for an established PDU Session.
If the trigger for 5GS Bridge information available is armed, the SMF shall
report the 5GS Bridge information when the SMF has determined or updated the
5GS Bridge information, e.g. when SMF has detected an Ethernet port which
supports exchange of Ethernet Port Management Information Containers or
received Bridge Management Information Container or Port Management
Information Container. If a new manageable Ethernet DS-TT port is detected,
the SMF provides 5GS Bridge ID, the port number and optionally MAC address of
the related port of the related PDU Session to the PCF. If the SMF has
received UE-DS-TT Residence Time then the SMF also provides UE-DS-TT Residence
Time to the PCF. If the SMF has received the Bridge Management Information
Container from NW-TT or Port Management Information Container from NW-TT or
DS-TT, the SMF also provides Bridge Management Information Container or Port
Management Information Container and related port number to the PCF.
When the QoS Monitoring for URLLC trigger is set, the SMF shall indicate the
RAN and the UPF to perform the measurement of the QoS parameters based on the
PCC rule information for QoS Monitoring as defined in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS
23.502 [3]. Upon receiving the QoS Monitoring report from the UPF, the SMF
sends the measurement report to the PCF.
If the Policy Control Request Trigger \"DDN Failure event subscription with
Traffic Descriptor\" or \"DDD Status event subscription with Traffic
Descriptor\" is set, the SMF shall request policies if it received a
subscription or cancellation of notifications for availability after DDN
Failure event with traffic descriptor or DDD Status event with traffic
descriptor, respectively. The SMF indicates whether it is a subscription or
cancellation event and provides the received Traffic Descriptor as well as the
requested type(s) of notifications (notifications about downlink packets being
buffered, and/or discarded) to the PCF. When the SMF indicates a subscription
event, the PCF checks whether an installed PCC rule exists for the received
Traffic Descriptor and if so, the PCF sets the Downlink Data Notification
Control information of that PCC rule according to the requested type(s) of
notifications. Otherwise, the PCF provides a new PCC Rule with the received
Traffic Descriptor in the SDF Template, the Downlink Data Notification Control
information set according to the requested type(s) of notifications and other
PCC Rule information set to the same values as in the existing PCC rule that
previously matched the traffic. When the new PCC has to be bound to the QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rules, the PCF sets the \"Bind to QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rule\" parameter. From now on, the PCF
needs to keep the PCC rule for the DDD event detection fully synchronized with
the existing PCC rule that previously matched the traffic for all other policy
and charging control settings to ensure the same user experience and traffic
treatment according to the operator policy. When the SMF indicates a
cancellation event, the PCF removes the Downlink Data Notification Control
information in the installed PCC Rule or removes the PCC Rule if a new PCC
rule has been provided during the subscription event and this PCC rule is no
longer necessary for any other policy enforcement.
NOTE 11: Downlink Data Delivery (DDD) status event and DDN Failure event are
specified in clause 4.15.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
The QoS constraints change trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction with the
PCF if QoS constraints are received by the SMF during the lifetime of the PDU
Session. The SMF reports that the QoS constraints change trigger was met and
the new QoS constraints.
#### 6.1.3.6 Policy control
QoS control refers to the authorization and enforcement of the maximum QoS
that is authorized for a service data flow, for a QoS Flow or for the PDU
Session. A service data flow may be either of IP type or of Ethernet type. PDU
Sessions may be of IP type or Ethernet type or unstructured.
The PCF, in a dynamic PCC Rule, associates a service data flow template to an
authorized QoS that is provided in a PCC Rule to the SMF. The PCF may also
activate a pre-defined PCC Rule that contains that association.
The authorized QoS for a service data flow template shall include a 5QI and
the ARP. For a 5QI of GBR or Delay-critical GBR resource type, the authorized
QoS shall also include the MBR, GBR and may include the QoS Notification
Control parameter (for notifications when authorized GFBR can no longer ( or
can again) be fulfilled). For 5QI of Non-GBR resource type, the authorized QoS
may include the MBR and the Reflective QoS Control parameter. The 5QI value
can be standardized (i.e. referring to QoS characteristics as defined in
clause 5.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), pre-configured (i.e. referring to QoS
characteristics configured in the RAN) or dynamically assigned (i.e. referring
to QoS characteristics provided by the PCF as Explicitly signalled QoS
Characteristics in the PDU Session related policy information described in
clause 6.4).
NOTE 1: Further details, special cases and additional parameters are described
in clause 6.3.1.
QoS control also refers to the authorization and enforcement of the Session-
AMBR and default 5QI/ARP combination. The PCF may provide the Authorized
Session-AMBR and the Authorized default 5QI and ARP combination as part of the
PDU Session information for the PDU Session to the SMF. The Authorized
Session-AMBR and Authorized default 5QI/ARP values takes precedence over other
values locally configured or received at the SMF.
In home routed roaming, the H-SMF may provide the QoS constraints received
from the VPLMN (defined in clause 4.3.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) to the H-PCF.
The H-PCF ensures that the Authorized Session-AMBR value does not exceed the
Session-AMBR value provided by the VPLMN and the Authorized default 5QI/ARP
contains a 5QI and ARP value supported by the VPLMN. If no QoS constraints are
provided the H-PCF considers that no QoS constraints apply unless operator
policies define any. The PCF shall also consider the QoS constraints for the
setting of the Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP and Subsequent Authorized
Session-AMBR.
For policy control, the AF interacts with the PCF and the PCF interacts with
the SMF as instructed by the AF. For certain events related to policy control,
the AF shall be able to give instructions to the PCF to act on its own, i.e.
based on the service information currently available. The following events are
subject to instructions from the AF:
\- The authorization of the service based on incomplete service information;
NOTE 2: The QoS authorization based on incomplete service information is
required for e.g. IMS session setup scenarios with available resources on
originating side and a need for resource reservation on terminating side.
\- The immediate authorization of the service;
\- The gate control (i.e. whether there is a common gate handling per AF
session or an individual gate handling per AF session component required);
\- The forwarding of QoS Flow level information or events (see clause
6.1.3.18).
To enable the binding functionality, the UE and the AF shall provide all
available flow description information (e.g. source and destination IP address
and port numbers and the protocol information).
#### 6.1.3.7 Service (data flow) prioritization and conflict handling
Service pre-emption priority enables the PCF to resolve conflicts where the
activation of all requested active PCC rules for services would result in a
cumulative authorized QoS which exceeds the Subscribed Guaranteed bandwidth
QoS.
NOTE 1: For example, the PCF may use the pre-emption priority of a service,
the activation of which would cause the subscriber\'s authorized QoS to be
exceeded. If this pre-emption priority is greater than that of any one or more
active PCC rules, the PCF can determine whether the deactivation of any one or
more such rules would allow the higher pre-emption priority PCC rule to be
activated whilst ensuring the resulting cumulative QoS does not exceed a
subscriber\'s Subscribed Guaranteed Bandwidth QoS.
If such a determination can be made, the PCF may resolve the conflict by
deactivating those selected PCC rules with lower pre-emption priorities and
accepting the higher priority service information from the AF. If such a
determination cannot be made, the PCF may reject the service information from
the AF.
NOTE 2: Normative PCF requirements for conflict handling are not defined.
Alternative procedures may use a combination of pre-emption priority and AF
provided priority indicator.
#### 6.1.3.8 Termination action
The termination action indicates the action which the SMF instructs the UPF to
perform for all PCC rules of a Charging key for which credit is no longer
available. The functional description for termination actions is described in
TS 32.255 [21].
The SMF shall revert the termination action related instructions for the UPF
for all PCC rules of a Charging key when credit is available again.
#### 6.1.3.9 Handling of packet filters provided to the UE by SMF
Traffic mapping information is signalled to the UE by the SMF in the Packet
Filter Sets of QoS rules as defined in TS 23.501 [2].
The network shall ensure that the traffic mapping information signalled to UE
reflects the QoS Flow binding of PCC rules, except for those extending the
inspection beyond what can be signalled to the UE. The PCC rules may restrict
what traffic is allowed compared to what is explicitly signalled to the UE.
The PCF may, per service data flow filter, indicate that the SMF is required
to explicitly signal the corresponding traffic mapping information to the UE,
e.g. for the purpose of IMS precondition handling at the UE. In absence of
that indication, it is an SMF decision whether to signal the traffic mapping
information that is redundant from a traffic mapping point of view.
For QoS Flow for services with no uplink IP flows, there is no need to provide
any UL filter to the UE that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in
uplink direction.
The default QoS rule will either contain a Packet Filter Set that allows all
UL packets or a Packet Filter Set that is generated from the UL SDF filters
(and from the DL SDF filters if they are available) which have an indication
to signal corresponding traffic mapping information to the UE.
NOTE: If multiple PCC rules with an indication to signal corresponding traffic
mapping information to the UE are bound to the QoS Flow associated with the
default QoS rule, it is up to SMF implementation which one will be chosen to
generate the default QoS rule. If the PCC rule that is chosen to generate the
default QoS rule is removed/deactivated, another PCC rule bound to the QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rule will be used instead and the default
QoS rule would be updated accordingly.
In the case of interworking with E-UTRAN connected to EPC, the specific
aspects of the handling of packet filters at the SMF are described in clause
4.11.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
#### 6.1.3.10 IMS emergency session support
PDU Sessions for IMS Emergency services are provided by the serving network to
support IMS emergency when the network is configured to support emergency
services. Emergency services are network services provided through an
Emergency DNN and may not require a subscription depending on operator
policies and local regulatory requirements. For emergency services, the
architecture for the non-roaming case is the only applicable architecture
model.
For emergency services, the N36 reference point does not apply. Emergency
services are handled locally in the serving network.
For a PDU Session serving an IMS emergency session, the PCF makes
authorization and policy decisions that restrict the traffic to emergency
destinations, IMS signalling and the traffic to retrieve user location
information (in the user plane) for emergency services. A PDU Session serving
an IMS emergency session shall not serve any other service and shall not be
converted to/from any PDU Session serving other services. The PCF shall
determine based on the DNN if a PDU Session concerns an IMS emergency session.
The PCC Rule Authorization function selects QoS parameters that allow
prioritization of IMS Emergency sessions. If an IMS Emergency session is
prioritized the QoS parameters in the PCC Rule shall contain an ARP value that
is reserved for intra-operator use of IMS Emergency services. The PCF does not
perform subscription check; instead it utilizes the locally configured
operator policies to make authorization and policy decisions.
NOTE 1: Reserved value range for intra-operator use is defined in TS 23.501
[2].
For an emergency DNN, the PCF does not perform subscription check; instead it
utilizes the locally configured operator policies to make authorization and
policy decisions.
It shall be possible for the PCF to verify that the IMS service information is
associated with a UE IP address belonging to an emergency DNN. If the IMS
service information does not contain an emergency related indication and the
UE IP address is associated with an emergency DNN, the PCF shall reject the
IMS service information provided by the P‑CSCF (and thus to trigger the
release of the associated IMS session), see TS 23.167 [12].
In addition, the PCF shall provide the IMEI and the subscriber identifiers
(IMSI, MSISDN) (if available), received from the SMF at PDU Session
establishment, if so requested by the P-CSCF.
If the PCF removes all PCC Rules with a 5QI other than the default 5QI and the
5QI used for IMS signalling, the SMF shall start a configurable inactivity
timer (e.g. to enable PSAP Callback session). When the configured period of
time expires the SMF shall terminate the PDU Session serving the IMS Emergency
session as defined in TS 23.502 [3]. If the SMF receives new PCC rule(s) with
a 5QI other than the default 5QI and the 5QI used for IMS signalling for the
PDU Session serving the IMS Emergency session, the SMF shall cancel the
inactivity timer.
#### 6.1.3.11 Multimedia Priority Service support
Multimedia Priority Services (MPS) is defined in TS 23.501 [2], TS 23.502 [3]
and in TS 23.228 [5], utilising the architecture defined for 5GS.
Subscription data for MPS is provided to PCF through the N36/Nudr. To support
MPS service, the PCF shall subscribe to changes in the MPS subscription data
for Priority PDU connectivity service. Dynamic invocation for MPS provided
from an AF using the Priority indicator over N5/Npcf takes precedence over MPS
subscription.
For dynamic invocation of MPS service, the PCF shall generate the
corresponding PCC rule(s) with the ARP and 5QI parameters as appropriate for
the prioritized service, as defined in TS 23.501 [2].
Whenever one or more AF sessions of an MPS service are active within the same
PDU Session, the PCF shall ensure that the ARP priority level of the QoS Flow
for signalling as well as the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule is
at least as high as the highest ARP priority level used by any authorized PCC
rule belonging to an MPS service. If the ARP pre-emption capability is enabled
for any of the authorized PCC rules belonging to an MPS service, the PCF shall
also enable the ARP pre-emption capability for the QoS Flow for signalling as
well as the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.
In the case of IMS MPS, in addition to the above, the following QoS Flow
handling applies:
\- At reception of the indication from subscription information that the IMS
Signalling Priority is set for the PDU Session or at reception of service
authorization from the P-CSCF (AF) including an MPS session indication and the
service priority level as defined in TS 23.228 [5], the PCF shall (under
consideration of the requirement described in clauses 5.16.5 and 5.22.3 in TS
23.501 [2]) modify the ARP in all the PCC rules that describe the IMS
signalling traffic to the value appropriate for IMS Multimedia Priority
Services, if upgrade of the QoS Flow carrying IMS Signalling is required. To
modify the ARP of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule the PCF
shall modify the Authorized default 5QI/ARP.
\- When the PCF detects that the P-CSCF (AF) released all the MPS session and
the IMS Signalling Priority is not set for the PDU Session the PCF shall
consider changes of the requirement described in clauses 5.16.5 and 5.22.3 in
TS 23.501 [2] and modify the ARP in all PCC rules that describe the IMS
signalling traffic to an appropriate value according to PCF decision. The PCC
rules bound to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule have to be
changed accordingly.
NOTE: To keep the PCC rules bound to this QoS Flow, the PCF can either modify
the ARP of these PCC rules accordingly or set the Bind to QoS Flow associated
with the default QoS rule.
The Priority PDU connectivity service targets the ARP and/or 5QI of the QoS
Flows, enabling the prioritization of all traffic on the same QoS Flow.
For non-MPS service, the PCF shall generate the corresponding PCC rule(s) as
per normal procedures (i.e. without consideration whether the MPS Priority PDU
connectivity service is active or not), and shall upgrade the ARP/5QI values
suitable for MPS when the Priority PDU connectivity service is invoked. When
the Priority PDU connectivity service is revoked, the PCF shall change the
ARP/5QI values modified for the Priority PDU connectivity service to an
appropriate value according to PCF decision.
The PCF shall, at the activation of the Priority PDU connectivity service:
\- modify the ARP of PCC rules installed before the activation of the Priority
PDU connectivity service to the ARP as appropriate for the Priority PDU
connectivity service under consideration of the requirement described in
clause 5.16.5 of TS 23.501 [2]; and
\- if modification of the 5QI of the PCC rule(s) is required, modify the 5QI
of the PCC rules installed before the activation of the Priority PDU
connectivity service to the 5QI as appropriate for this service.
The PCF shall, at the deactivation of the Priority PDU connectivity service
modify any 5QI and ARP value to the value according to the PCF policy
decision.
For PCC rules modified due to the activation of Priority PDU connectivity
service:
\- modify the ARP to an appropriate value according to PCF decision under
consideration of the requirement described in clauses 5.16.5 and 5.22.3 in TS
23.501 [2]; and
\- if modification of the 5QI of PCC rule(s) is required, modify the 5QI to an
appropriate value according to PCF decision.
#### 6.1.3.12 Redirection
Redirection of uplink application traffic is an option applicable in SMF or in
UPF.
PCF may control redirection by provisioning and modifying dynamic PCC rules
over the N7 interface, or activate/deactivate the predefined redirection
policies in SMF. The PCF may enable/disable redirection and set a redirect
destination for every dynamic PCC rule. Redirect information (redirection
enabled/disabled and redirect destination) within a PCC Rule instructs the SMF
whether or not to perform redirection towards a specific redirect destination.
The redirect destination may be provided as part of the dynamic PCC Rule, or
may be preconfigured in the SMF or UPF. A redirect destination provided in a
dynamic PCC Rule overrides the redirect destination preconfigured in the SMF
or UPF for this PCC Rule.
#### 6.1.3.13 Resource sharing for different AF sessions
The P-CSCF (i.e. AF) may indicate to the PCF that media of an AF session may
share resources with media belonging to other AF sessions according to TS
23.228 [5]. For every media flow, the P-CSCF may indicate that the media flow
may share resources in both directions or in one direction only (UL or DL).
The PCF makes authorization and policy decisions for the affected AF sessions
individually and generates a PCC rule for every media flow in any AF session.
If the PCF received identical indication(s) for resource sharing for multiple
AF sessions, the PCF may request the SMF to realize resource sharing for the
corresponding set of PCC rules. The PCF provides a DL and/or UL sharing
indication with the same value for those PCC rules that are candidate to share
resources according to the direction of resource sharing indicated by the AF.
For each direction, the SMF shall take the highest GBR value from each set of
PCC rules related with the same sharing indication for this direction and
bound to the same QoS Flow and uses that value as input for calculating the
GFBR of the QoS Flow. For each direction, the SMF may take the MBR value of
the most demanding PCC rule included in each set of PCC rules related with the
same sharing indication for this direction and bound to the same QoS Flow and
uses that as input for calculating the MFBR of the QoS Flow.
The AF session termination or modification procedure that removes media flows
triggers the removal of the corresponding PCC rules from the SMF. The SMF
shall recalculate the GFBR (and MFBR) value of the QoS Flow whenever a set of
PCC rules with the same sharing indication changes.
Resource sharing is applied as long as there are at least two active PCC rules
with the same sharing indication bound to the same QoS Flow.
Resource sharing for different AF sessions is possible only if the P-CSCF, the
PCF and the SMF support it.
NOTE: This procedure assumes that applications/service logic must do the
necessary coordination, e.g. pause sending or employ gating, to avoid service
data flows interfering and to ensure that multiple flows comply with the
combined QoS parameters.
#### 6.1.3.14 Traffic steering control
Traffic steering control is triggered by the PCF initiated request and
consists of steering the detected service data flows matching application
detection filters or service data flow filter(s) in PCC Rules. The traffic
steering control consists in:
\- diverting (at DNAI(s) provided in PCC rules) traffic matching traffic
filters provided by the PCF, as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].
\- applying a specific N6 traffic steering policy for the purpose of steering
the subscriber\'s traffic to appropriated N6 service functions deployed by the
operator or a 3rd party service provider as described below.
The PCF uses one or more pieces of information such as network operator\'s
policies, user subscription, user\'s current RAT, network load status,
application identifier, time of day, UE location, DNN, related to the
subscriber session and the application traffic as input for selecting a
traffic steering policy.
The PCF controls traffic steering by provisioning and modifying traffic
steering control information in PCC rules. Traffic steering control
information consists of a traffic description and a reference to a traffic
steering policy that is configured in the SMF.
The SMF instructs the UPF to perform necessary actions to enforce the traffic
steering policy referenced by the PCF. The actual traffic steering applies at
the UPF. For enforcing the traffic steering policy, the UPF may support
traffic steering related functions as defined by other standard organizations.
The mechanism used for routing the traffic over N6 is out of 3GPP scope.
#### 6.1.3.15 Resource reservation for services sharing priority
An AF may indicate to the PCF that a media flow of an AF session is allowed to
use the same priority as media flows belonging to other AF sessions (instead
of the service priority provided for this media flow). In this case, the AF
will provide a priority sharing indicator in addition to the application
identifier and the service priority. For MCPTT, the service priority and the
priority sharing indicator are defined in TS 23.179 [6]. The priority sharing
indicator is used to indicate what media flows are allowed to share priority.
The PCF makes authorization and policy decisions for the affected AF sessions
individually and generates a PCC rule for every media flow as specified in
clause 6.1.1.3. The application identifier and the service priority are used
to calculate the ARP priority. The AF may also provide suggested pre-emption
capability and vulnerability values per media flow to the PCF. The ARP pre-
emption capability and the ARP pre-emption vulnerability are set according to
operator policies and regulatory requirements, also taking into consideration
the application identifier and suggested values, when provided by the AF. The
priority sharing indicator is stored for later use.
For PCC rules with the same 5QI assigned and having an associated priority
sharing indicator, the PCF shall try to make authorization and policy
decisions taking the priority sharing indicator into account and modify the
ARP of these PCC rules as follows, (the original ARP values are stored for
later use):
\- The modified ARP priority is set to the highest of the original priority
among all the PCC rules that include the priority sharing indicator;
\- The modified ARP pre-emption capability is set if any of the original PCC
rules have the ARP pre-emption capability set;
\- The modified ARP pre-emption vulnerability is set if all the original PCC
rules have the ARP pre-emption vulnerability set.
If the PCF receives an indication that a PCC rule provisioning or modification
failed (due to resource reservation failure) then, the PCF may apply pre-
emption and remove active PCC rules from the SMF and then retry the PCC rule
provisioning or modification. If the PCF does not apply pre-emption, the AF is
notified using existing procedures that the resource reservation for the new
media flow failed.
The AF may optionally provide pre-emption control information, including pre-
emption capability and vulnerability values, in addition to the priority
sharing indicator to the PCF. If so, the PCF shall apply pre-emption and
remove active PCC rules according to this information when receiving an
indication that a PCC rule provisioning or modification failed. The pre-
emption control information indicates:
\- whether media flows sharing priority are candidates to being pre-empted
taking into account pre-emption capability and vulnerability values;
\- how to perform pre-emption among multiple potential media flow candidates
of same priority: most recently added media flow, least recently added media
flow, media flow with highest requested bandwidth in the AF request.
#### 6.1.3.16 3GPP PS Data Off
This feature, when activated by the user, prevents traffics via 3GPP access
except for 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services. The 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt
Services are a set of operator services, defined in TS 22.011 [15] and TS
23.221 [16], that are the only allowed services in both downlink and uplink
direction when the 3GPP PS Data Off feature has been activated by the user.
When PCF is deployed, it shall be able to configure the list(s) of 3GPP PS
Data Off Exempt Services for 3GPP access, and the Policy Control Request
Trigger of 3GPP PS Data Off status change used to inform the PCF from SMF
about every change of the 3GPP PS Data Off status.
NOTE 1: The PCF can be configured with a list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt
Services per DNN. The list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services for an DNN
can also be empty, or can allow for any service within that DNN, according to
operator policy.
NOTE 2: For the PDU Session used for IMS services, the 3GPP Data Off Exempt
Services are enforced in the IMS domain as specified TS 23.228 [5]. Policies
configured in the PCF need to ensure that IMS services are allowed when the
3GPP Data Off status of the UE is set to \"activated\", e.g. by treating any
service within a well-known IMS DNN as 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services.
When the PCF is informed about the activation of 3GPP PS Data Off, it shall
update the PCC rules in such a way that for 3GPP access only packets for
services belonging to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services are
forwarded while all other packets are discarded. Packets sent over non-3GPP
access are not affected, and in the case of MA PDU Session, this is ensured by
the MA PDU Session Control policy, e.g. for packets not belonging to the 3GPP
Data Off Exempt Services, PCF provides PCC rule containing Steering Mode
\"Active-Standby\" with active access as non-3GPP access and no standby access
for downlink and uplink direction.
NOTE 3: For non MA PDU Sessions, in order for the SMF/UPF to prevent the
services that do not belong to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempted
Services, if the services are controlled by dynamic PCC rules, the PCF could
modify the PCC rules by setting the gate status to \"closed\" for downlink and
optionally uplink direction in all active dynamic PCC rules or remove those
dynamic PCC rules. If the services are controlled by predefined PCC rules, the
PCF can deactivate those predefined PCC rules. PCC rule with wild-carded
service data flow filters can be among the PCC rules that are modified,
removed or deactivated in that manner. In this case, it can be necessary that
the PCF at the same time installs or activates PCC rules for data-off exempt
services.
NOTE 4: For example, for non MA PDU Sessions, four PCC rules (A, B, C, D) are
active for a PDU Session with PCC rule A representing a 3GPP PS Data Off
Exempt Service. When 3GPP PS Data Off is activated, the PCF could either
modify PCC rules B, C and D if they are dynamic PCC rules by closing the gate
in downlink and optionally uplink direction or remove/deactivate PCC rules B,
C and D if they are predefined PCC rules. PCC rule A does not need to be
changed as it represents 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service. Assuming that PCC
rule B contained wild-carded service data flow filters which has enabled some
3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service is removed or deactivated, an additional PCC
rule E can be installed or activated as well to enable downlink and optionally
uplink traffic for that 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service.
NOTE 5: The network configuration can ensure that at least one PCC Rule is
activated for the PDU Session when Data Off is activated in order to avoid
deletion of an existing PDU Session or in order not to fail a PDU Session
establishment.
When the PCF receives service information from the AF, in addition to what is
specified in clause 6.2.1, PCF shall check if the requested service
information belongs to the 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services. If the requested
service belongs to 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services or if the service traffic
can be sent over non-3GPP access, PCF shall continue as specified in clause
6.2.1. If the requested service doesn\'t belong to the 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt
Services and the PDU Session is established only over 3GPP access, PCF shall
reject the service request.
When the PCF is informed about the deactivation of 3GPP PS Data Off, it shall
perform policy control decision as specified in clause 6.2.1 and perform PCC
rule operations as specified in clause 6.3.2 to make sure that the services
are allowed according to user\'s subscription and operator policy
(irrespective of whether they belong to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt
Services).
When PCF is not deployed, predefined PCC rules, can be configured in the SMF,
on a per DNN basis, to ensure the following:
\- when the SMF is informed about activation of 3GPP PS Data Off, the SMF
shall update the predefined PCC rule in a way that for 3GPP access only
downlink and optionally uplink packets for services belonging to the list(s)
of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services are forwarded while all other downlink and
uplink packets are discarded. Packets sent over non-3GPP access are not
affected, and in the case of MA PDU Session, this is ensured by the MA PDU
Session Control policy, e.g. for packets not belonging to the 3GPP Data Off
Exempt Services, the SMF applies predefined PCC rule containing Steering Mode
\"Active-Standby\" with active access as non-3GPP access and no standby access
for downlink and uplink direction; and
\- When SMF is informed about deactivation of 3GPP PS Data Off, the SMF
ensures in UPF downlink and uplink packets are forwarded according to the
operator policy for the subscriber.
NOTE 6: For example, for non MA PDU Sessions the SMF can be configured with
two sets of predefined PCC rules: one set for UE 3GPP PS Data Off status
\"inactive\" and another set for UE 3GPP PS Data Off status \"active\". The
set of predefined PCC rules for UE 3GPP PS Data Off status \"active\" can be
equivalent to the set of predefined PCC rules for UE with 3GPP PS Data Off
status \"inactive\" with the following two differences: All services belonging
to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services can be represented by PCC
rule(s) which allows the traffic to pass while in all other PCC rules (not
belonging to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services) the gate status
can be \"closed\" for downlink and optionally uplink direction. When the SMF
is informed about the change of UE 3GPP PS Data Off status, it can replace the
currently active set of predefined PCC rules with the other set of predefined
PCC rules.
When the UE 3GPP PS Data Off status is \"active\" and a handover from one
access-system to another occurs, the PCF or the SMF when PCF is not deployed
performs the above operations so that the downlink and optionally uplink
traffic for services not belonging to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt
Services is only prevented via the 3GPP access.
#### 6.1.3.17 Policy decisions based on spending limits
Policy decisions based on spending limits is a function that allows PCF taking
actions related to the status of policy counters that are maintained in the
CHF.
The PCF uses the CHF selection mechanism defined in TS 23.501 [2] to select
the CHF that provides policy counters for spending limits for a PDU Session.
The PCF shall also provide the selected CHF address(es) to the SMF in the PDU
Session related policy information.
The identifiers of the policy counters that are relevant for a policy decision
in the PCF may be stored in the PCF or possibly in UDR. The PCF is configured
with the actions associated with the policy counter status that is received
from CHF.
The PCF may retrieve the status of policy counters in the CHF using the
Initial or Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval Procedure. The CHF
provides the current status of the policy counters to the PCF. The CHF may in
addition provide one or more pending statuses for a policy counter together
with the time they have to be applied. The PCF shall immediately apply the
current status of a policy counter. A pending status of a policy counter shall
autonomously become the current status of a policy counter at the PCF when the
indicated corresponding time is reached. Subsequently provided information for
pending statuses of a policy counter shall overwrite the previously received
information.
The PCF may subscribe to spending limit reporting for policy counters from the
CHF using the Initial or Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval
procedure. If spending limit reporting for a policy counter is enabled, the
CHF shall notify the PCF of changes in the status of this policy counter (e.g.
daily spending limit of \$2 reached) and optionally pending statuses of this
policy counter together with their activation time (e.g. due to a billing
period that will expire at midnight). The PCF may cancel spending limit
reporting for specific policy counter(s) using the Intermediate Spending Limit
Report Retrieval procedure, or for all policy counter(s) using the Final
Spending Limit Report Retrieval procedure.
The PCF uses the status of each relevant policy counter, and optional pending
policy counter statuses if known, as input to its policy decision to apply
operator defined actions, e.g. change the QoS (e.g. downgrade Session-AMBR),
modify the PCC Rules to apply gating or change charging conditions.
The CHF may report to the PCF the removal of the subscriber from the CHF
system, and the PCF shall remove all the policy counters of the subscriber
accordingly.

If an AF requests the PCF to report the PLMN identifier where the UE is
currently located, then the PCF shall provide the PLMN identifier to the AF if
available. Otherwise, the PCF shall provision the corresponding PCC rules, and
the Policy Control Request Trigger to report PLMN change to the SMF. The PCF
shall, upon receiving the PLMN identifier from the SMF forward this
information to the AF.
If an AF requests the PCF to report on the change of Access Type, the PCF
shall provide the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger to the SMF to
enable the report of the Change in Access Type to the PCF. The PCF shall, upon
reception of information about the Access Type the user is currently using and
upon indication of change of Access Type, notify the AF on changes of the
Access Type and forward the information received from the SMF to the AF. The
change of the RAT Type shall also be reported to the AF, even if the Access
Type is unchanged. For MA PDU Session the Access Type information may include
two Access Type information that the user is currently using.
If an AF requests the PCF to report on the signalling path status, for the AF
session, the PCF shall, upon indication of removal of PCC Rules identifying
signalling traffic from the SMF report it to the AF.
If an AF requests the PCF to report Access Network Charging Correlation
Information, the PCF shall provide to the AF the Access Network Charging
Correlation Information, which allows to identify the usage reports that
include measurements for the Service Data Flow(s), once the Access Network
Charging Correlation Information is known at the PCF.
If an AF requests the PCF to report Access Network Information (i.e. the User
Location Report and/or the UE Timezone Report) at AF session establishment,
modification or termination, the PCF shall set the Access Network Information
report parameters in the corresponding PCC rule(s) and provision them together
with the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger to the SMF. For those
PCC rule(s) based on preliminary service information the PCF may assign the
5QI and ARP of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule to avoid
signalling to the UE.
NOTE: The PCF can also use the dynamic or pre-defined PCC Rules related to the
IMS signalling to request Access Network Information reporting. This can be
used to support e.g., regulatory requirements for SMS over IP, where the IMS
network (i.e., P‑CSCF) needs to retrieve the user location and/or UE Time Zone
information. Note that due to regulatory requirements, the Access Network
Information can be requested for SMS over IP, impacting a large number of PDU
Sessions, that can lead to significant increase in signalling load when the
Access Network Information is requested from AMF.
The PCF shall, upon receiving an Access Network Information report
corresponding to the AF session from the SMF, forward the Access Network
Information as requested by the AF (if the SMF only reported the serving PLMN
identifier to the PCF, as described in clause 6.1.3.5, the PCF shall forward
it to the AF). For AF session termination the communication between the AF and
the PCF shall be kept alive until the PCF report is received.
If an AF requests the PCF to report the Usage for Sponsored Data Connectivity,
the PCF shall provision the corresponding PCC rules, and the Policy Control
Request Trigger to the SMF. If the usage threshold provided by the AF has been
reached or the AF session is terminated, the PCF forwards such information to
the AF.
If an AF requests the PCF to report the Service Data Flow deactivation, the
PCF shall report the release of resources corresponding to the AF session. The
PCF shall, upon being notified of the removal of PCC Rules corresponding to
the AF session from the SMF, forward this information to the AF. The PCF shall
also forward, if available, the reason why the resources are released, the
user location information and the UE Timezone.
If an AF requests the PCF to report the Resource allocation outcome, the PCF
shall report the outcome of the resource allocation of the Service Data
Flow(s) related to the AF session. The AF may request to be notified about
successful or failed resource allocation. In this case, the PCF shall instruct
the SMF to report the successful resource allocation trigger (see clause
6.1.3.5). If the SMF has notified the PCF that the resource allocation of a
Service Data Flow is successful and the currently fulfilled QoS matches an
Alternative QoS parameter set (as described in clause 6.2.2.1), the PCF shall
also provide to the AF the QoS reference parameter corresponding to the
Alternative QoS parameter set referenced by the SMF.
If an AF requests the PCF to report when the QoS targets can no longer (or can
again) be fulfilled for a particular media flow, the PCF shall set the QNC
indication in the corresponding PCC rule(s) that includes a GBR or delay
critical GBR 5QI value and provision them together with the corresponding
Policy Control Request Trigger to the SMF. At the time, the SMF notifies that
GFBR can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed for a QoS Flow to which those
PCC Rule(s) are bound, the PCF shall report to the AF the affected media flow
and provides the indication that QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be
fulfilled. If additional information is received with the notification from
SMF (see clause 5.7.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2]), the PCF shall also provide to the
AF the QoS reference parameter corresponding to the Alternative QoS parameter
set referenced by the SMF. If the SMF has indicated that the lowest priority
Alternative QoS parameter set cannot be fulfilled, the PCF shall indicate to
the AF that the lowest priority QoS reference of the Alternative Service
Requirements cannot be fulfilled.
If the AF has subscribed to be notified of the QoS Monitoring information, the
PCF further sends the QoS Monitoring report to the AF.
If an AF requests the PCF to report on the Out of credit event for the
associated service data flow(s), the PCF shall inform the AF (when it gets
informed by the SMF) that credit is no longer available for the services data
flow(s) related to the AF session together with the applied termination
action.
If an AF requests the PCF to report on the Reallocation of credit event for
the associated service data flow(s), the PCF shall inform the AF (when it gets
informed by the SMF) that credit has been reallocated after credit was no
longer available and the termination action was applied for the service data
flow(s) related to the AF session.
If an AF requests the PCF to report on the event of the 5GS Bridge information
Notification, the PCF shall, upon reception of the 5GS Bridge information
(refer to clause 6.1.3.23) from the SMF, forward this information to the TSN
AF. When the PCF has received the Bridge Management Information Container or
Port Management Information Container and related port number from SMF, the
PCF also provides Bridge Management Information Container or Port Management
Information Container and related port number to the TSN AF. The PCF can arm
the trigger of 5GS Bridge information available to SMF based on local policy
without an AF request. When SMF has reported the 5GS Bridge information and no
TSN AF session exists, the PCF forward this information to a pre-configured
TSN AF.
#### 6.1.3.19 Mission Critical Services support
Mission Critical Services are defined in TS 23.501 [2], TS 23.502 [3] and in
TS 23.280 [23], utilising the architecture defined for 5GS.
Subscription data for MCX services are provided to PCF through the N36/Nudr.
To support MCX services, the PCF shall subscribe to changes in the MCX
services subscription data for Priority PDU connectivity service. Dynamic
invocation for MCX services provided from an AF using the Priority indicator
over N5/Npcf takes precedence over the MCX services subscription.
For MCX services the session management relate policy control functionality of
the Policy and Charging control framework for the 5G system is as defined in
clause 6.1.3.11 for Multimedia Priority Service.
#### 6.1.3.20 Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting
As specified in TS 23.501 [2], the Access Traffic Steering, Switching and
Splitting (ATSSS) feature is an optional feature that may be supported by the
UE and the 5GC network. The ATSSS feature enables a multi-access PDU
Connectivity Service, which can exchange PDUs between the UE and a data
network by simultaneously using one 3GPP access network and one non-3GPP
access network.
The PCF is informed of the ATSSS capabilities of a MA PDU Session by the SMF,
as defined in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The ATSSS capabilities are both
the Steering Mode and the Steering Functionality.
The PCF control of Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting for a
detected service data flow (SDF) is enabled by including Multi-Access PDU (MA
PDU) Session Control information in the PCC rule. This allows the PCF to
control:
\- The Steering Mode that is used to steer/switch/split the detected SDF. The
available Steering Modes are defined in TS 23.501 [2].
\- The Steering Functionality that is used for the detected SDF, e.g. the
MPTCP functionality or the ATSSS-LL functionality defined in TS 23.501 [2].
\- Charging information depending on what Access Type is used for a detected
SDF.
\- Usage Monitoring information depending on what Access Type is used for a
detected SDF.
The rest of the information in the PCC Rule apply to the SDF as such and are
not dependent on what Access Type is used for a packet.
The MA PDU Session Control information in the PCC rules is used by the SMF in
order to create applicable N4 rules for the UPF and ATSSS rules for the UE, as
described in TS 23.501 [2]. The ATSSS rules are sent to UE via NAS when the MA
PDU Session is created or updated by the SMF/PCF, as described in TS 23.501
[2] and TS 23.502 [3].
When MA PDU Session Control Information is provided to the SMF within a PCC
Rule, the (H-)PCF provides both the Service Data Flow templates to identify a
Service Data Flow in the UPF and if the Service Data Flow template includes an
application identifier, then the corresponding Application descriptors to
identify the application traffic in the UE is also included.
The (H-) PCF may use the OSid stored in the UDR as DataSet \"Policy Data\" and
Data Subset \"UE context policy control data\" to determine the OSAppId
supported by the OSid. The (H-)PCF may also provide multiple Application
descriptors to identify application traffic in the UE, this is determined by
the (H-)PCF local policies that indicates e.g. the operating system supported
by the UE. If no OSid is available in the UDR, the (H-)PCF may use the PEI to
determine the OSid supported by the UE.
NOTE 1: If the (H-)PCF does not take into account the received PEI and/or OSId
then the (H-)PCF can send PCC rules containing application traffic descriptors
associated to multiple operating systems.
The Traffic Descriptor in the ATSSS rule is generated by the SMF from the SDF
template of the PCC rule. If the SDF template contains SDF filters, the SMF
uses the UL SDF filters for the generation of the IP descriptors or Non-IP
descriptors, respectively. If the SDF template contains an application
identifier, the SMF includes the Application descriptors received from the PCF
as part of the MA PDU Session information in the PCC Rule within the Traffic
Descriptors in the ATSSS rule.
The PCF may also provide URSP rules to the UE for instructing the UE to
establish a MA PDU Session, as described in clause 6.6.2.
The PCF control of PDU Session level Usage Monitoring depending on what access
type is used to carry the traffic is enabled by providing Usage Monitoring
control related information per access in the PDU Session related policy
control information (as described in clause 6.4).
If the MA PDU Session is capable of MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any Steering Mode
in the downlink and MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink, then
the PCF shall provide a PCC Rule for non-MPTCP traffic. This PCC Rule contains
a \"match all\" SDF template, the lowest precedence, the Steering
Functionality set to \"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering Mode set to \"Active-
Standby\" for the uplink direction, and the Steering Functionality set to
\"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering Mode set to any supported steering mode for the
downlink direction.
If the MA PDU Session is capable of MPTCP with any Steering Mode in the
downlink, ATSSS-LL with any steering mode except Smallest Delay steering mode
in the downlink, and MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink,
then the PCF shall provide a PCC Rule for non-MPTCP traffic. This PCC Rule
contains a \"match all\" SDF template, the lowest precedence, the Steering
Functionality set to \"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering Mode set to \"Active-
Standby\" for the uplink direction, and the Steering Functionality set to
\"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering Mode set to any supported steering mode except
Smallest Delay steering mode for the downlink direction.
If the MA PDU Session is capable of MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in
the uplink and downlink, then the PCF shall provide a PCC Rule for non-MPTCP
traffic. This PCC Rule contains a \"match all\" SDF template, the lowest
precedence, the Steering Functionality set to \"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering
Mode set to \"Active-Standby\" for the uplink direction and the downlink
direction.
If the MA PDU Session is capable of MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any Steering Mode
in the uplink and downlink, then the PCF shall provide a PCC Rule for non-
MPTCP traffic. This PCC Rule may contain a \"match all\" SDF template, the
lowest precedence, the Steering Functionality set to \"ATSSS-LL\" and the
Steering Mode set to any supported steering mode for the uplink direction and
for the downlink direction.
These PCC Rules are used by the SMF to generate an ATSSS rule for the UE and
an N4 rule for the UPF to route the non-MPTCP traffic of the MA PDU Session in
the uplink and downlink direction respectively.
NOTE 2: The PCF can also use the ATSSS capability of the MA PDU Session to
provide PCC Rules containing SDF template for some specific non-MPTCP traffic
other than the PCC Rule containing a \"match all\" SDF template. This allows
the operator to apply different policies e.g. charging key to non-MPTCP
traffic other than the non-MPCTP traffic matching the \"match all\" PCC Rule.
#### 6.1.3.21 QoS Monitoring to assist URLLC Service
The QoS Monitoring for URLLC refers to the real time packet delay measurement
between the UE and the UPF for a QoS Flow corresponding to an URLLC service.
The PCF generates the authorized QoS Monitoring policy for the service data
flow based on the QoS Monitoring request if received from the AF. The QoS
Monitoring policy includes the following:
\- QoS parameters to be measured (DL, UL or round trip packet delay);
\- frequency of reporting (event triggered, periodic):
\- if the reporting frequency is event triggered:
\- the corresponding reporting threshold to each QoS parameter;
\- minimum waiting time between subsequent reports;
\- the reporting period;
\- information about the target of the QoS Monitoring reports (e.g. either to
the PCF or the AF indicated as Notification Target Address + Notification
Correlation ID as specified in clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3]).
The PCF includes the authorized QoS Monitoring policy in the PCC rule and
provides it to the SMF.
#### 6.1.3.22 AF session with required QoS
The AF may request that a data session to a UE is set up with a specific QoS
(e.g. low latency or jitter) and priority handling. The AF can request the
network to provide QoS for the AF session based on the service requirements
with the help of a QoS reference parameter which refers to pre-defined QoS
information. When the PCF authorizes the service information from the AF and
generates a PCC rule, it derives the QoS parameters of the PCC rule based on
the service information and the indicated QoS reference parameter.
NOTE 1: A SLA has to be in place between the operator and the ASP defining the
possible QoS levels and their charging rates. For each of the possible pre-
defined QoS information sets, the PCF needs to be configured with the
corresponding QoS parameters and their values as well as the appropriate
Charging key (or receive this information from the UDR).
The AF may change the QoS by providing a different QoS reference parameter
while the AF session is ongoing. If this happens, the PCF shall update the
related QoS parameter sets in the PCC rule accordingly.
If the PCF gets informed about Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for
the AF session, the PCF shall inform the AF about it as defined in clause
6.1.3.18.
If an AF session can adjust to different QoS parameter combinations, the AF
may provide Alternative Service Requirements containing one or more QoS
reference parameters in a prioritized order (which indicates the preference of
the QoS requirements with which the service can operate). If so, the AF shall
also subscribe to receive notifications from the PCF for successful resource
allocation and when the QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled
as described in clause 6.1.3.18.
When the PCF authorizes the service information from the AF and generates a
PCC rule, it shall also derive Alternative QoS parameter sets for this PCC
rule based on the QoS reference parameters in the Alternative Service
Requirements.
The PCF shall enable QoS Notification Control and include the derived
Alternative QoS parameter sets (in the same prioritized order indicated by the
AF) in the PCC rule sent to the SMF. When the PCF notifies the AF that QoS
targets can no longer be fulfilled, the PCF shall include the QoS reference
parameter corresponding to the Alternative QoS parameter set referenced by the
SMF or an indication that the lowest priority QoS reference of the Alternative
Service Requirements cannot be fulfilled (as described in clause 6.1.3.18).
NOTE 2: The AF behaviour is out of the scope of this TS but can include
adaptation to the change of QoS (e.g. rate adaptation) as well as application
layer signalling with the UE.
The AF may change the Alternative Service Requirements while the AF session is
ongoing. If this happens, the PCF shall update the Alternative QoS parameter
sets in the PCC rule accordingly.
The AF may indicate to the PCF that the UE does not need to be informed about
changes related to Alternative QoS Profiles. With this indication received
from the AF, the PCF decides whether to disable the notifications to the UE
when changes related to the Alternative QoS Profiles occur and sets the
Disable UE notifications at changes related to Alternative QoS Profiles
parameter in the PCC rule accordingly.
#### 6.1.3.23 Support of integration with Time Sensitive Networking
Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) support is defined in TS 23.501 [2], where the
5GS represents logical TSN bridge(s) based on the defined granularity model.
The TSN AF and PCF interact to perform QoS mapping as described in clause
5.28.4 of TS 23.501 [2].
The PCF provides the following parameters to the TSN AF:
\- 5GS Bridge information:
\- 5GS Bridge ID;
\- UE-DS-TT Residence time;
\- port number of the Ethernet port of DS-TT;
\- MAC address of the Ethernet port of DS-TT (i.e. DS-TT port MAC address).
\- Port Management Information Container and the related port number.
\- Bridge Management Information Container.
The TSN AF may use this information to construct IEEE 802.1 managed objects,
to interwork with IEEE 802.1 TSN networks, as described in TS 23.501 [2] and
TS 23.502 [3].
The TSN AF requests related to TSN configuration are sent on the AF session
associated with the DS-TT port MAC address. The TSN AF decides the TSN QoS
information (i.e. priority, delay, maximum TSC Burst Size and Maximum Flow
Bitrate) and TSC Assistance Container based on the received configuration
information of 5GS Bridge from the CNC as defined in clause 5.28.2 of TS
23.501 [2], the bridge delay information at the TSN AF and the UE-DS-TT
Residence time.
The PCF receives a request from the TSN AF that may include:
\- Flow Descriptions including Ethernet Packet Filters (e.g. Ethernet PCP,
VLAN ID, destination MAC address of the TSN stream);
\- TSN QoS Parameters for the service data flow:
\- TSC Assistance Container: describes the TSC stream traffic characteristics
(burst arrival time, periodicity, (both in reference to TSN GM), and Flow
direction needed for TSCAI determination (as described in clauses 5.27 and
5.28 of TS 23.501 [2]);
\- TSN QoS information, i.e. priority, maximum TSC Burst Size, delay and
Maximum Flow Bitrate.
\- Port Management Information Container and related Port number;
\- Bridge Management Information Container.
The PCF performs Session binding using the DS-TT port MAC address, and then
the PCF derives the 5QI based on the TSN QoS information and the PCF shall
consider the delay parameter provided by the TSN AF for deriving the 5QI. The
PCF generates a PCC Rule with service data flow filter (including Ethernet
Packet Filter set as in clause 5.7.6.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) derived from the Flow
Descriptions provided by the TSN AF, the mapped 5QI, ARP, GBR and MBR and the
associated TSC Assistance Container as received from the AF. The PCF derives
the 5QI value as defined in clause 5.27.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the PCF derives
the GBR using the Maximum Flow Bitrate provided by the TSN AF and the ARP is
assigned a value preconfigured for TSN services. The SMF binds the PCC Rule to
a QoS Flow as defined in clause 6.1.3.2.4.
NOTE: TSC burst size can represent the maximum burst size of the TSN streams
that have been aggregated.
#### 6.1.3.24 Policy control for redundant PDU Sessions
As specified in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2], in order to support highly
reliable URLLC services, two redundant PDU Sessions over the 5G network may be
established such that the 5GS sets up the user plane paths of the two
redundant PDU Sessions to be disjoint. The Policy control for redundant PDU
Session specifies that the PCF may request traffic redundancy for the PDU
Session (e.g. when some of the allowed services require redundancy).
The PCF provides to the SMF the indication on whether the PDU Session is a
redundant PDU Session or not based on operator policies. The SMF follows the
procedure defined in TS 23.501 [2] to establish redundant PDU Sessions
depending on the indication from the PCF.
## 6.2 Network functions and entities
### 6.2.1 Policy Control Function (PCF)
#### 6.2.1.1 General
##### 6.2.1.1.1 Session management related functionality
The PCF provides the following session management related functionality:
\- Policy and charging control for a service data flows;
\- PDU Session related policy control;
\- PDU Session event reporting to the AF.
The PCF provides authorized QoS for a service data flow and other network
control regarding service data flow detection, gating, QoS and charging
(except credit management) towards the SMF.
The PCF uses the service information received from the AF (e.g. SDP
information or other available application information) and/or the
subscription information received from the UDR to calculate the proper QoS
authorization (QoS class identifier, bitrates). The PCF may also take into
account the requested QoS received from the SMF and the analytics information
(e.g. analytics related to \"Service Experience\") received from the NWDAF.
NOTE 1: The PCF provides always the maximum values for the authorized QoS even
if the requested QoS is lower than what can be authorized.
The PCF may check that the service information provided by the AF is
consistent with both the operator defined policies and the related
subscription information as received from the UDR during PDU Session
establishment before storing the service information. The PCF may reject the
request received from the AF when the service information is not consistent
with either the related subscription information or the operator defined
policies and may indicate, in the response to the AF, the service information
that can be accepted by the PCF (e.g. the acceptable bandwidth). In the
absence of other policy control mechanisms outside the scope of PCC, it is
recommended that the PCF include this information in the response.
In this Release, the PCF supports only the interaction with a single AF for
each AF session.
The Authorization of QoS shall be based on complete service information unless
the PCF is required to perform the authorization of QoS based on preliminary
service information. The PCF shall after receiving the complete service
information, update the affected PCC rules accordingly.
At reception of the service information from the AF if configured through
policy and taking into account information defined in TS 26.114 [31], the PCF
determines the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL based on the service
information and sends it to SMF along with the PCC rule.
NOTE 2: Based on local configuration, the PCF sets the Maximum Packet Loss
Rate (UL, DL) corresponding to either the most robust codec configuration
(e.g. codec, mode, redundancy) or the least robust codec configuration of the
negotiated set in each direction.
NOTE 3: Details for setting the Maximum Packet Loss Rate are specified by SA4.
The PCF supports usage monitoring control as described in clause 6.2.1.7.
The PCF supports sponsored data connectivity for a service as described in
clause 6.2.1.8.
The PCF uses the information relating to subscriber spending available in the
CHF as input for policy decisions related to e.g. QoS control, gating or
charging conditions. Details for policy decisions based on spending limits are
described in clause 6.1.3.17.
The PCF uses one or more pieces of information defined in the clause 6.2.1.2
as input for the selection of traffic steering policies used to control the
steering of the subscriber\'s traffic as described in clause 6.1.3.14.
The PCF reports PDU Session events, e.g. Access Type, RAT Type (if
applicable), Access Network Information, PLMN identifier where the UE is
located, as described in clause 6.1.3.18.
The subscription and reporting of events when the target for reporting is an
Internal Group Identifier or any UE accessing a combination of (DNN, S-NSSAI),
is described in clause 5.2.5.7 of TS 23.502 [3]. The events that can be
reported by the PCF are described in clause 6.1.3.18.
The subscription and reporting of events targeting an individual UE IP address
(IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix) and optionally the DN information are described
below. The events that can be reported by the PCF are described in clause
6.1.3.18.
The PCF shall ensure that the sum of the packet filters used by all PCC rules
which trigger the generation of signalled QoS rules does not exceed the number
of supported packet filters for signalled QoS rules indicated by the UE for
the PDU Session, if this information is provided by the SMF (as defined in
clause 6.2.1.2).
For EPC IWK, when PCF receives from the SMF of the report on UE resumed from
suspend state, the PCF may provision PCC Rules to the SMF to trigger an IP-CAN
Session modification procedure.
The PCF may provide the IP index as the PDU Session related policy to the SMF
for IP address/Prefix allocation at SM Policy Association Establishment. If
PCF receives from the SMF an allocated IP address/Prefix for the PDU Session,
it shall not include IP Index into the PDU Session related policy.
On receiving the DN Authorization Profile Index provided by the SMF at the
establishment or modification of the SM Policy Association for a PDU Session,
the PCF takes the DN Authorization Profile Index as input for a policy
decision and then obtains the list of PCC Rules (as defined in clause 6.3)
and/or PDU Session related policy (as defined in clause 6.4) and provides them
to the SMF as part of the Session Management Policy Control Data for
enforcement.
On receiving the Session-AMBR provided by the SMF at the establishment or
modification of the SM Policy Association for a PDU Session under the
conditions defined in clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2], the PCF provides the
Authorized Session-AMBR as part of the PDU Session policy control information
defined in clause 6.4.
The PCF provides DNAI(s) in the PCC rule(s) to the SMF, taking into account
the AF request and the Local routing indication from the PDU Session policy
control subscription information.
When the PCF detects that all PCC rules related to an AF session are removed,
or the PCF detects that the SM Policy Association is terminated, the PCF shall
request the AF to terminate the AF session. If the SMF indicated that the PCC
rules were removed or that the SM Policy Association is terminated due to PS
to CS handover, the PCF shall indicate PS to CS handover as cause within the
request to terminate the AF session.
NOTE 4: For 5G-SRVCC (i.e. SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN) as specified in TS
23.216 [25]), the SM Policy Association is terminated by the SMF. For SRVCC
(i.e. SRVCC from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN) as specified in TS 23.216 [25], the
SMF indicates that PCC rules are removed.
##### 6.2.1.1.2 Non-session management related functionality
The PCF provides the following non-session management related functionality:
\- Access and mobility related policy control (as described in clause
6.1.2.1);
\- UE policy information control (as described in clause 6.1.2.2);
\- Negotiation for future BDT (as described in clause 6.1.2.4).
#### 6.2.1.2 Input for PCC decisions

#### 6.2.1.3 Policy control subscription information management
The PCF may request subscription information at PDU Session establishment and
during the UE Policy Association Establishment procedure.
The PCF may receive notifications on changes in the subscription information.
Upon reception of a notification, the PCF shall make the policy control
decisions necessary to accommodate the change in the subscription and shall
update the SMF and/or the AMF if needed.
NOTE 1: How the PCF provisions/retrieves information related with policy
control subscription data is defined in TS 23.501 [2].
The policy control subscription profile information provided by the UDR during
the UE Policy Association Establishment procedure using Nudr service for Data

#### 6.2.1.4 V-PCF
The V-PCF is a functional element that encompasses policy control decision
functionalities in the VPLMN.
For session management related policy control, the V-PCF only includes
functionality for local breakout roaming scenario based on roaming agreements.
For UE policy control, the V-PCF receives the UE policy from the H-PCF and
forwards it to the UE via the AMF. The V-PCF can send additional UE policy
information (i.e. ANDSP policies) to the UE which is different from the one
from H-PCF.
For Access and mobility related policy control, the V-PCF generates the values
for RFSP Index, UE-AMBR, Service Area Restriction and SMF selection
management.
#### 6.2.1.5 H-PCF
The H-PCF is a functional element that encompasses policy control decision
functionalities in the HPLMN.
For session management related policy control, the H-PCF only includes
functionality for home routed roaming scenario and provides the same
functionality as the PCF in the non-roaming case.
For UE policy control, H-PCF generates the UE policy based on subscription
data and transfers the UE policy to the UE via the AMF, or via the V-PCF in
the roaming case.
#### 6.2.1.6 Application specific policy information management
The application specific information used for policy control includes:
\- Negotiation of BDT information stored in the UDR as Data Set \"Policy
Data\" and Data Subset \"Background Data Transfer data\": It contains an ASP
identifier, Non-IP information or IP 3-tuple to identify the Application
server, a transfer policy together with the Background Data Transfer Reference
ID, the volume of data to be transferred per UE, the expected amount of UEs
and optionally, the subscription to notifications when the BDT policy needs to
renegotiated;
\- Sponsored data connectivity profile information stored in the UDR as Data
Set \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"Sponsored data connectivity profile
data\": It contains a list of ASP identifiers and their applications per
sponsor identity;
\- Application Function request information for multiple UEs (per group of UEs
or all UEs) stored in the UDR as Data Set \"Application Data\" and Data Subset
\"AF request information for multiple UEs\".
The application specific policy information may be requested/updated by the
PCF per AF request.
The management of Application Function request information for multiple UEs is
defined in clause 6.3.7.2 of TS 23.501 [2], the management of policies for the
negotiation of BDT is defined in clause 6.1.2.4 of this specification and the
provision and usage of sponsored data connectivity profile is defined in
clause 6.2.1.1 of this specification.
#### 6.2.1.7 Usage monitoring
The PCF supports usage monitoring control for a PDU Session or per Monitoring
Key. Usage is defined as either volume or time of user plane traffic.
The PCF may receive usage monitoring related information per DNN and S-NSSAI
combination and UE from the UDR, i.e. the overall amount of allowed resources
(based either on traffic volume and/or traffic time) that are to be monitored
for the PDU Sessions of a user, together with the corresponding remaining
allowed usage related information. In addition, usage monitoring related
information for Monitoring key(s) per DNN and S-NSSAI combination and UE may
also be received from the UDR, together with the corresponding remaining
allowed usage related information. For the purpose of usage monitoring per
access type, the PCF receives an individual Monitoring key per access type
from UDR. Details about the usage monitoring related information and the
remaining allowed usage related information provided by the UDR are described
in clause 6.2.1.3.
For the purpose of usage monitoring control the PCF shall request the Usage
report trigger and provide the necessary usage threshold(s), either volume
threshold, time threshold, or both volume threshold and time threshold, upon
which the SMF shall report to the PCF. The PCF shall decide if and when to
activate usage monitoring to the SMF.
The PCF may provide a Monitoring time to the SMF for the Monitoring keys(s)
and optionally specify a subsequent threshold value for the usage after the
Monitoring time.
If the SMF reports usage before the Monitoring time is reached, the Monitoring
time is not retained by the SMF. Therefore, the PCF may again provide a
Monitoring time and optionally the subsequent threshold value for the usage
after the Monitoring time in the response.
It shall be possible for the PCF to request a usage report from the SMF.
NOTE 1: The PCF ensures that the number of requests/following policy decisions
provided to the SMF do not cause excessive signalling load by e.g. assigning
the same time for the report only for a preconfigured number of PDU Sessions.
Once the PCF receives a usage report from the SMF the PCF shall deduct the
value of the usage report from the remaining allowed usage for that DNN and
S-NSSAI combination and UE (if usage per PDU Session is reported). If usage is
reported from the SMF, the PCF shall deduct the value of the usage report from
the remaining allowed usage for individual Monitoring key(s) for that DNN and
S-NSSAI combination and UE (if usage for one or several Monitoring keys is
reported).
NOTE 2: The PCF maintains usage thresholds for each Monitoring key and PDU
Session that is active for a certain DNN and S-NSSAI combination and UE.
Updating the remaining allowed usage after the SMF reporting, minimizes the
risk of exceeding the usage allowance.
If the remaining allowed usage reaches a value of zero (or below zero), the
PCF may apply other policy decisions and interact with the SMF accordingly.
If the SMF reports usage for a certain Monitoring key and if monitoring shall
continue for that Monitoring key then the PCF shall provide new threshold
value(s) in the response to the SMF respectively. If Monitoring time and
subsequent threshold value are used then the PCF provides them to the SMF as
well.
The PCF may provide a new volume threshold and/or a new time threshold to the
SMF, the new threshold values overrides the existing threshold values in the
SMF.
If monitoring shall no longer continue for that Monitoring key, then the PCF
shall not provide a new threshold in the response to the SMF.
If the last PDU Session of a user for a DNN and S-NSSAI combination is
terminated, the PCF shall store the remaining allowed usage, i.e. the
information about the remaining overall amount of resources, in the UDR.
If the End date of the usage monitoring related information (see clause
6.2.1.3 for details) is reached, the PCF shall reset the remaining allowed
usage to the value(s) indicated in the usage monitoring related information
and shall then interact with the SMF to undo any previously applied policy
decisions related to remaining allowed usage of zero (or below zero).
#### 6.2.1.8 Sponsored data connectivity
The PCF may authorise an application service provider to request specific PCC
decisions (e.g. authorisation to request sponsored IP flows, authorisation to
request QoS resources) based on sponsored data connectivity profile from the
UDR. For sponsored data connectivity, the PCF may receive a usage threshold
from the AF. If the AF specifies a usage threshold, the PCF shall use the
Sponsor Identity to construct a Monitoring key for monitoring the volume,
time, or both volume and time of user plane traffic, and invoke usage
monitoring on the SMF. The PCF shall notify the AF when the SMF reports that a
usage threshold for the Monitoring key is reached provided that the AF
requests to be notified for this event, as described in clause 6.1.3.18. If
the usage threshold is reached, the AF may terminate the AF session or provide
a new usage threshold to the PCF. Alternatively, the AF may allow the session
to continue without specifying a usage threshold. If the AF decides to allow
the session to continue without specifying a usage threshold, then monitoring
in the SMF shall be discontinued for that monitoring key by the PCF, unless
there are other reasons for continuing the monitoring.
If the H-PCF detects that the UE is in a home-routed roaming scenario when
sponsored data connectivity is requested by an AF, it may allow the sponsored
data connectivity in the service authorization request, reject the service
authorization request, or initiate the AF session termination based on home
operator policy.
NOTE: Sponsored data connectivity is not supported in the roaming with local
breakout scenario in this Release.
If the AF revokes the service information and the AF has notified previously a
usage threshold to the PCF, the PCF shall report the usage up to the time of
the revocation of service authorization.
If the PDU Session terminates and the AF has specified a usage threshold then
the PCF shall notify the AF of the accumulated usage (i.e. either volume, or
time, or both volume and time) of user plane traffic since the last usage
report.
### 6.2.2 Session Management Function (SMF)
#### 6.2.2.1 General
The SMF is responsible for the enforcement of the policy decisions related to
service data flow detection, authorized QoS, charging, gating, traffic usage
reporting, packet routing and forwarding and traffic steering. The SMF
controls the policy and charging enforcement which includes the binding of
service data flows to QoS Flows (as described in clause 6.1.3.2.4) as well as
the interaction with the CHF. The SMF interacts with the UPF(s), the RAN and
the UE to achieve the appropriate treatment of the user plane traffic.
The SMF control of the UPF(s) is described in TS 23.501 [2] as well as the
interaction principles between SMF and RAN and between SMF and UE. The
procedures for the interaction between SMF and UPF, SMF and RAN as well as SMF
and UE are described in TS 23.502 [3].
The SMF is enforcing the Policy Control as indicated by the PCF in two
different ways:
\- Gate enforcement. The SMF shall instruct the UPF to allow a service data
flow, which is subject to policy control, to pass through the UPF if and only
if the corresponding gate is open;
\- QoS enforcement:
\- 5QI corresponding with 5G QoS Characteristics. The SMF shall be able to
convert a 5QI value to 5G QoS Characteristics values.
\- PCC rule QoS enforcement. The SMF shall instruct the UPF to enforce the
authorized QoS of a service data flow according to the active PCC rule (e.g.
to enforce DSCP marking).
\- QoS Flow QoS enforcement. The SMF controls the QoS that is provided to a
combined set of service data flows. The policy enforcement function ensures
that the resources which can be used by an authorized set of service data
flows are within the \"authorized resources\" specified by the PCF. The
authorized QoS provides an upper bound on the resources that can be reserved
(GFBR) or allocated (MFBR) for the QoS Flow. During QoS Flow QoS enforcement,
if packet filters are provided to the UE, the SMF shall provide packet filters
with the same content as that in the SDF template filters received from the
PCF.
The SMF is enforcing the charging control in the following way:
\- For a service data flow (defined by an active PCC rule) that is subject to
charging control, the SMF shall allow the service data flow to pass through
the UPF if and only if there is a corresponding active PCC rule with and, for
online charging, the CHF has authorized credit for the charging key. The SMF
may let a service data flow pass through the UPF during the course of the
credit re-authorization procedure.
For a service data flow (defined by an active PCC rule) that is subject to
both Policy Control and Charging Control, the SMF shall allow the service data
flow to pass through the UPF if and only if the right conditions from both
policy control and charging control happen. i.e. the corresponding gate is
open and in the case of online charging the CHF has authorized credit for its
charging key.
For a service data flow (defined by an active PCC rule) that is subject to
policy control only and not charging control, the SMF shall allow the service
data flow to pass through the UPF if and only if the conditions for policy
control are met.
A SMF may be served by one or more PCF nodes. The SMF shall contact the
appropriate PCF as described in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
The operator may configure an indicator in UDM which is delivered to the SMF
within the Charging Characteristics and used by the SMF to not establish the
SM Policy Association during the PDU Session establishment procedure.
NOTE 1: The decision to not establish the SM Policy Association applies for
the life time of the PDU Session.
NOTE 2: The indicator in the UDM is operator specific, therefore its value is
understood within the HPLMN and can be used in both non-roaming or home routed
roaming cases.
The SMF shall, on request from the PCF, modify a PCC rule, using the
equivalent SMF behaviour as the removal of the old and the activation of the
new (modified) PCC rule. The SMF shall modify a PCC rule as an atomic
operation. The SMF shall not modify a predefined PCC rule on request from the
PCF.
The SMF should support predefined PCC rules.
The SMF shall gather and report QoS Flow usage information according to clause
6.1.3.3. The SMF may have a pre-configured Default charging method. Upon the
initial interaction with the PCF, the SMF shall provide pre-configured Default
charging method if available.
At PDU Session establishment the SMF shall initiate the SM Policy Association
Establishment procedure. If no PCC rule was activated for the PDU Session, the
SMF shall reject the PDU Session establishment.
If there is no PCC rule active for a successfully established PDU Session at
any later point in time, e.g. through a PCF initiated SM Policy Association
Modification, the SMF shall initiate a PDU Session termination procedure. If
the PCF terminates the SM Policy Association, the SMF shall initiate a PDU
Session termination procedure.
If there is no PCC rule active for a successfully established QoS Flow at any
later point in time, e.g. through a PCF triggered SM Policy Association
Modification, the SMF shall initiate a PDU Session Modification procedure an
terminate the QoS Flow.
If the PDU Session is modified, e.g. by changing the characteristics for an
QoS Flow, the SMF shall first use the Policy Control Request Trigger to
determine whether to request the PCC rules for the modified PDU Session from
the PCF; afterwards, the SMF shall use the re-authorisation triggers, if
available, in order to determine whether to require re-authorisation for the
PCC rules that were either unaffected or modified. If the SMF receives an
unsolicited update of the PCC rules from the PCF, the PCC rules shall be
activated, modified or removed as indicated by the PCF.
The SMF shall inform the PCF about the outcome of a PCC rule operation. If a
QoS Flow cannot be established or modified to satisfy the QoS Flow binding,
then the SMF shall reject the activation of a PCC rule. If the SMF is
requested to notify the PCF about a successful resource allocation (see clause
6.1.3.5) and the currently fulfilled QoS of an established or modified QoS
Flow matches an Alternative QoS Profile (as described in clause 5.7.2.4.3 of
TS 23.501 [2]), the SMF shall also provide to the PCF the reference to the
Alternative QoS parameter set corresponding to the Alternative QoS Profile
referenced by the RAN.
The SMF shall inform the PCF about any removal of a PCC rule, that the PCF has
activated, that occurs without explicit instruction from the PCF.
When QoS Flow resources are released, i.e. at SM Policy Association
termination or SMF-initiated SM Policy Association modification notifying that
PCC Rules are removed, the SMF shall also provide, if available, the reason
why resources are released, i.e. RAN/NAS Release Cause.
NOTE 3: In the case of a rejection of a PCC rule activation the PCF may e.g.
modify the attempted PCC rule, de-activate or modify other PCC rules and retry
activation or abort the activation attempt and, if applicable, inform the AF
that transmission resources are not available.
The SMF forwards the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL, if received from
PCF for the PCC rule bound to a 5QI=1 QoS Flow. In the case multiple PCC Rules
share one 5QI=1 QoS Flow and the SMF received multiple Maximum Packet Loss
Rates, the SMF chooses the lowest value per direction related to these PCC
rules.
When the PCF provides updated PCC rules for the PDU Session to the SMF, and
the PCC rules were not enforced due to that the UE is in suspend state, e.g.
due to SRVCC to GERAN without DTM support as specified in clause 6.2.2.1 in
the TS 23.216 [25] or CSFB to UTRAN without PS Handover as specified in clause
6.5 in the TS 23.272 [26], the SMF shall indicate to the PCF that the PCC
Rules were not enforced with the reason that the UE is in suspend state. Upon
reception of the failure indication, the PCF may subscribe to UE resumed from
suspend state event trigger.
NOTE 4: This above description applies in the case of EPC interworking.
#### 6.2.2.2 Service data flow detection
The Service Data Flow detection uses the service data flow template included
in a PCC Rule provide by the PCF. The service data flow template defines the
data for the service data flow detection as a set of service data flow filters
or an application identifier referring to an application detection filter. The
SMF maps the service data flow template in the PCC Rule into the detection
information in a Packet Detection Rules to the UPF as described in TS 23.501
[2].
The application detection filters provided to the SMF may be extended with the
PFDs provided by the NEF (PFDF). How the SMF uses the service data flow
detection capabilities in the UPF is described in clause 5.8.2 of TS 23.501
[2].
For IP PDU Session type and Ethernet PDU Session type, the service data flow
filters that may apply for traffic on a PDU Session are defined in clause
5.7.6 of TS 23.501 [2]. The following specifics apply:
\- Each service data flow template may contain any number of service data flow
filters;
\- Each service data flow filter is applicable uplink, downlink or both uplink
and downlink;
NOTE 1: Service data flow filters that apply in both uplink and downlink
should be used whenever possible.
\- Each service data flow filter may contain information about whether the
explicit signalling of the corresponding traffic mapping information to the UE
is required.
NOTE 2: This information enables e.g. the generation/removal of traffic
mapping information for the UE as well as the usage of PCC rules with specific
service data flow filters on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule
without the need to generate traffic mapping information.
#### 6.2.2.3 Measurement
The SMF shall ensure that the UPF supports data volume, duration, combined
volume/duration and event based measurement for charging. The Measurement
method indicates what measurement type is applicable to the PCC rule.
NOTE 1: Event based charging is only applicable to predefined PCC rules and
PCC rules using an application detection filter (i.e. with an application
identifier).
The SMF shall ensure that the UPF measurement measures all the user plane
traffic, except traffic that PCC causes to be discarded.
The SMF shall ensure that the UPF maintains a measurement per QoS Flow, and
Charging Key combination.
If Service identifier level reporting is mandated in a PCC rule, the SMF shall
ensure that the UPF maintains a measurement for that Charging Key and Service
Identifier combination, for the QoS Flow.
NOTE 2: In addition, the SMF may instruct the UPF to maintain QoS Flow level
measurement if required by the operator.
For usage monitoring, the SMF shall ensure that the UPF supports volume and
time measurement for a PDU Session and maintains a measurement for each PDU
Session for which the PCF has requested the Usage report trigger and provided
threshold values on a PDU Session level. The SMF shall ensure that the UPF is
able to support volume and time measurements simultaneously for a given PDU
Session.
The SMF shall ensure that the UPF supports volume and time measurement per
Monitoring key and maintain a measurement for each Monitoring key if the PCF
has requested the Usage report trigger and provided threshold values on
Monitoring key level. The SMF shall ensure that the UPF is able to support
volume and time measurements simultaneously for a given Monitoring Key.
The SMF shall ensure that the UPF supports simultaneous volume and time
measurement for usage monitoring on PDU Session level and Monitoring key level
for the same PDU Session.
Volume and time measurements for usage monitoring purposes on PDU Session
level and on Monitoring key level shall be performed independently of each
other. If the PCC rule is associated with an indication of exclusion from
session level monitoring, the SMF shall ensure that the UPF does not consider
the corresponding service data flow for the volume and time measurement on PDU
Session level.
If the Usage report reached Policy Control Request Trigger is set and a volume
or a time threshold is reached, the SMF shall report this event to the PCF.
The SMF shall continue to perform volume or time measurement after the
threshold is reached and before a new threshold is provided by the PCF. At PDU
Session termination or if the conditions defined in clause 6.4 for continued
monitoring are no longer met, or if the PCF explicitly requests a usage
report, the SMF shall inform the PCF about the resources that have been
consumed by the user since the last usage report for the affected Monitoring
keys, including the resources consumed before and after the Monitoring time
was reached, if provided according to clause 6.2.1.1.
If combined volume and time measurements are requested by the PCF, then the
reporting shall be done for both together. For example, if the volume
threshold is reached, the consumed time shall be reported as well and, in
order to continue combined volume and time measurements, the PCF shall provide
a new time threshold along with a new volume threshold. The SMF shall continue
to instruct the UPF to perform volume and time measurement after the threshold
is reached and before a new threshold is provided by the PCF. If new threshold
is provided only for time or volume, then the measurements shall continue only
for that provided type and the SMF shall ensure that the accumulated usage for
the non provided type is discarded by the UPF.
When the PCF requests to report usage, the SMF shall report the accumulated
usage to the PCF according to the provided usage threshold, i.e. the SMF
reports accumulated volume when the volume threshold was provided by the PCF,
accumulated time when the time threshold was provided by the PCF and both
accumulated volume and accumulated time when volume threshold and time
threshold were provided by the PCF.
If the Usage thresholds for a Monitoring key are not provided to the SMF in
the acknowledgement of a PDU Session modification where its usage was
reported, then the usage monitoring shall not continue in the SMF for that
Monitoring key.
When the Monitoring time occurs, the accumulated volume and/or time usage
shall be recorded by the UPF and reported to the SMF, and:
\- If the subsequent usage threshold value is provided, the usage threshold
shall be reset to this value by the SMF.
\- Otherwise, the usage threshold shall be set by the SMF to the remaining
value of the threshold previously sent by the PCF (i.e. excluding the
accumulated usage).
The first usage report after the Monitoring Time was reached shall indicate
the usage up to the Monitoring time and usage after the Monitoring time.
In order to support time based usage monitoring, the PCF may optionally
indicate to the SMF, along with other usage monitoring information provided,
the Inactivity Detection Time. This value represents the time interval after
which the time measurement shall stop for the Monitoring key, if no packets
are received belonging to the corresponding Monitoring Key during that time
period. Time measurement shall resume on receipt of a further packet belonging
to the Monitoring key.
Time measurement for a Monitoring key shall also be stopped when time based
usage monitoring is disabled, if this happens before the Inactivity Detection
Time is reached.
If an Inactivity Detection Time value of zero is provided, or if no Inactivity
Detection Time is present within the usage monitoring information provided by
the PCF, the time measurement shall be performed continuously from the point
at which it was started until time based usage monitoring is disabled.
The SMF instructs the UPF to provide usage reports to the SMF as described in
TS 23.501, clause 5.8.2.6.
#### 6.2.2.4 QoS control
The SMF receives the authorized QoS for a service data flow in the PCC rule.
The SMF derives the QoS parameters for a QoS Flow (other than the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule) based on the PCC rule information of the
PCC rule(s) bound to this QoS Flow:
\- The SMF shall set the QoS Flow parameters 5QI and ARP to the values of the
corresponding PCC rule parameters.
\- For the QoS Flow parameters QNC, Priority Level, Averaging Window and
Maximum Data Burst Volume, the SMF shall use the corresponding PCC rule
parameters if they are available in the PCC rule.
\- For GBR QoS Flows, the SMF should set the GFBR to the sum of the GBRs of
all PCC rules that are active and bound to that QoS Flow and the MFBR to the
sum of the MBRs of all PCC rules that are active and bound to that GBR QoS
Flow. If a set of PCC Rules is subject to resource sharing as specified in
clause 6.1.3.13 the SMF should use, for each applicable direction, the highest
GBR from the set of PCC Rules sharing resources as input for calculating the
GFBR and may use, for each applicable direction, the highest MBR from the set
of PCC Rules as input for calculating the MFBR.
\- For GBR QoS Flows, the SMF shall set the QoS Flow parameter Maximum Packet
Loss Rate for UL and DL if the corresponding PCC rule parameters are available
in the PCC rule. In the case multiple PCC Rules are bound to the QoS Flow and
the SMF received multiple Maximum Packet Loss Rates, the SMF chooses the
lowest value per direction in all these PCC rules.
\- If the PCC rule contains a non-standardized 5QI, the SMF shall also provide
the corresponding 5G QoS characteristics parameters (as received in the PDU
Session related information Explicitly signalled QoS Characteristics) for the
QoS Flow.
\- If the PCC rule contains Alternative QoS Parameter Sets, the SMF shall
provide their attributes as Alternative QoS Profile(s) (see clause 5.7.1.2a of
TS 23.501 [2]) in the same prioritized order (in which they occur in the PCC
rule) in addition to the QoS parameters for the QoS Flow.
The SMF shall set the QoS parameters of the QoS Flow associated with the
default QoS rule to:
\- the PCC rule parameters contained in the PCC rule that is bound to this QoS
Flow (in the way it is described above) if the PCC rule attribute Bind to QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rule and apply PCC rule parameters is
present; or otherwise
\- the Authorized default 5QI/ARP received in the PDU Session related
information. If the Authorized default 5QI contains a non-standardized 5QI,
the SMF shall also provide the corresponding 5G QoS characteristics parameters
(as received in the PDU Session related information Explicitly signalled QoS
Characteristics) for the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.
The SMF receives the Authorized Session-AMBR in the PDU Session related
information. The SMF ensures that the Authorized Session-AMBR for a PDU
Session is enforced for bandwidth policing at the UPF(s) as described in
clause 5.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
The SMF generates QoS rule(s) as described in TS 23.501 [2]. For a PDU Session
of unstructured type, only one PCC Rule allowing all packets is to be
activated in the SMF and only the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule exists as described in clause 5.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
#### 6.2.2.5 Application detection
The SMF shall instruct the UPF to detect the Start and Stop of the application
traffic for the PCC rules used for application detection (i.e. with
application identifier) that the PCF has activated at the SMF.
If the PCF has subscribed to the event and notification is not muted for the
specific PCC Rule, the SMF shall also instruct the UPF to report the
Start/Stop of application, as described in the TS 23.501 [2].
When receiving the application detection report from UPF, the SMF shall
forward the application identifier, the start/stop indication and, when
service data flow descriptions were deduced, the application instance
identifier(s) and the service data flow description(s), to the PCF.
NOTE: The PCF can make policy decision when receiving the application
detection report.
#### 6.2.2.6 Traffic steering
The SMF shall support traffic steering control as defined in Clause 6.1.3.14.
The SMF may be configured with the traffic steering policy IDs related to the
mechanism enabling traffic steering to the N6-LAN, DN and/or DNAIs associated
with N6 traffic routing requirements.
Upon receiving a PCC rule which contains the traffic steering control
information, the SMF shall provide the information to the UPF for the
enforcement. The traffic steering control information in the PCC rule may
include a set of DNAI(s) and for each DNAI a traffic steering policy ID and/or
N6 traffic routing information dynamically provided by the AF.
Based on the received traffic steering policy ID(s), the UPF may remove or
insert VLAN tags on N6 interface for downlink and uplink frames, respectively.
The details of the scenario is defined in clause 5.6.10.2 of TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE: The UPF can, for example, perform marking packets in order to indicate a
certain type of traffic to the DN side of the N6 reference point which enables
those packets to be steered in the DN. As another example the UPF can forward,
i.e. offload, traffic identified by the traffic descriptor to a local tunnel.
#### 6.2.2.7 Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting
The SMF may support functionality for traffic steering, switching and
splitting within a MA PDU Session, as described in TS 23.501 [2].
Upon receiving a PCC rule which contains the MA PDU Session Control
information, the SMF shall instruct the UPF accordingly and shall also create
and provide applicable ATSSS rules to the UE (the details for both SMF actions
are described in TS 23.501 [2]).
### 6.2.3 Application Function (AF)
The Application Function (AF) is an element offering applications that require
dynamic policy and/or charging control over the user plane behaviour and/or an
element requesting non-session based network capability exposure. The AF shall
communicate with the PCF to transfer dynamic session information, required for
PCF decisions as well as to receive access network specific information and
notifications about events related to the PDU Session or the QoS Flow
transferring the application traffic. One example of an AF is the P‑CSCF of
the IM CN subsystem.
An AF may communicate with multiple PCFs. The mechanism for an AF to select
the PCF associated to a PDU Session based on the UE address is described in
clause 6.1.1.2.
AF may contact the PCF via the NEF for network capability exposure as defined
in clause 4.3.6.
The AF may receive an indication that the service information is not accepted
by the PCF together with service information that the PCF would accept. In
that case, the AF rejects the service establishment towards the UE. If
possible, the AF forwards the service information to the UE that the PCF would
accept.
For certain events related to policy control, the AF shall be able to give
instructions to the PCF to act on its own, i.e. based on the service
information currently available as described in clause 6.1.3.6.
NOTE 1: The QoS authorization based on incomplete service information is
required for e.g. IMS session setup scenarios with available resources on
originating side and a need for resource reservation on terminating side.
The AF may request the PCF to report events related to the PDU Session or the
QoS Flow transferring the application traffic as defined in clause 6.1.3.18.
The AF may use the access network specific information and notifications about
events in the AF session signalling or to adjust the event reporting related
to the PDU Session or the QoS Flow transferring the application traffic.
The AF may contact the PCF via the NEF to request a time window and related
conditions for future BDT. Details of the AF behaviour to support future BDT
are defined in clause 6.1.2.4.
To support sponsored data connectivity the AF may provide the PCF with the
sponsored data connectivity information, including optionally a usage
threshold, as specified in clause 6.2.1.1. The AF may request the PCF to
report events related to sponsored data connectivity.
NOTE 2: Annex D describes the scenario for sponsored data connectivity.
The AF may receive a request to terminate an AF session. The PCF may include
an indication that the transmission resources are lost due to PS to CS
handover.
NOTE 3: The AF action upon reception of the indication that the transmission
resources are lost due to PS to CS handover is application specific. The IMS
uses the indication to prevent a termination of an ongoing session as
specified in TS 24.229 [29] and TS 24.237 [30].
### 6.2.4 Unified Data Repository (UDR)
The Unified Data Repository (UDR) is defined in TS 23.501 [2].
### 6.2.5 Charging Function (CHF)
The Charging Function is specified in TS 32.240 [8].
### 6.2.6 Void
### 6.2.7 Network Exposure Function (NEF)
The Network Exposure Function (NEF) is defined in TS 23.501 [2] and
additionally supports the following policy related functionalities:
\- Service specific policy and charging control;
\- Management of packet flow descriptions;
\- Sponsor data connectivity including usage monitoring (as defined in clause
6.2.1.1);
\- Negotiations for future BDT.
### 6.2.8 Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)
The Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) is defined in TS 23.501 [2]
and additionally supports the following policy related functionalities:
\- Enforcement of access and mobility related policies received from the PCF;
\- Transfers of UE policy information received from the PCF to the UE via N1
interface;
\- Reporting of events to the PCF that the PCF has subscribed to.
### 6.2.9 Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF)
The Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) is defined in TS 23.288 [24].
## 6.3 Policy and charging control rule
### 6.3.1 General
The Policy and charging control rule (PCC rule) comprises the information that
is required to enable the user plane detection of, the policy control and
proper charging for a service data flow. The packets detected by applying the
service data flow template of a PCC rule form a service data flow.
Two different types of PCC rules exist: Dynamic rules and predefined rules.
The dynamic PCC rules are provisioned by the PCF to the SMF, while the
predefined PCC rules are configured into the SMF, as described in TS 23.501
[2], and only referenced by the PCF.
NOTE 1: The procedure for provisioning predefined PCC rules is out of scope
for this specification.
The operator defines the PCC rules.
Table 6.3.1 lists the information contained in a PCC rule, including the
information name, the description and whether the PCF may modify this
information in a dynamic PCC rule which is active in the SMF. The Category
field indicates if a certain piece of information is mandatory or not for the
construction of a PCC rule, i.e. if it is possible to construct a PCC rule
without it.
The differences with table 6.3 in TS 23.203 [4] are shown, either \"none\"
means that the IE applies in 5GS or \"removed\" meaning that the IE does not
apply in 5GS, this is due to the lack of support in the 5GS for this feature
or \"modified\" meaning that the IE applies with some modifications defined in
the IE.

The Rule identifier shall be unique for a PCC rule within a PDU Session. A
dynamically provided PCC rule that has the same Rule identifier value as a
predefined PCC rule shall replace the predefined rule within the same PDU
Session.
The Precedence defines in what order the activated PCC rules within the same
PDU Session shall be applied at the UPF for service data flow detection. When
a dynamic PCC rule and a predefined PCC rule have the same precedence, the
dynamic PCC rule takes precedence.
NOTE 2: The operator shall ensure that overlap between the predefined PCC
rules can be resolved based on precedence of each predefined PCC rule in the
SMF. The PCF shall ensure that overlap between the dynamically allocated PCC
rules can be resolved based on precedence of each dynamically allocated PCC
rule.
For downlink packets all the service data flow templates, activated for the
PDU Session shall be applied for service data flow detection and for the
mapping to the correct QoS Flow. For uplink packets the service data flow
templates activated on their QoS Flow shall be applied for service data flow
detection (further details are provided in clause 6.2.2.2).
The _Service data flow template_ may comprise any number of _Service data flow
filters_ or an _application identifier_ as is defined in table 6.3.1.
NOTE 3: Predefined PCC rules may include service data flow templates, which
support extended capabilities, including enhanced capabilities to identify
events associated with application protocols.
A Service data flow filter contains information for matching user plane
packets for IP PDU traffic or Ethernet PDU traffic. All Service data flow
filters of a Service data flow template shall be of the same type, i.e. either
Packet Filters for IP or Ethernet PDU traffic (defined in clause 5.7.6 of TS
23.501 [2]). The Service data flow template information within an activated
PCC rule is applied by the SMF to instruct the UPF to identify the packets
belonging to a particular service data flow.
For the IP PDU Session type only, the Service data flow template may consist
of an application identifier that references an application detection filter
that is used for matching user plane packets. The application identifier is
also identifying the application, for which the rule applies. The same
application identifier value can occur in a dynamic PCC rule and one or
multiple predefined PCC rules. If so, the PCF shall ensure that there is at
most one PCC rule active per application identifier value at any time.
The _Mute for notification_ defines whether notification to the PCF of
application\'s starts or stops shall be muted. Absence of this parameter means
that start/stop notifications shall be sent.
The _Charging key_ is the reference to the tariff for the service data flow.
Any number of PCC Rules may share the same charging key value. The Charging
key values for each service shall be operator configurable.
NOTE 4: Assigning the same Charging key for several service data flows implies
that the charging does not require the credit management to be handled
separately.
The _Service identifier_ identifies the service. PCC Rules may share the same
service identifier value. The service identifier provides the most detailed
identification, specified for flow-based charging, of a service data flow.
NOTE 5: The PCC rule service identifier need not have any relationship to
service identifiers used on the AF level, i.e. is an operator policy option.
The _Sponsor Identifier_ indicates the (3rd) party organization willing to pay
for the operator\'s charge for connectivity required to deliver a service to
the end user.
The _Application Service Provider Identifier_ indicates the (3rd) party
organization delivering a service to the end user.
The _Charging method_ indicates whether online charging or offline charging is
required, or the service data flow is not subject to any end user charging. If
the charging method identifies that the service data flow is not subject to
any end user charging, a Charging key shall not be included in the PCC rule
for that service data flow, along with other charging related parameters. If
the charging method is omitted the SMF shall apply the default charging method
provided within the PDU Session related policy information (see clause 6.4).
The Charging method is mandatory if there is no default charging method for
the PDU Session.
NOTE 6: With converged charging architecture for 5GC, online charging method
also includes usage reporting from the SMF to the CHF. Hence, setting the
charging method to online will also result in usage reports and thus allow for
offline charging being performed by the CHF.
The _Service Data Flow handling while requesting credit_ indicates either
\"blocking\" if a credit for the Charging Key needs to be granted as a
condition for the PCC Rule to be active or \"non-blocking\" if a credit for
the Charging Key has been requested as a condition for the PCC Rule to be
active.
The _Measurement method_ indicates what measurements apply to charging for a
PCC rule.
The _Service Identifier Level Reporting_ indicates whether the SMF shall
generate reports per Service Identifier. The SMF shall accumulate the
measurements from all PCC rules with the same combination of Charging
key/Service Identifier values in a single report.
The _Application Function Record Information_ identifies an instance of
service usage. A subsequently generated usage report (i.e. CDR), generated as
a result of the PCC rule by the SMF, may include the Application Function
Record Information, if available. The Application Function Record Information
may contain the AF Charging Identifier and/or the Flow identifiers. If
exclusive charging information related to the Application function record
information is required, the PCF shall provide a service identifier, not used
by any other PCC rule of the PDU Session at this point in time, for the AF
session.
NOTE 7: For example, the PCF may be configured to maintain a range of service
identifier values for each service which require exclusive per instance
charging information. Whenever a separate counting or credit management for an
AF session is required, the PCF shall select a value, which is not used at
this point in time, within that range. The uniqueness of the service
identifier in the SMF ensures a separate accounting/credit management while
the AF record information identifies the instance of the service.
The _Gate_ indicates whether the SMF shall instruct the UPF to let a packet
identified by the PCC rule pass through (gate is open) to discard the packet
(gate is closed).
NOTE 8: A packet, matching a PCC Rule with an open gate, may be discarded due
to credit management reasons.
The _5G QoS Identifier_ , 5QI, represents the QoS parameters for the service
data flow. The 5G QoS identifier is scalar and accommodates the need for
differentiating QoS in both 3GPP and non-3GPP access type.
The bitrates indicate the authorized bitrates at the IP packet level of the
SDF, i.e. the bitrates of the IP packets before any access specific
compression or encapsulation.
The _UL maximum-bitrate_ indicates the authorized maximum bitrate for the
uplink component of the service data flow.
The _DL maximum-bitrate_ indicates the authorized maximum bitrate for the
downlink component of the service data flow.
The _UL guaranteed-bitrate_ indicates the authorized guaranteed bitrate for
the uplink component of the service data flow.
The _DL guaranteed-bitrate_ indicates the authorized guaranteed bitrate for
the downlink component of the service data flow.
The \'Maximum bitrate\' is used for enforcement of the maximum bit rate that
the SDF may consume, while the \'Guaranteed bitrate\' is used by the SMF to
determine resource allocation demands.
The _UL sharing indication_ indicates that resource sharing in uplink
direction for service data flows with the same value in their PCC rule shall
be applied by the SMF as described in clause 6.2.2.4.
The _DL sharing indication_ indicates that resource sharing in downlink
direction for service data flows with the same value in their PCC rule shall
be applied by the SMF as described in clause 6.2.2.4.
The _Allocation and Retention Priority_ indicates the allocation, retention
and priority of the service data flow. The ARP contains information about the
priority level, the pre-emption capability and the pre-emption vulnerability.
The Allocation and Retention Priority resolves conflicts of demands for
network resources.
The _Priority Level_ is signalled together with the 5QI to the (R)AN and UPF,
only when a value different from the standardized value in the QoS
characteristics Table 5.7.4-1 in TS 23.501 [2] is required.
The _Averaging Window_ is signalled together with the 5QI to the (R)AN and
UPF, only when a value different from the standardized value in the QoS
characteristics Table 5.7.4-1 in TS 23.501 [2] is required.
The _Maximum Data Burst Volume_ is signalled together with the 5QI to the
(R)AN, only when a value different from the standardized value in the QoS
characteristics Table 5.7.4-1 in TS 23.501 [2] is required.
The _Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule_ indicates that the
SDF shall be bound to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule. The
presence of this parameter attribute causes the 5QI/ARP of the rule to be
ignored by the SMF during the QoS Flow binding.
The _Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and apply PCC rule
parameters_ indicates that the SDF shall be bound to the QoS Flow associated
with the default QoS rule and that the QoS related attributes of the PCC rule
shall be applied by the SMF to derive the QoS parameters of the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule instead of the PDU Session related
information Authorized default 5QI/ARP.
NOTE 9: The Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and apply
PCC rule parameters Indication has to be used whenever the PDU Session related
information Authorized default 5QI/ARP (as described in clause 6.3.1) cannot
be directly used as the QoS parameters of the QoS Flow associated with the
default QoS rule, for example when a GBR 5QI is used or the 5QI priority level
has to be changed.
The _QoS Notification Control,_ QNC _,_ indicates whether notifications are
requested from the access network (i.e. 3GPP RAN) when the GFBR can no longer
(or can again) be guaranteed for a QoS Flow during the lifetime of the QoS
Flow. If it is set and the GFBR can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed,
the access network (i.e. 3GPP RAN) sends a notification towards the SMF, which
then notifies the PCF.
The _Disable UE notifications at changes related to Alternative QoS Profiles
parameter indicates to_ disable QoS Flow parameters signalling to _the UE when
the SMF is notified by the NG-RAN of changes in the fulfilled QoS situation.
The fulfilled situation is either the QoS profile or an Alternative QoS
Profile._
The _Reflective QoS Control_ indicates to apply reflective QoS for the service
data flow. The indication is used to control the RQI marking in the DL packets
of the service data flow and may trigger the sending of the RQA parameter for
the QoS Flow the service data flow is bound to. Reflective QoS is defined in
clause 5.7.5 of TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE 10: While the UE applies a standardized value for the precedence of all
UE derived QoS rules, PCC rules require different precedence values and PCF
configuration has to ensure that there is a large enough value range for the
precedence of PCC rules corresponding to UE derived QoS rules. To avoid that
the precedence of network provided QoS rules need to be changed when
Reflective QoS is activated and filters are overlapping, the PCF will take the
standardized value for the precedence of UE derived QoS rules into account
when setting the precedence value of PCC rules subject to Reflective QoS.
The _Reflective QoS Control_ parameter shall not be used for the PCC rule with
match-all SDF template. If PCC rule with match-all SDF template is present,
the _Reflective QoS Control_ parameter shall not be used for PCC rules which
contain the _Bind to QoS Flow of the default QoS rule_ parameter, either.
The _N6-LAN Traffic Steering Enforcement Control_ contains _Traffic steering
policy identifier(s)_ for steering traffic onto N6-LAN to the appropriate N6
service functions deployed by the operator.
The access network information reporting parameters (_User Location Report_ ,
_UE Timezone Report_) instruct the SMF about what information to forward to
the PCF when the PCC rule is activated, modified or removed.
The _Monitoring Key_ is the reference to a resource threshold. Any number of
PCC Rules may share the same monitoring key value. The monitoring key values
for each service shall be operator configurable.
The _Indication of exclusion from session level monitoring_ indicates that the
service data flow shall be excluded from the PDU Session usage monitoring.
The _AF influenced Traffic Steering Enforcement Control_ contains:
_\- a set of DNAI(s)_ (i.e. a reference to the DNAI(s) the SMF needs to
consider for UPF selection/reselection), an optional Indication of traffic
correlation and, per DNAI, a corresponding Traffic steering policy identifier
(i.e. a reference to a pre-configured traffic steering policy at the SMF),
and/or a corresponding N6 traffic routing information (when the N6 traffic
routing information is provided explicitly as part of the AF influence
request, as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2]), or;
\- an AF subscription to UP change events parameter which contains
subscription information defined in clause 5.2.8.3 of TS 23.502 [3] for the
change of UP path Event Id i.e. an Indication of early and/or late
notification and information on where to provide the corresponding
notifications (Notification Target Address + Notification Correlation ID as
specified in clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3]) and optionally an indication of
\"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" to the corresponding notifications as
described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].
The _Traffic Steering Enforcement Control_ may contain Indication of UE IP
address preservation. The SMF takes this indication into account when
determining whether to reselect PSA UPF, as specified in clause 5.6.7 of TS
23.501 [2].
The _Redirect_ indicates whether the uplink part of the service data flow
should be redirected to a controlled address.
The _Redirect Destination_ indicates the target redirect address when
_Redirect_ is enabled.
The _UL Maximum Packet Loss Rate_ indicates the maximum rate for lost packets
that can be tolerated in the uplink direction.
The _DL Maximum Packet Loss Rate_ indicates the maximum rate for lost packets
that can be tolerated in the downlink direction.
The _Application descriptors_ provides one or several instances of the OSId
and OSAppId combination. It is used by the UE to identify the application
traffic corresponding to the application identifier to apply the Steering
Functionality and the Steering mode.
The _Steering Functionality_ indicates the method for how traffic matching the
SDF template is sent over the MA PDU Session. The method ATSSS_LL indicates
that the traffic matching the SDF template is sent over the MA PDU Session
without additional tunnelling, e.g. with IP flow switching. The method MPTCP
indicates that the traffic matching the SDF template is sent over the MA PDU
Session using MPTCP.
The _Steering mode_ indicates the rule for distributing traffic between
accesses, together with the associated parameters. The PCF may indicate
separate values for up-link and down-link directions. The available steering
modes are defined in TS 23.501 [2].
The _Charging key for Non-3GPP access_ indicates the Charging key that shall
be used for charging the detected service data flow traffic carried via
Non-3GPP access. The other charging related parameters apply for both
accesses.
The _Monitoring key for Non-3GPP access_ indicates the Monitoring key that
shall be used for monitoring the usage of the detected service data flow
traffic carried via Non-3GPP access.
The _QoS parameter(s) to be measured_ indicates the UL packet delay, DL packet
delay or round trip packet delay between the UE and the UPF is to be monitored
when the QoS Monitoring for URLLC is enabled for the service data flow.
The _Reporting frequency_ indicates the frequency for the reporting, such as
event triggered, periodic. The following applies:
\- If the _Reporting frequency_ indicates \"periodic\", the _reporting period_
shall also be included in the PCC rule.
\- The _reporting period_ shall also be used for reporting measurement failure
in any of the _Reporting frequency_ modes \"periodic\" or \" event triggered
\": if no measurement result is available in the UPF within the _reporting
period_ , the UPF shall report to the SMF and the SMF shall report to the PCF
or to the AF indicating a measurement failure.
\- If the _Reporting frequency_ indicates \"event triggered\", the _reporting
period_ , _Reporting threshold(s)_ and the _minimum waiting time_ shall also
be included in the PCC rule. The _Reporting threshold(s)_ indicates the
measurement threshold for each of the included _QoS parameter(s)_ to be
measured, i.e. the UL packet delay, DL packet delay or round trip packet
delay. When _Reporting threshold(s)_ is exceeded, the UPF shall report to the
SMF and the SMF shall report to the PCF or to the AF. If more than one value
is received at one given point of time for UL packet delay, DL packet delay or
round trip packet delay respectively, the SMF reports the minimum and maximum
packet delays to the PCF or the AF. The SMF sends the first report when the
_Reporting threshold_ is exceeded and the minimum waiting time is applied for
the subsequent report (if the threshold is exceeded after the waiting time).
The _Target of reporting_ indicates the target for the QoS Monitoring reports
sent as notifications. It can be either the PCF or the AF (the NEF may be on
the path between SMF and AF). The PCF shall include Notification Target
Address + Notification Correlation ID as specified in clause 4.15.1 of TS
23.502 [3].
The _Alternative QoS Parameter Set(s)_ define alternative set(s) of QoS
parameters for the service data flow. Every set consists of a PER, a PDB, as
well as an UL and a DL guaranteed bitrate QoS parameter.
The TSC Assistance Container contains the following parameters:
\- The Burst Arrival Time is sent to the SMF to indicate burst arrival time at
the ingress port of 5GS for a given flow direction (DS-TT for UL, NW-TT for
DL). It is used by the SMF to determine TSCAI burst arrival time as defined in
clause 5.27.2 of TS 23.501 [2] to assist transmission of deterministic flows
on Uu.
The Periodicity is sent to the SMF to indicate the time between bursts. It is
used by the SMF to forward to RAN as part of TSCAI in order to assist
transmission of deterministic flows on Uu.
\- The Flow direction is sent to SMF to indicate the direction of the flow (UL
or DL).
The _Downlink Data Notification Control_ applies to the control of
subscription to Downlink Data Delivery status event notifications and DDN
Failure event notifications as specified in clause 4.15.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
The following parameters are included:
\- The _Notification control for DDD status_ applies as described in clause
4.15.3.2.8 of TS 23.502 [3] and contains the following parameters:
\- indication that notifications of Downlink Data Delivery status are
required; and
\- the requested type of such notifications (notifications about downlink
packets being buffered, and/or discarded).
\- The _Notification Control for DDN Failure_ applies as described in clause
4.15.3.2.9 of TS 23.502 [3] and contains the following parameters:
\- indication that notifications of DDN Failure are required.
NOTE 11: Downlink Data Notification Control information is provided to assist
the SMF in the generation/update of N4 information. The PCF will not be
notified about the Downlink data delivery status events or the DDN Failure
events.
### 6.3.2 Policy and charging control rule operations
Policy and Charging Rule operations consist of activation, modification and
de-activation of PCC rules. The PCF may activate, modify and deactivate a PCC
rule at any time. However, the modification is applicable to dynamic PCC rules
only.
Activation of a dynamic PCC rule provides the PCC rule information to the SMF.
Activation of a predefined PCC rule provides an identifier of the relevant PCC
rule to the SMF.
Each PCC rule shall be installed for a single QoS Flow only (for further
details about predefined PCC rules see below).
An active PCC rule means that:
\- the service data flow template shall be used for service data flow
detection;
\- the service data flow template shall be used for mapping of downlink
packets to the QoS Flow determined by the QoS Flow binding;
\- the service data flow template shall be used for service data flow
detection of uplink packets on the PDU Session determined by the QoS Flow
binding;
\- usage data for the service data flow shall be recorded;
\- policies associated with the PCC rule, if any, shall be invoked;
\- for service data flow detection with an application detection filter, the
start or the stop of the application traffic is reported to the PCF, if
applicable and requested by the PCF. In that case, the notification for start
may include service data flow filters, (if possible to provide) and the
application instance identifier associated with the service data flow filters.
\- Either one of the conditions below:
\- a credit has been granted for the service data flow. Applicable when the
Charging method is set to \"online\" and the Service Data Flow handling while
requesting credit is set to \"blocking\"; or
\- a credit has been requested for the service data flow. Applicable when the
Charging method is set to \"online\" and the Service Data Flow handling while
requesting credit is set to \"non-blocking\".
A predefined PCC rule is known at least, within the scope of one PDU Session.
NOTE 1: The same predefined PCC rule can be activated for multiple QoS Flows
in multiple PDU Sessions.
A predefined PCC rule is bound to one and only one QoS Flow per PDU Session.
For a predefined PCC rule whose service data flow cannot be fully reflected
for the uplink direction in terms of traffic mapping information sent to the
UE, the SMF may request the UPF to apply the uplink service data flow
detection at additional QoS Flows with non-GBR 5QI of the same PDU Session.
The deactivation of such a predefined PCC rule ceases its service data flow
detection for the whole PDU Session.
The PCF may, at any time, deactivate an active PCC rule in the SMF. At QoS
Flow termination all active PCC rules on that QoS Flow are deactivated without
explicit instructions from the PCF to do so.
Policy and charging control rule operations can be also performed in a
deferred mode. A PCC rule may have either a single deferred activation time,
or a single deferred deactivation time or both.
A PCC rule with only a deferred activation time shall be inactive until that
time. A PCC rule with only a deferred deactivation time shall be active until
that time. When the rule activation time occurs prior to the rule deactivation
time, the rule is inactive until the activation and remains active until the
deactivation time occurs. When the rule deactivation time occurs prior to the
rule activation time, the rule is initially active until the deactivation
time, then remains inactive until the activation time, and then becomes active
again. An inactive PCC rule, that has not been activated yet, is still
considered to be installed, and may be removed by the PCF. When modifying a
dynamic PCC rule by setting, modifying or clearing its deferred activation
and/or deactivation time or by changing any other attribute of a PCC rule
having a deferred activation and/or deactivation time, the PCF shall provide
all attributes of that PCC rule, including attributes that have not changed.
NOTE 2: In this case, the PCF omission of an attribute that has a prior value
will erase that attribute from the rule.
Deferred activation and deactivation of PCC rules can only be used for PCC
rules that belong to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule that
allows all UL packets.
Deferred modification of PCC rules shall not be applied for changes of the QoS
or service data flow filter information of PCC rules.
NOTE 3: This limitation prevents dependencies on the signalling of changed
traffic mapping information towards the UE.
## 6.4 PDU Session related policy information
The purpose of the PDU Session related policy information is to provide policy
and charging control related information that is applicable to a single
Monitoring key or the whole PDU Session respectively. The PCF may provide PDU
Session related policy information to the SMF together with PCC rules or
separately.
Table 6.4-1 includes the PDU Session related policy information.
The differences with table 6.4 and table 6.6 in TS 23.203 [4] are shown,
either \"none\" means that the IE applies in 5GS or \"removed\" meaning that
the IE does not apply in 5GS, this is due to the lack of support in the 5GS
for this feature or \"modified\" meaning that the IE applies with some
modifications defined in the IE.

| | | | | | shall be a | | | | | | short list | | | | | | of | | | | | | elements. | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
Upon the initial interaction with the SMF, the PCF may provide the following
attributes to the SMF:
The _Charging information_ contains addresses of the CHF that manages charging
for the PDU Session and optionally the associated CHF instance ID and CHF set
ID (see clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501 [2]). If received, the SMF shall apply it
as defined in clause 6.3.11 of TS 23.501 [2].
The _Default charging method_ indicates what charging method shall be used in
the PDU Session for every PCC rule where the charging method identifier is
omitted, including predefined PCC rules that are activated by the SMF. If
received by the SMF, it supersedes the _Default charging method_ in the
charging characteristics profile.
The _PDU Session with offline charging only_ can be assigned to a PDU Session
by the PCF to indicate that the online charging method is never set for any of
the PCC Rules activated during the lifetime of the PDU Session nor provided as
Default charging method.
NOTE 1: If this parameter is provided by the PCF or configured in the SMF
charging characteristics the SMF can use the Nchf_OfflineOnlyCharging service
instead of the Nchf_ConvergedCharging service for a PDU Session as defined in
TS 32.255 [21].
The _IP Index_ indicates the IP Address/Prefix allocation method which is used
by the SMF for IP Address/Prefix allocation during PDU Session Establishment
procedure as defined in clause 5.8.2.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
Upon every interaction with the SMF, the PCF may provide the following
attributes to the SMF:
The _Revalidation time limit_ defines the time period within which the SMF
shall trigger a request for PCC rules for an established PDU Session.
The _Reflective QoS Timer_ defines the lifetime of a UE derived QoS rule
belonging to the PDU Session. It is used in the UE as defined in clause
5.7.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE 2: The Reflective QoS Timer that is sent to the UE has to be in alignment
with the corresponding timer configured in the UPF (defined in clause 5.7.5.3
of TS 23.501 [2]).
The _Authorized Session-AMBR_ defines the UL/DL Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for
the Non-GBR QoS Flows of the PDU Session, which is enforced in the UPF as
defined in clause 5.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. The PCF may provide the _Authorized
Session-AMBR_ in every interaction with the SMF. When the SMF receives it from
the PDU Session policy, it is provided to the UPF over N4 interface for the
enforcement.
The _Authorized default 5QI/ARP_ defines the 5QI and ARP values of the QoS
Flow associated with the default QoS rule as described in clause 6.2.2.4. The
SMF applies the _Authorized default 5QI/ARP_ also for the QoS Flow binding as
described in clause 6.1.3.2.4.
The _Time Condition_ and _Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR / Subsequent
Authorized default 5QI/ARP_ are used together and up to four instances with
different values of the _Time Condition_ parameter may be provided by the PCF.
_Time Condition_ indicates that the associated _Subsequent Authorized Session-
AMBR/ Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP_ is only applied when the time
defined by this attribute is met. When the SMF receives a _Time Condition_ and
_Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR/ Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP_
pair, it stores it locally. The SMF shall discard any previously received
_Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR_ / _Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP_
instances on explicit instruction as well as whenever the PCF provides a new
instruction for one or more _Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR_ / _Subsequent
Authorized default 5QI/ARP_. When the time defined by the _Time Condition_
parameter is reached, the SMF shall apply (or instruct the UPF to apply)
_Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR/ Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP_.
NOTE 3: In order to reduce the risk for signalling overload, the PCF should
avoid simultaneous provisioning of the _Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR/
Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP_ for many UEs (e.g. by spreading over
time).
NOTE 4: In order to provide further _Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR/
Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP_ in a timely fashion the PCF can use its
own clock to issue the desired changes or use the Revalidation time limit
parameter to trigger an SMF request for a policy decision.
NOTE 5: For services that depend on specific Session-AMBR and/or default
5QI/ARP (e.g. MPS session) the PCF is responsible to ensure that no
_Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR_ or _Subsequent Authorized default
5QI/ARP_ interfere with the service, e.g. by removing the _Subsequent
Authorized Session-AMBR_ or _Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP_ before the
respective change time is reached.
The _Monitoring Key_ is the reference to a resource threshold. Any number of
PCC Rules may share the same monitoring key value. The monitoring key values
for each service shall be operator configurable.
It shall also be possible for an operator to use the _Monitoring Key_
parameter to indicate usage monitoring on an PDU Session level or, in the case
of an MA PDU Session, to indicate usage monitoring on PDU Session level for
the 3GPP access and/or the Non-3GPP access.
Usage monitoring on PDU Session level is active when a PDU Session is active
when a _Monitoring Key_ for the PDU Session and a corresponding volume and/or
time threshold value have been provided to the SMF. Usage monitoring on
Monitoring key level is active when a volume and/or time threshold has been
provided for a _Monitoring Key_ to the SMF and there is at least one PCC rule
active for the PDU Session that is associated with that _Monitoring Key_.
The _Volume threshold_ indicates the overall user traffic volume value after
which the SMF shall report the Usage threshold reached trigger to the PCF.
The _Time threshold_ indicates the overall resource time usage after which the
SMF shall report the Usage threshold reached trigger to the PCF.
The _Monitoring time_ indicates the time at which the SMF shall store the
accumulated usage information.
The _Subsequent Volume threshold_ indicates the overall user traffic volume
value measured after Monitoring time, after which the SMF shall report the
Usage threshold reached trigger to the PCF.
The _Subsequent Time threshold_ indicates the overall resource time usage
measured after Monitoring time, after which the SMF shall report the Usage
threshold reached trigger to the PCF.
The _Inactivity Detection Time_ indicates the period of time after which the
time measurement shall stop, if no packets are received during that time
period.
The _Port Management Information Container_ carries Ethernet port management
information for an Ethernet port located in DS-TT or NW-TT. The port for which
the container is provided is identified by the port number.
The _Bridge Management Information Container_ carries Bridge management
information for a 5GS Bridge.
## 6.5 Access and mobility related policy information
To enable the enforcement in the 5GC system of the access and mobility policy
decisions made by the PCF for the control of the service area restrictions and
RFSP Index, the 5GC system may provide the Access and mobility related policy
control information from the PCF to the AMF.
Table 6.5-1 lists the AMF access and mobility related policy information.

## 6.6 UE policy information
### 6.6.1 Access Network Discovery & Selection Policy Information
#### 6.6.1.1 General
The Access Network Discovery & Selection policy is an optional policy that may
be provided to UE by the network.
In this release of the specification, the Access Network Discovery & Selection
policy shall contain only rules that aid the UE in selecting a WLAN access
network. Rules for selecting other types of non-3GPP access networks are not
specified.
The WLAN access network selected by the UE with the use of Access Network
Discovery & Selection policy may be used for direct traffic offload (i.e.
sending traffic to the WLAN outside of a PDU Session) and for registering to
5GC using the non-3GPP access network selection information.
If the UE supports non-3GPP access to 5GC, it shall support ANDSP.
The procedure for WLAN access network selection is defined in clause 6.6.1.3,
the procedure for N3IWF selection is defined in clause 6.3.6.1 of TS 23.501
[2].
The Access Network Discovery & Selection policy shall contain one or more WLAN
Selection Policy (WLANSP) rules defined in clause 4.8.2.1.6 of TS 23.402 [9].
The Access Network Discovery & Selection policy may contain information to
select ePDG or N3IWF by the UE as specified in TS 23.501 [2]

Mandatory Yes UE context ePDG identifier configuration The UE uses this
information to select ePDG as defined in clause 6.3.6.1 of TS 23.501 [2]
Optional Yes UE context N3IWF identifier configuration The UE uses this
information to select N3IWF as defined in clause 6.3.6.1 of TS 23.501 [2]
Optional Yes UE context Non-3GPP access node (N3AN) selection information The
UE uses this information to select ePDG or N3IWF as defined in clause 6.3.6.1
of TS 23.501 [2] Optional Yes UE context
#### 6.6.1.2 UE selecting a WLANSP rule
The UE may be provisioned with multiple valid WLANSP rules (by the HPLMN and
by the VPLMN when the UE is roaming). A WLANSP rule is valid if it meets the
validity conditions included in the WLANSP rule (if provided).
When the UE is in the home the UE uses the valid WLANSP rules from the home
PLMN to select an available WLAN. When the UE is roaming and the UE has valid
rules from both HPLMN and VPLMN the UE gives priority to the valid WLANSP
rules from the VPLMN.
#### 6.6.1.3 UE procedure for selecting a WLAN access based on WLANSP rules
The UE shall apply the procedure in this clause when the UE is provisioned
with WLANSP rules and:
a) when the UE initiates untrusted non-3GPP access to 5GC and attempts to
select a WLAN access network; or
b) when the UE initiates trusted non-3GPP access to 5GC by executing the
Access Network Selection Procedure specified in clause 6.3.12.2 of TS 23.501
[2] and attempts to select a WLAN access network.
When the UE has valid 3GPP subscription credentials (i.e. a valid USIM) and
WLANSP rules, the UE shall perform WLAN selection based on these rules, the
applicable User Preferences On Non-3GPP Access Selection and the corresponding
procedures specified in this document. User Preferences On Non-3GPP Access
Selection take precedence over the WLANSP rules.
The UE determines the most preferred WLAN access network using WLANSP rules
when a WLAN access network cannot be selected based on User Preferences On
Non-3GPP Access Selection (e.g. when there are no User Preferences On Non-3GPP
Access Selection or when there is no user-preferred WLAN access network
available).
The UE constructs a prioritized list of the available WLANs by discovering the
available WLANs and comparing their attributes / capabilities against the
groups of selection criteria in the valid WLANSP rule(s). When there are
multiple valid WLANSP rules the UE evaluates the valid WLANSP rules in
priority order. The UE evaluates first if an available WLAN access meets the
criteria of the highest priority valid WLANSP rule. The UE then evaluates if
an available WLAN access meets the selection criteria of the next priority
valid WLANSP rule.
Within a valid WLANSP rule, the WLAN(s) that match the group of selection
criteria with the highest priority are considered as the most preferred WLANs,
the WLAN(s) that match the group of selection criteria with the second highest
priority are considered as the second most preferred WLANs, etc.
When a group of selection criteria includes the HomeNetwork attribute and is
set, then the UE (a) shall create a list of available WLANs that directly
interwork with the home operator (as specified in clause 4.8.2.1.6 of TS
23.402 [9]) and (b) shall apply the group of selection criteria to all the
WLANs in this list. Otherwise, when the HomeNetwork attribute is not set or is
not present, the UE shall apply the group of selection criteria to all
available WLANs. The UE may need to perform ANQP procedures (as specified in
the HS2.0 Rel‑2 specification [ref]) or other procedures in order to discover
the attributes / capabilities of the available WLANs.
When the UE is roaming the UE may have valid WLANSP rules from both the VPLMN
and the HPLMN. In such a case the UE gives priority to the valid WLANSP rules
from the VPLMN. The UE constructs a prioritised list of the available WLANs
when the available WLAN accesses meet the selection criteria of the valid
rules from the VPLMN and the valid rules from the HPLMN. The prioritised WLAN
accesses based on the WLANSP rules from the HPLMN will have lower priority
from the prioritised list of WLAN access based on the WLANSP rules of the
VPLMN.

Each URSP rule contains a Traffic descriptor (containing one or more
components described in Table 6.6.2.1-2) that determines when the rule is
applicable. A URSP rule is determined to be applicable when every component in
the Traffic descriptor matches the corresponding information from the
application. A URSP rule is determined not to be applicable when for any given
component in the Traffic descriptor:
\- No corresponding information from the application is available; or
\- The corresponding information from the application does not match any of
the values in the Traffic descriptor component.
NOTE 1: It is recommended to avoid listing more than two components in the
Traffic descriptor of a URSP rule.
If a URSP rule is provided that contains a Traffic descriptor with two or more
components, it is recommended to also provide URSP rule(s) with lower
precedence and a Traffic descriptor with less components, in order to increase
the likelihood of URSP rule matching for a particular application.
Each URSP rule contains a list of Route Selection Descriptors containing one
or multiple Route Selection Descriptors each having a different Route
Selection Descriptor Precedence value. A Route Selection Descriptor contains
one or more of the following components:
\- Session and Service Continuity (SSC) Mode: Indicates that the traffic of
the matching application shall be routed via a PDU Session supporting the
included SSC Mode.
\- Network Slice Selection: Indicates that the traffic of the matching
application shall be routed via a PDU Session supporting any of the included
S-NSSAIs, see clause 5.15.4 in TS 23.501 [2]. It includes one or more
S-NSSAI(s).
\- DNN Selection: Indicates that the traffic of the matching application shall
be routed via a PDU Session supporting any of the included DNNs. It includes
one or more DNN(s). When DNN is used in Traffic descriptor, corresponding
Route Selection Descriptor of the rule shall not include DNN Selection
component.
\- PDU Session Type Selection: Indicates that the traffic of matching
application shall be routed via a PDU Session supporting the included PDU
Session Type. The possible PDU Session Types are defined in clause 5.6.10 in
TS 23.501 [2].
\- Non-Seamless Offload indication: Indicates that traffic of the matching
application is to be offloaded to non-3GPP access outside of a PDU Session
when the rule is applied. If this component is present in a Route Selection
Descriptor, no other components shall be included in the Route Selection
Descriptor.
\- Access Type Preference: If the UE needs to establish a PDU Session when the
rule is applied, this indicates the Access Type (3GPP or non-3GPP or multi-
access) on which the PDU Session should be established. The type \"Multi-
Access\" indicates that the PDU Session should be established as a MA PDU
Session, using both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
\- Time Window: The Route Selection Descriptor is not be considered valid
unless the UE is in the time window.
\- Location Criteria: The Route Selection Descriptor is not be considered
valid unless the UE\'s location matches the Location Criteria.
NOTE 2: The structure of the URSP does not define how the PCF splits the URSP
when URSP cannot be delivered to the UE in a single NAS message.
NOTE 3: It is expected that UE applications will not be able to change or
override the PDU Session parameters in the URSP rules. A UE application can
express preferences when it requests a network connection (e.g. certain
Connection Capabilities), which can be mapped into specific PDU Session
parameters by the URSP rules.
NOTE 4: When one Route Selection Descriptor in a URSP rule contains a Time
Window or Location Criteria, all Route Selection Descriptors in the URSP rule
must contain a Time Window or Location Criteria.
In the case of network rejection of the PDU Session Establishment Request, the
UE may trigger a new PDU Session establishment based on the rejection cause
and the URSP policy.
When the PCF provisions URSP rules to the UE, one URSP rule with a \"match
all\" Traffic descriptor may be included.
NOTE 5: When URSP rules containing NSSP are available to the UE and the URSP
rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor is not part of them, a UE
application that has no matching URSP rule and no UE Local Configuration
cannot request a network connection.
The URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor is used to route the
traffic of applications which do not match any other URSP rules and shall
therefore be evaluated as the last URSP rule, i.e. with lowest priority. There
shall be only one Route Selection Descriptor in this URSP rule. The Route
Selection Descriptor in this URSP rule includes at most one value for each
Route Selection Component.
NOTE 6: How to set the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor as
the URSP rule with lowest priority is defined in TS 24.526 [19].
#### 6.6.2.2 Configuration and Provision of URSP
The UE may be provisioned with URSP rules by PCF of the HPLMN. When the UE is
roaming, the PCF in the HPLMN may update the URSP rule in the UE. For URSP
rules, the UE shall support the provisioning from the PCF in the HPLMN, as
specified in TS 24.501 [22]. In addition, the UE may be also pre-configured
with URSP rules (e.g. by the operator).
Only the URSP rules provisioned by the PCF is used by the UE, if both URSP
rules provisioned by the PCF and pre-configured URSP rules are present. If no
URSP rule is provisioned by the PCF, and the UE has pre-configured rules
configured in both the USIM and ME, then only the pre-configured URSP rules
configured in the USIM is used.
#### 6.6.2.3 UE procedure for associating applications to PDU Sessions based
on URSP
For every newly detected application the UE evaluates the URSP rules in the
order of Rule Precedence and determines if the application is matching the
Traffic descriptor of any URSP rule.
When a URSP rule is determined to be applicable for a given application (see
clause 6.6.2.1), the UE shall select a Route Selection Descriptor within this
URSP rule in the order of the Route Selection Descriptor Precedence.
When a valid Route Selection Descriptor is found, the UE determines if there
is an existing PDU Session that matches all components in the selected Route
Selection Descriptor. The UE compares the components of the selected Route
Selection Descriptor with the existing PDU Session(s) as follows:
\- For a component which only contains one value (e.g. SSC mode), the value of
the PDU Session has to be identical to the value specified in the Route
Selection Descriptor.
\- For a component which contains a list of values (e.g. Network Slice
Selection), the value of the PDU Session has to be identical to one of the
values specified in the Route Selection Descriptor.
\- When some component(s) is not present in the Route Selection Descriptor, a
PDU Session is considered matching only if it was established without
including the missing component(s) in the PDU Session Establishment Request.
\- When the Route Selection Descriptor includes a Time Window or a Location
Criteria, the PDU Session is considered matching only if the PDU Session is
associated with an RSD that has the same Time Window or a Location Criteria
Validity Conditions.
When a matching PDU Session exists the UE associates the application to the
existing PDU Session, i.e. route the traffic of the detected application on
this PDU Session.
If the UE determines that there is more than one existing PDU Session which
matches (e.g. the selected Route Selection Descriptor only specifies the
Network Slice Selection, while there are multiple existing PDU Sessions
matching the Network Slice Selection with different DNNs), it is up to UE
implementation to select one of them to use.
NOTE 1: When more than one PDU Sessions of SSC mode 3 to the same DNN and
S-NSSAI exist due to PDU Session anchor change procedure as described in
clause 4.3.5.2 of TS 23.502 [3], the UE can take the PDU Session Address
Lifetime value into account when selecting the PDU Session.
If none of the existing PDU Sessions matches, the UE tries to establish a new
PDU Session using the values specified by the selected Route Selection
Descriptor. If the PDU Session Establishment Request is accepted, the UE
associates the application to this new PDU Session. If the PDU Session
Establishment Request is rejected, based on the rejection cause, the UE
selects another combination of values in the currently selected Route
Selection Descriptor if any other value for the rejected component in the same
Route Selection Description can be used. Otherwise, the UE selects the next
Route Selection Descriptor, which contains a combination of component value
which is not rejected by network, in the order of the Route Selection
Descriptor Precedence, if any. If the UE fails to establish a PDU Session with
any of the Route Selection Descriptors, it tries other URSP rules in the order
of Rule Precedence with matching Traffic descriptors, except the URSP rule
with the \"match-all\" Traffic descriptor, if any. The UE shall not use the UE
Local Configuration in this case.
The UE receives the updated URSP rules and (re-)evaluates their validities in
a timely manner when certain conditions are met, for example:
\- the URSP is updated by the PCF;
\- the UE moves from EPC to 5GC;
\- change of Allowed NSSAI or Configured NSSAI;
\- change of LADN DNN availability;
\- UE registers over 3GPP or non-3GPP access;
\- UE establishes connection to a WLAN access.
Details of the conditions are defined by TS 24.526 [19].
NOTE 2: When providing the updated URSP rules to the UE with a new DNN, the
PCF can set the SMF selection management trigger in the AMF to contact the PCF
at PDU Session establishment (as specified in clause 6.1.2.5) if the old DNN
is requested by the UE.
The Route Selection Descriptor of a URSP rule shall be only considered valid
if all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
\- If any S-NSSAI(s) is present, the S-NSSAI(s) is in the Allowed NSSAI for
the non-roaming case and in the mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN
S-NSSAI(s) for the roaming case.
\- If any DNN is present and the DNN is an LADN DNN, the UE is in the area of
availability of this LADN.
\- If Access Type preference is present and set to Multi-Access, the UE
supports ATSSS.
\- If a Time Window is present and the time matches what is indicated in the
Time Window.
\- If a Location Criteria is present and the UE location matches what is
indicated in the Location Criteria.
If a matching URSP rule has no valid RSD, the UE tries other URSP rules in the
order of Rule Precedence with matching Traffic descriptors, except the URSP
rule with \"match-all\" Traffic descriptor. The UE shall not use the UE Local
Configuration in this case.
When URSP rules are updated or their validity according to the conditions
above change, the association of existing applications to PDU Sessions may
need to be re-evaluated. The UE may also re-evaluate the application to PDU
Session association due to the following reasons:
\- periodic re-evaluation based on UE implementation;
\- an existing PDU Session that is used for routing traffic of an application
based on a URSP rule is released;
\- The expiration of Time Window in Route Selection Validation Criteria, i.e.
the expiration of Time Window, or UE\'s location no longer matches the
Location Criteria.
NOTE 3: It is up to UE implementation to avoid frequent re-evaluation due to
location change.
If the re-evaluation leads to a change of the application to PDU Session
association, e.g. the application is to be associated with another PDU Session
or a new PDU Session needs to be established, the UE may enforce such changes
in a timely manner based on implementation, e.g. immediately or when UE enters
CM-IDLE state.
If the selected Route Selection Descriptor contains a Non-Seamless Offload
indication and the UE has established a connection to a WLAN access, the UE
routes the traffic matching the Traffic descriptor of the URSP rule via the
WLAN access outside of a PDU Session.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Deployment option to support of BSF and DRA
coexistence due to network migration
During the network migration, DRA and BSF may coexist in operator\'s network.
The DRA can be a consumer of Nbsf services and the BSF can provide binding
functionality for different subscribers. When the AF using Rx, such as P-CSCF,
sends Rx request to the DRA, if the DRA has no binding information for the
subscriber, based on configuration or via NRF, it selects the BSF. Then the
DRA can query the BSF by invoking Nbsf_Management discovery service operation,
to get the relevant PCF address, based on which the DRA routes the Rx request
to the selected PCF.
NOTE: The DRA decides to select a BSF based on user IP address range.
###### ## Annex C (Normative): Support for Application Functions supporting Rx
interface
To allow the 5G system to interwork with AFs related to existing services,
e.g. IMS based services as described in TS 23.228 [5], Mission Critical Push
To Talk services as described in TS 23.179 [6], the PCF shall support the
corresponding IMS procedures defined in the main body of this TS via Rx
interface. This facilitates the migration from EPC to 5GC without requiring
these AFs to upgrade to support the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization services in
Rel-16.
Figure C-1: Interworking between 5G Policy framework and AFs supporting Rx
interface
Session Binding applies for PDU Sessions of IP type only.
The functionality described for Multimedia Priority Services (clause 6.1.3.11)
and Mission Critical service (clause 6.1.3.19) applies via Rx interface.
In order to support IMS Emergency services over Rx interface, in addition to
the functional description in clause 6.1.3.10, the following applies: The PCF
shall provide the IMEI and the subscriber identifiers (IMSI, MSISDN) (if
available), received from the SMF at PDU Session establishment, if so
requested by the P-CSCF. The PCF derives the IMEI from the PEI, the IMSI from
the SUPI and the MSISDN from the GPSI.
NOTE 1: TS 23.501 [2] defines both 5G identifiers, SUPI, PEI and GPSI and then
how they are allocated to allow interworking with functional entities not
supporting 5G identifies such as P-CSCF.
Any AF using Rx, such as P-CSCF, the BSF determines the selected PCF address
according to the information included in the incoming Rx requests and the
information stored at the BSF. The BSF is able to proxy or redirect Rx
requests targeting an IP address of a UE to the selected PCF.
The following event reporting is supported over Rx interface:
Table C-1: Events relevant for reporting from the PCF
Event Description Availability for Rx Session
* * *
PLMN Identifier Notification The PLMN identifier where the UE is currently
located. Yes Change of Access Type The Access Type and, if applicable, the RAT
Type of the PDU Session has changed. Yes EPS fallback EPS fallback is
initiated Yes Signalling path status The status of the resources related to
the signalling traffic of the AF session. Yes Access Network Charging
Correlation Information The Access Network Charging Correlation Information of
the resources allocated for the AF session. Yes Access Network Information
Notification The user location and/or timezone when the PDU Session has
changed in relation to the AF session. Yes Reporting Usage for Sponsored Data
Connectivity The usage threshold provided by the AF has been reached; or the
AF session is terminated. Yes Resource allocation status The status of the
resources related to the AF session (established/released). Yes QoS targets
can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled The QoS targets can no longer (or
can again) be fulfilled by the network for (a part of) the AF session. No Out
of credit Credit is no longer available. Yes
###### ## Annex D (informative): PCC usage for sponsored data connectivity
# D.1 General
With sponsored data connectivity, the Sponsor has a business relationship with
the operator and the Sponsor reimburses the operator for the user\'s data
connectivity in order to allow the user access to an associated Application
Service Provider\'s (ASP) services. Alternatively, the user pays for the
connectivity with a transaction which is separate from the subscriber\'s
charging. It is assumed the user already has a subscription with the operator.
A possible deployment configuration for sponsored data connectivity in the
non-roaming case is illustrated in Figure D.1-1.
NOTE 1: Sponsored data connectivity is not supported in the roaming with
visited access scenario in this Release.
Figure D.1-1: Deployment for sponsored data connectivity
The relationship between the AF and Sponsor and between the Sponsor and ASP is
out of scope of this specification. A single AF can serve multiple ASPs and
multiple sponsors.
NOTE 2: An ASP can also be a sponsor.
The sponsor may choose to supply the PCF (via the AF) with the usage
thresholds that it expects the SMF to enforce. Alternatively, the Sponsor can
allow the ASP to enforce such control over the sponsored data connectivity.
The information required for the detection of sponsored HTTP traffic (i.e.
server host name) can be verified with the corresponding server IP
address/prefix of the IP packets by the SMF. The SMF uses implementation
specific logic to perform this verification.
# D.2 Reporting for sponsored data connectivity
There are two deployment scenarios for usage reporting for sponsored data
connectivity. The Sponsor Identifier and Application Service Provider
Identifier are provided for sponsored services to the PCF from the AF over the
Rx/N5 interface.
In the first scenario the PCF assigns a service specific Charging Key for a
sponsored IP flow. The Charging key is used by the SMF to generate separate
accounting records for offline charging and and/or usage data records for
online charging for the sponsored flows. Correlation of accounting records and
usage data records from multiple users per sponsor and/or application service
provider is then performed using the charging key.
In a second scenario the Sponsor Identifier and Application Service Provider
Identity is included in PCC rules from the PCF to the SMF as defined in clause
6.3.1. For this scenario the same Charging Key may be used both for IP flows
that are sponsored and for flows that are not sponsored. Accounting records
generated by the SMF for offline charging include the Sponsor Identity and the
Application Service Provider Identity. Correlation of accounting records from
multiple users per sponsor and/or application service provider can then be
based on Sponsor Identity and Application Service Provider Identity instead of
the Charging Key. Usage reporting for online charging including Sponsor
Identity and Application Service Provider Identity has not been specified in
this release of the specification. PCC rules that include a Sponsor Identity
and an Application Service Provider Identity should include a Charging Method
that indicates offline charging.
