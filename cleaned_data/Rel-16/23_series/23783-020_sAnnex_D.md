# 1 Scope
This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support the Mission Critical Data (MCData)
services. MCData is a suite of services which utilizes the common functional
architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] to support MC services over LTE
including the common services core.
MCData services suite consists of the following sub-services:
\- short data service (SDS);
\- file distribution (FD.
MCData features include:
\- conversation management;
\- transmission and reception control;
\- communication release; and
\- enhanced status.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.282 [3] and
3GPP TS 22.280 [2].
The present document is applicable primarily to MCData service using E-UTRAN
access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [4]. Certain
application functions of the MCData service could also be supported via
non-3GPP access networks but no additional functionality is specified to
support non-3GPP access.
The MCData service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.

# 4 Introduction
The MCData service suite provides a set of generic capabilities and specific
services to enable one-to-one and group data communications between MCData
users.
The MCData architecture utilises the common functional architecture to support
mission critical services over LTE defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] and aspects
of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6], the Proximity-based
Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [8], the Security of the Mission Critical Service in 3GPP TS 33.180
[13] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.237 [9] to
enable support of the MCData service.
The MCData UE primarily obtains access to the MCData service via E-UTRAN,
using the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [4]. Certain application
functions of MCData service can be accessed using MCData UEs via non-3GPP
access networks.
The MCData system provides the function to support interworking with LMR
systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [18].
# 5 Architectural requirements
## 5.1 Transmission control
The MCData service supports the ability to transmit SDS messages automatically
towards the selected recipient user (private communication) or affiliated
members of the selected MCData group. The MCData server may still reject the
sent message (e.g. if there is no authority to send).
For MCData types other than SDS, the MCData service invokes a transmission
request grant approach before data is permitted to be transmitted. The MCData
service provides a configurable limit for the maximum amount of data for FD or
time for streamed data that an MCData user can transmit in a single request,
which may be configured by the MCData administrator.
Editor\'s note: Additional criteria such as frequency of transmission,
category/type of data, etc., for transmission control arbitration is FFS.
For congestion control, related to transmission requests, the MCData service
may perform the following:
\- reject the data transmission requests and then shall notify the MCData user
of the rejection;
\- queue the data transmission requests; or
\- at any time, withhold the permission to transmit data automatically.
The MCData service shall notify the transmitting MCData group member if there
are no other MCData group members affiliated to the MCData group.
## 5.2 Reception control
The MCData service shall support the ability to receive small amounts of data
automatically. The MCData service may store data waiting for delivery in a
temporary store, and notify availability to the receiving MCData users. The
data which is temporarily stored may be configured with \"time to live\"
value, and subsequently, the data may be purged from the temporary store upon
expiry of \"time to live\".
The recipient individual user (private communication) or affiliated members of
the MCData group(s) shall be notified of the list of available data either on
request or periodically.
The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for the MCData user to select
data to be downloaded from the list corresponding to the temporary store,
subject to limitations such as expiry time and size.
The MCData service shall support the ability to automatically deliver files
with a size less than a configured threshold value (i.e. auto-receive). The
data size for auto-receive shall be configured by the MCData administrator.
## 5.3 Short Data Service capability
The MCData service shall support SDS capability for one-to-one and group
communications.
The SDS capability shall support messages with a maximum payload of at least
1000 bytes. The supported message types shall include text, binary, or
hyperlinks. Multiple message types may be interleaved within in a single
message payload. The payload shall support inclusion of location information
of the sending MCData user, with or without user or application provided data.
The MCData service shall support messages to be sent over the signalling plane
or the media plane.
The SDS capability shall allow for multiple related messages to be correlated
and sequenced within the MCData service.
The MCData user shall be able to selectively request read and delivery receipt
indication for the sent messages. The message delivery history information
should be made available to an authorized MCData user.
## 5.4 File distribution capability
The MCData service shall support distribution of files for one-to-one and
group communications.
The MCData service shall allow the MCData user to send a file or a URL of a
file to another MCData user. The source of the file can originate either from
an MCData client or from a network functional entity. The generated URL shall
be a reference to a stored file to allow for subsequent retrieval. The file
storage policy may determine the availability of the file to be retrieved, and
is subject to expiry time and size limitations.
When the file delivery request is set by the sending user to mandatory
download, the MCData service shall proceed to deliver the file to the
recipient when possible. The file distribution mechanisms shall support both
unicast and broadcast delivery methods.
Editor\'s note: Requirements for automatic re-try mechanisms and maximum retry
count is FFS.
The MCData service shall support aggregation of download completion and
disposition notification reports when files are distributed to multiple
recipients.
NOTE: Requirements for repairing the lost data from MBMS transmission for file
distribution are not addressed in the present document.
## 5.5 Data streaming capability
The MCData service shall support data streaming capability for one-to-one and
group communications.
The MCData service shall allow the MCData user to send a data stream or a URL
of a data stream to another MCData user. The source of the data stream can
originate either from an MCData client or from a network functional entity.
For a data stream originating at a network functional entity, the data stream
may be provided by an MCData user. The data streaming mechanisms shall support
both unicast and broadcast delivery methods.
Editor\'s note: The minimum bitrate support for data streaming is FFS.
When the data streaming request is set to automatic reception, the MCData
service shall not require consent from the receiving MCData user.
The MCData user shall be able to apply controls (i.e. start, stop, cancel) to
the streams, and on a per recipient basis.
Editor\'s note: The applicability of pause and resume controls to one-to-one
communication is FFS
The stream shall be terminated through an explicit user control (i.e. stop,
cancel operation) or by reaching the end of the streamed content.
## 5.6 MCData group affiliation and MCData group de-affiliation
MCData groups may be configured with one or more MCData sub-services (e.g.
SDS, FD, DS) as specified within the MCData service. When an MCData user
affiliates to an MCData group, the MCData user is affiliated to each of those
MCData sub-services configured in the MCData group. The list of MCData sub-
services configured for an MCData group shall be included in the MCData group
configuration data.
MCData group affiliation shall be as specified in clause 5.2.5 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [5]. In addition, the following requirements shall be fulfilled by the
MCData service for MCData users affiliated to MCData groups:
\- MCData users receive notifications for participating in MCData sub-services
and invitations for their affiliated MCData group(s).
\- MCData users select an affiliated MCData group to initiate a new message,
file distribution, data stream, etc.
\- MCData users receive messages, files, data streams, enhanced status
updates, etc, from their affiliated MCData group(s).
## 5.7 Conversation management
The conversation management:
1\. shall include a service indication for conversation management in each SDS
and FD transaction.
2\. may be comprised of SDS transactions or FD transactions or a combination
of both.
3\. shall include a conversation identifier in each SDS and FD transaction.
4\. shall treat conversation between different set of users (either in one-to-
one or group) as a separate conversation.
5\. shall treat conversation between the same set of users (either in one-to-
one or group), but with a different conversation identifier as a separate
conversation.
## 5.8 Bearer management
### 5.8.1 General
The MCData UE shall use the APNs as defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 and table
A.6-1 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]. The MCData UE shall use the MC services APN as
defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 and table A.6-1 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] for the
SIP-1 reference point.
### 5.8.2 EPS bearer considerations
The EPS bearer considerations specified in subclause 5.2.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.280
[5] shall apply.
### 5.8.3 EPS unicast bearer considerations for MCData
For an MCData session request, resources shall be requested utilising
interaction with dynamic PCC. The MCData system shall request resources over
Rx to a PCRF. The dedicated bearer for MCData media shall utilise the QCI
value of 70 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [14]). The request of resources
over Rx shall include an application identifier for MCData in order for the
PCRF to evaluate the correct QCI.
The UE is required to support at minimum one UM bearer, which is used for
MCData (see annex A in 3GPP TS 36.331 [15]).
### 5.8.4 MBMS bearer management
The MBMS bearer management for MC services is specified in subclause 5.2.7.1
of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
## 5.9 Disposition
Disposition requests and notifications can be sent \"in-band\" using the same
mechanism used for transport of the data, or can be sent \"out-of-band\" when
the mechanism used for transport of the data is no longer available.
For standalone SDS and FD, the MCData UE shall use the signalling plane for
disposition request and disposition notifications. For session SDS, the MCData
UE shall use:
\- the media plane for disposition request and disposition notifications; and
\- the signalling plane for disposition notifications when the media plane is
no longer available.
5A Involved business relationships
The description of the involved business relationships for the MCData service
is contained in clause 6 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
# 6 Functional model
## 6.1 General
This clause defines the functional model for MCData service.
The security solution for the MCData service, including end-to-end encryption,
is specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [13].
## 6.2 Description of the planes
The functional model for the support of MCData is defined as a series of
planes to allow for the breakdown of the architectural description.
The description of the planes and the relationship between the planes are
contained in the common functional architecture to support MC services in 3GPP
TS 23.280 [5].
## 6.3 Transmission and reception control aspects
### 6.3.1 General
The transmission and reception control are functions of the MCData server.
For small data transmissions there is no need for prior grant of request to
transmit. The procedures in the present document describe when data is
automatically sent.
For large data transmissions, i.e. large files, the data is transmitted only
after request to transmit is granted. The data to be transmitted and/or
received may be stored in a data repository associated with the transmission
and reception control functions.
NOTE: An overview of transmission control process and possible arbitration
mechanisms is provided in the Annex B.
## 6.4 Generic functional model
### 6.4.1 On-network functional model
Figure 6.4.1-1 shows the generic application plane functional model.
Figure 6.4.1-1: Generic application plane functional model
In the model shown in figure 6.4.1-1, capability functions (SDS, FD, DS) of
the MCData client and the MCData server along with their reference points
(MCData-cap-1 to MCData-cap-n) are described in the respective functional
models for each capability.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS if the \"media storage function\" and \"MCData
message store\" could be converged into one in the architecture diagram use a
set of reference points to support them.
NOTE: The security aspects of new network components (MCData message store and
Message store client) and its two new reference points are the responsibility
of SA3 and thus outside the scope of the present document.
### 6.4.2 Off-network functional model
### 6.4.3 Functional entities description
Editor\'s note: Combining functional models describing each capability into
one functional model is FFS.
#### 6.4.3.1 Application plane
##### 6.4.3.1.1 MCData client
The MCData client functional entity acts as the user agent for all MCData
application transactions. The client supports SDS, file distribution, data
streaming and IP connectivity MCData capabilities utilized by MCData services
like conversation management, robots control, enhanced status, database
enquiries and secured internet.
##### 6.4.3.1.2 MCData server
The MCData server functional entity provides centralised support for MCData
services suite. Conversation management, robots, enhanced status, database
enquiries and secured internet MCData services requiring one-to-one or group
data communication are realized using SDS, file distribution, data streaming
and IP connectivity MCData communication capabilities.
All the MCData clients supporting users belonging to a single group are
required to use the same MCData server for that group. An MCData client
supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have relationships with
multiple MCData servers.
The MCData server functional entity represents a specific instantiation of the
GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [8] to control multicast and unicast
operations for group communications.
The MCData server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS functional
entity of the signalling control plane.
The MCData server shall support the controlling role and the participating
role. The MCData server may perform the controlling role for one-to-one and
group data communication. The MCData server performing the controlling role
for a one-to-one or group data communication may also perform a participating
role for the same one-to-one or group data communication. For each one-to-one
and group data communication, there shall be only one MCData server assuming
the controlling role, while one or more MCData servers in participating role
may be involved.
The MCData server performing the controlling role is responsible for:
\- handling transmission and reception control (e.g. policy enforcement for
participation in the MCData group communication) towards all the MCData users
of the one-to-one and group data communication;
\- interfacing with the group management server for group policy and
affiliation status information of this MCData server\'s served affiliated
users; and
\- managing SDS and FD data distribution during MCData group communication.
The MCData server performing the participating role is responsible for:
\- handling transmission control (e.g. authorization for participation in the
MCData group communication) to MCData users of the one-to-one and group data
communication;
\- group affiliation support for MCData user, including enforcement of maximum
Nc2 number of simultaneous group affiliations by a user;
\- interfacing with the group management server for group policy and
affiliation status information of this MCData server\'s served affiliated
users;
\- relaying the MCData communication messages between the MCData client and
the MCData server performing the controlling role; and
\- handling reception control (e.g. temporarily storing the data to present to
the MCData user as required) to its MCData users of the one-to-one and group
data communication.
NOTE: The MCData server in the controlling role and the MCData server in the
participating role can belong to the same MCData system.
##### 6.4.3.1.3 MCData user database
This functional entity contains information of the MCData user profile
associated with an MCData ID that is held by the MCData service provider at
the application plane. The MCData user profile is determined by the mission
critical organization, the MCData service provider, and potentially the MCData
user.
##### 6.4.3.1.4 Interworking function to LMR system
The functional entity is specified in 3GPP TS 23.283 [18].
#### 6.4.3.2 Signalling control plane
The description of the signalling control plane is contained in the common
functional architecture to support MC services as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280
[5].
#### 6.4.3.3 MCData message store
The MCData message store is a network base persistent store that allows
Mission Critical Organization to configure their MCData service users to
permanently store their MCData communications. Once configured a MCData
service user will be allocated a secured storage area (i.e. size) in the
MCData message store that is only accessible by that configured MCData service
user and any authorized users. The MCData service user can manage how and what
will be stored in his personal message store with the support of management
operations such as creating, deleting and merging folders, moving stored
messages and files around and synchronization all used devices to provide the
same contxt view etc.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS if the MCData message store can also be used to
store \"group\" and \"organizational\" specific information.
NOTE: The security aspects of access and management (such as
read/write/update/sync etc.) of personal message store are the responsibility
of SA3 and thus outside the scope of the present document.
#### 6.4.3.4 Message store client
The Message store client is used to support MCData client to manage the MCData
communication history stored in MCData message store for a particular MCData
service user, It supports the secure access to a MCData service user\'s
configured MCData message store area and operations relevant to the stored
communication history such as folders management and synchronization to the
device local message store.
### 6.4.4 Reference points
#### 6.4.4.1 Application plane
##### 6.4.4.1.1 General
The reference points for the application plane of MCData service are described
in the following subclauses.
##### 6.4.4.1.2 Reference point MCData-2 (between the MCData server and the
MCData user database)
The MCData-2 reference point, which exists between the MCData server and the
MCData user database, is used by the MCData server to obtain information about
a specific user. The MCData-2 reference point utilises a diameter management
application protocol as defined in 3GPP TS 29.283 [12] and shall be intra-
network.
##### 6.4.4.1.3 Reference point MCData-3 (between the MCData server and the
MCData server)
The MCData-3 reference point, which exists between the MCData server and the
MCData server for MCData application signalling for establishing MCData
sessions, shall use the SIP-2 reference point for transport and routing of
signalling. If each MCData server is served by a different SIP core then the
MCData-3 reference point shall also use the SIP-3 reference point for
transport and routing of signalling. Media is also transferred using the
MCData-3 reference point.
##### 6.4.4.1.3A Reference point MCData-5 (between the MCData capability
function and the EPS)
The MCData-5 reference point, which exists between the MCData capability
function and the EPS, is used, subject to the conditions below, by the MCData
capability function of the MCData server to obtain unicast bearers with
appropriate QoS from the EPS. It utilises the Rx interface of the EPS
according to 3GPP TS 23.203 [14].
MCData-5 is not used when the MCData service provider and the PLMN operator do
not have an operational agreement for QoS control to be provided directly from
the MCData service provider domain.
MCData-5 may be used when the MCData service provider and the PLMN operator
have an operational agreement where QoS control is provided directly from the
MCData service provider domain.
NOTE: Any coordination between the P-CSCF use of Rx and the MCData server use
of Rx (via MCData-5) from the MCData service provider domain is not specified
in this release of this specification.
##### 6.4.4.1.4 Reference point MCData-6 (between the MCData server and the
EPS)
The MCData-6 reference point, which exists between the MCData server and the
EPS, is used to request the allocation and activation of multicast transport
resources for MCData application usage. The MCData-6 reference point uses the
MB2-C interface as defined in 3GPP TS 29.468 [16].
##### 6.4.4.1.5 Reference point IWF-2 (between the interworking function to
LMR system and the MCData server)
The IWF‑2 reference point is specified in 3GPP TS 23.283 [18].
##### 6.4.4.1.6 Reference point MCData-7 (between the Message store client and
MCData message store)
The MCData-7 reference point, which exists between the Message store client
and the MCData message store, is used by the Message store client to manage
the information stored in the MCData message store and synchronization between
the MCData client and the MCData message store.
##### 6.4.4.1.7 Reference point MCData-8 (between the MCData message store and
McData server)
The MCData-8 reference point, which exists between the MCData server and the
MCData message store, is used by the MCData server to access and manage the
MCData message store such as creating MCData user folders and depositing the
communications history.
## 6.5 Functional model for short data service
### 6.5.1 On-network functional model
Figure 6.5.1-1 shows the application plane functional model for SDS.
Figure 6.5.1-1: Application plane functional model for SDS
In the model shown in figure 6.5.1-1, the following apply:
\- MCData-SDS-1 reference point is used for uplink and downlink unicast SDS
data transaction over signalling control plane by the SDS distribution
function of the MCData server and SDS function of the MCData client. This
reference point is also used for MCData application signalling during session
establishment in support of SDS data transfer.
\- MCData-SDS-2 reference point carries uplink and downlink unicast SDS data
over media plane between the SDS distribution function of the MCData server
and the SDS function of the MCData client.
\- MCData-SDS-3 reference point carries downlink multicast SDS data over media
plane from the SDS distribution function of the MCData server to the SDS
function of the MCData client.
Examples of SDS data (in the form of text, binary, application data, URL or
combinations of these) are:
\- information pertaining to applications e.g. health parameters of MCData
user for situational awareness application;
\- information pertaining to enhanced status service;
\- text or URL data between MCData users;
\- application data (e.g. health parameters) to the MCData user;
\- location information (independent or along with user or application

\- MCData-FD-1 reference point is used for MCData application signalling for
establishing a session in support of MCData file distribution. The bearer is
also used for both uplink and downlink unicast data (e.g., URL associated to
file, file download completed report).
\- MCData-FD-2 reference point carries uplink and downlink unicast file data
between the FD functions of the MCData server and the MCData UE.
\- MCData-FD-3 reference point carries downlink multicast file data from the
FD function of the MCData server to the FD function of the MCData UE.
\- MCData-FD-4 reference point carries uplink and downlink unicast file data
between the media storage function of the MCData Content server and the media
storage client of the MCData UE.
\- MCData-FD-5 reference point supports the MCData server to access the stored
files in the MCData content server for certain file distribution functions,
such as retrieval a file to be distributed through multicast etc. This
reference points also supports any necessary operational requirements.
NOTE: The security aspects of MCData-FD-5 reference point are the
responsibility of SA3 and thus outside the scope of the present document.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS on what the operational requirements (such as QoS
control of file upload and download) are needed to be supported by this
reference point.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS if the name of \"MCData-FD-5\" reference point
should be renamed to use a different number (such as MCData-FD-9) to avoid
conflicting with the existing MCData base reference points (MCData-1, MCData-2
...) in numbering.
\- MCData content server is a repository area in the MCData trust domain that
allows authorized MCData service user to temporarily store files that are
intended to share to other MCData service users. It provides common pool of
storage area (i.e. size) to all authorized MCData service users to use, no
personal space is allocated. An authorized MCData service user can use the
supported operations on the defined reference point to upload shared files and
download the files that are shared to him. The MCData server will use the
defined reference point to access the files stored in the MCData content
server and support the necessary operational supports. As part of the file
life cycle management the temporarily stored files will be removed
peoridically based on the Mission Critical service provider policy.
NOTE: The security aspects of MCData content server and its operational
supports are the responsibility of SA3 and thus outside the scope of the
present document.

#### 7.4.3.3 One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling control
plane
##### 7.4.3.3.1 General
This subclause describes the detailed procedures for the scenario where SDS
data is to be sent to MCData user in off-network.
##### 7.4.3.3.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.3.3.2-1 describes procedures for an off-network MCData client 1
initiating one-to-one MCData data communication for sending standalone SDS
data to other MCData client, with or without disposition request. Standalone
refers to sending unidirectional data in one transaction. The SDS data size is
assumed to be pre-configured.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user 1 has initiated communication for sending standalone SDS data
to other MCData user 2.
2\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are members of the same ProSe
Discovery group and are ProSe 1:1 direct communication capable.
3\. MCData client 1 has discovered MCData client 2 in proximity, associated
with MCData user B, using ProSe Discovery procedures.
Figure 7.4.3.3.2-1: One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling
control plane
1\. MCData client 1 checks whether the MCData user 1 is authorized to send
MCData standalone data request.
2\. If MCData user 1 is authorised MCData client 1 sends a MCData standalone
data request towards the MCData client 2. The MCData standalone data request
contains conversation identifier for message thread indication. The MCData
standalone data request may contain disposition request if indicated by the
user at MCData client 1.
3\. On receiving a MCData standalone data request, the MCData client 2 checks
whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or
content to certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege.
4\. If the policy assertion is positive and the payload is for MCData user
consumption (e.g. is not application data, is not command instructions, etc.)
then the MCData user of MCData client 2 may be notified. Otherwise if the
payload is not for MCData user consumption, then the MCData user of MCData
client 2 shall not be notified. The action taken when the payload contains
application data or command instructions are specific based on the contents of
the payload. Payload content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to
a known local non-MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the
MCData client 2 to start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start
application) and shall pass the payload content to the just started
application.
NOTE: If the policy assertion was negative, the MCData client 2 sends an
appropriate notification to MCData client 1.
5\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report.
#### 7.4.3.4 Group standalone short data service using signalling control
plane
##### 7.4.3.4.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone SDS to a selected group results in off-
network MCData group members receiving the SDS data.
##### 7.4.3.4.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.3.4.2-1 describes procedures for an off-network MCData client 1
initiating group MCData data communication for sending SDS data to a MCData
group, with or without disposition request. The SDS data size limit is pre-
configured.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user 1 has initiated group communication for sending SDS data to
the MCData group.
2\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCData
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCData
client 1.
3\. MCData client 1 to MCData client N are members of the same MCData group.
Figure 7.4.3.4.2-1: Group standalone short data service using signalling
control plane
1\. MCData client 1 checks whether the MCData user 1 is authorized to send
MCData group standalone data request.
2\. If MCData user 1 is authorised MCData client 1 sends a MCData group
standalone data request towards the MCData group. The MCData group standalone
data request contains conversation identifier for message thread indication.
The MCData group standalone data request may contain disposition request if
indicated by the user at MCData client 1. If MCData group standalone data
request contains disposition request, MCData group standalone data request
shall also contain the IP address of the MCData client 1.
3\. On receiving a MCData group standalone data request, the MCData clients
check whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message
or content to certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege.
4\. If the policy assertion is positive and the payload is for MCData user
consumption (e.g. is not application data, is not command instructions, etc.)
then the MCData user may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for
MCData user consumption, then the MCData user shall not be notified. The
action taken when the payload contains application data or command
instructions are specific based on the contents of the payload. Payload
content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to a known local non-
MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the MCData client 2 to
start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start application) and
shall pass the payload content to the just started application.
NOTE: If the policy assertion was negative, the MCData client sends an
appropriate notification to MCData client 1.
5\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData clients initiate a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report.

multiple MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified by MCData
group ID) and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData group standalone FD request towards the
MCData server. The MCData group standalone FD request may contain the file
metadata information. The MCData group standalone data request contains target
recipient(s) as selected by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData group
standalone FD request contains conversation identifier for message thread
indication. MCData group standalone FD request may contain mandatory download
indication. The MCData group standalone FD request may contain download
completed report indication if selected by the user at MCData client 1.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData group standalone FD request. The MCData server
resolves the MCData group ID to determine the members of that group and their
affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server.
4\. The MCData server also applies transmission and reception control and the
necessary policy to ensure that appropriate data is transmitted between the
MCData UEs.
5\. MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone FD request towards
each MCData user determined in step 3.
6\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n notifies the user about the incoming
MCData group standalone FD request (including file metadata if present) which
may be either accepted or rejected or ignored. If the request includes
mandatory download indication in the MCData group standalone FD request an
accepted response is assumed.
7\. If the target MCData user on MCData clients 2 to n provides a response
(accept or reject) to the notification, then the respective MCData client
sends the MCData group standalone FD response to the MCData server. MCData
client 2 to n automatically sends accepted MCData group standalone FD response
when the incoming request included mandatory download indication.
8\. MCData server forwards the MCData group standalone FD response to the
MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 9
depending on the conditions to proceed with the file transmission.
9\. MCData client 1 and MCData server have successfully established media
plane for file transmission and the MCData client 1 transmits the file data.
10\. MCData server distributes the file received from MCData client 1 to
MCData clients 2 to n over the established media plane. Distribution of file
can be via unicast or via MBMS bearer(s). For distribution via MBMS bearer(s),
the procedure described in subclause 7.3 Use of MBMS transmission (on-network)
is executed. File download report is shared by the receiving MCData clients,
if requested by the user at MCData client 1\. After file transaction is
completed, the media plane is released.
NOTE 2: MCData server is not required to wait for the complete download of
file from MCData client 1 prior to initiating file distribution to MCData
client 2.
11\. The MCData clients successfully receiving the file, records file download
completed and notifies MCData user.
12\. MCData client 2 initiates a MCData download completed report for
reporting file download completed, if requested by the user at MCData client
1.
13\. The MCData file download completed report from MCData client(s) may be
stored by the MCData server for download history interrogation from the
authorized MCData users. The MCData file download completed report from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
14\. Aggregated or individual MCData file download completed report is sent to
the disposition requesting user at MCData client 1.

#### 7.8.2.2 One-to-one conversation management
##### 7.8.2.2.1 Procedure
The procedure for an MCData user to associate multiple MCData transmissions
between a pair of users for a given activity is illustrated in figure
7.8.2.2.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user(s) on MCData client 1 and 2 are registered for receiving
MCData service.
Figure 7.8.2.2.1-1: One-to-one conversation management
1\. The user at MCData client 1 initiates conversation. A universally unique
conversation identifier is generated to identify new conversation.
Conversation identifier is used in procedures mentioned in step 2. If the
intent of the user at MCData client 1 is to transmit within an existing
conversation, then corresponding conversation identifier is used in procedures
mentioned in step 2. To allow multiple parallel conversations for the same
pair of users, different conversation identifier is used for each
conversation. The MCData users can view the MCData conversation at any time
after the first MCData transaction is initiated within the conversation.

these procedures can be executed.
#### 7.8.2.3 Group conversation management
##### 7.8.2.3.1 Procedure
The procedure for an MCData user to associate multiple MCData transmissions
between users of a group for a given activity is illustrated in figure
7.8.2.3.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user(s) on MCData client 1, 2, and n are registered for receiving
MCData service.
2\. The MCData users 1, 2 and n are members of the same MCData group and
affiliated to the MCData service.
Figure 7.8.2.3.1-1: Group conversation management
1\. The user at MCData client 1 initiates conversation. A unique conversation
identifier is generated to identify new conversation. Conversation identifier
is used in procedures mentioned in step 2. If the intent of the user at MCData
client 1 is to transmit within an existing conversation, then corresponding
conversation identifier is used in procedures mentioned in step 2. To allow
multiple parallel conversations for the same group of users, different
conversation identifier is used for each conversation. The MCData users can
view the MCData conversation at any time after the first MCData transaction is
initiated within the conversation.
2\. The procedure of group SDS or group FD or combination of both these
procedures can be executed.
### 7.8.3 Conversation management for off-network
#### 7.8.3.1 One-to-one conversation management

## 7.9 Enhanced status
### 7.9.1 General
Enhanced status corresponds to information specific to the activities
performed by the mission critical service users during their operation(s) e.g.
available, in operation on site, going to the operation site, or just arrived.
### 7.9.2 Preset values for enhanced status
The enhanced status information i.e. the set of possible values corresponding
to the activities of the MCData user, shall be configured by the MCData
administrator. The configuration of status values is applicable on a per-group
basis, and therefore shall be part of the MCData group configuration data as
described in Annex A.4.
The configuration mechanism shall allow the MCData administrator to configure
a minimum of 32 possible values and allow up to 65536 separate values. The set
of values may be divided into a fixed set of values defined by 3GPP standards
which are common across all MCData systems, and a set which may be freely
configured for any purpose.
### 7.9.3 Enhanced status for on-network
#### 7.9.3.1 Sharing enhanced status information
##### 7.9.3.1.1 Procedure
The procedure for an MCData user to share the enhanced status information to
the members of the selected group is illustrated in figure 7.9.3.1.1-1.
Pre-conditions:

to be shared from the list of pre-configured status values available for the
MCData group.
2\. The procedure of off-network group standalone SDS using signalling control
plane as described in subclause 7.4.3.3, is used to deliver the enhanced
status information.
3\. The MCData users at MCData client 2 and n are notified of the enhanced
status information.
## 7.10 MCData emergency alert (on-network and off-network)
The MCData service shall support the procedures and related information flows
as specified in subclause 10.10 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] with the following
clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCData client;
\- The MC service server is the MCData server;
\- The MC service group ID is the MCData Group ID; and
\- The MC service user profile index is the MCData user profile index.
## 7.11 User authentication and authorization for MCData service
NOTE: Flow 7.11-1 is a high level user authentication and authorization flow.
3GPP TS 33.180 [13] defines the specific user authentication and authorization
architecture required by the MCData service in order to realize the MCData
user authentication and authorization requirements as defined in 3GPP TS
22.280 [2].
A procedure for user authentication is illustrated in figure 7.11-1. The user
authentication is performed based on the procedure specified in subclause 10.6
of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
Figure 7.11-1: MCData user authentication and registration, single domain
1\. The user authentication is performed as per the general user
authentication procedure specified in subclause 10.6 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
2\. MCData client performs the MCData service authorization for the user. Step
2 utilizes the results of step 1.
## 7.12 MCData resource management (on-network)
### 7.12.1 General
Procedures for resource management are defined in subclause 10.x of 3GPP TS
23.280 [5].
### 7.12.2 MCData services not handled by SIP core
MCData services that do not utilize the SIP core e.g. IP connectivity, cannot
utilize the resource control functionality of the local outbound / inbound
proxy. For these types of service, resource management is handled directly by
the Rx interface from the MCData server to the PCRF, which is the MCData-5
reference point. The Rx interface is defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [17].
The same types of resource management procedures as defined for SIP based
services in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] may also be applied for non SIP based services.
That is:
\- Request for unicast resources at session establishment (in this case
service initiation);
\- Request for modification of unicast resources; and
\- Request for resources with shared priority.
###### ## Annex A (normative): MCData related configuration data
# A.1 General
This Annex provides information about the static data needed for configuration
for the MCData service, which belongs to one of the following categories:
\- MCData UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);
\- MCData user profile configuration data (see subclause A.3);
\- MCData related group configuration data (see subclause A.4); and
\- MCData service configuration data (see subclause A.5).
For each configuration category, data is split between configuration data that
is applicable to both on network and off network, configuration data that is
applicable to on-network only, and configuration data that is applicable to
off-network only. The configuration data in each configuration category
corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCData UE,
MCData group, MCData user and MCData service configuration data refers to the
information that will be stored against each MCData UE, MCData group, MCData
user and MCData service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network
and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration
category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data
category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.282
[3] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] or the corresponding subclause from either the
present document or the referenced document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter
in the configuration hierarchy.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Parameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy
that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the
configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-
network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within
the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character
\">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level.
Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\"
character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child
parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\"
character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child
parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child
parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they
are just containers for their child parameters.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MCData UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# A.2 MCData UE configuration data
The general aspects of UE configuration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
Data in tables A.2-1 and A.2-2 have to be known by the MCData UE after MCData
authorization.
Data in table A.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference
point. Table A.2-1 contains the UE configuration required to support the use
of off-network MCData service.

# A.3 MCData user profile configuration data
The general aspects of MC service user profile configuration data are
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]. The MCData user profile configuration data is
stored in the MCData user database. The MCData server obtains the MCData user
profile configuration data from the MCData user database (MCData-2).
Tables A.3-1 and A.3-2 contain the MCData user profile configuration required
to support the use of on-network MCData service. Tables A.3-1 and A.3-3
contain the MCData user profile configuration required to support the use of
off-network MCData service. Data in table A.3-1 and A.3-3 can be configured
offline using the CSC-11 reference point.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Transmission control for MCData
# B.1 Overview of transmission control process
The MCData server may receive several simultaneous requests for data
transmission, which may be associated with different types of communication
e.g. group, private, 1-to-many. For each communication, the how the requests
are processed may be different. The requests that are not authorized shall be
rejected by the transmission control function. For auto-send requests, the
processing should be immediate and is delivered to the recipients either via
unicast or broadcast. However, for requests exceeding the auto-send limits,
transmission control arbitration (see Annex B.2) will be necessary. Subsequent
to transmission control arbitration, and subject to the policy e.g. store and
forward, the data is either delivered directly to the recipient MCData user,
or stored in the network repository and a corresponding URL is delivered. The
end-to-end transmission control process is illustrated in figure B.1-1.
Editor\'s note: The aspects related to data streaming and accuracy of the
process is FFS.
Figure B.1-1: Transmission control process
# B.2 Transmission control arbitration
The transmission control arbitration is a central function of transmission
control process. In a typical deployment, multiple or simultaneous requests
can be received at the transmission control arbitration function. Each of
these requests may be categorized into different request types with different
queuing priorities, and therefore each request type will be maintained with
separate queues. Each request shall not be present in more than one queue at
any given time. The queue types and the order of queues may be configured by
the MCData administrator, as described below.
  * Transmission control queue: It is the primary queue from which the > request is processed for transmission e.g. emergency communication > requests may result in this queue and processed at the highest > priority.
  * Communication type queue: This queue may be sorted in the order of > the communication type associated with the request. For example, > the group communication requests may always take precedence over > one-to-many or private communication requests.
  * Static attribute queue: This queue may be formed based on the static > attributes associated with the request e.g. group priority, user > priority, which may be pre-configured by the MCData administrator.
  * Dynamic attribute queue: This queue may be formed based on the > dynamic attributes associated with the request e.g. location of > the sending user, content size, etc.
Editor\'s note: The queue categories and the order of the queues is FFS.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Secure IP connectivity requirements
This annex contains a description of how mission critical organisation may use
existing 3GPP solutions to provide a data connection at a fixed defined
quality of service level.
Editor\'s note: For R14 there is no normative work for MCData secure IP
connectivity. Further study in R15 will investigate how to complete compliance
with the stage 1 requirements including incoming setup to a UE, UE to UE
connection and MCData service control of access.
An MCData service IP data access APN is configured to provide connectivity to
reach the required PDN within the MC service provider\'s control with a
defined level of quality of service as defined by QCI and ARP. In some
instances, the use of the APN will be sufficient to provide the required
security for the connection. If that is not the case, the MC service provider
may use available techniques to further secure parts of the connection through
the EPC.
The MCData UE is configured with security policy to identify which IP data
traffic is required to use the MCData service IP data access APN.
When the MCData UE requires to access an application to be used with the
additional level of security, the local application within the MCData UE
commences access. If the policy allows use of the MCData service IP data
access APN, then the MCData UE establishes connection to the required end
point via the PDN provided for the MC service IP data access.
End to end security is established as required by the local application in the
UE and the remote application in the network.
