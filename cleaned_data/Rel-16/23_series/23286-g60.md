specific layer. The V2X application layer functional model utilizes the SEAL
services as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].
The VAE server is located in the VAE layer. The SEAL services utilized by VAE
layer are location management, group management, configuration management,
identity management, key management and network resource management. The V2X
application specific layer consists of the V2X application specific
functionalities.
NOTE 1: The functionalities of the V2X application specific layer are out of
scope of the present document.
The V2X application server consists of the VAE server, the SEAL servers and
the V2X application specific server. The VAE server provides the V2X
application layer support functions to the V2X application specific server
over Vs reference point.
The V2X UEs consist of the VAE client, the SEAL clients and the V2X
application specific client. The VAE client provides the V2X application layer
support functions to the V2X application specific client over Vc reference
point.
NOTE 2: In some deployments, the client and server entities of SEAL can be
part of VAE client and VAE server respectively.
The VAE client acts as a VAL client for its interaction with the SEAL clients
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6]. The VAE server acts as a VAL server for
its interaction with the SEAL servers as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].
In the VAE layer, the VAE client communicates with the VAE server over V1-AE
reference point. In the V2X application specific layer, the V2X application
specific client communicates with V2X application specific server over V1-APP
reference point.

over the SEAL-S reference point specified for each SEAL service. The
interaction between the SEAL clients is supported by SEAL-PC5 reference point
specified for each SEAL service. The interaction between a SEAL client and the
corresponding SEAL server is supported by SEAL-UU reference point specified
for each SEAL service.
NOTE 5: The SEAL-C, SEAL-S, SEAL-PC5, SEAL-UU reference points for each SEAL
service is specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].
To support distributed VAE server deployments, the VAE server interacts with
another VAE server over VAE-E reference point.
V2X UE1 can also act as a UE-to-network relay,
\- to enable VAE client on V2X UE2 to access VAE server over V1-AE reference
point; and
\- to enable V2X application specific client on V2X UE2 to access V2X
application specific server over V1-APP reference point.

capabilities to one or more V2X application specific server. The VAE server
and the V2X application specific server may be co-located in a single physical
entity. The VAE server may be deployed either in the PLMN operator domain or
deployed in the V2X service provider domain. The VAE server connects with the
3GPP network system (EPS) in one or more PLMN operator domain. When VAE server
and V2X application specific server are co-located in a single physical
entity, the Vs reference point between the VAE server and the V2X application
enabler server may not be used.
Figure 7.2.1-1 illustrates a deployment of the VAE server and the V2X
application specific server in a single physical entity and deployed in V2X
service provider domain. The VAE server may be deployed in a separate physical
entity from the V2X application specific server in the V2X service provider
domain. In such deployments, the Vs reference point is used for the
communication between the VAE server and the V2X application specific server.

# 8 Identities
## 8.1 V2X user identity (V2X user ID)
The V2X user ID can be an instance of the VAL user ID as specified in 3GPP TS
23.434 [6]. The V2X user ID is a globally unique identifier within the V2X
service that represents the V2X user. The V2X user ID shall be a URI. The V2X
user ID is used for authentication and authorization purposes for providing
the V2X service towards the V2X user via the V2X UE. The V2X user ID also
indicates the V2X service provider with whom the V2X user has a V2X service
agreement. The V2X user may have V2X service agreement with several V2X
service providers and thus will have obtained unique V2X user ID per V2X
service provider.
Based on the service agreement, each V2X user ID is mapped to a V2X UE ID.
## 8.2 V2X UE identity (V2X UE ID)
The V2X UE ID can be an instance of the VAL UE ID as specified in 3GPP TS
23.434 [6]. The V2X UE ID is a unique identifier within the V2X service that
represents the V2X UE. The V2X UE ID is mapped to an application specific UE
identity (e.g. StationID as specified in ETSI TS 102 894-2 [16], MSISDN). Due
to privacy considerations, the V2X UE ID may be changed. The V2X UE ID is used
to address the V2X UE in order to send V2X messages.
## 8.3 V2X service identity (V2X service ID)
The V2X service ID can be an instance of the VAL service ID as specified in
3GPP TS 23.434 [6]. The V2X service ID is a globally unique identifier that
represents the V2X service. A V2X application server provides a list of V2X
services towards the V2X UE. Each V2X service is uniquely identified by a V2X
service ID, which is an identifier of the V2X application. The V2X service ID
can be used for policy mapping, QoS handling for V2X communication and V2X
message distribution, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [5]. An identifier of a
V2X service, e.g. ITS-AID or PSID specified in ETSI TS 102 965 [17] and ISO TS
17419 [18], can be used as a V2X service ID.
## 8.4 V2X group identity (V2X group ID)
The V2X group ID is a globally unique identifier within the V2X service that
represents a set of V2X users and the corresponding V2X UE. The set of V2X
users may belong to the same or different V2X service provider. It indicates
the V2X application server where the group is defined.
## 8.5 Geographical area identity (GEO ID)
The V2X service provider defined identity of a geographical area. The GEO ID
supports different representations of geographical area (e.g. geo-fence, tile
identifiers). The VAE server maintains the mapping of the GEO ID with the
location corresponding to one or more V2X UE IDs.
The GEO ID may support the format of a URI.

## 9.5 File Distribution
### 9.5.1 General
The VAE capabilities provide support for file distribution to the V2X
application specific layer. The VAE capabilities abstract the aspects like
file chunking, QoE management, file delivery from the V2X application specific
layer.
### 9.5.2 Use of MBMS \"files\" session type
The VAE server acts as a content provider and the VAE client acts as an MBMS
client in the xMB reference model (subclause 4.1 in 3GPP TS 26.348 [11]).
The VAE server makes use of the xMB procedures from 3GPP TS 26.348 [11] to
create MBMS sessions whose type is set to \"files\" and to request the
delivery of files over these sessions. Before provisioning files to the BMâ€‘SC,
the VAE server prepares the file for distribution, which may include partition
of large files into smaller files or encryption.
The VAE server is responsible for translating the parameters related to the
V2X application triggering the file delivery into corresponding xMB
parameters. Table 9.5.2-1 describes the mapping between the V2X parameters and
the xMB API properties specified in 3GPP TS 26.348 [11].

monitoring information notification.
## 9.8 Switching modes of operations for V2V communications
The V2X services need to support different modes of operation for V2V (PC5 and
Uu) communications. The V2X UE makes the decision to switch between different
modes of operation for V2V communications considering the V2V service KPIs as
specified in 3GPP TS 22.186 [3]. The V2X application layer may provide the
network monitoring information to assist the V2X UE in making the switching
decision for the operation modes selection.
The V2X UE determines switching of the mode of operation for V2V sessions
based on several factors including the received network monitoring information
as specified in subclause 9.7 and the PC5 communication quality information.
The V2X UE switches the mode of operation and engages in either direct (PC5)
or indirect (Uu) session as specified in subclause 23.14 of 3GPP TS 36.300
[14].
## 9.9 V2X service discovery

### 9.10.4 Dynamic local service information
#### 9.10.4.1 General
For the V2X scenarios like extended sensors, platooning, the V2X UEs may be
connected to the serving PLMN, but the V2X application server information may
change as per the geographical location. Also it is not practically feasible
to provide all the V2X server USDs to the V2X UE via the initial V2X UE
configuration by the PLMN. It is hence required that the V2X server USDs may
be provided considering the mobility of the V2X UE. This subclause describes
the procedure for obtaining the local service information by the V2X UE via
V1-AE.

1\. The VAE client sends a local service information request to the VAE server
(responsible for geographic location A) which may include mobility information
like the geographic locations (geographic location B).
2\. The VAE server determines the local service information (e.g. V2X server
USD(s), V2X USD) corresponding to the geographic locations information
received in step 1.
3\. The VAE server provides the local service information (e.g. V2X server
USD(s), V2X USD) with the corresponding geographic locations information to
the VAE client via a local service information response. The V2X USD
information consists of TMGI, list of SAIs, frequency and SDP information with
the local service information for local V2X application server discovery. The
details of V2X server USD are specified in subclause 4.4.7.3 in 3GPP TS 23.285
[5]. This message can be sent via unicast or multicast.
4\. Upon receiving the local service information in step 3, the VAE client
stores the received information.
Editor\'s note: The impact of edge application enabler study (FS_EDGEAPP) on
this procedure is FFS.
## 9.11 V2X application resource management
### 9.11.1 General

### 9.11.3 V2X application resource adaptation
#### 9.11.3.1 General
This subclause describes the procedure for V2X application resource adapation
where the VAE server maps the V2X application requirement to network resource
request for single or groups of V2X UEs.
#### 9.11.3.2 Procedure
Figure 9.11.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure where the VAE server supports V2X
application resource adaptation.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAE server has the KPI information for the V2X services.
2\. The VAE server is provided with the network monitoring information as per
the subclause A.3.
3\. The VAE server is configured with the NRM server information.
Figure 9.11.3.2-1: V2X application resource adaptation
1\. The V2X application specific server sends a V2X application requirement
request to the VAE server for an adaptation of the V2X service operation per
V2X UE or per group of UEs.
2\. The VAE server translates the V2X application requirement to different
network resource requirement for group of users, which may be a subset of V2X
UEs within the V2X group that will be affected by application adaptation.
3\. If the V2X application requirement is successfully translated to the
network resource requirement, the VAE server sends a V2X application
requirement response to the V2X application specific server.
4\. The VAE server performs network resource adaptation by interacting with
the NRM server as specified in the 3GPP TS 23.434 [6] for the V2X application
requirement received in step 1.
5\. Based on the result of the network resource adaptation in step 4
corresponding to step 1, the VAE server sends a V2X application requirement
notification to the V2X application specific server.
## 9.12 Dynamic group management
### 9.12.1 General
Some of the V2X scenarios require group-based communication (e.g. platooning).
Unlike V2X communication for safety scenarios where all V2X UEs in the
communication range receive broadcasted communication, the group-based
communication is expected to be received only by the V2X UEs of the members of
that group. However in some scenarios the V2X UEs are required to be
determined dynamically (with the assistance of the V2X application server or
independently by the V2X UEs when they are not connected to the network)
during the operation. Also each V2X application group has to be mapped to a
ProSe Layer-2 group ID in order to avoid any interference during PC5
communications for the V2X application groups. The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID is
only used in PC5 V2X group communication (without the involvement of the V2X
application server).
### 9.12.2 Information flows
#### 9.12.2.1 Push Layer-2 group ID mapping
Table 9.12.2.1-1 describes the information flow push layer-2 group ID mapping

### 9.12.3 On-network dynamic group creation
#### 9.12.3.1 General
The V2X application specific server is responsible for V2X dynamic group
formation (including information like group ID assignment, group definition),
membership management (e.g. user authorization). VAE layer supports V2X UEs in
the Uu communication range assigning a ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for application
layer V2X dynamic group formation.
#### 9.12.3.2 Procedure
The procedure for on-network dynamic group creation is illustrated in figure
9.12.3.2-1.
Pre-condition:
1\. V2X application dynamic group is defined at the V2X application specific
server with V2X UE assigned as dynamic group leader.
2\. VAE server has a pool of the ProSe Layer-2 Group IDs that can be assigned
to dynamic groups
Figure 9.12.3.2-1: On-network dynamic group creation
1\. The V2X application specific server requests the VAE server to configure
dynamic group corresponding to the dynamic group information (e.g. dynamic
group ID, group definition, group leader).
2\. To enable PC5 communication, the VAE server assigns ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
to the received dynamic group information from the available ProSe Layer-2
Group ID pool.
3\. The VAE server responds to the V2X application specific server for the
request to configure dynamic group.
4\. The VAE server triggers a push request including ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
corresponding to the dynamic group information to the VAE client.
5\. The VAE client stores the received PC5 communication parameters
corresponding to the dynamic group information received from the VAE server.
NOTE 1: The VAE client may further announce the dynamic group information
including the corresponding ProSe Layer-2 Group ID to the other VAE clients
within the PC5 communication proximity on a PC5 channel dedicated for V5-AE
communications, enabling more V2X UEs to join the dynamic group.
NOTE 2: When there is loss of connectivity with the network by the V2X UEs,
service continuity is ensured by the V2X UEs switching to PC5 communication
using the VAE server assigned ProSe Layer-2 Group ID corresponding to the
dynamic group formation.
### 9.12.4 Off-network dynamic group creation
#### 9.12.4.1 General
The V2X application specific client is responsible for V2X dynamic group
information (including information like group ID assignment, group
definition). VAE layer on the client supports assigning a ProSe Layer-2 Group
ID for application layer V2X dynamic group formation.

1\. The V2X application specific client 2 requests the VAE client 2 to
configure dynamic group corresponding to the dynamic group information (e.g.
dynamic group ID, group definition, group leader).
2\. Each VAE client generates ProSe Layer-2 Group ID independently based on
the provisioned ProSe Layer-2 Group ID(s) generation rules for its group
information or the VAE client 2 assigns ProSe Layer-2 Group ID from the pool
of configured ProSe Layer-2 Group IDs.
3\. VAE client may further announce the dynamic group information including
the corresponding ProSe Layer-2 Group ID to the other VAE clients within the
PC5 communication proximity on a PC5 channel dedicated for V5-AE
communications, enabling more V2X UEs to join the dynamic group.
4\. The VAE client stores the PC5 communication parameters corresponding to
the dynamic group information received from another VAE client.
### 9.12.5 On-network dynamic group notification
#### 9.12.5.1 General
Once the on-network dynamic group is created as defined in subclause 9.12.3,
the VAE client notifies the VAE server about changes in the group (i.e. UE
joins or leaves the group) and finally the V2X application specific server is
notified with such information.
#### 9.12.5.2 Procedure
The procedure for on-network dynamic group notification is illustrated in
figure 9.12.5.2-1.
Pre-condition:
1\. V2X application dynamic group is created as defined in subclause 9.12.3.
Figure 9.12.5.2-1: On-network dynamic group notification
1\. The VAE client sends identity list notification to the VAE server about
group member changes.
2\. Upon receipt of the identity list notification from the VAE client, the
VAE server further notifies the V2X application specific server about the
newly joined or left group member(s).
## 9.13 Network situation and QoS monitoring and reporting
### 9.13.1 General
The VAE server supports monitoring of 3GPP systems\' network situation for V2X
services. The VAE server receives and processes access network-related
monitoring events/reports from SCEF (EPS entity of the 3GPP network system) as
