# 1 Scope
This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support the Mission Critical Data (MCData)
services. MCData is a suite of services which utilizes the common functional
architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] to support MC services over LTE
including the common services core.
MCData services suite consists of the following sub-services:
\- short data service (SDS);
\- file distribution (FD.
MCData features include:
\- conversation management;
\- transmission and reception control;
\- communication release; and
\- enhanced status.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.282 [3] and
3GPP TS 22.280 [2].
The present document is applicable primarily to MCData service using E-UTRAN
access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [4]. Certain
application functions of the MCData service could also be supported via
non-3GPP access networks but no additional functionality is specified to
support non-3GPP access.
The MCData service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.

# 4 Introduction
The MCData service suite provides a set of generic capabilities and specific
services to enable one-to-one and group data communications between MCData
users.
The MCData architecture utilises the common functional architecture to support
mission critical services over LTE defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] and aspects
of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6], the Proximity-based
Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [8], the MBMS User Service architecture defined in 3GPP TS 26.348
[19], the Security of the Mission Critical Service in 3GPP TS 33.180 [13] and
the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.237 [9] to enable
support of the MCData service.
The MCData UE primarily obtains access to the MCData service via E-UTRAN,
using the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [4]. Certain application
functions of MCData service can be accessed using MCData UEs via non-3GPP
access networks.
The MCData system provides the function to support interworking with LMR
systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [18].
# 5 Architectural requirements
## 5.1 Transmission control
The MCData service supports the ability to transmit SDS messages automatically
towards the selected recipient user (private communication) or members of the
selected MCData group. The MCData server may still reject the sent message
(e.g. if there is no authority to send).
NOTE: If a MCData group is configured for lossless communication, all members
of the selected MCData group will receive the transmitted SDS messages, at a
time dependent on affiliation status.An affiliated group member of this MCData
group will receive the SDS messages when they are sent. A group member that is
not affiliated at the time an SDS message is sent, the SDS message will be
stored in the group member\'s personal account in the MCData message store.
The stored message will be available to the group member when he synchronizes
with the MCData message store. If a MCData group is not configured for
lossless communication, only the affiliated members of the selected MCData
group will receive the transmitted SDS messages.
For MCData types other than SDS using signalling control plane, the MCData
service invokes a transmission request grant approach before data is permitted
to be transmitted. The MCData service provides configurable limits for the
maximum amount of data for and/or maximum amount of time that an MCData user
can transmit in a single request, which may be configured by the MCData
administrator.
Editor\'s note: Additional criteria such as frequency of transmission,
category/type of data, etc., for transmission control arbitration is FFS.
For congestion control, related to transmission requests, the MCData service
may perform the following:
\- reject the data transmission requests and then shall notify the MCData user
of the rejection;
\- queue the data transmission requests; or
\- at any time, withhold the permission to transmit data automatically.
The MCData service shall notify the transmitting MCData group member if there
are no other MCData group members affiliated to the MCData group.
## 5.2 Reception control
The MCData service shall support the ability to receive small amounts of data
automatically. The MCData service may store data waiting for delivery in a
temporary store, and notify availability to the receiving MCData users. The
data which is temporarily stored may be configured with \"time to live\"
value, and subsequently, the data may be purged from the temporary store upon
expiry of \"time to live\".
The recipient individual user (private communication) or affiliated members of
the MCData group(s) shall be notified of the list of available data either on
request or periodically.
The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for the MCData user to select
data to be downloaded from the list corresponding to the temporary store,
subject to limitations such as expiry time and size.
The MCData service shall support the ability to automatically deliver files
with a size less than a configured threshold value (i.e. auto-receive). The
data size for auto-receive shall be configured by the MCData administrator.
## 5.3 Short Data Service capability
The MCData service shall support SDS capability for one-to-one and group
communications.
The SDS capability shall support messages with a maximum payload of at least
1000 bytes. The supported message types shall include text, binary, or
hyperlinks. Multiple message types may be interleaved within in a single
message payload. The payload shall support inclusion of location information
of the sending MCData user, with or without user or application provided data.
The MCData service shall support messages to be sent over the signalling plane
or the media plane.
The SDS capability shall allow for multiple related messages to be correlated
and sequenced within the MCData service.
The MCData user shall be able to selectively request read and delivery receipt
indication for the sent messages. The message delivery history information
should be made available to an authorized MCData user.
## 5.4 File distribution capability
The MCData service shall support distribution of files for one-to-one and
group communications.
The MCData service shall allow the MCData user to send a file or a URL of a
file to another MCData user. The source of the file can originate either from
an MCData client or from a network functional entity. The generated URL shall
be a reference to a stored file to allow for subsequent retrieval. The file
storage policy may determine the availability of the file to be retrieved, and
is subject to expiry time and size limitations.
When the file delivery request is set by the sending user to mandatory
download, the MCData service shall proceed to deliver the file to the
recipient when possible. The file distribution mechanisms shall support both
unicast and broadcast delivery methods.
Editor\'s note: Requirements for automatic re-try mechanisms and maximum retry
count is FFS.
The MCData service shall support aggregation of download completion and
disposition notification reports when files are distributed to multiple
recipients.
The MCData service shall support mechanisms for detection and recovery of lost
data. A receiving MCData client should be able to:
\- detect and report when a transfer did not complete properly and request
retransmission;
\- identify and re-request the missing parts of an incompletely received file;
and
\- accept partial retransmissions and use them to reconstitute the original
file.
Editor\'s note: File repair when end-to-end encryption is used is FFS.
When employing MBMS delivery:
\- MCData may use the MB2 interface specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [8]. See also
Group Communication Delivery Method in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21]; or
\- if MBMS user services and Download Delivery Method (see 3GPP TS 26.346
[21]) are utilized, MCData shall use the xMB interface specified in 3GPP TS
26.348 [19].For the MBMS path, figure 5.4-1 shows both the MB2 and the xMB
interfaces.
Figure 5.4-1 MCData on-network architecture showing the unicast and MBMS
delivery paths
## 5.5 Data streaming capability
The MCData service shall support data streaming capability for one-to-one and
group communications.
The MCData service shall allow the MCData user to send a data stream or a URL
of a data stream to another MCData user. The source of the data stream can
originate either from an MCData client or from a network functional entity.
For a data stream originating at a network functional entity, the data stream
may be provided by an MCData user. The data streaming mechanisms shall support
both unicast and broadcast delivery methods.
Editor\'s note: The minimum bitrate support for data streaming is FFS.
When the data streaming request is set to automatic reception, the MCData
service shall not require consent from the receiving MCData user.
The MCData user shall be able to apply controls (i.e. start, stop, cancel) to
the streams, and on a per recipient basis.
Editor\'s note: The applicability of pause and resume controls to one-to-one
communication is FFS
The stream shall be terminated through an explicit user control (i.e. stop,
cancel operation) or by reaching the end of the streamed content.
## 5.6 MCData group affiliation and MCData group de-affiliation
MCData groups may be configured with one or more MCData sub-services (e.g.
SDS, FD, DS) as specified within the MCData service. When an MCData user
affiliates to an MCData group, the MCData user is affiliated to each of those
MCData sub-services configured in the MCData group. The list of MCData sub-
services configured for an MCData group shall be included in the MCData group
configuration data.
MCData group affiliation shall be as specified in clause 5.2.5 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [5]. In addition, the following requirements shall be fulfilled by the
MCData service for MCData users affiliated to MCData groups:
\- MCData users receive notifications for participating in MCData sub-services
and invitations for their affiliated MCData group(s).
\- MCData users select an affiliated MCData group to initiate a new message,
file distribution, data stream, etc.
\- MCData users receive messages, files, data streams, enhanced status
updates, etc, from their affiliated MCData group(s).
## 5.7 Conversation management
The conversation management:
1\. shall include a service indication for conversation management in each SDS
and FD transaction.
2\. may be comprised of SDS transactions or FD transactions or a combination
of both.
3\. shall include a conversation identifier in each SDS and FD transaction.
4\. shall treat conversation between different set of users (either in one-to-
one or group) as a separate conversation.
5\. shall treat conversation between the same set of users (either in one-to-
one or group), but with a different conversation identifier as a separate
conversation.
## 5.8 Bearer management
### 5.8.1 General
The MCData UE shall use the APNs as defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 and table
A.6-1 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]. The MCData UE shall use the MC services APN as
defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 and table A.6-1 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] for the
SIP-1 reference point.
### 5.8.2 EPS bearer considerations
The EPS bearer considerations specified in subclause 5.2.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.280
[5] shall apply.
### 5.8.3 EPS unicast bearer considerations for MCData
For an MCData session request, resources shall be requested utilising
interaction with dynamic PCC. The MCData system shall request resources over
Rx to a PCRF. The dedicated bearer for MCData media shall utilise the QCI
value of 70 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [14]). The request of resources
over Rx shall include an application identifier for MCData in order for the
PCRF to evaluate the correct QCI.
The UE is required to support at minimum one bearer, which is used for MCData
(see annex A in 3GPP TS 36.331 [15]).
Depending on operator policy, for media plane:
\- the MCData system may be able to request modification of the priority (ARP)
of an existing bearer without the need to initiate a new dedicated GBR bearer;
or
\- the EPS bearers for MCData communication may enable pre-emption of lower
priority EPS bearers if the maximum number of bearers has been reached in
favour of the newly initiated MCData EPS bearer, if the EPS bearer used for
MCData communication has higher priority level (ARP) than the bearer(s) used
for other application(s) and if the bearers for non MCData application are
pre-emptable. In this case, the EPS bearer for MCData communication pre-empts
one of the existing EPS bearers when the maximum number of bearers is
established for other applications.
NOTE: Operator policy takes into account regional/national requirements.
The EPS bearer for MCData emergency communication shall have highest priority
level among MCData communication types. The EPS bearer for MCData imminent
peril communication shall have higher priority level than one for MCData
communication but lower than the priority level for MCData emergency
communication.
### 5.8.4 MBMS bearer management
The MBMS bearer management for MC services is specified in subclause 5.2.7.1
of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
## 5.9 Disposition
Disposition requests and notifications can be sent \"in-band\" using the same
mechanism used for transport of the data, or can be sent \"out-of-band\" when
the mechanism used for transport of the data is no longer available.
For standalone SDS and FD, the MCData UE shall use the signalling plane for
disposition request and disposition notifications. For session SDS, the MCData
UE shall use:
\- the media plane for disposition request and disposition notifications; and
\- the signalling plane for disposition notifications when the media plane is
no longer available.
## 5.10 MCData message store
MCData message store is used by MCData users to store their MCData
communications permanently; it shall provide secured storage area for each
authorized MCData user having a user account. The storage area is identified
by the MCData user\'s MCData ID. The MCData message store shall allow an
MCData user to access only the storage area that he is authorized to access. A
user (i.e. a dispatcher) other than the user account holder shall be able to
access the account holder\'s storage area if authorized.
During an active MCData communication, the participating function on the
MCData server of a MCData user participant shall, if requested by the MCData
user, deposit messages and files exchanged in the conversation to the MCData
user\'s storage area in the MCData message store. When depositing the MCData
communication into the MCData message store, if no such MCData user account is
available on the MCData message store the MCData server shall create the
user\'s account first and then deposit the MCData communications. The MCData
message store shall support user account creation and deposit MCData
communications operations from the MCData server after successful
authentication and authorization. The MCData message store shall support the
message store client to retrieve, update, delete, search and synchronize
MCData communications stored in the MCData message store, after successful
authentication and authorization.
The MCData user shall have an option if he wants to store the MCData
communications in the MCData message store or not.
All messages and files exchanged in an active MCData communication shall be
stored as objects in the MCData message store. A stored object shall contain
the following information:
1\. The message or file itself; and
2\. Associated metadata, consisting of:
a. information retrieved from the information elements of the message or file,
such as MCData IDs, Conversation identifier etc.; and
b. other information, such as content type (message or file), status
(\"seen\", \"received by\", \"read by \", \"downloaded by \" etc).
NOTE: It is the decision of SA3 on the mechanism to store an encrypted message
or file in the MCData message store.
When a MCData user logs onto a UE with successful authentication and
authorization and obtains the user service profile, the message store client
on the UE shall synchronize with the user\'s account on the MCData message
store, either automatically or manually (i.e. interacts with the user on which
option to synchronize or no synchronization at all), before any MCData service
starts.
## 5.11 IP connectivity (IPcon) capability
IP connectivity service enables the exchange of IP Data using MCData transport
service and provides the transport of IP Data for e.g. data hosts, servers,
etc. that do not have mission critical communication capabilities. The
exchange of IP Data is not limited in a transaction.
Figure 5.11-1: IP connectivity model
The corresponding MCData client enables bidirectional IP Data communication
with the support of the IP connectivity service and thus forms the gateway to
data hosts or servers. Therefore, the IP connectivity MCData client requests
the MCData transport service with the associated QoS requirement and
communication priority.
An authorised MCData client supporting IP connectivity capabilities is able to
bar incoming IP connectivity requests either on demand or by providing a list
of excluded origins identified by the MCData ID and, if available, by the
functional alias.
For IP connectivity, the MCData server may support following limitation to
exchange IP Data:
\- limit the total data volume between the authorized MCData clients, divided
by transmission and reception;
\- max time limit, e.g. total minutes or allow exchange between predefined
start and end time.
IP connectivity MCData service supports MCData transport services for one-to-
one and group communication.
The IP address allocation necessary for user-IP connectivity MCData transport
service is independent to the IP address allocation of the individual data
hosts attached with the MCData client supporting IP connectivity capabilities.
The required IP address pools for the user-IP connectivity MCData service are
managed by the IP connectivity MCData transport service.
Editor\'s note: The withdrawal of an IP connectivity connection by an
authorized user is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The remote initiation of IP connectivity service is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The control of QoS based on per packet priority is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The impact of IP connectivity services on interworking is FFS.
## 5.12 MBMS user service architecture requirements
The MBMS user service architecture offers a set of delivery methods to
applications, specified in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21]. The MBMS download delivery
method is used for the delivery of files over MBMS and provides reliability
control by means of forward-error-correction.
The MCData File Distribution capability can use the MBMS download delivery
method by including, in the MC service-on network architecture (subclause
5.2.6 from 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]), the MBMS user service architecture (3GPP TS
26.346 [21]), with the MCData server assuming the role of the content
provider.
The MCData server may determine the MBMS broadcast area based on the cell
identities of the affiliated group members received over GC1.
When the xMB interface is used, the MCData server uses the xMB mission
critical extension, specified in 3GPP TS 26.348 [19] to control the QoS and
the MBMS broadcast area of the MBMS user services. The MCData server also
provides a file delivery manifest over xMB-C (see subclause 5.6.2 from 3GPP TS
26.348 [19]) describing the list of files to be broadcasted, and, for each
file, the target completion date and the number of repetitions.
The MBMS user service metada, which provides the delivery and schedule
parameters, are returned to the MCData server after the MBMS session creation
or update, under the form of a SA file (annex L.3A from 3GPP TS 26.346 [21]).
The MCData server signals this SA file, together with the service id and the
uri of the file to be received to the targeted MCData clients.
Editor\'s note: it is FFS how the service announcement channel (3GPP TS
26.346) to deliver the MBMS user service metadata can be used.
5A Involved business relationships
The description of the involved business relationships for the MCData service
is contained in clause 6 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
# 6 Functional model
## 6.1 General
This clause defines the functional model for MCData service.
The security solution for the MCData service, including end-to-end encryption,
is specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [13].
## 6.2 Description of the planes
The functional model for the support of MCData is defined as a series of
planes to allow for the breakdown of the architectural description.
The description of the planes and the relationship between the planes are
contained in the common functional architecture to support MC services in 3GPP
TS 23.280 [5].
## 6.3 Transmission and reception control aspects
### 6.3.1 General
The transmission and reception control are functions of the MCData server.
For small data transmissions there is no need for prior grant of request to
transmit. The procedures in the present document describe when data is
automatically sent.
For large data transmissions, i.e. large files, the data is transmitted only
after request to transmit is granted. The data to be transmitted and/or
received may be stored in a data repository associated with the transmission
and reception control functions.
NOTE: An overview of transmission control process and possible arbitration
mechanisms is provided in the Annex B.
## 6.4 Generic functional model
### 6.4.1 On-network functional model
Figure 6.4.1-1 shows the generic application plane functional model.
Figure 6.4.1-1: Generic application plane functional model
In the model shown in figure 6.4.1-1, capability functions (SDS, FD, DS,
IPcon) of the MCData client and the MCData server along with their reference
points (MCData-cap-1 to MCData-cap-n) are described in the respective
functional models for each capability.
NOTE: The security aspects of new network components (MCData message store and
Message store client) and its two new reference points are the responsibility
of SA3 and thus outside the scope of the present document.
### 6.4.2 Off-network functional model
### 6.4.3 Functional entities description
Editor\'s note: Combining functional models describing each capability into
one functional model is FFS.
#### 6.4.3.1 Application plane
##### 6.4.3.1.1 MCData client
The MCData client functional entity acts as the user agent for all MCData
application transactions. The client supports SDS, file distribution, data
streaming and IP connectivity MCData capabilities utilized by MCData services

data communication are realized using SDS, file distribution, data streaming
and IP connectivity MCData communication capabilities.
All the MCData clients supporting users belonging to a single group are
required to use the same MCData server for that group. An MCData client
supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have relationships with
multiple MCData servers.
For MBMS delivery, the MCData server functional entity represents a specific
instantiation of the GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [8] to control
multicast and unicast operations for group communications.
If the MBMS user service architecture is utilized, the MCData server
functional entity represents a specific instantiation of the content provider
as described in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21] to control multicast operations for file
distribution.
The MCData server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS functional
entity of the signalling control plane.

role. The MCData server may perform the controlling role for one-to-one and
group data communication. The MCData server performing the controlling role
for a one-to-one or group data communication may also perform a participating
role for the same one-to-one or group data communication. For each one-to-one
and group data communication, there shall be only one MCData server assuming
the controlling role, while one or more MCData servers in participating role
may be involved.
The MCData server performing the controlling role is responsible for:
\- handling transmission and reception control (e.g. policy enforcement for
participation in the MCData group communication) towards all the MCData users
of the one-to-one and group data communication;
\- interfacing with the group management server for group policy and
affiliation status information of this MCData server\'s served affiliated
users;
\- managing SDS and FD data distribution during MCData group communication;
and
\- managing the MCData transport service for IP connectivity.

send and receive MCData related media for that MCData group. When an MCData
user has de affiliated from an MCData group then the MCData user cannot send
and receive MCData related media to and from that MCData group.
## 7.3 Use of MBMS transmission (on-network)
### 7.3.1 Information flows for MBMS Transmission
Information flows for generic MBMS procedures are defined in 3GPP TS 23.280
[5].
### 7.3.2 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
The MCData service shall support the procedure for using pre-established MBMS
bearers as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] with the following clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCData client;
\- The MC service server is the MCData server; and

SDS-3, MCData-FD-1, MCDataâ€‘FD-3, MCData-DS-1 and MCDataâ€‘DS-3 reference points
for this procedure.
MCData may use pre-established MBMS bearer for the MCData features short data
service, file distribution and data streaming. The MBMS bearer can be used by
any group. Depending on the capacity of the MBMS bearer, the bearer can be
used to broadcast one or more services in parallel.
Both the media packets as well as the transmission control messages to the
receiving users may be sent on the MBMS bearer. Optionally a separate MBMS
bearer could be used for the transmission control messages, due to different
bearer characteristic requirements.
### 7.3.3 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
The MCData service shall support the procedure for using pre-established MBMS
bearers as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] with the following clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCData client;
\- The MC service server is the MCData server; and
\- The MC service ID is the MCData ID.
The MCData service shall use the MCData-6, MCData-DS-1 and MCData-DS-3
reference points for this procedure.
MCData may use dynamic MBMS bearer for the MCData feature data streaming. The
MBMS bearer can be used by any group. Depending on the capacity of the MBMS
bearer, the bearer can be used to broadcast one or more services in parallel.
For file distribution using the media plane (7.5.2.7), the use of dynamic MBMS
bearer is not supported. Both the media packets as well as the transmission
control messages to the receiving users may be sent on the MBMS bearer.
Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be used for the transmission control
messages, due to different bearer characteristic requirements.

### 7.3.5 Use of MBMS user services for file distribution
#### 7.3.5.1 General
This subclause defines information flows and procedures for usage of MBMS user
services that applies to MCData file distribution. MBMS user services can be
used for any MC service group.
#### 7.3.5.2 Information flows for MBMS user service usage
##### 7.3.5.2.1 MBMS user service announcement
Table 7.3.5.2.1-1 describes the information flow MBMS bearer announcement from
the MCData server to the MCData client.
Table 7.3.5.2.1-1: MBMS user service announcement
* * *
Information element Status Description MBMS user service id M Id of the MBMS
user service SA file M The service announcement file as returned in the
create/update session response (subclause 5.4 in 3GPP TS 26.348 [19]) (see
NOTE) Monitoring state O The monitoring state is used to control if the client
is actively monitoring the reception quality or the MBMS bearer used by the
MBMS user service. Unicast status O An indication that the listening status of
the unicast bearer is requested. NOTE: The SA file provides the TMGI, the list
of MBMS service area identifiers, the frequency and the delivery parameters.
* * *
#### 7.3.5.3 Procedures for MBMS user service usage
##### 7.3.5.3.1 Use of pre-established MBMS user services
###### 7.3.5.3.1.1 General
In this scenario, the MCData server pre-establishes MBMS user service(s) in
certain pre-configured areas before the initiation of a group file
distribution. When a user originates a request for a file distribution in one
of these areas, the MCData server can use the pre-established MBMS user
service(s) for the DL media transmission.
The MBMS user service can be announced prior to the file distribution or
within the signalling message for the file distribution.
The MBMS user service does not transmit application level control signalling.
An MBMS bearer could be used for the application level control messages
according to the generic MBMS procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
###### 7.3.5.3.1.2 Procedure
Editor\'s note: The procedure in this clause needs to be revised considering
that MBMS user services, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21], cannot be
supported over the MB2 interface.
The procedure figure 7.3.5.3.1.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MCData
clients using an MBMS user service.
Pre-conditions:
\- The participating users are already affiliated.
Figure 7.3.5.3.1.2-1: Use of pre-established MBMS user service
1\. The MCData server determines to create an MBMS user service with a given
MBMS user service id. If the MCData server makes use of the xMB interface, the
MCData server creates an MBMS user service over xMB-C (subclause 5.3 from 3GPP
TS 26.348 [19]).
NOTE 1: The procedure to determine the creation of MBMS user services is
implementation specific.
2\. If the MCData server makes use of the xMB interface, the MCData server
creates an MBMS session over xMB-C for the MBMS user service (subclause 5.4
from 3GPP TS 26.348 [19]), with the type set to \"Files\" to use the MBMS
download delivery method. This MBMS session will be used for file
distribution. In response, the MCData server gets the TMGI of the MBMS bearer
used for the MBMS session, and the SA file containing the metadata of the MBMS
user service.
3a. Else, the MCData server activates an MBMS bearer over MB2-C for the MBMS
user service.
3b. The MCData server, if not already in the possession of the SA file,
generates the SA file containing the metadata of the MBMS user service.
4\. The MCData server passes using control plane signalling the MBMS user
service info for the service description associated with the pre-established
MBMS user service to the MCData client. The MCData client obtains the TMGI,
identifying the MBMS bearer, from the SA file included in the MBMS user
service description.
5\. The MCData client stores the information associated with the MBMS user
service. The MCData client uses the TMGI and other MBMS user service related
information to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer.
6\. The MCData client that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI indicates to the MCData server that the MCData client is able
to receive file distributed over MBMS, whereby the MCData server may decide to
use this MBMS user service instead of unicast bearer for MC communication
sessions.
NOTE 2: Step 4 is optional for the MCData UE on subsequent MBMS user service
announcements.
NOTE 3: The information flow is specified in subclause 10.7.2.2 from 3GPP TS
23.280 [5].
7\. If the MCData server makes use of the xMB interface and wants to deliver a
file to a group, the MCData server updates the MBMS session to provide the
file location and its uri.
8\. The MCData server signals the file transmission over the MBMS user service
to the targeted MCData clients.
9\. The file, transmitted with the MBMS download delivery method, is received
by the MCData clients. If the MCData server does not make use of the xMB
interface, the MCData server fragments the file to be sent, applies error
correction according to the MBMS download delivery method (3GPP TS 26.346
[21]) and sent the FLUTE packets over MB2-U.
##### 7.3.5.3.2 Use of dynamic MBMS user service establishment
Editor\'s note: The procedure in this clause needs to be revised considering
that MBMS user services, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21], cannot be
supported over the MB2 interface.
In this scenario depicted in figure 7.3.5.3.2-1, the MCData server decides to
establish an MBMS user service for the distribution of a given file. The MBMS
user service is announced to the MCData client, together with the file
information to be received.
NOTE 1: The MCData server logic for determining when to establish the new MBMS
user service is implementation specific. For example, the MCData server could
decide to establish the MBMS delivery based on the location of the UE\'s that
are a part of the targeted group.
Figure 7.3.5.3.2-1: Use of dynamic MBMS user service establishment
> 1\. The MCData server determines to create an MBMS user service with a given
> MBMS user service id for the group communication session. If the MCData
> server makes use of the xMB interface, the MCData server creates an MBMS
> user service over xMB-C (subclause 5.3 from 3GPP TS 26.348 [19]).
2\. If the MCData server makes use of the xMB interface, the MCData server
creates a MBMS session for the MBMS user service (subclause 5.4 from 3GPP TS
26.348 [19]), with the type set to \"Files\" to use the MBMS download delivery
method, and provide the file location and its uri. In response, the MCData
server gets the TMGI of the MBMS bearer used for the MBMS session, the SA file
containing the metadata of the MBMS user service and the scheduling parameter
for the file delivery.
3a. Else, the MCData server activates an MBMS bearer over MB2-C for the MBMS
user service.
3b. The MCData server, if not already in the possession of the SA file,
generates the SA file containing the metadata of the MBMS user service.
4\. The MCData server passes using control plane signalling the SA file to the
MCData client. The MCData client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS
bearer, from the SA file included in the MBMS user service description.
5\. The MCData client stores the information associated with the MBMS user
service. The MCData client uses the TMGI and other MBMS user service related
information to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer.
6\. The MCData client that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI indicates to the MCData server that the MCData client is able
to receive file distributed over MBMS, whereby the MCData server may decide to
use this MBMS user service instead of unicast bearer for MC communication
sessions.
7\. The MCData server signals the file transmission over the MBMS user service
to the targeted MCData clients.
8\. The file, transmitted with the MBMS download delivery method, is received
by the MCData clients. If the MCData server does not make use of the xMB
interface, the MCData server fragments the file to be sent, applies error
correction according to the MBMS download delivery method (3GPP TS 26.346
[21]) and sent the FLUTE packets over MB2-U.
## 7.4 Short data service
### 7.4.1 General
There are several procedures how an SDS message can be transported from the
sender to the recipient. All of the following factors are used by MCData
client for selecting appropriate SDS procedures:
\- Whether the data to transfer is within or outside the SDS data size limit
to transport over signalling control plane;
\- Whether the MCData user has only one SDS transaction or multiple SDS
transactions;
\- Whether MCData user, optionally using its associated and activated
functional alias, is targeting SDS transaction to another MCData user or
MCData group;
\- Whether MCData UE is on-network or off-network; and

#### 7.4.2.2 One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling control
plane
##### 7.4.2.2.1 General
A MCData user initiates a standalone SDS data transfer with another MCData
user. For the SDS data transfer signalling plane is used.
##### 7.4.2.2.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.2.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating one-to-one MCData data communication for sending standalone SDS
data to other MCData user, with or without disposition request. Standalone
refers to sending unidirectional data in one transaction.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The SDS payload data size is below the configured maximum payload data
size for SDS over signalling control plane.
2\. MCData users on MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCData service.
3\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 belong to the same MCData system.
4\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
5\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.2.2-1: One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling
control plane
1\. The user at MCData client 1 initiates an SDS data transfer for the chosen
MCData user.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData standalone data request towards the MCData
server. The MCData standalone data request contains conversation identifier
for message thread indication. The MCData standalone data request may contain
disposition request if indicated by the user at MCData client 1. MCData user
at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within the SDS data
transfer.
a) If the MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency
short data service communication or MCData emergency state is already set for
the MCData client 1 (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) The MCData standalone data request shall contain emergency indicator; and
ii) If MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData standalone data request. MCData server verifies
whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been
activated for the user. The MCData server also checks whether any policy is to
be asserted to limit certain types of message or content to certain members
due, for example, to location or user privilege or affiliation.
NOTE: The MCData server prioritizes the MCData emergency communication over
the other MCData communication. How the MCData server prioritizes MCData
emergency communication is not in the scope of the present document.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData standalone data request towards the
MCData user. The MCData standalone data request towards the MCData user
contains the emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData
standalone data request from MCData client 1.
5\. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of MCData client
2 may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for MCData user
consumption, then the MCData user of MCData client 2 shall not be notified.
The action taken when the payload contains application data or command
instructions are specific based on the contents of the payload. Payload
content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to a known local non-
MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the MCData client 2 to
start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start application) and
shall pass the payload content to the just started application.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report. The MCData data disposition
notification from MCData client may be stored by the MCData server for
disposition history interrogation from authorized MCData users.
> 7\. MCData data disposition notification is sent to the disposition
> requesting user at MCData client 1.
>
> 8\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
> MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
> MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
> report. The MCData data disposition notification from MCData client may be
> stored by the MCData server for disposition history interrogation from
> authorized MCData users. The MCData data disposition notification from
> MCData client may be stored by the MCData server for disposition history
> interrogation from authorized MCData users.
>
> 9\. MCData data disposition notification is sent to the disposition
> requesting user at MCData client 1.
#### 7.4.2.3 One-to-one standalone short data service using media plane
##### 7.4.2.3.1 General
A MCData user initiates a standalone SDS data transfer with another MCData
user. For the SDS data transfer media plane is used.
##### 7.4.2.3.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.3.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating one-to-one MCData data communication for sending standalone SDS
data to other MCData user, with or without disposition request. Standalone
refers to sending unidirectional data in one transaction. The SDS payload data
size is assumed to be above the configured maximum payload data size for SDS
over signalling control plane.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCData service.
2\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 belong to the same MCData system.
3\. Optionally, the MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be
used.
4\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.3.2-1: One-to-one standalone short data service using media plane
1\. User at MCData client 1 would like to initiate a SDS data transfer request
for the chosen MCData user.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData standalone session data request towards the
MCData server. The MCData standalone session data request contains one MCData
user for one-to-one data communication as selected by the user at MCData
client 1. The MCData standalone session data request contains conversation
identifier for message thread indication. The MCData data request may contain
disposition request if indicated by the user at MCData client 1. MCData user
at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within the SDS data
transfer.
a) If the MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency
short data service communication or MCData emergency state is already set for
the MCData client 1 (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) The MCData standalone session data request shall contain emergency
indicator; and
ii) If MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData standalone session data request. MCData server
verifies whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and
has been activated for the user. The MCData server also checks whether any
policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or content to
certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege. MCData server
determines the eligible MCData user(s) after policy assertion for sending the
MCData standalone session data request.
NOTE: The MCData server prioritizes the MCData emergency communication over
the other MCData communication. How the MCData server prioritizes MCData
emergency communication is not in the scope of the present document.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData standalone session data request towards
the MCData user. The MCData standalone session data request towards the MCData
user contains an emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData
standalone session data request from MCData client 1.
5\. The receiving MCData client 2 automatically accepts the MCData standalone
session data request and responds with MCData standalone session data response
towards MCData server.
6\. MCData server forwards the MCData client 2 accepted response to the MCData
user initiating the MCData standalone session data request.
7\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 have successfully established media
plane for data communication and the MCData client 1 transmits the SDS data.
> 8\. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
> data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of MCData

#### 7.4.2.4 One-to-one short data service session
##### 7.4.2.4.1 General
A MCData user triggers an establishment of a MCData session with another
MCData user for the exchange of SDS data.
##### 7.4.2.4.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.4.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating data communication session with another MCData user for exchanging
at least one SDS data transaction between them, with or without disposition
request using MCData-SDS-1 and MCData-SDS-2 or MCData-SDS-3 reference points.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCData service.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.4.2-1: One-to-one short data service session
1\. User at MCData client 1 would like to initiate a SDS data communication
session request for the chosen MCData user.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData session data request towards the MCData
server. The MCData session data request contains one MCData user for one-to-
one data communication as selected by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData
session data request contains conversation identifier for message thread
indication. MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias
within the SDS data transfer.
a) If the MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency
short data service communication or MCData emergency state is already set for
the MCData client 1 (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) The MCData session data request shall contain emergency indicator; and
ii) If MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData session data request. The MCData server also checks
whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or
content to certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege.
MCData server determines the eligible MCData user(s) after policy assertion
for sending the MCData session data request. MCData server also verifies
whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been
activated for the user.
NOTE: The MCData server prioritizes the MCData emergency communication over
the other MCData communication. How the MCData server prioritizes MCData
emergency communication is not in the scope of the present document.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData session data request towards the MCData
user determined. The MCData session data request towards the MCData user
contains the emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData
session data request from MCData client 1.
5\. If the emergency indicator is present, the receiving MCData client 2
notifies the user about the incoming MCData session data request.
6\. The receiving MCData client 2 accepts the MCData session data request and
responds with MCData session data response towards MCData server.
7\. MCData server forwards the MCData client 2 accepted response to the MCData
user initiating the MCData session data request.
8\. and 10. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 have successfully established
media plane for data communication and either MCData client can transmit SDS
data. The MCData data request may contain disposition request if indicated by
the client sending data. If MCData data disposition was requested by the user,
then the receiving MCData client initiates a MCData data disposition
notification for delivery, read reports to the disposition requesting user.
The MCData data disposition notification from MCData user may be stored by the
MCData server for disposition history interrogation from authorized users.
9\. and 11. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not
application data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of
MCData client 2 may be notified, otherwise the MCData user of MCData client 2
shall not be notified.
12\. After SDS data transaction is complete, the established media plane is
released.
#### 7.4.2.5 Group standalone short data service using signalling control
plane
##### 7.4.2.5.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone SDS to a selected group results in
affiliated group members receiving the SDS data. The SDS payload data size is
assumed to be below the configured maximum payload data size for SDS over
signalling control plane.
##### 7.4.2.5.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.5.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating group standalone MCData data communication with or without
disposition request, to a group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData clients 1 to n belong to the same group and are
already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.5.2-1: Group standalone SDS using signalling control plane
1\. The user at MCData client 1 initiates an SDS data transfer to multiple
MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified by MCData group ID)
and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData group standalone data request towards the
MCData server. The MCData group data request contains MCData group ID as
selected by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData group standalone data
request contains conversation identifier for message thread indication. The
MCData group standalone data request may contain disposition request if
indicated by the user at MCData client 1. MCData user at MCData client 1 may
include a functional alias within the SDS data transfer.
> If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency short
> data service communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for
> the MCData client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) the MCData group standalone data request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii) the MCData group standalone data request shall set an alert indicator if
configured to send an MCData emergency alert while initiating an MCData
standalone data request for the emergency short data service communication;
iii) if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets
its MCData emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled; and
iv) once an MCData emergency communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until cancelled;
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData imminent peril short
data service communication:
i) the MCData group standalone data request shall contain imminent peril
indicator; and
ii) once an MCData imminent peril communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled.
2a. If either emergency indicator or imminent peril indicator is present in
the received MCData group standalone data request, the MCData server
implicitly affiliates MCData client 1 to the MCData group if the client is not
already affiliated.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData group standalone data request. The MCData server
resolves the MCData group ID to determine the members of that group and their
affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server.
The MCData server also checks whether any policy is to be asserted to limit
certain types of message or content to certain members due, for example, to
location or user privilege or affiliation. MCData server also verifies whether
the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated
for the user.
i) If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone data request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
emergency state, the MCData group is consider to be in the in-progress
emergency state until cancelled;
ii) If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone data request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
imminent peril state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
imminent peril state until cancelled;
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone data request towards
each MCData client determined in Step 3. The MCData group standalone data
request towards each MCData client contains:
i) an emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone data request from the MCData client 1;
ii) an imminent peril indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone data request from the MCData client 1; and
iii) an alert indicator if requested to initiate an emergency alert in the
received MCData group standalone data request from the MCData client 1.
5\. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of MCData
clients 2 to n may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for MCData
user consumption, then the MCData user of MCData clients 2 to n shall not be
notified. The action taken when the payload contains application data or
command instructions are specific based on the contents of the payload.
Payload content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to a known
local non-MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the MCData
client 2 to start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start
application) and shall pass the payload content to the just started
application.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client(s) initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report.
7\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report.
8\. The MCData data disposition notification(s) from MCData client may be
stored by the MCData server for disposition history interrogation from
authorized MCData users. The MCData data disposition notification(s) from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
9\. Aggregated or individual MCData data disposition notification(s) is sent
to the disposition requesting user at MCData client 1.
#### 7.4.2.6 Group standalone short data service using media plane
##### 7.4.2.6.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone SDS to a selected group results in
affiliated group members receiving the SDS data. The SDS payload data size is
assumed to be above the configured maximum payload data size for SDS over
signalling control plane.
##### 7.4.2.6.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.6.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating group standalone MCData data communication with or without
disposition request to a group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData client 1 to n belong to the same group and are
already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.6.2-1: Group standalone SDS using media plane
1\. User at MCData client 1 would like to initiate a SDS data transfer request
to multiple MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified by
MCData group ID) and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData group session standalone data request
towards the MCData server. The MCData group session standalone data request
contains target recipient(s) as selected by the user at MCData client 1. The
MCData session group standalone data request contains conversation identifier
for message thread indication. The MCData session group standalone data
request may contain disposition request if indicated by the user at MCData
client 1. MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within
the SDS data transfer.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency short data
service communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for MCData
client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) the MCData group session standalone data request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii) the MCData group session standalone data request shall set the alert
indicator if configured to send an MCData emergency alert while initiating an
MCData standalone data request for the emergency short data service
communication;
iii) if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets
its MCData emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled; and
iv) once an MCData emergency communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until cancelled.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData imminent peril short
data service communication:
i) the MCData group session standalone data request shall contain an imminent
peril indicator; and
ii) once an MCData imminent peril communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled;
2a. If either an emergency indicator or an imminent peril indicator is present
in received MCData group session standalone data request, the MCData server
implicitly affiliates MCData client 1 to the MCData group if the client is not
already affiliated.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData session group standalone data request. The MCData
server resolves the MCData group ID to determine the members of that group and
their affiliation status, based on the information from the group management
server. The MCData server also checks whether any policy is to be asserted to
limit certain types of message or content to certain members due, for example,
to location or user privilege. MCData server also verifies whether the
provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for
the user.
i) if an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData group session
standalone data request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
emergency state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
emergency state until cancelled;
ii) if an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData group
session standalone data request and if the MCData group is not in the in-
progress imminent peril state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-
progress imminent peril state until cancelled;
3a. The MCData server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for
all participants in the MCData group.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData group session standalone data request
towards each MCData user determined in Step 3. The MCData group session
standalone data request towards each MCData client contains:
i) an emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
session standalone data request from the MCData client 1;
ii) an imminent peril indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
session standalone data request from the MCData client 1; and
iii) an alert indicator if requested to initiate an emergency alert in the
received MCData group session standalone data request from MCData client 1;
5\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n automatically accepts the MCData group
session standalone data request and responds with MCData group standalone data
response towards MCData server.
6\. MCData server forwards the MCData clients 2 to n accepted response to the
MCData user initiating the MCData group session standalone data request.
NOTE 1: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 7
depending on the conditions to proceed with the data transmission.
7\. MCData client 1 and MCData server have successfully established media
plane for data communication and the MCData client 1 transmits the SDS data.
8\. MCData server distributes the data received from MCData client 1 to MCData
clients 2 to n over the established media plane. After completion of the
MCData transfer from MCData client 1, media plane resources associated to the
data communication are released.
NOTE 2: MCData server is not required to wait for the complete reception of
SDS data from MCData client 1 prior to initiating transmission to MCData
client 2 to n.
9\. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of MCData client
2 to n may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for MCData user
consumption, then the MCData user of MCData client 2 to n shall not be
notified. The action taken when the payload contains application data or
command instructions are specific based on the contents of the payload.
Payload content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to a known
local non-MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the MCData
client 2 to start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start
application) and shall pass the payload content to the just started
application.
10\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client(s) initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report.
11\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report.
12\. The MCData data disposition notification(s) from MCData client may be
stored by the MCData server for disposition history interrogation from
authorized MCData users. The MCData data disposition notification(s) from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
13\. Aggregated or individual MCData data disposition notification(s) is sent
to the disposition requesting user at MCData client 1.
#### 7.4.2.7 Group short data service session
##### 7.4.2.7.1 General
The initiation of a group SDS to a selected group results in affiliated group
members exchanging SDS data.
##### 7.4.2.7.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.7.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating SDS data communication session with an MCData group for exchanging
SDS data transactions between the group participants, with or without
disposition request, using MCData-SDS-1 and MCData-SDS-2reference points.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData client 1 to n belong to the same group and are
already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.7.2-1: Group SDS session
1\. User at MCData client 1 would like to initiate a SDS group data transfer
request to multiple MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified
by MCData group ID) and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData group data request towards the MCData
server. The MCData group data request contains MCData group ID as selected by
the user at MCData client 1. The MCData session data request contains
conversation identifier for message thread indication. MCData user at MCData
client 1 may include a functional alias within the SDS data transfer.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency short data
service communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for the
MCData client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) the MCData group data request shall contain an emergency indicator;
ii) the MCData group data request shall set an alert indicator if configured
to send an MCData emergency alert while initiating an MCData standalone data
request for the emergency short data service communication;
iii) if MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until explicitly
cancelled; and
iv) once an MCData emergency communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until cancelled.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData imminent peril short
data service communication:
i) the MCData group data request shall contain an imminent peril indicator;
and
ii) once an MCData imminent peril communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled;
2a. If either emergency indicator or imminent peril indicator is present in
received MCData group data request, the MCData server implicitly affiliates
MCData client 1 to the MCData group if the client is not already affiliated.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData group data request. The MCData server resolves the
MCData group ID to determine the members of that group and their affiliation
status, based on the information from the group management server. The MCData
server also checks whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types
of message or content to certain members due, for example, to location or user
privilege. MCData server also verifies whether the provided functional alias,
if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.
i) if an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData group data
request and if MCData group is not in in-progress emergency state, the MCData
group is consider to be in the in-progress emergency state until cancelled;
ii) if an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData group
data request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress imminent peril,
the MCData group is consider to be in the in-progress imminent peril state
until cancelled;
3a. The MCData server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for
all participants in the MCData group.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData group data request towards each MCData
user determined in Step 3. The MCData group data request towards each MCData
client contains:
i) an emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData group data
request from the MCData client 1;
ii) an imminent peril indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
data request from the MCData client 1; and
iii) an alert indicator if requested to initiate an emergency alert in the
received MCData group data request from MCData client 1;
5\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n optionally notify the user about the
incoming MCData session data request.
6\. The receiving MCData client 2 to n accept or reject the MCData group data
request and the corresponding result is in the MCData group data response
towards MCData server.
7\. MCData server forwards the MCData client 2 accepted response to the MCData
user initiating the MCData session data request.
NOTE: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the data transmission.
8\. MCData client 1 and the MCData group data request accepted clients have
successfully established media plane for data communication and either MCData
client can transmit SDS data. The MCData data request may contain disposition
request if indicated by the client sending data. If the payload is for MCData
user consumption (e.g. is not application data, is not command instructions,
etc.) then the SDS data receiving MCData users may be notified, otherwise
those MCData users shall not be notified.
9\. If MCData data disposition was requested by the user, then the SDS data
receiving MCData client initiates a MCData data disposition notification for
delivery, read reports to the disposition requesting user. The MCData data
disposition notification from MCData user may be stored by the MCData server
for disposition history interrogation from authorized users.
10\. Based on the MCData user action or conditions to release, the established
media plane for SDS data exchange is released.

priority state cancel request to the MCData server. The MCData client 1 also
resets emergency indicator in the request to inform MCData server about
cancelation of in-progress emergency group state.
NOTE 2: When MCData emergency alerts are in effect together with an MCData in-
progress emergency group state on the same MCData group, the MCData emergency
alert can, under some circumstances be cancelled at the same time. In that
case, the MCData group SDS in-progress priority group state cancel request
carries an indication that the alert is also being cancelled.
3\. The MCData server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required. The MCData server cancels/resets the
emergency in-progress state of the MCData group.
4\. The MCData server sends an MCData group SDS in-progress priority state
cancel request to the MCData group members.
5\. MCData group members are notified of the MCData group SDS in-progress
emergency state cancel.
6\. The receiving MCData clients send the MCData group SDS in-progress
priority state cancel response to the MCData server to acknowledge the MCData
in-progress emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these
acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCData server sends the MCData group SDS in-progress priority state
cancel response to the MCData user 1 to confirm the MCData in-progress
emergency group state cancel. If the MCData in-progress emergency group state
cancel request (in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCData
client 1 resets its local emergency status.
NOTE 3: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 3, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.

#### 7.4.3.3 One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling control
plane
##### 7.4.3.3.1 General
This subclause describes the detailed procedures for the scenario where SDS
data is to be sent to MCData user in off-network.
##### 7.4.3.3.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.3.3.2-1 describes procedures for an off-network MCData client 1
initiating one-to-one MCData data communication for sending standalone SDS
data to other MCData client, with or without disposition request. Standalone
refers to sending unidirectional data in one transaction. The SDS data size is
assumed to be pre-configured.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user 1 has initiated communication for sending standalone SDS data
to other MCData user 2.
2\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are members of the same ProSe
Discovery group and are ProSe 1:1 direct communication capable.
3\. MCData client 1 has discovered MCData client 2 in proximity, associated
with MCData user B, using ProSe Discovery procedures.
Figure 7.4.3.3.2-1: One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling
control plane
1\. MCData client 1 checks whether the MCData user 1 is authorized to send
MCData standalone data request.
2\. If MCData user 1 is authorised MCData client 1 sends a MCData standalone
data request towards the MCData client 2. The MCData standalone data request
contains conversation identifier for message thread indication. The MCData
standalone data request may contain disposition request if indicated by the
user at MCData client 1. If MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an
MCData emergency communication, then emergency indicator is included in the
MCData standalone data request. If an MCData emergency state is not set
already when MCData emergency communication is initiated, the MCData client 1
sets its MCData emergency state and is retained until explicitly cancelled.
The value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to the state of
the MCData communication.
3\. On receiving a MCData standalone data request, the MCData client 2 checks
whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or
content to certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege.
4\. If the policy assertion is positive and the payload is for MCData user
consumption (e.g. is not application data, is not command instructions, etc.)
then the MCData user of MCData client 2 may be notified. Otherwise if the
payload is not for MCData user consumption, then the MCData user of MCData
client 2 shall not be notified. The action taken when the payload contains
application data or command instructions are specific based on the contents of
the payload. Payload content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to
a known local non-MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the
MCData client 2 to start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start
application) and shall pass the payload content to the just started
application.
NOTE: If the policy assertion was negative, the MCData client 2 sends an
appropriate notification to MCData client 1.
5\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report.
#### 7.4.3.4 Group standalone short data service using signalling control
plane
##### 7.4.3.4.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone SDS to a selected group results in off-
network MCData group members receiving the SDS data.
##### 7.4.3.4.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.3.4.2-1 describes procedures for an off-network MCData client 1
initiating group MCData data communication for sending SDS data to a MCData
group, with or without disposition request. The SDS data size limit is pre-
configured.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user 1 has initiated group communication for sending SDS data to
the MCData group.
2\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCData
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCData
client 1.
3\. MCData client 1 to MCData client N are members of the same MCData group.
Figure 7.4.3.4.2-1: Group standalone short data service using signalling
control plane
1\. MCData client 1 checks whether the MCData user 1 is authorized to send
MCData group standalone data request.
2\. If MCData user 1 is authorised MCData client 1 sends a MCData group
standalone data request towards the MCData group. The MCData group standalone
data request contains conversation identifier for message thread indication.
The MCData group standalone data request may contain disposition request if
indicated by the user at MCData client 1. If MCData group standalone data
request contains disposition request, MCData group standalone data request
shall also contain the IP address of the MCData client 1. If MCData user at
the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency communication, then the
emergency indicator or the imminent peril indicator is included in the MCData
standalone data request. If an MCData emergency state is not set already when
MCData emergency communication is initiated, the MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state and is retained until explicitly cancelled. The value
of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to the state of the MCData
communication.
3\. On receiving a MCData group standalone data request, the MCData clients
check whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message
or content to certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege.
4\. If the policy assertion is positive and the payload is for MCData user
consumption (e.g. is not application data, is not command instructions, etc.)
then the MCData user may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for
MCData user consumption, then the MCData user shall not be notified. The
action taken when the payload contains application data or command
instructions are specific based on the contents of the payload. Payload
content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to a known local non-
MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the MCData client 2 to
start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start application) and
shall pass the payload content to the just started application.
NOTE: If the policy assertion was negative, the MCData client sends an
appropriate notification to MCData client 1.
5\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData clients initiate a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report.
#### 7.4.3.5 Providing data for a user entering an ongoing MCData group
conversation
##### 7.4.3.5.1 General
The MCData service shall support mechanisms that allow a MCData user be
presented with the whole content of a group conversation in a group that he is
a member of. This includes the content (messages) exchanged before the MCData
user joins the group conversation.
##### 7.4.3.5.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.3.5.2-1 describes procedures for a MCData user joins late to a
group conversation.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData group is provisioned for lossless communication.
2\. All members of the MCData group have an account created in the MCData
message store.
3\. MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 are members of the
same MCData group,
4\. MCData client 1 and 2 are served by MCData server 1 and have registered
and affiliated to the MCData group.
5\. MCData client 3 is served by MCData server 2 and has not affiliated to the
MCData group yet.
NOTE 1: The interactions of MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 to MCData
message store are not shown in the figure.
Figure 7.4.3.5.2-1: Providing data for a user entering an ongoing MCData group
conversation
1\. A group conversation is initiated according to procedures in subclause
7.4.2.6, and all members of the group are invited into the communication
whether affiliated or not. As MCData user 3 is not affiliated at this time,
MCData server 2 accepts the invitation to the group conversation on behalf of
MCData user 3.
2\. The media plane is established for the group conversation. MCData server 2
is in the media plane to receive the conversation on behalf of MCData user 3.
3\. MCData server 2 stores the received conversation to MCData user 3 account
in the MCData message store.
NOTE 2: If the received conversation requests delivery notification the MCData
server 2 will send message delivered to the message sender. If the received
conversation requests read notification the MCData client 3 will send message
read to the message sender once it has presented the message to the user.
4\. MCData user 3 is online and using MCData client 3 to affiliate to the
MCData group.
5\. MCData client 3, through the message store client, synchronizes with the
MCData user 3 account in the MCData message store.
6\. MCData server 2 invites MCData client 3 to the MCData group conversation.
7\. MCData user 3 joins the MCData group conversation.
#### 7.4.3.6 Group standalone short data service with MCData message store
##### 7.4.3.6.1 General
A MCData user\'s off-network communication needs to be part of his
communication history when the MCData user has an account in the MCData
message store.
##### 7.4.3.6.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.3.5.2-1 describes procedures of a MCData user, MCData user 2, that
has an account in MCData message store and how his off-network SDS group
communication is stored in his account in the MCData message store. All other
MCData clients in the figure follow the procedures described in subclause
7.4.3.4.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user 1 to N are in an off-network group communication.
2\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCData
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured to MCData
client 1 to N.
3\. MCData client 1 to N are members of the same MCData group.
4\. MCData user 2 has an account in the MCData message store.
Figure 7.4.3.6.2-1: Group standalone short data service with MCData message
store
1\. MCData client 1 to MCData client N are in an off-network group
communication according to the procedures in subclause 7.4.3.4, SDS are
exchanged among all MCData clients.
2\. If the SDS is for MCData user consumption, the SDS is stored in the local
message store on the MCData UE of MCData user 2.
NOTE: A pre-configured folder for off-network communication objects can be
provisioned both on the UE and the user account on the MCData message store to
be used for synchronization.
3\. The off-network group communication comes to an end.
4\. The MCData user 2 connects back to the network.
5\. The MCData user 2 decides to keep the off-network communication in his
account on the MCData message store. The message store client 2 uploads the

#### 7.5.2.2 File upload using HTTP
##### 7.5.2.2.1 General
The media storage client uses HTTP for a standalone data file upload towards
the MCData content server.
##### 7.5.2.2.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.2.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
uploading a file to media storage function on the MCData content server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData user on the media storage client is registered for receiving
MCData service.
2\. The MCData content server has the ability to verify if the requesting
MCData user is authorised to upload.
Figure 7.5.2.2.2-1: File upload using HTTP
1\. The user at the media storage client initiates a file upload request of
the chosen file. If MCData emergency state is already set for the media
storage client (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert), the media
storage client sets emergency indicator in the request. The media storage
client verifies that the size of the file is within the maximum data size for
FD for the intended MCData FD request (by checking the group configuration for
a group FD request and by checking the service configuration for a one-to-one
FD request).
2\. The file to be uploaded is received by the media storage client and sent
to the media storage function on the MCData content server for storing using
the MCData upload data request.
3\. The MCData content server may apply transmission control policy before
storage and provides a MCData upload data response indicating success (along
with file URL to the media storage client) or failure.
#### 7.5.2.3 File download using HTTP
##### 7.5.2.3.1 General
The media storage client uses HTTP for a standalone data file download from
the MCData content server.
##### 7.5.2.3.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.3.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
downloading a file from the media storage function of the MCData content
server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData user on the media storage client is registered for receiving
MCData service.
Figure 7.5.2.3.2-1: File download using HTTP
1\. The user at the media storage client initiates a file download request
available at the indicated URL.
2\. The file available at the URL (received in MCData FD request or MCData
group standalone FD request) is requested to be downloaded by the media
storage client from the media storage function on the MCData content server
using a MCData download data request. If emergency indicator is set in
received in MCData FD request or MCData group standalone FD request, the media
storage client sets emergency indicator in MCData download data request.
NOTE: the Media storage client can perform partial download requests to
complete the missing parts after an incomplete transmission.
3\. The media storage function on the MCData content server may apply
reception control policy and provides a MCData download data response
including the file to the media storage client.
#### 7.5.2.4 One-to-one file distribution using HTTP
##### 7.5.2.4.1 General
The MCData client uses HTTP file distribution to download a file that is
uploaded by another MCData client. The procedure is appropriate for both
mandatory and non-mandatory download cases.
##### 7.5.2.4.2 Procedure for single MCData system
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.4.2-1 describes the case where a MCData user is
initiating one-to-one data communication for sending file to the other MCData
user, with or without download completed report request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData client 1 and the MCData client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCData service.
2\. File to be distributed is uploaded to media storage function on MCData
content server using the procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.2.
3\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
4\. The MCData server has subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.5.2.4.2-1: One-to-one file distribution using HTTP
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
the chosen MCData user.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends a MCData FD request towards the MCData server.
The MCData FD request contains content payload in the form of file URL and may
contain the file metadata information. The MCData FD request contains one
MCData user for one-to-one data communication as selected by the user at
MCData client 1. The MCData FD request contains conversation identifier for
message thread indication. If MCData user at MCData client 1 has requested to
mandatory download at the recipient side, then MCData FD request contains
mandatory download indication. The MCData FD request may contain download
completed report indication if selected by the user at MCData client 1. MCData
user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within the FD data
transfer.
a) If the MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency
file distribution using HTTP or MCData emergency state is already set for the
MCData client 1 (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) The MCData FD request shall contain emergency indicator; and
ii) If MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData FD request and that the size of the file is below
maximum data size for FD from the service configuration. MCData server
verifies whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and
has been activated for the user.
4\. The MCData server also applies transmission and reception control and the
necessary policy control to ensure that appropriate data is transmitted
between the MCData users.
5\. MCData server initiates the MCData FD request towards the MCData user. The
MCData FD request towards the MCData user contains an emergency indicator if
it is present in the received MCData FD request from MCData client 1.
6\. The receiving MCData client 2 notifies the user about the incoming MCData
FD request (including file metadata, if present) which may be either accepted
or rejected or ignored.
7\. MCData user 2 may provide a response (accept or reject) or not (ignore) to
the notification, then MCData client 2 sends the MCData FD response to the
MCData server. MCData client 2 automatically sends accepted MCData FD response
when the incoming request includes mandatory download indication.
8\. The MCData server forwards the MCData FD response to the MCData client 1.
9\. Media storage client of MCData client 2 downloads the file using the
procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.3, either automatically (for mandatory
download) or based upon the MCData user 2 subsequent action. The MCData client
2 records file download completed and notifies MCData user 2.
10\. MCData client 2 initiates a MCData download completed report for
reporting file download completed, if requested by the user at MCData client
1.
11\. The MCData file download completed report from MCData user may be stored
by the MCData server for download history interrogation from the authorized
MCData users. MCData download completed report is sent by the MCData server to
the MCData user at MCData client 1.
##### 7.5.2.4.3 Procedure with interconnection between MCData systems
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.4.3-1 describes the case where a MCData user
initiates a one-to-one data communication for sending a file to another MCData
user where that other MCData user is receiving MCData service on a partner
MCData system, and where interconnection is in use between the two MCData
systems. In this procedure, the file has not previously been downloaded in the
partner MC system.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData client 1 and the MCData client 2 are
already service authorized and receiving MCData service. MCData client 1 is
receiving service on its primary MCData system, and MCData client 2 is
receiving MCData service in the partner MCData system of MCData client 1.
2\. The file to be distributed has been uploaded to the media storage function
on the MCData content server in the primary MCData system of MCData client 1
using the procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.2.
3\. There is a service agreement between the primary and partner MCData
systems to allow files to be shared between MCData content servers in the two
systems.
Figure 7.5.2.4.3-1: One-to-one file distribution using HTTP with
interconnection
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
the MCData user at MCData client 2.
2\. MCData client 1 sends an MCData FD request towards the primary MCData
server. The MCData FD request contains content payload in the form of a file
URL with the necessary access authorization information and may contain the
file metadata information. The MCData FD request indicates the target MCData
user for the one-to-one data communication. The MCData FD request contains a
conversation identifier for message thread indication. If the MCData user at
MCData client 1 has requested to mandatory download at the recipient side,
then the MCData FD request contains the mandatory download indication. The
MCData FD request may contain a request for a download completed report
indication if selected by the user at MCData client 1.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send the MCData FD request and that the size of the file is
below maximum data size for FD from the service configuration.
4\. The MCData server in the primary MCData system initiates the MCData FD
request towards the MCData server in the partner MCData system, which contains
the URL of the file which is stored in the primary MCData content server. The
request includes the necessary access authorization information as MCData
client 2 will retrieve the file while receiving service in the partner MCData
system.
NOTE 1: The contents of and mechanisms to use the authorization information
are outside the scope of the present document.
5\. The partner MCData server sends the MCData FD request to MCData client 2.
The file URL being provided in MCData FD request to MCData client 2 is
prepended with server URI of the partner MCData content server, such that the
URL identifies a file location in the partner MCData content server.
6\. The receiving MCData client 2 may notify the user about the incoming
MCData FD request (including file metadata, if present) which may be either
accepted, rejected or ignored.
7\. MCData user 2 may provide a response (accept or reject) or not (ignore) to
the notification, then MCData client 2 sends the MCData FD response to the
partner MCData server. MCData client 2 automatically sends an accepted MCData
FD response when the incoming request includes mandatory download indication.
8\. The partner MCData server forwards the MCData FD response to the MCData
server in the primary MCData system.
9\. The primary MCData server forwards the MCData FD response to MCData client
1.
10\. MCData client 2 requests the file from the partner MCData content server.
NOTE 2: Step 10 may occur any time after step 7, before or after steps 8 and
9.
11\. The partner MCData content server checks whether the file is stored
locally, and if this is not the case, sends an MCData file retrieve request to
the primary MCData content server. The MCData file retrieve request contains
the URL of the file location in the primary MCData system, generated by
removing the prepended local path from the requested URL.
NOTE 3: The means of proving authorization for the request is outside the
scope of the present document.
12\. The primary MCData content server responds to the partner MCData content
server with an MCData file retrieve response which contains the content of the
file to be retrieved. File metadata may include the lifetime of the file. The
primary MCData content server records that the file has been sent to the
indicated partner MCData system.
NOTE 4: The partner MCData content server may store the local copy of the file
in case future requests arise until the expiry time sent from the primary
MCData system for the file is reached or until a request is received to delete
the file.
13\. The partner MCData content server sends the file to MCData client 2 in
the MCData download data response. MCData client 2 records file download
completed and notifies MCData user 2.
14\. MCData client 2 initiates an MCData download complete report for
reporting file download completed, if this was requested by the user at MCData
client 1 in the initial MCData FD request.
15\. The MCData download complete report is sent to the primary MCData server.
The partner MCData server may store the download complete report for download
history interrogation from authorized MCData users in the partner MCData
system.
16\. The MCData download completed report is sent by the primary MCData server
to the MCData user at MCData client 1. The MCData file download completed
report from MCData user may be stored by the primary MCData server for
download history interrogation from authorized MCData users in the primary
MCData system.
#### 7.5.2.5 One-to-one file distribution using media plane

the MCData client 1 (due to previously trigerred MCData emergency alert):
i) The MCData FD request shall contain emergency indicator; and
> ii) If MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
> MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state is retained until
> explicitly cancelled.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData FD request. MCData server verifies whether the
provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for
the user.
4\. The MCData server also applies transmission and reception control and the
necessary policy to ensure that appropriate data is transmitted between the
MCData UEs.
5\. MCData server initiates the MCData FD request towards the MCData user. The
MCData FD request towards the MCData user contains the emergency indicator if
it is present in the received MCData FD request from MCData client 1.
6\. The receiving MCData client 2 notifies the user about the incoming MCData
FD request (including file metadata, if present) which may be either accepted
or rejected or ignored. If the request includes mandatory download indication
in the MCData FD request an accepted response is assumed.
7\. If the target MCData user 2 provides a response (accept or reject) to the
notification, then the MCData client 2 sends the MCData FD response to the
MCData server. MCData client 2 automatically sends accepted MCData FD response
when the incoming request included mandatory download indication.
8\. MCData server forwards the MCData FD response from MCData client 2 back to
MCData client 1.
9\. MCData client 1 distributes the file over the established media plane to
MCData server.
10\. MCData server distributes the file received from MCData client 1 to
MCData client 2 over the established media plane. File download report is
shared by the MCData client 2, if requested by the user at MCData client 1.
After file transaction is completed, the media plane is released. The MCData
client 2 records file download completed and notifies MCData user 2.
NOTE: MCData server is not required to wait for the complete download of file
from MCData client 1 prior to initiating file distribution to MCData client 2.
11\. MCData client 2 initiates a MCData download completed report for
reporting file download completed, if requested by the user at MCData client
1.
12\. The MCData file download completed report from MCData client may be
stored by the MCData server for download history interrogation from the
authorized MCData users. MCData download completed report is sent by the
MCData server to the user at MCData client 1.
#### 7.5.2.6 Group standalone file distribution using HTTP
##### 7.5.2.6.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone FD using HTTP to a selected group,
results in affiliated group members receiving the file data.
##### 7.5.2.6.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.6.2-1 describes the case where a MCData user is
initiating group standalone data communication for sending file to multiple
MCData users, with or without download completed report request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData client 1 to n belong to the same group and
are already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
2\. File to be distributed is uploaded to media storage function on MCData
content server using the procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.2.
3\. Optionally, the MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be
used.
> 4\. The MCData server has subscribed to the MCData functional alias
> controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
> activation updates.
Figure 7.5.2.6.2-1: Group standalone FD using HTTP
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
multiple MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified by MCData
group ID) and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends a MCData group standalone FD request towards the
MCData server. The MCData FD request contains content payload in the form of
file URL and may contain the file metadata information. The MCData group
standalone data request contains either the selected MCData group ID or the
target recipients as selected by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData group
standalone FD request contains conversation identifier for message thread
indication. If MCData user at MCData client 1 has requested to mandatory
download at the recipient side, then MCData group standalone FD request
contains mandatory download indication. The MCData group standalone FD request
may contain download completed report indication if selected by the user at
MCData client 1. MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias
within the FD data transfer.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency FD
communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for the MCData
client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) the MCData group standalone FD request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii) the MCData group standalone FD request shall set an alert indicator if
configured to send an MCData emergency alert while initiating an MCData group
standalone FD request for the emergency FD communication;
iii) if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets
its MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled; and
iv) once an MCData emergency communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until cancelled;
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData imminent peril FD
communication:
i) the MCData group standalone FD request shall contain imminent peril
indicator; and
ii) once an MCData imminent peril communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled.
2a. If either emergency indicator or imminent peril indicator is present in
the received MCData group standalone FD request, the MCData server implicitly
affiliates MCData client 1 to the MCData group if the client is not already
affiliated.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData group standalone FD request and that the size of the
file is below maximum data size for FD from the group configuration. MCData
server verifies whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used
and has been activated for the user. If the MCData group ID is used, the
MCData server resolves the MCData group ID to determine the members of that
group and their affiliation status, based on the information from the group
management server.
i) If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
emergency state, the MCData group is consider to be in the in-progress
emergency state until cancelled;
ii) If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
imminent peril state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
imminent peril state until cancelled;
4\. The MCData server also applies transmission and reception control and the
necessary policy control to ensure that appropriate data is transmitted
between the MCData users.
5\. MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone FD request towards
each MCData user determined in step 3. The MCData group standalone FD request
towards each MCData client contains:
i) an emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request from the MCData client 1;
ii) an imminent peril indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request from the MCData client 1; and
iii) an alert indicator if requested to initiate an emergency alert in the
received MCData group standalone FD request from the MCData client 1.
6\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n notify the user about the incoming
MCData group standalone FD request (including file metadata, if present) which
may be either accepted or rejected or ignored.
7\. MCData user on MCData clients 2 to n provides a response (accept or reject
or ignore) to the notification, then respective MCData client sends the MCData
group standalone FD response to the MCData server. MCData client 2 to n
automatically sends accepted MCData group standalone FD response when the
incoming request included mandatory download indication.
8\. The MCData server forwards the MCData group standalone FD responses to the
MCData client 1.
NOTE: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 9
depending on the conditions to proceed with the file transmission.
9\. Media storage client of the MCData client(s) downloads the file using the
procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.3, either automatically (for mandatory
download) or based upon the MCData user subsequent action. The MCData clients
successfully receiving the file through the media storage clients, record file
download completed and notify MCData users.
10\. The MCData clients, successfully receiving the file through the media
storage client, initiate a MCData download completed reports for reporting
file download completed, if requested by the user at MCData client 1.
11\. The MCData file download completed reports from MCData clients may be
stored by the MCData server for download history interrogation from the
authorized MCData users. The MCData file download completed report from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
12\. Aggregated or individual MCData download completed report is sent by the
MCData server to the MCData user at MCData client 1.
#### 7.5.2.7 Group standalone file distribution using media plane
##### 7.5.2.7.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone FD using media plane to a selected group,
results in affiliated group members receiving the file data.
##### 7.5.2.7.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.7.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating group standalone data communication for sending file to multiple
MCData users, with or without download completed report request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData client 1 to n belong to the same group and
are already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
> 2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have an activated functional alias to
> be used.
3\. The MCData server has subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.5.2.7.2-1: Group standalone FD using media plane
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
multiple MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified by MCData
group ID) and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData group standalone FD request towards the
MCData server. The MCData group standalone FD request may contain the file
metadata information. The MCData group standalone data request contains target
recipient(s) as selected by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData group
standalone FD request contains conversation identifier for message thread
indication. MCData group standalone FD request may contain mandatory download
indication. The MCData group standalone FD request may contain download
completed report indication if selected by the user at MCData client 1. MCData
user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within the FD data
transfer.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency file
distribution communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for
the MCData client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) the MCData group standalone FD request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii) the MCData group standalone FD request shall set an alert indicator if
configured to send an MCData emergency alert while initiating an MCData group
standalone FD request for the emergency file distribution service
communication;
iii) if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets
its MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled; and
iv) once an MCData emergency communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until cancelled;
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData imminent peril short
data service communication:
i) the MCData group standalone FD request shall contain imminent peril
indicator; and
ii) once an MCData imminent peril communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled.
2a. If either emergency indicator or imminent peril indicator is present in
the received MCData group standalone data request, the MCData server
implicitly affiliates MCData client 1 to the MCData group if the client is not
already affiliated.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData group standalone FD request. MCData server verifies
whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been
activated for the user. The MCData server resolves the MCData group ID to
determine the members of that group and their affiliation status, based on the
information from the group management server.
i) If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
emergency state, the MCData group is consider to be in the in-progress
emergency state until cancelled;
ii) If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
imminent peril state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
imminent peril state until cancelled;
4\. The MCData server also applies transmission and reception control and the
necessary policy to ensure that appropriate data is transmitted between the
MCData UEs.
5\. MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone FD request towards
each MCData user determined in step 3. The MCData group standalone data
request towards each MCData client contains:
i) an emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request from the MCData client 1;
ii) an imminent peril indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request from the MCData client 1; and
iii) an alert indicator if requested to initiate an emergency alert in the
received MCData group standalone FD request from the MCData client 1.
6\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n notifies the user about the incoming
MCData group standalone FD request (including file metadata if present) which
may be either accepted or rejected or ignored. If the request includes
mandatory download indication in the MCData group standalone FD request an
accepted response is assumed.
7\. If the target MCData user on MCData clients 2 to n provides a response
(accept or reject) to the notification, then the respective MCData client
sends the MCData group standalone FD response to the MCData server. MCData
client 2 to n automatically sends accepted MCData group standalone FD response
when the incoming request included mandatory download indication.
8\. MCData server forwards the MCData group standalone FD response to the
MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 9
depending on the conditions to proceed with the file transmission.
9\. MCData client 1 and MCData server have successfully established media
plane for file transmission and the MCData client 1 transmits the file data.
10\. MCData server distributes the file received from MCData client 1 to
MCData clients 2 to n over the established media plane. Distribution of file
can be via unicast or via MBMS bearer(s). For distribution via MBMS bearer(s),
the procedure described in subclause 7.3 Use of MBMS transmission (on-network)
is executed. File download report is shared by the receiving MCData clients,
if requested by the user at MCData client 1\. After file transaction is
completed, the media plane is released.
NOTE 2: MCData server is not required to wait for the complete download of
file from MCData client 1 prior to initiating file distribution to MCData
client 2.
11\. The MCData clients successfully receiving the file, records file download
completed and notifies MCData user.
12\. MCData client 2 initiates a MCData download completed report for
reporting file download completed, if requested by the user at MCData client
1.
13\. The MCData file download completed report from MCData client(s) may be
stored by the MCData server for download history interrogation from the
authorized MCData users. The MCData file download completed report from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
14\. Aggregated or individual MCData file download completed report is sent to
the disposition requesting user at MCData client 1.
#### 7.5.2.8 File removal using HTTP by authorized user
##### 7.5.2.8.1 General
The media storage client uses HTTP to remove a file that was previously
uploaded to the MCData content server.
##### 7.5.2.8.2 Procedure for single MCData system
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.8.2-1 describes the case where a MCData user is
removing the file that was previously uploaded to the MCData content server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData user on the media storage client is registered for receiving
MCData service.
2\. The file has been successfully uploaded by the MCData user using the
procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.2.
3\. The MCData content server has the ability to verify if the requesting
MCData user is authorised to remove.
Figure 7.5.2.8.2-1: File removal using HTTP by authorised user
1\. The user on the media storage client decides to remove a file that was
previously uploaded.
2\. The URL of the file to be removed is included in the request sent to the
media storage function on the MCData content server.
3\. The MCData content server remove the file indicated by the URL.
4\. The MCData content server informs the media storage client if the file is
successfully removed.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS if and how the recipients of the file URL need to be
notified if the file is no longer available to be downloaded
##### 7.5.2.8.3 Procedure for interconnection between MCData systems
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.8.3-1 describes the case where an MCData user
removes the file that was previously uploaded to the primary MCData system
MCData content server, and where the file has been made available in the
partner MCData system MCData content server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData user on the media storage client is registered for receiving
MCData service.
2\. The file has previously been uploaded to the MCData content server in the
primary MCData system of MCData client 1.
3\. The file has been successfully transferred to the MCData content server in
the partner MCData system.
Figure 7.5.2.8.3-1: File removal using HTTP by authorized user
1\. The user on the media storage client decides to remove a file that was
previously uploaded.
2\. The URL of the file to be removed is included in the request sent to the
media storage function on the primary MCData content server.
3\. The primary MCData content server removes the file indicated by the URL.
NOTE: Step 3 may occur at any time following step 2 and before step 6.
4\. As the primary MCData content server has recorded that the file has
previously been sent to the partner MCData system, the primary MCData content
server sends the MCData remove file request by user to the partner MCData
content server, containing the URL of the file which was stored on the primary
MCData content server.
5\. The partner MCData content server removes the file indicated by the URL.
6\. The partner MCData content server informs the primary MCData content
server that the file has been successfully removed.
7\. The primary MCData content server informs the media storage client if the
file is successfully removed.
> Editor\'s note: It is FFS if and how the recipients of the file URL need to
> be notified if the file is no longer available to be downloaded
#### 7.5.2.9 Void
#### 7.5.2.10 Group standalone file distribution using the MBMS download
delivery method
##### 7.5.2.10.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone FD to a selected group results in
affiliated group members receiving the file data over MBMS.
The first steps of the procedure are identical to the procedure Group
standalone file distribution using HTTP (7.5.2.6). Based on the density and
distribution of target group members, the MCData server may decide to deliver
the file over MBMS.
##### 7.5.2.10.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.10.2-1 describes the case where a MCData user is
initiating group standalone data communication for sending file to multiple
MCData users, with or without download completed report request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData client 1 to n belong to the same group and
are already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
2\. File to be distributed is uploaded to media storage function on MCData
content server using the procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.2.
Figure 7.5.2.10.2-1: Group standalone FD using the MBMS download delivery
method
1-4. Steps 1-4 are the same as in the procedure for Group standalone FD using
HTTP (7.5.2.6).
5\. The MCData server executes the procedure described in subclause 7.3.5 Use
of MBMS user services for file distribution. The MCData server provides, in
the MBMS session properties (subclause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 26.348 [19]), the file
location on the media storage function and sets the earlier fetch time with a
long enough delay so that steps 6 to 8 are executed before the delivery over
MBMS.
6\. MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone FD over MBMS request
towards each MCData user determined in step 3. The request is sent over
unicast or within an MBMS bearer for application level control signalling.
7\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n notify the user about the incoming
MCData group standalone FD request (including file metadata, if present).
8\. MCData client 2 to n automatically sends accepted MCData group standalone
FD response when the incoming request included mandatory download indication.
NOTE 1: When the UE is in idle mode, MCData clients may skip step 8.
9\. The MCData server forwards the MCData group standalone FD responses to the
MCData client 1.
NOTE 2: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 6, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the file transmission.
10\. The MCData client receives the file delivered over MBMS.
11\. If losses occurred after the end of the file delivery over MBMS, the
MCData client downloads the missing parts using the procedures defined in
subclause 7.5.2.
Editor\'s note: whether any enhancements are required on MCData-FD5 are FFS.
NOTE 3: If the MBMS reception quality is too bad, the Media storage client of
the MCData client(s) downloads the file using the procedures defined in
subclause 7.5.2.3.
12\. The MCData clients, after a successfully reception, initiate a MCData
download completed reports for reporting file download completed, if requested
by the user at MCData client 1.
13\. The MCData file download completed reports from MCData clients may be
stored by the MCData server for download history interrogation from the
authorized MCData users. The MCData file download completed report from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
14\. Aggregated or individual MCData download completed report is sent by the
MCData server to the MCData user at MCData client 1.

MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 are affiliated to that
MCData group.
2\. All members of the MCData group belong to the same MCData system.
3\. An MCData group FD communication is already in progress.
4\. The initiating MCData client 1 has been configured to send an MCData
emergency alert when upgrading an MCData emergency group communication.
Figure 7.5.2.12-1: MCData group FD communication upgraded to an MCData
emergency group FD communcation
1\. The MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates a group emergency. MCData
client 1 sets its MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state is
retained until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCData client 1 requests the MCData server to upgrade the MCData group to
an in-progress emergency state by sending a MCData group FD upgrade request.
The MCData client 1 sets emergency indicator in the request. If configured to
send an MCData alert when initiating an MCData emergency upgrade, the request
also contains an indication that an MCData alert is to be initiated.
3\. The MCData server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all or
selected participants in the MCData group FD communication that receive the

group FD communication.
#### 7.5.2.13 Group FD communication in-progress emergency group state cancel
##### 7.5.2.13.1 General
This clause is for adding procedures related to an MCData in-progress
emergency group state cancel.
##### 7.5.2.13.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.13-1 describes the case where an authorized
MCData user cancels MCData group\'s in-progress emergency.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 affiliated to that MCData
group.
2\. All members of the MCData group belong to the same MCData system.
3\. MCData group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.
4\. The MCData group is in the in-progress emergency state and has prioritized
bearer support.
5\. MCData client 1 previously initiated the in-progress emergency for the
group.
Figure 7.5.2.13-1: MCData group FD in-progress emergency group state cancel
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData group FD in-progress
emergency group state cancel.
NOTE 1: An MCData user authorized to cancel in-progress emergencies on the
MCData group can also be authorised to cancel the MCData emergency alert in
addition to the initiator. However, only the initiator can cancel the
initiator\'s local MCData emergency state.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends an MCData group FD in-progress priority state
cancel request to the MCData server. The MCData client 1 also resets emergency
indicator in the request to inform MCData server about cancelation of in-
progress emergency group state.
NOTE 2: When MCData emergency alerts are in effect together with an MCData in-
progress emergency group state on the same MCData group, the MCData emergency
alert can, under some circumstances be cancelled at the same time. In that
case, the MCData group FD in-progress priority group state cancel request
carries an indication that the alert is also being cancelled.
3\. The MCData server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required. The MCData server cancels/resets the
emergency in-progress state of the MCData group.
4\. The MCData server sends an MCData group FD in-progress priority state
cancel request to the MCData group members.
5\. MCData group members are notified of the MCData group FD in-progress
emergency state cancel.
6\. The receiving MCData clients send the MCData group FD in-progress priority
state cancel response to the MCData server to acknowledge the MCData in-
progress emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these
acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCData server sends the MCData group FD in-progress priority state
cancel response to the MCData user 1 to confirm the MCData in-progress
emergency group state cancel. If the MCData in-progress emergency group state
cancel request (in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCData
client 1 resets its local emergency status.

Figure 7.5.3.3.2-1: One-to-one standalone file distribution using media plane
1\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData FD request towards the MCData client 2\.
The MCData FD request may contain the file metadata information. The MCData FD
request contains one MCData user for one-to-one data communication as selected
by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData FD request contains conversation
identifier for message thread indication. MCData FD request may contain
mandatory download indication. The MCData FD request may contain download
completed report indication if selected by the user at MCData client 1.
2\. On receiving a MCData FD request, the MCData client 2 checks whether any
policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or content to
certain members, for example, due to location or user privilege.
3\. The receiving MCData client 2 notifies the user about the incoming MCData
FD request (including file metadata if present) which may be either accepted
or rejected or ignored. MCData user may not be sought consent if the request
includes mandatory download indication in the MCData FD request and instead
only notify the MCData user about file downloading.
4\. If the target MCData user 2 provides a response (accept or reject) to the
notification, then the MCData client 2 sends the MCData FD response to the
MCData client 1. MCData client 2 automatically sends accepted MCData FD
response when the incoming request included mandatory download indication.
5\. MCData client 1 distributes the file over the established media plane to
MCData client 2.

1\. MCData user selects the data to transmit and the recipient MCData user or
MCData group. The MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a functional
alias used within the SDS data transmission.
2\. MCData client checks for MCData user\'s permission to transmit data and
checks if the data size is less than the maximum data size for SDS. MCData
client calculates the total transmission request size and determines to select
one of the appropriate procedures described in subclause 7.4.2.2, 7.4.2.3,
7.4.2.5 or 7.4.2.6.
3\. Transmission control on the MCData server verifies if the MCData user is
authorized to transmit and the data size in the received transmission request
does not exceed the maximum data size for SDS. MCData server verifies whether
the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated
for the MCData user.
4\. MCData server may send one of the following MCData control indications:
a) If the MCData user does not have permission to transmit data to another
MCData user or MCData group then the \"No permission to transmit data\"
control indication is sent.
b) If the selected transmission is for a MCData group and there are no
affiliated group members, then the transmission control on MCData server sends
the \"No affiliated members found to the selected MCData group\" control
indication.
c) MCData server may queue the data transmit request for later transmission
with control indication \"Request to transmit is queued\".
Otherwise continue with step 5.
5\. MCData server automatically transmits the data and, if available, the
functional alias of the originating MCData client 1 to the selected MCData
user or the affiliated members or all group members (in the case of lossless
communication) of the selected MCData group according to the procedures
selected in step 2.
#### 7.6.2.3 Send data with mandatory download
##### 7.6.2.3.1 General

3\. Transmission control on the MCData server verifies if the MCData user is
authorized to transmit, the data size in the received transmission request is
within the maximum size allowed for FD transmission and is within the maximum
amount of time that a MCData user can transmit in a single request. MCData
server verifies whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used
and has been activated for the MCData user.
4\. MCData server may send one of the following MCData control indications:
a) If the MCData user does not have permission to transmit data to another
MCData user or MCData group then the \"No permission to transmit data\"
control indication is sent.
b) If the data size requested to be transmitted is more than the maximum
amount of data that an MCData user can transmit in a single request, the
transmission control on MCData server rejects the data transmission request
and sends the rejection control indication \"Rejected due to exceeding data
transmit size\".
c) If the data transmission time exceeds the maximum amount of time that an
MCData user can transmit in a single request, the transmission control on
MCData server rejects the data transmission request and sends the rejection
control indication \"Rejected due to exceeding data transmit time\".
d) If the selected transmission is for a MCData group and there are no
affiliated group members, then the transmission control on MCData server sends
the \"No affiliated members found to the selected MCData group\" control
indication.
e) MCData server may queue the data transmit request for later transmission
with control indication \"Request to transmit is queued\".
Otherwise continue with step 5.

of the originating MCData client 1 to the selected MCData user or the
affiliated members or all group members (in the case of lossless
communication) of the selected MCData group according to the procedures
selected in step 2 (where the recipient MCData client receives the data
automatically).
#### 7.6.2.4 Send data without mandatory download
##### 7.6.2.4.1 General
The send data without mandatory download procedure allows the receiving MCData
client to accept download, defer download (i.e. no response) or refuse (e.g.
by the user deleting the notification item) the data sent from the sending
MCData client.
##### 7.6.2.4.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.6.2.4.2-1 describes the case where MCData user
selected data is subjected to transmission control prior to transmitting data
to the selected recipient user or affiliated members of the selected MCData
group for downloading with recipient MCData user consent.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user is configured with permission to transmit data.
2\. Maximum amount of data or time that an MCData user can transmit in a
single request is configured.
3\. Time limit for the temporarily stored data waiting to be delivered to a
receiving user is configured.
4\. Optionally, MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be
used.
5\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.6.2.4.2-1: Send data without mandatory download
1\. MCData user selects the data to transmit and the recipient MCData user or
MCData group and does not select the mandatory download indication. The MCData
user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias used within the data
transmission.
2\. MCData client has checked for MCData user\'s permission to transmit data
and the data size is within the maximum data size allowed. The MCData client
calculates the total transmission request size and determines to select
procedure described in subclause 7.5.2.4 or 7.5.2.6 and without including the
mandatory download indication.
3\. Transmission control on the MCData server verifies if the MCData user is
authorized to transmit, the data size in the received transmission request is
within the maximum data size allowed and is within the maximum amount of time
that a MCData user can transmit in a single request. MCData server verifies
whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been
activated for the MCData user.
4\. MCData server may send one of the following control indications:
a) If the MCData user does not have permission to transmit data to another
MCData user or MCData group then the \"No permission to transmit data\"
control indication is sent.
b) If the selected transmission is for a MCData group and there are no
affiliated group members, then the transmission control on MCData server sends
the \"No affiliated members found to the selected MCData group\" control
indication.
c) If the data size requested to be transmitted is more than the maximum
amount of data that an MCData user can transmit in a single request, the
transmission control on MCData server rejects the data transmission requests
and sends the rejection control indication \"Rejected due to exceeding data
transmit size\".
d) If the data transmission time exceeds the maximum amount of time that an
MCData user can transmit in a single request (applies to DS only), the
transmission control on MCData server rejects the data transmission request
and sends the rejection control indication \"Rejected due to exceeding data
transmit time\".
e) MCData server may queue the data transmit request for later transmission
with a control indication \"Request to transmit is queued\".
Otherwise, continue with step 5.
5\. MCData server transmits the data and, if available, the functional alias
of the originating MCData client 1 to the selected MCData user or the
affiliated members or all group members (in the case of lossless
communication) of the selected MCData group according to the procedures
selected in step 2 (where the recipient MCData client may receive the data
automatically).
6\. The MCData server may store the data in temporary storage (e.g. if the
recipient is not available at the time of data delivery or network congestion
or data deferred by the user) and may send MCData indication to notify the
recipient of available data for retrieval:
a) If the timer expired for periodic announcement with the list of available
recently invited data communications, the recipient MCData client waiting to
receive the temporarily stored data receives MCData indication with the list
of available temporarily stored data waiting to download in the Deferred data
list .
b) If the temporarily stored data is expired, the data may be purged from the
temporary store and the recipient MCData user may be informed in MCData
indication with \"Data expired and not available to download anymore\" in the
Deferred data list.

communication initiating MCData client 1. MCData server may include request
for more information (e.g. to know the remaining data volume to transmit).
3\. MCData client 1 informs MCData user about the intent to release
communication.
4\. If request for more information is included in the received MCData release
intent request, MCData client 1 sends MCData more information response
including the remaining amount of data to transmit. Upon receiving more
information response from MCData client 1, MCData server may wait for the
request for extension until the time configured by the MCData administrator.
If MCData server does not receive MCData request for extension within the
configured timeout, the MCData server releases MCData communication as
described in subclause 7.7.2.3. Otherwise, continue with remaining steps.
5\. MCData user at MCData client 1 requests for extension of the ongoing
MCData communication.
6\. MCData client 1 sends MCData request for extension of the MCData
communication.
7\. Upon receiving the MCData request for extension of MCData communication
from the MCData client 1, MCData server asserts policies to accept or reject
the request for extension.
8\. MCData server sends MCData response for extension with success or failure
result to MCData client 1. MCData communication will continue if MCData server
accepted the request for extension from MCData client 1. Otherwise, MCData
communication is released according to procedures described in subclause

status information.
### 7.9.4 Enhanced status for off-network
#### 7.9.4.1 Sharing enhanced status information
##### 7.9.4.1.1 Procedure
The procedure for an MCData user to share the enhanced status information to
the members of the selected group is illustrated in figure 7.9.4.1.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCData
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCData
client 1.
2\. MCData client 1, 2 and n are members of the same MCData group.
3\. The MCData group is pre-configured with the possible values for enhanced
status information.
Figure 7.9.4.1.1-1: Sharing enhanced status information
1\. The user at MCData client 1 selects the MCData group to share the enhanced
status information. The user also selects the value of the status information
to be shared from the list of pre-configured status values available for the
MCData group.
2\. The procedure of off-network group standalone SDS using signalling control
plane as described in subclause 7.4.3.4, is used to deliver the enhanced
status information.
3\. The MCData users at MCData client 2 and n are notified of the enhanced
status information.
## 7.10 MCData emergency alert (on-network and off-network)
The MCData service shall support the procedures and related information flows
as specified in subclause 10.10 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] with the following
clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCData client;
\- The MC service server is the MCData server;
\- The MC service group ID is the MCData Group ID; and
\- The MC service user profile index is the MCData user profile index.
## 7.11 User authentication and authorization for MCData service
NOTE: Flow 7.11-1 is a high level user authentication and authorization flow.
3GPP TS 33.180 [13] defines the specific user authentication and authorization
architecture required by the MCData service in order to realize the MCData
user authentication and authorization requirements as defined in 3GPP TS
22.280 [2].
A procedure for user authentication is illustrated in figure 7.11-1. The user
authentication is performed based on the procedure specified in subclause 10.6
of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
Figure 7.11-1: MCData user authentication and registration, single domain
1\. The user authentication is performed as per the general user
authentication procedure specified in subclause 10.6 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
2\. MCData client performs the MCData service authorization for the user. Step
2 utilizes the results of step 1.
## 7.12 MCData resource management (on-network)
### 7.12.1 General
Procedures for resource management are defined in subclause 10.x of 3GPP TS
23.280 [5].
### 7.12.2 MCData services not handled by SIP core
MCData services that do not utilize the SIP core e.g. IP connectivity, cannot
utilize the resource control functionality of the local outbound / inbound
proxy. For these types of service, resource management is handled directly by
the Rx interface from the MCData server to the PCRF, which is the MCData-5
reference point. The Rx interface is defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [17].
The same types of resource management procedures as defined for SIP based
services in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] may also be applied for non SIP based services.
That is:
\- Request for unicast resources at session establishment (in this case
service initiation);
\- Request for modification of unicast resources; and
\- Request for resources with shared priority.
## 7.13 Operations on MCData message store
The MCData message store allows an MCData user to deposit his MCData
communication information (i.e. messages or files) securely and permanently
for later retrieval. During an active MCData communication, a message or a
file with its associated metadata is deposited as an object in the MCData
message store with an object identifier; this object identifier enabling a
direct access to that object. The objects in the MCData message store are
managed from both the MCData server and the message store client.
Each MCData user is allocated a dedicated and secured storage area (i.e. with
a user account) in the MCData message store. All MCData communications of a
MCData user can be stored in his dedicated storage area. The access to this
secured storage area is possible only after successful authentication and
authorization procedures. A message store client can create a local copy of
the stored objects into the device by synchronizing with the MCData message
store for the MCData user using the device.
### 7.13.1 MCData message store structure
MCData message store supports a tree like architecture to securely store
MCData communications for the MCData users. Figure 7.13.1 below illustrates
the high-level structure of a MCData message store:
Figure 7.13.1 Message store structure
As illustrated in Figure 7.13.1 all MCData user storage areas are accessed
only through the common root. The authorized MCData user shall only have the
access to the MCData user\'s storage area after the successful authentication
and authorization procedures. A MCData user shall not be able to access
objects stored for other MCData users.
The MCData user shall manage his stored objects using message store client
through the MCData-7 reference point. The MCData server shall use the MCData-8
reference point to deposit MCData communication information, during an active
MCData communication, into the designated MCData user\'s storage area in the
MCData message store.
One way to manage user stored objects is using folder hierarchy structure like
the popular email system today. Annex X provides a simple example of how it
will look like in deployment. When the user account is created in the MCData
message store, a default folder (such as Inbox) is also created to capture all
the objects during an active communication. To group relevant stored objects
together and provide easier navigation interactively, a MCData user can create
folders in his user account. Each folder is identified by its unique folder
identifier that is composed with the location of the folder and the name of
the folder. A folder may have child folders to further group the stored
objects in more meaningful ways. For example, the folder identifier of the
default Inbox folder is /MCDatamessagestore /MCDatauser1/Inbox. The folder
identifier /MCDatamessagestore/MCDatauser1/Squad1/20190225 points to a folder
named 20190225 which is a child folder of Squad1 folder in the MCData user1
user account.
NOTE: The details of how the objects are stored in the MCData message store is
out of scope of the present document.
### 7.13.2 Authentication and authorization
The MCData message store shall authenticate the credential of MCData server or
the authorized MCData user before authorizing access to the MCData user\'s
storage area. The success of authentication and authorization shall allow
access to that MCData user\'s storage area only.
NOTE: The authentication and authorization aspects of MCData message store
access and its operational supports are the responsibility of SA3 and thus
outside the scope of the present document.

### 7.13.6 Interconnection and migration with MCData message store
#### 7.13.6.1 Interconnection
There is no interconnection of MCData message stores, as there are no defined
reference points providing connection between message stores in different
MCData systems.
#### 7.13.6.2 Migration
A migrated MCData user may be provided with access to a local message store by
the partner MCData system of the migrated MCData user. The MCData user is
identified by the MCData ID used in the partner MCData system by that migrated
MCData user in order to access the message store. There is no connection
between this message store in the partner MCData system of the migrated MCData
user and any message store that the MCData user has access to in the primary
MCData system of that MCData user, and therefore access to a message store in
the partner MCData system does not provide a means of accessing stored content
in the primary MCData system of the migrated MCData user.
A migrated MCData user may be provided with a means of access to the message
store in the primary MCData system of that MCData user, e.g. by providing the
MCData user with a suitable APN and appropriate IP routing, or by use of the
MCData IP connectivity service. Such access is outside the scope of the
present document.
## 7.14 IP connectivity
### 7.14.1 General
IP data shall be exchanged between two or more data hosts. The MCData client
as the link between data host and MC service system enables the exchange of IP
Data. For addressing the corresponding MCData users either MCData ID or the
functional alias can be used independently of each other. The MCData server
provides the mechanisms to establish the association between MCData ID and
corresponding functional alias.

## 7.15 Location information (on-network)
The MCData system makes use of all of the procedures for location management
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5], utilising the CSC-14 reference point
between the location management client and location management server and the
CSCâ€‘15 reference point between the MCData server and location management
server.
\- The MC service client is the MCData client;
\- The MC service server is the MCData server;
\- The MC service group is the MCData group;
\- The MC service ID is the MCData ID; and
\- The MC service group ID is the MCData group ID.
###### ## Annex A (normative): MCData related configuration data
# A.1 General
This Annex provides information about the static data needed for configuration
for the MCData service, which belongs to one of the following categories:
\- MCData UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);
\- MCData user profile configuration data (see subclause A.3);
\- MCData related group configuration data (see subclause A.4); and
\- MCData service configuration data (see subclause A.5).
For each configuration category, data is split between configuration data that
is applicable to both on network and off network, configuration data that is
applicable to on-network only, and configuration data that is applicable to
off-network only. The configuration data in each configuration category
corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCData UE,
MCData group, MCData user and MCData service configuration data refers to the
information that will be stored against each MCData UE, MCData group, MCData
user and MCData service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network
and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration
category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data
category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.282
[3] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] or the corresponding subclause from either the
present document or the referenced document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter
in the configuration hierarchy.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Parameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy
that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the
configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-
network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within
the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character
\">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level.
Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\"
character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child
parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\"
character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child
parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child
parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they
are just containers for their child parameters.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MCData UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# A.2 MCData UE configuration data
The general aspects of UE configuration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
Data in tables A.2-1 and A.2-2 have to be known by the MCData UE after MCData
authorization.
Data in table A.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference
point. Table A.2-1 contains the UE configuration required to support the use
of off-network MCData service.

# A.3 MCData user profile configuration data
The general aspects of MC service user profile configuration data are
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]. The MCData user profile configuration data is
stored in the MCData user database. The MCData server obtains the MCData user
profile configuration data from the MCData user database (MCData-2).
Tables A.3-1 and A.3-2 contain the MCData user profile configuration required
to support the use of on-network MCData service. Tables A.3-1 and A.3-3
contain the MCData user profile configuration required to support the use of
off-network MCData service. Data in table A.3-1 and A.3-3 can be configured
offline using the CSC-11 reference point.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Transmission control for MCData
# B.1 Overview of transmission control process
The MCData server may receive several simultaneous requests for data
transmission, which may be associated with different types of communication
e.g. group, private, 1-to-many. For each communication, how the requests are
processed may be different. The requests that are not authorized shall be
rejected by the transmission control function. For message requests over the
signalling control plane, the processing should be immediate and is delivered
to the recipients either via unicast or broadcast. However, for message
requests over the media plane, transmission control arbitration (see Annex
B.2) will be necessary. Subsequent to transmission control arbitration, and
subject to the policy e.g. store and forward, the data is either delivered
directly to the recipient MCData user or stored in the network repository and
a corresponding URL is delivered. The end-to-end transmission control process
is illustrated in figure B.1-1.
Editor\'s note: The aspects related to data streaming and accuracy of the
process is FFS.
Figure B.1-1: Transmission control process
# B.2 Transmission control arbitration
The transmission control arbitration is a central function of the transmission
control process and is implementation specific. In a typical deployment,
multiple or simultaneous requests can be received at the transmission control
arbitration function. Each of these requests may be categorized into different
request types with different queuing priorities, and therefore each request
type will be maintained with separate queues. Each request shall not be
present in more than one queue at any given time. The queue types and the
order of queues may be configured by the MCData administrator, as described
below.
\- Transmission control queue: It is the primary queue from which the request
is processed for transmission e.g. emergency communication requests may result
in this queue and processed at the highest priority.
\- Communication type queue: This queue may be sorted in the order of the
communication type associated with the request. For example, the group
communication requests may always take precedence over one-to-many or private
communication requests.
\- Static attribute queue: This queue may be formed based on the static
attributes associated with the request e.g. group priority, user priority,
which may be pre-configured by the MCData administrator.
\- Dynamic attribute queue: This queue may be formed based on the dynamic
attributes associated with the request e.g. location of the sending user,
content size, etc.
###### ## Annex C VOID
###### ## Annex D (informative): Example of a User Message Storage Area
The figure in subclause 7.13.1 illustrates the high-level structure of the
MCData message store where objects are stored in a flat structure in the user
storage area. This flat data structure provides maximum flexibility for UI
implementation to present stored objects to the user. However, a folder
hierarchy structure provides a better visual presentation of the stored
objects to the MCData user.
Figure D-1: User message storage area example
In figure D-1 the MCData user 1 message storage area in the MCData message
store is constructed in folder hierarchical way. A system default folder,
Inbox, is configured to receive all new objects coming from active
communications. The MCData user 1 creates Group 1, Group 2 and Group N folders
to store communication history for different group communications that he is a
member of. Once the Group 1 folder is created the MCData user 1 can then move
all the objects related to Group 1 communication from the Inbox to the Group 1
folder. The MCData user 1 can also create child folders in Group 1 folder to
further divide the stored objects into different groupings such as with
different subjects, Subject 1 and Subject 2. Similarly, the MCData user 1
creates child folders, Date 1 and Date 2, in Group N folder to store
communication history in group N occurred in different dates. With this
hierarchical folder structure, the MCData user 1 can browse his user account
in the MCData message store interactively and navigate to the information he
would like to see. For example, the MCData user 1 can start with the top-level
root folder and traverse down the folder hierarchy to reach to Date 2 folder
and see the communication history of group N in that particular date.
