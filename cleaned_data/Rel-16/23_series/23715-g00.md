RLOS Restricted Local Operator Services
# 4 Architectural Assumptions and Requirements
## 4.1 Architectural Assumptions
The goal of the study is to enable access to those Restricted Local Operator
Services (RLOS), however the definition of such restricted local operator
services offered by an operator is out of scope of 3GPP.
Architectural assumptions are the following:
\- Access to RLOS is only possible for UEs when using EPC via E-UTRAN as
IPCAN.
\- Both unauthenticated UEs and authenticated UEs in limited service state can
access RLOS via the same architecture.
An authenticated UE allowed to access EPC may access the same services that
are provided as RLOS but in this case, it is not within the scope of RLOS. No
work will be done in this area.
\- The UE shall indicate to the EPC and the IMS network that the request is a
request for RLOS.
\- The standard shall support IMS emergency services for UEs attached for
RLOS.
\- Allowing access to RLOS is completely under the local operator\'s control.
\- If the UE performs RLOS attach, the network may perform authentication if
security information is available. Otherwise, authentication to EPC access for
RLOS is skipped.
NOTE: whether authentication for EPC access for roaming UEs in limited state
may be performed based on the presence of specific roaming agreements is to be
stated in the conclusions in clause 9.
\- The solution shall support both non-IMS and IMS RLOS services.
\- When RLOS are accessed via IMS sessions:
1) they do not require any specific support for location over and above what
is defined by IMS already;
2) they do not require any specific support regarding call back to the user
that has initiated the session;
3) the IMS RLOS are securely isolated to avoid e.g. DOS attacks to IMS
entities offering regular IMS services.
\- Only UE-originated RLOS requests are supported.
\- No support of multiple PDN connections for RLOS.
\- No support of mobile terminated services.
\- This feature is only applicable to EPS 3GPP access.
\- Inter-RAT handovers and handover between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses are not
supported.
\- The use of the RLOS feature does not impact the local service provider\'s
ability to support LI.
## 4.2 Architectural Requirements
Editor\'s note: This clause will define the architectural requirements based
on the normative stage-1 requirements defined in TS 22.101, TS 22.115 [3] and
TS 22.228 [4] with regards to Provision of Access to Restricted Local Operator
Services by Unauthenticated UEs.
# 5 Key Issues for EPC
## 5.1 Key Issue #EPC-1: Network indicating support for Restricted Local
Operator Services and related UE behaviour
TS 22.101 [2] specifies: \"When a UE recognizes an origination attempt to a
restricted local operator service and has not received an indication from the
serving system that restricted local operator services are available, the UE
shall block the origination attempt.\"
This key issue addresses:
\- how the PLMN announces its support of RLOS to all UEs;
\- the behaviour of a supporting UE when it detects the network support of
RLOS;
\- the behaviour of a supporting UE when it does not detect the network
support of RLOS.
NOTE: This key issue does not address the mechanisms for rejecting UE requests
in case of an unauthorized attempt to access RLOS.
## 5.2 Key Issue #EPC-2: RLOS request indication
The solution shall address how unauthenticated and authenticated UEs indicate
to the EPC that a request is for RLOS (e.g. at Attach);
## 5.3 Key Issue #EPC-3: Support of unauthenticated UEs access to RLOS
The solution shall address the EPC mechanisms required to support
unauthenticated UEs. In particular, the following aspects are required to be
studied:
\- how to allow unauthenticated UEs to access EPC network for RLOS only if the
EPC network supports RLOS;
\- how to prevent unauthenticated UEs to access services which are not RLOS;
\- how to minimize network congestion caused by unauthenticated UE access to
RLOS in the RLOS enabled PLMN.
## 5.4 Key Issue #EPC-4: Support of authenticated UEs access to RLOS
The solution shall address the EPC mechanisms required to support
authenticated UEs, in particular:
\- how to allow authenticated UEs to access the same RLOS as unauthenticated
UEs. This applies to UEs that the MME has successfully authenticated but the
UE is not able to receive normal service (e.g. is in a forbidden area).
NOTE: Regularly attached UEs able to receive normal service may access the
same services that are provided as RLOS but in this case, it is not within the
scope of RLOS.
## 5.5 Void
## 5.6 Key Issue #EPC-6: Collection of charging information
The solution shall address how to collect charging information regarding the
use of RLOS.
## 5.7 Key Issue #EPC-7: Level of security
The solution shall have a level of security, which should not be less than
that which is currently applied to existing equivalent network access methods
(e.g., unauthenticated emergency calling).
# 6 Key Issues for IMS
## 6.1 Key issue #IMS-1: Support for unauthenticated and authenticated user
The key issue here is that the network enables any UE access to a requested
service through RLOS. This applies to all UEs, authenticated and non-
authenticated.
The solution should use the same mechanisms for both unauthenticated and
authenticated UEs as much as possible.
## 6.2 Key issue #IMS-2: Identification of Restricted Local Operator Services
at IMS layer
The key issue here is that it is beneficial if IMS services allow clear
service identification. For access to restricted local operator service this
means that:
\- the UE need to be able to determine the case and start session setup
without requiring IMS registration for RLOS services. Further the UE will need
to indicate to the IMS network that its request is for RLOS via appropriate
information in the SIP request; and
\- the core network functional entities need to be able to detect the specific
information for an RLOS request.
The study will determine what to configure in the IMS network (e.g., phone
number, captive portal), in which IMS entity(ies), and what to signal to the
UE (e.g. specific CSCF address);
## 6.3 Key issue #IMS-3: Handling IMS session for Restricted Local Operator
Service
At IMS layer, RLOS are always provided in the local PLMN without any
involvement of the Home PLMN.
The key issue for the UE is to support initiating a session setup for RLOS
without requiring IMS registration for RLOS services.
NOTE: UE only initiates IMS sessions for RLOS if the network has indicated
support via signalling in the underlying layers.
The key issue for the IMS core network functional entities is to support
session setup for RLOS from users without requiring IMS registration for RLOS
services. Sessions for RLOS from authenticated and unauthenticated users are
handled in the PLMN that provides the entry point into the IMS. This means
that the IMS core network functional entities of the PLMN that provides the
P-CSCF to which the UE is attached will handle the IMS session request
locally.
## 6.4 Key issue #IMS-4: Support of emergency services by UEs attached for
RLOS
The solution shall describe how a UE attached for RLOS can obtain emergency
services.
# 7 Solutions
## 7.1 Solution #1: New SIB indicating support for Restricted Local Operator
Services
### 7.1.1 Functional Description
This is a solution to key issue EPC-1 and EPC-3.
A new SIB provided by E-UTRAN indicates that the PLMN is configured to support
Restricted Local Operator Services. An operator may decide to unset the SIB
indicator e.g. using OAM to prevent access attempts from UEs for RLOS e.g. in
case of network congestion. The PLMNs where RLOS is supported may be stored in
UICC (or ME) for the UE.
### 7.1.2 Procedures
UE sees through SIB that PLMN supports Restricted Local Operator Services and
only attempts to access RLOS if the SIB is signaled by the camped cell. The
PLMNs where RLOS is configured to be supported may be configured from HPLMN
stored in a new list in UICC (or ME) for the UE. The exact definition and
format of such list and how it will be used for manual or automatic PLMN
selection for RLOS, will be defined by CT WG1 and CT WG6.
Editor\'s note: Whether automatic PLMN selection needs to be supported for
RLOS will be confirmed by CT WG1.
### 7.1.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
E-UTRAN and UE need to support a new SIB that indicates support for Restricted
Local Operator Services. UE only attempts to access RLOS if the SIB is
signaled by the camped cell at the time the UE is accessing the network. The
setting and unsetting of RLOS shall not trigger paging for UEs operating in
other (normal) services.
The PLMNs where RLOS is supported may be configured from HPLMN and stored in a
new list in UICC (or ME) for the UE.
## 7.2 Solution #2: EPC attach/PDN connection for RLOS from
unauthenticated/authenticated UE
### 7.2.1 Functional Description
This is a solution to key issue EPC-2, EPC-3, EPC-4 that defines Attach/Detach
and PDN connectivity procedure for RLOS. The solution considers only the
scenario where the UE requesting RLOS is unauthenticated, or the UE requesting
RLOS is authenticated but in limited state.
### 7.2.2 Procedures
Figure 7.2.2-1: Attach/PDN connectivity procedure for RLOS
0\. A new SIB provided by E-UTRAN indicates that PLMN supports Restricted
Local Operator Services. See clause 7.1.
1\. The UE sends an indication in Attach Request message that the Attach is
for Restricted Local Operator Services (this is similar to the Emergency
Attach indication that is used for \"unauthenticated\" UEs for emergency
calls) which triggers the MME to select a locally configured APN that is used
for RLOS.
In case of the authenticated UE (i.e. in limited state), the UE shall perform
the detach procedure before step 1.
2\. The UE does not need to be authenticated by the MME, IMSI (if available)
and IMEI(SV) are retrieved from the UE.
3\. MME sends a Create Session Request towards the PGW including the
indication that is for RLOS (indication or APN) the IMSI (if available), and
the IMEI(SV) as specified in TS 23.401 [5].
4\. PGW establishes an IP-CAN session with the PCRF as described in TS 23.401
[5] and TS 23.203 [6]. The IP-CAN session is identified with UE\'s IPv4
address or IPv6 prefix associated with the PDN connection for RLOS. The IMSI
(if available), and the IMEI(SV) are passed to the PCRF as part of the IP-CAN
session establishment.
Duration of PDN connection for RLOS is controlled through local policies.
If needed the PGW returns back to the UE in a PCO the P-CSCF address used for
RLOS using procedures defined in TS 23.228 [7] for P-CSCF discovery. The PGW
shall block any traffic that is not from or to addresses of network entities
(e.g. P-CSCF, captive portal) providing Restricted Local Operator Service.
5\. UE completes the Attach or UE requested PDN connection procedure.
#### 7.2.2.2 Detach procedure
When the PGW initiates to delete the default bearer for RLOS, if emergency PDN
connection is not established, the MME performs detach procedure as specified
in TS 23.401 [5].
When the RLOS-attached UE has no emergency PDN connection, if UE is
transferred to ECM-IDLE state, UE and Network shall implicitly detach without
NAS signalling transactions. i.e. if the RRC connection is released after
allowed inactivity period configured in E-UTRAN expires, the UE shall detach
itself implicitly without sending detach request, and if S1-AP is released,
the MME shall detach the UE without sending the detach request.
### 7.2.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
Impacts in UE and MME to implement the procedures defined in clause 7.2.2.
\- UE: UE includes RLOS indication in Attach request for RLOS.
When RLOS-attached UE becomes ECM-IDLE, UE detaches implicitly without NAS
transaction with MME.
\- MME: MME selects the RLOS-dedicated APN to setup PDN connection, and may
include RLOS indication to SGW/PGW.
When the UE attaches for RLOS, MME skips mutual Authentication procedure and
location update to HSS.
When RLOS-attached UE becomes in ECM-IDLE state, MME detaches without NAS
transaction with UE.
## 7.3 Solution #3: IMS procedures for RLOS
### 7.3.1 Functional Description
This is a solution to key issue IMS-1, IMS-2, IMS-3 that defines IMS procedure
for RLOS.
### 7.3.2 Procedures
Figure 7.3.2-1: IMS procedure for RLOS
1\. If the UE is unauthenticated in IMS it initiates IMS registration by
sending a SIP REGISTER (UserID-1) message indicating that is IMS Registration
for RLOS. The UserID-1 parameter is an IMPI and optionally an IMPU.
2\. Upon reception of the SIP REGISTER message from the indication that the
SIP REGISTER is for RLOS the P-CSCF determines that it is for RLOS. The P-CSCF
may optionally request from the PCRF the EPS-level identities (e.g. IMSI,
IMEI(SV)) in the Rx session establishment request. The PCRF performs session
binding based on the UE\'s IP address/prefix (as defined in TS 23.203 [6]
clause 6.1.1.2) and provides one or more EPS-level identities to the P-CSCF.
3\. Based on operator configuration for RLOS, the GIBA procedure over Gm as
defined in TS 24.229 [9] is performed, the P-CSCF responds with a 420 response
with sec-agree value listed in the unsupported header field.
4\. UE according to TS 24.229 [9], performs a new initial registration by
sending a SIP REGISTER (UserID-2, IMEI) message and without inclusion of the
Authorization header field. UserID-2 is an a public user identity derived from
IMSI. P-CSCF may verify the IMSI/IMEI provided by the PCRF in step 7 against
the IMSI/IMEI derived from the public user identity provided by the UE, prior
to accepting the SIP REGISTER message.
5\. P-CSCF accepts the registration with 200 OK. From the UE point of view,
the procedure is the same as specified for GIBA (GPRS-IMS bundled
authentication) procedures in TS 24.229 [9].
6\. UE then attempts an RLOS session by sending a SIP INVITE (UserID-3)
message. UserID-3 is set to UE\'s public identity.
7\. The P-CSCF verifies whether the UserID-3 indicated in the SIP INVITE
message. If compliant, P-CSCF forwards the SIP INVITE towards the Call Centre
that is providing the RLOS.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the P/S-CSCF or AS will restrict access only
to the Restricted Local Operator Services.
### 7.3.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
Impacts in UE, P-CSCF and PCRF to implement the procedures in clause 7.3.2.
## 7.4 Solution #4: EPC solution using dedicated RLOS-APN
### 7.4.1 Functional Description
During the attach procedure:
\- If the UE is not attached to the network and detects that the user is
requesting RLOS, then the UE shall check whether the PLMN is advertising its
support of RLOS to all UEs. If the PLMN does not advertise its support of
RLOS, the UE shall block the origination attempt (according to TS 22.101 [2]
clause 34.2). If the PLMN advertises its support of RLOS, the UE shall
indicate in the Attach Request that the attachment is for RLOS.
If the UE is not in limited service state, it shall not initiate an Attach
procedure with RLOS indication.
If the UE in limited service state initiates an Attach procedure with RLOS
indication, and:
\- If the MME already has valid credentials for the UE, the MME uses the
existing credentials and consider the UE as authenticated for RLOS.
\- If the MME does not have valid credentials for the UE and if the UE IMSI
(retrieved by the MME) corresponds to the PLMN of the MME, then the MME shall
proceed the attach procedure to retrieve the security information from the HSS
which shall attempt to authenticate the UE. Whatever the authentication
result, the MME shall proceed with the RLOS attach procedure: it establishes a
default PDN connection to a specific RLOS APN as part of the Attach procedure,
and accept the RLOS Attach request.
NOTE: Whether authentication for EPC access for roaming UEs in limited state
may be performed based on the presence of specific roaming agreements is to be
stated in the conclusions in clause 9.
\- Otherwise, the MME shall skip the authentication, establish a default PDN
connection to a specific RLOS APN as part of the Attach procedure, and accept
the RLOS Attach request.
Session Management:
\- The solution assumes that a specific RLOS-APN, unique for the PLMN and
configured in the MME, is used.
\- During attach, based on the presence of the RLOS indication in the NAS
Attach Request, the MME may either select a specific RLOS PGW in the same
PLMN, preconfigured in the MME RLOS Configuration Data or a dynamically
allocated PGW in the same PLMN, based on a specific RLOS-APN.
\- During PDN connection establishment, MME send RLOS APN to the SGW and the
PGW. The PCRF derives that the PDN connection is for RLOS via the RLOS-APN.
\- For IMS RLOS sessions, the PCRF may establish dedicated bearers.
\- Because at the end of RLOS session, the UE should be detached, any of the
following procedures triggers a UE Detach procedure:
\- PDN GW initiated bearer deactivation, as described in clause 5.4.4.1 of TS
23.401 [5];
\- UE initiated Detach procedure as described in clause 7.4.2.2 of TS 23.401
[5].
Idle mode mobility and handovers:
\- During idle mobility involving MME change, as in emergency service, if the
UE\'s IMSI is unauthenticated, the unauthenticated IMSI indication will be
sent from the old/source MME to the new/target MME, and if the UE does not
have a USIM, IMSI will not be included in Context Response as specified in TS
23.401 [5] clause 5.3.1.
\- During handover involving MME change, as in emergency service, if the UE is
RLOS attached and the UE does not have a USIM, IMSI cannot be included in the
MME UE context in Forward Relocation Request message, and if the IMSI has not
been authenticated previously, then the IMSI shall be marked as
unauthenticated as specified in TS 23.401 [5] clause 5.5.1.2.
\- No additional impact is expected.
Charging:
\- Charging of RLOS PDN connections can be performed by OFCS and OCS as for
regular PDN connections. The rating group provided by PCRF should just be a
RLOS specific rating group. No changes are needed as the APN is known by the
PCRF.
Location procedures:
\- Location services are not invoked.
### 7.4.2 Procedures
#### 7.4.2.1 Attach procedure
Figure 7.4.2.1-1: Attach procedure
Attach procedure from Figure 5.3.2.1-1 applies, except for the following
aspects:
1\. If the UE has detected that the user is requesting RLOS, the UE shall
check whether the PLMN is advertising its support of RLOS to all UEs. If the
PLMN does not advertise its support of RLOS, the UE shall block the
origination attempt (according to TS 22.101 [2] clause 34.2). If the PLMN
announces its support of RLOS, the UE proceeds to attach by sending an Attach
Request in which it indicates that the attachment is for RLOS (via e.g. Attach
Type and/or Request Type) and it provides its IMSI (or its IMEI if the UE has
no IMSI). The UE shall not identify itself with a temporary identity.
5a. If the MME is configured to support RLOS for unauthenticated IMSIs and the
UE has indicated that the attach request is for RLOS (via e.g. Attach Type
\"RLOS\"), the MME shall behave as described in clause 7.4.1.
5b. This step may be performed based on operator\'s policy.
8\. For an RLOS Attach, the MME shall not send an Update Location Request to
the HSS. However, when required as described in clause 7.4.1, the MME may
retrieve security information from the HSS.
11\. For an RLOS Attach, the MME shall not check for access restrictions,
regional restrictions or subscription restrictions (e.g. CSG restrictions) and
shall continue with the Attach procedure.
12\. For an RLOS Attach, the MME applies the parameters from MME RLOS
Configuration Data for the RLOS bearer establishment performed in this step
and any potentially stored IMSI related subscription data are ignored by the
MME. For initial RLOS Attach, the MME selects either a specific RLOS PGW in
the same PLMN, preconfigured in the MME RLOS Configuration Data, or a
dynamically allocated PGW in the same PLMN, based on a specific RLOS-APN. For
RLOS attached UEs, IMSI is included if available and, if the IMSI has not been
authenticated, then the IMSI shall be marked as unauthenticated. The RLOS
characteristics of the default PDN connection (i.e. APN-AMBR, MBR, ARP) are
pre-configured in the MME.
13\. For RLOS attached UEs, IMSI is included if available and if the IMSI has
not been authenticated then the IMSI shall be marked as unauthenticated.
14\. The PDN GW and the PCRF determines that RLOS are requested based on the
RLOS APN received in Create Session Request message. For RLOS attached UEs
which are unauthenticated, the PDN GW provides the IMEI as the UE Identity
instead of IMSI, to the PCRF. If the PCC is configured to support RLOS and if
dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF, based on the RLOS APN, sets the ARP of the
PCC rules to a value that is reserved for RLOS and the authorization of
dynamic PCC rules. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW uses the ARP of
the default RLOS EPS bearer for any potentially initiated dedicated RLOS EPS
bearer.
17\. The new MME sends an Attach Accept with RLOS indication. For an RLOS
attached UE, i.e. for UEs that have only RLOS EPS bearers established, there
is no AS security context information included in the S1 control messages and
there is no NAS level security when the UE has not been authenticated.
18\. Manual CSG selection is not supported when an RLOS has been initiated.
25\. For a UE in limited service state, if the UE has indicated that the
request of for RLOS (via e.g. Request Type set to \"RLOS\"), the MME shall not
send any Notify Request to an HSS.
#### 7.4.2.2 UE-initiated Detach procedure
UE-initiated Detach procedure from Figure 5.3.8.2-1 of TS 23.401 [5] applies,
except for the following aspects:
Step 1: Security procedures that may be invoked if the NAS message is used to
establish the S1 connection are not performed in the case of RLOS attached UEs
that were not successfully authenticated.
#### 7.4.2.3 MME-initiated Detach procedure
MME-initiated Detach procedure from Figure 5.3.8.3-1 of TS 23.401 [5] applies,
except for the following aspects:
Step 1: For RLOS attached UEs, MME initiates implicit detach procedures when
implicit detach timer specific to RLOS expires or the eNB notifies that the UE
RRC connection is released. And the UE may detach implicitly from the network
when the RRC connection is released.
#### 7.4.2.4 S1-based handover procedure
S1-based handover procedure from Figure 5.5.1.2.2-1 of TS 23.401 [5] applies,
except for the following aspects:
Step 3: For RLOS attached UEs, if the IMSI has not been authenticated, then
the IMSI shall be marked as unauthenticated. Also, in this case, security
parameters are included only if available.
#### 7.4.2.5 UE requested PDN connectivity
An RLOS attached UE shall not initiate any PDN Connectivity Request procedure.
If the MME receives a PDN Connectivity Request from an RLOS attached UE, the
MME shall reject this request.
### 7.4.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
UE:
\- The UE shall check whether the PLMN is advertising its support of RLOS
before requesting RLOS attach.
\- When requesting RLOS, the UE shall verify that it is in limited service
state. If the verification is successful, the UE shall include an RLOS
indication in the Attach Request.
MME:
\- The MME shall be configured with RLOS APN and associated RLOS implicit
detach timer (and potentially with pre-configured PGW(s)).
\- The MME shall behave as described in clause 7.4.1.
PDN GW and PCRF:
\- No impact. Only existing configuration.
## 7.5 Solution #5: IMS solution with dedicated RLOS-APN and RLOS-specific
P/S-CSCF
### 7.5.1 Functional Description
This solution is intended to solve key issues #IMS-1, #IMS-2, #IMS-3 and
#IMS-4.
During the EPC attach procedure, based on the RLOS indication provided by the
UE, the EPC establishes a PDN connection to a specific APN dedicated to RLOS
(see solutions #2 and #4). As RLOS are always provided in the PLMN the UE is
accessing, the UE needs to select a P-CSCF suitable for RLOS sessions in that
PLMN. For that, the address of the suitable P-CSCF is provided in the PCO by
the PGW during Attach procedure. This dedicated address enables the use of
either a general-purpose P-CSCF or a RLOS-specific P-CSCF. Whether a general-
purpose P-CSCF or a RLOS-specific P-CSCF is used depends on the operator
wishes about IMS isolation.
In this solution, the P-CSCF may be configured with a range of IP addresses
reserved for RLOS.
The UE, whatever it is unauthenticated or authenticated in limited service
state, performs an IMS registration for RLOS by adding an RLOS indication in
the SIP Register message (required for general-purpose P-CSCF to determine the
IMS Register is for RLOS). If the UE has indicated RLOS, if the P-CSCF has
been configured with a range of IP addresses reserved for RLOS, the P-CSCF
verifies that the UE IP address is within that range. P-CSCF may also verify
that the PDN connection has been established for the RLOS APN by querying the
PCRF. If one of the above verification fails, the IMS registration is
rejected. P-CSCF skips authentication as described in TS 23.167 [8] clause K.3
for IMS emergency sessions for roaming users in deployments without IMS-level
roaming interfaces.
UE\'s IP address spoofing is still possible, but IP address spoofing is always
possible for unauthenticated UEs in any solution, but proposed verifications
minimize the risks as described below:
\- the IP address would need to correspond to a PDN connection that
corresponds to the RLOS APN.
When the UE is successfully IMS registered for RLOS, it can request RLOS IMS
services. On receiving the SIP Invite for an UE that is IMS registered UE for
RLOS, the P-CSCF shall route the SIP INVITE request to a specific RLOS-CSCF to
satisfy the IMS network isolation requirement (similar principle as for
emergency IMS calls, which uses a specific E-CSCF). Emergency calls are
detected the same way as in a regular P-CSCF and, in this case, the SIP INVITE
request is routed to the E-CSCF. If the P-CSCF has determined that it is not
for an emergency service and if the RLOS-CSCF has determined that the UE SIP
INVITE request if not for RLOS, the UE SIP INVITE request is rejected.
The UE may request RLOS IMS services as long as it is IMS registered for RLOS.
If the IMS registration timer expires, UE can re-register as long as it is EPC
attached to the RLOS APN. However, when the UE is detached from the EPC, the
PCRF shall indicate it to the P-CSCF, which then deregisters the UE from IMS
i.e. it removes the P-CSCF UE context.
When provided, the network provided location information conveyed from the EPC
to the P-CSCF via PCRF shall be forwarded to the RLOS-CSCF.
Charging of RLOS IMS sessions is performed by the IMS network as for a regular
IMS sessions.
**P-CSCF additional features for RLOS**
\- The P-CSCF can be a RLOS-specific P-CSCF or a general-purpose P-CSCF.
\- The P-CSCF detects whether the IMS registration request from an UE is for
RLOS from the RLOS indication provided by the UE. The P-CSCF, if configured
with a range of IP addresses reserved for RLOS, verifies that the UE IP
address is within that range. P-CSCF may also verify that the PDN connection
is established for RLOS attached by querying the PCRF. P-CSCF skips
authentication as described in TS 23.167 [8] clause K.3 for IMS emergency
sessions for roaming users in deployments without IMS-level roaming
interfaces.
\- The P-CSCF selects an E-CSCF if it detects that the UE has initiated an
emergency session request, according to TS 23.167 [8] clause 7.3 (Emergency
Session Establishment in the Serving IMS network). The P-CSCF shall also be
able to detect non-UE detectable emergency sessions as specified in TS 23.167
[8] clause 7.2.
Editor\'s note: Details for non UE-detectable emergency calls are FFS.
\- If available, the P-CSCF shall provide RLOS-CSCF with the NPLI received
from the PGW via PCRF.
\- When the P-CSCF receives an indication from the PCRF that the UE has been
RLOS detached from EPC, it shall deregister the UE from IMS, i.e. it removes
the P-CSCF UE context.
**PCRF additional features for RLOS**
\- The PCRF shall reply to the request from P-CSCF asking whether the PDN
connection was established for RLOS (i.e. to RLOS APN).
\- When the UE is RLOS detached from the EPC, the PCRF shall indicate it to
the P-CSCF.
**RLOSâ€‘CSCF additional features for RLOS**
\- Verifies that the RLOS indication from Pâ€‘CSCF is present.
\- Routes RLOS session establishment requests to an appropriate destination
including anonymous session establishment requests.
\- Generates CDRs for RLOS.
### 7.5.2 Procedures
#### 7.5.2.1 IMS registration
The UE performs IMS registration for RLOS by adding a RLOS indication in the
SIP Register message, which allows the P-CSCF to detect that the IMS
registration is for RLOS. The P-CSCF, if the UE has indicated RLOS, shall
verify that the UE is RLOS attached by querying the PCRF on whether the PDN
connection used for IMS signalling was established for RLOS (i.e. to RLOS
APN). P-CSCF skips authentication, except for local subscribers.
#### 7.5.2.2 Location Information retrieval
Not applicable.
#### 7.5.2.3 UE initiated RLOS IMS session establishment
The following flow contains a high-level description of the RLOS procedures.
Figure 7.5.2.3-1: UE initiated RLOS IMS session establishment
The following steps are performed:
1\. The UE sends an Attach Request to the EPC including an RLOS indication.
The EPC establishes a local break-out default PDN connection for RLOS to the
RLOS specific APN and replies to the UE with an indication that the UE is
attached for RLOS as well as with the address of a P-CSCF suitable for RLOS
sessions (via PCO). The EPC also informs PCRF that the PDN connection is for
RLOS. See solution #4 in the TR for details.
2\. According to clause 7.5.2.1, the UE initiates an IMS registration request
for RLOS to the P-CSCF whose address was received in the PCO during RLOS
Attach. SIP Register message shall contain an RLOS indication. The P-CSCF , if
configured through policies, if the UE has included RLOS indication in the SIP
Register message, it shall verify that, if P-CSCSF is configured with a range
of IP addresses reserved for RLOS, the UE IP address is within that range. It
may also verify that the PDN connection is for RLOS APN. If one of the above
verifications fails, the IMS registration is rejected. P-CSCF verifies whether
the UE is a subscriber of the local operator (via e.g. looking at the IMS
domain).
If the user is an IMS subscriber of the local operator, P-CSCF send the IMS
registration to the RLOS-CSCF (i.e. the local S-CSCF) to retrieve the IMS
subscriber security information, otherwise, P-CSCF skips the authentication as
described in TS 23.167 [8] clause K.3 for IMS emergency sessions for roaming
users in deployments without IMS-level roaming interfaces.
3\. If the UE requests RLOS, it sends a SIP INVITE for the establishment of an
IMS RLOS session with an RLOS indication. The P-CSCF routes the SIP request to
the RLOS specific CSCF. Emergency calls are detected the same way as in a
regular P-CSCF, and in this case the SIP request is routed to the E-CSCF.
### 7.5.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
## 7.6 Solution #6: Solution to key issue #EPC-3 & #EPC-4 to enable IMS calls
after initial attachment
### 7.6.1 Functional Description
There are two options to support RLOS services through the RLOS APN.
In the first option, the RLOS APN can lead to a portal that guides the user to
various services, and after that, the user can establish the VoLTE session. It
is assumed that the SIP signalling in this case may not acquire the QCI 5 that
would typically be associated with an APN dedicated for IMS. It is up to the
discretion of the operator to associate the necessary QCI for the RLOS APN in
this option. The operation of the portal, its functionalities, and its
interactions with the UE are out of scope.
In the second option, the RLOS APN may lead directly to the IMS network to
initiate the requested IMS service. The IMS network can be a regular IMS
network provided that there is sufficient protection to ensure that RLOS users
cannot acquire any service other than RLOS or can be a network dedicated to
provide only RLOS.
It is up to operator policies to select the option it desires.
This is supported thanks to the following behaviour:
1\. If the operator only allows non-IMS RLOS, the PGW does not provide the UE
with P-CSCF address in the PCO. In this case, the UE is redirected to a portal
when sending data.
2\. If the operator allows both IMS and non-IMS RLOS, the PGW provides the UE
with P-CSCF address in the PCO. In such case, the UE attempts to IMS register
with RLOS indicationThe IMS register with RLOS indication is accepted by the
IMS network. The UE may send an IMS session request.
3\. When the IMS network receives the IMS session request, it may either
redirect the UE to a portal (in which case, after exchanges with the portal,
the UE may attempt to attempt IMS sessions again), or it may proceed with the
IMS session request.
All exchanges with the portal are out of scope.
### 7.6.2 Procedures
#### 7.6.2.1 UEs in Limited Service State that cannot be authenticated
Figure 7.6.2-1: IMS access following Attach/PDN connectivity procedure for
Unauthenticated UEs
1\. UE attaches to EPC with RLOS indication.
2\. MME skips authentication.
3\. MME initiates Create Session Request to the SGW/PGW for the RLOS APN.
4\. EPC attachment to the RLOS APN is completed.
5\. Option 1: If the UE received a P-CSCF address in the PCO, the UE performs
IMS Registration. Otherwise, the UE is redirected to a portal when sending
data.
6\. The UE attempts to initiate the RLOS IMS session and the IMS network may
either proceed with the IMS session request or redirect the IMS request to
e.g. an announcement machine, which instructs the UE to initiate a web page.
7\. The UE is connected to the portal and performs (transparently to EPS) any
exchanges with the portal.
8\. Option 2: UE attempts to initiate the RLOS IMS session and is successful.
NOTE: It is out of scope how IMS determines to route an RLOS IMS session to an
announcement or completes the session.
### 7.6.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
This solution requires a new RLOS indication be carried in an initial attach.
The following nodes are impacted:
MME:
\- MME supports RLOS indication from the UE;
\- MME supports configuration of RLOS APN and use this APN for RLOS attach.
## 7.7 Solution #7 to key issues #IMS-1, #IMS-2, and #IMS-3: IMS support for
RLOS users
### 7.7.1 Functional Description
Three RLOS scenarios are addressed in this solution from an IMS network point
of view:
\- In the first scenario, RLOS UEs are allowed to make VoLTE calls even if
their IMS registration cannot be performed (UEs belonging to an external
domain). In this case a temporary registration record will be created for the
UE in the S-CSCF and P-CSCF with a default profile and tagged as
\"unauthenticated external subscriber\". The temporary record is kept for a
period determined by local policies.
\- In the second scenario, RLOS UEs are allowed to make VoLTE calls even if
their IMS registration failed. This is the case for the operator own IMS
subscribers who failed authentication. In this case a temporary registration
record will be created for the UE in the S-CSCF and P-CSCF with a default
profile and tagged as unauthenticated own subscriber. The temporary record is
kept for a period determined by local policies.
\- In the third scenario, RLOS UEs are successfully authenticated (Operator
own IMS subscribers) and are registered in IMS. These RLOS UEs are depicted as
authenticated IMS RLOS UEs.
All IMS nodes performing registration are in the local operator.
Editor\'s note: The usage of P-Asserted-Identity will be included in the
normative phase.
Editor\'s note: Whether P-CSCF or S-CSCF initiates 420 for GIBA is to be
confirmed.
To address the above scenarios, a UE desiring access to RLOS must perform
regular IMS registration with the P-CSCF and must include a feature tag to
indicate its request for RLOS.
**[For scenario 1 (subscribers belonging to external domain) :]{.underline}**
If the P-CSCF realizes that the UE is not its own subscriber based on the
registering IMS identity, it selects a S-CSCF supporting RLOS configured in it
and forwards the SIP Registration to the S- CSCF. The S-CSCF knowing that the
registering UE is not its own subscriber sends back to the UE a 420 if the
S-CSCF supports GIBA or 403 (forbidden) if it does not support GIBA.
If the UE receives 403, it can still initiate an RLOS IMS session, and shall
include an RLOS indication in the IMS session.
If the UE receives 420 and supports GIBA, it sends back a new SIP Register
request to which the S-CSCF responds with a 200 OK. The UE can subsequently
initiate an RLOS IMS session and shall include an \"RLOS indication\" in the
IMS session. The UE can refresh the registration based on the received timer
from S-CSCF following normal IMS re-registration procedures.
If the UE receives 420 and does not support GIBA, the UE can subsequently
initiate an RLOS IMS session, and shall include an \"RLOS indication\" in the
IMS session.
No I-CSCF is involved for case 1.
**[For scenario 2 (UE own subscribers that cannot be successfully
authenticated):]{.underline}** If the P-CSCF realizes that the UE is its own
subscriber based on the registering IMS identity, it performs normal IMS
registration procedure, forwards the IMS registration to an I-CSCF which
selects a S-CSCF that supports RLOS and forewords the registration to the
selected S-CSCF. The S-CSCF challenges the UE with a 401 response. The UE
sends a new SIP Register request and if the authentication fails, then the
S-CSCF returns a 403 forbidden response to the UE.
If the UE receives 403, it can still initiate an RLOS IMS session, and shall
include an RLOS indication in the IMS session.
**[For scenario 3 (UE own subscribers that are successfully
authenticated):]{.underline}** If the P-CSCF realizes that the UE is its own
subscriber based on the registering IMS identity, it performs normal IMS
registration procedure, forwards the IMS registration to an I-CSCF which
selects a S-CSCF that supports RLOS and forewords the registration to the
selected S-CSCF. The S-CSCF challenges the UE with a 401 response. The UE
sends a new SIP Register request and if the authentication is successful, then
the S-CSCF returns a 200 OK to the UE, and a security association shall be
established between the UE and P-CSCF.
The UE can than initiate RLOS IMS sessions and shall include an RLOS
indication in the IMS session. The S-CSCF in this case bypasses originating
services.
NOTE: P-CSCF may be, based on operator policy, be configured with different
policies for all of the above 3 cases which limits the set of destinations for
authenticated and unauthenticated IMS RLOS UEs that it needs to enforce. The
P-CSCF relies on the feature tag, depicting RLOS support, included in the IMS
registration to enforce these policies. The applicable lists for both
authenticated and unauthenticated UEs may be different.
A P-CSCF supporting RLOS can also be used for regular IMS UEs.
The support for emergency calls is described in other solutions
### 7.7.2 Procedures
This will be handled during the normative phase.
### 7.7.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
The solution impacts the following nodes:
**UE:**
An UE desiring access to RLOS must include a feature tag at IMS registration
to indicate its support to RLOS. An UE that receives a 403 forbidden as a
response to an IMS registration can still initiate an RLOS IMS session.
An UE that receives a 420 response to an IMS registration and does not support
GIBA, can still initiate an RLOS IMS session.
In all cases, the UE shall include an RLOS tag in the RLOS IMS session
initiation request.
**P-CSCF:**
The P-CSCF must understand the new RLOS feature tag.
The P-CSCF may be configured with the list of RLOS services to enforce
originating sessions for all three cases discussed above.
The P-CSCF must support incoming RLOS sessions for all three cases discussed
above.
The P-CSCF must create the temporary registration records with default profile
for UEs belonging to an external domain or its own subscribers that failed
authentication.
The P-CSCF must be configured with a list of S-CSCF(s) that support RLOS for
forwarding an incoming registration from a UE belonging to an external domain.
The P-CSCF must insert the RLOS tag for a RLOS IMS session if the UE does not
include one.
**S-CSCF:**
The S-CSCF shall route an incoming RLOS to its target for UEs belonging to the
3 cases described above. For successfully authenticated UEs for the operator
own subscribers, no originating services shall be permitted.
The S-CSCF shall include in the CDR an RLOS tag for all three cases described
above.
**I-CSCF:**
I-CSCF must understand the new capabilities related to RLOS and allocate a
S-CSCF supporting RLOS at IMS registration when the IMS Register request
includes the RLOS feature tag.
**HSS:**
HSS must support enabling a S-CSCF to declare RLOS as supporting capability
The Gm interface shall be enhanced to enable conveying the RLOS indicator.
Cx interface shall support new RLOS capability.
## 7.8 Solution #8: Solution to key issues #IMS-4: Support of emergency
services by UEs attached for RLOS
### 7.8.1 Functional Description
For a UE that is already attached for RLOS services, if the user would like to
request an emergency service, the UE may detach from RLOS and then do
emergency Attach, or the UE may decide to stay RLOS attached and to establish
an emergency PDN connectivity towards the emergency APN, depending on the UE
state (e.g. UE with or without USIM, authenticated or not authenticated).
Editor\'s note: Whether one of the solutions is sufficient or both solutions
should be supported is FFS. Details on what the UE behaviour is for a given UE
state are FFS.
After the emergency attach is completed or after the emergency PDN connection
is established, the UE shall perform IMS emergency registration.
### 7.8.2 Procedures
#### 7.8.2.1 UE performs detach from RLOS and then do emergency Attach
In this procedure:
\- For a UE without USIM, after the UE has been detached from the RLOS, the
emergency EPS attach will be allowed only if behaviour d) of emergency bearer
service support as specified in clause 4.13.12 in TS 23.401 [5] is supported.
\- For a UE with USIM but unauthenticated, after the UE has been detached from
the RLOS, the emergency EPS attach will be allowed if behaviours c) or d) of
emergency bearer service support as specified in clause 4.13.12 in TS 23.401
[5] are supported.
\- For a UE, which is authenticated but in limited service state, after
detached from the RLOS, the emergency EPS attach will be allowed if behaviour
b), c) or d) of emergency bearer service support as specified in clause
4.13.12 in TS 23.401 [5] are supported.

3\. UE performs Detach from RLOS.
4\. UE then perform emergency Attach as specified in TS 23.401 [5].
5\. UE performs IMS emergency registration as specified in TS 23.167 [8].
### 7.8.2.2 UE stays RLOS attached, and establishes emergency PDN connection
In this procedure:
\- For a UE without USIM, when attached with RLOS, the establishment of an
emergency PDN connection will be allowed only if behaviour d) of emergency
bearer service support as specified in clause 4.13.12 in TS 23.401 [5] is
supported.
\- For a UE with USIM but unauthenticated, when attached with RLOS, the
establishment of an emergency PDN connection will be allowed if behaviours c)
or d) of emergency bearer service support as specified in clause 4.13.12 in TS
23.401 [5] are supported.
\- For a UE, which is authenticated but in limited service state, when
attached with RLOS, if behaviour c) or d) of emergency bearer service support
as specified in clause 4.13.12 in TS 23.401 [5] are supported, the
establishment of an emergency PDN connection will be allowed.
\- If behaviour b) in clause 4.13.12 of TS 23.401 [5] is supported, as
authentication is skipped during RLOS attach, the establishment of an
emergency PDN connection will be rejected by the network

### 7.8.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
The solution impacts the following nodes:
**UE** :
A UE is RLOS attach shall be able to detach from RLOS and then do emergency
attach, or initiate emergency PDN connection when UE stays RLOS attached, and
then perform emergency IMS registration.
**MME** :
Support of emergency PDN connection for an RLOS attached UE.
## 7.9 Solution #9: PLMN selection, radio access for RLOS and overload
handling
### 7.9.1 Functional Description
This solution partially addresses Key Issues EPC-1 and EPC-2.
The solution is described as follows:
\- The E-UTRAN is configured to broadcast system information about the support
of RLOS in the PLMN, e.g. as described in Solution #1 in clause 7.1.
\- If the user requests RLOS access and there are more than one PLMNs
supporting RLOS, then the UE selects one of the available PLMNs either a)
based on the user input solicited through the User Interface, or b) other ME
configuration. Once a PLMN has been selected, this PLMN of the current serving
cell is considered as the selected PLMN.
\- During the RRC connection establishment procedure, the UE indicates in the
RRC signalling that the RRC connection is for RLOS access, using RLOS RRC
establishment cause. Based on the RLOS indication in the RRC signalling, the
RAN node applies the following:
\- The E-UTRAN may admit the radio access resources and the E-UTRAN may apply
access control (e.g. in case of RAN overload or congestion control) for UEs
accessing RLOS services. The E-UTRAN may reject the RRC connection
establishment with extended wait timer. UE shall not attempt to establish a
new RRC connection with RLOS RRC establishment cause, in the same PLMN but the
UE can establish RRC connection for other services e.g. emergency or normal
service. How E-UTRAN determines to reject RLOS request is implementation
specific; and
\- The E-UTRAN may select an appropriate MME serving the RLOS access to EPC.
The RAN node forwards the NAS message from the UE to the selected MME.
NOTE 1: The use of RLOS specific MME is one way to limit the impact to
\"normal\" UEs when massive signalling for RLOS is originated from
unauthenticated UEs or authenticated UEs in limited service state.
NOTE 2: The RAN WGs will specify whether a new RRC Establishment Cause or
another indication is used in the RRC signalling.
### 7.9.2 Procedures
Editor\'s note: This clause will describe the high-level procedures and
information flows for the solution.
### 7.9.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
Impacts to UE:
\- UE is able to process new SIB indication;
\- UE is able to indicate request for RLOS service at RRC and at NAS layer;
\- UE NAS layer may interact with the GUI for PLMN selection.
Impacts to RAN:
\- E-UTRAN broadcasts RLOS SIB indication;
\- E-UTRAN may apply RLOS-specific access control and reject RRC signalling
requests with extended wait time;
\- E-UTRAN node (e.g. eNB) is able to select CN node (e.g. MME) based on RLOS
indication.
## 7.10 Solution #10: IMS solution with dedicated RLOS-APN and skipping IMS
registration
### 7.10.1 Functional Description
This solution is intended to solve key issues #IMS-1, #IMS-2, #IMS-3 and
#IMS-4. It reuses most of the principles used in emergency sessions for
unauthenticated and authenticated UEs specified in TS 23.167 [8].
During the EPC attach procedure, based on the RLOS indication provided by the
UE, the EPC establishes a PDN connection to a specific APN dedicated to RLOS
(see solutions #2 and #4). As RLOS are always provided in the PLMN the UE is
accessing, the UE needs to select a P-CSCF suitable for RLOS sessions in that
PLMN. For that, the address of the suitable P-CSCF is provided in the PCO by
the PGW during Attach procedure. This dedicated address enables the use of
either a general-purpose P-CSCF or a RLOS-specific P-CSCF. Whether a general-
purpose P-CSCF or a RLOS-specific P-CSCF is used depends on the operator
wishes about IMS isolation.
In this solution, the P-CSCF may be configured with a range of IP addresses
reserved for RLOS.
The UE, whatever it is unauthenticated or authenticated in limited state,
skips the IMS registration procedure for RLOS. This is similar to emergency
calls for UEs in limited state or when authentication fails specified in TS
24.229 [9] clause 4.7.2.
On receiving the SIP INVITE for an IMS emergency session with a RLOS
indication, the P-CSCF, if configured with a range of IP addresses reserved
for RLOS, verifies that the UE IP address is within the range of IP addresses
reserved for RLOS. It may also verify that the PDN connection has been
established for the RLOS APN by querying the PCRF. This is achieved by the
P-CSCF querying the PCRF. If one of the above verification fails, the SIP
INVITE is rejected.
UE\'s IP address spoofing is still possible, but IP address spoofing is always
possible for unauthenticated UEs in any solution, but proposed verifications
minimize the risks as described below:
\- the IP address would need to correspond to a PDN connection that
corresponds to the RLOS APN.
When these verifications are performed successfully, the P-CSCF shall route
the SIP request to a specific RLOS-CSCF to satisfy the IMS network isolation
requirement (similar principle as for an emergency IMS session, which uses a
specific E-CSCF). Emergency sessions are detected the same way as in a regular
P-CSCF and, in this case, the SIP request is routed to the E-CSCF. If the
P-CSCF has determined that it is an emergency call but emergency calls are not
allowed over RLOS registration, the UE SIP INVITE request is rejected. If the
P-CSCF has determined that it is not for an emergency service and if the RLOS-
CSCF has determined that the UE SIP request if not for RLOS, the UE SIP
request is rejected.
An authenticated UE in limited service state or an unauthenticated UE may
request RLOS IMS services as long as it is EPC attached to the RLOS APN.
Optionally, when the UE is detached from the EPC while an IMS session is still
ongoing (after a timer configured for RLOS APN), the PCRF may indicate it to
the P-CSCF, which shall inform RLOS-CSCF.
When provided, the network provided location information conveyed from the EPC
to the P-CSCF via PCRF shall be forwarded to the RLOS-CSCF.
Charging of RLOS IMS sessions is performed by the IMS network as for a regular
IMS sessions.
**P-CSCF additional features for RLOS**
\- The P-CSCF can be a RLOS-specific P-CSCF or a general-purpose P-CSCF.
\- The P-CSCF detects whether a SIP request from an UE is for RLOS from the
RLOS indication provided by the UE. The P-CSCF may be configured with a range
of IP addresses reserved for RLOS, and if so, it verifies that the UE IP
address is within the range of IP addresses reserved for RLOS. It may also
verify that the PDN connection is established for RLOS APN and that the
IMEI/IMSI used for the EPC attach is the same as the one received in the SIP
request by querying the PCRF.
\- The P-CSCF selects an E-CSCF if it detects that the UE has initiated an
emergency session request, according to TS 23.167 [8] clause 7.3 (Emergency
Session Establishment in the Serving IMS network). The P-CSCF shall also be
able to detect non-UE detectable emergency sessions as specified in TS 23.167
[8] clause 7.2.
Editor\'s note: Details for non UE-detectable emergency calls are FFS.
\- If available, the P-CSCF shall provide RLOS-CSCF with the NPLI received
from the PGW via PCRF.
\- When the P-CSCF receives an indication from the PCRF that the UE has been
RLOS detached from EPC while an IMS session is still active, it shall inform
RLOS-CSCF.
**PCRF additional features for RLOS**
\- The PCRF shall understand the RLOS indication in the request from P-CSCF
asking whether the PDN connection was established for RLOS (i.e. to RLOS APN).
\- When the UE is RLOS detached from the EPC, the PCRF shall indicate it to
the P-CSCF.
**RLOSâ€‘CSCF additional features for RLOS**
\- Receives the RLOS indication from Pâ€‘CSCF.
\- Routes RLOS session establishment requests to an appropriate destination
including anonymous session establishment requests.
\- Generates CDRs for RLOS.
### 7.10.2 Procedures
#### 7.10.2.1 IMS registration
The UE, when EPC attached for RLOS, skips the IMS registration the same way as
in emergency session for unauthenticated UEs (See TS 23.167 [8] clause 7.1.1).
#### 7.10.2.2 Location Information retrieval
Not applicable.
#### 7.10.2.3 UE initiated RLOS IMS session establishment
The following flow contains a high-level description of the RLOS procedures.
Figure 7.10.2.3-1: UE initiated RLOS IMS session establishment
The following steps are performed:
1\. The UE sends an Attach Request to the EPC including an RLOS indication.
The EPC establishes a local break-out default PDN connection for RLOS to the
RLOS specific APN and replies to the UE with an indication that the UE is
attached for RLOS as well as with the address of a P-CSCF suitable for RLOS
sessions (via PCO). The EPC also informs PCRF that the PDN connection is for
RLOS. See solution #4 in the TR for details.
2\. The UE skips the IMS registration.
3\. If the UE requests an IMS RLOS, it sends a SIP INVITE with an RLOS
indication to the P-CSCF address received in the PCO during EPC Attach. The
P-CSCF, if configured with a range of IP addresses reserved for RLOS, verifies
that the UE IP address is within the range of IP addresses reserved for RLOS.
The P-CSCF may also query the PCRF to verify that the PDN connection is for
RLOS APN and to verify that the IMSI/IMEI corresponding to the UE IP address
received in the SIP INVITE is the same as the one returned by the PCRF. If one
of the above verifications fails, the SIP INVITE is rejected. Otherwise, the
P-CSCF verifies whether emergency calls under RLOS registration is allowed and
routes the SIP INVITE to the RLOS specific CSCF. Emergency calls are detected
the same way as in a regular P-CSCF, and in this case the SIP INVITE is routed
to the E-CSCF.
### 7.10.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
UE:
\- The UE shall include a RLOS indication in the SIP INVITE when requesting an
IMS RLOS.
P-CSCF:
\- The P-CSCF shall be able to detect the RLOS indication.
\- The P-CSCF shall be able to add RLOS indication when querying PCRF, and to
check if the PDN connection is for RLOS APN in the answer from PCRF.
\- The P-CSCF shall be able to route the SIP requests for IMS RLOS to a
specific RLOS CSCF in the local PLMN.
PCRF:
\- The PCRF shall be able to store the RLOS indication provided by the PGW at
IPCAN session establishment.
\- The PCRF shall be able to understand the new parameter \"RLOS indication\"
in the query from the P-CSCF and verify that the PDN connection related to the
UE IP address is to the RLOS APN.
## 7.11 Solution #11: Partial security solution for key issue #EPC-7
### 7.11.1 Functional Description
NOTE: the description of this solution in this TR does not prevent work on
other solutions for this key issue.
In order to reduce the fraud risks associated with RLOS, the UE shall not
offer RLOS services to the user unless the serving cell has a Mobile Country
Code from the set {310, ..., 316}.
This does not prevent all false base station attacks outside of the USA, hence
the UE should also use other sources of information (e.g. GPS, time and
country of last authenticated access, etc) to warn the customer of base
stations outside of the USA which are broadcasting a USA Mobile Country Code
and indicating that they provide RLOS service.
### 7.11.2 Procedures
The UE does not offer RLOS service if the serving cell does not have an MCC
from the set {310, ..., 316}.
When the serving cell does have an MCC from the set {310, ..., 316}, the UE
should deploy local intelligence (e.g. based on its geographic awareness) to
determine the severity of the warning it gives to any user requesting RLOS
service.
### 7.11.3 Impact on existing entities and interfaces
UE:
The UE already implements special behavior for Mobile Country Codes from the
set {310, ..., 316}. This behavior would need to be extended to determine
whether to pass RLOS information to the user.
New, implementation specific, mechanisms within the UE are needed to determine
the likelihood that any cell advertising RLOS service is part of a genuine
RLOS PLMN. These can be assisted by existing capabilities in the UE: e.g. the
UE tracks \'time\' (for periodic updating purposes) and last visited TAI
(=MCC+MNC+TAC) (for part of the TAU procedure). Most modern smartphones also
include GPS and potentially other GNSS capabilities.
Network:
No impact.

Key issue #IMS-4: Support of emergency services by UEs attached for RLOS
Description Advantages Drawbacks

Solution #3 Not described.  
Solution #5 UE does not detach to initiate an emergency call: the P-CSCF will
route the emergency call to E-CSCF. No need to detach from RLOS APN to obtain
emergency call. Minimal changes to P-CSCF. None. Solution #8 The UE may detach
from RLOS and then do emergency Attach, or the UE may decide to stay RLOS
attached and to establish an emergency PDN connectivity towards the emergency
APN. Not clear which procedure is intended. Complexity / more impacts if we
have to implement both.
# 9 Conclusions
For Key Issue EPC-1 (Network indicating support for Restricted Local Operator
Services and related UE behaviour), it is agreed that:
\- A new SIB provided by E-UTRAN indicates that the PLMN is configured to
supports Restricted Local Operator Services.
\- The PLMNs where RLOS is supported may be stored in UICC (or ME).
\- In automatic PLMN selection, if registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN
and at least one PLMN offering restricted local operator services has been
found, the UE shall behave as stated in TS 22.011 [10] clause 3.2.2.2.
For Key Issue EPC-2 (RLOS request indication), it is agreed that:
\- The UE shall indicate in the Attach Request that the attachment is for
RLOS.
\- During the RRC connection establishment procedure, the UE indicates in the
RRC signalling that the RRC connection is for RLOS access, using RLOS RRC
establishment cause, per solution #9.
For Key Issues EPC-3 (Support of unauthenticated UEs access to RLOS) and EPC-4
(Support of authenticated UEs access to RLOS), it is agreed that:
\- For congestion issue, solution #9 is adopted.
\- For EPC access issue, solution #4 is adopted with the following
clarifications:
\- Authentication for EPC access for roaming UEs in limited state may be
performed based on local operator policy;
\- MME initiated detach based on RRC release or implicit detach timer is
excluded;
\- Handling related to End of RLOS session is excluded (as \"End of RLOS
session\" is not defined);
\- The following PGW function proposed in solution #2 is adopted: duration of
PDN connection for RLOS is controlled through local policies in PGW;
\- For configuring access to IMS after initial attachment to EPC, solution #6
is adopted.
For Key Issue EPC-6 (collection of charging information), it is agreed that:
\- Solution #4 is adopted.
For Key Issues IMS-1 (Support for unauthenticated and authenticated user),
IMS-2 (Identification of Restricted Local Operator Services at IMS layer) and
IMS-3 (Handling IMS session for Restricted Local Operator Service), it is
agreed that:
\- For UEs unauthenticated at IMS layer (manual roamers) and for UEs whose
IMSI belongs to the local operator, the solution 7 is adopted, complemented
with the solution 5 optional capabilities for security checks (to be tuned
during normative phase), with the following clarification:
\- Whether the P-CSCF may be configured to consider UEs whose IMSI belongs to
the local operator as unauthenticated UEs will be decided by SA WG3.
For Key Issue IMS-4 (Support of emergency services by UEs attached for RLOS),
it is agreed that:
\- Solution in clause 7.8.2.1 \"UE performs detach from RLOS and then do
emergency Attach\" is adopted to support emergency service for a RLOS attached
UE.
For key issue EPC-7:
\- In order to avoid MitM attacks, TLS can be used for any server that
provides PaRLOS service e.g. using HTTPS or SIPS. How the Server
authentication is performed e.g. using the server certificates and authorized
trust anchor root CA certificates, procedures for validation of the server
certificate, etc. will be studied in SA WG3.
\- For operators that do not require support for PaRLOS they can indicate that
in their terminal requirements so that PaRLOS can be by default \"disabled\"
and enabled only after user\'s consent.
Overall security impacts will be further studied and concluded by SA WG3/TSG
SA.
